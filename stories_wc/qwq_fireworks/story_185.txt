Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them again to make sure I don't miss any:

Character: peculiar collector  
Object: old pencil stub  
Core Concept: buried talents  
Attribute: infuriatingly calm  
Action: tweak  
Method: by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench  
Setting: probability mapping center  
Timeframe: across millennia  
Motivation: to make a final stand  
Tone: fractured grace  

First, the setting is a probability mapping center. That sounds like a place where probabilities are analyzed or mapped, maybe a futuristic or scientific setting. The peculiar collector is the main character. They need to have that attribute of being infuriatingly calm, so their demeanor should be composed even in crisis. 

The object is an old pencil stub. How can that tie into the core concept of buried talents? Maybe the pencil represents unused or forgotten talent. The collector could be someone who collects such objects, each with a story of unfulfilled potential. 

The method involves decoding keys left in a piano bench. The keys might be piano keys, and decoding their arrangement could be a puzzle the collector solves. The action is "tweak," so perhaps adjusting something based on the decoded keys. 

The timeframe is across millennia, so the story might span a long time, maybe the collector has existed for a long time or is dealing with something that has been buried over millennia. The motivation is to make a final stand, implying a last-ditch effort against something. 

Tone: fractured grace – a sense of beauty or elegance that's been broken or is fragile. Maybe the setting has remnants of past glory, or the character's calmness is a facade over inner turmoil.

Plot structure: The collector is in a probability mapping center, perhaps trying to prevent a catastrophe. They use the pencil stub and the decoded piano keys to tweak something critical. Their buried talent might be their ability to see probabilities, which they've suppressed or ignored. The final stand is against an impending disaster, using their collected knowledge and the decoded keys to make the necessary tweak.

Character development: The collector's calmness is a defense mechanism, but their true motivation is to right past wrongs or fulfill a destiny. The pencil stub could symbolize their own buried talent – maybe they were once a musician or artist but abandoned it, now using their skills in the center.

World and atmosphere: The probability mapping center could be a high-tech facility with elements of decay, reflecting the fractured grace. The piano bench with keys left in it might be an anachronism, hinting at a past where art and science were more intertwined.

Putting it together: The collector has been working in the center for millennia, trying to predict and prevent disasters. They've collected objects like the pencil stub, each representing a lost talent or potential. The piano keys' arrangement is a code that reveals a critical flaw in the probability maps. By decoding it and tweaking the system, the collector makes their final stand to avert disaster, embracing their buried talent (maybe as a pianist or someone who understands patterns through music) and finding grace in their fractured existence.

Need to ensure all elements are tightly integrated. The pencil stub is part of the collection, maybe used to write down the decoded keys. The tweak is the action taken after decoding. The timeframe across millennia gives the collector experience and a long-term perspective. The motivation to make a final stand ties into their accumulated knowledge and the urgency of the moment.

Check for coherence: The collector's calmness helps them focus under pressure. The probability center's setting allows for the method of decoding keys as part of their analysis. The buried talents theme is shown through the objects and the collector's own past. The tone is maintained through descriptions of the setting and the character's internal state.

Now, structuring the story into sentences, keeping track of word count. Each sentence followed by the current total in <words> tags. Start with the story tag, end with closing it. Ensure the total is between 550-620.

Let me draft the first few sentences:

"The peculiar collector stood in the humming heart of the probability mapping center, her fingers tracing the grooves of an old pencil stub. <words>12

The stub’s graphite was smudged, its wood splintered—a relic of a talent she’d buried beneath millennia of calculations. <words>30

Around her, holographic maps of futures flickered, each branching path a ghostly thread in the air. <words>47

She was infuriatingly calm, even as the center’s alarms began to wail, their discordant notes clashing with the piano bench’s silent keys in the corner. <words>76

Those keys—the ones left frozen in a bench from an earlier age—held the clue. <words>98

For days, she’d decoded their arrangement, each ivory fragment a symbol in a language older than the stars. <words>123

Now, the final equation crystallized: the maps were wrong. Cataclysm loomed not in a distant future, but in the present, masked by probabilities skewed by human fear. <words>173"

Wait, need to check word counts. Let me recount. The first sentence is 12 words. The second adds 18 (total 30). Third adds 17 (47). Fourth adds 29 (76). Fifth adds 22 (98). Sixth adds 25 (123). Seventh adds 50 (173). Hmm, okay. Continue building, ensuring each element is included and word count stays within limits. Make sure each element is there: collector, pencil, buried talents, calmness, tweak via piano keys decoding, probability center, millennia timeframe, final stand, fractured grace tone.

Proceeding step by step, ensuring each part is integrated. Maybe the collector uses the pencil to write down the decoded keys, which allows her to tweak the system's parameters. The final stand is her confronting the impending disaster, using her collected knowledge and the decoded keys. The tone is maintained through fragmented sentences and imagery of broken beauty.

Need to reach the word count, so after each sentence add the current total. Let me continue drafting and count as I go, making sure elements are all there and the story flows cohesively.

Her motivation sharpened: to make a final stand against the collapse of all timelines. <words>195  
With the pencil, she sketched corrections onto the bench’s surface, its worn wood accepting the marks like a confession. <words>223  
The tweak required precision—a single misplaced note could unravel centuries of work. <words>247  
As she worked, the center’s walls pulsed with the weight of millennia, its architecture a mosaic of fractured grace. <words>280  
Each key’s position revealed a buried truth: the piano had been a relic of her own past, a talent abandoned when she chose logic over melody. <words>322  
The pencil’s tip trembled, but her calmness held. She was no longer just a collector; she was the last architect of possibility. <words>360  
The decoded keys formed a chord, a vibration that realigned the maps’ fractures. <words>384  
Time bent, centuries folding into seconds as she finalized the tweak. <words>407  
Alarms stilled. The holograms reset, branching paths now leading to survival. <words>430  
But the victory was bittersweet. Her own buried talent had cost her the chance to play that piano in its prime. <words>460

Across millennia, she’d found her final stand not in defiance, but in the quiet act of remembering. <words>586  
The probability mapping center hummed on, its maps now a tapestry woven with the threads of buried talents, resurrected. <words>620
