Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

Character: calm assassin. So the main character is an assassin, but they're calm. That's an interesting contrast. Maybe they're methodical or collected, not the typical explosive type.

Object: botanical press. Hmm, a botanical press is used to preserve plants. How does that fit into a story with an assassin? Maybe it's a tool they use, or a clue, or part of the setting.

Core Concept: whispers of longing. This needs to be a central theme. Perhaps the assassin hears whispers that represent desires or regrets of others, which drives the plot.

Attribute: figuratively literal. So something that's both a metaphor and a real thing. Maybe the whispers are real sounds but also have deeper meanings.

Action: amalgamate. To combine things. The assassin might need to merge elements, like the botanical press and the whispers, into a plan or a prophecy.

Method: by the pattern of a butterfly's wings. The method of amalgamation is based on a butterfly's wing pattern. Maybe the assassin uses a specific pattern from a butterfly to combine elements, like in chaos theory or some mystical way.

Setting: ancient Chinese palace. The story is set in an ancient Chinese palace, so the atmosphere should reflect that—maybe with traditional architecture, maybe during a historical period.

Timeframe: before the first question is asked. The events happen prior to any questioning. The assassin acts before someone can ask something important, perhaps preventing an interrogation or a revelation.

Motivation: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility. The assassin wants to turn a prophecy into a tangible outcome. Maybe they're trying to make a prediction come true by their actions.

Tone: humorous unease. A mix of humor and discomfort. The assassin might have a dry sense of humor, and the situation is tense but with some light-hearted moments.

Now, how to weave these together.

The calm assassin could be tasked with a mission in the palace. The botanical press might be a key object—maybe it contains preserved plants that are part of the prophecy. The whispers of longing could be actual voices that the assassin hears, perhaps from the plants in the press or the palace's history. The method of the butterfly's wings might relate to how the assassin moves or plans their actions, using a pattern that mirrors chaos theory (butterfly effect) to create the desired outcome. The assassin's calm demeanor allows them to handle the situation with humor despite the tension.

The timeframe "before the first question is asked" could mean that the assassin must act before a key figure (like an emperor or a sage) can ask a critical question that might uncover the prophecy or their mission. The motivation is to ensure the prophecy becomes reality, so they might have to manipulate events by combining (amalgamate) elements like the botanical press's contents and the whispers, using the butterfly's pattern as a guide.

Let me outline the plot:

1. The assassin enters the palace, calm and observant.
2. They notice a botanical press in a hidden room, containing special plants.
3. The plants emit whispers of longing, which the assassin interprets as parts of a prophecy.
4. The assassin must combine (amalgamate) the plants' properties or the whispers into a plan.
5. Using the butterfly's wing pattern as a method, perhaps arranging the plants in a specific way to create a disturbance (butterfly effect) leading to the prophecy's fulfillment.
6. The setting's ancient palace provides a rich, detailed environment with hidden chambers and historical context.
7. The humor comes from the assassin's dry comments about the absurdity of their mission, while the unease stems from the high-stakes, secretive nature of their task.
8. The timeline constraint—acting before a question is asked—adds urgency. Maybe the assassin knows that once someone asks a question, it'll be too late, so they must act swiftly.

I need to ensure all elements are tightly integrated. The botanical press isn't just a prop but integral to the prophecy. The whispers are both literal (they can hear them) and figurative (representing deeper desires). The butterfly's wing pattern could be a literal design they follow or a metaphor for their methodical approach. The calm assassin's motivation is tied to altering the future by making the prophecy real, which requires precise actions.

Potential challenges: Making the humor fit without breaking the tension. Maybe the assassin has a witty internal monologue. The amalgamation could be blending the plants in the press with the whispers to create a potion or a symbol. The butterfly's wings might guide where to place each plant to form a specific pattern that triggers the prophecy.

Let me start drafting, keeping sentences concise and ensuring each element is addressed. After each sentence, track the word count precisely. Need to stay between 550-620 words, so I'll have to be careful with length. Also, the tone must balance humor and unease, so perhaps the assassin makes a joke about the absurdity of their mission while the situation is tense.

I'll start with the setting, introduce the assassin, their mission, the botanical press, the whispers, and the method. Build up to the climax where they use the butterfly pattern to amalgamate elements, ensuring it's before the first question is asked. End with the prophecy taking shape, fulfilling the motivation.

<story>  
The calm assassin stepped into the moonlit courtyard of the ancient Chinese palace, her boots silent on the cobblestones. The air smelled of jasmine and impending rain. She paused, listening to the whispers of longing that curled around the eaves—a chorus of unspoken regrets and buried desires from the palace’s past. Her mission was clear: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility before the first question was asked.

Her target was the Emperor’s botanical press, hidden in the Jade Conservatory. It held specimens of *hua ling*, a flower said to bloom only when destiny shifted. The assassin had studied its petals: delicate, iridescent, and figuratively literal—each fold a map of futures. She’d once dissected a similar bloom, its scent lingering like a half-remembered joke. Now, she’d need its pollen to amalgamate the prophecy with reality.

The conservatory’s doors creaked open, and she froze. A guard’s shadow flickered near the press. Humor steadied her—*How absurd*, she thought, *to fear a man who guards dead plants*. She melted into the gloom, her dagger glinting like a moth’s wing. The guard muttered about his wife’s insomnia, his longing a thread in the palace’s tapestry of whispers.

Reaching the press, she lifted the *hua ling* specimen. Its petals were brittle, yet the whispers grew louder. She remembered the butterfly’s wings from her training: their fractal patterns could bend light, but here, they’d bend time. To amalgamate the prophecy, she’d arrange the pollen in the wings’ design—a chaos of order, meant to nudge the Emperor’s curiosity.

A floorboard groaned behind her. The guard had followed the scent of her jasmine perfume—a literal ruse, since she’d soaked her cloak in it. She spun, dagger raised, but the guard stumbled into a potted plum tree. “Forgive me,” he gasped, “but the moon… it’s too bright.” She let him live. Some truths were kinder left unasked.

She sprinkled pollen onto the press’s pages, tracing the butterfly’s pattern. The whispers coalesced: *“A ruler’s question will split the dawn.”* Her blade hovered over the Emperor’s name in the conservatory ledger—a final stitch in the prophecy’s fabric. The pollen shimmered, now a living ink. If he found it, he’d ask the question that would fracture his reign… and fulfill the *hua ling*’s promise.

Dawn’s first light seeped through the windows. She retreated, her mind a quiet storm. The assassin had always preferred endings where the blade stayed sheathed, but prophecies demanded blood. Or pollen. Or both.

At the palace gates, she paused. A servant hurried past, clutching a scroll. “The Emperor seeks the botanical press!” he cried. The assassin smiled. The pattern had taken. Somewhere, a butterfly’s wings trembled in the wind, and the Emperor’s question—*Why does the flower bloom now?*—had already altered the world.  

<words>577</words>  

She melted into the crowd, her mission done. The whispers followed, but now they carried a new note: hope. Or maybe it was just the scent of jasmine. Either way, she’d done her part.
