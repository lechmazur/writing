Okay, let's tackle this story request. The user wants a 500-600 word story that includes all the given elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can be woven together cohesively. 

Starting with the character: a spineless mercenary. That suggests someone who's perhaps not very brave, maybe reluctant, but still involved in some kind of mission. The core concept is "uncharted horizons," which makes me think of exploration or venturing into the unknown. The object is a Victorian dollhouse key, which seems small but important. The attribute "grandly trivial" means that something trivial has grand significance. The action is "mentor," so maybe the mercenary is being mentored or mentoring someone. The method is "through forgotten trails," so the journey is through old, possibly forgotten paths. The setting is a "map projection room," which could be a place where maps are displayed or projected. The timeframe is "during the hush after the wind no longer howls," indicating a calm after a storm or a tense period. The motivation is to "hush a prophecy spoken in code," so there's a prophecy that needs to be silenced, and it's in code. The tone is "luminous doubt," which combines light and uncertainty.

Now, how to integrate all these. The spineless mercenary could be in a map projection room, perhaps seeking guidance. The Victorian dollhouse key might be a key to a map or a hidden location. The forgotten trails could be the paths on the map. The mentor figure might be someone guiding the mercenary through the trails, but since the mercenary is spineless, maybe they're reluctant. The prophecy in code needs to be deciphered, and the key might unlock that. The luminous doubt tone can be shown through the mercenary's uncertainty and the setting's atmosphere.

Let me outline the plot. The mercenary is in the map room, given the key by a mentor. The key opens a dollhouse that has a map leading to the prophecy's source. The journey through forgotten trails leads to the place where the prophecy can be hushed. The key's "grandly trivial" nature is that such a small item holds immense power. The prophecy's code could be in the dollhouse's layout or something inside. The hush after the wind stops could be the calm before the mercenary confronts the prophecy. The mentor might be a ghost or a hologram in the map room, providing guidance. The ending could have the mercenary succeeding but with lingering doubt, hence the luminous doubt tone.

I need to ensure each element is tightly integrated. The Victorian dollhouse key must be central to the plot, not just a prop. The map projection room is where the journey starts, so the setting is crucial. The mentor's role is through forgotten trails, so maybe the mentor's advice is about following old paths. The motivation to hush the prophecy ties into the core concept of uncharted horizons—venturing into the unknown to silence the prophecy. The tone of luminous doubt can be reflected in the mercenary's internal conflict and the eerie setting.

Potential structure: Start in the map room, introduce the mercenary's reluctance. The mentor gives the key, explaining its importance. The mercenary uses the key to access a hidden map in the dollhouse. They journey through forgotten trails, facing doubts. The climax is confronting the prophecy, using the key to silence it. The resolution leaves some uncertainty, maintaining the luminous doubt.

Need to check word count. Each sentence's word count must be tracked. Let me start drafting, ensuring each element is included and the flow makes sense. Make sure the spineless mercenary's motivation is clear—maybe they're being forced into this but have a change of heart? Or they're just following orders. The key's grandly trivial aspect could be emphasized by its small size but great power. The forgotten trails as part of the map projection's routes. The prophecy in code might be written in the dollhouse's rooms. 

Avoiding any markdown, just plain text within story tags. Each sentence followed by the word count. Let's start writing and track the words carefully to stay within 500-600.

<story>  
The spineless mercenary lingered in the map projection room, his boots scuffing dust that clung to the air like ash. The walls hummed with holograms of continents stretched thin, their edges fraying into static. A clockwork chime echoed, and the room dimmed, leaving only a single spotlight on a Victorian dollhouse key resting in a velvet-lined tray. <words>75</words>  
“Take it,” a voice hissed from the shadows. The mentor—a gaunt figure in a moth-eaten coat—stepped forward, her breath fogging the cold air. “The prophecy’s code is etched in the rooms that key unlocks. Silence it before the next storm.” She gestured to a tattered map unspooling from the ceiling, its ink bleeding into forgotten trails. <words>142</words>  
The mercenary hesitated. The key’s ornate teeth glinted, too delicate for anything but trinkets. “A dollhouse?” he muttered. The mentor’s eyes narrowed. “Grandly trivial? The smallest hinges swing the widest doors.” She vanished, leaving only the scent of burnt cinnamon. <words>200</words>  
He grasped the key, its weight a whisper in his palm. The hush after the wind’s retreat pressed against the room’s cracks, as if the world held its breath. Outside, the forgotten trails coiled like serpents through unmapped valleys. The mercenary followed them, the key’s cold surface a tether to purpose. <words>262</words>  
At twilight, the trails led to a crumbling estate. The dollhouse sat atop a rotting mantel, its miniature windows glinting with stolen light. The key fit, turning with a sigh. Inside, rooms unfolded not in wood but in parchment, each a fragment of the prophecy’s code—a riddle of stars and scars. <words>326</words>  
“The first breath of winter,” he read aloud, his voice trembling. The walls rippled, revealing a final chamber: a mirror reflecting not his face, but a crowd chanting in shadows. The prophecy’s words spiraled—*“When the key turns in the doll’s throat, the hush will break.”* <words>393</words>  
Doubt clung like the luminous glow of fireflies trapped in the room. To hush the prophecy, he’d have to destroy the dollhouse, erase the code forever. But the mercenary’s spine had always been a fiction. He reached for the key, then paused. What if the code was a warning, not a curse? <words>457</words>  
He pocketed the key instead, leaving the dollhouse intact. The mirror’s crowd faded. Outside, the forgotten trails began to vanish, their paths dissolving into mist. The mentor’s voice echoed, not reproachful, but resigned. “You chose doubt’s light over certainty’s dark. The horizons stay uncharted.” <words>525</words>  
The mercenary walked into the hush, the key warm now against his chest. Somewhere, a wind began to howl again, but he turned his back to it. The world’s secrets, he decided, were better left in half-glimpsed rooms—where trivial things held the weight of unspoken truths. <words>592</words>
