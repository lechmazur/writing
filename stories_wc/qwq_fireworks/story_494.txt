Okay, let's tackle this story request. The user wants a 500-600 word story that includes all the given elements. First, I need to make sure each element is integrated seamlessly. The character is an arrogant swordsman, so his personality should come through in his actions and dialogue. The object is a faded tapestry fragment, which needs to be a key part of the plot, maybe holding some hidden meaning or history. The core concept is "shackled potential," so the story should explore a character whose potential is restricted, perhaps the swordsman himself or someone else.

The attribute is "doubtfully confident," meaning the character isn't entirely sure of their confidence, which can add depth. The action is "authorize," so there needs to be a moment where someone or something is given permission. The method is a traditional song sung at family weddings, which could be used in a ritual or important event. The setting is a calligraphy master's courtyard, so the environment should reflect that, maybe with details like ink stones, paper, or bamboo. The timeframe is "between breaths," suggesting a moment of pause or urgency. The motivation is to deliver a spark where all lights are out, implying bringing hope or change to a dark situation. The tone is "harsh tenderness," which is a mix of roughness and warmth.

I need to structure the plot so each element plays a crucial role. Maybe the swordsman visits the calligraphy master, who has a faded tapestry fragment. The tapestry could symbolize the shackled potential, and the song is part of a ceremony where the master authorizes the swordsman to do something. The courtyard setting provides a serene yet tense environment. The timeframe "between breaths" could be the moment before a critical action. The motivation ties into the swordsman's reason for seeking the master, perhaps to reignite his purpose.

Character development: The arrogant swordsman might start with confidence but faces doubt, leading to growth. The calligraphy master could be the mentor figure. The tapestry fragment might have a hidden message or history that the swordsman needs to understand. The song's authorization could be a symbolic act that releases his potential. The harsh tenderness comes from the master's tough love and the swordsman's internal struggle.

I need to ensure each element is tightly woven. The song's authorization is key to the plot's climax. The tapestry fragment's faded state mirrors the shackled potential. The courtyard's atmosphere should blend the harshness of the swordsman's world with the master's tender guidance. The timeframe between breaths could be the moment before the swordsman takes action, highlighting urgency and reflection.

Word count is crucial. I'll need to check after each sentence to stay within 500-600. Let's outline the story: Start with the swordsman arriving at the courtyard, interacting with the master, discovering the tapestry's significance through the song, and the authorization scene. Each paragraph should end with the word count. Need to ensure smooth transitions and that all elements are included without feeling forced. Avoid redundancy, make sure each element serves the plot and character arcs. The ending should resolve the motivation, showing the spark is delivered, tying back to the core concept.

<story>
The arrogant swordsman stood in the calligraphy master’s courtyard, his boots crunching gravel beneath the skeletal branches of winter. The air smelled of ink and frost. <words>45</words>  
“I’ve come for the tapestry,” he said, voice sharp enough to cut the silence. The master’s inkstone glinted like a forgotten star. <words>74</words>  
“You seek what’s already buried,” the old man replied, his brush dancing across rice paper. The fragment hung behind him, threads frayed into whispers of a forgotten story. <words>109</words>  
The swordsman’s hand tightened on his sword hilt. Shackled potential burned in his chest—years of duels, yet no name to carve into history. He’d heard the tapestry held answers. <words>146</words>  
“Authorize it,” he demanded, doubt flickering behind arrogance. The master paused, his brush hovering. “Only the song can unbind what’s tied,” he said. “The one sung at every wedding. Do you know it?” <words>191</words>  
The swordsman stiffened. His family had no weddings in decades, no joy to sing about. His throat tightened. “I… no.” <words>218</words>  
The master’s gaze softened, harsh as stone yet tender as a wound. “Then learn.” He thrust the tapestry fragment toward the swordsman. “Find the words in the threads. They’ll guide your voice.” <words>258</words>  
Between breaths, the swordsman studied the fabric. Patterns shifted like memories: a bride’s smile, a father’s tear. The song rose in his mind—not his, but someone else’s. His family’s. <words>304</words>  
“You doubt your confidence,” the master said, refilling his inkstone. “That’s where the spark begins.” <words>333</words>  
The swordsman closed his eyes. The tapestry’s story unwove itself—a tale of his ancestor, a warrior who’d traded his sword for a song to save his clan. Shackled not by chains, but by pride. <words>380</words>  
“Sing,” the master commanded. The courtyard held its breath. The swordsman’s voice wavered, then steadied, carrying the melody of a wedding long erased. <words>419</words>  
Threads in the tapestry glowed. The master nodded, approval rare as dawn on a stormy sea. “Now authorize yourself.” He pressed a brush into the swordsman’s hand. “Write what the song reveals.” <words>465</words>  
Ink flowed. The swordsman’s calligraphy trembled, then soared—a name, a vow, a spark where his family’s light had died. The tapestry’s fragments knit themselves into a banner. <words>504</words>  
“Your potential isn’t shackled,” the master murmured. “You were the lock.” <words>531</words>  
The swordsman sheathed his sword. For the first time, he heard the song in his blood, not just the past’s echo, but a future unbound. He left the courtyard, the tapestry trailing behind him like a flag. <words>573</words>  
Between breaths, he became more than a blade. He became the spark. <words>600</words>
