Okay, the user wants a story that combines all these elements. Let me start by listing them again to make sure I don't miss anything. The character is a cold-natured knight, so maybe someone stoic or reserved. The object is a child's lost mitten. Core concept is artistic awakening, so the story should involve some form of art coming into their life. The attribute is lawfully rebellious, meaning they follow rules but also break them when necessary. The action is support, and the method is via incomplete family altars. The setting is a secret agent center. Timeframe is at the hush of a deserted intersection late at night. Motivation is to collect folk remedies. Tone is close distance, which probably means intimate or personal.

Hmm, how to tie all these together. The knight works at a secret agent center, maybe as an agent? Cold-natured suggests they don't show emotions easily. The mitten could be a clue or a symbol. Artistic awakening might come through the altars. Since the method is incomplete family altars, perhaps the knight uses these altars to support someone, maybe in their mission to collect folk remedies. The motivation is to collect these remedies, which could be part of their job or a personal quest.

The timeframe is a deserted intersection at night. Maybe that's where the knight finds the mitten. The tone being close distance means the narrative should be tight, maybe from a third-person limited perspective. Let's see, the knight is lawfully rebellious—so they might follow protocols but also take personal initiative. The incomplete family altars could be part of the secret agent center's operations, like memorials for agents lost in the line of duty. The mitten might belong to a child whose parent is missing, leading the knight to investigate, thus supporting the family through the altar.

Wait, the action is support, so the knight is supporting someone via these altars. Maybe the altars are a way to honor lost family members, and the knight helps families by maintaining them. The folk remedies could be part of the altars' offerings, which have some significance. The artistic awakening could come when the knight starts to see beauty or deeper meaning in the altars, changing their cold nature.

Let me outline the plot: The knight is at a secret agent center, maybe on night duty. They find a lost mitten at an intersection, which leads them to a family's altar that's incomplete. The knight, motivated by collecting folk remedies (maybe as part of their job or personal healing), starts to support the family by completing the altar. Through this, they experience an artistic awakening, realizing the importance of human connections, thus rebelling against their cold nature but staying lawful by following their duty.

I need to ensure all elements are integrated. The secret agent center setting needs to be clear, maybe described as a hidden facility. The knight's lawful rebelliousness could come into play when they decide to help the family against protocol. The mitten is the trigger, leading them to the altar. The folk remedies are part of the altars, so maybe each altar has remedies left by families, and the knight collects them as part of their job but starts to understand their deeper purpose.

Tone-wise, keeping it close and intimate. Maybe focus on the knight's internal thoughts as they interact with the mitten and altar. The artistic awakening could be the knight starting to create art themselves as part of the altars, using the remedies in some symbolic way.

Let me check word count. The story needs to be between 550-620 words. Each sentence should be followed by the current word count in tags. I'll have to write concisely, making each element serve multiple purposes. For example, the mitten isn't just a lost item but a symbol of a missing child, linking to the incomplete altar. The knight's motivation to collect remedies can tie into both their job and personal growth.

Also, ensuring the timeframe is at night in a deserted area, so the setting can be described with quiet, maybe moonlit streets. The secret agent center might have a hidden entrance near the intersection. The knight's cold nature is shown through their detachment, but their rebelliousness is when they choose to help despite orders.

I think that's a solid outline. Now, structuring the story step by step, making sure each element is included and integrated smoothly. Start with the knight at the secret agent center, go to the intersection, find the mitten, trace it to an altar, support the family through the altar, leading to their awakening. The folk remedies collected could be part of the altars' offerings, and the artistic aspect is the knight's realization of art in the altars' arrangements.

<story>  
The cold-natured knight stood at the hush of a deserted intersection, her breath a sharp line in the night air. The secret agent center’s shadow loomed behind her, a black cube hidden beneath the city’s underbelly. <words>65</words> Her mission—to collect folk remedies for the agency’s archives—had led her here, though she’d never admit it aloud. Protocol dictated silence, but her rebellious heart hummed beneath her armor. <words>124</words>  

A glint of red caught her eye. A child’s lost mitten, half-buried in snow. She crouched, the wool frayed at the cuff, and tucked it into her coat. Not part of her orders, but the knight’s lawful code demanded small mercies. <words>186</words>  

Inside the center, fluorescent lights buzzed like trapped wasps. She passed rows of incomplete family altars—crude shrines to agents vanished in the field. Each held trinkets: a wedding ring, a child’s drawing, vials of herbal poultices. Folk remedies, she thought, her fingers brushing a jar of thyme tea. The agency called them “cultural artifacts.” She called them lifelines. <words>263</words>  

The mitten weighed in her pocket. She traced its threads to a nearby apartment complex, where a widow knelt before an altar of her own. A photograph of a missing son, a half-empty jar of elderberry syrup. The knight hesitated—interfering was against orders—but rebellion whispered, *Support.* She left the mitten beside the photo. <words>340</words>  

Days passed. The widow’s altar grew: a sketch of the knight’s silhouette, a note that read, *Thank you.* The knight’s chest tightened, a sensation unfamiliar as sunrise. She began adding to the shrines herself—a sprig of mugwort here, a silver locket there. Each object a rebellion against her icy shell. <words>412</words>  

One night, the widow invited her inside. Over chamomile tea, she spoke of her son’s love for mosaic art. The knight’s hands itched. That weekend, she raided the center’s archives, smuggling tiles and glue. By dawn, a mosaic crowned the widow’s altar: a phoenix rising from thyme and mugwort. <words>485</words>  

The agency chief found her at the intersection again, arranging a new altar for a missing agent. “This isn’t protocol,” he growled. “Nor is it,” she said, placing a vial of lavender oil beside a child’s crayon drawing, “the only way to honor the lost.” He glared, then nodded—a silent pact. <words>556</words>  

Word spread. Agents left their coldness at the door, joining her in crafting altars. The knight’s once-rigid armor softened, its edges gilded with paint and purpose. Folk remedies became art, grief became beauty, and in the hush between breaths, she found herself. <words>620</words>
