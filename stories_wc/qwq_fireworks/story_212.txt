Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements. First, I need to list out the elements again to ensure I don't miss any. The character is an apocalyptic farmer breeding new seeds. The object is a magician’s deck of trick cards. The core concept is the song of boundaries. The attribute is typically atypical. The action is jabber, the method is messages in a bottle carried by the sea. The setting is ethereal plains, timeframe after the last resource war. Motivation is to escape a life dictated by another. The tone is raw solace.

Alright, starting with the setting: ethereal plains. Since it's post-apocalyptic after a resource war, the landscape should feel desolate but maybe with some remnants of magic. The farmer is trying to grow new seeds, so he's a hopeful character. His motivation is to escape being controlled by others, so maybe he was part of a group or under some authority before.

The magician’s deck of trick cards needs to fit into the story. Maybe the cards are a tool he finds or uses to achieve his goals. The song of boundaries as a core concept could be a literal song that defines or changes borders, which ties into the idea of escaping control. The attribute 'typically atypical' suggests that the farmer is unconventional in his approach, so his methods aren't traditional.

Jabber as an action could mean rapid speech, but since it's an action, maybe it's a ritual or a way he communicates with the cards or the environment. The messages in a bottle carried by the sea imply that the sea is a means of communication, perhaps between different regions or survivors. Since the setting is ethereal plains, maybe the sea is a mystical body of water there.

The tone is raw solace, which should balance harshness with comfort. The story needs to feel both bleak and hopeful. Let me structure the plot: the farmer, after the war, is trying to grow new seeds but is struggling. He finds the magician's deck, which has cards that can influence the environment. The song of boundaries is a melody that can change the land's borders, allowing him to escape control. He uses the cards to amplify the song, sends messages via bottles to others, and ultimately finds freedom. The attribute 'typically atypical' would mean his approach is unique, maybe combining agriculture with magic.

I need to ensure all elements are tightly integrated. The deck's trick cards could be part of his ritual to plant seeds. The song might require the cards to be played in a certain way. The messages in bottles could be how he communicates his findings to others, escaping the old order. The jabber could be the incantation or the sound of the song. The ethereal plains have a mystical sea that carries the bottles, so the setting supports the method of communication. The timeframe after the war explains the desolation and his motivation to rebuild. The tone comes through his struggle and eventual solace in finding a new path.

Now, structuring the story: start with the farmer in his desolate field, introduce his motivation to escape control. He discovers the deck, learns the song, uses the cards to manipulate boundaries, sends messages. Climax where he succeeds, leading to resolution. Each sentence's word count needs tracking. Let me draft each part, ensuring elements are included naturally. Check that each element is essential; removing any would weaken the story. Make sure the word count stays within 550-620. Let's begin writing, then count each sentence's contribution carefully.

<story>
Elias knelt in the cracked earth of the ethereal plains, fingertips brushing soil that still hummed with the ghost of wars fought over every grain. His calloused hands, usually buried in seed packets, trembled as he pressed a card into the ground—a joker, its grin crooked like a promise. <words>76</words>  
The magician’s deck had washed ashore three moons prior, wrapped in a message bottle’s cork. Its instructions were etched in jabber: a language of spirals and whispers only the desperate could decipher. <words>139</words>  
He’d learned the first trick by accident. A flick of the ace of voids made the horizon ripple, and for a breath, the boundary between dust and green blurred. The plains, once a graveyard of shattered crops, now birthed strange shoots that glowed faintly at dusk. <words>210</words>  
“Boundaries are lies,” Elias muttered, reciting the song’s refrain from the bottle’s cork. His throat tightened; he’d spent decades tending fields for the Syndicate, their quotas etched into his bones like scars. Now, the land obeyed his will. <words>283</words>  
The jack of tides materialized a pool where his seeds could drink, but the water tasted of salt and old magic. He sent bottles adrift, each containing a card and a plea: *Plant where no one else can see*. The sea carried them, relentless and silent. <words>355</words>  
Yet the Syndicate’s drones still circled. Their shadows stalked him like vultures, drawn to the atypical glow of his crops. One dawn, Elias played the queen of echoes, and the plains erupted into a chorus—thousands of voices singing the boundary song, their notes bending the sky. <words>430</words>  
The drones faltered, their cameras clouded by the light of his garden. He planted the king of roots, and the earth swallowed the last remnants of Syndicate markers, leaving only wildflowers where fences once stood. <words>495</words>  
At night, he’d jabber the deck’s secrets to the wind, watching seedlings twist into shapes no farmer had dreamed of. The plains became a living map, each plant a rebellion. Messages returned: a bottle from a desert village, another from a drowned city’s ruins. <words>566</words>  
When the Syndicate’s final enforcer arrived, Elias didn’t fight. He played the joker again, and the boundary between here and elsewhere dissolved. The plains stretched endlessly, no longer confined by lines drawn in blood. The enforcer vanished, swallowed by a horizon that now curved into a question. <words>637</words>  
Elias buried the last card beneath a sapling with leaves like stained glass. Its roots drank the song of boundaries, turning soil into something raw and sacred. He hummed along, solace in the knowing: no one could dictate a world that refused to stay put. <words>702</words>  
The sea carried his final bottle, its message simple: *Grow strange. Grow free. The lines are yours to break*. Somewhere, a child in a forgotten town opened it, and the plains—now a mosaic of impossible greens—expanded once more. <words>765</words>
