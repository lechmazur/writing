The orchard pilot, Veyra, strapped herself into the cockpit of her glider as the first tremors of inversion hummed through the soil. [18]

Below, the orchard planet’s golden groves swayed, their roots twisting upward as gravity flipped, sending loose fruit and floating rock arches spiraling into the violet sky. [35]

She adjusted the glider’s rudder, her fingers brushing the broken arrow tip tucked into the dash—a relic from her mentor, who’d vanished years ago while chasing the planet’s oldest mystery. [55]

*"Find the source of resilience,"* he’d whispered before launching into the last inversion, his voice still echoing in the hollows of the arches like a gathering of ghosts. [74]

Veyra banked hard, navigating by the shifting currents of an underground river now flowing *upward*, its water tracing silver paths through the air. [92]

The glider shuddered as she accelerated past a cluster of floating boulders, their surfaces crusty with bioluminescent moss that pulsed faster the closer she flew. [112]

She’d discovered long ago that the moss didn’t just glow—it *accelerated* growth, coaxing seeds to sprout midair, vines to lash out like whips, all within minutes. [132]

A shadow flickered across the cockpit. [136]

Veyra craned her neck and saw it: a fracture in the largest arch, its stone veins weeping sap instead of water, thick and golden as the fruit below. [153]

Her mentor’s last transmission had mentioned *"the heart of the echo"*—a place where the planet’s resilience wasn’t just survival, but *creation*. [171]

She dove, the glider’s wings skimming the inverted treetops, their branches now stretching toward the abyss where the sky should be. [187]

The broken arrow tip vibrated against the dash. [192]

Veyra’s breath hitched. [194]

The fracture wasn’t a crack—it was a *mouth*, lined with the same moss, and from its depths spilled a soundless hum, a whirling silence that pressed against her eardrums like a physical force. [218]

She landed on the arch’s curve, boots sinking into the spongy moss, and reached inside. [230]

Her fingers closed around something warm. [234]

A seed. [235]

Not just any seed—one that *pulsed*, its shell etched with the same spirals as the floating rocks, as the water’s path, as the echoes that had guided her here. [253]

The inversion’s hour was ending. [256]

Gravity groaned, the planet rolling back into place, and Veyra barely had time to shove the seed into her belt before the glider lurched skyward. [274]

As she climbed, the orchard below righted itself, fruit thudding back to branches, arches settling like sleeping beasts. [290]

But the moss on her gloves didn’t fade. [293]

It *spread*, creeping up her wrists, and where it touched, her skin prickled with new strength, her veins thrumming with the same resilience that had kept this planet alive through countless inversions. [318]

She pulled the seed from her belt. [321]

It had split open. [323]

Inside, curled like a promise, was a sapling—its leaves already unfurling, already *singing* in a voice that wasn’t sound but something older, something that vibrated in her bones. [342]

Veyra smiled. [343]

The echoes weren’t ghosts. [345]

They were *instructions*. [346]

She banked the glider toward the horizon, where the next arch waited, its fracture glowing like a beacon. [360]

The planet had been trying to teach them all along. [365]

Resilience wasn’t something you found. [368]

It was something you *grew*. [370]

The broken arrow tip crumbled to dust on the dash, its purpose fulfilled. [378]

Veyra pressed her palm to the sapling and felt the whirling silence bloom into understanding. [387]

She wasn’t just a pilot anymore. [390]

She was the first to hear the planet’s true voice—and the first to answer. [399]

As the glider soared over the golden groves, the moss on her skin shimmered, and the arches hummed in harmony, their echoes no longer scattered but gathered, at last, into a chorus. [425]

Below, the orchard stretched endlessly, alive with the secret she now carried: that every inversion, every fall, every broken thing was just the beginning of something stronger. [448]

Veyra adjusted her course, aiming for the planet’s untouched core, where the oldest echoes waited. [460]

She would plant the sapling there. [463]

And when the next inversion came, the world would see what resilience could build. [472]

The glider hummed, the wind carried the scent of ripening fruit, and for the first time, the silence didn’t feel empty. [488]

It felt like a breath held before a shout. [493]

Veyra grinned. [494]

She was ready to scream back. [497] </story>
