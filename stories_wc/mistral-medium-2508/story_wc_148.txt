The lighthouse stood like a rusted needle in the throat of the sea, its beam a slow, copperlight pulse over the jagged reef. [19]
Elias, the boy who cried wolf’s son, knew the lie of the place better than the truth—how the tide hissed through the iron bars, how the prisoners’ whispers curled into the mortar like smoke. [45]
He wasn’t supposed to be here, not before dawn, not with the lattice from the confessional tucked under his arm, its wood still warm from the last sin pressed against it. [70]
The lattice was old, carved with knots that shouldn’t hold but did, sustaining impossibilities the way his father’s stories had once sustained their village—until they didn’t. [98]

The door to the lighthouse prison was never locked, only left ajar, its scuffs worn smooth by decades of hesitant fingers. [119]
Elias slipped through, his breath shallow, chasing *hush*—that rare, trembling silence between a held note and a scream. [135]
The warden called it madness, this need to thread the labyrinth of the tower with his own story, but Elias knew better: the dead here weren’t just bones. [156]
They were echoes, and echoes could be rewoven.

The first body would be found at noon, tangled in the gearworks of the light, but for now, the air hummed with the weight of what hadn’t happened yet. [183]
Elias pressed the lattice against the wall, and it stuck—not by nail or glue, but by some hungrier affinity, as if the stone itself had been waiting. [207]
He climbed, his fingers finding purchase in the gaps between the wood and the wall, hovering just shy of falling, just shy of belief. [230]

Halfway up, the whispers started. [235]
Not from the cells below, but from the lattice, vibrating under his palms like a plucked string. [247]
*"You’re late,"* one sighed, a voice thick with salt and old blood. [255]
*"They always are,"* another answered, dry as crumbling paper. [262]
Elias didn’t flinch. He’d been raised on voices that weren’t there.

The beam of the lighthouse caught him then, painting his shadow long and wavering across the curved wall. [283]
In that copperlight, the lattice glowed faintly, veins of gold threading through the wood—his father’s last gift, carved from the confessional where the boy had first learned the shape of a lie. [312]
*"You want to change the ending,"* the whispers murmured. [320]
*"So did he."*

Elias reached the top, where the glass was cracked in a spiral, like a scream frozen mid-breath. [335]
Below, the reef waited, teeth bared. [339]
He pressed his forehead to the cool pane and whispered back, *"I want to change the beginning."* [350]

The lattice shuddered. [352]
The wood split—not broke, but *unfolded*, peeling into layers of parchment-thin truth, each sheet etched with a name. [368]
His father’s was there, nestled between a thief who sang hymns and a warden who’d forgotten his own. [382]
Elias plucked it free.

The hush came then, real and absolute, the kind that lives in the space before a gunshot or a kiss. [399]
He held the name to the light, and for a heartbeat, the beam flickered—not copper, but the pale blue of a held breath. [416]
Somewhere below, a door creaked. [420]
They were coming.

Elias tucked the name into his sleeve, where it burned like a secret. [431]
The lattice groaned as it knit itself back together, the names sinking into the wood, the gold veins dimming to dull brown. [448]
He descended faster than he’d climbed, the scuffs on the door framing his exit like a wound. [462]

Outside, the tide was turning. [465]
The prisoners would be found soon, their bodies curled like question marks in the rusted gears. [476]
But the boy who cried wolf’s son walked the reef with his father’s name humming against his ribs, and when the warden asked what he’d seen, Elias only smiled. [496]
*"Nothing,"* he said. [498]
*"Just the light."* [500]

And for the first time, it was true. [504]

(Not that anyone would believe him.) [508]

The lattice, back in the confessional, never spoke again. [515]
But sometimes, when the wind hit the lighthouse just right, the beam flickered blue. [525]
And the reef, for a moment, held its breath. [530]

---
The bodies were found at noon, just as Elias knew they would be. [540]
The warden called it an accident. [544]
The villagers called it a curse. [547]
Elias called it a start. [550]

He kept the name in his pocket, where it stayed warm. [556]
And when the next storm came, he returned to the lighthouse, the door still ajar, the scuffs still waiting. [572]
The whispers were louder this time. [576]
So was he. [578]

*"Tell me another one,"* they begged. [582]
Elias grinned, copperlight in his teeth. [586]
*"This time,"* he said, *"it’s yours."* [590]

The lattice hummed. [592]
The reef listened. [594]
And the story began again. [597] </story>
