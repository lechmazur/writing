The abandoned circus train had sat rusting in the desert for decades, its painted wagons bleached by the sun, their once-vibrant stripes now ghostly under the moon. [31]

Lior worked in silence, his calloused hands smoothing the warped wood of a carousel horse, its mane still flecked with gold leaf like captured sunlight. [54]

He never spoke—not because he couldn’t, but because words had always felt like intrusions on the quiet hum of the world, a world that whispered back in the creak of wood and the sigh of wind through broken slats. [85]

Tonight, the air carried a *misting hush*, a dampness that didn’t belong in the desert, as if the train itself exhaled the memory of rain. [104]

Lior’s fingers brushed against something lodged in the horse’s hollow flank—a sliver of metal, cold and light, its edges jagged like a broken promise. [126]

He pulled it free: a *halo fragment*, no larger than his palm, its surface etched with spirals that caught the dim light and scattered it like thrown confetti. [147]

It didn’t belong here. [150]

Neither did the sound that followed—a melody, thin and wavering, drifting from the last car where the funhouse mirrors had all shattered years ago. [168]

Lior stood, the fragment warm now in his grip, and followed the song. [178]

The train’s corridors twisted, but he didn’t question the *wrong turn* that led him deeper, past wagons where trapeze nets sagged like spiderwebs, where a single wind chime—its pipes green with age—swayed without wind. [206]

The singing grew clearer, a woman’s voice, raw and *quietly persistent*, the kind of sound that didn’t ask to be heard but refused to be ignored. [225]

He stepped into a car that shouldn’t have existed: an *oasis* of untarnished velvet, the air thick with the scent of oranges and damp earth, the walls lined with mirrors that didn’t distort but *expanded*—showing not his reflection, but possibilities of him. [257]

In one, he spoke. [260]

In another, he danced. [263]

At the center of the car, a woman in a moth-eaten sequin dress cradled a broken music box, her throat working as she sang a lullaby in a language that sounded like wind through reeds. [286]

She stopped when she saw him. [289]

“You’re late,” she said, though her voice held no blame, only the weight of something long expected. [304]

Lior held out the halo fragment. [308]

She took it, pressing it to her temple where a matching scar glowed faintly, like a memory struggling to take shape. [322]

“The train doesn’t forget,” she murmured. [327]

Neither did the silence. [330]

It had been waiting for him to *interpret* it—not as absence, but as a space wide enough to hold the things no one else had dared to say. [348]

The wind chime outside began to ring, its notes weaving into the woman’s song, the *chime of wind bells* marking the edges of a moment that had no beginning or end. [369]

Lior opened his mouth. [372]

No sound came out. [375]

But the woman smiled, because this time, the silence wasn’t his retreat—it was his offering. [388]

She placed the halo fragment in his palm, closing his fingers around it. [398]

“Sing,” she whispered. [401]

So he did. [404]

Not with his voice, but with his hands—shaping the air between them into something tangible, a melody of sawdust and rust, of all the things the circus had carried and lost. [427]

The mirrors rippled. [430]

The train groaned, its bones settling as if it had been holding its breath for years. [443]

Outside, the desert exhaled, the *misting hush* lifting like a veil, revealing the first stars Lior had ever felt were his to name. [460]

The woman faded with the song, her edges blurring into the velvet dark, but the halo fragment remained, pulsing faintly against his skin. [479]

When he returned to the carousel horse, its wooden eye gleamed—not with paint, but with something deeper, something *whispering* back. [496]

He picked up his tools. [499]

The work wasn’t done. [502]

It never would be. [505]

But for the first time, the silence didn’t feel like an end. [514]

It felt like a door. [517]

And Lior, the carpenter who had spent a lifetime listening, finally understood: some doors weren’t meant to be opened. [532]

They were meant to be *built*. [535]

One careful, persistent piece at a time. [541]

The wind chime rang again, softer now, as if it had been waiting for him to hear it—not as a sound, but as an invitation. [560]

Lior smiled. [562]

Then he began. [565]
