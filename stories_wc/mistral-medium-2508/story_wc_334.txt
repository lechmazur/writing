The first time Dr. Elias Vey detected the fracture in the constellations, he was knee-deep in the black water of the sunken orchard, his fingers brushing the gills of a fairy ring mushroom that shouldn’t have grown there. [35]

The greenhouse had been his obsession for decades—ever since the storm of ’89 swallowed the coastal estate whole, dragging its glass bones and iron ribs into the tide like a drowned leviathan. [65]

Elias, a hands-on folklorist with a chronically curious streak, had spent thirty years mapping the wreckage, convinced the orchard’s myths held more than just salt and rot. [92]

That night, the water was unnaturally still, the kind of quiet that made his skin prickle, and when he surfaced, the stars above the greenhouse’s shattered dome were wrong. [118]

Not shifted. *Broken.* [121]

A jagged absence where the Hunter’s Bow should have been, as if someone had plucked threads from the sky and left the rest to unravel. [140]

He knew then: the thief had returned. [145]

The fairy ring in his palm pulsed faintly, its cap dusted with the same iridescent residue he’d found on the shipwrecks encircling the greenhouse—vessels that had run aground not by storm, but by *choice*, their crews lured by something singing from the depths. [179]

Elias had interviewed the last surviving sailor years ago, a man who whispered about a "memory eater" that stole not gold, but the weight of a life’s worth of moments. [204]

The sailor’s own past had been hollowed out like a gourd; he remembered his name, his trade, but not the face of his wife, not the taste of his mother’s bread. [227]

Elias had dismissed it as dementia—until his own habits began to break. [238]

First, the small things: forgetting where he’d left his field notes, misplacing his grandfather’s compass. [250]

Then, the gaps widened. [253]

He’d stand in his study, staring at a photograph of himself as a boy, holding a starfish in the orchard’s shallow pools, and feel nothing—not pride, not nostalgia, just the crisp ache of a space where feeling *should* be. [283]

The fairy ring was the key. [287]

According to the old texts, such mushrooms only bloomed where the veil between worlds had been torn by greed, and the residue on their caps could *detect* what had been taken—if you knew how to listen. [316]

Elias waded deeper into the greenhouse, the water lapping at his ribs, until he found the epicenter: a stone pedestal half-buried in silt, its surface carved with a constellation map that mirrored the broken sky. [345]

His breath hitched. [347]

The residue on the mushroom flared blue when he pressed it to the stone, and the water around him *hummed*, a vibration that climbed his spine and settled behind his eyes like a held note. [372]

Memories surged back in fragments—a child’s laughter, the scent of apple blossoms, the sting of his first betrayal—each one slipping through his fingers before he could grasp it whole. [398]

The thief wasn’t just stealing. [401]

It was *trading*. [403]

The shipwrecks, the drowned orchard, even the broken stars—all of it was payment for something the memory eater had offered: a second chance, a cleaner slate, the illusion of starting over. [427]

Elias’s hands trembled. [430]

He had spent decades chasing the past, but what if the past was the thing that had been chasing *him*? What if the gaps in his mind weren’t losses, but *spaces held open*? [457]

The water rippled. [459]

Something moved in the darkness beyond the greenhouse, a shape coiled around the wreckage of a schooner, its hull split like a wishbone. [476]

Elias didn’t run. [478]

He held the fairy ring to his temple and whispered the oldest word he knew for *remember*. [490]

The sky above the greenhouse groaned, the broken constellation knitting itself back together thread by thread, and for the first time in years, Elias Vey felt the weight of his own life press down on him, heavy and bright as a starfall. [520]

When the memory eater rose from the depths, it wore the face of a man Elias had once called friend. [534]

“You always did ask too many questions,” the thing said, its voice like waves dragging over glass. [546]

Elias smiled, the fairy ring crumbling to dust in his grip. [552]

“And you,” he replied, “always gave the wrong answers.” [560]
