The orchard hung like a broken chandelier over the ravine, its gnarled branches swaying in the storm’s aftermath, their fruit heavy with the scent of damp earth and something older. [30]

Lior knelt in the mud, fingers brushing the loam where the truffles should have been—where they *had* been, before the rains turned the soil to slurry and the empathy virus left the valley’s survivors too raw to lie, even to themselves. [65]

His satchel held only three blackened nuggets, their aroma sharp with desperation, and the antique glass eye wrapped in oilcloth, its iris flecked with gold leaf like a saint’s relic. [95]

He hadn’t stolen it. [98]

That was the problem. [101]

The eye had been pressed into his palm by a dying archivist in the ruined library, her voice a rasp: *"They’ll call it a cure. Don’t let them see it whole."* [125]

Lior’s fingers twitched—his tell, the one thing his body betrayed when his mouth couldn’t. [136]

The virus had stripped the world of artful deception, but it had also unspooled the threads of trust, leaving only this: if you could not lie, you learned to occlude. [155]

He tucked the eye deeper into the satchel, beneath the truffles, their musk strong enough to mask the glass’s unnatural weight. [173]

Above him, the orchard’s oldest tree groaned, its roots half-exposed where the storm had clawed the ravine’s wall. [186]

The textbooks had been wrong, of course. [191]

The ones that whispered of the eye’s power—a relic smuggled from a city that no longer existed, said to "restore" what the virus had burned away—had been scrawled in margins by hands that trembled with fever or faith. [225]

Lior had read them all in the dead of night, by candlelight that guttered like his hope. [238]

The eye didn’t cure. [241]

It *revealed*. [243]

And in a world where every glance carried the weight of unfiltered truth, revelation was a blade, not a balm. [255]

His sister’s voice echoed in his skull: *"We used to lie to be kind. Now kindness is the lie."* [268]

She had jumped from the ravine’s edge three weeks prior, her last words a scream of honesty he still couldn’t parse. [282]

Lior’s breath fogged in the cold. [286]

The truffles were for the warlord’s cook—a man who paid in silence, who didn’t ask why a forager with steady hands never met his gaze. [306]

The eye was for no one. [310]

He had spent a month learning the ravine’s rhythms, the way the mist curled at dawn, the way the orchard’s fruit fell not when ripe, but when the wind’s pitch hit a certain keening note. [335]

Pattern recognition was survival now. [339]

The warlord’s men would come at dusk, their boots crushing the brittle underbrush, their questions simple: *Where is the rest? What else do you hide?* [358]

Lior exhaled, slow. [361]

He reached into the satchel, not for the eye, but for the smallest truffle, its surface rough as a scar. [373]

He bit down. [375]

The flavor exploded—earth and rot and something like grief—and for a heartbeat, the world softened at the edges. [386]

A lie, but a gentle one. [389]

He spat the pulp into his palm, then smeared it over the glass eye’s lid, the musk thick enough to dull its gleam. [406]

Occlusion. [408]

Not hiding. [410]

Making it harder to see. [413]

The warlord’s men found him an hour later, his satchel open, his hands steady as he offered them the truffles, his voice even as he said, *"The storm took the rest."* [435]

They believed him. [437]

They always did. [439]

That night, beneath the orchard’s skeletal boughs, Lior pressed the eye into the ravine’s wet mouth, where the roots would swallow it whole by spring. [459]

The textbooks had been wrong about cures. [464]

But they’d been right about one thing: some truths were better buried. [472]

He climbed back up, his fingers leaving no marks on the crumbling earth, his breath even, his heart quiet. [488]

Above, the stars hung like pins in a black shroud, indifferent. [495]

Lior didn’t look back. [498]

The ravine kept its secrets. [501]

So did he. [503]
