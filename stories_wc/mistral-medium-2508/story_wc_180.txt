The quartz-eye mender knelt in the loam where the cathedral’s ribs still arched overhead, their fingers brushing the damp earth as if it were a pulse. [25]

Above them, apple boughs sagged with fruit so ripe it smelled like forgiveness, their roots tangled through the cracked marble like veins stitching wound to wound. [48]

Their daughter’s hair ribbon—frayed at the edges, the color of bruised twilight—was tied around a low branch, fluttering as if whispering secrets to the wind. [70]

It had been three years since the contract broke, the one that bound the mender’s hands to silence and their daughter’s voice to the choir of the old priests. [95]

The girl had left the ribbon behind on purpose, they knew; a taunt, a plea, a breadcrumb trail back to the wisdom they’d tried to drill into her like a nail into unyielding wood. [121]

“You always said vows were like leaves,” she’d snapped the last time they’d fought, her chin jutting out in that endearingly feisty way that made the mender’s chest ache. [148]

“They fall when they’re ready.” [151]

Now, the mender’s satchel—long forgotten in the rush of the breach—yawned open beside them, spilling its guts: a rusted trowel, a pouch of crushed quartz (for seeing what shouldn’t be seen), and the half-finished doll their daughter had abandoned at twelve, its stitches uneven as a heartbeat. [192]

Persist, the orchard seemed to hum, the way the cathedral’s ghosts might if they still had lungs. [204]

So the mender dug. [206]

Not for treasure, not for bones, but for the root their daughter had once sworn was shaped like a hand—her hand—clutching something just out of reach. [229]

The trowel struck stone, then something softer: a wooden box, its lid carved with the same spirals their daughter used to doodle in the margins of her hymnals. [253]

Inside, a single seed rested on a bed of dried petals, and a note in her jagged script: *Plant it where the light bends. Then ask me again why I left.* [278]

The mender’s fingers trembled. [281]

They remembered the day the priests had come, their contracts written on parchment thin as skin, their promises sweet as the apples no one was allowed to eat. [305]

Their daughter had been nine, already sharp enough to see the rot beneath the gilt, already stubborn enough to refuse the vial of ink. [325]

“Vows are deciduous,” the mender had whispered that night, pressing the ribbon into her palm. “Even the sturdiest ones. You’ll know when it’s time to let go.” [348]

They hadn’t known she’d take it literally. [353]

Now, the seed pulsed in their hand like a second heart. [359]

The mender stood, brushing dirt from their knees, and walked to where the afternoon sun slanted through the broken rose window, painting the air gold. [381]

They knelt again, pressed the seed into the soil, and whispered the question they’d been too proud to ask before: *“What did you see that I couldn’t?”* [405]

The first sprout broke the earth before the words faded, twisting upward like a finger pointing at the ribbon, still tangled in the branch. [426]

The mender laughed, sharp and sudden, because of course—her daughter had never been one for subtle answers. [443]

The orchard shivered. [445]

A wind, warm as breath, rustled the leaves into a chorus: *You taught me to read the cracks. Why didn’t you read mine?* [464]

The mender reached up, untied the ribbon, and bound it around their own wrist, the frayed edges biting just enough to remind them. [483]

Then they picked an apple—tart, imperfect, ripe—and took a bite. [492]

The contract was dust. [495]

The vow was not. [497]

Some things fell away so others could take root. [503]

The mender persisted. [505]

And for the first time in years, it wasn’t out of duty, but because the earth—and their daughter—had shown them how. [524]

They carried the satchel home, lighter now, its forgotten contents finally spent. [535]

The doll they left beneath the tree, its empty hands cradling the sprout like a promise. [547]

(They’d ask her about the stitches next time. [552]

If she’d let them.) [554] </story>
