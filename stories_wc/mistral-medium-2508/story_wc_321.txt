The ferry *Eidolon* cut through the black water like a blade through silk, its hull groaning with the weight of a thousand unseen passengers. [21]

Lira, the deckhand, hummed as she coiled a frayed rope, her calloused fingers working by muscle memory—she’d done this every night for seventeen years, or maybe seventeen minutes, depending on which timeline the grotto decided to honor. [50]

Her pocket buzzed, not with a phone but with the empty hourglass she carried, its sand long since slipped into some other when; she turned it over anyway, watching the void inside catch the spectral glow of the grotto’s bioluminescent algae. [85]

The radio on her belt crackled, a voice slicing through static: *"Lira, you’re drifting off-course—again."* [97]

She grinned, thumbing the transmit button. "Course is relative, Cap. You know the rules when clocks run sideways." [112]

Above them, the cavern’s ceiling pulsed with trapped starlight, constellations shifting like schools of fish, their patterns rewriting themselves mid-motion. [130]

That was the key, she knew—the patterns. The ferry didn’t vanish because it was lost; it vanished because it was *between*, threaded through the grooves of overlapping timelines like a needle through too many layers of fabric. [157]

A passenger—no, a *ghost* of a passenger—materialized at the rail, their edges flickering. "Is this the 7:15 to the mainland?" they asked, voice thin as paper. [178]

Lira wiped her hands on her oil-stained vest. "Depends on which mainland you’re headed to, friend. We’ve got three on the schedule tonight." [198]

The ghost’s face rippled, their memories tugging them toward two different docks at once. Lira didn’t blame them. [211]

She adjusted the ferry’s wheel, not to steer but to *align*, feeling the resistance of unseen currents—the pull of a timeline where the war never ended, the push of one where the grotto was just a myth. [238]

The hourglass grew heavy in her pocket. Empty, but not useless. It was a vacuum, hungry for the loose threads of time, and she’d spent years feeding it moments: the laugh of a child who wouldn’t be born in this version of the world, the last breath of a fisherman who’d drowned in another. [272]

The radio hissed. *"Lira, the grotto’s collapsing the route. We’ve got five minutes before the ferry unravels completely."* [290]

She didn’t panic. Fear was a luxury for people who believed in permanent things. [300]

Instead, she knelt and pressed the hourglass to the deck, whispering the names of the timelines she wanted to stitch together—*Maris-9, Veyra’s Dawn, the Hollow Dusk*—letting the glass drink the friction between them. [325]

The ferry shuddered. The water around them turned to liquid silver, reflecting not the grotto’s ceiling but a dozen different skies at once. [343]

A passenger screamed, but Lira just tightened her grip on the wheel. "Hold on, folks. We’re merging the lanes." [357]

The patterns in the starlight *snapped* into place, interlocking like gears, and for a heartbeat, the *Eidolon* was everywhere at once—arriving, departing, sinking, soaring. [376]

Then silence. The grotto exhaled. [379]

The ferry bobbed in calm water under a single, steady sky. The hourglass in Lira’s pocket was warm now, full of something that wasn’t sand but wasn’t nothing either. [399]

The radio crackled one last time. *"…Lira? You there?"* [405]

She plucked a starflower from the air—it hadn’t existed five minutes ago—and tucked it behind her ear. "Right where I’m supposed to be." [420]

The ghosts on deck blinked, their edges solidifying. One touched their own wrist, then gasped. "I remember *both* lives." [435]

Lira leaned against the rail, watching the grotto’s entrance seal itself behind them, the spectral glow fading to ordinary moonlight. [450]

Somewhere, a clock chimed midnight. Or maybe it chimed never. [458]

She turned the now-full hourglass over, but the sand didn’t fall. It *rose*, defying gravity, defying time, because some things—like ferries, like deckhands, like the space between one breath and the next—weren’t meant to be permanent. [495]

They were meant to be transient, resilient, and always, always moving. [504]

The *Eidolon*’s engine coughed to life. Lira grinned. "Next stop," she called, though no one asked, "the one after this one." [522]

The water rippled in agreement. The stars winked. And the ferry, which had never really been lost, vanished into the dark. [540]

(Exactly where it was supposed to be.) [544]
