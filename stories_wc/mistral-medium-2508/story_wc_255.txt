The glassblower’s courtyard was still warm from the phoenix’s passing, its embers flickering in the cracks between cobblestones like trapped fireflies. [23]

Elias sat cross-legged beside a potted fern, his fingers tracing the edges of its fronds—not for their shape, but for the way they trembled when he hummed. [43]

He was colorblind, but colors had never been the point. [50]

The reed tongue of a broken concertina lay on the stone beside him, its brass edge catching the low light, a gift from the old woman who’d traded it for a painting of her hands. [71]

*"You see what others miss,"* she’d said, though he’d never told her about the greyscale world behind his eyes. [85]

Elias arranged plants the way others wrote letters. [90]

A sprig of rosemary for *remember*, a snapped geranium stem for *urgent*, a loop of ivy to soften the blow. [102]

The glassblower’s daughter, Liora, had left a clay pot of basil by the kiln this morning—*I’m listening*. [115]

She didn’t know he’d been awake all night, pressing the reed tongue to his lips, coaxing out a sound like a sigh caught in a jar. [130]

The phoenix had risen at dawn, as it did every seventh year, and the town held its breath until the ashes settled. [145]

Elias didn’t fear the fire. [148]

He feared the silence after. [151]

Liora found him kneeling in the dirt, his palms pressed to a bed of crushed petals and thorned vines—a message he’d been composing for hours. [168]

*"You’re asking me something,"* she said, her voice rough from the smoke still curling through the air. [181]

He plucked a dandelion, its yellow lost on him but its shape unmistakable, and tucked it behind her ear. [196]

*"Awaken,"* he signed, then pointed to the kiln, where the glassblower’s latest piece—a vase with a hairline crack—cooled on the rack. [213]

Liora’s father called it ruined. [216]

Elias called it perfect. [219]

She understood. [221]

That evening, they sat on the courtyard’s low wall, passing the concertina between them, its wheeze more melody than discord. [236]

Elias didn’t need to see the way her cheeks flushed when she laughed; he felt it in the way her shoulder brushed his. [252]

The plants around them rustled—not from the wind, but from the old woman’s hands as she wove through the greenery, plucking a bloom here, a leaf there. [271]

*"You bartered well,"* she murmured, pressing a new reed tongue into Elias’s palm, this one unbroken. [283]

He didn’t ask what she’d taken in return. [288]

Some awakenings were worth any cost. [292]

Liora’s fingers found his in the dark, her touch as deliberate as the ivy climbing the courtyard trellis. [305]

*"Teach me the language,"* she whispered. [310]

Elias smiled. [312]

He reached for a wilting marigold—*yes*—and placed it in her hand. [320]

The phoenix’s ashes had settled by then, but the air still smelled of burning. [330]

Not destruction. [332]

Beginning. [333]

Liora blew into the concertina, and the note that emerged was bright, imperfect, and alive. [344]

Elias closed his eyes. [346]

For the first time, he didn’t need to see. [350]

The courtyard hummed with it—rosemary and geranium, ivy and basil, the crack in the vase catching the moonlight like a held breath. [365]

The old woman’s laughter drifted from the shadows, low and knowing. [373]

*"Now you owe me two paintings,"* she said. [379]

Elias grinned. [381]

He’d pay it gladly. [383]

The world was full of imperfections, and he’d spent a lifetime learning to love them. [393]

Liora’s hand squeezed his. [396]

*"What’s next?"* she signed. [399]

He plucked a thorn from the vine at their feet and pressed it into her palm—*patience*. [408]

Then he took the concertina and played the only song he knew by heart. [416]

The one that sounded like waking up. [420]

The glassblower’s courtyard had never been so alive. [426]

Not even when the phoenix burned. [429]

Liora leaned into him, her breath warm against his neck. [435]

*"Again,"* she said. [437]

Elias played. [439]

And the world, for once, made sense. [443]

The reed tongue vibrated between his fingers, a pulse, a promise. [450]

He’d spent years painting what he couldn’t see, but now he understood: beauty wasn’t in the colors. [463]

It was in the cracks. [466]

In the way Liora’s lips parted when she listened. [472]

In the old woman’s bargains, the phoenix’s rise, the concertina’s wheeze. [482]

In the basil and the ivy and the way the dandelion’s seeds took flight when the wind finally came. [495]

Elias set the instrument down and reached for Liora’s hand. [502]

*"Stay,"* he signed. [504]

She didn’t answer. [506]

She didn’t need to. [508]

The courtyard was already blooming around them. [514]
