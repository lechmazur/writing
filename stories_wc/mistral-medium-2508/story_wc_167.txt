The first light of dawn crept over Pearl Bay like a held breath, turning the water into a sheet of liquid silver. [16]
Elias, the harbor glazier, stood at the edge of the dock, his calloused fingers tracing the rim of a glass prism he’d spent the night polishing. [32]
It wasn’t for a window or a lantern—it was for the atrium at the bay’s heart, a domed pavilion of fractured light that only the fishermen and the gulls ever noticed. [56]
He’d built it years ago after his daughter asked why the mist made everything blur, as if the world were too tired to be sharp. [79]
The answer had come to him in the way the prism split dawn into quiet rainbows: *because some things are meant to be seen slowly.* [99]

The mist curled around his boots as he stepped onto the floating walkway, the wood groaning like an old man’s bones. [115]
Inside the atrium, the air smelled of salt and damp glass, the walls lined with hundreds of prisms he’d salvaged from shipwrecks and storm-tossed crates. [135]
They caught the pale light and scattered it into patterns that shifted with the tide, a silent language only he and the bay understood. [154]
Elias knelt by the central pool—a perfect circle of still water—and picked up a smooth stone from the pocket of his oilcloth apron. [175]
He’d chosen it yesterday for its weight, its unremarkable gray, the way it fit against his palm like a forgotten promise. [193]

The stone broke the surface with a sound like a sigh. [199]
Ripples spread, intersecting, dissolving into smaller rings that trembled against the atrium’s glass walls. [213]
Elias leaned closer, watching the way the water’s movement bent the refracted light into fleeting shapes—*noctilucent reckonings*, his daughter had called them once, before she left for the mainland. [238]
He read them like lines in a letter: the first ring, wide and slow, was the bay’s memory of last night’s storm; the second, jagged where the ripples collided, held the worry of the fishermen’s wives; the third, faintest of all, was the shape of his own breath, steady despite everything. [278]

The mist thickened, and for a moment, the atrium felt like the inside of a lung. [290]
Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the glass of the prism in his hand. [299]
He wasn’t praying. [301]
He was communing—the way he always did before the world shifted, before the first boats returned with their holds full or empty, before the day decided what it would take from them. [328]
The patterns in the water told him what the harbor already knew: the tide would be generous today, but the wind would turn by noon. [349]
A gull cried overhead, its wings cutting through the mist like a blade through silk. [362]

His daughter had once asked if the atrium was magic. [369]
Elias had laughed and said, *Only if you count paying attention.* [377]
But the truth was, he’d built it because he needed to believe the mundane could hold meaning—that a stone, a ripple, a beam of split light could be enough. [403]
The prism in his hand warmed. [406]
He pressed it against the glass wall, aligning it with the others, and the atrium flared with color, brief as a held note. [423]
The mist parted just long enough to reveal the first boat returning, its lantern still lit against the gray. [438]

Elias stepped back, his boots leaving damp prints on the walkway. [446]
The stone had sunk to the pool’s bottom, but the ripples lingered, ghostly and precise. [458]
He thought of his daughter’s last letter, the way she’d written *I miss the way the light moves there* between the lines about her new job and the city’s noise. [480]
The atrium’s glow pulsed once, like a heartbeat. [485]
By the time the fishermen tied their boats to the docks, the mist would have swallowed the colors again, and the harbor would forget what it had almost remembered. [510]
But Elias would know. [512]
He always did. [514]

The first crate of fish hit the dock with a wet thud, and the day began. [522]
Elias wiped his hands on his apron, the prism’s imprint still faint against his skin. [532]
The bay exhaled, the mist rose, and the world shifted—just as it always did—around the quiet certainty of the atrium’s light. [552]
He turned toward the sound of voices, already reaching for the next stone in his pocket. [565]
