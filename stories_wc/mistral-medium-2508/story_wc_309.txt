The spire had always been there, a jagged tooth of ice piercing the underbelly of the storm-wracked sky, but no one climbed it anymore—not since the great engines of creation had begun humming in the cities below, churning out art and poetry and even prayer at the touch of a button. [49]

Marlin the Unremarkable, as his tutors had dubbed him, was the exception, though not by choice. [60]
He’d been sent to the spire as a penance for failing his final examination at the Arcane Conservatory—again—for summoning a candle that refused to extinguish, its flame flickering with a stubborn, sacred glow. [83]
The deans called it a defect; Marlin called it *lingering luminance*, the way light clung like a memory to things the world had forgotten. [103]

His exile came with a single instruction: retrieve the keystone from the garden folly at the spire’s peak, a relic said to accommodate impossibilities, though no one could say what that meant. [127]
The climb was treacherous, the wind howling like a choir of disapproving mentors, but Marlin pressed on, his fingers numb, his robes stiff with frost. [144]
He wasn’t here for redemption. [147]
He was here because the candle’s flame had whispered to him in the dead of night, its voice like the crackle of old parchment: *"The sacred isn’t in the spectacle. It’s in the stub of wax that won’t let go."* [174]

At the summit, the folly waited—a crumbling archway wreathed in frostbloom, its keystone pulsing with a dull, insistent light. [188]
Marlin reached for it, but the moment his fingers brushed the stone, the world *shifted*. [198]
The ice beneath his boots dissolved into mist, and suddenly he was standing in a garden that shouldn’t exist: a pocket of summer trapped inside the spire’s heart, where flowers bloomed in colors that had no name, their petals humming with the same stubborn glow as his candle. [236]

A voice, dry as dead leaves, spoke from the archway: *"You’re late."* [244]
Marlin turned. [246]
An old woman—no, not old, just *unfinished*, her edges smudged like a sketch abandoned mid-stroke—leaned against the folly, her fingers working at the straps of a satchel woven from shadow and twine. [269]
"Everyone else took the stairs," she said, nodding toward the mist swirling at their feet. [280]
Mist walking. [282]
Of course. [283]
The spire had never been about the climb. [287]

"You’re the keeper," Marlin guessed. [291]
The woman smirked. [293]
"Keeper, gardener, last person who remembered how to *make* things instead of asking a machine to." [306]
She unstrapped the satchel and tossed it to him. [311]
Inside, the keystone throbbed like a heartbeat, its light spilling over his hands, revealing veins of gold in the ice, patterns in the frost—*meanings* he’d never noticed before. [332]

"You see it now, don’t you?" she asked. [338]
The sacred in the simple. [341]
Not in the grand spells or the flawless illusions, but in the crack in the teacup, the scrawl in the margin, the candle that wouldn’t quit. [357]
Marlin exhaled, his breath crystallizing into words: *"I think I always did."* [367]

The woman nodded toward the mist. [370]
"Take it back. [372]
They’ll call you a master now, but don’t let them fool you—mastery’s just another kind of forgetting." [383]
Marlin slung the satchel over his shoulder and stepped into the mist. [392]
The spire dissolved around him, but the keystone’s weight remained, a quiet insistence in his palm. [404]

When he returned to the Conservatory, the deans gasped at the light spilling from his hands, the way it painted the walls in hues they’d never classified. [423]
Marlin ignored their praise. [426]
Instead, he knelt, placed the keystone on the floor, and lit his candle beside it. [437]
The two lights met, then merged, casting shadows that moved like living things—imperfect, flickering, *alive*. [452]

One of the deans cleared his throat. [456]
"Explain the mechanism," he demanded. [459]
Marlin smiled. [461]
"Some things aren’t for explaining." [465]
He picked up his candle, its flame now tall and unruly, and walked out, leaving the keystone behind. [480]
Let them puzzle over it. [482]
Let them try to automate *that*. [485]

Outside, the first automated hymn of the evening began to play from the city’s speakers, smooth and hollow as a polished stone. [506]
Marlin cupped his hand around his candle’s flame and whispered, *"Louder."* [514]
The fire roared in answer. [517] </story>
