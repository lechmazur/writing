The city of Veyth hung suspended between the ribs of its own skyline, a labyrinth of canals carved into the rooftops of ancient towers, their waters black and slow as ink. [31]

Elspeth knelt at the edge of a crumbling parapet, her brush hovering over a half-finished sketch of a moth with wings like stained glass, its veins pulsing with the faintest bioluminescence. [60]

She was a natural history illustrator—or had been, before the moths began disappearing from their frames. [77]

The pendant at her throat, an infinity symbol wrought in tarnished silver, hummed against her collarbone whenever the city’s rhythm faltered, which was often. [99]

Veyth operated on borrowed time, its clocktowers wound by unseen hands, their gears sculpting the hours into uneven loops—a day might stretch into a week, or an hour collapse into a breath. [126]

Elspeth called it *interrupted cadence*, the way the city stuttered, the way echoes arrived before their sounds, the way her own reflection in the canal water sometimes moved independently, lips forming words she hadn’t yet spoken. [158]

She had come to the rooftops to find the place where echoes were born, a rumor whispered by the dockworkers who claimed to hear their own voices calling back from the future. [183]

The pendant had been her mother’s, a relic from the last time the city slept—a full, unbroken sleep, not the fitful dozing of a giant turning in its dreams. [205]

The giant, they said, was Veyth itself, its towers the bones of some slumbering titan, its canals the veins through which time leaked like slow blood. [226]

Elspeth dipped her brush into the water and painted a stroke along the moth’s wing, but the ink bled upward, defying gravity, pooling into the shape of a key. [248]

A voice, thin as paper, drifted from the canal below: *"You have to uncage it."* [258]

She leaned over the edge. [260]

A boy—no older than twelve—stood in a flat-bottomed boat, his oar trailing in the water like a lazy finger. [273]

His eyes were too old for his face. [276]

"You’re the one who’s been stealing time," she said. [281]

He grinned, teeth sharp as a clock’s hands. [286]

"Not stealing. [287]
Borrowing." [288]

The pendant grew warm against her skin. [291]

Elspeth knew the rules: time borrowed must be repaid, but the interest was always more than you could afford. [305]

The boy extended a hand, palm upturned. [309]

In it lay a moth, its wings folded like a secret. [314]

"Not that one," she whispered. [317]

This was the moth she’d sketched a hundred times—the one that had fluttered out of her journal three nights ago, its wings still wet with ink. [333]

The boy’s fingers curled around it. [337]

"Then find the echo before the giant wakes." [342]

She didn’t ask what would happen if the giant woke. [347]

She already knew. [349]

The canals would run backward. [351]

The towers would unbuild themselves. [353]

And the moths—the ones she’d spent years cataloging—would dissolve into the margins of her sketches, as if they’d never been real at all. [368]

Elspeth reached into her satchel and withdrew a glass jar, its lid etched with the same infinity symbol as her pendant. [382]

Inside, a pulse of light throbbed like a trapped heartbeat. [388]

The boy’s smile widened. [391]

"Clever girl." [393]

She hurled the jar into the canal. [396]

The water hissed, then stilled. [399]

For the first time in memory, the city held its breath. [404]

The echo arrived not as a sound, but as a silence—a perfect, hollow note that vibrated in her ribs. [415]

Elspeth plunged her hand into the canal and pulled out a thread of silver, slick and humming. [425]

It was the echo’s leash. [428]

She looped it around her wrist. [431]

The boy’s boat began to drift backward, the water rewinding around his oar. [439]

"Wait—" she started, but he was already unraveling, his edges blurring like ink in rain. [450]

The pendant burned cold. [453]

Elspeth wound the thread around her fingers and pulled. [458]

The city gasped. [460]

Somewhere, deep in the bones of the towers, the giant shifted, its nap disturbed but not broken. [472]

The moths returned. [474]

Not to her sketches, but to the air, their wings brushing her cheeks as they spiraled upward, a living storm of color and light. [490]

Elspeth exhaled. [492]

The echo’s leash dissolved into mist. [496]

In the distance, a clocktower chimed—not the hour, but the space between hours, the sound of time stretching thin. [514]

She tucked the pendant beneath her collar and picked up her brush. [521]

There was still work to do. [524]

The city was still dreaming. [527]

And the echoes—well. [529]

They were only just beginning to speak. [533]
