The first snowmelt had turned the earth soft, and beneath it, the bronze grotto hummed like a struck bell. [17]
Elira knelt in the damp, her fingers tracing the spiral grooves of the kerosene lamp burner—its brass throat blackened by years of soot and whispered secrets. [35]
She was a fractal weaver, though not by choice; the patterns came to her unbidden, branching through her bones whenever the weight of another’s sorrow pressed too close. [58]
Tonight, she had come to collect. [62]

The grotto’s walls shingled the silence into something tangible, a *shingled hush* that layered the air like sediment. [75]
Each breath she took settled into the cracks between the bronze plates, leaving her boundary-lessly trapped—not by walls, but by the echoes of what she carried. [94]
The lamp burner was her anchor, its flame the only thing that could calcify the burdens before they dissolved her. [112]

She struck a match. [115]
The light flickered, then steadied, casting her shadow long against the grotto’s curved ceiling. [123]
In the flame’s orientation, she saw them: the weights she’d gathered. [130]
A fisherman’s grief for his drowned daughter, thick as kelp. [136]
A blacksmith’s rage at his trembling hands, sharp as a misplaced chisel. [144]
A child’s fear of the dark, light as a moth’s wing but just as persistent. [153]
Each one had found her, and she had taken them in, weaving their shapes into the hollows of her ribs. [167]

The grotto exhaled. [169]
Starlight seeped through the fissures above, thin as needlework, and Elira tilted the lamp burner until the flame aligned with the cracks. [184]
This was the method: by orienting properly, the fire would pull the weights from her, rendering them brittle, ready to break. [199]
She began to sing, a wordless tune that vibrated in her chest like a whalebone harp. [211]
The hush deepened. [213]

The first burden calcified with a sound like ice fracturing. [220]
She watched the fisherman’s grief crumble into dust, then scatter. [227]
The blacksmith’s rage followed, flaking away like rust. [233]
But the child’s fear lingered, clinging to the flame’s edge. [240]
Elira leaned closer, her breath stirring the fire. [245]
*"You’re not mine to keep,"* she murmured. [249]

The grotto shuddered. [251]
A new weight pressed against her—heavier than the others, older. [258]
It was the grotto itself, its bronze plates groaning with the memory of every burden ever left here. [272]
Elira’s hands trembled. [274]
She had come to collect, but the grotto wanted to give back. [281]

The lamp burner’s flame twisted, stretching toward the ceiling. [287]
In its light, she saw them all: the thousands of weights she had calcified, now swirling like embers in an updraft. [303]
They had never truly left. [306]
They had become part of the hush, part of the grotto’s endless, shingled silence. [315]

Elira understood then. [317]
She was not the weaver. [319]
She was the loom. [321]

The realization should have terrified her, but the whalebone reverie of the grotto held her fast, its rhythm slow and inevitable as tides. [338]
She tilted the lamp burner one last time, letting the flame lick the bronze walls. [349]
The grotto sighed, and the weights dissolved into the starlight, their shapes unraveling into the night sky. [362]
For the first time, Elira felt the hush settle *inside* her, not as a trap, but as a cradle. [375]

When she left the grotto at dawn, the lamp burner was cold in her hands. [384]
Her shadow no longer stretched before her. [388]
It walked beside her, light as a held breath. [393]

Back in the village, the blacksmith would ask if she’d taken his rage. [403]
The fisherman would press a coin into her palm, eyes wet with something like gratitude. [413]
The child would sleep through the night, unafraid. [418]
And Elira would smile, though she carried nothing now but the quiet. [427]

That evening, she returned to the grotto. [432]
The bronze plates gleamed under the first stars, their shingled hush deeper than before. [443]
She set the lamp burner down and knelt, pressing her forehead to the cool metal. [453]
The grotto breathed her in. [456]

By the next snowmelt, the villagers would say she had vanished. [464]
But sometimes, when the wind was right, they swore they heard singing from the hills— [473]
a wordless tune, vibrating like a whalebone harp, carrying the weights of burdens they no longer remembered. [486]

The grotto kept its secrets. [489]
The lamp burner never went out. [492] </story>
