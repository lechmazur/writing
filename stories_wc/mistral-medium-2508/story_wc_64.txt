The chess clock ticked its last, the black king toppling as the cobalt silo exhaled a breath of damp earth and rust. [19]
Elias, the blithe cemetery gardener, wiped his hands on his apron, his fingers still warm from the soil he’d tenderly organized that evening—rows of marigolds and lamb’s ear, their roots whispering secrets to the dead. [45]
He shouldn’t have been playing chess at all, not with the moon so high and the silo’s iron ribs groaning like old bones, but the widow Hester had insisted, her voice a frayed thread pulled taut. [72]
*"You’ll see,"* she’d said, pressing the antique sovereign case into his palm, its brass clasp cold as a grave marker. [89]
Inside lay not coins, but a scrap of tapestry, its border stitched with knots so tight they seemed to resist the air itself. [105]

Elias carried the case to the silo’s edge, where the stars hung low enough to touch if he stood on his toes. [119]
The tapestry’s threads were the color of dried blood and forgotten violets, and when he held it to the light of his lantern, the knots *shifted*—not unraveling, but *breathing*, as if the weaver had trapped a sigh inside the stitches. [143]
Hester had called them *uncharted echoes*, the kind of thing that made the town’s priests cross themselves and the children hide under their beds. [160]
But Elias, who spoke to worms and dead things with equal kindness, only tilted his head and wondered what shape of intention could knot itself so deep into cloth. [180]

He began to untangle them by decoding the frayed threads in the tapestry’s border, his calloused fingers tracing the pattern like a blind man reading braille. [197]
The first knot loosened with a sound like a held breath released, and the silo’s shadows stretched longer, as if something inside them had leaned forward. [215]
The second knot came undone with a scent—wet stone and lavender, the perfume of the widow’s late husband, who’d drowned in the river with his pockets full of sovereigns and his mouth full of promises. [242]
Elias’s throat tightened. [245]
He knew that scent. [248]
He’d planted the man’s body beneath the weeping cherry, the one whose branches now tapped against the silo’s roof like impatient fingers. [264]

The third knot was different. [268]
It fought him, twisting back upon itself, and when it finally gave, a voice spilled out—not from the tapestry, but from the silo’s walls, a chorus of murmurs in languages Elias didn’t know but *felt*, like the pulse of roots in winter. [294]
*"You shouldn’t have dug where you weren’t asked,"* the voices sighed, and the lantern’s flame turned blue. [308]
Elias’s hands didn’t shake. [312]
He’d always known the dead were restless here, their intentions knotted into the land itself, into the way the marigolds leaned toward certain headstones and the way the silo’s door never quite latched. [338]
But this—this was a *shape* he could hold. [345]

The last knot was a noose of silver thread, and when he teased it apart, the tapestry’s border bled into the air, weaving itself into a figure: the widow Hester, younger, her hands pressed to her belly, her eyes wide with something worse than grief. [369]
Behind her, the river swirled black, and a man’s hand—her husband’s—reached from the water, not to pull her in, but to *push her away*. [385]
The sovereigns in his pockets weren’t for gambling. [390]
They were payment. [392]
For silence. [394]

The vision dissolved, leaving Elias with the weight of the case in his hands and the certain knowledge that the widow had never wanted the truth buried. [409]
She’d wanted it *unraveled*. [412]
The silo creaked, the stars above suddenly too bright, like eyes blinking open. [421]
Elias folded the tapestry back into the sovereign case, his blithe nature not dimmed but *deepened*, the way soil darkens when turned. [435]
He understood now why the dead whispered to him, why the earth gave up its secrets so easily beneath his hands. [449]
Intentions were just knots waiting to be named. [454]

Dawn would come soon, and with it, the widow’s knock at the gate. [461]
He would tell her what he’d seen—not as accusation, but as offering, the way he pressed seeds into the earth and trusted them to grow. [477]
The chessboard still sat between them, the black king fallen, the white queen standing alone. [488]
Elias reset the pieces, his fingers sure. [492]
The game wasn’t over. [495]
It had only just begun to make sense. [499]

Outside, the marigolds trembled, their petals curling inward like hands in prayer. [508]
The silo’s door, at last, clicked shut. [513]
