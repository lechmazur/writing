The first time Liora saw the arches, she thought they were ribs of a god the planet had swallowed whole. [20]

They floated above the orchards like silent sentinels, their stone curves casting long shadows over the groves where the fruit pulsed with starlight, ripe enough to split the sky. [42]

She had come to this world chasing rumors—whispers of a *nebula of respite*, a place where the weary could unspool their sorrows into the cosmos and leave lighter. [62]

But the orchard planet, Veyth, was not a sanctuary. [68]

Not yet. [70]

The soil remembered war. [73]

Liora knelt in the dirt, pressing her palm to a crack where the earth still hummed with old explosions, and that’s when she heard the ghost. [87]

*"You’re early,"* the voice said, not unkindly, as if she’d arrived for a meal rather than a haunting. [98]

She turned. [100]

A man—no, less than a man, more like a sketch of one—stood between the apple trees, his edges flickering like candlelight. [114]

His name was Kael, and he had died planting these groves, though he never said how. [124]

*"I’m here to help,"* he told her, and the strangest thing was how she believed him immediately, how his voice carried the weight of a vow already kept. [140]

Kael was the orchard’s memory, its altruistic ghost, the one who had spent decades coaxing life from the wreckage. [152]

He showed her the butterfly garden at the planet’s heart, where the wings of the insects shimmered like shattered moons. [165]

At its center hung a watering bell, its brass surface etched with names of those who had tended the soil before. [177]

*"Ring it,"* Kael said, *"and the arches will listen."* [184]

Liora hesitated. [186]

*"Why me?"* [188]

*"Because you’re the first stranger who didn’t ask what you’d get in return."* [197]

She struck the bell. [199]

The sound didn’t travel outward—it *unfolded*, like a bloom in reverse, and the floating arches trembled. [211]

That night, she dreamed of the nebula. [215]

It wasn’t a place but a *state*, a collective exhale, and Veyth could be its cradle if someone orchestrated the effort. [228]

When she woke, Kael was chalking a message onto the sidewalk outside her hut: *"Reexamine the cracks. That’s where the light gets in."* [243]

She followed his instructions. [246]

For weeks, she traced the fractures in the land, pressing her ear to the earth, listening for the echoes of what had been broken. [259]

Others came—drifters, refugees, a mechanic with oil-stained hands, a child who spoke in riddles. [272]

Kael met each of them the same way: *"You’re early."* [279]

And each time, they stayed. [282]

They repaired the irrigation channels, strung lanterns between the arches, taught the children to read the messages Kael left at dawn. [298]

The ghost never asked for thanks. [302]

He only ever said, *"Ring the bell when you’re ready."* [309]

The nebula of respite didn’t arrive all at once. [314]

It started in the way the fruit tasted sweeter, in how the butterfly garden became a pilgrimage site for the grieving. [327]

One evening, as Liora watched the arches hum in the twilight, Kael appeared beside her, more solid than before. [341]

*"You did it,"* she said. [344]

*"No,"* he corrected gently. *"We did. That’s how collective effort works."* [354]

She wanted to ask if he’d move on now, if the orchard’s peace had freed him. [365]

But the words stuck in her throat, because the truth was, she didn’t want him to go. [376]

Kael smiled, as if he’d heard her anyway. [381]

*"Some ghosts,"* he said, *"are just family who forgot to leave."* [390]

The next morning, the watering bell was warm to the touch. [396]

When Liora rang it, the sound carried not just through the orchard, but into the cracks of the cosmos itself. [410]

And for the first time in a long time, the universe breathed back. [417]

The strangers who had become family gathered under the arches, their hands brushing the soil, their voices weaving into the hum of the planet. [433]

Kael stood among them, no longer flickering, his presence as natural as the wind through the apple trees. [447]

Liora looked at the chalked messages on the sidewalk—faded now, but the words still clear—and understood. [459]

This was the nebula. [462]

Not a place to escape to, but a place to build. [468]

Not respite from the world, but respite *with* it. [474]

She picked up the chalk and wrote her own message, just as dawn broke over Veyth: *"We stay."* [487]

And the planet, at last, believed her. [492] </story>
