The last petal of the old rosebush spiraled to the cracked platform, settling beside a rusted rail like a surrender flag. [18]

Dr. Elias Veyne adjusted his spectacles, the lenses fogging in the damp air of the disused railway station, where ivy strangled the iron bones of forgotten industry. [39]

He wasn’t here for nostalgia—though the place reeked of it, thick as the mildew climbing the timetable boards—but for the truth, which had been buried beneath decades of *noble lies*. [65]

His gloved fingers traced the edge of the wooden crate he’d pried open moments before, its contents swaddled in oilcloth like a relic awaiting resurrection. [87]

Inside lay the *Codex of Saint Aldric*, its vellum pages brittle but unbroken, the first letter of its opening passage still glowing faintly: an illuminated **B**, its gold leaf catching the slanted light like a held breath. [117]

The letter was a lie. [121]

Not in its craftsmanship—no, the 12th-century scribe had been a master—but in its *purpose*. [133]

The Codex wasn’t a hymnal, as the Church had claimed for centuries, but a ledger: names, dates, payments from nobles to the abbey for "divine favor" in wars they’d already won. [155]

Elias had spent a decade chasing this, his fingers itching not for tenure or fame, but for the *recapture* of what had been stolen—not the book itself, but the truth it carried. [180]

A train whistle howled in the distance, though no trains ran here anymore; the sound was just the wind playing ghost engineer through the tunnels. [200]

He exhaled, emotionally rational as ever, though his pulse betrayed him. [208]

The lie had been *noble*, of course. [212]

The Church had called it protection—shielding the faithful from the cynicism of transactional faith. [223]

But Elias knew the cost of such protection: a world where men knelt to gilded frauds, where the weight of a single illuminated letter could tip the scales of history toward deception. [247]

He needed to *draw parallels*—not in some dusty lecture hall, but here, where the ivy’s creep mirrored the slow, suffocating spread of the lie. [266]

His phone buzzed. [268]

A message from the archivist who’d "misplaced" the Codex: *"They know you have it. They’re coming."* [283]

Elias didn’t panic. [285]

He photographed the ledger’s first page, the flash briefly turning the **B** into a sun, then tucked the phone into his coat. [303]

The footfalls came first—slow, deliberate—then the beam of a torch cutting through the gloom, illuminating the peeling *DANGER* signs like ironic commentary. [323]

"Dr. Veyne," a voice called, smooth as a confession booth’s curtain. [330]

Father Callahan stepped into the light, his cassock hem dark with damp, his smile the kind that belonged on a man who’d never doubted his own righteousness. [350]

"You always did have a knack for *rescuing* things that were better left buried." [359]

Elias closed the crate. [361]

"Truth isn’t something you bury, Father. It’s something you *tend*." [369]

Callahan’s gaze flickered to the rosebush, its branches bare now, its thorns sharp as the barbs in his next words. [384]

"That truth would unravel faith for thousands. Is your conscience so clean you’d burn the tapestry to find a single loose thread?" [406]

Elias touched the crate’s lid, feeling the ghost of the **B** against his fingertips. [415]

"No," he said. "But neither is yours." [419]

The torchlight wavered as Callahan’s radio crackled—police, called to retrieve a stolen artifact. [430]

Elias didn’t run. [432]

Instead, he opened his satchel and withdrew a sheaf of papers: copies of land deeds, wartime correspondence, modern bank transfers—all tied to the abbey’s "charitable" holdings. [454]

"Parallels," he said, laying them out like tarot cards. "The ledger wasn’t the first lie. Just the first one you couldn’t erase." [470]

Callahan’s face went slack. [472]

The police would arrive soon, but it no longer mattered. [477]

The truth wasn’t in the Codex alone—it was in the pattern, the unbroken line from then to now, from gilded **B** to backroom handshake. [496]

Elias smiled, not in triumph, but in quiet certainty. [502]

The rosebush had shed its last petal. [506]

The lie had lasted as long as it could. [509]

As the footsteps neared, he slipped the illuminated page’s photograph into his pocket, light as a promise, heavy as a key. [529]

Callahan lunged for the crate, but Elias was already stepping back, into the shadows where the ivy swallowed the past whole. [546]

Some things couldn’t be buried twice. [550]

He left the station as he’d found it—silent, crumbling, and finally, *honest*. [560]

The train tracks stretched ahead, leading nowhere and everywhere. [566]

Elias followed them into the dark. [570]
