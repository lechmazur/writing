The lighthouse keeper’s hands trembled as he folded the last fortune slip, the ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce. [15]

Every night after the island’s lone diner closed—after the last clatter of plates and the final slam of the screen door—he retreated to the tower’s brass-lined study, where the beam sliced through the dark like a blade. [40]

The locals called him *Old Chen*, though no one knew if that was his name or just the way he signed the fortunes: *Chen says: The tide will bring what you’ve already lost.* [65]

Tonight, the microdot film lay unspooled across his desk, its specs glowing faintly under the desk lamp—a schematics leak from the mainland’s black-site lab, slipped into his pocket by a fisherman who’d owed him a favor. [95]

Chen wasn’t a spy. [97]

But he *orchestrated*—not by pulling strings, but by directing the flow, the way his fortunes did: vague enough to fit any life, sharp enough to cut when the timing aligned. [122]

The film held instructions for a sonic weapon, one that could shatter glass—or bones—at a precise frequency. [136]

He dipped his brush into the inkwell, the same one his grandmother had used to write curses on joss paper, and began copying the specs onto a fresh slip in tiny, looping script. [*The hum you ignore will one day sing your name.*] [160]

Accidentally prophetic, that’s what the diner’s cook called his work, after her nephew vanished and she found his last fortune in his coat: *The sea takes what it’s owed, but not before you do.* [189]

Chen didn’t believe in fate. [192]

He believed in *open secrets*—truths hiding in plain sight, like the way the lighthouse’s Fresnel lens bent light into a warning, or how the island’s children knew to avoid the north cove at high tide, though no one ever said why. [223]

A knock at the door. [226]

The fisherman’s daughter stood there, her oilskin coat dripping saltwater, her fingers clutching a sealed envelope. “They’re coming for the film,” she said. [242]

Chen didn’t ask who. [245]

He took the envelope—inside, a single train ticket to a city he’d never heard of—and slid the microdot into her palm. “Give it to the man at the third stall in the morning market,” he said. [268]

“He’ll know what to do.” [271]

She hesitated. “What about you?” [274]

Chen smiled, unfolding the ticket. [277]

On the back, in his own handwriting, he’d already scrawled: *A door only opens after you’ve stopped knocking.* [290]

Upstairs, the beacon turned. [293]

He lit a stick of incense, the smoke curling like the question marks in his fortunes, and began packing his ink, his brushes, the last unsent slips. [*The key was in your pocket the whole time.*] [316]

Outside, the wind carried the sound of an outboard motor. [322]

Chen didn’t look. [325]

He knew how this worked—the way a fortune only made sense after the fact, the way a secret stayed open until someone decided to see it. [345]

The train would leave at dawn. [349]

He’d be on it, the lighthouse dark behind him for the first time in twenty years, its silence another kind of warning. [*You mistook the echo for the voice.*] [368]

The men in black coats would find the study empty, the desk bare, the last fortune slip tucked into the doorframe: *What you seek was never hidden.* [388]

On the train, Chen would press his forehead to the glass and watch the coastline shrink, the island becoming a smudge, then nothing. [407]

He wasn’t running. [410]

He was transposing life into a new key, the way you retuned a radio to catch a clearer signal, the way you rewrote a fortune so the next person who read it would finally understand. [435]

The ticket stub in his pocket read: *One way. No refunds.* [442]

Chen laughed, low and familiar, like the creak of the lighthouse stairs. [450]

Somewhere, a fisherman’s daughter was handing a stranger a slip of film. [459]

Somewhere, a cook was burning joss paper for her lost nephew. [466]

And somewhere, a new lighthouse keeper would sit down after last orders, dipping a brush into ink, writing the same old truths in a slightly different hand. [*The ending was always the beginning.*] [490]

Chen closed his eyes as the train pulled away, the rhythm of the tracks a pulse, a heartbeat, the steady turn of a lens cutting through the dark. [510]

The fortunes would keep coming. [513]

The secrets would stay open. [516]

And the tide, as always, would bring what was already lost. [523]
