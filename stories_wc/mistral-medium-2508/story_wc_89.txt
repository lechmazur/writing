The orchard had always bloomed under the silver gaze of a moon that never set, its petals unfurling like secrets whispered between stars. [25]
Liora moved through the rows of apple trees, her bare feet pressing into soil that hummed with the heartbeat of things older than memory, her hands calloused from years of coaxing beasts to trust her. [53]
She was a whisperer, though not by choice—beasts found her the way lost souls find lighthouses, drawn to the paradoxical steadiness of a woman who had spent a lifetime learning to be still while the world trembled around her. [92]

The phoenix had risen three nights prior, its fire painting the sky in hues of rebirth, and since then, the air carried the scent of rare spices—cinnamon like embers, cardamom like forgotten promises. [126]
Liora had buried her brother beneath the oldest tree, the one whose roots cradled bones older than their bloodline, and now she carried his last gift in her pocket: a fortune from a cookie, its edges frayed, its words *You will become what you seek*. [174]
She didn’t want to believe it. [178]

The first sign came at dusk, when the stag with the broken antlers pressed its muzzle into her palm and exhaled a breath that smelled of crushed saffron. [199]
“You shouldn’t be here,” she murmured, but the stag only stared, its dark eyes reflecting the moon’s eternal glow, and then it *spoke*—not in words, but in the language of shifting earth, of roots twisting toward light. [236]
*Conjure me back,* it seemed to say. [241]
Liora’s fingers twitched. [244]

She knew the stories: after the phoenix rises, the veil between what was and what could be grows thin, and those who grieve too fiercely risk unraveling the threads of their own shape. [273]
But her brother had been the one who believed in such things, who’d laughed as he told her how the spice merchants of the celestial bazaar traded in transformations, how a pinch of star-anise could unravel a curse, how clove could stitch a soul to a new skin. [312]
She had called it nonsense. [316]

Now, kneeling in the silvered grass, she crushed a pod of vanilla between her fingers and whispered his name. [332]
The air shimmered. [335]
The stag’s form wavered, its edges blurring like ink in rain, and for a heartbeat, she saw *him*—her brother’s grin, the scar above his brow from the time he’d climbed the orchard wall and fallen. [363]
Then the wind howled, and the vision dissolved, leaving only the scent of spices and the weight of the fortune in her pocket, mocking her. [384]

“You can’t just *take* him back,” she snapped at the moon, at the trees, at the silent, watching beasts. [399]
But the orchard had no answers, only the rustle of leaves that sounded like laughter, like sorrow, like the turning of a page in a book no one had written yet. [426]

The second time, she didn’t hesitate. [432]
She ground nutmeg into her palms, let the heat of it sear her skin, and *pulled*—not at the stag, but at the space where her brother’s absence lived, a hollow so vast it had its own gravity. [460]
The earth groaned. [463]
The stag collapsed into a heap of stardust, and from the dust rose a figure, tall and familiar and *wrong*, his edges flickering like candle flame, his voice when he spoke a chorus of echoes: *“Liora, you shouldn’t have.”* [498]

She reached for him. [501]
Her fingers passed through his wrist, and the contact burned, not with fire, but with the cold of deep water, the kind that pulls you under before you realize you’re drowning. [524]
“It’s not enough,” she choked out. [529]
He smiled, sad and knowing. *“It never is.”* [536]

The fortune in her pocket crumbled to ash. [541]
She understood then: the metamorphosis wasn’t his. [546]
It was hers. [548]

The beasts of the orchard gathered around her as she sank to her knees, their breath warm against her skin, their eyes reflecting not the moon, but something older, something that recognized the shape of her grief and found it beautiful. [580]
She had spent her life speaking to creatures who couldn’t answer back, but now she heard them—not with her ears, but with the part of her that had always been too porous, too willing to bleed for love. [610]
The spices on her skin glowed faintly, pulsing like a second heartbeat. [620]

When she stood again, the orchard held its breath. [626]
She was still Liora, but she was also the stag’s steadiness, the phoenix’s fire, the moon’s quiet witness. [642]
She was the bridge. [645]
And for the first time, she didn’t fight it. [650]
