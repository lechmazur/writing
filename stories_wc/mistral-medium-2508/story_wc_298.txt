The catacomb orchard breathed in the slow, damp sighs of the earth, its roots twisting like veins through the ribs of the forgotten. [20]

Liora knelt in the half-lit glow, her fingers brushing the soil where a burned tarot card lay half-buried—the Tower, its edges charred but the falling figures still screaming. [40]

She had come here, as always, to patch the holes in her soul, though the orchard’s keeper, Old Veyra, called it foolishness. [58]

“You trade too much,” Veyra had warned, her voice like dry leaves, but Liora only smiled, her touch fiercely gentle as she pressed the card deeper into the loam. [79]

The orchard thrived on bartered destinies. [83]

Every root that split a skull, every blossom that drank from a pelvis’s hollow, was fed by what people gave up—memories, names, the sharp edges of their regrets. [104]

Liora had given hers freely, reckless in her idealism, believing she could outrun the weight of what she’d lost. [120]

Tonight, she would trammel fate itself. [125]

The method required precision: inlaying meaning everywhere, into the curve of a root, the whisper of a draft, the way her breath fogged the air like a promise. [143]

She pulled a silver needle from her sleeve, its thread spun from her own hair, and began to stitch the card’s ashes into the bark of the nearest tree. [163]

The roots shivered. [165]

A voice, neither Veyra’s nor her own, slithered from the dark: *“You would mend what should stay broken?”* [177]

Liora didn’t flinch. “I would mend *me*,” she said, and the orchard held its breath. [188]

The trees had rules. [190]

They took only what was offered, but they gave back in kind—fruit that tasted like forgiveness, shadows that moved like old lovers. [208]

She had once bartered her mother’s lullaby for a single night without dreams. [216]

Now, she wanted more. [219]

The needle flashed in the dusky resolve of the corridor’s glow as she pierced the card’s last embers into the tree’s heart. [235]

Pain lanced up her arm, sweet and bright as the first light of dawn, and the roots *pulled*. [248]

Not at her flesh, but at the thing she’d hidden deepest—the name of the child she’d failed to save. [261]

The orchard *knew*. [263]

It always did. [265]

Liora gasped, but she didn’t resist. [269]

This was the trade: her guilt for a future unshackled. [275]

The roots coiled around her wrist, not to trap, but to *weave*, threading her sorrow into the orchard’s endless tapestry. [292]

When they released her, the air smelled of rain on dry earth, and the burned card was gone—replaced by a single white flower, petals soft as a child’s sigh. [314]

Veyra found her there at dawn, curled against the tree, her hands empty but her eyes, for the first time, quiet. [330]

“You gave it *everything*,” the old woman accused, but Liora only shook her head. [341]

“No,” she whispered. “I took something back.” [347]

The orchard hummed around them, its bones and blossoms heavy with the weight of all who’d come before, all who’d dared to barter. [365]

Liora stood, brushing dirt from her knees, and for the first time, the holes in her soul didn’t ache. [379]

They were still there—patchwork and uneven—but they were *hers* now, not gaps to fill, but scars to carry. [395]

Veyra watched her go, the white flower already wilting in her grip. [403]

“Reckless girl,” she muttered, but there was no bite in it, only the tired affection of someone who’d seen too many idealists break against the world. [424]

Liora didn’t look back. [427]

The corridors behind her glowed half-lit and endless, and ahead, the world waited—still broken, still beautiful, but hers to walk without dragging the past behind her. [447]

She would return. [449]

The orchard always called its debtors home. [453]

But today, she would answer on her own terms. [459]

The wind carried the scent of turning soil and distant storms as she stepped into the light, her fingers no longer trembling, her heart no longer a cage. [480]

Somewhere, a root split another bone. [485]

Somewhere, a new trade began. [489]

And Liora walked on, lighter than she’d been in years, the weight of her choices finally her own to bear. [504]

The orchard exhaled behind her, satisfied. [508]

The dead slept easier with their bargains kept. [513]

And the living? [515]

Well. [516]

The living learned to walk with their scars. [521]

Liora smiled, just a little, as the first raindrop hit her palm—clean, cold, and hers. [534]

The past was in the earth now. [538]

The future was in the walking. [541]

She took another step. [544]

Then another. [546]

The orchard watched, and waited, and was content. [552]

Somewhere, a tarot card began to burn. [558] </story>
