The dome still stood, though the tower beyond it had crumbled like a child’s sandcastle under a boot. [18]

Liora knelt in the damp soil, her fingers pressing a desert rose’s thorns against her palm until the pain grounded her. [32]
The airship’s wreckage had scattered across the dunes outside, but here, beneath the glass, the only remnant was a single sandbag—its canvas frayed, its weight long spilled. [54]
She traced the stitching: *Quiet, like the wind before dawn*, the words her father had engraved into every tool he carried. [72]

He’d been a bounty hunter once, but she’d only ever known him as the man who taught roses to listen. [87]
"Plants remember," he’d say, pressing his calloused hands into the earth, inculcating the roots with the same stubborn patience he’d once used to track fugitives. [111]
Now, with the tower’s fall, the world outside was a scream of dust and fleeing crowds, but here, the roses bloomed in senselessly perceptive silence. [134]

Liora exhaled, slow, and sheathed her knife into the soil beside a sapling. [144]
The blade had never tasted blood—she’d spent years sharpening it only to carve her father’s phrases into bark, turning weapons into whispers. [164]
The sandbag’s scrap lay heavy in her lap, its rough edges biting her thighs like a reprimand. [178]
*You were supposed to leave*, her father’s voice hissed in her memory, but the roses had needed her more. [193]

Outside, the wind howled, but the dome held, its glass panes warmed by the same sun that had once baked the desert into submission. [211]
She pressed the sandbag’s fabric to her lips, tasting salt and rust and the ghost of her father’s sweat. [227]
The tower’s collapse had been inevitable—everyone knew that—but the roses didn’t. [240]
They stretched toward the light, unaware of the chaos beyond the glass, and that was the point. [253]

Liora stood, brushing dirt from her knees, and walked to the dome’s edge where the sandbag had landed. [267]
Its weight had cracked a pane, a thin fissure spiderwebbing outward, but the structure held. [280]
She pressed her palm to the glass, feeling the vibration of the world outside—shouts, running feet, the groan of metal settling into ruin. [301]
Here, though, the only sound was the roses breathing. [309]

She tore a strip from the sandbag’s canvas and tied it around the sapling’s stem, knotting it tight. [325]
The words *engraved quiet* would hold it steady when the winds came. [334]
Her father had chased storms; she would anchor them. [339]

The knife gleamed as she pulled it free, its edge catching the light like a promise. [350]
She didn’t need it for violence. [353]
She needed it to carve *continuity* into the bark, to remind the roses—and herself—that some things outlasted towers. [371]

The dome’s air smelled of earth and blooms, thick with the scent of things that refused to break. [385]
Liora closed her eyes and listened: the creak of stems, the sigh of petals unfurling, the steady *thrum* of roots drinking deep. [403]
Outside, the world burned. [406]
Inside, she tended the quiet. [409]

When the last rose budded, she would take the sandbag’s scrap and stitch it into the dome’s seam, a patch against the storm. [428]
The tower was dust. [431]
The roses were not. [434]

She knelt again, this time pressing her ear to the earth, and waited for the plants to tell her what came next. [450]
They always did. [452]

The wind rattled the glass, but the fissure didn’t spread. [460]
Neither did she. [462]

By dawn, the desert would be ash, but the dome would stand, and the roses would bloom, and Liora would be there, sheathed in the quiet her father had taught her to keep. [490]
The world had fallen. [493]
She would weave it back together, one thorn at a time. [499] </story>
