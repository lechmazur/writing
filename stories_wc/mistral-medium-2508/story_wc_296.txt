The lake had always been a wound, its waters black and still until the druid arrived—then it began to *swirl*. [20]

Eldrin knelt at the shore, his fingers tracing the damp earth where the last villager had vanished, their scream swallowed by the orchard’s hungry roots. [42]

He was no healer, not really; he was a finder, a man who unraveled what others lost, though he never spoke of how the things he found often wished to stay hidden. [70]

The seed in his palm pulsed, warm as a heartbeat, its thorned husk promising hunger. [83]

He’d stolen it from the warlock’s garden after the trick failed—the one meant to freeze the lake’s curse into silence, to turn its howling into glass. [105]

Instead, the vortex had *laughed*. [110]

Eldrin’s breath fogged in the unnatural cold, the air thick with the scent of rotting blossoms. [122]

The orchard wasn’t just growing; it was *remembering*. [128]

Each tree bore fruit that whispered secrets when split open, but the druid had learned long ago that some truths were better left frozen. [147]

His motivation wasn’t mercy. [152]

He wanted to see what the lake’s mirror refused to show—the face of the thing that had taken his brother, the one the villagers called a drowning but Eldrin knew was a *choosing*. [178]

The seed’s hunger coiled against his skin, a living promise: *feed me, and I’ll unearth what you seek*. [195]

He pressed it into the soil where the water’s pull was strongest, where the swirls formed perfect, expanding circles like ripples from a stone no one had thrown. [218]

The first shoot broke through the frost within heartbeats, its vines lashing like whips, splitting the air with a sound like tearing silk. [236]

Eldrin didn’t flinch. [239]

War demanded stillness, and he had long since mastered the art of not bending—until now. [252]

The plant’s maw yawned wide, petals peeling back to reveal rows of needle-teeth, and the lake *answered*. [266]

A figure rose from the depths, not drowned but *waiting*, its form shifting between boy and beast, its eyes two chips of the lake’s own frozen core. [287]

*"You found me,"* it said, voice like cracking ice. [294]

Eldrin’s hands were steady. [298]

"I didn’t come for you," he lied. [303]

The thing that wore his brother’s face smiled. [309]

The vines struck, wrapping around its limbs, and the lake *screamed*—not in pain, but in recognition, as the plant began to *digest* the confession the water had held for years. [333]

The truth unfurled in Eldrin’s mind like a blade: his brother hadn’t been taken. [345]

He’d *jumped*. [347]

The lake didn’t drown its victims. [351]

It *kept* them. [353]

And the warlock’s failed trick hadn’t been meant to freeze the curse—it had been meant to *break* it, to force the lake to vomit up its hoarded souls. [374]

Eldrin exhaled, his breath no longer misting. [380]

The plant withered, its work done, its hunger sated by a truth too heavy for mirrors. [393]

The vortex stilled. [396]

The orchard’s whispers died. [399]

Only the druid remained, kneeling in the mud, finally unbent, the weight of knowing pressing him flatter than any blade could. [418]

He reached into the water one last time. [424]

What he pulled out wasn’t a body. [429]

It was a key—rusted, but warm. [434]

The lake had kept more than souls. [439]

It had kept *choices*. [442]

Eldrin pocketed the key and stood. [447]

Some things, once found, couldn’t be lost again. [454]

Others shouldn’t be. [457]

He turned his back on the lake and walked into the trees, where the next missing thing waited. [470]

(And if the water began to swirl once more behind him, he didn’t look. [480]

Some confessions were better left frozen.) [484]

The key burned against his thigh with every step. [490]

He would unearth its purpose soon. [494]

But not today. [496]

Today, the war was over. [499]

Today, he would let the silence win. [504]

(Even if silence, like the lake, was just another kind of hunger.) [514]

The first snowflake landed on his shoulder as he crossed the ridge, the cold a familiar weight. [528]

Eldrin brushed it away. [531]

Some things didn’t need to be found to be known. [539]

Some things were better lost forever. [545]

He kept walking. [548]

The snow followed. [551]

The key stayed warm. [554]

And the lake, far behind him, began to hum. [561]

(He pretended not to hear.) [565]

The next missing thing wouldn’t wait. [570]

Neither would he. [573]

The world was full of wounds. [577]

Eldrin was just the man who decided which ones to stitch shut—and which to let bleed. [590]
