The artist had forgotten what faces looked like. [9]

Not the shapes—the curves of cheekbones, the slope of noses—but the way they *held* meaning, the way a glance could split a life into before and after. [27]
Her hands remembered, though. [31]
They traced the air as if sketching invisible lines, her fingers twitching with the muscle memory of a thousand failed portraits. [45]
The guild had called her *fractally precise*—a joke, really, because no matter how deep she carved the details, the likeness always slipped, like trying to catch smoke in a net. [65]

She worked now in the hollow of the old oak, where the scholar’s guild had once stored their forbidden texts. [80]
The library was a wound in the tree, its shelves carved into the living wood, the air thick with the scent of sap and mildew. [95]
A demolition crew would arrive at dawn to burn it all, to erase the guild’s last secrets before the city could. [111]
But she had one night. [114]

The coin was her key. [117]
A relic from the guild’s first archivist, passed down in whispers, its surface worn smooth except for the faintest indentations—so shallow they might’ve been breaths pressed into metal. [137]
She ran her thumb over them now, feeling the pattern: a spiral, then a series of dots, a language of pressure. [153]
The book safe was hidden in the spine of the oldest tome, its lock a puzzle of touch, not sight. [168]
She pressed the coin into the leather, following the indentations like a blind cartographer. [181]

A click. [183]
The safe opened. [185]
Inside lay not gold or maps, but a single instruction, scrawled on vellum so thin it might dissolve if she breathed wrong: *"Mirror the sky inside walls."* [206]

She understood. [208]
The guild hadn’t been hoarding knowledge—they’d been trying to *contain* it, to build a place where the infinite could be held, just for a moment. [228]
Like her portraits. [230]
Like the way she’d spent a lifetime chasing the exact angle of a smile, only to watch it blur under her knife. [246]

The tree groaned around her, settling into its final hours. [254]
She took up her tools. [257]
If the guild had failed, perhaps she could succeed—not with faces, but with this: a ceiling of fractured glass, each pane cut to refract the dawn’s first light into the hollow. [278]
She worked by touch, her blades scoring the wood with channels to guide the beams, her hands steady as a surgeon’s. [295]
The indentations on the coin became her blueprint, its spiral the path of the sun’s arc. [309]

By the time the first hammer struck the outer walls, she was done. [318]
The crew’s shouts were distant, muffled by the oak’s dying flesh. [327]
She stepped back. [329]
Light poured in—not through the door, but from above, a river of gold fracturing against the glass, painting the shelves in shifting constellations. [348]
For a breath, the library was the sky. [354]

Then the beams gave way. [357]
She didn’t run. [359]
As the ceiling collapsed, she watched the light scatter, the illusion shatter—proof, at last, of the limit she’d spent her life denying. [378]
Some things couldn’t be held. [381]
Not faces. [383]
Not the sky. [385]
Not the way the guild’s archivist had pressed his despair into a coin, hoping someone, someday, would understand. [404]

The fire took the oak before the crew could. [410]
She stood outside the ashes, her palms empty, her fingers finally still. [420]
The demolition foreman tossed her a charred fragment—the coin, warped but intact. [432]
She turned it over. [435]
The indentations were gone. [438]

She smiled. [440]
For the first time, she didn’t try to remember what it looked like. [449]

The wind carried the last of the embers into the sky. [456]
Somewhere, a new guild would begin. [460]
Somewhere, another artist would pick up a knife. [466]
She let the coin fall. [469]
The earth swallowed it without a sound. [474]

That night, she dreamed of a library with no walls. [482]
In the dream, she walked through its shelves, her hands no longer searching for what couldn’t be kept. [496]
The books were blank. [498]
The sky wrote itself across their pages. [502]

She woke before dawn, her pillow damp with sap. [510]
On her worktable, a single sheet of paper waited, untouched. [520]
She reached for her knife—then stopped. [525]
Instead, she dipped a brush into ink the color of the hush before demolition. [536]
She painted nothing. [538]
She painted the space between breaths, the shape of a question with no answer. [550]

When the ink dried, she hung it on the wall. [558]
It was the first portrait that ever felt true. [565]

Outside, the city began to wake. [570]
She did not. [572]
For the first time, she let the limits hold her. [579]

The light through the window was the color of a sky that had finally learned to stay. [590]
