The birch bark scroll unraveled like a sigh, its edges frayed from decades of being clutched in sweaty palms. [18]

Elias had carved the runes himself—or would carve them, or had already carved them, depending on which version of him you asked. [34]

The mountain ranger cabin creaked around him, its timber bones groaning under the weight of too many winters, too many versions of the same man hunched over the same desk. [55]

He wasn’t supposed to be here, not *now*—the grave outside, half-buried in pine needles, bore his name and a date three years past. [75]

But time had never been linear for Elias, not since the dreams started documenting him instead of the other way around. [91]

Feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs, the kind that made him jealous of his past selves—the one who’d first tasted blackberry wine in this cabin, the one who’d laughed while sketching constellations on the ceiling. [115]

That Elias had been whole. [117]

This one was a patchwork of stolen moments, a chronicler who’d outlived his own story. [127]

The scroll’s ink shimmered, not from magic but from the sheer weight of revision—each layer a desperate attempt to distill chaos into something legible. [143]

He traced a finger over the glyph for *soar*, the one he’d pressed into the bark after dreaming he’d flown over these peaks, wings made of memory and static. [163]

(He hadn’t. [165]
Not really. [166]
But the dream had been so *convincing*.) [169]

Outside, the wind howled like a thing that knew him, that had watched him age backward and forward in the same damn chair. [186]

Elias exhaled, fogging the windowpane. [189]

The problem wasn’t the grave. [192]
The problem was how *tidily* it summed him up: *Elias Veyne, 1983–2021, Keeper of Forgotten Hours*. [205]

No mention of the nights he’d spent stitching together fragments of other lives, or the way his hands trembled when he tried to write his own ending. [223]

A floorboard groaned. [225]

He wasn’t alone. [227]

The cabin’s previous tenant—*another* him, this one younger, eyes still bright with the delusion of control—stood in the doorway, clutching an identical scroll. [243]

“You’re early,” Younger Elias accused. [246]

“You’re late,” Older Elias corrected. [249]

They both knew the truth: time was a wound, and they were just the scabs picking at it. [260]

The younger version’s fingers twitched toward the scroll. [264]

“Did you ever fly?” he asked, voice raw. [268]

Older Elias almost lied. [271]
Almost said *yes*, almost let the myth live. [276]

Instead, he pressed the bark into the boy’s palm, ink-side up. [283]

“Distill it better than I did.” [286]

The wind outside screamed. [288]

Or maybe it was laughter. [290]

Younger Elias’s pupils dilated as the runes rearranged themselves, the glyph for *soar* bleeding into *fall*, then *drown*, then something unpronounceable. [308]

“It’s not supposed to do that,” the boy whispered. [313]

“It’s not supposed to do *anything*,” Older Elias said. [319]

The scroll was just birch and ink and the desperate need to make sense of the senseless. [330]

Like the grave. [332]
Like the dreams. [333]
Like the way Elias kept returning to this cabin, this desk, this exact slant of dying light, as if repetition could sand the edges off regret. [352]

Younger Elias’s nails dug crescents into the bark. [357]

“What if I don’t want to be the chronicler?” [361]

Older Elias smiled, slow and jagged. [364]

“Then be the one who burns the scrolls.” [368]

The cabin held its breath. [370]

Outside, the pines swayed like they were counting down. [375]

Three. [376]
Two. [377]
One. [378]

Younger Elias lit a match. [380]

The birch bark curled, blackened, then *screamed*—a sound like a thousand voices realizing too late they’d been misquoted. [395]

Older Elias didn’t flinch. [397]

He’d heard it before. [399]
He’d *be* that scream, someday. [402]

The fire guttered. [404]

Ash settled on the desk like the first snow of a winter that would never end. [412]

Younger Elias was gone. [414]

(Or never here. [416]
Or both.) [417]

Older Elias picked up the charred remains of the scroll, the glyphs now illegible, free. [426]

For the first time in years, his hands didn’t tremble. [431]

He stepped outside, the mountain air sharp as a rebuke. [437]

The grave was empty. [439]

Of course it was. [441]

Elias tilted his head back, let the wind scour his throat raw. [447]

Somewhere, a past self was still jealous. [451]

Somewhere, a future one was already dead. [455]

And here, now, he— [457]

Soared. [458] </story>
