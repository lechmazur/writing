The garden had always been frozen, but the mist was new—a slow breath exhaling from the earth itself, curling around the skeletal trees like a second skin. [23]

Lyssa crouched between the blackened roots of an oak, her fingers tracing the frost-etched spine of a book she’d salvaged from the ruins of the library’s east wing, the one the cultists had burned. [48]

She wasn’t supposed to read them, the books. [54]

Her job was to guard them, to keep the knowledge from leaking into the wrong hands—hands like the ones that had left the pendant half-buried in the thawing soil, its tarnished silver catching the sickly dawn like a winking eye. [82]

She picked it up, turned it over. [86]

The symbol carved into its face was a spiral eating itself, the same mark the cultists had scrawled on the library doors before they came with their torches and their chanting about *the other side of light*. [112]

Lyssa’s teeth ached. [115]

She hadn’t slept in—well, she couldn’t remember. [121]

Time had gone slippery since the fire, since the walls between here and *there* had started to thin, like parchment left too long in the rain. [137]

She pressed the pendant to her sternum and felt it hum, not with warmth but with a kind of hungry cold, the same cold that lived in the spaces between stars. [156]

*They want to go home,* she thought, and the realization settled in her chest like a stone. [168]

Not the cultists—the books. [171]

The books were dimensionally homesick, whispering in the dark about a place where light didn’t cast shadows, where words didn’t need pages to exist. [185]

She’d heard them for years, a low murmur beneath the creak of shelves and the sigh of turning leaves, but now they were shouting. [202]

Lyssa tucked the pendant into her pocket and waited. [207]

Waiting was what she did best. [211]

She’d spent a lifetime waiting for the library to decide if she was keeper or prisoner, for the mist to lift, for the cultists to return—or worse, for them *not* to. [230]

The garden shifted. [232]

Not the wind, not the mist—something deeper, the way a held breath finally breaks. [240]

A figure stood at the edge of the frost, neither man nor woman but something stretched between, their edges blurring like ink in water. [255]

“You’ve been holding my key,” they said, and their voice was the sound of a page turning in an empty room. [268]

Lyssa didn’t answer. [270]

She’d learned long ago that silence was the only language the uncertain understood. [280]

The figure stepped closer, their feet not touching the ground so much as *unfolding* from it, like roots reversing. [295]

“They’re afraid,” they murmured, nodding toward the library’s skeletal remains. [304]

“Afraid of what?” Lyssa asked, though she already knew. [311]

“Of being read.” [313]

The pendant in her pocket grew heavier. [316]

She thought of the books, their spines cracked with longing, their words crawling toward the edges of the pages like ants toward sugar. [332]

They didn’t want to be preserved. [335]

They wanted to be *released*. [337]

The figure extended a hand, their fingers too long, too jointed, like a spider learning to weave. [350]

“Give it back,” they said, “and I’ll show you the boundaries of light.” [360]

Lyssa hesitated. [362]

The library had been her cage, her purpose, her only company—but cages were just things you outgrew, and purposes could curdle into prisons. [380]

She pulled the pendant free and placed it in the figure’s palm. [388]

The moment it touched their skin, the mist *inhaled*. [393]

The garden didn’t unfold. [395]

It *unraveled*, the frost melting upward, the trees shedding their bark like old clothes, the ground beneath her feet dissolving into something that wasn’t ground at all but a vast, breathing page. [420]

Lyssa didn’t scream. [422]

She laughed, because the terror was familiar, because uncertainty had been her only friend for so long that finally meeting it face-to-face felt like coming home. [445]

The figure—no, the *librarian*, she realized, the first and the last—smiled with a mouth full of missing teeth. [458]

“Now,” they whispered, “we read each other.” [462]

The light that swallowed them wasn’t bright. [466]

It was *thirsty*. [468]

And for the first time in her life, Lyssa let herself be drunk. [474]

When she woke—if she woke—she would tell the books they were free. [482]

But for now, she slept through the veil, and the veil slept through her, and the garden, the library, the cultists, the pendant—all of it—was just a story she was finally brave enough to close. [510]

The last thing she felt was the weight of words lifting from her bones, one by one, like birds. [522]

The first thing she saw was the other side of light. [528]

It looked exactly like darkness, but softer. [533]

Like a friend. [535] </story>
