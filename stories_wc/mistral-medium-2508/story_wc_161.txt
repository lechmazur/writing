The attic of *Holloway’s Rare Books* smelled of yellowed glue and the ghost of pipe smoke, a scent that clung to Elias like a second skin. [19]
He had spent seven years training courier pigeons in the rafters, their coos the only sound that didn’t make him flinch since the fire. [35]
The birds were his paper trail—each flight logged in ledgers with ink the color of dried roses, their routes memorized like the lyrics he could no longer sing. [56]
His hands, steady now only when measuring grain or adjusting a harness, trembled as he unfolded the letter from Marseille. [75]
*"Found it. Not for sale, but for you. Meet me at the docks. —L."* [84]
Tucked inside was a sliver of black rock, a chip of the Mars meteorite he’d read about in a 1923 almanac, its edges sharp enough to draw blood. [104]
Elias pressed it to his palm and felt the weight of something older than memory. [113]

The skylight above cast a square of pale light onto the floorboards, dust motes swirling in currents he’d learned to read like sheet music. [128]
He balanced the meteorite on his fingertip, watching the particles shift as if directed by an unseen conductor. [141]
If he mapped their patterns correctly, he could predict the wind’s mood for the pigeons’ flight—one wrong calculation, and the birds would scatter like notes from a broken record. [163]
Luca had been the one to teach him that trick, back when Elias still called himself a composer and not a man who flinched at silence. [182]
*"Trust the chaos,"* Luca had said, laughing, before the fire took his voice too. [192]

The attic door creaked open below. [195]
Elias pocketed the meteorite as Madame Holloway’s cane tapped up the stairs, her perfume—bergamot and mothballs—announcing her before she spoke. [213]
*"You’re late with the ledgers again,"* she said, but her eyes lingered on the pigeon perched on his shoulder, its feathers ruffled like crumpled sheet music. [232]
*"They’re not just numbers to me,"* he admitted, tracing the bird’s wing with a finger. [243]
*"No,"* she sighed. *"They’re the only thing you’ve let yourself keep."* [252]
He wanted to tell her about the meteorite, about Luca’s letter, about the way the dust still danced like it did the night the opera house burned. [270]
Instead, he balanced the ledger on his knee and lied: *"I’ll have them by morning."* [279]

That night, he lit a candle and pinned Luca’s letter to the wall beside a map of pigeon routes, the meteorite chip glinting like a misplaced star. [296]
The attic had become his confessional, its slanted walls holding the echoes of songs he’d written for a man who’d called him *"maestro"* before calling him *"liar."* [318]
Elias had reinvented himself here, trading arpeggios for flight patterns, but the meteorite was a relic from the life he’d tried to burn away. [337]
He placed it on the windowsill, where the moonlight caught its jagged edge, and whispered a route to the pigeon on his wrist. [354]
*"Find him,"* he said. *"Bring him back."* [359]

The bird took flight, wings cutting through the dust-mote constellations, and for the first time in years, Elias didn’t flinch at the silence that followed. [378]
He stayed awake, charting the swirls of dust like a man reading tea leaves, waiting for the flutter of wings that would tell him whether trust was something you could train for. [400]
By dawn, the ledgers were finished, the meteorite warm in his pocket, and the attic smelled less like smoke and more like the sea. [418]
Madame Holloway would scold him for the ink smudges on his cuffs, but when the pigeon returned with a scrap of sheet music tied to its leg—*"For the next lesson,"* scrawled in Luca’s hand—Elias let himself hum. [445]
The notes were wrong, his voice rusty, but the dust swirled in time, and for a moment, the attic held the shape of a song instead of its absence. [465]
He tucked the music into the almanac, beside the meteorite, and smiled at the ledger’s blank margin. [476]
Some paper trails were meant to be rewritten. [480]
Some echoes, preserved. [482]
He picked up his pen. [484]
