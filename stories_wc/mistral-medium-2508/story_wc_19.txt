The child had spent twelve years buried in the bunker’s curved ribs, where the air tasted like rust and the walls exhaled slow, damp breaths. [24]
Their father called it safety, but safety was just another word for *shrank*—the way their lungs did when the steel door sealed, the way their name (whispered only in dreams) curled inward like a dying fern. [50]
The only thing that didn’t shrink was the doll. [56]

It was porcelain, no larger than a thumbnail, its painted smile a crack in the dark. [65]
Their father had found it in the ruins of a church bell tower, wedged between two ribs of a melted steeple, and though he never spoke of where he’d been, he pressed it into the child’s palm and said, *“For the quiet you carry.”* [95]
The child didn’t know what that meant then, but they learned: the doll was a key. [106]

Every silence had a flavor. [109]
The bunker’s was coppery and thick, like licking a battery. [115]
The doll’s silence, though—when they cupped it to their ear—was different: cool, expanding, the way frost tastes before it burns. [128]
They began to collect them. [131]

The first time gravity inverted, the child was ten. [137]
The bunker’s ceiling became a yawning pit, and their father roared at them to *stay down*, but the child had already pressed their fingertips to the metal grate above their cot, feeling the world tilt like a held breath. [160]
Through the slats, they saw it: the xenial trellis, a lattice of bone-white vines knitted between the clouds, swaying as if underwater. [175]
It lasted an hour. [177]
An hour where the rules bent, where the bunker’s weight became a feather, where the child could—if they dared—*sprout*. [190]

They learned the method by accident. [193]
The doll, when held just so, would hum a frequency that made their skin prickle, their edges blur. [203]
If they limited their exposure—three breaths in, two out—the hum would coil around their ribs and *lift*. [215]
Not fly. [216]
*Sprout*. [217]
Tendrils of something intangibly tangible would unfurl from their wrists, their ankles, anchoring to the trellis like roots to soil. [228]

The second inversion, they climbed. [231]
The trellis was warm, alive, its vines pulsing with a silence that tasted of honey and lightning. [240]
They pressed their cheek to a knot in the lattice and heard the doll’s voice for the first time—not in their ear, but in their teeth, vibrating up through their skull: *“You are the hinge.”* [260]
They didn’t understand. [262]
But they returned. [263]

Their father found the vines in their hair. [267]
“You’ve been *outside*,” he hissed, his hands shaking as he plucked the silver threads from their scalp. [276]
The child said nothing. [278]
They’d stolen a silence that tasted like his fear—sour, metallic—and they swallowed it whole. [287]

The third inversion, the trellis was different. [291]
The vines had thickened, their edges gilded with something that wasn’t light but *hush*, a sheen that muted sound into texture. [305]
The child walked until they found the source: a bloom the size of their torso, its petals folded around a core of perfect, throbbing quiet. [319]
The doll’s voice came again, louder now, urgent: *“Take it. The bunker is a coffin. You are the lock.”* [331]

They reached in. [333]
The silence inside the bloom was the flavor of a held note, the moment before a scream, the shape of their mother’s name. [345]
It filled their mouth like wine. [348]
When they pulled their hand free, their palm was stitched with gold, the threads writhing like embers. [358]

Gravity righted itself as they descended. [362]
The bunker door was ajar. [364]
Their father sat inside, his back against the wall, his breath coming in wet, uneven gasps. [373]
“They’re coming,” he said. [375]
“Who?” [376]
He didn’t answer. [377]
His silence was the one flavor the child had never tasted before: empty. [384]

The doll’s voice was a knife in their ear: *“Now you choose.”* [389]
The child pressed their gilded palm to the bunker wall. [393]
The metal groaned, then *unfolded*, petals of steel peeling back to reveal the sky—a bruised, inverted dome, the trellis waiting. [408]
Their father screamed. [410]
The child didn’t look back. [412]

They sprouted one last time. [415]
The trellis embraced them, the hush wrapping around their bones like a second skin. [422]
Below, the bunker collapsed into itself, a sigh of rust and dust. [430]
The child climbed higher, collecting the flavors of the wind, the clouds, the doll’s final whisper: *“You were never the lock. You were the door.”* [448]

At the trellis’s peak, they plucked a vine and bit down. [454]
The silence that bloomed in their mouth was the taste of beginning. [459]
