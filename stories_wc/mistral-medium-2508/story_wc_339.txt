The library of the *SS Athene* had been underwater for seventy-three years when Liora first saw the snow globe resting on the warped mahogany desk. [30]

It was untouched by corrosion, its glass smooth as the day it was sealed, the tiny blizzard inside still swirling lazily when she nudged it with a gloved finger. [50]

She had come here—not for salvage, but for answers—after the sonar ping that wasn’t a whale or a wreck, but the unmistakable silhouette of Earhart’s Electra, wedged in a trench two miles below. [80]

The discovery should have been triumphant, but the plane’s cockpit held only a single, waterlogged notebook, its pages fused into a brittle block except for the last one, where Amelia had written, in careful script: *The horizon isn’t a line. It’s a threshold.* [110]

Liora was quietly analytic by nature, a woman who dissected problems by untangling threads until the knot surrendered its shape. [128]

This was why she sat now in the *Athene*’s drowned library, where books had bloated into pulpy sculptures and the brass reading lamps still cradled ghosts of light, turning the snow globe in her hands. [155]

The globe’s scene was a lighthouse, its beam frozen mid-sweep, the tiny keeper a faceless smudge on the porch. [168]

She noted the way the snowfall inside moved counterclockwise, defying the current’s pull outside the porthole where a school of bioluminescent fish flickered like fallen stars. [185]

It was wrong. [187]

Not the physics of the globe—those were simple, sealed—but the physics of *letting go*. [196]

Amelia had written about thresholds, but the notebook’s margins held sketches of this very lighthouse, its coordinates scrawled beneath: a place that didn’t exist on any pre-war map. [215]

Liora’s breath fogged the glass as she pressed her forehead against the globe, the cold a sharp contrast to the cloying pressure of the dive suit. [233]

She had spent her career chasing last transmissions—the final bursts of radio static from doomed expeditions, the half-erased logbooks of ships that vanished into the Bermudas. [252]

Each one a plea, a confession, a hand reaching through time to say: *This is where I stopped understanding.* [265]

The snow globe’s base bore an inscription: *For A, who knew the cost of light.* [275]

A gift, then. [277]

Not from Amelia—her handwriting was all sharp angles, impatience—but from someone who had loved her enough to warn her. [290]

Liora set the globe down and traced the desk’s grain, where ink had bled into the wood like old tears. [302]

The *Athene* had been a research vessel before the war, its library stocked with texts on quantum entanglement and the bending of spacetime. [317]

Someone here had known what Amelia was chasing: not a flight, but a fold. [327]

A way to step through the horizon’s threshold and never come back. [335]

The snow globe’s snow began to fall upward. [339]

Liora didn’t startle. [341]

She noted the shift in gravity, the way the lighthouse’s beam now pulsed like a heartbeat, and understood at last what Amelia had been willing to lose. [355]

The cost of light wasn’t the burning. [359]

It was the shadow left behind. [362]

She tucked the notebook into her suit’s breast pocket, beside the photograph of her sister—another threshold she’d never crossed—and left the snow globe on the desk. [380]

The *Athene*’s hull groaned as she kicked toward the surface, the weight of the water pressing her deeper into the silence. [395]

Above her, the Electra’s wing glinted in the submersible’s floodlights, its aluminum skin pocked with holes that weren’t from rust or depth, but from something passing *through*. [415]

Liora didn’t look back. [418]

Some transmissions weren’t meant to be answered. [422]

She surfaced into a storm, the waves clawing at the sky, and when the crew pulled her aboard, she was smiling. [435]

"Not a word," she said, peeling off her gloves, the notebook safe against her ribs. [444]

They wouldn’t have understood anyway. [447]

That night, in her bunk, she dreamed of the lighthouse keeper stepping into the beam, his silhouette dissolving like sugar in tea. [460]

When she woke, the snow in the globe—still on the desk, still in her mind—was falling sideways. [472]

Liora closed her eyes and let the motion of the ship rock her, the horizon outside her porthole blurring into a single, unbroken line. [488]

She would file her report in the morning: *No significant findings. Proceed to next site.* [499]

The lie settled into her like sediment. [503]

Some things were heavier than truth. [507]

She thought of Amelia, of the sister she’d buried, of all the hands that had reached for thresholds and been pulled under by the weight of what they carried. [525]

The snow globe’s light flickered once, then steadied. [531]

Liora exhaled, long and slow, and for the first time in years, she let go. [540]

Not of the grief. [543]

Not of the questions. [546]

But of the need to know where the falling ended. [551]

Outside, the storm broke. [554]

The sea, finally, was quiet. [557]
