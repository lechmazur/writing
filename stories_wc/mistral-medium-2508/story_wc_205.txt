The asteroid *Lachrymae* hung in the void like a forgotten jewel, its baroque spires carved from the same black stone that once cradled the Republic of the Hourglass—a civilization that had measured time not in ticks, but in visible threads, unspooling from the wrists of its citizens until the day the threads snapped. [65]

Elias Veyra, last surviving architect of the failed *Chronos Revolt*, stood in the asteroid’s hollowed-out cathedral, where the air still hummed with the ghost of chants that had once demanded time be severed from the hands of the elite. [108] His fingers traced the edge of a crystal vase shard—all that remained of the *Vessel of Unwinding*, a relic his comrades had shattered in their final act of defiance, believing its destruction would freeze the ruling class in an eternal present. [157] It hadn’t. [159] Instead, time had become a tangled, glowing web, draping the asteroid in strands thick as rope, pulsing with the memories of a people who had tried to burn the future and failed. [189]

Elias was a poet before he was a revolutionary, and the failure of the revolt had left him with a hunger not for vengeance, but for *revision*. [207] If he could not undo the past, he would reimagine it—reshape the civilization’s legacy into something less brittle, less broken. [227] The dispute with the off-world archaeologists had begun when they declared the Republic a "failed experiment in temporal anarchy," their scans reducing its ruins to data points, its people to footnotes. [256] Elias had spent a decade devising counter-theories, but words were not enough. [266] He needed proof. [268]

The shard in his palm was the key. [272] The vase had not merely held time—it had *refracted* it, bending moments like light through crystal. [285] If he could reconstruct even a fragment of its lattice, he could force the archaeologists to see what they dismissed: a civilization that had not feared time’s visibility, but had *worshipped* it, weaving their lives into its fabric. [318] The storm outside the cathedral’s cracked dome was a rare one, its winds carrying charged particles that made the time-strands glow like embers. [344] Elias moved through the chambers, covering every mirror with sheets of irradiated silk—a method stolen from the old priestesses, who believed storms could splinter reflections into alternate selves. [376] He did not fear fragments. [379] He *collected* them. [381]

By the third hour, the shard hummed against his wrist, warm as a pulse. [391] The archaeologists’ lead scholar, Dr. Taelis, found him kneeling before the altar where the vase had once stood, the air above it rippling like heat off desert stone. [418] "You’re tampering with a dead culture," Taelis accused, her voice sharp with the certainty of someone who had never loved a lost thing. [438] Elias did not look up. [441] "No," he said. [443] "I’m letting it speak." [445]

The shard fractured further in his grip, and the time-strands around them *twisted*, knitting the cathedral’s ruins back into wholeness for the space of three breaths. [465] The murals on the walls bled color; the shattered stained glass reassembled itself into a mosaic of faces—farmers, weavers, children—all staring out with the same burnished sorrow Elias had carried since the revolt’s end. [492] Taelis gasped, her datapad slipping from her fingers. [499] "This isn’t possible," she whispered. [502]

Elias smiled, the weight in his chest lighter than it had been in years. [512] "It isn’t history," he corrected. [515] "It’s poetry." [517]

When the vision dissolved, the shard was dust, and the mirrors remained covered. [527] But the dispute was over. [530] The archaeologists would leave with their scans and their theories, but they would carry something else, too—the uneasy knowledge that some civilizations could not be excavated, only *remembered*. [560]

Elias stayed behind, pressing his palm to the altar where the vase had been. [570] The storm raged on, and for the first time in decades, he did not mind the sight of time. [582] It was beautiful, after all. [586] And it was his. [588] </story>
