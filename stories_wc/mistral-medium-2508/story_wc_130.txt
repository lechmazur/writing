The conjurer arrived at the cavern orchard just as the last drop fell from the stalactites, a slow, silver pulse in the dark. [20]

His fingers traced the chipped patterns on the mosaic stepping stone—each fracture a variable, each color a coefficient in an equation he couldn’t solve. [42]

The orchard had once hummed with life, its fruit swollen on vines that drank from the mineral-rich drips, but now it held only silence, the kind that settles like sediment. [68]

He’d come to understand the mathematics of emotion, to map grief the way others mapped constellations—by connecting what remained. [88]

In his satchel, the taxidermist’s glass eyes caught the dim glow of bioluminescent lichen, twin moons reflecting a truth he avoided: one was clouded, the other clear. [111]

His wife had left them on the windowsill the morning she vanished, her note a single line: *"Some things can’t be preserved."* [130]

The conjurer knelt, pressing his palm to the damp earth where her favorite saplings had withered. [141]

He’d been gently inventive once—crafting charms that coaxed laughter from stone, spells that softened the edges of memory. [158]

But ambiguity had no formula. [162]

The glass eyes dovetailed into the mosaic’s gaps, their irregular edges locking like puzzle pieces into the stone’s fractures. [178]

A breath of wind stirred the cavern, though there were no tunnels to carry it. [188]

The clear eye caught the light first, casting a prism across the dead branches, and for a heartbeat, the orchard remembered green. [206]

The conjurer whispered the incantation he’d spent years refining—not to resurrect, but to *ask*. [218]

The stalactites answered in droplets, their rhythm syncopated, a Morse code of loss and almost-understanding. [232]

The clouded eye wept first, a single tear that dissolved a patch of lichen into phosphorescent mist. [245]

The mist curled around his wrists, cool and questioning, as if emotion itself were a variable waiting to be solved. [259]

He thought of his wife’s hands, how they’d moved when she braided his hair—efficient, but never hurried. [273]

The prism expanded, painting the cavern walls in hues that had no name, colors that existed only in the space between missing and found. [292]

A fruit split open on the vine, its pulp black and glistening, and from it spilled a sound—not a voice, but a vibration, the harmonic of a question left unanswered. [314]

The conjurer pressed his forehead to the stepping stone, the glass eyes digging into his skin like tiny, insistent truths. [330]

He had spent a lifetime chasing precision, but ambiguity was the only constant: the way the orchard had thrived in darkness, the way his wife had loved him despite his silences. [355]

The mist thickened, swirling into shapes that almost formed her face, almost spoke her name. [368]

He reached for it, and the illusion dissolved, leaving only the damp imprint of his fingers on the air. [380]

Above him, the stalactites resumed their slow weeping, the orchestra of a patient earth. [392]

The conjurer exhaled, his breath fogging the clear eye before it, too, clouded over. [403]

He understood then: some equations weren’t meant to balance. [410]

Some losses were too ambiguous to mourn, too vast to name—like the orchard’s silence, like the way light bent through glass and came out fractured but still, somehow, whole. [435]

He gathered the eyes and slipped them into his pocket, their weight familiar now, a counterbalance to the hollow in his chest. [452]

As he stepped from the cavern, the mosaic’s chipped patterns glowed faintly behind him, a proof left unsolved. [468]

The moon hung low, a pale juror watching him emerge, his hands empty but his satchel lighter, as if he’d left something behind that wasn’t his to keep. [490]

Back in his workshop, he would sketch the orchard’s silence in ink, the droplets as notes on a staff, the glass eyes as rests. [510]

He would call it *"The Algebra of Almost."* [515]

And when the ink bled, as it always did, he would let it. [521]

Some things couldn’t be preserved. [525]

But they could be *remembered*—not as they were, but as they *might have been*, had the variables aligned. [540]

The conjurer smiled, just slightly, at the ceiling where the moonlight pooled like a question he’d stopped needing to answer. [560]

Outside, the first bird of dawn mistook the cavern’s breath for wind and sang anyway. [572]

He listened until the note dissolved, as all things did, into the quiet mathematics of the possible. [588]
