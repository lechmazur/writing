The first frost had settled over the city when Liora noticed the bread. [12]

It sat on the windowsill of the abandoned tea house, its crust still golden despite the years since the bakery on Maple Lane had vanished overnight—no note, no debt, no explanation, just an empty storefront where flour once dusted the air like snow. [42]

She reached out, fingers hovering, because Liora had always been the one who noticed when the ordinary tilted just slightly askew: the way her neighbor’s laugh had sharpened over winter, how the palace courtyard’s vines now curled *toward* the moon, not away. [78]

The bread was warm. [81]

Impossible, but there it was, steam rising in the gray dawn as she broke it open, the scent of yeast and wild honey unspooling like a memory she couldn’t place. [101]

She carried it inside, where the tea house’s copper kettle still whispered over a fire no one had lit. [113]

The others wouldn’t understand. [116]

Her brother had called her *heuristically gentle* once, after she spent a month replanting the palace’s cracked flagstones with mint and thyme, just to see if the guards would pause to crush a leaf between their fingers. [141]

They never did. [143]

But the bread—this was different. [146]

Liora knelt in the overgrown courtyard, where the last of the sparrows had flown south weeks ago, leaving only the wind to rustle the paper lanterns strung between the skeletal trees. [168]

She pressed the crumbs into the soil, not as offering, but as question. [176]

The city had spent years uncloaking its wounds: the bakery’s disappearance, the prince’s quiet exile, the way the river now ran backward on Tuesdays. [195]

No one asked why. [197]

They adjusted. [198]

That was the creeping horror—not the strangeness itself, but how swiftly it became normal, how the absence of answers could feel like absolution if you squinted. [218]

The first green shoot broke through the dirt at midnight. [224]

By morning, the courtyard was a riot of wheat, tall and heavy-headed, swaying where the palace’s fountain had once stood. [238]

Liora didn’t tell the others. [241]

Instead, she baked. [243]

The oven in the tea house’s kitchen, cold for decades, roared to life when she lit it with a match and a whispered guess. [259]

The loaves emerged perfect, their crusts scored with patterns she didn’t remember drawing. [269]

She left them on windowsills across the city, where the vanished bakery’s regulars still set out coins on the anniversary of its closing. [285]

The first man who bit into one wept. [289]

Not from taste, but recognition—his mother’s recipe, he swore, though she’d died when he was ten. [304]

The second found a locket in her slice, engraved with a name she’d never heard but knew was hers. [319]

By the third day, the palace guards had abandoned their posts, kneeling in the wheat to press their foreheads to the earth. [337]

Liora watched from the tea house’s roof as the city, for the first time in years, *stopped adjusting*. [350]

The prince returned at dusk, his boots caked in mud from the reversed river. [358]

He didn’t speak. [360]

She handed him a loaf, still warm. [363]

He ate. [364]

And then—because the sacred had always been here, in the crumbs and the cracks and the quiet refusal to look away—he began to weep. [380]

Liora didn’t ask what it tasted like. [385]

Some absolutions were too tenuous for words. [389]

She simply took his hand and led him into the wheat, where the bread would keep rising, where the ordinary had finally, mercifully, *uncloaked* itself. [410]

The next morning, the bakery’s sign reappeared over Maple Lane, its letters freshly painted. [421]

No one mentioned its absence. [424]

They just bought their daily loaves, and for the first time in years, the coins in their pockets felt like enough. [441]
