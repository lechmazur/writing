The mountain weather station clung to the ridge like a half-healed scar, its iron ribs groaning under the weight of the wind. [21]

Liora, the station’s fault-tolerant oracle, pressed her palm against the frost-laced window, watching the storm unspool itself across the valley below. [38] She had spent three days burning with fever, her visions reduced to static and the taste of copper, but now the heat had broken, leaving her hollowed out—clear-eyed, perilously so. [64] The others called her *unshakable*, but they didn’t see the way her hands trembled when the barometer’s needle wavered, or how she flinched at the sound of ice shearing from the eaves. [98] She was only fault-tolerant because she had learned to live in the margins, where the weight of what she *didn’t* say could never capsize the world. [125]

Beneath her cot, half-hidden under a stack of yellowed ledgers, lay the botanical illustration she’d smudged with charcoal the night the fever took her. [146] It was supposed to be a study of *Aconitum napellus*—monk’s hood, wolf’s bane—a plant that thrived in the cracks between certainty and poison. [168] But her feverish fingers had blurred the lines, the petals bleeding into the stems, the roots twisting into something like a question mark. [187] She hadn’t meant to deface it. [190] Or perhaps she had. [192]

The station’s radio crackled, a voice from the lowland observatory asking for her forecast. [203] She glanced at the barometer again: the pressure was falling, but not sharply. [212] *A slow unraveling*, she thought. [215] She could tell them the storm would hold off until dawn, or she could tell them the truth—that the air smelled like ozone and old blood, that the wind carried the weight of something unsaid. [237] But truths were heavy things to swallow, and heavier still to regurgitate. [247]

Liora traced the smudged illustration with her thumb, the paper soft as a pulse. [258] The margins were where things breathed. [262] Where the station’s logs didn’t record the way the ravens gathered before a death, or how the needle on the hygrometer stuttered when she lied. [285] She had spent years occupying those margins, letting the world believe her certainties were absolute, when in fact they swayed like grass under a held breath. [309]

Outside, the wind shifted, carrying the scent of wet stone and something greener, sharper. [323] She exhaled, her breath fogging the glass. [328] The fever had scoured her clean, but not empty. [334] There was a truth lodged in her ribs, a pebble of it, smooth and cold: the storm wouldn’t break at dawn. [349] It would break *now*. [351] And it would take the station with it. [355]

She could warn them. [357] She could grab the radio, shout into the static, let her voice crack with the weight of what she knew. [371] Or she could let the storm come, let it peel back the roof and scatter the ledgers like dead leaves, let it prove that even an oracle could be wrong. [394] That certainties were just things you held until they slipped through your fingers. [404]

Liora picked up the illustration and held it to the light. [411] The smudges looked like wings. [414]

She set it down in the center of the table, where the lantern’s glow could find it. [424] Then she walked to the door and stepped into the storm, letting the wind fill her lungs, her mouth, her silence. [438] The weight in her ribs dissolved like salt in water. [444]

Below, in the valley, the observatory’s radio hummed with static, waiting. [453] The needle on the barometer dipped once, decisively, then stilled. [461] The ledgers would record the storm’s arrival as sudden, inevitable. [469] No one would mention the smudge of charcoal on the table, or the way the oracle’s footprints vanished into the snow. [486] Some truths were only visible from the margins. [491]

And some were meant to be swallowed whole. [496]

The ravens took flight as the first lightning split the sky, their wings black against the aurora’s sorrowful glow. [514] Liora didn’t look back. [517] The mountain had always been her witness, her confessor. [523] Now, at last, it would be her answer. [529]

The wind carried her name away before she could hear it. [537] Or perhaps she had never said it at all. [543] </story>
