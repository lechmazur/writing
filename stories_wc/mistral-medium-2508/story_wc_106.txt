The emerald station glowed under the last breath of golden sunset, its brass rails humming with the weight of trains that had carried secrets for centuries. [22]

Liora moved like a shadow with a gilded edge, her fingers brushing the framed portraits in the grand hall—each one stolen not for gold, but for the way the light caught a subject’s unguarded breath, the flicker of a moment too bright to be real. [50]

She wasn’t a thief by trade, but by obsession: she collected illuminated moments, those slices of time where fate leaned close enough to whisper. [68]

Tonight’s target was different. [71]

The portrait wasn’t hung—it was *guarded*, locked in a glass case beneath a jar of captured moonbeams, their silver glow pulsing like a slow heartbeat. [86]

The stationmaster, a gaunt man with a ledger of debts and a fondness for orchids, had boasted about it over cardamom tea: *"A thief couldn’t take it even if they wanted to. The lock’s key is a code, and the code is in the flowers."* [118]

Liora had laughed, because of course it was. [123]

She’d spent three nights watching the stationmaster arrange his blooms—white lilies for silence, blood-red poppies for warning, a single black dahlia to mark the hour the last train would leave before the moon rose full. [147]

Quietly savvy, that was how she survived: not by forcing doors, but by listening to the creak of their hinges. [160]

The jar of moonbeams threw fractured light across the case as she knelt, her blade slipping between the petals of a wilting peony—the stationmaster’s mistake, his vanity. [178]

He’d reused last week’s arrangement, and Liora had memorized the shifts: *poppy left, dahlia tilted, three stems crossed*. [190]

The lock clicked. [192]

Inside the case, the portrait wasn’t a face at all—it was a mirror, but not the kind that reflected. [203]

It *reinterpreted*. [205]

Her own image stared back, but older, wreathed in a light that wasn’t sunset or moonbeam, something older and hungrier. [216]

The stationmaster’s voice cut through the hush: *"You’re not here to steal. You’re here to listen."* [227]

She turned. [229]

He stood in the doorway, a pistol loose in his grip, his other hand cradling a fresh black dahlia—*the real key*. [241]

*"That mirror shows the moment your luck runs out,"* he said, *"and yours is… imminent."* [253]

Liora exhaled. [255]

She’d pressed her ear against destiny’s door her whole life, but she’d never expected it to *answer*. [266]

The moonbeams in the jar flared, casting the station in liquid silver, and for the first time, she saw the truth: the portraits she’d stolen weren’t moments. [282]

They were *countdowns*. [284]

The stationmaster’s orchids wilted as the last train whistle screamed into the night, the sound bending like a blade. [295]

Liora reached for the jar. [298]

If luck was fleeting, then so was time—and if time could be stolen, so could fate. [309]

Her fingers closed around the glass. [313]

The moonbeams inside *moved*, twisting into shapes: a train pulling away, a door slamming shut, a flower arrangement collapsing into dust. [329]

*"You don’t understand,"* the stationmaster whispered, but his voice was already fading, dissolved by the light. [342]

Liora didn’t need to. [345]

She hurled the jar at the mirror. [348]

The collision wasn’t glass breaking—it was a sigh, a release, the golden hour stretching into something endless. [360]

When the light cleared, the portrait showed her as she was: young, breathless, her hands empty but her pockets lined with stolen time. [376]

The station was silent. [379]

The stationmaster’s ledger lay open, its pages blank except for a single phrase scrawled in ink that shimmered like moonlight: *"The thief who steals light must carry the dark."* [399]

Liora smiled. [401]

She’d never wanted the dark. [404]

She wanted the *in-between*—the fleeting, the almost-gone, the moments so bright they left scars. [415]

As she stepped onto the empty platform, the first stars blinked awake, and the emerald station vanished behind her, swallowed by the kind of night that only exists in memories and thieves’ tales. [435]

The last train was gone. [439]

She’d missed it on purpose. [442]

Some doors weren’t meant to be opened. [446]

They were meant to be *rearranged*. [449]

Liora knelt and plucked a black dahlia from the cracked pavement, its petals still warm. [459]

The code wasn’t in the flowers. [463]

The code was *time itself*, and she’d just learned how to break it. [472]

Somewhere, a clock chimed midnight. [476]

She began to run. [479]

Not away. [481]

*Toward*. [483]

The horizon was a wound of gold and violet, the sky’s last defiant breath before the dark. [494]

Liora leapt, and for the first time, she didn’t just steal a moment— [504]

She *became* it. [506]

The wind carried her, and the stolen moonbeams lit the way, and the emerald station was nothing but a whisper behind her, a place where fate had once been locked away. [528]

Now it was hers. [530]

Now it was *free*. [532]

The sun rose. [535]

She didn’t. [537]

But the light— [539]

Oh, the light remained. [542] </story>
