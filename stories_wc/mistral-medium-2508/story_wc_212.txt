The last egg had hatched at dawn, its shell a brittle crescent moon against the frost-bitten glass of the atrium. [18]

Liora knelt in the blue half-light, her breath curling like smoke as she pressed the oak acorn cap into the permafrost. [32]
It wasn’t just any cap—it was the last piece of her grandmother’s seed-hoard, a relic passed down through women who’d learned to listen to the slow hunger of roots. [55]
The atrium’s iron ribs groaned under the weight of ice, but the stars above burned steady, indifferent to the vortex humming beneath the floor. [75]
She had come here, to the heart of the frozen estate, because the vortex only spoke after a hatching. [90]

The egg’s occupant—a thing of glossy black feathers and too many joints—twitched in its nest of thawed moss. [105]
Liora didn’t touch it. [107]
She knew the rules: what hatched from the atrium’s eggs was never quite yours, only borrowed, like time itself. [123]
Her fingers trembled, furiously tranquil, as she traced the acorn cap’s jagged rim. [133]
The vortex had taken her mother’s voice first, then her name, unraveling her into the estate’s hungry silence. [148]
Liora would not let it take the seeds. [153]

The cap had to be reopened. [157]
Not pried, not forced—*decreased*. [161]
Entropy was a lock, and the key was patience twisted backward. [168]
She exhaled, watching her breath crystallize into fractals on the glass. [177]
The atrium’s air smelled of ozone and old growth, the scent of things waiting to be undone. [188]

The black chick let out a sound like a rusted hinge. [195]
Liora ignored it. [197]
She cupped the acorn cap between her palms and *remembered*—her grandmother’s hands, gnarled as oak roots, pressing a seed into wet earth. [213]
The memory was warm, almost painful. [218]
The cap’s edges softened. [221]

A crack split the ice beneath her knees, thin as a sigh. [229]
The vortex was waking. [232]
It always did when something tried to escape its inheritance. [238]
Liora didn’t flinch. [240]
She whispered the old method, the one her mother had scribbled in the margins of the seed ledger: *"To decrease entropy, you must want the past more than the future."* [260]

The cap unfurled. [263]
Not like a flower—like a wound healing in reverse. [269]
Inside pulsed a seed, dark and veined with silver, humming the same frequency as the chick’s restless chirps. [284]
Liora’s pulse stuttered. [287]
This was the texture of borrowed time: not smooth, not fragile, but *alive*, squirming like a minnow in her grip. [304]

The vortex howled. [307]
Ice shattered upward in jagged teeth, and the chick screeched, its wings unfolding like torn paper. [319]
Liora didn’t run. [322]
She pressed the seed into the frost and *pushed*. [328]

The atrium trembled. [331]
Starlight bent, pooling around the seed like water around a stone. [339]
The vortex’s pull reversed—just for a breath—just long enough for the oak’s memory to surge through the ice, green and relentless. [357]
Liora gasped as roots erupted from the seed, cracking the floor, coiling around the chick’s ankles. [372]
It shrieked, but the roots held, threading into its feathers, its bones. [381]

The vortex wailed, a sound like a thousand names unraveling. [390]
Then—silence. [392]

The chick was still. [395]
No, not still. [397]
*Changed.* [398]
Its feathers had darkened to bark, its joints fused into knotted limbs. [408]
It stood on two legs now, swaying, and when it opened its mouth, a single acorn cap fell onto the thawing earth. [426]

Liora picked it up. [429]
Her hands didn’t shake anymore. [432]
The atrium’s ice was melting, dripping from the iron ribs like tears, and the stars above seemed closer, as if the sky had exhaled. [453]
She tucked the new cap into her seed pouch, beside the others. [461]

The vortex was quiet now, but she knew it would return. [469]
It always did. [471]
That was the inheritance. [473]
But so was this: the weight of a seed in her palm, the chick-turned-sapling stretching toward the starlight, and the wild, serene certainty that some hungers could be outwaited. [499]

Liora smiled. [501]
She had discovered the texture of borrowed time at last. [508]
It was the feel of a root breaking stone. [513]
The feel of a door, reopened. [517]

Outside, the first leaves began to unfold. [522] </story>
