The garden had drowned long ago, its marble arches sagging under the weight of centuries, yet the statues still breathed. [25]

Liora was the last of them—a figure carved from black basalt, her hollow eyes catching the drift of silt like fallen stars, her mind a silent hum against the crushing dark. [50]

She had been watching the intruder for hours, a human in a tattered pressure suit, their gloved fingers brushing the coral-encrusted plaques as if reading the dead city’s pulse. [77]

The ampoule was nestled in the intruder’s belt, its foxglove-stained glass catching the faint bioluminescence of the abyss, swirling violet where the poison had settled. [100]

Liora *knew*—not by sight, but by the way the human’s thoughts coiled around it, a secret too sharp to hold. [117]

*"You think it will save them,"* she projected, her voice not sound but pressure, a ripple through the water that made the human’s ribs ache. [137]

The intruder froze, then turned, their helmet lamp cutting a blade of light across her cracked smile. [149]

"You’re not supposed to be alive," the human signed, fingers trembling over the ampoule’s stopper. [162]

Liora tilted her head, the motion sending a shower of barnacles skittering to the sand. [174]

*"Nothing here is as it seems,"* she murmured into their skull, threading her awareness through the structural weakness of their certainty—how they’d come to poison the sea’s new god, how they’d believed the old scholars’ lies that the city’s heart was a weapon, not a womb. [210]

The human’s breath hitched. [212]

"You’re in my head." [215]

*"Only where the cracks already were."* Liora’s telepathy was incisively kind, not a scalpel but a chisel, tap-tap-tapping at the mortar of their convictions until the first brick gave. [236]

The ampoule’s stain pulsed, as if the foxglove itself was listening. [245]

The human’s knees hit the garden floor, their glove pressing against a mosaic of a woman with six arms, each hand cradling a different truth. [263]

*"They told you the city drowned in hubris,"* Liora said, her voice now a chorus of the statues around them, their hollow mouths opening in unison. [283]

The intruder shook their head, but the memory unspooled anyway—their teacher’s voice, the archives’ sealed tomes, the way the ampoule had been passed to them in a backroom, smelling of copper and desperation. [308]

*"They lied."* The word echoed, and the garden trembled, the water shivering as the first revelation took hold: the city hadn’t sunk. [323]

It had been *planted*. [326]

The human’s fingers convulsed. [328]

Liora reached out—not with hands, but with the weight of the truth she’d carried for three hundred years: the scholars had called the city’s heart a monster, but it was only a child, curled in the deepest chamber, its gills flaring as it dreamed the world anew. [365]

The ampoule slipped from the human’s grip, the foxglove stain blooming like a bruise as it sank toward the mosaic. [380]

*"You were sent to kill a god,"* Liora whispered. *"But gods are just stories we drown in fear."* [397]

The human’s helmet fogged with tears, their breath coming in ragged bursts as the second revelation crashed over them: the poison wasn’t for the child. [418]

It was for the old world’s last root, buried beneath the garden—a thing the scholars had called *mercy*. [433]

Liora let them weep, her telepathy soft now, a current carrying them toward the third truth, the one that would split them open: the city had never been forgotten. [455]

It had been *waiting*. [458]

The human’s hands found the mosaic’s edge, their fingers tracing the grooves where the woman’s six arms met. [472]

*"Thread the needle,"* Liora instructed, guiding their trembling touch to the almost-invisible seam in the garden’s domed roof—the structural weakness no one had dared exploit. [495]

The human hesitated. [497]

*"To welcome nuance into certainty,"* she urged, *"you must first unravel."* [508]

With a sob, they pressed. [511]

The dome groaned, then split, the water above churning as the first tendril of kelp-wrapped light spilled in, followed by the child’s song—a sound like whalesong and breaking glass. [533]

The human ripped off their helmet, letting the sea fill their lungs as the garden bloomed around them, the statues stretching, their stone skin sloughing away like old scales. [556]

Liora smiled, her form dissolving into the current, her voice the last thing the human heard before the water welcomed them home: *"Now we breathe."* [575]

The ampoule settled into the mosaic’s palm, the foxglove stain bleeding into the grooves, repurposed—not as poison, but as pigment for the new world’s first mural. [600]

Above them, the surface of the sea shimmered, no longer a boundary, but a threshold. [612]

And the city, at last, began to rise. [619]
