The *SS Mirabilis* groaned as it listed in the fog, its rusted hull painted with peeling stripes of carnival red and gold, the scent of salt and old cotton candy thick in the air. [33]

Liora traced the emerald swatch card between her fingers, its edges worn smooth by years of handling, the color too vivid for this drowned world—like a memory that refused to fade. [58]

She wasn’t supposed to remember her twin. [64]

The ship had been her cradle, her prison, a floating labyrinth where the funhouse mirrors still whispered half-truths and the carousel horses wept black tears when no one watched. [88]

She was the chimera twin discoverer, though "discover" was too gentle a word for what she’d done: *unearthed*. [102]

Her sister had been the kindling, the spark that made the world real—until the carnival’s owner, a man with too many teeth, decided one twin was enough. [121]

He’d called it mercy. [124]

Liora pressed the swatch to her wrist, where the skin was blissfully aberrant, a patch of scales shimmering like the belly of a fish left too long in the sun. [141]

Proof. [143]

The fog curled through the broken skylight of the hall of mirrors, and for a moment, she saw her sister’s reflection—not as she’d been, but as she *was*: a silhouette in the garden of forgotten names, reaching through the glass. [166]

Liora’s breath hitched. [169]

The garden wasn’t a place. [172]

It was the space between memories, where the names of the erased still grew wild, tangled in the roots of what could have been. [185]

She had to recapture her—not through force, but through narrative threads, the stories they’d spun as children about the clown who collected lost laughter, the tightrope walker who never fell. [207]

The ship creaked, shifting as if waking. [212]

Time here didn’t move forward; it *altered*, bending like the warped wood beneath her feet. [222]

She climbed the stairs to the captain’s quarters, where the owner’s ledger lay open, its pages filled with names crossed out in ink the color of dried roses. [239]

Her sister’s was there. [242]

Liora tore the page free and held it to the emerald swatch. [248]

The card drank the ink like a thirsty ghost, the name bleeding into its fibers until the paper was blank. [260]

A wind howled through the ship, carrying the scent of earth and crushed petals. [268]

The mirrors rippled. [270]

Her sister stepped through, her edges smudged like a half-remembered dream, her hands outstretched. [280]

"You found me," she whispered. [283]

Liora didn’t answer. [285]

She pressed the swatch to her sister’s chest, where the unkindled solace had festered all these years—a hollow where her heart should have been. [299]

The color bled into her, and her sister gasped, her form solidifying, her name stitching itself back into the air like a seamstress mending time. [315]

The ship shuddered. [317]

The fog outside the portholes swirled into faces—other lost twins, other stolen names, their mouths opening in silent screams. [330]

Liora’s sister grabbed her wrist. [333]

"We have to go," she said, but Liora shook her head. [339]

The garden wasn’t just for them. [342]

She turned to the mirrors and began to speak, her voice weaving the first thread of a new story, one where no one was left behind. [357]

The ship groaned again, its bones resisting, but the fog brightened, the air sweetening with the scent of blooming things. [371]

Somewhere, a carousel started to play. [376]

Her sister smiled, blissfully aberrant in her wholeness, and together they stepped through the glass—into the garden, where the names waited to be remembered. [396]

Behind them, the *SS Mirabilis* began to sink, its rusted heart finally still, its carnival lights flickering out one by one like forgotten stars. [414]

But in the garden, the air hummed with voices, and Liora’s hands were full of emerald threads, ready to pull the next lost soul home. [430]

The fog closed behind them, but this time, it wasn’t a barrier. [438]

It was a door. [440] </story>
