The horizon measurement station clung to the cliffside like a barnacle, its brass instruments gleaming dully under a sky the color of wet slate. [23]

Elias Voss adjusted his goggles—the left lens cracked in a jagged smile—and squinted at the great hydraulic clock towering above him, its gears groaning as they forced water through veins of copper pipe. [48]

He was the last shepherd of time in these parts, a title both absurd and eminently peculiar, like calling a man who tends to storms a "wind gardener." [71]

The whistle had blown an hour past, its shriek lost to the fjord’s quiet, and now the real work began: not the winding of clocks, but the listening. [94]

Elias slid the mantle clock key from his belt, its bow worn smooth by decades of use, and pressed it against the tower’s brass heart. [115]

The others at the Bureau of Temporal Cartography called him superstitious, but he knew better—clocks didn’t measure time. [132]

They measured the razor edges between what was and what could be, the fragile seams where seconds split into possibilities. [151]

His father had taught him that, back when the station still hummed with a dozen shepherds, before the Bureau decided time was best left to machines. [173]

Elias turned the key, counting backwards from ninety-seven, the way his father had, the way his father’s father had before him. [192]

*Ninety-six, ninety-five, ninety-four…*

The water in the pipes stuttered, then settled into a rhythm, the clock’s pendulum swinging wide as a scythe. [211]

Something was wrong. [213]

The horizon line—usually crisp as a blade—wavered like heat haze over desert stone. [222]

Elias squinted harder, his vision blurring at the edges, and there, just beyond the station’s furthest theodolite, the sea seemed to *fold*. [241]

A ship, half-sunk in the rippled air, its sails tattered like old parchment, drifted in a time that wasn’t his. [257]

His breath hitched. [259]

The Bureau’s logs called such sightings "chronometric anomalies," but Elias knew the truth: the clocks were bleeding. [275]

He grabbed the station’s ledger, its pages thick with inked columns of numbers, each one a failed attempt to stitch the edges back together. [293]

His father’s last entry read: *"The key doesn’t turn the clock. The clock turns the key."* [306]

Elias’s fingers trembled. [308]

If he wound the mantle clock now, would it pull the ship through? Or would it unravel him instead? [324]

The fjord held its breath. [327]

He pressed the key into the clock’s belly and began to count again, this time from one hundred, his voice a whisper against the gears. [345]

*One hundred, ninety-nine, ninety-eight…*

The water in the pipes turned black. [353]

The ship lurched closer, its hull groaning, and Elias saw them—figures on the deck, pale and staring, their mouths moving in words he almost understood. [373]

His pulse roared in his ears. [376]

At *seventy-three*, the key grew warm. [380]

At *fifty-one*, the air smelled of burnt copper. [385]

At *twenty-nine*, the ship’s bow split the horizon like a needle through silk, and Elias realized: the clocks didn’t measure time. [404]

They *chose* it. [406]

His father had known. The Bureau had always known. [412]

The key turned itself in his grip, the numbers dissolving into static, and for a heartbeat, Elias stood in two places at once—the cliffside station, and the deck of a ship that had sailed a century ago. [436]

A woman in a salt-stiffened coat grabbed his wrist. *"You have to let go,"* she said, her voice like wind through rigging. [451]

The razor edge cut deeper. [454]

Elias exhaled. [456]

He released the key. [458]

The clock shuddered, the pipes vomiting black water onto the stones, and the ship—its crew, its pleading eyes—vanished like a breath on glass. [476]

Silence. [478]

The horizon steadied, sharp again, the fjord’s quiet swallowing the aftermath whole. [487]

Elias picked up the key, its metal now cool and inert, and slipped it back onto his belt. [499]

Somewhere in the Bureau’s archives, a new anomaly would be logged, another failed experiment in bending time to heel. [518]

But Elias knew better. [521]

He wasn’t a shepherd. [523]

He was a gatekeeper. [525]

And gates, once opened, could never be perfectly closed. [532]

That night, as he oiled the clock’s gears by lamplight, he found a new notch in the key’s bow—tiny, precise, like the bite of a razor. [553]

Elias smiled. [555]

Tomorrow, he’d count backwards from ninety-eight. [560]
