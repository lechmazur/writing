The station hummed with the slow pulse of the tide gauges, their rhythmic *clink-clank* against the glass like a metronome counting down something no one could name. [25]

Lena had spent eleven years here, watching the water rise in millimeter increments, logging the creep of the sea as it swallowed another centimeter of the dock, another memory of dry land. [51]

She kept the torn atlas page tucked beneath the clear resin of her worktable, its jagged edge tracing the coast where the ink had bled into nothing—no names, no borders, just the ghost of a shoreline that no longer existed. [88]

The page had been ripped from a pre-Collapse atlas, back when people still printed maps as if the world wouldn’t shift beneath their fingers. [112]

Her supervisor, Dr. Voss, called it sentimentality. [118]

Lena called it evidence. [121]

Every third night, when the generators coughed to life and the station’s lights flickered like bioluminescent plankton, she assembled the fragments she’d collected: a fisherman’s logbook with coordinates scratched out, a child’s crayon drawing of a beach that matched no satellite image, the atlas page with its silent accusation. [167]

She tapped the rhythm on the metal desk—*two quick, one slow*—the same pattern her grandmother had used to call the dogs home before the storms came. [192]

The rhythm wasn’t just habit. [196]

It was a method. [198]

The first time she’d done it, the old sonar screen had stuttered, its green blips rearranging into something almost like a path. [219]

Voss had dismissed it as a glitch, but Lena had seen the way the water had stilled around the pilings that night, as if listening. [240]

After the fossil fuel ban, when the air cleared and the sky remembered how to be blue, the oceans didn’t stop rising. [258]

They just started disappearing in other ways. [263]

Shipping lanes that had existed for centuries now dead-ended into open water. [271]

GPS signals wavered over patches of sea where the depth readings flatlined, as if the water had become shallow and deep at once. [288]

Lena’s grandmother had told her about the *eternal tides*—not the daily pull of the moon, but the slow, periodic unraveling of places the world forgot to keep. [313]

“Some paths aren’t lost,” her grandmother had said, pressing Lena’s palm to the warm hull of her boat. [329]

“They’re *waiting*.” [331]

The night Lena finally assembled all the fragments—the logbook, the drawing, the atlas page—she tapped the rhythm until her fingers ached. [352]

The sonar screen lit up, not with blips, but with a line, thin and wavering, stretching toward a darkness the instruments had never marked before. [375]

Voss found her there at dawn, her face pale as the underside of a wave. [386]

“You’ve been running diagnostics again,” he said, but his voice lacked its usual edge. [401]

Lena didn’t answer. [403]

She was watching the water. [405]

The tide had receded farther than she’d ever seen, exposing a stretch of barnacled stone that shouldn’t have been there. [423]

Not rock. [425]

A road. [427]

Voss swore under his breath, but Lena was already wading out, the torn atlas page clutched in her fist like a promise. [446]

The stones were warm beneath her feet, as if they’d been waiting. [456]

Behind her, the station’s alarms began to blare—not for rising water, but for a depth reading that had just dropped to zero in a place that had been open ocean yesterday. [485]

Voss shouted something about protocols, about safety, but Lena barely heard him. [499]

She knelt and pressed her palm to the road. [504]

The stones hummed. [506]

Not with the *clink-clank* of the tide gauges, but with the same rhythm she’d been tapping all these years. [525]

Some paths didn’t disappear. [529]

They just needed the right hands to call them back. [535]

The water was rising again now, swift and hungry, but the road didn’t vanish. [547]

It stretched onward, submerged but *there*, a path that had been periodic, eternal, waiting for the moment someone assembled the pieces to see it. [570]

Lena stood, the atlas page dissolving in her grip, the ink running like tears into the sea. [584]

Voss grabbed her arm, his voice raw. [589]

“We have to report this.” [592]

She shook her head. [594]

Some things weren’t meant to be recorded. [598]

They were meant to be followed. [601]

The water lapped at her knees as she took the first step, the rhythm of the road pulsing up through her bones. [620]

Behind her, the station’s lights flickered out, one by one, as if the world had just remembered something it had tried to forget. [648]

Ahead, the path gleamed. [651] </story>
