The first light after the hedgehog uncurls is the softest, slipping through the siskin alder grove like breath through reeds. [20]

Elias knelt in the damp needle-bed, his fingers tracing the stress cracks of the old oak sculpture—*The Weeping Mother*—its curves warped by decades of frost and thirst. [40]

He was a tree-song sculptor, though no one remained to hear the music. [50]

The porcelain insulator dangled from his belt, its glazed surface catching the pale dawn, a relic from the time before the wires went silent. [67]

He pressed his ear to the oak’s fissures, listening for the whisper of fibers straining, the way a lute’s strings hum before they’re plucked. [85]

Elias was symphonically minded; he heard the world in vibrations others ignored—the creak of roots drinking, the *sigh* of bark expanding in the heat. [103]

Today, the cracks in *The Weeping Mother* sang differently. [110]

A high, thin note, like a child’s voice held too long, threaded through the lower groans of age. [122]

He strummed the largest fissure with his thumbnail, and the oak answered—a shuddering, hollow chord that made the siskins startle from the branches. [140]

Empathy in motion. [143]

That was the core of it. [146]

The sculpture had been carved in grief, its grain still twisted with the sorrow of the artist who’d shaped it after the last war. [161]

Elias had found it half-buried, its face eroded smooth by rain, but the pain in its posture remained, a silent scream in the wood. [179]

He wanted to give it voice. [183]

The insulator warmed against his hip as he worked, its ceramic shell humming faintly, as if remembering the current it once carried. [199]

He pressed it to another crack, letting the porcelain amplify the wood’s lament. [209]

The sound that emerged was not music, not yet—but it was *almost* a song, the way a held breath is almost a word. [225]

The grove listened. [227]

The alders leaned in, their leaves trembling, and Elias understood: they too had been silent too long. [240]

He adjusted his grip, analyzing the stress patterns like sheet music. [248]

Here, a jagged split where the artist’s chisel had slipped in despair. [255]

There, a hairline fracture from the winter the temperature dropped so fast the sap had frozen mid-flow. [268]

Each flaw held a note. [271]

His calloused fingers moved with deliberate slowness, strumming the wood as one might tune a broken harp. [283]

The insulator thrummed against his palm, translating the vibrations into something clearer, something that ached. [296]

A melody emerged—not beautiful, but *true*. [301]

It was the sound of a mother watching her child’s pyre, of roots snapping under the weight of ice, of a world holding its breath. [318]

Elias closed his eyes. [321]

The silence of the grove wasn’t absence. [325]

It was waiting. [327]

He played until his fingers numbed, until the insulator grew hot as a fevered brow, until the siskins returned, perching on the sculpture’s outstretched arms. [345]

One bird tilted its head, then trilled—a single, questioning note. [352]

Elias answered by dragging his nail down the deepest crack. [359]

The oak *sang*. [361]

Not for him. [363]

For the bird. [365]

For the artist, long dead. [368]

For the hedgehog, now curled again in the undergrowth, listening. [375]

The insulator’s glaze began to weep—tiny beads of moisture, like tears, sliding down its curve. [386]

Elias didn’t wipe them away. [389]

Let it grieve too. [391]

The music swelled, not louder but *deeper*, the kind of sound that doesn’t need ears to be heard. [405]

It vibrated in the marrow of the alders, in the damp earth, in the hollows of Elias’s ribs. [417]

He had spent years chasing this: not the perfection of sound, but its *honesty*. [428]

A silent world didn’t mean a soundless one. [433]

The last note lingered as the light shifted, the grove exhaling. [440]

Elias set the insulator beside the sculpture, its surface now clouded with salt from the oak’s song. [453]

He didn’t need to take it with him. [457]

Some things were meant to stay. [460]

As he walked away, the siskins took up the melody in their own way, stitching it into the rustle of leaves, the creak of branches. [476]

The grove would remember. [479]

And if someone passed through years from now, if they pressed their ear to the cracks in *The Weeping Mother*, they might hear it too: [496]

the sound of empathy, still moving. [500] </story>
