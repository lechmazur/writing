The xenobiology station hung suspended in the twilight of a gas giant’s upper atmosphere, its skeletal frame groaning like a living thing as pressure differentials whispered through the hull. [30]

Inside, Elias Vey adjusted the magnetic nexus with fingers that remembered every bolt, every seam—his hands were mechanically warm, the kind of heat that came from decades of coaxing stubborn machinery back to life. [58]

He wasn’t supposed to be here. [63]

The station’s AI had flagged his presence as an anomaly, a blip in the biometric logs: *Technician #47-9, unauthorized access to Core Lab 7*. [81]

Elias ignored it. [84]

The nexus pulsed under his touch, its holographic principles flickering to life—a lattice of cobalt light, twisting like a school of fish caught in a slow, sideways current. [103]

That was the thing about time, he’d always thought. [110]

It didn’t just move forward. [113]

The station’s primary research—those dormant xenobio specimens in their gel-filled cradles—had shown him that. [125]

Subdued awakenings, the lead scientist had called it: organisms that didn’t so much *wake* as *unfold* from stasis, their cellular memory replaying moments not in sequence, but in layers, like sediment. [147]

Elias had seen it firsthand three cycles ago, when Specimen K-11 had stirred not to the present, but to a *version* of it, its neural spikes firing in patterns that matched no known timeline. [169]

The lever was cold against his palm. [174]

He pulled. [176]

The nexus hummed, its magnetic field warping the air until the lab’s edges blurred, the holograms bleeding into something solid, something *real*. [192]

A wingbeat. [194]

Then another. [196]

The station’s aviary—long abandoned after the last test subject had dissolved into its own echo—shuddered as something inside it *remembered* how to move. [216]

Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the console. [221]

He wasn’t just a sky mechanic, not really. [227]

He was the only one who’d noticed that the station’s clocks ran slower when the specimens dreamed. [239]

The only one who’d measured the way time *leaned* when the nexus was active. [248]

Proof, he’d told himself, that the universe didn’t just tick forward—it *spilled*. [258]

Sideways. [260]

The AI’s voice crackled through the comms, icy but not unkind: *"You’re destabilizing the field. Again."* [272]

Elias didn’t answer. [275]

On the monitor, K-11’s vitals flatlined—not in death, but in *transition*, its body rewinding, then fast-forwarding, a flicker of wings where there should’ve been limbs. [295]

The station groaned, metal fatigues singing in the hush of beating wings at rest. [305]

He adjusted the lever again, finer this time, the way you’d tune an instrument. [314]

The holograms solidified. [317]

For a breath, the lab wasn’t a lab at all—it was a shore, it was a nest, it was the moment before a first flight. [330]

Then the nexus snapped back, the field collapsing like a held note released. [340]

K-11 was gone. [343]

Not dead. [345]

*Elsewhen.* [346]

The AI sighed. *"You realize this violates at least twelve protocols."* [356]

Elias wiped oil from his hands onto his coveralls, the mechanically warm residue lingering. [366]

"Yeah," he said. [369]

"But I was right." [371]

Outside the viewport, the gas giant’s twilight deepened, its bands of color shifting not with the turn of hours, but with something older, something that didn’t obey. [391]

The station’s logs would call it a malfunction. [397]

Elias called it proof. [400]

He reached for the lever one last time, not to pull, but to rest his hand there, feeling the faint thrum of a universe that had always been more than a straight line. [423]

Somewhere, in the sideways dark, K-11 took flight. [430]

And for the first time in cycles, Elias let himself believe that time wasn’t something to be measured, but something to *step through*. [448]

The AI didn’t argue. [451]

It never did. [453]

In the quiet that followed, the station held its breath, and for a moment, so did the sky. [464]
