The locksmith arrived at the frozen library just as the first pale light bled through the clouds, turning the ice-encased shelves into veins of hauntingly bright silver. [30]

Her breath curled like old ink as she traced the spiral staircase upward, each step groaning under boots lined with salt-stiffened leather. [50]

This was the Hall of Whispers, though the scholars called it the Hall of Mirrors—a labyrinth of glass and forgotten time, where every reflection held a scrap of what might have been. [75]

She wasn’t here for the books. [79]

The locksmith—known in the lowland villages as the woman who mended what moonlight broke—carried a clockmaker’s gear assortment in a satchel of waxed canvas, each tool worn smooth by decades of uncapping the stubborn hearts of mechanisms. [110]

Her fingers ached for the rhythm of repair, that precise *click* when a gear found its mate after years of solitude. [125]

But the mirror before her wasn’t glass. [129]

It was water, still and black as a held breath, suspended in a frame of frostbitten iron. [140]

She pressed her palm to its surface, and the ripples spread like cracks in a prophecy: *The hands move backward when the lock is turned.* [155]

The words weren’t hers. [158]

They’d been waiting in the library’s corner, tucked between the spine of a book bound in fish-skin and the skeletal remains of a lantern that had burned too long. [180]

She’d found them three winters ago, during the last lunar eclipse, when the locks of the world had loosened just enough to let slip the truth: this hall wasn’t a maze. [205]

It was a clock. [208]

And it was broken. [210]

The locksmith knelt, scattering her gears across the ice. [215]

A brass key, its teeth filed into the shape of a crescent moon. [220]

A vial of oil that smelled of burnt sugar and old storms. [226]

A pair of pliers, their jaws bent from prying open a door that shouldn’t have been closed. [238]

She worked through the soft hush of distant morning, her shadow stretching long and thin across the mirrors, a second self that moved when she didn’t. [255]

The first gear slotted into place with a sigh. [260]

The second resisted, its teeth gummed with something darker than rust—memories, maybe, or the weight of all the seconds this place had tried to swallow. [280]

She whispered to it, the way she did to stubborn locks, and it relented. [288]

By the time the third gear turned, the water-mirror had begun to hum. [295]

The reflection in it wasn’t hers anymore. [299]

It was a child, small and sharp-eyed, holding a pocket watch with no hands. [308]

*The locksmith,* the child’s lips formed, though no sound came, *you’re late.* [318]

She didn’t ask for what. [321]

She knew. [323]

The last eclipse had taken her sister, stolen by a door that only opened when the world’s breath aligned with the turning of unseen gears. [340]

The locksmith had spent the years since learning the language of mechanisms, deciphering the scraps of prophecy left in the margins of this library’s most fragile texts. [360]

*Turn the key when the light is neither rising nor fallen.* [368]

She’d thought it meant dawn. [371]

But the child in the mirror shook their head, pressing the pocket watch to the glass. [380]

The hands weren’t missing. [383]

They were *inside*, coiled tight as a held scream. [388]

The locksmith exhaled, her breath fogging the mirror’s edge. [394]

She reached in. [396]

The water didn’t resist. [398]

Her fingers closed around the watch, and the child’s form dissolved into ripples, into light, into the *click* of a thousand gears finding their rhythm at once. [418]

The hall shuddered. [420]

The mirrors wept silver. [422]

And far below, in the valley where the eclipse had first bitten the moon, a door swung open with the sound of a held breath finally released. [440]

The locksmith didn’t look back as she descended the stairs, the watch warm against her ribs. [450]

She knew what she’d find when she uncapped its face: not time, but the shape of time’s absence—a sister’s hand, a lunar shadow, the quiet space between what was lost and what could still be mended. [475]

Outside, the clouds parted. [478]

The morning was no longer distant. [481]

It was here, bright and brutal and new, and for the first time in years, the locksmith didn’t feel like a woman out of step with the world. [498]

She felt like the key. [501]

And the world, at last, like a lock worth turning. [508]
