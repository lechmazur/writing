The funhouse mirrors still breathed, their silvered surfaces warping the dark like a lung fighting its last. [20]

Lysander adjusted the opera cloak clasp at his throat—a tarnished raven’s beak, its hinge stiff with the rust of old secrets—and stepped over the shattered ticket booth. [45]

He wasn’t alive, not properly, not after the resuscitation; the doctors had called it a miracle, but the photographs proved otherwise. [66]

Every snapshot of him since that night bore the same curse: his face developed as a smear of light, as if the emulsion itself recoiled from his edges. [90]

*"You’re bleeding into the negative,"* the whispering advisor had hissed in his ear during the funeral for his old self, her voice the sound of a razor dragged across glass. [118]

She wasn’t there now, but her instructions were: *Find the heart of the funhouse. Unbosom the thing that wears your face.* [138]

The air smelled of burnt sugar and copper pennies, the lingering luminance of a thousand laughter-turned-screams still clinging to the peeling wallpaper. [159]

Lysander’s fingers brushed a dream dictionary left splayed on a tilted tea table, its pages filled with paradoxical notes: *"Fear is a lockpick; shame is the door it opens."* [182]

*"To trick fear,"* he muttered, flipping to a passage circled in what looked like dried lipstick, *"you must let it believe it’s already won."* [204]

A mirror ahead didn’t reflect him—it *absorbed*, its surface rippling like oil over water. [216]

He pressed his palm to it. [219]

The glass yielded. [221]

Inside, the funhouse stretched impossibly upward, a spiral of hallways lined with his own photographically cursed likeness, each version of him more unravelled than the last. [243]

*"You’re late,"* said the thing at the center, its voice a chorus of Lysander’s own gasps from the resuscitation table. [262]

It wore his face, but wrong—like a mask stretched over too many fingers, the features sliding when it moved. [280]

*"I’m not here to fight,"* Lysander lied, loosening the opera cloak clasp with a click. [294]

The thing’s grin split wider. *"Then why are you armed with a whisper?"* [305]

He lunged. [307]

Not at it—*through* it, his fingers sinking into its chest like wet paper, pulling free a fistful of blackened filmstrip, the negative of his own heartbeat. [330]

The funhouse shuddered. [332]

The advisor’s voice slithered from the walls: *"Now you see. Fear isn’t the dark. It’s the hand that thinks it’s holding the flashlight."* [356]

The mirrors began to weep silver. [359]

Lysander let the filmstrip unspool between his fingers, watching as the frames burned with lingering luminance, each one a stolen moment of his life—his first lie, his last breath, the resuscitation’s cruel spark. [387]

*"You tricked me,"* the thing whispered, its form dissolving into static. [398]

*"No,"* Lysander said, clapsing the raven’s beak shut around the last ember of light. *"I let you trick yourself."* [416]

The funhouse exhaled. [418]

Outside, dawn broke like a bruise, the carnival’s ruins glistening with something almost beautiful. [430]

Lysander didn’t look back. [433]

The photographs would still curse him, the advisor would still whisper, and the clasp at his throat now held a new kind of hunger. [453]

But for the first time since the resuscitation, his reflection in a puddle didn’t flinch. [466]

It *winked*. [468]

Lysander smiled. [470]

Then he walked into the light, carrying the repulsive allure of a man who’d learned fear wasn’t the monster under the bed—it was the bed itself, and he’d just made the sheets. [499]

Somewhere, a camera’s shutter clicked. [503]

The developed photo would show only a cloak, its clasp gleaming like a beak full of stolen stars. [520]

And if you looked close, in the corner, a single word scrawled in lipstick: *"Next."* [533]

Lysander adjusted the clasp. [536]

The game wasn’t over. [538]

It had only just remembered how to play. [543] </story>
