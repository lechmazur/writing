The first time Elias met the dead language tutor, he was borrowing sugar—though neither of them needed it. [20]

The knock on the third-floor door was answered by a man with ink-stained fingers, his spectacles perched precariously on a nose that had seen too many books. [38]

"Ah," the tutor said, as if he’d been expecting Elias for years, "you’ve come about the *seal*." [50]

Elias blinked, the lie about sugar dying on his lips, because there it was on the antique desk—a brass seal, its face etched with a script no living scholar recognized. [70]

The tutor, whose name was Veyra (or so he claimed; the lease listed no tenant), gestured to the rooftop garden where wisteria vines curled like question marks. [90]

"Sit," he said, pouring tea from a pot that hadn’t been there a moment before, steam curling into the shapes of forgotten letters. [110]

Elias sat, patiently nimble, because something in the way Veyra moved suggested this was a game with rules he didn’t know yet. [127]

The tutor slid the seal across the desk. "This marks contracts in the language of old buildings," he murmured, as if confiding a secret the walls already knew. [146]

Elias turned it over. The metal was warm, humming faintly, like a held breath. [156]

"You want to learn it," Veyra stated, not asked, because Elias had been lingering outside this apartment for weeks, pressing his palm to the bricks, listening. [175]

The truth was, Elias *did*—not for scholarship, but because the brownstone he’d inherited whispered to him in creaks and drafts, and he was tired of not understanding. [195]

Veyra’s smile was the kind that belonged to a man who’d died once already. "Then we’ll begin," he said, "but you must agree to the lies first." [213]

The lessons were never in the apartment. [217]

They happened on the rooftop during meteor showers, when the sky wrote in fire and the city’s noise dulled to a murmur. [233]

Veyra would press Elias’s fingers to the bricks, tracing symbols that bled into existence under his touch—*here, the lintel sighs; there, the foundation remembers*. [253]

Elias learned quickly, but the language resisted being *known*, slipping like mercury between his ribs. [266]

One evening, as a meteor split the sky into jagged syllables, Veyra handed him a contract written in his own blood. [282]

"Sign it," the tutor said, "and the building will tell you its name." [290]

Elias hesitated. "What’s the lie?" [294]

Veyra’s laugh was dry as old parchment. "That you’ll walk away unchanged." [303]

He signed. [305]

The seal burned against his palm as the ink drank his signature, and the brownstone *exhaled*—a sound like a door unsealing after decades. [323]

The walls began to speak, not in words but in *pressure*, in the weight of every tenant who’d ever wept in the kitchen, every child who’d scratched initials into the banister. [344]

Elias staggered, but Veyra caught him, his grip surprisingly solid for a man who smelled faintly of damp earth and chalk. [363]

"You see now," the tutor murmured, "why we agree to the lies." [373]

Because the truth—the *real* truth—was that the language wasn’t for learning. [383]

It was for *interrogating*. [385]

The brownstone had been waiting for someone stubborn enough to ask why the third-floor window never opened, why the basement stairs counted differently on Tuesdays. [405]

Elias’s fingers trembled as he pressed the seal to the bricks and demanded, *"What did you do to her?"*—because the building’s grief had a shape now, a woman’s silhouette in the wallpaper. [428]

Veyra didn’t answer. [431]

He only sipped his tea, watching as the meteor shower peaked, the sky writing its own unreadable contract across the dark. [447]

The next morning, Elias woke to find the tutor’s door ajar, the apartment empty save for the desk and the seal, now cold. [463]

The lease still listed no tenant. [467]

But the brownstone’s whispers had sharp edges now, and Elias understood: some lies were agreements, and some agreements were tombs. [484]

He kept the seal. [487]

And when the new tenant moved in—another scholar, another hungry listener—Elias knocked on the door with a cup of sugar he didn’t need. [507]

"Ah," the woman said, as if she’d known him for years, "you’ve come about the *desk*." [522]

Elias smiled, patient as the dead, nimble as a lie. [531]

The rooftop garden was already set for tea. [537]
