The albino tracker crouched in the wind-carved encampment, his pale fingers tracing the cracks in the dried earth where the eclipse’s shadow had lingered too long. [24]

His name was Kael, though no one here knew it—just as no one knew why the air still hummed with the weight of time stretched thin, like a bowstring about to snap. [46]

At his feet, the artificial hummingbird drone lay motionless, its iridescent wings cracked from the fall, its tiny lens still flickering with the last coordinates of the thing he hunted. [69]

Kael exhaled through his teeth, the breath curling like smoke in the cold dawn, and pressed his thumb against the drone’s underbelly, activating the disappearing ink stored in its reservoir. [91]

The liquid bled onto the ground in jagged, ephemeral patterns—swirls of black that dissolved before they could settle, revealing glimpses of something buried beneath: a symbol, a warning, a lie. [116]

He had been tracking the slow-thief for months, a man who stole time itself in moments of crisis, leaving victims frozen mid-scream, their faces locked in silent terror while the world moved on without them. [142]

The encampment was a graveyard of such pauses: a child’s hand outstretched toward a fallen cup, a woman’s mouth half-open in a plea, her hair still rippling from the wind that had died hours ago. [169]

Kael’s milky eyes burned with serene anger, the kind that didn’t shout but carved rivers through stone. [183]

He knew the thief used the ink—knew it was the key. [190]

The patterns weren’t just messages; they were doors. [195]

When spilled in the right sequence, the ink became a threshold, and if you stepped through at the precise moment the last stroke faded, you could disappear—not just from sight, but from time. [221]

Kael had tried it once, years ago, after the first village he failed to save. [230]

He’d vanished for three days, then reappeared in the same instant, his hair streaked white, his veins threaded with something that wasn’t blood. [245]

The drone buzzed weakly, its damaged wing twitching as it projected a hologram: the thief, standing at the edge of the encampment, his gloved hand dipping into a pouch of ink. [265]

Kael didn’t run. [267]

He walked, his boots kicking up dust that hung suspended in the air, because time was already bending, already resisting the thief’s pull. [283]

The man turned, grinning, his teeth too sharp. [289]

"You’re too late," he said, but his voice was slow, syrupy, like he was speaking through honey. [302]

Kael didn’t answer. [304]

Instead, he unscrewed the drone’s reservoir and let the ink spill between them, the black liquid branching like lightning, forming the same pattern Kael had seen in his nightmares—the one that had taken his sister. [328]

The thief’s smile faltered. [331]

"You don’t understand what you’re—" [336]

Kael stepped forward. [338]

The world blurred. [340]

For a heartbeat, there was only silence, the kind that lived in the space between ticks of a clock. [352]

Then the ink dissolved, and the thief was gone. [358]

The encampment gasped back to life—a child’s cup clattered to the ground, the woman’s plea tore free—but Kael stood still, his fingers curled into fists. [378]

The drone whirred, its lens refocusing on the horizon where the thief had stood. [387]

No body. [389]

No blood. [391]

Just a single, fresh symbol etched into the earth, already fading: a spiral with a broken center. [404]

Kael knelt, pressing his palm to the mark. [409]

Time didn’t slow in crisis, he realized. [413]

It *fractured*. [414]

And the thief wasn’t stealing it. [417]

He was collecting the pieces, one shattered second at a time, trying to put something back together. [429]

Kael’s breath came faster now, his pulse a drumbeat against the quiet. [438]

He had spent his life hunting a monster, only to learn the monster was hunting too. [450]

The drone’s wings repaired themselves with a soft *click*, its lens swiveling toward Kael, waiting. [462]

He wiped the last of the ink from his fingers and stood. [468]

If time could break, it could be remade. [473]

And if the thief could disappear through the patterns, so could he. [480]

Kael reached into his coat and pulled out his own pouch of ink, the vial warm against his skin. [492]

He would follow. [494]

Not to kill. [496]

To understand. [498]

Because the eclipse had ended, but the shadow it cast was still growing. [510]

And Kael was the only one consciously wild enough to walk into the dark and ask why. [523]

The wind howled through the encampment, carrying the scent of rain. [532]

Kael spilled the ink. [535]

The world held its breath. [538]

Then he stepped through, and the last of the patterns dissolved behind him, leaving no trace at all. [554]

Somewhere, a clock began to tick again. [559]

Somewhere else, it stopped forever. [564]

Kael didn’t look back. [567] </story>
