The floating rock did not sway, though the wind carried the scent of damp earth and crushed sage from the valley below. [19]

Dr. Elias Vey sat cross-legged, his spine straight as a sycamore, fingers resting on his knees like roots settling into stone. [35]

He was sixty-three today—or perhaps thirty, or twelve; the numbers blurred now, slipping backward with each meditation, his body unraveling its own years with stubborn precision. [58]

Beneath the platform, the magnetic grotto hummed, its walls embedded with veins of lodestone that pulsed in time with the starlight filtering through the fissures above. [80]

Elias had chosen this place for its silence, and for the way the grotto’s pull made his bones feel weightless, as if he might dissolve entirely if he stillness long enough. [104]

A student had come once, years ago, asking how to vanish. [113]

Elias had not answered then. [117]

Instead, he’d taken a smooth river stone from his pocket and dropped it into the black pond at the platform’s edge, watching the ripples spread in perfect, diminishing circles. [136]

“Truth is not a door,” he’d murmured, tracing a finger above the water. [144]

“It is the space between the rings.” [149]

The student had left frustrated, but Elias had seen the way their eyes lingered on the pond’s surface, the way their breath hitched when the last ripple faded into stillness. [172]

Now, as the trance deepened, Elias felt the years peel away—not in chunks, but in whispers, like petals from a dying flower. [190]

His knuckles softened; the ache in his left hip dissolved. [197]

He was twenty again, then fifteen, then eight, standing barefoot in his grandfather’s orchard, the air thick with the scent of overripe plums. [218]

The memory was so vivid he could taste the sugar on his tongue, could hear his grandfather’s voice: *“Some things must be withheld to be understood.”* [237]

Elias exhaled, and the grotto’s magnetic field shivered in response, the starlight above fracturing into prismatic threads. [253]

He knew the danger of revealing too soon. [259]

The world was not ready for a man who aged in reverse, whose cells remembered youth like a language half-forgotten. [276]

But the pond remembered. [280]

He dropped another stone. [283]

One ripple. [285]

Two. [287]

Three—then the pattern fractured, the water’s surface splitting into a lattice of intersecting lines, a code only he could read. [306]

The trance pulled him deeper, and he saw himself as a child again, pressing his palm to a sycamore’s bark, feeling the tree’s slow, patient pulse. [326]

*“To teach vanishing,”* his grandfather had said, *“you must first teach appearing.”* [340]

Elias understood now. [343]

The grotto’s hum vibrated through his ribs, and he let the years unspool further, let his body grow smaller, lighter, until his feet no longer touched the rock. [365]

The pond’s surface stilled. [369]

He hovered, suspended between time and the magnetic pull of the earth, and when he spoke, his voice was neither old nor young, but something in between—a syllable of wind. [392]

“The space between the rings,” he whispered, “is where you learn to be seen.” [405]

Below, in the grotto’s heart, the lodestone shifted, aligning itself into a new pattern, a map of absence and presence. [421]

Elias knew the student would return. [427]

They always did. [430]

And when they asked again how to vanish, he would drop another stone, and this time, he would let them watch the ripples until the water remembered their shape. [455]

The trance broke as suddenly as it had come, leaving him gasping, his fingers clawing at the rock as his body snapped back to sixty-three—no, sixty-two now, the reversal stuttering like a misplaced breath. [485]

The grotto’s glow dimmed, the starlight retreating into the fissures as if embarrassed by its own brilliance. [501]

Elias smiled. [504]

The lesson was not in the disappearing. [509]

It was in the way the pond held the memory of the stone long after the stone was gone. [522]

He stood, his bones creaking with the weight of years both lived and unlived, and walked to the pond’s edge. [539]

One last stone. [542]

One last ripple. [545]

The water shivered, then stilled, its surface a perfect mirror of the sycamore hush above. [556]

Somewhere, a student was watching. [561]

Somewhere, a truth was being woven. [566]

Elias stepped off the platform and let the grotto’s pull guide him downward, into the dark where the starlight could not follow. [585]

The pond remembered. [588]

The rings would teach the rest. [592]
