The last time Elias Veyne spoke more than three words to another soul, the lighthouse lamp still burned. [16]

Now, three months after the flicker-out, he guided his supply skiff through the mist like a man tracing a scar—silent, precise, the oars dipping without ripple. [34]

The island’s lantern room had been haunted long before the light died, but the ghost wasn’t the kind that wailed. [47]

It was the kind that left things: a piece of sea glass on the windowsill, smooth as a held breath, its green edge catching the dawn like a secret. [64]

Elias pocketed it every morning and returned it every evening, a ritual as fixed as the tides. [75]

He wasn’t superstitious, but the glass felt like a promise—proof someone, somewhere, had once pressed their palm to the storm and survived. [92]

The letters began arriving in bottles, wedged between the supply crates of kerosene and salt pork. [105]

No names, no seals, just ink on water-warped paper: *"The tower remembers your hands."* [115]

Elias burned the first three. [118]

The fourth arrived with a sketch of the lantern room’s floor, stones stacked in a spiral—a cipher, or a map, or the way his mother used to arrange river rocks to mark safe crossing when the creek ran high. [141]

He hadn’t thought of her in years. [146]

That night, he climbed the stairs for the first time since the lamp went dark, his boots scuffing over the threshold where the glass always waited. [162]

The air smelled of rust and old wax, the ache of light that used to be. [172]

On the floor, someone had stacked stones in a perfect ring, and at its center lay another scrap: *"You kept us safe. Let us keep you."* [190]

Elias’s throat tightened. [193]

He knew, then, who the ghost was—not a specter, but the keepers before him, their hands guiding his through the letters, the glass, the silent language of balanced weight. [215]

They’d left the stones as a lock, a way to bottle safety when the world outside was all teeth and salt. [229]

He added his own rock to the ring. [234]

The next morning, a bottle bobbed against the skiff’s hull before he’d even cast off. [243]

Inside, a single word: *"Stay."* [246]

Elias tucked the sea glass into his palm, its edges warm as a pulse. [253]

For the first time in months, he didn’t return it to the sill. [260]

Instead, he climbed to the lantern room and lit a candle in the hollow of the stone spiral, watching the flame bend toward the glass like a held note. [278]

The mist outside thickened, but the tower no longer felt empty. [286]

He sat down, picked up a pen, and wrote his first reply. [293]

*"I’ll teach you how to stack them higher."* [299]

The skiff could wait. [302]

By dawn, the spiral had grown another layer, the stones fitted so tightly they hummed when the wind hit them right. [318]

Elias smiled. [320]

It was the kind of smile that didn’t need sound—the kind that lingers in the corners of a room long after the body’s gone, pressed into the walls like the ghost of light. [339]

The lamp was dead, but the tower breathed. [344]

And for the first time, so did he. [348]

The letters kept coming. [351]

Sometimes they held names now—*Adair, 1892*; *Mira, the one who sang*—and sometimes just the weight of a shared silence, the ink blurred by fingers that had once gripped the same railing Elias gripped now. [377]

He answered each one, stacking stones as he went, the spiral climbing toward the broken lens like a ladder to nowhere and everywhere. [395]

The sea glass stayed in his pocket, its green glow a reminder: safety wasn’t the absence of storms, but the hands that passed the light between them. [414]

One evening, as the sun bled into the horizon, Elias found a new bottle wedged into the stones. [428]

No note this time. [430]

Just a second piece of glass, blue as a held breath. [436]

He laughed, low and rough, and slotted it beside the green. [443]

The tower sighed around him, the stones settling like a held note finally released. [452]

Outside, the mist curled against the glass, but the dark didn’t feel so heavy anymore. [463]

Elias picked up his pen. [466]

*"Tomorrow,"* he wrote, *"we build a door."* [473]

He didn’t know if they’d answer. [477]

But the stones were warm beneath his palms, and the sea glass glowed, and for the first time in a long time, the silence felt like an invitation. [496]

The skiff would rot at the dock. [500]

Let it. [502]

Some things weren’t meant to leave. [505]

He blew out the candle and listened to the tower breathe, the stones humming like a choir of held notes, the glass in his pocket pulsing like a second heart. [526]

The lamp was dead. [529]

The light wasn’t. [531]

And neither was he. [534]
