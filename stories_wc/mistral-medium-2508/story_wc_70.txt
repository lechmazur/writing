The lightning tower hummed like a struck tuning fork, its copper ribs still warm from the storm that had gutted the city’s power an hour before. [20]

Elias, the toll keeper of the Skybridge, leaned against the tower’s base, his boots scuffed from a decade of counting steps he no longer needed to take—no one crossed since the blackout. [40]

His hands, rough as bark, worried the lacquer box in his pocket, its edges smooth from years of handling. [52]

The box had been his father’s, then his father’s before that, passed down like the toll keeper’s duty: a job no one applied for but no one could refuse. [72]

Elias was born with the affliction of truth—words spilled from him unbidden, raw as honey from a crushed comb. [85]

Tonight, that curse felt heavier than usual. [90]

Above him, the drone beehive—a lattice of humming wings meant to pollinate the vertical farms—had gone dark mid-cycle, leaving the crops to wilt in the sudden silence. [107]

The city’s engineers would blame the storm, but Elias knew better. [115]

He’d seen the matchbox tucked into the beehive’s control panel yesterday, its label scrawled in ink that smelled of burnt sugar: *"For the keeper who counts what cannot be seen."* [133]

Inside, a riddle: *"I am the weight of a promise unkept, the shadow of a light never lit. Feed me, and I starve. Starve me, and I bloom."* [151]

The words had itched under his skin all day. [156]

Now, with the city holding its breath in the dark, he slid the lacquer box from his pocket and pried it open. [171]

A single seed rested inside, black as a crow’s eye, veined with gold. [179]

His father had called it the Last Wonder, a relic from before the drones, before the towers, when bees still remembered their own names. [194]

The seed was supposed to be planted when the world forgot how to be amazed. [204]

Elias’s fingers trembled. [207]

The truth clawed up his throat: *You’re afraid it won’t work.* [214]

He swallowed hard. [216]

The beehive’s failure wasn’t the storm. It was the city. [222]

They’d stopped looking up. [225]

The vertical farms, the scheduled sunlight, the tolls paid in credits instead of stories—it had all been designed to make life seamless, predictable. [238]

Even the drones had become just another hum in the background, their pollen routes mapped and monotonous. [248]

Elias climbed the tower’s ladder, the rungs cold beneath his palms. [255]

At the top, the wind carried the scent of ozone and damp earth, the air thick with the weight of something about to change. [267]

He pressed the seed into the beehive’s central node, where the drones docked to recharge. [277]

The riddle’s answer bloomed in his mind: *wonder*. [281]

You fed it routine, and it withered. [285]

You starved it of certainty, and it grew wild. [290]

The first drone sputtered to life, its wings stuttering like a held breath. [298]

Then another. [300]

And another. [301]

The beehive thrummed, not with the steady pulse of programming, but with something jagged and alive. [310]

Elias watched as the drones veered from their grids, tracing chaotic paths between the towers, their lights flickering like fireflies. [323]

Below, someone gasped. [326]

A child pointed. [328]

A woman laughed, her voice bright as a struck bell. [333]

The blackout wasn’t just a failure. [337]

It was an invitation. [339]

Elias descended, the lacquer box empty now, his chest light for the first time in years. [350]

At the bridge’s foot, a girl no older than ten tugged his sleeve. [357]

“Mister, why’d the lights go out?” she asked, her eyes huge in the gloom. [365]

The truth rose in him, but this time, it didn’t burn. [372]

“So we’d remember to look,” he said. [377]

She grinned, gap-toothed and gleaming, and ran off to chase the erratic drones. [386]

The engineers would come at dawn, demanding explanations, blaming the system. [394]

Elias would tell them the truth—about the seed, the riddle, the beehive’s hunger. [405]

They wouldn’t believe him. [408]

But the child would. [410]

And the baker who’d paused mid-knead to watch the sky. [416]

And the old man who’d wept when the drones dipped low enough to brush his outstretched fingers. [426]

The city’s power would return. [429]

The tolls would be reinstated. [432]

But for tonight, the air tasted of rain and possibility, and the drones danced like they’d never known a grid. [446]

Elias sat on the bridge’s edge, swinging his legs over the drop, and waited for the sunrise he couldn’t see but could feel coming—warm, inevitable, and wild. [465]
