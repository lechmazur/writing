The static hissed through the headphones like a nest of angry stars, and Liora adjusted the dial with fingers that remembered every notch by heart. [20]

She wasn’t supposed to be here—not after the department chair had "suggested" she take a leave, not with the astronomy building’s doors locked tight against her keycard—but the radio station in the basement of the old physics hall still hummed with forgotten current, its equipment older than the university’s newest power struggles. [60]

The astronomical charts were spread across the console, their inked constellations smudged where her sleeves had brushed them, the margins scribbled with frequencies that shouldn’t exist. [80]

Three nights ago, the signal had changed. [85]

It wasn’t the usual cosmic chatter, the slow pulse of dying quasars or the screech of black holes tearing space—this was a pattern, deliberate and taunting, threading through the noise like a needle pulling string. [110]

Liora had spent a decade as a celestial signal interpreter, translating the whispers of the universe for people who preferred their mysteries neat and labeled, but this wasn’t a message. [130]

It was a dare. [132]

The university was splitting at the seams—faculty factions squabbling over grant money, students picking sides in lectures turned debates, the dean’s office leaking memos about "academic integrity" that everyone knew meant *loyalty*. [160]

She’d been called paranoid when she suggested the signal wasn’t natural, that something was *testing* them, prodding at the cracks in their little human empire. [180]

Now the charts proved it. [183]

The frequencies aligned with the fractures in the community: a spike when the physics department voted to cut ties with astronomy, a harmonic resonance the night the grad students walked out. [205]

Coincidence? [206]

Liora’s thumb hovered over the transmit switch. [209]

If she was right, the signal wasn’t just observing—it was *participating*. [216]

And if she could interfere, just enough to disrupt the pattern… [221]

The subsonic frequencies were her gambit, a counter-melody too low for human ears but sharp enough to cut through cosmic static. [235]

She’d spent the last forty-eight hours calibrating, her caution warring with the hope that she could outwit whatever tricksters lurked in the dark. [250]

The first pulse sent a shiver through the building’s bones. [256]

On the third floor, a heated argument between two professors faltered mid-sentence, their voices suddenly too thin to carry weight. [270]

In the quad, a cluster of undergrads paused their chanting, their signs drooping as if the air had gone heavy. [280]

Liora exhaled, watching the signal on the screen waver like a reflection in disturbed water. [288]

It *knew*. [290]

The response came as a pressure in her skull, a soundless hum that made her teeth ache—laughter, or something like it. [305]

She adjusted the frequency again, finer this time, her cautiously hopeful heart pounding. [315]

This wasn’t about winning. [318]

It was about proving they weren’t pawns. [321]

The charts fluttered as the ventilation kicked on, the inked stars seeming to shift under the dim bulb’s glow. [330]

Outside, the campus held its breath. [333]

Then the signal *changed*. [336]

The pattern dissolved into something new—still alien, but less predatory, more… *curious*. [345]

Liora leaned back, the headphones warm against her ears, the static now laced with something almost like conversation. [355]

She didn’t know if she’d outwitted them or just annoyed them into playing nicer. [365]

But for the first time in weeks, the university’s divisions felt less like wounds and more like scars—proof they’d survived something. [380]

The door creaked open behind her. [383]

"Dr. Voss?" A grad student’s voice, hesitant. "The dean’s looking for you. [390]

They’re saying the interference stopped the… well, everything." [396]

Liora turned, the charts rustling under her elbow. [400]

"Tell them," she said, "I was just fixing the radio." [406]

The student hesitated, then nodded, as if that explained the way the air still thrummed with something unspoken. [418]

Liora watched them go, then reached for the dial again. [423]

The universe was still talking. [426]

And now, so was she. [428] </story>
