The last light of dusk bled through the mist, turning the atrium’s glass ceiling into a bruise of violet and gold. [18]
Lena sat on a stone bench, her fingers tracing the jagged edge of a brain coral fragment—salvaged from the wreckage of a fishing boat off Mindanao, where she’d once translated between rebels and medics while mortar fire stuttered in the distance. [52]
Her other hand cradled a child’s plaster cast, its surface scrawled with smudged crayon: *Mama’s voice sounds like the radio when the storm comes*. [73]
The anesthetic had just taken hold, dulling the ache in her ribs where shrapnel had once nested, but the old wounds hummed anyway, restless. [93]

A nurse had pressed the cast into her palms earlier, whispering, *“The girl’s father was your last client. She won’t speak to anyone else.”* [113]
Lena turned the plaster over, her translator’s instinct unknotting the child’s fear like a cipher—each loop of crayon a syllable lost in static, each smudge a breath held too long. [135]
She was shrewdly innocent that way, able to hear the unsaid in the way a soldier’s fingers twitched toward phantom rifles, or how a widow’s tea went cold before the first sip. [158]

The coral fragment dug into her palm, its labyrinthine grooves mirroring the atrium’s archways, where ivy curled like old barbed wire. [175]
Twilight thickened the air, and the mist coiled around her ankles, cool as the memory of the operating tent where she’d first learned that pain could be translated, too—not just words, but the shape of it, the weight. [201]
The girl’s father had died clutching a radio, tuning through dead frequencies, searching for his daughter’s voice in the crackle. [221]

Lena exhaled, her breath fogging the cast. [226]
She dipped her finger in the condensation and began to trace over the smudges, decrypting them not as chaos but as a dialect of grief—here, a spiral for the way fear tightens the throat; there, a jagged line for the sound of a door kicked in at midnight. [254]
The coral’s ridges bit deeper, grounding her. [260]
She wasn’t just a translator anymore. She was a grafter, stitching new meaning into the ruptures: *Your father’s last word was your name. The static was just the sea, answering.* [283]

A shadow shifted in the mist—a boy, no older than ten, his arms wrapped around a tattered schoolbag. [294]
*“They say you can fix things,”* he said, voice thin as the atrium’s fading light. [304]
Lena didn’t look up. *“I unknot them.”* [309]
He hesitated, then pulled a crumpled photo from his pocket: a family at a beach, their faces blurred by salt and time. *“My brother drew over it. Now I can’t see them.”* [333]

She took the photo, her pulse steady. [338]
The boy’s brother had scrawled over the figures with black marker, but the pressure of his hand betrayed the shape beneath—here, a shoulder; there, the curve of a smile. [358]
Lena’s fingers moved, not to erase, but to trace the negative space, the way she’d once mapped landmines by the absence of footprints in the mud. [380]
*“He wasn’t trying to hide them,”* she murmured. *“He was holding them.”* [392]

The boy’s breath hitched. [395]
Around them, the atrium held its breath, too—the mist, the ivy, the last of the light pooling like a held note. [409]
Lena pressed the coral into his palm. *“Take this. When you miss them, run your fingers over the ridges. It’s how the sea remembers the shore.”* [431]

He clutched it, his knuckles white. [435]
Somewhere beyond the glass, a siren wailed, then faded—another wound, another translation waiting. [447]
Lena stood, her ribs singing, and walked toward the mist, where the shapes of other broken things waited to be unknotted. [465]

The coral’s weight in the boy’s pocket was the first true sentence he’d heard in months. [476]
And in the hush of the atrium, where twilight bled into memory, the smudges on the cast began to glow—just slightly, like embers cupped in careful hands. [495]
