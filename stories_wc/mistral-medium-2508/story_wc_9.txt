The cartomancer’s fingers trembled as she unfastened the silver clasp of her satchel, the one stitched with constellations only she could read. [20]

Moonlight bled through the canopy of the midnight glade, suspended above the clouds like a forgotten breath, and the air smelled of damp earth and something older—like the slow unraveling of regret. [45]

She had come here after the birth, not of a child, but of a silence: the kind that swallows hours whole. [60]

Her name was Liora, though the villagers called her the Onyx-Ink Cartomancer, for the way her divinations left stains like bruises on the parchment. [80]

Tonight, she sought not futures but fractures—specifically, the hairline crack in her grandmother’s dolls’ tea set saucer, the one that had appeared the morning her little brother vanished into the mist twenty years prior. [110]

The family custom demanded she trace her hand on the birthday tablecloth, pressing her palm into the linen until the threads remembered her. [135]

But the tablecloth was back in the valley, and Liora was cloudbound, her boots sinking into the spongy moss as if the earth itself was reluctant to let her go. [155]

She knelt, spreading the saucer on a flat stone, its crack a jagged sigh across porcelain. [165]

The cards had told her lost time didn’t disappear—it *accumulated*, pooled in places where the veil between moments grew thin. [185]

And this glade, where the wind carried voices that weren’t there, was such a place. [195]

Liora dipped her finger into the inkwell at her belt, the liquid black and viscous as a starless sky. [210]

She began to trace the crack, not with her hand, but with the memory of her brother’s—small, stubborn, always clutching a wooden top he’d carved from an acorn. [235]

The ink seeped into the porcelain, spreading like roots, and the saucer hummed. [245]

A sound like a child’s laughter, distorted by distance, curled around her ankles. [255]

Liora’s breath hitched. [257]

She was willingly perplexed, had always been—the kind of woman who chased riddles into the dark and called it devotion. [270]

But this was different. [272]

The glade shifted. [274]

The trees leaned in, their branches knitting into a canopy so dense the clouds below churned like restless ghosts. [290]

And then—there he was. [293]

Not as he’d been, but as he *was*: a man now, his eyes still the same storm-gray, his hands still holding that damned top. [310]

“You found me,” he said, though his mouth didn’t move. [315]

Liora’s throat tightened. [317]

“Where have you *been*?” [319]

He smiled, sad and slow, and pointed at the saucer. [325]

The ink had bled into a map—no, a *ledger*—each crack a year, each year a theft. [335]

“Time doesn’t leave,” he murmured. “It just… waits.” [340]

She understood then: the glade was a reservoir. [344]

All the seconds she’d spent staring at doorways, the minutes she’d wasted listening for his footsteps, the hours that had stretched into a lifetime of absence—they’d gathered here, thick as syrup. [365]

And her brother? [367]

He’d been wading through them, one slow step at a time. [372]

Liora reached for him, but her fingers passed through his shoulder like mist. [380]

“You have to *repent*,” he said, and the word tasted like copper. [385]

Not for sins. [387]

For *time*. [388]

For the way she’d hoarded grief like a miser, for the way she’d let the past eat the present raw. [405]

The saucer shattered. [407]

The glade exhaled. [409]

And Liora—finally, achingly—let go. [412]

She didn’t weep. [414]

She *unfastened*. [415]

The satchel’s clasp. [416]

The knot in her chest. [417]

The idea that some losses were meant to be carried forever. [422]

When she opened her eyes, the glade was just a glade again, the clouds just clouds. [435]

But her hands were warm. [437]

And in her palm, an acorn. [439]

Liora pocketed it, turned toward the valley, and began the long walk down. [448]

The stars watched her go, their light no longer accusatory, but gentle. [455]

Like a benediction. [456]

Like a beginning. [457]
