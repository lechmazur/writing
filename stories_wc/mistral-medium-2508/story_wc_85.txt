The cobalt terrace stretched like a bruise beneath the dusk, its tiles slick with the last gasp of ocean mist. [19]
Elias Veyne adjusted the brass cuff of his coat, the metal cold against his wrist—colder than the watch hand tucked in his pocket, its filigree edges worn smooth by years of fretting. [43]
He wasn’t supposed to keep relics, not after the work he did: stitching lies into bloodlines for coin, grafting false grandparents onto orphaned heirs, or—worse—erasing the ones who’d disgraced a name. [75]
But this fragment, salvaged from a job gone sour, had become his penance. [86]

The terrace overlooked a shore where driftwood bones jutted from the sand, each piece carved by time into something almost deliberate. [105]
Elias knelt, fingers tracing the grooves of a half-buried figure—its curves too precise to be accidental, too crude to be art. [123]
He’d learned years ago that memory wasn’t stored in the mind alone; it clung to objects, to the grain of wood, to the weight of a watch hand that had once belonged to a man he’d helped disappear. [152]
That was the siege of hush: not silence, but the slow sifting of truth until only the palatable remained. [168]

A client’s voice slithered into his thoughts—*Make it clean*—the same request that had sent him to this terrace a dozen times before. [184]
He’d quelled their fears with forged letters, with doctored ledgers, with the quiet assurance that no one would ever ask the right questions. [205]
But the watch hand in his pocket was the one question he couldn’t answer. [216]
Its original owner, a man named Harkin, had paid Elias to sever his lineage from a scandal, only to vanish mid-transaction. [235]
Elias had told himself it wasn’t his fault. [241]
He’d told himself that for seven years. [246]

The driftwood shifted under his palms, warm as a pulse. [253]
He pressed his ear to the carved figure, and for a breath, he swore he heard the sea whisper *liar*. [266]
The terrace’s iron railing groaned in the wind, a sound like a man clearing his throat to speak. [280]
Elias exhaled, slow and measured, the way he did when a client’s grief threatened to unravel the fiction he’d sold them. [299]
But this time, the quiet wasn’t for them. [305]
It was for Harkin. [307]

He pulled the watch hand free, its gears still as a held breath. [315]
Seven years of guilt had honed his skill at manufacturing memories—he could weave a past so seamless even the bereaved would swear it was real. [333]
Yet here, with the tide erasing his footprints, he realized he’d never once tried to reconstruct Harkin’s end. [350]
Not because he couldn’t, but because the truth might be lighter than the lie. [360]

A wave crashed. [362]
Elias closed his fingers around the watch hand and hurled it into the surf. [372]
The metal vanished without a ripple, as if the sea had been waiting. [381]
He didn’t move, even as the driftwood at his feet split cleanly down the middle, revealing a hollow where a single sheet of paper had been tucked—yellowed, but unmarked by salt. [405]
His name was scrawled across it in Harkin’s looping script. [414]
Beneath it, a date. [416]
Tomorrow’s. [417]

The terrace’s cobalt tiles suddenly felt too bright, too exposed. [424]
Elias’s breath came shallow, the way it did when a client’s story unraveled before his eyes. [438]
He’d spent a career quenching the thirst for truth, only to learn it had been lapping at his ankles all along. [455]
The paper trembled in his grip. [459]
Somewhere beyond the shore, a bell tolled—once, twice—like a man counting the seconds before he speaks. [476]
Elias folded the note into his pocket, beside the ghost of the watch hand. [487]
He would go. [489]
Not for absolution, but because the weight of a withheld truth had finally tipped the scales. [504]

Dusk bled into night as he descended the terrace steps, each one echoing like a name called out too late. [520]
The shore behind him was empty now, the driftwood just wood again. [531]
But the sea kept its secrets the way Elias once had: not with malice, but because some things, once spoken, could never be unsaid. [552]
He walked until the cobalt tiles faded into the dark, and the only sound was the hush of waves sifting through the silence. [572]
