The mirror maker knelt in the ruined orchard, his calloused fingers tracing the cracked lens of the astronomer’s broken sextant. [20]

Frost clung to the gnarled trees like shattered glass, their branches skeletal against the twilight’s pale shimmer, as if the world itself had been etched by a careless hand. [45]

He had come here—not for salvage, but for silence—for the fog that coiled through the district was thick enough to muffle even memory, and memory was what he needed to escape. [75]

The sextant’s brass frame was cold, its once-precise angles now warped by time, but when he pressed it to his palm, he felt the faintest hum, like a dream struggling to be recalled. [105]

His workshop stood half a mile away, its walls lined with mirrors that refused to reflect anything but the fog outside, no matter how he polished them. [135]

The astronomer had been his brother once, before the boundaries between them blurred—before the man’s obsession with mapping the heavens had pulled him into the sky like a runaway kite. [165]

*"You’ll never catch what you chase,"* the mirror maker had told him, but the warning had dissolved into the fog, just like everything else. [185]

Now, he exhaled slowly, watching his breath curl white in the frigid air, and began the work of recreation—not with tools, but with rhythm. [210]

The method had come to him in a half-dream: synchronized breathing, his inhales matching the imagined pulse of his brother’s lost heart, his exhales shaping the fog into something tangible. [240]

The sextant trembled in his grip as the frost on its surface began to melt, not from warmth, but from the pressure of his will, the metal groaning as it bent back toward its original form. [275]

Around him, the orchard seemed to hold its breath—the trees no longer skeletal but shimmering, their branches weaving into the shape of constellations his brother had once charted. [305]

A mirror lay face-up in the dirt, its surface still blank, but when he angled the sextant over it, the glass didn’t reflect the sky. [330]

It reflected *him*—not as he was, but as he had been: a boy with his brother’s hand on his shoulder, both of them staring upward, the line between earth and heaven so thin it might as well not exist. [365]

The fog thickened, pressing in like a second skin, and for the first time in years, he didn’t resist it. [380]

If boundaries were the problem, then erasure was the answer. [390]

He breathed deeper, the sextant growing lighter in his hands, its weight shifting from brass to something more fluid, more *alive*. [415]

The mirror’s surface rippled. [417]

His brother’s voice emerged from the glass—not as an echo, but as a current, pulling him forward. [435]

*"You were always too grounded,"* the voice murmured, *"but grounding is just another kind of flight if you know how to look."* [460]

The mirror maker didn’t answer. [463]

Instead, he let the fog take him, let the sextant dissolve into his palms like frost under sunlight, let the last boundary—the one between holding on and letting go—fade into the twilight’s glow. [495]

When the orchard exhaled, the trees bore fruit again, not of apples, but of light—tiny, fragile stars resting in the crooks of their branches. [520]

He reached for one. [522]

It didn’t burn. [524]

It *remembered*. [525]

And so, for the first time in centuries, did he. [530]

The fog lifted just enough to show him the path home, but he no longer needed it. [545]

The mirror in his pocket was whole now, its surface smooth as still water, reflecting nothing and everything at once. [565]

He walked back to his workshop, where the walls no longer held mirrors but windows, and through them, the sky was no longer a boundary, but a door. [595]

He stepped through. [597]

The stars welcomed him like an old dream, finally caught. [604]
