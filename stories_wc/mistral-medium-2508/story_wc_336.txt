The first light of spring trembled on the parapet where Elias stood, his calloused hands cradling a single heirloom seed—its shell veined with silver like a whispered secret. [30]

Below, the waterfall roared in quiet defiance, its mist curling around the gnarled apple trees he had tended for half a century, their branches heavy with the promise of blossoms not yet dared. [57]

Elias was the last of the pruners who remembered how to listen, who knew that every cut was a conversation, every graft a bridge between what was and what could be. [83]

The villagers called him wise, though he never corrected them when they mistook his silence for patience—it was hunger, really, an insatiable craving to shape the unseen. [107]

That morning, the seed pulsed in his palm, warm as a heartbeat, and he understood: it was not meant for soil. [125]

His grandmother had left it to him with a warning—*"Some doors open inward"*—and now, as the hush of budding hope thickened the air, he knew its time had come. [147]

The parapet’s moss-slick stones led to a cleft in the cliffside, where the waterfall’s breath gathered into a shimmering veil. [164]

Elias stepped through. [166]

The world beyond was not another place, but another *layer*—the orchard stretched endlessly, its trees laden with fruit that glowed like captured sunsets, their colors too vivid for mortal eyes. [188]

A child crouched beneath one, her ribs sharp through her threadbare dress, plucking a fallen apple that dimmed as she touched it. [205]

*"They fade here,"* she whispered. *"Like us."* [211]

Elias knelt beside her, his pruning knife humming against his thigh. [218]

He had spent a lifetime capturing essence—not in jars or paintings, but in the curve of a branch, the angle of a cut, coaxing trees to hold the light just a little longer. [241]

Now, he pressed the heirloom seed into the girl’s palm. *"Plant it where the veil is thin. It’ll remember the color."* [258]

She clutched it, eyes wide. *"But what about you?"* [263]

Elias smiled. The parapet’s edge was still behind him, the real orchard waiting with its quiet, stubborn roots. [277]

He reached for a low-hanging bough, its fruit heavy with the hue of twilight, and sliced—not to take, but to *give*. [291]

The juice that bled onto his fingers was thick, electric, and as he painted it onto the girl’s wrists, her skin drank it in, her edges sharpening into focus. [311]

*"You’ll carry it back,"* he said. *"The wonder. The *weight* of it."* [320]

The child vanished first, the seed clutched to her chest, and Elias followed, the veil resisting just enough to remind him this was a theft, a kindness with teeth. [340]

He emerged gasping onto the parapet, the orchard below unchanged—except one sapling, slender and silver-leafed, sprouting where none had been before. [358]

The villagers would call it a miracle. [362]

Elias would call it a debt. [365]

That night, as he sharpened his blade by firelight, the girl’s voice lingered in the embers: *"The trees there are lonely."* [380]

He tested the knife’s edge against his thumb, watching the blood well up bright and unbroken. [390]

There were other seeds. [392]

Other veils. [393]

The waterfall’s song rose like a question, and Elias—who had spent a lifetime shaping what grew—finally let himself wonder what might grow *him*. [410]

By dawn, he was gone, leaving only a single apple on the windowsill, its skin striped with colors no one had names for. [428]

The villagers ate it in silence, and for a moment, their eyes held the same impossible shine. [440]

Then the wind shifted, the waterfall laughed, and the orchard stretched its branches just a little wider. [453]

Somewhere, between the worlds, a pruner’s hands were learning new shapes. [462]

The trees would not forget. [465]

Neither would the girl. [467]

And if you listened closely on still mornings, you could hear the saplings whispering to each other in a language made of light. [480]

Elias had always known the truth: wonder was not something you kept. [488]

It was something you passed through, like a knife through flesh, like a seed through soil—leaving behind only the echo of what it had touched, and the quiet, radiant hush of what might grow. [517]

The orchard bloomed that year in colors the old men swore they’d never seen. [528]

The children, though, recognized them instantly. [532]

They always do. [534]
