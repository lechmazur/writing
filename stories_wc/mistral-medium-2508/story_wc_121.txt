The viaduct hummed beneath Elias’s bare feet, its wet stone slick with rain that still clung to the air like a second skin. [20]

He had always been weightless—not in the way of birds or falling leaves, but as if gravity itself hesitated around him, a breath held between attraction and release. [40]

Tonight, the hesitation was worse. [44]

Between one step and the next, the world stuttered: the neon glow of the viaduct’s arches fractured into jagged shards of light, each fragment a different hour, a different choice. [63]

Elias clenched the ancient clay tablet in his palm, its runes pulsing faintly, warm as a living thing. [75]

The tablet had been his father’s before it was his, passed down through a lineage of men who walked the edges of time, who understood that the labyrinth wasn’t out there—it was in the spaces between breaths, between the drop and the ripple. [100]

*"Retrace,"* the runes whispered, though no sound left them. [106]

He knew what it meant. [109]

The viaduct wasn’t just a bridge; it was a procedural generation of moments, a loop of stone and light that rebuilt itself every time he faltered. [127]

Elias had walked it a hundred times, a thousand—each attempt periodic, eternal, doomed to repeat until he learned. [141]

His motivation wasn’t escape. [144]

It was conquest. [146]

Not of the viaduct, but of the self that kept splitting at the seams, the versions of him that peeled away like wet paper: one who turned back, one who jumped, one who let the fractures swallow him whole. [173]

The darkening brightness of the air pressed closer, the rain’s afterglow bleeding into something thicker, something hungry. [186]

He traced a rune with his thumb—the one shaped like a broken hourglass—and the viaduct shuddered. [198]

The stone beneath him rewound. [201]

Not backward, but *sideways*, into a version of itself where the rain still fell but the light was different, colder. [215]

Elias didn’t resist. [218]

He let the tablet guide him, let the procedural generation stitch the timelines together like a surgeon’s hands closing a wound. [234]

Ahead, a figure stood at the viaduct’s peak—himself, but not. [242]

This Elias wore a coat of patched shadows, his eyes hollow where the runes had burned too deep. [252]

*"You always stop here,"* the other said, voice like static between stations. [261]

Elias tightened his grip. [264]

*"Not this time."* [266]

He lunged. [268]

The collision wasn’t physical. [271]

It was a collapse, a merging, the fractured timelines knitting together with a sound like shattering glass in reverse. [283]

The tablet flared white-hot in his hand, the runes searing into his skin, and for the first time, the viaduct didn’t reset. [299]

It *continued*. [301]

The rain stopped. [303]

The glow of the arches dimmed to embers, then to memory. [309]

Elias stood alone on solid stone, the weight of gravity finally—*finally*—settling around him like an old coat. [325]

He looked at his hands. [328]

The runes were gone. [330]

The tablet had crumbled to dust, its purpose fulfilled. [336]

He had retrace not the path, but the *choice*—the moment his father had first set foot on the viaduct, the moment the labyrinth of self had begun. [354]

Now it was over. [356]

Or perhaps, he thought as the first true dawn he’d ever seen crept over the horizon, it was only beginning. [371]

Elias took a step. [374]

The stone held. [376]

He walked until the viaduct became a road, until the road became a path, until the path led him somewhere he didn’t recognize. [394]

It was enough. [396]

For the first time, the drop had become the ripple, and he was whole. [406]

Behind him, the viaduct glowed one last time—then vanished, as if it had never been. [418]

Elias smiled. [420]

He kept walking. [422]

(And somewhere, in a timeline that no longer existed, a version of him still stood at the viaduct’s edge, watching the rain fall forever.) [440] </story>
