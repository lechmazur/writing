The mist curled around Elias’s ankles as he stepped into the atrium, its glass dome fracturing the last of the twilight into jagged blues. [20]

His breath came shallow—it always did when the dead called. [27]

The hearing aid in his palm was warm, as if still pressed to an ear, its wires frayed but humming with something older than static. [41]

Elias wasn’t supposed to be here. [45]

His job was tracing the living: mapping the flickers of heartbeats in the city’s pulse, flagging those at risk of unraveling before they even knew they were frayed. [63]

But this signal wasn’t a heartbeat. [67]

It was a voice, thin as spider silk, whispering through the hearing aid’s cracked receiver—*"Find her before the mist does."* [81]

He shouldn’t have answered. [84]

Curiosity had always been his flaw, the one trait his supervisors called *persistent* and his ex called *exhausting*. [96]

Now it had led him to this atrium, where the air smelled of damp stone and something metallic, like old blood drying on a coin. [112]

The photograph in his coat pocket was the only clue: a woman in a green dress, her smile too bright for the era’s grainy film, her fingers curled around a child’s shoulder. [129]

The child’s face was smudged away. [132]

Elias adjusted the hearing aid’s frequency, tracking the faint pulse buried in the interference—a rhythm not of life, but of *echo*. [146]

The dead didn’t speak in words. [149]

They spoke in residues. [151]

A heartbeat here, a breath there, stitching together from the static like a message tossed across decades. [162]

*"She’s still here,"* the voice murmured. *"The mist takes the forgotten."* [171]

Elias’s fingers tightened. [173]

He wasn’t a hero. [175]

He was a man who listened too closely, who had spent years assuring the vulnerable that their pulses mattered, that someone was paying attention. [189]

But the dead didn’t need assurance. [193]

They needed *witnesses*. [195]

The mist thickened, swirling into shapes just beyond his vision—hands, maybe, or the edges of a green dress. [207]

Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the hearing aid’s mic. [213]

"If I find her," he said, "what then?" [218]

The static hissed. [220]

Then, softer: *"You bring her back to the photograph."* [226]

He didn’t understand. [228]

But the pulse in the hearing aid sharpened, guiding him toward the atrium’s center, where a single bench sat, its wood silvered with age. [243]

A woman’s glove lay there, green fabric faded to gray. [249]

Elias picked it up. [251]

The moment his fingers brushed the lace, the mist *screamed*. [257]

It wasn’t a sound. [259]

It was a pressure, a thousand voices suddenly pressing against his skull, their words overlapping into a single, desperate plea: *"Remember us."* [274]

He stumbled, the hearing aid slipping— [277]

—and the world went silent. [280]

Then, a child’s laughter. [282]

Elias turned. [284]

The bench was no longer empty. [286]

The woman in the photograph sat there, her green dress vibrant now, her hand resting on the shoulder of a girl with a gap-toothed grin. [303]

The child’s face was no longer smudged. [307]

It was *his*. [309]

Elias’s knees hit the stone. [312]

The hearing aid had stopped humming. [315]

The mist was gone. [317]

The woman smiled, her voice clear as twilight: *"You found us."* [323]

He didn’t know what to say. [326]

He wasn’t a hero. [328]

He was just a man who listened. [331]

But the child—*his* child, somehow—leaned forward and pressed the last photograph into his palm. [342]

On the back, in smudged ink: *"For when you forget."* [348]

The atrium dissolved around him. [351]

When Elias blinked, he was kneeling on cold stone, the hearing aid dead in his hand, the photograph warm against his chest. [365]

The mist had thinned to nothing. [368]

His supervisors would call this a hallucination. [372]

His ex would call it an excuse. [375]

But Elias slipped the photograph into his pocket, beside the glove. [382]

Some echoes weren’t meant to stay buried. [386]

He stood, brushing dust from his knees. [390]

The city’s pulse waited beyond the atrium, a thousand heartbeats needing his attention. [401]

But for the first time, he didn’t feel like he was chasing them. [409]

He felt like they were leading *him*. [413]

Back to his desk. [415]

Back to the static. [417]

Back to the persistent, curious work of listening. [422]

The dead had called. [425]

And for once, he’d answered *right*. [429]

The mist curled around Elias’s ankles as he stepped into the atrium, its glass dome fracturing twilight into jagged blues, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and something older—like pennies left on a corpse’s eyes. [35]

His breath came shallow, as it always did when the dead called. [43]

The hearing aid in his palm hummed faintly, its wires frayed but warm, as if still pressed to an ear that no longer existed. [58]

*"Find her before the mist does,"* it whispered. [63]

Elias wasn’t supposed to hear them. [67]

His job was tracing the living: mapping the fragile heartbeats of the city’s vulnerable, flagging those at risk before they unraveled. [83]

But this signal wasn’t a heartbeat. [87]

It was a voice, thin as spider silk, threaded through decades of static. [96]

Curiosity had always been his undoing—the trait his supervisors called *persistent* and his ex called *reckless*. [110]

Now it had led him here, to this mist-clad atrium where the air tasted of iron and old promises. [123]

The photograph in his pocket was his only clue: a woman in a green dress, her smile too bright for the era’s grainy film, her fingers curled protectively around a child whose face had been smudged away. [144]

Elias adjusted the hearing aid’s frequency, tracking the faint pulse buried in the interference—a rhythm not of life, but of *echo*. [161]

The dead didn’t speak. [164]

They *lingered*. [166]

A breath here, a heartbeat there, stitching together from the static like a message tossed across time. [181]

*"She’s still here,"* the voice murmured. *"The mist takes the forgotten."* [191]

Elias’s fingers tightened. [193]

He wasn’t a hero. [195]

He was a man who listened too closely, who spent his days assuring the vulnerable that their voices mattered, that someone was paying attention. [213]

But the dead didn’t need assurance. [217]

They needed *witnesses*. [219]

The mist thickened, swirling into half-formed shapes—hands, perhaps, or the hem of a green dress. [233]

Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the hearing aid’s mic. [240]

"If I find her," he said, "what then?" [245]

The static hissed. [247]

Then, softer: *"You bring her back to the photograph."* [253]

He didn’t understand. [255]

But the pulse in the hearing aid sharpened, guiding him toward the atrium’s center, where a single bench sat, its wood silvered with age. [274]

A woman’s glove lay there, green fabric faded to gray. [281]

Elias picked it up. [283]

The moment his skin touched the lace, the mist *screamed*—not a sound, but a pressure, a thousand voices suddenly pressing against his skull, their words collapsing into one desperate plea: *"Remember us."* [308]

He stumbled, the hearing aid slipping— [311]

—and the world went silent. [314]

Then, a child’s laughter. [316]

Elias turned. [318]

The bench was no longer empty. [320]

The woman from the photograph sat there, her green dress vibrant now, her hand resting on the shoulder of a gap-toothed girl. [338]

The child’s face was no longer smudged. [342]

It was *his*. [344]

Elias’s knees hit the stone. [347]

The hearing aid had stopped humming. [350]

The mist was gone. [352]

The woman smiled, her voice clear as twilight: *"You found us."* [359]

He didn’t know what to say. [362]

He wasn’t a hero. [364]

He was just a man who listened. [367]

But the child—*his* child—leaned forward and pressed the photograph into his palm. [379]

On the back, in smudged ink: *"For when you forget."* [385]

The atrium dissolved. [387]

When Elias blinked, he was kneeling on cold stone, the hearing aid dead in his hand, the photograph warm against his chest. [404]

His supervisors would call this a hallucination. [409]

His ex would call it an excuse. [412]

But Elias slipped the photograph into his pocket, beside the glove. [422]

Some echoes weren’t meant to stay buried. [426]

He stood, brushing dust from his knees. [430]

The city’s pulse waited beyond the atrium, a thousand heartbeats needing his attention. [442]

But for the first time, he didn’t feel like he was chasing them. [450]

He felt like they were leading *him*. [453]

Back to his desk. [455]

Back to the static. [457]

Back to the work of listening—for the living, and now, for the dead. [465]

The hearing aid flickered once in his palm, as if waking. [470]

Elias adjusted the frequency. [472]

Somewhere, in the mist between heartbeats, a voice whispered his name. [479]

He answered. [481]
