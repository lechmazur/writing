The port city’s breath was salt and rust, its pulse the groan of cranes lifting containers into the labyrinth’s maw. [19]
Daniel had no name here—not since the death certificate with his printed on it had been filed in error, a clerk’s misstroke erasing him from the ledgers of the living. [46]
He moved through the towering stacks like a ghost, his fingers tracing the corrugated steel, each ridge a vein of forgotten cargo. [68]
The mistake had gifted him an odd clarity: he saw the world unfiltered, its edges sharp with the weight of what others overlooked. [91]

The poison bottle’s label was the first fragment he’d collected, peeled from a crate marked *Hazardous*—its warning faded but still legible. [116]
He didn’t know why he’d kept it, only that it hummed against his palm like a secret. [131]
Others might hear the port’s rhythm as chaos, but Daniel heard layers: the tide’s drag, the clatter of forklifts, the murmurs of dockworkers swapping stories between shifts. [157]
He gathered those too, tucking them into the pockets of his coat like shells from a shore no one else visited. [176]

*"They say Container 47-B held a man once,"* a stevedore had muttered over his lunch, *"locked in by accident, found three weeks later with his nails scratched to the bone."* [203]
Daniel had pressed his ear to 47-B’s door that night, listening for echoes, but the only sound was the wind threading through the gaps, whispering in a language of rust. [231]
He layered the story onto the label in his mind, imagining the man’s final hours, the way fear might have warped time into something thick and syrupy. [256]

The labyrinth shifted with the tides, alleys between containers narrowing or vanishing entirely as new shipments arrived. [276]
Daniel navigated by memory, though his own was slipping—names of streets, faces of coworkers, even the taste of his last meal before the certificate had declared him dead. [303]
What remained was the texture of others’ memories, the grain of their voices when they spoke of things they’d buried. [323]

A woman in a frayed scarf told him about the child she’d left behind in another country, her words tangled with the scent of diesel. [345]
*"She’d recognize my hands,"* she’d said, flexing her fingers as if testing their shape. [356]
Daniel took the image, pressed it onto the label like a second skin. [366]
The poison’s warning—*Do Not Ingest*—became a metaphor: some histories were too bitter to swallow whole. [382]

By the third week, he’d stopped sleeping. [388]
The labyrinth didn’t rest; neither did the dead, if the scraps of stories were true. [403]
A night watchman claimed to have seen figures moving in the upper tiers, their silhouettes flickering like bad film. [424]
*"They’re the ones who got lost in the paperwork,"* he’d said, *"same as you."* [439]
Daniel didn’t ask how the man knew. [444]

He began leaving offerings: a button from his old uniform, a receipt from a café that no longer existed, the label now creased with handling. [468]
The containers seemed to lean in when he passed, their metal skins warm as if breathing. [483]
One dawn, he found a new crate in his usual alley, its door ajar. [495]
Inside, a ledger lay open, its pages filled with names crossed out in red ink—his among them. [511]

The handwriting was his own. [515]
He didn’t remember writing it, but the pressure of the pen, the way the *D* in *Daniel* bled into the fibers, felt like a memory surfacing from deep water. [539]
He tore the page free, folded it into the label’s embrace. [549]
The act should have felt like reclaiming, but it was more like shedding, a skin he no longer needed. [566]

That night, the tide came in higher than usual, flooding the lower paths. [578]
Daniel waded through knee-deep water, the label clutched against his chest like a talisman. [592]
At the labyrinth’s heart, where the oldest containers sagged with decay, he pressed the bundle into a crack in the steel. [611]
The metal sighed, or maybe it was the wind. [618]

When he turned to leave, the alleys had rearranged themselves. [626]
No matter. [628]
He knew the way now, or the way knew him—another layer in the port’s endless story. [645]
The death certificate had been a misprint, but the erasure was real, and it had taught him how to listen. [664]
The living left their marks in haste, in carelessness, in the things they whispered when they thought no one was there. [686]
Daniel would collect them, one fragment at a time, until the labyrinth remembered him too. [706]

The first light of dawn caught the label’s edge, turning the faded warning into something like gold. [724]
He didn’t need to read it to know what it said. [732]
Some poisons were meant to be absorbed. [738]
Some histories were meant to be rewritten. [744]
He stepped forward, and the water closed behind him without a ripple. [755]
