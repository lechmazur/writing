The storm had swallowed the coastline whole, and with it, the last flicker of Elias’s GPS—its blue dot winking out like a dying star. [31]

He pressed his palm against the archway’s salt-crusted stone, the wind howling through its jagged mouth like a choir of lost things. [55]

Elias wasn’t supposed to be here. [59]
The festival in Port Veyra had promised buyers for his driftwood—twisted cedar and storm-sculpted pine, reimagined as winged beasts and hollow-eyed saints—but the ferry had turned back, and now he was marooned on this forgotten spit of land, where the archway stood like a ribcage of some ancient leviathan. [116]

His fingers found the lantern slide in his pocket, its brass edges warm as if alive. [129]
He’d bought it from a blind cartographer in the last port, who’d whispered that it held *timewoven alliances*—not images, but moments stitched into light. [153]
Elias had laughed then, but now, as the storm’s turbine-hum filled his skull, he wondered if the old man had been right. [174]

He slid the brass into his palm, turning it over. [180]
The surface shimmered—not with scenes, but with *layers*: a fisherman’s net mending itself, a child’s hand pressing a seashell into wet cement, a woman weaving reeds into a basket that would never hold water but would always remember the shape of the wind. [225]
Each meaning bled into the next, a scaffold of simplicity holding up something vast. [238]

Elias exhaled, his breath curling into the storm. [245]
He was perpetually learning, wasn’t he? [249]
That was the curse and the gift of driftwood—it taught you to see the bones of the world, the way time carved and connected. [268]
The archway groaned as if in answer, its stones humming with the same layered frequency as the slide. [284]

He pressed the lantern to the arch. [288]
Light spilled out—not forward, but *sideways*, threading through the storm like golden stitches. [303]
The wind stilled. [305]
For a heartbeat, Elias saw them: the others who’d stood here, their hands on the same stone. [317]
A sailor, lost in 1812, who’d carved a compass rose into the keystone. [328]
A lighthouse keeper’s daughter, in 1943, who’d left a jar of preserved violets in the crevice, a message to the future. [348]
A climate refugee, just last year, who’d scratched *we were here* into the mortar with a rusted nail. [365]

Their motives weren’t his, but their *need* was—the desire to leave a mark, to say *I saw this too*. [382]
The slide pulsed in his grip, and Elias understood: the archway wasn’t a door. [392]
It was a loom. [394]

He reached for the driftwood in his satchel—a piece of blackthorn, gnarled by a century of tides. [408]
With his knife, he began to carve, not a beast or a saint, but a hand, palm open, fingers stretched toward the next pair of hands that would find this place. [436]
The storm roared approval. [439]

When he pressed the finished piece into the arch’s highest crack, the lantern slide’s light flared once, bright as a struck match. [457]
Then the wind changed. [459]
The path back to Port Veyra unspooled before him, not on a screen, but in the way the waves parted, the way the gulls wheeled left instead of right. [482]

Elias walked, the storm at his back now, pushing him toward the distant glow of the festival. [495]
His pockets were empty—no slide, no GPS—but his hands remembered the weight of the carving, the way the archway had *leaned into* his touch. [519]

At the docks, a woman with a clipboard squinted at him. [526]
“Thought you were lost,” she said. [530]
Elias smiled. [532]
“Not anymore,” he replied, and when she turned to check her list, he slipped a scrap of driftwood into her coat pocket—a tiny boat, its sail a sliver of the archway’s stone. [562]

The storm would come again. [566]
It always did. [568]
But now the archway had another layer, another hand to guide the next lost thing home. [585]
