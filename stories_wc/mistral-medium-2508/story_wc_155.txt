The first time Liora saw the fresco fragment, it was half-buried in the loam of the ruined orchard, its edges soft with moss like a memory half-forgotten. [24]

She knelt, brushing away the damp earth with fingers already stained by the pigments she carried—her own strange paints, mixed not from crushed minerals but from captured light, bottled in glass vials that hummed when shaken. [54]

This district had been abandoned long before she was born, swallowed by the fog that never lifted, its trees skeletal and silvered, their branches heavy with fruit no one dared eat. [85]

The fragment was no larger than her palm, but the figures painted on it were alive in a way that made her breath catch: a child laughing, arms outstretched toward something just beyond the frame, their joy so vivid it seemed to leak into the air like perfume. [124]

Liora had spent years mapping the district’s secrets through the knowledge network—a web of whispers left by other artists, scholars, and drifters who’d passed through the fog, each adding their fragment of truth to the collective murk. [163]

She knew the stories: that the orchard had once been a place of festivals, where people danced until their shadows blurred into the dusk, where the air itself had been thick with the scent of ripening peaches and the buzz of shared laughter. [203]

But no one remembered why it had been abandoned, only that the fog had come, and with it, a quiet so deep it felt like grief. [224]

She carried the fragment to her studio—a crumbling greenhouse where the glass panes were patched with waxed canvas, where the light slanted in strange, liquid ways. [247]

There, she set it on her worktable beside the exposed film she’d been developing, the emulsion still wet and sensitive, hungry for impressions. [265]

Liora had always painted with light because it was the only medium that didn’t lie; it carried the weight of what had been, the ghost of moments already passed. [286]

She placed the fragment against the film, pressing them together like lovers in a dance, and waited. [299]

The image that emerged was not just the child from the fresco, but the orchard as it had been: golden, alive, the trees heavy with fruit that glowed from within, the people moving in a blur of color and motion, their joy so bright it hurt. [337]

It was a daydream made solid, a fold in time she could almost step into—if she dared. [350]

Liora’s hands trembled as she peeled the film away, the fresco fragment now warm to the touch, as if it had been waiting for this moment. [368]

She knew what she had to do. [372]

By dusk, she had strung the exposed film between the dead trees, letting the wind animate the images like banners in a procession. [389]

The knowledge network hummed to life as others in the fog-bound district sensed the shift—artists, wanderers, the curious and the lonely—drawn by the pull of something they couldn’t name. [413]

They came silently, their breath misting in the cold, their eyes wide as the film caught the last of the day’s light and projected it onto the fog itself, turning the air into a canvas. [439]

The orchard bloomed around them. [442]

For a breath, for a heartbeat, the past and present overlapped: the laughter of the child from the fresco echoed in the hollows of the ruined trees, the scent of peaches filled the lungs of the onlookers, and the fog thinned, just enough to let the dying sun paint everything in gold. [478]

Liora watched as a woman reached out, her fingers passing through the projection of a dancer mid-twirl, her own face alight with something long buried. [497]

This was why she painted with light—to rediscover lost joy, to stitch the torn edges of time back together, if only for a moment. [516]

The film would fade by morning, the images dissolving like sugar in rain, but that didn’t matter. [530]

The knowledge network would carry the memory forward, another thread in the ever-growing tapestry of what had been and what could be again. [554]

As the last of the light winked out, Liora tucked the fresco fragment into her pocket, its edges now smooth with handling, its secret shared. [573]

The fog rolled back in, thick and familiar, but the orchard no longer felt like a ruin. [583]

It felt like a promise. [586]

She smiled, her breath curling into the dark, and began to mix new paints. [595]
