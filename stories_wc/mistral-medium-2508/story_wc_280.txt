The orchard hummed in the dark, its gnarled trees heavy with fruit that shimmered like bruised silver under a three-quarter moon. [20]

Lydia had been dead for seventy-three years, but the stage still called her—an itch in the bones, a whisper in the wings—and tonight, she’d followed it into the hedge maze behind the old theater, where time folded like a careless handkerchief. [57]

Her fingers brushed the bark of an apple tree, and the contact sang through her: the taste of burnt caramel, the scent of a violin’s first trembling note. [78]

Synesthesia had been her curse in life, her gift in death. [86]

She plucked a fruit, and the moment it left the branch, the orchard sighed—a sound that wasn’t sound but the color of dusk dissolving into indigo, the weight of a held breath. [110]

Tucked in her pocket was the tarot coin, hand-painted with a winking fool on one side and a weeping king on the other, the edges worn smooth from decades of anxious rubbing. [133]

It had been her prop once, a trick to make the audience lean in, but now it was the only thing anchoring her to the timeline she’d fractured the night she died—mid-bow, mid-note, mid-*breath*—when the chandelier’s chain snapped. [165]

The maze shifted. [167]

A path that hadn’t been there before unspooled between the trees, lined with petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause. [183]

Lydia followed, because that was the rule: when the garden offered a way, you took it. [195]

At the center stood a man—no, a *boy*, really—perched on a stone bench, his shoulders hunched as if bracing for a blow. [210]

His name was Elias, and he’d come here to end things, a bottle of pills clutched in his shaking hand. [223]

Lydia recognized the set of his jaw, the hollow look in his eyes. [230]

She’d worn that same expression once, before the stage lights blurred into halos and the music became something she could *hold*. [245]

“You’re in the wrong act,” she murmured, and her voice was the sound of a record spinning backward, of a match struck in a draft. [260]

Elias didn’t look up. [262]

She sat beside him and rolled the tarot coin across her knuckles, letting the echoes of its past lives bleed into the air: the clink of a gambler’s luck, the gasp of a crowd, the *thud* of her own body hitting the floorboards. [287]

The boy flinched. [289]

“Listen,” she said, and intertwined her fingers with the branches above them, pulling the timeline taut between her hands like a thread. [305]

The orchard obeyed. [307]

A memory unfurled—not hers, not his, but a *possibility*: Elias at twenty-five, laughing as he painted a mural on a brick wall, his sleeves rolled up, his hair streaked with sunlight. [328]

Then another: Elias at forty, holding a child’s hand, the weight of their grip the only thing keeping him from floating away. [344]

The visions tangled with the present, synesthetic and overwhelming—the taste of chalk, the smell of rain on hot pavement, the *pressure* of a life not yet lived pressing against his ribs. [365]

Elias exhaled, sharp. [367]

“How?” [368]

Lydia pressed the coin into his palm. [370]

“You carry the despair,” she said. “But the garden carries the *rest*.” [378]

The trees leaned in, their leaves whispering secrets in a language of color and sound, the air thick with the scent of old roses and greasepaint. [394]

Elias’s fingers closed around the coin. [397]

When he looked up, Lydia was already fading, her edges softening like a watercolor left in the rain. [408]

The orchard held its breath. [411]

Then the boy stood, pocketed the pills, and stepped forward—into the maze, into the dark, into the *next act*. [425]

Behind him, the path sealed shut, the petals dissolving into mist. [432]

Lydia lingered just long enough to hear the echo of his heartbeat, steady now, a metronome counting down the seconds until he’d forget this ever happened. [450]

It was always like this. [453]

She was never the star of someone else’s story, only the ghost in the wings, the nudge between despair and *what came next*. [470]

The coin would find its way back to her eventually. [475]

It always did. [477]

She turned toward the distant glow of the theater’s ghost light, where the stage waited, empty and endless. [488]

Some encores were quieter than others. [492]

Some were just a hand on a shoulder in the dark, a coin passed between strangers, a timeline stitched back together with echoes and orchard magic. [514]

Lydia smiled. [516]

The curtain would rise again soon. [520]

And this time, she’d be ready. [523]

The trees swayed in approval, their branches clapping like an audience that would never leave. [537]

She bowed anyway. [539]

The night swallowed her whole. [542]

Somewhere, a violin began to play. [546]

The music tasted like hope. [549] </story>
