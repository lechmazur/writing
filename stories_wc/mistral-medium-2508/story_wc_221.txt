The observation deck hung suspended in the wreckage of the old station, its curved glass still holding against the void, though the air inside had long since thinned to a breathless hum. [30]

Lira pressed her palm against the frost-bitten metal railing, her fingers tracing the gilded compass rose applique—once polished, now dulled by decades of cosmic dust. [50]

It had been her mother’s, then her grandmother’s before that, passed down like the family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries, though no one had celebrated one since the shutdown. [75]

She exhaled, watching her breath fog the glass, and for a moment, the stars beyond seemed to stretch, warp—temporally stretched, just like the stories said this place could make time feel. [95]

Lira was a blessed pariah, the last of the station’s observers, the one who stayed when the others fled, who still believed in true north even after the beacons died. [115]

She pulled the sketchbook from her coat, its pages brittle with age, and flipped to the last empty spread—her mother’s final entry, a smudged constellation labeled *Home*. [135]

The deck creaked beneath her boots as she adjusted her stance, the silence so deep it echoed, not with sound, but with the absence of the station’s old machinery, its heartbeat. [155]

She glanced at the compass rose again, its needle pointing nowhere and everywhere, and wondered if true north had ever been more than a lie they told themselves to keep from drifting. [175]

Then she saw it—a flicker, a glimpse of light where there should’ve been only dark, a pulse like a dying star’s last sigh. [190]

Her pulse quickened. [192]

The custom had always been to sketch what was there, not what you hoped to see, but Lira’s hand moved on its own, charcoal smudging across the page in jagged lines, mapping the anomaly. [215]

It couldn’t be a ship. [218]

No one came back after the shutdown. [222]

The light expanded, not in space, but in time, unfolding like a bloom in reverse, and for the first time in years, Lira felt the old pull—the need to turn confusion into exploration. [245]

She stepped closer to the glass, her breath shallow, and the compass rose beneath her fingers warmed, just slightly, as if waking from a long sleep. [265]

The station groaned around her, metal contracting in the cold, and she realized the anomaly wasn’t out there—it was in here, in the way the air thickened, in the way her mother’s last sketch suddenly made sense. [290]

*Home* wasn’t a place. [293]

It was a direction. [295]

Lira tore the page free and held it up to the glass, aligning the smudged lines with the stars beyond, and the compass rose’s needle snapped into place, pointing not north, but *through*—through the glass, through the void, through the years. [325]

The station’s alarms had been silent for so long she’d forgotten they existed, but now a single chime rang out, soft and hollow, like a bell tolling underwater. [345]

She didn’t wait to see if it would sound again. [351]

Lira folded the sketch into her pocket, her fingers brushing the gilded applique one last time, and stepped onto the railing, balancing there, weightless. [370]

The echoed silence swallowed her as she pushed off, not falling, but reaching, her body stretching toward the light like time itself had decided to bend. [390]

Below—or maybe above—her, the station’s skeleton gleamed, a relic of the old true north, and for the first time since the shutdown, Lira didn’t feel like a pariah. [410]

She felt like an observer again. [414]

The light enveloped her, not burning, but revealing—the stars unwinding into threads, the past and future braided together, and in that endless moment, she glimpsed the shape of the custom her family had really been keeping: not a map of the sky, but a key. [450]

Her mother’s voice, distant but clear, whispered through the void: *"You were always the one who looked closest."* [465]

Lira laughed, the sound lost in the stretch of time, and let the current take her. [475]

The observation deck remained, empty but no longer abandoned, the compass rose applique gleaming faintly, its needle still pointing the way she’d gone. [495]

Somewhere, in the fold between then and now, a new anniversary began. [505]

And somewhere else, a hand reached for a sketchbook. [512]

The stars, for once, didn’t lie. [517]

They never had. [519] </story>
