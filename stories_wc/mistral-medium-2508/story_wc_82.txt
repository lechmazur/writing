The lantern maker’s fingers trembled as she pressed the last gem into the basilica’s spine, its facets catching the dying light like a breath held too long. [24]

The floating isle of Veyl had been sinking for years—not into the sea below, but *through* it, as if the weight of its sorrow had bent gravity itself into a spiral. [48]

She had built the glass basilica to record the dreams of the dead, each pane etched with the last whispers of those who’d slipped into the mist before their time. [74]

Her daughter’s voice was in there somewhere, trapped in the stained-glass veins of the sanctuary, a hum just beyond hearing. [95]

The tea garden at the isle’s edge had once been a place of quiet joy, where steam curled like unspoken promises between cupped hands. [117]

Now it was a graveyard of origami cranes, each one folded from the parchment of old love letters, their wings brittle with salt and grief. [138]

She polished the final gem—a smoky quartz, clouded with the residue of a thousand half-remembered dreams—against her sleeve, feeling the way it *pulled* at her skin, hungry. [162]

The shadow had detached three nights prior: a clean, surgical severing, as if someone had taken a blade to the bond between her and the world. [185]

That was when the basilica began to *descend while ascending*, its spires stretching toward the sky even as its foundations sank into the isle’s rotting heart. [208]

She knew what it wanted. [212]

The lanterns she crafted were not for light, but for *recording*—each one a hollow vessel to sip the dreams of the living before they, too, dissolved into the mist. [235]

Tonight, she would transform the last of them. [240]

The gem thrummed in her palm as she pressed it into the basilica’s central pillar, where the glass was thinnest, where the dreams bled together like watercolors in the rain. [265]

A breath. [267]

Then the walls *sighed*. [269]

The tea garden’s stones shifted beneath her knees, the cranes rustling as if stirred by a wind that wasn’t there. [283]

She had spent years folding her grief into something small enough to carry, but grief was a stubborn thing—it unfolded itself in the dark, creeping back into the shape of a child’s laughter, a half-finished cup of tea. [313]

The basilica’s glass rippled. [316]

Inside, the dreams of the dead coiled and unspooled, threading through the air like silk, like the last exhale of a drowning man. [334]

She reached out. [336]

Her fingers passed through the nearest pane, and for a moment, she was twelve again, her daughter’s hand warm in hers, the isle still whole, the sky still a place you could trust. [361]

Then the gem *bit* down. [364]

Pain lanced up her arm, luminous and white-hot, the kind that didn’t just hurt but *rewrote*—peeling back her skin to show the dream-stuff beneath. [385]

She was becoming part of the recording. [389]

The basilica groaned, its descent quickening, the isle’s tea garden tilting like a ship taking on water. [403]

The cranes took flight. [405]

Not as paper, but as something lighter, something made of the same substance as the dreams in the glass—fragile, glowing, *alive*. [423]

They spiraled upward, weaving through the basilica’s spires, and she understood: the isle wasn’t sinking. [439]

It was *unfolding*. [441]

Her daughter’s voice spilled from the glass at last, not as an echo, but as a hand pulling her deeper into the light. [457]

The lantern maker let go. [459]

The last thing she saw was the tea garden blooming beneath her, petals of steam and shadow, the cranes carrying the weight of every dream she’d ever caught—including, finally, her own. [488]

The basilica completed its transformation then, no longer glass but something softer, something that breathed. [506]

And the isle, which had been descending for so long, found itself—at last—rising. [518]

Not toward the sky. [520]

But into the place where dreams are kept. [524] </story>
