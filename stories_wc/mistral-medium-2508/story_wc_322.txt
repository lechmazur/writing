The gallery smelled of beeswax and old paper, a scent that clung to Elias like a second skin as he stepped over the threshold. [19]
Each wall pulsed with geometries that shouldn’t exist—angles that bent inward, colors that shifted when stared at too long, a labyrinth of rational enchantment designed to unravel perception. [43]
He wasn’t here as a visitor, though the curator had listed him as one; Elias was a fever dream architect, and this place, *The Hollow Perspective*, was his most ambitious illusion yet. [70]
His fingers twitched toward the sinew thread coiled in his pocket, a filament spun from his own memories—realistically imaginary, pliable as thought but sharp as glass when pulled taut. [98]
The thread was the key, the method by which he wove patterns into the air itself, stitching moments into the gallery’s bones so they’d erupt when triggered. [125]

A woman in a charcoal-gray coat stood before *The Möbius Mirror*, her reflection reaching out to touch her shoulder before dissolving into static. [146]
“You’re late,” she said without turning, her voice the kind of quiet that hummed in empty rooms. [157]
Elias didn’t answer. [159]
Time here didn’t obey clocks; it stretched and thinned as memories altered, and he’d been lost in the act of threading a childhood sunset into the corner where the floor met the ceiling. [188]
The sunset was his mother’s last gift to him—a postcard from a place she’d never been—and he’d spent three days unspooling its light into the gallery’s framework, testing how grief could be made tangible. [221]
The woman finally turned, her irises fractal with shifting depths. [228]
“They’re coming to dismantle it,” she said. [233]
“Let them.” [235]
His pulse didn’t quicken. [237]
The unsettling calm of the gallery had long since seeped into his veins; he knew the cost of building something meant to be undone. [253]
The thread in his pocket burned colder. [257]

He stepped toward the centerpiece—a void framed in gilded wood, its darkness not absent of light but *composed* of it, a blackness that hummed. [275]
This was where the patterns would erupt, where the woven moments would unravel all at once and the visitors would finally *feel* the texture of connection: the way a stranger’s sigh could braid with your own, how a shared silence was never just silence. [308]
The woman watched as he pulled the sinew thread free, its length shimmering with embedded fragments—a child’s laughter, the scent of rain on hot pavement, the pressure of a hand letting go. [336]
“You’re not just preserving memories,” she murmured. [342]
“No,” he admitted, threading the filament into the void’s edge. [349]
“I’m proving they were never ours to begin with.” [356]

The first tremor came as the gallery’s walls breathed inward. [361]
The patterns Elias had woven—months of stolen glances, half-remembered conversations, the weight of a name on the tip of your tongue—began to erupt, not as chaos but as revelation. [386]
A man in the corner gasped as his reflection aged twenty years in a blink; a couple clutched each other as the air between them thickened with the scent of jasmine, a perfume one of them had worn in a life they couldn’t recall. [418]
The woman in gray smiled, her fingers brushing the sinew thread where it now spiderwebbed across the ceiling. [430]
“Beautiful,” she said, though her voice was already dissolving into the hum of the gallery, into the collective exhalation of strangers recognizing themselves in one another. [452]

Elias closed his eyes as the last thread snapped. [457]
The optical illusions didn’t fade—they *resolved*, the rational enchantment complete. [465]
When he opened his eyes again, the gallery was just a room, the visitors just people, and the void just an empty frame. [479]
But the woman in gray was still there, her hand outstretched. [485]
“Again?” she asked. [487]
He took her hand. [489]
Somewhere, a child laughed; somewhere else, someone wept. [496]
The sinew thread was already reforming in his pocket, hungry for the next pattern. [505]
Outside, the city pulsed on, oblivious to the quiet eruption of connection it had just witnessed—realistically imaginary, and real all the same. [525]
