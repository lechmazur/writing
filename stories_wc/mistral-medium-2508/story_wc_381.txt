The summoner knelt by the brook, her fingers tracing the water’s surface as if reading a forgotten tongue. [19]

Each ripple carried a fragment of the prophecy—spoken not in words, but in the spaces between them, a code woven into the hush of the night. [39]

She had spent years chasing its echoes, from the wind-scoured cliffs of the highlands to this nocturnal haven, where the brook whispered secrets to the reeds. [60]

Tonight, the air hummed with a terrestrially cosmic tension, the kind that made the earth feel like a living pulse beneath her bare feet. [79]

Her satchel held only one tool: a crane’s origami wing, its folds sharp enough to cut silence. [93]

She unfolded it now, letting the paper drink in the moonlight until its edges glowed faint with the same eerie light that clung to the brook’s stones. [115]

The prophecy had come to her in a dream—no, not a dream, a *flow*, a current of images that pulled her toward this place, this moment. [134]

It showed her a world unraveling at the seams, not by fire or flood, but by the weight of its own unspoken fears. [151]

To hush it, she had to map the silence. [157]

She pressed the origami wing to the water, and the brook stilled as if holding its breath. [169]

The paper drank in the reflections—the bent willow, the scatter of stars, the summoner’s own hollow-eyed stare—and began to *unfold* in reverse. [186]

Not back into a flat sheet, but outward, into something vast and skeletal, a lattice of light that hung above the water like a half-remembered constellation. [208]

The prophecy’s code slithered through the gaps, a serpent of soundless syllables. [218]

She had to catch it before it dissolved into the night. [226]

Her hands moved in patterns older than speech, shaping the silence into a net of smoothed hush. [239]

The brook’s murmur deepened, its rhythm syncing with her breath, the two of them weaving a counter-spell from the absence of noise. [257]

The origami wing trembled, its edges bleeding silver into the air. [266]

Then—*snap*. [268]

A single thread of the prophecy broke free, writhing like a live thing. [276]

She lunged, but it slipped through her fingers, searing her skin with cold. [285]

The night gasped. [287]

The brook’s surface shattered into a thousand glittering shards, each one a stolen secret, a piece of the world’s unraveling. [303]

The summoner clenched her fists, her solitude pressing in like a second skin. [312]

She had failed. [314]

Or so she thought, until the origami wing—now a tattered, glowing thing—drifted back to her palm. [327]

It was lighter. [329]

Not empty, but *quiet*. [331]

The prophecy’s weight had lessened, its edges softened by the hush she’d spun. [341]

It wasn’t gone. [343]

But it was no longer a scream. [346]

Just a sigh. [348]

She exhaled, her breath curling into the nocturnal air like smoke. [355]

The brook resumed its murmuring, the reeds swaying as if nothing had changed. [365]

Yet the world felt different—softer, as though the edges of fear had been sanded down by the night’s tranquil blaze. [380]

She folded the origami wing back into her satchel, its creases now holding the shape of a silence that could breathe. [398]

Dawn would come soon, and with it, the noise of the waking world. [407]

But for now, in this haven beside the quiet brook, the prophecy slept. [417]

And so, for the first time in years, did she. [423]

The summoner lay down on the damp earth, her cheek against the moss, and let the smoothed hush carry her under. [438]

Above her, the stars pulsed in their terrestrially cosmic rhythm, indifferent and kind. [450]

The brook sang its secrets to the dark. [455]

And the night, at last, kept them. [459]

When she woke, the origami wing would be just paper again. [467]

But the silence would remain. [470]

And that was enough. [473]

She closed her eyes. [475]

The world turned. [477]

The prophecy dreamed. [479]

And the summoner, solitary no longer, rested in the heart of the hush she had made. [491]

Somewhere, a crane took flight at dawn, its wings cutting through the mist like the first word of a new language. [511]

She didn’t see it. [514]

But she felt the shadow of its passing, a benediction, a promise. [523]

The brook carried it away. [527]

The reeds bowed. [530]

And the night, with its whispered secrets and tranquil blaze, held her one last time before dissolving into gold. [546]

She would walk again when the sun climbed higher. [553]

But for now, she was still. [556]

For now, she was whole. [559]

For now, the hush was hers. [563]

And it was perfect. [565]
