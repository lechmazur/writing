The bunker had been swallowing its own echoes for decades, its rusted hatch half-buried under ivy so thick the metal groaned when Lior pushed it open. [30]

Inside, the air smelled of damp earth and something older—ozone, maybe, or the ghost of machine oil long since evaporated. [45]

She’d come because the storm was coming, not the kind that split trees but the kind that split time, the kind her grandmother had warned her about in riddles. [65]

*"Some paths choose,"* the old woman had said, her fingers tracing the wafer seal pressed into Lior’s palm like a communion host. [80]

The seal was warm now, pulsing faintly against her skin as she stepped over roots that had forced their way through the bunker’s cracked floor. [97]

The walls were lined with peeling murals—*precise* in their geometry, *playful* in their distortions—depicting figures mid-stride, their faces blurred as if caught between becoming and unbecoming. [118]

Lior knew the directive had decayed before she even found the terminal. [127]

Its screen flickered with static, then resolved into a single line: **"INTERPRET THE DREAMER BEFORE THE DREAM INTERPRETS YOU."** [140]

She exhaled, her breath fogging the glass. [144]

The wafer seal burned hotter. [146]

She pressed it to the terminal’s reader, and the machine whirred, spitting out a reel of film—her film, though she’d never seen it before. [160]

The footage showed a younger version of herself standing at a crossroads in the rewilded forest, three paths diverging, each overgrown with vines that writhed like living things. [180]

In the dream-version, she chose left. [184]

In waking life, she’d gone right. [187]

The film stuttered, then showed the left path *choosing her*—vines lashing out, pulling dream-Lior into the undergrowth while the other two routes collapsed into dust. [208]

Her hands shook. [210]

The storm outside wasn’t just wind anymore; it was a low, thrumming pressure in her bones, the kind that preceded revelations. [224]

The terminal beeped. **"TRANSCENDENCE REQUIRES A SACRIFICE OF CERTAINTY."** [232]

Lior understood then: the bunker wasn’t a refuge. [238]

It was a test. [240]

The wafer seal wasn’t a key—it was a *marker*, a way for the path to recognize its walker across time. [253]

She closed her eyes and let the storm’s electric hum sync with her pulse. [260]

When she opened them, the murals had changed. [264]

The figures were no longer blurred. [266]

They were *her*, in a hundred possible lives, each one a thread of the same tapestry. [275]

One version of her turned from the screen, met her gaze, and smiled. [282]

*"You were always the one who asked why,"* the other Lior said, her voice like wind through dead leaves. [292]

*"But paths don’t explain themselves. They* feel. *They* hunger. *"* [299]

The terminal’s final message scrolled: **"TO KNOW THE ANSWER IS TO CEASE ASKING."** [308]

Lior reached out—not to the dream, not to the past, but to the storm. [316]

The moment her fingers brushed the bunker’s corroded wall, the metal dissolved into vines, the floor into loam, the ceiling into sky. [330]

She was standing in the forest again, but the crossroads was gone. [337]

In its place, a single path stretched ahead, overgrown but unmistakable, the air above it shimmering like heat haze. [349]

The wafer seal had turned to ash in her palm. [353]

She didn’t need it anymore. [355]

Somewhere in the distance, thunder laughed. [359]

Lior stepped forward, and the path stepped back, then forward again—a dance, a negotiation. [370]

For the first time, she didn’t wonder where it led. [375]

She only wondered how far she’d go before she realized she’d been walking in circles all along. [386]

The storm broke as she began to run, not away, but *through*, her laughter lost in the downpour. [398]

The forest swallowed her whole. [401]

And the path, finally, chose. [403]
