The tide dancer moved through the twilight garden like a blade unsheathed, her bare feet tracing arcs in the damp earth where the last light bled into shadow. [30]

She had been exiled by choice—not cast out, but severed from the rhythms of the sea by her own hand, a penance for reading the tides too well. [55]

In her palm, a speck of moonstone cabochon dust glinted, the last remnant of a jewel she’d ground down years ago, when the nostalgia ban still held the coast in its grip. [80]

The dust was spontaneously anchored to her skin, refusing to scatter no matter how she flexed her fingers, as if the stars themselves had stitched it there. [105]

Tonight, she would fledge. [110]

Not with wings, but with ink—a cosmic verse etched into mortal flesh, the kind that made the sky jealous. [125]

She knelt beside the blackened pond where waterlilies curled like clenched fists, their edges sharp enough to draw blood. [140]

The method demanded silence, demanded gaps: the pause between breaths, the hollow where the wind failed, the space a heartbeat left behind. [160]

She watched. [162]

A heron, skeletal in the dim, stepped into the void between two reeds and did not reappear. [175]

A child’s laughter, long ago, had once filled that same silence—before the ban, before she learned that memory was a kind of drowning. [195]

Her fingers trembled as she dipped them into the pond, not for water, but for the reflection of Orion’s belt fractured on the surface. [215]

The verse would begin at the wrist, where the veins ran closest to the skin, where the pulse could carry the words like a current. [235]

She pressed the moonstone dust to her arm, and it bit deep, not with pain but with hunger, as if it had been waiting for this moment since the first tide. [260]

The ink would be her blood, the quill her own breath held too long. [270]

Around her, the garden exhaled—the scent of crushed nightshade, the whisper of petals unraveling like old secrets. [285]

She had spent a lifetime learning to move between the cracks of the world, but this was different. [300]

This was not slipping through; this was becoming the gap itself. [310]

The first line bloomed under her fingertips, a sigil of obsidian grace: *"I was the shore before the wave decided to return."* [330]

The words burned as they settled, not with fire, but with the cold weight of something finally true. [345]

Her breath came in measured pulls, each one a bridge between what she had been and what she would write into existence. [365]

The stars above leaned closer, their light not falling but *being drawn*, as if the verse were a net cast into the dark. [385]

She had always known the sea would not take her back—not after she’d chosen the silence over its song. [405]

But the sky had no such pride. [410]

By the time the last stroke dried, her skin was no longer hers alone. [420]

It was a map. [422]

A confession. [423]

A fleeting, fragile thing, like the moment between diving and the impact of the water—when the body is neither here nor there, but perfectly, terribly free. [450]

The tide dancer stood, her arms outstretched, the verse now a second pulse beneath her skin. [460]

The garden held its breath. [463]

Somewhere beyond the ban, beyond the memory of what she’d lost, the sea would rise and fall without her. [480]

But here, in the twilight, in the gaps between one world and the next, she had fledged at last. [495]

Not as a bird, but as something older. [500]

Something that had always been waiting in the silence between the stars. [510]

She smiled. [512]

The ink shimmered, alive, and the night leaned in to listen. [520]

(They would call it heresy, later. [525]

They would call it beauty. [527]

She would call it home.) [530]

The first line of the next verse was already forming at her throat, impatient as the tide. [550]

She let it come. [552]

After all, exile was just another word for a door left ajar. [560]

And she had always been good at slipping through. [568]
