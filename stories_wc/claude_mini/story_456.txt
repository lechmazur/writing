In the last flicker of a guttering lantern, a morbid florist named Ava sat cross-legged on a floating rock dojo, her neutrally passionate gaze fixed on a plain white candle. <words>30</words>

Ava's beliefs had been tempered by years of studying the cosmic cycles, and she was driven to understand them more deeply. <words>48</words> Through the backlog of typed pages in a writer's trunk, she sought answers that would shed light on the mysteries of the universe. <words>68</words>

With a boldly timid hand, Ava reached out and lit the candle, watching as the flame flickered to life. <words>84</words> As she observed the candle's dance, she felt a sense of connection to the ebb and flow of the cosmos, the delicate balance between light and dark, life and death. <words>108</words>

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the dojo, causing the candle to flicker and nearly extinguish. <words>122</words> Ava's brow furrowed as she leaned forward, shielding the flame with her hands, determined to keep it alive. <words>138</words>

In that moment, she felt a deep obligation to the candle, to the cosmic cycles, and to her own understanding of the world. <words>154</words> With a steady breath, she cupped the candle, shielding it from the wind, and allowed the flame to stabilize. <words>170</words>

As the candle burned steadily, Ava's mind raced, piecing together the fragments of information she had gathered from the writer's trunk. <words>186</words> She saw patterns emerging, connections that she had never noticed before, and a deeper understanding of the delicate balance that governed the universe. <words>204</words>

Awed by her newfound insights, Ava sat in silence, her eyes fixed on the flickering flame. <words>218</words> The dojo seemed to float in a timeless void, the only sound the gentle crackle of the candle. <words>234</words>

Suddenly, a thought struck her. <words>240</words> What if the cosmic cycles were not just a matter of understanding, but of active participation? <words>254</words> What if she could, in some small way, influence the ebb and flow of the universe? <words>270</words>

With a renewed sense of purpose, Ava reached into the writer's trunk and began to sift through the pages, her fingers tracing the words with a reverence that belied her morbid nature. <words>292</words> She knew that the answers she sought were there, hidden in the backlog of typed pages, waiting to be discovered. <words>308</words>

As the lantern's light finally flickered and died, Ava's eyes shone with a newfound determination. <words>322</words> She would oblige the cosmic cycles, using her knowledge and her connection to the candle's flame to shape the course of the universe. <words>340</words>

With a deep breath, she set the candle down and began to read, her neutrally passionate expression belying the intensity of her focus. <words>356</words> The dojo floated on, a silent witness to her quest, as Ava delved deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos. <words>372</words>
