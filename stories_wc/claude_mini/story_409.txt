The bruised fighter crouched in the dusty attic, clutching a shard of a clay pot with an inscription. <words>24</words> He had come here, through forgotten dreams, to stand for something. <words>33</words> His skillfully incompetent hands traced the words on the shard, a last vestige of self-deception he sought to extinguish. <words>49</words>

Around him, the clockwork animals that filled the attic seemed to watch, their mechanisms ticking away the moments until the sculptor's chisel first struck the marble. <words>68</words> The fighter knew he had little time. <words>74</words> He had to act now, before the world changed forever. <words>83</words>

With a deep breath, the fighter rose and moved towards the window, his plan taking shape. <words>94</words> He would abduct the sculptor, force him to confront the truth he had hidden for so long. <words>107</words> The fighter's bruises ached, a reminder of the battles he had fought to get here, but he pushed the pain aside. <words>123</words> This was his moment to stand for something, to finally break free of the lies that had held him back. <words>138</words>

As he made his way down the creaking stairs, the fighter's mind raced. <words>149</words> He knew the abduction would be risky, but he had no choice. <words>160</words> The sculptor's chisel was poised to strike, and with it, the last vestiges of the fighter's self-deception would be shattered. <words>175</words>

The fighter moved with a sense of purpose, his footsteps echoing through the forgotten spaces of the attic. <words>188</words> He could feel the weight of the clay pot shard in his hand, a tangible reminder of the truth he sought. <words>203</words> As he stepped out into the sunlight, the fighter steeled himself for the confrontation to come. <words>216</words>

The sculptor, unaware of the fighter's presence, worked diligently, his chisel poised to strike the marble. <words>229</words> The fighter moved closer, his heart pounding, and with a swift motion, he grabbed the sculptor and pulled him away, the chisel clattering to the ground. <words>244</words>

The sculptor struggled, his eyes wide with fear, but the fighter held him firm. <words>256</words> "Listen to me," the fighter said, his voice low and intense. <words>265</words> "You've been hiding the truth for too long. <words>273</words> It's time to face it, once and for all." <words>281</words>

The sculptor's gaze flickered to the clay pot shard in the fighter's hand, and a look of recognition crossed his face. <words>295</words> The fighter knew he had the sculptor's attention now, and he pressed on, determined to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception. <words>310</words>

As the two men stood there, the clockwork animals in the attic continued to tick away the moments, a silent witness to the confrontation unfolding before them. <words>326</words> The fighter knew that the sculptor's decision would shape the course of their lives, and he held his breath, waiting for the sculptor to speak. <words>343</words>
