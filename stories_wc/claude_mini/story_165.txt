The dwarves had long ago sealed off the entrance to the garden, their reasons inscrutably obvious to Elara. <words>87</words> She had spent countless hours deciphering the reversed messages etched into the stone, piecing together the clues that would lead her to the garden's heart. <words>108</words> At last, she stood before the hidden door, the stained glass butterfly in her hands glowing with an otherworldly light. <words>124</words>
