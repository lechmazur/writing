Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a rubber stamp, its image unclear, and began tracing the patterns of the clouds, a method he had long used to divine the secrets of the universe. <words>72</words> As he bickered with the clouds, his fingers danced across the stamp, searching for answers to the questions that had haunted him for years. <words>92</words>
