One day, as she was exploring the remote alpine monastery, Amara stumbled upon a curious object â€“ a set of blacksmith's tongs, abandoned and forgotten in a dusty corner. <words>61</words> Intrigued, she picked them up, feeling the weight and heft of the tool in her hands. <words>75</words> An idea began to form in her mind, a nostalgic innovation that would soon consume her.
