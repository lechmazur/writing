As he approached the landmark, a glimmer of hope began to take root in Alistair's heart. <words>357</words> Perhaps here, in this unexpected place, he would find the answers he so desperately sought, the key to restoring the delicate balance that had once defined his reign. <words>383</words>

With a renewed sense of purpose, Alistair pressed on, his collection of dried seed pods a silent witness to the journey that lay ahead. <words>405</words> The fate of the xenophobic enclave hung in the balance, and Alistair was determined to emerge victorious, no matter the cost. <words>430</words>
