The weatherbeaten knight stood before the brass door knocker, his calloused hand hesitating. <words>21</words> He had been summoned to this lighthouse prison off a jagged reef, where he now faced an impossible choice. <words>35</words>

Within the mirrored reflection, the knight saw the face of his long-lost love, her expression grudgingly sweet. <words>48</words> She had been imprisoned here for years, her final cry of regret haunting him. <words>60</words> To free her would mean betraying his oath, but to leave her would be a fate worse than death. <words>75</words>

With a deep breath, the knight reached out and grasped the knocker, the pattern of seemingly random items forming a key to the door. <words>90</words> As it swung open, he steeled himself for what lay beyond, the joyful agony of the choice he must make. <words>105</words>

Inside, the lighthouse's beacon cast an eerie glow, illuminating the weathered walls and the figure of his beloved. <words>118</words> She approached him, her eyes filled with a mixture of hope and resignation. <words>130</words> "You came," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the crashing waves. <words>140</words>

The knight reached out, longing to touch her, to pull her into his arms and whisk her away from this place. <words>155</words> But he knew that such an action would come at a great cost, one that he was not sure he could bear. <words>170</words> He had sworn an oath to protect the realm, and breaking that vow would have dire consequences. <words>183</words>

As he struggled with his decision, the knight couldn't help but appreciate the beauty of the lighthouse, its solitary beacon a symbol of both hope and isolation. <words>200</words> He knew that his choice would not only affect his own life but the lives of countless others. <words>213</words> The weight of that responsibility bore down on him, making the decision all the more agonizing. <words>226</words>

Finally, he turned to his beloved, his eyes filled with a mixture of love and regret. <words>239</words> "I'm sorry," he whispered, his voice cracking with emotion. <words>247</words> "I must do what is right, even if it means leaving you here." <words>260</words>

With a heavy heart, the knight turned and walked away, his footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. <words>272</words> As he reached the door, he paused, his hand resting on the brass knocker once more. <words>285</words> He knew that he would never forget this moment, this impossible choice that had torn his heart in two. <words>300</words>

With a deep sigh, the knight stepped out into the night, the lighthouse's beacon guiding him back to the shore. <words>313</words> As he walked, he couldn't help but feel a sense of joyful agony, knowing that he had done what was necessary, even if it meant sacrificing his own happiness. <words>330</words> But he also knew that he would never truly be free from the weight of his decision, the final cry of regret echoing in his mind for the rest of his days. <words>348</words>
