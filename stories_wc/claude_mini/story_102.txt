The spineless mercenary, Alistair, crept through the map projection room, the victorian dollhouse key clutched tightly in his palm. <words>25</words> He had been tasked with a grandly trivial mission: to hush a prophecy spoken in code. <words>37</words>

As he walked, Alistair felt a sense of purpose growing within him. <words>206</words> He may have been a spineless mercenary, but in this moment, he was driven by a higher calling. <words>219</words> He would not let the prophecy come to pass, no matter the cost. <words>230</words>

The passageway led him to a vast, underground chamber, where the prophecy's words echoed and reverberated. <words>241</words> Alistair steeled himself, ready to face whatever lay ahead, and stepped forward, determined to fulfill his mentor's mission. <words>254</words>
