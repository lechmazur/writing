Slowly, he made his way towards the center of the training ground, his senses heightened, his mind focused on the task at hand. <words>201</words> As he drew closer, he could see the teacher standing before a large, ornate table, their hands moving with practiced precision as they wiped away the final formula. <words>220</words>
