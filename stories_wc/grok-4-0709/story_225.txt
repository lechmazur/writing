In the dim glow of brass lanterns on the steampunk submarine's observation deck, where gears whirred like weary hearts and portholes framed the abyssal deep, Elias the wayward apothecary hunched over his cluttered workbench.<words>32</words>
The vessel, a battered marvel of riveted iron and hissing steam, plowed through undersea currents in this fragile era between broken treaties, when alliances shattered like fragile coral and nations eyed each other with submerged suspicion.<words>64</words>
Elias, once a respected healer in the surface cities, had turned rogue after brewing elixirs deemed too dangerous, now driven by an unyielding motivation to track migratory butterflies—ethereal creatures bio-engineered with iridescent wings that fluttered through ocean trenches, carrying pollens of forgotten flora.<words>108</words>
These butterflies, unjustly fair in their luminous beauty, danced in patterns that mocked the ugliness of war, their grace a cruel reminder of peace's elusiveness.<words>129</words>
But Elias saw in them a vessel for his grand scheme: to infect the warring factions with an unconventional love, a potent emotion distilled from rare abyssal blooms, spreading not hatred but an irrational, binding affection that could mend fractured pacts.<words>166</words>
His method was ingenious yet perilous—transmitting the infection through morse code signals, flashing lantern lights in dots and dashes to lure the butterflies close, where his atomizer would mist them with the elixir, turning them into unwitting carriers.<words>201</words>
Tonight, as the submarine creaked under pressure from rival patrols, Elias prepared his signals, his heart pounding with a love of his own—unconventional and fierce—for Lira, the enemy navigator whose submarine shadowed theirs, her features unjustly fair, pale as pearl and sharp as betrayal, a beauty that unfairly captivated him across the divide.<words>258</words>
He had glimpsed her through periscopes, her eyes like storm-lit waves, and in his wayward dreams, he yearned to infect her with this same love, bridging their broken worlds.<words>284</words>
Grasping his dry highlighter pen, a relic from surface days meant to mark code sequences on damp parchments, Elias cursed as it scraped uselessly, ink long evaporated in the humid confines.<words>313</words>
Undeterred, he improvised, dipping the pen into his elixir vial, transforming it into a conduit; the dry tip absorbed just enough to trace glowing morse patterns on the glass porthole, signals pulsing into the dark.<words>347</words>
Butterflies swarmed, drawn by the rhythmic flashes, their wings brushing the hull as the infection took hold, carrying unconventional love toward Lira's vessel.<words>369</words>
In this battered marvel of a moment, amid the groan of treaties' remnants, Elias watched hope migrate, his wayward heart unjustly fair in its defiant bloom.<words>393</words>
