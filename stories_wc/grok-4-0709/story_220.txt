In the port city of Eldridge, where towering labyrinths of shipping containers cast long shadows like forgotten giants, the aloof page named Silas wandered with his usual detachment during the lull of a wounded season, a time when autumn's vibrancy had been battered by relentless storms, leaving the air heavy with damp regret.

His motivation burned quietly: to pierce illusions with unstoppable curiosity, for he had grown up shrouded in family myths that painted his lineage as mere servants, devoid of any real power.

The pages were filled with sketches of bizarre underwater relics and cryptic entries that hinted at lost fortunes and betrayed legacies, mirroring the illusions Silas sought to shatter.

With Mara's encouragement, Silas began to reconstruct the fragmented story within the logbook, piecing together clues that revealed his own great-grandfather had been no lowly page, but a daring explorer who had charted those very depths, only to have his achievements erased by envious rivals.

This revelation stirred something in Silas; the core concept of reclaiming power surged through him as he traced faded maps and decoded entries, transforming the predictably odd ritual of his whispers into purposeful declarations.
