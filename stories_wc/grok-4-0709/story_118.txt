The air thrummed with anticipation, carrying through the night the faint hum of impending revelation—a breakthrough in neural espionage that could rewrite minds like code.

Echo Collective, a uniformly peculiar entity comprising countless linked consciousnesses, manifested as a swirling vortex of voices, each one merry in its bitterness, chuckling at the follies of solitary human minds.

Tonight's patient was Agent Lark, haunted by the sound of hindsight, those echoing regrets from botched missions that replayed like distorted audio loops in his skull, draining his resolve drop by drop.

"Welcome, dear fragmented soul," the Collective intoned with a glee laced in sarcasm, "ready to anchor the ephemeral in reality, or shall we let your past echoes devour you whole?"

Lark nodded grimly, clutching a scuffed phone charger plug he'd found in the facility's gadget graveyard, its frayed wires a relic from a failed infiltration where hindsight had screamed loudest.

"Listen to it drain," Echo Collective laughed with bitter mirth, "your hindsight hissing away like a deflating balloon at a spy's funeral—oh, the irony!"
