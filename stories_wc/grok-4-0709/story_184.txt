In the vacuum chamber garden, where engineered vines twisted silently against the domed glass shielding them from the void of space, Jax the scrappy tavern-hand wiped down the bar with a rag that had seen better days.<words>37</words>
He'd ended up here after a string of bad luck on derelict stations, slinging drinks to asteroid miners and lost souls who wandered into this artificial Eden.<words>64</words>
The garden was a marvel, a pressurized bubble of life on a dead moon, but Jax treated it with his usual flippant solemnity—joking about the "airtight ambiance" while secretly revering the fragile blooms that defied the cosmos.<words>102</words>
Tonight, though, something felt off; the hourglasses in the tavern were trickling upward, sands of time flowing backward in defiance of logic.<words>123</words>
Jax chuckled gravely to himself, "Well, if time's rewinding, maybe I'll get a do-over on that last pour."<words>140</words>
But deep down, he knew this was no glitch—it was the inescapable calling, that predictably unpredictable pull that had haunted him since childhood, always yanking him toward chaos at the most orderly moments.<words>173</words>
His hands trembled as he reached under the bar for his hidden treasure: a collection of broken seashells, relics from a long-lost Earth ocean, their fractured edges whispering forgotten tides.<words>204</words>
These weren't just trinkets; they were keys to something greater, a motivation burning in Jax to catapult imagination beyond known realms, to shatter the mundane and birth wild visions.<words>234</words>
The calling demanded action now, while the sands reversed, urging him to randomize the garden's fate, to infuse unpredictability into its sterile perfection.<words>256</words>
With a smirk masking his solemn resolve, Jax slipped out of the tavern into the garden's core, where a simulated riverbed lay dried and cracked under artificial stars.<words>284</words>
Here, fossilized footprints etched the ancient mud—marks of primordial creatures that had wandered eons ago, preserved in this recreated slice of history.<words>307</words>
This was the method, he knew: through these fossilized footprints in the dried-up riverbed, he would perform the randomization.<words>326</words>
Jax scattered the broken seashells across the prints, each shard landing with a soft clink that echoed in the vacuum-sealed hush.<words>347</words>
As time flowed backward, the shells began to vibrate, their fractures glowing with an otherworldly light, unpredictably yet predictably rearranging themselves into new patterns guided by the ancient steps.<words>376</words>
Jax watched, flippantly muttering prayers like "Come on, you crusty old walkers, shuffle the deck," while his heart pounded with grave purpose.<words>400</words>
The randomization took hold; vines twisted into impossible shapes, flowers bloomed in reverse then exploded into colors unseen, catapulting the garden's essence into realms of imagination Jax had only dreamed of.<words>433</words>
Miners at the bar gasped as the dome shimmered, their memories unspooling and reforming into fantastical what-ifs.<words>450</words>
Jax, the scrappy tavern-hand, had answered his inescapable calling once more, turning predictability on its head in this backward-flowing moment, forever altering the vacuum chamber garden's soul.<words>478</words>
And as the sands finally settled, he grinned solemnly, knowing the chaos was just beginning.<words>492</words>
