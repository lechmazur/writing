Elias had always been traditionally spontaneous, his impulsive acts rooted in the old family lore of chasing whims like ancestors who followed wandering stars, yet tonight's plan felt both destined and desperate.

The theater's crumbling screen flickered with phantom lights as surreal circus caravans materialized at midnight, their painted wagons glowing ethereally, performers with elongated shadows dancing in impossible rhythms.
