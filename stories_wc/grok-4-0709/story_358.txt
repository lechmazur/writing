In the frost-veiled dome of the arctic research greenhouse, where exotic flora defied the eternal winter, Elias the old-fashioned mage wandered with purposefully aimless steps, his velvet robes brushing against heated soil beds.

This sanctuary, a bubble of verdant life amid the icy desolation, served as his laboratory for arcane botany, but today, amid playground time— that whimsical hour when the aurora danced like children's laughter across the sky, casting playful shadows— he pursued a deeper mystery.

Clutched in his gnarled hand was a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, its gilded hieroglyphs pulsing with ancient energy, a relic he had unearthed from a forgotten tomb to fuel his lifelong motivation: to claim an uncharted frontier beyond the veil of reality.

The core concept of his quest was the unfolding riddle inscribed upon the shard, a puzzle that promised dominion over unseen realms but revealed itself only piecemeal, demanding patience and intuition.

Elias had chosen this remote setting deliberately, for the greenhouse's myriad mirrors— installed to amplify scant sunlight for the plants— created a labyrinth of reflections, perfect for the method he employed: through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections, where glimpses of otherworldly truths flickered like ghosts.

The tone of sanctified dread hung heavy in the air, a reverent terror that sanctified each step as if treading holy ground laced with peril, for meddling with pharaonic secrets invited divine wrath.

His reflection stared back, but it was not merely him; the riddle began to unfold as the image warped, revealing a spectral version of himself as a child, frolicking in an illusory playground of golden sands and obelisks.

Purposefully aimless in his gaze, Elias let the encounter ephemeralize, the child's form beckoning him to decipher the first layer: "What cuddles the soul yet shatters the crown?" whispered the reflection, its voice echoing with the dread of forgotten gods.  
<words>315</words>  
He pondered, his heart pounding with sanctified fear, realizing the answer lay in the intimacy of embrace— to cuddle the essence of the past, to hold the fragment close as one would a lover or a secret.

Trembling, he pressed the coffin shard to his chest, cuddling it in a ritual of vulnerability, feeling its cold surface warm against his skin as the mirror's child nodded approvingly.

Through this act, the riddle advanced, the reflection dissolving into a portal of swirling mists, unveiling an uncharted frontier: a lush, ethereal jungle where pharaonic spirits roamed, untouched by mortal explorers.

Elias, fortified by his purposeful wandering and the fragment's power, stepped through, cuddling the shard tighter, ready to sanctify his dominion amid the unfolding enigma.
