Jax pounded the cracked tarmac of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his jog a furious rhythm against the ghosts of forgotten departures.
<words>21</words>
Sweat stung his eyes, but it was the fire in his chest that truly burned—an irate smuggler's heart in full revolt, rejecting the shadows he'd long called home.
<words>45</words>
He'd smuggled contraband across star systems, dodging patrols and betraying trusts, but now his own pulse hammered a rebellion, each beat a demand for something purer, something hidden like the waterfalls he'd heard whispers of in old spacer tales.
<words>84</words>
Those mythical cascades, concealed in asteroid belts or forgotten moons, symbolized escape, a cleansing rush he craved to wash away the grime of his deals.
<words>107</words>
"Damn it all," he muttered with biting sincerity, his voice sharp as a laser cutter, honest in its raw ache—why chase phantoms when the real rot was inside?
<words>132</words>
The flight deck stretched empty under flickering emergency lights, rusted shuttles like skeletal remains, a perfect graveyard for a man outrunning his conscience.
<words>151</words>
His motivation burned clearer with every stride: to find those hidden waterfalls, not for treasure, but for the solace they promised, a revolt against the void he'd filled with lies.
<words>178</words>
But the heart's revolt was abstractly physical, a tightening in his veins, a phantom weight pressing his ribs, as if his emotions had grown bones and sinew to fight back.
<words>205</words>
He slowed near a derelict control tower, breath ragged, and pulled from his pocket the single chopstick—salvaged from a botched run on Neo-Tokyo station, a relic of a meal shared with Lena, the partner he'd lost to a rival's ambush.
<words>244</words>
She'd laughed then, twirling it like a wand, promising they'd find paradise together, hidden waterfalls where worries dissolved like mist.
<words>263</words>
Now, in this desolate place, during his frantic jog, Jax decided to memorialize her, to honor the love his smuggling life had stolen.
<words>283</words>
He crouched, unscrewing a small thermos from his belt—tea brewed strong, a habit from Lena's teachings.
<words>297</words>
With the single chopstick, he stirred the leaves, watching them swirl in patterns, the method she'd sworn by for glimpsing truths.
<words>315</words>
The revolt in his heart surged, physical twinges like electric shocks, urging him to read the signs, to let sincerity bite through his cynicism.
<words>337</words>
Brown flecks formed jagged lines, a cascade shape tumbling into a hidden crevice—clear as day, a map to those waterfalls, etched in tea's prophecy.
<words>357</words>
"You always knew, didn't you?" he whispered bitterly, sincerely, the words a knife's edge of grief and resolve.
<words>372</words>
This abstractly physical ache, his heart's uprising, pushed him to act; no more smuggling shadows, only the pursuit of that cleansing flow.
<words>392</words>
Rising, chopstick clutched like a talisman, Jax resumed his jog, the flight deck's emptiness now a launchpad, his steps lighter with purpose.
<words>412</words>
He'd memorialized Lena through those tea leaf patterns, her memory fueling his quest, the irate smuggler reborn in revolt's honest fire.
<words>430</words>
Hidden waterfalls awaited, and for once, his biting sincerity admitted: the heart's path was the only one worth running.
