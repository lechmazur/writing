You slouch in the creaky chair of the abandoned space station control room, staring at the flickering holographic displays that once monitored orbital paths but now just buzz with static.

This place, perched at the boundary of your family's old farmland—soon to be sold off to corporate developers—feels like the perfect spot for your latest half-hearted scheme.  
<words>52</words>  
As an underachieving mage, you've always been exceptionally usual, your spells fizzling out like damp fireworks, your potential buried under layers of apathy and excuses.  
<words>74</words>  
But today, with bored excitement bubbling beneath your ennui, you're here to reclaim your heritage, to spring a trap on your own limitations and finally unleash the arcane bloodline that's eluded you.  
<words>102</words>  
The farmland below, visible through the grimy viewport, stretches out in golden waves, a remnant of your ancestors who blended earth magic with stolen alien tech to build this very station.  
<words>129</words>  
Selling it means losing that legacy forever, but you've got a plan—or at least the vague outline of one, fueled by procrastination and a spark of reluctant thrill.  
<words>154</words>  
It starts with the misdelivered packages; you'd enchanted a delivery drone to reroute shipments from the nearby colony hub, hoping something useful would tumble into this forgotten corner.  
<words>179</words>  
The first box arrives with a thud, its label smeared and wrong—intended for some farmer's co-op, but now yours.  
<words>196</words>  
You pry it open lazily, expecting seeds or tools, but inside is a peculiar object: a doll head with blinking eyes, its porcelain face cracked but those lids fluttering like it's alive.  
<words>225</words>  
Weird, you think, the boredom shifting to a tingle of excitement; it's exceptionally usual-looking, like any child's toy from the old Earth archives, yet those eyes hold a glimmer of something more.  
<words>254</words>  
The second package crashes in, misdirected from a museum shipment—ancient runes etched on crystal shards that hum with faint magic.  
<words>272</words>  
Your heart picks up, the thrill piercing your usual fog; maybe this is it, the key to unveiling your heritage.  
<words>290</words>  
The third box, battered and reeking of soil from the farmland below, contains faded journals from your great-grandmother, a mage who supposedly powered this station with spells woven into its circuits.  
<words>317</words>  
Boredom evaporates into eager anticipation as you connect them: the doll head, with its blinking eyes, isn't just a toy—it's a relic, enchanted to store memories.  
<words>341</words>  
You place it atop the control console, aligning the crystal shards around it like a ritual circle, the journals open to incantations you've never mastered.  
<words>363</words>  
With a deep breath, you chant the words, your voice steady for once, the misdelivered packages forming an accidental nexus.  
<words>381</words>  
The doll's eyes blink rapidly, projecting holographic visions: your ancestors taming the land with magic, building the station to guard their secrets from the stars.  
<words>404</words>  
Energy surges through the room, circuits lighting up as you unveil the truth—your limitations were self-imposed, a trap of doubt you've now sprung.  
<words>426</words>  
The farmland below glows with renewed wards, halting the sale; you've reclaimed it all, your magic awakening in a rush of bored excitement turned triumphant fire.
