In the dusty attic filled with clockwork animals, their gears whispering forgotten ticks and tocks, the bruised fighter slumped against a beam, his body a map of purple welts and faded scars from battles he could never quite win.

He was skillfully incompetent, a master of feints and jabs that dazzled opponents but always left him open to the knockout blow, as if his talent lay in the art of almost succeeding.

Tonight, at the precise moment a sculptor's chisel first struck marble in the studio below, sending a sharp crack echoing up through the floorboards like the birth of truth from stone, he felt the weight of his deceptions pressing down.

The attic was a graveyard of mechanical beasts—brass lions with winding keys, tin birds frozen mid-flutter—all coated in layers of dust that danced in the faint moonlight filtering through a cracked window.

He had come here to hide, or perhaps to confront the lies he told himself, the ones that whispered he fought for glory when really it was fear that drove him into the ring.
<words>176</words>
His motivation burned clear now: to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, to finally stand for something real, even if it meant abducting the shadow of his former self through the haze of forgotten dreams.

Rummaging through a pile of relics, his swollen fingers closed around a clay pot shard, its surface etched with an ancient inscription that read, "Stand firm, for the dream unremembered is the thief of the soul."

The words hit him like a sucker punch; they were a call to action, a reminder that his life of half-hearted brawls was built on illusions he could no longer afford.

As the chisel below chipped away at the marble, shaping raw stone into form, he closed his eyes, willing himself into the realm of forgotten dreams where his true abduction would begin.
<words>305</words>
In that ethereal space, memories long buried surfaced—dreams of a boy who wanted to be a protector, not a performer, dreams he'd shoved aside for the roar of crowds and the sting of defeat.
<words>339</words>
Skillfully, yet with his trademark incompetence, he navigated the dreamscape, his movements precise but always a beat off, allowing the false self—the one that reveled in bruises as badges of hollow honor—to draw near.
<words>372</words>
He abducted it then, not with force but through the method of forgotten dreams, pulling the deceptive shadow into oblivion, extinguishing it like a flame snuffed by truth's cold breath.

When he awoke, the clockwork animals seemed to stir slightly, their mechanisms groaning as if applauding his stand; the shard in his hand felt warmer, its inscription a vow etched into his very being.
<words>435</words>
No longer would he fight for illusions; he stood now for the raw, unchiseled self, born in that moment of the sculptor's strike, free from the last lie that had held him captive.
