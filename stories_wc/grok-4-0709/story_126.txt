It had been years since his cargo vessel crashed into this orbiting relic, stranding him among the elite who fled the planet after the last tree fell, leaving behind a dust-choked world devoid of life.

Elias, once a trader of forgotten Earth relics, now wandered the station's corridors like a ghost, his honestly strange demeanor—blunt truths delivered with eerie calm—alienating the illusion-clinging inhabitants.

Clutched in his weathered hands was his most prized possession: a rustic butter churn, salvaged from his wreck, its wooden dasher a symbol of the pastoral simplicity erased by corporate greed.

The core concept that fueled him was rebellious sparks, not just the literal flickers from the station's failing wiring, but the ignited defiance in his soul against the grand illusion perpetuated by the overseers.

His plan coalesced in the ghost station, an abandoned lower level where echoes of evacuations lingered, and there, amid rusted platforms, hung a faded travel poster promising "Eternal Green Getaways" to a long-dead paradise.

As he ascended, the churn's handle sparked against the metal, igniting tiny rebellious sparks that danced in the dimness, a prelude to the chaos he intended to unleash.

Reaching the top, he emerged into the overseers' sanctum, where holographic emitters hummed, projecting the lie to the observation deck below.

With a swing of the churn, he smashed the central console, sparks erupting in a cascade of defiant light, shattering the grand illusion as the holograms flickered to reveal the desolate Earth—gray, treeless, forsaken.
