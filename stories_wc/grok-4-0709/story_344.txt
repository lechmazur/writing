In the hush of improbable beginnings, where the world seemed to hold its breath before leaping into the unknown, Elias Thorne arrived at the floating rock tea house, an ethereal establishment perched on a massive boulder suspended high above the churning sea by ancient, invisible forces.

As an underwater explorer plagued by claustrophobia, Elias found ironic solace in this open-air haven, where the vast sky and endless horizons mocked the tight confines of his submersible dives that had once nearly broken him.

The tea house itself was a marvel: woven from vines and polished stone, it drifted gently on thermal updrafts, its tables adorned with steaming pots and jars of preserves, inviting guests to linger and converse.

As he sampled the first spoonful—a tart raspberry preserve from a century-old formula—Elias detected nuances of sun-ripened fruit and whispered spices, flavors that evoked memories he thought buried deep.
