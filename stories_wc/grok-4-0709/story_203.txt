In the cluttered confines of the orbital salvage station, amidst swirling fields of cosmic debris, Father Elias Thorne assembled tiny toy rockets from salvaged parts, his hands trembling not from zero gravity but from the stage fright that had haunted him since seminary days.  
<words>47</words>  
As an exorcist assigned to purge spectral anomalies from the wreckage of forgotten satellites, he found the vast audience of stars more daunting than any demon.  
<words>74</words>  
The station's hum was a defiant hush against the void, where nothing was ever usual—ghosts whispered through hulls, and debris danced in unnatural patterns.  
<words>99</words>  
Tonight, amid this toy assembly meant to distract his mind, Elias confronted his inheritance of lies, a legacy passed down from his grandfather, who claimed their family descended from Earth-bound saints but hid their true origins as orbital outcasts.  
<words>140</words>  
Those lies had sculpted Elias's life, convincing him he was destined for quiet parish work, not this celestial battlefield where spirits of crashed missions lingered like unquiet echoes.  
<words>169</words>  
Clutched in his palm was the object that bound him to that deceit: a locket containing pressed wildflowers from a mythical Earth meadow his grandfather swore they'd once owned, but which records proved was just a fabricated tale to mask their nomadic spacefaring shame.  
<words>213</words>  
The flowers, flattened and faded, symbolized the "never" that had chained him—never a true exorcist, never free of fright, never able to perform without an audience's judgment.  
<words>241</words>  
But Elias's motivation burned in defiant hush: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” transforming inherited falsehoods into a forge for his own truth.  
<words>266</words>  
He floated to the airlock, toys half-assembled behind him, their plastic forms mimicking the debris outside.  
<words>281</words>  
The ritual demanded submersion, not in water scarce in orbit, but in the metaphorical depths of revelation.  
<words>296</words>  
He would submerge the locket, and with it the lies, into the station's reclamation vat, where acidic solutions dissolved metal scraps into reusable slurry.  
<words>320</words>  
The method was precise: by the sound of a key turning in a lock, an antique recording his grandfather had left, symbolizing the unlocking of hidden truths.  
<words>345</words>  
As the key's metallic click echoed through his helmet's speakers, Elias pressed the locket into the vat, watching bubbles rise in silent defiance.  
<words>367</words>  
The wildflowers disintegrated, their essence merging with the debris-laden fluid, submerging the inheritance of lies into oblivion.  
<words>383</words>  
In that moment, a spectral form materialized amid the orbital junk—a wailing ghost of a long-lost cosmonaut, drawn by the ritual's pull.  
<words>404</words>  
Elias's stage fright surged, but the defiant hush of his resolve whispered louder; he chanted the exorcism incantation, his voice steady in the vacuum's silence.  
<words>429</words>  
The ghost twisted, its form never usual, contorting like tangled satellite wires, but Elias persisted, sculpting possibility from what he'd deemed impossible.  
<words>450</words>  
As the spirit dissipated into starlit ash, Elias floated back to his toys, assembling the final rocket with newfound calm—his inheritance reborn not in lies, but in quiet triumph.
