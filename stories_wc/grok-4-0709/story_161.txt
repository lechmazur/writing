Whispers among the staff, peculiar flight patterns that defied aerodynamics, and sealed letters exchanged in shadows—all pointed to something sinister beneath the innocent facade.

With sardonic glee, he chuckled inwardly at the irony: a place meant for child's play harboring adult deceptions, much like how his orchard's beauty had masked the fragility of life.

The core of his unraveling began with an antique letter seal he discovered tucked in a forgotten drawer, its intricate peacock motif gleaming under the fluorescent lights.

This object, emblazoned with swirling eyespots reminiscent of a peacock's tail, became his key to decoding the conspiracy.

Throughout his volunteering shifts, Elias observed how the paper airplanes were tested not for fun, but as covert messengers, their folds encoding secrets for a shadowy network plotting corporate espionage.

"Watch closely," he said, his voice dripping with mocking delight, "for the truth unfolds via the patterns in a peacock's tail."

He launched the plane, and as it soared, he pointed out how its trajectory formed eyespots—coded signals mirroring the seal's design, revealing drop points for illicit data transfers.
