In the dim flicker of the subway car, Elias the insomniac poet clutched his notebook, the world outside blurring between stops as if time itself had stretched into an eternal, haunted pause. <words>29</words>
His mind wandered back to the attic above the old botanical institute, a space he called home, meticulously messy with scattered papers, ink-stained quills, and shelves overflowing with preserved botanical samples—ferns pressed flat, vials of wilting petals, each labeled in his precise yet chaotic script. <words>77</words>
Ghosts lingered there, remnants of forgotten naturalists who had perished in pursuits of forbidden flora, their warnings coming in whispers that rustled like dry leaves in the wind. <words>102</words>
Elias couldn't sleep, not with those spectral murmurs urging caution against the violence brewing in his soul, a rage born from years of rejected verses and stolen inspirations. <words>127</words>
He yearned to discover the power of non-violence, to quell the fury that made him lash out at critics and rivals, turning poetry readings into battlegrounds. <words>149</words>
The attic's abundance felt empty—endless nights surrounded by nature's captured beauty, yet hollow, devoid of true peace. <words>163</words>
Between subway stops, as the train lurched in some mechanical limbo, Elias relived the after-parties, those raucous gatherings in dimly lit lofts after literary soirees, where wine flowed like forgotten rivers. <words>191</words>
There, in drunken confessions, he began to eliminate his enemies—not with fists or venomous words, but by baring his vulnerabilities, whispering admissions of jealousy and fear into the haze of intoxicated ears. <words>219</words>
One by one, rivals softened; a plagiarist poet, cornered by Elias's slurred truths about shared insecurities, confessed his own thefts and stepped back, rivalry dissolved without a blow. <words>244</words>
The whispers in the attic grew approving, warning him of pitfalls but guiding him toward this gentle unraveling, their ethereal voices mingling with the clink of glasses and laughter that masked deeper emptiness. <words>273</words>
Botanical samples became metaphors in his poems—fragile fronds that thrived without conquest, teaching him that abundance lay in letting go, not hoarding grudges. <words>293</words>
At another after-party, Elias cornered his harshest critic, glasses clinking as he confessed how the man's barbs had fueled his best work, eliminating the wall between them through shared, boozy vulnerability. <words>320</words>
The critic, moved, retracted his scorn, and Elias felt the power surge—non-violence as a force mightier than any outburst, filling the empty abundance of his life with quiet triumph. <words>346</words>
Between stops, the subway jolted forward, snapping Elias from reverie; the attic's ghosts faded, but their whispered warnings echoed, a promise that peace, once discovered, could eliminate darkness forever. <words>374</words>
His notebook filled with verses of blooming forgiveness, the meticulously messy attic waiting, abundant yet no longer empty. <words>388</words>
