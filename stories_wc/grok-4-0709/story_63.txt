The choir's voices swelled and dipped, practicing ancient hymns that the lab sought to preserve before they faded into oblivion, their notes captured in swirling vortexes of acoustic machinery.

Elara, with her humbly proud demeanor—proud of her gift to foresee ripples in time yet humble enough to rarely speak of it—moved silently among the humming devices, her embroidered cuffs brushing against dials that hummed back forgotten lullabies.

With a light chuckle at the absurdity of a high-tech lab hiding secrets under outdated decor—poignant levity in the midst of solemn preservation—she gently peeled it back, revealing faint scrawls etched into the wall beneath.
