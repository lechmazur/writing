In the hush of the unremembered future, where time had folded into forgotten whispers, Jax the lucky gambler wandered into the abandoned schoolhouse of a ghost town, his boots kicking up dust that danced like reluctant confetti. <words>38</words>
He'd always been lucky, winning bets against the odds in this barren world, but today, amid the crumbling desks and faded chalkboards, he found something that typically never surfaced in such desolation: an old botanical diary, its pages blooming with illustrations of plants long extinct. <words>89</words>
The diary wasn't just a relic; it held secrets of duplication, a method to replicate the essence of living things, whispered through ancient rituals that promised power over scarcity. <words>115</words>
Jax grinned with cheerful despair, his laughter echoing hollowly as he clutched the book, motivated to defy the gravity of hopelessness that pinned survivors like him to the ground. <words>142</words>
He gathered a ragtag group of wanderers—lost souls who'd trickled into the ghost town—inviting them to a game in the dim classroom, where moonlight filtered through shattered windows like reluctant spotlights. <words>171</words>
"Let's play spin-the-bottle confessions," he announced cheerfully, spinning an empty vial on the floor, his eyes twinkling with a despair that masqueraded as hope. <words>193</words>
The bottle pointed to a weary woman first; she confessed her dream of seeing a real flower again, something typically never duplicated in their sterile world, her voice breaking into a sad chuckle. <words>223</words>
Jax, feeling the corruption of power stir within him—the diary's allure twisting his lucky streak into something greedy—opened the book and chanted its incantations, duplicating her confessed memory into a tangible sprout that pushed through the floorboards. <words>259</words>
The group gasped, then laughed in cheerful despair, as the plant grew, its leaves unfurling like forbidden miracles, but Jax felt the power's rot seeping in, urging him to hoard this gift for himself. <words>292</words>
Next spin landed on a scarred man who confessed his hopeless love for a world without ruins; Jax duplicated it into a cluster of vines that climbed the walls, blooming faintly, yet each replication fed the corruption, making Jax crave control over their fragile joys. <words>334</words>
Round after round, through spin-the-bottle confessions, they shared despairs disguised as cheer—tales of lost families, vanished skies— and Jax duplicated them into botanical wonders, defying hopelessness with gardens that sprouted amid the decay. <words>366</words>
But the power corrupted absolutely; Jax's luck turned tyrannical, typically never refusing a win, now demanding he duplicate only for his gain, twisting the group's hope into his private empire of replicated greenery. <words>397</words>
In the end, as the schoolhouse bloomed unnaturally alive, the wanderers fled his cheerful tyranny, leaving Jax alone with his duplicated paradise, laughing through tears at the weightless despair he'd failed to defy. <words>430</words>
