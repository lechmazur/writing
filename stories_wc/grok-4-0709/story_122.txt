In the jagged heights of the ancient sky burial site, where vultures circled like digital ghosts against a stormy sky, the cyber-templar named Eron knelt amid the exposed bones of forgotten pilgrims.
<words>29</words>
His augmented eyes, glowing with neural implants, scanned the horizon as thunder rumbled, a collision course with reality that he could no longer avoid.
<words>49</words>
Eron was a guardian of the old codes, a knight fused with circuits and faith, but now his convictions frayed like the worn leather bridle clutched in his metallic hand—a relic from his last mount, a bio-engineered steed lost to the tempests of progress.
<words>95</words>
The bridle, scarred and supple, symbolized control over chaos, yet it mocked him here, in this place where bodies were offered to the winds, stripped bare to reveal the illusion beneath.
<words>124</words>
He had come during the reading, the sacred recitation of the Prism Codex, chanted by holographic monks projected from his wrist device, their voices a euphoric agitation that mirrored his own patiently frantic state.
<words>157</words>
Patiently frantic, he waited for the storm's peak, his heart racing with thrilled unrest, every nerve alight with the mirage of safety that the ritual promised—a false haven from the encroaching void.
<words>187</words>
The core concept haunted him: safety was but a mirage, refracted light deceiving the eye, much like the digital veils he once trusted to shield his soul from doubt.
<words>213</words>
Yet his motivation burned bright—to reflect lightning back at the storm, to turn its fury against itself and prove that faith could conquer the elemental rage.
<words>238</words>
As the reading intensified, verses echoing through the bone-strewn plateau, Eron unfolded the prism from his cloak, a crystal artifact etched with templar runes, its facets catching the flickering pre-storm light.
<words>267</words>
The worn leather bridle, he realized, was no mere object; it was the tether to his past, a reminder of rides through virtual heavens, now grounding him in this raw, mortal arena.
<words>296</words>
With euphoric agitation surging, he positioned the prism atop a skeletal altar, the patiently frantic tremor in his fingers betraying the calm facade as lightning forked closer.
<words>321</words>
The action was clear: he must prove the codex's truth, that through the refraction of light through a prism, one could harness and redirect the storm's wrath, shattering the mirage of safety with raw power.
<words>354</words>
As the reading reached its crescendo, words of ancient defiance booming in synthetic harmony, the first bolt struck nearby, illuminating the sky burial site in stark, electric glory.
<words>380</words>
Eron angled the prism precisely, light bending through its core, refracting the incoming flash into a spectrum that amplified and hurled back at the clouds, a defiant mirror to the heavens.
<words>408</words>
For a euphoric moment, agitation peaked to ecstasy as the reflected lightning clashed with the storm, thunder applauding his triumph, the bridle in his grip feeling like a reins to destiny.
<words>438</words>
But reality collided: the mirage shattered as the prism cracked under the strain, safety's illusion evaporating, leaving Eron exposed, his cyber-faith fractured, vultures descending to claim what the storm spared.
