In the era after time travel's invention, where echoes of past loves lingered like ghosts in the ether, I operated as the city's most notorious heartbreak counselor, a femme fatale draped in shadows and silk, luring broken souls to the sky reflection pool for their salvation—or their undoing.<words>58</words>
The pool, a vast mirrored basin atop the tallest spire, captured the heavens in its glassy depths, where clouds drifted eternally, their trails mapping forgotten timelines.<words>82</words>
My clients came restlessly curious, drawn by whispers of my methods, but it was my own attribute that fueled me—a ceaseless probing into the hearts of men, unraveling their desires like threads from a fraying tapestry.<words>115</words>
Tonight, under a canopy of simulated stars, a young inventor named Elias arrived, his eyes haunted by a love lost to the temporal winds.<words>136</words>
He spoke of her, the one who vanished into a paradox, leaving him caged in illusions of what could have been.<words>154</words>
I listened, my amber earrings swaying gently, ancient relics infused with chronal essence, glowing faintly as they attuned to his pulse.<words>172</words>
"Desires have gravity," I murmured, my voice a velvet trap, "they pull you down, anchor you to moments that no longer exist."<words>192</words>
It was the core concept I preached, yet one I wrestled with myself, my own heart a battlefield of impulsive yearnings tempered by caution.<words>214</words>
Elias begged for freedom, to proclaim himself unbound from this cage of illusions, and I, ever the counselor, agreed to guide him—though my restless curiosity wondered what secrets his timeline hid.<words>243</words>
We stood at the pool's edge, the sky's reflection swirling below like a portal to infinities.<words>257</words>
"To break free," I explained, "we must zip through the fractures of time, but cautiously, impulsively—rushing yet mindful of the voids."<words>276</words>
He nodded, entranced, as I demonstrated the method: by tracking cloud trails in the pool's mirror, those wispy paths that betrayed temporal currents, invisible to the untrained eye.<words>302</words>
My fingers brushed the amber earrings, activating their hum, and with a deep breath, I seized his hand, our forms blurring as we zipped into the reflection, propelled by the gravity of his desires.<words>332</words>
We hurtled through epochs, clouds streaking like comet tails, guiding us to the moment of his heartbreak—a sunlit garden where she had chosen another path, another time.<words>357</words>
There, amid blooming illusions, Elias confronted her echo, proclaiming his freedom with trembling voice, shattering the cage that bound him.<words>374</words>
But as we zipped back, tracking the fading trails, my cautious impulsiveness faltered; the earrings warmed, revealing my own trapped desires, pulling me toward a forbidden past.<words>399</words>
In that instant, I understood—the gravity was mine too, and proclaiming freedom meant facing my illusions, restlessly curious till the end.<words>419</words>
Elias emerged healed, but I lingered by the pool, earrings dimming, wondering if true escape lay in surrendering to the pull.<words>438</words>
