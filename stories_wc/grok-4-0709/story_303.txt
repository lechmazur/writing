Yet, in this interlude between episodes, a subtle weariness clung to him, a shadow of losses unmourned.

It was here, amid the babble of tongues both melodic and guttural, that an accidental meeting occurred.

"I'm sorry," Elias murmured in a half-learned dialect, steadying the rack before its contents spilled into the void.
