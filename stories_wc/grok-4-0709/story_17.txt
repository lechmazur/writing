As a guilt-ridden black market genealogist, Elias had spent years peddling illicit family trees, unearthing secrets that shattered lives and left him drowning in remorse.

The witch, an elderly crone with eyes like polished obsidian, greeted him with a nod, her tone matching his own brazen modesty—bold in wisdom, humble in delivery.

"Sit, wanderer," she said, gesturing to a worn stool beside her cauldron, where a chipped bowl rested on the stone altar, its imperfections a testament to countless rituals.

Elias obeyed, his hands trembling as he handed her a sheaf of papers: transcribed funeral eulogies from the families he'd wronged, their words laced with unspoken truths.

"To forgive yourself," the witch intoned, "we must zoom into the subtext, peel back the layers of grief and revelation hidden in these laments."

Amid these morning walks that bridged his tormented past and hopeful future, Elias watched her method unfold: by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, she would divine the paths to absolution.  
<words>244</words>  
"See here," she pointed, her finger tracing lines in the first eulogy, zooming in on phrases like 'beloved despite flaws'—subtle admissions of inherited sins Elias had exposed.

The bowl's chipped edge caught the light, symbolizing his own fractured soul, as the witch chanted softly, her voice weaving spells that pulled hidden meanings to the surface.

As the morning sun climbed, illuminating the atypically typical relics around them, Elias stood on the brink of renewal, the chipped bowl now empty but for the residue of insight.
