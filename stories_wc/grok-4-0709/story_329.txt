In the heart of a sprawling hydroponic noodle farm, where translucent tubes nurtured endless strands of pasta under artificial lights, wandered Elias, the chess grandmaster who had forsaken tournaments for the open road.<words>34</words>
Leaves blew fiercely amid the autumn gusts, scattering like forgotten strategies across the delightfully dull landscape of nutrient vats and monotonous hums.<words>54</words>

His motivation intensified; these hidden passages could lead to a legendary chess relic, a board said to solve life's greatest puzzles.<words>326</words>
The workers, in their xenophobic fervor, pursued him, but the swirling veil shielded his advance, turning their aggression into futile chases.<words>345</words>
