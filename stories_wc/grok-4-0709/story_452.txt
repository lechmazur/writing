But now, in this timeframe after the end of storytelling—when the great neural networks had declared narratives obsolete, severing the threads that bound human fate—chaos reigned, destinies fraying like exposed wires in the undergrid.

Elara's motivation burned steadily: to etch a new cosmic signature, rewriting the stars' ancient script to restore balance, driven by her innate compassion for a world adrift.

With each visit, she traced new patterns, etching a fresh cosmic signature into the projected heavens, stabilizing the unraveling fate by infusing it with organic consistency, her softhearted whispers guiding the realignment like a storyteller reborn.
