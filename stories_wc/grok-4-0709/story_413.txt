In the vast expanse of time before the first creature stirred with sentience, there existed a listless noble, wandering the ethereal realms where intention was but a whisper in the void. <words>32</words>
This noble, naively sophisticated in his ethereal garb, drifted through existence without purpose, his form a shimmering silhouette against the primordial haze. <words>51</words>
The world was an endless corn maze stretching across a haunted plain, where stalks of proto-corn, born from chaotic energies, twisted into labyrinthine paths haunted by formless echoes of what might one day be ghosts. <words>84</words>
These echoes wailed softly, not with malice, but with the ironic prelude to emotion, as if mocking the nobility's aimless saunter. <words>103</words>
One fateful non-moment, an unexpected invitation materialized before him—a swirling vortex of light, beckoning him to a spontaneous event deep within the maze's heart. <words>126</words>
Curiosity, that nascent spark, compelled him to accept, for his motivation was to discover the power of intention, to grasp how mere thought could shape the formless chaos. <words>152</words>
With a faded scarf, a relic from some forgotten cosmic weave, draped loosely around his neck, he ventured into the maze, its threads unraveling like forgotten dreams. <words>177</words>
The scarf, once vibrant in hues of starbirth, now faded to a ghostly pallor, seemed to guide him, fluttering against the haunted winds as if alive with unspoken intent. <words>205</words>
As he navigated the endless turns, the plain's haunts whispered ironic awe—inspiring wonders that belied their pre-sentient emptiness, vast beauties that meant nothing without minds to perceive them. <words>234</words>
Deeper in, he encountered another wanderer, a mirrored soul of listless grace, and their rendezvous unfolded under the maze's arching stalks, drawn together by the invitation's capricious pull. <words>261</words>
They circled each other in naive sophistication, exchanging gestures that mimicked future courtesies, until a bizarre harmony emerged from the chaos. <words>280</words>
Then, in a burst of primordial mirth, they shared laughter—a sound echoing through the haunted plain, raw and unrefined, yet profound in its unintentional creation. <words>305</words>
This shared laughter, born from the scarf's accidental tangle between them, unraveled the fabric of their isolation, weaving intention into existence. <words>325</words>
With ironic awe, the noble realized the power he sought: intention was not a force to discover but one ignited by connection, a spark before sentience that mocked his solitary quest. <words>355</words>
As the maze shifted around them, the haunts joined in silent echoes, and the faded scarf glowed anew, symbolizing how a spontaneous rendezvous could birth the essence of will. <words>383</words>
In that timeless plain, before creatures knew thought, the listless noble transformed, his naive sophistication blooming into the dawn of awareness, all through the ironic wonder of shared joy. <words>412</words>
