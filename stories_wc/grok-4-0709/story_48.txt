Now, as the ship's artificial orchard below— a marvel of hydroponic engineering— neared the end of its cycle, Kael felt the weight of the timeframe pressing upon him: the moment when the orchard’s last apple finally falls, symbolizing the fragile closure of nurtured life in the cold expanse of space.
