In the shattered dome of the old planetarium, now pulsing with neon lights and bass-heavy rhythms as the nightclub "Stellar Rift," Jax the underwater welder felt the weight of two timelines converging where they never should.

He had inherited this mystery from his grandfather, a cryptic tale of fractured realities tied to a vintage button box hidden in his satchel, its contents whispering secrets of improbable power.
<words>69</words>
Jax was patiently impatient, his years diving into flooded ruins teaching him to wait for the perfect weld, yet burning inside to seize control over time itself.
<words>95</words>
Tonight, at this forbidden crossing of eras—one where the planetarium's past as a stargazing haven bled into a future of chaotic revelry—he sensed his moment approaching.
<words>121</words>
The club thrummed with dancers under cracked projections of swirling galaxies, but Jax slipped into the annexed vintage store, a dimly lit corner filled with relics from bygone worlds.
<words>147</words>
There, amid dusty mannequins and forgotten trinkets, stood a row of antique mirrors, their silvered surfaces flickering with glimpses not of the present, but of unraveling possibilities.
<words>172</words>
His motivation burned: to wield the improbable power locked in the button box, allowing him to mend or shatter timelines, granting dominion over fates that had drowned his own family legacy.
<words>201</words>
But first, he needed to pamper the fractured echoes of himself, those alternate versions glimpsed in the mirrors, to coax them into alignment.
<words>223</words>
With a deep breath, Jax opened the vintage button box, its array of pearl, brass, and bone buttons gleaming like captured stars.
<words>243</words>
He selected one, etched with a welder's torch, and held it to the first mirror, where a version of him—successful, unscarred—stared back from a dry, prosperous timeline.
<words>271</words>
Via these glimpses, he began to pamper that echo, whispering affirmations of strength and offering visions of luxurious dives in crystal-clear oceans, not the murky depths he knew.
<words>298</words>
The mirror rippled, and the alternate Jax smiled, his form strengthening as if indulged in a spa of temporal essences.
<words>317</words>
Patiently impatient, Jax moved to the next mirror, where a broken version unraveled—drowning in failures— and he pampered it too, sewing buttons of hope onto its spectral coat through the glass.
<words>346</words>
Each act wove the timelines tighter, the club's music swelling as stars overhead flickered in sync with his efforts.
<words>363</words>
But moments of unraveling crept in; threads of reality frayed, dancers glitching between eras, a 1920s flapper merging with a cyberpunk raver.
<words>386</words>
Jax pressed on, his attribute fueling him—he waited for the surge, yet urged it impatiently with each button affixed via mirror magic.
<words>408</words>
Finally, as the timelines fused in a burst of light, he felt the power flood him, improbable and vast, allowing him to weld the crossing shut or bend it to his will.
<words>439</words>
Yet in that inherited mystery's climax, he glimpsed his own unraveling, a price for pampering echoes at the edge of forbidden time.
<words>460</words>
The button box closed with a click, the mirrors steadied, and Jax emerged into the nightclub, forever changed, master of moments that should never meet.
