<story>
In the frozen hush of a world long abandoned by humanity, where the last footprints had faded into oblivion centuries ago, the guarded druid named Elowen tended her glacial orchard, a precarious grove of frost-kissed apple trees suspended by ancient vines over a yawning crevasse of shimmering blue ice.

She was fiercely ambivalent about her eternal vigil—torn between the sacred duty to preserve this last bastion of life and the gnawing temptation to let it all plunge into the abyss, ending the charade of survival in a lifeless era.

Her crippling fear was not of the cold or the isolation, but of breaking the silence that had enveloped her since the humans departed, a silence she had woven like a protective shroud to guard against the vulnerability of words.

Yet, on this day, which she marked as the orchard's "birthday"—the anniversary of its improbable sprouting from glacial seeds—she resolved to overcome that fear, to gather what remained of her spectral family and shatter the quiet with truth.

The method was ritualistic: preparing a special family meal, one made only on birthdays, using the orchard's meager harvest of icy apples, fermented into a bittersweet cider, and roots dug from the frozen earth, all simmered over a fire conjured from her druidic magic.

With dour amusement, Elowen chuckled inwardly at the absurdity—a druid hosting a feast for ghosts in a post-human wasteland, where the only guests were echoes of long-gone kin, their forms flickering like auroras over the crevasse.

She began to gather: first, the apples, plucking them with gloved hands from branches that creaked like old bones, each fruit a frozen orb that thawed slightly in her palm, releasing a scent that mocked the warmth of vanished summers.

Then, she collected the roots, prying them from the icy soil with a tool that was her most treasured relic—a dull safety pin, bent and tarnished, scavenged from the last human's abandoned pack, now serving as an improvised digger, pinning her fragile hopes together like a makeshift clasp.

As the meal simmered, filling the air with a steamy defiance against the cold, Elowen called her family—the ethereal spirits of druids past, who materialized hesitantly around the fire, their translucent faces etched with the same ambivalence she felt.
<words>367</words>
With a voice rusty from disuse, she broke the silence at last, confessing her fears and doubts in words that echoed across the crevasse, amusingly dour in their honesty: "We've guarded this frozen joke of an Eden long enough; perhaps it's time to let it fall and find peace in the depths."

The spirits laughed faintly, a sound like cracking ice, and as they shared the meal, Elowen's ambivalence softened, her fear conquered in the absurd communion, the safety pin glinting dully by the fire as a symbol of mended resolve in a world beyond humanity's end.
