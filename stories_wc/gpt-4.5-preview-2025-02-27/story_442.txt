The giant mushroom house interior pulsed with a blurry vividness, shadows dancing across walls that seemed to breathe with each flicker of the candle. <words>22</words>  
Ezra, an edgy tradesman whose hands bore scars of countless forgotten deals, stood at the center, eyes narrowed comfortingly pessimistic as he studied the torn corner of a flyer clutched tightly in his calloused fingers. <words>56</words>  
The flyer fragment depicted a faded image of a windmill, its blades frozen mid-spin, a haunting reminder of a past Ezra could no longer fully recall. <words>80</words>  
He knew this windmill, knew it intimately, yet the distortion of memory had blurred its significance into a vague ache of nostalgia and loss. <words>104</words>  
Ezra glanced at his synchronized watch, its ticking perfectly matched to another watch strapped to the wrist of a companion long vanished into the endless void. <words>130</words>  
He had promised her, long ago, that he would vectorize their memories, mapping them precisely onto the fabric of reality, preserving them from the erosion of time. <words>156</words>  
Yet now, standing alone beneath the mushroom's softly glowing ceiling, Ezra understood the futility of his promise, the comforting pessimism of knowing that memories inevitably distort and fade. <words>184</words>  
Outside, the forgotten windmill began its final rotation, creaking mournfully as if lamenting its own impending oblivion. <words>200</words>  
Ezra felt the vibration through the mushroom's spongy floor, a gentle tremor that resonated with the flickering candle flame he was determined to carry through the void. <words>226</words>  
He stepped forward, candle held aloft, its fragile glow illuminating the mushroom's interior in shifting patterns of shadow and light, each step a defiance against the encroaching darkness. <words>254</words>  
The torn flyer corner fluttered from his grasp, drifting slowly downward, landing softly upon the mushroom's floor, a forgotten fragment of a forgotten past. <words>277</words>  
Ezra paused, watching the paper settle, realizing that perhaps memories were never meant to be vectorized, never meant to be preserved in perfect clarity. <words>301</words>  
Perhaps their beauty lay precisely in their distortion, their blurry vividness, their comforting impermanence. <words>315</words>  
The windmill outside groaned louder, its rotation nearing completion, and Ezra knew his time was short. <words>332</words>  
He moved swiftly now, candle flame flickering wildly, shadows stretching and twisting around him, whispering forgotten truths and half-remembered lies. <words>352</words>  
As the windmill's final rotation ended with a shuddering halt, Ezra reached the mushroom's doorway, gazing out into the endless void that stretched infinitely before him. <words>377</words>  
He raised the candle higher, its flame a tiny beacon against the vast darkness, a symbol of his determination to carry forward despite the inevitability of forgetting. <words>403</words>  
With a comfortingly pessimistic smile, Ezra stepped into the void, accepting that memories would distort, fade, and blur, yet knowing that the act of carrying them forward was enough. <words>433</words>  
Behind him, the mushroom house interior dimmed, shadows reclaiming their territory, the torn flyer corner lying forgotten, a silent testament to the beauty of impermanence. <words>458</words>  
Ezra moved onward, candle flickering bravely, embracing the blurry vividness of memory, the comforting pessimism of knowing that all things, even memories, must eventually fade. <words>484</words>
