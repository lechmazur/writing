The orbital debris drifted silently around the station, fragments of forgotten satellites and shattered dreams suspended in the cold vacuum, a never usual backdrop for an exorcism. <words>27</words>  
Inside the cramped module, Elias, an exorcist burdened by stage fright, carefully arranged pressed wildflowers beside the half-assembled toy spaceship, his trembling fingers betraying his anxiety. <words>52</words>  
He had inherited this strange profession from his father, along with a tangled web of lies about courage and destiny, a legacy he now struggled to reconcile. <words>77</words>  
Elias knew the entity haunting the station fed on fear, thriving in the shadows of doubt, and his own insecurities made him the perfect prey. <words>100</words>  
Yet, amid toy assembly, he found a fragile defiance, a quiet determination to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," to prove that bravery could bloom even in the most unlikely hearts. <words>133</words>  
He closed his eyes, breathing deeply, allowing the defiant hush within him to submerge his fears beneath a calm resolve. <words>152</words>  
Suddenly, the silence shattered by the sound of a key turning in a lock, a metallic echo reverberating through the station, signaling the entity's arrival. <words>176</words>  
Elias's pulse quickened, his throat tightening, but he clutched the pressed wildflowers tightly, their delicate petals a reminder of life's resilience amid darkness. <words>199</words>  
The door creaked open slowly, revealing a shadowy figure, its form shifting and uncertain, embodying the lies Elias had inherited, the doubts that had haunted him since childhood. <words>226</words>  
He stepped forward, voice shaking but resolute, reciting the ancient incantation his father had taught him, each word a defiant whisper against the oppressive silence. <words>250</words>  
The entity hissed, recoiling slightly, but Elias pressed on, his voice gaining strength as he confronted the falsehoods that had defined his life. <words>271</words>  
"You are nothing but the lies I've been told," he declared firmly, holding the wildflowers aloft, their colors vibrant against the sterile metal walls. <words>294</words>  
The shadow writhed, attempting to intimidate him, but Elias refused to falter, his courage growing with each syllable, each truth spoken aloud. <words>316</words>  
"I choose to believe in possibility," he continued, his voice steady now, the stage fright submerged beneath newfound conviction. <words>333</words>  
The entity shrieked, its form dissolving into wisps of smoke, dissipating into the void beyond the station's windows, leaving only silence and clarity behind. <words>357</words>  
Elias exhaled slowly, heart still racing, but a quiet pride filled him, knowing he had faced his deepest fears and emerged stronger. <words>379</words>  
He knelt beside the toy spaceship, resuming its assembly with steady hands, each piece fitting together smoothly, symbolizing the reconstruction of his own identity. <words>403</words>  
As he placed the final component, Elias smiled softly, understanding that courage was not the absence of fear, but the defiant choice to confront it, to unlock possibility from the chains of inherited lies. <words>437</words>  
Outside, the orbital debris continued its silent dance, indifferent to human struggles, yet bearing witness to one man's quiet triumph amid the vastness of space. <words>462</words>
