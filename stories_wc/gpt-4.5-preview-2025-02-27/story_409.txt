The chisel struck marble, and at that precise instant, Elias opened his eyes, gasping in the dusty attic filled with clockwork animals. <words>21</words>  
He sat up slowly, ribs aching, a bruised fighter whose battles were fought not in rings but within forgotten dreams. <words>41</words>  
Around him, mechanical creatures lay dormant, their brass gears silent, their glass eyes staring blankly into shadows. <words>58</words>  
He had hidden here, among these lifeless companions, skillfully incompetent at facing the truths he had long avoided. <words>76</words>  
Yet tonight, something had shifted; the sculptor's chisel had cracked open more than marble—it had fractured Elias's last vestige of self-deception. <words>97</words>  
He reached into his pocket, fingers trembling, and withdrew the clay pot shard he had carried for years, its inscription worn smooth by anxious fingertips. <words>121</words>  
The shard was all that remained of his father's legacy, a man who had stood unwaveringly for something Elias had never fully understood. <words>144</words>  
Now, in the attic's dim glow, Elias traced the faded letters, feeling their meaning pulse beneath his skin, demanding acknowledgment. <words>164</words>  
He had spent years abducting himself from reality, slipping away through forgotten dreams, avoiding the confrontation with his father's ideals. <words>184</words>  
But tonight, the sculptor's strike had resonated through marble and memory alike, forcing Elias to confront the truth he had skillfully evaded. <words>205</words>  
He rose unsteadily, the attic floor creaking beneath his weight, and approached the largest clockwork animal—a lion whose mane was tarnished brass. <words>227</words>  
With hesitant fingers, Elias wound the key protruding from its side, and the lion shuddered to life, gears clicking rhythmically. <words>246</words>  
Its glass eyes glowed softly, illuminating the attic and casting long shadows that danced across the walls, mirroring Elias's inner turmoil. <words>267</words>  
He whispered the inscription aloud, voice shaking, "Stand firm, even when the world crumbles beneath your feet." <words>281</words>  
The lion tilted its head, as if understanding, and Elias felt a strange kinship with this mechanical creature, both of them awakened from long slumber. <words>304</words>  
He realized then that his incompetence had been deliberate, a skillful avoidance of responsibility, a refusal to stand for anything meaningful. <words>325</words>  
But now, the attic air thick with dust and revelation, Elias knew he could no longer abduct himself from the truth. <words>345</words>  
He would face the world bruised but resolute, carrying the shard as a reminder of the strength required to stand firm. <words>366</words>  
The lion stepped forward, gears humming, and Elias placed a hand upon its cold metal flank, feeling courage flow between them. <words>387</words>  
Together, they moved toward the attic door, ready to descend into the world below, leaving behind forgotten dreams and self-deception. <words>408</words>  
As Elias opened the door, the sculptor's chisel struck marble once more, echoing through time, marking the moment he finally chose to stand. <words>431</words>
