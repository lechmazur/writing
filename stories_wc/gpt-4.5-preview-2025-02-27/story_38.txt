Between subway stops, Elias scribbled verses into his worn notebook, the pages meticulously messy with ink smudges and half-finished thoughts. <words>20</words>  
Sleep had abandoned him long ago, replaced by restless nights spent pacing the haunted attic above his apartment, where whispers lingered in the shadows. <words>42</words>  
He had moved there to escape the noise of the city, only to find himself surrounded by warnings in whispers, ghostly murmurs that spoke of regret and lost opportunities. <words>69</words>  
The attic was cluttered with botanical samples, dried and pressed flowers collected from forgotten gardens, each specimen labeled carefully yet chaotically, mirroring Elias's own fragmented mind. <words>94</words>  
He believed these plants held secrets, subtle lessons in resilience and fragility, their silent beauty a testament to the power of non-violence he desperately sought to understand. <words>120</words>  
Yet, Elias was haunted by his past, by the violence of words he had once wielded carelessly, poems that had wounded hearts and severed friendships. <words>143</words>  
Determined to eliminate this destructive impulse, he began attending after-parties, places where drunken confessions flowed freely, hoping to purge his guilt through honest revelation. <words>167</words>  
At these gatherings, Elias listened intently, absorbing the slurred truths of strangers, their admissions of envy, betrayal, and longing echoing his own hidden fears. <words>189</words>  
He discovered that beneath the surface of laughter and music lay an empty abundance, a hollow richness that masked deeper loneliness and regret. <words>211</words>  
One night, between subway stops, Elias overheard a whispered warning from a fellow passenger, a woman clutching a bouquet of wilted roses, her voice trembling with urgency. <words>235</words>  
"Words can heal or destroy," she murmured softly, eyes fixed on the dying petals, "choose carefully, poet." <words>250</words>  
Her words resonated deeply, echoing the whispers of the attic, the silent lessons of his botanical samples, and the drunken confessions he had absorbed. <words>272</words>  
Returning home, Elias ascended to the attic, the whispers growing louder, more insistent, urging him toward clarity. <words>288</words>  
He spread his botanical samples across the floor, their delicate forms illuminated by moonlight filtering through cracked windows, each plant a silent poem of survival. <words>313</words>  
In that moment, Elias understood the true power of non-violenceâ€”not merely the absence of harm, but the deliberate choice to nurture, to heal, to forgive. <words>338</words>  
He began writing anew, crafting verses that spoke gently yet firmly, poems that whispered warnings of compassion and empathy, carefully eliminating cruelty from his art. <words>363</words>  
At the next after-party, Elias stood quietly, notebook in hand, and shared his own drunken confession, his voice steady despite the alcohol, his words resonating with sincerity. <words>388</words>  
He spoke of haunted attics and sleepless nights, of botanical samples and whispered warnings, of the meticulous messiness of life and the courage required to choose kindness. <words>415</words>  
The room fell silent, the empty abundance momentarily filled with genuine connection, as listeners recognized their own struggles reflected in Elias's poetry. <words>436</words>  
Between subway stops, Elias finally closed his eyes, sleep returning gently, his heart lighter, his conscience clear, having discovered the profound strength hidden within whispers and the quiet power of non-violence. <words>466</words>
