In the frostbitten silence of the Arctic, amid playground time for the researchers' children, the old-fashioned mage stood quietly within the glass walls of the greenhouse, his breath misting softly against the chilled panes. <words>33</words>  
He had journeyed purposefully aimless across continents, guided only by ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections that whispered cryptic clues, each reflection a fleeting fragment of an unfolding riddle. <words>62</words>  
Now, in this isolated sanctuary of warmth and greenery, he held tightly in his weathered hands a fragment of a pharaoh's coffin, its ancient wood etched with symbols that pulsed faintly beneath his fingertips. <words>95</words>  
The mage had spent lifetimes chasing mysteries, but this artifact, stolen from the sands of Egypt and carried northward, promised answers to questions he had not yet dared to ask. <words>124</words>  
Outside, laughter echoed faintly as children played, oblivious to the sanctified dread that filled the mage's heart, a dread born from the knowledge that he stood on the precipice of claiming an uncharted frontier of forbidden knowledge. <words>162</words>  
He raised the coffin fragment toward the greenhouse's reflective glass, and as his reflection shimmered into view, it shifted subtly, becoming a younger version of himself, eyes wide with innocence and wonder. <words>194</words>  
The mage reached out, fingers trembling, longing to cuddle the ephemeral image of his lost youth, but the reflection dissolved into mist, leaving behind only a whispered clue: "Seek the heart beneath the ice." <words>229</words>  
Driven by this cryptic message, he knelt among the greenhouse plants, digging gently into the soil, uncovering a hidden trapdoor that led downward into darkness. <words>252</words>  
Descending cautiously, the mage entered a subterranean chamber carved from ice, its walls shimmering with ancient runes that matched those on the coffin fragment. <words>274</words>  
At the chamber's center stood a mirror of polished obsidian, reflecting not his own image, but that of the pharaoh whose coffin fragment he carried, eyes blazing with eternal judgment. <words>304</words>  
"You seek to claim what is not yours," the pharaoh's reflection intoned, voice resonating with sanctified dread, "yet your purposefully aimless journey has brought you precisely where destiny demands." <words>331</words>  
The mage bowed his head respectfully, acknowledging the truth of the pharaoh's words, understanding now that his lifelong wandering had been guided by forces beyond his comprehension. <words>356</words>  
"Tell me," he whispered humbly, "what frontier am I meant to claim?" <words>367</words>  
The pharaoh's reflection softened, eyes filled with ancient sorrow, and replied gently, "The frontier within yourself, the uncharted territory of your own heart and soul." <words>391</words>  
With tears freezing upon his cheeks, the mage embraced this revelation, realizing that the greatest riddles were not found in distant lands or ancient artifacts, but within the ephemeral reflections of one's own spirit. <words>425</words>  
Above, the children's laughter continued, innocent and joyful, as the mage emerged from beneath the ice, forever changed, ready at last to cuddle the fleeting moments of life with newfound purpose. <words>456</words>
