When the orchard dog finally stopped barking at night, Elias knew it was time to move. <words>15</words>  
He slipped quietly through the shadows, his gentle fingers brushing the hilt of the sword at his side, a weapon he wielded with reluctant grace. <words>37</words>  
The dinosaur skeleton museum stood silent and dark, its towering fossils casting eerie silhouettes beneath the pale moonlight filtering through high windows. <words>57</words>  
Elias had always been a late bloomer, slow to master swordsmanship, slower still to understand the complexities of his own heart. <words>78</words>  
Yet tonight, his delayed awakening would finally bear fruit, guided by the coded angles etched into a half-painted sundial hidden deep within the museum's fossil exhibit. <words>103</words>  
He moved swiftly past the towering bones of ancient beasts, their empty eye sockets watching him with silent judgment. <words>122</words>  
In his pocket, Elias carried an empty matchbox, a keepsake from a faithfully unfaithful lover who had once promised him the universe, only to vanish into the night. <words>149</words>  
He had spent years chasing echoes of that promise, driven by a yearning to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, to grasp the infinite and hold it close. <words>176</words>  
Tonight, the sundial's cryptic angles would finally reveal the path to his heart's desire, a secret hidden by a xenophile scholar who had once traveled the world collecting wisdom from distant lands. <words>208</words>  
Elias reached the sundial, its half-painted face illuminated faintly by moonlight, and carefully deciphered the angles, each line a clue pointing toward the museum's hidden heart. <words>235</words>  
With brusque affection, he traced the sundial's markings, feeling a strange kinship with the scholar who had left behind this puzzle, a fellow seeker who had loved the world too deeply to remain faithful to any single place. <words>273</words>  
The angles guided him to a hidden alcove behind the massive ribcage of a Tyrannosaurus rex, where a small, ornate box rested atop a pedestal. <words>296</words>  
Elias opened it gently, his breath catching as he saw a tiny crystal sphere nestled within, shimmering softly with captured starlight. <words>318</words>  
He lifted it carefully, feeling the universe pulse warmly in his palm, a delicate cosmos cradled in his cupped hand. <words>338</words>  
In that moment, Elias understood the scholar's restless heart, the faithfully unfaithful wanderer who had loved too broadly to remain bound to one place or person. <words>364</words>  
He realized that his own late blooming had been necessary, a slow journey toward understanding the vastness of love and the gentle strength required to hold it. <words>390</words>  
As dawn approached, Elias placed the empty matchbox beside the crystal sphere, leaving behind the memory of past betrayals and embracing the infinite possibilities ahead. <words>415</words>  
He stepped out into the orchard, the dog now peacefully asleep, and smiled softly, ready at last to faithfully wander, sword at his side, heart open to the universe. <words>444</words>
