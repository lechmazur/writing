The instant the frozen computer finally restarted, Milo felt a strange jolt ripple through the reclaimed orchard farmland nestled within the toppled skyscraper. <words>22</words>  
He stretched, energetically lethargic, his limbs heavy yet buzzing with anticipation, as if invisible allies whispered encouragement from the shadows. <words>42</words>  
Milo had always been a bluffing swindler, charming his way through life with a smile and a wink, but today he carried a blank price tag in his pocket, symbolizing a truth he desperately needed to bare. <words>78</words>  
He wandered through the orchard, the scent of ripe apples mingling with rusted metal beams, the gentle harshness of nature reclaiming humanity's forgotten ambitions. <words>101</words>  
As he moved, Milo's fingers brushed against the blank price tag, its emptiness magnetizing his thoughts, pulling him toward the revelation he feared yet craved. <words>125</words>  
Distracted, he stumbled slightly, dropping the worn book he'd been clutching tightly, its pages fluttering open onto the grass-covered floor. <words>145</words>  
A soft voice broke the silence, "You dropped something," and Milo turned to see a woman picking up his book, her eyes curious and kind. <words>169</words>  
Their fingers brushed as she handed it back, a meet-cute sparked by chance, yet somehow feeling orchestrated by those invisible allies guiding his path. <words>192</words>  
"I'm Lena," she said softly, her gaze drifting toward the blank price tag peeking from his pocket, curiosity evident in her gentle expression. <words>215</words>  
"Milo," he replied, suddenly aware of the weight of his secret, the truth he carried that no one else dared to handle. <words>236</words>  
Together, they walked deeper into the orchard, Lena's presence comforting yet challenging, her quiet strength compelling him to confront the truth he'd long avoided. <words>260</words>  
"Why the blank tag?" Lena asked, her voice gentle yet firm, embodying the gentle harshness of their surroundings. <words>278</words>  
Milo hesitated, his bluffing instincts urging him to deflect, but the magnetizing pull of honesty was stronger now, amplified by Lena's earnest gaze. <words>301</words>  
"I've spent my life selling illusions," he admitted quietly, "but the truth is, we're all afraid to acknowledge the real cost of our choices." <words>326</words>  
Lena nodded thoughtfully, her eyes reflecting understanding, as if she too had invisible allies guiding her toward this moment of revelation. <words>348</words>  
Around them, the orchard seemed to breathe, the toppled skyscraper's skeletal remains framing their conversation, a silent witness to humanity's forgotten truths. <words>371</words>  
"Maybe," Lena whispered, "it's time we stopped bluffing and faced the price we've left blank for too long." <words>389</words>  
Milo felt a weight lift from his shoulders, replaced by a newfound clarity, the invisible allies now visible in Lena's steady presence beside him. <words>412</words>  
Together, they stood amidst the orchard's quiet reclamation, ready to confront the truths others feared, their hearts magnetized by honesty and courage. <words>434</words>  
As the computer hummed softly in the distance, finally awake, Milo knew this meet-cute had been no accident, but a gentle push toward the truth he'd always needed. <words>461</words>
