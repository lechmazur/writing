The street fell silent again, the echo of the car's backfire fading into the hush of night, leaving only the weary undertaker standing alone beneath the shadow of the ancient Persian palace. <words>32</words>  
He had long grown accustomed to silence, yet tonight it felt heavier, more profound, as if the world itself had paused to watch his next move. <words>57</words>  
In his trembling hands, he held an astronomical clock, its intricate gears and celestial dials gleaming faintly under the pale moonlight. <words>77</words>  
This clock, rarely practical in its complexity, had been passed down through generations, a relic embodying the tribal knowledge of his ancestors who once charted destinies by following sun paths. <words>107</words>  
Tonight, however, practicality mattered little; tonight, the clock was his only hope, his only weapon against the absolute dark that threatened to consume him. <words>130</words>  
He stepped forward, entering the palace's grand hall, its walls reimagined with faded murals depicting ancient Persian kings and celestial bodies intertwined in eternal dance. <words>154</words>  
The undertaker moved with placid ferocity, each step deliberate, each breath measured, as he traced the sun paths etched into the marble floor, paths taught to him through whispered stories and secret rituals. <words>187</words>  
He knew the palace well, its corridors and chambers mapped in his memory, yet tonight it felt alien, transformed by shadows into a labyrinth designed to imprison the unwary. <words>216</words>  
His heart quickened as he reached the central chamber, a vast circular room crowned by a dome painted with constellations, stars glittering faintly in the dimness. <words>241</words>  
Here, at the heart of the palace, the astronomical clock began to hum softly, its gears turning in harmony with the celestial patterns above. <words>263</words>  
He placed the clock carefully upon a pedestal, aligning its dials precisely with the sun paths, knowing that only by following these ancient instructions could he imprison the darkness that haunted him. <words>296</words>  
As the clock clicked into place, a low rumble filled the chamber, and shadows began to swirl, coalescing into a form that embodied his deepest fears. <words>321</words>  
Yet the undertaker stood firm, his weariness replaced by determination, his eyes reflecting the faint glow of the clock as it pulsed with ancient power. <words>345</words>  
He whispered the tribal incantations passed down through generations, words rarely practical in the modern world but now essential, binding the darkness within the celestial patterns. <words>371</words>  
The shadows writhed and struggled, but the undertaker's voice remained steady, his hope unwavering even as the darkness pressed against the boundaries of its celestial prison. <words>397</words>  
Finally, with a final surge of placid ferocity, he completed the incantation, and the darkness was drawn inexorably into the astronomical clock, imprisoned within its intricate gears and dials. <words>426</words>  
Silence returned, deeper and more profound than before, yet now it was a silence filled with peace, a silence that spoke of victory and hope reclaimed. <words>451</words>  
The weary undertaker lifted the clock gently, feeling its warmth, knowing that as long as he held onto this tribal knowledge, the absolute dark would remain imprisoned, and hope would endure. <words>482</words>
