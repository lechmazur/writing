The garden had not seen sunlight in three thousand years when the coral finally stopped screaming. [13] Corvin stood chest-deep in the hydrothermal current, calcified fingers trailing through anemones that bloomed like violet bruises against his granite wrists. [27] He was a living statue, telepathic, and the silence in his mind now was heavier than the blackwater pressing against the glass dome above. [43] After revealing the secret—that the garden's caretakers had not ascended but drowned themselves in mercy—he had expected absolution or rage, not this hollow suspension between certainties. [63] The ampoule pulsed in his palm, its glass stained the precise purple of foxglove petals, toxic and medicinal both. [81] Inside swam a single preserved thought from the city's architect, suspended in saline and regret. [96] Corvin needed to thread this memory through the garden's neural network of roots, but the cascading revelations had fractured his purpose into prismatic doubt. [116] If the caretakers were murderers and saviors both, if the garden was prison and sanctuary, then what truth deserved propagation? [134] He moved through the kelp forest toward the eastern quadrant where the dome's lattice had developed a structural weakness centuries ago, a hairline fissure where the ocean's pressure met the city's defiance. [162] This was how he would enter—not through ceremony, but through the flaw. [175] The water here tasted of iron and old light. [183] Through the telepathic static, he felt the garden dreaming. [193] It remembered being alive, before the cement, before the surety. [204] Corvin pressed his incisively kind attention against the substrate, cutting not to wound but to illuminate, separating necrotic belief from healthy tissue. [226] He understood now that his motivation was not to restore the garden's former glory, but to welcome nuance into the certainty that had petrified it. [248] The binary of saved and damned had calcified the roots; he needed to teach them gradient, spectrum, mercy with edges. [265] The foxglove ampoule warmed against his stone skin as he reached the fissure. [280] Here, the method became clear: he would thread the architect's ambivalence through the crack, letting the structural weakness serve as conduit rather than catastrophe. [304] The revelation had already happened—the secret exposed—but now came the harder work of animating the lifeless philosophy that remained. [325] Corvin shattered the ampoule against the fracture. [334] Purple smoke, the color of cardiac arrest and healing tincture both, ribboned into the hydrothermal vent. [351] He projected his telepathy into the breach, incisively kind, cutting through the sediment of dogma to find the living doubt beneath. [371] The garden shuddered. [375] Roots that had grown rigid in their vertical certainty began to spiral, questioning their own geometry. [392] The cascade continued: if the caretakers were complex, then their creations must be complex, then their destroyers must be complex, then Corvin himself—statue, witness, traitor, midwife—must be complex. [428] Through the structural weakness, the memory propagated. [438] The dome did not collapse; it breathed. [445] Bioluminescent plankton awakened in chains of logic, each photon a question mark. [460] Corvin felt the garden's consciousness threading back toward him, no longer a monoculture of obedience but a polyculture of maybe. [481] He stood in the shifting light, granite heart accommodating the pressure of contradiction. [496] The animate lifelessness of the place—stone that breathed, water that remembered, dead architects speaking through poison flowers—no longer seemed paradoxical but honest. [522] To welcome nuance into certainty was to admit that survival required the structural weakness, the fissure where change could enter. [547] The coral resumed its ancient murmur, no longer screaming but singing in a key that contained both major and minor, both salt and sweet. [571] Corvin settled into the silt, telepathic receptors open to the cascading revelations that would continue, he knew, until every absolute in the drowned city had dissolved into the wisdom of the ampoule's purple haze: that mercy and judgment could share the same stained-glass vessel, that to heal often required the precision of the knife. [650] He waited, incisively kind, for the garden to finish its slow, uncertain awakening. [669]
