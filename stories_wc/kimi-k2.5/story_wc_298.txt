Elias knelt between the ribs of a nameless saint, tracing how the pear tree's roots coiled through the bone like a promise kept too long. [26] The catacomb orchard breathed around him, half-lit corridors glowing with foxfire fungus that clung to the vaulted ceilings above, casting everything in the amber of dying afternoon despite the eternal midnight of the underground. [30] He was a reckless idealist, they had warned him, but warnings were merely punctuation in a language he refused to speak, especially when the grammar of grief demanded action. [26] In his palm rested the burned tarot card, the Tower reduced to charcoal at its edges, yet the lightning-struck spire still visible at its center like a scar that refused to fade. [26] He had drawn it three years ago, saw his own collapse inscribed in the ink, and had burned it in a copper bowl, believing destruction could rewrite prophecy through sheer force of will. [28] But bartered destinies were not so easily cheated; the card had reappeared in his pocket this morning, smelling of smoke and wet earth, its return a verdict rather than a gift. [27] Now he moved through the orchard with dusky resolve, each step measured, each breath a negotiation with the dark that pressed against the margins of his lantern light. [23] The roots here did not discriminate between soil and skeleton, inlaying meaning everywhere—he saw a future in the bifurcation of a root, a warning in the way a femur cracked beneath his boot, a benediction in the moss that softened a skull's hollow eye. [33] Elias interpreted these signs with the fervor of a man translating his own death sentence, fiercely gentle as he brushed centuries of soil from a child's jawbone half-emerged from the loam. [28] He had come to patch holes in the soul, specifically the hollow place where his sister's laughter used to reside before the fever took her in three days of burning and silence. [25] The old texts suggested that in this place, where the dead fed the living trees, one could trammel a wandering destiny—catch it like a moth in a jar—and trade it for another, stitching the torn fabric of fate with threads borrowed from the living. [36] It was reckless, idealistic, impossible, the mathematics of a heart that refused to accept subtraction. [15] He continued deeper, past trees whose fruit was pale as bone, whose leaves whispered names not spoken for generations. [19] The half-light shifted, corridors branching into shadows that moved like liquid mercury, and Elias felt the weight of every destiny that had ever passed through this place pressing against his ribs. [26] He reached the heart-tree, its trunk thick as a cathedral pillar, roots tangled through a carpet of bones that formed a pattern too deliberate to be natural, a tapestry of endings woven into beginnings. [29] Here, the barrier between what was and what could be grew thin as parchment, permeable as smoke. [15] He placed the burned card against the bark, feeling the residual heat of his own failed arson pulse against the wood. [17] The tree shuddered, recognizing the currency of fate, the economics of souls. [11] "Take mine," Elias whispered, pressing his forehead to the grain, feeling the fiercely gentle pulse of sap and memory thrumming beneath the bark. [20] "Give hers back. I don't need the years; I need her voice in the world again." [16] The roots began to move, not with violence but with the slow inevitability of growth that cannot be argued with, trammeling his ankles, his wrists, binding him to the orchard floor with bonds softer than silk and stronger than iron. [30] He did not struggle; this was the price of barter, the restriction of one path to open another, the admission that a single soul could not fill two voids. [24] As the roots inlayed their meaning into his skin—stories of every soul that had fed this grove, every love surrendered, every destiny traded for love—Elias felt the holes in his soul beginning to close, not with his sister's returned spirit, but with the acceptance that some destinies could not be traded, only shared, and that to trammel oneself to grief was its own form of freedom. [60] The burned tarot card crumbled into ash that the bark drank greedily, and in the glow of half-lit corridors, Elias became part of the orchard, a fiercely gentle guardian of the bones, his reckless idealism finally bearing fruit that would feed the next desperate heart seeking to barter with the infinite.
