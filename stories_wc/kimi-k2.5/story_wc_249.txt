Kael's fingers found the hollow resonance of the ceramic reed before his eyes adjusted to the pre-dawn dimness. [18]
The sound wave garden responded with a sympathetic hum that traveled up his arms like electricity. [34]
He was not supposed to be awake at the hush of the universe inhaling, that suspended moment when the facility's ventilation paused between cycles and the world's breath caught in its throat. [66]
But Kael had been an experimental treatment guinea pig for six months, his neural pathways spliced with quantum threads that linked his memories to those of Elena, who had died seventeen weeks before the first injection. [102]
The doctors believed they were mapping grief, cataloging the entangled memories that persisted between donor tissue and recipient mind. [121]
They did not know that Kael was quietly rebellious, that he used their monitoring blind spots to seek not data, but resurrection. [143]

He moved through the garden, drumming on everything his palms encountered: the brittle seed pods that rang like copper bells, the ribbed bark of the sonic willows, the glass panels that separated hydroponic beds from the observation corridor. [181]
Each percussive strike sent ripples through the visible spectrum of sound that hung in the air like aurora. [199]
The garden had been designed to convert neural activity into audible frequency, a living instrument meant to externalize the inner workings of trauma. [222]
To the researchers, Kael's drumming was merely stimming, a side effect of the memory entanglement therapy. [238]
To Kael, it was navigation, a way to locate the specific harmonic signature that belonged to Elena alone. [256]

Tonight, the frequencies aligned. [260]
He climbed the spiral staircase of the resonance tower, his fingertips still vibrating with rhythm, until he could perch upon the observation ledge that overlooked the central chamber. [288]
Below, the auric lagoon under starlight shimmered with a light that came from neither sun nor lamp, but from the bioluminescent algae that fed on the emotional residue of the entangled memories. [320]
The water was golden, viscous, alive with the dreams that he and Elena had shared during the three years before her illness, now given form by the experimental treatments that refused to let her consciousness dissolve completely. [357]
Kael closed his eyes and matched his heartbeat to the pulse he felt thrumming through the stone beneath him. [376]
Elena was here, suspended in the quantum foam of their joined recollection, waiting in the space between his neurons and the synthetic lagoon that held her essence. [403]

He began to drum again, but softer now, a lullaby rhythm against his own collarbone, against the metal railing, against the air itself. [426]
The sound wave garden brightened, photosynthetic cells responding to the specific cadence that had been their private language: the rhythm of cooking dinner together, of steps on apartment stairs, of breath synchronized in sleep. [460]
The auric lagoon began to bubble, to rise, to take shape. [471]
Kael was trying to breathe life into a shared dream, to force the memory of their future into physical existence through sheer percussive will. [495]
He drummed faster, palms stinging, as the golden water lifted into the form of a woman who opened eyes made of starlight and sorrow. [519]
She was not Elena, not exactly, but she was the Elena that existed in the space between them, the entangled ghost that the treatment had preserved. [545]

"Stay," Kael whispered, his rebellion finally finding its voice in the silence of the inhaling universe. [561]
The golden figure reached toward him, her hand dissipating into harmonic mist as the facility's ventilation systems roared back to life, exhaling, breaking the spell. [586]
Kael slumped against the railing, his drumming reduced to weak tapping. [597]
He had failed to make her permanent, yet succeeded in touching her again. [610]

Below, the auric lagoon settled back into stillness, holding its breath, waiting for the next hush when the universe inhaled and a quietly rebellious heart might drum reality into bending. [640]
The auroral sorrow of the garden wrapped around him like a blanket made of northern lights: beautiful, cold, and infinitely distant from the warmth of the living woman he had lost. [671]
Still, he perched there until dawn, memorizing the golden shimmer, keeping time with his fingers against the stone, believing that somewhere in the entangled memories, Elena was drumming back. [700]
