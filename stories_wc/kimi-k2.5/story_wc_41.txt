Elias woke to the taste of rust and silver oxide, his palms pressed against a sculpture of frozen fog that hummed with the shape of a telephone he had never owned. [20] The junkyard prophet had dreamed again, but the precognitive forgetting had already begun its erasure, leaving only the hollow certainty that something important was drifting away with the morning tide. [58] He stood amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched, their magnetic ghosts whispering static between the crystalline fog formations that populated the garden. [86] Each sculpture captured a moment suspended in vapor—birthday parties where no one spoke, wedding vows in mute pantomime—all arranged like an exhibition of abandoned futures. [113]

He needed to locate the sound before the next wave of forgetting crested. [127] Elias moved through the mist, his fingers trailing across driftwood he had arranged as directional markers, spiraling inward toward the center where the fog grew dense with memory. [153] The pieces of bleached wood pointed the way through sculptures that shifted when he wasn't looking, their forms rearranging into faces he would eventually forget were his own. [181] He clutched a piece of plain chalk in his fist, its dust coating his knuckles like bone meal, the only tool that could anchor thought to physical reality before his curse unwound his intentions. [212]

The tidal longing pulled at his ribs, an ebb and flow of grief for moments he hadn't lost yet. [231] Elias was growing older here, in this place outside of time, and he had committed his life to capturing the sound of that process—the audible creak of calcium settling into bone, the whisper of cells dividing toward their own demise. [268] He knew that once he heard it, the precognitive forgetting would steal the resonance from his mind before he could name it, leaving him with only the vibration in his sternum and no language to describe the loss. [306] That was why he carried the chalk, why he arranged the markers, why he clung to echoes of footsteps he had not yet taken. [330]

He found the spot where the driftwood arrows converged, a clearing where the fog sculptures formed a spiral amphitheater around a still point. [354] Here, the hush deepened, the videotape silence pressing against his eardrums with physical weight. [369] Elias pressed the chalk against a flat stone and waited, listening to the fog. [382] The sound came not as noise but as pressure—a frequency that existed in the spaces between heartbeats, the acoustic shadow of entropy accelerating. [406]

He wrote furiously on the stone, musical notations and logarithmic spirals, desperate to trap the sound of growing older in mathematical permanence before the forgetting tide washed in. [432] His hand moved automatically, the chalk squeaking against stone, while his mind began to unspool. [448] He was arranging the driftwood markers, he remembered, but could not recall why. [462] He was clinging to echoes, yes, but echoes of what? [473] The tidal longing surged, drowning him in desire for something he could no longer name. [488]

Elias looked down at the chalk marks, complex and beautiful and utterly meaningless to him now. [502] The precognitive forgetting had completed its circuit, leaving him stranded in the present with a map to a treasure he had already buried in his own future. [527] He touched the piece of plain chalk, now worn to a nub, and felt the vibration in his chest that indicated he had succeeded in his life's work. [552] Around him, the fog sculptures continued their silent vigil, and the driftwood markers pointed inward toward a man who would spend eternity trying to locate a sound he could never keep. [580] In the hush of old videotapes left unwatched, the junkyard prophet began again, drawing new arrows in the dust, compelled by a longing that moved through him like the tide, searching for the echo of a purpose he would forever approach but never hold.
