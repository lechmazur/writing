Mara stood beneath the rain-beaded skylight, counting the seconds until the kettle screamed. [13]
The ash wood carving blank sat heavy in her palms, its grain running like the stripes she used to brush on her husband's lions. [37]
Three years since the accident, yet the loft still smelled of sawdust and mane conditioner, a scent that refused to dissipate. [58]
She positioned the blank on her workbench, aligning it with the gray light filtering through the water-streaked glass above. [77]
Each raindrop acted as a lens, crystallizing time into suspended prisms that fractured the afternoon into static moments. [95]
Here and gone, she thought, watching a droplet slide down the pane—present for an instant, then tracing into oblivion. [114]
Just like Viktor had been: solid, warm, then suddenly absent. [124]
The kettle began its low murmur, and Mara retrieved her chisel with a hauntingly practical precision. [140]
She had learned early in her marriage to the lion tamer that grief, like wild animals, required containment through ritual rather than force. [163]
The blank had been cut from the tree that shadowed their training tent, the same ash whose roots had drunk in decades of sawdust and roars. [189]
As the water heated, she began to carve, letting the blade bite into the pale wood. [205]
She worked to harvest lessons from loss, shaping the blank into a handle for the very kettle now singing on the stove. [227]
It was a task Viktor would have appreciated—the transformation of raw material into function, the way a lion tamer turned chaos into grace. [250]
The skylight wept steadily above her, each bead of rain a tiny clock measuring the boiling point. [267]
Through crystallized time, she saw him again: not the fallen body the circus had shipped home, but the man who taught her that presence was a posture, not a permanence. [297]
The chisel moved steadily, containing her sorrow within the emerging curves of the handle. [311]
Here and gone. [314]
The phrase had become her mantra, neither bitter nor resigned, but rust-hued peace settling over her shoulders like an old shawl. [335]
The wood revealed its secrets as she worked—the tight grain near the center, the softer edges where decay had nearly claimed it before the fall. [360]
She carved away what was unnecessary, exposing the strength within. [370]
The kettle reached its crescendo, steam escaping in a sharp whistle that cut through the rain's percussion. [387]
Mara set down her chisel, examining the half-finished handle. [396]
It would hold heat without burning, serve without breaking, endure through years of boiling water and morning rituals. [414]
A hauntingly practical immortality. [418]
She rose and silenced the kettle, pouring the water over tea leaves that unfurled like waking cats. [435]
Returning to her bench, she traced the carved grooves with a thumb calloused from decades of holding ropes and reins and now tools. [458]
The skylight continued its weeping, but the light had shifted, turning the rain beads into amber and gold. [476]
Viktor had taught her that every performance ended, every lion eventually returned to instinct, every ringmaster lowered the lights. [495]
But he had also shown her that the space between here and gone was infinite if you paid attention, if you shaped the absence into something usable. [522]
The ash wood blank was no longer blank; it held the architecture of her survival. [537]
While the kettle boiled, she had contained multitudes—not the man himself, which was impossible, but the lesson that love was a form of woodworking. [561]
You took what the storm offered, what the lightning struck, and you carved it into handles, into spoons, into the means of holding on without clutching. [587]
The tea cooled on the workbench as the rain slowed above the skylight. [600]
Mara lifted the unfinished handle to the light, watching how the crystallized droplets magnified the grain into rivers and canyons. [620]
Here and gone, yes, but here transformed. [627]
She would finish the carving tomorrow, sand it smooth, treat it with oil until it gleamed like a cat's eye in darkness. [649]
For now, she sat in her rust-hued peace, drinking tea beneath the weeping glass, holding the weight of ash and absence and practical, haunting beauty. [674]
The lions were gone, the tent folded, the crowds dispersed, but the wood remained, teachable and taught. [691]
When the rain stopped, the skylight cleared, and the ordinary afternoon resumed its march. [705]
But Mara had captured something in the crystallized minutes while the water boiled—an understanding that grief, properly carved, became furniture for the soul. [728]
She set down her cup and picked up the chisel once more, ready to contain what remained. [745]
The loft breathed around her, filled with steam and fresh-cut wood, a testament to the widow who knew harvesting lessons from loss meant not forgetting, but shaping memory into handle, heft, and daily use. [779]
Outside, the world dried, but here, in the suspended moment between boil and pour, the ash wood waited to become essential. [800]
