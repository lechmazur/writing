The amber grotto breathed at dusk, its resinous walls glowing with captured sunsets that refused to fade. [17] Kael stood at the center, professionally thorough in arranging the glass vials across the limestone altar, each containing synthetic sorrow and manufactured joy. [40] As a counterfeit emotion dealer, Kael had built a reputation on half truths—never claiming the feelings were genuine, yet never admitting how hollow they truly were. [64] Tonight's client required something precise: empathy without the burden of understanding. [74] Kael withdrew the fragrance chemist's blotter petal from its velvet pouch, the white paper strip still bearing ghost-scents of bergamot and benzoin from its previous life testing perfumes. [100] This object served as the substrate, the canvas upon which counterfeit emotions would bloom and be absorbed. [116] The grotto's atmosphere crackled with potential, dry air generating static electricity that danced across Kael's fingertips. [130] This was how Kael sensed the client's approach—not through sound, but through the prickling charge that raised arm hairs and made the vials tremble in their depressions. [156] The method of sensing through static electricity had never failed in this particular cave, where ancient tree-resin conducted atmospheric whispers. [175] "You're late," Kael said, watching the shadows lengthen across the amber walls. [185] The client emerged, a figure half-formed, midway through becoming something else entirely. [196] "The transformation completes in minutes," the client hissed, voice distorting as bones shifted beneath translucent skin. [210] "I need to feel what I am becoming before I finish becoming it." [222] Kael understood this need perfectly, though maintained an affectionate detachment from the suffering about to unfold. [235] To fuse insight with empathy—that was Kael's true motivation beneath the commerce, the secret ambition to create not just copies of feelings, but bridges between knowing and feeling. [261] Kael applied the synthetic compound to the blotter petal, watching it darken as it absorbed the chemical mimicry of compassion. [278] "It is a half truth I sell you," Kael admitted, professionally thorough in explaining the limitations even now. [293] "You will experience the sensation of understanding, but not the comprehension itself. [304] The emotion will subume your anxiety, swallow it into its structure, but it will not teach you what you wish to know about your new form." [328] The client reached for the petal with trembling fingers. [337] As the transformation completed, skin hardening into amber-like resin, eyes glazing into fossilized gold, the static electricity in the grotto peaked. [356] Kael felt it as a sharp intake of breath across the neural pathways, the charge singing of metamorphosis. [372] The client pressed the blotter petal to their tongue. [381] Immediately, the counterfeit empathy surged, and Kael watched as the manufactured emotion began to subume the creature's fear, wrapping around the panic like silk around a knife. [405] But something unexpected occurred—the half truth Kael had crafted began resonating with the grotto itself, the amber walls humming in sympathetic vibration. [425] Kael stepped back, professionally thorough nature demanding documentation of this anomaly. [435] The static electricity coalesced into visible arcs, connecting Kael to the client, the client to the walls, the walls to the petal. [453] The counterfeit emotion was evolving, drawing not just from the chemicals but from the ancient resin surrounding them. [469] As the transformation completed, the client stood fully formed, neither human nor statue but living amber. [484] Tears of liquid resin traced their cheeks—genuine tears, impossible tears. [493] "You gave me more than half," the client whispered. [502] Kael felt the static discharge, sensing through the fading electricity that something had shifted. [514] The counterfeit had become real, or perhaps the grotto had supplied what Kael's chemistry lacked. [528] In this moment, watching the newly formed being experience authentic wonder, Kael achieved the fusion long sought: insight into the mechanics of feeling finally married to empathy for those who needed it. [556] With affectionate detachment, Kael collected the empty vials. [563] "The feeling will fade by morning," Kael said, though uncertainty colored the words. [574] "Unless you return to the grotto. [580] The half truth I sold seems to have found its whole here in the amber." [595] The client touched the wall, and the grotto responded with a pulse of static that made Kael's hair stand on end. [614] "Then I shall stay," the client said. [621] "And you, dealer? [624] Will you continue selling shadows of feelings when you have seen them become substance?" [637] Kael looked at the fragrance chemist's blotter petal, now stained with real resin, and smiled with distant warmth. [652] "I will be professionally thorough in my experiments until all half truths become whole," Kael said, already sensing through the static that tomorrow's dusk would bring new transformations. [678] The amber grotto held its breath, waiting. [685]
