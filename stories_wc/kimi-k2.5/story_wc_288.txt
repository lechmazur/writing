Mira stood on the obsidian balcony of the Athenaeum, watching the cloud-ocean surge below like frozen lightning. [15] She had remembered yesterday, in the sharp pain of reincarnation memory, that she had once been brother to the Sky-Singers, those crystalline beings now extinct for three centuries. [32] The tidal library drifted on stratospheric currents, its shelves of living coral breathing in the thin atmosphere, rising and falling with the moon's pull on the upper air. [52] In her palm rested the brass sundial, its surface atomically reflective, casting no shadow yet tracking the sun's whisper across the heavens. [74] She had carried it since the awakening, this fragile object that felt both alien and intimate, a brittle awakening in physical form. [94] The Sky-Singers had made such instruments, back when they coexisted with humanity among the cirrus fields. [112] Mira walked to the northern terrace where the ancient stone circle stood, seven basalt pillars humming with subsonic resonance that vibrated in her teeth. [135] This was how she would do it, she realized—by the hum of an ancient stone circle, she could amplify the sundial's reflection and reach across the veil between her isolated present and their collective past. [162] The motivation burned in her chest: to translate isolation into independence, to stop mourning what she had been and become what she could be alone. [186] She placed the sundial in the circle's center, its atomically reflective surface catching the sun and splitting it into coherent beams that danced across the stones. [211] The humming intensified, a chord that spoke of magnetic fields and memory, and Mira felt the brittle awakening crystallize within her—not a shattering, but a delicate frost forming on the window of her understanding. [242] She was not the last companion of an extinct species; she was the first librarian of a new solitude. [260] The extinct species had not vanished completely, she now understood, but had dispersed into the cloud-tides, their consciousness becoming the very atmospheric rivers that moved her library. [286] To coexist with them did not require their physical return, but her acceptance of this translated state. [304] The brass sundial spun slowly, its polished face throwing light against each stone in sequence, writing equations of time in photons against the basalt. [329] Mira sat cross-legged within the circle, letting the hum settle her bones into resonance with the tidal library's gentle rise and fall. [351] After the reincarnation memory, she had feared the loneliness would crush her, but now she saw that isolation was merely the raw material from which independence was forged. [378] The atomically reflective surface of the sundial showed her not her own face, but the sky itself, infinite and self-sufficient. [401] As the stone circle's hum reached its crescendo, the brass instrument lifted slightly, hovering in the magnetic field, and Mira felt the last fragile piece of her old self snap cleanly away like frost from a branch. [432] She was awake now, truly, in a way that felt dangerous and necessary. [447] The tidal library groaned, shifting altitude as the upper atmosphere tides turned, carrying her higher into the cerulean expanse where the extinct species had once danced. [473] She would catalog their history not as tragedy, but as prologue. [485] The sundial settled back into her hands, warm now, its surface still atomically perfect, reflecting the sun with mathematical precision. [507] Mira smiled at her reflection, at the woman who had learned to coexist with absence by filling it with presence. [528] The stone circle quieted, its hum becoming a pulse, a heartbeat, the rhythm of a library that breathed and floated and waited for no one. [553] She descended through the spiraling stacks, past volumes that wept ink and sang when opened, carrying the brass sundial like a lantern that needed no flame. [580] The brittle awakening had passed, leaving her strong in the broken places, independent in her isolation, ready to read the next chapter written in cloud and light. [610]
