The diminutive titan stood no taller than a child, yet the weight of epochs bowed his shoulders with regally unpretentious dignity. [21] He had wandered the marble corridors of the ancient temple library lost in time since before the last ice age sealed its doors against the vulgar world. [19] Across the pause of shifting constellations, he had waited, cataloging starfalls in ledgers no human hand could lift while destiny slowly aligned above the clouds. [19]

He carried in his pocket a single iron gall ink pellet, the last remnant of a monastery dissolved by war seven centuries past. [19] With this corrosive black stone dissolved in ancient rainwater, he had spent millennia scratching cryptic messages into the margins of forgotten grimoires, leaving a trail only the true heir would recognize. [24] Each symbol he etched was a fragment of the rune of drift, a sigil that moved through time like water through stone, revealing what static truth could not see. [24]

Tonight, the ceiling of the temple opened to show stars wheeling into their final configuration, the great clock completing its cosmic cycle at last. [18] The pretender would come then, drawn by rumors of a crown hidden in the stacks, believing himself clever enough to claim what blood alone could hold legitimately. [23] The false king had ruled through deception for three decades above in the waking world, but here in the library's perfect silence, his masquerade would finally end. [23]

Footsteps echoed where none had sounded for four hundred years, disturbing the dust of ages with violent intrusion. [13] A tall man in ermine robes entered, his crown catching the moonlight that filtered through the broken dome. [15] "I have solved your riddles, little librarian," the pretender sneered, clutching a stolen key in his sweating fist. [15] "The throne is mine by right of intellect and the treasure maps I bribed from your sleeping monks before I burned their cells." [18]

The diminutive titan stepped forward with the grace of falling leaves, his bare feet making no sound on the cold marble floor. [17] He spoke no words in defense, but opened the nearest volume to reveal pages tattooed with iron gall ink that had eaten through the parchment like acid through comfortable lies. [23] The rune of drift assembled itself in the air, constructed from the scattered fragments he had hidden across ten thousand volumes, each message a coordinate in a spell of revelation. [23]

The sigil rotated slowly in the space between them, and the pretender's flesh began to loosen at the seams. [16] "What magic is this?" the false king screamed as his borrowed face sloughed away, revealing the scarred mercenary beneath the cosmetic enchantments. [18] The titan raised his small hand, and with a gesture regally unpretentious in its terrible finality, he spoke the sundering word that broke all false things apart. [20]

The rune contracted violently and the pretender's disguise split completely, not with violence, but with the inevitable separation of water from oil, truth from fabrication. [20] The man's stolen royalty peeled back like old wallpaper, revealing the desperate thief who had murdered the rightful prince in his sleep. [18] His crown clattered to the mosaic floor, rolling until it rested at the titan's bare feet, suddenly too heavy for the small man's brow to bear. [21]

"You were never king," the titan said, his voice the whisper of turning pages in an empty room. [15] "Only a borrower of glories, soon to be forgotten by history you sought to command through forged letters and poison." [17]

The temple library sighed deeply, its architecture having waited centuries to witness this justice done at last. [14] Columns that had stood since the Bronze Age now began their graceful collapse, crumbling not into rubble but into dust fine as pollen, returning to the earth from which they were quarried with quiet dignity. [26] The iron gall ink pellet in the titan's pocket dissolved into shadow, its acidic purpose complete after so long a wait. [17]

Through the dissolving roof, new constellations burned clear and cold, signaling that time would resume its natural march forward. [16] The titan walked into the falling stone and fading starlight, his task finished across the pause he had been granted by patient stars. [19] Behind him, the pretender sat amid the ruin, unmasked and alone, while the library completed its elegant dissolution into myth and memory. [19] The diminutive titan did not look back, for humility was the only crown he had ever sought to wear, and that he carried invisibly within his ancient heart. [23]
