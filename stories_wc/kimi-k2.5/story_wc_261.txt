Elias woke as the anesthesia released its hold, consciousness seeping back like water through cracked limestone. [14]
The quiet tower at dawn pressed around him, stone walls holding their breath while morning light struggled through frost-rimed windows. [26]
He touched the surgical dressing on his abdomen and winced—not from pain, but from the sudden, unwanted clarity that always followed the drugs' retreat. [43]
This was his third procedure in the tower, each one an attempt to close the chapter on his sister's death, yet Elias knew he was only opening wounds that had fossilized into scar tissue. [65]
On the windowsill sat the frosted hourglass his sister had carried through the avalanche that should have killed her but hadn't, a displaced miracle that had stolen her future and deposited it elsewhere, leaving her body intact but her mind scattered across fourteen years of silence. [101]
Elias had brought it here hoping to reverse the flow, to make the sand climb upward instead of falling. [117]
He poured cold coffee from the kettle and watched the rings form on the oak table, studying them the way his grandmother had taught him—reading the brown constellations to find where the miracle had gone wrong. [145]
The plants in the tower answered his thoughts before he spoke them, an accidental telepathy that had emerged after the first surgery when they'd grafted skin from his thigh to cover the excavation site where they'd removed the tumor. [179]
The ivy on the western wall whispered of roots tunneling through foundations, of slow pressure applied over decades, and Elias understood that some scars told stories only if you listened to the witnesses who had watched them form. [210]
He stood, steadying himself against the stone, and moved toward the spiral staircase that descended into darkness. [226]
The meteor hush of early morning filled the space between heartbeats, that specific silence that preceded impact or revelation, the universe holding its breath while atoms aligned. [248]
Elias needed to learn to read the stories in scars—not just his own puckered surgical lines, but the tower's ancient masonry, the striations in the bedrock, the ghost-prints left by his sister's fingers on the hourglass glass before the frost had formed inside it. [284]
The plants urged him downward, their root-systems mapping a tunnel beneath the tower that the original architects had sealed three centuries ago, a passage that led to the cavern where the meteor had struck, displacing the miracle that should have been his sister's recovery into something else entirely. [332]
He traced the coffee rings on his palm, seeing now that they spelled coordinates, or perhaps a timeline, the brown circles indicating when the sand in the hourglass had frozen—not stopped, but crystallized, preserving a single second of consciousness that his sister still inhabited somewhere. [376]
The tunnel entrance gaped behind the wine cellar, and Elias descended into the earth, the anesthesia fully worn off now, every nerve screaming with the clarity of unmedicated perception. [406]
Roots brushed his face like fingers, communicating in chlorophyll and slow time: she is here, she has always been here, waiting for someone to open the wound rather than suture it closed. [435]
The frosted hourglass grew warm in his pocket as he tunneled deeper, the sand inside vibrating with the frequency of his sister's trapped thoughts. [459]
He understood then that seeking closure had been the error; some miracles were not meant to resolve but to remain displaced, jagged edges that refused to heal because they contained truths that needed air. [493]
The cavern opened like a scar itself, and in the center lay the meteor, cold now, humming with the hush of cosmic impact, and beside it his sister's body—perfectly preserved, breathing, her eyes open and full of frost. [532]
Elias knelt and examined the rings on the cavern floor, geological coffee stains left by ancient water, reading the story they told: the avalanche had been no accident, the surgeries had mapped this path, the telepathy was not with plants but with her, transmitted through root and stone, waiting for him to stop seeking endings and start witnessing. [600]
He reached out, touching her hand, and the hourglass in his pocket shattered, the frost spreading outward, binding them together in the silence after the meteor's fall, the dawn light finally reaching even this deep place, illuminating the scars that were not endings but alphabets, finally legible. [653]
Elias spoke the first word. [657]
