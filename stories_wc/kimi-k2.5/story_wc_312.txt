Elara was not a powerful mage, merely lukewarm in her abilities, yet she stood upon the sapphire viaduct at dawn with the broken ship's bell cradled in her arms. [26] The aqueduct arched over the salt-crusted basin where the ocean had been, its blue stone glowing in the first light like a promise half-kept. [47] She had come here after the last fish was caught, when the nets came up empty and the tides ceased their breathing, to right the cosmic imbalance that had silenced the deep. [76] Her devotion was brittle, held together by willpower thinner than spider silk, but it was all she possessed. [94] She was earnestly naive enough to believe that old magic could be rebuilt, that the world could be mended by someone who had barely mastered elementary hydrospells. [119] The bell had once hung on the fleet's flagship, but now its bronze clapper lay shattered, its voice stolen by the same drought that had taken the sea. [145] Elara set to work as the sun breached the horizon, measuring the dripping rates of condensation that fell from the viaduct's arches. [169] Each drop from the damp stone above fell at intervals of seven seconds, a rhythm she recorded with trembling fingers against her chronograph. [193] She understood that rebuilding required precision, not power; that to reconstruct the bell's resonance, she must calibrate her spellwork to the natural cadence of the remaining water. [222] The lukewarm nature of her magic meant she could not force restoration through sheer strength, but must instead coax it, drip by patient drip. [247] She placed the broken fragments in a circle, aligning them according to the mathematics of the falling water. [268] Seven seconds between drops meant thirteen drops per minute, seven hundred eighty per hour, and she needed exactly one thousand four hundred sixty drops to complete the resonance chamber before noon. [299] Her hands moved with the earnest desperation of the naive, fitting bronze to bronze while whispering incantations that fizzled more often than they sparked. [325] Yet she persisted, her brittle devotion refusing to snap despite the weight of impossibility pressing down upon her shoulders. [346] As the nine hundredth drop fell, Elara realized that righting the cosmic imbalance did not require boiling the seas back into existence, but rather reawakening the memory of sound. [377] The bell had called sailors home; perhaps it could call the water itself. [392] She calculated the final adjustments, her dripping rate measurements revealing that the viaduct's seepage increased by one drop every hour as the sun warmed the stone. [419] This predictable impossibility, that water still existed here however thinly, gave her the variables needed to complete her reconstruction. [443] At exactly one thousand four hundred sixty drops, Elara struck the rebuilt bell with a mallet carved from dried coral. [466] The sound that emerged was not loud, but it was true, ringing out across the empty basin with a tone that suggested the ocean remembered its name. [492] The lukewarm magic she had woven into the bronze, timed to the dripping rates and bound by her fragile, earnest will, created a resonance that traveled downward through the bedrock. [523] The cosmic imbalance shuddered. [527] Somewhere in the deep dark beneath the salt flats, something vast turned in its sleep. [543] Elara clutched the viaduct's railing, her naive hope battling her certain knowledge that miracles did not happen for mediocre mages. [566] Then, beneath the bell's fading note, came the sound of water returning, not as a flood, but as a seep, rising through cracks in the earth with the same patience she had shown in her measurements. [605] She had not restored the ocean, not yet, but she had rebuilt the possibility of it. [622] Her brittle devotion held, sustained by the plausible impossibility that a lukewarm mage with a broken bell and a stopwatch could summon the tides. [648] As the water began to pool beneath the sapphire viaduct, Elara began counting the dripping rates again, knowing that reconstruction was not a single moment but an endless, earnest vigil. [687] She would be there tomorrow at dawn, and the dawn after, keeping the rhythm until the last fish was no longer the end of the story. [719]
