The reincarnated goldfish caretaker sighed as he flicked a finger against the glass of his latest charge, a bloated orange fish named Reginald who had the audacity to float upside-down just to mock him. <words>32</words>  

He’d been many things in his past lives—a baker, a thief, even a minor god of misplaced socks—but this? This was punishment. The guilt’s haunting echo of his last life, where he’d accidentally boiled a sacred koi, had landed him here, doomed to tend to the world’s most ungrateful fish. <words>86</words>  

The forgotten recipe library around him smelled of mildew and crushed dreams, its shelves sagging under the weight of culinary failures. He’d come here to disrupt a stagnant tradition—fish funerals were too expensive, and he was determined to find a cheaper way to dispose of Reginald when the time came. <words>138</words>  

A sudden change of weather rattled the windows, and rain lashed against the glass like a disapproving grandmother. The door burst open, and in stumbled a woman clutching a toy soldier with a missing arm, her hair plastered to her face. “You!” she gasped, pointing at him. “You’re the one who’s supposed to alleviate this!” <words>203</words>  

The caretaker blinked. “Alleviate what? My existential dread?” His tone was playful cynicism, but his grip tightened on Reginald’s bowl. <words>225</words>  

“No,” she said, thrusting the toy soldier at him. “This. It’s been following me. I think it’s cursed.” The soldier’s single arm twitched, its painted eyes glaring. <words>255</words>  

The caretaker sighed. “Look, lady, I’m tentatively fierce at best. I can’t even get this fish to swim right-side-up.” Reginald blew a bubble in agreement. <words>281</words>  

But then he noticed the soldier’s missing arm—the break was clean, deliberate. A memory flickered: a child’s hands, a snapped toy, a promise broken. His guilt’s haunting echo grew louder. “Fine,” he muttered. “But only because I owe the universe.” <words>324</words>  

He set Reginald’s bowl aside and took the soldier. The moment his fingers touched it, the library’s lights flickered. Recipes fluttered off shelves, their ingredients rearranging into something new. The woman gasped. “What did you do?” <words>366</words>  

“I disrupted something,” he said, grinning. “Stagnant traditions hate that.” The soldier’s arm reappeared, and the air smelled like forgiveness. <words>389</words>  

Outside, the rain stopped. The woman stared at him, then at the soldier, now whole. “You’re not just a goldfish caretaker, are you?” <words>412</words>  

He shrugged. “I’m whatever the universe needs me to be. Today, it needed a fixer.” Reginald, finally right-side-up, swam in lazy circles as if applauding. <words>438</words>  

Before the doctor’s chart could confirm a turning point—before anyone could ask too many questions—the caretaker slipped the soldier into his pocket and handed Reginald to the woman. “Here. Fish-sitting is your problem now.” And with that, he walked out, the library’s door swinging shut behind him. <words>497</words>  

The woman looked down at Reginald, who promptly flipped upside-down again. She sighed. “Tentatively fierce, my ass.” <words>517</words>
