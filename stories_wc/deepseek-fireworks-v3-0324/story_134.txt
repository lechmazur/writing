The understudy sorcerer, obnoxiously polite even in failure, bowed to the empty salt crystal growing chamber as if apologizing for his presence. <words>28</words> Amid laundry cycles—his robes perpetually stiff with residual enchantments—he’d stolen a small cardboard box from the head sorcerer’s desk, hoping it held secrets to waking the unheard. <words>58</words> The chamber hummed with geometric energy, its walls glinting like frozen tears, while outside, the ancient oak grove whispered truths too old for human tongues. <words>88</words>  

He’d come to hinder the head sorcerer’s plans, not out of malice, but to track cultural evolution—how magic twisted through generations like a river carving stone. <words>118</words> The box rattled; inside, a single tooth pulsed with a playful dread, as if laughing at his ambition. <words>138</words> “Pardon me,” he muttered to it, “but might you know the grove’s language?” <words>154</words>  

Eavesdropping on the oaks required patience, their voices slow as roots deepening. <words>168</words> Salt crystals pricked his fingertips as he pressed them to the chamber floor, channeling their resonance upward. <words>185</words> The grove’s whispers coiled around him, syllables like rustling leaves: “You are small. You are late.” <words>203</words>  

The understudy winced. “Quite right! My apologies for the interruption.” <words>216</words> Yet he persisted, tracing the whispers to their source—a buried sigil, its meaning eroded by time. <words>234</words> The box’s tooth grew hotter; it was a key, not a relic. <words>246</words>  

Suddenly, the head sorcerer’s laughter echoed through the chamber. “Admirable effort,” she said, stepping from a shimmering fold in the air, “but you’ve misread the ritual.” <words>278</words> The understudy’s cheeks burned. “Terribly sorry! I only wished to—” <words>291</words>  

“To hinder me?” She smirked. “Or to hear what even I cannot?” <words>306</words> The oaks roared now, their voices cracking the salt walls. <words>318</words> The understudy clutched the box, its tooth splitting open like a seedpod, releasing a sound—not a voice, but the absence of one, a silence so vast it woke the unheard. <words>350</words>  

The chamber shattered into prismatic shards. <words>356</words> The understudy fell to his knees, ears ringing with the weight of centuries. <words>370</words> The head sorcerer’s smirk faded. “Oh,” she said. “You *listened.*” <words>383</words>  

Around them, the grove’s whispers solidified into figures—spirits of forgotten spells, their eyes bright with judgment. <words>403</words> The understudy, still obnoxiously polite, bowed again. “My sincerest regrets for the disturbance.” <words>420</words>  

But the spirits only laughed, their voices weaving into the wind, and the understudy realized: he hadn’t hindered anything. <words>442</words> He’d accelerated it. <words>445</words> The cultural evolution he’d sought to track was now racing ahead, and he, small and late, would have to chase it. <words>468</words>  

The head sorcerer tossed him a fresh robe. “Do try to keep up.” <words>482</words> The understudy nodded, clutching the now-empty box, its purpose fulfilled—and the grove’s whispers, at last, fell silent. <words>500</words>
