The introverted empath, known only as Lys, cradled the dried starfish in their palm, its brittle spines whispering secrets of deeper tides as the asteroid’s artificial gravity hummed drowsily around them. <words>34</words> They stood in the heart of the space pirate hideout, a cavernous chamber carved into the rock, where stolen holotapes and broken machinery littered the floor like offerings to forgotten gods. <words>70</words> The journal in their other hand—its pages yellowed, its spine cracked—had one entry left, its closing words smudged by time: *"Wisdom is a mountain, but its peak is obviously hidden."* <words>110</words> Lys exhaled, their empathy stretching thin as they sensed the pirates’ restless energy, a chorus of outcasts who’d traded reason for survival. <words>138</words>  

Their mission was clear: to marshal these fractured souls, to champion the outcasts of reason before the warlords beyond the asteroid’s belt came to claim them. <words>168</words> But how? The answer lay in the shattered marionette strewn across the table before them, its wooden limbs splintered, its strings coiled like dead serpents. <words>196</words> Lys had spent nights reassembling it, not to restore its original form, but to forge something new—a symbol of unity from broken things. <words>225</words> The starfish, the journal, the marionette—each a fragment of a language only the lost could understand. <words>245</words>  

A pirate named Ryn, her cybernetic eye flickering, leaned in. "You’re either a fool or the first sane person I’ve met," she muttered, her voice thick with drowsy enthusiasm. <words>277</words> Lys smiled, pressing the starfish into her calloused hand. "The mountain’s peak is hidden because we’re meant to climb together," they said. <words>305</words> Ryn scoffed, but her fingers closed around the starfish, its roughness a mirror of her own edges. <words>327</words>  

One by one, the pirates gathered, drawn by the marionette’s reassembled form—a creature with too many arms, too many legs, yet undeniably alive. <words>354</words> Lys felt their resolve solidify; this was the wisdom of the mountain, the truth hidden in plain sight: brokenness could be a kind of strength. <words>382</words> The hideout, once a den of chaos, thrummed with something new—not quite hope, but the possibility of it. <words>407</words>  

As the warlords’ ships appeared on the scanners, Lys raised the marionette high, its strings glinting under the dim lights. <words>430</words> "We are the outcasts," they declared, "and that is our power." <words>443</words> The pirates roared, their voices a tidal wave against the silence of the void. <words>460</words> And in that moment, the asteroid itself seemed to breathe, its rocky heart beating in time with theirs. <words>481</words> The journal’s final page fluttered shut, its wisdom no longer forgotten, but alive. <words>500</words>  

Lys closed their eyes, the starfish’s whisper merging with the hum of the hideout, and for the first time, they felt less alone. <words>525</words>
