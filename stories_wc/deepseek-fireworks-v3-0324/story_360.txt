The meek necromancer, Elrin, crouched in the dim glow of the underground city of the goblins, his peculiarly sincere eyes fixed on the broken nib of his fountain pen. <words>27</words> Amid the distant echoes of playground sounds—giggles and the clatter of tiny feet—he traced the cracks in the nib, as if they held the answer to the universal riddle he sought to decode. <words>56</words> The tangled tapestry of his thoughts mirrored the labyrinthine streets around him, where goblin children darted like shadows, their laughter bouncing off the damp stone walls. <words>86</words>  

Elrin had come here to regain what he’d lost—not a thing, but a truth, hidden in the way light reflected off a dew drop. <words>110</words> The goblins had whispered of such miracles, how a single drop could reveal the world’s secrets if seen just right. <words>130</words> His fingers trembled as he dipped the broken pen into a vial of ink, the nib’s fracture splitting the flow into two thin streams, like diverging paths in a mystic simplicity. <words>156</words>  

A goblin child, her eyes wide with curiosity, tugged at his sleeve. <words>166</words> “Why do you write with a broken thing?” she asked, her voice a melody amid the chaos. <words>180</words> Elrin smiled, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>187</words> “Because the break shows me what the whole cannot.” <words>196</words> He pressed the nib to parchment, and the ink bled into shapes—not letters, but symbols, forming a map of the dew drop’s reflection. <words>220</words>  

The child gasped. <words>221</words> “It’s like the tapestry in the elder’s hall!” <words>228</words> Elrin’s heart raced. <words>230</words> The tangled tapestry there was said to hold the riddle’s answer, woven in threads of starlight and shadow. <words>249</words> Together, they hurried through the winding streets, the playground sounds fading behind them. <words>265</words>  

In the elder’s hall, the tapestry shimmered, its threads shifting like liquid. <words>280</words> Elrin held up his parchment, and the symbols aligned with the weave—a key to the pattern. <words>297</words> The goblins gathered, their peculiarly sincere faces alight with wonder. <words>310</words> As the last symbol clicked into place, the tapestry unraveled, revealing not an answer, but a question: “What is lost is found in the breaking.” <words>338</words>  

Elrin looked at his broken pen, then at the child. <words>347</words> “Sometimes,” he said, “to regain, we must first break.” <words>358</words> The goblins nodded, their laughter returning, softer now, as if they too understood the mystic simplicity of the dew drop’s truth. <words>383</words>  

And in that moment, Elrin felt the weight of the riddle lift, not because he had solved it, but because he had learned to see it anew. <words>408</words> The underground city, with its echoes and its light, had given him not answers, but a way to begin again. <words>430</words> He pocketed the pen, its broken nib now a treasure, and stepped into the playful shadows, ready to weave his own tapestry. <words>453</words>
