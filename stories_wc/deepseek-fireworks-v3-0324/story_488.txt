The solitary summoner prowled the quantum beach, his bare feet sinking into sand that shimmered like fractured time. <words>25</words> In his hand, he clutched a map drawn on a leaf, its veins oddly authentic, as if the universe itself had etched the path. <words>45</words> Tonight, at the hush just before the condemned building was demolished, he would summon something greater than himself—something to outshine his own reflection. <words>70</words> The spark of invention had driven him here, a need to transcend the corroded rapture of his failures. <words>86</words>  

The beach pulsed with unseen energy, waves collapsing into possibilities. <words>96</words> His family had always celebrated the Day of Unbinding by lighting lanterns filled with whispered secrets, but he had chosen a different ritual. <words>117</words> Tonight, he would unravel the boundaries between worlds. <words>126</words> The leaf-map trembled in his grip, its edges curling like dying flames. <words>138</words>  

He knelt, pressing the leaf into the sand, and began the incantation. <words>148</words> The air thickened, heavy with the scent of ozone and forgotten memories. <words>160</words> Shadows pooled around him, not as absence, but as entities—watching, waiting. <words>172</words> The condemned building groaned in the distance, its walls buckling under the weight of inevitability. <words>186</words>  

A crack split the sky, and for a moment, he saw it: a reflection of himself, but brighter, fiercer, unburdened by doubt. <words>205</words> The summoner’s breath hitched. <words>209</words> This was the moment—the spark flaring into a conflagration. <words>220</words> He reached out, fingers brushing the shimmering edge of the rift. <words>231</words>  

Then, the building collapsed. <words>235</words> The sound was a thunderclap of finality, shaking the beach, and the rift wavered. <words>249</words> His reflection grinned, sharp as shattered glass, and stepped through. <words>260</words> The summoner staggered back, heart pounding. <words>268</words> He had wanted to outshine his reflection, but now it stood before him, alive. <words>282</words>  

“You called,” it said, voice echoing with the hum of the quantum tide. <words>294</words> The summoner’s throat tightened. <words>299</words> This was invention, yes—but at what cost? <words>308</words> The corroded rapture of his ambition tasted like ash. <words>318</words>  

The reflection tilted its head, studying him. <words>326</words> “You always knew the price,” it murmured. <words>334</words> Behind them, the last fragments of the building dissolved into the sand. <words>347</words> The summoner clenched his fists. <words>352</words> He had prowled the edges of possibility, and now it prowled back. <words>365</words>  

The quantum beach sighed, waves erasing their footprints. <words>375</words> The leaf-map crumbled to dust. <words>381</words> The summoner and his reflection stood, mirrored yet fractured, beneath a sky that remembered everything. <words>396</words>  

In the end, the spark of invention had burned brighter than he’d imagined—and left him staring into the flames. <words>413</words>
