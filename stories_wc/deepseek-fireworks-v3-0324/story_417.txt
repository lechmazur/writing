The unhinged zealot paced the Victorian parlor, its gilded wallpaper peeling under the jungle’s humid breath, while his fingers worried a plain metal bottle cap like a sacred relic. <words>30</words>  

“Theoretically playful,” he muttered, flipping the cap into the air, “but the Lord demands earnest absurdity.” His eyes darted to the mahogany desk where his half-finished treatise on unspoken agreements lay, its ink smudged from his sweating palms. <words>70</words>  

Outside, the jungle whispered back, vines creeping through the cracked bay window as if to uproot the very foundations of his sanity. He’d come here to study, to find strength in vulnerability, but the darkness had other plans. <words>110</words>  

A shadow shifted in the corner—a figure he’d long ignored, bound by those silent pacts he’d scribbled about. “Confess,” it hissed, its voice like rustling leaves. The zealot clutched the bottle cap tighter, its edges biting into his flesh. <words>150</words>  

“I’ve done nothing wrong,” he lied, though the words tasted like ash. The figure stepped forward, its face a blur of jungle rot and Victorian lace. “A whispered confession in a dark room,” it crooned, “or the vines take you too.” <words>190</words>  

The zealot’s laugh was a broken thing. “Playful,” he spat, “theoretical.” But his hands shook as he knelt, the bottle cap rolling to the floor. “I… I uprooted them,” he admitted, the words tumbling out. “The agreements. The trust. All of it.” <words>240</words>  

The figure sighed, its breath thick with mildew. “And yet you cling to this.” It nudged the bottle cap with a skeletal toe. “A token of your hypocrisy.” <words>270</words>  

The zealot lunged for it, but the vines moved faster, snaking around his wrists. “No!” he screamed, the parlor’s chandelier swaying as the jungle pressed in. “I was supposed to find strength here!” <words>310</words>  

“Strength?” The figure chuckled, its voice dissolving into the hum of cicadas. “You mistook vulnerability for weakness, and now the jungle will have its due.” <words>340</words>  

The zealot thrashed, but the vines dragged him toward the window, his treatise fluttering after him like a dying moth. The bottle cap glinted on the floor, forgotten. <words>370</words>  

In the end, the parlor stood silent, its grandeur reclaimed by the wild. The unspoken agreements were spoken at last, and the zealot’s earnest absurdity became just another whisper in the dark. <words>410</words>  

By dawn, even the bottle cap was gone, swallowed by the earth. The jungle, ever playful in its theoretical mercy, had uprooted another fool. <words>440</words>  

And somewhere, in the heart of the vines, a confession lingered—unheard, but finally free. <words>460</words>
