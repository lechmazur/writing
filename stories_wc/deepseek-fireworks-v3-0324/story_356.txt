The wry caretaker leaned against the rusted hull of the space pirate ship’s cargo hold, rolling a piece of chalk between their fingers like a relic from a forgotten age. <words>28</words> Around them, crates of stolen starlight hummed softly, their glow casting long shadows that twisted with the ship’s slow drift. <words>50</words> The caretaker’s expression was warmly aloof, as if they were both here and elsewhere, tethered to the present only by the weight of the chalk. <words>75</words> They sighed, marking the floor with a single line—a tally for days that blurred together, for time that refused to behave. <words>95</words>  

Outside, the void stretched endlessly, and the caretaker often wondered if time was just another thing the universe had stolen from them. <words>118</words> The dial tone of an outdated phone crackled from a nearby console, a sound so achingly familiar it made their chest tighten—until it cut out, leaving silence heavy as a black hole. <words>150</words> That was the moment they decided to hush the endless "what if" siren song, the one that whispered of paths not taken, of lives not lived. <words>175</words>  

They pressed the chalk to the hull again, this time tracing the paths of passing clouds—not of water vapor, but of cosmic dust, swirling in patterns only they seemed to understand. <words>205</words> "Time’s just a story we tell ourselves," they muttered, their voice a gentle harshness, like a lullaby sung through gritted teeth. <words>228</words> With each stroke, the dust responded, shimmering brighter, as if agreeing. <words>243</words>  

Then, the caretaker did something they’d never dared before: they let go. <words>256</words> The chalk clattered to the floor, and the lines on the hull flared white-hot before dissolving into the air. <words>275</words> The caretaker’s form wavered, edges fraying like old parchment. <words>287</words> They smiled, finally free of the weight of "what if," and let the cloud paths carry them away. <words>305</words>  

By the time the pirates returned, the caretaker had vanished, leaving only a faint trace of chalk dust and the echo of a dial tone that no one else remembered hearing. <words>335</words> The ship drifted on, its cargo hold a little emptier, its shadows a little longer. <words>351</words> Time, as always, moved forward—but for the caretaker, it had finally stopped demanding answers. <words>370</words>  

The pirates never spoke of it, though sometimes, when the cosmic dust swirled just right, one of them would pause, feeling a warmth they couldn’t name. <words>400</words> And in those moments, the universe felt less like a thief and more like a keeper of quiet, forgotten things. <words>422</words>  

The chalk, now forgotten on the floor, rolled gently into a corner, where it would wait—for the next hand bold enough to rewrite time. <words>450</words>
