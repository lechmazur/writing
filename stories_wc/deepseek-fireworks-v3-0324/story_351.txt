The dreamy poet stood in the disused railway station, its crumbling arches veiled in ivy, the brass sundial at his feet casting no shadow under the bleached midday sun. <words>34</words> He had come here after solving the last riddle, drawn by the unopened letter in his pocket, its wax seal imprinted with cryptic shapes that seemed to shift under his gaze. <words>70</words> The station, once a hub of hurried departures, now stood as a monument to the unremembered—those who had passed through without leaving a trace. <words>103</words> His motivation was simple: to stand by them, to give voice to their silent stories. <words>119</words>  

The poet knelt, brushing dirt from the sundial’s face, its numerals worn smooth by time. <words>136</words> It was a formally rebellious act, he thought, to measure hours in a place where time had ceased to matter. <words>155</words> The letter’s seal compelled him, its patterns whispering of a delicate undoing—not of the station, but of himself. <words>175</words> He traced the shapes with a trembling finger, feeling the weight of unsolved mysteries pressing against his ribs. <words>193</words>  

Around him, the ivy rustled, as if the station breathed. <words>201</words> The poet unfolded the letter, its paper brittle as dried leaves, and read the single line inscribed: *"To find them, lose yourself."* <words>223</words> The words resonated with a quietly intensity, a paradox that mirrored his own heart. <words>238</words> He had always been a seeker of truths, but now he understood: to honor the unremembered, he must become unremembered too. <words>260</words>  

The sundial’s brass edge caught the light, and for a moment, the poet saw faces in its reflection—ghosts of travelers long gone. <words>283</words> He pressed the letter to his chest, the wax seal crumbling to dust. <words>295</words> The station sighed, the ivy tightening its grip on the walls, as if the building itself mourned his decision. <words>315</words> Yet he smiled, for this was the final riddle, the one he had been meant to solve all along. <words>334</words>  

With a deep breath, the poet stepped onto the tracks, their rusted rails leading into the horizon. <words>351</words> The sundial, the letter, the ivy—all faded behind him, their purpose fulfilled. <words>365</words> He walked until his name slipped from his lips, until his past dissolved like the wax seal in the wind. <words>383</words> And as he vanished into the distance, the station stood silent, its arches heavy with the weight of stories now remembered, if only for a moment. <words>409</words>  

The last riddle was solved, the delicate undoing complete. <words>420</words> The poet had become what he sought: a whisper in the ivy, a shadow on the sundial, a name unspoken but never truly lost. <words>445</words>
