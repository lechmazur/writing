The hesitant bard stood at the mouth of the xenon-lit tunnel, clutching the worn-out dinosaur plush like a talisman against the weight of the year everyone would rather forget. <words>34</words>  

Its frayed seams whispered of childhood comforts long abandoned, yet here it was, a relic in his trembling hands—shyly loud in its silent demand to be remembered. <words>64</words>  

The tunnel hummed with an otherworldly glow, its walls pulsing like veins of some colossal, dreaming beast. Dream-hopping machines lined the path, their glass surfaces flickering with half-formed visions of lives unlived. <words>102</words>  

He had come to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, to trace the threads of time before they frayed beyond repair. The fragility of time was no abstract fear here; it was the air he breathed, thick with the irony of awe. <words>142</words>  

A machine beckoned, its screen flashing a question: *What do you seek?* The bard hesitated, then pressed the plush to its surface. The world dissolved. <words>169</words>  

He tumbled into a dream not his own—a child’s birthday, balloons deflating, laughter dying mid-air. The plush was new here, bright-eyed and stiff-limbed, clutched by small hands that didn’t yet know loss. <words>207</words>  

The bard watched as the child grew, as the plush faded with each passing year, discarded then rediscovered in moments of quiet despair. Time was a thief, but it left clues in its wake. <words>242</words>  

Another machine, another leap. A hospital room, the plush tucked under the arm of a woman who would not wake. The bard’s throat tightened. This was the sorrow he’d come to face—the unspooling of a life he’d never known, yet felt too deeply. <words>293</words>  

He moved again, this time to a dim attic where the plush sat in a box, forgotten. The year outside was the one they all wished to erase, its horrors etched in dust. The bard reached for it, but the dream shifted. <words>335</words>  

Back in the tunnel, the machines whirred in protest. *You cannot change the past,* they seemed to say. But the bard wasn’t here to change it. He was here to *motivate*—to stitch the fragments into something bearable. <words>376</words>  

He stepped to the last machine, the xenon lights flaring as if in warning. The screen showed his own face, weary but resolved. The plush in his hand was threadbare, but it had survived. So could he. <words>417</words>  

At the crossing of the year, the bard emerged from the tunnel, the plush tucked safely in his coat. The air was cold, the future uncertain, but the tapestry of sorrow now had a new thread—one of quiet defiance. <words>460</words>  

He smiled, shyly loud in the silence, and began to sing. <words>469</words>
