The listless noble, draped in a faded scarf that had once been a vibrant heirloom, wandered the endless corn maze stretching across the haunted plain, his naively sophisticated mind adrift in thoughts of purpose. <words>30</words>  
He had received an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event—a rendezvous whispered to him by the wind, though he couldn’t say why he’d obeyed. <words>56</words>  
The maze walls towered above him, their stalks rustling with secrets, and he marveled with ironic awe at the absurdity of his quest: to discover the power of intention before the first creature developed sentience. <words>90</words>  
A laugh echoed through the maze, sharp and sudden, and the noble froze, his scarf fluttering like a ghost’s touch. <words>109</words>  
“Who’s there?” he called, his voice swallowed by the corn. <words>118</words>  
The laughter came again, closer now, and a figure emerged—a woman with eyes like the twilight, her grin as wild as the untamed plain. <words>141</words>  
“You’re late,” she said, and the noble blinked, realizing this was the rendezvous he’d been summoned to. <words>159</words>  
She tossed him a dried husk, and when he caught it, it burst into shared laughter between them, a sound so pure it momentarily dispelled the haunted air. <words>186</words>  
“Why am I here?” the noble asked, his listlessness giving way to curiosity. <words>198</words>  
The woman’s smile faded, and she pointed to the scarf around his neck. <words>210</words>  
“That was mine once,” she said. “It fades because you’ve forgotten how to want anything.” <words>225</words>  
The noble touched the fabric, its threads whispering of lost desires, and he understood: intention was the thread that wove the world. <words>247</words>  
Together, they ventured deeper into the maze, the woman leading him through twists that defied logic, her laughter a compass in the gloom. <words>272</words>  
At the heart of the maze stood a single stalk, its leaves shimmering with a light that predated thought. <words>290</words>  
“This is where it begins,” she said, and the noble felt the weight of his own choices for the first time. <words>310</words>  
He reached out, and as his fingers brushed the stalk, the maze shuddered, the haunted plain holding its breath. <words>330</words>  
The woman’s laughter rang out again, but now it was tinged with sorrow. <words>343</words>  
“You’ll forget,” she warned. “But for this moment, you remember.” <words>356</words>  
The noble’s scarf blazed with color, its threads alive with his rekindled will, and he laughed—not at the irony, but at the joy of wanting something. <words>382</words>  
Then the maze dissolved, and he stood alone on the plain, the scarf faded once more, the woman’s voice a whisper in the wind. <words>405</words>  
But the memory of shared laughter lingered, and for the first time in ages, the listless noble felt the stirrings of intention. <words>428</words>  
He turned his face to the horizon, where the first creature would one day awaken, and smiled. <words>444</words>  
The power had always been his; he’d simply needed the maze to remind him. <words>459</words>  
And with that, he walked on, the haunted plain no longer a prison, but a promise. <words>477</words>
