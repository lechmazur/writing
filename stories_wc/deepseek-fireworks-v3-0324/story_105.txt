The outcast scholar, Elias, crouched in the hush of a half-lit corridor, his fingers trembling as they traced the loose tile in the public restroom wall. <words>30</words> Behind it lay the diaries—yellowed pages filled with frantic peace, the scribbles of a mind torn between doubt and revelation. <words>55</words> He had spent years searching for proof that midnight only lasts so long, that darkness wasn’t eternal, and now the answer was within reach. <words>85</words> The seashell in his pocket pulsed with warmth, its strange symbol glowing faintly, as if mirroring the soul of its bearer. <words>108</words>  

Elias stumbled back, the jolt of recognition hitting him like a lightning strike. <words>120</words> The symbol matched the one in the diaries, a sigil of the old witches who once ruled the skies. <words>138</words> His heart raced as he fled the corridor, the strangely trustworthy shell guiding him to the witch’s flying carpet garage—a relic hidden beneath the city’s modern sprawl. <words>172</words> The air there hummed with forgotten magic, the carpets suspended in midair like sleeping beasts. <words>191</words>  

He climbed onto the nearest carpet, the shell’s glow intensifying. <words>203</words> “Show me,” he whispered, and the carpet lurched forward, carrying him into the night. <words>220</words> The wind whipped his face as he soared above the city, the stars blurring into streaks of light. <words>239</words> Below, the world seemed small, its problems fleeting—proof that even the longest midnight must yield to dawn. <words>261</words>  

But the peace was short-lived. <words>266</words> A shadow detached itself from the darkness, a figure on another carpet, its rider cloaked in malice. <words>287</words> Elias gripped the shell tighter, its warmth now a burning reassurance. <words>300</words> “You don’t belong here,” the figure hissed, and Elias realized it was his own reflection—twisted, envious, the part of him that still doubted. <words>333</words>  

The chase was frantic, the carpets weaving through towers and over bridges. <words>348</words> Elias clutched the diaries to his chest, their pages fluttering like wings. <words>362</words> He couldn’t outrun his shadow forever, but he didn’t have to. <words>376</words> With a deep breath, he turned the carpet sharply, facing his mirror image head-on. <words>394</words> “Midnight only lasts so long,” he shouted, and the shell erupted with light. <words>411</words>  

The shadow dissolved, the false reflection shattering like glass. <words>423</words> Elias landed gently in the garage, the first rays of dawn filtering through the cracks in the roof. <words>443</words> The shell’s symbol faded, its purpose fulfilled. <words>453</words> He smiled, tucking the diaries back behind the tile—someone else might need them someday. <words>473</words> For now, he had proven what he set out to: darkness was never permanent. <words>492</words> The world was waiting, and so was he. <words>502</words>
