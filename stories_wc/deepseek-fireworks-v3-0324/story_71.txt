The scarecrow stood sentinel in the field, its burlap face creased with fervent apathy, watching the lines in the earth shift like veins beneath the soil. <words>28</words> It had sworn an oath to guard the fossilized giant buried there, a relic from a time when the world was younger and the boundaries between realms were thin. <words>56</words> The giant’s ribs arched like cathedral ruins, and the scarecrow’s duty was to skewer any intruder who dared disturb its rest. <words>81</words>  

One evening, a forgotten lace fan tumbled across the field, carried by a wind that smelled of ozone and static. <words>100</words> The scarecrow recognized it—a relic from the parallel world where it had once been human, a dancer who’d sworn to protect the giant before the transformation took hold. <words>130</words> Now, it moved with stiff resolve, plucking the fan from the dirt, its fingers brushing against the delicate patterns of a life it could barely remember. <words>158</words>  

A flicker in the air announced the arrival of the intruder: a figure clad in virtual reality gear, their movements glitching as they phased between worlds. <words>186</words> The scarecrow’s hollow eyes narrowed. This was no accidental traveler; they sought the giant’s power, and the scarecrow’s oath demanded action. <words>214</words> With a lurch, it lunged, its wooden arm sharpening into a stake meant to skewer the interloper. <words>234</words>  

The intruder dodged, their form shimmering as they tapped into the virtual realm, weaving through the scarecrow’s strikes like smoke. <words>257</words> “You’re just a construct,” they sneered, their voice echoing from both worlds at once. <words>273</words> The scarecrow didn’t answer. It had no need for words—only the weight of its oath, the lines in the earth pulsing beneath its feet. <words>299</words>  

The fan trembled in its grip, and suddenly, the scarecrow remembered. <words>312</words> The dance, the oath, the moment it had chosen this duty over humanity. <words>328</words> With a flick of the fan, it severed the intruder’s connection to the virtual world, yanking them fully into the realistically fantastical reality of the field. <words>356</words> The intruder stumbled, their gear sputtering into silence. <words>369</words>  

The scarecrow loomed over them, its stake poised. <words>378</words> “The giant sleeps,” it rasped, its voice the sound of dry leaves. <words>391</words> “And I do not.” <words>395</words> The skewer fell, and the lines in the earth glowed briefly before fading, the balance between worlds restored. <words>417</words> The fan slipped from the scarecrow’s grasp, forgotten once more, as it returned to its vigil, its apathy as fervent as ever. <words>442</words>  

The field was silent again, save for the wind and the slow, steady breath of the fossilized giant beneath. <words>465</words>
