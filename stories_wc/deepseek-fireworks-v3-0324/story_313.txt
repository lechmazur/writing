The small-time con artist, known only as Finch, trudged across the dystopian farm, his boots kicking up dust that clung to the air like a ghost. <words>34</words>  

He clutched the empty tape dispenser in his pocket, its hollow rattle a mocking reminder of his latest failed scheme. <words>53</words>  

The farm was unusually normal—rows of withered crops, a rusted tractor, a sky the color of faded denim—but Finch felt the lull of remorse creeping in, slow and suffocating. <words>87</words>  

He’d come here to comfort himself, though he wasn’t sure how. <words>98</words>  

Then he saw them: ghostly apparitions flickering between the dead cornstalks, their whispers threading through the wind. <words>117</words>  

Finch grinned, his mild fervor igniting. <words>123</words>  

He’d always loved to taunt the jaws of defeat, and now he’d do it by interrogating these specters. <words>141</words>  

“What do you want?” he demanded, stepping closer. <words>149</words>  

The ghosts shimmered, their forms coalescing into shapes of farmers long gone, their eyes hollow with regret. <words>167</words>  

“You stole from us,” one murmured, its voice like dry leaves. <words>178</words>  

Finch scoffed, rattling the tape dispenser. <words>184</words>  

“Empty,” he said. “Just like your threats.” <words>191</words>  

But the ghosts pressed in, their cold fingers brushing his arms, their whispers digging into his skull. <words>207</words>  

“You could have been more,” they said. <words>214</words>  

Finch’s grin faltered. <words>216</words>  

The lull of remorse deepened, a tide pulling him under. <words>225</words>  

He’d spent his life chasing easy wins, but here, in this dystopian wasteland, the ghosts made him see the truth: he was just a man with an empty tape dispenser and emptier promises. <words>256</words>  

For the first time, Finch didn’t fight the feeling. <words>265</words>  

He sat in the dirt, letting the ghosts circle him, their presence oddly comforting. <words>278</words>  

“What now?” he asked, his voice small. <words>285</words>  

The ghosts didn’t answer. <words>288</words>  

They didn’t need to. <words>291</words>  

Finch knew. <words>293</words>  

He stood, dusted himself off, and tossed the tape dispenser into the field. <words>305</words>  

It landed with a thud, final and insignificant. <words>313</words>  

The ghosts faded, their work done. <words>319</words>  

Finch walked away, his steps lighter, the farm’s unnatural normalcy no longer a prison but a beginning. <words>338</words>  

He’d taunted defeat long enough. <words>344</words>  

Now, he’d face it. <words>347</words>  

The end came not with a bang, but with a sigh—a man finally hearing the whispers he’d spent a lifetime ignoring. <words>368</words>  

And in that moment, Finch found something rare: a chance to be more than what he’d been. <words>385</words>  

The dystopian farm stretched behind him, its ghosts silent, its soil waiting. <words>397</words>  

Finch took a breath, and for the first time, it felt like enough. <words>409</words>
