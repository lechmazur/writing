The accidental mayor, a lovably grumpy man named Elias, trudged through the polluted swamp orchard, his boots sinking into the muck as the carnival packed up under the first rays of dawn. <words>38</words> He clutched the clockwork beetle in his pocket, its gears whirring faintly, a relic from his late father—a man who’d believed in water wisdom, the idea that rivers and tides held secrets if one listened closely. <words>78</words> Elias had never believed it, but now, with the town’s fate hanging by a thread, he had no choice. <words>99</words>  

The reclusive monks who tended the orchard watched him from the shadows, their robes stained with the swamp’s filth, their eyes sharp as knives. <words>128</words> Elias had overheard their conversation in the crowded cafe yesterday, whispers of a way to metamorphose the land, to cleanse it and change the course of fate. <words>156</words> It sounded like madness, but the beetle had stirred in his pocket then, as if agreeing. <words>175</words>  

“You’re here for the water,” one monk said, stepping forward. His voice was like gravel, but there was a reluctant awe in his tone, as if he’d expected Elias but dreaded it all the same. <words>215</words> Elias nodded, pulling out the beetle. “This was my father’s. He said it could find the heart of the swamp.” <words>237</words> The monk’s eyes widened. “Then you know the price.” <words>248</words>  

Elias didn’t, but he wasn’t about to admit it. <words>256</words> The monks led him to a stagnant pool, its surface slick with oil. <words>269</words> “The beetle must drink,” they said. “And so must you.” <words>281</words> Elias grimaced, but he placed the beetle on the water’s edge. <words>293</words> To his shock, it skittered forward, its gears spinning faster, and the water began to ripple, then swirl, then clear. <words>317</words>  

A voice echoed in his mind—his father’s. “Water wisdom isn’t about listening. It’s about becoming.” <words>338</words> Elias felt a pull, a demand. <words>345</words> He knelt and drank, the taste of rot giving way to something sweet, something alive. <words>361</words> The swamp shuddered. <words>364</words> Vines burst from the ground, flowers bloomed in the filth, and the monks gasped as the orchard began to metamorphose around them. <words>389</words>  

Elias stood, his skin tingling, his heart pounding. <words>399</words> The beetle clicked its wings and took flight, a shimmering guide leading him forward. <words>415</words> He didn’t know what he’d done, but the town’s fate was no longer written in poison. <words>433</words> For the first time, he believed—in the water, in the wisdom, in the reluctant awe of a grumpy man who’d stumbled into something greater. <words>460</words>  

As the sun rose, the swamp orchard breathed anew, and Elias smiled. <words>473</words> Maybe being mayor wasn’t so accidental after all. <words>483</words>
