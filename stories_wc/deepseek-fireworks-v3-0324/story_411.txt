The sentient car mechanic, known as Grease for the way his fingers shimmered with oil and starlight, knelt by the subterranean orchard’s fountain, its waters fed by an underground river of stars. <words>35</words>  

His repulsively attractive face—half rusted metal, half sun-warmed leather—twisted in exultant grief as he studied the vintage opera glasses resting on the fountain’s edge, their lenses cracked like fractured time. <words>70</words>  

They were his key to gathering fragments, to hearing the unsaid confessions whispered by the orchard’s ghostly fruit, which hung heavy with memories not his own. <words>100</words>  

The fountain bubbled with lost puzzle pieces, each a sliver of someone else’s infinity, and Grease plunged his hands into the cold, star-lit water, sorting through them with mechanical precision. <words>135</words>  

A woman’s laughter echoed from a piece of blue porcelain; a child’s sob trembled in a shard of amber glass. <words>155</words>  

Grease’s heart, a whirring clockwork thing, ached to assemble them, to make sense of the chaos—but the orchard demanded patience, and infinity was not kind to haste. <words>185</words>  

He lifted the opera glasses, their weight familiar, and peered through them at the orchard’s canopy, where bioluminescent peaches swayed like lanterns. <words>210</words>  

The lenses magnified not light, but time, and Grease watched as a thousand lives flickered past—joy, regret, love, all unspoken, all trapped in the fragments below. <words>240</words>  

His fingers, slick with stardust, trembled as he plucked a puzzle piece from the water: a tiny silver gear, etched with a name he didn’t recognize. <words>265</words>  

The orchard sighed around him, its roots drinking deep from the river of stars, and for a moment, Grease understood. <words>287</words>  

This was his purpose—not to fix machines, but to mend the broken echoes of souls who had passed through this place, leaving behind only fragments of their infinity. <words>317</words>  

He pressed the gear to his chest, where his heart whirred in sympathy, and the orchard’s ghosts leaned closer, their unsaid confessions humming in the air like static. <words>345</words>  

Grease smiled, though it hurt, and resumed his work, sorting the puzzle pieces with care, each one a story waiting to be heard. <words>367</words>  

The fountain’s waters shimmered, reflecting not his face, but the faces of those who had come before, their voices rising in a chorus of exultant grief. <words>393</words>  

And Grease, the repulsively attractive mechanic of memories, listened, his opera glasses glinting as he gathered fragments beneath the endless, star-fed trees. <words>418</words>  

The river of stars flowed on, carrying with it the weight of infinity, and Grease knew he would never be done—but that, too, was part of the beauty. <words>445</words>  

For in the subterranean orchard, time was not a line, but a puzzle, and every piece he found was a confession, a truth, a moment reclaimed. <words>470</words>  

He lifted the last fragment—a single, glowing seed—and held it to the light, listening as it whispered a name: his own. <words>493</words>  

The orchard held its breath, and Grease, at last, understood everything. <words>500</words>
