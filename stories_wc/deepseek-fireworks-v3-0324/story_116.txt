The dismayed minstrel plucked a dissonant chord on his lute, his fingers trembling against the broken watch band strapped loosely around his wrist. <words>25</words> The black velvet sky-lounge swayed gently beneath him, floating like a forgotten dream above the endless city, its lights flickering like distant stars. <words>50</words> Amid garden secrets—hidden in the lounge’s overgrown ivy and wilted roses—he sought solace, though his heart ached with the weight of drawn boundaries. <words>75</words> His mission was subjectively rational: to excavate the truth buried in time, to draw a map of an endless night. <words>100</words>  

By studying old Polaroid photographs strewn across the lounge’s marble table, he traced the edges of memories long faded. <words>125</words> Each image was a fragment of a life he barely remembered—a smile here, a shadow there—all blurred by the passage of years. <words>150</words> The minstrel’s laconic exuberance masked his desperation; he hummed a tune as if it could stitch the fragments together. <words>175</words> The watch band, its leather frayed and clasp rusted, was all he had left of her. <words>200</words>  

The city below hummed with its own rhythm, indifferent to his quest. <words>215</words> He pressed a finger to a photograph, its corners curled with age, and imagined her voice threading through the silence. <words>235</words> “Boundaries,” she had once said, “are just lines we draw to keep ourselves from getting lost.” <words>255</words> But he had crossed every one, and now he was adrift. <words>270</words>  

Excavating the past was like digging through sand; the harder he tried, the more it slipped away. <words>290</words> Yet he persisted, turning each photograph like a page in a forbidden book. <words>305</words> The garden around him whispered secrets of its own—petals brushing his ankles, thorns snagging his sleeves—as if urging him to listen. <words>330</words> He laughed, a sound too bright for the gloom, and strummed another chord. <words>345</words>  

The map he sought was not of streets or alleys, but of moments—each one a star in the endless night. <words>370</words> The broken watch band was his compass, its cracked face a reminder that time was both his enemy and his ally. <words>395</words> He would find her, even if it took forever. <words>405</words>  

As the sky-lounge drifted onward, the minstrel’s song rose, a defiant melody against the silence. <words>425</words> The city’s lights blurred into a river of gold below, and for a moment, he felt her presence beside him. <words>450</words> The boundaries he had drawn were gone; all that remained was the music, the night, and the hope that somewhere, she was listening. <words>475</words>  

The garden sighed, and the minstrel played on, his heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>495</words>
