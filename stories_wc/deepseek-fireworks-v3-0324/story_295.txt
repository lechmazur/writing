The jovial sellsword, Garrick, strode into the witch’s herb garden, his boots crushing fragrant thyme underfoot as he adjusted the astronomical telescope slung across his back. <words>25</words> He was boldly reluctant to be here, but the treasure he sought—a family tradition of making a time capsule—had lured him into this elegant mayhem. <words>50</words> The garden hummed with unnatural life, vines twisting like serpents, their blooms glowing faintly under the moon’s gaze. <words>70</words> Garrick’s grin faltered as he recalled the withering vow he’d made to his dying father: to dethrone doubt from his mind and reclaim what was lost. <words>95</words>  

The witch, her hair a nest of silver thistles, emerged from the shadows, her voice a rasp of dried leaves. "You seek the capsule," she said, not a question. <words>120</words> Garrick nodded, his hand resting on the telescope’s brass tube—a relic of his father’s obsession with the stars. <words>140</words> "It’s buried where the constellations align," she murmured, pointing to a patch of earth where the herbs grew in spirals. <words>160</words>  

As Garrick dug, the garden seemed to breathe around him, petals wilting and regrowing in rapid cycles throughout the transformation. <words>185</words> His fingers struck metal, and he unearthed a small, ornate box—the time capsule. <words>200</words> Inside lay a star chart, a lock of hair, and a note in his father’s hand: "Doubt is the thief of dreams." <words>225</words> Garrick’s laughter bubbled up, sharp and bright, as the witch’s garden shuddered, the plants writhing as if in protest. <words>250</words>  

The witch’s eyes gleamed. "The treasure you sought was never gold," she said. <words>270</words> Garrick’s mirth faded as he understood—the real treasure was the vow itself, the promise to defy doubt. <words>290</words> He raised the telescope to his eye, aiming it at the sky, and saw not stars but memories: his father’s face, his own younger self, full of hope. <words>320</words>  

The garden’s chaos intensified, vines snaking toward him, but Garrick stood firm, his reluctance burned away by purpose. <words>345</words> "I’ll keep the vow," he declared, and the witch’s laughter echoed like wind chimes. <words>365</words> The telescope’s lens cracked, releasing a burst of light that seared through the garden, freezing the transformation mid-wither. <words>390</words>  

When the light faded, Garrick stood alone, the garden silent and still. <words>405</words> The time capsule was gone, but the weight of his promise remained, etched into his bones. <words>425</words> He adjusted the broken telescope on his back and strode into the night, his doubt as withered as the vows he’d reclaimed. <words>450</words> The stars above seemed to pulse in approval, their light a guide for the sellsword who had finally found his treasure. <words>475</words>
