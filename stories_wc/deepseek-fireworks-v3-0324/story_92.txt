The dog walker for the ultra-rich adjusted her scarf, its silk whispering against her throat as she stepped into the haunted mansion’s dining room, where the botanical collection loomed like specters in glass cases. <words>35</words> The air hummed with a loud silence, the kind that pressed against her eardrums as if the walls themselves were holding their breath. <words>60</words> She had been here before, under silent agreements with the owner—a man who paid her triple to walk his wolfhounds at the hour when color bled from day into night. <words>90</words>  

Her boots clicked against the marble, carefully careless, as if she hadn’t noticed the way the shadows clung to the corners or the faint scent of roses rotting in their vases. <words>120</words> She wasn’t supposed to be here, not really, but she needed to justify her presence, to stand where fear dared not tread. <words>145</words> The blood drive flyer crumpled in her pocket had been her excuse—a chance encounter, she’d say, if anyone asked. <words>167</words>  

The dining table stretched like a runway, its polished surface reflecting the dying light, and she traced a finger along its edge, feeling the weight of unseen eyes. <words>195</words> The wolfhounds whined softly, their tails tucked, as if they too sensed the mansion’s hunger. <words>214</words> She knelt, pretending to adjust a collar, but her gaze flicked to the botanical collection—a dozen rare orchids, their petals black as midnight, their stems threaded with veins of crimson. <words>248</words>  

A door creaked open, and the owner’s voice slithered into the room. “You’re early.” <words>263</words> She straightened, her smile sharp. “The blood drive was quicker than I thought.” <words>280</words> His laugh was a dry thing, like leaves skittering across stone. “Or you wanted to see the flowers.” <words>302</words>  

The silence between them thickened, a silent agreement of their own. <words>317</words> She could lie, but the orchids pulsed faintly, as if breathing, and she knew he’d see through her. <words>338</words> “They’re beautiful,” she admitted, her voice steady. “But they don’t belong here.” <words>356</words>  

His smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Nothing here does.” <words>368</words> The wolfhounds pressed against her legs, their warmth a stark contrast to the room’s chill. <words>387</words> She exhaled, the sound lost in the loud silence, and took a step forward—not toward the door, but toward the glass case. <words>412</words>  

“Then neither do I,” she said, and reached for the lock. <words>425</words> The orchids shuddered, their petals unfurling like fists, and the mansion’s hunger finally stirred. <words>445</words> The owner’s grin widened, teeth gleaming in the twilight. “Now we understand each other.” <words>463</words>  

She didn’t flinch. Fear had no place here—not anymore. <words>477</words>
