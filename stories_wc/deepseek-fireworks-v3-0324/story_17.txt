The guilt-ridden black market genealogist walked amid morning walks, his hands cradling a chipped bowl like an atypically typical relic of a life half-lived. <words>28</words> The bowl, stolen from a witch’s incantation chamber years ago, hummed faintly, as if still echoing with spells. <words>50</words> He’d taken it to zoom in on the hidden lineages of the dead, analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies for clues to their buried sins. <words>76</words> But now, standing on the brink of renewal, he sought something far harder to uncover: a path to self-forgiveness. <words>98</words>  

The chamber’s remnants clung to the bowl—charred herbs, whispers of old curses—but its true power lay in what it revealed about the living. <words>126</words> Every crack in its glaze mirrored the fractures in his own history, the names he’d sold for profit, the families he’d unraveled. <words>148</words> With brazen modesty, he admitted aloud, “I’ve dug graves with my words,” and the bowl trembled as if agreeing. <words>169</words>  

He’d come to the witch’s abandoned tower at dawn, where the light slanted through broken windows like spectral fingers. <words>191</words> Here, amid dust and dried petals, he poured water into the bowl and watched as the surface rippled with faces—not the dead he’d exploited, but his own reflection, warped by regret. <words>223</words> The witch’s last spell, he realized, wasn’t for divination but for confrontation. <words>239</words>  

A voice, thin as parchment, slithered from the shadows: “You’ve always known the price.” <words>256</words> He spun, but the chamber was empty. <words>263</words> The bowl’s water darkened, showing him a memory—a client weeping over a eulogy he’d doctored, a lie that had severed a bloodline forever. <words>290</words> His throat tightened. <words>293</words> This was the heart of it: not the act, but the weight carried after. <words>309</words>  

He raised the bowl, its chips biting into his palms, and hurled it against the wall. <words>328</words> Instead of shattering, it bounced back into his hands, unbroken. <words>342</words> The witch’s laughter echoed. <words>346</words> “Renewal isn’t in destruction,” she seemed to whisper. <words>358</words> “It’s in bearing what you’ve done.” <words>367</words>  

The genealogist sank to his knees, the bowl cradled like a child. <words>381</words> For the first time, he let the guilt flood him, no longer fighting its current. <words>398</words> The chamber’s air shifted, the scent of burning herbs replaced by something softer—rain on dry earth. <words>420</words> Outside, the sun climbed higher, and he understood: forgiveness wasn’t a destination, but the walk itself. <words>443</words>  

He left the bowl on the witch’s altar, its chips gleaming like stars. <words>459</words> The path ahead was unclear, but his steps were lighter. <words>471</words> Somewhere, a eulogy was being spoken, and for once, he didn’t need to analyze it to know his own story was still being written. <words>500</words> The brink of renewal, he thought, was just another name for dawn. <words>516</words>
