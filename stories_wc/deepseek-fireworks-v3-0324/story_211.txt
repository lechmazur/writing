In the hush of the unremembered future, the abandoned schoolhouse stood like a skeletal hand reaching from the ghost town’s grave, its windows shattered into jagged grins. <words>38</words>  

Inside, a lucky gambler named Elias flipped through a botanical diary, its pages brittle with age, each sketch of withered flowers a testament to a world that had forgotten how to bloom. <words>76</words>  

He had come here to defy the gravity of hopelessness, though his cheerfulness was a thin veneer over the despair gnawing at his ribs. <words>107</words>  

The diary wasn’t his—it belonged to the town’s last teacher, a woman who had documented the corruption of power in the margins, her ink bleeding like the roots of a poisoned tree. <words>143</words>  

Elias typically never cared for history, but tonight, the diary was his ticket to a game far riskier than cards. <words>164</words>  

Across the room, a rusted spin-the-bottle sat on the floor, its glass clouded with dust. <words>180</words>  

“Confessions,” he muttered, grinning as he gave it a spin. <words>188</words>  

The bottle whirled, its neck pointing at the empty air where the others had once sat—children who had vanished when the town’s mayor, drunk on authority, had sealed them in the schoolhouse during a fire. <words>231</words>  

Elias laughed, the sound echoing like a broken bell. <words>240</words>  

“I confess,” he said to the ghosts, “I’ve come to duplicate what was lost.” <words>253</words>  

The diary trembled in his hands, its pages rustling as if stirred by unseen breath. <words>268</words>  

Outside, the wind howled through the hollow bones of the town, a chorus of cheerful despair. <words>284</words>  

Elias spun the bottle again, and this time, it landed on his own shadow. <words>296</words>  

“I confess,” he whispered, “I’m not as lucky as they say.” <words>308</words>  

The diary’s spine cracked open to a page he hadn’t seen before—a sketch of the schoolhouse, its doors wide, its halls filled with children who weren’t running from the flames but toward them, their faces alight with something like joy. <words>358</words>  

Elias’s throat tightened. <words>361</words>  

The corruption of power wasn’t just in the mayor’s cruelty—it was in the way hope could twist into madness, in the way a gambler could mistake desperation for a winning hand. <words>396</words>  

He spun the bottle one last time, and when it stopped, the diary’s pages began to duplicate, the sketches multiplying until the schoolhouse was no longer abandoned, until the ghosts were no longer silent. <words>437</words>  

Elias stood, his cheerfulness fraying at the edges, and stepped into the crowd of laughing children, their hands pulling him toward the flames. <words>462</words>  

In the hush of the unremembered future, the schoolhouse burned again, and this time, no one was left to mourn. <words>482</words>  

The botanical diary lay open in the ashes, its final entry a single word: “Lucky.” <words>496</words>
