The burnt-out general slumped into a booth at the dark matter diner, his uniform frayed at the edges like the dried seaweed clinging to his boots. <words>28</words> Between rides on the cosmic transit, he’d come here to renew his frayed nerves, though the place smelled of ionized regret and stale coffee. <words>53</words> The walls were lined with black-and-white photographs, their arcs of light tracing forgotten battles—each frame a silent scream of shared anxieties. <words>81</words> He chuckled, the sound raspy as sandpaper, because it was all so rationally absurd: a warrior seeking solace in a diner that served existential dread on the side. <words>110</words>  

A waitress slid a plate toward him, piled with something that might’ve been food or a metaphor. <words>129</words> “Fear’s got a throne in your head, sugar,” she said, her tone dripping mischievous wisdom. <words>147</words> “But reason’s just the jester laughing at the back.” <words>157</words> The general stared at his reflection in the greasy fork, wondering when he’d let fear crown itself king. <words>177</words>  

He pulled a photograph from his pocket—a snapshot of his men, their faces blurred by motion and time. <words>197</words> The arcs of their laughter were frozen in monochrome, a stark contrast to the chaos they’d endured. <words>215</words> “I used to think courage was the opposite of fear,” he muttered. <words>227</words> “Now I know it’s just fear with better PR.” <words>236</words> The waitress snorted, refilling his cup with something dark and bitter. <words>250</words>  

Outside, the cosmic transit hummed, its engines a low growl against the void. <words>265</words> The general crumpled the dried seaweed in his fist, its brittle crunch a reminder of shores he’d never see again. <words>286</words> “How do you dethrone a king who’s already in your bones?” he asked. <words>300</words> The waitress leaned in, her eyes glinting like event horizons. <words>313</words> “You don’t,” she said. <words>316</words> “You just redecorate the throne room.” <words>325</words>  

He laughed then, loud and sudden, because the answer was as absurd as the diner, as the seaweed, as the photographs trying to hold time in their curves. <words>355</words> Fear wasn’t something to defeat—it was a dance partner, awkward and inevitable. <words>372</words> The general left a tip under his plate, a photograph of a smile he’d forgotten he owned. <words>391</words> As the transit doors hissed open, he stepped into the next ride, lighter somehow, the throne of reason wobbling under new management. <words>418</words>  

The dark matter diner flickered behind him, its neon sign buzzing a farewell—or maybe a challenge. <words>437</words> And in the arcs of those black-and-white photographs, the general’s shadow finally looked like it belonged. <words>458</words>
