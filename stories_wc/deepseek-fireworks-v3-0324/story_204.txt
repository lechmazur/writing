The phantom train ticket punch felt unusually usual in Mara’s pocket, its weight a silent reminder of the unspoken rules she’d broken. <words>27</words> She adjusted her sleeves, the fabric frayed from years of professional cuddling, and stepped into the abandoned spaceport hangar, its cavernous silence punctuated by the distant hum of a farmer’s market beyond the rusted gates. <words>58</words> The air smelled of decay—old metal, spilled fuel, and something sweetly organic, like overripe fruit left too long in the sun. <words>82</words>  

Mara had come here during the hush before an acceptance speech began, the kind of moment when the world held its breath. <words>107</words> She wasn’t supposed to be here; the spaceport was off-limits, its derelict halls haunted by the ghosts of interstellar travel. <words>128</words> But the ticket punch had called to her, its edges sharp with ancient novelty, a relic from a time when trains still ran on rails instead of magnetic fields. <words>156</words>  

A shadow moved near the hangar’s far wall—a figure she recognized from the market, where they’d shared a chance encounter over baskets of bruised peaches. <words>183</words> His name was Eli, and he carried the same tension in his shoulders that she did, the kind that came from trying to overcome a deep-seated prejudice. <words>208</words> “You followed it too,” he said, nodding at the punch in her hand. <words>221</words>  

Mara hesitated. <words>222</words> The unspoken rules said they shouldn’t trust each other, shouldn’t even be here. <words>236</words> But the punch had brought them together, its purpose unclear yet undeniably urgent. <words>252</words> “It’s like it’s decaying,” she admitted, running a thumb over its tarnished surface. <words>269</words> “But not in the way things usually do.” <words>278</words>  

Eli exhaled, his breath fogging in the hangar’s chill. <words>288</words> “Maybe it’s decaying into something else,” he offered. <words>298</words> “Something new.” <words>301</words>  

The idea settled between them, fragile but alive. <words>310</words> Mara thought of her clients, the way they clung to her for warmth, as if touch could stitch their broken pieces back together. <words>333</words> Eli thought of the peaches, their soft spots hiding sweetness beneath. <words>347</words>  

Outside, the acceptance speech began, its muffled applause a distant echo. <words>362</words> Here, in the hangar’s silence, Mara and Eli stood at the edge of something neither could name. <words>382</words> The punch hummed in Mara’s palm, its weight shifting, as if it, too, was ready to let go of the past. <words>405</words>  

“We could try,” Eli said, and for the first time, Mara believed him. <words>420</words>  

The phantom train ticket punch glowed faintly, its decay giving way to light. <words>435</words> Around them, the hangar’s walls seemed to breathe, the air thick with ancient novelty and the promise of a journey neither had dared to imagine. <words>462</words> Together, they stepped forward, leaving the unspoken rules behind. <words>476</words>
