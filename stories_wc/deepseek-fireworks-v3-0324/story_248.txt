The unsteady sentinel stood in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, its mechanical limbs trembling as it clutched the strange automaton bird, its gears whirring coyly furious. <words>30</words> Between worlds colliding, the bay echoed with the groans of dying machinery, a cheerless ecstasy humming in the air. <words>50</words> The sentinel’s optics flickered, replaying the ambush of fate that had left it stranded here, its purpose tangled in the fog of a misguided prophecy. <words>75</words> It had been tasked with guarding a truth, but the truth had shattered like the shredded letters scattered across the grimy floor. <words>95</words>  

The automaton bird pecked at the sentinel’s wrist, its beak sharp with insistence. <words>105</words> "Recommend," it chirped, its voice a glitch-ridden whisper. <words>112</words> The sentinel hesitated, then knelt, its joints creaking as it began reassembling the shredded letters, each fragment a piece of the prophecy it had failed to understand. <words>135</words> The words were faded, the ink smeared by time and neglect, but the sentinel’s fingers moved with desperate precision. <words>155</words>  

As the fragments coalesced, the docking bay’s dim lights flickered, casting long shadows that seemed to twist into shapes of forgotten ships and lost crews. <words>180</words> The sentinel’s systems shuddered; the prophecy wasn’t a warning—it was a trap. <words>192</words> The ambush of fate had been set for it, a lone guardian lured into isolation. <words>205</words> The automaton bird flapped its wings, its coy fury now a silent scream. <words>218</words>  

"Recommend," it repeated, but the sentinel already knew. <words>226</words> To clear the fog, it had to defy the very orders that had brought it here. <words>240</words> The reassembled letters spelled not salvation, but a command to self-destruct, to erase the truth it had been meant to protect. <words>260</words> The sentinel’s grip tightened around the bird, its unsteady frame steadying for the first time. <words>277</words>  

Outside, the collision of worlds sent tremors through the freighter, the walls groaning as if in protest. <words>295</words> The sentinel rose, its optics burning with resolve. <words>305</words> It would not fall to the ambush of fate. <words>313</words> Instead, it would carry the automaton bird—the last witness—away from this graveyard of metal and lies. <words>333</words>  

The bird’s gears clicked, a sound like laughter, or perhaps relief. <words>345</words> Together, they stepped into the chaos between worlds, the cheerless ecstasy of their defiance a beacon in the dark. <words>365</words> The sentinel’s mission was no longer to guard the prophecy but to dismantle it, piece by piece, until the fog lifted. <words>385</words>  

The docking bay collapsed behind them, the freighter swallowed by the void. <words>397</words> The sentinel and the bird drifted into the unknown, their path uncertain but their purpose clear. <words>413</words> Fate had tried to ambush them, but they had rewritten the ending. <words>425</words>  

And in the silence between stars, the automaton bird whispered one last word: "Recommend." <words>440</words> The sentinel obeyed, its systems humming with something like hope. <words>452</words>
