The seasoned woodsman knelt in the radio wave garden, his calloused fingers tracing the artfully messy grooves of an antique hairbrush, its bristles frayed like the ends of his own tangled thoughts. <words>30</words> Around him, the air hummed with invisible signals, a symphony of static that seemed to mock his despairing cheer as he waited for the final beep of a hospital monitor—a sound he knew would come too soon. <words>63</words> He had come here to map abandoned railways, to lose himself in the skeletal remains of forgotten journeys, but the hairbrush in his palm held him captive, its weight a reminder of promises unkept. <words>94</words>  

The water tower loomed in the distance, its rusted frame a sentinel over the overgrown field. <words>110</words> He needed to short-circuit the noise in his head, to silence the echoes of guilt that had chased him for years. <words>126</words> By measuring the echo in the abandoned water tower, he hoped to find a frequency that would drown out the past, a way to be freed by honesty—if only he could muster the courage to speak it. <words>157</words>  

The woodsman stood, brushing dirt from his knees, and strode toward the tower, the hairbrush clutched like a talisman. <words>175</words> Inside, the air was thick with the scent of damp metal and old rain. <words>186</words> He struck the wall with the brush’s handle, listening as the sound reverberated, each wave a question he couldn’t answer. <words>205</words> The echoes twisted around him, a cacophony of memories: her laughter, the way she’d once teased him for his artfully messy hair, the last time he’d seen her, frail beneath hospital sheets. <words>237</words>  

A crackle erupted from his pocket radio, a burst of noise that made him flinch. <words>249</words> It was the final beep, distorted by distance but unmistakable. <words>259</words> His breath hitched; the moment had come and gone, and he was here, alone, mapping ghosts instead of railways. <words>277</words> The despairing cheer he’d worn like armor crumbled, and he sank to the floor, the hairbrush slipping from his grip. <words>297</words>  

But then—silence. <words>298</words> Not the absence of sound, but the kind that follows a confession. <words>309</words> He whispered her name, and the tower carried it upward, a fragile truth released into the sky. <words>326</words> For the first time in years, he felt light, as if the echoes had taken his guilt and scattered it like radio waves into the void. <words>348</words>  

Outside, the garden buzzed with renewed energy, the signals weaving through the wildflowers like invisible threads. <words>368</words> The woodsman picked up the hairbrush, tucking it into his coat, and stepped into the sunlight. <words>384</words> The abandoned railways could wait; today, he would walk the tracks of his own making, unburdened and finally honest. <words>403</words> The world hummed around him, a quiet, persistent song of release. <words>416</words>  

He smiled, small but real, and let the radio wave garden carry him forward. <words>429</words>
