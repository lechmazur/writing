The shipwrecked merchant awoke in the ghost station’s observation deck, his fingers tracing the flaking edges of a travel poster promising paradise. <words>28</words> The last tree had fallen somewhere beyond the stars, and now only the hollow hum of machinery filled the void. <words>48</words> He clutched the rustic butter churn to his chest—an honestly strange relic from a world that no longer existed. <words>69</words> Its wooden staves were splintered, yet it pulsed with rebellious sparks, as if refusing to accept the grand illusion of order around him. <words>92</words>  

The station’s artificial gravity tugged at him, but he felt lighter, untethered. <words>104</words> The butter churn was more than a tool; it was a defiance, a fragment of earth’s lost chaos. <words>122</words> He studied the poster again—a vibrant forest, a sky unbroken by steel. <words>135</words> With aloof passion, he pressed his palm against it, feeling the brittle paper crumble. <words>149</words> Then, as if answering a silent call, he began to ascend. <words>160</words>  

The flaking edges of the poster peeled away like a ladder, revealing a hidden path behind the station’s sterile walls. <words>180</words> The merchant climbed, the butter churn swaying at his side, its rhythmic creak a counterpoint to the station’s sterile silence. <words>200</words> Below, the observation deck shrank, its vast windows reflecting a cosmos that felt increasingly artificial. <words>218</words> He knew his motivation now: to shatter the grand illusion, to prove that something raw and unruly still existed. <words>238</words>  

The higher he climbed, the more the station resisted. <words>246</words> Panels hissed shut, but the butter churn’s rebellious sparks flared, melting the seams. <words>261</words> The merchant laughed—a sound so out of place it seemed to startle the station itself. <words>276</words> At last, he reached a narrow ledge where the poster’s fragments swirled like leaves in an unfelt wind. <words>295</words> Beyond it, a crack in the station’s hull revealed not the void, but a sliver of green. <words>312</words>  

He hesitated, then swung the butter churn against the crack. <words>322</words> The impact sent a shockwave through the station, and for a moment, the grand illusion flickered. <words>339</words> The observation deck’s windows shattered, revealing not stars, but branches—thick, gnarled, and alive. <words>357</words> The merchant stepped through, into the scent of soil and the sound of birdsong. <words>371</words> The last tree hadn’t fallen after all; it had been hidden, waiting. <words>385</words>  

The butter churn slipped from his grasp, rolling into the undergrowth. <words>397</words> He didn’t need it anymore. <words>401</words> The rebellious sparks had done their work, and the merchant, once adrift, now stood rooted. <words>418</words> Behind him, the ghost station groaned, its illusion collapsing like the flaking edges of a forgotten dream. <words>437</words> He inhaled deeply, the air thick with the honesty of strangeness, and smiled. <words>451</words> The climb had been worth it. <words>456</words>  

Above, the sky was no longer a construct but a living thing, and the merchant knew he’d finally found his true trade—not in goods, but in truth. <words>483</words> The last tree stretched its branches toward him, and he reached back, aloof passion giving way to something warmer. <words>503</words> The grand illusion was shattered, and in its place, the world began again. <words>519</words>
