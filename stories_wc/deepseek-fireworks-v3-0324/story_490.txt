The caravan repair station stood silent after the waves receded from the deserted shore, its rusted hinges creaking in the salt-laden wind. <words>28</words>  
Inside, the fading caretaker moved with enthusiastic apathy, his fingers brushing against a dried lavender bundle tucked beneath the counter—its scent a ghost of summers long past. <words>56</words>  
He had once been meticulous, but now his routines were methodically random, a dance of forgotten purpose. <words>75</words>  
The allure of the forbidden called to him, whispering of secrets buried in the ancient archives he’d spent years hacking, fragment by fragmented fragment. <words>100</words>  
Tonight, he would gorge on knowledge, devouring truths that others had dared not touch. <words>115</words>  
The archives spoke of a void, a darkness that cradled the unknown like a newborn galaxy, and he longed to hold it too. <words>135</words>  
His hands trembled as he unspooled another brittle scroll, its symbols pulsing with a light only he could see. <words>155</words>  
Outside, the wind howled through the station’s broken windows, carrying the scent of lavender and decay. <words>173</words>  
He laughed, a sound like cracking ice, and traced a finger along the scroll’s edge. <words>189</words>  
The words slithered into his mind, promising power, promising ruin. <words>201</words>  
He had once repaired caravans; now, he dismantled reality. <words>212</words>  
The lavender crumbled in his grip, its petals scattering like ashes. <words>225</words>  
He wondered if he’d already gone too far, if the archives had hollowed him out as thoroughly as the shorelines the waves had abandoned. <words>248</words>  
But the void beckoned, its pull irresistible. <words>257</words>  
He closed his eyes and let the knowledge consume him, piece by jagged piece. <words>272</words>  
When he opened them again, the station was gone, replaced by an expanse of stars—or perhaps something hungrier. <words>293</words>  
The caretaker smiled, his apathy finally giving way to something like joy. <words>307</words>  
He had cradled the unknown, and now it cradled him back. <words>320</words>  
The lavender’s last scent faded as the stars began to sing. <words>332</words>  
He listened, rapt, as the melody unraveled the seams of his being. <words>345</words>  
The repair station, the shore, the archives—all were fragments of a dream he’d outgrown. <words>362</words>  
The void was not forbidden; it was home. <words>371</words>  
He stepped forward, into the embrace of the infinite, and let the waves of darkness wash over him. <words>389</words>  
Behind, the dried lavender bundle disintegrated, its purpose fulfilled. <words>402</words>  
The caretaker was gone, but the stars remembered his name. <words>414</words>  
And somewhere, in the ruins of a world he’d left behind, the wind carried the echo of his laughter. <words>434</words>  
The shore remained deserted, the archives silent, the caravan repair station a relic of a time when the forbidden had still been worth fearing. <words>458</words>  
Now, there was only the void—and the fading caretaker, who had finally found his place within it. <words>477</words>
