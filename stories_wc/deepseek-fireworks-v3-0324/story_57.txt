The submissive aristocrat, Lord Edwin, knelt amid yard work, pruning roses with a dull letter opener, his unusually perceptive eyes scanning the garden for the wounded sparrow he’d sworn to protect. <words>34</words>  

The bird had nested in the hedges of his estate, its wing bent at a cruel angle, and Edwin—despite his title—felt a silent empathy for its fragility, a kinship he’d never admit aloud. <words>71</words>  

Overhead, the distant hum of machinery betrayed the secret agent workshop hidden beneath his manor, where his brother, the true heir, tinkered with gadgets designed to liquify steel. <words>103</words>  

Edwin’s fingers tightened around the letter opener, its edge too blunt for roses or rebellion, as he eavesdropped on the echoing chatter from the workshop vents—unplanned, but inevitable in a house built on whispers. <words>139</words>  

“The target’s in the garden,” his brother’s voice crackled through the pipes, laced with earnest flippancy. “Neutralize it before it sings.” <words>163</words>  

Edwin’s breath hitched. The sparrow. They thought it was a bugged drone. He scooped the trembling creature into his coat, its heartbeat a frantic drum against his ribs. <words>192</words>  

The letter opener slipped from his grip, clattering onto the gravel—a sound that would’ve been innocuous if not for the sudden silence from below. <words>216</words>  

Footsteps echoed up the cellar stairs. Edwin’s mind raced. He couldn’t fight, couldn’t lie, but he could vanish. <words>236</words>  

With the sparrow tucked against his chest, he darted into the hedge maze, its walls thick enough to muffle his flight. The workshop’s devices could liquify walls, but not memories. <words>266</words>  

His brother’s voice boomed through the garden, amused and sharp. “Edwin, really? A bird?” <words>282</words>  

Edwin didn’t answer. He pressed deeper into the maze, the sparrow’s warmth a silent plea. He’d protect it, even if it meant dissolving into the shadows of his own home. <words>311</words>  

The letter opener, forgotten on the path, gleamed dully under the sun—a useless tool, much like Edwin himself, or so they said. <words>333</words>  

But useless things could still cut. And Edwin, for once, felt the edge of his own resolve. <words>351</words>  

The workshop’s machines whirred to life, their vibrations shaking the earth. Edwin crouched low, the sparrow’s feathers brushing his palm. <words>373</words>  

“Stay quiet,” he murmured, though the bird couldn’t understand. Or maybe it could. The world was full of unheard languages. <words>397</words>  

His brother’s laughter rang out, closer now. Edwin closed his eyes, listening—not to the threats, but to the sparrow’s breath, steadying his own. <words>421</words>  

The maze twisted around them, a labyrinth of thorns and time. Edwin exhaled. For the first time, he knew exactly where he was going. <words>446</words>  

The sparrow stirred, as if sensing his resolve. Together, they disappeared into the green. <words>463</words>  

Somewhere behind them, the workshop’s machines hissed, and the world began to liquify. But not them. Not yet. <words>484</words>
