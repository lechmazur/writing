The insomniac poet paced the haunted attic, their footsteps muffled by the meticulously messy piles of botanical samples strewn across the floorboards. <words>25</words> Between subway stops, the city’s pulse thrummed through the walls, a distant echo of lives moving too fast to notice the whispers curling from the shadows. <words>50</words> The poet had come here to discover the power of non-violence, but the attic had other plans—its emptiness abundant with unseen presences, their warnings in whispers slithering like vines around their thoughts. <words>80</words>  

A dried orchid crumbled underfoot, its petals brittle as old bones, and the poet shuddered. <words>93</words> They’d collected these samples to preserve beauty, but now they wondered if beauty was just another thing to eliminate. <words>110</words> The attic’s air thickened, heavy with the scent of damp paper and regret, as the poet traced a finger along the spine of a notebook filled with half-finished verses. <words>135</words>  

Last night, at an after-party, they’d tried to confess their fears via drunken confessions, slurring words about the attic’s whispers to strangers who only laughed and refilled their glass. <words>165</words> No one listened. <words>166</words> The poet’s hands trembled as they plucked a wilted fern from the chaos, its fronds whispering secrets of decay. <words>185</words> They’d always thought violence was a fist, a shout, a war—but what if it was silence, neglect, the slow rot of things left unseen? <words>210</words>  

A draft slithered through the attic, scattering pages like startled birds. <words>221</words> The poet knelt, gathering their scattered words, each line a failed attempt to name the unease gnawing at them. <words>240</words> The whispers grew louder, not in their ears but in their ribs, a vibration of something ancient and patient. <words>260</words> They realized then: the attic wasn’t haunted by ghosts, but by the weight of everything they’d refused to confront. <words>285</words>  

The poet exhaled, setting the fern back into its place among the chaos. <words>300</words> They wouldn’t eliminate the whispers—they’d listen. <words>308</words> Non-violence wasn’t just absence; it was presence, attention, the courage to face the rot and still reach for growth. <words>330</words> The subway rattled beneath the building, a reminder of the world rushing by, but here, between stops, the poet sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by the meticulously messy evidence of life persisting. <words>365</words>  

The attic’s emptiness no longer felt barren. <words>371</words> It was full—of whispers, of decay, of the poet’s quiet resolve to tend to what others might discard. <words>395</words> They picked up their pen, the page before them blank but not empty, and began to write. <words>412</words>  

Outside, the city roared on, but in the haunted attic, the poet discovered a different kind of power—one that grew in the dark, between the lines, where warnings in whispers became the seeds of something new. <words>450</words>
