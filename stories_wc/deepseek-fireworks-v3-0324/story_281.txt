The baffled pickpocket, known only as Vale, crouched in the haunted lighthouse engine room, his fingers twitching over the eerie ventriloquist dummy slumped against a rusted gearbox. <words>30</words> Its chipped paint and hollow eyes seemed to follow him, though he couldn’t decide if its gaze was mocking or pleading. <words>50</words> Vale had stolen it on a whim between appointments, drawn by its confusingly lucid whisper—a voice that wasn’t there, yet echoed in his skull like a half-remembered verse. <words>80</words>  

“You’re just wood and strings,” he muttered, but the dummy’s grin widened, as if privy to a joke he didn’t grasp. <words>100</words> The art of transformation, Vale realized, wasn’t just about slipping wallets—it was about becoming something else entirely. <words>120</words> The dummy’s presence demanded it, scorching poise radiating from its stiff limbs. <words>135</words>  

To challenge the status quo, Vale decided to sustain the strange dialogue, though his throat tightened with every word. <words>155</words> Through impromptu poetry sessions, he wrestled with the dummy’s cryptic prompts, each line twisting his thoughts into knots. <words>175</words> “Speak in riddles, and I’ll answer in theft,” he declared, but the dummy only tilted its head, its silence louder than the groaning machinery around them. <words>200</words>  

The engine room’s shadows deepened, the air thick with salt and oil. <words>215</words> Vale’s usual confidence frayed; he was a ghost in his own life, a specter slipping through crowds, but here, he felt seen. <words>235</words> The dummy’s unblinking stare stripped him bare, exposing the hunger beneath his slick fingers. <words>250</words>  

“What do you want?” he snapped, gripping the dummy’s shoulders. <words>260</words> Its jaw creaked open, and a single word rasped out: “More.” <words>270</words> Vale recoiled, but the command lodged in his ribs. <words>280</words> He’d spent years taking, but now he was the one being emptied. <words>295</words>  

The lighthouse beacon flickered, casting jagged light across the walls. <words>310</words> Vale’s hands trembled as he recited another verse, the words spilling like stolen coins. <words>325</words> The dummy’s laughter—dry as kindling—filled the room, and for a heartbeat, Vale swore its fingers twitched. <words>345</words>  

By dawn, he was gone, the dummy left atop the gearbox, its grin sharper than before. <words>365</words> Vale walked away lighter, his pockets empty but his mind alight. <words>380</words> The art of transformation had claimed him, and the status quo would never feel the same. <words>400</words>  

The lighthouse stood silent, its engine room humming with a new, unsettling energy. <words>415</words> And somewhere, in the space between appointments, the dummy waited—patient, knowing, ready. <words>435</words>  

Vale never stole again. <words>438</words> But sometimes, in the quietest hours, he still heard the poetry. <words>450</words>
