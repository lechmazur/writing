The apathetic summoner yawned, stretching his arms as the rustic coffee grinder whirred between his fingers, its coarse rhythm the only sound in the shared dream recording studio. <words>25</words> He had been here for hours, or maybe days—time blurred after the last breath of a dying god, when the world had sighed and settled into a strange, quiet limbo. <words>52</words> The summoner wasn’t sure why he’d agreed to help rebuild coral reefs, but the task had unfolded before him like a half-remembered dream, and he’d shrugged, too lazily enthusiastic to refuse. <words>82</words>  

Across the room, empty frames hung on the walls, their edges warped and weathered. <words>96</words> They were supposed to match, though no one could recall what they’d once held. <words>108</words> The summoner tapped one, and the frame shuddered, revealing a glimmer of river wisdom—a fleeting vision of water carving stone, patient and inevitable. <words>132</words> He sighed. <words>133</words> Even the river’s patience felt like too much effort. <words>142</words>  

“You’re late,” murmured the studio’s keeper, a figure woven from shadows and static. <words>158</words> The summoner shrugged again, grinding another handful of beans. <words>168</words> “Time’s dead,” he said, the words sharp but gentle, like a knife wrapped in silk. <words>183</words> “Besides, the reefs won’t rebuild themselves.” <words>191</words>  

The keeper gestured to the frames. <words>196</words> “They’re waiting.” <words>198</words> The summoner rolled his eyes but stepped forward, pressing his palm to the nearest frame. <words>213</words> The studio trembled, and the frames began to glow, their emptiness filling with fragments of dreams—fish darting through azure waves, polyps stretching toward the sun. <words>240</words> It was working, though the summoner couldn’t muster more than a flicker of interest. <words>255</words>  

A coral reef materialized in the air, its colors too vivid, its edges too perfect. <words>271</words> The summoner frowned. <words>274</words> “It’s not real,” he muttered. <words>279</words>  

“It’s real enough,” the keeper replied. <words>286</words> “Dreams are just memories waiting to happen.” <words>295</words>  

The summoner exhaled, watching the reef dissolve into motes of light. <words>308</words> He’d have to try again, to fold the dream into something the waking world could hold. <words>325</words> But for now, he reached for the grinder, the weight of it familiar in his hands. <words>341</words> The keeper watched, silent, as the summoner closed his eyes and let the river’s wisdom seep into his bones—slow, relentless, and utterly indifferent. <words>366</words>  

The frames hummed, their empty spaces pulsing with potential. <words>376</words> The summoner smiled, a lazy, enthusiastic thing, and let the dream unfold. <words>389</words>  

Outside, the first tendrils of dawn brushed the horizon, and somewhere, far beneath the waves, a single polyp clung to life. <words>411</words> It was a start. <words>413</words> The summoner took a sip of his coffee, bitter and strong, and wondered if indifference was just another kind of patience. <words>434</words> The frames shimmered, and the studio held its breath. <words>444</words>  

The reefs would return. <words>447</words> Or they wouldn’t. <words>449</words> Either way, the summoner had already forgotten why it mattered. <words>461</words>
