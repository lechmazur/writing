The dutiful scholar adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, fingers brushing against the small wire coil in his pocket—a relic from a future he wasn’t supposed to remember. <words>25</words>  
Around him, the capsule hotel hummed with the quiet energy of time travelers, their presence uncommonly typical in this transient space between eras. <words>50</words>  
Amid the calm that settled before a crucial test—his own, or perhaps the world’s—he felt the weight of the unspoken heart, the story he’d sworn to silence. <words>78</words>  
The coil pulsed faintly, as if reacting to the echo of a voice in an old well, a sound only he could hear. <words>98</words>  
It was a contamination, not of the body but of the mind, a whisper from a timeline that should have been erased. <words>120</words>  
He had come here to let a forbidden tale be told, though the cost might unravel the fragile seams of history. <words>142</words>  
The air in the capsule hotel carried the scent of ozone and old paper, a paradox of earthbound flight—grounded yet yearning. <words>166</words>  
The scholar’s fingers tightened around the coil, its ridges biting into his palm. <words>181</words>  
He had found it in the ruins of a library, a place that no longer existed, its words ash in the wind. <words>201</words>  
The voice from the well had guided him there, a murmur threading through time like a needle. <words>220</words>  
Now, standing in this liminal space, he wondered if he was the storyteller or the story itself. <words>240</words>  
The other travelers moved past him, their faces blurred by the hotel’s dim lighting, their purposes unknown. <words>261</words>  
He envied their anonymity, their freedom from the burden he carried. <words>277</words>  
The coil grew warmer, its energy seeping into his skin, a silent plea. <words>293</words>  
He knew what he had to do. <words>299</words>  
Stepping into his assigned capsule, he pressed the coil to the wall, where the metal thrummed with latent power. <words>321</words>  
The echo of the well’s voice swelled around him, filling the tiny space with words long forbidden. <words>342</words>  
They spilled from his lips, a confession to the empty air, a story of a future that must never be. <words>364</words>  
The capsule shuddered, its walls flickering with stolen light. <words>379</words>  
Outside, the hotel’s calm fractured, time travelers stirring as the fabric of their reality trembled. <words>400</words>  
The scholar’s heart raced, but his voice never wavered. <words>413</words>  
He spoke until the coil glowed white-hot, until the echo became a roar. <words>429</words>  
Then, silence. <words>430</words>  
The capsule door hissed open, revealing not the hotel but a field of stars, the earthbound flight finally realized. <words>453</words>  
The unspoken heart had been freed, its tale now woven into the cosmos. <words>469</words>  
The scholar smiled, his duty fulfilled, his contamination complete. <words>483</words>  
As the stars swallowed him, he wondered if anyone would remember. <words>498</words>  
But some stories, he knew, were never meant to be forgotten. <words>513</words>  
The hotel faded behind him, its calm restored, its travelers none the wiser. <words>530</words>
