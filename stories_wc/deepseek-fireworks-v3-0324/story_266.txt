The bleak clown balanced on the edge of the floating rock yoga studio, his oversized shoes gripping the moss-slick surface as the clock hand in his pocket spun relentlessly, ticking like a frantic heartbeat. <words>32</words> Dawn’s earliest train whistled far below, its departure a drifting promise he’d once made to himself—to outshine the northern lights with a grin so bright it would fracture the sky. <words>65</words> But the world was technically absurd, and so was he: a master of dismantling illusions, though only in the private poetry he scrawled on napkins and discarded like confetti. <words>98</words>  

The studio trembled as he stepped inside, the rock swaying gently in the high-altitude wind. <words>116</words> Around him, yogis moved in slow, deliberate arcs, their serenity a stark contrast to his jagged generosity—the way he laughed too loud, too long, as if laughter could stitch together the fraying edges of his soul. <words>154</words> The clock hand whirred against his thigh, a reminder of time slipping, slipping, always slipping. <words>172</words>  

He’d come here to perform, to twist balloons into animals that would wilt before the children’s eyes, to juggle knives that never quite caught the light. <words>200</words> But the northern lights shimmered in the distance, their brilliance a taunt. <words>213</words> So instead, he pulled the clock hand from his pocket and held it aloft, letting its spin cast fractured shadows across the studio walls. <words>240</words> The yogis paused, their breaths held mid-pose, as he began to recite his private poetry—words about drifting promises and the weight of smiles that never quite reached the eyes. <words>272</words>  

The room grew colder, the air thinner, as if the floating rock itself leaned in to listen. <words>290</words> One by one, the yogis sat, their mats forgotten, their stillness a mirror to his chaos. <words>308</words> The clown’s voice cracked on the last verse, but his grin never wavered—it was a performance, after all, and performances demanded mastery. <words>335</words>  

When he finished, the northern lights pulsed once, then dimmed, as if acknowledging defeat. <words>353</words> The clock hand stilled in his palm, its spin exhausted, its purpose fulfilled. <words>369</words> The yogis exhaled in unison, their gratitude unspoken but palpable. <words>384</words> The clown bowed, his shoes squeaking against the rock, and stepped back into the dawn, where the train’s distant rumble echoed like another promise he might yet keep. <words>415</words>  

The floating studio drifted on, carrying the weight of his words and the ghost of his grin, while below, the world woke to a day no brighter than before—but perhaps, for a moment, a little less bleak. <words>450</words>
