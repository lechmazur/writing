The selectively mute ventriloquist sat on the parallel universe beach, his fingers tracing the ridges of a cardboard coffee sleeve as the diner’s neon sign flickered off behind him—after the last call. <words>34</words>  

He’d come here to archive weather patterns, scribbling notes in a waterlogged journal, but the real storm was in his chest. The waves crashed in time with his heartbeat, a rhythm of euphoric agitation. <words>72</words>  

His dummy, a worn-out sailor named Barnaby, lay face-down in the sand, silent for once. The ventriloquist couldn’t bring himself to speak, not even through Barnaby. Not after what he’d overheard. <words>108</words>  

Earlier, through accidental overheard phone calls at the diner, he’d learned his brother—the one who’d always patronized his “hopelessly optimistic” dreams—was selling their childhood home. The last thread of their family, snipped. <words>146</words>  

He crushed the coffee sleeve in his fist. It was stupid, but it felt like holding onto something. Redefining family wasn’t about blood, he’d told himself for years. Yet here he was, gutted. <words>180</words>  

A seagull screeched. Barnaby’s head lolled toward him, as if asking, *What now?* The ventriloquist sighed, picking him up. He didn’t need words to answer. He adjusted Barnaby’s hat, the dummy’s painted grin mocking his own silence. <words>230</words>  

Then, like a cue from the universe, the sky split open—not with rain, but with a shower of bioluminescent jellyfish, drifting down like misplaced stars. The ventriloquist gasped, his hopeless optimism flaring. <words>272</words>  

Barnaby’s voice, rusty but familiar, spilled from his lips without thought: “Well, ain’t that a sign?” The ventriloquist laughed, startled by his own sound. Maybe family wasn’t a house. Maybe it was this—a dummy, a coffee sleeve, and a sky full of falling light. <words>332</words>  

He stood, brushing sand from his pants, and tucked the crumpled sleeve into his pocket. The jellyfish pulsed around him, casting the beach in an eerie glow. He’d archive this weather too. <words>370</words>  

Back at the diner, his brother’s car was still there. The ventriloquist hesitated, then knocked on the window. When his brother rolled it down, he didn’t speak. Instead, he held out Barnaby. <words>410</words>  

His brother stared, then—miraculously—took the dummy. “You’re still a weirdo,” he said, but his voice cracked. The ventriloquist smiled, nodding. It was enough. <words>440</words>  

Under the jellyfish-lit sky, they sat on the hood of the car, passing Barnaby back and forth, redefining family in silence. The ventriloquist’s heart pounded, not with loss, but with something brighter. <words>480</words>  

The coffee sleeve fell from his pocket, carried away by the wind. He let it go. <words>497</words>
