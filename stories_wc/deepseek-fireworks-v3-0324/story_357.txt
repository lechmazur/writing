The focused collector adjusted his spectacles, peering at the black rose pinned in his journal—its petals brittle, its thorns sharp as forgotten promises. <words>25</words> He had found it in the frost giant’s lair years ago, a relic of a world that no longer cared for beauty. <words>48</words> The journal, filled with seldom odd treasures, was his testament to embracing solitude, a habit others called eccentric but he called survival. <words>77</words>  

Then, like a crack in ice, a sudden invitation to a party arrived, slipped under his door by unseen hands. <words>98</words> It bore no name, only a time and place: the frost giant’s lair, at midnight, "throughout board game rounds." <words>120</words> The collector smirked, his earnest flippancy a shield against the absurdity. <words>133</words> Who hosted parties in a monster’s den? <words>141</words>  

Yet, he went—not for camaraderie, but to triumph over an alpha predator called despair, which had gnawed at his edges for years. <words>168</words> The lair was as he remembered: walls of jagged ice, the air thick with the scent of old storms. <words>190</words> A table stood in the center, set with a board game whose pieces were carved from bone. <words>210</words> The other guests were shadows, their faces blurred as if by design. <words>227</words>  

"Roll the dice," one murmured, and the game began. <words>237</words> With each move, the collector felt the threads of his isolation unravel, not into loneliness, but into something stranger—a kinship with the absurd. <words>265</words> The board game rounds stretched, time bending like a frozen river. <words>280</words> He laughed when he should have trembled, tossed his black rose onto the board like a gambler’s bet. <words>303</words>  

The frost giant, when it appeared, was not a monster but a mirror—its eyes reflecting his own seldom odd defiance. <words>328</words> "You collect to forget," it rumbled, "but tonight, you play to remember." <words>344</words> The collector hesitated, then nodded. <words>350</words> Despair was just another opponent, and he had spent a lifetime learning its moves. <words>370</words>  

By dawn, the party had dissolved, leaving only his journal and the rose, now pressed between two pages like a secret. <words>397</words> The collector walked home, the weight of solitude lighter, his steps unburdened. <words>415</words> He had not won the game, but he had played it—and that, he decided, was victory enough. <words>437</words>  

The next morning, he pinned a new rose in his journal, this one red as a challenge. <words>456</words> The frost giant’s lair waited, but so did he, ready for the next round. <words>473</words> After all, despair was just another alpha predator, and he was learning how to hunt. <words>495</words>  

He closed the journal, smiling. <words>499</words> The party had been odd, but so was he—and that, perhaps, was the point. <words>517</words>
