The unassuming monarch trudged through the acid rain forest, her boots sinking into the ashen soil as the sky wept its corrosive tears. <words>30</words> She clutched the box of mismatched puzzle pieces close to her chest, its weight a familiar comfort in this ruined world. <words>52</words> The ember of choice flickered within her, a dim but stubborn light amid the gloom. <words>70</words> She moved lethargically energetic, her body weary from years of rule, yet her mind sharp with purpose. <words>89</words>  

Around her, the forest hissed and groaned, its twisted trees shedding bark like scabs. <words>104</words> She paused to perceive the world not with her eyes, but via the texture of a feather she plucked from her cloak—its delicate barbs whispering secrets of the wind. <words>132</words> It told her of storms yet to come, of lives clinging to the edges of survival. <words>148</words>  

After the collapse of civilization, she had risen not by force, but by the quiet insistence of those who saw wisdom in her calloused hands. <words>175</words> They had asked her to cradle it, to protect it, and so she had, though the weight often left her breathless. <words>196</words> The puzzle pieces in the box were all that remained of the old world’s maps, their edges worn smooth by time and touch. <words>220</words>  

A prickly wonder filled her as she studied them, each fragment a riddle without an answer. <words>237</words> She wondered if they could ever fit together again, or if they were meant to stay broken, like the land itself. <words>256</words> The acid rain pattered against her hood, its bite a reminder of the world’s relentless decay. <words>274</words>  

Her people waited beyond the forest, their faces gaunt but hopeful. <words>286</words> They believed she could lead them to something better, though she herself doubted. <words>301</words> The feather trembled in her grip, its message unclear. <words>313</words> She sighed and tucked it away, turning her attention back to the box. <words>328</words>  

Perhaps the pieces weren’t meant to form a whole. <words>338</words> Perhaps they were meant to be rearranged, to create something new from the wreckage. <words>354</words> The thought ignited the ember within her, casting a fragile warmth against the cold. <words>371</words> She closed the box and stepped forward, her resolve hardening like the scarred earth beneath her feet. <words>391</words>  

The forest thinned, revealing the ragged tents of her people. <words>403</words> They gathered around her, their eyes reflecting the same prickly wonder she felt. <words>419</words> She opened the box and let them see the pieces, their mismatched edges glinting in the faint light. <words>439</words>  

“We build anew,” she said, her voice rough but steady. <words>450</words> And as the acid rain faded to a drizzle, the ember of choice burned a little brighter. <words>467</words>
