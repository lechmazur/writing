The nervous minstrel plucked at his lute with trembling fingers, his voice wavering as he sang to the flickering crowd in the bacteria-powered city’s dim-lit tavern. <words>30</words> The air hummed with the faint glow of microbial lanterns, casting long shadows over the faces of patrons who laughed too loudly and smiled too little. <words>56</words> In his pocket, the crumpled photograph of a woman he barely remembered burned like a secret, its edges frayed from years of anxious handling. <words>84</words> He had stolen it from a noble’s manor, a reckless act that now felt like his only tether to something beyond the ordinary. <words>108</words>  

The minstrel’s songs were rarely sincere, woven with half-truths and borrowed melodies, but tonight, the weight of the photograph made his lies taste bitter. <words>138</words> He glanced at the lone candle on his table, its flame dancing precariously—time was slipping away. <words>157</words> With a deep breath, he decided to deploy his plan: he would leave the city by following star patterns, as the old wanderers had whispered in their drunken tales. <words>189</words> The stars were constants in a world of uncertainty, and he clung to the hope they might lead him to purpose. <words>212</words>  

As he slipped into the alleyways, the city’s bioluminescent veins pulsed beneath his feet, a reminder of the life he was abandoning. <words>236</words> The photograph crinkled in his grip, the woman’s smile mocking his cowardice. <words>252</words> Was she a lover? A sister? He couldn’t recall, but her face was the only thing that made him feel real. <words>274</words> Above him, the stars blinked into view, their patterns a cryptic map he strained to decipher. <words>295</words>  

The minstrel’s journey was a cautious revelry—each step forward was a rebellion against the life he’d known, yet every shadow made him flinch. <words>323</words> He hummed to steady his nerves, the melody uneven but earnest for once. <words>340</words> The candle flame in the tavern would gutter out soon, and with it, the last trace of his old self. <words>361</words> He wondered if the stars would forgive him for his insincerity, for the years spent hiding behind borrowed words. <words>385</words>  

By dawn, the city was a distant glow, and the minstrel stood at the edge of an unknown road, the photograph now smoothed against his chest. <words>413</words> The stars had guided him this far, but the rest was his to carve. <words>429</words> For the first time, his hands didn’t shake. <words>437</words> The world was vast, uncertain, and his—if he dared to claim it. <words>453</words> The candle had burned out, but the minstrel’s song was just beginning. <words>469</words>
