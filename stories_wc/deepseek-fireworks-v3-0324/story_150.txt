The outlaw cowboy poet, known only as Harlan, rolled his worn runic bone dice across the steampunk observatory dome’s brass floor, watching as they came to rest against a gear-laden wall. <words>25</words> The dice glowed faintly, their ancient symbols shifting like whispers—a sign of intertwined destinies at play. <words>45</words> Harlan sighed, his virtually peculiar existence a constant dance between lawlessness and lyricism, between the tangible and the inexplicable. <words>69</words>  

Throughout rehearsals for his next performance, he’d noticed the coffee shop walls beneath the dome misalign, their text rewriting itself in real time. <words>91</words> At first, he’d blamed the absinthe, but now he knew better: the walls were speaking to him, and he was the only one who could read them. <words>115</words> Each message sparked an unstoppable curiosity, pulling him deeper into a labyrinth of saturated ambivalence—where every truth felt like a lie, and every lie held a kernel of truth. <words>143</words>  

Tonight, the dice had led him here, to the dome’s heart, where the ceiling opened to a sky choked with smoke and stars. <words>166</words> The walls shimmered, letters peeling away like old paint, forming a new riddle: *"The past is a shadow, the future a ghost—only the misaligned can see what matters most."* <words>198</words> Harlan’s fingers twitched toward his revolver, not out of fear, but habit; the words felt like a challenge. <words>219</words>  

He tossed the dice again, and they landed on a symbol he’d never seen before—a serpent eating its own tail. <words>240</words> The coffee shop walls trembled, their text dissolving into a single phrase: *"You are the bridge."* <words>256</words> Harlan laughed, the sound echoing through the dome. <words>266</words> Of course he was. <words>269</words> An outlaw, a poet, a man caught between worlds—his destiny was never his own. <words>287</words>  

The observatory’s gears groaned, and the dome began to rotate, aligning with a constellation that hadn’t existed yesterday. <words>310</words> Harlan’s curiosity burned brighter, a fire he couldn’t quell. <words>322</words> He pressed his palm against the wall, feeling the text pulse beneath his touch. <words>337</words> *"What do you want?"* he asked, though he already knew the answer. <words>351</words>  

The walls replied: *"To be read."* <words>358</words> And so he did, aloud, his voice weaving the changing words into a poem—one that twisted fate itself. <words>378</words> The dome shuddered, the dice glowed white-hot, and for a moment, Harlan saw all the threads of every destiny, tangled yet beautiful. <words>403</words> Then, just as suddenly, the vision snapped shut. <words>413</words>  

The coffee shop walls were blank. <words>418</words> The dice lay cold and inert. <words>424</words> Harlan tipped his hat to the empty dome and walked away, knowing he’d return tomorrow—because some curiosities are unstoppable, and some destinies refuse to stay misaligned for long. <words>460</words>
