The sullen farmer sat in the forgotten underwater city power station, his calloused fingers tracing the mismatched patches on a passed-down quilt, each frayed edge whispering of generations who had tried and failed to walk away from their own dead ends. <words>45</words>  

His lantern cast flickering shadows on the rusted turbines, their hum long silenced, and in that moment of pure inspiration, he understood why his grandfather had left him the collection of used postage stamps—tiny, faded windows to places he’d never see. <words>90</words>  

The stamps were objectively biased, their colors too bright, their borders too neat, as if the world they depicted had been scrubbed clean of struggle. He scoffed, feeling the borrowed valor of those who’d mailed them, their optimism a relic as drowned as the city around him. <words>138</words>  

With sudden zest, he peeled a stamp from its envelope and pressed it onto the quilt, erasing boundaries between past and present, between the drowned and the living. The fabric drank it in, another patch in a tapestry of failures and fleeting hopes. <words>187</words>  

The power station groaned, a sound like the earth shifting, and he realized he’d been waiting for permission—from the dead, from the stamps, from the quilt—to leave. But the quilt was finished now, its patches a map of all the roads not taken. <words>240</words>  

He stood, the lantern light catching on the stamps, their gummed backs still clinging to the envelopes of letters never sent. The underwater city had been someone else’s dream, someone else’s dead end. His was still above the waves, waiting. <words>293</words>  

The farmer climbed the corroded ladder to the surface, the quilt slung over his shoulder like a flag of surrender. The stamps fluttered in the salt wind, their borders blurring, their stories merging with his. <words>335</words>  

At the shore, he hesitated, glancing back at the submerged ruins. The quilt was heavy with the weight of all those mismatched patches, but for the first time, it felt like his. Not a burden, but a choice. <words>382</words>  

He walked inland, toward the unplanted fields, the stamps whispering in his wake. They had no power to guide him, only to remind him that every boundary was a line someone else had drawn. <words>424</words>  

The farmer smiled, small and sharp, as the wind tore a stamp from the quilt and sent it spinning into the sky. Let it land where it would. He was done with dead ends. <words>460</words>  

The quilt would keep him warm, the stamps would fade, and the underwater city would forget him, as it had forgotten all the others. But the fields—the fields were waiting. <words>495</words>  

He stepped into the sunlight, leaving the borrowed valor of the drowned world behind. <words>511</words>
