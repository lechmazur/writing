The docile bruiser stood amid drum solos, his massive hands trembling around the conductor’s baton rumored to raise the dead. <words>25</words> Around him, the greenhouse labyrinth hummed with hunger, its man-eating plants swaying to a rhythm only they understood. <words>45</words> He had come here by piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards, each fragment a whisper of something greater. <words>67</words> The baton was supposed to be his key, but the language barriers between life and death left him stranded in silence. <words>88</words>  

His name was Elias, a giant with a child’s heart, disturbingly calm even as vines slithered toward his ankles. <words>107</words> He didn’t want power or gold—he wanted to mold a myth from the mud of reality, to prove that even the forgotten could sing. <words>128</words> The baton felt lighter than air, yet heavier than a tombstone. <words>137</words> He raised it, and the plants stilled, as if listening. <words>146</words>  

Then came the twist: the baton didn’t command the dead—it spoke to the living. <words>159</words> The labyrinth responded, its leaves rustling in a language Elias couldn’t grasp. <words>171</words> Frustration bubbled beneath his calm, but he clenched his jaw and swung the baton like a scythe. <words>186</words> The plants recoiled, then lunged, their thorns glistening. <words>195</words>  

A drum solo erupted from nowhere, shaking the glass walls. <words>203</words> Elias laughed, brash tenderness in his voice as he conducted the chaos. <words>215</words> The vines twisted into knots, the flowers spat pollen like curses, but he kept swinging, each motion a question. <words>231</words> What was death, if not another barrier to cross? <words>240</words>  

The labyrinth shuddered. <words>241</words> A path cleared, leading to a single, withered rose. <words>250</words> Elias knelt, pressing the baton to its stem. <words>258</words> The rose bloomed, its petals unfurling into a voice: "You’ve been asking the wrong questions." <words>273</words>  

Elias grinned. <words>274</words> The drum solo faded, leaving only the sound of his breath. <words>285</words> He had come to raise the dead, but the dead had been waiting to speak. <words>298</words> The baton was never a key—it was a bridge. <words>308</words>  

As the plants bowed around him, Elias stepped forward, ready to twist the myth into something new. <words>325</words> The greenhouse labyrinth, once a cage, now sang with brash tenderness, its thorns softening into verses. <words>340</words> He didn’t need words. <words>343</words> The music was enough. <words>347</words>  

And so, amid drum solos and man-eating whispers, the docile bruiser became the conductor of a symphony only the lost could hear. <words>368</words> The baton gleamed in his grip, no longer a rumor, but a truth. <words>380</words> The language barriers fell, not because he understood, but because he listened. <words>394</words>  

The labyrinth breathed. <words>395</words> Elias smiled. <words>396</words> Together, they molded a myth from the mud of reality. <words>407</words>
