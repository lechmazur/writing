The calm assassin moved through the ancient Chinese palace like a shadow, his steps silent but for the occasional creak of aged wood beneath his feet. <words>28</words> In his hands, he carried a botanical press, its wooden frame worn smooth by centuries of use, though its purpose here was far from preserving flowers. <words>54</words> The whispers of longing that filled the palace halls were not just figurative but literally whispered—ghosts of concubines and scholars, their voices tangled in the silk curtains. <words>85</words> Their words brushed against his ears, urging him to amalgamate their desires into something tangible, something alive. <words>102</words>  

He paused before a mural of a butterfly, its wings painted in delicate strokes, each pattern a code he had been trained to decipher. <words>126</words> The assassin smirked; the universe had a sense of humor, asking him to spin a prophecy into raw possibility by the pattern of a butterfly’s wings. <words>151</words> The task was absurd, but so was his profession—killing people for money while pretending it didn’t itch under his skin. <words>172</words>  

The palace’s air hummed with humorous unease, as if the walls themselves were stifling laughter at the irony of his mission. <words>193</words> He unfolded the botanical press, revealing not leaves but a map of the palace, its lines shifting like living veins. <words>214</words> The ghosts leaned in, their whispers growing louder, their longing for resolution pressing against his ribs. <words>231</words>  

“Fine,” he muttered, tracing the butterfly’s wings with one finger, feeling the grooves of paint like raised scars. <words>249</words> The pattern was a key, and the press was the lock; together, they would amalgamate the ghosts’ whispers into a single, audible truth. <words>272</words> He pressed the map into the mural, and the palace shuddered, dust cascading from the ceiling like confetti. <words>292</words>  

The assassin stepped back as the butterfly’s wings fluttered—not figuratively, but literally, peeling away from the wall to hover in the air. <words>315</words> The ghosts fell silent, their longing condensed into the creature’s iridescent scales. <words>330</words> It was done before the first question could be asked, before doubt could unravel the threads of his work. <words>349</words>  

The butterfly alighted on his shoulder, its wings whispering a prophecy no longer bound by the past. <words>367</words> The assassin exhaled, his calm unshaken, though the weight of possibility settled in his chest like a stone. <words>386</words> The palace, now quiet, seemed to sigh in relief, its humor spent, its unease dissolved. <words>402</words> He slipped the botanical press into his sleeve and walked away, the butterfly trailing behind him, a living, breathing answer to whispers he’d never hear again. <words>428</words>  

The assassin didn’t look back. Some prophecies were better left unread. <words>441</words>
