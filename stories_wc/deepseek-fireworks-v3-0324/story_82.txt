In the hush of a hidden sunrise, Eli adjusted the grip on his rusted shovel, staring at the cursed orchard stretching before him—a labyrinth of gnarled trees whispering secrets in the wind. <words>34</words> He hadn’t asked to tend this place, but the deed had fallen to him after his grandfather’s disappearance, leaving him the reluctant caretaker of a legacy he didn’t understand. <words>67</words> The futuristic hub of New Eden glittered in the distance, its neon towers mocking his isolation, but Eli preferred the rotting farmhouses dotting the land—their crumbling walls held answers. <words>103</words>  

Yesterday, in the damp belly of a cave behind the orchard, he’d found it: a fossilized dragon tooth, its surface etched with symbols that made his skin prickle. <words>134</words> Unraveling mysteries was his only solace, and this tooth—an impossibility in a world where dragons were myth—was the most analytically playful puzzle he’d ever held. <words>163</words> He grinned, though the expression tasted of gleeful sorrow; every discovery here was a step closer to madness or truth. <words>186</words>  

The farmhouse nearest the orchard’s edge groaned as Eli pushed inside, floorboards splintering underfoot. <words>204</words> Dust motes danced in the pale light, and he traced his fingers along the walls, searching for the hidden compartments his grandfather had hinted at in his journals. <words>231</words> Behind a loose panel, he found a map—scrawled in shaky ink—leading to a chamber beneath the orchard. <words>251</words> Eli’s pulse quickened; this was it. <words>257</words>  

By dusk, he stood at the map’s marked spot, shovel biting into the earth until metal clanged against stone. <words>279</words> The hidden chamber yawned open, revealing a trove of artifacts: journals, strange tools, and a pedestal where the dragon tooth fit perfectly. <words>304</words> As he slotted it into place, the orchard shuddered, the trees’ whispers coalescing into a voice—his grandfather’s. <words>327</words> “You’ve done well,” it murmured, “but the orchard’s curse is a lock, and you’re the key.” <words>348</words>  

Eli laughed, the sound brittle. <words>353</words> To become the voice of the unknown, he’d have to embrace the curse, to let it unravel him as he unraveled it. <words>376</words> The orchard’s roots twisted around his ankles, not to trap him, but to tether him—to this land, to its secrets, to the weight of a legacy he’d never wanted but now couldn’t refuse. <words>412</words>  

As the first true sunrise in years broke over the horizon, Eli spread his arms, letting the orchard’s whispers fill him. <words>435</words> The gleeful sorrow of understanding settled in his chest, and he knew: some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved, only sung. <words>459</words>  

The dragon tooth glowed, and Eli began to sing. <words>469</words>
