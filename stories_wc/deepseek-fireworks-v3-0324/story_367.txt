The sapped herbalist slumped in the glass-walled observatory, his eyelids heavy as the ocean’s tide rolled in below, its rhythm a lullaby he resisted. <words>30</words> He had come to study tide patterns, but the fervent indifference of the sea—its relentless advance and retreat—left him numb, as if his purpose had been washed away. <words>60</words> Beside him, the blacksmith’s bellows lay discarded, its leather ribs cracked from years of misuse, a relic of his failed attempts to forge the perfect remedy. <words>90</words> Perfection, he mused, had a price, and he had paid it in sleepless nights and withered herbs. <words>110</words>  

Outside, a lone goose cut across the sky, its flight path a jagged line against the twilight. <words>130</words> The herbalist watched it, thoughtfully thoughtless, as if the bird’s aimless journey mirrored his own. <words>150</words> He had once cherished such moments, when the world seemed to pause just for him, but now they felt like taunts. <words>170</words> The observatory, with its panoramic view of the cliff and the churning waves, was meant to inspire clarity, yet it only magnified his exhaustion. <words>200</words>  

A nap tugged at him, but he fought it, fingers brushing the bellows as if it might whisper an answer. <words>220</words> The sea below hissed, its tide patterns erratic, unpredictable—just like his thoughts. <words>240</words> He had sought perfection in his craft, but the more he strained, the more his remedies faltered, leaving him sapped of both energy and hope. <words>270</words> The goose vanished into the horizon, and for a moment, he envied its freedom. <words>290</words>  

Then, as if the universe conspired to mock him, the bellows wheezed—a dry, hollow sound—and he laughed, a bitter chuckle that echoed off the glass walls. <words>320</words> Perhaps perfection wasn’t the goal. <words>330</words> Perhaps it was the chase itself, the flawed, human effort, that mattered. <words>350</words> The tide would rise and fall regardless of his understanding, and the goose would fly where it pleased. <words>370</words>  

With a sigh, he let his head loll back, finally surrendering to the nap. <words>390</words> The bellows lay forgotten, the sea’s indifference no longer a burden but a comfort. <words>410</words> In his dreams, he was neither sapped nor striving, just a man adrift in the vast, imperfect beauty of it all. <words>440</words> When he awoke, the goose was gone, the tide had turned, and the price of perfection felt lighter, if only for a moment. <words>470</words>  

The herbalist stood, stretching stiff limbs, and stepped away from the bellows, leaving it behind like an old regret. <words>490</words> The observatory hummed with quiet resolve, and he walked out, ready to cherish the imperfect path ahead. <words>510</words>
