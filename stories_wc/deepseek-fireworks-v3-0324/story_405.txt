The skeptical gambler shuffled through the dimly lit tunnels of the underground mushroom farm, his fingers brushing against the collection of dried petals in his pocket—a habit he couldn’t shake, even amid recipe testing for the farm’s newest fungal delicacies. <words>38</words>  

The petals were all he had left of her, a truthfully lying reminder of uncharted grief he’d buried deeper than these tunnels. <words>62</words>  

His boss had ordered him to impound a rogue shipment of spores, but the cryptic scrawls on the subway seats leading here had distracted him—symbols that whispered of lost travelers and hidden paths. <words>98</words>  

The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and mycelium, a frantic peace settling over him as he traced the symbols with a trembling finger. <words>124</words>  

He wasn’t just a gambler anymore; the symbols had chosen him to guide the lost to safety, though he couldn’t say why. <words>147</words>  

A faint whimpering echoed down the tunnel. A child, no older than ten, crouched beside a cluster of glowing mushrooms, her eyes wide with fear. <words>174</words>  

“You’re not supposed to be here,” he muttered, but the petals in his pocket seemed to hum, urging him closer. <words>195</words>  

The child pointed to the wall, where the same cryptic scrawls shimmered faintly. “They said you’d help,” she whispered. <words>216</words>  

His skepticism warred with the weight of the petals, the uncharted grief he’d ignored now surging like a tide. <words>235</words>  

He knelt beside her, his voice steady despite the frantic peace clawing at his chest. “Who’s ‘they’?” <words>253</words>  

She didn’t answer, only pressed a dried petal into his palm—identical to the ones in his collection. <words>271</words>  

The truthfully lying petals had led him here, not by chance, but by design. <words>285</words>  

He exhaled sharply. “Follow me.” <words>291</words>  

The tunnels twisted like a gambler’s luck, but the symbols glowed brighter, guiding them past the impounded spores and into a chamber where others huddled—lost travelers, all clutching petals of their own. <words>331</words>  

The child ran to an older woman, who nodded at him with tear-filled eyes. “You’re the one who reads the signs.” <words>353</words>  

His hands shook. He’d spent years lying to himself, pretending the grief didn’t exist, but here, underground, it had finally found him. <words>380</words>  

Amid the recipe testing and the spores, he’d stumbled into a purpose greater than chance. <words>398</words>  

“This way,” he said, leading them toward a faint light—the exit. <words>412</words>  

The petals in his pocket felt lighter now, as if the uncharted grief had finally been mapped. <words>430</words>  

As the last traveler stepped into the sunlight, the gambler turned back, the frantic peace settling into something quieter, something true. <words>453</words>  

The subway seats would keep scrawling their messages, and he’d keep reading them—no longer a skeptic, but a guide. <words>475</words>  

And the petals? They’d bloom again, in time. <words>485</words>
