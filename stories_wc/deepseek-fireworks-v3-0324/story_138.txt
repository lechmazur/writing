The forgotten noble stood in the spontaneous combustion lab, his fingers tracing the edges of an artificial hummingbird drone, its wings whirring with hollow recklessness. <words>30</words> He had come here to fortify his resolve, to cut through the illusions that had clouded his life for decades. <words>50</words> The lab, a cavern of scorched tables and charred notebooks, smelled of ozone and regret. <words>65</words> Between text messages from creditors and former allies, he worked silently, reassembling old ticket stubs into a fragile map of his past. <words>85</words> Each stub was a fragment of a journey he’d forgotten, mysteriously obvious in its insignificance yet heavy with meaning. <words>105</words>  

The hummingbird drone hovered near his shoulder, its glass eyes reflecting the flickering lab lights. <words>120</words> It had been a gift from a lover long gone, a relic of a time when candor in small moments had felt like enough. <words>140</words> Now, it was just another broken thing he couldn’t fix. <words>148</words> He exhaled, watching the drone’s wings stutter, then steady—a mimicry of life. <words>162</words> The lab’s silence was oppressive, but he preferred it to the noise of a world that had erased him. <words>180</words>  

He pressed a ticket stub into place, the ink faded but the date still legible: the night he’d lost everything. <words>198</words> The drone chirped, a sound too precise to be organic, and he laughed, the sound brittle. <words>215</words> “You remember too, don’t you?” he muttered, though he knew it was just programming. <words>230</words> Still, the candor of the moment—the admission of his own folly—felt like a knife twisting in his chest. <words>250</words>  

Outside, the city hummed with indifference. <words>255</words> He fortified himself with another stub, another memory, each one a brick in the wall he was building against the past. <words>275</words> The drone’s wings blurred, casting jagged shadows on the lab’s walls, and for a second, he saw the outline of his younger self—bold, reckless, doomed. <words>300</words> The illusion shattered as his phone buzzed again, another demand, another reminder of his fall. <words>320</words>  

He ignored it, focusing instead on the hummingbird, its movements a dance of precision and futility. <words>340</words> In its reflection, he glimpsed his own face—weary, but not yet broken. <words>355</words> The lab’s experiments had always ended in fire, but he refused to let that be his fate. <words>375</words> One by one, the ticket stubs formed a path, not to redemption, but to clarity. <words>395</words> The drone settled on his palm, its weightless presence a silent witness to his resolve. <words>415</words>  

Between text messages, between heartbeats, he found what he’d come for: the truth, laid bare in the ashes. <words>435</words> The noble was forgotten, but he would not forget himself. <words>445</words> With a final glance at the hummingbird, he stepped into the light, ready to burn anew. <words>465</words>
