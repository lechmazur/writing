The morning paper landed on the empty porch with a soft thud, its arrival unnoticed by anyone but the coy spy lurking in the shadows of the witch’s potion brewery. <words>30</words>  

His name was Elias, a man of borrowed valor, who wore confidence like a mask but trembled beneath it. <words>45</words> Tonight, he sought to bypass the brewery’s enchanted wards, not through brute force, but through reversed time—a trick he’d learned from a diabolically benevolent witch who’d mended fences with him after a botched betrayal. <words>80</words>  

The loose button on his sleeve snagged against a copper kettle, nearly toppling it. <words>94</words> Elias froze, heart pounding, but the brewery remained silent, save for the bubbling of unnamed liquids. <words>110</words> His motivation was clear: to become a master of disguise, to shed his old self like a snake’s skin. <words>129</words>  

The witch’s ledger lay open, its pages glowing faintly. <words>138</words> Elias traced the incantation for temporal reversal, his fingers trembling. <words>149</words> If he could rewind just minutes, he’d avoid the button’s mishap altogether. <words>163</words> The air shimmered as time folded backward, and suddenly, he stood at the brewery’s entrance again, the loose button now securely fastened. <words>189</words>  

But the witch was waiting. <words>193</words> “Diabolically benevolent,” she mused, her smile sharp. <words>202</words> “You’ve mended fences with time itself, yet you still stumble over your own greed.” <words>220</words> Elias’s borrowed valor faltered. <words>225</words>  

“I just want to disappear,” he admitted. <words>233</words>  

The witch tossed him a vial. <words>238</words> “Then drink. <words>240</words> But remember: every disguise has a cost.” <words>250</words>  

Elias swallowed the potion, and the world dissolved into smoke. <words>263</words> When it cleared, he stood before a mirror—his reflection was no longer his own. <words>280</words> He laughed, but the sound was unfamiliar, borrowed like everything else. <words>296</words>  

Outside, the morning paper landed again, its headlines unchanged. <words>310</words> Elias stepped onto the porch, his new face a perfect mask. <words>323</words> Yet as he walked away, the loose button popped free once more, rolling into the gutter. <words>343</words>  

Some things, it seemed, could never be fully mended. <words>354</words>  

The witch watched from her window, her diabolically benevolent grin widening. <words>370</words> She’d given him what he wanted, but not what he needed. <words>384</words> Elias, the coy spy, would soon learn that mastery of disguise was not the same as mastery of self. <words>407</words>  

And as the sun rose, the brewery’s shadows stretched long, swallowing the loose button—and perhaps, one day, Elias too. <words>433</words>  

The paper’s ink smudged under his boot as he vanished into the dawn, a man of borrowed valor, forever chasing a face that wasn’t his. <words>460</words>  

The witch stirred her cauldron, humming. <words>466</words> Some fences, once broken, could only be patched with lies. <words>478</words> And Elias? <words>480</words> He’d just sewn himself into a tapestry of them. <words>491</words>  

The morning paper fluttered in the wind, its pages blank where his story should have been. <words>510</words>
