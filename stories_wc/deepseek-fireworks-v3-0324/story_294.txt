The dry-tongued bard sat alone in the giant mushroom meeting hall, his fingers tracing the edge of a stained glass prism, its fractured light painting the floor in hues of doubt. <words>30</words> The hush of a dreamless night pressed against the walls, a crisp languor settling over him like a second skin. <words>50</words> He had come here to preserve something—not a song, not a memory, but the forgotten voicemails of a life he could no longer bear. <words>80</words> They whispered to him in the silence, fragments of a self he longed to escape. <words>95</words>  

The prism glowed faintly in his palm, its beauty gorgeously awkward, like a truth too raw to speak aloud. <words>115</words> He lifted it to his lips, as if to drink the light, and felt the cloak of doubt tighten around his shoulders. <words>135</words> It was always there, this weight, this prison of his own making. <words>150</words> The bard sighed, his voice a dry rustle, and began to sing—not for an audience, but for the echoes he hoped would set him free. <words>175</words>  

The mushroom hall trembled, its walls pulsing with the rhythm of his song. <words>190</words> The voicemails surged forward, voices overlapping—a lover’s plea, a friend’s laughter, a stranger’s warning. <words>210</words> He wove them into the melody, each note a stitch in the fabric of his escape. <words>225</words> The prism shattered then, not with a crash, but a sigh, its pieces scattering like stars across the floor. <words>245</words>  

For a moment, the cloak of doubt lifted, and he stood bare beneath the weightless sky of his own making. <words>265</words> But the night was relentless, and the hush returned, thicker now, suffocating. <words>280</words> The bard knelt, gathering the prism’s fragments, their edges sharp against his skin. <words>295</words> He knew then that preservation was not enough—he would have to break, too, to be remade. <words>315</words>  

The hall darkened, the mushroom caps above him curling inward like closing fists. <words>330</words> He pressed a shard to his throat, not to harm, but to feel, to remember he was still alive. <words>350</words> The voicemails faded, replaced by the sound of his own breath, ragged and real. <words>365</words> The cloak of doubt slipped from his shoulders, pooling at his feet like a shadow he no longer needed. <words>385</words>  

When dawn’s first light crept through the cracks, the bard rose, his tongue no longer dry, his heart no longer caged. <words>405</words> The giant mushroom meeting hall stood empty, its silence now a companion, not a jailer. <words>425</words> He stepped into the new day, the prism’s light still dancing in his wake, gorgeously awkward, and utterly his own. <words>450</words>  

The prison of the self had been a dream, after all, and he had woken up. <words>465</words>
