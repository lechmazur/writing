The exorcist trembled as the orbital debris hummed around the derelict station, its metallic groans echoing like a chorus of lost souls. <words>33</words>  

Amid the toy assembly—plastic limbs and gears strewn across the floor—he clutched the pressed wildflowers, their fragile petals a silent rebellion against the void. <words>65</words>  

His stage fright was never usual; it wasn’t fear of failure, but of the inheritance of lies that had shaped him, the whispered falsehoods of his predecessors. <words>98</words>  

The sound of a key turning in the lock sent a shiver through him, a signal as sharp as a blade. <words>120</words>  

He had come to submerge the station’s haunting, to drown the echoes of the past in the defiant hush of his own resolve. <words>145</words>  

The wildflowers were his anchor, a reminder of the earth he’d left behind, of the life he’d once thought impossible. <words>169</words>  

“You don’t belong here,” the voice hissed, slithering from the shadows, a remnant of the station’s tragic history. <words>194</words>  

The exorcist exhaled, his hands steadying as he began the ritual, each movement a sculpture of possibility from the ashes of “never.” <words>220</words>  

The debris outside rattled, a symphony of chaos, but he focused on the wildflowers, their scent a ghost of warmth in the cold metal tomb. <words>247</words>  

The entity lunged, its form a writhing mass of darkness, but he stood firm, his voice rising above the din. <words>270</words>  

“I am not them,” he declared, the words a knife through the lies he’d inherited. <words>287</words>  

The key turned again, unseen, unlocking something deeper—the station’s heart, or perhaps his own. <words>307</words>  

With a final incantation, he submerged the entity, not in water, but in the weight of truth, the defiance of silence. <words>331</words>  

The wildflowers crumbled in his grip, their purpose fulfilled, their beauty a fleeting testament to resilience. <words>352</words>  

The station shuddered, then stilled, the orbital debris now just debris, no longer haunted. <words>371</words>  

Amid the toy parts, he knelt, gathering the fragments of what had been, what could be. <words>390</words>  

His stage fright was gone, replaced by a quiet certainty: the future was his to shape, no longer bound by the past. <words>414</words>  

The key turned one last time, and the exorcist stepped into the light, leaving the inheritance of lies behind. <words>436</words>  

In the defiant hush of space, he smiled, ready to sculpt a new possibility. <words>453</words>  

The wildflowers were gone, but their memory lingered, a promise of life amid the void. <words>472</words>  

And so, the exorcist walked on, unshaken, his heart a lock turned open at last. <words>491</words>
