The vapor collection facility hummed with the quiet pulse of machinery, its steel veins calcifying under the weight of years. <words>24</words>  
Inside, Elias Thorn, a professional dream interpreter, clutched a crumpled invitation, its edges frayed like forgotten prophecies. <words>45</words>  
It had arrived occasionally frequent, slipping under his door every third midnight, unsigned but unmistakable in its demand. <words>67</words>  
Now, during baking—when the facility’s heat reached its peak—he stood before a rusted door, his breath shallow with peculiar faith. <words>90</words>  
The invitation had promised answers, but Elias sought more: to rewrite laws carved in stone, the ones that bound dreams to silence. <words>115</words>  
He stepped inside, the air thick with condensation, and saw her—the missing person he’d been hired to find. <words>135</words>  
Or rather, the one he’d been impersonating for weeks, weaving her identity into his own like a second skin. <words>154</words>  
“You’re late,” a voice echoed, and Elias turned to face the facility’s overseer, a figure shrouded in steam. <words>176</words>  
The overseer’s eyes gleamed with knowing, as if they’d watched Elias calcify into his role, layer by brittle layer. <words>198</words>  
“I’ve come to understand the dreams,” Elias lied, his voice steady despite the quiet pulse of the machines quickening around him. <words>222</words>  
The overseer smiled, revealing teeth like chiseled stone. “Dreams are laws here. You don’t interpret them—you obey.” <words>244</words>  
Elias tightened his grip on the invitation, its paper whispering against his palm. “Then I’ll rewrite them.” <words>264</words>  
The overseer laughed, a sound like grinding gears, and gestured to a vast chamber where vapor condensed into fleeting visions. <words>288</words>  
“Try,” they dared, and Elias stepped forward, his heart pounding with peculiar faith. <words>305</words>  
He’d spent years deciphering the dreams of others, but now, impersonating the missing woman, he saw the truth: the facility wasn’t collecting vapor—it was harvesting dreams. <words>336</words>  
And the laws carved in stone? They were the dreams of the vanished, calcified into unbreakable rules. <words>356</words>  
Elias reached into the mist, his fingers brushing a vision of the woman he’d replaced. Her dream was simple: escape. <words>379</words>  
But the overseer’s hand clamped his shoulder. “You can’t rewrite what’s already set.” <words>397</words>  
Elias grinned, the invitation crumpling in his fist. “Watch me.” <words>408</words>  
The machines stuttered, their quiet pulse faltering as Elias tore the dream from the vapor, rewriting it with his own. <words>431</words>  
The facility shuddered, its stone laws cracking like old bones, and for the first time in years, the air tasted of freedom. <words>454</words>  
The overseer’s scream was lost in the steam as Elias walked away, the invitation now ash in his wake. <words>476</words>
