The assassin lurked in the shadows of the baroque asteroid’s docking bay, his breath steady, his purpose clear. <words>25</words> The unforgiving road of his life had led him here, to this moment, where borrowed starlight glinted off the paint-splattered camera lens dangling from his belt—a relic of a past he could no longer remember. <words>56</words> He had been told the lens was superficially profound, a tool to capture truth, though he suspected it only distorted it further. <words>80</words>  

When the bus driver completed the final route, the asteroid’s artificial night would fall, and the assassin would strike. <words>100</words> His target: a man who claimed to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, a poet who spoke of hope in a place where hope was a currency long devalued. <words>128</words> The assassin didn’t care for poetry, but he cared for patterns—like the delicate strands of a spider’s web after rain, glistening with trapped light. <words>154</words>  

He laughed then, a sound as hollow as the asteroid’s echoing corridors. <words>166</words> It was funny, he thought, how the universe wove its designs, how it entangled him in a web not of his making. <words>186</words> The poet’s words were just another thread, another illusion. <words>196</words>  

The bus hissed to a stop, its doors sliding open with a sigh. <words>206</words> The assassin adjusted the lens, its splatters of paint like dried blood in the dim light. <words>222</words> He could see the poet now, stepping onto the platform, his hands raised as if to greet the nonexistent sun. <words>242</words> The assassin’s fingers twitched toward his blade, but something stayed him—a flicker of doubt, or perhaps the way the poet’s trembling fingers mirrored his own. <words>270</words>  

“You’re here to kill me,” the poet said, his voice soft, as if he’d known all along. <words>287</words> The assassin didn’t answer. <words>290</words> He’d learned long ago that words were just another kind of trap. <words>303</words>  

“I’ve seen you in my dreams,” the poet continued, his eyes reflecting the borrowed starlight. <words>321</words> “Lurking in the shadows, a ghost with a camera.” <words>331</words>  

The assassin tightened his grip on the lens. <words>339</words> It was just a tool, just a thing—but it felt heavier now, as if it carried the weight of every life he’d taken. <words>361</words>  

The poet smiled. <words>363</words> “You don’t have to do this.” <words>369</words>  

The assassin hesitated. <words>372</words> The unforgiving road had never offered him a choice before. <words>385</words> But here, under the fragile glow of the asteroid’s artificial sky, he wondered if there might be another path. <words>407</words>  

He lowered the lens. <words>410</words> The poet’s trembling hands reached out, not to defend, but to cradle—not the dawn, but the assassin’s own. <words>430</words>  

And for the first time in years, the assassin didn’t feel like a ghost. <words>445</words> He felt like a man, standing at the edge of a web, unsure whether to break free or be consumed. <words>467</words>  

The bus driver’s final route was complete. <words>475</words> The asteroid’s night fell. <words>480</words> And the assassin, for once, did not strike. <words>490</words>
