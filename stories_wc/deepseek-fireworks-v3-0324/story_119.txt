The air smelled of rust and old popcorn as Elias balanced on the abandoned roller coaster track, his bare feet gripping the sun-warmed metal. <words>27</words> He had fled here, not out of fear, but by tracking sun shadows—a trick his grandmother had taught him to disappear without a trace. <words>52</words> The antique brass key in his pocket hummed faintly, a reminder of the door he’d unlocked seconds ago, the one that revealed his true nature: a secret astral projector. <words>85</words> The revelation had struck like lightning, and now, in the seconds following it, he understood why survival had always been his unyielding compassion. <words>114</words>  

The carnival around him was a graveyard of laughter, its colors faded, its Ferris wheel creaking in the wind. <words>138</words> Elias clenched the key tighter, its teeth biting into his palm. <words>152</words> He’d practiced spontaneity for years, pretending to be ordinary, but now the truth was out—at least to him. <words>176</words> His motivation was clear: to preserve the survival skills that had kept him alive, the ones that sometimes always felt like a curse. <words>203</words>  

A shadow flickered at the edge of his vision. <words>209</words> They were coming—the ones who’d hunt him for what he could do. <words>224</words> Elias closed his eyes and let his spirit rise, his body remaining perfectly still on the track. <words>242</words> Astral projection was his gift, but it was also a beacon. <words>254</words> He could see them now, their auras pulsing like distant stars, closing in. <words>271</words>  

He had to move. <words>274</words> With a practiced breath, Elias snapped back into his body and leapt onto the next support beam, his muscles remembering every escape route he’d ever mapped. <words>305</words> The key’s hum grew louder, as if urging him forward. <words>319</words> He wondered what door it would open next—or close behind him forever. <words>336</words>  

The wind carried the scent of rain, and Elias grinned. <words>347</words> He’d always loved storms; they masked his tracks. <words>358</words> His unyielding compassion wasn’t just for himself—it was for the others like him, the ones who didn’t know they were being hunted. <words>385</words> He’d find them, teach them, even if it meant running forever. <words>400</words>  

A shout echoed through the carnival, and Elias dropped to the ground, rolling behind a broken ticket booth. <words>422</words> The key burned in his pocket, a silent promise. <words>433</words> He’d flee again, but not yet. <words>441</words> First, he’d leave a trail only they could follow—sun shadows leading to safety. <words>459</words>  

Elias stood, brushed the dust from his clothes, and stepped into the light. <words>474</words> The game was far from over, and he was just getting started. <words>488</words>  

The roller coaster groaned behind him, a ghost of its former self, as Elias vanished into the glare of the setting sun. <words>513</words>
