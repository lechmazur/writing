The astute hermit sighed as he examined the blunt scissors in his hand, their edges dulled by years of futile attempts to trim the phosphorescent vines creeping across the cavern cathedral’s walls. <words>30</words>  

“Strangely effective,” he muttered, though not for cutting—the scissors were perfect for prying open the rusted panels of the ancient water system he’d sworn to restore. <words>60</words>  

Isolation had sharpened his ingenuity, if not his tools. The cavern, alive with glowing flora, was both sanctuary and prison, its beauty a cruel joke when the pipes groaned dry. <words>90</words>  

At the moment the elevator across the chasm shuddered to a stop on an empty floor, the hermit’s stomach growled. The scent of a fresh loaf of bread—impossible here—drifted through the air. <words>120</words>  

“Hallucinations,” he scoffed, but the smell persisted, amplifying his hunger and his despairing humor. “Of course. The universe mocks me with baked goods.” <words>150</words>  

Yet the scent led him to a fissure in the rock, where steam rose from a hidden geothermal vent. His mind raced: if he could redirect the heat, he might amplify the cavern’s natural warmth to thaw the frozen pipes. <words>190</words>  

The scissors clanked against the vent cover as he pried it loose, his hands trembling. Years alone had taught him to trust nothing, especially not hope. <words>220</words>  

But the bread smell lingered, a ghost of comfort. He laughed, a dry, cracked sound. “Fine. I’ll play along.” <words>240</words>  

With the vent open, heat surged upward, curling around the vines until their glow intensified, casting eerie shadows on the cathedral’s arches. The hermit wiped sweat from his brow and turned to the water pump, scissors in hand. <words>280</words>  

One stubborn bolt resisted. He wedged the scissors’ blunt tip into the groove and twisted. Metal screeched, then gave way. <words>300</words>  

Water gushed forth, splashing his face. He tasted salt—or maybe tears. The elevator across the chasm dinged, as if applauding. <words>320</words>  

“Oh, now you show up,” he called, but the joke fell flat. The cavern’s silence swallowed it whole. <words>340</words>  

Still, the water flowed. The bread scent faded, leaving only the damp earth and his own exhaustion. He slumped against the pump, scissors still clutched in his grip. <words>370</words>  

Isolation had carved him into a man who could fix a broken world with broken tools, but who would never hear a “thank you.” The thought made him chuckle, though it hurt. <words>400</words>  

Outside, the phosphorescent vines pulsed softly, their light strangely effective against the dark. The hermit closed his eyes, and for the first time in years, he didn’t feel alone. <words>430</words>  

The elevator doors slid shut with a whisper, leaving him to his work—and his quiet, stubborn victory. <words>450</words>
