The skeptical minstrel, Jorik, plucked a sour note on his lute as he stared at the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, its rusted hinges creaking in the wind. <words>28</words> He’d been promised a fortune for this job, but the disappearing ink factory looming behind him smelled more of betrayal than opportunity. <words>53</words> Still, he needed the coin, and the dragon-scale armor scrap tucked in his pocket—a relic from a bard’s tall tale—was his only leverage against the immortal trickster who’d lured him here. <words>86</words>  

The factory’s broken windows exhaled the hiss of an ancient steam vent, a sound like a serpent’s laughter. <words>107</words> Jorik smirked. "Impossibly plausible," he muttered, recalling the trickster’s boast that the vent could launch a slingshot straight to the moon. <words>132</words> Reckless generosity had led him here, but out-scheming an immortal? That required finesse. <words>149</words>  

He adjusted the slingshot in his belt, its leather worn from years of dubious decisions. <words>165</words> The trickster’s voice echoed from the shadows: "You’re late, songbird. The ink’s already vanishing." <words>184</words> Jorik tossed the dragon-scale scrap into the steam vent, and the factory shuddered as the vent roared to life, its gears groaning with irreverent awe. <words>210</words>  

The scrap shot out like a comet, ricocheting off the walls before embedding itself in the trickster’s throne of lies. <words>231</words> "Clever," the trickster admitted, materializing from the steam, his grin sharper than a minstrel’s wit. <words>249</words> "But cleverness won’t save you from the deal you struck." <words>261</words>  

Jorik strummed a dissonant chord. "Ah, but you forgot—disappearing ink fades, and so do promises written in it." <words>283</words> He’d read the contract’s fine print by candlelight, watching the words evaporate like the factory’s namesake. <words>302</words> The trickster’s eyes narrowed, then widened as Jorik fired the slingshot—not at him, but at the mailbox, triggering a hidden mechanism that flooded the factory with steam. <words>333</words>  

The world dissolved into white, and when it cleared, Jorik stood alone, the trickster’s laughter fading into the wind. <words>353</words> The dragon-scale scrap glinted at his feet, now etched with new runes—a map to somewhere impossibly plausible. <words>374</words> He pocketed it, humming a tune of reckless generosity and narrow escapes. <words>390</words>  

The factory groaned its last breath as Jorik walked away, the midday sun painting his shadow long and sly. <words>411</words> He’d out-schemed an immortal, but the real trick was surviving the aftermath. <words>427</words> With a wink at the empty mailbox, he whispered, "Next time, send a better contract." <words>443</words> The wind carried his irreverent awe into the sky, where even the trickster might hear it—and smile. <words>463</words>  

Jorik’s lute found a brighter note this time, a melody for fools and legends alike. <words>479</words> After all, what was a minstrel’s tale without a little dragon-scale magic? <words>495</words> He vanished down the road, leaving only the echo of steam and the scent of ink that never was. <words>515</words>
