The drone pilot woke to the scent of charred wood and the weight of unfamiliar armor, his head throbbing as if the medieval fantasy realm had dropped directly onto his skull. <words>38</words> Around him, the abandoned observatory loomed, its cracked dome framing a sky streaked with the last hues of dusk—horizons of mercy, he thought bitterly, though mercy felt as distant as the control panel of his lost drone. <words>78</words> He clutched the dried herb bundle in his pocket, a relic from his world, its earthy scent the only tether to a life that now seemed like a dream. <words>108</words>  

Outside, the hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down settled like a shroud, the air thick with the tension of impending loss. <words>134</words> He’d stumbled upon a speed dating event in the nearby village, of all things, where hopeful faces masked desperation, and he’d tried to disseminate fragments of his old world—maps, schematics, anything to lure possibility from the brink of despair. <words>176</words> But the villagers had laughed, their cynically hopeful eyes dismissing him as another madman. <words>193</words>  

Now, atop the cliff, he watched the first axes rise against the gnarled orchard trees, their branches heavy with unripe fruit. <words>216</words> The drone pilot sighed, rubbing the herbs between his fingers, their fragrance mingling with the smoke of distant fires. <words>236</words> He’d once commanded skies; now he was grounded, a stranger in a land where mercy was as scarce as fuel for his machine. <words>258</words>  

A figure emerged from the shadows—a woman with eyes like smoldering embers, her cloak dusted with ash. <words>278</words> “You’re the one who speaks of flying metal birds,” she said, her voice a whisper of charred serenity. <words>297</words> He nodded, wary but intrigued. <words>302</words> She gestured to the herbs. “Those are from beyond the veil. They could save us.” <words>322</words>  

The pilot hesitated, then offered the bundle. <words>330</words> “What’s your plan?” he asked, the cynically hopeful part of him stirring. <words>343</words> She smiled, gripping the herbs like a lifeline. “The orchard’s roots run deep. With these, we can heal the land—or at least try.” <words>370</words>  

As the axes fell, the two worked swiftly, burying the herbs at the base of the oldest tree. <words>392</words> The air hummed, a faint glow spreading through the roots. <words>406</words> The villagers paused, their blades hovering mid-swing. <words>417</words> For a moment, the horizon of mercy seemed to widen, and the pilot felt something he’d forgotten—hope, fragile but alive. <words>442</words>  

The woman turned to him, her gaze fierce. “Stay,” she said. “Help us rebuild.” <words>458</words> He looked at the sky, then at the smoldering world below, and nodded. <words>473</words> Maybe, just maybe, he could fly again—in a different way. <words>486</words>  

The orchard breathed, and the hush lifted, replaced by the sound of something new. <words>500</words>
