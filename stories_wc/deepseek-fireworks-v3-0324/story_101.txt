The welcoming landlord adjusted the framed Napoleonic bee pin on the studio wall, its gold plating chipped by time, its symbolism cryptically obvious to those who knew where to look. <words>28</words> Outside, a parade’s cacophony forced a detour, the studio’s usual quiet shattered by trumpets and shuffling feet. <words>49</words> Inside, the landlord’s hands trembled as they traced the pin’s weathered edges, their heart just as worn. <words>67</words> "Before the first being learned to record its experiences," they muttered, "we feared endings more than beginnings." <words>86</words>  

The room, a design studio cluttered with half-finished sketches, seemed to pulse with manic clarity. <words>100</words> The landlord’s laughter was too bright, their movements too sharp, as if they could outrun the dread coiled in their chest. <words>119</words> They snatched a pencil, scribbling over a discarded draft—a failed attempt to adapt a tragedy into something bearable. <words>138</words> "What if we reimagined the endings we fear?" they asked the empty room, their voice fraying at the edges. <words>156</words>  

The parade outside reached a crescendo, drums throbbing like a second heartbeat. <words>168</words> The landlord’s gaze flicked to the bee pin again, its wings spread mid-flight, forever suspended. <words>183</words> Napoleon’s emblem, a symbol of relentless ambition, now hung in a room where ambition had curdled into desperation. <words>200</words> They wondered if the emperor, too, had ever felt this unraveling, this need to rewrite fate. <words>217</words>  

A knock at the door—a tenant, eyes wide with concern. <words>226</words> "You’ve been in here for hours," they said. <words>233</words> The landlord smiled, too wide, too quick. <words>240</words> "Just working," they replied, shoving the sketches aside. <words>249</words> But the tenant saw the bee pin, the frantic lines on paper, the way the landlord’s fingers tapped an uneven rhythm against the desk. <words>270</words> "You don’t have to do this alone," they offered softly. <words>281</words>  

The landlord’s breath hitched. <words>284</words> Adapt, they told themselves. <words>286</words> Not everything had to end in silence or screaming. <words>295</words> Maybe some stories could bend, could blur, could become something new. <words>307</words> They picked up the bee pin, its weight familiar, and pressed it into the tenant’s palm. <words>322</words> "Hold onto this for me," they said, voice steadier now. <words>333</words> "I think I’m ready to try a different ending." <words>343</words>  

Outside, the parade faded, leaving only the echo of its joy. <words>355</words> The studio, once stifling, felt lighter, as if the walls themselves had exhaled. <words>369</words> The tenant studied the pin, then the landlord’s face—no longer manic, just clear. <words>385</words> "Where do we start?" they asked. <words>391</words>  

The landlord grinned, this time real, and reached for a fresh sheet of paper. <words>405</words> "We start," they said, "by letting go of the endings we never wanted." <words>419</words> And for the first time in years, their heart didn’t feel quite so weathered. <words>433</words>  

The quiet room hummed with possibility, the detour now a path forward. <words>446</words> Somewhere, before history began, a being hesitated—then chose to begin anyway. <words>461</words> The landlord picked up the pencil, and together, they began to rewrite. <words>474</words>
