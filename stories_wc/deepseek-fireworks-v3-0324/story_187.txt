The stoic wanderer stepped onto the witch's familiar training ground, his boots sinking into the damp earth as the last remnants of a chalked formula vanished beneath a teacher’s sleeve. <words>30</words>  

He carried a floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its grain worn smooth by time, a relic of necessary lies whispered between its cracks. <words>52</words>  

The air was mesmerizingly bland, a dull hum of forgotten spells and half-remembered rituals, yet it imposed a weight on his chest, as if the ground itself demanded his purpose. <words>83</words>  

He had come to archive ritual practices, to steal secrets before they faded, but the trail he followed was not of ink or parchment—it was of nightmares, vivid and clawing. <words>113</words>  

The teacher, a woman with eyes like smudged charcoal, turned to him with brash tenderness. "You’re late," she said, her voice a blade wrapped in velvet. <words>140</words>  

The wanderer said nothing, his silence a language of its own. He laid the floorboard at her feet, its surface etched with symbols only the desperate would recognize. <words>168</words>  

She knelt, tracing the grooves with a fingertip. "This was mine once," she murmured. "Before the lies became necessary." <words>190</words>  

The wanderer’s jaw tightened. He had no use for nostalgia, only for the truth buried beneath it. "Teach me," he said, the words rough as splintered wood. <words>217</words>  

The teacher laughed, a sound like dry leaves scattering. "You don’t want lessons. You want absolution." <words>235</words>  

Around them, the training ground pulsed, a living thing feeding on the echoes of failed familiars. The wanderer ignored it. He had seen worse in his dreams. <words>263</words>  

"Fine," she sighed. "But remember: to archive is to impose. You’ll carry more than words." <words>282</words>  

He nodded, already feeling the weight of it—the nightmares, the lies, the cost of knowing. <words>298</words>  

She pressed her palm to the floorboard, and the symbols ignited, casting shadows that twisted like living things. The wanderer watched, unflinching, as the ground beneath him whispered secrets in a tongue he almost understood. <words>340</words>  

When it was over, the teacher wiped her hands on her robes, the last traces of magic clinging to her skin like dust. "Go," she said. "Before the nightmares follow you back." <words>372</words>  

The wanderer took the floorboard, now heavy with more than memory, and turned away. Behind him, the training ground sighed, its lessons learned, its price paid. <words>400</words>  

He walked into the gathering dusk, the weight of necessary lies settling into his bones, a burden he would carry until the next ritual, the next truth, the next night. <words>430</words>  

And the nightmares, patient as always, followed. <words>437</words>
