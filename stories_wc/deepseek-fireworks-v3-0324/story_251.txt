The ambivalent prophet stood in the dim glow of the lunar mining colony’s flickering lights, clutching a cracked collection of marbles, each one whispering secrets of futures that might have been. <words>30</words>  

"Time is a jigsaw," he muttered with bashful arrogance, his fingers tracing the edges of puzzle pieces he’d salvaged from a rummage sale box—fragments of a cosmic design only he could see. <words>60</words>  

Between heartbeats, the colony’s hum faded, and the prophet defragmented the chaos, aligning the pieces with a happily sad smile, as if mourning what he was about to undo. <words>90</words>  

The final oath weighed heavy, a vow to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, to rewrite the rules etched in stardust. <words>110</words>  

Around him, miners toiled unaware, their lives tethered to the moon’s barren rock, while he danced on the edge of revelation. <words>130</words>  

One marble rolled from his grasp, its crack splitting further, releasing a sigh of forgotten light. <words>150</words>  

He knelt, pressing a puzzle piece against the fracture, and the colony shuddered—a silent gasp from the universe itself. <words>170</words>  

"Did you feel that?" a miner asked, but the prophet was already gone, slipping between seconds. <words>190</words>  

In the shadows, he reassembled the fragments, each connection a defiance of fate, a thumb pressed against the scales of destiny. <words>210</words>  

The marbles pulsed in his palm, their cracks now veins of possibility, bleeding into the puzzle’s gaps. <words>230</words>  

He laughed, a sound both triumphant and broken, as the colony’s lights flickered in time with his heartbeat. <words>250</words>  

"Almost there," he whispered, though no one listened. <words>260</words>  

The final piece hovered above his palm, a jagged edge of something greater, and he hesitated—not out of doubt, but reverence. <words>280</words>  

With a breath, he slotted it home, and the world unraveled. <words>290</words>  

The miners froze mid-step, their shadows stretching into infinity as the prophet’s oath echoed through the void. <words>310</words>  

The cosmic scoreboard flickered, numbers scrambling, histories rewriting themselves in frantic strokes. <words>330</words>  

He watched, happily sad, as the marbles dissolved into starlight, their cracks now seams of a new design. <words>350</words>  

The colony trembled, its foundations groaning under the weight of his defiance. <words>370</words>  

Then, silence. <words>371</words>  

The prophet stood alone, the puzzle complete, the oath fulfilled. <words>380</words>  

The miners resumed their work, unaware of the shift, their lives untouched by the chaos he’d woven into order. <words>400</words>  

And the prophet? He vanished, a whisper between heartbeats, his arrogance and bashfulness dissolving into the lunar dust. <words>420</words>  

Only the cracked marbles remained, scattered like forgotten stars, their secrets buried once more. <words>440</words>  

The scoreboard had been scrambled, the final oath kept, and the prophet—now just a memory—smiled somewhere beyond time. <words>460</words>  

The colony hummed on, oblivious, as the universe adjusted to its new, fragile balance. <words>480</words>  

And in the quiet, between one heartbeat and the next, the marbles gleamed, waiting for the next hand bold enough to defy the stars. <words>500</words>
