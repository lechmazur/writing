The atom-powered lighthouse stood sentinel in the hush of a line that never moves, its beam cutting through the borrowed dawn like a blade through silk. <words>30</words>  

Inside, the time refugee from a forgotten empire traced the frayed edges of an embroidered tablecloth, her fingers lingering over threads that whispered of a world swallowed by centuries. <words>60</words> She had come here by the alignment of the stars, a journey not of distance but of desperation, her quiet defiance a shield against the weight of eras. <words>90</words>  

The lighthouse keeper, a man of trustworthy strange, watched her from the shadows, his eyes reflecting the glow of the atomic core. "You’re not here for the light," he said, his voice a rumble of gears. <words>130</words>  

"No," she admitted, folding the tablecloth with care. "I’m here to bind old wounds with unstoppable will." The words hung between them, heavy as the silence outside. <words>160</words>  

He nodded, as if he’d expected nothing less. "The stars aligned for a reason. But what do you need from me?" <words>185</words>  

She pointed to the catapult rusting on the cliff below, its weathered frame a relic of wars long past. "That," she said. "And your silence." <words>210</words>  

The keeper chuckled, a sound like grinding stone. "Silence is the one thing this place has in abundance." <words>230</words>  

Under the borrowed dawn, they worked, heaving the catapult into position, its creaking limbs protesting like a beast roused from slumber. <words>255</words> The refugee spread the embroidered tablecloth over its basket, the intricate patterns glowing faintly in the atomic light. <words>280</words>  

"You’re sending it back," the keeper realized, his voice tinged with awe. <words>295</words>  

"To where it belongs," she replied, her quiet defiance hardening into resolve. "To the empire that forgot it." <words>315</words>  

With a final adjustment, she stepped back, and the catapult groaned as it launched the tablecloth into the sky, a fleeting banner against the dawn. <words>345</words> The stars above shimmered in approval, their alignment perfect, their judgment absolute. <words>365</words>  

The keeper watched it vanish into the horizon, then turned to her. "Will it be enough?" <words>385</words>  

She smiled, a rare and fleeting thing. "It has to be." <words>400</words>  

In the hush of a line that never moves, the atom-powered lighthouse hummed its eternal song, its beam now touching something beyond the sea, beyond time. <words>430</words> The refugee stood at the edge, her mission complete, her quiet defiance echoing in the borrowed dawn. <words>450</words>  

The keeper joined her, his presence a silent promise. "What now?" he asked. <words>465</words>  

She looked to the stars, her voice barely a whisper. "We wait." <words>480</words>  

And so they did, two souls bound by trust and strangeness, their wills unstoppable, their wounds beginning to heal. <words>505</words> The lighthouse watched over them, its light a beacon for all that was lost—and all that might yet be found. <words>530</words>
