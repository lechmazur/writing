The cheerless duelist stood amid the hum of server rooms in the abandoned spaceport customs office, his fingers tracing the maggoty wooden chest that rattled with each step. <words>35</words>  

He had come seeking answers, not treasure, but the chest—precisely innovative in its construction—seemed to mock his fatal flaws: pride, vengeance, and an inability to let go. <words>72</words>  

The duelist had once been a chef, his family’s recipes passed down through generations, but war had forced him to elasticize his morals, twisting those recipes into weapons. <words>105</words>  

Now, amid the flickering lights of dead terminals, he pried open the chest, revealing not gold, but a single, weathered cookbook—its pages filled with unexpected mutations of family recipes, each altered to heal rather than harm. <words>148</words>  

His hands trembled. These were his own creations, perverted by time or perhaps by his estranged sister, the one he’d sworn to kill for betraying him. <words>178</words>  

The server rooms buzzed louder, as if amplifying his turmoil. He had come to learn the power of forgiveness, but the bitterness of old wounds made it taste like ash. <words>210</words>  

A hologram flickered to life—his sister’s face, gaunt and weary. "I rewrote them," she said, her voice echoing through the empty office. "I thought you might return." <words>242</words>  

The duelist’s grip tightened on the cookbook. "You left me to die," he spat, but the accusation felt hollow now, drowned in the bittersweet reckoning of years wasted. <words>274</words>  

"I saved you," she whispered. "The recipes were poison. You were poisoning yourself." The hologram glitched, her image fracturing like his resolve. <words>303</words>  

The chest rattled again, not from movement, but from the maggots inside—transformed, he realized, into delicate silvery worms that spun threads as strong as steel. <words>333</words>  

His sister had always been precisely innovative, even in her betrayal. He’d called it treachery, but perhaps it was mercy. <words>356</words>  

The duelist sank to his knees, the cookbook open to a recipe for reconciliation—a dish he’d never dared to make. The server rooms hummed their approval. <words>385</words>  

Outside, the spaceport groaned under the weight of forgotten ships, but here, in this derelict office, something new stirred. He could elasticize his heart, stretch it wide enough to hold both the love and the hurt. <words>425</words>  

The hologram faded, leaving only the maggoty chest and the cookbook. He closed his eyes, tasting the ghost of a meal he’d once shared with her—sweet, sour, and utterly irreplaceable. <words>460</words>  

Forgiveness, he realized, was not an end, but a beginning. And for the first time in years, the cheerless duelist smiled. <words>482</words>
