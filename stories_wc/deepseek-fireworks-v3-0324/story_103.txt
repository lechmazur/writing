The weatherbeaten knight stood before the brass door knocker, its surface tarnished by salt and time, shaped like a lion’s snarling face. <words>28</words> He hesitated, knowing the choice ahead was impossible: enter the lighthouse prison off the jagged reef or turn back, leaving the past to fester. <words>54</words> The wind howled, carrying the grudgingly sweet scent of decaying roses, a reminder of what he’d lost—and what he might still save. <words>80</words> With a deep breath, he lifted the knocker, its weight familiar, and let it fall. <words>94</words>  

The door creaked open, revealing a corridor lined with seemingly random items: a broken compass, a child’s doll, a rusted key. <words>118</words> Yet as he stepped forward, he began to appreciate the pattern—each object a fragment of his own regrets, arranged like a map to his undoing. <words>144</words> The lighthouse’s interior was a mirrored reflection of his soul, warped and fractured, yet undeniably his. <words>163</words> Somewhere within, the final cry of regret echoed, a sound he’d sworn to hush. <words>179</words>  

His armor clanked as he climbed the spiral stairs, each step a joyful agony, for he knew this torment was deserved. <words>200</words> The higher he rose, the louder the cry grew, until he reached the top chamber, where a single mirror awaited. <words>222</words> In its surface, he saw not his own face, but hers—the one he’d failed, the one whose voice now haunted him. <words>245</words> “Forgive me,” he whispered, but the reflection shook its head, lips moving in silent accusation. <words>264</words>  

The knight knelt, tears mixing with the salt on his cheeks, and laid his sword at the mirror’s base. <words>283</words> It was then he noticed the items from below had followed him, forming a circle around the glass. <words>302</words> The broken compass pointed nowhere, the doll’s eyes were hollow, the key fit no lock—yet together, they were a confession. <words>327</words> He had come to silence regret, but now he understood: some cries were meant to be heard. <words>348</words>  

With a shuddering breath, he reached out, touching the mirror. <words>358</words> The glass rippled, and for a moment, he felt her hand in his, warm and alive. <words>375</words> Then the lighthouse trembled, the sea roaring below, and the knight made his choice. <words>392</words> He would carry the cry with him, let it shape his steps, until the weight became a part of him. <words>413</words> The brass knocker clanged shut behind as he emerged into the storm, no longer a prisoner of the lighthouse, but of his own reckoning. <words>440</words> The jagged reef gleamed in the distance, and for the first time in years, he smiled—bitter, broken, but free. <words>461</words>
