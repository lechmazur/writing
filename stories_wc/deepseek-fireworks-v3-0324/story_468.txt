The overly curious mortician, Elias, adjusted his spectacles as he waded through the mangrove labyrinth, his boots sinking into the damp earth with a squelch. <words>34</words>  

Around him, the singing spirits hummed a melody that was loudly serene, their voices weaving through the tangled roots like whispers of the wind. <words>62</words>  

His fingers brushed against the tarnished silver bracelet in his pocket, its engravings worn smooth by time—a relic he’d found clutched in the hand of a corpse with no name. <words>93</words>  

Elias had come to this place when the night yielded to golden embers, driven by his obsession to collect dream journals, those fragile records of the unconscious minds of the dead. <words>125</words>  

The rustle of revelation came not from the spirits but from the mud beneath his feet, where footprints appeared and vanished after a single heartbeat, as if the labyrinth itself was trying to imitate his path. <words>162</words>  

He paused, heart racing, as the spirits’ song shifted into a chorus of polite anarchy, their tones both mocking and inviting. <words>184</words>  

“Who walks here?” Elias called, his voice swallowed by the thick air. <words>195</words>  

A figure emerged from the shadows, its form flickering like a half-remembered dream. It wore a face Elias recognized—the corpse from his slab, the one with the bracelet. <words>228</words>  

“You took what wasn’t yours,” the spirit whispered, its voice like leaves scraping stone. <words>244</words>  

Elias clutched the bracelet tighter. “I only seek to understand,” he replied, his curiosity outweighing his fear. <words>263</words>  

The spirit laughed, a sound like cracking ice. “Then follow.” It turned, its footprints appearing and disappearing in the mud, leading deeper into the labyrinth. <words>294</words>  

Elias obeyed, his mind alight with questions. The dream journals he’d collected spoke of this place, of spirits who traded secrets for memories. <words>319</words>  

The path twisted, the mangroves closing in until the sky was a sliver of gold. The spirit stopped before a hollow tree, its bark etched with symbols. <words>347</words>  

“Your curiosity is a key,” it said. “But the price is a dream.” <words>361</words>  

Elias hesitated, then reached into his coat and pulled out a journal—his own, filled with his restless nights. <words>380</words>  

The spirit took it, its fingers brushing the bracelet. “This belonged to a thief,” it murmured. “But you are worse. You steal from the dead to feed your living mind.” <words>415</words>  

Before Elias could protest, the mangrove roots writhed, wrapping around his ankles. The spirits’ song rose, a cacophony of polite anarchy, as the labyrinth swallowed him whole. <words>447</words>  

When the dawn came, the mangroves stood silent. Only the tarnished bracelet remained, gleaming faintly in the mud, its secrets kept. <words>470</words>  

And somewhere, in the space between heartbeats, Elias’s footprints vanished, as if he had never been there at all. <words>494</words>  

The singing spirits hummed on, their melody a rustle of revelation for the next curious soul who dared to listen. <words>516</words>
