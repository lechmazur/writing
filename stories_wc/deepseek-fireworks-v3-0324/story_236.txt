The meek blacksmith, Elias, clutched the softcover dictionary to his chest as he stepped into the underwater city planning office, its walls shimmering with bioluminescent algae. <words>30</words>  

He had come to fulfill the unfinished bargain, one whispered to him by a hitchhiker whose half-baked stories he’d painstakingly verified across the hush of time’s final ripple. <words>60</words>  

The office was a place of luminous regret, where blueprints of drowned civilizations floated in glass tanks, openly hidden from those who lacked the patience to look. <words>90</words>  

Elias traced a finger over the dictionary’s frayed edges, its pages heavy with words he’d once used to mend broken things—now, he sought to ignite something far greater. <words>120</words>  

The hitchhiker had spoken of harnessing heartbreak as fuel, of forging not metal but memory, and Elias, weary of his anvil’s silence, had listened. <words>150</words>  

He unfolded a map on the desk, its ink bleeding into the damp air, and pressed the dictionary open to a page where “loss” and “love” intertwined. <words>180</words>  

A clerk, her eyes like polished coral, watched him. “You’re here for the bargain,” she said, not a question. Elias nodded, his voice a whisper. “I’ve come to pay my debt.” <words>210</words>  

She led him to a chamber where the walls pulsed with a slow, rhythmic light, and in its center stood a forge unlike any he’d seen—its flames blue as drowned sapphires. <words>240</words>  

“Stoke it,” she instructed. Elias hesitated, then tore a page from the dictionary and fed it to the fire. The flames roared, not with heat, but with the echoes of a thousand unspoken goodbyes. <words>280</words>  

The clerk smiled sadly. “Each word you burn becomes a brick in the city’s foundation. But the bargain demands more—your heartbreak, not just your words.” <words>310</words>  

Elias closed his eyes, recalling the weight of his wife’s absence, the way her laughter had once filled his workshop. He let the memory flow into the flames, and the forge blazed brighter. <words>350</words>  

The chamber trembled as the city above groaned, its streets shifting to accommodate this new sorrow. The clerk placed a hand on his shoulder. “It’s enough. The bargain is complete.” <words>390</words>  

But Elias shook his head. “No. It’s never enough.” He fed the entire dictionary into the fire, its pages curling into ash, and the underwater city glowed with a light that could be seen for miles. <words>430</words>  

As he stepped back into the silent office, the clerk handed him a single, unburned page—the word “hope” still legible. Elias tucked it into his pocket, his heart lighter, his regret now a beacon. <words>470</words>  

The city would endure, built on the stories of the broken, and Elias, the meek blacksmith, had finally forged something eternal. <words>490</words>
