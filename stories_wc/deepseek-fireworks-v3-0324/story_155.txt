The underwater welder, known only as Vale, clutched the vintage button box as if it held the answer to everything—or nothing at all. <words>27</words> The box had come to him via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, appearing and disappearing like a half-remembered dream, until he’d finally snatched it from a dusty shelf in the broken planetarium, now reimagined as a night club called *Celestial Drift*. <words>68</words> Its cracked dome pulsed with neon, a poor imitation of the stars it once charted, and Vale felt the weight of the moment—the crossing where two timelines should never meet. <words>100</words>  

He was patiently impatient, a man who could spend hours welding seams in the crushing dark but now tapped his foot like a caged animal. <words>128</words> The button box, with its mother-of-pearl inlays and rusted hinges, seemed to hum in his grip, whispering of moments of unraveling. <words>150</words> Vale had come here to wield improbable power, though he couldn’t say how or why—only that the box demanded it. <words>172</words>  

The club’s air was thick with inherited mystery, the kind that clung to old places repurposed by desperate hands. <words>193</words> Vale dodged dancers and slipped into a booth, where he spread the box’s contents before him: buttons of bone, brass, and glass, each etched with symbols that made his vision blur. <words>225</words> A waitress with silver-streaked hair leaned over, her voice low. “You look like you could use a pamper,” she said, sliding him a drink he hadn’t ordered. <words>253</words> Vale ignored it, pressing a thumb into a button marked with a spiral. <words>267</words>  

The room shuddered. The music stuttered. For a heartbeat, the dome above flickered back to its original purpose, constellations flaring to life before collapsing into static. <words>298</words> Vale gasped—the button had shown him a glimpse of another time, another *him*, welding not metal but the fabric of reality itself. <words>322</words> The waitress’s smile turned sharp. “Careful,” she murmured. “Some threads aren’t meant to be pulled.” <words>344</words>  

But Vale was done with caution. <words>349</words> He slammed another button, this one cold as deep ocean, and the club dissolved into a memory: the planetarium whole, its projector humming, a crowd of children pointing at Saturn’s rings. <words>383</words> Among them, a boy with Vale’s eyes turned, as if sensing him, and waved. <words>400</words> The moment unraveled as quickly as it had come, leaving Vale breathless in the neon haze. <words>420</words>  

The box was a key—or a weapon. <words>426</words> Vale’s hands shook as he gathered the buttons, each one a door to a timeline he wasn’t meant to see. <words>447</words> The waitress watched him, her expression unreadable, as the club’s pulse thrummed in time with his racing heart. <words>468</words> He had what he wanted now: the power to bend worlds. <words>481</words> But as the dome flickered again, Vale wondered if he’d already pressed too far. <words>500</words>  

The button box clicked shut, sealing its secrets—for now. <words>513</words>
