<story>  
The dejected knight floated through the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor clinking softly against the drifting debris of a forgotten era. <words>27</words>  
His gauntlet clutched the trident prong from a sunken realm, its jagged edges humming with a power that quickened his pulse. <words>50</words>  
Around him, the hall’s shattered chandeliers spun lazily, their crystals refracting light into deepening horizons of blue and gold. <words>74</words>  
This place was normally abnormal—a relic of a time when gravity obeyed no rules, and dancers pirouetted through the air like celestial bodies. <words>102</words>  
The knight’s boots scraped against the floor as he pushed off, propelling himself through forgotten paths between the ruins. <words>124</words>  
His mission was clear: to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, one sworn in the shadow of an old watchtower clock. <words>148</words>  
That clock had struck an unexpected hour, its chimes resonating with a sacred disorder that called him here. <words>170</words>  
The trident prong grew warmer in his grip, its energy pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>185</words>  
He remembered the sunken realm’s fall, how its people had vanished beneath the waves, their cries swallowed by time. <words>207</words>  
Now, their legacy rested in this fragment, and the knight was the last who could restore it. <words>226</words>  
Ahead, a doorway shimmered, its frame twisted by the zero-gravity void. <words>240</words>  
He quickened his pace, pushing past floating tapestries that whispered in languages long dead. <words>256</words>  
The dance hall’s silence was oppressive, but the knight’s resolve was louder. <words>271</words>  
He had failed once before, his honor drowned in the same tides that claimed the realm. <words>288</words>  
This was his redemption, his chance to mend what was broken. <words>302</words>  
As he neared the doorway, the trident prong flared, illuminating glyphs carved into the walls. <words>320</words>  
They told of a ritual, one that required a sacrifice—not of blood, but of memory. <words>338</words>  
The knight hesitated, his past a weight heavier than any armor. <words>351</words>  
Yet the vow echoed louder, drowning his doubts. <words>362</words>  
He pressed the prong to his chest, its heat searing through metal and flesh alike. <words>379</words>  
The glyphs brightened, their light swallowing the hall in a blinding cascade. <words>395</words>  
For a moment, the knight felt the sunken realm’s presence, its people murmuring in gratitude. <words>414</words>  
Then the light faded, and the dance hall was still once more. <words>429</words>  
The knight stood alone, the trident prong now dull and lifeless in his hand. <words>445</words>  
But the old watchtower clock chimed again, its sound clear and true. <words>460</words>  
Somewhere, the sunken realm stirred, its horizons deepening with newfound hope. <words>476</words>  
The knight smiled, his vow fulfilled at last. <words>485</words>
