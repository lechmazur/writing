The reclusive board game designer clutched the phantom carnival ticket in his trembling hand, its edges frayed yet impossibly solid, as if it existed both here and elsewhere. <words>34</words>  

He had found it tucked inside an old sketchbook, its ink still fresh despite the decades since he’d last seen the forgotten clock tower where the carnival once stood. <words>68</words>  

Tonight, during the drawing of the Improv Show’s midnight lottery, he would escape—not from the world, but from himself, shadowboxing with personal demons that had haunted him since his games stopped selling. <words>106</words>  

The ticket hummed with a metaphysically physical presence, vibrating against his palm like a trapped heartbeat. It was a gift of belonging, though to what, he couldn’t say. <words>137</words>  

The clock tower loomed ahead, its face cracked and frozen at 11:59, as if time itself had abandoned it. He stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of rust and old sawdust. <words>170</words>  

A stage stood at the center, bathed in a near-distance glow, where performers in moth-eaten costumes whispered lines he almost recognized. One actor, a woman with painted tears, handed him a die. “Roll,” she said. “The game’s already begun.” <words>221</words>  

He rolled a three. The ticket in his hand flickered, and suddenly he was standing in the carnival of his childhood, the one that had vanished overnight. <words>249</words>  

Laughter echoed, but the crowd was faceless, their voices overlapping like a record skipping. His demons were here too, wearing the masks of his failed designs—the unsold games, the rejected pitches. <words>288</words>  

“You don’t belong,” they hissed, but the ticket pulsed warmly, a counterweight to their lies. <words>305</words>  

He turned and saw her—the improv actress from the clock tower, now dressed as a ringmaster. “You’re the designer,” she said. “So design your way out.” <words>335</words>  

The carnival was his board, the ticket his piece. He moved forward, weaving through stalls that shifted like cards in a deck, each step a rule rewritten. <words>363</words>  

At the heart of the carnival stood a mirror. In its reflection, he saw not his solitary self, but a circle of players—friends he’d never had, collaborators he’d pushed away. The gift of belonging had been there all along. <words>412</words>  

The ticket dissolved into light, and the carnival faded, but the warmth remained. Back in the clock tower, the improv show was ending. The actress winked. “Next game’s on you,” she said. <words>454</words>  

He left with a sketchbook full of new ideas, the demons quieter now, their voices drowned out by the ticking of a clock that had finally begun to move. <words>484</words>  

The phantom carnival was gone, but the belonging it gave him was real. For the first time in years, he felt like he was winning. <words>508</words>
