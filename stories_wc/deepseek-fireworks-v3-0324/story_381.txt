The hushed necromancer adjusted his scuffed baseball cap, its frayed edges catching the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi clinging to the crystalline cave walls. <words>25</words> Between sets of mapping the labyrinthine tunnels, he paused, listening to the distant drip of water—a sound like resolve, steady and unyielding. <words>48</words> His fingers traced the scarcely abundant runes etched into his leather-bound journal, each stroke a silent promise to dominate the uncharted depths. <words>72</words>  

"Ever seen *The Lost World*?" His companion, a wiry spelunker named Lira, flicked her headlamp toward him, its beam scattering prismatic light across the quartz. <words>98</words> The necromancer chuckled, the sound barely louder than the cave’s whispers. "1925 or 1960?" <words>115</words> Lira grinned. "Both. But the original’s better." Their shared love for old movies was the only reason he’d agreed to this partnership—that, and her uncanny ability to find paths where none existed. <words>150</words>  

The cave hummed with futuristic nostalgia, its ancient formations juxtaposed against Lira’s high-tech gear. <words>166</words> The necromancer’s motives were simpler: to map cave systems, yes, but also to uncover the secrets buried where light never reached. <words>186</words> He’d spent lifetimes in shadows, and this place—this crystalline cathedral—felt like a threshold. <words>201</words>  

Lira adjusted her harness, her voice echoing. "Think we’ll hit the chamber today?" <words>217</words> He nodded, though doubt gnawed at him. The cave resisted domination, its passages shifting like living things. <words>235</words> But the sound of resolve—drip, drip, drip—pushed him forward. <words>246</words>  

Then, the ground trembled. A fissure split the floor, revealing a chasm lined with veins of glowing ore. <words>266</words> Lira’s breath hitched. "That’s new." <words>271</words> The necromancer’s grip tightened on his journal. Beneath them, something stirred. <words>283</words>  

"Go back," he murmured. <words>286</words> Lira frowned. "Not a chance." <words>290</words> He met her gaze, the weight of centuries in his eyes. "This isn’t your world." <words>303</words>  

A gust of air, thick with the scent of damp stone, rushed up from the abyss. <words>318</words> The necromancer’s cap slipped, tumbling into the darkness. <words>328</words> For a heartbeat, he hesitated—then stepped forward, into the unknown. <words>341</words>  

Lira’s voice chased after him. "You’re insane!" <words>348</words> But the sound of resolve drowned her out. Drip. Drip. Drip. <words>359</words>  

The cave welcomed him, its crystalline teeth glinting. <words>368</words> He’d spent lifetimes in shadows. Now, he’d carve his own light. <words>381</words>  

Above, Lira’s headlamp flickered, a dying star. <words>390</words> She cursed, then followed. <words>394</words>  

The necromancer smiled. Some things, even the darkness couldn’t dominate. <words>407</words>  

Together, they descended, the cave’s heartbeat guiding them. <words>418</words> The map would wait. The movies would wait. <words>427</words>  

For now, there was only the sound of resolve—and the promise of what lay beneath. <words>441</words>
