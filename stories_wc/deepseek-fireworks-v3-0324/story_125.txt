The underachieving mage slumped in the abandoned space station control room, fingers drumming on a console coated in dust, his boredom punctuated by a flicker of excitement at the thought of what lay ahead. <words>30</words> Before him, atop a pile of misdelivered packages marked for some long-gone technician, sat a doll head with blinking eyes—exceptionally usual in its eerie persistence. <words>58</words> It had arrived weeks ago, misplaced among crates of farming equipment destined for the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, but he’d kept it, sensing it was more than it seemed. <words>90</words>  

He picked it up, turning it over in his hands, the glassy eyes clicking with each rotation. <words>106</words> "Reclaiming heritage," he muttered, the phrase echoing in the hollow chamber like a half-remembered spell. <words>123</words> His family had once been great mages, but he’d never lived up to their legacy—until now. <words>140</words> The doll head was the key, a relic of his ancestors’ craft, hidden in plain sight among the mundane. <words>158</words>  

With a sigh, he began to unveil its secrets, tracing his thumb over the seam where the porcelain met the scalp. <words>177</words> A faint glow pulsed beneath his touch, and the control room’s dead screens flickered to life, displaying symbols he hadn’t seen since childhood. <words>200</words> This was no accident; the packages had been misdelivered to him for a reason. <words>215</words> Someone—or something—wanted him to find this. <words>224</words>  

The mage grinned, realizing this was his chance to spring a trap on his own limitations. <words>240</words> He’d spent years doubting himself, but the doll head’s silent gaze demanded action. <words>255</words> Channeling his frustration into focus, he whispered an incantation, and the control room shuddered as if waking from a long sleep. <words>278</words> The air hummed with latent energy, and for the first time in his life, he felt the weight of his heritage settle onto his shoulders—not as a burden, but as a mantle. <words>307</words>  

Outside, the farmland stretched toward the horizon, its fate uncertain. <words>318</words> But here, in this forgotten place, the mage finally understood: greatness wasn’t inherited; it was claimed. <words>338</words> The doll head’s eyes blinked once more, and the station’s systems roared to life, casting jagged shadows across the walls. <words>360</words> He laughed, the sound tinged with bored excitement, as the pieces fell into place. <words>376</words>  

This wasn’t just about reclaiming his past—it was about rewriting his future. <words>391</words> The mage raised his hands, and the control room answered, its ancient machinery groaning in approval. <words>408</words> The boundary between failure and triumph had always been thin, and now, he’d crossed it. <words>425</words> The doll head’s eyes glowed brighter, sealing his resolve. <words>436</words> Whatever came next, he was ready. <words>443</words>  

The farmland would be sold, the station left to rust, but none of that mattered anymore. <words>460</words> He’d found what he was looking for. <words>466</words>
