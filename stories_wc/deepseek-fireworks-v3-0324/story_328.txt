The small-town bartender wiped down the counter with a rag that had seen better days, his assertively meek demeanor masking the desperation clawing at his ribs. Outside, the mirage oasis shimmered under the desert sun, a cruel joke to anyone who dared believe in it. He’d spent years here, pouring drinks for travelers who never stayed, their stories slipping through his fingers like sand. But tonight, under the flickering neon of the bar’s sign, he’d finally found his way out—or so he hoped.

The blank greeting card lay on the counter, its emptiness a silent challenge. He’d bought it years ago, intending to send it to someone who’d long since vanished. Now, it was the key. The impact of technology had rendered such gestures obsolete, but he’d always preferred the weight of paper in his hands, the scratch of ink. He traced the edge of the card, feeling the faint ridges of embedded threads of gold, like veins in a battered tapestry. They shimmered faintly, as if alive.

The fireworks began outside, bursts of color against the twilight. In the instant one fizzled and left smoke, he pressed the card to the tapestry hanging behind the bar—a relic from a world that no longer existed. The threads of gold flared, and the air hummed. To xenialize, his grandmother had called it: to welcome the strange, to make a door where there was none. The labyrinth of his life had no exit, but this was a thread he could follow.

The bar dissolved around him, the mirage oasis swallowing the walls. He stumbled forward, the greeting card now glowing in his grip. The tapestry’s threads wove themselves into a path, leading him through the smoke and into the heart of the oasis. It wasn’t water that awaited him, but a pulse—a rhythm like a heartbeat, steady and sure. He laughed, the sound raw with desperate optimism. For the first time, he wasn’t pouring drinks for ghosts. He was moving.

The threads tightened around his wrists, not to bind him, but to guide. The labyrinth had been his own making, a prison of routine and regret. But the card, the tapestry, the gold—they were reminders that even the smallest things could unravel the world. The fireworks faded behind him, their smoke curling into shapes he almost recognized. He didn’t look back. The oasis might still be a mirage, but the path was real. And for now, that was enough.

The bartender stepped into the light, the greeting card finally bearing words—not his own, but the ones he’d needed to hear. The threads of gold dissolved, their work done. Somewhere, a door closed. Somewhere else, one opened. He took a breath, and the desert exhaled with him.
