The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, his boots crunching on brittle leaves as the lull in the distant protest stretched thin, voices gathering again like storm clouds. <words>35</words> He clutched the piece of a broken mirror, its edges biting into his palm, a relic he’d found on the uniquely generic spiral staircase inside—the one where the slightest discoloration on the dust had made him pause, as if the house itself had whispered, *initiate*. <words>78</words> The encroaching darkness slithered between the tombstones, and he laughed, a flippant solemnity in his voice. "Of course it’s haunted," he muttered. "Why wouldn’t it be?" <words>112</words>  

The mirror fragment showed only fragments of his face—a bloodshot eye, the stubble he’d neglected—but he wasn’t here for vanity. He was here to become a living embodiment of his values, though he couldn’t quite remember what those were anymore. <words>156</words> The protest’s distant chants swelled, a chorus of anger and hope, and he envied their certainty. He’d once been like them, before the ale and the regret. <words>185</words>  

Inside, the mansion groaned. The spiral staircase beckoned, its steps warped with time, the discoloration now a faint glow, pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>211</words> He climbed, each creak a question: *Who are you? What do you want?* The mirror piece grew colder, and the darkness pressed closer, tendrils of it licking at his heels. <words>243</words>  

At the top, a door stood ajar. Beyond it, a room filled with shattered mirrors, each reflecting a different version of himself—brave, cowardly, sober, drunk. <words>271</words> The encroaching darkness pooled at his feet, and he realized this was the test. To choose. To *initiate*. <words>291</words>  

The protest outside reached a fever pitch, voices unified, and he grinned. "Fine," he said, raising the mirror fragment. "Let’s see what happens when a man tries to matter." <words>319</words> He pressed the shard into his chest, not deep enough to kill, but enough to draw blood. The darkness recoiled, then rushed into him, filling the hollow spaces. <words>351</words>  

When he stumbled back outside, the protest had moved on, leaving silence in its wake. <words>367</words> He felt different. Lighter. The brewer looked at his reflection in a puddle—still groggy, still flawed, but now with a shadow in his eyes that hadn’t been there before. <words>397</words> He laughed again, the sound echoing through the graveyard. Maybe he’d never be a hero, but he’d finally done something. And that was enough. <words>424</words>  

The mansion loomed behind him, its staircase waiting for the next lost soul. He pocketed the mirror piece and walked away, the darkness inside him humming a quiet tune. <words>453</words>
