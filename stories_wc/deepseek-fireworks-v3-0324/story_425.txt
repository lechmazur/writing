The morose paladin stood in the lavishly austere solar flare observatory, its walls lined with forgotten star charts and rusted instruments, their purpose eroded by time. <words>30</words> His gauntleted fingers brushed against a dull sewing needle lodged in the cracked leather of his belt—a relic from a life before vows, before duty. <words>56</words> Outside, the city lay in darkness, a blackout swallowing the streets whole, as if the universe itself had conspired to confine him here. <words>86</words>  

It was after the last star was named, when the heavens had become a graveyard of cataloged light, that he’d arrived, driven by a need to restore ancient systems long abandoned. <words>123</words> The observatory’s machinery hummed weakly, its gears protesting as he forced them to life, their visible changes marked by sparks and groans. <words>150</words> He worked with bored excitement, each adjustment a fleeting distraction from the weight of his solitude. <words>170</words>  

Then, a chance encounter during the blackout: a figure stumbled through the observatory’s doors, breathless, clutching a shattered lantern. <words>193</words> “You’re alive,” the stranger gasped, eyes wide with relief. <words>203</words> The paladin barely glanced up, his voice flat. “This place isn’t for the living.” <words>220</words>  

The stranger—a historian, it turned out—had come seeking the same thing: to revive the observatory’s heart, to make the stars speak again. <words>246</words> Together, they wrestled with corroded dials and frayed wires, the dull sewing needle proving oddly useful in prying loose stubborn components. <words>274</words> The paladin’s morose demeanor faltered, if only slightly, as the historian’s enthusiasm seeped into the stale air. <words>298</words>  

“Why do this?” the historian asked, wiping grease from their hands. <words>311</words> The paladin hesitated, then admitted, “Because the stars were once a map. Now they’re just names.” <words>331</words> The historian nodded. “Then let’s unname them.” <words>342</words>  

The blackout deepened, the city’s silence pressing in, but inside the observatory, something stirred. <words>362</words> A flicker of light, then another, as the ancient systems groaned awake. <words>378</words> The paladin watched, his heart a conflicted storm, as the stars on the charts above began to pulse—visible changes, not just in the machinery, but in him. <words>410</words>  

When the power returned, flooding the streets with artificial glow, the historian was gone, leaving only the needle behind. <words>434</words> The paladin picked it up, turning it over in his palm, feeling the weight of a choice: to confine himself to the past or to stitch a new path forward. <words>465</words> Outside, the last unnamed star winked at him through the haze, and for the first time in years, he smiled. <words>490</words>  

The observatory’s doors creaked shut behind him as he stepped into the light, the dull needle tucked safely away, a silent promise. <words>516</words> The stars could wait. He had work to do. <words>526</words>
