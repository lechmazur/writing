The exiled prince trudged through the abandoned customs office, his boots crunching over broken glass and frost, the air thick with the familiar unknown—a place once bustling now hollowed by time. <words>38</words>  

He carried an antique mortar and pestle, its surface worn smooth by generations of hands, though he had no use for it beyond the weight of memory. <words>68</words>  

A sudden snowstorm had forced him inside, the howling wind sealing the doors behind him, and now he stood in the dim light, watching his breath curl like smoke. <words>97</words>  

The turn of a key echoed through the empty halls, though he hadn’t touched a lock—unseen forces at work, or perhaps just the settling of the old building. <words>126</words>  

The prince sighed, running a finger along the mortar’s edge. It was unintentionally iconic, a relic of a life he’d lost, yet here it was, cradled in his hands like a promise. <words>160</words>  

He had come to improve himself, to shed the loneliness that clung to him like a second skin, but the past was a lock he couldn’t pick. <words>187</words>  

Then, a sound—a faint scraping, like stone on stone. He turned, gripping the pestle tighter, and saw a figure in the shadows: a woman, her eyes wide with recognition. <words>220</words>  

“You’re him,” she whispered, stepping into the light. “The prince who vanished.” <words>234</words>  

He tensed, but her voice held no accusation, only curiosity. She was a scholar, she explained, studying the ruins of the old kingdom. <words>258</words>  

The storm raged outside, trapping them together, and for the first time in years, the prince felt the weight of his exile lift, if only slightly. <words>286</words>  

She pointed to the mortar. “That belonged to the royal apothecary,” she said. “It was said to grind remedies for the soul.” <words>310</words>  

He laughed bitterly. “Then it’s useless. My soul is beyond repair.” <words>326</words>  

She reached out, her fingers brushing the pestle. “Or perhaps you’ve been using it wrong.” <words>344</words>  

The prince hesitated, then handed it to her. She poured a handful of dried herbs from her pouch—thyme, lavender, things he didn’t know—and began to grind. <words>375</words>  

The scent filled the room, warm and earthy, and for a moment, the cold receded. <words>393</words>  

“Loneliness is a wound,” she said softly. “But not an incurable one.” <words>410</words>  

Outside, the snowstorm howled, but inside, the prince felt something shift—the turn of a key, the unlocking of something long sealed. <words>437</words>  

He took the mortar back, their fingers brushing, and for the first time, he believed improvement was possible. <words>457</words>  

The abandoned customs office, the storm, the relic in his hands—it all felt like fate, or perhaps just a chance encounter shaped by unseen forces. <words>485</words>  

And as the snow began to slow, the prince realized he was no longer alone. <words>500</words>  

The woman smiled, and in that moment, the past felt lighter, the future less distant. <words>518</words>  

Together, they stepped into the fading storm, the mortar and pestle cradled between them, a symbol of something new. <words>539</words>
