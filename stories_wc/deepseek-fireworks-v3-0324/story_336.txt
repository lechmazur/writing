The weary undertaker shuffled through the silent street, his boots scuffing against cobblestones still trembling from the car’s backfire—a sharp crack that had shattered the hush like glass. <words>30</words> Ahead loomed the ancient Persian palace, reimagined now as a mausoleum of forgotten kings, its towering arches swallowing the moonlight whole. <words>56</words> In his arms, he cradled the astronomical clock, its gears frozen mid-whir, a relic of tribal knowledge passed down through generations of star-readers. <words>85</words> It was rarely practical, this clock, more a burden than a tool, but it was all he had left of his father, who had whispered of sun paths and celestial prisons. <words>115</words>  

The undertaker’s fingers traced the clock’s etched constellations, their grooves worn smooth by time. <words>130</words> He had come to imprison the darkness, not with chains or locks, but by following the sun paths his father had described—a ritual to trap the night’s endless hunger. <words>161</words> The palace’s shadow stretched toward him, its edges sharp as teeth, and he stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of dried roses and dust. <words>187</words>  

Beneath the domed ceiling, he set the clock upon a pedestal, its face catching the faint glow of a single candle. <words>210</words> The undertaker’s hands moved with placid ferocity, aligning the gears to the positions of long-dead stars. <words>229</words> He could almost hear his father’s voice: *To hold onto hope in the absolute dark, you must become the light.* <words>251</words> The clock’s hands began to turn, grinding against rust, and the palace seemed to breathe around him, its walls pulsing like a living thing. <words>278</words>  

Outside, the street remained silent, but within the palace, the undertaker felt the weight of centuries pressing down. <words>300</words> The astronomical clock whirred to life, its mechanisms spinning faster, and the shadows recoiled as if burned. <words>321</words> He had done it—imprisoned the darkness, not with force, but with the fragile, stubborn hope of a man who refused to let go. <words>347</words>  

As the first light of dawn seeped through the palace’s high windows, the undertaker slumped against the pedestal, exhaustion carving lines into his face. <words>375</words> The clock’s ticking slowed, its purpose fulfilled, and the tribal knowledge it held settled into his bones. <words>396</words> He had no use for practicality now; he had something rarer—a victory wrested from the night. <words>416</words> The street outside stirred, the world waking as if nothing had happened, but the undertaker knew the truth: some battles were fought in silence, with nothing but hope as a weapon. <words>450</words> He picked up the clock and stepped back into the light, its weight lighter than before. <words>468</words>
