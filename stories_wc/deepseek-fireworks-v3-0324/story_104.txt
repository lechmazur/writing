The stoic steward adjusted his wearable bird skull cameo, its hollow eyes staring blankly as he locked the miniature world museum’s doors after the orchard gate closed on harvest day. <words>30</words> The air smelled of cider and decay, a cynical warmth settling over the exhibits like dust. <words>47</words> He venerated the cracks in the façade—the tiny fractures in the dioramas where the glue had yellowed, where the painted skies peeled like old skin. <words>78</words> To the visitors, these were flaws; to him, they were honestly rare truths, whispering of time’s relentless march. <words>102</words>  

His fingers brushed the encrypted shipping labels tucked in his pocket, each a cipher for artifacts too strange for daylight. <words>126</words> The museum’s curator had called them “eccentricities,” but the steward knew better—they were acts of defiance, parcels sent to defy the lullaby of conformity. <words>156</words> Tonight, he would unpack the latest: a glass vial of frozen thunder, a clock that ticked backward, a map of a city that never was. <words>184</words>  

The cameo at his throat pulsed faintly, as if the bird’s spirit still clung to its bones. <words>204</words> It had been a gift from the previous steward, a woman who’d vanished into the orchard one harvest night, leaving only her cameo and a note: “Beware the stillness.” <words>236</words> He’d worn it ever since, a silent rebellion against the museum’s polished lies. <words>255</words>  

A sound echoed through the halls—a sigh, or perhaps a child’s laugh. <words>271</words> The steward stiffened. <words>273</words> No one else should be here. <words>278</words> He followed the noise to the Hall of Forgotten Things, where the cracks in the façade were widest. <words>300</words> There, perched on a model of a sunken ship, was a sparrow, its feathers dusted with gold paint. <words>325</words> Alive. <words>326</words> Impossible. <words>327</words>  

The bird tilted its head, and the steward’s cameo grew warm. <words>342</words> “You’re one of hers,” he murmured. <words>350</words> The sparrow hopped onto his finger, its weightless presence a confirmation. <words>368</words> The previous steward had left more than a note—she’d left a key. <words>386</words>  

He returned to his desk, the sparrow nestled in his palm, and decoded the latest shipping label. <words>408</words> The address led not to a warehouse, but to a hidden door in the orchard wall. <words>429</words> Beyond it, the trees grew upside-down, their roots clawing at a sky full of stars. <words>449</words> The steward smiled, his cynicism melting into something like hope. <words>465</words> The museum’s perfect world was a lie, but the cracks—oh, the cracks were real. <words>486</words>  

With the sparrow on his shoulder and the cameo humming, he stepped through the door, leaving the lullaby of conformity behind. <words>513</words> The orchard gate had closed, but the world beyond it was just beginning. <words>530</words>
