The quiet deserter sat in the corner of the plant communication study, his fingers tracing the edges of a cracked mirror, its fractures reflecting his fragmented thoughts. <words>30</words> He had abandoned his post, not out of cowardice, but because the war’s endless cycle had left him dizzyingly grounded—too aware of its futility to pretend otherwise. <words>60</words> Around him, the plants hummed with silent conversations, their leaves trembling as if sharing secrets he could almost decipher. <words>80</words>  

The study was cluttered with jigsaw puzzles, half-finished and abandoned, their pieces scattered like the shards of porcelain masks he’d found in the ruins. <words>110</words> Those masks had once belonged to storytellers, their tales now lost—except to him. By reconstructing stories from shattered porcelain masks, he’d begun to see the truth: every story was a loop, every war the same. <words>150</words> He wanted to break the cycle, even if it meant carbonizing his past, burning away the lies he’d been fed. <words>170</words>  

The mirror’s cracks deepened as he pressed his palm against it, his reflection splintering into a dozen strangers. <words>190</words> He wondered if any of them knew where he belonged. The plants rustled, as if answering, their roots weaving through the soil like threads of a story waiting to be told. <words>220</words> He laughed, a sound tinged with noble foolishness—who else would seek solace in greenery and broken artifacts? <words>240</words>  

Days passed, measured by the slow completion of jigsaw puzzles, each piece a step toward understanding. <words>260</words> The masks whispered of a place beyond the war, a nowhere that might yet be a home. <words>280</words> He listened, his hands steady as he fit the last porcelain fragment into place, the face of a storyteller staring back at him with knowing eyes. <words>310</words> The plants grew louder, their voices a chorus urging him forward. <words>330</words>  

When the soldiers came, he didn’t run. He stood before them, the cracked mirror in one hand, a porcelain mask in the other. <words>360</words> “I’ve seen the cycle,” he said, his voice quiet but unshaken. “And I choose to break it.” <words>380</words> The air shimmered as the plants’ whispers crescendoed, their roots surging upward to carbonize the weapons in the soldiers’ hands, reducing them to ash. <words>410</words>  

The deserter smiled, dizzyingly grounded in his resolve. <words>420</words> He had found his place—not in a kingdom or a battlefield, but in the act of defiance, in the stories he’d pieced together from ruin. <words>450</words> The plants curled around his feet, their voices a promise: belonging wasn’t a place, but a choice. <words>470</words> And as the last puzzle piece clicked into place, he knew he’d finally arrived. <words>490</words>  

Even if it was nowhere. <words>500</words>
