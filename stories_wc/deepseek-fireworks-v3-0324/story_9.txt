The soothsayer stumbled through the maze of billboards, their neon glow casting long, jagged shadows across the desert sand. "Of course," they muttered with molten sarcasm, "because nothing says 'environmental stewardship' like a wasteland plastered with ads for soda and sneakers." Their fingers clenched around the pocket puzzle box with 13 locks, each tiny mechanism clicking faintly as if mocking their panic. <words>60</words>  

The box had appeared in their hand moments ago, materializing like a bad omen between lost years—those gaps in time no one remembered but everyone felt. "Probably unlikely I’ll solve this," they grumbled, squinting at the water rings on a battered wooden bar top wedged between two billboards. The rings pulsed faintly, magnifying glimpses of futures where the desert swallowed cities whole. <words>120</words>  

"Destiny’s a fickle thing," the soothsayer spat, tracing a ring with their thumb. "But if I’m going to shape it with my bare hands, I’d rather not do it in a place that smells like burnt plastic." The puzzle box trembled, its locks shifting of their own accord. Each turn revealed another vision: a world where the billboards crumbled, replaced by forests that grew faster than they could be cut down. <words>180</words>  

The soothsayer’s panic flared. "Oh, lovely. Now I’m responsible for saving the planet with a glorified fidget toy." They twisted the box harder, their sarcasm a shield against the weight of what they saw. The water rings flared brighter, showing a path through the maze—a path that led to a single, gnarled tree sprouting defiantly from the sand. <words>240</words>  

"Of course it’s a tree," they sighed. "Because nothing says 'hope' like a plant in a neon hellscape." But the puzzle box didn’t care for irony. Its final lock clicked open, revealing a seed glowing with an eerie, green light. The soothsayer stared at it, then at the tree in the vision. "You want me to plant this? Here?" The box’s silence was answer enough. <words>300</words>  

With a groan, they trudged toward the tree’s location, their boots kicking up sand that glittered like shattered glass. The billboards loomed taller, their ads flickering between promises of happiness and warnings of collapse. The soothsayer’s fingers itched to throw the seed and run, but the water rings had shown them what happened if they did nothing. "Fine," they snapped. "But I’m not singing any hymns while I do it." <words>380</words>  

They knelt beside the gnarled tree, digging a shallow hole with their hands. The seed slipped from their grip, burying itself deep. The moment it touched earth, the ground shuddered. Vines erupted, weaving through the billboards, their leaves swallowing the neon glow. The soothsayer staggered back, watching as the maze became a jungle. "Well," they said, brushing sand from their robes, "that was probably unlikely." <words>460</words>  

The puzzle box lay empty at their feet, its purpose fulfilled. The soothsayer picked it up, turning it over in their hands. "Next time," they muttered, "just send a memo." The desert wind carried their words away, lost between the years—but the trees remembered. <words>510</words>
