The dry-witted sentinel leaned against the haunted lighthouse keeper’s bedroom door, his fingers tracing the frayed piece of rope coiled around his belt. <words>25</words> Outside, the storm howled like a chorus of broken vows, each gust a reminder of eroding promises. <words>42</words> He smirked, glancing at the list in his hand—just after the final name had been crossed off. <words>60</words> "Certainly possible," he muttered, though the words tasted like ash. <words>71</words>  

The ghostly keeper had once been a man of tradition, and the sentinel had come to learn those methods, not to mourn them. <words>93</words> But the dance between duty and decay had left its mark. <words>104</words> He’d confiscated the rope from the last keeper, a man who’d hung himself with it rather than face the lighthouse’s whispers. <words>129</words> Now it was his turn to listen. <words>135</words>  

A shadow flickered across the wall, and the sentinel’s grip tightened. <words>148</words> "You’re late," he said, though he knew time meant little here. <words>160</words> The ghost materialized, its form shifting like smoke. <words>170</words> They’d met before, always to the rhythm of a waltz—the dance the keeper had loved in life. <words>190</words> The sentinel had learned it just to spite him. <words>199</words>  

"Reckless precision," the ghost murmured, circling. <words>207</words> "You’ll break before you bend." <words>214</words> The sentinel shrugged, stepping into the dance’s first measure. <words>225</words> The floorboards groaned beneath them, a discordant counterpoint to their movements. <words>238</words> He’d come to learn, but the ghost had come to teach him how to lose. <words>253</words>  

The rope burned against his palm, its fibers unraveling like his resolve. <words>266</words> Promises were easy to make, harder to keep when the world itself seemed determined to fray them. <words>285</words> The ghost’s laughter echoed, sharp as the lighthouse’s beam cutting through the night. <words>300</words> "You’ll join the list," it whispered. <words>308</words>  

The sentinel spun, the dance accelerating. <words>315</words> He’d crossed off every name but his own. <words>323</words> The rope, the ghost, the waltz—they were all threads in the same unraveling tapestry. <words>339</words> He laughed, reckless and precise, as the storm outside reached its crescendo. <words>354</words>  

In the end, the lighthouse stood, its light unwavering. <words>365</words> The sentinel’s name remained uncrossed, but the rope lay severed at his feet. <words>379</words> The ghost was gone, the dance unfinished. <words>388</words> He picked up the frayed ends, tying them into a clumsy knot. <words>401</words> "Certainly possible," he repeated, though the words felt lighter now. <words>414</words>  

The list was complete, but the promises? <words>423</words> Those were his to keep or break. <words>431</words> The lighthouse’s beam swept over the sea, a silent sentinel in its own right. <words>446</words> The sentinel pocketed the rope and stepped into the storm, the waltz still humming in his bones. <words>465</words>
