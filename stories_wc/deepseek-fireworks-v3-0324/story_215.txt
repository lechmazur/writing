The rattled exorcist, Father Elias, clutched the vintage postcard in his trembling hands, its faded ink whispering secrets he wasn’t sure he wanted to know. <words>27</words> Amid the rhythmic tapping of dance lessons echoing through the psychic research facility’s halls, he felt the weight of guarded disclosures pressing against his ribs. <words>50</words> The postcard, addressed to him in looping cursive, bore no return address—only a cryptic riddle about "the room where shadows breathe." <words>76</words>  

Inwardly social but outwardly withdrawn, Elias had always preferred the company of spirits to living souls, yet even he couldn’t ignore the coy aggression in the message’s tone. <words>106</words> It was a challenge, a taunt—one that entwined science with wonder, just as the facility’s founder had intended. <words>125</words> He traced the postcard’s edges, realizing it was the first piece in a series of puzzles that would unlock a hidden room. <words>147</words>  

The facility hummed around him, its walls lined with artifacts of failed experiments and half-answered questions. <words>166</words> Elias moved past a pair of researchers practicing a waltz, their laughter sharp against his frayed nerves. <words>184</words> He needed to synthesize the clues—the postcard’s riddle, the facility’s blueprints, the whispers of a room that shouldn’t exist. <words>206</words>  

In his office, Elias spread the postcard beside a map of the building, his fingers dancing over the lines like a man possessed. <words>229</words> The answer came in a flash: the dance hall’s mirrored wall was a facade. <words>244</words> That night, he returned, his breath shallow as he pressed the hidden sequence into the floor tiles. <words>264</words> The wall slid open, revealing a chamber pulsing with an eerie glow. <words>280</words>  

Inside, the air thrummed with energy, and Elias understood—this was where the facility’s founders had tried to merge the empirical with the ethereal. <words>307</words> A journal lay open on a desk, its pages filled with frantic scribbles about "the exorcist’s key." <words>327</words> His key. <words>328</words> The coy aggression of the postcard made sense now; someone wanted him here, to finish what they’d started. <words>350</words>  

Elias’s hands shook as he reached for the journal, his mind racing. <words>362</words> To entwine science with wonder was a noble goal, but at what cost? <words>377</words> The room seemed to breathe around him, shadows stretching like eager fingers. <words>393</words> He stepped back, suddenly certain—this wasn’t just a hidden room. <words>408</words> It was a trap, and he’d walked right into it. <words>420</words>  

The dance lessons had stopped; the facility was silent. <words>431</words> Elias turned to leave, but the wall sealed shut behind him. <words>443</words> The vintage postcard fluttered to the floor, its final clue glaring up at him: "Now you see what they couldn’t." <words>463</words> In the dim light, Elias smiled, his fear giving way to grim determination. <words>480</words> If they wanted an exorcist, they’d get one. <words>490</words>
