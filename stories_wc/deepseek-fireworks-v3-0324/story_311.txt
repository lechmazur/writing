The lunar greenhouse perched on the crater’s edge was a fragile oasis, its glass panels reflecting the Earth’s pale glow as the tense bodyguard, Kael, paced its narrow aisles. His muscles coiled like springs, his eyes darting between the lush vegetation and the faded photograph clutched in his hand—a relic of a life he’d left behind. <words>50</words>  

Amid park visits to the biodome’s public sectors, Kael had overheard fragments of stories—whispers of rebellion, of a way to break free from the controlling influence of the lunar colony’s overseers. Each snippet was a puzzle piece, serendipitously stubborn in its refusal to fit until now. <words>100</words>  

The photograph showed his sister, her smile blurred by time, her fate sealed by the same regime that now held him in its grip. It was her memory that fueled his serene anger, a quiet fury that burned colder than the vacuum beyond the greenhouse walls. <words>150</words>  

Tonight, he would ratify his escape. The plan was simple: collect the final fragments of intel, sabotage the oxygen regulators, and slip away during the chaos. But the greenhouse was more than a hiding place—it was a symbol of rebirth, its plants thriving against all odds, just as he would. <words>200</words>  

A voice crackled in his earpiece, the overseer’s usual demands. Kael clenched his jaw, counting the seconds until the transmission ended. The plants around him swayed gently, their leaves brushing his arms like silent allies. He inhaled the damp, earthy air, steadying himself. <words>250</words>  

Then, a sound—footsteps. Kael melted into the shadows as a technician entered, humming. The man paused, frowning at a wilting fern. Kael’s pulse roared in his ears, but the technician moved on, oblivious. The moment passed, and Kael exhaled. Time was running out. <words>300</words>  

He unfolded the photograph one last time, tracing the edges. His sister had dreamed of Earth’s open skies, a dream stolen from her. Now, amid the sterile beauty of the lunar garden, Kael would claim that dream for himself. The rebirth he sought wasn’t just escape—it was defiance. <words>350</words>  

The overhead lights dimmed, signaling the colony’s artificial night. Kael moved swiftly, disabling the alarms with practiced ease. The fragments of overheard stories had led him here, to this moment. He was ready. <words>400</words>  

As the oxygen regulators hissed their final breath, Kael slipped into the service tunnel, the photograph tucked safely in his pocket. Behind him, the greenhouse stood silent, its plants bathed in starlight. Ahead, the unknown. His heart pounded, not with fear, but with the thrill of a timely rebirth. <words>450</words>  

The tunnel curved, leading him toward the surface, toward freedom. Kael smiled, his serene anger giving way to something brighter. For the first time in years, he felt alive. <words>480</words>  

The end. <words>482</words>
