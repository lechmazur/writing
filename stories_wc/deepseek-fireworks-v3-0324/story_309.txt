The overworked detective stood in the vanishing point gallery, his reflection fractured in the half-damaged kaleidoscope propped on a pedestal, its fleeting images mocking his exhaustion. <words>34</words> The hush that followed the final siren clung to the air like a held breath, and he rummaged through his coat pocket, fingers brushing against a single playing card—the ace of spades, bent at the corner. <words>73</words> "Confidently unsure," he muttered with molten sarcasm, the phrase tasting like cheap whiskey. <words>88</words> The card was a relic from a case long buried, a memory he couldn’t outdance no matter how fast he moved. <words>109</words>  

The gallery walls stretched into infinity, paintings of blurred faces and smeared landscapes echoing the detective’s frayed mind. <words>132</words> He tilted the kaleidoscope, and for a moment, the fractured light revealed a face he hadn’t seen in years—his partner, grinning behind a cigarette, seconds before the bullet tore through him. <words>166</words> The impact of memories was a sucker punch he never saw coming. <words>178</words> He dropped the card, as if it burned, and watched it flutter to the floor like a dying moth. <words>196</words>  

"Still chasing ghosts?" The curator’s voice slithered from the shadows, her smile sharp enough to draw blood. <words>217</words> The detective smirked, though his ribs ached with the weight of inevitability. <words>230</words> "Just admiring the art," he lied, kicking the ace under a display stand. <words>244</words> The kaleidoscope’s images shifted again—a flash of his own hollow eyes, a glint of the gun he’d sworn never to draw again. <words>269</words>  

He’d come here for answers, but the gallery only offered riddles. <words>282</words> The curator stepped closer, her perfume thick as fog. <words>292</words> "Some things aren’t meant to be solved," she whispered, her breath warm against his ear. <words>308</words> The detective clenched his jaw, the ace of spades burning a hole in his thoughts. <words>324</words> He’d spent years running from the past, but the vanishing point had a way of pulling everything into focus. <words>346</words>  

With a grunt, he snatched the kaleidoscope and hurled it against the wall, the glass shattering like the silence after a gunshot. <words>371</words> The curator didn’t flinch. <words>374</words> "Feel better?" she asked, her tone dripping with faux concern. <words>386</words> The detective exhaled, the weight of his failures settling like dust. <words>399</words> He picked up the ace, its edges sharp against his palm, and tucked it back into his pocket. <words>418</words> Some memories refused to stay buried. <words>424</words>  

The gallery doors creaked open, a sliver of daylight cutting through the gloom. <words>440</words> The detective stepped into the light, his shadow stretching long behind him. <words>454</words> He didn’t look back. <words>457</words>
