The sneering envoy stood beneath the domed vineyard, his boots crunching on the brittle soil of the barren alien plain, a folded note clutched in his gloved hand. <words>30</words> Around him, the air was furiously tranquil, a paradox of stillness and tension, as if the universe itself held its breath across the hush of a possibility just born. <words>60</words> He had come to sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse, its glass panes cracked and veined with time, where vines twisted like forgotten paper trails. <words>90</words> His mission was clear: to cup starlight in mortal palms, though the weight of rambling destiny made his fingers tremble. <words>110</words>  

The note, creased and yellowed, bore a single word—*Eclipse*—a clue left by the one who had vanished here decades ago. <words>130</words> The envoy’s sneer deepened as he traced the letters, the ink smudged by someone’s frantic touch. <words>150</words> He stepped into the greenhouse, where the scent of rotting fruit mingled with the metallic tang of the alien soil, and began his search. <words>170</words> Leaves, dry and brittle, skittered across the floor as he pushed deeper, his eyes scanning for the glint of something more than decay. <words>190</words>  

Then he saw it: a shard of glass, wedged between two stones, reflecting not the dim light of the dome but a flicker of distant stars. <words>220</words> His breath hitched. <words>221</words> This was it—the key to capturing the starlight, the reason the greenhouse had been left to wither. <words>240</words> The vines here were not ordinary; they were woven with celestial threads, their roots drinking from the plain’s hidden veins. <words>260</words> The envoy knelt, his sneer fading into something like reverence, and pried the shard free. <words>280</words>  

As he held it aloft, the dome above him shimmered, the vineyard’s neglected grandeur awakening for the first time in centuries. <words>310</words> The leaves around him stirred, not from wind but from the pulse of the stars themselves, their light seeping into the glass in his hand. <words>340</words> The note had led him true; the paper trails of the past had converged here, in this moment, under a sky that had waited patiently for mortal hands to claim its gift. <words>370</words>  

But the envoy hesitated. <words>371</words> To cup starlight was to hold eternity, and eternity was heavier than he’d imagined. <words>390</words> His sneer returned, not in disdain but in defiance—of the destiny that had guided him, of the silence that had suffocated this place. <words>420</words> With a sharp breath, he closed his fingers around the shard, and the dome erupted in light, the vines bursting into constellations. <words>450</words> The barren plain outside trembled, and the envoy laughed, because he had done the impossible: he had caught the stars. <words>480</words>
