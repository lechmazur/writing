The hush after the child’s last bedtime story settled like dust in the hollow of the Yggdrasil-like tree, its branches stretching into a sky where nightmares collided. <words>30</words>  

Ezra, the high-altitude con artist, perched on a gnarled limb, fingers tracing the mundanely terrifying scrap of fabric in his pocket—a relic from a life he’d faked his way out of. <words>60</words>  

Tonight, he had to compose a cosmic lullaby, a melody to quiet the screams echoing from the tree’s roots. The sticky notes in his other pocket held the key, their scrambled words rearranged daily by unseen hands. <words>90</words>  

Pristine chaos hummed around him, the air thick with the scent of ink and ozone. Ezra plucked a note, its edges frayed, and began unscrambling the letters. "Further," it read—a command or a plea? <words>120</words>  

The fabric scrap burned against his thigh, a reminder of the deal he’d struck: sing the lullaby, or the child below would never wake. He’d conned gods before, but this was different. This was personal. <words>150</words>  

The tree shuddered, its bark splitting to reveal eyes blinking in the dark. Ezra swallowed, his voice a whisper as he pieced together the next note: "Where shadows kneel." The words slithered into place, the lullaby taking shape. <words>180</words>  

A gust of wind sent the sticky notes fluttering, their order lost again. Cursing, Ezra snatched at them, his pulse a drumbeat in his ears. The child’s breath, slow and steady, drifted up from the roots. Time was running out. <words>210</words>  

He forced his hands still, focusing. The fabric scrap, now glowing, pulsed in time with his heartbeat. It was a piece of the child’s blanket, torn in a moment of desperation. Ezra’s con had brought him here, but his guilt would see it through. <words>250</words>  

The final note unscrambled to "collide," and the lullaby clicked into place. Ezra sang, his voice weaving through the branches, stitching the nightmares together until they dissolved into starlight. <words>280</words>  

The tree sighed, its eyes closing. Below, the child turned in their sleep, unharmed. Ezra slumped against the trunk, the fabric scrap now cold in his hand. He’d composed the lullaby, but the cost lingered—a debt unpaid, a fear unspoken. <words>320</words>  

Dawn crept in, painting the sky in hues of ash and gold. Ezra tucked the scrap away, the sticky notes blank now, their purpose fulfilled. The tree stood silent, its secrets buried deep. <words>350</words>  

He climbed down, his boots scraping against the bark. The child’s window was dark, their dreams untroubled. Ezra lingered, then turned away. The nightmares would return, and so would he. <words>380</words>  

For now, the hush held. Ezra vanished into the morning mist, the cosmic lullaby humming in his wake, a fragile peace between pristine chaos and the mundanely terrifying truth: some cons never end. <words>410</words>  

The fabric scrap fluttered from his pocket, caught by the wind, a silent promise to the next child, the next tree, the next collision of nightmares. Ezra didn’t look back. <words>440</words>  

Somewhere, a sticky note rearranged itself, and the cycle began again. <words>450</words>
