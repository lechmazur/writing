The stubborn monk awoke in the heartbeat after a dream returned, his breath shallow as the aerial gondola swayed beneath him, crossing the jagged mountains like a spider’s thread stretched taut. <words>36</words>  

The dream had been familiar—a shadow with his face, whispering promises he’d once sworn to reject. Clutching the creased shipping label in his hand, he traced its frayed edges, the ink blurred by time and sweat. <words>74</words>  

It had led him here, to this visually unappealing vessel of rust and groaning wood, where the wind howled through cracks like a chorus of lost voices. The label bore a name he hadn’t spoken in decades: the man he’d vowed to avenge. <words>118</words>  

Beneath his robes, the antique flute pressed against his ribs, its surface marred by tooth marks—tiny, precise, as if gnawed by a creature neither beast nor man. Through analyzing tooth marks on an antique flute, he’d learned the truth: his enemy had been here, had held this very instrument, had left behind a clue in the violence of his grip. <words>184</words>  

The monk exhaled, steadying himself. Harvesting the past was never clean; it demanded sifting through rot and regret. But he would outsmart his own dark reflection, even if it meant becoming what he despised. <words>226</words>  

Outside, the gondola lurched, and for a moment, he glimpsed his face in the grimy window—older, harder, but still his. The mountains below were teeth in the earth’s maw, waiting. <words>262</words>  

He lifted the flute to his lips, playing a note so thin it barely existed. The sound unraveled the air, revealing whispers woven into the wind—names, dates, a confession. His enemy’s voice. <words>300</words>  

The monk’s fingers trembled. This was cautious enchantment, a dance on the edge of ruin. One misstep, and the past would swallow him whole. <words>328</words>  

The gondola creaked, descending toward a village nestled in the valley, its lights flickering like dying stars. His destination. His reckoning. <words>354</words>  

The shipping label crumpled in his fist. He’d carried it for years, a relic of the day his mentor had fallen, the day he’d sworn vengeance. But now, with the flute’s secrets humming in his bones, he wondered if he’d been chasing a ghost—or his own reflection. <words>412</words>  

The gondola touched ground. The monk stepped out, the flute cold against his palm. The wind carried the scent of ash and pine. Somewhere ahead, his enemy waited. Or perhaps, the man he’d become. <words>454</words>  

He smiled, sharp as a blade. Let the past try to claim him. He’d carve his own path through it. <words>478</words>  

The village gates loomed, rusted and grim. The monk straightened his robes and walked forward, the flute’s tooth marks burning like a brand. This time, he wouldn’t falter. <words>511</words>
