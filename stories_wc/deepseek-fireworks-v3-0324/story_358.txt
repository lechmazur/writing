The old-fashioned mage shuffled through the arctic research greenhouse, his robes brushing against frost-laden ferns, his mind as purposefully aimless as the drifting snow outside. <words>28</words> Amid playground time, when the distant laughter of children echoed like wind chimes, he clutched the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, its hieroglyphs pulsing with a sanctified dread. <words>58</words> The riddle had unfolded slowly, whispered through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections that vanished before he could grasp their meaning. <words>83</words>  

He paused before a pane of ice-coated glass, his breath fogging the surface until another version of himself appeared—younger, fiercer, eyes alight with ambition. <words>111</words> "Claim the frontier," the reflection murmured, its voice like cracking ice. <words>123</words> The mage shuddered, remembering the cost of such hunger, but the coffin fragment burned in his palm, urging him onward. <words>143</words>  

A child’s ball rolled to his feet, bright red against the sterile white, and he bent to pick it up, fingers trembling. <words>162</words> For a moment, he longed to cuddle it close, to surrender to the simplicity of innocence, but the reflection in the ball sneered. <words>183</words> "You are not meant for comfort," it hissed. <words>192</words> The mage straightened, his resolve hardening like permafrost. <words>202</words>  

The greenhouse trembled as if the earth itself resisted his quest. <words>212</words> Yet, the riddle’s final piece lay hidden here, between the frozen petals and the ghostly whispers of his mirrored selves. <words>231</words> He pressed the coffin fragment to the glass, and the world split open—a gateway to the uncharted frontier, a realm where time curled like smoke. <words>256</words>  

The children’s laughter turned to screams as the playground beyond the greenhouse warped, swings twisting into skeletal shapes. <words>276</words> The mage stepped forward, his heart a drum of dread and determination. <words>288</words> This was his purpose, carved into his soul long before the pharaoh’s curse had found him. <words>304</words>  

A final reflection appeared, not in glass but in the eyes of a frozen fox, its gaze knowing. <words>322</words> "Will you remember?" it asked. <words>328</words> The mage hesitated, then nodded. <words>333</words> The frontier was his to claim, but the cost was the man he had been. <words>348</words>  

The greenhouse shattered into a thousand shards, each a mirror, each a fragment of his past. <words>366</words> He walked into the blinding white, the coffin fragment now a key, the riddle now his life. <words>382</words> Behind him, the playground fell silent, swallowed by the snow. <words>394</words> Ahead, the uncharted frontier waited, its secrets etched in ice and time. <words>408</words>  

The old-fashioned mage vanished into the storm, his story rewritten with every step, his dread and devotion entwined like vines. <words>429</words> And somewhere, in another reflection, another version of himself watched—and began again. <words>445</words>
