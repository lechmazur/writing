The gentle swordsman leaned against the towering femur of a Tyrannosaurus rex, his calloused fingers tracing the grooves of an empty matchbox—his only keepsake from a life once aflame. <words>30</words> The dinosaur skeleton museum was silent now, its hollow bones echoing only the faintest hum of the night, for the orchard dog had finally stopped barking, its vigilance surrendered to the dark. <words>60</words> He was a late bloomer, this swordsman, his blade sheathed more often than drawn, his heart too tender for the world’s sharp edges. <words>80</words> Yet here he stood, a man faithfully unfaithful to his own nature, torn between the stillness of the past and the pull of something vast and unseen. <words>110</words>  

His xenophile heart ached for the unfamiliar, for the whispered secrets of distant lands, and so he had come to this place of ancient bones, seeking answers in the coded angles of a half-painted sundial. <words>150</words> The sundial’s fractured face, half-eroded by time, pointed not to hours but to constellations, its numerals etched in a language only the stars could read. <words>180</words> He crouched beside it, his breath fogging the metal, and wondered if it might teach him how to cradle the universe in a cupped hand—to hold infinity without crushing it. <words>210</words>  

The matchbox rattled in his palm, a sound like dry teeth. <words>220</words> Once, it had held fire; now it held only the memory of light. <words>230</words> He smiled, a brusque affection warming his chest. <words>240</words> Perhaps that was enough. <words>245</words> The museum’s shadows stretched long, the dinosaur skeletons looming like sentinels of a forgotten age, their silence a reminder that even giants fall. <words>275</words> He sheathed his sword—not in defeat, but in understanding. <words>285</words>  

The sundial’s cryptic message, if it held one at all, was not for him to decipher tonight. <words>305</words> Instead, he pressed the matchbox to his lips, a kiss for the past, and stepped into the cool air outside. <words>330</words> The orchard dog’s silence was a gift, a rare moment of peace in a world that barked and bit. <words>350</words> He walked, his boots crunching on gravel, his heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>370</words>  

Late bloomers, he thought, were like the stars—slow to ignite, but burning all the brighter for it. <words>390</words> And if the universe could not be cradled, then perhaps it could be met with open arms, a faithful unfaithfulness to the idea of holding on. <words>420</words> The night stretched before him, vast and unknown, and he welcomed it, a xenophile to the last. <words>440</words> The matchbox, empty but unbroken, stayed tucked in his pocket, a quiet companion for the road ahead. <words>465</words>
