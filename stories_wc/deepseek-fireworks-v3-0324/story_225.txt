The wayward apothecary stood on the steampunk submarine’s observation deck, her fingers tracing the brass rivets of the porthole as she watched the migratory butterflies flutter past like living embers. <words>38</words> The submarine, a battered marvel of gears and glass, hummed beneath her feet, its engines protesting the depth as it pursued the delicate creatures through the ink-dark waters. <words>75</words> In her pocket, she clutched a dry highlighter pen, its ink long faded, a relic from a world above that no longer remembered her name. <words>107</words>  

She had come here between broken treaties, when the surface nations had turned their backs on the sea, and the depths had become a refuge for the unjustly fair—those too strange or too stubborn to belong anywhere else. <words>155</words> The apothecary was both. <words>158</words> Her love was unconventional, a secret whispered in Morse code signals tapped against the submarine’s pipes, meant for the ears of the engineer who had once mended her broken vials. <words>195</words> He was gone now, lost to the currents, but she still tapped the rhythms of his name against the metal, hoping the sea would carry them back. <words>229</words>  

The butterflies were her purpose now. <words>233</words> She tracked their path, not for science, but because their migration mirrored her own restless heart. <words>252</words> They were infected, though no one else could see it—their wings bore the faintest glow, a symptom of the same alchemical imbalance that had driven her below the waves. <words>288</words> She wondered if they, too, carried dry pens in their pockets, useless but impossible to discard. <words>311</words>  

The submarine shuddered, and the apothecary steadied herself against the wall. <words>328</words> The engineer had once told her that machines, like people, could be unjustly fair—built for one purpose but destined for another. <words>356</words> She had laughed then, but now she understood. <words>366</words> The submarine was meant for war, yet here it was, chasing butterflies and carrying a woman who spoke in Morse code to ghosts. <words>394</words>  

As the last of the butterflies vanished into the abyss, the apothecary pressed the dry highlighter to the porthole, leaving a faint, invisible mark. <words>422</words> It was a futile gesture, but so was love, so was memory. <words>436</words> The submarine turned, its gears groaning, and she tapped one final message into the pipes, a farewell to the engineer, to the butterflies, to the world above. <words>470</words> The sea swallowed the sound, and the apothecary smiled, her heart as battered and marvelous as the vessel that carried her. <words>496</words>  

In the end, she knew the butterflies would return, and so would she. <words>511</words> Some loves, like some infections, never truly faded. <words>522</words>
