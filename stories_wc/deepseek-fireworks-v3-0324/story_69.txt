The uncertain druid wandered through back-alley theater auditions, his dented lunch tin clutched tightly under his arm, its faint metallic rattle echoing his restless thoughts. <words>28</words> He had come to the city seeking something uniquely common—a place where the ties of obligation wouldn’t choke him, where he could forge beauty from anarchy instead of bowing to it. <words>59</words> The hologram repair shop loomed ahead, its flickering neon sign casting jagged shadows across the damp pavement, a beacon in the lethargic excitement of the district. <words>89</words> Inside, the air hummed with the static of half-repaired projections, their fractured images dancing like ghosts between the shelves. <words>110</words>  

The shopkeeper, a wiry woman with grease-stained fingers, eyed him as he entered. “Library hours are almost over,” she said, nodding toward a clock whose hands moved backward. <words>141</words> The druid hesitated—time here was as unreliable as his magic, slipping through his grasp like smoke. <words>160</words> He set the lunch tin on the counter, its dented surface reflecting the shop’s chaotic glow. “I need a stage,” he murmured, “one that doesn’t exist yet.” <words>187</words>  

The shopkeeper smirked, pulling a cracked hologram projector from beneath the counter. “This one’s got a mind of its own,” she warned. “Like you, maybe.” <words>214</words> The druid’s fingers brushed the device, feeling the pulse of its erratic energy. It was perfect. <words>231</words> Outside, the alley theaters were beginning their nightly performances, actors weaving through crowds with scripts no one had written. <words>253</words>  

He stepped into the fray, the projector humming to life in his hands. <words>265</words> Images burst forth—tangled vines, fractured skies, a wolf with eyes like his own—each frame a rebellion against order. <words>286</words> The crowd paused, then erupted into applause, not for the spectacle, but for the raw, untamed possibility of it. <words>309</words> The druid grinned, his uncertainty melting into purpose. <words>320</words>  

By the time the library’s closing bell echoed through the streets, the hologram had burned itself out, leaving only the scent of ozone and the weight of the lunch tin in his hands. <words>353</words> The shopkeeper was gone, the door locked behind her, but the druid didn’t mind. <words>370</words> He had found what he came for—not a stage, but the courage to wander until the next one appeared. <words>392</words>  

As he turned the corner, the city’s chaos folded around him like a cloak, and for the first time in years, he felt uniquely common again. <words>417</words> The dented tin rattled once more, a quiet reminder of the ties he’d chosen, not the ones that had chosen him. <words>438</words> The night stretched ahead, endless and alive, and the druid walked into it, ready to forge whatever came next. <words>460</words>
