The advisor’s fingers trembled as they brushed the glass jar, its label—“DUPLICATE”—peeling at the edges, the brain inside pulsing faintly in the hush of a simmering future. <words>34</words>  

Secret agent headquarters hummed with silent urgency, its corridors empty save for the echo of footsteps in abandoned places, a sound that made the advisor’s spine stiffen. <words>68</words>  

They had chased a rumor beyond all reason—a whisper of the dreamer’s calling, a power to reshape reality itself—but now, faced with the clearly ambiguous truth, doubt gnawed at them. <words>103</words>  

The brain in the jar was theirs. Or was it? The label mocked them, a jab at their fragile sense of self. <words>126</words>  

“You’re the backup,” the director had said, voice dripping with fractured idyll, as if the words were both a comfort and a condemnation. <words>150</words>  

The advisor’s reflection wavered in the jar’s surface, their face a blur of insecurity and resolve. If they were the duplicate, what did that make the original? A ghost? A lie? <words>182</words>  

Footsteps echoed again, closer this time. The advisor spun, heart pounding, but the hallway remained empty. Paranoia or prophecy? The line had blurred. <words>210</words>  

They had to know. Gripping the jar, they turned toward the forbidden archives, where the dreamer’s calling was said to sleep. <words>230</words>  

The door creaked open, revealing a chamber bathed in cold light. At its center stood a pedestal—empty. The rumor had been real. Someone had taken it. <words>256</words>  

The advisor’s breath hitched. Was this their purpose? To chase shadows while the original wielded the power? <words>274</words>  

A voice slithered from the darkness. “You were never meant to see this.” The director stepped forward, a syringe glinting in their hand. <words>298</words>  

The advisor stumbled back, the jar slipping from their grasp. It shattered, the brain within oozing across the floor like spilled ink. <words>320</words>  

“Why?” the advisor whispered, their voice cracking. <words>325</words>  

“Because dreams are for the chosen,” the director said, raising the syringe. “And you’re just an echo.” <words>345</words>  

But the advisor had spent a lifetime listening to echoes. They lunged, not away, but toward the director—a desperate jab at the hand holding their fate. <words>371</words>  

The syringe clattered to the ground. For a moment, the world held its breath. <words>386</words>  

Then the advisor ran, their footsteps joining the chorus of ghosts in the abandoned halls, chasing a truth that might never be theirs. <words>408</words>  

The dreamer’s calling was still out there. And so were they. <words>421</words>  

In the hush of a simmering future, the advisor vanished into the shadows, their story—like the brain in the jar—clearly ambiguous, yet undeniably alive. <words>450</words>
