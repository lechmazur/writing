The subdued vigilante crouched in the abandoned waiting area, his breath shallow, his fingers tracing the plain wooden bead tucked in his pocket—a relic from a life before war. <words>30</words>  

Outside, the screaming silence of the ruined city pressed against the broken windows, a reminder of the price of war he could never unpay. <words>54</words>  

During virtual calls with his mentor, he’d flatter the old man’s ego, pretending to care about his ramblings, all to master an ancient art—one that required tracking distortions in an antique funhouse mirror. <words>93</words>  

The mirror stood crooked against the far wall, its surface artfully clumsy, warping reflections into grotesque shapes. <words>113</words>  

He adjusted his stance, mimicking the movements he’d seen in the calls, but his body resisted, stiff from years of violence. <words>133</words>  

The wooden bead rolled between his fingers, its smoothness a contrast to the jagged edges of his guilt. <words>150</words>  

A shadow flickered in the mirror—not his own, but something twisted, a distortion he couldn’t explain. <words>169</words>  

His pulse quickened. Was this the art’s true test? Or just another trick of the war-scarred world? <words>188</words>  

The virtual calls had warned him: the mirror didn’t lie, but it didn’t show truth either. It revealed what lingered beneath. <words>210</words>  

He stepped closer, his reflection stretching into a specter of the man he’d once been. <words>225</words>  

The bead slipped from his grip, clattering to the floor, breaking the silence like a gunshot. <words>241</words>  

In the mirror, the distortion surged, swallowing his image whole. <words>252</words>  

He gasped, stumbling back, but the room around him wavered, the waiting area dissolving into a battlefield. <words>270</words>  

The price of war wasn’t just the lives lost—it was the selves forgotten, the art abandoned, the mirrors that showed what you’d become. <words>294</words>  

He reached for the bead, but his hand passed through it, insubstantial as smoke. <words>309</words>  

The virtual calls had been a distraction, a way to avoid the truth: the ancient art wasn’t about mastery. It was about surrender. <words>333</words>  

The mirror’s surface stilled, reflecting only the empty waiting area, the bead gone, the vigilante vanished. <words>352</words>  

Somewhere, a screen flickered to life, another call waiting. But no one answered. <words>368</words>  

The screaming silence returned, heavier now, as if the world itself mourned what it had taken. <words>385</words>  

In the end, the mirror showed nothing at all—just a plain wooden bead, resting where a man had once stood. <words>405</words>  

The war had claimed another, not with bullets, but with the weight of what could never be undone. <words>424</words>  

And the mirror, artfully clumsy, waited for the next soul brave enough to face its distortions. <words>442</words>  

The bead, forgotten, gleamed faintly in the dim light—a tiny monument to the price of war. <words>460</words>
