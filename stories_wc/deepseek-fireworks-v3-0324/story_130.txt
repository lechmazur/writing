The lost apprentice cradled the fallen bird’s nest in their hands, its delicate twigs woven with strands of stardust from the interstellar orchard ship’s last harvest. <words>30</words> Around them, the ship’s biome hummed, its artificial winds carrying the scent of ripening voidfruit, a promise of changing winds that had drawn travelers for generations. <words>60</words> "You’re staring at that nest like it’s got answers," chuckled the old gardener, their voice crackling through the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone they insisted on using. <words>90</words> The apprentice scowled but didn’t deny it; they’d spent cycles reverse-engineering every broken thing aboard this ship, hoping to find freedom in self-acceptance instead of just repairs. <words>120</words>  

"Maybe it does," the apprentice muttered, tracing the nest’s fractures with a finger. <words>135</words> The gardener’s laughter was warm but edged with mocking affection, the kind that made the apprentice’s cheeks burn. <words>155</words> "Wisdom’s not in the nest, kid. It’s in the falling." <words>165</words> The words lingered like the static between them, a traveler’s wisdom wrapped in riddles. <words>180</words> The apprentice hated riddles—they preferred circuits, things that could be taken apart and understood. <words>195</words>  

Yet here they were, privately open to the idea that maybe, just maybe, the ship’s migration between galaxies wasn’t just about fruit or fuel, but about shedding what no longer served them. <words>230</words> The nest had fallen from the highest branch of the orchard’s central tree, a place where birds forged homes from cosmic debris. <words>255</words> "Why’d it fall?" the apprentice asked, not expecting an answer. <words>267</words>  

"Same reason you did," the gardener said, voice softening. <words>277</words> "Sometimes the wind changes, and you’ve got to let go." <words>290</words> The apprentice clenched their jaw, remembering their first day aboard—how they’d clung to the title of "apprentice" like a lifeline, afraid to admit they were lost. <words>320</words> Now, holding the nest, they wondered if being lost was just another way of being free. <words>340</words>  

The cordless phone hissed, the gardener’s next words barely audible: "You keep trying to fix everything. Ever think some things are better broken?" <words>370</words> The apprentice looked down at the nest, its imperfections glowing faintly in the ship’s artificial twilight. <words>390</words> Maybe freedom wasn’t in perfection, but in the cracks where the light got in. <words>405</words> With a sigh, they placed the nest back on the tree, its fractures now part of its story—and theirs. <words>425</words>  

The orchard ship sailed on, its course uncharted, its passengers learning to embrace the fall. <words>440</words> And for the first time, the apprentice didn’t feel lost—just traveling. <words>455</words>
