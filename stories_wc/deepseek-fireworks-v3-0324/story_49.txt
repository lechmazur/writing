The lukewarm mage stood on the lunar base, his boots scuffing the torn doormat corner that had somehow found its way here, a relic of a home he could barely remember. <words>30</words> The air was thick with charred serenity, the quiet before ignition, before the clash that would decide everything. <words>53</words> He clutched the frayed fabric, clinging to echoes of a past that slipped through his fingers like the stage fog now swirling around him. <words>81</words>  

Loyally peculiar, he had always been—too hesitant for true power, too stubborn to let go. <words>98</words> The others had laughed, but he knew the truth: magic wasn’t in the flames or the fury, but in the ephemeral silhouettes cast by the fog, fleeting shapes that held the future. <words>137</words> Tonight, he would paint that future free from fear, or die trying. <words>150</words>  

The journal lay on the table, its pages blank, waiting for the hush to break. <words>165</words> He could almost hear the creak of its spine, the whisper of ink meeting paper—but not yet. <words>183</words> First, the fog thickened, and the silhouettes took form: a fractured city, a falling star, a hand reaching out. <words>207</words> The mage raised his own, trembling, and the shadows answered. <words>220</words>  

They clashed not with force, but with absence, swallowing light and sound, leaving only the mage and his resolve. <words>243</words> The torn doormat corner fluttered, as if caught in a wind that didn’t exist, and he wondered if it was laughing at him. <words>267</words> Maybe it was right. <words>270</words> But he had come too far to turn back now. <words>280</words>  

The fog coiled around his wrists, cool and insistent, and for a moment, he saw her—the one he’d lost, the one whose echo he’d chased across the stars. <words>312</words> She smiled, and the lunar base shuddered, the walls humming with a song only he could hear. <words>333</words> Then she was gone, and the journal’s cover lifted, just a fraction, as if beckoning. <words>354</words>  

He exhaled. <words>355</words> This was it. <words>357</words> The future wasn’t in the past or the fog, but in the act of reaching for it. <words>375</words> The mage stepped forward, the doormat fragment finally slipping from his grip, and as his fingers brushed the journal’s pages, the fog dissolved into light. <words>407</words>  

When the others found him, there was no clash, no fog, only the mage—no longer lukewarm—and the words he had written, bold and unafraid. <words>437</words> The torn doormat corner lay forgotten, but the echoes? <words>449</words> They clung to him still, not as chains, but as wings. <words>462</words>  

And the journal, now open, held a single phrase: "Begin." <words>474</words>
