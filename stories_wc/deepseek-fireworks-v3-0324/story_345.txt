The lapsed priest jogged through the labyrinth orchard, his breath fogging in the dull radiance of the morning, the towering bean stalks casting twisted shadows that seemed to whisper of fate unraveling. <words>34</words> His fingers clutched the broken abacus, its missing beads a silent tally of his complacency, each gap a sin unconfessed, a choice unmade. <words>62</words> The snow beneath his feet bore strange patterns, swirls and spirals that beckoned him deeper into the orchard, as if the very ground conspired to guide him beyond fate’s design. <words>93</words> He was unapologetically confused, his faith long abandoned, yet his steps were steady, driven by a hunger he could not name. <words>114</words>  

The bean stalks groaned in the wind, their colossal forms swaying like the ribs of some ancient beast, the sky between them a narrow ribbon of pale light. <words>141</words> He paused, tracing the snow patterns with a trembling hand, realizing they mirrored the abacus’s gaps—a map of his failures, or perhaps a key to his escape. <words>170</words> The price of complacency weighed heavy; he had once believed destiny was written, but now he saw it as a thread fraying, and he meant to pull it loose. <words>196</words>  

A bead of sweat slid down his temple as he ran again, the orchard’s maze tightening around him, the snow’s guidance growing faint. <words>217</words> The abacus rattled in his grip, its remaining beads clicking like a clock counting down the hush of fate’s unraveling. <words>237</words> He wondered if the missing beads were lost or stolen, if his own hands had plucked them free in some forgotten act of defiance. <words>258</words> The thought ignited something in him—a spark in the dull radiance of his resignation. <words>274</words>  

Then, a break in the stalks: a clearing where the snow fell undisturbed, its surface a blank slate. <words>293</words> Here, the patterns ended, and the priest understood. <words>301</words> This was the edge of the design, the place where complacency ended and choice began. <words>317</words> He knelt, pressing the abacus into the snow, leaving an imprint of what was broken and what remained. <words>337</words> The wind howled, and for the first time in years, he laughed, unapologetically confused, yet certain. <words>356</words>  

He stood, turning his back on the orchard, on the stalks that reached for a heaven he no longer believed in. <words>376</words> The snow patterns had led him here, but the next steps were his alone. <words>391</words> The abacus, missing its beads, was lighter now, as if his complacency had been the weight all along. <words>411</words> He jogged onward, beyond the labyrinth, beyond fate’s grasp, into the dull radiance of a world uncharted. <words>431</words> The price had been paid, and the reckoning was his to shape. <words>443</words>  

The hush of unraveling followed him, but he did not look back. <words>454</words>
