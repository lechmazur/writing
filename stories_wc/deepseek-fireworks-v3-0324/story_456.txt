The morbid florist arranged wilting roses in the floating rock dojo, her fingers trembling as she obliged the silent request of the wind to honor the dead. <words>27</words> A plain white candle flickered beside her, its wax pooling like tears on the weathered stone, its light fading in the last flicker of a guttering lantern. <words>52</words> She was neutrally passionate, neither mourning nor celebrating the cycles of decay, yet compelled to witness them. <words>72</words> Through the backlog of typed pages in a writer’s trunk, she had sought answers—fragments of stories about cosmic cycles, about life and death woven into the same thread. <words>101</words> The dojo, suspended between earth and sky, felt like a liminal space where such truths might reveal themselves. <words>122</words>  

Her tempered beliefs had once been fervent, but time had worn them smooth, leaving only a quiet curiosity. <words>142</words> The candle’s flame wavered, casting shadows that danced like spirits across the rock. <words>157</words> She traced the words on the yellowed pages, each sentence a puzzle piece in a grand design she couldn’t quite grasp. <words>177</words> Boldly timid, she whispered questions to the void, afraid of the answers but unable to stop seeking. <words>195</words> The dojo’s silence was her only reply, a stillness that stretched like the space between stars. <words>213</words>  

Then, as the candle’s light guttered one final time, she understood. <words>224</words> The cosmic cycles were not meant to be solved but witnessed, like the flowers she tended—brief, beautiful, and bound to fade. <words>245</words> The typed pages were not a map but a mirror, reflecting her own journey through the dark. <words>263</words> She blew out the candle, its smoke curling into the night, and stood, her heart lighter yet fuller. <words>283</words> The floating rock dojo, once a place of seeking, had become a place of knowing. <words>300</words>  

She gathered the pages, their edges brittle with age, and placed them back in the trunk. <words>318</words> The morbid florist no longer feared decay; she saw it now as part of the dance, a step in the rhythm of existence. <words>340</words> The plain white candle, spent but not forgotten, lay beside her, its purpose fulfilled. <words>358</words> She stepped to the edge of the dojo, where the rock met the sky, and breathed in the cool air. <words>378</words> The lantern’s last flicker had been a gift—a fleeting light to guide her to clarity. <words>397</words>  

In the end, she realized the cosmic cycles were not puzzles to solve but stories to live. <words>416</words> And so, with neutrally passionate resolve, she returned to her flowers, ready to oblige the next turn of the wheel. <words>437</words> The floating rock dojo, the candle, the pages—all had played their part. <words>453</words> Now, it was her turn to continue the tale. <words>463</words>
