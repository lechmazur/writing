The laundromat hummed between scenes of the night, its fluorescent lights flickering like glimmering transitions between wakefulness and dreams. <words>27</words>  

Ezra, an unlikely prophet with a conventionally rebellious streak, clutched a wilted paper flower in their pocket, its edges frayed from years of restless fidgeting. <words>52</words> They’d come to estrange themselves from the noise of the city, but the universe had other plans. <words>71</words>  

A stranger staggered in, reeking of ink and old books, muttering about a giant’s study hidden beneath the subway tunnels. <words>94</words> Ezra’s pulse quickened; they’d seen that study in visions—a place where scattered minds could be unified under a single vision. <words>119</words>  

“You’re lost,” the stranger said, eyes gleaming with haunting delight. “But so am I. That’s how we find each other.” <words>143</words>  

Ezra unfolded the paper flower, its creases catching the light like fractured promises. <words>158</words> “This was supposed to bloom,” they whispered. “But it never did.” <words>172</words>  

The stranger laughed, a sound like rustling pages. “Nothing blooms forever. Not even prophecies.” <words>191</words>  

They left together, the laundromat’s doors sighing shut behind them as they descended into the tunnels. <words>211</words> The giant’s study loomed ahead, its walls lined with towering shelves of forgotten tomes. <words>229</words> Dust motes danced in the air, glimmering like tiny stars. <words>241</words>  

“Why here?” Ezra asked, their voice echoing. <words>248</words>  

“Because giants see farther,” the stranger replied. “And you’re taller than you think.” <words>266</words>  

Ezra placed the wilted flower on a desk, its petals trembling as if stirred by an unseen breath. <words>286</words> The room seemed to lean in, listening. <words>293</words>  

“You want to unite them,” the stranger said. “But first, you must estrange them from their doubts.” <words>313</words>  

Ezra closed their eyes, feeling the weight of a thousand unspoken stories. <words>328</words> When they opened them again, the flower had unfurled slightly, its edges glowing faintly. <words>346</words>  

“Glimmering transitions,” the stranger murmured. “Between what is and what could be.” <words>363</words>  

The shelves began to shake, books tumbling like falling cities. <words>376</words> Ezra raised their hands, not in fear, but in welcome. <words>388</words> The scattered minds of the city whispered through the walls, drawn by the flower’s fragile light. <words>409</words>  

“Under a single vision,” Ezra said, and the room held its breath. <words>423</words>  

The stranger grinned, their teeth gleaming in the dark. “Now you see.” <words>436</words>  

The flower bloomed fully, its paper petals radiant, and for a moment, the giant’s study was no longer a hiding place but a beacon. <words>461</words>  

Ezra exhaled, their rebellion now a quiet revolution. <words>471</words> The night stretched on, but the scene had shifted—glittering, inevitable. <words>485</words>  

The laundromat’s lights still flickered above, unaware of the prophecy unfolding below. <words>500</words>  

And somewhere, a giant smiled. <words>506</words>
