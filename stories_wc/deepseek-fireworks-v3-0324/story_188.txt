The former lawman adjusted his vintage spectacles, the cracked lenses distorting the crumbling walls of the ancient Japanese castle like a fractured dream. <words>25</words> Around him, the air hummed with the quiet urgency of seed planting, a time of renewal that felt bitterly ironic. <words>45</words> He had come here to gather broken pieces—not of pottery or stone, but of himself, scattered across years of violence he could no longer justify. <words>72</words> The letter in his pocket, addressed to a long-dead warlord, had somehow found its way to him instead, its words stirring something dormant in his chest. <words>102</words>  

The castle’s corridors whispered of corroded rapture, where glory and decay intertwined like vines choking a forgotten shrine. <words>125</words> He traced a finger along a rusted suit of armor, wondering if its wearer had also sought escape from an unending cycle. <words>147</words> The letter spoke of a treaty never signed, a chance for peace lost to time—probably improbable, yet here he was, standing in the shadow of that same failure. <words>177</words>  

A sound echoed—footsteps. <words>180</words> The lawman turned, hand hovering near his revolver, but it was only a farmer, her hands caked in soil, eyes wide with curiosity. <words>204</words> “You’re him, aren’t you?” she asked. <words>211</words> “The one they say can’t outrun his past.” <words>220</words> He didn’t answer, but the weight of his silence was confession enough. <words>235</words>  

She led him to the castle’s garden, where seedlings trembled in the breeze, fragile as his resolve. <words>257</words> “Plant something,” she said. <words>261</words> “Maybe it’ll take root where you couldn’t.” <words>270</words> He knelt, the spectacles slipping down his nose, and for the first time in years, he felt the stir of something other than regret. <words>297</words>  

The letter had been misplaced, but it had reached the right person—a man who’d spent his life enforcing laws that only perpetuated the violence he now fled. <words>329</words> Here, among the ruins and the sprouts, he saw a path forward, frayed but possible. <words>348</words> The farmer handed him a seed. <words>353</words> “Every cycle breaks eventually,” she murmured. <words>362</words>  

He pressed the seed into the earth, his hands shaking, not with fear, but with the weight of a choice. <words>385</words> The spectacles, the castle, the letter—they were all fragments of a story he could finally rewrite. <words>405</words> The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of rust and gold, and for a moment, the world felt less broken. <words>430</words>  

The lawman stood, dusting the soil from his knees, and walked toward the gate. <words>446</words> Behind him, the seedlings swayed, tiny and defiant, as if daring the cycle to try again. <words>468</words> He didn’t look back. <words>471</words>
