The hive-mind therapist adjusted their scuffed phone charger plug, its frayed edges a uniformly peculiar contrast to the sterile walls of the secret agent training facility. <words>28</words>  

"Listen closely," they murmured, their voice a merry bitterness that curled through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery. "The sound of hindsight is not a whisper—it’s a scream." <words>60</words>  

The recruits shifted, their faces unreadable under the flickering candlelight. Wax dripped slowly, forming coded shapes on the cold metal floor, each drop a deliberate drain of time and patience. <words>94</words>  

One agent, a wiry woman with sharp eyes, leaned forward. "You’re saying we can anchor the ephemeral in reality?" she asked, her fingers tracing the wax patterns. "Or is this just another test?" <words>132</words>  

The therapist’s many minds hummed in unison, a chorus of fractured wisdom. "Reality is a test," they replied. "And the answers are written in wax." <words>158</words>  

Outside, the wind howled, carrying the scent of burnt coffee and gunpowder. The facility was a labyrinth of secrets, but tonight, it felt like a stage—one where every shadow had a role to play. <words>197</words>  

The wiry agent picked up the charger plug, its scratches catching the light. "This isn’t just broken," she said. "It’s a key." <words>221</words>  

The therapist nodded, their expression unreadable. "To drain the past, you must first understand its weight." <words>241</words>  

A recruit in the back scoffed. "Or you’re just messing with us." <words>253</words>  

The candle flared, casting elongated shadows that twisted into familiar shapes—a gun, a lock, a hand reaching out. The therapist’s voice dropped to a whisper. "Hindsight is a weapon. Wield it poorly, and it will break you." <words>300</words>  

The wiry agent studied the wax, her breath steady. "And if we wield it well?" <words>315</words>  

"Then you’ll see what others miss," the therapist said. "Even in a scuffed plug." <words>331</words>  

Silence settled, thick as the wax pooling on the floor. The recruits exchanged glances, the weight of the night pressing down. <words>353</words>  

The therapist stood, their movements deliberate. "Dawn comes soon. Decide what you’ll carry forward—and what you’ll leave behind." <words>379</words>  

As they left, the wiry agent pocketed the charger plug, its peculiar edges a reminder of the choices ahead. The sound of hindsight echoed in her mind, a melody of regret and resolve. <words>418</words>  

Outside, the first light of day crept over the horizon, but the night’s lessons lingered, etched in wax and memory. The facility exhaled, its secrets still intact, its agents forever changed. <words>460</words>  

And somewhere, a candle burned low, its final drip forming a single word: "Begin." <words>475</words>  

The wiry agent smiled, the merry bitterness of the night now a compass in her hands. <words>492</words>
