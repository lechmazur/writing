The tidal power monitoring station stood silent under the moon, its rusted gears groaning like an old man’s bones, while Elias—a naive gambler with a penchant for unspoken bargains—clutched the rustic candle mold to his chest like a stolen relic. <words>38</words>  

He’d come to the dock during candlelit dinners, when the professors from the nearby institute held their rebellious midnight lectures, their voices unhinged and crackling like the wax dripping from his mold. "The tides," one hissed, "are rarely predictable, just like luck." Elias laughed until tears blurred his vision, because he knew he was here to capture one last spark before oblivion swallowed him whole. <words>91</words>  

The mold was his last stake, traded from a fisherman who’d whispered, "It’s not just for candles—it’s for sealing fates." Elias didn’t understand, but he’d nodded anyway, his fingers tracing the grooves where molten wax would harden into something new. Now, as the professors ranted about the ocean’s whims, he pressed the mold against the station’s control panel, as if it could somehow harness the chaos. <words>155</words>  

A gust of salt-laced wind snuffed out the candles, plunging the dock into darkness. The professors’ voices faltered, then erupted into wild cackles. "See?" one cried. "Even light bows to the tide!" Elias’s heart pounded. He’d gambled on storms before, but never like this—never with the weight of a dying man’s hope. He struck a match, its flame flickering in the mold’s hollows, and for a moment, the shadows danced like winning cards. <words>230</words>  

Then the station shuddered. The tide surged, its power flooding the circuits, and the mold grew scalding in his hands. The professors howled, their lectures devolving into nonsense, but Elias couldn’t let go. This was his final bet—that the mold could shape more than wax, that it could forge a chance where none existed. The metal seared his skin, yet he grinned through the pain, laughing tears as the world blurred into sparks and salt. <words>305</words>  

When dawn cracked the horizon, the station was dead, the professors gone. Elias lay on the dock, the mold beside him, now cold and filled with seawater. But in its center glowed a single ember, pulsing like a heartbeat. He cupped it gently, feeling its warmth seep into his blistered palms. It wasn’t victory, but it wasn’t oblivion either. Just a spark, stubborn and alive. <words>383</words>  

The fisherman found him there, staring at the ember. "Told you," he muttered, kicking the mold into the waves. Elias didn’t protest. He’d gambled everything, and the tide had answered in its own unpredictable way. As he walked away, the ember nestled in his pocket, he realized some bargains were never spoken—they were felt, like the pull of the moon, or the weight of a last chance. And that was enough. <words>468</words>
