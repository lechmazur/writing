The scrappy tavern-hand, known only as Pike, clutched the broken collection of seashells in his calloused hands, each fragment whispering of inescapable callings. <words>25</words> The tavern was empty, the usual drunks vanished—perhaps because time itself had gone predictably unpredictable, the sands of time flowing backward like a drunkard’s regrets. <words>50</words> Pike sighed with flippant solemnity, tossing a shell shard into the air; it didn’t fall but hovered, as if caught in the grip of some cosmic joke. <words>75</words>  

Outside, the vacuum chamber garden hummed, its glass walls sealing away the chaos of a world unspooling. <words>95</words> Pike had built it to randomize his fate, to catapult his imagination beyond known realms, but now it felt like a cage. <words>115</words> He stepped into the garden, the air thick with the scent of fossilized roses, and knelt beside the dried-up riverbed. <words>135</words> There, etched in stone, were footprints—not his, not anyone’s he knew—but they moved, shifting like a dance only the earth remembered. <words>160</words>  

“Predictably unpredictable,” Pike muttered, tracing a finger over the grooves. <words>170</words> The shells in his pocket pulsed, their broken edges sharp against his thigh. <words>183</words> He’d stolen them from a sailor who claimed they sang of drowned gods, but Pike knew better—they sang of him. <words>205</words> The riverbed shuddered, the footprints rearranging themselves into a path leading deeper into the garden. <words>225</words>  

Pike followed, his boots crunching on brittle leaves that hadn’t fallen yet—or had already risen. <words>245</words> The vacuum chamber’s walls flickered, showing glimpses of other worlds: a city built on the back of a whale, a library where books ate their readers. <words>275</words> He laughed, a sound like shattered glass, because isn’t that what he’d wanted? To randomize his life until it meant something? <words>300</words>  

But the shells kept singing, their voices fraying his resolve. <words>312</words> The footprints led him to the heart of the garden, where a single, unbroken seashell lay on a pedestal. <words>333</words> Pike reached for it, but the moment his fingers brushed its surface, the garden inverted, the vacuum chamber becoming a vast, starless sky. <words>360</words> The shells in his pocket fused together, whole again, and their song became a scream. <words>378</words>  

He understood then—the inescapable calling wasn’t to escape, but to become. <words>395</words> Pike closed his eyes as the sands of time rushed backward through his veins, and with a grin as sharp as broken porcelain, he let the universe randomize him into something new. <words>425</words>  

The garden was empty now, save for a single fossilized footprint, and the faint, flippant echo of a laugh. <words>445</words>
