The reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper hummed with an energetically lethargic buzz, the vines creeping up shattered glass walls as if magnetized to the past. <words>27</words> Elias, a bluffing swindler with a penchant for blank price tags, leaned against a rusted steel beam, watching the frozen computer screen flicker—its reboot imminent. <words>50</words> He’d come here to bare a truth no one dared to handle, though even he wasn’t sure what that truth was yet. <words>71</words>  

A dropped book shattered the silence, its pages splayed open like wings. <words>82</words> Elias turned to see a woman crouching to retrieve it, her fingers brushing the spine with gentle harshness. <words>96</words> "You’re not supposed to be here," she said, her voice low but not unkind. <words>107</words> Elias grinned, patting the blank price tag pinned to his coat. <words>116</words> "Neither are you, but here we are." <words>122</words>  

The computer screen blinked to life, casting a pale glow over the orchard. <words>133</words> The woman—Lila—nodded toward it. <words>137</words> "That’s been frozen for years. You’re the first person who’s gotten it to restart." <words>150</words> Elias shrugged, though his pulse quickened. <words>157</words> The screen displayed a single word: *Invisible*. <words>164</words>  

Lila’s eyes narrowed. <words>166</words> "You’re here for the allies, aren’t you?" <words>173</words> Elias feigned ignorance, but the weight of her gaze stripped him bare. <words>185</words> The orchard, the skyscraper, even the blank price tag—it was all part of a game he’d thought he was playing alone. <words>203</words> But the invisible allies were real, and they’d been waiting for him. <words>215</words>  

The vines around them trembled, as if magnetized to some unseen force. <words>227</words> Lila stepped closer, her voice a whisper. <words>234</words> "They’ve been here all along. You just had to see them." <words>245</words> Elias exhaled, the truth settling over him like dust. <words>255</words> He’d spent his life bluffing, but now, for the first time, he couldn’t lie. <words>270</words>  

The computer screen flickered again, revealing a map of the skyscraper, its corridors pulsing with light. <words>287</words> Lila held out her hand. <words>291</words> "You wanted the truth. Let’s go." <words>297</words> Elias hesitated, then took it, the orchard humming around them like a living thing. <words>312</words>  

As they stepped forward, the blank price tag fluttered to the ground, its purpose finally fulfilled. <words>328</words> The invisible allies stirred, their presence a quiet roar in the reclaimed silence. <words>342</words> And at the instant the frozen computer finally restarted, Elias understood: some truths weren’t meant to be sold. <words>361</words> They were meant to be lived. <words>366</words>  

The skyscraper groaned, its bones shifting as the orchard’s roots tightened their grip. <words>381</words> Lila squeezed his hand, her touch both gentle and harsh, a reminder that even in decay, there was growth. <words>400</words> Together, they walked toward the pulsing light, the invisible allies guiding their way. <words>415</words>  

Elias didn’t look back. <words>418</words> For once, the swindler had nothing left to bluff. <words>428</words>
