The cyber-templar knelt at the sky burial site, his augmented fingers tracing the worn leather bridle coiled around his wrist like a relic of a world that no longer existed. <words>30</words>  

Above him, vultures circled in a slow, patient frenzy, their shadows fracturing the sunlight into jagged shards—a mirage of safety dissolving under the weight of the coming storm. <words>60</words>  

He had come here to prove something, though the purpose flickered in his mind like refracted light through a prism, scattering into colors he couldn’t name. <words>85</words>  

The templar’s optics hummed, overlaying the barren landscape with data streams, but the numbers lied; they always did. <words>102</words>  

Reality was a collision he could no longer avoid, not after the visions—the ones that came during reading, when the ancient texts whispered of lightning and the folly of defying the sky. <words>134</words>  

His hands trembled with a patiently frantic energy as he unspooled the bridle, its cracked surface humming with residual static. <words>154</words>  

The storm clouds gathered, their underbellies pulsing with violet light, and the templar laughed, a sound edged with euphoric agitation. <words>177</words>  

He had tried to outrun the inevitable, to armor himself in code and steel, but the sky demanded tribute. <words>196</words>  

The first bolt struck the nearby spire, and the templar raised the bridle like a conductor’s baton, its frayed strands catching the charge. <words>219</words>  

Light seared his retinas, but he did not flinch; he had learned to see through the refraction, to bend the storm’s fury back upon itself. <words>243</words>  

The vultures screamed as the energy arced from the bridle, a jagged lance hurled into the heart of the clouds. <words>263</words>  

For a moment, the templar stood at the center of a paradox—both destroyer and conduit, his faith in machinery shattered by the raw power of the elements. <words>290</words>  

The storm recoiled, its own violence turned inward, and the templar’s laughter dissolved into the wind. <words>309</words>  

He had proven nothing, and everything. <words>315</words>  

The bridle smoldered in his grip, its leather now fused to his synthetic flesh, a permanent scar. <words>333</words>  

The vultures descended, their wings casting fleeting shadows over the templar’s bowed head. <words>349</words>  

He had come to reflect lightning back at the storm, but the sky had answered with silence. <words>368</words>  

The mirage of safety was gone, and in its place, only the weight of the unanswered. <words>386</words>  

The templar rose, his systems recalibrating, his purpose no clearer than before. <words>401</words>  

Yet as he walked away from the burial site, the prism of his fractured resolve began, slowly, to align. <words>422</words>  

The storm would return. <words>425</words>  

And so would he. <words>428</words>
