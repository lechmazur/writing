The grumpy crypt caretaker shuffled through the witch's crystal scrying room, his boots scuffing against the ancient floorboards as he clutched the unmarked cardboard tube under his arm. <words>30</words>  

Outside, the stars pulsed like distant wounds, their light filtering through the room's prismatic crystals, casting fractured patterns across the sand mandala at his feet. <words>58</words>  

He had come to quell an uprising within—not of the dead, but of his own memories, multiplying singular like echoes in a hollow chamber. <words>85</words>  

With a sigh, he jiggled the tube, its contents rattling like bones, and knelt beside the mandala, tracing the swirling patterns with a calloused finger. <words>109</words>  

The witch had promised him clarity, but all he felt was the weight of trauma, its importance etched deeper than the grooves in the sand. <words>132</words>  

As stargazing stretched into hours, the crystals hummed, their vibrations aligning with the mandala's design, revealing glimpses of his past—a childhood buried, a love lost, a rage unspent. <words>166</words>  

The tube trembled in his grip, its plain exterior belying the power within: a scroll of names, each one a ghost he’d failed to lay to rest. <words>193</words>  

He unrolled it slowly, the parchment crackling like dry leaves, and watched as the mandala’s patterns shifted, mirroring the chaos in his heart. <words>219</words>  

The uprising was his own—a rebellion of grief, of guilt, of years spent tending to others’ dead while his own lingered, unresolved. <words>243</words>  

The crystals flared, their light intensifying, and for a moment, the room held its breath. <words>258</words>  

Then, with grandiose subtlety, the mandala dissolved, the sand grains scattering like stars flung across the cosmos. <words>278</words>  

The caretaker exhaled, the tension in his shoulders easing as the tube’s weight lessened, its contents now ash on the wind. <words>300</words>  

The witch’s voice, when it came, was a whisper: “Trauma is not a thing to bury, but to release.” <words>320</words>  

He stood, the room’s energy settling around him, and for the first time in decades, he felt the uprising within begin to quiet. <words>342</words>  

The stars outside dimmed, their light no longer accusatory, but companionable—a silent acknowledgment of his reckoning. <words>364</words>  

He left the scrying room, the unmarked tube now empty, its purpose fulfilled. <words>380</words>  

The crypt awaited, its stones cool and forgiving, and as he walked, the patterns of his life no longer seemed like chains, but like the mandala—ever-shifting, ever-renewing. <words>409</words>  

Under the watchful gaze of the night sky, the grumpy caretaker smiled, his heart lighter, his steps surer. <words>428</words>  

The uprising had been quelled, not by force, but by the simple act of facing what he’d long refused to see. <words>450</words>  

And in the witch’s crystals, the sand, and the stars, he found a truth as old as time: trauma, when acknowledged, loses its power to divide. <words>475</words>  

The caretaker closed the crypt door behind him, ready at last to tend to the living—and to himself. <words>495</words>
