The irate smuggler jogged across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his boots kicking up dust that shimmered like fractured stars under the dim glow of emergency lights. <words>30</words>  

He clutched the single chopstick in his fist, its splintered end digging into his palm—a useless relic from a deal gone wrong, now his only weapon. <words>55</words>  

The heart's revolt had begun days ago, a gnawing ache in his chest that no smuggler's logic could silence. <words>75</words>  

It wasn't just the betrayal by his crew or the lost cargo; it was the way the universe had turned abstractly physical, every shadow a threat, every silence a lie. <words>100</words>  

He needed to memorialize this moment, to etch his rage into something permanent before it consumed him. <words>118</words>  

Slowing to a stop, he pulled a tin of bitter tea from his pocket, the last gift from a dead friend, and poured the leaves into his canteen lid. <words>143</words>  

As he swirled the dark liquid, patterns emerged—jagged lines like lightning, a swirl like a hidden waterfall, the very thing he'd been searching for since this nightmare began. <words>170</words>  

The smuggler laughed, a sound as biting as the vacuum of space. <words>180</words>  

He'd spent years chasing profit, but now his motivation had sharpened into a single purpose: to find those waterfalls, rumored to cascade down the cliffs of a forgotten colony, where the water was said to wash away all lies. <words>215</words>  

The chopstick trembled in his grip. <words>219</words>  

He stabbed it into the flight deck's rusted plating, carving the tea leaves' patterns into the metal—a map, a warning, a confession. <words>240</words>  

The spaceport groaned around him, a dying beast protesting his presence. <words>251</words>  

He didn't care. <words>253</words>  

The heart's revolt had become his compass, and the smuggler knew he'd either drown in those waterfalls or let them purify him. <words>274</words>  

With a final glance at his makeshift memorial, he broke into a run again, the chopstick left behind like a grave marker. <words>295</words>  

The tea leaves had shown him the way, and for the first time in years, his steps felt light. <words>313</words>  

The abandoned flight deck faded behind him, its silence replaced by the rhythm of his breath and the distant roar of water he couldn't yet see. <words>338</words>  

He'd trade every stolen credit for that sound. <words>347</words>  

The smuggler's jaw tightened. <words>350</words>  

No more deals, no more lies—just the biting sincerity of a man who'd finally found something worth chasing. <words>370</words>  

The universe had taken everything from him, but it had also given him this: a path, a purpose, and the faintest hope of clean water. <words>394</words>  

He ran faster, the stars above blurring into streaks, as if they too were fleeing toward something better. <words>414</words>  

And in that moment, the irate smuggler understood—the heart's revolt wasn't an end. <words>430</words>  

It was the beginning of a long, desperate sprint toward redemption. <words>441</words>  

The waterfalls awaited. <words>444</words>  

He would not stop. <words>447</words>
