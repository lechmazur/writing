The bruised fighter climbed the creaking stairs to the dusty attic, his knuckles still raw from the last bout, his ribs aching with every breath. <words>30</words>  

The air was thick with the scent of old wood and oil, the only light filtering through a single cracked window, illuminating clockwork animals frozen mid-motion—a lion poised to pounce, a bird with wings spread but never taking flight. <words>70</words>  

Among the relics, a clay pot shard caught his eye, its inscription worn but legible: "To stand for something is to fall for nothing." He traced the words with a calloused finger, the irony bitter on his tongue. <words>110</words>  

He had spent years skillfully incompetent, dodging real fights while pretending to be a champion, his reputation built on lies as fragile as the shard in his hand. <words>140</words>  

Then the dream came—the one he couldn’t forget, no matter how hard he tried. A voice whispering through forgotten dreams, urging him to abduct the truth before it vanished forever. <words>170</words>  

At that very moment, far away, a sculptor’s chisel struck marble for the first time, the sound echoing like a gunshot in his mind. The fighter shuddered, knowing this was no coincidence. <words>200</words>  

His motivation was clear now: to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, to face the man he’d become and shatter him like the clay pot at his feet. <words>230</words>  

The clockwork animals whirred to life around him, their gears clicking like a countdown. The lion turned its head, its glass eyes locking onto his. <words>260</words>  

"You’ve been running," it seemed to say, its voice metallic yet soft, a close distance between judgment and mercy. "But time’s up." <words>290</words>  

The fighter clenched the shard tighter, its edges biting into his palm. Blood dripped onto the attic floor, mixing with the dust. <words>310</words>  

He thought of the inscription again—standing for something. Not for fame, not for the crowd’s cheers, but for the truth he’d buried. <words>340</words>  

The bird’s wings began to flap, stirring the air, and the attic seemed to dissolve around him. He was back in the ring, but this time, his opponent was himself—the liar, the fraud. <words>380</words>  

They circled each other, the fighter and his reflection, until the first punch landed. Pain flared, but it was clean, honest. <words>400</words>  

With each blow, the illusion cracked. The shard in his hand glowed, its inscription burning bright: "To stand for something is to fall for nothing." <words>430</words>  

He understood now. Falling was part of it. Letting go of the lie was the only way to rise. <words>450</words>  

The clockwork animals stilled. The attic was silent. The fighter exhaled, his bruises aching but his heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>480</words>  

Somewhere, the sculptor’s chisel struck again, shaping something new from the raw, unyielding stone. <words>500</words>  

The fighter pocketed the shard and descended the stairs, ready to face the world—not as a champion, but as a man who finally stood for something real. <words>530</words>
