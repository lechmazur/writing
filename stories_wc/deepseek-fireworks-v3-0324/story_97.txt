The fact-minded oracle clutched the brass compass, its needle spinning wildly in the unstable dimension where time curled like smoke. <words>25</words> She had always relied on logic, but now, heartbreak-induced visions flickered at the edges of her sight, forcing her to recompose her understanding of the world. <words>50</words> "Desperately casual," she muttered, smoothing her robes as if the gesture could anchor her in this shifting realm. <words>65</words> The compass had led her here, to the cradle of a whispered minute, where seconds stretched like taffy and forgotten places pulsed just beyond reach. <words>85</words>  

Her motivation was clear: to find those lost corners of existence, the ones erased by indifference or drowned in noise. <words>100</words> Yet the path to empathy was not one she had ever walked willingly—until now. <words>113</words> The visions had shown her the cost of cold certainty: a world fractured by her refusal to feel. <words>128</words> The oracle sighed, her optimism fraying at the edges like a sun-bleached flag. <words>140</words>  

The dimension trembled, its instability mirroring her own unraveling resolve. <words>150</words> She focused on the compass, its brass surface warm against her palm, and willed it to steady. <words>164</words> Instead, it split open, revealing a tiny map etched in light—a route woven from heartbeats and half-remembered dreams. <words>183</words> "Of course," she whispered, her tone teetering between desperation and hope. <words>194</words> The path to empathy was not straight; it was a labyrinth of broken things, waiting to be mended. <words>210</words>  

She stepped forward, and the ground beneath her feet dissolved into a river of stars. <words>222</words> The visions returned, sharper now: a child’s abandoned laughter, a bridge crumbling from neglect, a door left ajar in a house no one visited. <words>243</words> Each image was a weight, but she carried them, recomposing her heart around their jagged edges. <words>258</words> The oracle laughed, a sound both bright and brittle. <words>267</words> How ironic that she, who had always sought answers, now found herself in a place where questions were the only compass. <words>286</words>  

Time stuttered, the whispered minute stretching into an eternity. <words>295</words> She could feel the forgotten places drawing closer, their presence like a sigh against her skin. <words>310</words> The brass compass had been a guide, but the real navigation had been inward—a journey she’d resisted until the visions left her no choice. <words>331</words> With a deep breath, she let go of certainty, embracing the unstable dimension as a reflection of her own transformation. <words>350</words>  

The oracle’s desperation softened into something lighter, something almost like grace. <words>362</words> She moved forward, not with the rigid steps of logic, but with the tentative hope of someone learning to trust the unknown. <words>381</words> The path to empathy was not a destination; it was the act of walking itself, of feeling the ground shift and choosing to keep going. <words>401</words> And as the forgotten places welcomed her at last, she realized they had been waiting not for a fact-minded seer, but for a heart willing to break and heal in equal measure. <words>428</words>  

The dimension stabilized, just for a moment, as if honoring her quiet triumph. <words>440</words> The oracle smiled, her optimism no longer desperate but earned, and stepped into the light. <words>454</words>
