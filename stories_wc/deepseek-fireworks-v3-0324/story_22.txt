The small-town librarian, Elara Voss, was perfectly flawed—a woman who could recite every myth in the canyon’s archives but couldn’t remember where she’d left her keys. <words>28</words> The portal-strewn canyon outside her library hummed with ancient carvings, their whispers threading through generations of silent watchers, and Elara longed to join them—not as a keeper of stories, but as one whispered through time. <words>62</words> Her chance came when a stolen museum artifact tag fluttered into her hands, its inscription hinting at a way to harvest grace from the canyon’s chaos. <words>90</words>  

“Grace isn’t given,” she muttered with mocking sincerity, tracing the tag’s jagged edges. “It’s taken.” <words>107</words> The artifact it once labeled—a relic said to dismantle the barriers between worlds—was hidden somewhere in the canyon, and Elara knew the silent watchers were counting on her to find it. <words>138</words> She packed a satchel with dried figs, the one food she and the watchers shared a love for, their sweetness a secret language across time. <words>166</words>  

The canyon greeted her with a gust of wind that smelled of old parchment and burnt sugar. <words>184</words> Portals flickered like mirages, their edges lined with carvings of figures mid-dance—or mid-fall. <words>200</words> Elara pressed a fig to the lips of one carving, and the stone warmed beneath her fingers. <words>218</words> “Tell me,” she whispered, “how to harvest what the canyon hoards.” <words>234</words> The carving split open, revealing a tunnel. <words>242</words>  

Inside, the air thrummed with the weight of stolen time. <words>253</words> The artifact—a jagged shard of obsidian—pulsed on a pedestal, its power to dismantle worlds humming like a trapped wasp. <words>276</words> Elara reached for it, but the watchers’ voices coiled around her: “You’ll break more than barriers.” <words>297</words> She hesitated, then bit into a fig, letting its sweetness anchor her. <words>314</words> Legends weren’t made by the cautious. <words>322</words>  

She grabbed the shard. <words>326</words> The canyon screamed. <words>329</words> Portals snapped shut like eyes, and the carvings wept dust. <words>342</words> Elara stumbled back, the shard’s grace burning her palms—not a gift, but a theft. <words>360</words> The watchers’ silence now felt like judgment. <words>370</words>  

Outside, the canyon was just a canyon again, its magic gutted. <words>386</words> Elara tucked the artifact tag into her pocket, her dream of becoming a legend suddenly bitter. <words>406</words> She’d harvested grace, but it tasted like guilt. <words>418</words> The figs in her satchel had turned to ash. <words>429</words>  

Years later, children would point to the carvings and whisper of the librarian who’d dared too much. <words>450</words> Elara, now one of the silent watchers, would press a fig to the stone and say nothing at all. <words>470</words>
