The sound engineer, a man both clumsily dexterous and fiercely private, stood in the witch's cauldron room, where the walls hummed with forgotten frequencies. <words>28</words> His fingers brushed a stained glass fragment, its colors shifting like a muted scream, and he knew it was time for silent retribution. <words>50</words> Outside, the hush of a freshly erased chalkboard settled over the city, a fleeting silence he had engineered himself. <words>72</words> The crowd’s roar had become unbearable, their voices a cacophony he could no longer mute with mere technology. <words>92</words>  

He stepped into the public square, where faces turned to him, expectant. <words>104</words> With a sigh, he began his critique of their noise, not with words, but through pantomime—a language of exaggerated gestures and stifled cries. <words>129</words> His movements were deliberate yet awkward, a dance of practical illusion, as if he were tuning an invisible dial to soften the world’s volume. <words>154</words> The crowd watched, confused but captivated, their murmurs fading like echoes in a cavern. <words>173</words>  

The stained glass fragment in his pocket grew warm, its power seeping into his bones. <words>190</words> He had stolen it from the cauldron room, where the witch had brewed not potions, but silence—a weapon she’d never used. <words>212</words> Now, he wielded it clumsily, his fingers fumbling as he pressed it against his throat. <words>229</words> The crowd’s voices dissolved into whispers, then nothing at all. <words>243</words>  

But silence, he realized too late, was not peace. <words>252</words> The people’s eyes widened in panic, their mouths moving soundlessly, their hands clutching at their throats. <words>271</words> He had hushed the roar, but in its place rose something worse: the weight of their unspoken rage. <words>291</words>  

Back in the cauldron room, the witch’s laughter echoed, though she was long gone. <words>309</words> The engineer slumped against the wall, the fragment slipping from his grasp. <words>325</words> His motives had been pure—to restore balance, to quiet the chaos—but his methods had been flawed. <words>345</words> Clumsy hands, after all, could not craft delicate solutions. <words>358</words>  

As the first screams broke through the silence, he understood his mistake. <words>373</words> Retribution was not his to deliver, and the crowd’s roar was not his to silence. <words>390</words> The stained glass shattered at his feet, its colors bleeding into the floor, and the world’s noise rushed back in—a tide he could no longer control. <words>417</words>  

In the end, the engineer walked away, his head bowed, his hands empty. <words>433</words> The square buzzed with life, louder than ever, and he knew he would never again try to hush it. <words>454</words> Some roars, he thought, were meant to be heard. <words>465</words>
