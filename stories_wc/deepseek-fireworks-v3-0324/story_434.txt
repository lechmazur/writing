The lonely ringleader adjusted his cracked top hat in the dim glow of the ghost story recording booth, his reflection warped in the glass partition like a specter watching from the other side. <words>34</words>  

Between whispered confessions of past failures, he pressed a stained napkin to his lips, the fabric smelling of burnt sugar and something older, something like ancestral wisdom seeping through the fibers. <words>70</words>  

"Tonight," he murmured, his voice a playful rasp, "we outmaneuver the inevitable." The artifact in his pocket hummed, a thing of gears and teeth, inexplicable even to him—but he’d sworn to guard it, no matter the cost. <words>115</words>  

The booth’s gravity generator sputtered, and suddenly, the flame of his candle detached, dancing in zero gravity like a mischievous spirit. He grinned, though dread coiled in his gut. This was how it had to be done: by the dance of a flame in zero gravity, where logic frayed and secrets unraveled. <words>178</words>  

The artifact pulsed again, and the ringleader’s laughter echoed, hollow yet bright. "Commonly individual, aren’t we?" he asked the flame, as if it might answer. The booth’s walls groaned, whispering back in languages long forgotten. <words>228</words>  

He spun the napkin between his fingers, the stains forming patterns only he could read—maps, maybe, or warnings. His ancestors had left him this much: a way to see what others couldn’t. But knowledge was a slippery thing, and the artifact heavier with every passing second. <words>287</words>  

The flame pirouetted, casting shadows that slithered up the walls. The ringleader matched its movements, his feet barely touching the ground. Out here, between gravity and void, he was both hunter and prey. The artifact’s hum rose to a whine. Time was running out. <words>349</words>  

"Playful dread," he whispered, "that’s the trick of it." The flame flared, and for a moment, he saw them—the faces of those who’d come before, their voices tangled in the static of the recording booth. They’d tried to guard the artifact too. They’d failed. <words>410</words>  

But he was different. He had the napkin, the dance, the flame. And when the artifact finally shuddered, its gears locking into place, he let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. The booth’s gravity returned, the flame settling back into the candle with a sigh. <words>480</words>  

The ringleader slumped into his chair, the artifact silent at last. Outside, the world moved on, oblivious. He tucked the stained napkin into his pocket, next to the relic, and smiled. For now, it was safe. For now, so was he. <words>530</words>
