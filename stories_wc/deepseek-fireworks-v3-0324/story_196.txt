The tired swordsman slumped onto a wooden bench in the floating rock monastery’s breakroom, his blade leaning against the wall like a discarded thought. <words>30</words> The air smelled of stale incense and resignation—fitting, since Brother Kael had just left his post, murmuring something about "the weight of the sky." <words>60</words> The swordsman sighed, rubbing his calloused fingers over a plain cloth bag tied to his belt, its contents known only to him. <words>85</words>  

He was fiercely apathetic about most things—monastery politics, the churning void beneath the rocks, even the way the stars blinked at him like judgmental eyes. <words>115</words> But tonight, he’d overcome that numbness. <words>122</words> A hidden promise, made years ago in the dark, prickled at his ribs like the spark of defiance he’d long suppressed. <words>145</words>  

The monks had always said meteor showers were omens, but he knew better—they were paths. <words>163</words> By following their trails, he’d find the way down, off this floating prison of piety and into the world he’d abandoned. <words>188</words> The thought carried a knowing naivety, as if he understood the futility yet clung to it anyway. <words>208</words>  

He untied the bag, revealing a handful of jagged star-metal shards, cold to the touch. <words>226</words> They’d fallen years ago, the night he’d sworn to leave. <words>237</words> Now, with the sky about to weep fire again, he’d use them to weigh himself down, to fall purposefully instead of floating endlessly. <words>265</words>  

The breakroom’s silence was shattered by a distant rumble—the first meteor streaking across the indigo. <words>285</words> He stood, gripping the shards tighter, their edges biting into his palm. <words>300</words> Pain was a reminder: he was still alive, still capable of wanting something. <words>318</words>  

Outside, the monastery’s edges blurred into the abyss. <words>329</words> He stepped onto the outermost rock, the void yawning beneath him. <words>342</words> The meteors came faster now, their light painting his face in fleeting gold. <words>360</words> He counted under his breath, timing his jump to follow the brightest trail. <words>377</words>  

The monks would call it madness. <words>383</words> He called it a choice. <words>388</words> With a deep breath, he leaped, the shards in his bag pulling him toward the earth like an anchor. <words>410</words> The wind roared in his ears, the monastery shrinking above him, its rocks like teeth against the sky. <words>431</words>  

As he fell, he laughed—not from joy, but from the sheer absurdity of it all. <words>448</words> For the first time in years, he felt awake. <words>458</words> The promise was his alone, and now, so was the fall. <words>473</words> The meteors blazed around him, lighting his way home. <words>487</words>  

The ground rushed up to meet him, but he didn’t flinch. <words>499</words> He’d kept his word, and that was enough. <words>508</words>
