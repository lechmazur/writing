The ethereal plains stretched endlessly, their golden grasses whispering the song of boundaries—a melody only the apocalyptic farmer seemed to hear. <words>28</words> He knelt in the dust, fingers pressing new seeds into the cracked earth, each one a rebellion against the life dictated by the last resource war. <words>52</words> The world had burned, but he refused to let it die. <words>62</words>  

In his pocket, the magician’s deck of trick cards hummed, their edges frayed from use. <words>77</words> They were typically atypical, like him—tools of illusion repurposed for survival. <words>90</words> He’d found them in the ruins of a circus, their former owner long gone. <words>104</words> Now, they marked the rows where his seeds would grow, their symbols a silent jabber to the wind. <words>123</words>  

The sea, miles away, still spoke to him. <words>130</words> Bottles washed ashore, carrying messages from those who’d tried to escape. <words>143</words> Most were pleas; some were curses. <words>149</words> He read them all, their words etching themselves into his bones. <words>160</words> One, sealed with wax the color of blood, held a map to a place beyond the plains. <words>177</words> He kept it tucked between the cards, a secret even the sky couldn’t pry loose. <words>194</words>  

Days bled into nights, the farmer’s hands never still. <words>203</words> His crops sprouted twisted and vibrant, defying the barren world. <words>215</words> The song of boundaries grew louder, a raw solace in the silence. <words>227</words> He wondered if the sea’s messages were warnings or invitations. <words>238</words> The deck of cards shuffled itself in his dreams, whispering of a path only he could walk. <words>254</words>  

One evening, as the horizon swallowed the sun, he packed his seeds and the cards into a frayed satchel. <words>274</words> The map called him, its lines pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>284</words> He left the plains behind, their grasses still singing, their boundaries now his to cross. <words>300</words> The bottles had promised escape, but he knew the truth—he was chasing more than freedom. <words>318</words> He was chasing the chance to grow something new. <words>328</words>  

The magician’s deck spilled from his pocket as he walked, cards fluttering like leaves. <words>343</words> He didn’t stop to collect them. <words>349</words> Let them mark the way for the next wanderer. <words>357</words> The song of boundaries faded, replaced by the salt-kissed wind of the sea. <words>371</words> Ahead, the sky met the water, and the farmer smiled. <words>382</words>  

He waded into the waves, the last message bottle bobbing at his feet. <words>395</words> Inside, he placed a single seed and his own scrawled words: *"Grow where they tell you cannot."* <words>413</words> He sealed it and let the current take it. <words>423</words> The deck of cards was gone, the plains a memory, but the song lingered—a melody of defiance, carried by the sea. <words>445</words>  

The farmer walked on, the world’s weight lighter now. <words>454</words> He’d escaped the life they’d carved for him, and in its place, he’d planted hope. <words>469</words> The ethereal plains would remember him, but the future? That was his to sow. <words>484</words>
