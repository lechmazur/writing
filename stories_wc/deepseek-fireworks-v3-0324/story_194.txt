The spirited lumberjack, Elias, pedaled his rusted bike through the misty forest, his ax strapped to his back like a relic of another life. <words>30</words> His calloused hands gripped the handlebars, each bump in the path jostling the coded letter tucked in his pocket—a cryptic message from a future war, its symbols bleeding through the paper like ghosts. <words>60</words> He’d found it in the ancient ossuary, now a gourmet restaurant where the wealthy dined among stacked bones, their laughter echoing off skulls polished to a gleam. <words>90</words>  

Elias was gracefully awkward, his brute strength at odds with the delicate way he handled the letter, as if it might dissolve like a dream. <words>115</words> The nightmares had returned, fragments of a war he’d never fought, yet felt etched into his marrow. <words>132</words> Through reawakened nightmares, he’d glimpsed the hidden agendas of the restaurant’s owner, a man who served delicacies atop tombstones while whispering secrets to shadowy figures. <words>160</words>  

His bike rides had become a ritual, a way to revamp his fractured mind, to stitch together the past and the future. <words>183</words> But the real reason he returned to the ossuary was to learn healing traditions—the old ways his grandmother had hummed about, lost to time and greed. <words>210</words> The owner, a man with a smile like a scalpel, claimed to know them, but Elias sensed the lie beneath his honeyed words. <words>235</words>  

One evening, as Elias deciphered the letter’s symbols by candlelight, the truth unfurled: the war was coming, and the ossuary was its cradle. <words>263</words> The owner wasn’t just a purveyor of fine dining but a architect of chaos, trading bones for weapons, his hidden agendas wrapped in linen napkins. <words>290</words> Elias’s hands shook—not from fear, but from a harsh tenderness, the kind that fuels a man to break what he loves to save it. <words>320</words>  

He revamped his plan. <words>323</words> No more passive watching. <words>326</words> The next bike ride would be his last. <words>333</words> He’d storm the ossuary, not with his ax, but with the coded letter as proof, its symbols a map to the owner’s undoing. <words>360</words> The nightmares had shown him the cost of silence, and Elias, ever the lumberjack, knew how to fell a rotten tree. <words>385</words>  

As he pedaled toward the glowing windows of the restaurant, the wind carried the scent of roasted meat and old bones. <words>410</words> His heart pounded, not with grace, but with the clumsy resolve of a man who’d finally seen the path. <words>435</words> The future war loomed, but tonight, Elias would plant the first seed of its ruin. <words>455</words> And perhaps, in the ashes, he’d find the healing traditions he’d been searching for all along. <words>480</words>
