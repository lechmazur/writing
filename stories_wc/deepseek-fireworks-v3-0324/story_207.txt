The abandoned space station medical bay hummed with the secret song of the universe, its flickering lights casting long shadows over the forthright peddler as he sifted through rumor-laden gossip columns. <words>34</words> His fingers, calloused from years of trading trinkets across the stars, paused over a faded headline: "Blood Oath Broken—Redemption’s Path Revealed." <words>64</words> A dried flower bouquet, brittle with age, lay beside him, its petals whispering of a promise he could no longer keep. <words>88</words>  

He had sworn an oath sealed in blood, a vow to never return to this derelict station, yet here he was, meekly assertive in his defiance. <words>116</words> The peddler divided his attention between the gossip columns and the bouquet, each a fragment of a past he longed to rewrite. <words>137</words> The flowers had been a gift from her, a token of love before the war tore them apart. <words>156</words> Now, they were all he had left—that and the rumors of her survival. <words>171</words>  

The medical bay’s sterile walls echoed with joyful loneliness, a paradox that suited him. <words>187</words> He had always been alone, even in crowds, but the hope of finding her again filled the emptiness with a quiet euphoria. <words>210</words> The gossip columns spoke of a woman matching her description, last seen near the station’s wreckage. <words>229</words> It was a thin lead, but the peddler clung to it, his heart pounding with the rhythm of the universe’s hidden melody. <words>252</words>  

He divided the bouquet into single stems, each one a step on his path to redemption. <words>269</words> One for the oath he broke, one for the love he lost, and one for the future he dared to imagine. <words>290</words> The peddler’s forthright nature had always been his strength, but now it was his vulnerability—he could no longer lie to himself about what he wanted. <words>318</words>  

As he stood, the station shuddered, its ancient frame groaning under the weight of time. <words>336</words> The universe’s song grew louder, a chorus of stars urging him forward. <words>351</words> He tucked the gossip columns into his coat, the dried flowers into his pocket, and stepped into the corridor. <words>371</words> The path ahead was uncertain, but for the first time in years, he felt alive. <words>389</words>  

The peddler’s journey was no longer about survival; it was about breaking free. <words>405</words> The blood oath had been a chain, but the rumors—and the flowers—were his keys. <words>422</words> He would find her, or die trying, and in that pursuit, he would reclaim the pieces of himself he’d thought lost forever. <words>445</words> The abandoned station faded behind him, its secrets swallowed by the cosmos, as the universe hummed its approval. <words>467</words>  

Joyful loneliness gave way to something brighter, something like hope. <words>480</words> The peddler smiled, his heart light, and stepped into the stars. <words>493</words>
