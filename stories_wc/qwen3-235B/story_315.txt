The spiritual con artist tripped over a coiled cable in the quantum entanglement lab, his frayed sleeves snagging on a humming machine as he caught himself—a man who spoke in parables but moved like a marionette with cut strings. <words>28</words>  
He clutched a simple glass jar lid, its edges worn smooth by decades of hands opening and closing secrets, and declared it “the threshold between containment and chaos” to the wide-eyed interns. <words>56</words>  
His motivation was neither money nor malice but the itch to laugh in the face of the inevitable dawn, to watch the sun rise on a world he’d convinced himself was a punchline. <words>84</words>  
The lab’s director, desperate to validate her theory of reversed moments, hadn’t questioned his credentials—only the way he’d described the lid as “a mirror for timelines, reflecting what never was and what cannot be.” <words>114</words>  
Eloquently clumsy, he bumbled through equations scrawled on whiteboards, his ink-stained fingers flipping variables like coins, while the lid sat inert, a silent accomplice to his theatrics. <words>143</words>  
When the machine finally roared to life, spitting out spirals of blue light, he didn’t flinch as reality stuttered—his own past rejiggered mid-sentence, his birth certificate now listing a different mother, his scars shifting allegiance to new wounds. <words>175</words>  
The interns screamed as their coffee cooled to steam, then froze to ice; the con artist only grinned, raising the lid like a communion wafer. “Truth’s a bargain-bin prophet,” he drawled. “You get what you pay for.” <words>206</words>  
But the price mounted: the director’s face aged decades between heartbeats, the walls exhaled rust, and the lid began to crack, its fractures mapping the ghost of every choice never made. <words>236</words>  
He knew the method—reverse the polarity of the moments they’d stolen, eject the core before the lab collapsed into its own primordial data—but it required a sacrifice, a body to unspool from the timestream like thread. <words>267</words>  
With a wink and a pratfall that sent three monitors clattering, he hurled the lid into the vortex, letting its shards slice through the equations he’d never truly understood. <words>295</words>  
The explosion blew him backward, his laughter lingering as his form dissolved, molecule by molecule, into the static of a universe that preferred its punchlines dead. <words>323</words>  
They found the director weeping atop a pile of ash, the jar lid reassembled whole on her desk, its surface reflecting nothing at all—a perfect, silent punchline. <words>351</words>  
And in the quiet, they almost heard him still laughing, the echo of a man who’d bet against dawn and lost, yet somehow won by refusing to care. <words>380</words>  
The interns quit the next week. The lab closed by autumn. But sometimes, late at night, the machines flicker, and a voice slurred by static recites koans about glass and greed and the cost of seeing. <words>413</words>  
The inevitable dawn arrived, as it always does, but it rose on a world slightly lighter—his joke, etched in the space between quarks, outlasting even the truth. <words>445</words>
