<story>  
The careless pilot, Calla, had always flown by instinct, not charts, her leather glove—frayed at the knuckles—clutching the yoke of her battered biplane as if it owed her money. <words>22</words>  
She’d crash-landed in the enchanted oak grove during the lull between echoing thunder and fresh rain, the storm’s breath still shivering through the twisted orchard labyrinth. <words>44</words>  
Now, she wandered its thorn-choked paths, the glove’s faded stitching brushing against mossy trunks, each touch flickering borrowed memories—not hers, but a chorus of lost travelers whose despair clung to the bark. <words>70</words>  
She’d meant to archive the grove’s natural patterns, its fractal leaves and spiraled roots, but the postcards scattered near her plane’s wreckage had shifted her purpose: crude doodles of eyes, teeth, and compass arrows, sinister and deliberate. <words>105</words>  
The doodles glowed faintly, humming a lullaby in a language forgotten by dawn; Calla recognized the script from her own dreams, the same symbols etched into the glove’s inner seam. <words>132</words>  
Resigned exuberance thrummed in her chest—a pilot’s paradox, her father had called it, the thrill of flight shadowed by the certainty of falling. <words>155</words>  
She followed the postcards deeper, each step unraveling memories: a child lost here a century prior, a botanist’s final journal entry, a WWI soldier’s ghost retracing his parachute’s descent. <words>184</words>  
The labyrinth coiled tighter, roots arching like ribs over her head, until she found the heart—a clearing where an ancient oak cradled a postcard larger than herself, its doodles bleeding into life. <words>214</words>  
The glove pulsed against her palm as she touched it, and the borrowed memories surged: the grove’s keeper, a woman with Calla’s own face, imprisoned here for stealing time’s natural rhythm. <words>243</words>  
Emancipation required a trade, the grove whispered—a pattern for a pattern. <words>257</words>  
Calla laughed, dreamy and desperate, and peeled off the glove, pressing her bare hand to the postcard. <words>274</words>  
Her own memories flooded out—the crash, her father’s voice, the way sunlight fractured through clouds at 10,000 feet—seeding the grove with her truth in exchange for the trapped souls’ freedom. <words>304</words>  
The oak shuddered, its branches shedding postcards like autumn leaves, each bearing her memories now, its labyrinth unspooling into a straight path homeward. <words>332</words>  
She left the glove behind, a relic for the next careless wanderer, and walked into the rain, her mind aching with borrowed silence, the thunder’s echo finally fading. <words>361</words>  
The grove’s new patterns—the arcs of her flight, the tremor of her hand—were archived not in ink, but in the air itself, a map only the lost would understand. <words>390</words>  
Calla’s boots squelched through mud as the storm’s remnants dissolved, her plane’s mangled frame visible ahead, the world beyond the grove blindingly ordinary. <words>417</words>  
She glanced back, half-expecting the trees to follow, but the labyrinth had already forgotten her, its keeper’s face dissolving into the roots, its postcards waiting for another hand. <words>445</words>  
The rain stopped. Calla smiled, resigned and radiant, and flew. <words>457</words>
