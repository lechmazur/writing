The cranky oracle squinted at the abandoned terrarium, its glass fogged with age, and muttered a curse that tasted like dust. <words>12</words>  
Sunset bled through the secret society chamber’s cracked skylight, gilding the room just long enough for the ritual to begin. <words>21</words>  
He’d spent decades chronicling ancient patterns in lies, weaving prophecies that bent truth into shapes only the desperate would swallow. <words>33</words>  
The terrarium, virtually rare and humming with trapped malice, was the last relic of a civilization that had mastered deception so thoroughly it devoured itself. <words>47</words>  
To resettle its venomous heart beneath the city’s foundations, he needed a key: the glimmer of battered dog tags he’d glimpsed that morning in a pawn shop’s tarnished drawer. <words>60</words>  
The tags belonged to a dead informer, their etched coordinates a map to the terrarium’s new prison—or so the oracle lied to the three apprentices shivering at his elbows. <words>74</words>  
“The art of deception,” he rasped, tapping the glass, “isn’t about trickery. It’s about knowing what people *need* to believe.” <words>85</words>  
One apprentice, too clever for her own good, narrowed her eyes. “And what do *you* need to believe, Oracle?” <words>95</words>  
He ignored her, prying open the terrarium’s lid. A plume of rancid air hissed out, carrying whispers in a language that predates words. <words>106</words>  
The dog tags, he knew, were a decoy; the true key was the apprentice’s doubt, sharpened by her hunger to unseat him. <words>116</words>  
As the sunset curdled to violet, he fed the terrarium a strand of his own hair, a sacrifice to fool the ancient thing inside into thinking it was safe to move. <words>130</words>  
“You chronicle patterns,” she said, stepping closer, “but you never break them. Why?” <words>138</words>  
The oracle laughed, bitter and loud. “Because the moment you break a pattern, you become the thing you’re trying to stop.” <words>151</words>  
He tossed the dog tags into the terrarium, where they dissolved into a liquid shimmer that pooled at the bottom like poisoned mercury. <words>161</words>  
The apprentices recoiled, but the chamber’s stone walls began to pulse, aligning with the rhythm of a heartbeat only the oracle could hear. <words>172</words>  
“You lied about the tags,” the clever one whispered, her voice a blade. “What’s the real price?” <words>182</words>  
The terrarium cracked, then, and the oracle plunged his hands into its fissures, letting the ancient thing inside gnaw on his bones. <words>193</words>  
“Deception’s art,” he gritted out, blood speckling his lips, “is knowing which lies keep the world from burning.” <words>204</words>  
The apprentices screamed as the chamber’s floor yawned open, swallowing the terrarium—and the oracle—with a sigh that smelled of petrichor and rot. <words>216</words>  
When the dust settled, the clever one knelt where he’d vanished, clutching a single dog tag, its engraving now legible: *Trust nothing. Not even this.* <words>229</words>  
She pocketed it, smiling through the lie of her tears, and began to write. <words>236</words>
