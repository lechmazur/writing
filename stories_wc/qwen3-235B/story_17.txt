The guilt-ridden black market genealogist traced the chipped bowl’s origin to a funeral eulogy from 1893, its subtext whispering of stolen lineage and a witch’s curse. <words>17</words>  
Each morning, Lira walked the fog-draped cemetery, her fingers brushing gravestones as she dissected eulogies for secrets—her atypically typical ritual to atone for peddling forged histories. <words>35</words>  
The bowl, cracked like a fractured apology, sat on her workbench, its glaze a mosaic of cobalt and regret; she’d stolen it from a client’s attic, a relic of their erased ancestry. <words>54</words>  
Beneath a skeletal oak, she zoomed through microfilm archives, her projector casting flickering shadows that danced like specters in the witch’s incantation chamber she’d rented above a bakery. <words>73</words>  
The chamber smelled of burnt sage and sour dough, its walls lined with jars of moth wings and thyme—mundane yet potent, a place where brazen modesty thrived amid her whispered incantations to the dead. <words>93</words>  
A eulogy for a midwife hanged as a witch revealed the bowl’s purpose: a vessel to trap sorrow, its chip a flaw that let grief leak, rendering it useless to those who’d buried it. <words>113</words>  
Lira’s hands trembled; she’d sold such artifacts for profit, never considering their weight in souls, until a client’s tear-streaked face mirrored her own mother’s final, unforgiven silence. <words>133</words>  
At dawn, she returned to the cemetery, the bowl cradled in her coat, its chip catching the light like a half-formed promise as crows erupted from the trees, their wings a thunderous zoom. <words>153</words>  
She knelt at the midwife’s unmarked grave, pouring moonwell water into the bowl, its surface rippling with faces of the forgotten—her forgeries, her victims, her kin. <words>172</words>  
The water stilled, reflecting Lira’s scarred wrists, the ink of falsified birth certificates now faded, and in that shimmer, she heard the midwife’s voice: “Renewal begins where shame ends.” <words>192</words>  
A wind tore through the chamber that night, the bowl levitating as eulogies she’d hoarded ignited in a pyre, their ashes spelling names she’d once erased in smoke. <words>210</words>  
Lira walked home, the horizon bruised with pre-dawn violet, her breath visible as a vow: no more alchemy of lies, only the slow work of unburying truth. <words>229</words>  
The chipped bowl now held a sprig of rosemary on her windowsill, its crack a conduit for light, for the atypically typical woman who’d become both gravedigger and gardener in the same breath. <words>249</words>  
When the bakery owner asked why she stared at the sky each morning, Lira smiled, her guilt a compass, not a chain: “Waiting for the crows to tell me I’m forgiven.” <words>268</words>  
They never spoke, but the birds circled daily, their shadows stitching her to the earth, to the brink of renewal, to the quiet audacity of beginning again. <words>287</words>
