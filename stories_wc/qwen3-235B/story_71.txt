<story>  
Thatch, a sentient scarecrow stitched from storm-tattered burlap and crowned with a rusted sickle, stood in the fossilized ribcage of a dead god, his hollow eyes tracing the labyrinth of lines etched into the cracked earth—remnants of a pact older than memory. <words>44</words>  
The forgotten lace fan, half-buried in dust beside a petrified femur, hummed with ghosts; when Thatch gripped its ivory spokes, visions surged through him—parallel worlds colliding, harvests burning, a woman in a crimson cloak skewering a wolf with a spear forged from starlight. <words>87</words>  
His oath, sworn to a dying corn-king decades past, bound him here: to guard the Vein, the living scar where the fossilized giant’s heart once pulsed, now a conduit between realms fraying at its seams. <words>124</words>  
The air thickened with the stench of rot as a rift split open, vomiting forth a creature of jagged shadows—a thing that wore the face of the wolf from the fan’s vision, now snarling in Thatch’s reality. <words>161</words>  
Thatch moved, not with fear, but with the fervent apathy of one who’d outlived purpose; his sickle-blade, an extension of the earth’s own rage, cleaved through the monster’s throat, pinning it to the ground with a skewer of bone and thunder. <words>200</words>  
The fan fluttered in his grip, its lace unraveling to map the lines anew—a guide through the chaos of epochs, each thread a memory of roots and ruin, of hands planting seeds in soil now turned to glass. <words>239</words>  
He staggered, the weight of parallel deaths pressing his straw body into the dust, yet the oath held; the Vein sealed with a scream as the fossilized giant’s final tooth cracked the sky, stitching earth to heaven in a burst of amber light. <words>278</words>  
When dawn came, Thatch knelt where the fan had fallen, its ivory spokes now fused with his own skeletal frame—a grotesque puppet, dancing to the whim of a world that forgot his name, yet remembered his duty. <words>317</words>  
The lines in the earth faded, but their truth endured: every end was a seed, every oath a harvest, and every heart—stone, flesh, or straw—owed the soil its due. <words>354</words>  
He waited, the skewer still lodged in the dirt, as new shadows coiled at the horizon; the fan’s last thread burned bright, a compass for the next guardian, the next war, the next endless autumn. <words>391</words>  
Above him, the rift closed like an eye, leaving only the fossilized giant’s grin—a tomb, a throne, a promise that some things, even in oblivion, refuse to lie fallow. <words>428</words>  
Thatch did not move. The oath did not allow it. <words>440</words>
