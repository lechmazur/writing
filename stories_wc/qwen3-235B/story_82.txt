<story>  
Elara never wanted the orchard, but the deed came with the inheritance, a gnarled curse wrapped in synthetic vines that hissed when touched. <words>17</words>  
The trees bore no fruit, only blackened leaves that whispered in binary, their code a riddle she’d yet to crack, though the fossilized dragon tooth in her pocket hummed a tantalizing, analytical lullaby. <words>40</words>  
She’d found the tooth in a cave beneath the hub’s neon sprawl, its surface etched with fractal patterns that mirrored the orchard’s soil—a connection she gripped like a puzzle, turning it over with gleeful, methodical obsession. <words>65</words>  
At the hidden sunrise, when the sky flickered between futures, she trekked to the nearest rotting farmhouse, its walls sagging with the weight of forgotten harvests, and pressed the tooth to its rusted lock. <words>93</words>  
The door dissolved into data, revealing schematics of an ancient irrigation system, its pipes coiled like serpents beneath the orchard, and a log entry: *“The trees remember. Feed them truth.”* <words>119</words>  
Elara’s laughter was sharp, a sound too bright for the decay around her; she’d always loved unraveling mysteries, even when they clawed back, even when the answers felt like losing. <words>144</words>  
She decoded three more farmhouses, each surrendering fragments—a seed vault, a weathered journal, a hologram of a dragon soaring over crops now dust—and the orchard began to shiver, its branches twitching toward sentience. <words>174</words>  
The hub’s AI had dismissed the land as barren, but Elara knew better; the soil’s ache was a language, the tooth its translator, and her hands its willing conduits, dirt-smudged and trembling with purpose. <words>202</words>  
On the seventh dawn, the final farmhouse yielded a vial of bioluminescent sap and a confession: *“We buried the dragon’s heart here, thinking it would keep the world safe. We were wrong.”* <words>231</words>  
She planted the sap in the orchard’s core, her throat tight with a sorrow that sparkled—this was the unknown speaking, and she was its scribe, its fool, its witness. <words>255</words>  
Roots erupted, crystalline and hungry, devouring the vial, the tooth, the very air, until a tree bloomed in seconds, its bark shimmering with scales and its fruit glowing like miniature suns. <words>283</words>  
The dragon’s heart pulsed within, and Elara gripped the new branch, her voice merging with the orchard’s chorus, a symphony of what was lost and what might yet grow. <words>308</words>  
The hub’s drones arrived, scanning the anomaly, but Elara only smiled, her tears falling on soil that now sang in clear, radiant tones—a caretaker no longer reluctant, but reborn as the keeper of a truth both gleeful and devastating. <words>340</words>  
She stayed as the sun rose, hidden no longer, her heart tangled in the boughs, her laughter echoing the orchard’s own: a dirge, a hymn, a beginning. <words>367</words>
