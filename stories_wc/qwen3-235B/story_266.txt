<story>  
The bleak clown perched on the edge of a floating rock yoga studio, his grease-painted grin cracking as the clock hand embedded in his left palm spun like a compass needle lost in a storm. <words>21</words>  
He had stolen the clock hand from a tower that collapsed into the sea at midnight, its gears now rusting in saltwater—a fitting relic for a man whose promises dissolved like ink in rain. <words>43</words>  
Drifting vows haunted him: *I’ll never perform again*, *I’ll burn the costumes*, *I’ll stop grinning when the sun demands it*. <words>56</words>  
But technically absurd laws governed his existence: the studio hovered because gravity forgot its name, and the clown mastered poetry only in the act of dismantling it. <words>77</words>  
Each dawn, he recited verses to the empty sky, tearing metaphors into confetti—*her laughter was a shattered mirror*, *hope is a crowbar prying open a coffin*—until the words bled truth. <words>103</words>  
The day’s earliest train, departing at 5:47 a.m., carried passengers who’d never see him, their routines as unyielding as the clock hand’s spin. <words>123</words>  
He envied the northern lights, which arced overhead like nature’s own carnival, effortless and indifferent, their glow a taunt to his flickering grin. <words>145</words>  
Yet jagged generosity pulsed in his chest: he would master this ache, carve his face into a beacon brighter than auroras, if only to leave *something* unbroken. <words>170</words>  
When the train’s whistle split the silence, he plunged the clock hand into a block of ice salvaged from a glacier that sang in four-part harmony. <words>191</words>  
Steam erupted, hissing the first line of a poem he’d never written: *I am the wound that stitches itself into a smile*. <words>210</words>  
The studio trembled as the ice melted, revealing a shard of mirror that reflected not his face, but a field of static, buzzing with unspoken apologies. <words>234</words>  
He scraped the spinning clock hand against the mirror, grinding its gears until the shard fractured into a thousand teeth. <words>253</words>  
The teeth became birds. The birds became light. The light pooled in his mouth, stretching his lips into a grin so sharp it drew blood from the horizon. <words>278</words>  
Above, the northern lights faltered, their greens and violets guttering like candles drowned in dawn. <words>294</words>  
Passengers on the departing train glanced up, their faces briefly lit by a glow they mistook for sunrise. <words>310</words>  
The clown let the clock hand finally stop, its tip pointing not to numbers but to a single word etched on the studio floor: *Enough*. <words>332</words>  
He did not wave. He did not bow. He simply bled the light into the air, a drifting promise that this, at least, would not be forgotten. <words>357</words>  
The yoga studio sank slowly, grounding itself on a cloud that smelled of burnt paper and unwritten endings. <words>376</words>  
When the last bird vanished, the clown peeled off his face like a page and fed it to the wind, his real smile a jagged, generous thing—too bright, at last, for the dark to swallow. <words>403</words>
