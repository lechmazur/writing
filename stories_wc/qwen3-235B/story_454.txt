The reckless smuggler adjusted his frayed trench coat as he crouched at the haunted amusement park’s funhouse entrance, the air thick with rust and forgotten laughter. <words>17</words>  
His gloved hand tightened around the pressed four-leaf clover sealed in glass—a token from a sister he’d abandoned years ago, her rationally emotional farewell etched in his memory: “Luck isn’t a compass, but it’s all we have.” <words>43</words>  
He’d come here to dramatize his loyalty, to prove to the outsider syndicate—the “Midnight Carousel”—that his maps and nerve could carve paths through the unknown. <words>60</words>  
The syndicate’s leader, a woman with a voice like shattered chimes, had mocked his sentimental relic but admired his precision: “You synchronize those watch alarms, smuggler, or you’ll drown in the dark.” <words>83</words>  
At the spot where his map tore jaggedly, dividing the familiar midway from the shadowed woods beyond, he paused. <words>97</words>  
The clover glinted under a flickering bulb as he set his watch; two sharp beeps echoed from his wrist and, miles away, his contact’s identical alarm would chime—a pact of timing, a thread of distant companionship in the void. <words>127</words>  
He’d once explained the method to his sister: “Alarms aren’t magic. They’re the breath between heartbeats, the split-second when fear forgets to paralyze you.” <words>147</words>  
Now, as the first explosion rattled the funhouse mirrors, he sprinted, the clover’s glass casing warming against his palm like a phantom hand. <words>164</words>  
The syndicate wanted the woods’ hidden vault, a relic of pre-war tech buried where the map frayed. <words>177</words>  
They called it “the prize,” but he knew better—knew the clover’s luck was a lie, that acceptance demanded sacrifice, and the alarms were less about timing than control. <words>200</words>  
Midway through the maze, he triggered the second alarm; the ground shuddered, a hidden door groaning open. <words>213</words>  
Jubilant despair surged in him—the thrill of the heist, the ache of a life measured in stolen seconds, not bonds. <words>228</words>  
When he reached the vault, breath ragged, he found not tech but a child’s diary, pages water-stained and scrawled with maps of imaginary kingdoms. <words>247</words>  
The syndicate’s radio crackled: “You’ve got the package?” He pocketed the diary, lied, and set the final alarm. <words>263</words>  
The explosion collapsed the tunnel, sealing the vault—and his chance to belong. <words>275</words>  
Back at the entrance, dawn bleeding through the fog, he held the clover to the light. <words>287</words>  
It was cracked now, the glass spiderwebbed, but the leaves were still whole—a flawed, stubborn luck. <words>300</words>  
The syndicate would call him a traitor, but his sister’s voice lingered, rational and raw: “You don’t need their map. You’ve got your own.” <words>322</words>  
He walked away from the funhouse, the alarms silent forever, and for the first time, the clover felt less like a relic and more like a beginning. <words>345</words>
