<story>  
The mad botanist adjusted his goggles, their lenses smeared with pollen, and surveyed the high-altitude tea house with comically serious intensity, his carnivorous plants rustling in burlap sacks strapped to his back. <words>22</words>  
A worn-out leather belt, salvaged from his late mentor’s expedition journal, dug into his waist—a relic he believed would guide him to ancient pathways hidden beyond the veil of ordinary maps. <words>45</words>  
The tea house hummed with the static of a black-and-white film reel flickering in the adjacent room, its grainy images masking secrets only he could decipher during intermission’s fragile silence. <words>68</words>  
He’d spent years ionizing plant cells to perceive spectral anomalies, a madness born from a single truth: the reel’s hidden sections, visible only to his altered vision, charted routes through mountains that defied physics. <words>93</words>  
A flicker in the film—a shadowed doorway superimposed over a tea ceremony—made him grin. <words>103</words>  
He fed a fly to his favorite Venus flytrap, a sentient thing named Clive, and muttered, “We’re close,” as if the plant’s loyalty weren’t as fickle as the wind tearing at the tea house’s paper walls. <words>129</words>  
The keeper of the tea house, a woman with eyes like cracked amber, slid a porcelain cup toward him. <words>143</words>  
“You seek the Belt’s path,” she said, nodding at the leather strap. <words>153</words>  
He stiffened. <words>158</words>  
“Your predecessor left that belt. He ionized the reel, too. But the plants ate him.” <words>175</words>  
The botanist laughed—a honking, deranged sound—and patted Clive’s serrated jaws. <words>190</words>  
“Predecessors lack vision,” he declared, though his hands trembled. <words>203</words>  
The film crackled. <words>210</words>  
A hidden doorway pulsed crimson, its coordinates syncing with the belt’s weathered notches. <words>224</words>  
Clive hissed, vines snaking toward the screen, and the botanist snatched the belt, its leather humming with residual energy. <words>240</words>  
The keeper’s smile thinned. <words>249</words>  
“You’ll need more than plants,” she warned, sliding open a drawer to reveal a rusted key. <words>265</words>  
He eyed it, then her. <words>274</words>  
“Loyalty’s a currency,” she said. <words>284</words>  
He tossed her a vial of ionized nectar—the keeper’s earlier bribe to betray him—and snatched the key. <words>300</words>  
The film’s intermission bell clanged. <words>310</words>  
He lunged, projecting Clive’s pollen onto the reel. <words>321</words>  
The spores ionized the air, revealing a stairwell behind the screen, its steps spiraling into mist. <words>339</words>  
The keeper laughed bitterly, hurling a teapot at his head. <words>353</words>  
He ducked, the belt blazing like a compass needle toward the stairwell—and the ancient pathways beyond. <words>371</words>  
Clive devoured the broken teapot, chittering. <words>383</words>  
The botanist hesitated, glancing back. <words>394</words>  
“Fickle, isn’t it?” he called to the keeper, who now cradled a shard of glass, bleeding. <words>409</words>  
She spat a curse, but he was already ascending, the belt’s whispers harmonizing with Clive’s hum. <words>425</words>  
Above, the mountain sighed, its hidden veins opening to the mad, the loyal, and the half-remembered. <words>440</words>
