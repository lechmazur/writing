<story>  
The stubborn monk clutched the creased shipping label, its faded ink the only clue to the antique flute’s origin, as the aerial gondola swayed above the jagged peaks. <words>19</words>  
He had stolen the label from the abbot’s locked archive after a dream—sharp and recurrent—showed him the flute’s tooth-marked mouthpiece, a grotesque pattern no mortal could replicate. <words>40</words>  
Harvesting the past was heresy, yet the monastery’s silence on his brother’s death demanded vengeance; the flute, he believed, held the teeth of the dark reflection that had haunted their order for centuries. <words>65</words>  
The gondola groaned as it neared the summit, where the air thinned and the label’s cryptic coordinates aligned with the dream’s final image: a skeletal tree clawing at the sky. <words>91</words>  
Visually unappealing yet humming with malice, the flute had been buried with a warlord whose chronicles spoke of a “twin born from shadow,” a being that fed on regret and mimicked its prey’s soul. <words>118</words>  
The monk’s hands trembled, not from fear but focus, as he compared the tooth marks to the impressions left on his brother’s prayer beads—identical, deliberate, a signature. <words>144</words>  
To outsmart his own dark reflection, he had to become what it despised: adaptable, cunning, willing to dissect the past’s rot rather than worship its decay. <words>170</words>  
At the summit, the skeletal tree split open, revealing the flute’s twin—a hollow, blackened thing that shrieked as the monk pressed the creased label into its fissured mouth. <words>197</words>  
The reflection emerged, his face a warped mirror, and laughed at the monk’s resolve, unaware the dream had taught its dreamer to weaponize guilt, not evade it. <words>223</words>  
Analyzing the tooth marks had revealed a flaw: the reflection’s power waned where the flute’s melody faltered, a discordant note the monk now carved into a mountain pine. <words>250</words>  
As the gondola cable snapped, he played the flute, its fractured harmony unraveling the shadow’s form, which dissolved into the heartbeat of the dream that had first warned him. <words>277</words>  
The creased label, now scorched and fluttering into the abyss, had always been a map to this truth: harvesting the past required burning what you loved to starve what you feared. <words>305</words>  
The monk descended the mountain on foot, the flute shattered, his brother avenged, the reflection’s whisper fading like a lie the wind refused to carry. <words>330</words>  
He did not look back, for cautious enchantment demanded neither triumph nor regret—only the next crease in time the dream would carve into his palm. <words>356</words>  
The mountains hummed, dissonant and ancient, as the heartbeat of the world pulsed on, indifferent to the stories clinging to its slopes. <words>381</words>  
The monk walked, his shadow finally his own. <words>393</words>
