The poison taster knelt beside the subterranean waterfall, the bookmark’s frayed threads trembling in his calloused grip. <words>17</words>  
Its crimson dye, faded to the hue of dried blood, matched the color of the liquid he’d just sampled from the silver chalice—nonlethal, but bitter, like the lies whispered by the hidden society he served. <words>42</words>  
He craved death, yet bound himself to this ritual, each sip a penance for the massacre he’d survived years ago, his body now a map of scars and unspoken debts. <words>65</words>  
Above, the ice sculpture groaned, its melting drips harmonizing with the waterfall’s roar, a countdown to collapse—the society’s final test, or their execution. <words>89</words>  
He’d spent nights deciphering the bookmark’s cryptic symbols, cross-referencing them with frantic calls to talk-radio psychics whose voices crackled through his receiver like spirits. <words>114</words>  
“Energy flows like veins beneath the earth,” one psychic had hissed, her tone strangely compelling, guiding him here, where the waterfall’s mist refracted light into spectral arcs. <words>141</words>  
The society demanded obedience, but he sought absolution, his death wish a blade turned inward, sharper than any they’d offered. <words>163</words>  
Now, in the final second before the ice shattered, he pressed the bookmark to the rock, its threads aligning with glowing fissures below—a hidden map, alive and pulsing. <words>191</words>  
The waterfall stilled. The world held its breath. <words>202</words>  
He understood, then: the bookmark was never a clue, but a key, its fabric binding the energy flows the society had tried to weaponize. <words>227</words>  
His body convulsed; the poison in the chalice had been a catalyst, his veins now conduits for the force he’d unleashed. <words>249</words>  
Light erupted beneath the waterfall, carving luminous rivers through the cavern, dissolving the ice into a thunderous flood. <words>271</words>  
The society’s leaders would drown in their own ambition, their secrets buried under tons of cascading water and stone. <words>294</words>  
He smiled, the serene upheaval around him mirroring the peace he’d denied himself for years. <words>313</words>  
The psychic’s voice echoed in his mind: *“You’ll know when to let go.”* <words>329</words>  
As the ceiling caved, he released the bookmark, watching it spiral into the light—a requiem for the lost, a compass for those who’d come next. <words>355</words>  
The ice collapsed. <words>363</words>  
Water swallowed him, and the society’s lies with it, the currents carrying him toward a dawn he’d never see but had, at last, earned. <words>388</words>  
His death was not a surrender, but a final act of cartography, charting a world where energy and truth flowed unbound. <words>411</words>  
The psychic’s broadcast faded, static reclaiming the airwaves, while the cavern became legend, its secrets safe until the bookmark’s threads were found again. <words>440</words>
