The joyless performer knelt beside the prismatic lake, her calloused fingers tracing the simple drawer knob she’d pried from the floorboards of her childhood home, now reduced to splinters amid the construction cranes looming like skeletal sentinels. <words>27</words>  
The lake’s surface fractured the gray dawn into shards of violet and gold, mirroring the modestly extravagant beauty she’d once embodied on stage, before the weight of unspoken truths had curdled her art into ash. <words>54</words>  
She’d returned to organize the debris of her past, guided not by memory but by the echo of a squeaking seesaw from the empty playground beyond the fence—a sound that had haunted her since the accident, when her younger brother had fallen, his laughter still ringing as his bones snapped. <words>87</words>  
The drawer knob, plain and brass, had been her only solace then, clutched in her fist as she whispered apologies to the dark; now, it anchored her as she sifted through rubble, each shattered brick a metaphor for the dual truths she’d buried: her guilt and her relief that the blame had fallen on him, not her. <words>124</words>  
The construction crews shouted overhead, their hammers syncing with the arrhythmic squeak of the seesaw, a dissonance that throbbed in her skull until she unearthed the box—waterlogged, rusted, its hinges screaming like the ghost of her brother’s voice. <words>156</words>  
Inside lay his ticket stubs from the circus they’d sneaked into the summer before his death, her name scribbled over his in the margins, a child’s attempt to share a secret he’d taken to the grave. <words>183</words>  
She pressed the drawer knob to her forehead, the metal cold as the lake’s mist, and let the memories flood in: his grin, the sway of the seesaw, the way he’d begged her to push harder, higher, until the chains groaned—a game she’d won by leaping free, leaving him to crash alone. <words>216</words>  
The prismatic water rippled, reflecting not her face but his, the guilt a living thing now, writhing as she finally spoke his name, the word cracking the stillness like a stone through glass. <words>242</words>  
The seesaw’s echo softened, its rhythm steadying into a pulse she could breathe with, and she dropped the drawer knob into the lake, watching it sink beside his forgotten tokens, the act a fragile truce between the child she’d been and the woman grasping for absolution. <words>275</words>  
Cranes beeped in the distance, concrete pouring into fresh molds, and she walked away, the dissonance not gone but quieted, her cautious abandon a tightrope between the truths she could no longer outrun and the ones she’d finally dared to face. <words>307</words>
