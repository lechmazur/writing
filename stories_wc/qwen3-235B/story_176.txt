<story>  
The apathetic jester slouched against a bioluminescent mushroom stalk, its cap casting a sickly violet glow over the crumpled map in his calloused hands. <words>17</words>  
He’d found it tucked into his father’s moth-eaten motley, a relic from the family tradition of learning a new skill together each year—lockpicking, star navigation, now this: cartography of forgotten wars. <words>43</words>  
The garden around him pulsed with the hum of insight, a low-frequency thrumming that made his teeth ache, as if the mushrooms themselves were whispering secrets he’d stopped caring to hear. <words>72</words>  
His family had always been academically playful, treating trauma like a riddle to be solved with puns and acrobatics, but the map’s inked scars of lost battles felt heavier than jokes. <words>100</words>  
He lit a match to illuminate its faded script, flame trembling in his barbed-wire-gloved hand, and wondered if compassion could survive in such a clenched fist. <words>128</words>  
The jester’s mother had cradled him once, her arms as sharp with thorns as his own now were, singing lullabies about siege engines until he’d memorized every splinter of their rhythm. <words>157</words>  
Now, the garden’s spores drifted like static, clinging to his jingling bells as he stood, the map’s coordinates aligning with the skeletal remains of a clocktower half-swallowed by mycelium. <words>186</words>  
He moved with intense nonchalance, a practiced saunter that masked the fact that every step toward the tower was a step away from the family’s final lesson: that survival required letting go. <words>215</words>  
The hum sharpened as he neared the tower, resolving into a single phrase—*“Cradle the root, not the blade”*—and he laughed bitterly, the sound echoing off the mushrooms’ waxy undersides. <words>244</words>  
His father’s last skill had been taxidermy, preserving the family’s grief in glass-eyed stillness; the jester had learned to stitch wounds instead, though he’d never admit it was an act of hope. <words>273</words>  
The map’s ink bled into new shapes under the match’s light, revealing a chamber beneath the tower where the garden’s spores converged into a luminous core, a heart beating in time with the hum. <words>304</words>  
He hesitated, gloved fingers brushing the barbed wire coiled around his forearm—his mother’s parting gift, a reminder that tenderness was a weapon best wielded cautiously. <words>332</words>  
But the jester’s academic playfulness resurfaced, a childhood game of decoding celestial patterns resurfacing, and he calculated the chamber’s collapse would take precisely 3.7 seconds if he triggered the right root. <words>361</words>  
He illuminated the chamber with a flick of phosphorus powder, the glow revealing a thousand spore-saplings curled like fists, and understood: the garden thrived on what it devoured. <words>390</words>  
Including him. Including the family’s tradition of hollowing pain into lessons, leaving him adept at everything except feeling. <words>407</words>  
With intense nonchalance, he knelt, unwound the barbed wire from his arm, and cradled the saplings’ thorns in his palms, their sting a language his blood remembered. <words>435</words>  
The hum of insight became a roar, and the jester, for once, did not flinch. <words>449</words>
