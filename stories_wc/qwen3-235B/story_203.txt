The exorcist trembled as they arranged the final gear in the toy soldier’s chest, its tiny hands frozen mid-clench, the orbital debris outside their porthole glinting like shattered vows. <words>22</words>  
They hated this—the hush before the ritual, the way silence coiled around them like a noose—but the child’s mother had begged, and the inheritance of lies their family carried made refusal impossible. <words>45</words>  
A pressed wildflower, violet and brittle, slipped from their journal as they moved; it had belonged to their father, who’d lied about his sins, his exorcisms, his cowardice. <words>69</words>  
The possessed toy whirred to life, its gears grinding a dirge, and the exorcist’s throat tightened—their stage fright always began here, in the hollow between breath and duty. <words>93</words>  
But tonight, they’d sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” as their father never could, as his pressed flowers never dared. <words>113</words>  
The key turned in the lock of the station’s abandoned core, a sound like a throat clearing in the dark, and the exorcist’s pulse spiked—the method was never usual here, where orbital ice and ghost-wires fused. <words>140</words>  
They submerged the toy in liquid nitrogen, its scream fractalizing into the void’s static, while the key’s echo guided spectral hands to claw at their ankles. <words>164</words>  
The inheritance of lies demanded a toll: their father’s ghost, bloated on secrets, surfaced in the frost-cloud, demanding absolution. <words>186</words>  
But the exorcist pressed the wildflower to the toy’s heart, its fractured petals glowing amber—the lie was the ritual; the truth was the trembling. <words>210</words>  
The lock turned again, and the station shuddered, debris spiraling into a path—their defiance carved a road where none had existed. <words>232</words>  
They whispered the name their father had buried, and the ghost dissolved into the wildflower’s dust, its weight lifting from their ribs. <words>255</words>  
The toy soldier stood, no longer possessed but newly born, its metal feet clicking against the floor as it saluted, a requiem for the never-usual. <words>280</words>  
In the defiant hush, the exorcist pocketed the flower, its stem a compass needle pointing toward a future unchoked by ashes. <words>301</words>  
Orbital debris rained harmlessly past, now just relics of orbits corrected, while the key’s final turn sealed the core’s mouth forever. <words>325</words>  
They would tell the child the toy was healed, omitting the part where they’d drowned a ghost in cold fire, where they’d finally breathed without a script. <words>350</words>  
The inheritance of lies ended here, in the submersion of old fears, in the sound of a key that unlocked not a door but a horizon. <words>376</words>  
The exorcist hummed, assembling a second toy—a girl this time—its plastic hands ready to grip whatever world awaited. <words>398</words>  
When the next scream echoed through the debris, they rose, steady-voiced and unafraid, the wildflower’s pulse a metronome against their chest. <words>422</words>  
The ritual was never usual; neither were they. <words>433</words>
