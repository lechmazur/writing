The blank-faced performer sat on a moss-covered stool in the orchard of giant ferns, their fingers striking keys of a rain-warped piano as waterfalls thundered overhead, shredding the air into mist that glimmered like shattered glass. <words>22</words>  
Each note they played seemed to hum in sympathy with the ferns’ rustling fronds, their expressionless face reflecting the pale moonlight that seeped through the cascading water, a silent conductor orchestrating the chaos. <words>43</words>  
On their right hand glinted a plain plastic ring, its surface etched with symbols too faint to decipher, a token from a forgotten patron or perhaps a key to something far less tangible. <words>66</words>  
They were the guardian of rumors, a title earned not by choice but by birth, tasked with approving which whispers of the orchard’s secrets might survive and which would dissolve into the damp earth. <words>91</words>  
Their method was precise madness: tracking moon paths as they arced over the falls, correlating lunar phases with the piano’s dissonant melodies to sieve truth from delusion. <words>115</words>  
The ring, uniquely typical among the orchard’s detritus, hummed faintly when rumors neared, its plastic growing warm as if feverish, guiding their decisions with a logic only they understood. <words>141</words>  
During each practice, they sought the language of dreams—a dialect spoken in half-heard refrains and shadow-play—to decode the orchard’s murmurs, its ferns heavy with stories too old to name. <words>168</words>  
The waterfalls’ roar was not random but a chorus of voices, and the performer’s blank face masked the strain of parsing its endless tide, their eyes flickering with calculations no mortal mind should hold. <words>196</words>  
One night, a rumor slithered in, sharp and silver: *The moon will fracture tonight, and the orchard will remember its true name.* The ring burned, its symbols flaring crimson. <words>223</words>  
They played faster, keys groaning under their touch, moon paths converging in a spiral that blurred the falls into liquid mirrors reflecting not their face but a thousand others—watching, waiting. <words>249</words>  
The rumor’s approval hinged on a single note, a frequency that would align the ferns’ shadows into a bridge or a blade; their fingers trembled, the plastic ring cracking at the seam. <words>276</words>  
When the final chord rang out, the orchard shuddered, ferns bowing low as the waterfalls froze mid-cascade, their suspended droplets resolving into words: *Approved. Translate us.* <words>302</words>  
The performer’s mouth curled, just slightly—a flicker of satisfaction in their precise, maddened duty—as the dream-language flooded their mind, a torrent of names and endings and beginnings. <words>329</words>  
They whispered back, voice harmonizing with the newly thawed falls, and the orchard exhaled, its rumors now woven into tomorrow’s lullabies, safe for another cycle of moonlight and madness. <words>356</words>  
The ring, now split and lifeless, fell to the moss, its purpose spent until the next rumor demanded a judge—a blank face, a trembling chord, a bridge between the known and the devouring dark. <words>384</words>  
And the piano played on, its notes mapping the boundary where sanity frayed into the fertile, fevered soil of the orchard’s ever-hungry dreams. <words>409</words>
