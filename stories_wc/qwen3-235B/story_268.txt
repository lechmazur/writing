<story>  
The subdued vigilante crouched in the abandoned waiting area, their artfully clumsy fingers brushing dust off an antique funhouse mirror propped against a cracked wall. <words>17</words>  
Sunlight slanted through shattered windows, illuminating the plain wooden bead dangling from a frayed wire around their neck—a relic from a war they’d fled, a war that had priced their soul in ash and silence. <words>34</words>  
They’d mastered the ancient art of tracking distortions in the mirror, a skill once used by seers to unveil lies, now repurposed to hunt those who’d profited from the conflict that scarred them. <words>52</words>  
During virtual calls with their remaining allies, they’d flatter informants with half-truths about redemption, their voice a monotone hum that masked the scream lodged in their throat since the bombings began. <words>70</words>  
The mirror shuddered, its warped surface rippling as a shadow materialized—a warlord’s henchman, his face stretched into a grotesque grin, hiding in the reflection of a vending machine. <words>88</words>  
The vigilante lunged, their movements awkward yet precise, a dance honed through years of surviving both bullets and guilt, and slammed the mirror sideways, fracturing the distortion. <words>106</words>  
The henchman yelped, materializing fully as the bead at the vigilante’s chest pulsed, absorbing the man’s scream—a sound the world had muted to preserve its fragile peace. <words>123</words>  
They’d learned the price of war wasn’t in the dying, but in the living: the hollowed-out hospitals, the silence where children once laughed, the way their own hands shook when they paused. <words>141</words>  
Another virtual call flickered on their cracked tablet; a contact’s pixelated face urged caution, but the vigilante dismissed it, their flattery now a reflex—“You’re a patriot,” they murmured to the henchman, prying intel from his lips. <words>161</words>  
The mirror’s distortions mapped a route to the warlord’s hideout, its fractured glass revealing paths only the artfully clumsy could navigate, their stumbles masking deliberate steps toward vengeance. <words>179</words>  
In the screaming silence, the bead grew heavier, each absorbed scream etching memories into their bones: a child’s laugh, a bomb’s whine, a mother’s plea—all casualties of the war they’d sworn to dismantle. <words>198</words>  
They moved, a shadow among ruins, the mirror clutched like a shield, knowing mastery of the ancient art demanded more than skill; it required becoming a vessel for the voiceless, a conduit for the war’s unpaid debts. <words>218</words>  
When the warlord’s blade met their ribs, they smiled, their final flatter a whisper—“You’ll never see me coming”—as the bead snapped, releasing a scream that shattered the mirror, the silence, and the warlord’s skull. <words>238</words>  
The waiting area collapsed in echoes, the vigilante’s body cradled by rubble, their last breath merging with the screams of a hundred wars, unpaid and eternal. <words>254</words>
