The sun hung low over the rust-choked fields of the dystopian farm, casting long shadows that seemed to claw at the earth. <words>17</words>  
Jeb, a small-time con artist with an unusually normal face that made him easy to trust, knelt beside a skeletal crop row, clutching an empty tape dispenser like a rosary. <words>35</words>  
He’d stolen it from a dead office worker’s pocket two weeks prior, a meaningless trinket that now symbolized every hollow scam he’d ever run. <words>52</words>  
The farm’s overseers had no idea he’d infiltrated their labor force to siphon rations for the starving town beyond the electrified fences. <words>69</words>  
But guilt, thick and cloying, had begun to seep into his bones—a lull of remorse that made his hands shake as he harvested wilted soy stalks. <words>86</words>  
At night, he’d retreat to the barn, where ghostly apparitions flickered among the hay bales, their translucent faces mirrors of the hungry children he’d lied to for scraps. <words>104</words>  
“Why’d you let me do it?” he’d snarl, jabbing the dispenser at the specters, its barren spindle glinting like a taunt. <words>118</words>  
The ghosts never answered, only sighed, their breath smelling of rain and rot, a comfort Jeb both craved and despised. <words>133</words>  
He’d started interrogating them after discovering the dispenser could make them flinch—a makeshift weapon against the truth he couldn’t outrun. <words>150</words>  
One specter, a girl with a missing hand, finally spoke: “You wanted us to need you. Now you’re the one grasping.” <words>166</words>  
Her words coiled around his throat, but he grinned anyway, taunting the jaws of defeat that had always waited patiently for men like him. <words>184</words>  
The farm’s overseers grew suspicious when rations vanished faster than the rats could steal; Jeb’s time was running thinner than the soil. <words>200</words>  
On his final evening, he stood atop the silo, dispenser clutched to his chest, the ghosts crowding close enough to chill his marrow. <words>217</words>  
“Tell me I’m more than this,” he whispered, but the girl’s hollow eyes only deepened his ache. <words>231</words>  
He jumped, wind roaring as the ghosts dissolved like smoke, and landed hard in a truck bed loaded with stolen grain bound for the town. <words>249</words>  
The overseers’ bullets missed, grazing his ear as he vanished into the dust-choked horizon, the empty dispenser slipping from his pocket into the dirt. <words>267</words>  
Jeb didn’t look back, but the ghosts never left him—not truly. <words>278</words>  
Their whispers followed, a mild fervor in his ears, as he delivered the grain to waiting hands, their faces lit with desperate hope. <words>295</words>  
He’d never be clean, but he’d learned to wield his remorse like a blade, cutting deals with the devil he knew until the next harvest rose. <words>313</words>  
The farm’s dystopian grind faded behind him, yet the girl’s voice lingered, a hymn of accountability he’d carry into every new con. <words>331</words>  
Jeb’s grin, wide and fractured, became legend—a man who’d stared into the void and bartered for seconds, one empty reel at a time. <words>349</words>  
The tape dispenser, now buried beneath a soy stalk that dared to green, hummed with the quiet thrill of a story unfinished. <words>366</words>
