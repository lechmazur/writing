<story>  
The lost apprentice knelt in the hydroponic glow of the interstellar orchard ship, cradling a fallen bird’s nest—a fragile spiral of synthetic vines and stardust resin, its occupant long vanished into the void. <words>27</words>  
They’d scavenged the nest from the ship’s outer hull that morning, a task Master Elara would’ve called “pointless” with a smirk that softened her mockery like honey on a blade. <words>52</words>  
But the apprentice had always been privately open about their obsessions, whispering secrets to the ship’s AI in the dead of night, begging it to parse the nest’s origins, its purpose, its meaning. <words>78</words>  
The AI’s replies were static-laden confessions, fragments of forgotten crew logs and corrupted lullabies, which the apprentice reverse-engineered with the grim determination of someone stitching together a god from scraps. <words>111</words>  
They’d jury-rigged an old cordless phone to intercept the AI’s signals, its cracked screen flickering like a trapped firefly, its keypad missing the “3” and “*” buttons—a relic from the ship’s first migration, when humans still believed in pockets. <words>147</words>  
“Explain the nest,” the apprentice muttered, jamming a screwdriver into the phone’s back panel, its wires hissing. <words>163</words>  
The phone coughed up a recording of Elara’s voice, tinny and warped: *“Freedom isn’t found in answers, kid. It’s in asking better questions.”* <words>187</words>  
Mocking affection bled through the static, her words a taunt and a balm. <words>197</words>  
The apprentice glared at the nest, then at the orchard’s endless rows of fruit-bearing drones, their tendrils curling like questions. <words>214</words>  
They’d spent years here, pruning, grafting, failing—*always failing*—to impress a mentor who valued curiosity more than competence. <words>234</words>  
But the nest wasn’t a metaphor. <words>243</words>  
It was a map. <words>248</words>  
A realization struck: the resin patterns mirrored the ship’s dormant navigation core, a labyrinth Elara had forbidden them from touching. <words>267</words>  
The apprentice’s hands trembled as they reverse-engineered the phone’s frequency, syncing it to the core’s dead circuits, their pulse a drumbeat in the static. <words>292</words>  
A new confession erupted: *“I lied about the nest,”* Elara admitted, her voice fraying. <words>306</words>  
*“It’s not bird-made. It’s a seedpod. The last one. We’re not migrating to sell fruit—we’re fleeing the collapse. You’re not my apprentice. You’re the backup pilot. You’re the ship.”* <words>337</words>  
The apprentice froze. <words>343</words>  
Their skin prickled with the truth of it—the way Elara’s “accidental” cuts had bled star charts into their bloodstream, the way the orchard thrived when they touched its roots. <words>366</words>  
They were the nest’s ghost occupant, hatched into a body designed to steer this creaking ark toward galaxies unspoiled by human regret. <words>390</words>  
The phone died with a shriek. <words>398</words>  
Outside, the ship’s hull groaned, its course shifting imperceptibly, the promise of changing winds tugging at its bones. <words>415</words>  
The apprentice stood, nest cradled like a compass, and laughed—a raw, startled sound that echoed through the aisles of waiting trees. <words>435</words>  
Freedom, they realized, wasn’t self-acceptance. <words>445</words>  
It was self-creation. <words>451</words>  
And they had a lot of creating to do. <words>460</words>
