In the husk of the abandoned space station’s medical bay, where dust swirled like ghostly patients, the peddler knelt, their dried flower bouquet clutched meekly but assertively—a talisman against the void. <words>30</words>  
The universe hummed its secret song beyond the cracked viewport, a low vibrational hymn that seemed to mock the silence of the derelict station, its once-sterile walls now veined with rust and neglect. <words>59</words>  
They had sifted through rumor-laden gossip columns for weeks—fragments of corrupted data-pads and whispered transmissions—to find this place, where a blood-oath’s curse might be divided into its base elements: regret, rage, and the faintest glimmer of redemption. <words>99</words>  
The peddler’s gloved hands trembled, not from fear but the weight of the oath itself, sealed decades ago when they’d traded a friend’s location to slavers to save their own skin, a sin that clung like the stench of antiseptic in the bay’s stagnant air. <words>140</words>  
They spread the gossip columns—a mosaic of lies and half-truths—across a dented diagnostic table, their meekly assertive voice murmuring as they cross-referenced a smuggler’s code hidden in a poet’s elegy for a dead moon. <words>177</words>  
Redemption’s path, they’d learned, was not a straight line but a spiral, drawing them back to the scene of their crime, the station where the friend had last drawn breath, now a tomb humming with the universe’s indifferent aria. <words>214</words>  
A flicker in the data—a name, *Elias*, buried in a column about a botched arms deal—made the peddler’s chest ache; the bouquet’s brittle petals crumbled slightly, as if sharing their grief. <words>248</words>  
They had carried the flowers since Elias’s death, a meek assertion of memory in a galaxy that preferred to forget, their stems worn smooth by guilt’s relentless handling. <words>277</words>  
The gossip columns had led them here, to a locker containing a cryo-pod, its frost-rimmed glass revealing not a corpse but a figure suspended mid-breath—Elias, alive, their betrayal circumvented by a smuggler’s last-minute mercy. <words>315</words>  
The peddler’s hands moved assertively now, dividing the bouquet into two halves: one left in the dust as an offering, the other tucked into Elias’s frozen palm through a crack in the pod. <words>348</words>  
Breaking the oath required no grand ritual, only the quiet act of returning what was lost—truth sifted from rumor, life from death—and the universe’s song seemed to swell, a chord resolving into something like forgiveness. <words>387</words>  
As the pod hissed open, Elias’s eyes fluttering awake, the peddler stepped back, meek but unbroken, their redemption not in erasing the past but carrying its weight into the hum of an unwritten future. <words>424</words>  
The station groaned, its systems flickering to life around them, and the peddler smiled—a lonely, joyous crack in the void—as the universe sang on. <words>452</words>
