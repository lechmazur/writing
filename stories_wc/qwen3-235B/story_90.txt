The contrite swordsman, Sir Talric, adjusted his cracked monocle, its fractured lens warping the floating island spa into a kaleidoscope of lavender mist and suspiciously sentient ferns. <words>17</words>  
He had come to unmask the pretender to the Skythrone, whose clandestine tattoos—inked in celestial cipher—betrayed their mortal origins, but the spa’s hypnotically rigid receptionist, Madame Zinnia, insisted he “detoxify his aura” first. <words>43</words>  
“Yarn therapy,” she intoned, thrusting a skein of glowing thread into his hands, “is mandatory for all guests seeking inner truth… or political assassinations.” <words>57</words>  
Talric grumbled but climbed into the moss-woven hammock, where the yarn hummed and coiled around his wrists, tugging him toward a grotto labeled *“For Traitors and Tax Evaders Only.”* <words>74</words>  
There, he found the pretender—or rather, their mannequin. A figure sat unnaturally still, back straight as a siege tower, tattoos spiraling up their neck like ivy. <words>91</words>  
The cracked monocle clarified the ink: cryptic runes spelling *“I AM NOT ROYALTY”* in six languages. Talric snorted. “Subtle.” <words>103</words>  
The yarn in his hands twitched, yanking him forward to unravel the deception—literally. Thread latched onto the tattoos, pulling taut as Talric muttered a spell he’d once dueled a bard to forget. <words>123</words>  
With each loop of yarn, the pretender’s facade frayed: their jeweled crown melted into a chambermaid’s cap, their regal robes into a stained spa towel. <words>139</words>  
Madame Zinnia materialized, clapping. “Bravo! We’ve been trying to expose Jareth the footman for weeks! His aura was *terrible* for business.” <words>155</words>  
Talric glared. “This ‘footman’ nearly usurped the realm. Why didn’t you stop him?” <words>165</words>  
“Kindness first,” she chirped, tossing a vial of antidote ink. “Now, care for a mud wrap? It’s 80% humiliation, 20% enlightenment.” <words>181</words>  
As Talric dabbed the antidote onto Jareth’s weeping tattoos, the footman groaned awake, no longer hypnotically rigid but refreshingly remorseful. “I only wanted a better life!” he wailed. <words>200</words>  
“You’ve got one,” Talric said, sheathing his sword. “Apologize to the ferns. They’re witnesses.” <words>211</words>  
The swordsman lingered in the hush where hope takes root, watching Jareth knit a sweater of atonement with the spa’s enchanted yarn. <words>226</words>  
Later, floating in a cloud-bubble bath, Talric squinted through his cracked monocle at the real Skythrone heir—now exposed—scrubbing algae from the pool. <words>244</words>  
“Freed by kindness, huh?” Talric muttered, as the heir handed him a towel embroidered with the spa’s motto: *“We Unravel Better Together.”* <words>260</words>  
The monocle slipped, shattering further, and Talric laughed—a sound as rare as a truthful politician. The realm was saved. The ferns were appeased. <words>278</words>  
And somewhere, a footman-turned-royal-tailor knitted a crown of yarn, because even pretenders deserved a second stitch. <words>293</words>
