The calm doomsayer sat cross-legged on the splintered floor of the steampunk workshop’s barn loft, the first amber light of sunrise seeping through cracked glass panes as a distant train whistle trembled in the air like a ghost’s sigh. <words>28</words>  
His calloused fingers traced the chipped grip tape of a battered old skateboard, its deck scarred by decades of asphalt and rebellion, stickers clinging to it like faded memories: a defunct anarchist collective, a band swallowed by time, a child’s crayon-scrawled sunflower. <words>56</words>  
Faithfully odd, he had outlasted the world’s appetite for prophets, his warnings of entropy and ruin dismissed as the static of a misfiring mind—until the whistle’s mournful cry sliced through the hush, and he knew it was time to resume. <words>84</words>  
He slid the skateboard into the shafts of light, watching dust swirl around its wheels like tiny galaxies collapsing, remembering when he’d ridden it through streets now buried under concrete and regret, before the weight of foresight had ground his wheels to a halt. <words>115</words>  
Loss of innocence was a gear that never reversed; he’d seen it in the hollow eyes of children who’d traded dreams for survival, in the rusted skeletons of machines built to soar but grounded by greed. <words>142</words>  
Now, the gods of stagnation—plump and smug in their cathedral of complacency—would feel the scrape of his board’s trucks against the thresholds of their shrines, a screech of progress they could not silence. <words>170</words>  
He rose, joints creaking like iron hinges, and placed a boot on the board’s warped surface, the stickers peeling to reveal the raw wood beneath, a wound shaped like the boy he’d been: wide-eyed, unbroken, certain the future could be carved rather than inherited. <words>200</words>  
The whistle sounded again, closer, and he pushed off, the workshop’s gears groaning in sympathy as he carved a path through the detritus of failed inventions and half-forgotten blueprints, his placid ferocity humming in every revolution of the wheels. <words>229</words>  
He would not scream his truths anymore; he would etch them into the city’s bones with the scuff of rubber and the groan of metal, a pilgrimage of motion that no sermon could match. <words>255</words>  
The loft’s shadows stretched long behind him as he exited, the skateboard’s stickers flaring one last time in the light—sunflower, anarchy, ruin—a collage of what was lost and what would never be buried. <words>284</words>  
Stagnation’s gods would hear him coming, not in thunder, but in the relentless tick-tick-tick of a board racing downhill, a requiem composed in velocity, a door slammed not with fury, but with the quiet finality of a train departing a station it will never revisit. <words>317</words>  
He rode toward the horizon where the tracks vanished, the whistle’s echo his only hymn, the road ahead a blank slate waiting for the scars of wheels and the weight of a man who had never learned to stop. <words>345</words>
