The proud exorcist, Mara Vex, perched in her treehouse citadel—a spiraling amalgam of bamboo and magic nestled in the Amazon’s emerald canopy—glared at the spirit writhing in her net. Its shrieks harmonized with the cacophony of howler monkeys below, a symphony of chaos she usually relished. <words>47</words>  
“Cynicism’s wasted on the dead,” she quipped, yanking the net tighter as the specter dissolved into mist. Her boots, scuffed from decades of stomping out supernatural nuisances, tapped a restless rhythm against the floorboards. Pride was her armor; feistiness, her sword. <words>85</words>  
But tonight, the usual path had closed. The spirit hadn’t fled her sigils. It had laughed. <words>103</words>  
A note fluttered from the void where it vanished: *“The grimoire knows.”* Mara scoffed. Wizards were show-offs; their relics, trash. Yet curiosity gnawed—a hunger sharper than her disdain. <words>132</words>  
Beneath a floorboard, she unearthed the battered grimoire—a thing of peeling leather and spite. Its pages reeked of ozone and regret. “Youthify,” she read aloud, brow arched. “Cute.” The spell’s glyphs flared as time hiccupped, the clock skipping a beat. <words>171</words>  
Her bones liquefied. Skin prickled. When the light faded, her reflection in a dagger’s hilt showed a girl of sixteen—wild curls, freckles, a face she’d sworn never to wear again. “*Fantastic*,” she snarled, voice now a soprano weapon. Responsibility, once a mantle, now choked her. <words>213</words>  
The treehouse city stirred. Spirits, sensing her fragility, surged upward like smoke. Roots groaned; vines recoiled. Mara’s mentor, the looming shadow of Old Thorne, had warned her: *“Pride’s a lousy shield when you’re small enough to crush.”* <words>250</words>  
Feisty? Oh, she’d show them. She hurled the grimoire at a possessed kapok tree. The book erupted into a cacophony of frogs and Latin curses, buying her three seconds. She vaulted onto a swinging rope bridge, youth’s reckless agility saving her where experience had failed. <words>290</words>  
The spirits herded her toward the city’s heart—a glade where the tribe’s elders chanted, oblivious to the spectral swarm. Mara’s childhood home, now a museum of her failures. “Outshine them,” she muttered, not sure if she meant the shadows or Thorne’s ghost. <words>328</words>  
The grimoire pulsed. Pages flipped, revealing a binding ritual. *“Sacrifice what you cherish,”* it hissed. Mara glanced at her shrunken hands—*her pride*, the thing she’d traded for power years ago. Irony, bitter and sweet, curled her lips. <words>366</words>  
She chanted. The spirits lunged. The treehouse shuddered as her voice wove a net of light, not from pride, but from the raw, ragged truth of her fear. The grimoire devoured itself, sealing the breach. Silence fell. <words>402</words>  
Mara stood, unchanged—older, somehow, though time had skipped. The elders stared. “Don’t gawk,” she snapped, kicking a frog off her boot. “Get back to your fires or whatever.” But her voice wavered, endearingly, infuriatingly human. <words>437</words>  
That night, she pocketed the grimoire’s ashes. The weight of responsibility hadn’t lifted. But in the treehouse’s creaking bones, she felt it—smaller, sharable. A shadow, after all, needed light to exist. <words>470</words>
