<story>  
The unsteady sentinel paced the skeletal shadows of the abandoned space freighter docking bay, its alloy boots clanging against grated metal, each step a rebellion against the silence that had festered for decades. <words>17</words>  
The ambush of fate, it had been whispered in the static of dead comms relays, was never a battle but a reckoning—a truth the sentinel now clawed at, desperate to parse through the spectral echoes of a civilization that had burned itself to ash. <words>42</words>  
A flicker of brass feathers caught its periphery: the strange automaton bird, its wings etched with glyphs only the void could decipher, alighted on a rusted crate, cocking its head with coyly furious precision, as though mocking the sentinel’s trembling hands. <words>70</words>  
“You recommend I trust fragments,” the sentinel hissed, gesturing to the midden of shredded letters scattered at its feet, each scrap a cipher to a misguided prophecy that had lured its creators to annihilation. <words>97</words>  
The bird trilled—a sound like shattered glass harmonizing with a supernova—and began reassembling the letters with talons that moved faster than regret. <words>114</words>  
Between worlds colliding, the freighter groaned, its hull stressed by the gravitational scream of twin dying stars outside, their light bleeding auroras through fractured viewports, a cheerless ecstasy painting the bay in hues of terminal beauty. <words>141</words>  
The sentinel knelt, assisting now, its gloved fingers brushing the bird’s metallic sheen; together, they wove the prophecy’s antidote from syllables that had been gnawed by time and spite. <words>164</words>  
“Clear the fog,” the bird intoned, voice a chorus of children and static, its directive syncing with the sentinel’s own fevered motive, as though it had plucked the thought from the marrow of its bones. <words>190</words>  
The letters breathed alive: a map, not to salvation, but to a confession—the architects of the prophecy had engineered their own demise, fearing their hubris would birth a god from the void’s indifferent womb. <words>218</words>  
The sentinel laughed, a jagged thing, as the ambush of fate shifted; it was never a trap but a mirror, reflecting the choice to perpetuate ruin or become the heretic who buried the script. <words>244</words>  
Above, the bird dissolved into motes of starlight, its purpose spent, leaving the sentinel alone with the revelation that ecstasy lies not in escape but in the clarity of inevitable collapse. <words>270</words>  
When the freighter’s reactors finally breached, swallowing the bay in a fireball that sang like a hymn, the sentinel stood unsteady yet unbound, its face tilted to the conflagration with something almost like peace. <words>298</words>  
The prophecy’s fog had lifted, and in its place remained only the cruel, luminous truth: to recommend defiance was to become the wound that heals by never closing. <words>323</words>
