<story>  
The traveling salesman of oddities crouched in the silent abyss of a forgotten attic, his fingers tracing the cracks of a rustic water pitcher as if reading a map of vanished constellations. <words>44</words>  
Its clay, sun-starved and moss-speckled, hummed with the rationally whimsical aura of artifacts that refused to die quietly, and he’d stolen it from a monastery where monks quantified prayer in grains of sand. <words>87</words>  
He’d always mocked sincerity, yet here he was, pendulum-swinging a magnifying glass over the pitcher’s scars, timing each sway to the rhythm of a lullaby his mother once hummed—a method as precise as it was absurd. <words>130</words>  
The repairs demanded patience; the cracks were fissures in time, each gap a missing chapter of hands that had held this vessel before him, all of them now dust or myth. <words>172</words>  
He’d spent years collecting vanishing arts: a clockmaker’s final gear, a weaver’s last thread, a composer’s unheard note—and now this pitcher, which the monks claimed could hold the weight of every tear ever shed over lost things. <words>215</words>  
As he glued shards with sap from a tree extinct by dawn, he wondered if interconnectedness was just another trick of light, a lie sold by those afraid to admit the universe was a bag of loose buttons. <words>258</words>  
But the pendulum swung, and with each arc, the pitcher whispered—a merchant’s sigh in 14th-century Samarkand, the laughter of a girl who’d drawn water from a well now paved into a parking lot, the groan of a soldier who’d used it as a pillow before dying unnamed. <words>303</words>  
The salesman scoffed; ghosts were cheap theater, yet his hands trembled, matching the pendulum’s rhythm, as though his own pulse had been borrowed from something older and less rational than blood. <words>346</words>  
He quantified the cracks: seven major, thirty-two minor, a constellation of fractures that mirrored his own ribs, his own habit of collecting broken things to feel less alone. <words>387</words>  
When the final shard fused, the pitcher exhaled, and the attic filled with the smell of rain on dry earth—a soundless hymn to repair, to the art of lingering, to the joke that everything matters. <words>429</words>  
He laughed, bitterly bright, and poured himself a drink from the pitcher, its water tasting of salt and iron and the punchline of a universe that kept score but never balanced the books. <words>472</words>  
The salesman packed the pitcher gently, its weight now a riddle he’d carry: that to hold nothing is to hold everything, and that sincerity, even mocked, could carve a man hollow enough to bloom. <words>515</words>
