The docile bruiser, Thaddeus, moved through the greenhouse labyrinth with disturbingly calm precision, his massive hands brushing aside vines as if apologizing to the man-eating plants that lined the walls. <words>22</words>  
He’d spent weeks deciphering rumors of the conductor’s baton rumored to raise the dead, a relic supposedly hidden where the soil was “thick with forgotten songs.” <words>43</words>  
The map, pieced together from shredded scraps found under warped floorboards, had led him here, though half the symbols were in a language that even his linguist companion, Lila, couldn’t fully translate. <words>68</words>  
Lila, brash and sharp-tongued, had joined him not for treasure but to mold a myth from the mud of reality, insisting legends were “just lies everyone agrees to believe.” <words>93</words>  
Their dynamic was a tangle of contradictions: Thaddeus’s quiet tenderness disarmed her cynicism, while her relentless pragmatism cut through his indecision. <words>115</words>  
Amid the dissonant drum solos echoing from the greenhouse’s rusted ventilation shafts—a sound Thaddeus swore was mechanical, though Lila insisted was alive—they found the final clue etched into a stone pedestal. <words>143</words>  
The pedestal held the baton, its glass shaft humming faintly, surrounded by a semicircle of skeletal plants that seemed to lean toward it like an audience awaiting a symphony. <words>167</words>  
Lila’s hands trembled as she read the inscription aloud: “The dead rise not to walk, but to bloom.” <words>183</words>  
Thaddeus, recalling his grandmother’s tales of conductors who “orchestrated growth, not music,” gripped the baton and slashed it downward in a reflexive gesture. <words>207</words>  
The ground shuddered. Roots erupted, weaving into a towering humanoid shape—a guardian, not a resurrection. <words>223</words>  
The twist gutted their assumptions: the baton didn’t summon the dead; it commanded life, bending flora into forms only myth could name. <words>244</words>  
Lila laughed bitterly, her voice swallowed by another drum solo. “A myth built on a misunderstanding. How poetic.” <words>263</words>  
But Thaddeus knelt, pressing his palm to the soil. The plants here weren’t man-eaters; they were protectors, cultivated by a long-vanished civilization that had conducted ecosystems like symphonies. <words>289</words>  
He stood, placing the baton back on the pedestal. “Some myths,” he said softly, “should stay buried.” <words>306</words>  
Lila glared, then nodded, tearing the map into confetti. The drumming faded as they left, the labyrinth’s paths shifting behind them, sealing the secret. <words>329</words>  
Years later, travelers would speak of a gentle giant who wandered the ruins, whispering to vines, and a woman who wrote ballads about a baton that raised neither corpses nor kings, but a world that hummed with wild, unspoken language. <words>357</words>  
The myth, they agreed, was better than the truth. <words>367</words>
