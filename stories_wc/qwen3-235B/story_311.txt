The lunar greenhouse shimmered under the pale Earthlight, its glass dome perched on the crater’s edge like a fragile promise of life. <words>17</words>  
Elias, the tense bodyguard, paced the perimeter, his gloved hand hovering near the holster at his hip, though the only threat here was the silence. <words>34</words>  
He’d been assigned to guard the Minister’s daughter during her park visits—serene walks among hydroponic vines—but today, the girl lingered too long near a rusted storage locker. <words>53</words>  
Curious, Elias followed, finding a faded photograph wedged beneath a cracked panel: a woman with the Minister’s eyes, smiling beside a stranger in a rebel’s armband. <words>72</words>  
The image ignited something serendipitously stubborn in him—a refusal to let the past stay buried, a need to ratify truths the Ministry had erased. <words>90</words>  
Over weeks, he collected fragments of overheard stories: a botanist humming a forbidden anthem, a technician recalling a sibling “disappeared” for dissent, the girl herself whispering, “She wasn’t just his prisoner.” <words>117</words>  
Each fragment wove into the photograph’s silent narrative, a rebellion germinating in the shadows of the greenhouse’s tranquility. <words>131</words>  
Elias’s palms itched with the memory of his own father’s execution, the Ministry’s lie—that it was a mining accident—crumbling like dried soil. <words>149</words>  
The Minister’s daughter pressed a data chip into his hand: coordinates to a lunar resistance outpost, her voice steady. <words>164</words>  
“They’ll help you break free,” she said, and Elias realized she’d been studying him as closely as he’d studied the greenhouse’s secrets. <words>183</words>  
He hesitated, the weight of duty clashing with the raw, unnameable hope the photograph had stirred—a timely rebirth he’d never dared imagine. <words>202</words>  
At dawn, when the Minister arrived to inspect the greenhouse, Elias stood aside, letting the girl stride forward, her voice ringing clear. <words>218</words>  
“We ratify our own future,” she declared, and Elias felt the words lodge in his chest, fiercer than any order he’d ever followed. <words>236</words>  
The Minister lunged, but the botanist and technician emerged from the vines, their hands no longer trembling, their stories now a chorus. <words>254</words>  
Elias’s anger, long simmering beneath his rigid posture, uncurled like a fist unclenching—not violent, but deliberate—as he turned his back on the man who’d controlled him for a decade. <words>281</words>  
Outside, the lunar plains glowed, the resistance outpost a faint beacon. <words>293</words>  
He carried the photograph with him, its edges frayed but the faces still vivid, a testament to what could grow even in barren ground. <words>310</words>  
The greenhouse faded behind him, its serenity now a memory tainted by the truth he’d ratified with fragments and fury. <words>327</words>  
When the outpost’s doors hissed open, Elias didn’t look back. <words>338</words>  
He was no longer a bodyguard, but a man sowing his own rebirth, one stubborn step at a time. <words>353</words>  
The photograph rested against his heart, its story now his own: a beginning, not an ending. <words>367</words>
