<story>  
The old-fashioned mage, Elias Thorn, wandered the arctic research greenhouse in a threadbare velvet robe, his brass astrolabe clutched like a relic. <words>17</words>  
He had come to claim the uncharted frontier whispered about in grimoires—the coffin fragment of Pharaoh Neferkhare, buried in permafrost and rumored to unlock the riddle of eternal transit. <words>34</words>  
The greenhouse, a glass cathedral amid ice, hummed with engineered mosses and bioluminescent ferns, their glow refracting in frost-rimmed mirrors that lined the walls. <words>51</words>  
Elias’s method was purposefully aimless: he let the mirrors guide him, their ephemeral reflections pulling him toward glimpses of a shadowed chamber, a sarcophagus lid etched with glyphs only he could read. <words>69</words>  
Each encounter with the mirrors left him trembling; they showed not his face, but a child’s playground beyond the greenhouse, where laughter echoed during “playground time,” a scheduled anomaly the researchers ignored. <words>87</words>  
The riddle unfolded in fragments: a hieroglyph for “gate” flickered over a mirror beside a tank of dormant seeds, then a reflection of Elias as a younger man, weeping at a cradle. <words>104</words>  
He cuddled a vial of the greenhouse’s hybrid pollen, its golden haze swirling like memories, and understood—the coffin fragment required sacrifice, not force, to breach the frontier. <words>121</words>  
The sanctified dread crept in as the mirrors aligned: Neferkhare’s glyph glowed crimson in a pane overlooking the playground, where children’s laughter now sounded like wails. <words>138</words>  
Elias shattered the mirror, clutching a jagged shard to his chest; the greenhouse trembled, and the coffin fragment materialized at the room’s heart, its wood blackened and humming. <words>155</words>  
The frontier was not land but time—the playground’s joy was a loop of a century-old blizzard, children frozen mid-scream, their souls bound to guard the pharaoh’s secret. <words>173</words>  
To claim the frontier, Elias would replace them with his own memory: the daughter he’d lost, her face now emerging in the shard’s silver surface, her voice a plea. <words>190</words>  
He pressed the shard to the coffin fragment, and the greenhouse dissolved into a desert of stars, the riddle’s final word—“mercy”—carved into his ribs. <words>207</words>  
The mirrors fell silent, their duty done. Elias stood in the cold, clutching nothing, the frontier his at last, though the stars screamed in his mage’s blood. <words>224</words>  
He had solved the riddle, but the dread lingered, sanctified by the pollen-vial’s warmth against his palm—a last cuddle from a world he’d buried to save another. <words>241</words>  
The researchers found him at dawn, whispering to the dead mosses, his astrolabe rusted shut, his eyes reflecting a playground where children laughed, untouched by frost. <words>259</words>  
The frontier remained uncharted, as all true riddles do, but Elias smiled, hearing his daughter’s voice in the greenhouse hum—a lullaby older than pharaohs. <words>277</words>
