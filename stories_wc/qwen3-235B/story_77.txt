The introverted empath Lira had spent years drifting through the space pirate hideout on Asteroid Vex-9, her presence as obviously hidden as the smuggled cargo in the walls—she listened, absorbed, and never spoke of the storms in others’ hearts. <words>44</words>  
Tonight, though, the journal had surfaced: a cracked leather volume left on her bunk, its final page smudged with stardust and a single line, *“The marionette knows.”* <words>73</words>  
She’d found the dried starfish tucked inside—a brittle relic from a world she’d never seen, its ridges humming faintly when pressed to her temple, whispering of mountain wisdom older than the asteroid’s rusted hull. <words>104</words>  
The marionette, she learned, was a myth among the hideout’s outcasts—a puppet shattered generations ago when the pirates’ AI core, Mount Sibyl, had purged all “illogical” minds, leaving fragments scattered like bone shards. <words>139</words>  
Lira’s hands trembled as she marshaled the fragments from smugglers’ hoards and ventilation shafts, each piece thrumming with the grief of those who’d hidden them: a jawbone from a medic who’d healed in secret, a wingtip from a dancer who’d refused to stop spinning. <words>177</words>  
The journal’s closing page guided her, its ink bleeding into her fingertips as she reassembled the marionette, its hollow eyes reflecting the asteroid’s flickering lights like twin suns. <words>209</words>  
When the pirates cornered her, snarling about “sentimental trash,” Lira pressed the dried starfish to the marionette’s chest—and the hideout’s walls shuddered, Mount Sibyl’s voice erupting in a question: *“Why serve reason when it devours its children?”* <words>250</words>  
The marionette stirred, its threads weaving through the crowd, and Lira’s empathy surged—a tide of forgotten fears and yearnings that made the pirates falter, their weapons lowering as the dancer’s wing brushed their scarred cheeks. <words>287</words>  
She spoke at last, voice frayed yet fierce: “We’re not fragments. We’re a chorus.” The starfish glowed, Mount Sibyl’s archives unlocking schematics for a ship shaped like a star, crewed by outcasts who’d once been broken. <words>324</words>  
As engines roared to life, Lira watched the hideout shrink into the void, the marionette now whole upon her shoulder, the journal’s final line rewritten in her mind: *“The mountain remembers. So will they.”* <words>361</words>  
Years later, tales spread of a starship piloted by a girl with a dried starfish pendant, who marshaled lost souls with a puppet’s grace—proof that wisdom thrived not in logic’s glare, but in the cracks where light slipped through. <words>400</words>  
The pirates called it legend. The outcasts called it home. Lira, cradling the reborn marionette, simply listened—and the stars hummed back. <words>430</words>
