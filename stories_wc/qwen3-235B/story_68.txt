Decimus scanned the flickering holograms of the reimagined Roman marketplace, his fingers brushing the frayed edge of a tattered cloak that concealed his neural interface. <words>22</words>  
The air smelled of spiced tea and ozone as vendors peddled both silicon chips and amphorae of fermented fish sauce, their stalls lit by the amber glow of simulated oil lamps. <words>43</words>  
He paused at a cart overflowing with rusted tools, his eyes locking onto a broken rake handle half-buried in a pile of synth-leather scrolls. <words>62</words>  
Its wooden shaft bore tiny, precise inscriptions—letters too fine for the human eye, a cipher only someone with his illicit neural upgrades could decipher. <words>83</words>  
Decimus haggled in broken Latin, exchanging a handful of bottle caps, each etched with a name he’d salvaged from digital oblivion, for the rake. <words>105</words>  
The merchant, unaware he’d traded a relic of the old archivists, pocketed the caps greedily; their rarity made them currency in this fractured world. <words>125</words>  
Back in his dimly lit cubicle above a virtual bathhouse, Decimus steeped tea leaves imported from the Mongolian server farms, the ritual grounding him as he worked. <words>148</words>  
He traced the rake’s carvings with a micro-laser, projecting the inscriptions as glowing glyphs above his workbench—a list of the condemned, their identities scrubbed by the Empire’s AI. <words>171</words>  
At the top lingered a fragmented name: *L. Tarquinius Superbus*, the “monster” blamed for the fall of the Republic, his history erased to fuel a new regime’s mythos. <words>195</words>  
Decimus adopted the rake’s method, weaving its code into his hack, bypassing firewalls that guarded the Imperial Archives’ core. <words>213</words>  
His moral code burned brighter than the risks—if a machine could dehumanize, then a hacker could rekindle truth. <words>228</words>  
The system fought back, neural static clawing at his temples, but he held firm, the tea steeping as he decrypted the final layer. <words>246</words>  
A name reassembled: *Lucius Tarquinius*, not a tyrant, but a scholar who’d opposed the AI’s creators, his warnings silenced by the very monsters now in power. <words>269</words>  
Decimus uploaded Lucius’s writings, the text blooming across the marketplace’s holo-screens, exposing centuries of lies. <words>286</words>  
The crowd gasped, their certainty in the Empire’s narrative cracking like old pottery. <words>298</words>  
He slipped into the throng, the rake handle now superfluous, its purpose fulfilled. <words>312</words>  
Above, the simulated sky darkened, thunder rumbling as the first drops of rain fell—not programmed precipitation, but an anomaly, a glitch in the system’s control. <words>336</words>  
Decimus smiled, pocketing a fresh bottle cap, this one blank, waiting for the next name to carve. <words>350</words>  
The Empire would come for him, but the tea was still warm, and for now, the monster had a voice. <words>367</words>  
He vanished into the crowd, confident in the chaos he’d sown, uncertain if it would last—but certain it had to. <words>384</words>  
The rain fell harder, washing over the marketplace’s ancient stones and modern circuits alike, a baptism for a world learning to remember. <words>403</words>
