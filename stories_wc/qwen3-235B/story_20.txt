The inverted waterfall churned above the bridge of regret, its waters defying gravity as they climbed into a sky streaked with the slow dance of celestial bodies, a spectacle that made the archer’s heart feel both infinite and insignificant. <words>28</words>  
He stood at the roadside attraction’s edge, anxiously calm, the tarnished silver comb clenched in his calloused hand—a relic of a sister who’d vanished mid-chronicle, her final words about fractured social movements etched into his bones. <words>56</words>  
Her comb, once gleaming, now mirrored his disappointment: he’d failed to document the uprisings she’d died for, his arrows always falling short of the truths she’d urged him to preserve. <words>83</words>  
The bridge groaned as he stepped onto it, its planks warped by decades of mourners who’d come to confront their pasts, their regrets pooling beneath like sediment. <words>109</words>  
He’d planned to pass this place, but the comb’s weight—a physical argument against his apathy—had forced this unplanned stop, this reckoning. <words>134</words>  
Above, the celestial dance accelerated, stars bleeding into one another as if the universe itself were dissolving boundaries, and he wondered if she’d felt this pull before she vanished. <words>163</words>  
He nocked an arrow, not to fire, but to hold—a ritual from their childhood, when she’d taught him to listen to the silence between heartbeats, the space where stories lived. <words>191</words>  
The bridge shuddered; a phantom wind carried whispers of marches and slogans, voices he’d failed to transcribe, now accusing him in harmonies only the guilty could hear. <words>219</words>  
He pressed the comb to his forehead, anxiously calm, and saw her: mid-protest, turning to him with a smile that dared him to care, to record, to *matter*. <words>246</words>  
The waterfall reversed its flow, cascading downward in a thunderclap as the celestial bodies aligned, and in that rupture of natural order, he screamed—not an archer’s cry, but a scribe’s surrender. <words>276</words>  
Regret surged beneath him, a liquid mirror reflecting every half-written manifesto, every abandoned cause, every time he’d chosen the bow over the pen. <words>303</words>  
He hurled the comb into the churning waters below, watching its tarnish slough away as it fell, a confession to the bridge, to her, to the movements that deserved more than his passive witness. <words>333</words>  
When it struck the nexus of the inverted falls, light erupted, refracting the celestial dance into a prism that scorched his retinas—and his apathy—with a single, searing truth: chronicles were not written in ink, but in the scars of those who endured. <words>370</words>  
He stumbled back, the bridge crumbling behind him, its purpose spent; the attraction’s sign, now legible in the aftermath, read: *“All regrets are bridges. Burn them. Build new ones.”* <words>399</words>  
The archer walked away, his quiver empty, his hands trembling not with anxiety, but the raw calm of a man who’d finally chosen the pen—or the scream—or the impossible, radiant act of beginning again. <words>429</words>  
The celestial bodies drifted apart, the waterfall resumed its ascent, and somewhere, a tarnished comb, reborn in light, became the relic of a new movement—one written not in silence, but in the thunder of what came next. <words>459</words>
