The agoraphobic mayor of Dustspire clutched the golden snuffbox, its engravings glinting like fractured sunlight, as rain tapped a morse code against the windowpane—<words>17</words>. His office, a vault of velvet curtains and suffocating diplomas, smelled of mildew and inherited duty, the same duty that kept him shackled to this chair since his predecessor’s funeral, when the snuffbox had slid into his hands like a reptile shedding its skin—<words>52</words>. The dunes beyond the city limits whispered, they always did, but tonight their murmurs rode the wind like a choir, harmonizing with the rain’s rhythm, a lullaby his father once claimed could crack the earth’s spine—<words>87</words>.  

He’d spent years avoiding the dunes, avoiding the truth of the snuffbox’s hidden switch, its tiny lever forged in the shape of a scorpion’s tail—a family heirloom, his mother had whispered before vanishing into the sands, meant to “unmake what’s been made.”—<words>123</words>. But the rain’s tempo quickened now, syncopated, insistent, and the mayor’s fingers trembled, not from fear but the weight of *between songs*, that fragile liminal hush when choices calcify into fate—<words>154</words>.  

He cracked the snuffbox open on the third beat, the hidden switch biting his thumb as the mechanism whirred, ancient and hungry—<words>177</words>. A map etched itself in the air: a path through the whispering dunes, glowing like a scar, leading to the grave of the first mayor, the one who’d bargained with the sand-witches to spare his kin from time—<words>207</words>. The burden had always been there, gnawing his bones hollow, but now the rain sang a dirge for resignation, and the mayor stood, coatless, as the office walls dissolved into the scent of wet dust—<words>239</words>.  

He walked into the dunes, each step a pact, the snuffbox ticking like a heart in his palm—<words>258</words>. The sand hissed, serpentine, as the rain pooled in his footprints, mirrors reflecting a sky he’d only seen through glass—<words>280</words>. At the grave, he pressed the snuffbox into the earth, and the dunes erupted in a chorus of voices, his ancestors’, his mother’s, all the mayors who’d failed to break the cycle—<words>309</words>.  

The ground split, a pedestal rising with a second snuffbox, tarnished and open, its switch fused in the “on” position—<words>333</words>. He understood then: the burden wasn’t to be shed but wielded. The rain slowed, and he laughed, raw and startled, as the dunes quieted, their whispers fading into the eager resignation of dawn—<words>364</words>.  

Back in his office, he placed both snuffboxes side by side, their rhythms syncing like twin pulses—<words>383</words>. The door remained locked, but the windows stood open, the scent of wet earth lingering as the band resumed playing between songs, and the mayor, for the first time, hummed along—<words>411</words>.  

The snuffbox stayed closed. For now.—<words>420</words>
