<story>  
The orchard island drifted in the heart of the maelstrom, its apple-laden boughs swaying beneath a waxing moon’s argent glow, while the midwife knelt in the soil, her hands caked with earth and pressed herbs. <words>28</words>  
Thyme was her name, a woman whose critical gaze missed no tremor in a pulse or lie in a whispered confession, her secrecy worn like a second skin—open in its opacity, yet guarding truths even the storm could not wrench free. <words>56</words>  
She had delivered every soul on the island, yet none knew her own history, a void filled by the stolen memories she now sought to reclaim through the charred remnants of lives reduced to ash. <words>84</words>  
The diaries, half-burned and brittle, had been hidden in the hearth of the abandoned midwifery cottage, their pages smudged with soot but still clinging to fragments of names, dates, and incantations tied to the orchard’s cursed soil. <words>113</words>  
By moonlight, Thyme crushed lavender and sage from her satchel, sprinkling them over the fragments; the herbs hissed, their vapors coalescing into spectral ink that rewrote the scorched confessions of those who’d come before her. <words>143</words>  
She learned of the first midwife who’d bargained with the maelstrom to spare a child, binding her soul—and all subsequent keepers—to the island, their memories devoured to sustain the pact. <words>171</words>  
The truth gnawed at her: her own mother had been the last sacrifice, her mind erased, her body swallowed by the whirlpool, leaving Thyme orphaned and amnesiac beneath the gnarled roots of the oldest tree. <words>200</words>  
To transcend the cycle, Thyme wove her herbs into a crown, stepping into the storm’s eye at dawn, the diaries clutched to her chest like a newborn, her voice steady as she spoke the forgotten names into the gale. <words>230</words>  
The maelstrom faltered, its roar dissolving into the rustle of leaves; the orchard shuddered, its apples ripening in an instant, their fallen seeds sprouting into saplings that anchored the island to a calmer sea. <words>259</words>  
Memories surged back—her mother’s lullabies, the weight of a newborn’s first breath, the ache of choices made to protect life—even as the cottage crumbled, its secrets no longer needed. <words>288</words>  
Thyme remained, no longer critical but complete, her wisdom grown from ash and salt, her secrecy softened by the knowledge that some truths, like roots, thrive unseen until the storm relents. <words>317</words>  
The orchard bloomed in dissonant calm, its midwife a bridge between loss and renewal, her hands now still, cradling the quiet certainty that endings could be midwives too. <words>345</words>
