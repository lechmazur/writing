The femme fatale heartbreak counselor stood at the edge of the sky reflection pool, amber earrings humming with residual static from the time storms; they’d always vibrated when desire thickened the air, a compass for the broken. <words>28</words>  
After the invention of time travel, her clientele multiplied—people revisiting lost loves, only to unravel when the past refused to bend—and she alone could navigate their spirals, her restlessly curious mind dissecting the gravity of their wants. <words>56</words>  
She’d zip across the pool’s glassy surface in her moth-eaten hovercraft, chasing cloud trails left by rogue time vessels, each swirl a breadcrumb to a heart’s secret hunger. <words>77</words>  
The earrings, relics from a lover who’d tried to erase their shared history, now pulsed hotter as she neared a new client’s trail—a man who’d looped his wedding day 312 times, drowning in the illusion of control. <words>107</words>  
Her own motive sharpened like a blade: to proclaim herself free, even here in this gilded cage of second chances, where every choice rippled across centuries but never quite mended. <words>134</words>  
The hovercraft’s engine growled as she veered into a storm of fractured minutes, the sky reflection pool below morphing into a kaleidoscope of should-have-beens and almost-weres. <words>160</words>  
She’d learned caution young—her mother’s voice still hissed warnings about desire’s weight—but impulsiveness kept her fingers on the throttle, chasing the next case like a fix. <words>187</words>  
The cloud trail coiled into a vortex above a derelict chapel, its spire cracked by temporal whiplash; inside, the groom-ghost waited, his vows replaying as he dissolved into mist each time the clock struck thirteen. <words>217</words>  
“You think repetition makes truth,” she murmured, amber earrings flaring as she stepped into his loop, her voice cutting through his scripted joy. “But your gravity’s a lie. You’re falling sideways.” <words>246</words>  
He blinked, the timeline shuddering; she’d zipped too close to his core, her own past flickering in the chapel’s stained glass—a younger version of herself, weeping at a similar altar. <words>273</words>  
The gravity of desires, she knew, wasn’t about weight but direction—all her clients pulled toward illusions of escape, even as those illusions caged them tighter. <words>300</words>  
“Break the loop,” she urged, her earrings cracking as they absorbed the groom’s unraveling timeline, a side effect of her method: to track, then tether, then sever. <words>327</words>  
He gasped, the clock tower chiming freedom, and she fled before the paradox backlash could claim her too, her hovercraft screaming into the amber dusk. <words>353</words>  
Back at the pool, her reflection wore his face for a heartbeat—proof she’d meddled too deeply—but the earrings cooled, their task done. <words>378</words>  
She’d never undo her own past, though the temptation zipped through her veins like the hovercraft’s thrusters; proclaiming freedom meant staying present, even in a world where time was clay. <words>407</words>  
The sky reflection pool rippled, a mirror holding all the selves she’d abandoned, and she let it pull her impulse into stillness, curious, always, about the next case—and the next version of herself. <words>437</words>
