The bluffing swindler leaned against a gnarled apple tree in the reclaimed orchard, their boots sinking into soil where skyscraper glass once glittered; the blank price tag dangling from their pocket fluttered in the wind like a dare. <words>22</words>  
They’d sold the tag hours earlier to a mark who believed it would “anchor value” to anything it touched—a lie, but a poetic one, and the swindler’s lethargic energy made honesty feel like too much effort. <words>47</words>  
Then the book fell: leather-bound, water-stained, and caught mid-sentence by the swindler’s outstretched hand before it could kiss the mud. <words>62</words>  
The woman who’d dropped it—her hair a storm of curls, her eyes sharp as pruning shears—smiled, and the swindler felt something unspoken magnetize between them, a pull as old as the orchard’s roots. <words>87</words>  
“I’m Mira,” she said, “I study the old grids.” <words>94</words>  
The swindler lied: “I’m a value consultant.” <words>102</words>  
They both knew. <words>106</words>  
Mira’s invisible allies—hacktivists who’d tunneled through the skyscraper’s corpse to plant trees where servers once hummed—needed someone who could bluff the city’s patrols. <words>127</words>  
The swindler needed a purpose sharper than their usual grifts, a truth they’d bared in whispers to Mira by dawn: the frozen computer in the tower’s core, its restart set for today, would expose how the orchard’s soil was poisoning the city’s elite. <words>157</words>  
“They’ll bulldoze this place if they know,” Mira said, her voice a blend of gentleness and steel. <words>172</words>  
“Then we’ll make them see it’s worth more alive,” the swindler replied, lethargy burned away by the weight of a choice they hadn’t realized they’d make. <words>197</words>  
At the instant the computer flickered awake, its screen casting blue light on rusted rebar, the swindler slammed the blank price tag into the machine’s port. <words>219</words>  
Data surged, magnetizing the orchard’s hidden network: soil sensors, repurposed wires, Mira’s allies streaming live to the city. <words>234</words>  
The screen bloomed with numbers—the true cost of the poison, the incalculable worth of the trees, the swindler’s face reflected in the glow, no longer lying. <words>257</words>  
Patrols arrived, but so did farmers, their shovels raised like banners. <words>267</words>  
The swindler stood beside Mira, their voice steady as they addressed the cameras: “You priced this land at zero. Let’s see what it’s worth when it fights back.” <words>292</words>  
The blank tag, now pulsing with stolen data, became a symbol: value wasn’t assigned, it was seized. <words>307</words>  
The swindler’s hands trembled, not from fear but the sudden, unfamiliar weight of meaning; they’d spent lifetimes evading truths, and now here they were, bared and unflinching. <words>332</words>  
Mira handed them the book—a manifesto on soil regeneration—and said, “Stay if you want.” <words>347</words>  
The swindler, for once, had no quip. <words>355</words>  
They watched the patrols retreat, the orchard’s roots holding fast, and wondered if this was the first honest thing they’d ever done. <words>375</words>  
The computer hummed, the allies cheered, and the swindler, still lethargic but no longer idle, smiled. <words>390</words>  
The truth, they decided, was a currency even they couldn’t cheat. <words>401</words>
