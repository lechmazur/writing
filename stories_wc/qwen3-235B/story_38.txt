<story>  
Elias, the insomniac poet, paced the haunted attic above his rented flat, its slanted shelves crammed with botanical samples he’d stolen from university labs—dried foxglove, crushed violets, stems of hemlock—each labeled in his meticulously messy scrawl. <words>34</words>  
The whispers began at midnight, threading through cracks in the floorboards: warnings in voices too faint to decipher, though their urgency pressed like a migraine. <words>65</words>  
He’d come to eliminate the spectral presence, not through violence, but by unraveling its sorrow—a quest born from his own guilt over a lover’s suicide, a death he’d failed to prevent with words alone. <words>104</words>  
Between subway stops on the F train, Elias scribbled fragments of sonnets in the margins of discarded newspapers, his mind a pendulum swinging between despair and the faint hope that language could mend what flesh could not. <words>143</words>  
The attic’s ghosts, he suspected, were tied to the botanical samples; decades prior, a reclusive scientist had conducted experiments there, seeking a non-violent deterrent to urban violence, only to vanish mid-hypothesis. <words>179</words>  
At after-parties in the professoriate’s dim-lit lofts, Elias feigned drunkenness, coaxing confessions from tenured tongues: the scientist had drowned his research in whiskey, blaming himself for a student’s overdose on his “peaceful” alkaloid brew. <words>217</words>  
The whispers grew louder when Elias arranged the samples into a mandala on the attic’s splintered beams—a ritual of atonement, he guessed, though the ghosts’ grievances remained a cipher. <words>249</words>  
He slept only when dawn bleached the skyline, his dreams haunted by empty abundance: fields of poppies swallowing entire cities, libraries dissolved into mulch, voices chanting, *Listen, listen, listen.* <words>279</words>  
One night, a confession from a weeping grad student revealed the scientist had encoded his final notes into pressed violets, their veins laced with a compound that could quiet rage without erasing will. <words>312</words>  
Elias brewed the violets into a tincture, smearing it on the attic walls as the whispers crescendoed into a name—*Clara*—the scientist’s daughter, who’d leapt from the rooftop after his abandonment. <words>344</words>  
The subway’s rumble vibrated through the floorboards as he worked, time collapsing between stops; he imagined Clara’s ghost sprinting alongside the train, her hair a plume of static. <words>373</words>  
When the attic air stilled at last, Elias collapsed amid the botanical debris, clutching a sonnet draft that ended, *To disarm a ghost, feed it the truth it starves for.* <words>403</words>  
The next morning, sunlight pierced the dust, the whispers gone. On the F train, he overheard two teens debating whether a flower could stop a bullet. He smiled, the weight in his coat pocket—Clara’s violets—already at work. <words>443</words>
