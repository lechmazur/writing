<story>  
The psychic genealogist rolled the chipped die across the rusted table of the space pirate brig, its fractured edge catching the dim light of the dying star outside. <words>17</words>  
Her captors thought her mad, muttering about “destiny’s puzzle” while tracing her family’s bloodline through the diaries of the dead—journals she’d recovered from abandoned bullet trains hurtling between forgotten colonies. <words>41</words>  
But they hadn’t seen what she’d seen: the way the dice, one cracked like her resolve, always landed to mirror the diaries’ cryptic entries, each a fragment of a cosmic riddle tied to her lineage. <words>65</words>  
“Proudly humble,” her grandmother had called her, a paradox the pirates sneered at, yet it was humility that let her kneel beside their captain’s corpse that morning, reading the man’s fate in the pattern of his cooling veins. <words>94</words>  
She’d lengthened his life by three hours, bargaining with lies culled from the diaries—stories of lovers parted by supernovae, of children born screaming prophecies—each tale a thread in the loom of her craft. <words>122</words>  
Now, as the last star guttered into morning light, she whispered to the dice, her voice a blend of dirge and lullaby, the tone she’d mastered after centuries of burying hearts she’d failed to save. <words>150</words>  
The pirates wanted maps to hidden worlds, but all she offered were questions: Why did your great-uncle carve his regrets into a train’s steel hull? Why did your mother flee a dynasty of clockmakers? <words>178</words>  
They didn’t grasp that destiny was a mosaic, each shard a choice, each fracture a chance to rearrange the whole—a truth her genealogy proved, lineage by lineage, sacrifice by sacrifice. <words>206</words>  
When the brig’s alarms blared, she didn’t flinch; heartbreak’s bells had rung louder in her ribs when she’d abandoned her own child to this very ship decades ago, a trade to spare the girl from the genealogist’s curse. <words>237</words>  
The chipped die landed on six, its twin on one. A beginning, an end. She smiled, grave and playful, and tore a page from the final diary—a confession of a pirate queen who’d once been a mother too. <words>266</words>  
The pirates stormed in, blades glinting, but she only held up the dice, their dance complete. “Your fate’s in the trains,” she said, tossing them into the void beyond the brig’s shattered viewport. <words>294</words>  
They followed, of course, as all lost souls do, leaving her alone with the diaries, the light of morning, and the quiet thrill of a puzzle half-solved, a heartbreak hushed, a story—her story—finally still. <words>324</words>
