<story>  
The ruthless flower arranger, Lira, tucked a scuffed plastic comb into her apron pocket, its teeth snagged on a petal of midnight orchid—a reminder of her last commission’s violent perfection. <words>17</words>  
She’d spent years dissecting blooms to dominate botanical competitions, but now her obsession fixated on the watcher’s burden: an ancient directive whispered in the pause between a singer’s verses during a chance encounter at a desert bar. <words>35</words>  
The singer, a drifter with a guitar strung with barbed wire, had sketched a stone circle in the dust of the counter, muttering about rock art that “bled secrets to those who dared distinguish patterns from chaos.” <words>54</words>  
Lira, intellectually spontaneous and starved for a new conquest, stole the drawing and embarked on a road trip, her black van piled with flower shears, watercolor maps, and a thermos of bitter chicory coffee. <words>72</words>  
She picked up a hitchhiker named Kai, a linguist fleeing a failed academic coup, whose rambling theories about proto-writing systems soon intertwined with her own ruthless logic during spontaneous highway debates. <words>93</words>  
“You arrange petals like a surgeon,” Kai noted, watching her pluck thorns from a rose with comb-aided precision. “But what if these symbols aren’t language? What if they’re *instructions*?” <words>113</words>  
Lira scoffed, but later, under a blood-orange sunset, she sketched the stone circle from memory, her comb scratching equations into the dust until Kai distinguished a recurring glyph resembling a coiled serpent. <words>134</words>  
The singer’s verse echoed in her head: *“When the hollow stones hum, the watcher’s burden blooms.”* By midnight, they’d found the site—a ring of moss-eaten monoliths in a dried riverbed, the air thick with petrichor. <words>155</words>  
Kai deciphered the rock art feverishly, tracing the serpent glyph with the comb’s fractured edge, until Lira realized the “art” was a map: a fractal pattern mirroring the van’s tire tracks, the coffee grounds, the veins in her own hands. <words>178</words>  
The watcher’s burden crystallized—a pact between the stones and those who saw too deeply. To decode the art was to become its custodian, bound to guard its chaos against those who’d weaponize its order. <words>200</words>  
Lira laughed, sharp and bright, her spontaneous intellect weaving a third path: she snapped photos with her disposable camera, then hurled the comb into the circle’s heart, where it fused with the glyphs in a flash of bioluminescent green. <words>223</words>  
Kai protested, but she silenced him with a look, her motive shifting from conquest to release—the art’s true power lay not in answers, but in the polite anarchy of its unanswered questions. <words>245</words>  
As dawn bled across the stones, they drove west, Lira arranging a bouquet of sagebrush and barbed wire in the passenger seat, the singer’s verse now her own: *“What’s seen cannot unsee—so let the wild things breathe.”* <words>268</words>  
The comb remained, a scuffed relic in the dirt, its teeth forever distinguishing the line between keeper and chaos, while the stones hummed for the next watcher foolish enough to listen. <words>290</words>
