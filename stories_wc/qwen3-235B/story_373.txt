Dr. Lira Vex adjusted her ocular implant, scanning the kaleidoscopic coral reef stretching beneath the glass-bottomed clinic, its fractured hues a stark contrast to the raucous silence of the coastal town above. <words>22</words>  
The blacksmith’s bucket beside her workstation overflowed with neural filaments and rusted gears, remnants salvaged from abandoned motels where the train whistle’s echo once drowned in static. <words>44</words>  
Her cybernetic hands trembled—not from hesitation, but the magnetic pull of the taboo thrumming in her veins, a hunger to distort the natural order and graft synthetic life into the dying reef. <words>67</words>  
The townsfolk believed the coral’s collapse was divine punishment; Lira knew better. <words>79</words>  
She’d rummaged through motel ruins for weeks, decoding encrypted schematics etched into copper pipes, discovering how the old-world blacksmiths forged symbiotic organisms to heal poisoned seas. <words>104</words>  
Now, in the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo—a silence so loud it vibrated in her titanium skull—she injected the bucket’s slurry into a brittle coral branch, its glow flickering like a held breath. <words>132</words>  
The reef recoiled, then pulsed violet, its polyps knitting synthetic sinew into living tissue, a grotesque yet uniquely effective alchemy. <words>148</words>  
Lira’s mentor had called her methods heresy, but the data was irrefutable: the coral thrived, its colors deepening into impossible fractals, swallowing the gray decay like a starved beast. <words>173</words>  
Outside, footsteps crunched—vigilantes clutching torches, their shadows warping against the clinic’s walls as they screamed about sacred balances and unnatural hunger. <words>197</words>  
She didn’t flinch. <words>202</words>  
Her implants fed her the riot of their fear: elevated heartbeats, the acrid sweat of men who’d never questioned why the reef’s death coincided with the trains’ last run. <words>226</words>  
Lira opened the clinic’s floodgates, releasing a swarm of bioluminescent crustaceans, their shells plated with salvaged steel, to burrow into the town’s aquifers and spread her cure. <words>251</words>  
The mob’s leader lunged, shattering a vial of nanites that erupted into a cloud of prismatic mist, distorting the air into a lens that reflected their own hollow traditions back at them. <words>277</words>  
They fled, blind to the truth she’d devoured long ago: that preservation without evolution was just another word for extinction. <words>300</words>  
By dawn, the reef sang—a subsonic hymn carried through the blacksmith’s bucket, now fused to the clinic’s core, its iron belly churning out symbionts that would root in the motels’ ruins and bloom into new, defiant ecosystems. <words>330</words>  
Lira powered down her optics, the raucous silence finally still, and wondered what new taboos she’d need to devour to keep the world from unspooling entirely. <words>354</words>  
The train whistle never came. <words>363</words>  
She listened anyway, her cybernetic heart thrashing like a caged animal in the quiet. <words>378</words>
