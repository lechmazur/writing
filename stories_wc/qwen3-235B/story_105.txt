<story>  
The outcast scholar knelt in the hush of a half-lit corridor, their trembling hands brushing dust off a seashell etched with a symbol that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>17</words>  
They had followed whispers to the witch’s flying carpet garage, where diaries hidden behind a cracked tile in a public restroom spoke of soul-mirroring—a ritual to fracture time and glimpse eternity. <words>40</words>  
The scholar’s exile had hinged on their obsession with proving midnight’s impermanence, a theory mocked by the academies, yet here the shell hummed with a strangely trustworthy energy, as if it knew them. <words>65</words>  
A jolt shot up their spine as the shell’s glow intensified, projecting a spectral corridor that overlapped the real one, its walls lined with faces they recognized—versions of themselves, screaming silently. <words>93</words>  
The diaries warned of this: soul-mirroring demanded a price, a confrontation with the selves abandoned in the march toward survival. <words>112</words>  
The witch’s garage rumbled above, carpets whirring like trapped birds, but the scholar stayed rooted, gripping the shell as their darkest midnight-self materialized—a shadow with their eyes, grinning. <words>140</words>  
“Midnight only lasts so long,” the scholar hissed, their voice cracking, and the shadow lunged, the corridor shuddering as the two collided into a vortex of fractured light. <words>165</words>  
Memories flooded them: the trial where they’d been cast out, the nights spent decoding the diaries by candlelight, the moment they’d pried open the tile to find the witch’s chronicles of failed rituals. <words>194</words>  
The shadow-self hissed, “You’ll drown in this,” but the scholar pressed the shell to their chest, its symbol searing their skin, and the vortex stilled, leaving only their mirrored reflection—human, weary, real. <words>224</words>  
Above, the garage doors groaned open, moonlight spilling onto the corridor as the witch descended on a frayed carpet, her laughter sharp. <words>243</words>  
“You used the shell,” she said, not unkindly, and the scholar realized the witch had left the diaries precisely for this—proof that even exiles could bend time. <words>267</words>  
The shadow dissolved, the corridor brightened, and the scholar pocketed the shell, its frantic peace now a compass. <words>285</words>  
They emerged into the night, the witch’s carpet trailing behind, and for the first time, the stars seemed to wink, as if acknowledging the truth they’d carved from the dark: midnight was just a threshold. <words>314</words>  
The diaries’ final entry echoed in their mind—*“The soul is a mosaic; every shard matters”*—and the scholar smiled, the air humming with the promise of dawns they’d once feared lost. <words>342</words>  
Their redemption was not in being found trustworthy, but in trusting the jolt of the unknown, the shell’s symbol now a map to stitch their scattered selves into something whole. <words>371</words>  
As the carpet soared, the scholar glanced back at the corridor, its half-light fading, and whispered to the wind: “It never lasts.” <words>394</words>  
The witch cackled, the shell glowed, and the world—once fractured—felt, for a breathless moment, mirrored in perfect, fleeting alignment. <words>415</words>
