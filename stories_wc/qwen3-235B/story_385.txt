<story>  
Clara, a self-appointed guardian of lost causes, tiptoed past the nurses’ station of the Harborview Hospital ICU, her sneakers silent on the linoleum. <words>17</words>  
The obsidian skyscraper across the bay loomed beyond the window, its mirrored surface fractured by predawn fog, reflecting the ward’s dim glow like a ghostly twin. <words>34</words>  
She’d decoded fragments of the symbols etched into its foundation weeks prior, linking them to the rusted ice skates buried in her neighbor’s garden—a puzzle he’d died mid-solution. <words>52</words>  
Her “meddling,” as the nurses called it, wasn’t malicious; she simply hated loose ends, especially those humming with the same eerie resonance as the scattered poppy seeds on his autopsy report. <words>71</words>  
A trail of damp footprints, evaporating like breath, led from the hospital’s emergency exit to the beach below, where the tide gnawed at the sand. <words>88</words>  
Clara followed, the skates slung over her shoulder, their corroded blades whispering secrets she couldn’t yet parse. <words>100</words>  
The wanderer’s prints zigzagged erratically, as though the figure had danced with shadows, each step weakening the boundary between the living and whatever lurked beneath the waves. <words>119</words>  
At the water’s edge, she spotted the nexus: a circle of seeds sprouting faintly luminous shoots, arranged in the same geometric pattern as the skyscraper’s subterranean carvings. <words>138</words>  
The skates vibrated when she knelt, their rust flaking to reveal glyphs identical to those haunting her notebooks—a language of decay and renewal, tied to the tower’s construction on sacred, salt-poisoned soil. <words>160</words>  
Clara’s manipulative charm had coerced a janitor into unlocking the roof hours earlier; from there, she’d watched the footprints materialize nightly, a ritual eroding the skyscraper’s cursed sentience. <words>182</words>  
She laced the skates onto her feet, the metal warming unnaturally, and glided into the seed-circle. <words>195</words>  
Memories not her own flooded in: a fisherman’s daughter carving symbols into skate blades to bind a leviathan, the village that drowned her for it, the tower risen on her grave. <words>216</words>  
The wanderer’s footprints were hers now, inherited with each revolution, weakening the entity coiled under the skyscraper’s keel—a god fed by forgotten names, starved by her defiance. <words>238</words>  
Dawn bled gold over the horizon as the tower shuddered, its reflection splintering; Clara stumbled ashore, the skates disintegrating into salt-crusted dust. <words>256</words>  
Back in the ward, a nurse frowned at her damp scrubs. “Visiting hours are restricted, Ms. Clara.” <words>268</words>  
“Ah, but consider the alternative,” Clara said, patting the woman’s arm—a pleasant meddler’s farewell—as monitors beeped newfound stability into the silent rooms. <words>287</words>  
The skyscraper stood inert, its hunger postponed, while the seeds beneath the waves curled into dormancy, awaiting a future hand to decipher their purpose. <words>306</words>  
Clara smiled. Loose ends, after all, were only temporary. <words>315</words>  
The footprints would return, but so would she—openly, insistently, a lucid thread in the world’s half-coherent tapestry. <words>330</words>  
Her sneakers squeaked triumphantly on the tiles. <words>336</words>
