<story>  
The nervous kingpin traced the ridges of a dried seed pod with a thumbnail, its brittle ribs crumbling under the habit he couldn’t break. <words>17</words>  
Midwinter’s restless hush pressed against the enclave’s walls, a silence that felt like a held breath—or a blade. <words>25</words>  
He’d always hated the gardens, those communal plots where dissenters whispered to the soil instead of the Party, their hands stained with the improbable green of defiance. <words>40</words>  
Yet here he was, rerouting his patrol skiff past the checkpoint, lured by a rusted sign half-buried in snow: *“Roots Outlive Storms.”* <words>53</words>  
The detour unsettled him, the way the enclave’s xenophobic chants echoed in his skull like a second heartbeat. *“Outside seeds rot our soil. Outside winds kill our crops.”* <words>68</words>  
But the seed pod in his palm—spherical, barbed, stubborn—was proof of what they’d never admit: the gardens thrived because they *listened* to the world beyond the walls. <words>84</words>  
He found the landmark half-frozen: a skeletal tree grafted with branches from a dozen species, its roots cradling a bed of those same seed pods, split open and sowing themselves. <words>102</words>  
A child’s voice startled him—a girl in a patched coat, clutching a trowel. “They’re *adapted*,” she said, as if he’d asked. “The pods only sprout when they’re cracked.” <words>119</words>  
He should’ve arrested her. Instead, he dropped his own seed pod into her pile, watching it clatter like a confession. <words>131</words>  
The enclave’s doctrine demanded he crush such moments, but the fragile ferocity in the girl’s eyes mirrored his own secret: indifference was the true rot. <words>147</words>  
He’d spent years hoarding power like a miser, yet here, the gardens’ logic festered—a communal truth he couldn’t poison. <words>161</words>  
Returning to the compound, he stared at the map of checkpoints and walls, then marked a new route: through the orchards, past the greenhouses, into the heart of the enclave’s lie. <words>179</words>  
They’d call it weakness. But when the skiff rolled into the central square, trailing dirt and sprigs of coriander, he stood, voice fraying like old rope. <words>194</words>  
“The gardens stay,” he growled, tossing a fresh seed pod onto the command table—a thing both broken and alive. <words>207</words>  
The room stiffened, but no one spoke. Outside, the wind carried the scent of thawing earth, a midwinter miracle no one dared name. <words>221</words>  
He’d never been a brave man. But the unlikely probable—the stubborn arithmetic of roots—had shifted his axis. <words>235</words>  
By dawn, the enclave’s walls bore new graffiti: *“Cracked Open. Growing Anyway.”* <words>246</words>  
The kingpin didn’t smile. He pressed a hand to the cold glass, feeling the tremor of a world unfurling, and hoped the girl’s garden could forgive him. <words>262</words>  
Indifference was a tyranny he’d once served. Now, he’d wield the only weapon he had left: the quiet, unyielding arithmetic of a seed. <words>278</words>
