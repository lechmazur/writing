<story>  
The frail guard traced the chipped hilt of his rusted sword, his fingers trembling as the tide whispered promises of escape against the tidal island’s jagged cliffs. <words>17</words>  
He had been assigned here for his “resolutely wavering” loyalty—a paradoxical compliment from the commander who’d branded him a relic of a fallen regime, too weak to execute but too dangerous to trust. <words>35</words>  
Each dawn, he patrolled the salt-crusted paths, eyes lingering on the gnarled trees whose bark bore messages carved by forgotten prisoners: *“The phial opens the gate,”* one read, though no key or vial had he ever found. <words>54</words>  
His motivation was neither bravery nor rebellion, but a quiet refusal to die as a footnote in someone else’s painted allegiances, a pawn in the endless war between the island’s warring dukes. <words>73</words>  
Then, on his final patrol before the monthly supply ship arrived, he stumbled upon a sour-smelling alchemy phial wedged in a tide pool, its glass slick with seaweed and its contents swirling like liquid night. <words>93</words>  
The phial’s scent clawed at his throat, but he pocketed it anyway, recalling the carvings: *“When the moon bleeds, pour the truth into the roots.”* <words>108</words>  
That night, as the lunar eclipse painted the sky crimson, he yanked the phial’s cork free, the stopper resisting like a held breath before releasing a vapor that made the cliffs shudder and the trees groan. <words>128</words>  
From the bark of the oldest sentinel, a new message bled into existence: *“Drink, and the tide will carry you home.”* <words>139</words>  
He hesitated—the phial’s contents looked like drowned ink, and his wavering resolve thickened into terror—but the thought of another year shackled to this place curdled his blood more than the sour fumes. <words>159</words>  
He drank. <words>161</words>  
The world dissolved into a cacophony of creaking wood and roaring waves, and when his vision cleared, he stood ankle-deep in a hidden cove, the cliffs now laddered with bioluminescent vines. <words>179</words>  
Above, the trees’ carvings had rearranged: *“The guard becomes the ghost. Remember us.”* <words>187</words>  
He ran, the phial’s magic burning in his veins, until he found the supply ship’s rowboat, its oars manned by spectral figures whose faces mirrored his own—former guards, their eyes hollow with the weight of painted allegiances they’d outrun. <words>208</words>  
As the island shrank behind him, he clutched the empty phial, its sourness lingering like regret, and wondered if he’d traded one fate for another. <words>224</words>  
But when dawn broke, the ghosts were gone, and the mainland’s shores rose ahead, rugged and unnamed. <words>234</words>  
He stepped onto the sand, frailty still stitched into his bones, yet for the first time, his wavering heart beat in time with his own pulse, not another’s command. <words>250</words>  
The trees here had no carvings. <words>255</words>  
He knelt, dug his hands into the soil, and waited for a new message to grow. <words>263</words>
