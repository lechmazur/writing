The small-town librarian, Mira, dusted the shelves of the Hemlock Creek Historical Society, her fingers pausing on a brittle map marked “Portal Canyon.” <words>17</words>  
A stolen museum artifact tag had arrived anonymously that morning, its scanned glyphs matching carvings in the canyon—and hinting at a secret harvest. <words>35</words>  
She’d spent decades curating tales of the canyon’s portal-strewn cliffs, yet none mentioned the artifact’s jagged sigil, a symbol of “grace” etched by hands long dust. <words>60</words>  
Mira’s motivation was neither fame nor gold; she craved the kind of legendhood that lingered in whispers, the sort the canyon’s silent watchers—generations of stone-faced guardians—might deign to repeat. <words>92</words>  
The artifact, she theorized, was perfectly flawed: a key designed to dismantle itself, its power leaking like honey from a cracked jar. <words>117</words>  
Her plan hinged on a shared obsession: decades prior, a traveling historian had bonded with her over chokecherry pie, a tart delicacy that mirrored their mutual hunger for unsolved riddles. <words>147</words>  
He’d vanished after the canyon’s last seismic shift, leaving behind a note: “Grace isn’t found; it’s harvested where logic rots.” <words>167</words>  
Mira baked a pie using his recipe, the scent luring the canyon’s current guardian—a wiry, skeptical ranger—into her trap of half-truths and crimped crust. <words>195</words>  
Together, they navigated the canyon’s labyrinths, the artifact tag glowing faintly near portals that hummed with the static of collapsed timelines. <words>220</words>  
The carvings, she realized, weren’t decorations but instructions: to dismantle grace was to let it flourish, a paradox the ancients had weaponized. <words>246</words>  
Mocking sincerity dripped from her voice as she explained to the ranger, “We’re not here to steal. We’re here to… *prune*.” <words>267</words>  
He laughed, a sharp, surprised sound, and handed her a shard of obsidian pie tin shaped like a key. “Let’s dismantle, then.” <words>289</words>  
At the canyon’s heart, they found the artifact—a pulsing crystal choked by invasive vines—their pies offered as tribute to the silent watchers, who stirred like wind. <words>316</words>  
Mira twisted the shard into the sigil, the crystal fracturing into dust that settled on the ranger’s boots, the rocks, her own trembling hands. <words>342</words>  
Grace, she understood now, was the flaw—the unyielding crack where light escaped, not through triumph, but through surrender. <words>364</words>  
The canyon shuddered, portals winking shut one by one, while the watchers’ whispers braided her name into their eternal vigil. <words>387</words>  
Mira returned to Hemlock Creek, her legend already mutating: some said she’d stolen heaven, others that she’d baked it into oblivion. <words>409</words>  
The artifact tag remained in her desk, a reminder that to be perfectly flawed was to be unforgettable—a footnote in the margins of time’s grand tome. <words>437</words>  
And when tourists asked about the canyon’s silence, she’d smile, serving chokecherry pie to strangers who might one day inherit the whispering. <words>459</words>
