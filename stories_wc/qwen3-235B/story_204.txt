The professional cuddler adjusted their lavender-scented scarf, the fabric fraying at the edges like the patience of clients who sought solace in their arms, and slipped the phantom train ticket punch into their coat pocket—a relic from a father who’d vanished mid-embarkation, leaving only its jagged teeth as proof he’d ever boarded. <words>47</words>  
They’d found it at the farmer’s market, nestled between bruised plums and a vendor hawking “authentic nostalgia,” the punch humming faintly when their fingers brushed its brass surface, as though it recognized the unusually usual rhythm of their heartbeat. <words>85</words>  
The unspoken rules of their trade dictated no questions about clients’ pasts, but the punch defied such codes, its phantom ink staining their thumb with coordinates to an abandoned spaceport hangar ten klicks east, where the air still reeked of oxidized steel and forgotten ambition. <words>123</words>  
They arrived as dusk pooled beneath the hangar’s skeletal frame, the decay of its once-proud arches mirroring the slow rot of their own resolve; inside, holographic ticket stubs flickered like trapped fireflies, replaying the panicked exodus of a colony ship that had never launched. <words>161</words>  
A voice, gravel and static, interrupted their trance: “You’re here for the punchline, aren’t you?” A woman emerged, her face half-hidden by a respirator, eyes sharp with the weight of someone who’d survived the prejudice of being called “unfit” for her radiation-scarred skin. <words>200</words>  
The cuddler recoiled—not from her appearance, but from the realization that their father’s stories of “clean” space, untainted by Earth’s mistakes, had bred a venom they’d never named until now. <words>234</words>  
She gestured to the punch, its teeth now glowing crimson. “It only works if you let go,” she said, and they understood: the device didn’t validate tickets—it absolved guilt, etching forgiveness into the bearer’s DNA by forcing them to confront the rot they carried. <words>273</words>  
As the hangar trembled, its decay accelerating, they pressed the punch to their palm, a scream lodged in their throat as visions flooded in: their father, not lost, but exiled for refusing to abandon the sick; the woman before them, his daughter, erased from records but not memory. <words>314</words>  
The unspoken rule of their profession crumbled—touch could no longer suffice; truth demanded more. They knelt, offering her the punch, their voice raw. “I’m sorry I didn’t see you.” <words>349</words>  
Outside, dawn bled orange across the tarmac. The acceptance speech they’d reheised—the one about “bridging divides”—now felt hollow, a script written for a world that had forgotten how to listen. <words>383</words>  
But as the woman’s gloved hand closed over theirs, the hangar’s walls dissolved into a constellation of ticket stubs, each one a life once dismissed, now burning bright. The cuddler breathed in, the lavender and rust merging, and stepped forward into the hush before the speech began, ready to speak the rules no one had dared to name. <words>427</words>  
The punch, heavy in their pocket, pulsed like a second heart. <words>434</words>
