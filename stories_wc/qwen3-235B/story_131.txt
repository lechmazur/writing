<story>  
The orphan, Milo, moved through the dusty garage with the detached efficiency of someone accustomed to impermanence, their sleeves rolled up to reveal faint scars that whispered of forgotten struggles. <words>27</words>  
They paused when a glint beneath a rusted lawnmower caught their eye—a lottery ticket, curled and faded, bearing the smudged message: “Loosen what gravity cannot hold.” <words>52</words>  
A softly audible hum resonated as they straightened, the air itself seeming to ripple near the garage’s cracked back wall, where shadows pooled unnaturally. <words>75</words>  
Milo’s collection of smooth stones, clinking in their coat pocket, grew warm—a tactile reassurance honed over years of sleepless nights and hollow silences. <words>100</words>  
The gravitational anomaly revealed itself gradually: a floating washer, a suspended spiderweb drooping upward, a puddle of rainwater arching into the void like liquid glass. <words>129</words>  
Milo’s breath hitched, fear a familiar knot in their chest, but the stones’ cool surfaces pressed against their palm, grounding them in the present. <words>156</words>  
They traced the ticket’s cryptic words again, connecting the directive to the anomaly’s erratic pulse—a puzzle demanding instinct over logic. <words>181</words>  
Adapt or perish, their foster father had once growled during a hiking trip, before abandoning them at thirteen; Milo had survived since by becoming fluid, unattached. <words>210</words>  
Now, survival required something different: courage forged from the very fear that had sharpened their edges. <words>229</words>  
They loosened their grip on the stones, letting one slip into the warped space, where it hovered momentarily before the anomaly shuddered, its pull weakening. <words>257</words>  
Another stone followed, then another, each release a small rebellion against the instinct to cling, to endure alone. <words>282</words>  
The hum deepened into a groan as the stones aligned in midair, their smooth surfaces reflecting the anomaly’s eerie glow like a constellation of calm. <words>310</words>  
Milo’s throat tightened with something dangerously close to affection for these silent companions, this motley crew of river-worn survivors. <words>336</words>  
The final stone bridged the gap, and the anomaly collapsed inward with a sigh, leaving behind stillness—and a lottery ticket now blank as a newborn’s palm. <words>365</words>  
They pocketed it, a relic of the moment they’d chosen transformation over survival, detachment giving way to a tentative, aching hope. <words>392</words>  
Outside, birdsong pierced the quiet, and Milo stood in the garage doorway, shoulders lighter, the stones’ absence a warm echo of what they’d loosened. <words>421</words>  
The world remained vast and unkind, but for once, they met it not as an orphan adrift, but as someone who’d bent and not broken, listening to the weightless space where fear had been. <words>457</words>
