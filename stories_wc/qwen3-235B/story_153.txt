<story>  
The eternal college student adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp, its brittle straps biting into their temples, a relic from a collapsed mine that still glowed with a mundanely glorious yellow hum—useless for illumination in the bioluminescent tunnels of the mole people’s underground city, but worn as a talisman of debt. <words>47</words>  
They had studied immortality for 327 years, scribbling equations on cave walls and digitizing their consciousness into journals swapped with nameless travelers who emerged from the collapsing strata above, each ledger a fractured map of borrowed lives. <words>78</words>  
The mole people called them “the Unburned,” for they had outlived the last star, their devotion to self-mastery as detached as the fungal spores drifting through the cavern air, a thousand forgotten identities calcified in their ribs. <words>109</words>  
Tonight, they traced the Gifted Burdens, a ledger of equations etched into mica sheets, its formulae promising to unravel the knot of their endlessness by aligning the headlamp’s flicker with the city’s dying geothermal core. <words>144</words>  
The method was recursive: swap journals with a mole archivist, absorb their memories of suffocating in the mine’s collapse, then graft those final seconds onto their own neural lattice, digitizing trauma into transcendence. <words>176</words>  
They found the archivist in the Salt Scriptorium, its clawed hands transcribing seismic charts into braille, and offered the headlamp in exchange—a fair trade, for the archivist’s journals reeked of damp earth and final breaths. <words>210</words>  
As the mole creature’s memories flooded their mind, the student saw the mine’s collapse: a coal miner’s face pressed to the headlamp’s glass, its light a mundanely glorious beacon before the walls caved in, a moment of clarity in the crush. <words>245</words>  
The equation flared alive. Their body unraveled into data, each cell a pixel dissolving into the city’s geothermal haze, their consciousness fracturing across the mole people’s archives, a master of reality only insofar as they had become its ghost. <words>280</words>  
But the burden lingered—the headlamp’s glow dimmed, yet still clung to their spectral hands, a loop of borrowed light in a place where stars were myths, their devotion now a hollow script repeated in fungal blooms and tremor charts. <words>315</words>  
They had mastered their reality, yet here they remained: unburned, unbound, and forever mining the same instant of annihilation, the gifted burden of glory being its own echo. <words>347</words>  
The mole archivist watched the fading specter, then added a final line to the ledger: “To become eternal is to become the thing that outlasts even memory.” The headlamp’s shell clattered to the ground, mundane, unglorious, and empty. <words>382</words>  
In the silence after the last star, the city breathed through its wounds, and the Unburned’s journal closed itself, its pages as blank as the eyes of the dead miner who once wore the light. <words>412</words>
