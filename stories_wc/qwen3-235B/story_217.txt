The first ring of the phone sliced through the rusted silence of the abandoned amusement park, its shrill echo twisting the warped metal gates into a semblance of motion. <words>17</words>  
Juniper “June” Vega, an underestimated rebel with a pocket knife boasting seven blades and a heart primed by loss, answered—not because she expected salvation, but because stagnation had always terrified her more than ghosts. <words>42</words>  
The voice on the line was familiar, cracked with static and sorrow: her brother’s, vanished a year ago after ranting about a “cursed carousel” and a “kitchen of shadows.” <words>63</words>  
She pocketed the knife—gifted by their mother, each blade etched with a different herb from their Korean BBQ joint—and followed the coordinates he’d texted, her boots crunching through glass and wasabi-scented memories. <words>89</words>  
The haunted house loomed, its façade a grotesque grin of peeling neon and rotting wood, but June smelled something sadder than decay: burnt kimchi, the dish her brother had hated but their mother had perfected. <words>114</words>  
Inside, the air thickened with the ephemeral gloom of forgotten laughter and chili paste, walls lined with mirrors that reflected not faces, but half-remembered meals—June’s father laughing over marinated bulgogi, her brother’s ghost flickering beside him. <words>141</words>  
A blade of the knife glinted as she unsheathed the “sesame” blade, its edge sharp enough to slit spectral threads; the house hissed, adapting, morphing corridors into a maze of sizzling cast-iron pans and sobbing clowns. <words>167</words>  
She pressed on, the tone of her breath shifting from dread to a sadly joyful hum—the same tune her mother sang while grinding spices, now a dirge for a family fractured by hunger for more. <words>193</words>  
In the core of the maze, June found him: her brother, chained to a stove by tendrils of congealed gochujang, his voice a rasp. “They’re trapped here,” he gasped. “Chefs. Diners. All who forgot food is love.” <words>222</words>  
The final blade—“perilla,” rusted but resilient—severed the sauce-thick chains as June recited recipes like incantations, the house trembling; adaptation was survival, and survival demanded wonder. <words>248</words>  
Flickering souls gathered, their forms stabilizing as she tossed chili flakes into a phantom flame, the heat painting the walls with murals of Seoul night markets and their mother’s smile. <words>274</words>  
When the carousel outside began to turn, its horses galloping on gusts of sesame oil, June’s heart swelled—not with closure, but with the aching, joyful knowledge that even rot could birth mushrooms, that ghosts could feast. <words>303</words>  
The house exhaled, its gloom lifting like steam, and her brother’s hand brushed hers, solid for a heartbeat. “You always saw the meal behind the hunger,” he whispered, dissolving into star anise-scented mist. <words>331</words>  
Outside, dawn bled orange as June closed the knife, its blades humming a dissonant lullaby. She walked away, the park’s ghosts digesting their past, her own heart still breaking, still wonder-struck—adaptation’s bitter aftertaste lingering, alive. <words>360</words>
