<story>  
The ambivalent prophet knelt in the dust of the lunar mining colony’s abandoned sector, their gloved hands sifting through a rusted box from a forgotten rummage sale. <words>22</words>  
Inside lay a collection of marbles, cracked and clouded with lunar grit, their fractured surfaces reflecting the dim glow of distant methane flares. <words>40</words>  
They had not sought prophecy, but the moon’s silence had pressed into their skull one day, whispering equations only they could unravel—equations that mapped the cosmic scoreboard, a ledger of all fates, glowing faintly in their mind’s peripheral static. <words>75</words>  
The marbles, they realized, were keys: each jagged edge a fragment of a jigsaw puzzle that, when solved, would defragment the scoreboard’s scrambled code. <words>98</words>  
Their heart thrummed with bashful arrogance—the knowledge that only they could see the patterns, yet the dread of what it meant to wield such power. <words>117</words>  
Between heartbeats, time stretched thin, moments elongating like taffy as they pieced together the marbles’ edges, their cracked seams aligning to form a lattice of light. <words>140</words>  
The colony’s overseers had called them “happily sad,” a paradox muttered in passing, unaware how the phrase coiled in the prophet’s bones—a truth they wore like a shroud. <words>164</words>  
To scramble the scoreboard was their quiet rebellion: to erase the overseers’ ledgers of debt, the miners’ lifespans etched in stone, the moon’s slow bleed into corporate oblivion. <words>190</words>  
The final oath sat bitter-sweet on their tongue, a vow to shatter the system’s symmetry, to let chaos bloom in the void where order had calcified. <words>213</words>  
As the last marble clicked into place, the prophet’s vision erupted—a supernova of data-streams, the scoreboard fracturing into a trillion shards that scattered like glass across the colony’s domes. <words>238</words>  
They gasped, feeling the weight of a thousand unlived lives lift, replaced by the hollow ache of responsibility. <words>253</words>  
The miners below would never know how close they’d come to being numbers, nor how the prophet’s hands had trembled as they rewrote the math of their existence. <words>278</words>  
In the silence after the collapse, the prophet stood, their breath fogging the inside of their helmet, and wondered if redemption could be measured in shattered crystal and stolen seconds. <words>303</words>  
The marbles, now dull and inert, slipped from their grasp, rolling into the shadows of conveyor belts and ore carts, their purpose spent. <words>323</words>  
Above, the methane flares flickered, their light bending through the cracked dome like a benediction, and the prophet smiled—a small, crooked thing—before turning back toward the colony’s hum. <words>348</words>  
They would not be remembered, not as a savior nor a saboteur, but in the quiet rebellion of unbalanced equations, they had carved a universe where fate was no longer a ledger, but a question. <words>375</words>  
The moon groaned beneath their boots, a new rhythm pulsing in its core, and the prophet walked on, happily sad, their oath dissolving into the dust of a world learning to breathe anew. <words>402</words>
