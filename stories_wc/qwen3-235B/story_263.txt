<story>  
The zealot assassin known as Morvain the Unwavering adjusted his coral-framed goggles, the reef-city of Thalassia shimmering in hues of poison-green and bruise-purple beneath the twin moons. <words>17</words>  
His target: High Curator Lysandra, the so-called “Guardian of Tides,” who paraded her virtue while hoarding the ocean’s spoils—ironic, given Morvain’s own mission to consolidate the depths’ true legacy. <words>35</words>  
He’d waited weeks for this nature walk, where Lysandra’s followers would trail her like gullible minnows, reciting parables about the “Epic of the Drowned King.” <words>50</words>  
Morvain scoffed; he’d once served that king, whose “tyranny” had merely been honesty—unlike Lysandra’s sanctimonious lies. <words>63</words>  
He patted the faded carnival plush strapped to his belt, its threadbare tentacles frayed from decades of neglect; it was the only relic from his childhood, a prize won by the Drowned King himself. <words>84</words>  
*Calculatedly playful*, he hummed a nursery rhyme as he primed the echo-reversal device, its gears whirring like a wounded crustacean. <words>97</words>  
The plan was simple: amplify Lysandra’s own words against her, twist her sermons into confessions, and let the crowd’s adoration curdle into revulsion. <words>115</words>  
When the Curator’s procession arrived, Morvain slipped into the shadows, his dark wetsuit blending with the bioluminescent coral. <words>130</words>  
“…and thus,” Lysandra declared, hefting a glowing trident, “the Drowned King’s reign was a blight, erased by the gods’ mercy!” <words>146</words>  
Morvain snorted—a sound magnified and warped by the device, ricocheting through the reef’s tunnels until it echoed as a chorus of derisive laughter. <words>163</words>  
The crowd froze. “Who dares?” Lysandra hissed, her voice trembling as the reversed echoes looped her own phrase: *“A blight, erased by mercy!”* <words>180</words>  
Panic rippled. Morvain tossed the plush into her path, its button eyes gleaming. “A souvenir from your hero’s last carnival,” he stage-whispered, voice disguised as a drowned sailor’s. <words>200</words>  
Chaos erupted. Lysandra scrambled to reclaim authority, but the crowd now saw her as a fraud—her “divine” trident flickering, its power siphoned by Morvain’s earlier sabotage. <words>219</words>  
He surfaced beside a kelp forest, watching the reef-city’s spires tremble with doubt. The plush, the echoes, the timing—all precise, yet tinged with mischief. <words>237</words>  
Later, in his hideout carved from a sunken leviathan’s skull, Morvain polished the trident, its true name whispered from Lysandra’s mind during her final moments. <words>255</words>  
The world would remember her as a martyr. He’d ensure the epic’s retelling—from the villain’s tongue, where truth festered like unhealed wounds. <words>273</words>  
As dawn bleached the waves, he penned his memoirs, the plush perched sentinel, its stitches grinning in the gloom. <words>288</words>  
Morality, he mused, was just another current—pulling fools ashore, while those who swam *against* it carved their own legends. <words>305</words>  
The assassin’s work was done. The reef thrived in its new discord, and the Drowned King’s legacy, though slandered, lived in whispers—*his* whispers. <words>324</words>  
He laughed, low and resonant, a sound the coral walls absorbed hungrily. Even villains deserved applause, after all. <words>340</words>  
And if the plush’s floppy tentacle brushed his cheek as he slept? Well. Some ghosts were worth keeping close. <words>357</words>
