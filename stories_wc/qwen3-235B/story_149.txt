<story>  
The unlikely prophet found the wilted paper flower tucked beneath a dryer in the laundromat’s shadows, its creases frayed but still holding the ghost of a rose’s shape. <words>17</words>  
They were conventionally rebellious—wearing secondhand coats in summer, quoting forgotten poets to cops—but this, this brittle thing, felt like a sign. <words>34</words>  
At 3 a.m., the laundromat hummed with fluorescent unease; the prophet traced the flower’s spine, wondering if its maker had known it would survive only as a relic. <words>52</words>  
A run-in had brought them here: a stranger’s sneer, a shatter of glass, a chase that dissolved into laughter and a map scribbled on a napkin. <words>70</words>  
The map led to the giant’s study, a vaulted chamber beneath a defunct subway station, where books towered like tombstones and the air tasted of ink and iron. <words>92</words>  
The giant, skeletal and draped in moth-eaten velvet, studied the prophet. “You seek glimmering transitions,” he rasped, gesturing to a prism suspended above a desk. <words>114</words>  
Light fractured through the prism, spilling auroras onto walls, and in those colors, the prophet saw visions: minds adrift, unmoored, screaming in silence. <words>135</words>  
Their motivation crystallized—*unify them*, stitch the scattered into a tapestry of shared purpose—but the flower in their palm pulsed, warning of estrangement’s cost. <words>156</words>  
The giant handed them a vial of liquid starlight. “Pour this where the veil thins. The transitions will glimmer, but not all will follow.” <words>175</words>  
Back in the laundromat, the prophet uncorked the vial, letting it pool on the cracked floor. The glimmer rose like smoke, weaving into faces, voices, a chorus: *Look*. <words>196</words>  
Some wept, some fled, others snarled—estranged not from the world but from their own solitude. The prophet clutched the flower, now briefly blooming, radiant and wrong. <words>218</words>  
But unity, they realized, was a blade: for every mind drawn to the light, another recoiled, sharpening the divide they’d meant to mend. <words>238</words>  
The giant’s study faded behind them as they stumbled into dawn, the flower wilted anew, heavier now with the weight of what they’d wrought. <words>257</words>  
In the gaps between scenes—the breath before a scream, the pause in a siren’s wail—the prophet wondered if delight could haunt itself, a ghost of both hope and ruin. <words>279</words>  
They kept walking, the laundromat’s glow a fading smudge, the flower’s edges cutting their palm like a confession. <words>294</words>  
Glimmering transitions demanded a price, and the prophet had paid it, stitching their own heart into the rift between what was and what might be. <words>314</words>  
The city stretched ahead, fractured and flickering, and somewhere, a mind turned toward the light, while another turned away, forever. <words>333</words>  
They smiled, aching, as the flower dissolved to ash. <words>343</words>
