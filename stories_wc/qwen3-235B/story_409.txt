The bruised fighter stumbled into the dusty attic, each step stirring motes of time into the air, his split lip trembling as he recalled the taunts of the crowd: *“Skillfully incompetent”*—a champion reduced to a joke. <words>27</words>  
At the attic’s heart, amid rusted clockwork animals frozen mid-gallop or mid-chirp, a shard of clay pot glinted in the gloom, its inscription etched in a tongue that hummed like a half-remembered lullaby. <words>53</words>  
He knelt, wincing as his bruised ribs protested, and traced the words: *“To stand is to exist; to fall is to vanish.”* <words>70</words>  
The moment his chapped fingers brushed the shard, the world dissolved—abducted not by hands but by forgotten dreams, pulled into a vortex of whirring gears and shadow. <words>93</words>  
He landed in a cavern of mirrors, each reflecting versions of himself: a boy clutching a sculptor’s chisel, a man fleeing a lover’s grave, a fighter refusing to quit. <words>117</words>  
A clockwork lion roared to life, its gears grinding, and the inscription’s meaning crystallized—he’d spent years hiding in the lie of his own weakness, letting the world define him. <words>144</words>  
The lion lunged; he sidestepped, not with grace but a clumsy desperation that mirrored his fights, a skill honed by embracing failure until it became armor. <words>169</words>  
In the dream’s logic, his incompetence was a key: he shattered mirrors by *not* fighting, letting the shards pierce his illusions until only the sculptor’s first strike on marble remained—a moment of creation, of choice. <words>202</words>  
He awoke in the attic, the shard embedded in his palm, the clockwork animals stilled forever, and understood: to stand for something was not to conquer, but to refuse extinction. <words>234</words>  
The fighter left the attic, the inscription now a vow, his bruises no longer badges of shame but maps of a self no longer deceived. <words>257</words>  
Years later, they’d say he’d vanished, but those who listened closely swore they heard a lion’s roar in the static between dreams, and a shard’s whisper: *“I exist.”* <words>287</words>  
The sculptor’s chisel, long silent, echoed in the space where marble once met resolve, and the fighter’s final match was remembered not for its blows, but for the moment he stood—unbroken, unhidden, unsparing. <words>323</words>  
In the end, the clay pot’s truth was his epitaph: to fall was to vanish, but to stand, even in ruin, was to burn so fiercely the stars leaned down to watch. <words>353</words>  
The attic’s dust settled again, but the clockwork animals faced the door, as if waiting for the day forgotten dreams would return to carve a new story from the silence. <words>383</words>
