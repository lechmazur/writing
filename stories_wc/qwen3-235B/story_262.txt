The alien liaison, Ms. Veyra, scrubbed chalk dust from the blackboard with a sponge that smelled of ozone and longing, her true form hidden beneath a human teacher’s guise. <words>22</words>  
She had chosen the abandoned Roman bathhouse—now a concert hall—for its acoustics, where the reverberation of the lonely church organ could crack time itself. <words>44</words>  
Each night, during the concerts, she compared the organ’s frequencies to the hum of the single puzzle tile she’d concealed in her desk—a fragment of an archive vault buried beneath the bathhouse’s marble ruins. <words>73</words>  
The tile was a map, a memory, a wound: its grooves held the last song of her species, silenced by their own fear of entropy. <words>97</words>  
To rescue lost knowledge, she’d become righteously flawed—a liar among humans, stealing moments between their symphonies to align the tile with the organ’s mournful cry. <words>124</words>  
The bathhouse groaned as if alive, its reborn walls trembling when the organist played a minor chord that mirrored the tile’s resonance. <words>148</words>  
Ms. Veyra’s hands shook; her tenderness for these humans clashed with the fury of her mission—*they feared what they could not hear*. <words>172</words>  
During intermission, she pressed the tile to the organ’s pipes, the vibration singing a language of collapse: *fear is a cage; break it*. <words>198</words>  
A student found her, wide-eyed, as the bathhouse’s mosaic floor began to shift, revealing a chamber of crystalline data-cores glowing like drowned stars. <words>225</words>  
“You’re not human,” the girl whispered, not unkindly, as the organ swelled into a crescendo that shattered the vault’s seal. <words>249</words>  
“No,” Ms. Veyra admitted, fierce and soft, “but neither are you, anymore.” The girl’s fingertips brushed the tile, and her fear dissolved into understanding. <words>277</words>  
Together, they decoded the archive—a symphony of extinct voices, saved by the very species that had once erased itself. <words>300</words>  
When the final note faded, the bathhouse stood renewed, its walls etched with both human and alien glyphs, a monument to what terror could no longer bind. <words>329</words>  
Ms. Veyra remained, a teacher still, though her lessons now included the weight of stars and the courage to listen. <words>353</words>  
The tile, whole at last, pulsed in her palm—a heart without a body, beating in time with the organ’s echo. <words>378</words>  
She had broken free from fear, not by silencing it, but by comparing its volume to the music it had tried to drown. <words>403</words>  
The concerts continued, each one a pact: knowledge survives when even the loneliest notes find a hand to hold them. <words>428</words>
