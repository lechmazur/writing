<story>  
The sneering envoy adjusted his frayed cloak, stepping into the domed vineyard where brittle vines clawed at the glass above a barren alien plain, their tendrils skeletal against the crimson horizon. <words>17</words>  
He had followed the paper trails—scraps of coded manifests, smudged ledgers, and airmail creases—across three dead systems, each clue a ghost of bureaucracy haunting the void. <words>35</words>  
Now, in this greenhouse of forgotten green, he sifted through swirling leaves, their dance furiously tranquil, as if the air itself were holding its breath. <words>51</words>  
His gloved hands tore at the foliage, not seeking flora but the folded note rumored to bloom where neglect met design, its ink a map to cup starlight in mortal palms. <words>71</words>  
The note, when found, was thinner than a photon’s sigh, its edges singed with the ash of expired stars; it smelled of ozone and the smugness of solved riddles. <words>90</words>  
He sneered at its audacity—a child’s cipher, yet here, in this hush of a possibility just born, it thrummed with the weight of collapsing suns. <words>109</words>  
The vineyard’s curator had once called this place a cradle, a nexus where entropy forgot to die; the envoy, a pragmatist, called it a tomb with pretensions. <words>129</words>  
But the note’s coordinates hummed, aligning with the dome’s fractured astrolabe, and he wondered if desperation warranted reverence, or if reverence was just another trap. <words>149</words>  
Outside, the plain yawned, a void gnawing at the glass; inside, the leaves swirled faster, a storm of whispers stitching the note’s commands to his trembling hands. <words>168</words>  
“To distill infinity,” he muttered, tracing the glyphs, “one must first kneel.” The vineyard’s irony was suffocating—beauty as a stepping stone, not a destination. <words>187</words>  
He knelt, the greenhouse trembling as starlight seeped through the dome’s cracks, pooling in his palms like liquid myth, a weightless fire that hummed of first causes. <words>207</words>  
The paper trails had led not to answers, but to this aperture—a moment where destiny, rambling and unrepentant, pressed its thumbprint on his pulse. <words>225</words>  
Behind him, the vines shuddered, their roots drinking the light he cupped; the barren plain beyond the glass seemed to lean closer, eavesdropping. <words>243</words>  
He laughed, sharp and brief—the universe’s joke was always the same, its punchline a mirror. To hold starlight was to hold a shadow’s shadow. <words>262</words>  
Yet the note burned away, its ashes seeding his palm, and he understood: the trail had never been about the end, but the sifting, the surrender to motion. <words>282</words>  
The dome groaned; the vineyard’s heart stuttered to life, roots splitting stone as the possibility just born stretched its limbs. <words>299</words>  
He remained, envoy no longer, but aperture—a conduit for light that had forgotten its source, its name, its need to be owned. <words>317</words>  
The leaves swirled on, indifferent, as the barren plain outside bloomed its first hesitant green. <words>332</words>
