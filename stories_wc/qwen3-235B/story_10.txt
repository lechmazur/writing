The cheerless duelist stood in the abandoned spaceport customs office, their boots crunching on glass shards beneath the hum of ancient server rooms. <words>17</words>  
The air smelled of ozone and mildew, a relic of civilizations that had fled or faded, leaving behind walls etched with graffiti and regret. <words>34</words>  
They had come seeking the maggoty wooden chest that rattled—a relic whispered about in back-alley cantinas, said to hold secrets that could elasticize a duelist’s edge. <words>53</words>  
Their gloved hands pried it open, revealing scrolls stained with time and a pungent, writhing paste that pulsed like it resented the dark. <words>69</words>  
The chest’s contents were family recipes, mutated by the void: instructions for soups that healed scars, broths that corroded steel, and incantations scribbled in a mother’s trembling hand. <words>90</words>  
The duelist’s fatal flaw had always been precision—an obsession with control, with winning—but the recipes demanded improvisation, a surrender to chaos. <words>112</words>  
They brewed a serum from moth-wing starch and ionized salt, watching it stretch into a gelatinous thread that hummed with the server rooms’ frequency. <words>133</words>  
As the concoction seeped into their skin, their vision elasticized: the room warped into a memory—a duel lost, a brother’s face crumbling to ash, a refusal to forgive. <words>155</words>  
The mutations taught them: forgiveness was not absolution but a recalibration, a way to bend without breaking, like the recipes that twisted ingredients into something new. <words>178</words>  
They drank another elixir, this one distilling the chest’s rot into clarity, and saw their brother’s ghost in the flicker of a dead monitor. <words>197</words>  
“I blamed you,” the duelist whispered, their voice cracking like the floorboards, “but I was the brittle one.” <words>213</words>  
The chest shuddered, its wood knitting into polished obsidian as the final recipe surfaced: *To mend a fracture, become the bridge.* <words>230</words>  
They mixed starlight scrap and server-core embers, crafting a blade that shimmered with elasticity, its edge forgiving rather than ruthless. <words>248</words>  
When the ghost lunged—a reflexive attack born of old pain—the duelist did not parry but caught the spectral steel in their bare hand, letting it slice through their palm. <words>270</words>  
Blood dripped onto the mutated paste, igniting a burst of light that fused the two halves of their fractured self. <words>286</words>  
The spaceport shuddered; the servers fell silent as the chest dissolved into ash, its purpose fulfilled. <words>301</words>  
Forgiveness, they realized, was the ultimate innovation—not erasing flaws but weaving them into something resilient enough to hold both guilt and grace. <words>323</words>  
They left the office, the hum of dormant machines a dirge and a lullaby, their footsteps lighter, their shadow no longer a blade but a bridge. <words>345</words>  
The recipes had elasticized their soul, stretching its rigid walls until there was room for mercy. <words>361</words>  
In the distance, a starship’s engine roared—a sound of departures—and the duelist walked toward it, their heart a rattling chest now open to the air. <words>383</words>
