<story>  
The ghostly caretaker of the frozen orchard, a wisp of frost and geothermal mist, floated solemnly silly between apple trees whose roots drank greedily from subterranean warmth, their branches clawing at the starless sky like frozen questions. <words>23</words>  
After the last wish was granted—a child’s plea for endless winter that the caretaker had fulfilled by diverting a geothermal stream to keep the orchard half-alive—they resolved to unravel the forbidden expedition logs hidden beneath the oldest tree, their brittle pages whispering of fate’s fragile weave. <words>56</words>  
The caretaker’s motive was neither noble nor cruel; they simply longed to speak to the crows that pecked at ice-crusted fruit, their caws echoing the loneliness of a creature unbound by time. <words>74</words>  
Using a plastic straw salvaged from a forgotten picnic—a relic of mortal frivolity—they perforated the logs’ protective wax seal, each puncture humming with the risk of collapsing the delicate balance between worlds. <words>100</words>  
Steam hissed from the holes, curling into spectral glyphs that mapped a ritual: to weave fate’s threads, one must offer a voice to the voiceless, a task the caretaker embraced with a chuckle that sounded like wind through cracked bells. <words>127</words>  
They plucked a single straw-splintered page and pressed it to their lips, the ink bleeding into their translucent form as the orchard erupted in gentle chaos—roots groaned, steam cyclones spun, and the crows swarmed, their wings slicing the cold. <words>154</words>  
The caretaker’s attempt to recite the incantation faltered; the words emerged as a burble of nonsense and birdcalls, a solemnly silly symphony that made the geothermal streams erupt in geyser laughter. <words>180</words>  
Yet the animals understood. A fox emerged, its fur shimmering with frost, and nuzzled the caretaker’s spectral hand, its thoughts flooding their mind: *Why linger where warmth is pretend?* <words>205</words>  
The orchard shuddered; the last wish’s magic frayed as the caretaker realized their folly—the forbidden logs had not taught them to weave fate, but to unravel their own tether to this world. <words>232</words>  
With a sigh that melted a hundred icicles, they dropped the plastic straw, now a frail conduit of memories, and let the fox’s question guide them toward the geothermal glow below. <words>258</words>  
Above, the trees shed their ice like skin, blossoming in a sudden spring as the caretaker dissolved, their final act perforating the boundary between life and afterlife, leaving only a whisper: *Ask better questions.* <words>288</words>  
The crows carried the tale south, their caws weaving a new legend—one of a ghost who traded eternity for a conversation, and an orchard that remembers how to burn. <words>313</words>
