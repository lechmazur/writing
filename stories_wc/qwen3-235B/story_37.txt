The reformed con artist, Elara, sat in the uncertain silence of a doctor’s waiting room, her fingers drumming a restless rhythm on a crumpled sheet music she’d stolen from a rainforest shaman three years prior. <words>17</words>  
The paper smelled of damp earth and bergamot, its notes smudged by time and guilt—a melody she’d never learned to play, much less yodel, though she’d once bet a small fortune it could summon storms. <words>35</words>  
She’d taken the detour to avoid a construction zone on her way to a mark’s villa, only to find herself stranded in a canopy village where lies dissolved like sugar in rain. <words>52</words>  
The villagers, draped in vines and suspicion, had pressed the sheet into her hands, demanding she “awaken the flame,” a task their elders claimed required someone dishonest enough to survive the trial. <words>72</words>  
Elara, whose career had been built on dishonestly honest smiles, realized too late the sheet music was a map—not to treasure, but to a cavern where the village’s ancestral fire had smoldered for millennia. <words>94</words>  
She’d laughed then, a sharp, cracked sound that echoed off the trees, and said, “I con people, not volcanoes,” but the shaman’s glare had pinned her like a moth. <words>113</words>  
The melody, he insisted, was a key: yodel the notes at dawn, and the flame would roar back, guarding their future; fail, and the fire would die, leaving the rainforest rootless. <words>135</words>  
She’d scoffed, until the ground quivered beneath her, and the canopy dimmed as if the sky itself were holding its breath. <words>147</words>  
Now, in the sterile waiting room, she traced the sheet’s creases, recalling how she’d bungled the yodel—shrieking notes that cracked the cavern walls open, revealing not a flame, but a seedpod pulsing like a heart. <words>170</words>  
“The guardian isn’t the one who lights the fire,” the shaman had whispered later, as saplings erupted around them, “but the one who lets it burn through her.” <words>189</words>  
Elara had stayed in the village for months, planting trees with trembling hands, until the doctor’s letter arrived: her rare lung condition, a consequence of the cavern’s spores, was terminal. <words>209</words>  
Yet here she was, alive and itching to laugh at the irony—she’d conned death itself, though the sheet music’s final revelation lingered: the seedpod had rooted in her chest, its roots threading through her ribs. <words>231</words>  
When the nurse called her name, Elara stood, pocketing the sheet music. <words>240</words>  
Outside, the rainforest canopy shimmered in her periphery, a phantom village built on trust she’d once deemed impossible. <words>254</words>  
She would tell the doctor the truth: she wasn’t here to be cured, but to donate her lungs—still strong, still woven with green—to a child waiting in silence. <words>273</words>  
The flame, after all, needed new guardians. <words>280</words>
