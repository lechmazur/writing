<story>  
The dreamy poet, once formally rebellious in ink-stained waistcoats, now wandered the disused railway station where ivy choked the tracks like forgotten vows. <words>17</words>  
He had returned after decades, compelled by a letter sealed in black wax, its surface etched with cryptic shapes that seemed to shift when held to the light—a riddle he’d spent years unraveling. <words>35</words>  
At the platform’s edge stood a brass sundial, its gnomon bent but still casting a shadow that quivered like a held breath. <words>49</words>  
The poet knelt, aligning the sundial’s markings with the wax seal; the shapes mirrored constellations only visible before dawn, a language of rebellion he’d once whispered in verses. <words>67</words>  
When the last riddle clicked into place—its solution a word he’d carved into his first chapbook—the sundial groaned, and the earth shuddered. <words>82</words>  
A delicate undoing began: the ivy recoiled, revealing names etched into stone, each syllable a ghost’s sigh. <words>95</words>  
The letter dissolved in his hand, its wax bleeding into the sundial’s numerals, and the poet understood his motivation had never been curiosity—it was penance. <words>112</words>  
He had spent a lifetime standing by the unremembered, those erased by history’s tidy hands, and now the station answered. <words>126</words>  
Figures materialized where the tracks had been: travelers frozen mid-step, porters grinning through coal-smoke grime, a child waving a wilted flag. <words>142</words>  
The poet’s breath hitched; he recognized his own face among them, a younger self he’d disowned for its naivety. <words>155</words>  
The sundial’s shadow elongated, stitching time into a seamless loop, and he realized the cryptic shapes were not a code but an invitation—to bear witness, to unravel alongside the forgotten. <words>177</words>  
His formally rebellious heart, long dulled by the weight of exile, quickened as the apparitions pressed their palms to his cheeks, their voices a hymn of unfinished stories. <words>196</words>  
The undoing reached its zenith when the sundial cracked, spilling brass filings that glinted like stardust, and the poet whispered the names aloud, each syllable a spark. <words>214</words>  
The station exhaled—a sound like a train’s distant wail—and the figures dissolved into the ivy, leaving their names glowing faintly where roots had torn the stone. <words>231</words>  
He lingered until dusk, the quiet intensity of the moment etching itself into his ribs, knowing he’d never write of this. <words>246</words>  
Some truths were too delicate to survive ink. <words>253</words>  
The sundial remained, its fracture a testament to the undoing, and the poet left, his shadow merging with the first stars. <words>268</words>  
He walked away, not toward the road, but into the overgrowth, where the unremembered waited, patient as riddles. <words>283</words>
