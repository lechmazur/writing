Thane, a spirited lumberjack with a reputation for splitting both logs and tavern arguments, first found the coded letter tucked beneath a keg of blackberry mead in the ossuary’s bone cellar. <words>44</words> The restaurant—Carved Echoes, once a tomb for forgotten kings—hummed with the clatter of knives against stone plates, its walls lined with femurs polished to a sinister gleam. <words>76</words> He’d been hired to revamp the place’s “rustic ambiance,” though the owner, a widow with eyes like flint, had muttered about “unearthing history,” a phrase that now curdled in his gut. <words>110</words>  

The letter’s ink glowed faintly, symbols shifting like smoke whenever he tried to read them, a puzzle that seeped into his dreams. <words>137</words> Through reawakened nightmares, he saw cities burning, his own hands clutching an axe that wasn’t his, voices shouting of a war decades ahead. <words>164</words> By dawn, he’d memorized every cipher, his fingers twitching with the need to chop, to clear, to *understand*. <words>186</words>  

He took to biking the cliffside trails each dusk, the letter taped to his handlebars, its glow syncing with the rhythm of his wheels. <words>213</words> The route was a gauntlet of switchbacks and ghosts; locals said the ossuary’s dead whispered to those who pedaled fast enough to listen. <words>240</words> Thane, gracefully awkward in his patchwork leather jacket, drew stares when he stumbled into village apothecaries asking about healing traditions—arnica poultices, bone-setter hymns, the ache of forgiveness. <words>273</words>  

The widow followed him one night, her heels clicking like rifle fire against the cobblestones. <words>294</words> “You think decoding that scrap will absolve you?” she hissed, revealing a scarred palm identical to the mark on the letter—a warlord’s sigil, erased from history. <words>324</words> Her agenda crystallized: the ossuary was a vault for weapons forged from ancestral rage, and Thane’s nightmares were keys. <words>348</words>  

He confronted his visions head-on, biking into storms, letting the coded letters map a path to a buried crypt. <words>373</words> There, he found journals of a surgeon who’d healed both sides of a forgotten siege, her remedies scribbled beside confessions of guilt. <words>399</words> The truth gutted him: the war in his dreams was his own lineage’s legacy, a cycle of violence the widow meant to reignite. <words>426</words>  

On the solstice, Thane returned to Carved Echoes with a satchel of herbs and a throat full of hymns. <words>449</words> As the widow unsheathed a bone dagger to activate the ossuary’s weapons, he crushed the crypt’s vials beneath their feet—smoke erupted, not of war, but of lavender and marrow, a balm that seeped into the stones and stilled the restless dead. <words>487</words>  

The restaurant shuttered by morning, its hidden agenda dissolved. <words>501</words> Thane rides on, now teaching villagers to graft apple saplings onto broken sword blades, his hands still calloused but gentler, the coded letter tucked into his jacket—a reminder that healing, like chopping wood, demands both force and the grace to know when to stop. <words>540</words>
