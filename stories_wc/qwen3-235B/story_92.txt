Felix adjusted his leather gloves, the kind favored by the ultra-rich for handling their prize-winning poodles, and stepped into the marble foyer of the Blackthorn Mansion as the sun bled crimson into the horizon. <words>22</words>  
The silent agreements he’d made with clients always involved discretion—never asking why the dachshund had a passport, never questioning the locked east wing—but tonight’s request felt different: *Walk the dogs before sundown, no matter what.* <words>51</words>  
The dining room, where he now stood, was a cathedral of decay, its chandelier flickering above a botanical collection gone feral—vines strangling silver candelabras, orchids blooming like open wounds. <words>75</words>  
Felix justified his unease by focusing on the dogs: a shivering Maltese, a stoic Great Dane, both staring at the far end of the room, where shadows pooled like spilt ink. <words>98</words>  
He’d met the mansion’s owner at a blood drive months prior, the woman’s veins mapping constellations under her skin as she whispered, *“Fear’s a bad tenant. Starve it.”* <words>121</words>  
Now, as color drained from the sky, he obeyed the silent pact, leading the dogs in a circle around the room, their paws crunching on shattered lilies that hissed and recoiled. <words>146</words>  
The air thickened, a loud silence pressing against his eardrums, but Felix moved carefully careless, whistling a nursery rhyme his grandmother had hummed before vanishing into her own shadows. <words>171</words>  
At the westernmost window, a spectral hound materialized, its eyes twin voids, yet Felix knelt, offering a treat from his pocket—the same vanilla biscuits the owner always provided. <words>197</words>  
The phantom sniffed, the room trembling as it chewed, and Felix understood: the botanical nightmare fed on fear, but the silent agreement demanded reciprocity—his calm for the dogs’ safety. <words>223</words>  
He’d justified this job as a means to an end, a way to afford his sister’s tuition, but here, where courage was currency, he realized he’d become the caretaker of something older, fiercer. <words>250</words>  
As twilight surrendered to night, the vines retreated, the chandelier steadied, and the spectral hound dissolved into a breeze that carried the scent of crushed violets—a sign the pact held. <words>277</words>  
Felix stood where fear dared not tread, not because he lacked it, but because he’d learned its price and chosen, carefully, carelessly, to overpay. <words>300</words>  
The dogs yawned, mundane again, and he leashed them, the mansion’s silence now a companion rather than a threat, its secrets coiled but sated, waiting for the next bleed of day into night. <words>327</words>  
He’d return tomorrow, and the cycle would renew—a dance of quiet defiance, where botanical nightmares slept and silent agreements breathed. <words>349</words>
