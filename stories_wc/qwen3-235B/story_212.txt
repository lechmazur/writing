<story>  
The apocalyptic farmer knelt in the cracked soil of the ethereal plains, his calloused hands sowing seeds that glowed faintly like dying stars, remnants of a world gutted by the last resource war. <words>22</words>  
He bred these seeds not for harvest but for memory, each one a rebellion against the faceless syndicates that had once dictated his every breath through rusted mandates and poisoned water. <words>44</words>  
At night, he listened to the song of boundaries—a haunting melody carried by the wind, older than the war, older than the land itself, whispering where life ended and oblivion began. <words>69</words>  
His only companion was a magician’s deck of trick cards, salvaged from a drowned city’s ruins; the cards jabbered in riddles when shuffled, their ink smudged with salt and prophecy. <words>93</words>  
He’d learned to read them by firelight, their atypical patterns mirroring the seeds’ strange growth cycles, as though both had escaped the same cage of logic. <words>117</words>  
One dusk, a bottle drifted inland from the sea that no longer existed, its glass etched with coordinates only the cards could decode, revealing a map to a subterranean aquifer. <words>143</words>  
The farmer dug where the song thrummed loudest, his shovel striking water that shimmered like liquid glass, and in its reflection, he saw the syndicate’s enforcers closing in. <words>169</words>  
He scattered the trick cards into the current, their jabber rising into a chorus that mimicked the song of boundaries, bending the air into illusions of endless salt flats. <words>194</words>  
The enforcers vanished, swallowed by mirages, while the farmer planted his final seed above the aquifer—a species that drank only moonlight and screamed when touched. <words>219</words>  
Years later, wanderers spoke of a forest growing where the plains had been, its trees bearing fruit that hummed the song of boundaries in voices like breaking ice. <words>245</words>  
The farmer, now root-fingered and smoke-eyed, left messages in bottles at the forest’s edge, each one a seed wrapped in a trick card, addressed to no one and everyone. <words>271</words>  
They washed up in distant wastelands, carried by tides that obeyed no map, their atypical shapes sparking hope in those still shackled by old wars’ ghosts. <words>297</words>  
He never saw the saplings that sprouted in foreign soils, their roots rewriting the song into a hymn of escape, but he felt them—a raw solace in the ache of his bones. <words>323</words>  
The syndicate’s last broadcast had called him a fool; the cards had called him chosen; the seeds, however, called him home, their tendrils weaving a world where no boundary was final. <words>350</words>  
When the sea returned as rain, it fell in rhythms the farmer recognized, a message in a bottle he’d waited lifetimes to open, and he smiled, sowing the storm’s breath into the soil. <words>378</words>  
The song of boundaries shifted, no longer a dirge but a lullaby, and the ethereal plains bloomed into a horizon that breathed, boundless and uncharted. <words>403</words>
