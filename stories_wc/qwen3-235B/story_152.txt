The frenzied juggler spun plates atop bamboo sticks, their cracked surfaces etched with maps of sunken cities, as the yawning void around him hummed with the static of forgotten languages. <words>22</words>  
He’d found the crumpled love letter in a driftwood chest weeks ago, ink blurred but still legible: *“Meet me where the bridges burn.”* <words>37</words>  
Now, at the final moment of an abandoned summer, he hurled the letter into the void, watching it dissolve into ash that spiraled like tea leaves in a storm. <words>53</words>  
His act was peculiarly functional—each object he kept airborne represented a salvaged library, their weight a calculus of memory and decay. <words>67</words>  
The void demanded balance: to isolate the libraries’ cores, he’d need to interpret the ash-tea’s swirl, a method blending Babylonian augury and Kyoto’s *tasseography*. <words>84</words>  
Cultural bridges, his mentor had whispered before vanishing, were not built—they were dredged, like books from black water. <words>97</words>  
The juggler’s hands shook; his left palm bore a scar from catching a blade meant to sever his tether to the living. <words>110</words>  
He’d once been a scholar, until the floods came and the councils voted to let the libraries drown, calling them relics of a divided world. <words>126</words>  
But the letter’s author had believed otherwise—*“The bridges burn, but their stones endure.”* <words>137</words>  
He brewed the ash-tea now, its vapor coalescing into glyphs that flickered between Devanagari and Norse runes. <words>150</words>  
The void shuddered; a library’s spine breached the abyss, dripping ink like blood. <words>161</words>  
He caught its keystone, juggling it with the others, and felt the weight shift—a new bridge forming, fragile as a moth’s wing. <words>177</words>  
The tea leaves thickened, spelling a name he’d almost forgotten: *Amaris*, the letter-writer, who’d drowned reaching for a codex of dual tongues. <words>194</words>  
Her voice seemed to rise from the void, urging him to isolate the library’s heart before the summer’s end, when the bridges would burn again. <words>211</words>  
He hurled his knife, not to sever, but to pierce the keystone, releasing a pulse that stilled the void’s hunger. <words>227</words>  
Books erupted around him, pages fanning into arches that glowed with muted euphoria—the light of knowledge half-remembered, half-invented. <words>244</words>  
The juggler collapsed, the crumpled letter reappearing in his fist, now dry and crisp, its final line rewritten: *“We meet where the bridges begin.”* <words>262</words>  
Above, the libraries hovered, stitched by threads of ash and tea, while the void, sated, exhaled a breath that carried the scent of ink and salt. <words>280</words>  
He stood, juggling anew—not to preserve the past, but to spin its fragments into a bridge the future might cross without burning. <words>297</words>  
The summer died behind him, a husk eclipsed by the peculiar, functional rhythm of his hands. <words>310</words>
