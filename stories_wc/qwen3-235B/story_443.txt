<story>  
The heartbroken reaper wandered the desolate cliffs, his cloak frayed as the wings of the migrating birds that scattered seeds in his path. <words>17</words>  
He had not harvested a soul in weeks, his scythe dull with disuse, his grief a softly thunderous pulse beneath his ribs. <words>34</words>  
A sparrow, its feathers streaked with twilight, dropped a seed that glinted like a star; he pocketed it, the gesture automatic, hollow. <words>52</words>  
When the bird vanished into a fog-wrapped valley, he ventured after it, the seeds blooming into a trail only he could see. <words>69</words>  
They led him to a cave whose mouth yawned like an unspoken secret, its walls lined with petrified roots that hummed with forgotten names. <words>88</words>  
Inside, the forgotten library waited: shelves carved into stone, dust motes swirling like trapped constellations, and at its heart, a desk strewn with yellowed pages—the first draft of a world-famous novel, its ink still wet. <words>123</words>  
The title was scratched out, but the reaper recognized the story—a tale of two lovers who mapped hidden springs together, their bond fracturing as the waters dried. <words>144</words>  
He read, the words threading into his wounds, their evolving relationship mirroring his own past: a woman with hair like wildfire, a quarrel over a locket, her laughter silenced by his own withdrawal. <words>172</words>  
The cave seemed to breathe around him, the library’s books rustling as if stirred by a wind that smelled of rain and beginnings. <words>190</words>  
He traced a map tucked into the novel’s margins, its ink swirling into the shapes of springs buried beneath the earth, their locations marked by the same seeds the sparrow had scattered. <words>217</words>  
A purpose flickered in him—soft, fearful—as he pocketed the map, the motivation not to heal but to *understand*, to chart the scars that shaped him. <words>242</words>  
When he turned, the sparrow perched on a shelf, its eyes twin embers; it dropped another seed, this one rooting into a sapling that bloomed with white flowers. <words>266</words>  
The reaper knelt, planting the seed beside the sapling, his hands trembling with the joy of creation, the terror of hoping again. <words>287</words>  
He ventured deeper, the softly thunderous sound of his heartbeat syncing with the drip of hidden springs, the novel draft glowing faintly in his satchel. <words>310</words>  
In the cave’s core, he found a spring untouched by time, its waters reflecting not his face but the woman he’d loved, her image smiling through his guilt. <words>335</words>  
He mapped it, the ink from the novel bleeding onto his parchment, merging her name with his own in a script that pulsed like a living thing. <words>361</words>  
As he surfaced, dawn cracked the sky, the sparrow singing a hymn of unspoken endings and unformed beginnings, its migration a promise he finally understood. <words>389</words>  
The reaper walked home, the library’s whispers clinging to him, his grief still present but softened by the weight of the sapling’s roots growing in his chest. <words>416</words>  
He would return to the springs, to the novel’s unfinished pages, to the fear and joy of becoming—not healed, but healing, the seeds of himself scattering where the wind chose. <words>447</words>
