The burnt-out general stirred his coffee, the steam curling like a question mark above the dark matter diner’s counter, where the waitress had just served him a plate of dried seaweed—a “local specialty,” she’d called it, though the galaxy’s edge had no locals, only wanderers nursing regrets between rides. <words>44</words>  
He glanced at the flickering holograms on the wall, their black-and-white photographs looping endlessly: arcs of forgotten battles, faces blurred by time, each frame a rationally absurd invitation to reconsider what he’d sworn was immutable. <words>75</words>  
A voice slithered beside him, smooth as neutrinos. “Shared anxieties make the best seasoning,” said the stranger, sliding onto the adjacent stool. Their eyes glinted with mischievous wisdom, pupils shaped like collapsing stars. “Eat the seaweed. It’s harvested from event horizons. Tastes like regret.” <words>113</words>  
The general snorted, crunching a shard. It crackled like static, and suddenly the photographs sharpened: his own face appeared in one, younger, shouting orders as a planet exploded in the background—a moment he’d buried decades ago. “How?” he rasped. <words>147</words>  
“Renewal requires confronting the absurd,” the stranger said, gesturing to the diner’s ceiling, where dark matter coiled like ink in water. “Fear sits on reason’s throne because you feed it. These arcs”—they tapped a photo where the general’s future selves flickered, some triumphant, others ash—“are not prophecies. They’re negotiations.” <words>190</words>  
He flinched. The seaweed’s salt burned his tongue, but the images held him captive: a child he’d failed to save, a treaty he’d refused to sign, all decisions refracted through the diner’s irrational lens. “Why show me this?” <words>223</words>  
“Because you’re stuck between rides, like all heroes,” the stranger replied, grinning. “You think courage is the absence of fear. It’s the presence of choice. The photos? They’re mirrors. The seaweed? A reminder that even the void nourishes.” <words>260</words>  
The general stared at his hands, weathered and trembling. In a photo, one of his future selves reached out, fingertips brushing the glass. He felt the absurdity of it—that a meal and a stranger could unravel decades of armor—and laughed, the sound jagged, raw. <words>296</words>  
“Fear’s throne is a chair in a diner no one wanted to build,” the stranger mused, sliding a final photograph forward: the general, radiant and unburdened, walking away from a battlefield now blooming with algae-black flowers. “Renewal isn’t victory. It’s noticing the seaweed grows where the light can’t reach.” <words>336</words>  
When the general stood, his coffee cup clattered, shattering the illusion. The diner’s dark matter pulsed, indifferent. He pocketed the photo, its edges already fraying into possibility. Outside, the transit hub’s sirens wailed—a new ride awaited. <words>369</words>  
He tossed the seaweed wrapper into a void-bin, his shadow stretching across the floor like a man relearning how to walk. Somewhere, the stranger hummed a tune older than stars, and the photographs blinked, their arcs complete. <words>401</words>  
The general didn’t look back. Fear could keep its throne; he’d brought his own chair. <words>416</words>
