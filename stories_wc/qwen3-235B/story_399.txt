<story>  
The grumpy crypt caretaker, Thaddeus, had spent decades shoveling moonlit dirt and muttering at the restless dead, his spine as crooked as the tombstones he tended. <words>17</words>  
One dusk, he found an unmarked cardboard tube leaning against the ossuary door, its hollow eyes of corrugated paper mocking his routine. <words>32</words>  
He prodded it with his spade; it jiggled faintly, as if something inside resented confinement. <words>45</words>  
The tube’s multiply singular presence—a single object radiating disquiet—gnawed at him, dredging memories he’d buried deeper than the paupers he’d once been ordered to forget. <words>65</words>  
By midnight, he’d trudged to the witch’s crystal scrying room atop the hill, its stained-glass windows fracturing starlight into prismatic ghosts. <words>83</words>  
He’d never admitted needing answers, but the uprising within—whispers of trauma clawing at his ribs—left him no choice. <words>99</words>  
Inside, he slit the tube open, and a cascade of colored sand spilled onto the obsidian floor, arranging itself into a mandala through no hand but the universe’s. <words>120</words>  
The patterns shifted as he breathed, each geometric ripple mirroring constellations wheeling above, their light threading through quartz and memory alike. <words>138</words>  
Thaddeus knelt, calloused fingers hovering over the sand; the mandala jiggled, grains leaping to form a face he’d once loved, now dust. <words>156</words>  
He recoiled, but the witch’s crystals hummed, anchoring him as the mandala dissolved and reformed—a thousand tiny fractures healing into a spiral. <words>174</words>  
Trauma, he realized, was not a tomb but a mosaic, its edges sharp until seen whole. <words>187</words>  
Through stargazing hours, the mandala guided him: a map of wounds and wonder, each grain a star, each void between a breath. <words>204</words>  
When dawn bled through the windows, the sand lay inert, the tube crumpled, and Thaddeus stood—shoulders less a cage, more a compass. <words>221</words>  
He buried the mandala in the crypt’s deepest vault, not to forget, but to let it multiply singular truths into the soil that fed his unrest. <words>241</words>  
The dead quieted that night, sensing the caretaker’s new rhythm: a jiggle in his step, subtle as a star’s wink, vast as the sky’s slow ache. <words>260</words>  
He never thanked the witch, but left a single sand-grain on her doorstep—a diamond in the rough, proof that even the buried could gleam. <words>278</words>  
And when stargazers later asked why the crypt’s lanterns flickered in fractal patterns, Thaddeus simply smiled, tending his trauma like a garden only he could see. <words>300</words>  
The uprising had quieted, not because the past was pardoned, but because he’d held its face in the palm of a universe that listened. <words>319</words>  
The mandala’s lesson lingered: to quell an uprising, one must first let it speak in the language of scars—and listen as they realign. <words>339</words>  
Years later, when the witch’s scrying room crumbled to dust, the sand mandala’s pattern endured in the caretaker’s bones, a celestial cartography of survival. <words>359</words>  
And if you visit the crypt at dawn, you might glimpse him—jiggling a new cardboard tube, its grains singing secrets only the stars and the scarred understand. <words>379</words>  
For trauma, he knew, was never a single grave, but a constellation waiting to be named. <words>394</words>
