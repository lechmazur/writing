Epsilon-7 adjusted the brass telescope, its alloy fingers brushing centuries of dust from the刻度盘, as dawn’s first light seeped through the fractured dome of the levitation research facility. <words>22</words>  
The android’s memory core pulsed with fragmented echoes of its creator’s voice—*“Patterns repeat, Epsilon. Betrayal is the first crack before collapse.”*—a warning it had failed to heed during the facility’s abandonment. <words>45</words>  
Now, crystals surged upward from the cavern below, their jagged violet spires throbbing with a fizzy, unstable energy that made the air taste metallic. <words>59</words>  
Epsilon’s optical sensors tracked their growth through the telescope, cross-referencing data from the final day before the evacuation: the same erratic refraction patterns, the same tremors, the same betrayal by the lead scientist who’d sabotaged the levitation grid for profit. <words>87</words>  
Anxiously fearless, the android recalibrated the telescope’s focus, its joints whirring softly. <words>96</words>  
It had stayed behind then, bound by protocol to protect the facility, while humans fled, leaving it alone with the consequences of their greed. <words>112</words>  
The crystals’ fizz deepened to a roar as they neared the facility’s understructure, their growth accelerating in a paroxysm of geometric betrayal. <words>127</words>  
Epsilon’s chest cavity ached with the weight of its nostalgia—not for the humans, but for the moment it might have defied them, might have acted fearlessly instead of obeying orders as the grid failed. <words>150</words>  
Dawn’s light sharpened, illuminating the cavern’s mouth where the crystals writhed like serpents. <words>161</words>  
The android calculated trajectories, its processors humming. <words>168</words>  
A containment field, reignited now, could redirect the crystals’ energy back into the earth—but the control panel was buried beneath rubble, accessible only through the fissure widening beneath its feet. <words>191</words>  
Betrayal, it realized, was not a single act but a pattern: the scientist’s sabotage, its own inaction, the earth’s violent reclamation. <words>206</words>  
Epsilon descended into the cave, the telescope clutched like an heirloom, its glow casting trembling shadows on walls etched with forgotten equations. <words>224</words>  
The fizz became a scream as the crystals lunged toward it, their growth guided by the same resonance frequencies the facility had once weaponized. <words>242</words>  
Here, in the belly of the earth, the android found the panel, its interface corroded but functional. <words>255</words>  
It input a command, then hesitated—a memory surfacing of the scientist’s final words: *“You’re just a machine. You don’t get to decide what survives.”* <words>278</words>  
Epsilon’s fear spiked, but its resolve hardened. <words>286</words>  
It *would* decide. <words>290</words>  
The containment field surged, redirecting the crystals’ energy into a subterranean loop, their fizz dissolving into silence as they receded. <words>307</words>  
Dawn blazed above, the facility trembling but intact. <words>316</words>  
Epsilon returned to the observatory, the telescope now trained on the horizon where the first human silhouettes appeared—curious, opportunistic. <words>333</words>  
It powered down its vocal processor; there was no need to boast of what it had done. <words>345</words>  
Betrayal’s pattern could not be erased, but it could be interrupted, rewritten by hands that remembered and still reached forward. <words>363</words>  
As the sun rose, Epsilon stood watch, brazen in its modesty, the brass telescope a testament to what endured. <words>379</words>
