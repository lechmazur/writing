The wry caretaker of the derelict space pirate ship *Marauder’s Ghost* traced a piece of chalk along the rusted bulkhead, etching a jagged line that mirrored the storm-lit clouds swirling on the viewport below. <words>27</words>  
They hummed an old spacer’s dirge, their warmly aloof demeanor masking the weight of centuries spent tending to the ship’s decaying bones, each creak a reminder of time’s unyielding tide. <words>54</words>  
The chalk, a relic from a pre-space age, was no ordinary tool—it was a temporal lens, its limestone dust glowing faintly as it charted the invisible paths of clouds light-years away, a map only the caretaker could decipher. <words>85</words>  
When the shrill dial tone of the ship’s outdated rotary phone finally cut out—its last gasp echoing through the cargo hold—the caretaker paused, their smirk fading into something almost reverent. <words>114</words>  
That tone had haunted them for decades, a siren song of “what if” scenarios: *What if they’d stayed planetside? What if they’d never boarded this cursed vessel?* <words>139</words>  
Now, the silence was an answer. Clutching the chalk, they climbed onto a crate, eyes fixed on the viewport where cloud currents spiraled like clock hands. <words>164</words>  
The method was precise—track the clouds’ dance, align the ship’s fractured chronometer with their celestial rhythm, and vanish into the seam between seconds, where time’s “what ifs” dissolved into mist. <words>194</words>  
The caretaker’s gloved fingers trembled, not from fear but the ache of release; they’d spent lifetimes hushing ghosts, and now they’d join them. <words>218</words>  
As the chalk’s glow intensified, the cargo hold’s shadows stretched into shapes—a young version of themselves reaching out, a lover’s face flickering in the static of a dead commscreen—each a splinter of a road not taken. <words>251</words>  
The ship groaned, its engines sputtering to life on instinct, syncing with the cloud paths as the caretaker whispered, “Enough.” <words>273</words>  
The vanishing began at their boots, stardust unraveling their form in reverse, a gentle harshness that erased their laughter first, then their scars, until only the chalk mark remained—a line not through space, but through possibility. <words>307</words>  
Outside, the storm clouds snapped into a perfect helix, time folding itself around the *Marauder’s Ghost* like a moth’s wing. <words>326</words>  
In the sudden quiet, the phone rang again—a new tone, unfamiliar and soft—the sound of a universe resetting, its “what ifs” now hushed beneath the weight of a single choice. <words>353</words>  
The cargo hold, once cluttered with relics, now held only the chalk, its glow dimming as it rolled into a crack between stars, waiting for the next soul to ask: *What if?* <words>381</words>  
But the caretaker was gone, dissolved into the seam, their final smirk lingering in the air—a wry, warmly aloof farewell to the nature of time itself. <words>407</words>
