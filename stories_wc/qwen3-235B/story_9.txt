The neon-lit desert hissed with static, its labyrinth of corroded billboards flashing promises of water long evaporated, as the mildly panicked soothsayer—call him Jex—clutched his pocket puzzle box, its thirteen locks biting into his palm like unpaid debts. <words>44</words>  
He’d stolen it from a corpse in the Salt Flats, a “lucky charm” the dead man had claimed, though Jex doubted luck existed in a world where rainbows were UV glare off toxic puddles. <words>76</words>  
“Environmental stewardship,” he muttered, the core concept dripping with molten sarcasm as he kicked aside a rusted sign advertising “Eco-Friendly Dystopia Tours.” <words>103</words>  
The box’s solution, he’d been told, required reading the water rings on a battered wooden bar top—a task that sounded like a drunkard’s philosophy, not salvation. <words>131</words>  
Yet here he was, ducking into a saloon that reeked of synthetic bourbon and desperation, its bar warped by decades of spilled regrets. <words>156</words>  
He slammed a cracked vial of murky liquid—his last sample of pre-collapse aquifer—onto the wood grain, watching its rings pulse like faint heartbeats. <words>185</words>  
“Magnify,” he hissed, jabbing a dagger at the box’s first lock, its gears grinding as if laughing at his optimism. <words>208</words>  
Each click of the puzzle revealed a memory: a child swimming in a river that now choked on plastic, a forest reduced to matchsticks for neon billboards. <words>237</words>  
The bartender eyed him, a cyborg with one glass eye spinning like a slot machine. “You’re probably unlikely to fix anything, y’know.” <words>263</words>  
Jex snorted. “Destiny’s a DIY project, friend. Saw it in the rings.” He twisted the seventh lock, the box humming a dirge that harmonized with the desert wind. <words>292</words>  
By the thirteenth click, the vial glowed, its water thickening into liquid amber, the scent of petrichor flooding the room. <words>317</words>  
The bartender recoiled. “That’s illegal. The Cartels own rain now.” <words>334</words>  
“Funny,” Jex spat, pocketing the vial, “thought destiny didn’t need permits.” Outside, he hurled the puzzle box into the sand—it dissolved, its job done. <words>363</words>  
He sprinted toward the dead riverbed, the vial’s light seeping into his gloves, his bare hands already shaping the soil into channels, as if the box had taught him to sculpt hope. <words>392</words>  
The neon flickered overhead, mocking, but the ground drank deep, a single blade of grass cracking through asphalt like a middle finger. <words>418</words>  
Jex laughed, raw and surprised, as the first thunderclap in thirty years split the sky—a soundtracked encore to his probably unlikely miracle. <words>445</words>  
The soothsayer’s panic ebbed, replaced by a smirk. Turns out stewardship wasn’t about saving the world. It was about pissing on its grave until it fought back. <words>473</words>  
He lit a cigarette with a billboard’s spark, the maze around him humming with new static—not static, but the hum of roots spreading, thirsty and unapologetic. <words>501</words>  
The lost years? They’d been here all along, waiting for someone to read between the rings and realize destiny wasn’t a map—it was a punch list. <words>529</words>
