The humorless comedic actor knelt in the cracked sandbox of a deserted playground, the inkwell clutched in his fist like a relic of some forgotten ritual. <words>17</words> Its dried-out husk mirrored his throat—raw, voiceless, a vessel drained of punchlines. <words>24</words> The wind carried whispers of the wilderness beyond the rusted swings, a hush that felt less like silence and more like time itself unraveling, thread by thread. <words>40</words>  

He’d always hated birthdays. <words>44</words> Yet here they were: unwanted gifts, wrapped in crumpled newspaper and twine, piled atop the splintered picnic bench where he’d once performed monologues to an audience of crows. <words>63</words> A jar of pickled herring (he’d never liked fish). A moth-eaten scarf (he’d outgrown wool). A screenplay titled *The Last Laugh* (he’d burned it page by page). <words>89</words> Each a token of someone’s misplaced nostalgia, each a taunt. <words>96</words>  

Through persistent daydream loops, he relived the moment his career curdled: the spotlight dimming mid-punchline, the audience’s chuckles clotting into pity. <words>117</words> He’d tried to concede then, to bow out gracefully, but the world kept handing him props—inkwells, microphones, scripts—as if comedy were a habit one couldn’t quit. <words>140</words>  

The star’s dying breath, they said, could be bottled if you stood at the edge of wilderness long enough, listening. <words>155</words> He scoffed. <words>158</words> What use was a dying star’s sigh to a man whose jokes had fossilized? <words>167</words> Yet he lingered, tracing constellations in the dust, waiting for a punchline the universe refused to deliver. <words>182</words>  

A crow alighted on the picnic bench, cocking its head at the gifts. <words>190</words> “Objectively personal,” he muttered, parsing the phrase like a critic dissecting a joke. <words>201</words> The gifts were meant to *mean*, but meaning had always eluded him. <words>211</words> He’d built a career on absurdity, yet here, in the playground’s skeletal remains, absurdity felt hollow. <words>227</words>  

The daydream loop tightened: a standing ovation, a curtain call, a standing ovation, a curtain call. <words>239</words> He’d concede nothing, he’d concede everything. <words>247</words> The inkwell slipped from his grip, shattering against the ground. <words>255</words> A crow cawed—a sound like laughter, or its ghost. <words>262</words>  

He bent to gather the shards, and there, in the grit, a glimmer: a droplet of ink, stubborn, pooling like a star’s last tear. <words>277</words> The wilderness hummed. <words>281</words> He held the droplet to the sky, and for the first time in years, he smiled—not a joke, but a surrender. <words>296</words>  

The crows erupted into applause. <words>300</words> The inkwell, empty yet full, pressed against his chest. <words>306</words> The dying star’s breath curled in his lungs, and the playground, at last, felt like a beginning. <words>320</words>  

He’d never tell them about the gift they’d given him—the one they’d never meant to give. <words>331</words>
