<story>  
The quiet deserter knelt in the greenhouse’s damp soil, fingers tracing the cracked mirror’s jagged edge as if it might slice through the silence of his guilt. <words>17</words>  
Around him, the plant communication study hummed—a labyrinth of sensors and vines that whispered in frequencies only the patient could decipher. <words>34</words>  
He’d fled the war with nothing but this mirror, a relic of a life he’d shattered, and the desperate hope that roots and leaves might absolve him. <words>51</words>  
The mirror showed not his face but fragments: a bloodied battlefield, a child’s hand slipping from his grasp, a vow to never return. <words>68</words>  
Dizzyingly grounded in the earth’s rhythm, he began carbonizing the dead leaves, pressing them into the porcelain shards to preserve what stories they might hold. <words>86</words>  
The masks—once ceremonial, now shattered—lay scattered like jigsaw puzzles across decades, each piece a cipher to a civilization that had revered stillness. <words>104</words>  
He reconstructed them not to resurrect the past, but to break its cycle, believing that even broken things could learn to belong. <words>121</words>  
Nights were spent piecing together puzzles whose images dissolved when stared at too long: a soldier’s helmet overgrown with moss, a mirror reflecting no one. <words>140</words>  
The plants responded to his touch, their tendrils curling toward the carbonized leaves as if recognizing kinship in their preserved grief. <words>157</words>  
He whispered to them the stories he’d forged from porcelain—of a deserter who became a gardener, a warrior who planted seeds where he’d once sown bombs. <words>175</words>  
The greenhouse grew dense with a noble foolishness: the delusion that redemption could bloom from ash, that he might dissolve into the ecosystem like compost. <words>194</words>  
When the researchers found him, they saw only a man communing with flora, unaware he’d carbonized his own name into the masks’ final mosaic. <words>212</words>  
The mirror, now whole in his hands, reflected not a face but a clearing in the forest—a place that existed nowhere, and therefore everywhere. <words>230</words>  
He buried the masks beneath the oldest tree, their stories merging with roots that would outlive all wars, all forgetting. <words>247</words>  
The plants whispered his name for the first time that night, a sound like wind through fractured glass, finally at rest. <words>264</words>  
He did not return to the world, nor did he stay; he simply dissolved into the puzzle, a piece that fit by vanishing. <words>282</words>  
The researchers noted only that the plants thrived after he left, their leaves curling in patterns eerily reminiscent of human hands letting go. <words>300</words>  
And in the mirror, if you look closely, you can still see him—kneeling, planting, becoming, nowhere and everywhere all at once. <words>318</words>
