<story>  
The child’s question—“Why do stars fall?”—hung in the air, unanswered, as Elara descended into the catacombs, her boots crunching through centuries of dust. <words>17</words>  
She was a torn visionary, fractured by the weight of her own stubborn optimism, still chasing the fragments of her father’s unfinished work: a map of solar cycles etched into the bones of time. <words>35</words>  
The overgrown library loomed ahead, its shelves warped by roots and damp, shelves stacked with tomes whose spines whispered secrets of lost light. <words>50</words>  
She’d followed the trail here, guided by a shared love for *The Book of Hollow Suns*, a text both she and her father believed held the key to decoding the heavens’ rhythm. <words>68</words>  
Her fingers brushed a cracked leather volume—same edition, same brittle pages—but the symbols inside were wrong, incomplete, missing pieces that made her pulse thrum with frustration. <words>86</words>  
Then she saw it: a cellphone, sleek and anachronistic, perched atop a pedestal like an offering. Manufactured in 1920, its brass frame glinted, screen dark but warm, as if waiting. <words>105</words>  
When she pressed its cracked dial, voices spilled out—her father’s, overlapping with a child’s laughter, a recording from a decade past, before the accident stole him from the world above. <words>124</words>  
“Elara,” the voice said, “yield to the gaps. The cycles aren’t broken; they’re breathing.” <words>134</words>  
Her throat tightened. All those years blaming herself for the unfinished equations, the missing data—what if the flaw was her refusal to accept the wild, untamed edges of truth? <words>151</words>  
The library shuddered as roots split the ceiling, spilling sunlight onto the book’s final page: coordinates, aligned with the solar calendar, pointing to a stone altar beneath the earth. <words>169</words>  
She dialed the cellphone’s ancient number, heart racing, and a boy materialized beside her—wide-eyed, clutching a copy of *The Book of Hollow Suns*, his presence both impossible and inevitable. <words>188</words>  
“You’re… the child from the archive footage,” she breathed. “The one who asked about falling stars.” <words>199</words>  
He nodded. “You never answered. But I think you’re here to finish what he started.” <words>210</words>  
Together, they climbed to the surface, the cellphone pulsing with starlight as it synced to the solar grid her father had envisioned—a mosaic of gaps and light, imperfect, alive. <words>228</words>  
At dawn, Elara placed the book on the altar, its pages fluttering in the wind, and yielded. The missing pieces didn’t need fixing; they were invitations to wonder, to track the sun’s grief and joy, its wild, careful dance. <words>250</words>  
The boy pointed skyward. “They fall,” he said, “so new ones can rise.” <words>259</words>  
Elara smiled, the weight lifting, and for the first time, the library’s silence felt not like loss, but a held breath—waiting for the next question. <words>275</words>
