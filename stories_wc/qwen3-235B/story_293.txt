The nervous minstrel plucked his lute beneath the bioluminescent haze of Lumora, a city thrumming with bacteria-fed light, his music swallowed by the revelers’ cautious cheers. <words>17</words>  
His fingers trembled, not from stage fright but the crumpled photograph tucked into his boot—a faded image of a starry sky, the only relic from his father, who’d vanished seeking a world beyond Lumora’s green-glow confines. <words>42</words>  
“Play something sincere!” a voice slurred, but the minstrel rarely was; his smiles were masks, his songs half-truths, for he’d secretly plotted escape since finding the photo’s hidden coordinates. <words>65</words>  
Tonight, he’d deploy his plan: navigate by star patterns, a forgotten art in a city where artificial light drowned the heavens, trusting the candle in his pocket would last until he reached the outskirts. <words>93</words>  
The festival’s revelry masked his exit, dancers swirling like shadows in the bacteria-powered lanterns’ flicker, their joy tinged with the fear that tomorrow’s uncertainty might swallow it whole. <words>118</words>  
He slipped into the alleys, the candle’s flame his only clock—its wax melting faster as he reached the city’s edge, where the glow dimmed and stars pierced the sky like ancient beacons. <words>144</words>  
Unfolding the photo, he matched its creased constellations to the real ones above, heart racing as alignment revealed a path through the toxic marshes beyond, where Lumora’s founders were rumored to have fled. <words>173</words>  
A drone’s buzz halted him; the city’s sentinels patrolled, programmed to deter deserters, but he crouched low, humming a lullaby his father once sang—a melody of escape, not surrender. <words>201</words>  
The candle guttered, its flame clinging to life as he reached the marsh’s threshold, the air thick with the scent of living fuel and the weight of his own indecision. <words>226</words>  
Why seek purpose where none might exist? The question haunted him, yet the photo’s silent plea—*follow, find, become*—drowned doubt in a tide of maybe. <words>249</words>  
He stepped forward, the ground squelching beneath his boots, stars guiding him as Lumora’s light faded, its revelers oblivious to the minstrel who traded artifice for the raw, uncertain dark. <words>276</words>  
Behind, the candle died; ahead, the marsh whispered secrets older than bacteria or song, and for once, his heart beat not in fear, but the quiet thrill of a choice deployed. <words>303</words>  
The photograph, now cradled in his palm, was no longer a crumpled relic but a compass, its edges fraying like the boundary between who he was and who he might yet become. <words>330</words>  
In the distance, a glimmer—not Lumora’s false glow, but firelight, human and raw, where strangers might share tales of star-crossed journeys, and he could finally play a song that trembled with truth. <words>358</words>  
The marsh hissed, the path dissolved, and the minstrel, no longer nervous, no longer a minstrel at all, walked on, weaving his own pattern into the dark. <words>383</words>
