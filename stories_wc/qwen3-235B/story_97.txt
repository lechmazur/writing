In the unstable dimension where facts unraveled like frayed thread, the fact-minded oracle adjusted their brass compass, its needle trembling between certainty and chaos. <words>17</words>  
They had mapped every known fracture in this realm, yet the path to empathy—a concept as elusive as the dimension’s shifting skies—remained a void in their equations. <words>34</words>  
“Empathy isn’t data,” they muttered, desperately casual, as if dismissing the ache of their last failed attempt to decode a heartbreak-induced vision. <words>50</words>  
The compass, however, pulsed warm, its gears grinding a rhythm only they could hear: a map to forgotten places where emotions festered, buried under centuries of logic. <words>68</words>  
A tremor rippled through the air, and the oracle staggered as a vision seized them—a memory not their own, sharp with grief. <words>83</words>  
They saw a child weeping in a crumbling library, her tears dissolving inked constellations into smudges; the oracle recognized her, a historian erased by the dimension’s hunger for oblivion. <words>103</words>  
The vision fractured, leaving the oracle gasping, their chest hollowed by a stranger’s sorrow—a sensation they’d once labeled “inefficient.” <words>118</words>  
Recompose, they instructed themselves, recalibrating the compass, but their hands shook; empathy was contaminating their precision. <words>133</words>  
The dimension coiled tighter, seconds collapsing into the cradle of a whispered minute, the air thinning to translucence. <words>147</words>  
They pressed forward, the compass now vibrating toward a fissure veiled in moth-wing fog, where forgotten places hummed in dissonant chorus. <words>164</words>  
Another vision: a soldier dropping his blade to cradle a dying enemy, his own wounds ignored—a choice the oracle had previously deemed “statistically irrational.” <words>183</words>  
This time, they let the grief linger, their breath syncing with the soldier’s final heartbeat, their logic circuits sputtering under the weight of *why*. <words>200</words>  
The brass compass glowed, its needle steadying for the first time, and the oracle laughed—a raw, startled sound—as equations dissolved into understanding. <words>218</words>  
Empathy wasn’t a path, but a bridge; each heartbreak-induced vision a plank, each forgotten place a keystone. <words>232</words>  
They plunged into the fissure, the dimension’s instability peaking, and found the nexus: a chamber where every lost story converged—a library, a battlefield, a womb of unfinished symphonies. <words>253</words>  
Here, the historian’s ink and the soldier’s blood intertwined, and the oracle wept, their tears etching new maps onto the compass’s face. <words>270</words>  
Optimistic desperation fueled them—the knowledge that to return meant embracing chaos, yet the alternative was to stagnate in sterile truth. <words>287</words>  
They recomposed not their data, but their purpose, wiring empathy into their core; the compass spun wildly, then pointed outward, toward countless other nexuses. <words>305</words>  
As the dimension shuddered, birthing new fractures, the oracle stepped through a rift, their once-frigid voice softening with the urgency of a whispered minute: “There’s more to find.” <words>324</words>  
The brass compass, now a living thing, hummed against their palm, guiding them toward the next heartbreak, the next bridge—endless, radiant, necessary. <words>342</words>
