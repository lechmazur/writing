<story>  
The hermit knelt in the ghostly orchard, their calloused hands brushing soil from the spine of a pressed flower album, its pages brittle with age and purpose. <words>17</words>  
Beneath a burning comet’s crimson smear, they worked in deliberate silence, translating the orchard’s whispers through the angle of a half-bent weathervane, its rusted arrow trembling northward. <words>35</words>  
Each mindful choice—to prune, to water, to bury seeds beside wilted petals—was a rebellion against the barren ground, a defiance etched into the land’s cracked flesh. <words>53</words>  
The album, salvaged from a forgotten greenhouse, held maps of lost blooms: violets smudged like bruises, daisies faded to ghosts, their veins charting a language only the hermit could parse. <words>73</words>  
They’d moved through deserts and frost before settling here, drawn by the orchard’s skeletal promise, its hunger mirroring their own. <words>90</words>  
At dawn, the weathervane’s tilt shifted east, and the hermit followed, dragging a bucket of rainwater scummed green with algae to the roots of a blighted apple tree. <words>110</words>  
Theoretically rebellious, their acts were neither random nor futile; each motion coaxed memory from the soil,唤醒 dormant spores of hope. <words>128</words>  
When the comet’s tail flared, casting long shadows of branches that no longer existed, the hermit pressed a fresh flower—a ragged chickweed—into the album’s final page. <words>148</words>  
They whispered to the ground in the syntax of broken petals, translating decay into prophecy, their voice a low hum harmonizing with the wind’s metallic sigh through bent iron. <words>168</words>  
Seasons cycled. The weathervane’s groan became a familiar dirge, yet the hermit persisted, sowing salvaged pollen in frost, shielding shoots from ash falling like snow. <words>187</words>  
One dusk, a shoot pierced the soil near the blighted tree—a stem slender and defiant, crowned with a bud the color of unbruised sky. <words>205</words>  
The hermit did not smile. Instead, they adjusted the weathervane, noting the angle where the bud trembled, and turned the album’s page. <words>222</words>  
Years blurred. The orchard’s ghosts thinned, replaced by the rustle of leaves where there had been only silence; the comet dwindled to a smudge, then vanished. <words>242</words>  
When travelers stumbled upon the grove, they found a figure bent yet unbroken, tending flowers that shimmered faintly, as if lit from within. <words>261</words>  
They did not ask who the hermit was. They saw only the album, open at their knee, and the weathervane, steady now, pointing toward a horizon thick with green. <words>281</words>  
The hermit had become root and rumor alike—a guardian of deliberate wilderness, proof that mindful hands could bend desolation into hymn. <words>300</words>  
When their own body finally sank into the soil, the album was buried with them, its pages a cipher for whoever might translate rebellion into bloom. <words>319</words>  
The orchard endured, a testament to choices that rippled beyond flesh, each flower a comma in a sentence still growing. <words>337</words>
