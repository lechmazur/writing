The hesitant bard clutched the worn-out dinosaur plush to their chest, its frayed seams and faded eyes mirroring their own exhaustion as they stood in the xenon-lit tunnel, where cold blue light hummed against the curved walls like a trapped star. <words>28</words>  
They had stolen the dream-hopping machine hours ago—a bulky, hissing contraption strapped to their back—and now its gears groaned in rhythm with their heartbeat, counting down to the year’s end, a moment everyone would rather forget. <words>54</words>  
The plush, a relic from childhood, had always smelled of campfire and rain, a scent that now taunted them with memories of warmth they could no longer feel. <words>74</words>  
“Motivate,” the machine’s inventor had hissed, shoving a fistful of copper coils into their hands, but motivation felt as fragile as time itself, a threadbare tapestry woven from the collective sorrow of a dying era. <words>103</words>  
The bard’s voice, shyly loud in the tunnel’s sterile silence, cracked a nursery rhyme their mother once sang—a sound both defiant and broken. <words>122</words>  
They activated the machine.  

The world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of strangers’ dreams: a widow dancing with her dead spouse’s shadow, a soldier choking on guilt in a field of poppies, a child sobbing over a cracked music box. <words>149</words>  
Each vision pierced the bard like a needle, threads of sorrow stitching themselves into their ribs until they gasped, the plush slipping from their grip to hover midair, glowing faintly, as though the machine had awakened something ancient in its stuffing. <words>178</words>  
Awe tightened their throat. <words>184</words>  
They reached for the plush, and the dreamscape shifted—a cavern of clocks, each ticking backward, their gears entangled in the tapestry’s threads. <words>203</words>  
At the center loomed a loom, operated by a figure with their own face, weary and grinning. <words>217</words>  
“You think unraveling it will fix things?” the figure asked, voice dripping irony. <words>231</words>  
The bard hesitated, then strummed their lute, a discordant note slicing through the cavern. <words>246</words>  
Clocks shattered. <words>251</words>  

They woke in the tunnel, the machine sparking its last. <words>261</words>  
Outside, fireworks screamed into the sky, blotting out the stars as the year died. <words>275</words>  
The plush lay still, its glow extinguished, yet the air smelled of campfire and rain. <words>291</words>  
The bard laughed—a raw, loud sound—and sang to the tunnel’s indifferent lights, their voice weaving through the xenon hum, a requiem for what was never fixed, but briefly, fiercely, felt. <words>320</words>  
Time, they realized, was not a tapestry, but a scream into the void, and the scream mattered. <words>337</words>  
When dawn came, they walked out of the tunnel, the plush tucked into their coat, its weight a small, unyielding truth. <words>357</words>  
No one remembered the old year. <words>365</words>  
No one but the bard, who carried its ghosts like a melody they’d never stop playing. <words>381</words>  
The machine, now ash and scrap, had taught them that fragility was not weakness, but a kind of courage—the courage to unravel, and begin again. <words>404</words>  
They smiled, shyly loud, and stepped into the forgetting world. <words>415</words>
