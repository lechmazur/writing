The astute hermit crouched in the phosphorescent cavern cathedral, his calloused hands wrestling with corroded pipes, the blunt scissors his only tool for prying loose decades of mineral crusting. <words>22</words>  
He’d long abandoned the elevator shaft above—its rusted cables groaned like a dying animal, and the last time it shuddered to his floor, it had spat out nothing but a single moldy boot, a relic of the vanished engineers he’d once called colleagues. <words>51</words>  
Isolation had honed his mind to a razor’s edge; he’d deduced the water system’s secrets through the logic of root growth and fungal spore patterns, though his body had softened into despairing humor—his ribs jutted like cracked stalactites, and he hummed show tunes to the bioluminescent moss as he worked. <words>85</words>  
The scissors, dull as a bureaucrat’s wit, were strangely effective at shearing through the calcified conduits, a fact he attributed to the same cosmic irony that had spared his life during the Great Flood of ‘39 while drowning his wife and her casserole recipes. <words>120</words>  
When the elevator clanged to a stop at his floor again—empty, as always—he sighed, tossing the boot a half-hearted kick; it sailed into a cluster of luminescent lilies, releasing a scent like fresh-baked bread, a fragrance that amplified his hunger and his resolve in equal measure. <words>157</words>  
The lilies reacted violently to the aroma, their tendrils curling inward, exuding a syrupy resin that seeped into the fractured mainline—a miracle of chemistry he couldn’t begin to parse, though he’d later scribble in his journal: *“Bread smells fix pipes. Wife would’ve hated this.”* <words>194</words>  
As water gushed clear and cold from the formerly desiccated valves, he laughed, a ragged sound that echoed off the fungal vaults, and wondered if the surface world still remembered the man who’d restored their reservoirs using only blunt tools, bad jokes, and a cavern’s absurd perfume. <words>233</words>  
The elevator dinged again, as if impatient, but he ignored it, kneading dough from his last sack of flour—next time, he’d think, he’d bake a loaf so fragrant it would resurrect the dead, or at least coax the engineers back down from their sky-blimps. <words>269</words>  
His hands trembled, not from fatigue but the weight of his epiphany: isolation had not eroded him but transmuted him into something feral and useful, a prophet of damp stone and second chances, though he’d never claim the title—titles required audiences, and audiences required stairs. <words>307</words>  
When the bread emerged from the oven, golden and defiant, he placed it on the elevator platform as an offering or a dare, watching the contraption ascend to the unknown with a creak that sounded almost like gratitude. <words>341</words>  
He returned to the pipes, humming “Singin’ in the Rain,” the scissors glinting faintly in the glow of the flora, which now pulsed in rhythm with the water’s flow—a cathedral alive, not just with light, but with the stubborn, ridiculous heartbeat of a world stitching itself back together. <words>380</words>  
The boot, forgotten, slowly sprouted mushrooms that smelled of rosemary and hope. <words>394</words>
