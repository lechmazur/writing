<story>  
The dry-witted sentinel stood in the lighthouse keeper’s bedroom, the air thick with salt and regret, a frayed piece of rope coiled like a serpent on the splintered desk. <words>22</words>  
The final name had been crossed off the list hours ago—twelve years of vengeance reduced to ash—but the ghost still lingered, its breath a cold draft against the sentinel’s neck. <words>45</words>  
“Eroding promises,” the sentinel muttered, plucking the rope, its fibers snapping like brittle bones. “Should’ve kept your word, old man.” <words>63</words>  
The ghost’s hollow eyes flickered, and the room shuddered. A dance, then—a reckless precision demanded by the rules of this cursed place. <words>82</words>  
They’d learned the traditional methods, the sentinel had, studying brittle scrolls and the whispers of drowned sailors, all to master the *saltarello*, a dance that bound oaths to flesh. <words>107</words>  
The sentinel’s boots struck the floorboards in time with the ghost’s phantom heartbeat, each step a confiscation of its power, the rope tightening around its spectral throat. <words>131</words>  
It was certainly possible to die here, caught between worlds, but the sentinel’s smirk never wavered; wit was a sharper blade than any knife. <words>154</words>  
The ghost thrashed, its form unraveling like the rope’s frayed ends, memories of broken vows—unkept oaths to stranded travelers—spilling into the air. <words>176</words>  
The sentinel danced harder, knees sharp, arms slicing the gloom, until the ghost’s scream fused with the gale, its final curse dissolving into seafoam. <words>200</words>  
The rope snapped. The sentinel caught the frayed ends, breathing hard, the bedroom now silent save for the lighthouse’s distant, indifferent beacon. <words>223</words>  
Twelve names, twelve years. The list was gone, but the sentinel kept the rope—a reminder that promises, like ghosts, cling until forced to let go. <words>246</words>  
They’d learned the dance to survive, but the rhythm lingered, a pulse beneath the skin, a shared language with the dead. <words>268</words>  
The sentinel lit a cigarette, the match hissing like a ghost, and stared at the crossed-out list. One promise left to erode: their own. <words>291</words>  
Outside, the waves gnawed at the rocks, patient as time, while the sentinel exhaled smoke, already planning the next dance. <words>312</words>  
The rope’s fibers, gray as old bones, brushed their palm—a warning, a requiem. Some promises refuse to drown. <words>334</words>  
But the sentinel had always favored reckless precision, and the sea, for all its hunger, had never tasted their end. <words>356</words>  
The lighthouse groaned, alive with new ghosts, but the sentinel’s steps were sure, their shadow a twin to the waltz still echoing in the dark. <words>380</words>  
They’d confiscate the rope again, if needed, and dance until the stars blinked out—one eroded promise at a time. <words>401</words>  
The final name was ashes; the first name waited, unborn. The sentinel smiled, and the sea listened. <words>422</words>
