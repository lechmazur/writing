The time-looping paramedic gripped the steering wheel, the weathered fishing lure dangling from the rearview mirror casting fractured light across the dashboard as the ambulance shuddered through the quantum tunnel’s flickering haze. <words>22</words>  
She’d relived this shift 317 times, each reset triggered by the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess from her childhood—a sound now etched into her bones, syncing with the arrhythmia of her heartbeat. <words>45</words>  
The lure, rusted and chipped, had been her father’s last gift before he vanished; she’d found it lodged in the seat cushion of his abandoned truck the day her mother began scrubbing his existence from their home. <words>69</words>  
Privately public, she wore her trauma like a second uniform: efficient, smirking, endlessly curious about others’ wounds while her own festered beneath the surface, a silent hemorrhage. <words>91</words>  
Tonight’s loop demanded she nest—not the ambulance’s vinyl seats or her studio apartment, but the tunnel itself, its walls shimmering with the memories of collisions she’d never prevented, screams she’d failed to mute. <words>117</words>  
She’d learned to track the sound of a single raindrop striking metal, a frequency only audible here, guiding her to the fracture point where past and present bled together. <words>141</words>  
The bell’s echo would come at 2:13 a.m., same as always, followed by the crash: a minivan hydroplaning on Route 9, two girls trapped, their faces blurred until she wept from knowing them too well. <words>167</words>  
But this time, she clutched the lure, its barbed hook biting her palm, and let the raindrop’s ping steer her hands toward the glove compartment’s hidden latch, revealing her father’s frayed journal. <words>193</words>  
His entries confessed the truth—the truck hadn’t broken down; he’d fled a gambling debt, leaving the lure as a sorry talisman for the daughter he’d failed. <words>216</words>  
The tunnel convulsed, the sound of the raindrop swelling into a deluge as she screamed, not at the crash ahead, but at the memory of her mother’s voice: “Trauma’s a closed loop, sweetheart. Either break it or become it.” <words>244</words>  
She baptized the nightmare in acceptance then, hurling the lure into the tunnel’s core, its explosion of light dissolving the minivan, the journal, the bell’s echo into a single, searing note. <words>269</words>  
When dawn broke, she parked beside a lake she’d never seen, the ambulance silent, the rearview mirror empty—her palms healed, her radio crackling with a dispatch she’d never heard: “Unknown accident, Route 9, two girls alive, asking for you by name.” <words>297</words>  
The quantum tunnel had nested her, reshaped her; now, the world felt sharp and strange, each raindrop a hymn, each heartbeat steady, as she drove toward the call that had waited her whole life to be answered. <words>323</words>
