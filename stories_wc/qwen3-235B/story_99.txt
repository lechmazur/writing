<story>  
The bookbinder slouched against the splintered frame of the abandoned carnival prize booth, their telekinetic fingers idly flipping pages of a weathered ledger. <words>17</words>  
A single chopstick wrapper, crumpled like a question mark, glinted in the dust—a relic from a forgotten feast, or a clue. <words>34</words>  
They plucked it with a flick of their mind, the gesture as casual as a sigh, and wondered what knowledge had been traded for its crinkled silence. <words>52</words>  
A sudden snap—the wrapper tore—and the air hummed with a soundbite: *“To bind a book is to cage a soul.”* <words>69</words>  
The booth dissolved. <words>73</words>  
They were elsewhere, *when legends still bled ink*: a scribe in a burning library, hands blistered as they stitched together forbidden grimoires, each page a scream. <words>97</words>  
Back in the booth, the wrapper trembled, its folds now etched with faint glyphs—a map to transformation’s core. <words>114</words>  
Another soundbite crackled: *“What you bind will bind you.”* <words>126</words>  
Flashback—centuries collapsed—the bookbinder now a thief in a moonlit archive, stealing a manuscript that whispered of telekinetic gods dethroned by their own hunger. <words>150</words>  
The wrapper’s glyphs flared; the booth’s shadows thickened into a tapestry of lost legends, threads glinting with the price of knowing. <words>173</words>  
They laughed, a strictly casual sound, though their palms sweat: the power to revive forgotten truths was never free. <words>191</words>  
A third soundbite—a child’s voice: *“Turn the page.”* <words>203</words>  
The flashback struck like a carnival bell: a girl with telekinetic hands, binding her own memories into a book to escape her father’s pyre. <words>226</words>  
The booth groaned; the wrapper unraveled, revealing a sliver of jade—a shard of the first chopstick used to part the sea, myth said. <words>248</words>  
Knowledge pooled in their skull: transformation was not power, but surrender. <words>263</words>  
They hurled the shard into the air, telekinesis sharp as a curse, and the booth erupted into a storm of pages and light. <words>284</words>  
Legends coalesced—scribes, thieves, girls with broken hearts—each face a mirror, each story a price tag fluttering in the gale. <words>307</words>  
The soundbites merged into a chorus: *“To know is to burn. To bind is to become.”* <words>324</words>  
The bookbinder tore their own chest open—metaphor, or almost—and let the wind scour them clean. <words>343</words>  
When the storm died, the booth stood renewed, its wood etched with fresh glyphs, the air ripe with stories not yet told. <words>368</words>  
The chopstick wrapper lay pristine, now a bridge between worlds, humming a strictly casual lullaby. <words>386</words>  
They pocketed it, their telekinetic touch gentle as a vow: the price of knowledge was not payment, but the letting go. <words>407</words>  
The carnival sighed, its ghosts drifting skyward like forgotten kites, and the bookbinder walked on, a spine newly bound with sea-salt and stars. <words>432</words>
