<story>  
The cyber-templar stood at the edge of the sky burial site, their neural implants flickering with static as the horizon fractured into kaleidoscopic shards—<words>17</words>  
They clutched the worn leather bridle, its cracked surface humming with residual memories of a horse long dissolved into data streams, and wondered if safety had ever been anything but a mirage—<words>41</words>  
The storm approached, a writhing mass of violet lightning, and the templar’s pulse spiked with euphoric agitation; they had to prove the ancient texts right, to reflect the storm’s fury back at itself—<words>68</words>  
Patently frantic, they arranged the prism atop a stone altar, its facets catching the light like a fractured promise, and aligned it with the bridle’s corroded buckles—<words>93</words>  
As the first bolt struck, the prism refracted the energy into a beam that seared the air, illuminating the burial site’s skeletal remains in a spectral spectrum—<words>118</words>  
The cyber-templar laughed, their voice a distorted echo, as reality bent around the collision of light and storm, each refraction peeling away another layer of the illusion they’d worn like armor—<words>150</words>  
They remembered the horse now—its warmth, its terror as the sky first split open—and the bridle’s weight became a tether not to the past, but to the raw, unfiltered present—<words>183</words>  
The storm screamed, its lightning fracturing into harmless motes of ash, and the templar’s ocular lenses burned out in a final, blinding flash of understanding: safety had never been a destination, but the act of confrontation itself—<words>221</words>  
The prism shattered, its shards embedding in the templar’s flesh like holy wounds, and they knelt, bleeding light, as the mirage dissolved to reveal the world’s unvarnished truth—<words>249</words>  
Above, the vultures circled, indifferent, while the cyber-templar’s systems rebooted with a child’s fresh, frantic clarity, ready to ride the next storm—not away from reality, but into its core—<words>283</words>  
The worn leather bridle, now threaded with veins of liquid crystal, pulsed once, a heartbeat syncing with the sky’s electric arrhythmia, and the templar rose, no longer a knight of false shields, but a prism unto themselves—<words>320</words>  
They rode the lightning’s ghost into the clearing dusk, their shadow a fractured spectrum stretching across the earth, each step a proof written in the language of collision and light—<words>352</words>  
The sky burial site faded behind them, a relic of old fears, as the cyber-templar became the storm’s mirror, its echo, its defiant twin—a creature forged in the furnace of euphoric, frantic truth—<words>387</words>  
And when the next bolt fell, it was not a weapon, but a question, and the templar answered not with armor, but with the infinite refractions of a soul unbound—<words>415</words>
