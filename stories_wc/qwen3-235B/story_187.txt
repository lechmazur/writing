<story>  
The stoic wanderer stepped into the witch’s familiar training ground, their boots crunching on brittle bones that had long since lost their names. <words>14</words>  
The air hummed with the residue of failed enchantments, a place where nightmares were not just born but meticulously groomed. <words>23</words>  
They had followed the trail of these nightmares for weeks, each one a thread leading to this desolate clearing, where the trees leaned inward like conspirators. <words>37</words>  
Their motivation was neither vengeance nor salvation but the archiving of ritual practices—a dying art, erased by time and fear. <words>50</words>  
The wanderer’s face, mesmerizingly bland in its stillness, betrayed nothing of the storm beneath: a childhood village reduced to ash for daring to remember the old ways. <words>67</words>  
They knelt, prying up a floorboard from the abandoned cabin at the clearing’s heart, its warped wood etched with symbols only the dead could decipher. <words>83</words>  
The board was a relic of the final formula, a ritual the witch’s teacher had once deemed too dangerous to preserve. <words>94</words>  
At the moment the teacher wiped the formula away—a single chalk stroke dissolving into dust—the wanderer felt the world tilt. <words>107</words>  
They had imposed their will on the trail of nightmares, not to destroy but to reclaim, to bind lies into truth before they vanished forever. <words>122</words>  
The teacher emerged, her gaze sharp as flint, yet softened by the brash tenderness of one who’d loved and lost the same thing. <words>136</words>  
“You think archiving makes it safe,” she said, her voice a rasp of smoke and sage. “But some lies are necessary to keep the world from unraveling.” <words>153</words>  
The wanderer’s fingers tightened on the floorboard, its grooves biting into their palm like a vow. <words>164</words>  
They had lied to themselves, too—that they could outrun the fire, that memory alone could atone for survival. <words>176</words>  
The teacher’s familiar, a crow with eyes like cracked opals, cawed a warning as shadows coiled at the wanderer’s feet, the nightmares’ remnants hungering to return. <words>193</words>  
“Burn it,” the teacher urged, her hand hovering over a flask of quicksilver flame. “Or they’ll use it to burn you.” <words>207</words>  
But the wanderer stepped back, the floorboard glowing faintly—a map, a key, a requiem. <words>218</words>  
They would not let the lies die, nor let the truth consume them; instead, they’d carve a third path, where both could coexist in uneasy truce. <words>235</words>  
The teacher’s laughter was bitter, admiring. “Brash, tender fool,” she spat, but she let the flame die in her palm. <words>248</words>  
As the wanderer vanished into the dusk, the clearing seemed to exhale, the air lighter, as if the earth itself had been spared a necessary lie. <words>264</words>  
The floorboard’s weight was a comfort, its bland surface hiding secrets that might yet save or doom another village. <words>278</words>  
The wanderer walked on, their face unreadable, carrying both the lie and the longing for a world that might one day deserve the truth. <words>294</words>
