<story>  
The groggy brewer stumbled into the haunted mansion graveyard, his boots crunching over frostbitten thistle, a piece of a broken mirror clutched like a communion wafer in his calloused palm. <words>19</words>  
He’d slept three hours, tops, haunted by the encroaching darkness that seeped into his brewery’s cellar each night, souring barley and whispering in dead languages. <words>39</words>  
The staircase before him spiraled into the earth, its wooden slats warped and pocked with rot, a slight greenish tint staining the third step down—a discoloration only he’d notice, what with his uniquely generic eye for imperfections honed by years of spotting tainted hops. <words>75</words>  
“C’mon, protest’s waiting,” he muttered, half to the lull in voices echoing from the road beyond the graveyard, half to the thing in the dark that wasn’t quite a thing yet. <words>102</words>  
His motivation wasn’t heroism but a stubborn refusal to let his values curdle into cynicism; if he could ferment light from shadow, he’d bottle it and sell it at a markup. <words>129</words>  
The staircase groaned as he initiated his descent, the mirror shard flaring cold in his fist, reflecting not his bloodshot eyes but a flicker of the darkness coalescing below—a roiling mass of teeth and apology. <words>160</words>  
Flippant solemnity governed his approach: he’d named his ale “Hallowed Ground” for this night, brewing it with graveyard soil and defiance, because sacraments needed hops too. <words>189</words>  
At the spiral’s nadir, the discoloration bloomed into a fissure, the air thick with the smell of struck flint and wet wool, the darkness now a chorus of whispers pleading, *Stay bitter. Stay blind.* <words>221</words>  
He dropped the mirror into the fissure, its fracture splitting into a thousand judgments, and poured the ale into the void, where it hissed like a struck match, igniting the dark into a cathedral of flame. <words>253</words>  
Above, the protest voices regathered, chanting his name—or was it the mansion’s groan, the staircase collapsing as the light surged, uniquely generic yet searing in its specificity? <words>284</words>  
The brewer didn’t look back; his shadow now stretched into a spire, every cell a sermon, every pore a hymn—fermented, filtered, and fiercely alive. <words>311</words>  
The darkness retreated, not defeated but disoriented, outmaneuvered by a man who’d rather brew than brood, who’d weaponized his grogginess into a covenant. <words>340</words>  
When dawn came, the graveyard’s headstones bore new etchings: *Here lies the night. Here, the stubborn light.* The brewer, now both keg and crusade, hitched his thumbs into his belt and whistled off-key. <words>374</words>  
The staircase vanished by noon, leaving only a faint green stain on the grass—a discoloration no one noticed but him, a glyph of the deal he’d struck: to embody what he once merely brewed. <words>407</words>  
Protesters found him there, haloed in ale-soaked glory, and asked how it felt to win. He snorted. “Tastes like Tuesday,” he said, and walked home to start again. <words>437</words>  
The darkness would return, sure—it always did—but so would he, a groggy apostle of the ferment, his values carbonated and unyielding, the world’s sorrow sloshed into something worth sipping. <words>470</words>
