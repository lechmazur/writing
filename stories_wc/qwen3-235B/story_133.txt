The jaded locksmith, Elias Vare, had spent decades coaxing secrets from rusted tumblers and warped keyholes, but none had wearied him more than the anonymous letter directing him to an unclaimed throne hidden in the labyrinth orchard atop the colonial town’s rooftops. <words>44</words>  
He wore his late mother’s embroidered gloves—lavender thread curling into ivy patterns—as he navigated the pottery class where he’d arranged to meet the letter’s sender, a figure who’d signed only *“Clemency, Keeper of the Unseen.”* <words>85</words>  
The class was a ruse; Elias had no interest in clay, only in the map Clemency had promised, a guide to the throne said to permeate the town’s history like ink in parchment, its power tied to preserving the ancient hunting methods Elias’s father had died defending. <words>127</words>  
When Clemency arrived, she carried a shard of porcelain painted with a wolf mid-howl, her smile delightfully menacing as she slid the map—a slip of vellum sewn into a glove identical to Elias’s—across the table. <words>164</words>  
“You’re the last heir who still remembers the hunt,” she murmured, her voice a demure audacity that clashed with the ferocity in her eyes. “The throne’s yours if you can reach it before the town’s painters finish their work. They erase what they don’t understand.” <words>205</words>  
The labyrinth orchard, Elias learned, was a maze of espaliered apple trees grafted into walls and bridges, its paths shifting with the tides of the harbor below, a colonial relic where hunters once swore oaths beneath a crown of antlers. <words>244</words>  
He climbed at dawn, gloves snagging on ivy, the map’s symbols aligning with constellations carved into roofstones, while below, painters in white overalls daubed the town’s facades in bright, oblivious streaks. <words>280</words>  
The throne itself was a gnarled root of the first tree planted by the colony’s founder, its surface etched with the tracks of extinct game, its aura permeating Elias’s bones with the weight of forgotten chases. <words>316</words>  
He hesitated, Clemency’s warning echoing—*claim it, and you become the hunt’s guardian; refuse, and let the town paint over its past*—as his gloved hand brushed the throne, the embroidery blooming violet where it touched. <words>354</words>  
Memories surged: his father’s voice recounting how the throne’s magic bound hunters to the land, how the town had silenced such rituals to court modernity, leaving only the locksmiths’ guild to whisper the old oaths. <words>391</words>  
When the painters reached the orchard’s edge, Elias stood, throne now a sapling sprouting from his palm, its roots threaded through his gloves. “The hunt isn’t dead,” he declared, voice steady as a blade, and the trees shivered, their blossoms falling like snow on a newly drawn map. <words>440</words>  
Clemency laughed, low and approving, as the town below paused, brushes dripping, to stare at the orchard’s sudden, defiant growth—a throne reclaimed, a history no longer unclaimed. <words>480</words>  
Elias turned to her, gloved hands already planning the first lock to safeguard the sapling’s magic, knowing the hunters’ legacy would now permeate a future the painters could never erase. <words>520</words>
