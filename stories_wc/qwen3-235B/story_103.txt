<story>  
The weatherbeaten knight stood at the base of the lighthouse prison, salt spray from the jagged reef below gnawing at his rust-pitted armor, his gloved hand tightening around a satchel of seemingly random items—a cracked hourglass, a moth-eaten glove, a sparrow’s feather—each chosen not by chance but by a pattern only he could decipher. <words>44</words>  
He had followed their silent logic here, to this place where the sea screamed against stone and the sky mirrored the earth in a warped, liquid shimmer, trapping time within its reflection like a fly in amber. <words>76</words>  
The brass door knocker hung before him, tarnished but unbroken, shaped like a serpent swallowing its tail; he lifted it, hesitated, and let it fall, the clang echoing not outward but inward, into the marrow of his bones. <words>110</words>  
A voice slithered through the keyhole: *“Impossible choices demand impossible sacrifices. You know this.”* The knight’s jaw tightened, grudgingly sweet memories of a child’s laughter—his own, once—flickering like a guttering candle. <words>144</words>  
He had spent decades evading this moment, yet here he was, appreciating the cruel poetry of his return: the prison held not criminals but regrets, and its final inmate was himself. <words>176</words>  
The door yawned open, revealing a chamber where mirrors lined every wall, each reflecting not his face but fragments of roads not taken—a farmer’s life, a lover’s kiss, a throne left unclaimed. <words>210</words>  
At the room’s heart floated a crystalline cage, within which writhed a shadow that screamed when the mirrors dimmed; the knight understood: to hush the final cry of regret, he had to choose which version of himself would die. <words>247</words>  
He traced the pattern of his items on the floor—the hourglass spilled sand into the shape of a crown, the feather aligned with the glove to point at the serpent’s eye—and laughed bitterly. <words>279</words>  
The answer had been here all along: the prison was a riddle, and its key was surrender. He pressed his palm to the mirror reflecting his youngest self, the one who had first grasped a sword instead of a plow. <words>313</words>  
The cage imploded, the shadow bursting free as a deafening silence fell; the knight felt his knees buckle, his memories unraveling like thread pulled through a wound. <words>343</words>  
In the mirrored walls, his many selves nodded, their regrets dissolving into light. The lighthouse beam flared, cutting through the storm, and for a heartbeat, he was sweet, unbroken—a boy smiling at fireflies, not a knight but a man. <words>379</words>  
Then the tower shuddered, the reef claiming its due, and the sea closed over the last impossible choice, leaving only the brass knocker, still warm, still waiting. <words>407</words>
