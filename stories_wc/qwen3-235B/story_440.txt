The detached swordsman lingered at the edge of the Neon Reclamation Yard, his blade sheathed, eyes tracing the fractured skyline of the futuristic city where drones hummed like wasps and holograms flickered like dying fireflies. <words>22</words>  
He’d come for the sea pottery—a single cerulean shard nestled in a bin of discarded collage scraps, its glaze whispering of oceans long vaporized by the sun’s slow tantrum. <words>45</words>  
The street artist’s mural across the yard’s rusted wall pulsed faintly; its final stroke, a swirl of gold, had dried moments ago, completing a phoenix rising from circuitry. <words>69</words>  
He meddled not with weapons, but with the fragments beneath his boots: torn sketches of eyes, wings, and equations, each a clue left by the secret weavers who stitched fate from chaos. <words>94</words>  
Lovingly detached, he sorted the scraps, recalling the vow he’d carved into his sword hilt—a promise to a sister swallowed by the city’s underbelly, her last gift the pottery shard he now clasped like a prayer. <words>124</words>  
The weavers had laughed through coded graffiti, their games turning lives into collages; he would reassemble this one, not for vengeance, but to consecrate her memory in a world that recycled even grief. <words>153</words>  
A drone buzzed low, scanning his movements; he froze, then flicked the shard skyward, its arc catching the mural’s glow, projecting a hologram of the phoenix mid-rebirth. <words>180</words>  
The collage scraps aligned under his gloved hands—a map to the weavers’ lair, hidden beneath the city’s oldest recycling furnace, where molten glass flowed like liquid stars. <words>206</words>  
Playful seriousness gripped him as he pocketed the shard; the weavers thrived on paradox, and only by embracing their absurd logic could he breach their labyrinth of mirrors and riddles. <words>234</words>  
He slipped past the mural, its phoenix now a living shadow on his back, and descended into the undercity, where the air tasted of burnt ozone and forgotten names. <words>261</words>  
The furnace roared ahead, its heat warping reality—there, the secret weavers spun threads of light, their faces shifting like kaleidoscopes, laughing until they saw the shard. <words>288</words>  
Silence. The swordsman laid the collage map at their feet, its reassembled image a child’s sketch of a girl holding a phoenix egg—their mistake, their loophole. <words>314</words>  
“You meddle with threads you cannot comprehend,” hissed a weaver, its voice a tapestry of static. <words>330</words>  
He unsheathed his blade, not to strike, but to reflect the shard’s light onto their loom, unraveling their tapestry with the pottery’s ancient, impossible wavelength. <words>357</words>  
The vow hummed in his chest: to let her go, yet never let the world forget her. The weavers dissolved into sparks, their loom crumbling into the collage scraps he’d begun with. <words>386</words>  
Aboveground, the mural blazed anew—a girl riding a phoenix, her hand clutching a shard of blue sea. The swordsman turned away, detachment softened by the ghost of a smile. <words>413</words>  
He left the yard, the city’s hum now a lullaby, carrying the weight of a vow fulfilled and the lightness of a story retold. <words>439</words>
