The sapped herbalist, once vibrant with the hues of wild meadows, now moved like a shadow through the glass-walled observatory, her fingers tracing the condensation on the panes where sea mist clung like a second skin. <words>22</words>  
She cherished the blacksmith’s bellows left rusting on the observatory’s ledge, its leather folds wheezing like a dying companion, yet within its tarnish lay the memory of heat—precise, relentless, the only force that could distill perfection from root and bloom. <words>47</words>  
Her motivation was not the tides themselves, but their patterns, the way they bowed to moon and stone, a rhythm she believed could mirror the alchemy of her craft if only she could parse the hidden arithmetic of retreat and return. <words>74</words>  
During her napping, when the world blurred into fever-dreams of chlorophyll and salt, she’d glimpse the flight path of a lone goose etching arcs across the sky, its V-shaped wake a cipher she could not crack, yet one she knew held the key to aligning her elixirs with celestial truth. <words>111</words>  
The observatory, perched on the cliff’s razored edge, hummed with the tension of her fervent indifference—a place where devotion and detachment bled into one another, where she cataloged tidal shifts with a thoughtfully thoughtless precision, as if by numbing her mind, the universe might pour its secrets into her veins. <words>148</words>  
She had traded sleep for charts, her body sapped by the labor of boiling kelp and starfish into tinctures that shimmered but failed, always flawed, their imperfections a thorn in her ribs, a reminder that the price of perfection was a debt paid in flesh and time. <words>179</words>  
One dusk, as she dozed against the glass, the goose returned, its wings slicing the horizon in a diagonal now mapped to a rogue tide’s surge, and she woke gasping, the bellows trembling in her hands as she stoked a fire beneath a cauldron of brine and crushed coral. <words>214</words>  
The concoction frothed, then stilled, its surface a mirror reflecting the goose’s flight, the tide’s whisper, her own hollow eyes—moments collapsing into a singularity where error and epiphany were one. <words>237</words>  
She drank, and the world sharpened: the cliff’s erosion slowed to a grind, the ocean’s breath became a hymn of millennia, the goose’s cry resolved into a single note of completion. <words>259</words>  
But perfection, she realized as her veins turned to glass and her heart stuttered like a faltering bellows, was a tide that drowned its harbinger. <words>277</words>  
The observatory kept its vigil, her journal open to a final entry—*“The flight path aligns not with the tide, but with the space between heartbeats”*—as the waves below claimed another secret, another seeker. <words>300</words>
