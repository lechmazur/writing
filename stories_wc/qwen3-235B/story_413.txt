The listless noble, Lord Eiren, had spent decades drifting through gilded halls, his existence as faded as the crimson scarf he kept knotted at his wrist—a relic of a lover who’d vanished into the haunted plain’s mist. <words>44</words>  
One dusk, a moth delivered an invitation inked in silver: “The maze hungers for laughter. Come.” <words>54</words>  
He scoffed, yet the note thrummed with the naively sophisticated charm of a child’s riddle, and so he rode toward the endless corn labyrinth, where shadows whispered of creatures not yet aware they were monsters. <words>81</words>  
The maze swallowed his horse at the threshold; he walked, the scarf’s frayed threads snagging on stalks that seemed to lean closer, listening. <words>101</words>  
A giggle echoed—a sound too bright for the place—and there she stood: a girl with eyes like lanterns, twirling a scarf identical to his. <words>124</words>  
“You’re late,” she said, as if they’d always met here, in this liminal dark, where intention bent reality like the paths folding around them. <words>149</words>  
She led him through the maze, their laughter weaving—a shared, defiant melody—as walls shifted to trap or release, he couldn’t tell. <words>173</words>  
“Why are we here?” he asked, and she tossed a kernel into the air; it became a sparrow, then a falling star. <words>194</words>  
“To remember,” she said. “Before they wake.” She gestured to the earth, where roots pulsed like hearts, birthing thoughts in the soil. <words>217</words>  
He laughed again, bitterly, recalling the lover he’d failed to follow into the plain, his grief too heavy to chase her ghost. <words>240</words>  
The girl pressed her scarf into his hand. “You think intention moves the world? Try meaning it.” <words>259</words>  
He hesitated, then whispered the lover’s name he’d buried. The maze shuddered; a figure emerged—a creature of stalks and sighs, its face a mirror of his own. <words>287</words>  
It reached for the scarves, its touch igniting memories: the lover’s smile, the girl’s laughter, the plain’s hunger for stories. <words>307</words>  
“You’re all of it,” the girl murmured. “The first laugh. The first regret. The first spark of something more.” <words>330</words>  
The creature dissolved into fireflies; dawn bled through the corn. Eiren’s scarf glowed anew, its red vibrant as a heartbeat. <words>353</words>  
He turned, but the girl was gone, leaving only the invitation, now scorched: “The maze is full. Go.” <words>370</words>  
He rode home, the haunted plain behind him humming with nascent voices, and for the first time, he did not feel alone. <words>394</words>  
The noble’s laughter lingered in the wind—a note of ironic awe, a bridge between what was and what might intend itself into being. <words>417</words>  
When the first creature blinked at the sun, it did so with Eiren’s eyes, and the world began. <words>437</words>
