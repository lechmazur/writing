The compassionate mage, Elara, traced her calloused fingers over the tarnished silver locket, its surface etched with runes only the dead should know. <words>17</words>  
She’d found it locked inside the attic trunk her grandmother swore contained “nothing but dust,” but the pendant hummed against her palm—a pulse of unspoken wisdom that made her knees weak. <words>40</words>  
Her workshop smelled of burnt sage and iron filings, precisely messy stacks of grimoires and submarine schematics strewn like breadcrumbs toward a truth she couldn’t name. <words>59</words>  
The intelligence center’s director had laughed when she’d demanded access to the rusted WWII sub buried beneath their compound. <words>75</words>  
“Sentimental junk,” he’d said, but Elara knew better—the locket’s twin, hanging around her neck, glowed faintly when aligned with the sub’s hull, its rivets forming a celestial map only magic could decipher. <words>105</words>  
She’d banished worse things than bureaucrats. <words>113</words>  
Midnight found her clambering over the sub’s corroded ribs, locket held high as the runes flared indigo. <words>127</words>  
The numbers carved into the metal—coordinates? A date?—resolved into a pattern matching her grandmother’s journal, pages water-warped and stubbornly mute until now. <words>150</words>  
“1943. Project Echo. They tried to weaponize the Veil,” she muttered, the locket’s wisdom spilling into her mind like a flood: souls trapped here, bound to the hull, waiting to be freed. <words>176</words>  
Her hands shook, but she channeled the spell through the rivets, each strike of her hammer a note in an elegy. <words>191</words>  
The sub groaned, spectral voices rising in a chorus of relief as the lockets’ light converged, unraveling the ancient binding that had festered beneath the compound for decades. <words>218</words>  
Elara’s nose bled, her veins on fire—the cost of banishing something hungry enough to gnaw through time itself—but the pendant grew warm, a silent thank-you from whatever had been listening all along. <words>248</words>  
When the director stormed in, shouting about “sabotage,” she turned, locket dangling like a pendulum over the now-dormant hull. <words>265</words>  
“You weren’t supposed to find this,” he hissed, but Elara smiled, weary and bright, the smell of ozone and history thick in her lungs. <words>286</words>  
“It wasn’t lost,” she said, pocketing the locket. <words>296</words>  
“It was waiting.” <words>301</words>  
The attic trunk would open itself soon, its secrets no longer teeth waiting to bite. <words>316</words>  
For now, the sub’s ghosts slept, and the world tilted, just slightly, toward mercy. <words>333</words>  
She’d banished a wound in the earth, but the scar remained—a reminder that some truths, once spoken, could never again be silent. <words>359</words>  
Elara left the intelligence center at dawn, her coat frayed and boots scuffed, carrying the weight of what she’d learned not in her pockets, but in her bones. <words>386</words>  
The locket’s twin, now dull and cold, rested against her collarbone—a question without an answer, or maybe a promise. <words>404</words>  
She’d need better tools for what came next. <words>414</words>  
But hope, she’d found, was a lot like magic: messy, precise, and relentless. <words>430</words>  
The mage walked on, the sun rising behind her like a blade being drawn. <words>445</words>  
Brutality awaited, but so did the truth. <words>456</words>  
She’d meet both with her sleeves rolled up. <words>467</words>
