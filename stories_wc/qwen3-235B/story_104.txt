The stoic steward adjusted the miniature world museum’s security grid, his fingers brushing the bird skull cameo at his throat—a relic smuggled via encrypted shipping labels, its hollow eyes venerated not as art but armor. <words>23</words>  
Outside, the orchard gate had closed on harvest day, sealing the valley in the cloying scent of overripe apples, a yearly ritual of conformity he’d long ceased pretending to honor. <words>45</words>  
The cameo’s rarity wasn’t myth; it was honestly rare, a shard of a pre-collapse species, its fractured beak a mirror of the cracks in the museum’s own façade: the dollhouse-sized cities with their painted smiles, the train tracks leading nowhere. <words>73</words>  
He moved through the exhibits, his boots silent on glass floors, noting how the holographic sun still “set” on schedule, a lie to make the miniature peasants feel eternal. <words>97</words>  
Conformity here was a lullaby, sung in the hum of automated bees, the static grin of the wax figures. <words>113</words>  
He hated it. <words>116</words>  
The encrypted labels had been his first rebellion—a network of dissidents trading fragments of truth in a world that preferred its history shrink-wrapped and docile. <words>137</words>  
Tonight, he’d use the cameo. <words>143</words>  
Its skull held a data chip, a map to the orchard’s root cellar, where the first cracks had begun: a cellar now brimming with unapproved seeds, unscripted stories, the charred pages of banned lullabies. <words>172</words>  
He’d venerated the cameo for years, not as a trinket but a covenant—to let no more harvests pass without a whisper of defiance. <words>191</words>  
The museum’s AI chimed—a saccharine alert about “maintenance delays.” <words>204</words>  
He ignored it, slipping into the orchard’s undercroft, the cameo glowing faintly as it decrypted the cellar’s lock. <words>219</words>  
Inside, crates of unstandardized fruit pulsed with latent riot, their skins bruised purple as twilight. <words>235</words>  
He touched a peach; it shivered, alive with the memory of unpruned branches. <words>247</words>  
Above, the museum’s façade trembled—a hairline split in the dome’s glass. <words>260</words>  
He smiled, cynically warm at the thought: a steward’s duty wasn’t to preserve, but to tend the cracks. <words>277</words>  
The first seed he planted in the display’s soil was apple, defiantly misshapen. <words>293</words>  
When the overseers came, they’d see only decay. <words>304</words>  
He’d venerated the cameo long enough; tonight, he became it—a hollow thing, sharp and unyielding, waiting to split open. <words>326</words>  
The orchard’s gate stayed closed, but the roots would find their way. <words>340</words>  
Conformity’s lullaby faltered as the cellar air filled with the scent of rot and bloom, honestly rare. <words>360</words>  
He left the cameo in the earth, its skull a promise: even miniature revolutions needed only a single unapproved seed. <words>383</words>  
The museum’s lights flickered above him—harvest day’s end, or the first breath of its unraveling. <words>400</words>  
He stood, dusted his hands, and walked back toward the façade’s glow, whistling a banned lullaby under his breath. <words>419</words>  
The steward’s job was to tend the world, after all. <words>431</words>  
And worlds, he knew, grew best in the cracks. <words>445</words>
