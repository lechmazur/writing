The steady gravedigger knelt beside the fractured limestone slab, his calloused hands brushing dust from the glyph-carved temple wall, where roots of the modern world—power lines, asphalt roads—tangled with the bones of an ancient Aztec shrine. <words>22</words>  
He adjusted his vintage magnifying glass, a brass-eyed relic from his grandfather’s time, and peered into the fissures where shadows pooled unnaturally, whispering secrets only he could hear. <words>44</words>  
The air hung in raucous silence, a hush hammered into being moments after he’d confessed to the temple’s guardian spirit—his dead wife’s voice echoing in the stones—that he’d failed to stop developers from paving the sacred grove. <words>73</words>  
Now, he worked diligently, whimsically, tracing constellations in the dirt with his trowel, aligning them with the magnifying glass’s warped lens, which refracted moonlight into jagged rainbows that danced like laughing gods. <words>102</words>  
Through the broken fence line east of the temple, wind surged, hissing the method of last rites long forgotten: to kindrelize the living and the dead, the temple and the traffic-clogged streets, the world that was and the world that greedily consumed it. <words>134</words>  
He placed an obsidian shard beneath the lens, focusing the wind’s hush into a beam that pierced the earth, awakening the roots of the ritual—the temple’s heart, a pulsing orb of trapped starlight, now dimmed by concrete. <words>163</words>  
The ground shuddered. Glyphs flared crimson, then blue, as overlapping worlds bled into each other: a conquistador’s ghost stumbled past a neon sign; a modern child’s laughter merged with a priestess’s chant. <words>190</words>  
The gravedigger’s hands trembled, not from fear but the weight of balance—his wife’s voice murmuring approval as he realigned the magnifying glass, directing the wind’s keening wail to stitch the rift. <words>217</words>  
He’d spent decades preserving what others dismissed as myth, digging graves not for bodies but for memory, each burial a vow to kindrelize time itself, to let the old gods breathe through the cracks in their concrete tomb. <words>247</words>  
A final gust tore through the fence, carrying the scent of copal incense and diesel. The rift sealed with a thunderclap, leaving the temple half-submerged in reality, its stones now veined with both ancient carvings and subway maps. <words>276</words>  
The gravedigger collapsed, the magnifying glass shattering beside him, its fragments catching the dawn—a kaleidoscope of endings and beginnings, worlds overlapping in the fragile hush of what came next. <words>303</words>  
He smiled, blood on his lips, knowing the ritual had held. The dead would walk a little longer. The living would dream a little deeper. And the wind, relentless and wise, would keep its secrets. <words>333</words>
