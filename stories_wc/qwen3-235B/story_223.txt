<story>  
Captain Elias Vorne clutched the rail of his storm-battered skiff, his stomach churning in rhythm with the waves, though the sea had stilled hours ago—a cruel irony for a naval officer whose legacy was seasickness. <words>28</words>  
The map’s ink had faded across centuries, but the rainbow canyon’s prismatic cliffs still glimmered ahead, guiding him to the crystal fortress whispered about in smugglers’ taverns and half-forgotten myths. <words>54</words>  
He sought the translucent ghost orchid bulb, a seed of legend said to bloom only when its keeper traded a secret darker than the void between stars—a bargain Elias had rehearsed in his head since boyhood. <words>85</words>  
Awkwardly charming, as his mother used to sigh, he’d charmed a portly alchemist into revealing the bulb’s lunar dependency: transform it under the correct moon phase, and it would unlock the fortress’s mirror chamber. <words>115</words>  
Now, under a waning gibbous, Elias knelt in the canyon’s glassy soil, burying the bulb as the moon’s light fractured into prisms above him, its phases tracked in his weathered journal—each entry a confession. <words>147</words>  
The fortress doors groaned open at dawn, revealing a hall of mirrors that hummed with the weight of unspoken truths, each pane reflecting not faces, but fractured *selves*: choices unmade, lives unlived. <words>176</words>  
Elias approached the central mirror, its surface rippling like water, the bulb now a glowing seedling in his pocket—his secret trembling on his tongue, the price of confronting the lie he’d nursed for centuries. <words>206</words>  
“I traded my brother’s grave,” he whispered, voice breaking, “for a map to this place. I’ve sailed every horizon to outrun his ghost… but you already knew that, didn’t you?” <words>236</words>  
The mirror smiled, a grotesque mimicry of his own face, and began to warp, revealing his brother’s visage—alive, unburdened, laughing in a world where Elias had drowned instead. <words>264</words>  
Defiance surged through him, nostalgic and sharp; he pressed the sprouted orchid to the glass, its roots threading like veins into the mirror’s heart, unraveling the illusion’s grip. <words>292</words>  
Light exploded, the fortress trembling as the rainbow canyon outside pulsed in resonance, the bulb’s transformation complete—a key, a cure, a requiem. <words>317</words>  
When the glow faded, Elias saw only himself: weathered, seasick, *alive*, the mirror’s silence finally honest, its lies spent in the face of his own. <words>344</words>  
He lingered, fingertips brushing the glass, wondering if his brother’s ghost had ever truly been here—or if it had been waiting, all these centuries, for Elias to set them both free. <words>373</words>  
As moonlight shifted outside, the fortress doors sealed behind him, the orchid bulb now a wilted husk in his palm—a relic of secrets traded, of transformations earned, of a longing finally still. <words>402</words>  
Captain Vorne walked into the canyon’s kaleidoscope, his shadow stretching eastward, toward the sea he would never love, but endure—for the first time, without shame. <words>430</words>
