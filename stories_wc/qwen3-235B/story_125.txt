<story>  
The underachieving mage, Kael, slumped in the cracked command chair of the abandoned space station control room, their boots propped on a console that once guided interstellar freighters but now hosted a single misdelivered package—a padded envelope addressed to someone else, smeared with iridescent ink that glowed faintly under the flickering emergency lights. <words>47</words>  
Inside the envelope was a doll head with blinking eyes, its porcelain face frozen in a serene smile that seemed to mock Kael’s own stagnation; they’d spent years failing to conjure even basic hexes, let alone live up to their ancestors’ legacy of celestial cartographers who mapped magical ley lines across galaxies. <words>94</words>  
The doll’s eyes snapped open, pupils contracting like camera shutters, and Kael felt a pulse of warmth in their palm—a sensation both foreign and familiar, as though the artifact had recognized something dormant within them, something the mage had long dismissed as irretrievably lost. <words>137</words>  
A holographic map materialized above the doll’s head, its coordinates aligning with the farmland bordering the space station, land slated for auction to corporate developers who’d strip it for resources, erasing the last physical traces of Kael’s familial claims. <words>177</words>  
Bored excitement prickled Kael’s spine; they’d always hated the weight of expectation, but the doll’s “exceptionally usual” craftsmanship—a paradoxical blend of mass-produced plastic and hand-carved runes—hinted at a deeper design, one that demanded participation rather than passive observation. <words>217</words>  
They activated the station’s rusted teleporter array using the doll’s blinking rhythm as a cipher, the machine whirring to life with a groan that shook decades of dust from the walls, and stepped onto the pad, clutching the artifact like a compass. <words>257</words>  
The farmland materialized around them, golden wheat swaying under twin moons, but the trap wasn’t for enemies—it was for Kael themself, a ritual encoded in the doll’s programming to force a confrontation with the mage’s self-imposed limits. <words>300</words>  
As the doll’s eyes synchronized with the ley lines beneath the soil, Kael’s vision flooded with ancestral memories: their great-grandmother weaving starlight into crop-circle spells, their father’s final, desperate attempt to shield the land before vanishing in a botched counterspell. <words>343</words>  
The misdelivered package had been a test; the true heirloom wasn’t the doll but the realization that Kael’s “underachievement” was a shield against grief, a way to avoid failing as spectacularly as their family had before them. <words>386</words>  
With a shuddering breath, they pressed the doll into the earth, its eyes flaring as the ground erupted in luminous glyphs, and the station’s AI—long dormant—beamed a final message: “Heritage reclaimed. New directives: grow.” <words>429</words>  
The developers would arrive at dawn, but Kael stood rooted, the wheat now towering into fractal patterns only they could decipher, their boredom replaced by a quiet, electric purpose—the trap had sprung, and they were finally, fiercely awake. <words>472</words>
