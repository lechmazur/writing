<story>  
The aged minstrel perched on a gnarled mushroom stump at the village’s edge, his lute humming a dissonant prelude as twilight seeped into the mushroom spires. <words>19</words>  
His audience—a cluster of villagers clutching lanterns shaped like toadstools—leaned closer, drawn by the innocently mischievous glint in his rheumy eyes, a spark that belied his cracked voice and trembling hands. <words>40</words>  
“Each night,” he began, gesturing to the empty birdcage swaying above the crossroads, “the sign’s chipped paint tells a tale truer than our elders’ hymns.” <words>63</words>  
The cage, once gilt and brimming with songbirds released at the autumn equinox, now hung barren—a relic of the tradition ending at this intersection, where the old road to the fungal groves met the new stone highway. <words>97</words>  
He plucked a string, sharp as a cicada’s cry, and compared the sign’s flaking crimson letters to the village’s unraveling myth: “See how the ‘M’ sloughs off? Like the mayor’s lies about the harvest’s blight.” <words>127</words>  
The villagers murmured; they’d come to hear ballads, not blasphemy, yet none turned away, their faces half-illuminated by the bioluminescent moss he’d once sung into bloom. <words>153</words>  
“Fifty years past,” he rasped, “this cage held the Skyward Thrush, whose feathers lit our winters—until we learned it fed on forbidden knowledge, stolen from the mountain’s heart.” <words>182</words>  
His fingers danced, weaving a melody that prickled the air like spores, as he explained how the bird’s extinction mirrored their own crumbling illusions: the fertile soil now dust, the council’s hollow chants, the lie that ignorance could sustain magic. <words>217</words>  
A child pointed: the sign’s “E” had flaked into an “F,” and the minstrel laughed, a sound like wind through dead reeds. “Even the letters rebel!” he crowed, his mischief sharpening to a dagger’s edge. <words>245</words>  
They knew then why he’d returned from his self-exile—to pry open their gilded cage of complacency, to trade their fading hymns for truths as bitter as the wild caps he’d once bartered. <words>273</words>  
When the mayor’s son hurled a stone at the birdcage, shattering its hinge, the minstrel’s song swelled into a dirge, feral and elegant, stitching the village’s past to its unwritten dawn. <words>302</words>  
“The tradition dies not with a scream,” he intoned, “but with each chip of paint, each unasked question—until only the cage remains, and we forget why we fear its opening.” <words>332</words>  
The villagers dispersed, their lanterns guttering, leaving him alone with the sign’s skeletal letters and the weight of forbidden knowledge: that the thrush had never been a savior, but a thief, and its stolen fire had always demanded a price. <words>368</words>  
He pocketed a flake of crimson paint, its edges sharp as a vow, and vanished into the night’s fungal haze, his shadow stretching long as the road ahead—where tradition ended, and reckoning began. <words>400</words>  
The cage swung empty, the sign now read “FALL,” and the mushrooms, ever patient, inched their mycelium toward the secrets buried beneath the crossroads. <words>424</words>
