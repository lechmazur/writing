Lira soaked in the bubble bath, her calloused dancer’s feet pricking the water’s surface as the thought experiment chamber hummed around her. <words>17</words>  
The patch from the *Aetheris* crash—frayed, scorched, and stitched with her grandmother’s trembling hands—lay on the tile beside her, a relic of denial she refused to examine too closely. <words>40</words>  
Her family’s tradition of yearly photos hung in a warped timeline on the chamber’s walls, each generation grinning in identical poses, their smiles as rigid as the lies binding them to the prophecy. <words>64</words>  
Lira had mimicked those smiles since childhood, her sharp wit carving sarcasm into every “say cheese,” but the bath’s steam blurred the images now, softening their edges into ghosts. <words>90</words>  
The prophecy demanded she decode the *Aetheris*’s final transmission—a linguistically inept task, given the ship’s logs were scrawled in seven alien dialects she’d never studied. <words>114</words>  
Yet here she was, a dancer who spoke in pirouettes and eye-rolls, clutching a dead astronaut’s patch, pretending she could parse the screams of a dying starship. <words>139</words>  
Her grandmother had called it “the family’s sacred work,” but Lira knew better: they were archivists of avoidance, preserving the myth of the *Aetheris*’s “noble end” while burying the truth—their own ancestor’s error. <words>173</words>  
The chamber’s AI pulsed, projecting holograms of the crash site—a jagged crater where the ship’s black box whispered in loops, its voice a mimicry of calm. <words>198</words>  
Lira submerged herself, bubbles clinging to her ears as she replayed the family photos in her mind: her mother’s strained laugh, her father’s averted gaze, all of them performing normalcy. <words>224</words>  
Denial had weight, she thought, like water pressure on eardrums. It built until you mistook silence for speech, lies for legacy. <words>245</words>  
She surfaced, gasping, and snatched the patch. Its threads unraveled, revealing a microchip sewn beneath the fabric—a key, not to the prophecy, but to the *Aetheris*’s true last moments. <words>273</words>  
The AI flickered. “Initiate playback?” it intoned. Lira nodded, her throat tight. The chamber dissolved into the ship’s bridge, alarms blaring. <words>296</words>  
A voice erupted—her ancestor’s, frantic, confessing: “We ignored the fault lines. We *knew*. Tell Earth… tell them we lied.” <words>315</words>  
The hologram faded. Lira stared at the family photos, their smiles now grotesque. The prophecy wasn’t about redemption; it was a plea for absolution she couldn’t grant. <words>341</words>  
She mimicked the transmission’s cadence, feeding the AI new commands until it projected a final image: the *Aetheris* memorial, its plaque listing the dead. Her ancestor’s name glowed last. <words>368</words>  
The chamber’s walls dissolved. Outside, dawn bled through the observatory windows. Lira stepped out, dripping, and tore the first photo from the wall—the one where denial began. <words>395</words>  
She lit the patch on fire, its ashes swirling like a galaxy, and for the first time, the family tradition bent: no smile, no pose, only truth. <words>418</words>  
The prophecy’s twist? To fulfill it, she had to erase it. <words>427</words>
