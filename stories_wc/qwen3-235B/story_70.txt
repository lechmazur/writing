The witch’s greenhouse clung to the hill of gravestones like a barnacle to a shipwreck, its glass panes fogged with secrets. <words>17</words> Elias, the uptight scribe, adjusted his spectacles and traced a gloved finger along the spine of a half-buried ledger, his posture rigid as a tombstone. <words>34</words> He’d come to analyze the adhesive residue on a century-old envelope—its gum arabic laced with iron filings, a clue to a cipher only Tesla himself might’ve unraveled. <words>52</words> But the greenhouse breathed defiance: vines hissed, soil shifted, and the air hummed with the *certainly uncertain* weight of something alive. <words>67</words>  

Beneath a tangle of widow’s tears, he found it—a prototype light bulb, its filament coiled like a dormant serpent. <words>82</words> Tesla’s mark glinted faintly, a sigil of forgotten genius. <words>89</words> Elias’s pulse quickened, though he scolded himself for the thrill; sentiment was a leak in the hull of reason. <words>104</words> Yet here, in the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, his fingers trembled. <words>116</words> The bulb’s glow, he deduced, wasn’t mere light—it was memory, distilled. <words>126</words>  

He prised open the envelope’s brittle remains, scraping adhesive into a vial. <words>137</words> The residue reacted to the bulb’s aura, swirling into a hologram of Tesla’s notes: *“Empathy is the current that tempers steel.”* <words>152</words> Elias bellowed—a sound too raw for his usual lexicon—as the greenhouse erupted in spectral bloom. <words>166</words> Gravestones below shuddered; roots curled upward, cradling the glass like a lung. <words>180</words>  

The transformation was quiet, insidious. <words>188</words> Vines softened into threads of gold, weaving a cocoon around the bulb. <words>199</words> Elias’s rigidity cracked; he knelt, letting soil stain his cuffs, and *felt*—not documented—the ache of the dead, the hunger of the living. <words>217</words> The witch who’d built this place had sealed her sorrow in wax; Tesla’s invention had been meant to transmute it. <words>234</words>  

He cradled the bulb, its warmth seeping into his arms of steel, and wept. <words>247</words> Not for the puzzle solved, but for the gravestones’ unspoken names, the greenhouse’s lonely vigil. <words>262</words> Empathy, he realized, wasn’t weakness—it was the current that made the light *matter*. <words>277</words>  

When dawn came, the hill was no longer a graveyard but a garden, its blooms drinking the last of the bulb’s radiance. <words>294</words> Elias left the ledger behind. <words>301</words> His notes now fit a new spine: one bound in moss and mercy. <words>313</words>  

The world remained fractured, certainly uncertain. <words>324</words> But in his chest, a quiet transformation pulsed—a filament glowing, unseen, in the dark. <words>338</words>  

He walked away, shoulders still straight, but steps lighter. <words>349</words> The greenhouse whispered behind him, its optimism buried but alive. <words>361</words>  

The bulb’s final flicker lit his path, a silent requiem for the rigid man he’d been. <words>376</words>  

He did not look back. <words>383</words>  

The gravestones, however, did. <words>391</words>  

And the witch’s vines curled, waiting for the next scribe who might listen. <words>404</words>  

The world, Elias now knew, was not solved—it was soothed. <words>415</words>  

A quiet transformation, after all, was still a revolution. <words>426</words>  

He carried Tesla’s bulb like a child, like a promise, into the uncharted dusk. <words>440</words>
