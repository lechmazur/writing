<story>  
The understudy sorcerer, dripping wet from a botched laundry-cycle teleportation, tiptoed through the salt crystal growing chamber, their boots crunching on halite shards that glittered like shattered teeth. <words>19</words>  
They clutched a small cardboard box—the last relic of their mentor’s vanished luggage—to their chest, humming a lullaby to its unseen contents, a habit born of obnoxiously polite desperation to soothe whatever ancient grudge the oak grove’s whispers had nursed into the walls. <words>45</words>  
The box vibrated faintly, harmonizing with the grove’s murmurs, which seeped through the chamber’s vents like steam from a teakettle left boiling too long. <words>61</words>  
“You there, fungoid mold spore!” the sorcerer trilled, cornering a patch of wall where the whispers crescendoed, their voice a singsong hindrance to the grove’s attempts to rouse the slumbering salt spirits. <words>85</words>  
The oak’s grievances—centuries of forgotten rituals, sapling graves paved for parking lots—flooded the room, dissolving into a hiss as the sorcerer upended the box, releasing a swarm of origami earwigs to eavesdrop on the grove’s grievances. <words>113</words>  
Each insect clicked its mandibles, transcribing dialects of rot and resilience, data points for the sorcerer’s clandestine thesis on cultural evolution’s toll on arboreal afterlives. <words>136</words>  
A crystal pillar shuddered, refracting the earwigs’ findings into prismatic glyphs that spelled *RUN* in six extinct scripts. <words>148</words>  
“Oh, bother,” the sorcerer chirped, sidestepping a root that burst through the floor, its bark etched with the same glyphs—a reply, perhaps, to the grove’s plea to wake the unheard. <words>171</words>  
They curtsied to the root, a reflexive obeisance to hierarchy, even when faced with a sentient plant hellbent on reclaiming its mythos. <words>187</words>  
The laundry cycle dinged in the distance, a mundane anchor as the chamber flooded with amber sap, the grove’s lifeforce pooling into a moat around the sorcerer’s ankles. <words>208</words>  
The box dissolved, its glue no match for the deluge, freeing a vial of fermented acorn coffee—a beverage of necromantic potency—the sorcerer hurled into the sap, chanting a lullaby in Proto-Indo-European. <words>234</words>  
The grove’s whispers faltered, then dissolved into a collective snore, the spirits pacified by the bitter aroma of their own caffeinated past. <words>254</words>  
Salt crystals bloomed like fireworks, encoding the night’s absurdity into their lattice—a testament to the cost of progress, the weight of politeness, and the peril of leaving oak groves on read. <words>279</words>  
The sorcerer wrung out their robes, pocketed a glowing glyph-flecked earwig, and waltzed into the laundry steam, already drafting a sonnet to the cultural evolution of arboreal midlife crises. <words>303</words>  
Their footsteps echoed, obnoxiously cheerful, as the chamber’s lights dimmed, leaving only the sap-moat’s phosphorescent shimmer to guard the now-drowsy revolt. <words>325</words>  
Somewhere, a tree rolled over in its sleep, dreaming of uprooting the next sorcerer who dared equate politeness with penance. <words>343</words>  
The laundry cycle spun on, indifferent. <words>351</words>
