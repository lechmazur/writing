The lonely ringleader twirled the stained napkin between calloused fingers, its crimson blotches whispering secrets only he could hear. <words>12</words>  
Behind the cracked velvet curtain of the ghost story recording booth, he waited for the next confession, his shadow flickering like a trapped moth. <words>21</words>  
The napkin—his grandmother’s, soaked in wine and warnings—had guided him here, to this nexus of forgotten souls and flickering Edison bulbs. <words>32</words>  
“Guard the artifact,” she’d rasped, her breath a moth-wing against his ear, “or the hunger between stories will swallow us all.” <words>44</words>  
He’d laughed then, a sharp, individual bark, but the laughter died quick in the booth’s damp air, leaving only the hum of ancestral wisdom he couldn’t outrun. <words>57</words>  
The artifact sat now on the moth-eaten stool beside him: a glass sphere, its core a flame that danced in zero gravity, defying every law but its own. <words>70</words>  
Its light painted the walls with spectral hieroglyphs, a language older than the carnival’s rusted gates, older than the ringleader’s guilt. <words>81</words>  
When the first confession slithered through the slot—a child’s trembling voice admitting she’d stolen a locket—the flame flared indigo. <words>93</words>  
He knew then the artifact fed on truth, and the booth was its hunting ground, the whispered confessions its lure. <words>104</words>  
But tonight, the hunger outside the stories had come early. <words>110</words>  
A figure materialized in the booth’s fractured mirror, its form a smudge of ash and articulated dread, eyes like collapsed stars. <words>122</words>  
The ringleader didn’t flinch. He’d outmaneuvered worse with a deck of marked cards and a smile sharper than broken glass. <words>133</words>  
“Confession?” he asked, voice a velvet sneer, tossing the napkin over his shoulder like a matador’s cape. <words>142</words>  
The thing hissed, its jaw unhinging into a carousel of teeth, and lunged—not for him, but the flame. <words>152</words>  
He moved on instinct, snatching the napkin mid-air and snapping it like a whip; the crimson stains bloomed into sigils, ancestral glyphs that seared the creature’s flesh. <words>167</words>  
It recoiled, howling a sound like static through a crypt, and the ringleader laughed, low and feral. <words>177</words>  
“Dance, then,” he murmured, hurling the napkin into the flame. <words>184</words>  
The fire erupted in a zero-gravity waltz, ribbons of gold and violet spiraling around them, weaving a cage of light. <words>194</words>  
The creature thrashed, ensnared by the flame’s choreography—a ritual older than fear itself, older than the carnival’s rot. <words>205</words>  
As the last confession of the night slunk in—a widow admitting she’d loved her husband’s ghost—the flame devoured the thing whole, its ashes raining like confetti. <words>219</words>  
The ringleader caught a flake on his tongue, bitter and electric, and sighed. <words>227</words>  
The booth trembled, the artifact humming a lullaby in a language he almost understood. <words>235</words>  
He refolded the napkin, its stains darker now, heavier. <words>241</words>  
Loneliness clung to him again, a second skin, as he realized the artifact’s hunger would never sleep—and neither would he. <words>253</words>  
Outside, the carnival lights blinked like tired eyes, and the ringleader waited, stitching his smile back on with phantom thread. <words>264</words>  
Another confession slid through. <words>268</words>  
The flame danced on. <words>272</words>
