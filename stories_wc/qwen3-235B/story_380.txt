<story>  
The convicted dream thief crouched in the forgotten library inside the treehouse, its rotting oak beams humming with the weight of unspoken histories. <words>17</words>  
A flimsy photo album trembled in their hands, its pages blooming with stolen fragments: a child’s first steps, a lover’s whispered name, the scent of rain on asphalt—all memories they’d siphoned to quiet their own fragmented self. <words>43</words>  
They were mathematically challenged, a flaw that haunted them like a ghost they couldn’t name, but the album’s chaos soothed them; here, equations dissolved into something softer, something they could almost grasp. <words>70</words>  
Outside, the sky hung empty, a gray smear that had not thundered since the last human was born—a brittle, silent era that fed their quiet mania. <words>95</words>  
They had to coax the storm back. They had to. <words>104</words>  
The thief plunged a hand into a hollow beneath the floorboards, retrieving a rusted compass and a moth-eaten map of the town’s abandoned cricket pitch, a place where they’d once shared a love for the sport with someone whose face now blurred in the album’s margins. <words>140</words>  
Cricket had been their bridge to normalcy, the swing of the bat a parabola they’d never calculated, the rhythm of the game a language their mind could parse without numbers. <words>167</words>  
Now, they traced the map’s frayed edges, recalling how their friend had laughed at their inability to keep score, how they’d said, “It’s just physics and poetry, isn’t it?” <words>194</words>  
The thief’s breath hitched. Physics and poetry. Thunder. <words>204</words>  
They climbed down the treehouse ladder, the album clutched to their chest, and trekked to the pitch, where the earth still bore the scars of their childhood games. <words>227</words>  
At the center, they plunged the compass into the soil, its needle spinning wildly before settling northward, toward the stormless horizon. <words>247</words>  
The thief knelt, arranging photos around the compass like an offering: a wicket falling, a ball arcing mid-air, their friend’s grin mid-swing. <words>267</words>  
They began to chant the game’s old rhythms, the cadence of bat on ball, the math of motion stripped to its primal core—a formula of longing, not logic. <words>292</words>  
The air thickened. The thief tore a page from the album—their own stolen memory of a thunderclap, hoarded years ago—and let the wind carry it skyward. <words>318</words>  
Clouds coagulated, bruise-dark and trembling. <words>327</words>  
A single rumble growled. The thief’s fragmented self seemed to knit, just briefly, into something whole. <words>344</words>  
But the sky withheld its rain. <words>353</words>  
They screamed, hurling the compass into the dirt, their quiet mania erupting into a storm of its own. <words>368</words>  
When silence reclaimed the field, the thief collapsed, clutching the album to their ribs. <words>382</words>  
The thunder had not returned. But the compass needle still quivered, pointing not north, but downward. <words>399</words>  
Beneath them, the earth whispered of buried things: roots, memories, the bones of a world that once knew how to roar. <words>419</words>  
The thief smiled, their fingers digging into the soil. There was still a way to plunge deeper. <words>434</words>  
They would unravel the ground itself if they had to. <words>446</words>  
They would make the sky remember. <words>455</words>
