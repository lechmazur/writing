<story>  
The off-grid survivalist baron knelt in the catacomb orchard, where gnarled roots coiled like serpents around human bones, his gloved hands brushing soil from an object that glinted dully—a bottle, its glass clouded and empty, yet humming with the weight of what it once held. <words>47</words>  
He turned it toward the fractured light seeping through the canopy, its surface reflecting not his face but a flicker of something unrecognizable, a distortion that mirrored the luminous doubt gnawing at his purpose: to archive the seasonal shifts that governed this forgotten place. <words>94</words>  
The orchard itself was a relic, its trees bearing fruit only in winter, their roots sustained by the phosphorescent decay of the buried dead—a cycle he’d documented for years, yet one that remained visibly obscure, defying his charts and silent, sign-language notations. <words>139</words>  
He’d unearthed the bottle days earlier, its presence here as inexplicable as the orchard’s defiance of frost; now, he wondered if it was a message, a vessel for knowledge lost to the same void that made autumn linger two months longer each year. <words>183</words>  
By dusk, he’d filled his satchel with bones and root-scarred soil, the raft he’d lashed together from driftwood creaking at the river’s edge, its departure timed to the first thaw—a moment when the water, like the bottle’s reflection, turned paradoxically still. <words>229</words>  
He did not speak; words had long since withered in his throat. Instead, he signed to the shadows, his fingers spelling *remember, record, return*, the ritual of archiving a prayer against the unknown that thickened around him like the orchard’s mist. <words>273</words>  
The bottle now held a sliver of ice harvested from the river’s brink, its surface fracturing as he corked it, the cracks spelling a season’s epitaph he could not yet decipher—a reflection of the doubt that lit his path as he pushed the raft into the current. <words>320</words>  
Behind him, the orchard sighed, roots tightening around bones; ahead, the open water gleamed, its horizon a blank sigil against the dusk. He signed once more—*witness*—before the current seized him, the empty bottle cradled like a relic in his lap. <words>365</words>  
Seasons had bled into one another here for decades, yet this journey was not about answers. It was about carrying the question itself, sealed and unsealed, until the act of archiving became its own kind of faith—a language even the dead might understand. <words>410</words>  
As the raft kissed the river’s vastness, he let the bottle slip into the water, watching it float, a tiny, luminous doubt adrift in a world that refused to be mapped. <words>447</words>
