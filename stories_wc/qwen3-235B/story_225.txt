The wayward apothecary hunched over the brass railing of the *Nautilus Revenant*’s observation deck, her dry highlighter pen flickering like a dying firefly as she charted the phosphorescent trails of migratory butterflies spiraling through the abyssal dark. <words>28</words>  
The submarine groaned around her, its riveted hull a battered marvel of steam-age defiance, much like the crew who manned it—outcasts navigating the lawless waters between broken treaties. <words>53</words>  
She’d stolen the pen years ago from a Royal Society envoy who’d called her “unjustly fair,” a paradox she’d since weaponized; the inkless tool now decoded bioluminescent patterns in the butterflies’ wings, a cipher for antidotes to diseases no nation would let her cure. <words>89</words>  
Tonight, though, the pen trembled autonomously, its tip vibrating in Morse code—a signal infecting the sub’s telegraph system, siphoned through seawater and static to hum *come closer* in the apothecary’s ear. <words>122</words>  
She should’ve ignored it. But the butterflies veered sharply, their dance fracturing into chaos, and she knew: someone had weaponized the very frequencies she loved, twisting migration into a massacre. <words>154</words>  
The pen scrawled warnings on her gloved palm—*they’re listening*—as she rerouted the sub’s steam vents to amplify the signal, her hands steady despite the tremor in her ribs. <words>185</words>  
Captain Voss found her there, his coat singed from engine-room fires, and didn’t ask why she’d infected the navigation console with her alchemical schematics; he just handed her a vial of liquid amber—the last of their leviathan repellent—to fuel her obsession. <words>223</words>  
“You’re a fool to chase beauty in a world that only rewards rot,” he muttered, but his smile was a cracked gear, stubbornly turning. <words>249</words>  
The apothecary didn’t answer. She was too busy translating the signal’s poison: a manifesto from a rival apothecary, once her lover, now a zealot who believed eradicating the butterflies would “cure” humanity’s greed. <words>283</words>  
The pen burned hot, etching her resolve. She’d loved him too conventionally, once—trusting treaties over truths—until the butterflies taught her love was a verb, not a vow. <words>314</words>  
She jammed the pen into the console, overloading its circuits to broadcast a counter-frequency: a harmonic scream of whale songs and wingbeats, a lullaby for insects and rebels. <words>345</words>  
The sub shuddered as the signal erupted, scattering the swarm into a kaleidoscope that blinded the enemy’s sonar. Voss roared approval, firing ballast to dive deeper, while the apothecary collapsed, her gloves smoking. <words>378</words>  
“You’re mad,” he said, but tossed her a fresh vial—his last—because madness, like fairness, was a matter of optics. <words>401</words>  
The pen lay dormant now, its duty done. Above them, the butterflies resumed their pilgrimage, stitching the dark with threads of purpose. The apothecary smiled. This was love: imperfect, urgent, alive. <words>436</words>  
The *Nautilus Revenant* sailed onward, a battered marvel in waters where treaties died, carrying a woman who’d chosen the world over its rulers—and the fragile, furious light of what endured. <words>470</words>
