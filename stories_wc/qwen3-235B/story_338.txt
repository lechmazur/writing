<story>  
The zany artificer crouched in the subterranean gloom, their goggles askew as they welded a cracked phone case to the receiver of a rotary phone, the tunnels’ damp air humming with static. <words>22</words>  
Time had folded here, spitting expired calendars and flickering fluorescents into the labyrinth, leaving the artificer to scavenge relics to mend what shouldn’t work—and yet did. <words>44</words>  
They’d named the contraption “Mr. Dial-Up,” a joke lost on the rats, though the machine’s incomplete call logs now hissed with voices from elsewhere: *“—left the soup on—”* *“—never trusted the east tunnel—”* *“—find beauty—”* <words>77</words>  
Detached, as always, the artificer noted the timestamps—yesterday, tomorrow, never—scribbling equations on tunnel walls to map the fractures. <words>94</words>  
Stereotypes demanded they be a mad tinkerer, all chaos and no depth, but their mind was a vault of precision, each weld a rebuttal to the world that’d dismissed them. <words>120</words>  
A log snippet crackled through: *“—the exit’s in the mundane—”* followed by a dial tone that vibrated like a heartbeat. <words>137</words>  
They’d spent cycles chasing beauty in brass fittings and bioluminescent mold, but the phrase gnawed—what if the answer wasn’t in the *invented* but the *overlooked*? <words>164</words>  
Tearing Mr. Dial-Up apart, they fused the cracked case to a prism of salvaged glass, the rotary phone’s cord spiraling into a conduit humming with fractured time. <words>189</words>  
Light refracted through the case’s hairline splits, projecting holograms of subway tiles blooming into stained glass, rats morphing into constellations, the tunnels breathing. <words>214</words>  
The artificer laughed, sharp and startled—a sound that belonged to neither past nor future—as the logs informed them of a final collapse at 3:07. <words>236</words>  
They didn’t flee. Instead, they danced, kicking through debris as eras collided: Victorian boots, disco sequins, nanotech dust clinging to their coat. <words>257</words>  
At 3:06, the collapse began—a scream of metal—until the prism flared, the cracked case directing light into the rift, stitching time with threads of *ordinary things*. <words>283</words>  
Silence. Then, a dial tone. *“—Told you soup was the answer—”* the log whispered, as the artificer touched their goggles, eyes wet with the mundane, the miraculous. <words>310</words>  
They stayed, cataloging echoes, their detachment now a bridge between what was, is, and could never be, the tunnels no longer empty but abundant. <words>336</words>  
When new wanderers stumbled in, they found murals of cracked phone cases and rotary dials, the artificer’s voice on answering machines: *“Break the lens. See.”* <words>362</words>  
Stereotypes, like time, were fragile. The mundane, like light, only needed the right fracture to become infinite. <words>383</words>
