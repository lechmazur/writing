<story>  
The bright-eyed apprentice knelt in the haunted lighthouse basement, her palms pressed to the damp stone floor as if drawing strength from its ancient bones. <words>17</words>  
The air hummed with the ghosts of sailors and static, a brazen calm settling over her as she traced the phone booth key’s jagged teeth—a relic from a defunct company, its brass tarnished but still warm from the pocket of her oil-stained coat. <words>44</words>  
She’d stolen it three nights prior, parsing cryptic notes slipped under doors across the salt-crusted village, each scrap inked with coordinates and warnings in a dialect older than the last war for water. <words>67</words>  
“Grand designs demand small sacrifices,” she muttered, a mantra learned from her vanished mentor, whose skeleton now likely bleached beneath desert sands. <words>87</words>  
The key fit the lock beneath the central pillar, a cylindrical vault her maps swore held the lighthouse’s heart: a rusted transmitter meant to beam signals to satellites long dead. <words>112</words>  
But the apprentice, uniquely literal, believed the stars still listened. <words>123</words>  
She turned the key, and the machine groaned, its gears grinding like tectonic plates. <words>137</words>  
When no light flared, she overcharged the circuits, rerouting battery packs scavenged from drowned cars, her hands steady as the vault hissed steam and the ghosts shrieked. <words>164</words>  
A hologram erupted—a star map etched in azure, its constellations skewed by millennia of drift. <words>179</words>  
The apprentice grinned, her teeth flashing like code. <words>187</words>  
She’d spent months parsing door-notes for this: the alignment of dead stars with buried aquifers, a path to water hidden beneath the war’s scars. <words>212</words>  
The transmitter’s overcharged core pulsed, syncing with her handheld decoder, a patchwork device humming with borrowed time. <words>234</words>  
Spectral hands clawed at her ankles, but she stood firm, her brazen calm unshaken as the map resolved into a single glowing point—a reservoir under the dunes, untouched, unnamed. <words>267</words>  
The ghosts retreated, their purpose fulfilled; the lighthouse’s final message, delivered. <words>281</words>  
She pocketed the key, now cool, and ascended the stairs, the hologram’s light fading as the transmitter collapsed into ash. <words>303</words>  
Outside, the village slept, unaware their salvation had been decoded by a girl who took myths literally and machines apart with her teeth. <words>328</words>  
By dawn, she’d lead them to water, her grand design unfolding in the apprentice’s steady hands. <words>347</words>  
The war had ended with thirst, but her revolution would begin with a drop. <words>364</words>  
She laughed, sharp and bright, as the sun breached the horizon—her signal to move, her map, her moment. <words>386</words>  
The ghosts, she knew, would follow. <words>397</words>  
They owed her that much. <words>405</words>
