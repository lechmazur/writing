<story>  
The cunning connoisseur of forgotten botany, Elara Voss, paused mid-aisle at the grocery store, her cart half-full of kale and cryptic seed packets she’d swiped from the discount bin. <words>22</words>  
She’d spent years decoding the forgotten languages of heirloom flora, but the faded symbols on these vintage packets—crimson-stamped with a smoke signal tower motif—itched at her like a riddle she’d never heard but somehow knew. <words>49</words>  
A sudden urge to explore a path not taken gripped her, sharp and chemical, as if the tower itself were whispering through the plastic produce bags. <words>67</words>  
She abandoned her groceries, left a trail of crushed thyme beneath her boots, and drove to the outskirts of town, where the derelict smoke signal tower loomed, its iron ribs rusted but defiant. <words>92</words>  
Inside, she found a xerograph machine, humming faintly in the dust—a relic from the 1970s, its glass plate smeared with pollen and desperation. <words>113</words>  
She fed the seed packets into the machine, their ink bleeding into copies that revealed coordinates, soil pH levels, and a single phrase: “To corner an elusive destiny, plant where the earth remembers.” <words>144</words>  
Elara’s hands trembled, not from fear but the thrill of morally ambiguous purpose; she’d traded her grandmother’s wedding ring for seeds once, and this felt like that—sharp, necessary, a little cruel. <words>173</words>  
The coordinates led her to a vacant lot downtown, where she scattered the seeds in a grid pattern, her movements precise as a gambler placing bets. <words>197</words>  
By dawn, sprouts pierced the asphalt, their leaves shimmering with a bioluminescence that cast the tower in a spectral glow—a gentle chaos of growth and ruin. <words>223</words>  
Reporters came, then officials, then crowds clutching grocery-store seed packets, demanding answers as vines swallowed street signs and lampposts. <words>247</words>  
Elara watched from the tower, her xerograph copies now a mosaic on the walls, and wondered if destiny was ever a thing to be cornered—or if it was always the quiet, relentless thing doing the hunting. <words>278</words>  
The city sued her; the world called her a savior. <words>288</words>  
She kept planting, kept decoding, kept lying about the soil’s pH, because the truth was too tangled to explain: the seeds weren’t meant for this age, and the tower’s smoke signals had never stopped burning, just waiting for someone hungry enough to breathe them in. <words>327</words>  
When the first flower bloomed—a midnight-blue orchid that hummed in F-sharp—Elara smiled, her fingers stained green with pollen and ink, and finally felt the weight of a destiny not her own settle into her bones. <words>362</words>  
The connoisseur had become the consumed, the forgotten now fiercely remembered, and in that exchange, the world tilted, gently, into the chaos it had always deserved. <words>394</words>  
She never returned to the grocery store, though sometimes, on windless nights, you could see her silhouette in the tower window, xerograph copies fluttering like trapped moths, her hands sowing the next impossible thing. <words>427</words>  
The kale, meanwhile, rotted in the abandoned cart, a footnote in the kind of story that grows wilder with every retelling. <words>449</words>
