<story>  
The shipwrecked merchant stood on the space station observation deck, her boots magnetized to the grated floor as she stared at the dead Earth through cracked glass. <words>22</words>  
The last tree had fallen centuries ago, its demise broadcast on flickering screens now repurposed to show ads for luxury escape pods. <words>37</words>  
She clutched the rustic butter churn—a relic from her homeworld’s agrarian past—its dents and rust whispering of hands that once shaped butter into sustenance, not art. <words>60</words>  
The station groaned around her, a ghost of its former self, its corridors haunted by the flaking edges of travel posters promising “Venusian Beaches” and “Lunar Vineyards.” <words>84</words>  
She’d arrived via a smuggled escape pod, her cargo hold filled with stolen reactor parts, but her true motive was etched into the churn’s base: a map to the station’s core. <words>111</words>  
The grand illusion—the lie that survival required obedience—could only be shattered by hands both honest and strange, a paradox she embodied. <words>136</words>  
Aloof passion guided her now; she didn’t crave revolution, but the universe had tied her fate to rebellious sparks, those flickering embers in the station’s underbelly who whispered her name. <words>165</words>  
Ascending meant navigating the poster-peeled shafts where light failed, gripping edges that crumbled like dried soil, her churn clanking against her thigh like a pilgrim’s bell. <words>194</words>  
The method was absurd: a butter churn as a key, its worn handle fitting into a slot beneath a “Safari Mars” poster’s flaking lion. <words>214</words>  
She twisted it, gears grinding above, and the shaft shuddered alive, hauling her toward the control nexus where the station’s architects had woven their illusions. <words>239</words>  
Her strangeness was her armor; while others mourned Earth’s death, she’d studied its relics, learning how sustenance and sabotage were twin arts. <words>264</words>  
The nexus glowed, a sphere of holograms masking the truth: the station’s “sustenance” was a loop, recycling the last tree’s ashes into synthetic soil. <words>290</words>  
With a yell that echoed her ancestors’ rebellions, she hurled the churn into the projector, its rust cracking the illusion’s shell. <words>313</words>  
Light bled into the decks, revealing hydroponic farms choked with ash, their controllers fleeing as the sparks of her allies ignited the station’s dormant rage. <words>340</words>  
She didn’t smile; aloofness demanded detachment, but her pulse thrummed as the grand illusion fractured, its shards reflecting faces long numbed by lies. <words>367</words>  
The merchant descended through the chaos, her churn retrieved and scarred, its grooves now holding not butter, but the grit of a reborn cosmos. <words>394</words>  
Rebellious sparks needed fuel, and she’d become a conduit, her honestly strange heart beating in time with the station’s newfound breath. <words>419</words>  
As Earth’s final echo faded, she ascended again—not upward, but into the fray, where passion and purpose fused into something neither aloof nor tame. <words>446</words>
