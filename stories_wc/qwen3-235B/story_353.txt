<story>  
The small-town baker kneaded dough beneath the flicker of a single bulb, her hands moving with the cynically gentle rhythm of someone who’d stopped believing in miracles but still baked them into loaves. <words>23</words>  
When shadows learned to speak, they whispered through the cracks in her oven, their voices brittle as ash, warning her that the tyrant’s spies had begun sniffing around her pressed-flower arrangements—the ones she’d pressed between ledger pages for thirty years, each bloom a seed of contagion waiting to unfurl. <words>56</words>  
She’d inherited the bakery—and the flowers—from her mother, who’d died coughing black petals into a handkerchief, the first victim of the blight that now strangled the land. <words>75</words>  
The emergency time machine garage sat buried beneath the bread racks, a relic from the old wars, its gears rusted but still humming with the moon’s pull; she’d found it by accident, prying up a floorboard to stash her mother’s final letter. <words>104</words>  
The letter had been written in spores, decipherable only when the moon waxed gibbous, its instructions cryptic: *Track the patterns. Exceed the cycle. Break the crown of rot.* <words>123</words>  
She’d laughed then, a dry, cracked sound, because what could a baker do to dethrone a tyrant who’d choked the skies with smog and the people with fear? <words>147</words>  
But the shadows hissed louder each night, and the flowers in her ledger began to twitch, roots drilling into the wood like clockwork. <words>163</words>  
On the eve of the blood moon, she crammed a loaf tin with dough laced with spores, shoved it into the time machine’s maw, and set the dials to *Before*, when the tyrant was still a boy with a fondness for dandelion wine. <words>190</words>  
The machine shuddered, its gears grinding in time with the moon’s phases painted on her bakery walls—a calendar of wounds, each phase a memory of what the tyrant had stolen. <words>214</words>  
She emerged in a field of goldenrod, the air sweet with unspoiled earth, and planted her flowers where the boy would find them, their petals whispering the names of the dead. <words>238</words>  
When she returned, the present had frayed: the bakery stood in ruins, but the shadows now wore faces, their voices harmonizing into a hymn of roots and rebellion. <words>263</words>  
The tyrant’s statues crumbled overnight, vines bursting from their stone throats, and in the capital, a child king choked on a dandelion puff, his final scream drowned by birdsong. <words>289</words>  
She kneaded her last loaf in the wreckage, pressing fresh flowers into its crust—blossoms that glowed like fractured moons—while the shadows hummed her mother’s lullaby. <words>314</words>  
The contagion had spread, not as a plague, but as a promise: every seed a clock, every bloom a reckoning. <words>332</words>  
When the new government came, offering medals and apologies, she handed them a loaf and closed the bakery door, forever. <words>350</words>  
The shadows followed her west, trailing like ink in water, as she walked toward a horizon where the moon’s patterns finally made sense. <words>370</words>  
She never looked back, though the flowers in her pockets kept singing. <words>383</words>
