The overworked policy enforcer, Mira, adjusted her frayed uniform collar as she stared through the observation post’s algae-streaked window, the kelp forest swaying like a cathedral of secrets outside. <words>17</words>  
Her fingers drummed the desk—a hollow rhythm echoing the tribal dances her grandmother once described, all firelight and truth, before the utopia’s sterilizing policies erased such “primitive” rituals. <words>35</words>  
A rustic bread box sat on her desk, its oak lid carved with vines and defiance; it was the only relic she’d salvaged from her grandmother’s home, a genuinely fake artifact the utopia’s archives dismissed as “sentimental debris.” <words>54</words>  
She’d sworn to uphold the utopia’s order at 23, the exact second her mentor clasped her wrist and whispered, “Fear is a virus. Eradicate it.” <words>65</words>  
But now, the kelp writhed unnaturally, tendrils clawing at the glass as if the ocean itself sought to unmake her post. <words>74</words>  
The bread box hummed, its seams glowing faintly, and Mira laughed—a jagged, tear-choked sound—as she realized the “debris” had been guiding her all along. <words>87</words>  
She lifted the lid, releasing a drum the size of her palm, its leather head etched with the same swirling patterns as the kelp. <words>96</words>  
The supernatural had never been absent, only buried, and the drum’s pulse now thrummed in her ribs, syncing with the forest’s chaos. <words>107</words>  
Mira struck the drum, the rhythm a question, and the kelp stilled, listening. <words>113</words>  
A promise must be sworn in water’s tongue, her grandmother had said, not in fear but to it—to let it carve you hollow so light might enter. <words>125</words>  
She pressed her palm to the glass as a shadow coalesced in the depths: a serpentine thing with eyes like drowned stars, its gaze locking onto hers. <words>136</words>  
The drumbeat quickened, her feet moving in a dance she’d never learned yet somehow knew, the rhythm guiding her through steps that bent space and time. <words>148</words>  
The creature mirrored her, its body curling into a spiral as the observation post groaned, kelp strands parting to reveal a tunnel of liquid light. <words>159</words>  
Mira’s tears fell freely now, laughter bubbling through her gasps—how could she have enforced a world that denied this raw, terrifying beauty? <words>171</words>  
At the tunnel’s heart, a second promise waited, older than the utopia: to greet fear not as a virus, but as the first note in a song that could mend broken worlds. <words>185</words>  
She struck the drum one final time, the sound merging with the creature’s keening cry, and stepped forward as the tunnel collapsed into dawn. <words>195</words>  
The bread box, now empty, tumbled to the floor, its purpose fulfilled. <words>200</words>  
When the council demanded answers, Mira smiled her genuinely fake smile, handed them a drumstick, and said, “Let’s begin again.” <words>210</words>  
The utopia would crack, then, like bread, and through its crust, something alive would rise. <words>218</words>
