<story>  
The measured diplomat knelt in the shadow of forgotten city hall, the organically synthetic walls pulsing faintly as if breathing, their surface a lattice of moss and corroded steel. <words>22</words>  
A fox tail tassel, stolen from a bandit’s corpse years ago, hung from their belt—a reminder of the first life they’d taken to preserve a fragile peace. <words>43</words>  
The core concept of their mission here was etched in irony: to decode genetic patterns from the bandit’s preserved tissue, hidden within the shuttered children’s theater two blocks east, where the faint scent of must had guided them. <words>72</words>  
Amid drum circles echoing through the hollowed city, the diplomat moved with abrasive calm, their jaw tight as memories of the bandit leader’s jest surfaced—a taunt about “blood singing louder than treaties.” <words>101</words>  
They’d hunted the bandit across deserts for that insult, for the lives lost to raids, only to find a dying man muttering about a “price” yet unpaid. <words>125</words>  
Now, the diplomat’s own blood hummed with urgency, the genetic code they sought rumored to hold a key to the bandit’s unnatural resilience—or the toxin that killed them. <words>150</words>  
The theater’s door groaned open, releasing a breath of mildew and secrets; the scent of must thickened, clinging to their gloves as they traced a child’s mural of stick figures dancing in a circle. <words>180</words>  
Beneath a collapsed stage, a vial glinted, its label etched with the same jest the bandit had spoken: *“Vengeance is a root, not a blade.”* <words>203</words>  
Synthetic light from their wristband revealed the genetic sequence inside—a mirror of their own, altered by the diplomat’s own lab’s experiments decades prior. <words>227</words>  
The bandit’s face flashed in their mind, not as a foe, but as a nephew they’d never known, engineered from stolen DNA to inherit a war they’d both lost. <words>251</words>  
Drumbeats crescendoed outside, the rhythm a dirge as the diplomat pocketed the vial, their calm fracturing into a hollow laugh—how many more would pay for the jest they’d begun? <words>278</words>  
The fox tail felt heavier, its fibers whispering of cycles unbroken, as they stepped back into the street, the price of revenge now a debt carried in their very cells. <words>307</words>  
In the end, the diplomat stood at the city hall’s apex, watching flames rise from the theater, their reflection in the synthetic moss a question: who becomes the bandit when the root is unearthed? <words>336</words>  
The drums fell silent, and so did their mask, the abrasive calm dissolving into the must-laden air—a diplomat no longer, but a man who’d decoded his own extinction. <words>363</words>
