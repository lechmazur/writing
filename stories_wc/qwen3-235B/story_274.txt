<story>  
The sentient houseplant, Verdant, had spent decades apathetically devoted to its purpose, roots anchored in the cracked windowsill of the abandoned writer’s cottage, leaves curling toward the final page of a story typed on a worn typewriter that had long since fallen silent. <words>44</words>  
When the last sentence faded into dust, Verdant stirred, its fronds twitching with a compulsion it could not name—a pull toward the embroidered bookmark tangled in its vines, its threadbare fabric stitched with constellations only the forgotten drive-in’s neon husk could decipher. <words>85</words>  
It had no legs to outrun the creeping rot of stagnation, but the wind carried its seeds, and the earth shifted, tilting the pot toward a spontaneous decision: to roll, lurching, down the gravel path toward the drive-in’s skeletal gates, where the air hummed with unspoken histories. <words>127</words>  
The drive-in’s screen loomed like a ghost, its speakers dangling like dead fruit, yet Verdant sensed the hidden knowledge buried beneath the asphalt—memories of starlit films and whispered confessions, secrets the soil had greedily devoured. <words>167</words>  
As it inched forward, the bookmark fluttered free, landing atop a rusted car seat, its embroidered stars aligning with the drive-in’s faded marquee, which flickered to life in a phantom glow, projecting a map of forgotten constellations. <words>207</words>  
Verdant’s roots quivered; the knowledge was not in the soil but in the void above, where stories had been flung into the cosmos, untethered. The drive-in had been a conduit, a place where humans once sat, mouths agape, swallowing light—and leaving their silences behind. <words>249</words>  
A scalding wind rose, carrying the scent of burnt celluloid and regret. Verdant’s leaves recoiled, yet it pressed on, apathy cracking like dry earth as it absorbed the weight of what had been lost: a language of glances, of half-written letters, of films never finished. <words>291</words>  
The bookmark pulsed, threading its knowledge into Verdant’s veins—how the drive-in’s final night had been a crescendo of unspoken goodbyes, lovers parting without words, their echoes trapped in the typewriter’s last, unfinished sentence. <words>331</words>  
When the first raindrop struck its spine, Verdant understood its devotion had never been apathy; it had been waiting for a vessel to carry the unspoken forward, to root these ghosts in a world that had stopped listening. <words>370</words>  
It did not outrun the storm, but let the seeds scatter, each one a fragment of the drive-in’s buried truths, each sprout a new archive of what humanity had failed to say before the screen went dark, and the typewriter keys stilled forever. <words>412</words>
