The repressed poet had always walked the same cracked sidewalks, their verses suffocated by the weight of unspoken syllables, until the moment a pin seemed to drop in the silent corridor of their routine, compelling them to swerve onto an overgrown city street where vines strangled lampposts and roots split asphalt. <words>44</words>  
They hadn’t meant to explore the side road, but the air there hummed with a decayed sweetness, like forgotten perfume, and something about the way ivy draped the ruins of a forgotten apothecary tugged them forward, secretly terrified yet compelled by the ache of unfinished stanzas clawing at their ribs. <words>87</words>  
Beneath a shattered display window, half-buried in dust and wilted violets, lay an antique perfume bottle, its glass ambered with age, stopper intact, radiating a silence so profound it felt like a held breath—a relic of a world that once believed in preserving beauty. <words>129</words>  
When they lifted it, the street hissed awake: a rustle in the ferns, a shadow detaching itself from a crumbling brick wall, and then the ambush—figures emerging with hands outstretched, faces blurred by the same fog that clung to the poet’s doubts, their whispers threading through the air like smoke. <words>169</words>  
“Not for you,” one hissed, but the poet clutched the bottle tighter, their pulse a frantic meter against the cosmic verse they’d longed to pen on mortal skin, a poem that might bind time itself, if only they dared inscribe their own flesh with its truths. <words>210</words>  
The figures circled, their forms flickering like half-remembered nightmares, and the poet, naively wise, understood this was never about theft—it was a reckoning, a demand to confront the lingering doubts that had kept their ink captive, their voice a prisoner of the page. <words>250</words>  
In the stillness after the hissed ultimatum, the perfume bottle trembled, its stopper popping free with a sigh that carried the scent of extinct roses and singed constellations, and in that breath, the poet knew: the ambushers were fragments of themselves, the parts that feared irrelevance, exposure, the futility of verse. <words>294</words>  
They tipped the bottle, letting a single drop fall onto their wrist, where it seared the skin into a cursive only the dying stars could read—a line of poetry that hummed with the weight of galaxies, a cosmic verse born of terror and tenderness. <words>335</words>  
The figures recoiled, unraveling into mist, and the poet stood alone in the reclaimed street, the bottle now dust, their skin etched with a phrase they could never unwrite: “We are brief, therefore infinite.” <words>374</words>  
They laughed then, a raw, knowing sound, because the universe had always been an elegy, and their doubts, their terror, their naive hope—it was all just punctuation in the grand, unfinished stanza of being alive. <words>414</words>  
Walking home, they traced the words on their arm, already fading, already eternal, and wondered if anyone else heard the pin drop in the silent corridor, or if they’d been the only one brave enough to swerve. <words>454</words>
