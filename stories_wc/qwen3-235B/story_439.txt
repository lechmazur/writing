The mute courier clutched the frayed pocket guide to interdimensional travel beneath their coat, its pages humming faintly against the storm’s roar as snow sifted through the shattered skylight of the opera house. <words>22</words>  
Graffiti-coated walls whispered forgotten arias, while the comet’s silver streak, visible even through the tempest, pulsed in time with the guide’s glowing glyphs—a map only they could decipher. <words>44</words>  
Unassumingly bold, they traced a cracked mirror backstage, its surface rippling like liquid mercury, reflecting not their face but a labyrinth of stars, each one a door. <words>65</words>  
The motivation was never escape, but understanding: why the guide had materialized in their hands years ago, why the mind’s prison craved unraveling. <words>86</words>  
Snow accumulated on the velvet stage, where a phantom orchestra once played; now, the courier knelt, sketching sigils in frost, guided by the comet’s slow descent. <words>108</words>  
A key, the guide insisted, could be generated not by voice but intent—a bridge between the opera house’s decaying grandeur and the dimensions folded beneath its rot. <words>130</words>  
The courier’s breath fogged the air as they worked, their silence a language sharper than words, each gesture a defiance of the storm’s chaos. <words>151</words>  
When the sigils ignited, blue-white and humming, the comet’s light funneled downward, striking the mirror, which shattered into a vortex of stained-glass light. <words>173</words>  
Tone cautioned awe; the air smelled of ozone and aged sheet music, the vortex’s pull tugging at scars they’d never spoken of. <words>191</words>  
Inside the rift, dimensions bled together: a desert of floating clocks, a city where shadows walked upright, a void where thoughts manifested as constellations. <words>213</words>  
The guide vibrated, its pages turning autonomously, annotating each world with footnotes only the courier’s mind could parse—hidden meanings in the static of existence. <words>236</words>  
Boldness wavered when a figure emerged in the vortex—a reflection, not of their face, but of their unvoiced yearning, lips moving in a silent chorus they felt in their bones. <words>259</words>  
Communication was telepathic, a resonance: *You sought escape, but the mind is a cage only you hold the key to.* <words>277</words>  
The courier hesitated, snow from the opera house melting on their palms, the comet’s light now a tether fraying as dawn threatened the horizon. <words>297</words>  
Choice condensed the air—a return, or a leap into the unknown. The guide snapped shut; the vortex shuddered, awaiting intent. <words>314</words>  
They chose neither. Instead, they pressed a hand to the figure’s chest, transferring the guide, its purpose fulfilled. A trade: their quest for the figure’s silence. <words>336</words>  
The opera house reassembled around them—a single snowflake landing on the mirror’s remnant, reflecting a thousand unspoken truths. <words>353</words>  
The comet vanished. The courier stood, no longer mute, but electing quietude, their escape now woven into the harbor’s storm-salt air, a secret hum in the walls. <words>376</words>  
When wanderers later asked about the glyphs faintly etched beneath the stage, they’d smile, nod toward the sky, and gesture at the snow—answers without sound. <words>399</words>  
The mind’s prison had dissolved, not in fleeing, but in the boldness of staying, finding meaning in the interstices, where enchantment lingered, cautious and vast. <words>422</words>
