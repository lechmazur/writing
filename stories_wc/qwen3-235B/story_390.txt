<story>  
The calm assassin knelt in the moonlit courtyard of the ancient Chinese palace, pressing a dagger-shaped botanical press into the soil where a bloodroot had been uprooted mid-scream; the whispers of longing from the dead plant clung to his sleeves like cobwebs. <words>44</words>  
He hummed a folk tune through his teeth, the melody amalgamating with the rustle of jade leaves overhead, as he arranged the crimson petals into a scroll case—figuratively literal, as the warlord’s daughter had once described his methods, though she’d been too busy choking on lotus mist to elaborate. <words>89</words>  
The pattern of a butterfly’s wings, inked onto his forearm in fermented plum wine, twitched toward the eastern pavilion, where the palace’s trapped corridors spiraled like a snail’s shell; the assassin smirked, appreciating the irony of using an insect’s flight path to navigate a structure built to repel dragons. <words>134</words>  
He moved past a koi pond where fish flickered like struck matches, their scales whispering prophecies in the dialect of drowned scholars—*spin the silk, unweave the throne*—and pocketed a vial of water that hummed with the longing of a thousand concubines denied burial. <words>177</words>  
The air tasted of cinnamon and treachery, a humorously lethal combination, as he slipped into the Hall of Mirrored Moths; each reflective surface showed him a different version of the mission—a man with a sword, a man with a plague, a man with a child’s laughter caught in his throat. <words>220</words>  
Here, the whispers crescendoed, not from the walls but from the soles of his boots, which had begun to sprout violets that hummed with the palace’s buried grief; he crushed them underfoot, noting their scent was indistinguishable from regret. <words>263</words>  
At the heart of the labyrinth, he found the Oracle of Unwritten Edicts, a moth-winged child suspended in amber, who giggled and asked if he’d come to trade his shadow for a riddle—a proposition the assassin declined by flicking a pressed magnolia petal into her third eye. <words>308</words>  
Instead, he laid the botanical press upon the altar, its grooves aligning with the child’s wing veins, and poured the vial of longing-water into the mechanism; the resulting steam coalesced into a scroll penned in the hand of a poet-king long dead. <words>351</words>  
The prophecy read: *The blade that hungers will hunger anew when the butterfly drinks the moon.* He snorted—a sound like a turtle climbing stairs—and repurposed the text by folding it into a paper crane that promptly defecated a pearl into his palm. <words>394</words>  
As the palace shuddered, its corridors untangling into a highway of peonies, he pocketed the pearl and wondered if spinning raw possibility into existence counted as job security or a cosmic prank; the answer, he decided, hinged on whether the warlord’s daughter could brew tea. <words>439</words>  
He left the crane to guard the Oracle, its wings now tattooed with the first question never asked, and stepped into the dawn, where the horizon rippled like the edge of a half-forgotten map. <words>482</words>
