<story>  
The time refugee from the forgotten empire of Vael adjusted the atom-powered lighthouse’s trembling prism, her hands steady despite the static hum of a century she did not belong to. <words>17</words>  
The lighthouse, perched on a coast where the sea had long evaporated into salt plains, pulsed its borrowed dawn—a pale, synthetic sunrise engineered to mimic the light that once warmed her lost homeland. <words>35</words>  
She was trustworthy in her strangeness: the villagers below left offerings of gears and silence at her door, for they sensed her defiance was not against them, but a quiet rebellion against time itself. <words>53</words>  
Her motive was stitched into the embroidered tablecloth she unfurled each night on the observation deck—a relic from Vael’s last feast, its golden threads mapping constellations now erased from the sky. <words>72</words>  
By the alignment of the stars that should not have still existed, she calculated trajectories in the dust, her finger tracing paths only she could see; the villagers whispered she spoke to dead astronomers. <words>92</words>  
The hush of a line that never moves—the temporal scar across the sky, frozen mid-sundial—was her clock and her cage, a reminder that Vael’s collapse had unmoored her between epochs. <words>112</words>  
Tonight, she would catapult the tablecloth into the scar, its fabric weighted with a vial of atom-light, a desperate alchemy to mend the wound that had bled centuries into the void. <words>131</words>  
The villagers gathered below, their faces upturned like cracked porcelain, as the lighthouse shuddered; they did not know her name, but they knew the stars bent when she called. <words>150</words>  
She lit the vial’s fuse, its glow seeping through the cloth’s embroidery, and whispered the names of the dead—not as elegies, but as coordinates. <words>168</words>  
The catapult’s release split the air, the tablecloth arcing into the scar’s motionless line, and for a breath, the sky rippled like water struck by stone. <words>186</words>  
Light erupted—not borrowed, but wholly new—as the constellations on the cloth ignited, stitching the torn fabric of time to the present with threads of unstoppable will. <words>205</words>  
The refugee did not cheer; she only watched the horizon, where the salt plains began to shimmer with the faintest suggestion of waves, and wondered if Vael’s shores now remembered her. <words>225</words>  
When the villagers fled, screaming of miracles, she returned to her logbook and wrote in the margin of a century’s-end entry: *The dawn is not borrowed. We make it and remake it, even from ruins.* <words>247</words>  
The lighthouse’s beam swung outward, carrying the scent of ozone and old linen, and the scar in the sky narrowed—a fraction, but enough. <words>264</words>  
She folded the remaining threads of the tablecloth into her pocket, a compass for the next wound, the next war against forgetting. <words>280</words>  
In the borrowed dawn’s glow, her shadow stretched not as a refugee’s, but as a bridge—tense, defiant, and terribly alive. <words>297</words>
