<story>  
The guarded druid knelt in the glacial orchard, their breath fogging the air as they scraped frost from a dull safety pin hidden beneath a lichen-crusted stone. <words>22</words>  
The orchard’s trees hung suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, roots clawing at the void, bearing fruit only on the birthdays of those who had long vanished. <words>40</words>  
They had gathered here for the first time since the last human’s departure, fiercely ambivalent about reviving the ritual—a meal that once bound kin but now mocked the silence. <words>59</words>  
The pin, a relic from their mother’s apron, trembled in their grip; it had pinned cloaks against winter winds, secured charms against frost spirits, and now, perhaps, could pierce the ice-locked apples above. <words>85</words>  
Breaking the silence meant more than speech—it meant rousing the orchard’s slumbering magic, which hummed uneasily beneath the crevasse’s glassy surface. <words>103</words>  
They stabbed the pin into a fruit’s frozen skin, sap welling like liquid starlight, and remembered their mother’s hands: calloused, certain, weaving this sap into syrup that healed wounds or induced visions. <words>127</words>  
Fear gnawed at them—the crevasse’s ice had cracked once before, unleashing a hunger that devoured entire groves, and their family’s meal had always been a fragile appeasement. <words>150</words>  
Yet dour amusement tugged their lips; here they were, a druid who’d outlived their purpose, preparing a feast for ghosts, defiantly chatty with the void. <words>172</words>  
The orchard shuddered as they plucked a second apple, its core vibrating with a soundless scream—the crevasse’s prisoner, long trapped by the meal’s magic, was stirring. <words>194</words>  
They worked faster, peeling the fruit with the pin’s blunt tip, each motion a stitch in the old chant: *Gather the sweet, feed the root, bind the dark.* <words>216</words>  
The syrup thickened in their clay pot, glowing faintly, and the druid wondered if this was cowardice or courage—rekindling a ritual to confront a fear that had haunted their bloodline for centuries. <words>241</words>  
When the crevasse groaned, they hurled the first spoonful of syrup into its depths, and the ice bloomed into fractals, revealing a face within—a frozen ancestor, screaming. <words>264</words>  
The druid laughed bitterly, a sound swallowed by the silence they’d shattered; their family had fed the orchard to keep the prisoner dormant, yet never questioned what they’d become to sustain it. <words>290</words>  
They poured the rest of the syrup onto the roots, which drank greedily, and the trees shivered, dropping fruit that sprouted wings of vapor before vanishing—messages to the dead. <words>314</words>  
The crevasse’s face dissolved, pacified, and the druid pocketed the pin, its weight a reminder that some silences are prisons, others liberation. <words>337</words>  
As snow swallowed their footprints, they hummed a birthday hymn to the empty air, fiercely ambivalent about whether the orchard’s next harvest would find them waiting—or gone. <words>360</words>  
The ritual was a thread, not a cage; they would gather again, not to bind the dark, but to watch it, as kin once had, with eyes unflinching. <words>384</words>  
The ice groaned in reply, and the druid smiled—a flicker of warmth in a world that had forgotten how to burn. <words>403</words>
