The seasoned woodsman trudged through the radio wave garden, its artfully messy tangle of rusted antennae and overgrown ferns humming with static—a graveyard of forgotten signals. <words>17</words>  
He clutched the antique hairbrush, its silver handle etched with initials that mirrored his late wife’s, a relic from her final days when she’d whispered of a hidden railway map carved into the hills. <words>35</words>  
His motivation was neither nostalgia nor duty, but a promise: to chart the abandoned tracks she’d loved, a penance for lying about burning her journals years ago. <words>52</words>  
The core concept of honesty had always short-circuited his logic—truth, he’d learned, was a blade that freed only after it cut. <words>65</words>  
At the water tower’s base, he rigged a microphone from scavenged parts, recalling her laugh as he measured the echo’s decay. <words>78</words>  
*Twelve seconds*, he noted—the void’s reply, a ghostly metronome syncing with the hospital monitor miles away, where his daughter now wept into a disconnected phone. <words>95</words>  
He’d left her a voicemail that morning: *“I’ll finish this. Then I’ll come clean.”* The tower’s groan harmonized with the last beep he’d ever hear from her world. <words>113</words>  
As the recording played, the brush’s bristles snagged on a crevice, prying open a panel stuffed with yellowed blueprints, their ink faded like old blood. <words>130</words>  
The map was real—a latticework of tunnels beneath the garden, singing with frequencies only the honest could decipher. <words>144</words>  
He laughed, a raw, cheerful sound amid despair, and stuffed the hairbrush into his coat, its teeth now cradling a curl of her hair he’d never noticed. <words>162</words>  
The tower shuddered; his equipment short-circuited in a shower of sparks, the echo’s final measurement searing into his skull like a requiem. <words>179</words>  
He saw her then—not in the static, but in the silence after, where truth lived: a girl on a hospital bed, clutching a faded photo of them both at that same tower, decades prior. <words>200</words>  
The railway’s phantoms converged, and he walked them, the hairbrush a compass pointing toward every lie he’d unmade. <words>214</words>  
When the monitor flatlined, its last beep folded into the garden’s hum, he knelt at a sleeper’s grave, whispering names he’d once erased. <words>231</words>  
The woodsman’s map bloomed that night—a constellation of tracks reborn in starlight, his daughter’s tears evaporating into the air like Morse code. <words>249</words>  
He did not return home. Instead, he became the echo, the artfully messy steward of a garden where honesty grew wild, rooted in the sound of a hairbrush catching the wind. <words>271</words>
