<story>  
The uncertain druid adjusted their frayed cloak, the weight of the dented lunch tin in their pocket a familiar anchor against the chaos of the hologram repair shop’s flickering neon glow. <words>17</words>  
They had inherited the tin from a mentor who’d vanished mid-ritual, its dents and scratches a uniquely common relic of a life half-remembered, yet bound to their own obligations. <words>34</words>  
The shop hummed with dormant machines, patrons trickling in throughout library hours to mend fractured illusions—phantom actors trapped in cracked projectors, fading holograms of forgotten plays. <words>51</words>  
But the druid’s true work began when the shop’s bells fell silent: wandering the back-alley theater auditions, where voices cracked with desperation and hope, seeking those who might help forge beauty from anarchy. <words>70</words>  
They’d been hired to repair a ghost-light for a troupe’s opening night, but the real task was unspoken—a debt owed to the city’s unseen threads, the ties of obligation tightening with each ignored plea. <words>90</words>  
At the auditions, the druid lingered in shadows, tin clutched like a talisman, watching performers twist their bodies into shapes that mirrored the alleyways’ jagged bones. <words>109</words>  
A girl with a voice like shattered glass sang a lullaby; a mime painted invisible constellations midair. <words>120</words>  
The druid felt the pull of their raw, untamed energy—the kind that could fuel a ritual if woven right, if the lunch tin’s dormant magic could be coaxed awake by something uniquely common, something human. <words>141</words>  
They’d tried before and failed, the tin’s contents—a pinch of ash, a copper wire—refusing to ignite, leaving the druid adrift in lethargic excitement, half-believing their mentor’s last words: “It’s not the magic, it’s the making.” <words>164</words>  
Tonight, though, the mime’s constellations shimmered oddly, aligning with the tin’s dents as if the universe had paused to notice. <words>177</words>  
The druid approached, voice hesitant, offering a role not in the play but in a ritual to stitch light into the city’s fractures, to let art outlive its makers. <words>196</words>  
The mime nodded, fingers tracing a star on the druid’s palm—a pact sealed in silence. <words>207</words>  
Back at the shop, they worked throughout library hours, the tin humming as the mime’s gestures fed its hunger, holograms blooming into kaleidoscopic life: ghost-actors dancing in impossible synchrony. <words>227</words>  
When dawn bled through the windows, the druid stared at the transformed tin—gleaming, whole—and wondered if obligation could ever be shed, or if beauty was just its own kind of debt. <words>247</words>  
The repaired ghost-light bathed the alley in gold, the play’s first line echoing as the druid wandered home: “We are the cracks where the light begins.” <words>263</words>  
They still didn’t know if they’d forged beauty, but the tin in their pocket felt lighter, and for now, that was enough to keep wandering. <words>280</words>
