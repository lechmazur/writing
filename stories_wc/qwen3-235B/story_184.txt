<story>  
The scrappy tavern-hand, Lira, swept the vacuum chamber garden’s glass floor, her boots crunching on salt left by evaporated tears—hers or the moon’s, she never knew. <words>17</words>  
She paused, staring at her prized collection of broken seashells glued to the wall like fractured constellations, each shard whispering of oceans lost to the dried-up riverbed below the hills. <words>40</words>  
“Predictably unpredictable,” she muttered, quoting her ex-lover, a clockwork bard who’d dissolved into gears mid-chorus, a reminder that time hated punchlines. <words>59</words>  
When the sands of time began flowing backward that morning, Lira had shrugged and poured rum into her coffee, figuring the universe’s midlife crisis was none of her concern. <words>85</words>  
But the footprints appeared at noon—fossilized impressions of bare feet, leading from the riverbed’s cracked mud into the garden’s oxygen-starved roses, and she knew her shift was about to get weird. <words>114</words>  
She followed them, randomizing her steps to mimic their jagged path, her calloused hands brushing the seashells at her belt, charms against a fate she’d never outrun. <words>140</words>  
The footprints belonged to a child who’d walked backward through time, her own younger self, Lira realized, as the air thickened with the smell of brine and a voice hummed a lullaby their mother had forgotten. <words>173</words>  
“Flippant solemnity,” she hissed, tearing a shell from her hip and hurling it into the void; it shattered louder than a supernova, and the garden trembled. <words>198</words>  
The child—her younger self—pointed to the riverbed’s fossils, now glowing like bioluminescent scars, and Lira understood: her calling was to mend what time had unraveled, even if it meant becoming the joke of eternity. <words>234</words>  
She catapulted imagination beyond known realms by kicking the glass wall, screaming until her throat bled starlight, and weaving stories into the vacuum, tales where oceans drank the sky and feet walked without ground. <words>269</words>  
The footprints dissolved as the sands reversed again, leaving her stranded in a moment she’d both lived and invented, her hands full of seashells that now glowed with a light she could finally hold. <words>302</words>  
Lira laughed, a sound like a hiccup in spacetime, and planted the shells in the garden’s soil, where they bloomed into trees bearing clocks instead of fruit, each ticking backward in flippant salute to the inevitable. <words>337</words>  
When the tavern called her back, she went willingly, knowing her work was done—she’d randomized her fate into something the universe couldn’t unmake, a story where being trapped was the only freedom that made sense. <words>371</words>  
The garden thrived in her absence, a vacuum full of breath, its roses whispering her name in the static between heartbeats, a solemn ode to the scrappy girl who’d taught time itself to flinch. <words>404</words>  
And somewhere, a child walked forward at last, her feet leaving fossils that would wait centuries to be found, broken and made whole again in the same breath. <words>435</words>
