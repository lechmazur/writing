<story>  
The hopeful knight, clad in dented silver and a cloak frayed by seasons of wandering, stepped into the hedge maze as the last gasp of a streetlamp’s glow winked out, leaving only the faint shimmer of starlight to guide him. <words>22</words>  
He had spent years chasing whispers of the mystic orchard garden, where the roots of ancient apple trees drank from rivers of forgotten time, and where the machine that cycled regrets churned beneath petals that hummed with spectral lament. <words>47</words>  
His quest was born not of vengeance or glory, but a cleverly naive belief that the world could be unburdened of its ghosts—if he could just reach the heart of the maze before dawn dissolved the veil between realms. <words>72</words>  
The stray jigsaw edge, found half-buried in the labyrinth’s entrance, pulsed faintly in his palm, its jagged shape a riddle he’d yet to solve, though he suspected it mirrored a gap in the machine itself. <words>98</words>  
As he navigated the shifting hedges, their thorns snagging his sleeves like grasping fingers, he hummed a lullaby his mother once sang—a melody that now felt like a cryptic frequency syncing with the orchard’s hidden rhythm. <words>125</words>  
The maze responded: walls parted, revealing a grove where fruit glowed like captured moonlight, and at its center, the machine—a brass-and-crystal construct, its gears grinding out regrets in audible whispers, each tick a sigh of a soul reliving its worst moment. <words>154</words>  
The knight’s hands trembled as he pressed the jigsaw edge to the machine’s core; it fit perfectly, yet resistance thrummed beneath his fingertips, as though the device demanded more than mere alignment. <words>178</words>  
He recalled the orchard’s legend: to reclaim the lost, one must harmonize with the frequencies of their own remorse, to let the ache of what was slip into the cracks of what could be. <words>203</words>  
Closing his eyes, he let the machine’s lament flood him—the regret of a lover’s unspoken words, of a child’s hand lost in a crowd, of his own failure to save a squire who’d once called him brother. <words>229</words>  
The jigsaw piece grew warm, vibrating in time with his heartbeat, and he realized his naivety had been the key all along: he hadn’t come to destroy the machine, but to neutralize it by becoming its bridge. <words>254</words>  
As the first rays of dawn pierced the maze, the machine shuddered and fell silent, its gears stilled by the knight’s tears, which dripped onto the jigsaw edge now fused into its heart. <words>279</words>  
The orchard’s apples ripened in an instant, their skins etched with names of the forgiven, and the knight, hollow yet radiant, turned homeward, knowing the world’s regrets would now ripen into lessons, not chains. <words>306</words>  
He left the maze as the streetlamp flickered back to life, its light mundane but kind, and though his chest ached with the weight of all he’d confronted, he smiled—clever, foolish, and free. <words>332</words>  
The orchard vanished behind him, its secret safe, its agony transfigured into a bliss that lingered like the afterimage of a star. <words>349</words>
