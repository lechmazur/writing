<story>  
The streetwise orphan slipped through the temple’s vine-choked archway, the cursed cameo brooch burning cold against their chest like a stolen secret. <words>17</words>  
Fruit-laden vines hung heavy with unripe pomegranates, their skins split to reveal seeds that glimmered like teeth—a contrast to the moss-eaten statues whispering prayers to forgotten gods. <words>34</words>  
They’d heard the rumors: a place where time rotted into itself, where the unwritten calendar of the orchard’s heart beat in reverse, shedding years instead of gaining them. <words>51</words>  
The brooch, its garnet eye cracked, hummed a distant echo of its maker’s voice—a woman who’d drowned her own hope in alchemy, leaving only this prison of silver and regret. <words>69</words>  
The orphan’s boots crunched on petrified apple cores as they moved, each step a theoretically random gamble; the temple’s floor shifted like a chessboard, tiles rising and falling to trap the unworthy. <words>87</words>  
They danced backward, reversing their patterns, mimicking the orchard’s logic: to move forward, retreat; to live, pretend to die. <words>102</words>  
A vine snagged their wrist, its thorns drilling toward bone until they hissed, “*Not yet,*” the words a key stolen from the cameo’s memory. <words>117</words>  
The vine recoiled, blooming a single white flower—a map to the orchard’s core, where roots drank from a wellspring of unlit stars. <words>131</words>  
Here, the air thickened with the scent of burnt honey, and the orphan pressed the brooch into the earth, letting its curse unravel. <words>147</words>  
Darkness pooled upward, swallowing the vines, the statues, the sky, until only a single sapling remained, its leaves trembling with nascent light. <words>164</words>  
They plucked a fruit that had never been planted, its skin warm as breath, and the cameo cracked wider, releasing a laugh like a sob. <words>182</words>  
“Harvest hope from darkness,” the voice inside the brooch murmured, now freed—a ghost willing itself into a seed. <words>197</words>  
The temple dissolved around them, time snapping back into its unwritten groove, but the orphan stood firm, planting the fruit where roots could drink both shadow and dawn. <words>216</words>  
They didn’t know if the new tree would bear poison or nectar, but their hands, calloused and sure, worked the soil anyway—a gesture of confidence in the uncertain arithmetic of survival. <words>237</words>  
When the first bud bloomed violet at the edges, they smiled, pocketing the broken cameo as a reminder: patterns exist to be inverted, and endings are just echoes learning to speak. <words>256</words>  
The orchard sighed, its vines retreating into myth, leaving only the orphan and their theoretically random footsteps—a rhythm, not a requiem. <words>273</words>
