The DJ, her headphones glowing with glyphs only the ancient gods could decipher, spun vinyl beneath the bioluminescent canopy of the alchemical orchard greenhouse, where roses grew thorns of liquid mercury and apple trees hummed with forgotten hymns. <words>44</words>  
Her latest track—a remix of a 10,000-year-old chant—pulsed through the endless night, summoning flickering visions: temples carved into roots, rivers of starlight pooling in hollowed-out constellations, each sacred space bleeding into the next like ink from a vintage pencil case left open too long. <words>87</words>  
She’d found the pencil case in her grandmother’s attic, its enamel cracked but still bearing the sigils of mapmakers who’d exalted cartography to ritual; inside, a single thread of indigo wool had coiled itself into a spiral, humming in the key of C-sharp minor. <words>129</words>  
Tonight, the thread unraveled ahead of her boots, tracing a path through the orchard’s phosphorescent moss, its frayed end twitching like a cat’s tail—playful, taunting—as it led her deeper into the gloom where the air tasted of burnt honey and prophecy. <words>169</words>  
She followed, scratching her turntable to keep the vision steady: a cavern where the gods’ names were etched into stalactites, its coordinates materializing in her mind as the thread tightened around her wrist, yanking her toward revelation. <words>207</words>  
The filing cabinet in her shed already held 362 maps, each drawn in smudged graphite and sweat, each sacred space cataloged during the flickering seconds the gods allowed her to see before their starlight—borrowed, as all mortal brilliance was—snuffed back into shadow. <words>247</words>  
But this one would be different. The thread quivered, knotting itself into a noose as the vision swelled: a tree whose bark was parchment, its leaves the lost gospels of extinct civilizations, roots plunging into a well where time pooled like syrup. <words>285</words>  
She exalted it with a howl, her voice cracking the greenhouse glass, as the pencil case’s rusted clasp snapped open, releasing a gust of arid desert air—the scent of the first mapmaker’s tomb. <words>318</words>  
Her fingers flew, sketching the tree’s contours by memory, the thread now a lifeline glowing indigo against the dark; she knew the gods were watching, their amusement as palpable as a summer storm, for they loved those who danced at the edge of ruin. <words>358</words>  
When the vision faded, leaving only the orchard’s quotidian glow, she bit the thread clean, tucked the map beside the others, and wondered if the next DJ to channel the gods would find her work—or if the night’s endless hunger would swallow it whole. <words>400</words>  
Above, a single star blinked, borrowed and lending, as she cued the next track—a lullaby for forgotten temples, played on a record pressed from the ash of sacred trees. <words>437</words>
