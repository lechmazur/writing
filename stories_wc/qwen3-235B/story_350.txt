The back-alley puppeteer, Thalia, traced her calloused fingers over the cracked marble of the ancient Greek temple, its columns fractured by time but still humming with the weight of forgotten oaths. <words>21</words>  
She’d followed the symphonies of truth—a phrase scrawled in the margin of her late father’s irritatingly perfect vintage stamp album—to this place, where the last riddle of the midnight puzzle event had whispered its final syllable. <words>45</words>  
The album, bloated with stamps depicting constellations and weeping gods, had led her here: to a temple floor strewn with dried laurel leaves and the faint scent of burnt myrrh. <words>63</words>  
Beneath a collapsed altar, she found the trunk. <words>68</words>  
Its hinges screamed as she pried it open, revealing a moth-eaten wedding gown, its ivory silk shredded by decades of damp. <words>81</words>  
The tears in its folds were not random—they formed a cipher, a jagged topography that mirrored the constellations in the album’s warped pages. <words>100</words>  
Thalia’s breath hitched; her father had obsessed over this, his notes cryptic about remodelling truth through brokenness. <words>114</words>  
She threaded a puppet string through her needle, stitching fragments of the gown’s lace onto the album’s stamps, her hands trembling with the intimacy of the act. <words>134</words>  
Each sewn tear sang a note when plucked, a dissonant harmony that swelled into a requiem as the temple walls shuddered. <words>152</words>  
The symphonies of truth were not music but memories—the gown had belonged to her mother, who’d vanished after their last fight, her father’s love letter sealed with a stamp of Persephone. <words>177</words>  
The puppeteer’s tears smudged the ink, revealing a hidden map on the album’s backplate: a route to the temple’s inner sanctum, where her mother’s name was etched beside a vow to “love beyond riddles.” <words>204</words>  
Thalia clawed at the stone, her nails bleeding, until the wall gave way to a chamber lit by a single shaft of moonlight. <words>221</words>  
There, a second gown hung pristine, untouched by rot—the irritating perfection of a lie. <words>234</words>  
Beside it lay a puppet, its strings cut, its wooden face identical to hers. <words>247</words>  
The symphony crescendoed, a chorus of whispers explaining her father’s deceit: he’d staged her mother’s disappearance to hide his own betrayal, weaving lies into the stamps, the riddles, her entire life. <words>274</words>  
Thalia tore the pristine gown, her screams unraveling the temple’s frescoes, revealing the raw truth beneath—graffiti of ancient hands, clasped in silent solidarity. <words>296</words>  
When dawn came, the temple was dust, and the puppeteer walked away, the remodeled album tucked under her arm, its stitched tears singing a dirge for the truth she’d never wanted but could no longer ignore. <words>325</words>  
The symphonies had ended. <words>330</words>  
She had conducted them herself. <words>336</words>
