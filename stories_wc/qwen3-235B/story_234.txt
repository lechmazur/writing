<story>  
The gentle swordsman stood beneath the skeletal remains of a brachiosaur, moonlight filtering through the museum’s glass ceiling to glint off his unsheathed blade. <words>17</words>  
He was here for the sundial—a half-painted relic in the museum’s courtyard, its coded angles whispering secrets only he could decipher. <words>34</words>  
The empty matchbox in his pocket held no matches, only a promise: to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, a phrase he’d carved into its wooden lid decades ago, when he’d first realized he was a late bloomer. <words>63</words>  
His master had laughed then, calling him “faithfully unfaithful”—loyal to ideals, yet restless, a xenophile drawn to truths beyond his desert homeland. <words>84</words>  
Now, the orchard dog outside had fallen silent, its nightly barking ceasing as it always did when the stars aligned above the sundial’s fractured face. <words>110</words>  
The swordsman knelt, tracing the sundial’s angles with his blade, each line a map to a forgotten civilization’s understanding of time. <words>129</words>  
He’d spent years chasing fragments like this, his gentle hands calloused by both sword and scholarship, a paradox of violence and reverence. <words>151</words>  
The matchbox trembled in his palm as he angled it to catch the moon’s reflection off the sundial’s markings—a key, not to a door, but to a moment. <words>177</words>  
He saw it then: the universe was not vast, but intimate, a thing that could fit in a cupped hand if one learned to hold it lightly. <words>200</words>  
The dinosaur bones around him groaned, resonating with the sundial’s hum, as if the earth itself acknowledged his epiphany. <words>219</words>  
He had been faithfully unfaithful to his training, abandoning his clan’s wars to seek peace in ancient mechanisms, yet this—this was fidelity to something greater. <words>247</words>  
A gust of wind snuffed the courtyard’s lone lantern, leaving only the sundial’s eerie glow and the brusque affection of shadows pressing against his skin. <words>272</words>  
The swordsman smiled, a rare, sharp thing, and slipped the matchbox back into his pocket, its emptiness now a vessel for what he’d found. <words>300</words>  
He would leave before dawn, as he always did, a ghost between epochs, his blade sheathed but his purpose bare. <words>322</words>  
The orchard dog began to bark again, its rhythm a counterpoint to the sundial’s fading light, and he wondered if late bloomers ever truly finished blooming. <words>350</words>  
As he exited, the museum’s silence thickened, guarding the secret of the gentle swordsman who solved time with an empty matchbox and a xenophile’s heart. <words>380</words>  
He walked into the night, cupping the universe in his hand, brusque and tender as the world itself. <words>400</words>
