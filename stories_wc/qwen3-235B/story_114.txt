The apathetic summoner stirred the rustic coffee grinder for the third time that hour, its metallic rasp echoing through the shared dream recording studio—a cavernous space where empty frames hung like forgotten promises. <words>17</words>  
After the last breath of the dying god had dissolved the oceans into silence, the summoner had inherited a single purpose: to rebuild coral reefs with hands that trembled at the weight of hope. <words>34</words>  
They hated it, this task, this “destiny”—but the river wisdom had unfolded in their mind like a map drawn in water, insisting that even laziness could carve a path forward. <words>51</words>  
The frames in the hall, each a hollow eye, waited for the dream-studio’s machinery to hum alive, to stitch fragments of collective memory into something resembling a plan. <words>67</words>  
The summoner, enthusiastically lazy, had once believed apathy was a shield; now, they wondered if it was a tool, honed sharp enough to chisel through the god-shaped void. <words>84</words>  
They poured the coffee grounds—a bitter paste of ground obsidian and river silt—into a bowl etched with glyphs that pulsed like gills. <words>98</words>  
Matching the frames required no skill, only patience, and the summoner had none until the river wisdom whispered: *Patience is a kind of hunger*. <words>113</words>  
When the first frame flickered with the ghost of a reef, its colors bleeding into the studio’s fog, they knew the method was working—align the voids, and the world would follow. <words>131</words>  
The coffee grinder hummed a dirge as they fed it shards of old dreams, each crank of its handle summoning a flicker of coral, a gasp of fish-song, a breath of salt. <words>149</words>  
The dying god had taken the seas’ memories; the summoner would rebuild them, one lazily meticulous ritual at a time, their hands moving with gentle sharpness. <words>166</words>  
A frame lit fully—a reef suspended in amber light—and the summoner pressed their palm to its surface, feeling the ache of a thousand growing things. <words>182</words>  
They were not eager, not brave, but the river wisdom had taught them this: even apathy could bend toward renewal, if guided by the right kind of emptiness. <words>200</words>  
The studio trembled as the matched frames aligned, their edges dissolving into a bridge of light that arced toward the dead oceans. <words>214</words>  
The summoner stepped onto the bridge, the coffee grinder slung over their shoulder, its rust a reminder that even decay could cradle new life. <words>229</words>  
Coral sprouted beneath their feet with each hesitant step, the river wisdom unfolding not as a flood but as a tide—relentless, patient, alive. <words>246</words>  
When the last frame clicked into place, the summoner let out a breath they hadn’t realized they’d been holding, and the reef dreams surged into the world like a chorus. <words>264</words>  
They would never love this work, but love was not required—only hands, and a willingness to grind the dark into something that could bloom. <words>280</words>  
The studio fell silent again, frames now full, the coffee grinder still. The summoner slept, and the river wisdom curled around their dreams like a promise kept. <words>297</words>
