<story>  
The ambitious herbalist crouched in the shadow of the secret government bunker’s ventilation shaft, her fingers brushing the plain wooden clothespin clipped to her belt like a dagger. <words>22</words>  
She had spent years cultivating plants that could regenerate flesh, stone, even fractured minds, yet the bureaucrats who controlled her work only saw her as a tool—a dramatically simple solution to their endless wars. <words>47</words>  
The core concept of her research, scrawled in smuggled journals, was breaking free from limitations: roots that dissolved steel, pollen that rewrote memories, vines that thrived in vacuum. <words>72</words>  
But tonight, before the first dream of their “Project Eden” could take flight, she would vanish into the storm brewing on the horizon, a tempest that screamed like the relentless drumming of “not enough” in her skull. <words>103</words>  
The plan was fragile—a sudden storm would flood the bunker’s lower labs, forcing guards to reroute her midnight transfer to a higher-security wing. <words>125</words>  
She’d memorized the blueprints, the schedules, the scent of ozone before a blackout—but not the way the clothespin, carved by her first apprentice (a child who’d whispered *“You’re more than their poison”* before vanishing), would become her key. <words>160</words>  
When the storm hit, walls groaned; water seeped through concrete, and alarms blared as her captors dragged her upward, away from the drowned labs. <words>185</words>  
She let them shove her into the corridor’s chokehold, then dropped the clothespin. <words>197</words>  
It struck the floor and split, releasing a seed she’d hidden in its hollow—a spore from the blackroot vine, her first true creation. <words>221</words>  
Regenerate, she mouthed, the word a prayer. <words>232</words>  
Vines erupted, tearing hinges from doors, tangling guards’ boots, weaving a path toward the bunker’s forgotten east wing—a derelict biolab where the air still hummed with dormant potential. <words>267</words>  
She ran, the tone of the chaos hushed, turbulent, like a held breath. <words>281</words>  
Inside the lab, she found it: a dormant seedpod, the size of a heart, pulsing faintly. <words>296</words>  
The government’s scientists had never understood its rhythm, but she had—plucking it from the storm’s eye during her first unsanctioned field test, when lightning had split an oak to reveal roots that drank radiation. <words>331</words>  
Now, as boots pounded the hallway, she pressed the clothespin’s halves to the pod. <words>346</words>  
It shuddered, then bloomed—a tree in seconds, branches smashing the ceiling, roots drilling into generators, purging the bunker’s poison with every cell it touched. <words>377</words>  
She climbed, bark biting her palms, until she emerged into rain, the tree’s canopy cradling her like a fist uncurling. <words>397</words>  
Below, the bunker imploded, swallowed by its own greed. <words>408</words>  
The drumming in her skull faded, replaced by the rustle of leaves drinking the storm. <words>423</words>  
She had broken free, not with fire or fury, but with something plain, wooden, and small—a thing the world had overlooked, just as it had overlooked her. <words>450</words>  
The tree’s roots curled around her, regenerating, reaching for the sky. <words>461</words>  
When dawn came, the bureaucrats would call it a failure. <words>474</words>  
She would call it a beginning. <words>483</words>
