<story>  
The accidental mayor of Glimshollow, a lovably grumpy ex-tinsmith named Boran, trudged through the polluted swamp orchard at dawn, his boots squelching in sludge as the carnival’s last tents folded like tired ghosts on the horizon. <words>27</words>  
The monks who tended the orchard—pale, silent figures in moss-stained robes—had vanished weeks prior, leaving behind their dying charge: apple trees with blackened roots and waterways choked with iridescent algae. <words>54</words>  
Boran’s mayoralty had been a drunken accident, a town vote taken at a cider mill festival where he’d only meant to protest road taxes, but now the swamp’s sickness clawed at his conscience like a guilty verdict. <words>83</words>  
He’d come here seeking answers, though he’d sooner admit to liking the monks’ cryptic silence than their absence gnawed at him with the persistence of a toothache. <words>110</words>  
At a riverside cafe crowded with departing carnival workers, Boran overheard two mercenaries arguing over a clockwork beetle—a “water-witch’s toy,” one sneered, “worth a fortune to someone who knows its tricks.” <words>140</words>  
The device, they claimed, had been stolen from the monks’ shrine, its gears etched with runes that “sang to the tides,” whatever that meant. <words>163</words>  
Boran, who’d once repaired pocket watches for a living, felt a familiar itch in his fingers and a deeper, more inconvenient itch of hope. <words>188</words>  
He followed the mercenaries to their barge, swiped the beetle from a velvet-lined case while they brawled over rum, and fled into the mist-shrouded orchard, its tiny brass wings humming to life in his palm. <words>220</words>  
The beetle trembled, then split open like a seedpod, revealing a core of liquid mercury that pulsed in time with Boran’s heartbeat—a mockery of the monks’ “water wisdom,” he thought bitterly, until the mercury spilled into the swamp. <words>253</words>  
The transformation began at his boots: algae withered, black water clarified, and apple blossoms burst from rotting branches in a riot of pink and white. <words>281</words>  
Boran staggered back, awed and furious, as the monks emerged from hiding—no longer pale but luminous, their robes rippling like liquid glass. <words>306</words>  
“You’ve harnessed the beetle’s metamorphosis,” their leader intoned, bowing. “The swamp’s fate was always a question of listening, not ruling.” <words>334</words>  
Boran growled that he’d rather melt down the thing than babysit metaphors, but the beetle nestled into his coat pocket, warm and thrumming, and the orchard’s renewal whispered through the reeds. <words>365</words>  
By noon, the carnival was gone, the monks had vanished again, and Boran stood at the edge of a crystalline stream, watching tadpoles writhe in water clear enough to show their own reflections. <words>396</words>  
He didn’t know if the beetle’s magic would last, or if his accidental mayoralty would survive the town’s next drunken vote, but for once, he didn’t curse the weight of the title. <words>426</words>  
The swamp, in its reluctant awe, had rewritten its story—and Boran, grumbling, decided to readjust his grip on the pen. <words>450</words>
