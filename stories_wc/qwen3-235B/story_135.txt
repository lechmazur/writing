<story>  
The frozen harbor groaned under the weight of its mechanical caravans, their rusted gears stubbornly churning as they had since before the wheel’s invention, when ambition meant surviving the ice. <words>22</words>  
Eira, an ambitious brewer turned linguist, hunched over a flickering stove, her calloused hands cradling a plain metal straw—the last relic of her grandmother’s tavern, where dialects once flowed as freely as ale. <words>47</words>  
She’d come to document the harbor’s dying speech, a cacophony of syllables borrowed from shipwrecks and steam whistles, but the caravans’ inhabitants spoke in riddles, their loyalty to old secrets fiercer than the cold. <words>74</words>  
One evening, a child pressed a carnival poster into her palm, its paper yellowed and mottled with bruises that seemed to pulse under the stove’s glow. <words>96</words>  
Eira squinted, aligning the straw’s etched grooves over the stains; the metal revealed faint lines beneath the ink—a map of forgotten paths carved by caravans that once ferried not goods, but storytellers. <words>125</words>  
The bruises marked routes where dialects still lingered, whispered in hidden enclaves beyond the ice. <words>139</words>  
To withstand the journey, Eira bartered with caravan masters, offering her brews in exchange for passage, her loyalty to the lost words outweighing the frost gnawing her lungs. <words>165</words>  
The poster’s code led her to a cavern where a blind accordionist hummed a ballad in a tongue no lexicon recorded, his fingers spelling dialects through braille-like dents in his instrument’s metal casing. <words>198</words>  
She transcribed his song with the straw’s tip, pressing its metal against wax tablets, each groove a cipher for sounds that might otherwise vanish. <words>222</words>  
When the caravans’ elders confronted her, accusing her of plundering their ghosts, she invoked the map’s bruises, arguing that paths untraveled still yearned for voices. <words>250</words>  
They relented, offering stories in exchange for her brew, which warmed throats enough to loosen tongues. <words>266</words>  
Weeks later, as the wheel’s descendants rumbled inland, Eira returned to the harbor, her journals heavy with syllables saved, her straw bent but unbroken—a bridge between extinction and memory. <words>297</words>  
The carnival poster hung in her new workshop, its bruises now a constellation guiding wanderers to the enclave where dialects, like caravans, refused to die quietly. <words>324</words>  
Her faith—that language could outlast ice, rust, and forgetfulness—was peculiar, unshakable, a brew stronger than any she’d ever crafted. <words>348</words>  
And when the last caravan master closed his eyes to the frost, he did so murmuring a word Eira had preserved, its meaning lost but its music alive in the hum of the harbor’s enduring gears. <words>379</words>
