The irate smuggler paced the cracked durasteel of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, their boots crunching through glass shards left by long-ago looters, each step a jagged echo of the heart’s revolt against the silence that had swallowed this place whole. <words>34</words>  
They jogged, not for fitness but to outrun the memory of their partner’s voice, drowned years ago in a firefight over a cargo hold full of empty water canisters—motivation sharpened to a point where finding the hidden waterfalls of the planet below felt like the only antidote to cosmic indifference. <words>71</words>  
In their pocket, a single chopstick—blackened by plasma burns, the twin to the one their partner had carried—dug into their thigh, a physical reminder abstracted into ritual, its asymmetry a mirror of the imbalance they’d never reconciled. <words>107</words>  
They paused, breath ragged, and poured tea from a dented thermos into a cracked ceramic cup scavenged from a derelict shuttle; the leaves swirled in patterns that resembled neither constellations nor maps, but something closer to the jagged edges of grief. <words>143</words>  
The smuggler memorized the shapes—the way a clump of leaves clung to the cup’s interior like a barnacle to a hull, how a stem arced like a waterfall’s plunge—knowing this was the closest they’d get to sincerity in a universe that rewarded neither loyalty nor longing. <words>180</words>  
Their partner had laughed at such superstitions, but now that laughter lived in the static between stars, drowned out by the smuggler’s muttered interpretations: the tea leaves said *west ridge, third cavern, follow the condensation trails*. <words>214</words>  
The chopstick trembled as they sketched the pattern into the dust coating their palm, a cipher only they could read, its instructions as biting and precise as the truth they refused to voice—that this quest was never about water. <words>249</words>  
It was about the moment their partner had described such waterfalls in a half-drunk whisper, eyes alight with a hope the smuggler had pretended to scorn, a hope now fossilized in their bones. <words>283</words>  
The flight deck groaned, a sound like the planet itself exhaling rust, and they pocketed the cup, its dregs a stain on their fingers—brown and permanent as the memory of hands clasped over a smuggled crate of tea leaves, traded for bullets. <words>320</words>  
They would descend soon, guided by the leaves’ abstract logic and the chopstick’s silent insistence, driven by a sincerity too sharp to name, too deep to survive. <words>352</words>  
The heart’s revolt was never pretty; it was all elbows and edges, a refusal to let go of the idea that some things—some *people*—deserved more than the universe’s cold arithmetic. <words>387</words>  
As the smuggler turned toward the ramp, their shadow stretched across the deck in a pattern resembling the tea leaves’ swirl, a map of where the light failed, where the waterfalls waited, where love had once pooled and sparkled before it all ran dry. <words>427</words>
