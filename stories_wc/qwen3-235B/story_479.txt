The glamorous undertaker, Mireille, dipped her brass measuring tape into the cerulean paint, swirling it like a baton as she hummed a dirge once sung by her great-grandmother, the founder of her family’s tradition of “Eternal Elongation.” <words>22</words>  
She believed in the myth of ordinariness—that every corpse, every life, was extraordinary in its own right—but her clients insisted on being remembered as paragons of uniqueness, demanding their remains be stretched beyond natural proportions to symbolize unbounded legacies. <words>49</words>  
Mireille was fruitlessly patient; she’d spent decades digitizing her work into the Social Network Archive, a holographic vault of funeral rites, hoping to preserve her ancestor’s method: a ritual of measuring souls by their virtues, then physically elongating their bodies to mirror their spiritual grandeur. <words>82</words>  
As she mixed saffron pigment into the paint, she recalled her grandmother’s words: “We don’t just prepare bodies—we translate them into truths.” <words>97</words>  
Tonight’s client, a tech mogul who’d died mid-tweet, had requested his corpse be elongated to “span the digital and physical realms,” a nonsensical mandate that made Mireille’s jaw ache with the weight of her fruitless patience. <words>123</words>  
She draped the body in silk, unspooling the brass tape to measure his “virtue-length,” though his archive of online arguments yielded little to celebrate. <words>140</words>  
The tape, etched with runes from her ancestor’s era, glowed faintly—a relic of a time when death was a jubilant remorse, a bittersweet harvest rather than a sterile transaction. <words>162</words>  
Mireille elongated his form until his fingertips brushed the coffin’s foot, her hands steady despite the ache in her heart; she knew this art would fade when she died, another casualty of the myth of ordinariness, now twisted into a hunger for algorithmic immortality. <words>197</words>  
She uploaded the final image to the archive: a gilded figure, arms outstretched, bridging a pixelated void. <words>210</words>  
The comments trickled in—“Aesthetic!!!”—“Can you do my NFT?!”—and Mireille laughed, sharp and bright, as she saved the tape’s glow to her private ledger, a flicker of the old world nestled in the cloud. <words>237</words>  
Her family’s tradition had always been about translation, not preservation; she’d spent her life elongating corpses to teach the living how to see their own stretched, imperfect souls reflected in the dead. <words>265</words>  
The paint dried into a finish like liquid sky, and Mireille adjusted her sequined blazer, already drafting her next archive post: a eulogy for the last human who’d cared to be measured by virtue at all. <words>293</words>  
She’d titled it “Jubilant Remorse,” a requiem for the myth that ordinary hands could ever hold the weight of eternity. <words>307</words>
