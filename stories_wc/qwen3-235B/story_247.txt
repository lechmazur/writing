The weathered poet knelt in the blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests, his calloused fingers brushing the unmarked makeup compact half-buried in moss, its mirrored surface catching the dim glow of a thousand bioluminescent petals. <words>27</words>  
A power outage had swallowed the mountaintop an hour earlier, severing the hum of drones that usually pruned the labyrinth’s ideally messy tangle of miniature oaks and maples, leaving only the poet and his task. <words>54</words>  
He’d come to map the sacred flows—currents of forgotten names and half-remembered prayers whispered by the roots—but his compass was broken, its needle spinning wildly whenever he neared the heart of the maze. <words>83</words>  
So he’d resorted to the method he hated most: reading confessions scrawled on coffee cup sleeves, their ink smudged by rain or tears, each one a fragment of a stranger’s soul left at the trailhead. <words>113</words>  
One note had led him here: *“I lied about the fire. Forgive me.”* He’d grasped the sleeve too tightly, tearing it, and now its jagged edge cut his thumb as he pressed it to the compact’s lid. <words>143</words>  
The mirror rippled. Not his face reflected back, but a flickering map of veins in the earth, glowing cerulean and gold where the sacred flows converged beneath the bonsai. <words>169</words>  
Joyful dread tightened his chest—the same ache he’d felt decades ago when his first collection sold out, leaving him stranded between acclaim and emptiness. <words>192</words>  
He breathed deep, the invitation from the note echoing in his ribs, and followed the compact’s ghost-light down a path that shouldn’t exist, roots parting like curtains. <words>218</words>  
The labyrinth deepened. Shadows pooled into shapes: a woman weeping sap, a child assembling stars from fallen leaves, a confession that read *“I never wanted to be found.”* <words>246</words>  
At the center, a colossal bonsai stretched ancient branches through the air, its trunk split to reveal a hollow brimming with more coffee sleeves, centuries of secrets desiccated to parchment. <words>274</words>  
He grasped one at random: *“I loved them both. I chose neither.”* The compact grew hot, its mirror now a window into the tree’s heart—a pulsing core of ash and nectar. <words>301</words>  
The poet understood. To map the flows, he had to become a conduit, to let the stories flood through him without clinging. He pressed the compact to his sternum and exhaled. <words>329</words>  
Roots surged upward, weaving a throne. The bonsai’s branches arched into a crown. A thousand voices hummed in his ears, not words but warmth, the opposite of dread. <words>356</words>  
When the power flickered back, the labyrinth stilled, its secrets retreating. The poet remained, now as much a part of the map as the veins in the earth, his final breath etched into the bark of every tree. <words>387</words>  
They found his body days later, curled beneath the central bonsai, a coffee sleeve clutched to his chest: *“I forgive you. Breathe.”* <words>407</words>  
The compact was gone, but the flows had shifted, spiraling outward in patterns rangers would spend lifetimes deciphering—a testament to the messy, joyful work of surrender. <words>434</words>
