<story>  
The lucky gambler, Jacks, never lost a game, though the dust-choked halls of the abandoned schoolhouse whispered of a hundred forsaken bets gone bad. <words>17</words>  
He found the botanical diary on a splintered desk, its pages blooming with ink-drawn violets that seemed to wilt as he watched, a curiosity in a town where nothing grew but rust. <words>34</words>  
The core concept of the place—the corruption of power—gnawed at him; the diary had belonged to the town’s last mayor, a man who’d spun lies into laws until the soil turned to glass. <words>52</words>  
Jacks, typically never one for sentiment, pocketed the book; luck, he figured, favored those who dared to defy the gravity of hopelessness. <words>67</words>  
He lit a candle with a match struck on the diary’s cover, its flame flickering into a game of spin-the-bottle confessions he’d invented to outwit his own boredom. <words>84</words>  
The bottle pointed at a faded chalkboard, and Jacks laughed, confessing aloud, “I once bet a man his own shadow would follow him home. It did. He hanged himself.” <words>103</words>  
The diary hummed, its violets duplicating into thorns that clawed through the page—each confession birthing a twisted plant, roots drilling into the desk like guilty veins. <words>121</words>  
Jacks spun again, the bottle’s tip grazing a cracked window. “I’ve never cried,” he lied, the room shuddering as the diary’s corruption spread, stems bursting through walls in seconds. <words>140</words>  
The plants pulsed, their pollen a golden haze that tasted of lost bets and mayor’s regrets; power, he realized, was just a cheat code for despair. <words>158</words>  
He duplicated the diary thrice, each copy a mirror of his hunger—to win, always, even if the prize was a ghost town’s poisoned soul. <words>176</words>  
But the copies bled ink, their pages screaming in silent confessions, and Jacks understood too late: the game demanded a stake deeper than luck. <words>194</words>  
The schoolhouse groaned, the botanical plague spreading toward the horizon, and Jacks, cheerful in the face of collapse, lit another match. <words>211</words>  
“Final round,” he grinned, tossing the diary into a furnace of thorns, its combustion a pyre that painted the sky the color of wilted roses. <words>229</words>  
The explosion left him unscathed—a gambler’s right—but the town’s new flora now whispered his name, their roots threaded with the gravity of what he’d done. <words>247</words>  
Jacks walked, the horizon a fever-dream of green and ash, wondering if redemption was just another game you played with a loaded die. <words>264</words>  
He’d never know, not truly, but hope, like a crooked poker hand, was always worth the bluff. <words>278</words>  
The diary’s ashes spun in his wake, a constellation of corrupted stars mapping the unremembered future where nothing grew but the weight of a gambler’s sin. <words>296</words>  
Still, he whistled, a tune bright and hollow, because cheerful despair was the only bet left to make. <words>311</words>
