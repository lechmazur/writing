The gaslight chandeliers of the Iron Orchid Lounge hissed like disapproving specters as Elias slipped the rusted gauntlet over his left hand, its pitted surface rasping against calloused skin—a sensation that had haunted him since the day he’d pried it from the corpse of the knight he’d sworn to kill. <words>40</words>  
His street performance—a pantomime of duels and derring-do—had drawn crowds for months, but tonight’s audience of smoke-ring exhaling aristocrats and clockwork-eyed mercenaries felt different, their laughter brittle, their applause a blade-edge away from mockery. <words>79</words>  
Elias’s creative block had begun three weeks prior, when the gauntlet’s grooves first tingled during a routine, sparking fragmented memories of a sunlit coral reef, its jagged ridges scraping his fingertips as he’d clung to a sinking ship’s hull years ago. <words>118</words>  
He remembered now: the knight’s gauntleted hand hauling him from the waves, the man’s visor raised just enough to reveal eyes the color of storm clouds, a voice growling, “Survive, and we’ll settle this ashore.” <words>154</words>  
The promise had curdled into bloodshed, but Elias never learned the knight’s name—only that his own betrayal had been ordered by the very syndicate now funding his performances. <words>184</words>  
Between calls, Elias paced the lounge’s brass-rimmed alcoves, the gauntlet’s texture a cipher for guilt; each ridge a question, each rust-flake a confession. <words>210</words>  
His motivation had calcified into something sharper than revenge: he would offer peace to the knight’s heir, the lounge’s owner, Lady Veyra, whose smirk mirrored her father’s before Elias had slit his throat. <words>243</words>  
She approached, her corseted gown whirring with hidden gears, her gloved fingers tapping a Morse code of impatience against a champagne flute’s stem. <words>270</words>  
“You’re stalling, performer,” she hissed, her tone a blade sheathed in ice. “My patrons crave spectacle, not your brooding.” <words>296</words>  
Elias dropped to one knee, presenting the gauntlet—a relic of her house, stolen and reforged into his prop. “Your father spared my life at the reef,” he rasped, the admission scraping raw as open wounds. <words>332</words>  
Lady Veyra froze, her mechanical monocle flickering as it scanned his face, the lounge’s steam valves hissing like a chorus of serpents. <words>360</words>  
“A truce,” he continued, “to unmake the syndicate’s lies. Let us be more than their puppets.” <words>387</words>  
Her laugh was a shattered gear’s screech, yet her hand trembled as she peeled off her glove, revealing scarred knuckles—the same reef-etched patterns that marred his own. <words>417</words>  
“Father’s last letter mentioned a debt to a ‘nameless浪人,’” she whispered, the Japanese word for ronin hanging like incense in the smog-heavy air. <words>445</words>  
Outside, a clocktower chimed midnight, its gears grinding a dirge for old wars; Elias held his breath, the weight of the gauntlet suddenly lighter, as if the reef’s ghosts had loosened their grip. <words>482</words>  
Lady Veyra’s fingers brushed the corroded metal, her voice softening into something almost human. “The syndicate’s ledger burns at dawn. But know this,浪人: trust is a fire that needs tending.” <words>520</words>  
Elias nodded, the coded desperation in her gaze mirroring his own—a pact sealed not in blood, but in the fragile, living texture of a second chance. <words>540</words>
