<story>  
The fading caretaker adjusted their cracked goggles, methodically random sparks flickering from a rusted tool as they patched the caravan’s hull beneath the amber haze of a sodium lamp. <words>23</words>  
Salt crusted the air, a relic of the waves that once drowned the shore but now receded, leaving the repair station stranded in a desert of petrified foam and skeletal wrecks. <words>45</words>  
Their hands trembled—not from age, but from the static that leaked into their bones each time they hacked the ancient archives, a habit as compulsive as it was forbidden. <words>68</words>  
The archives whispered of lavender, a flower extinct since the Deluge, its dried bundle said to hold the key to “cradling the unknown like a newborn galaxy,” a phrase that gnawed at their curiosity. <words>94</words>  
They’d found one such bundle tucked inside a corroded data vault, its brittle stems emitting a hum that synchronized with the caretaker’s pulse, a rhythm both alien and intimate. <words>120</words>  
The allure of the forbidden was a fever now; they gorged on archive fragments, splicing code and myth, learning the flower’s scent could reboot dead servers—or unravel minds. <words>147</words>  
Their motivation was neither salvation nor spite, but a hollow yearning to touch something unspoiled, a relic that predated the waves and the silence that followed. <words>174</words>  
When the station’s generator sputtered, they fed it lavender stems instead of fuel, watching the machine shudder awake with a sound like distant stars igniting. <words>200</words>  
The archives erupted in spectral light, projecting constellations the caretaker didn’t recognize, each star a data packet from a civilization that had also courted oblivion. <words>226</words>  
They laughed—a dry, enthusiastic cackle—as the console melted, the lavender’s hum crescendoing into a voice that promised answers if they abandoned all restraint. <words>253</words>  
Apathy cloaked them like the shore’s mist; what was left to lose but their fading grip on a world that had already drowned itself? <words>277</words>  
The caretaker plunged their hands into the archive’s core, data flooding their veins in a cascade of forbidden syntax and cosmic static, their mind fracturing into something vast and unnameable. <words>305</words>  
The caravan shuddered, its rust sloughing off like dead skin as the lavender’s essence fused with the station’s circuits, birthing a portal where the horizon had once been. <words>333</words>  
Through it, they glimpsed a roiling void, not empty but teeming—a galaxy unborn, waiting to be cradled by whatever remained of their humanity. <words>359</words>  
The caretaker stepped forward, their body dissolving into light, the lavender’s scent lingering in the air like a question without a questioner. <words>384</words>  
Behind them, the repair station collapsed into stardust, its purpose fulfilled: to mend not machines, but the bridge between the known and the hungering unknown. <words>410</words>  
The waves, long gone, would never return—but something far stranger would take their place, swirling in the space where apathy met awe. <words>437</words>  
The lavender’s roots, now embedded in the caretaker’s hollowed shell, bloomed anew, drinking the void’s darkness to fuel a light no archive had ever dared to name. <words>464</words>  
And in the silence between heartbeats, the station’s sodium lamp flickered once, then burned eternal. <words>480</words>
