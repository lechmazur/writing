The gentle brawler, Callus, had always preferred fists to words, but the road demanded both when it spat out flat tires in the middle of nowhere. <words>17</words>  
He’d found the antique spice box weeks prior, wedged beneath a collapsed stage in a town that once thrived on protest songs and now sold its history as décor; its brass latch clicked like a secret. <words>42</words>  
The echo chamber—a cavernous ruin carved by wind and forgotten wars—was his detour, a place to fix the tire and avoid the sun’s glare, which seemed to judge his detours from the path he’d sworn to walk. <words>73</words>  
Inside, the air hummed with the peculiarly natural resonance of trapped voices: laughter, screams, a union speech from 1923, all fossilized in stone. <words>94</words>  
Callus opened the spice box, its compartments filled with powders he couldn’t name, and wondered if the previous owner had chronicled social changes the way he now did—through scars, not ink. <words>123</words>  
A voice behind him said, “You improvise like the rest of us breathe,” and he turned to face a woman whose face was a map of old burns. <words>147</words>  
She gestured to the tire, now inexplicably whole, its puncture sealed with a resinous paste from the box’s hidden compartment. <words>165</words>  
“The soul’s revelation isn’t a lightning strike,” she said, tossing him a wrench. “It’s the rust you ignore until the machine fails.” <words>189</words>  
Callus laughed, a low rumble, and tightened the lug nuts with the precision of a man who’d learned mechanics in prison and poetry in bars. <words>213</words>  
The woman vanished, leaving a pamphlet: *How to Mend What You Can’t Replace*. He pocketed it, then scattered the spice box’s contents into the chamber’s draft, watching the particles swirl like data. <words>243</words>  
Each scent—clove, ash, something metallic—unspooled a memory: a strikebreaker’s sneer, a child’s hand gripping his calloused palm, the way the road ahead blurred when he let himself feel too much. <words>273</words>  
The tire held as he drove into the dusk, the echo chamber’s voices now lodged in his ribs, a chorus of the chronicles he’d ignored while swinging fists for rent. <words>300</words>  
He pulled over at a crossroads, scribbled his first entry on a napkin: *“Strength is a flat tire. You don’t curse the road; you learn what the earth offers to fix it.”* <words>329</words>  
The peculiarly natural paste, the woman’s burns, the box’s whispers—all of it insisted that social change wasn’t a single verse but the pause between them, where the unheard hummed. <words>358</words>  
Callus kept driving, the brawling part of him quiet for once, his hands steady as the road improvised its next turn. <words>379</words>  
The soul’s revelation, he realized, was less about epiphany and more about carrying the right spices to season whatever came next. <words>400</words>  
By dawn, the antique box was empty, but the echo chamber’s voices had settled into a rhythm, a low chant only he could hear: *Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.* <words>427</words>
