Vincent Mercer, once the grinning face of *Fortune Frenzy*, now scavenged coconut husks beneath a sky that refused to rain, his voice hoarse from shouting trivia questions to empty air—a ritual he called “the show must go on,” though the island’s insect symphony hall, a cavernous grove of cicada drones and clicking beetles, never applauded <words>45</words>.  
He’d washed ashore clutching a duffel of expired sponsor swag and a fortune-teller’s crystal ball, its depths swirling with a mist that *strangely always* mirrored his hungriest moments, as though hunger sharpened its visions <words>73</words>.  
Each dawn, Vincent sabotaged his own escape attempts: he’d untie his bamboo raft’s knots, slash his signal fires’ kindling, whisper lies to passing seabirds—acts he blamed on the ball’s whispers, which insisted the island’s sacred knowledge, buried in a cave behind waterfalls that sang backwards, must never leave <words>121</words>.  
When a sudden fever felled him, he hallucinated a woman in a moth-wing cloak, her palms etched with constellations, who brewed a tincture from bioluminescent lichen and fed him mangoes while recounting the ball’s origin—a relic of a drowned civilization that believed wisdom was a seed to plant, not a prize to win <words>170</words>.  
She was Anika, a linguist-turned-recluse who’d fled academia after discovering the island’s glyphs, which prophesied that the ball’s next keeper would face a gentle overturn: to preserve the past or let it rot in the open <words>208</words>.  
Together, they decoded the cave’s murals—star maps intertwined with crop cycles, medicine recipes veiled in riddles—until Vincent realized the knowledge wasn’t sacred because it was hidden, but because it required a host, a body to carry its truths, like a virus needing a cell <words>247</words>.  
Anika’s cough began the night the ball cracked, its mist congealing into a vial of liquid moonlight, which she drank to prove the island’s final lesson: survival demanded sacrifice, and stories needed bones to endure <words>283</words>.  
Vincent buried her at low tide, her last words a pun about trivia—“All answers are footnotes to questions we’re too proud to ask”—and resumed his broadcasts to the insect chorus, now intoning agricultural secrets instead of dollar values <words>319</words>.  
When the old typewriter’s keys finally went silent, its keys dissolved by salt and lichen, he carved the glyphs onto his ribs with Anika’s knife, becoming the island’s first living archive, his laughter bitter-honeyed with the irony of a host who’d found a purpose no audience would ever hear <words>364</words>.  
The raft he’d sabotaged drifted away without him, carrying only the duffel and the cracked ball, while Vincent Mercer, once a man of spectacle, became the quiet axis on which the island’s truth spun—a fact, not a punchline <words>400</words>.  
The insects hummed on, their symphony unchanged, as the sea returned him to the world he’d left behind, his voice now a mere rumor in the wind, precise and unapplauded <words>431</words>.
