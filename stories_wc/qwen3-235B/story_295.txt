Bram the sellsword chuckled as he vaulted over the moss-eaten fence into the witch’s herb garden, his boots crushing thyme and feverfew beneath their soles. <words>17</words>  
The telescope strapped to his back—stolen from a starry-eyed navigator in a port town far behind him—bounced awkwardly, its brass fittings glinting in the waning light. <words>34</words>  
He’d sworn a withering vow years ago, after his sister’s death, to never again let doubt root in his mind; yet here he was, hunting a treasure buried by a family tradition of time capsules, its location scribbled on a map soaked in riddles. <words>71</words>  
The garden thrived with a willful chaos—lavender twisted into serpents, foxglove hummed with unseen winds—and Bram’s joviality faltered as he recalled the witch’s warning: “The treasure decays all it touches.” <words>107</words>  
Boldly reluctant, he pried open a rusted iron box half-buried beneath a mandrake’s gnarled roots, finding not gold but a child’s diary, its pages brittle, ink bleeding into ghosts of words. <words>140</words>  
A time capsule, yes, but one meant to preserve memory, not wealth—a contradiction that made Bram’s mind reel, doubt clawing at his vow’s edges. <words>163</words>  
He lifted the telescope to his eye, scanning the horizon for the witch’s tower, and saw instead his sister’s face reflected in its lens, her smile frayed by time. <words>191</words>  
The garden transformed around him: herbs withered, then bloomed anew, thorns retracting like secrets reconsidered, as the telescope’s magic unraveled the vow’s curse. <words>220</words>  
Treasure, he realized, was not a thing but a reckoning—the family tradition a plea to confront what festers beneath the earth of the self. <words>245</words>  
Bram laughed, raw and resonant, as he hurled the telescope into the air; it shattered midarc, glass raining like frozen stars onto the soil. <words>273</words>  
Doubt, he understood now, was not a throne but a bridge—one he’d burn behind him, though the flames might singe his own heels. <words>300</words>  
The witch emerged, her hands cradling a vial of liquid moonlight, and nodded; the garden’s mayhem had always been a mirror, its elegance in its refusal to be tamed. <words>334</words>  
Bram’s vow, once a noose, now hung loose as a cloak—its purpose spent, its lesson bitter and sweet as the herbs trampled underfoot. <words>364</words>  
He left the diary, penned a new note, and sealed the box, his contribution to a tradition that demanded courage not to hoard but to release. <words>394</words>  
As dawn bled gold over the garden, Bram strode out, whistling, the weight of the vow lifted, his mind a fertile, uncharted field. <words>423</words>  
Behind him, the witch smiled, burying the time capsule deeper, its next seeker decades hence, the cycle of doubt and deliverance unbroken. <words>450</words>
