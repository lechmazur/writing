The drone pilot, Callen, crash-landed in a medieval realm where castles crumbled like dried earth, his high-tech rig shattered against the cliffside observatory’s skeletal remains. <words>22</words>  
He clutched the dried herb bundle—a relic from his own world, salvaged from the wreckage—its lavender scent a cynical mimicry of the smoke-choked air. <words>44</words>  
The horizon glowed amber, not with dawn, but with the anticipated blaze of orchards soon to be fed to the ax; he’d heard the villagers whisper of the speed dating event held there, a desperate pairing before their world thinned to stubble. <words>83</words>  
Callen scoffed at the medieval absurdity, yet here he was, a man who’d spent years surveilling warzones from screens, now knee-deep in soil and serenity charred to ash. <words>112</words>  
He’d disseminated propaganda before—algorithms, not herbs—but the bundle’s brittle stems hummed with a different purpose: mercy, they’d called it in the old texts, a horizon always receding. <words>147</words>  
At the orchard’s edge, torchlight flickered over hastily erected tables where hopefuls rotated chairs, their faces hollowed by impending loss. <words>172</words>  
Callen pocketed the herbs, cynically hopeful—a trait survival had carved into his bones—and sat beside a woman with eyes like smothered coals. <words>199</words>  
“Looking for a partner in apocalypse?” she asked, her voice a blade sheathed in honey. <words>215</words>  
He slid the herb bundle toward her. “A cure for the ache of inevitability.” <words>229</words>  
She laughed, a sound like wind through dead leaves, but tucked the bundle into her sleeve. “They’re cutting the trees tomorrow. Says the lord of the valley wants progress.” <words>257</words>  
Callen stared at the orchard—rows of twisted apple trees, their roots gnarled around stones that predated the realm’s forgetfulness. “Progress,” he repeated, the word flat as a drone’s hover. <words>284</words>  
When dawn’s false light seeped across the cliff, he stood atop the observatory, villagers below clutching his herbs like talismans, their voices raised in a hymn of defiance. <words>313</words>  
The axmen hesitated, their blades dulled by the scent of lavender and smoke, by the sudden, unspoken question: *What if mercy is not a horizon, but a seed?* <words>345</words>  
Callen watched the first tree spared, its branches shivering as if exhaling, and felt the ache of a thousand unsaved wars. <words>369</words>  
He’d come to disseminate data, not hope; yet here, in the hush before obliteration, he’d become a smuggler of horizons, dealin in the arithmetic of grace. <words>399</words>  
The woman from the orchard appeared, her sleeve empty, eyes bright. “They’re calling it a miracle,” she said, wonder warring with the cynic’s sneer. <words>423</words>  
Callen turned to the observatory’s shattered lens, its gaze fixed on a sky his drones had never mapped. “Call it a test flight,” he said, and smiled—a small, scorched thing. <words>450</words>  
The villagers would plant new saplings where the old had stood; he would stay, not as a pilot, but as a gardener of unlikely thresholds. <words>476</words>  
Mercy, he thought, was not a line drawn in the soil, but the stubborn green push through ash. <words>494</words>  
And the orchard, for now, breathed. <words>504</words>
