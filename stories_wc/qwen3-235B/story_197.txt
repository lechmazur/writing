The high-altitude con artist perched on a branch of the Yggdrasil-like tree, its bark shimmering with the residue of forgotten lullabies, and peeled a fresh sticky note from the cluster clinging to their knife. <words>22</words>  
Each dawn, the notes rearranged themselves into cryptic patterns, a daily puzzle the artist unscrambled to locate the next piece of fabric scrap—mundane remnants stained with the ink of nightmares. <words>45</words>  
Tonight’s hush after the child’s last bedtime story hummed like a taut wire; the artist knew the void between sentences was where the collisions began. <words>68</words>  
They threaded the scrap—a moth-eaten swatch from a teddy bear’s scarf—into the loom of their fingers, weaving melodies only the tree’s roots could hear. <words>91</words>  
The core concept was simple: compose a cosmic lullaby to drown the screams of colliding nightmares before they seeped into waking ears. <words>114</words>  
But the method was a maze. Sticky notes whispered coordinates to other scraps: a coffee-stained napkin from a diner confession, a moth-wing fragment from a burned letter. <words>140</words>  
The artist’s motivation was not charity but penance; they’d once sold a dreamcatcher to a widow, promising it would spare her grief—only to watch the widow’s sorrow crystallize into a nightmare hive. <words>172</words>  
Now, as the tree shuddered under the weight of approaching chaos, the artist tied the latest scrap to a branch, its fibers vibrating with a half-note of the lullaby. <words>200</words>  
The nightmares arrived as they always did: a flock of origami crows, each folded from a child’s discarded fear, pecking at the fabric scraps to unravel the artist’s work. <words>227</words>  
The artist hissed, hurling a sticky note into the flock; it burst into a chord that scattered the crows, their paper wings dissolving into ash-flakes. <words>251</words>  
But the tree groaned—the lullaby was incomplete, its harmony fractured without the final scrap, hidden where the sticky notes dared not point: the hollow where the child’s last story had ended. <words>278</words>  
In the hush, the artist climbed downward, the tree’s leaves hissing warnings in languages of static. They found the final scrap—a baby’s mitten, soaked in milk and starlight—nestled in a knot. <words>308</words>  
As they threaded it into the melody, the nightmares surged, coalescing into a titan of mismatched teeth and lullaby syllables, its roar a mundane terror of dripping taps and distant phone rings. <words>337</words>  
The artist flung sticky notes like playing cards, each one a note of the lullaby, until the titan staggered, its form fraying into harmless shadows. <words>361</words>  
The tree shuddered, its branches bowing as the cosmic lullaby spiraled into the void, stitching the hush back into a seamless blanket. <words>384</words>  
The artist pocketed the sticky notes, now blank, and wondered if the widow’s hive still hummed somewhere—or if her grief had finally dissolved into the melody’s undertow. <words>410</words>  
Dawn would scramble the notes again, but for now, the nightmares slept, and the artist let their hands tremble in the pristine chaos of a world half-saved. <words>437</words>
