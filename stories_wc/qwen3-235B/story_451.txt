Lira clutched the baseball, its signature smudged but still legible—*To the survivor, from 2147*—and scanned the farmers market, where she’d hired three actors to reenact her fractured memories of a twin she’d never met. <words>27</words>  
The mountain peak loomed beyond the market’s chaos, its crystalline shadows twisting in the noonlight, a hidden location only the time traveler’s riddle had revealed. <words>49</words>  
Her motivation was survival: an apocalyptic prophecy had named her bloodline, and only by reclaiming her stolen identity could she outlive the date etched into the baseball’s leather. <words>74</words>  
At dusk, she led the actors up the peak’s secret path, where the air hummed with forbidden knowledge and the mountain’s unique quartz reflected not light, but fragments of possible futures. <words>101</words>  
The clandestine meeting was meant to be a rehearsal—until the ground split open, revealing a cavern glowing with the same eerie hue as the baseball. <words>123</words>  
A figure emerged, their face a mirror of Lira’s own: her twin, preserved by time travel, who hissed that the apocalypse was a manmade purge to erase their kin. <words>148</words>  
“You were never separated,” the twin spat. “You were extracted. The actors are pawns. Subdue her.” <words>164</words>  
The tallest actor lunged, but Lira rolled, hurling the baseball. It struck the quartz wall, fracturing reality; the twin’s form flickered between ages, revealing their true, ancient nature. <words>190</words>  
The forbidden knowledge crystallized: her twin had orchestrated the prophecy to monopolize time travel, erasing all rivals—including Lira. <words>210</words>  
As the cavern quaked, Lira grabbed a shard of quartz, its shadow sharpening into a blade. “I’m not your pawn,” she growled, subduing the twin with a strike that dissolved their form into stardust. <words>238</words>  
The actors fled, but Lira stayed, pressing the baseball into the cavern’s heart. The mountain shuddered, rewriting the prophecy’s date into oblivion. <words>262</words>  
When dawn broke, she descended alone, the peak’s crystal shadows now dimmed—a testament to the future she’d stolen back. <words>283</words>  
The baseball was gone, but her reflection in a market stall window held a stranger’s smirk: her twin’s memories, seeping into her mind like poison. <words>307</words>  
Forbidden knowledge had a price. She’d outlived the prophecy, but not its consequences—now, she’d have to live with its secrets. <words>330</words>  
The actors would never believe the truth, and the mountain’s path had vanished, leaving only the weight of choices etched in quartz and blood. <words>355</words>  
Lira smiled faintly, the twin’s cunning already sharpening her own. The apocalypse had been averted—for now. <words>377</words>  
But time travelers, she knew, never stayed dead. <words>390</words>
