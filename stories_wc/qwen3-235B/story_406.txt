The coy spy, known only as Lys, crouched in the shadow of the witch’s potion brewery, her gloved fingers brushing the loose button she’d plucked from the threshold—a relic of someone who’d vanished when the morning paper first landed on this empty porch. <words>44</words>  
The brewery’s windows glowed amber, humming with alchemical engines that twisted time itself, a secret Lys needed to bypass if she hoped to become a master of disguise and erase her past failures. <words>85</words>  
She’d studied the witch’s habits—a diabolically benevolent figure who brewed elixirs that healed nations but demanded grotesque bargains—and knew the owner wouldn’t return until the clock’s hands unraveled backward at dawn. <words>125</words>  
Lys slipped inside, the air thick with the scent of iron and elderflower, her boots crunching glass vials that repaired themselves as she passed, a side effect of the reversed-time core thrumming beneath the floorboards. <words>165</words>  
The loose button burned in her pocket, a talisman from the witch’s last visitor, a man Lys had once failed to protect, his coat’s button now a key to mending fences she’d burned years ago. <words>203</words>  
She bypassed a labyrinth of traps by mimicking the witch’s reversed gestures, her borrowed valor faltering as she reached the inner sanctum, where a vial of Chronos-Elixir pulsed like a trapped star. <words>241</words>  
Memories clawed at her: the man she’d loved, the mission she’d botched, the way his laughter had dissolved into ash when she’d chosen duty over trust. <words>273</words>  
The elixir could let her revisit that moment, but the witch’s journal warned of costs—*“To master disguise is to drown in what you pretend to be.”* <words>303</words>  
Lys drank. Time reversed in a scream of light, hurling her to the day she’d betrayed him, her disguise flawless now, her words precise as a scalpel: *“Forgive me. Let’s leave this life.”* <words>343</words>  
They fled, the past rewritten, but when she returned to the present, the brewery lay in ruins, the witch waiting, her smile a blade. *“You mended one fence,”* she said, *“but broke ten more.”* <words>383</words>  
The loose button had anchored her, but the elixir’s price was a hundred unseen ripples—a village erased, alliances shattered. <words>411</words>  
Lys knelt, the weight of borrowed valor collapsing into confession: *“I wanted to be someone else. But I’ll fix this.”* <words>440</words>  
The witch laughed, handing her another vial. *“Then start by undoing yourself.”* <words>458</words>  
As the morning paper thudded onto the porch again, Lys drank, her form dissolving into possibility, a spy no longer, but a woman unspooled into time’s raw thread. <words>490</words>  
The brewery’s hum shifted, its master watching the porch lighten with dawn, two figures now seated there—Lys and the man, laughing, their second chances stitched with paradox. <words>524</words>  
Mended fences, the witch mused, were never the same fence. <words>537</words>
