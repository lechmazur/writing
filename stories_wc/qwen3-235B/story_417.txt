The Victorian parlor, swallowed by the humid embrace of the jungle, creaked under the weight of its own anachronism; moth-eaten damask curtains fluttered as if sighing at the absurdity of propriety in a place where roots cracked the marble floor. <words>37</words>  
Eleanor, the unhinged zealot-turned-guardian of this crumbling relic, traced a calloused finger over the plain metal bottle cap she’d pried from the throat of a poacher weeks prior—a relic, she claimed, of the jungle’s unspoken agreements with those who dared trespass. <words>76</words>  
She’d been studying the parlor’s hidden ledgers by candlelight, their inked glyphs promising a theory of “theoretically playful” rituals that might pacify the vines strangling the estate’s west wing, when the confessional shadows of the room thickened. <words>113</words>  
A cough, wet and deliberate, echoed from the doorway: a figure in moth-gnawed finery, their face a mosaic of scars. “You’ve uprooted the wrong root, scholar,” they hissed, their voice a blade sheathed in honey. <words>149</words>  
Eleanor’s grip tightened on the bottle cap, its edges biting her palm—a talisman, a threat, a key. “The agreements don’t specify *which* root,” she replied, her tone balancing on the razors’ edge of defiance and dread. <words>184</words>  
The figure glided closer, their boots silent on the warped floorboards, and leaned until their breath ghosted Eleanor’s ear. “A whispered confession in a dark room,” they murmured, “is the only currency the jungle accepts for survival.” <words>221</words>  
Her pulse thrummed a staccato hymn. To find strength in vulnerability, the ledgers had hinted, one must become the wound, not the blade—a philosophy she’d mocked until now, her zealotry crumbling like the parlor’s foundations. <words>257</words>  
“I… I spared the poacher’s life,” she spat, the admission souring the air. “I let the *jungle* judge him. That’s why I kept the cap. To remind me I’m no better than the rot I fight.” <words>295</words>  
The figure stilled. Beyond the windows, the vines recoiled, their rustling leaves a murmur of appraisal. “Unspoken agreements,” they intoned, “demand equal parts truth and surrender. You’ve given one. Now give the other.” <words>331</words>  
Eleanor stared at the bottle cap, then pressed it into the scarred palm extended toward her—a trade, a truce, a tether. The room shuddered; the jungle’s breath withdrew, leaving only the parlor’s ache and the figure’s laughter, sharp yet strangely light. <words>368</words>  
“You’re still a fool,” they said, pocketing the cap. “But fools are what keep the agreements… *playful*.” With a flick of their wrist, they vanished into the green, leaving Eleanor unmoored, yet rooted—for now. <words>405</words>  
The ledgers would later describe this as the moment she learned to wield absurdity like a sacrament, her zealotry reforged not in fire, but in the damp, relentless whisper of a world that demanded both joke and sacrifice. <words>443</words>  
When the west wing collapsed at dawn, the parlor stood, crooked but defiant—a monument to the strength found in confessing one’s capacity to crumble. <words>470</words>  
Eleanor kept studying, the jungle’s new silence a question she’d spend lifetimes answering. <words>487</words>
