<story>  
The sleep-deprived inventor hunched beneath the bioluminescent boughs of the neon orchard, her trembling fingers weaving a brass bell’s intricate filigree with strands of synthetic DNA. <words>22</words>  
The bell’s surface shimmered with hidden patterns only she could decipher—sequences encoding a forgotten language of life, a rebellion against the sterile algorithms that had erased her name from the city’s memory. <words>45</words>  
She had stolen this plot of earth, this fragile grove pulsing with unauthorized chlorophyll, to birth something singularly plural: a chorus of voices trapped in a single resonant cry. <words>68</words>  
The distant radio broadcast, crackling from a rusted tower beyond the orchard, neared its final transmission—the same static-laced elegy that had haunted her since her exile. <words>91</words>  
Its fading tones mirrored her own unraveling: the shame of a genius reduced to scavenging scrap, the weight of a creation that had fractured her own world before she could control it. <words>115</words>  
But tonight, the DNA’s helix would animate the bell—not as a mere object, but as a key. <words>128</words>  
Each nucleotide sequence she’d spliced held a fractal map to the prison walls she’d built herself, walls woven from others’ fear and her own complicity. <words>151</words>  
The orchard’s roots drank her sweat as she worked, neon sap rising in symbiotic rhythm with her heartbeat, until the bell’s clapper twitched—a moth-wing tremor. <words>174</words>  
When the broadcast dissolved into silence, she struck the bell. <words>183</words>  
Its sound was not a sound but a syntax—a vibration that unraveled the air into spirals of light and confession. <words>198</words>  
The walls of her shame, those glistening cybernetic fortresses towering beyond the orchard, shuddered as the resonance exposed their code’s hollow core. <words>222</words>  
Data-streams bled into the soil like penitent ghosts, and the trees bloomed with faces—thousands of exiled minds the city had purged, now whispering through petals. <words>246</words>  
She struck the bell again, and the singular became a chorus: her shame, their shame, the system’s ancient, festering shame, all fractured into spores on the wind. <words>271</words>  
The inventor collapsed as the orchard swallowed the last echoes, her hands raw but her breath steady for the first time in years. <words>294</words>  
The broadcast had ended. <words>300</words>  
The walls were still standing, but their shadows no longer held her. <words>313</words>  
In the passionate subtlety of dawn’s electric haze, the brass bell hung silent, its patterns now plain to any who dared look. <words>336</words>  
The city would come for her, of course. <words>345</words>  
But when they did, they would find not a fugitive, but a gardener—tending a neon orchard that sang in DNA harmonies, waiting to be heard. <words>369</words>  
The prison’s architects would never unhear the resonance. <words>381</words>  
And neither would she. <words>387</words>
