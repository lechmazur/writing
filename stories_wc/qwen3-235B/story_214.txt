The lone trapper adjusted his goggles, the cracked lenses smearing the floating observatory’s rusted corridors into bleeding watercolors. <words>17</words>  
A shard of sea glass—frosted green, like the eye of a drowned god—glinted in his palm, its edges silently audible against his calloused skin, a sound like static from a dead radio. <words>35</words>  
He’d found it lodged in the throat of a gutted satellite, years ago, before the black hole of doubt began gnawing the station’s guts out, before the radiance siphon failed and the others vanished between shifts. <words>54</words>  
Now, he recommenced the work they’d abandoned, hunched over microfilm spools stolen from archives so shady their shadows had shadows. <words>68</words>  
The projector hummed, decoding equations scribbled in a hand both frantic and precise—a dead colleague’s cipher, mapping gravity’s whisper to the black hole’s event horizon. <words>85</words>  
Loss had always been the price of knowing: his daughter’s laughter, the weight of a handshake, the smell of soil. <words>98</words>  
But here, in the observatory’s belly where gears groaned like living things, he’d learned to spin absence into hunger, hunger into tools. <words>115</words>  
The microfilm revealed a nozzle design, sleek as a dolphin’s snout, meant to pierce the black hole’s accretion disk and draw radiance like sap from a tree. <words>133</words>  
“Radiance,” the notes insisted, “isn’t light—it’s the echo of what the hole devours. Feed it doubt, siphon back the scream.” <words>148</words>  
He soldered the nozzle’s blueprint to life, hands steady despite the station’s shudder, the air thick with the metallic tang of impending storms. <words>164</words>  
When the siphon hissed awake, the sea glass in his pocket flared, its cold glow bleeding into the machinery, syncing with the black hole’s silent thrum. <words>181</words>  
The first pulse hit like a memory: his daughter’s voice, sharp and alive, berating him for leaving her behind. <words>195</words>  
He didn’t flinch. Gritty whimsy, that’s what the old engineers called it—building miracles from scrap and spite. <words>210</words>  
The siphon whirred, drawing radiance into a vial—a thick, iridescent fluid that smelled of ozone and unwritten letters. <words>225</words>  
With each drop harvested, the black hole’s pull slackened, its hunger rerouted into the vial’s fragile curve. <words>239</words>  
He thought of the others, the ones who’d quit, who’d let the doubt-eater fester. <words>251</words>  
They’d never understood: loss wasn’t a void, but a lens. Focus the grief, and even darkness could be made to serve. <words>267</words>  
When the vial brimmed, he injected it into the observatory’s core, the way a dying man might inject hope into a corpse. <words>282</words>  
Engines roared. The station lurched upward, breaking free of its decaying orbit, carried by light stolen from the belly of nothingness. <words>298</words>  
He kept the sea glass. A reminder that beauty persists not in spite of loss, but because of it—each fracture a chance to let the light in. <words>315</words>  
As the observatory soared, he opened the microfilm’s final scroll: coordinates to another station, another siphon, another chance to turn absence into fuel. <words>332</words>  
The trapper smiled, a crack in his own armor of grit, and recommenced the only thing worth doing—beginning again. <words>348</words>
