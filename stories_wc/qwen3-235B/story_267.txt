<story>  
The mild-tempered guard pedaled his bike through the neon-drenched corridors of the Black Hole Resort, his flashlight beam skimming over velvet voids where light seemed to bleed away. <words>17</words>  
He’d always hated the job—its poetically bland rhythm of patrols, the way guests whispered about the “heroic sentry” or “villainous enforcer” as if life were a carnival sideshow of binaries he’d long rejected. <words>42</words>  
But tonight, the stray cats led him astray. <words>46</words>  
They emerged from alleyways like smoke, their eyes reflecting the resort’s dying stars, and he followed, weaving through dumpsters and rusted HVAC units until the walls narrowed into a throat of shadows. <words>67</words>  
At the labyrinth’s heart sat a blacksmith’s anvil, its surface pocked with burns and the faint shimmer of threads—unraveling, reknitting, as though the air itself were a tapestry fraying at his intrusion. <words>92</words>  
He dismounted, gloves brushing the anvil’s scars; a memory surfaced—his father’s hands, blistered and proud, forging armor for wars he’d never fight. <words>113</words>  
The cats hissed. <words>116</words>  
A thread snapped. <words>119</words>  
The guard staggered, vision flooding with scenes: guests dissolving into the resort’s foundations, their faces merging with the anvil’s iron, a voice murmuring that heroes and villains were just stitches in a rotting quilt. <words>147</words>  
He tore off his badge, the metal warping like taffy, and pressed it to the anvil. <words>157</words>  
When he lifted it, the badge was a moth-wing mask—a disguise to slip into the resort’s underbelly, where the cats’ leader, a one-eyed tom, waited beside a elevator labeled “ VOID.” <words>184</words>  
Inside, the walls pulsed like a throat. <words>190</words>  
He descended into a ballroom where guests waltzed with their own shadows, their joy a savage bliss, their hatred a symphony. <words>211</words>  
The guard-mask hid his smirk. <words>217</words>  
He’d never choose a side; he’d unmake the loom. <words>224</words>  
With a hammer forged from the anvil’s heart—its weight familiar, its edge hungry—he struck the ballroom’s chandelier, a fractal of crystal that shattered into a thousand threads. <words>253</words>  
The room screamed, gravity tilting as the Black Hole Resort’s secret bled out: it was no sanctuary, but a wound, a place where choices were devoured to fuel the false dance of hero and villain. <words>286</words>  
Guests fled, their disguises melting. <words>293</words>  
The tomcat yowled approval as the guard hurled the anvil into the wound, its impact sealing the rift with a sound like a star being born. <words>317</words>  
He cycled back through the now-silent alleys, the mask crumbled to dust, his hands blistered anew. <words>336</words>  
The resort’s brochure would call him a villain tomorrow, or maybe a hero. <words>347</words>  
He laughed, the sound blending with the purr of his wheels, and chased the cats into the dark. <words>362</words>  
The threads would unravel again—he’d be there, neither savior nor destroyer, just a man who refused to let the loom decide his pattern. <words>387</words>  
Above, the false stars blinked out, one by one. <words>396</words>  
The Black Hole Resort sighed, its walls knitting shut, already hungry for the next dance. <words>413</words>  
He pedaled faster. <words>418</words>  
The road ahead was bland, poetic, alive. <words>425</words>  
A stray thread fluttered from the sky, catching in his hair like a secret. <words>434</words>  
He didn’t look back. <words>440</words>
