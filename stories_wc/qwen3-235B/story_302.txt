The tuneless bard slouched in the steampunk airship’s dining room, his boots propped on a brass-inlaid table as poetry readings droned around him, the clink of cutlery punctuating half-hearted applause. <words>22</words>  
He’d stolen the stained manuscript three nights prior—a water-warped relic smudged with inkblots that writhed like living things—its cryptic verses rumored to tame chaos if sung correctly, though his voice cracked like a rusted gear. <words>50</words>  
Fiercely nonchalant, he’d shrugged off the captain’s threats, the crew’s sneers, the way passengers crossed themselves when he shuffled past, muttering twisted word-of-mouth legends about his past: that he’d dueted with a hurricane, that his lute strings were made of condemned souls. <words>83</words>  
The truth? He’d kissed the horizon of madness once, years ago, when his ship shattered on the Obsidian Reefs, and the sea whispered equations that unraveled his melodies into silence. <words>113</words>  
Now, chaos simmered in the airship’s belly—a rogue engine, overpressurized and growling, its pistons hissing like a thousand serpents. <words>132</words>  
The bard struck his tinderbox, sparks catching the manuscript’s edge; flames licked the ink, transmuting the words into a keening hum that resonated with the engine’s fury. <words>157</words>  
Passengers screamed as the fire died, leaving only his voice, tuneless yet thunderous, reciting the scorched poem—a fractal rhythm that mirrored the engine’s tremors, bending them into syncopated order. <words>188</words>  
He didn’t flinch when the dining room’s chandeliers exploded, glass raining like hail; his lute strummed a dissonant chord that absorbed the shrapnel, the strings vibrating with the manuscript’s residual heat. <words>220</words>  
The legends would twist anew tonight: that he’d bargained with the airship’s spirit, that his song collapsed three dimensions into two. <words>243</words>  
But the bard knew the truth—the chaos wasn’t tamed, merely seduced, trailing him like a shadow as he bowed to the stunned crowd, his smirk a mask for the void humming in his ribs. <words>274</words>  
He’d kissed madness’s horizon again, and it had bitten his tongue clean off. <words>289</words>  
The stained manuscript crumbled to ash, its purpose spent, while the airship soared into a sky streaked with dawn and diesel smoke, the bard’s silence now a weapon sharper than any melody. <words>321</words>  
They’d remember him as a madman, of course—a footnote in ballads sung by bards who never choked on their own blood to quiet a storm. <words>349</words>  
But as he pocketed his tinderbox and limped toward the engine room, he grinned, thinking of the next poem, the next chaos, the next kiss. <words>376</words>  
Brazen humility suited him; the world needed monsters, and he’d wear their crown gladly, so long as the stories kept burning. <words>400</words>  
The dining room’s gaslights flickered, the air thick with the scent of scorched paper and possibility, and the tuneless bard vanished into the belly of the beast, humming a song only the chaos could hear. <words>433</words>
