Elara adjusted her dive mask, the saltwater stinging her eyes as she descended toward the skeletal remains of the *Mourning Dove*, a shipwreck rumored to hold more than treasure. <words>22</words>  
Her gloved fingers brushed the corroded hull, and the water around her shimmered—a ghostly child materialized, clutching a rusted toy boat. <words>37</words>  
“You again,” she murmured, her voice muffled by the regulator; the boy’s lips moved soundlessly, pointing to a crevice where amber glinted like a trapped sunbeam. <words>55</words>  
The insect inside the resin—a prehistoric dragonfly—seemed to pulse, its wings frozen mid-stroke, as if caught between flight and surrender. <words>72</words>  
Back onshore, Elara cradled the amber, her grandmother’s voice echoing in her mind: *“Every relic remembers, child. Even hearts do, if you let them thaw.”* <words>91</words>  
The half-written letter beside her read, *“I’m sorry I couldn’t save you,”* the ink smudged by seawater or tears—she couldn’t tell which. <words>109</words>  
That night, she stood at the edge of the abandoned carnival, the shooting gallery’s peeling sign creaking like a ghostly invitation; her family had come here every autumn before the fire, before silence. <words>131</words>  
Stepping inside, she felt the air thicken—a flicker of laughter, the scent of burnt sugar, her father’s calloused hand in hers, *“One day, you’ll shoot straighter than any man.”* <words>153</words>  
The ghost boy appeared again, tugging her toward a dusty stall where a cracked mirror reflected not her face, but her grandmother’s: stern, fading, then gone. <words>174</words>  
Joyfully melancholic, Elara laughed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous dark; she’d spent years diving to outrun that shadow, only to find it clung like silt to her bones. <words>195</words>  
The amber grew warm, the dragonfly’s wings vibrating with a hum that unraveled the knot in her chest—a memory surfaced: her grandmother pressing the family’s carnival ticket into her palm, insisting tradition demanded attendance. <words>223</words>  
“Arouse the past, and it’ll drown you,” she whispered, but the boy’s grin was contagious, his spectral hand guiding hers to pull the rusted trigger of a forgotten rifle. <words>244</words>  
The recoil echoed, and the mirror flared—a younger Elara stood there, defiant, refusing her grandmother’s ticket, choosing the sea instead. <words>261</words>  
The shooting gallery lights blazed for a heartbeat, then died; the boy vanished, leaving the amber in her palm, now cracked, the dragonfly freed into the air as motes of gold. <words>283</words>  
Elara’s breath hitched, the thawing heart a slow ache—she’d spent her life rebelling against a woman who’d only wanted her to stay, to be seen. <words>302</words>  
Outside, dawn bled orange, and she slipped the amber shard into the letter’s margin, its insect a relic of stasis, now a symbol of surrender. <words>321</words>  
The wreck-diver ghost whisperer returned to her boat, the horizon a blank page; she’d never step out of her grandmother’s shadow, but maybe she’d learn to stand beside it. <words>344</words>  
As the engine roared, she glanced back, the carnival’s silhouette waving goodbye—a fleeting rebellion, a fleeting peace, the past finally still. <words>363</words>  
The letter, unsigned, ended mid-sentence: *“I’m here now. Tell me your story.”* <words>377</words>
