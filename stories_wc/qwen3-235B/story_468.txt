The mortician’s curiosity had always been a candle burning at both ends, illuminating secrets best left buried, but on the night when the sky’s ink bled into golden embers, they followed the rustle of revelation into the mangrove labyrinth. <words>44</words>  
The air hummed with the singing spirits’ dirges, a loudly serene chorus that seemed to mock the stillness, as their boat scraped against roots gnarled like ancient bones. <words>73</words>  
They sought dream journals—leather-bound and salt-stained—said to be hidden where the spirits’ voices converged, their pages holding the last thoughts of the drowned and the dead. <words>103</words>  
A tarnished silver bracelet, half-buried in silt, caught their eye; its clasp bore an engraving of a footprint, and when they slipped it on, the water around their boots rippled into shapes that vanished heartbeat by heartbeat. <words>139</words>  
The mortician knelt, imitating the fleeting prints, stepping where they had been seconds before, a dance with absence that pulled them deeper into the maze. <words>169</words>  
The spirits’ song sharpened into words: *“The journals are hearts unquiet, truths unspooled—why pry?”* Their voices were wind through芦苇, a question that prickled like a warning. <words>202</words>  
“Because silence rots,” the mortician murmured, their voice too loud in the dense air, and the bracelet grew cold, urging them toward a clearing where roots cradled a mound of journals. <words>234</words>  
Pages fluttered as they opened one—ink swam into shapes of faces, memories of storms and last breaths, and the mortician understood: these were not just records, but echoes begging to be heard. <words>269</words>  
But the footprints beneath their feet began to sprint away, frantic, and the bracelet seared their wrist, its tarnish flaking to reveal a core of blinding silver. <words>299</words>  
The spirits’ song turned to a scream of rustling wings, and the mortician ran, journals clutched tight, as the labyrinth itself seemed to exhale, roots retracting like fists unclenching. <words>329</words>  
At dawn, they stumbled back to their boat, the bracelet now dull and lifeless, the journals ash in their hands—their answers reduced to smoke that curled into the mangroves’ eternal song. <words>360</words>  
The mortician laughed, softly, wildly; revelation had never been a thing to hold, only a whisper in the vanishing act of being alive. <words>389</words>  
Behind them, the labyrinth quieted, its spirits sated by the exchange: a theft that was also a return, a chaos that tidied itself into order only if you listened politely. <words>420</words>  
They rowed toward the horizon’s ember-glow, the weight of unanswered questions a lighter burden than the ones that demand to be buried. <words>447</words>
