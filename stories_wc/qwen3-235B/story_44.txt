Zara, a feisty stablehand turned caretaker of the Celestial Junkyard—a space debris art studio orbiting Mars—polished a dented satellite dish with the grit of someone who’d once broken horses but now broke boundaries. <words>22</words>  
Her hands, calloused from lassoing runaway scrap metal, paused when a glint beneath a corroded thruster caught her eye: an antique oil lamp, its brass surface etched with constellations long erased from star maps. <words>46</words>  
“Preserve the old ways,” she muttered, echoing her grandfather’s mantra, as she rubbed the lamp’s grime away—a habit from her days cleaning horse tack, not celestial relics. <words>63</words>  
Smoke curled out, not acrid but sweet as burnt sugar, and a hologram flickered: a fox-eyed AI in a jester’s cap, its voice a playful warble. “Three riddles, three morphs. Fix what’s torn, or the lamp’s lore’s gone by dawn.” <words>92</words>  
In her pocket, half-torn tickets from a forgotten carnival booth rustled—a relic of her childhood, where she’d once fled a collapsing Ferris wheel, leaving others trapped. <words>113</words>  
The jester AI projected the first ticket: *“Where laughter froze, let light loose.”* Zara squinted. Amid her shuttle ride to the studio’s oxygen garden, she recalled the stable’s old ice mirrors, which fractured sunlight into rainbows. <words>142</words>  
She scavenged prismatic shards from a dead comet’s tail, embedding them in the debris. As photons struck the crystals, the scrap morphed into a kaleidoscope tunnel, its glow thawing frost from the garden’s airlocks. <words>171</words>  
The jester clapped. “Redemption’s first stitch!” The ticket mended, its ink bleeding into a new phrase: *“Where joy fell, lift a bell.”* Guilt prickled—she’d once cut a carnival bell’s rope to escape danger. <words>199</words>  
At the studio’s core, she unwound copper wire from a meteorite, weaving it into a chime. When solar winds strummed it, the debris rang, reshaping into a carousel that spun stories of forgotten riders in shimmering holograms. <words>229</words>  
During her final car ride to the studio’s apex, the last ticket glowed: *“Where shadows fled, feed the thread.”* She threaded meteor dust into a loom, weaving a tapestry that morphed the lamp’s smoke into a Ferris wheel—its gondolas filled with ghostly carnivalgoers, laughing. <words>259</words>  
The jester bowed. “The ancient carnivals live in your craft, not ruins.” The lamp dimmed, its purpose spent, as Zara realized her redemptive acts weren’t about erasing her past but transforming its fragments into something bold, quiet, and enduring. <words>289</words>  
She hung the lamp beside her brushsaddle, its glow a reminder that even in the void, redemption could be sculpted from what others discarded. <words>307</words>
