The shaky mercenary traced the amber pendant at his throat, its fossilized spider swirling like a memory he couldn’t crush, and listened to the street artist’s rumor: *“The cathedral’s bones hold what the fire couldn’t burn.”* <words>28</words>  
He’d spent years chasing improbable chains of whispers, each leading to dead ends or traps, but this one hummed differently—a reckoning in the static. <words>47</words>  
The collapsed cathedral loomed ahead, its shattered spires now canvases for murals of winged shadows and bleeding suns, the air thick with spray paint and the ghost of incense. <words>70</words>  
He moved carefully reckless, boots crunching through glass and hymnals turned to pulp, the weight of the place pressing like a held breath. <words>89</words>  
The slow fade of the echoing hour had begun—the sun bleeding gold through cracked domes, time stretching thin as the mercenaries’ old commander used to warn before missions went sideways. <words>114</words>  
A mural of a spiderweb, threads leading to a hidden alcove, caught his eye; the artist had signed it with a symbol matching the amber’s veining. <words>134</words>  
He pried open the rotting door beneath it, revealing a chamber where the air tasted of dust and forgotten names, and there it sat: a fist-sized chunk of amber, spider suspended mid-lunge. <words>164</words>  
His hands shook as he lifted it, the moment finalizing a decade of sleepless arithmetic—every bullet dodged, every ally sold, every sin tallied to this point. <words>189</words>  
The spider inside the amber was his first kill, a boy no older than the commander’s lies, fossilized mid-scream the day the mercenary learned survival required becoming the rumor. <words>216</words>  
He’d told himself he sought absolution, but here, in the cathedral’s hollow heart, he admitted the truth: he wanted the past to stop whispering his name. <words>239</words>  
A footstep echoed. A young artist emerged, spray can raised, eyes widening at the amber. “You’re *him*,” they breathed. “The one who burned the valley to save it.” <words>263</words>  
The mercenary flinched. That mission—children herded into trucks, orders followed without question—had been the first link in his chain of rumors. <words>285</words>  
“I’m just a ghost trying to fold,” he muttered, pressing the amber into the artist’s palm. “Bury this. Paint over it. Let it sleep.” <words>307</words>  
The artist hesitated, then nodded, their fingers closing around the fossil like a promise. The mercenary turned, light from the fading hour gilding his scarred silhouette. <words>330</words>  
He walked past murals of his own face, half-erased, and wondered if the spider’s trapped venom could ever unspool the knots in his gut. <words>351</words>  
Outside, the city hummed with new rumors already—of a man who traded ghosts for paint, of a cathedral that swallowed sins whole. <words>371</words>  
He let the wind take his name, finalizing his peace not with fire or blood, but with the careful recklessness of a man who’d stared into amber and chosen to blink. <words>397</words>  
The echoing hour dissolved behind him, its fade a requiem for spiders and soldiers alike, while the artist above began to spray a new mural: a hand releasing a web into the dark. <words>423</words>
