The morbid juggler spun a trio of rusted scalpels in the air, their arcs slicing through the dust-choked light of the abandoned laboratory, where glass vials of failed experiments lined the walls like tombstones. <words>22</words>  
His bent ruler, warped from years of use, clamped shut around a frayed journal left by the lab’s last occupant—a scientist who’d sought immortality and found only madness. <words>44</words>  
The juggler’s grin was a crescent moon of defiance, his craft a twisted tradition: he juggled not for applause, but to mock the silence that swallowed the lab’s forgotten screams. <words>67</words>  
He sniffed the air, where the scent of rare spices—saffron, myrrh, and something acrid—lingered near a shattered centrifuge, and laughed; the scientist had tried to distill joy into a vial, only to create a perfume of rot. <words>94</words>  
Consistently strange, he wore a coat stitched from lab reports and fedora tilted like a question mark, his eyes two flickering Bunsen burners. <words>114</words>  
He clamped the ruler onto a copper pipe, triggering a hiss; a hidden compartment spat out a single preserved rose, its petals browned by time. <words>136</words>  
The juggler juggled the rose, its thorns biting his palms, and thought of the cosmic punchline: the scientist had traded his soul for a formula, while the juggler traded sanity for laughter. <words>163</words>  
In the span of a shared smile—his and the ghostly imprint of the scientist’s last grimace—he hurled the bent ruler into a mirror, shattering both. <words>187</words>  
The lab seemed to exhale, the spices thickening into a haze where shadows danced in his peripheral vision, their movements syncopated with his rhythm. <words>210</words>  
He caught the rose in his teeth, blood trickling down his chin, and bowed to an audience of empty chairs, each one a monument to the traditions he’d unmade. <words>236</words>  
The scent of the spices clung to his gloves, a reminder that compassion was a blade, and defiance its handle—both necessary to carve meaning from the absurd. <words>263</words>  
When the final scalpel fell, he left the ruler in the dust, a bent monument to the joke, and walked into the night, laughing last. <words>289</words>  
His shadow stretched behind him, a second self that wept while he danced, the two of them balanced on the fulcrum of a universe that never explained its punchlines. <words>316</words>  
The lab’s door groaned shut, sealing the scent and the shadows inside, but the juggler knew the joke was never contained—it lived in the clamp of teeth on steel, the twist of tradition into art, the shared smile between fool and corpse. <words>349</words>  
He laughed louder, the sound ricocheting off the moon, and tossed his hat into the void, where it landed, improbably, on the head of a passing star. <words>376</words>  
The cosmic punchline was his now, a heirloom passed from madman to madman, and he would twist it, season it, juggle it until even the void clapped back. <words>403</words>  
In the span of a breath, he vanished, leaving only the scent of spices and a single bent ruler, humming with the memory of laughter. <words>427</words>
