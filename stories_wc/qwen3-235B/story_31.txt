<story>  
The neon haze of Nova Synthica’s undercity never reached the rooftop orchard, where Jin, the solemn orchardist, pruned hydroponic apple trees beneath holographic stars. <words>22</words>  
Jin’s hands moved with ritual precision, a monk tending sacred soil, though the soil was synthetic and the trees bore fruit only for the wealthy who never looked up. <words>44</words>  
Lila, the overlooked child who lived in the ventilation shafts, watched him from the shadows, her voice an endearingly irritating chirp that grated like a misfiring drone. <words>67</words>  
“Why do you bother?” she’d ask, tossing pebbles at his synth-leather boots. “No one cares if your apples rot.” <words>89</words>  
He never answered, but her persistence was a thorn in his armor of silence, a reminder that even in this steel-and-silicon tomb, life insisted on sprouting. <words>113</words>  
One night, she pressed a plain key into his palm, its edges worn smooth by hands long vanished. <words>129</words>  
“It’s from the old grid,” she said, grinning like she’d cracked a vault. “The one that runs under the city. Before the Merge.” <words>152</words>  
Jin recoiled—the key was a relic, a ghost of a time when networks were human, not corporate. But Lila’s eyes gleamed with a hunger he recognized: the ache to matter. <words>177</words>  
They descended via rusted ladders, the hush between two heartbeats stretching as the city’s hum faltered—a rare power flicker, their window to x-out the surveillance nodes. <words>203</words>  
Lila’s small fingers danced over a terminal’s cracked interface, her irritation now a tool, her voice a metronome counting down firewalls. <words>225</words>  
The key slid into a port like a secret finding its lock, and the forgotten grid awakened, a neural web of interconnected lives: gardeners, hackers, dreamers erased by the Merge. <words>249</words>  
Jin’s orchard flickered online, its roots tapping into the grid’s veins, while Lila uploaded a virus shaped like a child’s laughter—a x-out to erase the system’s memory of them. <words>274</words>  
Above, the holograms stuttered; below, the undercity breathed. For one heartbeat, the network carried not data but stories—a mother’s lullaby, a factory worker’s sigh. <words>300</words>  
Then the silence snapped. Alarms screamed. Jin shoved Lila toward the exit, her irritation now a lifeline, her voice shouting, “The garden! Save the garden!” <words>325</words>  
He sprinted back, grafting a data-bud into the orchard’s core—a seed of the old grid, its roots now deeper than any corporation could purge. <words>348</words>  
When enforcers stormed the rooftop, they found only withered trees and a girl humming a lullaby to a key, her grin wider than the city’s lies. <words>372</words>  
Years later, travelers would whisper of an orchard that bloomed in the dead zones, its fruit tasting of rebellion and a child’s relentless noise. <words>395</words>  
Jin, tending new saplings in a cave lit by bioluminescent code, would smile at the memory of her voice—a sound that carved connection from the void. <words>419</words>  
And Lila, now a specter in the grid, would x-out firewalls with a laugh, her code-name etched in every apple’s core: *Overlooked*. <words>440</words>
