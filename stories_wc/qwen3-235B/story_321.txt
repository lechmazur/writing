The infernal kitchen hissed and groaned, its copper pots boiling souls into syrup while the distracted guard, Jorran, leaned against a soot-crusted wall, his spear propped uselessly beside him. <words>22</words>  
Jorran’s eyes, bloodshot and distant, fixated on the partial spool of ribbon clutched in his hand—a remnant of his daughter’s last gift before the Silence took her, a Silence he’d failed to prevent. <words>47</words>  
The air smelled of scorched sugar and regret, a place where time pooled like curdled milk, in the space where an apology waits unspoken, stretching thin as the ribbon’s threads. <words>72</words>  
A dreamlike hourglass loomed atop the central stove, its swirling patterns of ash and embers taunting him; Jorran had spent centuries guarding it, yet only now dared to stare, his almost radical curiosity overriding duty. <words>101</words>  
Clarifying the hourglass’s chaos required displacing a memory—a sin—so he fed the ribbon into its gears, the spool unraveling to reveal his daughter’s face in the smoke, her voice a shard of ice in his mind. <words>131</words>  
“You looked away,” she accused, and the kitchen’s flames dimmed, the cosmic silence pressing closer, a weight only a father’s guilt could displace. <words>156</words>  
Jorran’s motivation crystallized: to outmaneuver that silence, he’d unravel his own soul, thread by thread, and weave a new past where he’d stayed vigilant, where she’d lived. <words>184</words>  
The hourglass shuddered, its patterns clarifying into a ladder of light; Jorran climbed, the ribbon burning his palms as he ascended, the kitchen’s roar fading into a single question: What is forgiveness worth? <words>214</words>  
He reached the summit and saw her—a child again, laughing in a field of cinders—and understood the price: he’d trade his eternity to unmake his failure, his radical love a blade through the Silence. <words>244</words>  
Displacing himself into her past, he became the guard who never blinked, who slew the shadow that stole her, but the cost etched itself in his ribs: he’d never know her forgiveness, only her smile, fleeting as steam. <words>276</words>  
Back in the infernal kitchen, the hourglass darkened, the ribbon gone, and Jorran knelt, his heart a hollow drum, the apology he’d crafted unspoken but felt, the Silence now a softer thing. <words>307</words>  
The abrasive calm of the kitchen held, but in its embers, a new pattern stirred—one where guards might weep, and kitchens might cool, and forgiveness might bloom not in words, but in the threads that mend a world. <words>340</words>  
Jorran stood, his spear trembling in his grip, and for the first time, the cosmic silence seemed to listen. <words>354</words>
