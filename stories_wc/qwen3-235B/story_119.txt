<story>  
In the seconds following a sudden revelation that the abandoned carnival’s rusted roller coaster housed not ghosts but living predators woven from astral light, Mara pocketed the antique brass key she’d pried from the ticket booth and fled, her breath sharp as shattered glass. <words>44</words>  
The key, warm against her palm, hummed with the memory of its former owner—a fortune-teller who’d whispered of unyielding compassion, a creed Mara now clenched like a mantra. <words>71</words>  
Sunlight pierced the cloudless sky, and she tracked its shadows, angling her path westward where the coaster’s skeletal loops cast dagger-like silhouettes pointing toward the tree line. <words>98</words>  
She moved with practiced spontaneity, a survivalist’s rhythm honed through years of astral projecting in secret, her body now a vessel equally adept at navigating physical ruins and spectral realms. <words>127</words>  
The predators—translucent, jagged things with teeth like fractured mirrors—screeched behind her, their hunger tied to the very light she weaponized against them. <words>152</words>  
Sometimes always, she reminded herself, a fragment of the fortune-teller’s riddles: *“Compassion is a compass, not a weakness, but it will cost you.”* <words>177</words>  
At the coaster’s base, a child’s whimper froze her mid-step—a boy trapped beneath a collapsed car, his ankle pinned by twisted metal. <words>200</words>  
Mara hesitated; fleeing meant survival, but the key’s hum deepened, vibrating with the weight of choices made in darker lifetimes. <words>224</words>  
She knelt, jamming the key into a rusted lock on the coaster’s maintenance panel, her astral senses flickering awake to gauge the predators’ approach. <words>249</words>  
The panel groaned open, revealing a lever that shuddered the tracks, jolting the car free with a screech that masked the boy’s cry. <words>273</words>  
“You’ll have to outrun them too,” she muttered, hauling him up as the shadows began to writhe, the creatures veering toward their new prey. <words>298</words>  
Together, they sprinted, Mara guiding them by the sun’s waning shadows, her pulse a drumbeat syncing with the boy’s ragged steps. <words>323</words>  
The key’s purpose clarified—a map etched in celestial logic, its grooves aligning with the earth’s tilt to mark escape routes only visible when light and fear collided. <words>350</words>  
Behind them, the predators dissolved at the tree line, thwarted by the forest’s canopy, their howls fading like forgotten hymns. <words>374</words>  
Mara didn’t stop until the coaster’s bones vanished behind pines, her body trembling with the duality she’d always balanced: mercy as both shield and sacrifice. <words>400</words>  
The boy handed her a pendant he’d found in the wreckage—a tiny hourglass filled with starlight—wordlessly thanking her in the language of survivors. <words>426</words>  
She tucked it beside the key, their combined weight a testament to the creed she’d carry into her next astral flight: that compassion, once chosen, becomes a muscle never lost. <words>454</words>
