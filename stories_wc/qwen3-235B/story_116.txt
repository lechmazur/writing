The dismayed minstrel clutched the broken watch band, its frayed leather a relic of a time he could no longer measure, let alone trust. <words>14</words>  
He sat cross-legged in the black velvet sky-lounge, a floating sanctum suspended above an endless city whose towers glittered like fractured glass beneath a moonless, ink-smudged sky. <words>31</words>  
The lounge’s garden secrets—a tangle of bioluminescent vines and whispering ferns—hummed with the weight of unspoken histories, a fitting chorus for his task. <words>47</words>  
His motivation was simple, if quixotic: to draw a map of the endless night, to chart the shape of absence itself. <words>60</words>  
The watch band, he believed, was a key; its fracture had halted time’s flow, allowing moments to pool and crystallize, visible only in the Polaroids he’d hoarded for years. <words>80</words>  
By studying the photographs—faded, smeared, half-alive—he excavated patterns: a streetlamp’s flicker, a shadow’s tilt, the precise angle of a wilted rose. <words>97</words>  
Each image was a boundary, a line drawn between what was and what might still be, and he traced them with a subjectively rational fervor. <words>114</words>  
The minstrel hummed as he worked, a laconic exuberance in his melody, as though the act of mapping could outpace the dismay gnawing at his ribs. <words>131</words>  
He’d once played for crowds who wept at his ballads; now, his audience was the sky-lounge itself, its walls pulsing faintly with the rhythm of his charcoal strokes. <words>150</words>  
One Polaroid revealed a bridge arching over a canal, its reflection a perfect mirror—until he noticed the discrepancy: the bridge in the photo had seven arches, but the city below had only six. <words>172</words>  
This, he decided, was where the night’s map frayed, a boundary between realms that demanded his attention, his pen, his penance. <words>188</words>  
The watch band’s break, he realized, had not stopped time but unmoored him from its tyranny, granting him the clarity to see the night as a living entity, not an absence. <words>210</words>  
He sketched furiously, the Polaroids arrayed like tarot cards, each a fragment of a cosmos that refused to be whole without his interpretation. <words>227</words>  
When dawn threatened, the lounge’s velvet dark resisted, as if complicit in his defiance, and the minstrel laughed—a short, bright sound—to see his map hold the night intact. <words>248</words>  
The final stroke was the watch band itself, laid across the parchment like a scar, anchoring the map’s heart to the very thing that had unraveled his certainty. <words>266</words>  
He stepped back, the garden secrets now murmuring his name, and understood: the endless night was not a void to fear, but a mirror to meet, unblinking. <words>285</words>  
The city below remained endless, unknowable, but his map was true—not of streets or stars, but of the boundary between loss and creation, drawn in the ink of his own resolve. <words>306</words>  
As the sky-lounge drifted onward, he slipped the broken watch band into his pocket, its fracture now a compass, not a wound. <words>321</words>  
The Polaroids, their purpose spent, dissolved into the air like smoke, leaving only the minstrel’s hum—a requiem and a lullaby—as the night stretched, boundless and mapped, before him. <words>343</words>
