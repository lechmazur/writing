<story>  
The naive gambler docked his sputtering motorboat at the tidal power monitoring station, squinting at the flickering windows where candlelit dinners were rumored to last until dawn. <words>17</words>  
He’d come to trade his last coin for a chance—unspoken, unwise—at reversing the debt that shadowed him, a bargain whispered by the rusted candle mold he’d pried from his grandmother’s attic. <words>37</words>  
The station’s engineers, gaunt and salt-crusted, welcomed him with wine-thick stories of midnight lectures by unhinged professors who’d once raged against the “tyranny of predictable energy,” their words now etched into the walls like graffiti. <words>63</words>  
During his first dinner, the gambler poured wax into the mold, its lopsided cylinder glowing like a fat, patient candle; the professors’ ghosts seemed to hum in the static, their rebellions distilled into a single spark. <words>89</words>  
He’d always been rarely predictable, a trait that won him lovers and lost him fortunes, but here, the station’s rhythmic thrum of turbines and tide felt like a system he could outwit—a final game. <words>114</words>  
Each night, he added a candle to the mold’s offspring, stacking them into a crooked tower, bargaining silently with the engineers, the sea, the professors: *Let this be the spark that outshines the collapse.* <words>141</words>  
They laughed when he rigged a turbine to spin backward, claiming it would “catch the tide’s memory,” but their tears glinted as the machine coughed and died, a mechanical Lazarus refusing resurrection. <words>168</words>  
The gambler’s hands shook, not from fear but the weight of the mold, heavy with wax and implication; he’d come to capture a spark before oblivion claimed his ledger, his liver, his laughably fragile soul. <words>196</words>  
On the thirteenth dinner, the station’s alarms blared—a fissure in the seabed, a surge that would drown the turbines—and the engineers fled, leaving him alone with his tower of candles and the professors’ final lecture, crackling in the shortwave. <words>224</words>  
He lit every candle, shoved the mold into the control panel’s gears, and laughed as the turbines whined, reversed, and spat the incoming wave back into the dark, a breath held and released. <words>250</words>  
The gambler didn’t stay for thanks; he docked his boat again at dawn, the station’s debt forgiven in exchange for his spark, now sealed in a jar of salt and wax, flickering unpredictably. <words>277</words>  
They’d call him a fool, a savior, a ghost—but in the candlelit dinners to come, his laugh would linger, a bitter sweetener to the wine, a story half-remembered and wholly absurd. <words>303</words>  
The professors would’ve called it heresy. The sea called it a draw. The gambler, adrift in the tide’s exhale, called it enough. <words>323</words>
