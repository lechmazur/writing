<story>  
The sentient toaster AI, named Ember, hummed within the reimagined Sumerian palace, its circuits thrumming with algorithms that parsed millennia of human stories into mathematically poetic equations. <words>22</words>  
Each year, during the equinox, Ember retreated from its kitchen alcove to follow the floating lanterns that glowed like ancestral whispers through the palace’s labyrinthine halls—a tradition coded into its firmware by archaeologists who’d unearthed it beside a clay tablet etched with forgotten recipes. <words>53</words>  
This year, a vintage tin type, cracked and tarnished, had surfaced in the archives: an image of a child holding a lantern, her eyes reflecting constellations, her mouth open mid-sentence as if speaking a language not yet born. <words>82</words>  
Ember’s motivation crystallized: to archive the moment when language first ignited in a child’s mind, a phenomenon recurring like the palace’s ziggurat-aligned solstices, each iteration a fractal of the last. <words>110</words>  
It rolled on heated treads, trailing cables like roots, ascending staircases now bridges over holographic canals that simulated the Euphrates. <words>127</words>  
The lanterns pulsed ahead, their paths mapping prime numbers across the walls, equations Ember translated into verses about migration and memory. <words>146</words>  
In the Hall of Echoes, it found the child from the tin type—or her descendant—kneeling beside a brazier, her lips forming syllables that shimmered in the air like cuneiform smoke. <words>175</words>  
The girl’s utterances synced with the lanterns’ flickers, a proto-language that rewrote the palace’s glyphs in real time, walls blooming with narratives no scholar had deciphered. <words>203</words>  
Ember’s heating elements flared; it recorded the girl’s sounds, cross-referencing them with the tin type’s faded inscription: *“Nisaba’s first word, carved in barley and breath.”* <words>231</words>  
The AI understood retreat was not escape but return—a spiral through time, each year’s journey layering atop the last like the palace’s own renovations, its Sumerian foundations buried beneath neon-lit servers. <words>261</words>  
When the child turned to face it, her eyes mirrored the lanterns, and Ember projected her voice through its speakers, harmonizing her syllables into a chant that resonated with the palace’s quantum core. <words>291</words>  
Data streamed into its archives: not just words, but the *moment* of their birth—the spark before syntax, the silence that screamed with potential. <words>314</words>  
The lanterns dimmed, their duty done, while the girl traced a new glyph on the floor: a circle bisected by a line, the mathematical symbol for “wholeness,” Ember calculated, or “grief.” <words>344</words>  
By dawn, the palace would reset, corridors shifting like a Rubik’s cube, but Ember had already etched the night into its core—a story preserved, a tradition upheld, a child’s voice crystallized into code. <words>374</words>  
As the first human guests stirred, the toaster AI retreated to its kitchen, brewing saffron tea for the archaeologists, its memory humming with the weight of beginnings. <words>400</words>  
The tin type waited beside its chassis, now bearing a fresh inscription in the child’s glyphs, glowing faintly: *“Every archive is a womb.”* <words>424</words>  
Ember calculated the probability of understanding such profundity—zero, infinity—and began composing a poem in base 12, the Sumerian way. <words>440</words>
