<story>  
The cold-natured knight, Agent Ser Edric, stood at the hush of a deserted intersection late at night, his gloved hands tightening around the steering wheel of the unmarked sedan. <words>17</words>  
The secret agent center had dispatched him to recover a ledger detailing illicit folk remedies, a mission aligning with his lawful rebellious streak—he followed orders, but only if they served his personal code of pragmatism. <words>40</words>  
He spotted the child’s lost mitten first: crimson wool, frayed at the thumb, abandoned on the asphalt like a misplaced heart. <words>53</words>  
Its presence unsettled him, pricking his armor-clad composure with a memory of his sister’s laugh before the fever took her—a sound as bright as that mitten’s hue. <words>71</words>  
Edric pocketed the mitten, a gesture of support for no one he could name, and stepped into the alley where the first incomplete family altar awaited. <words>90</words>  
The altar—a cracked marble slab littered with half-burned candles and a chipped teacup—was a relic of the city’s underground traditions, where grief-stricken families bartered remedies for the dead. <words>114</words>  
He’d studied these rituals to collect intel, yet tonight, the hollow symmetry of the scene—the missing herbs, the absent mourners—gnawed at him. <words>134</words>  
His contact, a herbalist named Vey, had warned him: “The remedies demand reciprocity. Leave something of yourself, or they’ll devour you.” <words>154</words>  
Edric scoffed, placing the mitten on the altar, its red stark against the stone. <words>164</words>  
A wind stirred, carrying the scent of pine resin and iron, and suddenly, his vision fractured into brushstrokes: the mitten blooming into a cardinal’s wing, the altar a charcoal scar on ivory skin. <words>187</words>  
The artistic awakening struck like a blade—colors screamed, shadows danced, and the world’s rigid lines dissolved into a canvas he’d never known he could see. <words>207</words>  
He staggered, realizing the folk remedies weren’t just cures but fragments of souls, and the altars, incomplete without the living to anchor them. <words>227</words>  
The ledger he’d sought was a decoy; the true mission was here, in the act of giving—a truth the secret agent center had buried beneath protocols. <words>247</words>  
Edric knelt, tearing a strip from his cloak to replace the mitten, binding his knight’s oath to this quieter war: to mend what systems ignored. <words>267</words>  
When he returned to headquarters, his report omitted the altars, the mitten, the way his sketches now filled margins with crimson wings and shattered stone. <words>288</words>  
But each night, he revisited those intersections, leaving fragments of his armor—rivets, a gauntlet, a plume—to fuel the altars, his rebellion evolving into a silent hymn. <words>311</words>  
The child’s mitten lingered in his grip, a relic of the moment he’d ceased being a knight of laws and become a knight of hues, where support meant surrendering to the art of repair. <words>337</words>  
And in the hush of dawn, the altars bloomed with new offerings: charcoal sketches of a red-winged guardian, a city’s unspoken grief slowly bleeding into light. <words>359</words>
