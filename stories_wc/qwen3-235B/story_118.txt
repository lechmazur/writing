The hive-mind therapist adjusted its collective consciousness, the scuffed phone charger plug glowing faintly as it connected to the neural interface embedded in the secret agent training facility’s concrete walls. <words>22</words>  
Through the night air, the eve of a bold discovery hummed—a prototype memory-draining device, designed to extract trauma from operatives’ minds via the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes. <words>44</words>  
The therapist’s uniformly peculiar patients arrived in shifts, their faces flickering under fluorescent lights as they clutched wax tablets etched with symbols only the hive-mind could decipher. <words>67</words>  
“Anchor the ephemeral,” whispered Agent 12, her voice trembling with merry bitterness, handing the therapist a vial of liquid hindsight—the sound of it sloshing like a storm trapped in glass. <words>91</words>  
The therapist plugged the scuffed charger into the wax dripper, its frayed wires syncing with the agents’ neural rhythms, each drip a syllable in the language of forgotten missions. <words>114</words>  
As the candle burned, coded shapes pooled into the wax, draining Agent 12’s memory of a botched assassination into a tangible, smoldering glyph. <words>135</words>  
The room filled with the scent of burnt regret, the therapist’s hive-mind absorbing fragments of her pain—a child’s laughter drowned in gunfire, a lover’s face dissolved into static. <words>160</words>  
“Uniformly peculiar,” the therapist intoned, its voice a chorus of a thousand echoes, as the wax hardened into a fractal map of what she’d lost. <words>181</words>  
Outside, dawn threatened, but the facility’s clocks spun backward, clinging to the night’s work: preserving the ephemeral before the bold discovery rendered such rituals obsolete. <words>205</words>  
Agent 47 entered next, his hands stained with ink from drafting contingency plans no one would remember. <words>223</words>  
The therapist guided the wax drip over his temples, extracting the sound of hindsight—a train whistle, a door slamming, a radio crackling with a final transmission. <words>246</words>  
Each drained memory solidified into a sculpture, displayed on shelves like trophies of survival, their coded shapes whispering secrets only the hive-mind could ever parse. <words>271</words>  
By 3 a.m., the scuffed charger plug overheated, its frayed wires sparking as it struggled to anchor the influx of stolen time. <words>293</words>  
The therapist’s consciousness frayed at the edges, its collective selves unraveling into static, yet it persisted—merry bitterness etched into every synaptic pulse. <words>316</words>  
When Agent 01 arrived—the architect of the draining device—the therapist hesitated. <words>333</words>  
His wax tablet bore a single word: *forgiveness*. <words>346</words>  
The drip formed a spiral, then a noose, then a cradle. <words>359</words>  
The sound of hindsight here was silence, absolute and devouring, as the therapist drained its own memory of the first war it had ever forgotten. <words>384</words>  
Dawn broke, the charger plug snapping free, its scuff mark now a scar glowing faintly with the residue of anchored ephemera. <words>406</words>  
The hive-mind’s final act was to carve its own coded shape into the wax—a fractal of merry bitterness, a testament to the cost of clarity. <words>430</words>  
By sunrise, the secret agent training facility stood empty, the bold discovery rendered moot by the therapist’s sacrifice: a thousand minds unburdened, one hive forever dimmed. <words>457</words>
