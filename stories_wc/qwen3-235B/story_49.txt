<story>  
The lukewarm mage knelt on the pocked regolith of the lunar base, their cloak fraying at the edges like the torn doormat corner clutched in their gloved hand—a relic of a home long since vaporized by the first clashing factions that carved the moon’s scarred crust into warring territories. <words>47</words>  
They had always been loyally peculiar, the kind of mage who whispered to shadows instead of summoning flames, and now those shadows—ephemeral silhouettes cast by the swirling stage fog that choked the base’s crumbling amphitheater—were rising again, as if the past refused to stay buried. <words>94</words>  
The hush before someone opened a private journal hung thick in the air, a silence that felt like a held breath, like the pause between the decision to fight and the first strike. <words>125</words>  
The mage traced the doormat’s frayed threads, each fiber a mimicry of the cracks in the lunar soil, the fractures in their own resolve; they had clung to echoes of the war that had burned their family to ash, echoes that now coalesced into the figures emerging from the fog—soldiers from both sides, their forms flickering like half-remembered nightmares. <words>172</words>  
These silhouettes clashed soundlessly, blades of condensed light slicing through one another, their movements a grotesque ballet that mirrored the mage’s own paralysis, the guilt that had kept them alive while others perished. <words>209</words>  
The journal, hidden beneath a shattered viewport, was said to belong to the commander who had ordered the base’s destruction decades ago—a man whose final words might absolve or condemn, but the mage cared less for his legacy than for the future they ached to paint, one where fear dissolved like fog under a merciless sun. <words>257</words>  
They stood, the doormat slipping into their satchel beside chalks and charcoal, tools of a different craft than war, and stepped into the swirling phantoms, their hands weaving sigils that bent the light into new shapes: not weapons, but bridges, a city rising in the negative space between combatants. <words>304</words>  
The silhouettes faltered, their clash dissolving into stillness as the mage’s illusions superimposed a tomorrow unmarred by vengeance—a market where enemies traded stories, a child’s laughter echoing where artillery had once screamed. <words>346</words>  
The journal’s clasp clicked open behind them, releasing a sigh of paper and time, but the mage did not turn; they knew the words inside would mirror the scene they’d conjured, a pact between ghosts and the living to let go. <words>383</words>  
When the first genuine sunrise in years breached the horizon, its light revealed no ruins, only the faint charcoal sketch of a world rebuilding itself, and the mage, peculiar still, allowed themself a single loyal tear for the future they had finally pulled from the ashes of the echo. <words>427</words>
