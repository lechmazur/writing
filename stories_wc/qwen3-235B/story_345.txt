The lapsed priest jogged through the labyrinth orchard, his breath fogging the dull radiance of dawn, each step crunching snow that glimmered like shattered glass beneath bean stalks spiraling into clouds. <words>22</words>  
He clutched an abacus with three missing beads, its worn wood slick with frost, counting each bead as he ran—a ritual to track not sins, but the years he’d squandered in silence, complacent as the world unraveled. <words>45</words>  
The snow patterns guided him, weaving paths only he could decipher, their curves and eddies whispering directions as if the earth itself conspired to aid his escape from fate’s design. <words>67</words>  
Once, he’d preached that surrender to divine will was peace; now, he spat at peace, knowing complacency was a thief that stole choice until only hollow bones remained. <words>89</words>  
A gust hissed through stalks, scattering blossoms like paper scraps, and he stumbled, the abacus slipping—its final bead, cracked and jagged, lodged in a crevice of his thumb, a relic of the altar he’d abandoned. <words>114</words>  
He’d left the cloth when a widow’s tears at her husband’s grave mirrored his own unanswered grief, her whisper—“Why must we accept what we cannot change?”—gnawing at his marrow until faith curdled into doubt. <words>143</words>  
The labyrinth twisted, snow thickening, and he veered left, following a spiral pattern etched by winds—a path that mirrored the abacus’s broken symmetry, its gaps where answers should’ve been. <words>167</words>  
His legs burned, lungs raw, yet he pressed on, unapologetically confused, no longer certain if he fled fate or chased a delusion of mastery over the chaos he’d once called God’s plan. <words>191</words>  
A clearing erupted ahead: a tree gnarled and colossal, its trunk split into a doorway, roots cradling a pool of black water reflecting not the sky, but a void where stars drowned. <words>215</words>  
The snow patterns ended here, converging into a single line pointing downward, into the water, into the throat of the bean stalk’s hollow heart—a choice between sinking or ascending. <words>238</words>  
He dropped the abacus; beads scattered, three vanishing into the snow, and he laughed, raw and bright, for the first time grasping the price of complacency: it demanded surrender, but never offered truth. <words>263</words>  
The priest stepped into the void, his shadow dissolving, the labyrinth’s hush rupturing as the stalk shuddered, roots exhaling a breath that carried the scent of burnt offerings and forgotten prayers. <words>287</words>  
Above, clouds fractured, spilling light not warm but searing, a radiance that stripped illusions, leaving him bare—not saved, not damned, but moving, finally moving, beyond the design he’d once etched into another’s palm. <words>312</words>  
The snow fell anew, patterns reforming, and somewhere, a widow smiled at a sky that no longer answered. <words>325</words>
