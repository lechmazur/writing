The skeptical minstrel, Luthar, picked through the rusted gears of the abandoned disappearing ink factory, his slingshot dangling from a calloused hand like a mockery of a hero’s sword. <words>17</words>  
Midday sun filtered through cracked glass, illuminating dust that swirled in the hush of an empty mailbox—a silence so profound it seemed the factory itself was holding its breath. <words>34</words>  
He’d come seeking legends: dragon-scale armor scraps said to repel even time’s decay, rumored to glint where ink once boiled in vats. <words>49</words>  
What he found instead was a trickster grinning from a steam pipe, his teeth sharp as the hiss of the ancient vent behind him. <words>63</words>  
“Seeking relics to sell, songbird?” the immortal drawled, his voice a serpentine melody. “Or to out-scheme a god?” <words>76</words>  
Luthar snorted. “Gods are bad business. But you? You’re just another charlatan.” His slingshot twanged, a pebble arcing toward the trickster—who dissolved into smoke, re-forming atop a corroded catwalk. <words>95</words>  
The trickster laughed. “Generosity is your gambit, minstrel. Reckless. Admirable. But how will you give when you own nothing?” <words>110</words>  
A dragon-scale scrap glinted suddenly in Luthar’s palm, torn from the shadows—a lie of physics, impossibly plausible. <words>122</words>  
He’d scoffed at myths, yet here it was: a shard of armor, warm as stolen breath, humming with a heat that defied logic. <words>136</words>  
The trickster’s eyes narrowed. “Ah. You’ll fling that via steam vent, yes? A poetic end—magic shattered by machinery’s last gasp.” <words>151</words>  
Luthar didn’t blink. “You’re here to erase the factory’s ink—its power to unwrite history. Why let mortals remember your pranks when you can scrub the ledger clean?” <words>168</words>  
The vent hissed louder, a serpent coiling. The minstrel’s grin turned ferocious. “But here’s the joke: I don’t need to believe in your game to play it.” <words>184</words>  
He slung the dragon-scale shard toward the vent’s maw, the hiss erupting into a roar as pressurized steam hurled the scrap like a comet. <words>199</words>  
It struck the ink vats’ core—a detonation of iridescent gloom, the walls shuddering as the trickster screamed, “*You can’t unmake me!*” <words>214</words>  
“Not unmaking,” Luthar coughed, ink-blackened fingers clutching his slingshot. “Just… revising.” The armor scrap had ignited the ink’s paradox: to erase the unerasable. <words>230</words>  
The trickster flickered, his form fraying at the edges. “Why sacrifice the scale? A king’s ransom!” <words>242</words>  
“Generosity’s a hustle too,” Luthar said, wiping soot from his face. “But you wouldn’t know—your schemes are *so* predictable.” <words>258</words>  
The factory groaned; the vats collapsed inward, swallowing the trickster’s laughter into a void of his own design. <words>272</words>  
As the dust settled, Luthar pocketed a vial of surviving ink—its glow mocking, irreverent. He’d sell it, of course. Every miracle needed an audience. <words>288</words>  
The minstrel strolled into the noon haze, the empty mailbox’s silence now a dirge for a god and a requiem for a minstrel who’d learned the best lies are those that save the world. <words>306</words>
