<story>  
The hesitant swordsman stood at the edge of the frigid tundra orchard, his blade sheathed, eyes fixed on the geothermal vents exhaling plumes of vapor into the amber twilight. <words>17</words>  
He clutched a blank postcard, its emptiness a mirror to his doubt, though tradition demanded he bridge the worlds before the final piece of evidence—the orchard’s last apple—was filed away in the archives of the Ascendant Court. <words>44</words>  
The method was etched in his bones: follow the hermit crabs, whose ceaseless migrations between shells had guided his ancestors to weave realms together, yet his naturally awkward gait betrayed him, each step a stumble against the ice-crusted roots. <words>75</words>  
When he reached the largest vent, its heat humming a half-remembered hymn, the crabs emerged en masse, their tiny claws tapping a rhythm only the dead could decipher. <words>99</words>  
He knelt, tracing the postcard’s edge along the vent’s rim, and whispered the oath to restore the old systems—the orchard’s forgotten pact with the underworld—before plunging into the steam. <words>125</words>  
The world split.  
Beneath the surface, a mirrored orchard thrived, lush and feverish, its trees gnarled with bioluminescent sap, their roots drinking from the same vents that sustained the tundra above. <words>153</words>  
Here, the crabs wore shells of obsidian, their eyes glowing like coals, and they swarmed the swordsman as he emerged dripping, his boots sinking into soil that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>179</words>  
A figure awaited him—a woman with a crown of frozen fire, her gaze sharpened by ephemeral rancor. <words>193</words>  
“You’re too late,” she spat, though her voice trembled, for the postcard now bore ink: words the swordsman had never written, detailing the Ascendant Court’s crimes against both realms. <words>218</words>  
He faltered, the blade trembling in his grip, but the crabs swarmed higher, their shells clacking into a bridge between her heart and his. <words>237</words>  
“I’m not here to fight,” he said, the awkwardness of his body dissolving into the weight of his purpose. <words>252</words>  
The queen laughed, bitter and brief, yet pressed her palm to the postcard, sealing the evidence—and the worlds—into a single, unbroken loop. <words>276</words>  
As the orchard above and below fused into one, the swordsman felt the crabs retreat, their task done, leaving him stranded between vengeance and forgiveness. <words>300</words>  
The queen turned to ash, her duty fulfilled, while he trudged back through the vent, the postcard now blank again, its purpose spent. <words>323</words>  
Above, the tundra bloomed with heat-touched apples, their skins glowing faintly, a testament to the bridge he’d built—not with grace, but with the stubborn, crooked resolve of a man who’d learned to move like a crab. <words>354</words>  
The Ascendant Court would come, he knew, but the orchard would remember. <words>367</words>  
And so would he. <words>372</words>
