The overworked detective leaned against the cracked doorframe of the vanishing point gallery, his tie loose and coffee cold, as the hush that follows the final siren settled over the city like a damp blanket. <words>23</words> He’d been here before, chasing shadows in the art world’s underbelly, but tonight felt different—like the walls themselves were holding their breath. <words>40</words> A single playing card, the queen of spades, fluttered to the floorboards beside his scuffed shoes, its edges frayed as if it had been folded and unfolded a thousand times. <words>64</words>  

He pocketed it without thinking, the way a drowning man grabs a rope, and stepped into the gallery’s warped perspective, where paintings bled into mirrors and floors tilted like drunken dancers. <words>87</words> The kaleidoscope on the central pedestal caught his eye—half-damaged, its fractured lenses spitting back fleeting images: a child’s laugh, a bloodstained ledger, his partner’s face before the bullet found her temple. <words>111</words> He turned it, ruthless, each twist a punchline to a joke he’d stopped laughing at years ago. <words>125</words>  

“Confidently unsure” was his life motto, he thought, snorting. <words>134</words> The job demanded certainty, but he’d long ago made peace with the gaps—the ones memories left behind, the ones cases left open, the ones that gnawed like rats in the walls. <words>154</words> Rummaging through the gallery’s detritus—a shattered easel, a moth-eaten couch—he wondered if the killer had lingered here too, admiring the irony of a space where everything vanished eventually. <words>180</words>  

The queen of spades burned his pocket. <words>187</words> He’d seen that card before, tucked into the collar of a johnny who’d floated facedown in the river, his skin tattooed with lies. <words>201</words> The kaleidoscope spat another image: his own reflection, younger, grinning like an idiot at a birthday cake. <words>214</words> He flinched. <words>218</words>  

The gallery’s owner had called it “an elegy for endings.” <words>228</words> The detective called it a tax write-off. <words>236</words> He was here to outdance the inevitability of another dead end, another name added to the ghosts that rode his shoulders. <words>251</words> The killer had wanted him to find the card, he realized; it was a taunt, a breadcrumb, a dare. <words>266</words>  

He left the gallery spinning behind him, the kaleidoscope’s final image seared into his brain: the queen of spades, crowned in flames. <words>284</words> The city’s sirens had gone quiet, but the static in his skull roared louder. <words>296</words> Somewhere, a clock ticked. <words>302</words> Somewhere, a phone buzzed with a text he didn’t want to read. <words>313</words>  

He lit a cigarette, the match hissing like a confession. <words>323</words> Memories were liars, he knew that—but they were also the only map he had. <words>336</words> The detective walked into the hush, molten sarcasm coating his tongue like acid, ready to burn through whatever came next. <words>353</words>  

The card was a start. <words>360</words> The kaleidoscope had shown him the shape of the hole he was chasing. <words>371</words> And holes, he’d learned, were just another word for doors. <words>381</words>  

He’d walk through this one too, even if it killed him. <words>392</words>  

The city always took its pound of flesh. <words>400</words> But tonight, he’d make it dance. <words>407</words>
