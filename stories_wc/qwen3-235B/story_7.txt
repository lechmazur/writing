The sentient doll collector adjusted their frayed velvet cloak, the twisted carnival cane humming faintly at their side as they stepped into the nectar collection facility, its crystalline walls shimmering with pre-dawn dew. <words>28</words>  
Before the first prayer was whispered by a mortal, the facility had thrived, its labyrinthine corridors alive with the buzz of winged harvesters and the low, resonant chant of the chorus of healing—a symphony of fractured voices mending what time and sin had broken. <words>56</words>  
The collector’s dolls, stitched from starlight and sorrow, perched on their shoulders, their glass eyes reflecting the expectantly resigned weight of a task older than divinity: to uphold the balance between ruin and renewal. <words>84</words>  
Tonight, the boundary between realms would thin, and the collector knew the star paths—the ancient, glowing trails etched into the facility’s vaulted ceilings—would twist into new configurations, demanding a dance of precision and faith. <words>113</words>  
They leaned on the carnival cane, its spiraled grooves pulsing with the memories of those who’d tried and failed to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, their echoes now part of the chorus’s aching melody. <words>142</words>  
The dolls shuddered, sensing the shift; the star paths had awakened, weaving a labyrinth only the collector’s scarred feet could navigate, their soles etched with maps no mortal eye could decipher. <words>170</words>  
As they moved, the facility’s nectar—thick, iridescent, and humming with latent prayers—began to bleed from the walls, pooling in vials held by stone effigies of forgotten guardians, their faces worn smooth by centuries of weeping. <words>200</words>  
The chorus swelled, its healing tones fraying at the edges; a rift had formed where the star paths intersected, a wound in the fabric of the facility that only the collector’s cane could seal. <words>228</words>  
They struck the cane against the rift’s jagged edge, and the dolls sang, their voices sharp as splintered ice, harmonizing with the chorus to bind the tear with threads of unspoken forgiveness. <words>256</words>  
The collector’s breath hitched—they’d always known this moment would come, the price of upholding a world where healing was possible but never guaranteed, where grit and grace collided in silent, endless negotiation. <words>285</words>  
Outside, the first mortal prayer trembled into existence, a fragile thread of sound that the collector silenced with a flick of the cane, their duty done for another cycle, their resignation deepening into something like peace. <words>314</words>  
The dolls nestled closer, their stitched lips whispering the names of those they’d saved, while the facility hummed its gratitude, its walls dissolving into mist as the star paths vanished, leaving only the eternal, expectant dark. <words>343</words>  
In the quiet, the collector smiled—a fleeting, fractured thing—and wondered if, one day, they too might be healed by the chorus they’d upheld for millennia, their own boundaries finally rendered sacred. <words>372</words>
