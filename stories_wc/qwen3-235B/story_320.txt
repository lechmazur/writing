The shy diviner traced their fingers over the waterlogged stall, where vintage photographs lay scattered like forgotten memories beneath the bioluminescent haze of the forgotten underwater city market. <words>17</words> Each image pulsed with a confusingly clear duality—a child’s laughter frozen mid-gesture, a crumbling tower dissolving into waves, faces that flickered between joy and despair as if regret itself had been pressed into the film. <words>43</words> They had seen these echoes before, in the static between parallel timelines, but never so vividly, never so… accusing. <words>58</words>  

A social media post from a decade ago surfaced in their mind: a blurred selfie tagged *#VanishedBazaar*, the caption pleading, *“Help, I’m losing time.”* <words>74</words> Then another, years later: a video of this very market, vibrant and dry, its vendor a twin of the skeletal figure beside them now. <words>89</words> The diviner had spent lifetimes dismissing such digital trails as noise, but the photos demanded otherwise—they were a map, a confession, a reckoning. <words>111</words>  

They uploaded the first photograph to an account dormant for centuries, their hands trembling with the weight of trespassing on the cosmic imbalance they’d sworn to mend. <words>134</words> Comments trickled in seconds: *“That’s my grandmother’s shop in Alexandria—how is this possible?” “This exact spot was destroyed in the ’23 quake.”* <words>152</words> Threads unraveled across platforms, timelines colliding in the comments, users unknowingly conversing across decades. <words>165</words> The diviner scrolled, their disinterest a practiced shield against the rising tide of recognition—*this was their fault*. <words>182</words>  

In a flicker of premonition, they saw it: their younger self, arrogant and starved for validation, had once toyed with the market’s ley lines, fracturing reality to impress a lover who vanished mid-kiss, dissolved into pixels of paradox. <words>208</words> The photographs were relics of that wound, each frame a stitch in the fabric they’d torn. <words>221</words> To right the imbalance, they’d have to precipitate their own undoing. <words>233</words>  

The next post went viral: a side-by-side of the market’s collapse, one half drowned, the other ablaze. <words>249</words> A teenager in 2045 livestreamed their screen, screaming as the diviner’s timeline bleed into hers, the vendor’s bones knitting into flesh behind them. <words>271</words> “It’s a hoax,” the diviner muttered, but their heart thrashed—*regret was never a whisper*. <words>286</words>  

At the market’s heart, they hurled the photographs into a vortex of static, each snap unraveling a thread of their existence. <words>302</words> Users across timelines gasped as the posts deleted themselves, histories rewriting in real time. <words>316</words> The lover reappeared, confused but whole, the market stabilizing into a single, scarred reality. <words>331</words>  

The diviner faded, their final act a passive scream—a being of passionate disinterest, erased by the clarity they’d feared. <words>350</words> In the newly quiet world, a single comment lingered: *“Thank you.”* <words>359</words>  

Beneath the waves, the stall held only blank frames, waiting. <words>367</words>
