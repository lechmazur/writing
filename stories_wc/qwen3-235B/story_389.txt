The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his moth-eaten cravat, its once-formal elegance now a casualty of the dust-choked air inside the forgotten library, as he traced a skeletal finger over the spine of a discredited textbook titled *Cures for the Damned*. <words>44</words>  
Moonlight seeped through cracked mine shafts above, glinting off the viking ship figurehead fragment he’d pried from a collapsed sarcophagus days prior—a jagged hunk of oak carved with runes that hummed faintly when he whispered the wrong syllables. <words>85</words>  
He’d come to optimize its power, of course, though the artifact’s true purpose had been lost to the same entropy that reduced empires to footnotes; the textbooks, banned for their heretical blend of alchemy and spite, hinted at rituals involving fermented midnight dew and the teeth of a confessed liar. <words>130</words>  
The final calendar page of the year fluttered to the stone floor behind him, its descent unmarked by clockwork or ceremony, and he felt the familiar sneer twist his lips—a habit forged in childhood, when his tutors had called his curiosity “unseemly.” <words>173</words>  
*Certainty is a parlor trick*, he thought, eyeing the figurehead’s hollowed eye sockets where moss now grew; the texts claimed the fragment could unlock the “fruit of knowledge,” a phrase that tasted both like promise and poison. <words>214</words>  
He’d brought no lantern, relying instead on the greenish phosphorescence of mold to guide his preparations: a circle of chalk scavenged from mine-cart debris, a vial of his own blood (three drops, no more), and a copy of *The Calendar’s Last Laugh*, a pamphlet dismissed as lunatic ravings. <words>257</words>  
As he chanted the eighth permutation of the incantation, the runes flared crimson, and the air thickened with the scent of burnt honey and regret—a sign, the books warned, that the artifact was “assessing its host.” <words>298</words>  
The warlock’s hands trembled, not from fear but the effort of maintaining his formally casual posture: shoulders slack, voice steady, as though summoning eldritch hungers were no more taxing than afternoon tea. <words>336</words>  
When the first scream echoed from the fragment—a sound like parchment tearing underwater—he dropped the textbook and gripped the oak shard, its surface now seething with images: a throne of antlers, a river of ink, a face that mirrored his own. <words>378</words>  
The mine shuddered. Somewhere, a beam groaned in protest, but he didn’t flinch; he’d always known the warnings were just the jealous mutterings of lesser minds, men who’d rather rot in ignorance than taste the cosmos’ raw pulp. <words>419</words>  
By dawn, the library would collapse, the fragment would vanish, and the warlock’s name would vanish from records, another casualty of the mine’s hunger. But in that final moment, as the runes consumed him, he smiled—a thin, triumphant slit of a thing—and gorged. <words>474</words>
