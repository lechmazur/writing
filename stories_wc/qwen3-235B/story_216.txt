The professional scapegoat for hire, Lira, twisted the metal washer between her fingers—a token from a client who’d vanished mid-transaction—its edges robustly delicate, like the lies she wove to absolve others. <words>22</words>  
She’d received the first cryptic phone call at midnight three nights after the last library card was returned to the desk, its barcode smudged into oblivion, marking the official closure of the Cloud City Archives. <words>45</words>  
The voice on the line spoke in fractals: “Refashion the washer. Decode the symbols. They’re eating through his skin.” <words>56</words>  
Lira knew “they” referred to the sacred glyphs that had begun appearing on citizens’ bodies, a viral script no one could read but everyone feared. <words>71</words>  
Her client, a nameless architect of the cloud city’s floating districts, had sculpted his career on erasing others’ scandals, only to find his own flesh betraying him—a man whose identity had become a prison. <words>96</words>  
The washer, she realized, was a fragment of the city’s original scaffolding, its surface etched with the same glyphs now blooming on his palms. <words>113</words>  
She worked in obsessive calm, cross-referencing the symbols with the Archives’ final catalog, her apartment a nest of suspended glass orbs holding whispered confessions from past clients. <words>134</words>  
At midnight, the calls resumed: “Trace the third glyph. It’s a lunging bird.” <words>145</words>  
Lira’s stylus hovered over the washer’s corroded face, her mind mapping the bird’s wings to the city’s grid—a revelation. <words>160</words>  
The glyphs weren’t curses; they were blueprints, instructions to refashion the city’s architecture into something transient, a place where identities could dissolve like mist. <words>184</words>  
The architect had tried to delete his own mark on the city, but the glyphs had seeped into him, a punishment for his permanence. <words>203</words>  
Lira’s final call came as the first light struck the cloud city’s apex: “Burn the washer. Let it carry his name into the stratosphere.” <words>222</words>  
She did, the metal glowing cherry-red before crumbling, its ashes spiraling into the vapor below, where the forgotten library card now floated, weightless and blank. <words>244</words>  
The architect’s skin cleared by dawn; he boarded a skyferry, his face already blurring in Lira’s memory. <words>260</words>  
She pocketed the washer’s ashes, her own name still intact—for now—the scapegoat’s work never done. <words>277</words>  
In Cloud City, where structures rose and fell like breath, abandonment was the only sacrament, and Lira its quietest acolyte. <words>297</words>  
The glyphs had taught her this: to refashion was not to destroy, but to let go, molecule by molecule, until even the act of forgetting felt sacred. <words>321</words>  
She waited for the next midnight call, the city humming its endless requiem overhead. <words>336</words>
