The uncertain alchemist adjusted their soot-stained goggles, watching the floating marketplace sway above the clouds as hot air balloons bobbed like tethered jellyfish. <words>17</words>  
They had come to trade a vial of liquid regret—for which there was an unexpected market—for the cracked scale of a mythical beast, rumored to tip the balance between mortality and something hungrier. <words>40</words>  
The scale, however, was hidden beneath a stall selling mundane miracles: self-stirring teacups, hourglasses that measured laughter, and a caged breeze that hummed lullabies. <words>63</words>  
To find it, the alchemist knelt, tracing the coded scuffs etched into the centuries-old marble floor—a language of merchants long dead, mapping forest trails that once led to hidden shrines. <words>90</words>  
Their hands trembled; the symbols were a dialect of dirt and erosion, but the pattern mirrored the veins in their own wrist, a compass only the technically wild could decipher. <words>116</words>  
A child’s chalk drawing of a dragon, half-erased by footfalls, pointed to a loose tile. Beneath it lay the scale, pocked and fractured, humming with the low resonance of a thing that had outlived its owner. <words>146</words>  
The alchemist pocketed it, their motivation never purely about immortality—though the price was etched in the fine print of every grimoire: to map the trails was to become unlost, to never die. <words>174</words>  
But the scale burned, a brand warning them that the beast had sacrificed its shadow to shed its mortality, leaving behind only this brittle fragment of defiance. <words>200</words>  
They fled, the marketplace’s kaleidoscope lights dimming as the judge’s gavel echoed in their mind—a sound yet to come, the hush before the verdict that would dissect their choice. <words>226</words>  
Back in their aerie-lit workshop, they dissolved the scale in a brew of stardust and sorrow, the concoction sparking like a trapped star. <words>249</words>  
When they drank, the forest trails unfolded in their veins: roots tunneling through soil, moss whispering secrets, a thousand forgotten paths blooming behind their eyes. <words>275</words>  
Yet immortality clung like a sickness. Their hands aged backward, then forward, a flicker between states—a body caught between seasons, neither here nor eternal. <words>301</words>  
The judge’s voice surfaced again, real this time: “Is the accused prepared to safeguard the balance they’ve disrupted?” The alchemist stood, their skin a mosaic of scars and saplings. <words>329</words>  
They had mapped the trails, yes—but the price was becoming the map, a living archive of every root and ruin, their heartbeat syncing with the forest’s slow, ancient breath. <words>356</words>  
The verdict fell like a leaf: guilty, yet pardoned by the sheer audacity of their transformation. The marketplace drifted on; the alchemist walked, forever half-wild, charting paths only the half-immortal could see. <words>385</words>  
Their final act was mundane, miraculous: planting the cracked scale beneath an oak, where it dissolved into a seedling bearing fruit that glowed like tiny, forgiving moons. <words>412</words>  
The price, they decided, was not the end—but the becoming, the unending scuff-mark trail of learning how to live between the cracks. <words>437</words>
