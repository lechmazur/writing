The subtle illusionist stood in the temple in the clouds, her fingers brushing the unmarked binder clip pinned to her sleeve—a token from a lover who’d vanished like mist. <words>21</words>  
At the hush after a cashier closed out the register, the temple’s marble floors hummed, and the air thickened with the weight of forgotten prayers. <words>40</words>  
She unfolded the antique lace pattern she’d stolen from a museum, its threads whispering instructions only she could hear: *Rekindle the root, not the flame.* <words>59</words>  
Her hands moved casually intense, weaving the binder clip into the lace’s frayed edge, where silver filaments glinted like coded starlight. <words>77</words>  
The understory grows, the lover had murmured before leaving, his voice a map to a world beneath this one, where roots spoke in dialects of ache and renewal. <words>100</words>  
Now, alone, she obeyed the lace’s command, pricking her thumb on the clip’s serrated edge and letting blood drip onto the temple’s central altar—a hollow stone shaped like a heart. <words>125</words>  
Vines erupted, thornless and luminous, curling around pillars as if the temple itself had exhaled them. Their scent was of wet soil and unsent letters. <words>145</words>  
She whispered the language of the heart, a phrase he’d taught her: *Kethra vey, kethra vey*, meaning both "I remember" and "I surrender." <words>164</words>  
The vines thickened, their leaves unfurling to reveal inked symbols—the same as those in her lace, now fraying into threads that rewrote themselves into his handwriting. <words>185</words>  
A doleful cheer settled over her; the lover’s absence was a hollow note, yet the temple pulsed with his presence, as though he’d become the music itself. <words>207</words>  
She pressed the binder clip to her sternum, feeling its cold ache mirror her own. He’d wanted her to grow, not grieve—to let the understory of their story thrive unseen. <words>230</words>  
When the vines reached the ceiling, they paused, trembling, then sank back into the stone, leaving the temple altered but intact, like a wound healed into a scar. <words>254</words>  
The illusionist smiled, a flicker of mischief in her sorrow. She’d mastered his lesson: to rekindle was not to resurrect, but to tend what hunger made eternal. <words>277</words>  
She left the binder clip on the altar, its metal gleaming dully as the clouds outside began to part, revealing a sky the color of a bruise’s fading edge. <words>300</words>  
The understory grows, she thought, tracing the new grooves in the stone where vines had bitten deep. Below the temple, the world would never know how close it had come to blooming. <words>324</words>  
She vanished, her form dissolving like smoke caught mid-dance, leaving only the scent of green things and the quiet certainty that some endings are roots, not closures. <words>348</words>  
The lace, now plain and brittle, crumbled in her absence, its final thread snaking into the altar’s cracks—a cipher no one would read, but everyone would feel. <words>371</words>  
And the temple, as always, waited, its stones humming the lover’s name in a key only the heart’s language could translate. <words>389</words>
