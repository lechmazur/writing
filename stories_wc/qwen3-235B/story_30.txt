The space pirate navigation room hummed with the sacred disorder of star charts, flickering holograms, and the low growl of a plasma storm beyond the viewport. Kael, the high-stakes gambler with telekinetic dice, rolled his fingertips over the fragment of medieval tapestry he’d won in a bet—a scrap of woven dragons whose scales shimmered with threads of a lost language only he could half-decipher. <words>78</words>  

His family’s tradition demanded he plant a tree for every new member, but here, among the stars, he’d substituted saplings in hydroponic pods, their roots fed by stories of Earth’s soil. The tapestry, though, was different: it whispered secrets of agrarian rites in a tongue that predated cities, a language that encoded how to coax life from barren ground. Kael needed it to preserve what his ancestors had tilled, before corporate agribusinesses scrubbed all memory of true farming from the galaxy. <words>156</words>  

He’d gambled for it in a den of zero-gravity cardsharks, his dice hovering like moons as he bent probability to his will. The tapestry’s dragons seemed to writhe when he won, their stitched jaws parting to exhale symbols he couldn’t parse. Now, alone in the navigation room, he traced the glyphs with a calloused thumb, their meaning flickering at the edge of his mind—a philosophically practical pursuit, balancing the abstract beauty of forgotten words against the tangible hunger of a thousand colony worlds. <words>234</words>  

The flame came unexpectedly. A rival pirate, seeking revenge for Kael’s luck, breached the ship’s hull, and fire raced through the oxygen-rich air. Kael lunged for the tapestry, its threads glowing hotter as heat licked its edges. Instinctively, he hurled his dice at the flames, telekinetic force scattering embers—and in that instant, the fire revealed what the dragons guarded: a hidden layer of text, scorched into the fabric’s fibers, detailing crop rotations and soil alchemy lost to the Dark Ages of Earth. <words>312</words>  

Smoke choked the room, but Kael laughed, a wild sound in the chaos. The tapestry’s secret demanded sacrifice—its preservation required destruction. He tore a sapling from its pod, plunging its roots into the flames, dousing them with nutrient gel. The fire hissed, dying as the plant absorbed the last heat, its leaves unfurling in a sudden, green gasp of victory. The dragons’ glyphs now glowed faintly on the salvaged fragment, their wisdom saved. <words>389</words>  

Later, amid the whispered secrets of the pirate crew—plans for heists, betrayals, the scent of distant gold—Kael etched the tapestry’s recovered language onto the ship’s databanks. He’d plant a tree for this night, too: a new member of his lineage, born of flame and chance, its roots drinking both fire and memory. The lost would stay found, as long as someone gambled to keep them alive. <words>466</words>
