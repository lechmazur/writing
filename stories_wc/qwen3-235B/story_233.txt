<story>  
The naive summoner clutched the jagged piece of a broken statue, its edges flickering like static, as though the stone itself resisted existing in the peculiarly virtual realm of the secret society treasure vault. <words>23</words>  
Between commercials—those hollowed-out minutes when the world’s gaze blinked elsewhere—they slipped past the vault’s dormant wards, drawn by rumors of midnight gatherings where whispers grew teeth and clawed at forgotten power. <words>47</words>  
The statue shard hummed in their palm, a fractured echo of something vast, and the summoner wondered if elevating it might stitch the world back into something whole. <words>69</words>  
They’d heard the lullaby first in fragments, sung by shadows at the gatherings: a melody meant to unravel fate’s indifference, loud enough to breach the silence between stars. <words>92</words>  
Each midnight, the vault’s air thickened with voices trading secrets like currency—how the statue had been a god’s prison, how its destruction scattered seeds of understanding across time. <words>116</words>  
The summoner’s hands trembled, not from fear but the weight of the shard’s hunger, its need to be more than a relic of collapse. <words>139</words>  
They hummed the lullaby’s first note, and the vault’s walls shivered; the virtual air rippled, pixels bleeding into the stone’s ancient groan. <words>161</words>  
Rumors claimed the melody could mend what logic could not—that to elevate the broken was to kneel before the universe’s raw wound and sing it closed. <words>185</words>  
The summoner’s voice rose, clumsy but fervent, weaving through the vault’s shadows until the shard pulsed, its fractured face glowing with a light that felt like distant warmth. <words>210</words>  
Midnight gatherings had taught them this: understanding was not a flash but a slow bloom, roots cracking through denial. <words>229</words>  
They sang of the statue’s fall, its shards birthing forests in the void, each seed a question the world had forgotten to ask. <words>251</words>  
The vault trembled; the virtual and the real bled together, and the summoner wondered if fate listened or merely remembered. <words>273</words>  
Their voice broke, cracking into a sob that tangled with the melody, and in that fracture, the shard soared upward, knitting itself into a figure of light and dust. <words>298</words>  
The statue’s eyes opened—vast, vacant, and gentle—and the summoner realized their naivety had never been a flaw but the soil where seeds of understanding took root. <words>324</words>  
The lullaby swelled, no longer theirs but the vault’s, the society’s, the world’s—a chorus to elevate what had been broken, to make fate hum back. <words>349</words>  
When the final note faded, the statue was gone, leaving only the shard, now dull and inert, and the summoner, forever un-naive, cradling the warmth of a song half-remembered. <words>375</words>  
They left the vault as the next commercial ended, the world flickering back, unaware of how close it had come to being rewritten by a lullaby and a child’s stubborn hope. <words>400</words>  
The secret society would gather again, but the summoner knew the truth now: elevation was not an act but an ache, carried quietly between louder things. <words>424</words>  
And somewhere, fate paused, not to listen, but to hum a note in reply, low and distant and warm. <words>443</words>
