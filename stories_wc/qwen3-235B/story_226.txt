The gloomy orchardist traced cracked fingertips over the sun-bleached desert skull nestled in his workbench’s grip, its hollow eyes reflecting the amber haze of dying twilight. <words>17</words>  
His orchard—a skeletal grove of bioluminescent apple trees engineered to thrive in the desert’s wrath—hummed faintly, their roots fed by stolen water and black-market nutrients he’d bartered for with shards of forgotten lullabies. <words>37</words>  
The skull, a relic from a prospector’s corpse he’d never met, was the keystone to containing the resonance, the facility’s engineers had whispered, though their lab-coated mouths reeked of lies and synthetic ozone. <words>58</words>  
He’d sold his firstborn’s name to smugglers for it, traded the melody his mother sang to quell his nightmares, all to reach this hush where past meets prophecy, where the facility’s subterranean machines groaned like caged gods. <words>82</words>  
Craftsman’s pride demanded perfection: the skull’s artificial sinews, woven from moonlit spider silk and smuggled ceramite, pulsed with a genuinely artificial life, a mimicry of the sacred that made his stomach twist. <words>106</words>  
The resonance testing chamber awaited, its walls scarred by failed experiments—screaming skulls, weeping stone, a symphony of collapse—yet he clung to the hope that lullabies, even fractured ones, could lull the desert’s ancient rage into dormancy. <words>134</words>  
At midnight, he carried the skull through the facility’s rusted corridors, its weight a counterpoint to the void inside him, the hollow where his own lullaby had once lived before he sold it to save the orchard’s first saplings. <words>161</words>  
The engineers watched, their faces masked by prismatic goggles, as he placed the skull into the containment cradle, its surface crackling with the static of a thousand stifled dirges. <words>184</words>  
“Sing,” one muttered, and he obeyed, voice trembling with the arid ache of a man who’d forgotten kindness, the notes a jagged thread stitching the air to the earth to the skull’s yawning maw. <words>209</words>  
The resonance surged—a tempest of sand and starlight, a chorus of lost children wailing through the skull’s teeth—but the containment held, the artificial sinews glowing white-hot as they strangled the storm into silence. <words>236</words>  
When dawn bled across the horizon, the orchardist knelt in the dust, the skull now ash, the facility’s machines eerily still, and wondered if the lullabies he’d scattered to the void would ever return to him, whole. <words>264</words>  
The engineers called it a success; the orchardist called it a debt, his pride a rusted blade buried in the ribs of a desert that remembered every trade, every theft, every genuinely artificial thing he’d ever made. <words>290</words>  
He walked home beneath a sun that judged without mercy, the air thick with the scent of his orchard’s first bloom, a fragile, defiant sweetness in a world that demanded sacrifice for every note of grace. <words>317</words>
