The street musician clutched his violin case like a relic, stepping over conveyor belts frozen mid-motion in the cavernous automated postal sorting facility, where the air hummed with the static of forgotten letters. <words>22</words>  
He’d come seeking shelter, but the vintage fountain pen protruding from a cracked sorting bin—its gold nib catching the dim light—felt like a summons, not a coincidence. <words>45</words>  
Its weight in his palm was familiar, deceptive; he’d owned one decades ago, before regrets calcified into his bones, before he’d abandoned his son at a crossroads of shouted promises and broken sheet music. <words>71</words>  
When he uncapped it, the pen bled ink that shimmered like liquid starlight, and the world stuttered—a rewind triggered by tracing the pen’s tip over a邮戳 (postal stamp) etched on a forgotten envelope. <words>98</words>  
He landed in a memory: his son’s seventh birthday, the boy’s laughter tangled in the melody of his failed lullaby. <words>113</words>  
But the pen’s magic was a trickster—it forced him to reenact the day’s patterns, the exact sequence of misplaced notes and snapped piano strings, no matter how he writhed against them. <words>142</words>  
Each rewind spiraled tighter, hurling him through postal codes of his past: a lover’s abandoned apartment, a sister’s funeral, a stolen kiss under a train bridge, all mapped in the facility’s labyrinth of undelivered mail. <words>174</words>  
The suitcase, he realized, was metaphor and machinery—a temporal vault at the facility’s heart, its latch counting down in morse code ticks, its closure his only escape from the pen’s backlash. <words>203</words>  
Regrets coiled like barbed wire around his throat; the pen hadn’t let him rewrite, only relive, each loop a hall of mirrors reflecting his failures in prismatic clarity. <words>229</words>  
Yet in the static between rewinds, he heard it—a tinny, absurd chuckle echoing through the vents, as if the universe itself mocked his earnest, futile dance. <words>254</words>  
He laughed too, then, a raw, joyful despair cracking his ribs, because the cosmic joke was on them all: the pen, the postal ghosts, even Time, which had no more use for his music than a discarded stamp. <words>285</words>  
With the suitcase yawning open—a vortex of unspooled typewriter ribbons and expired postcards—he dipped the pen one last time, not to rewind, but to inscribe a final letter in the air: “Forgive the noise.” <words>314</words>  
The facility collapsed like origami; the pen vaporized to ash. <words>324</words>  
He awoke on a park bench, violin silent, the taste of ink and laughter lingering—a man unmoored, unregretting, playing a duet with the wind’s static hum. <words>347</words>  
The patterns hadn’t saved him, but they’d revealed the punchline: there was no suitcase, no rewind, only the infinite, crumpled present of a joke too vast to comprehend. <words>374</words>  
He played a note, sharp and bright, and the stars above blinked in arrhythmic applause. <words>387</words>
