The brooding sculptor adjusted his vintage reading glasses, their cracked frames pressing into the bridge of his nose as he squinted at the rusted truck before him, its dented hood smeared with red Martian dust. <words>22</words>  
He’d carved secrets into the impact crater research base’s concrete walls for years—faces of the dead, spirals of forgotten languages—but no one noticed the webs of intrigue hidden in the chisel marks, not even the scientists who muttered about quantum anomalies while he washed their vehicles. <words>53</words>  
The glasses had belonged to his father, a man who’d vanished amid car washing duties decades prior, leaving only a smear of suds and a faint scent of ozone; the sculptor wore them like a relic of rebellion, a theoretically spontaneous act of defiance against the base’s sterile monotony. <words>85</words>  
Every afternoon, he lingered at the edge of the crater, where sunlight slanted through the dust-choked air, and imagined the dance of particles as a veil between worlds—a thought that thickened his chest with murky tenderness for a planet that had never loved him back. <words>117</words>  
The director had caught him once, fingers tracing a half-formed sculpture in the dirt, and warned him: “Servitude isn’t a cage; it’s a contract.” But the sculptor knew better—knew the director’s smiles hid needles, the kind used to quiet minds that asked too many questions. <words>149</words>  
That evening, as he rinsed the truck’s windshield, he slipped the glasses into his pocket and stepped into the sunbeam’s golden column, where the dust swirled like a living thing, and he let the particles pull him, thread by thread, into the light. <words>179</words>  
The disappearance was neither planned nor accidental; it was a surrender to the theoretically spontaneous, a choice carved from years of chiseling his own prison. <words>197</words>  
Later, they’d find his tools scattered near the crater’s lip, the glasses cracked but still catching the light, and they’d whisper that he’d dissolved into the dust, his body a final sculpture scattered across the void. <words>222</words>  
But in the moment, he was weightless, falling through a prism of suspended time, the air thick with the scent of his father’s cologne and the low hum of a world that had waited, patient and hungry, for him to finally look up. <words>250</words>  
The director would burn his files, erase his name from the logs, but the sculptures in the walls would remain—whispers in stone, a map for those who knew how to see. <words>273</words>  
And somewhere, in the dance of dust and light, the sculptor would smile, his hands finally free to shape something that did not bleed. <words>293</words>
