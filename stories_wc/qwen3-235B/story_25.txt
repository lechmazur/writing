<story>  
The sea-worn mariner stood in the wings of the dusty theater, his gaze fixed on the uneven rungs of a hand-carved ladder leaning against a raftersupport, the audience trickling in as motes of ultraviolet light shimmered through cracked skylights. <words>27</words>  
He had stolen the ladder from the edge of the ultraviolet forest two nights prior, its rungs spaced in a pattern that hummed with a cold, geometric logic—too deliberate for a tool, too erratic for art. <words>54</words>  
The forgotten diary clutched in his gloved hand, its leather cracked like sun-bleached bone, had been buried beneath the forest’s phosphorescent roots; its pages whispered of a crew who’d tried to assimilate the forest’s secrets by mapping its chaos into order. <words>87</words>  
“They thought the rung spacing was a code,” he muttered, voice rough as reef stone, coldly intense as he traced the gaps with a calloused finger—short, long, short, long, a rhythm that mirrored the diary’s final entry: *Freedom demands a tax older than breath.* <words>122</words>  
The mariner’s loyalty had always been fickle, sworn first to the horizon, then to the puzzle of survival; he’d left his last ship when the captain refused to chart a course toward the forest’s rumored heart, where the sky fractured into prismatic lies. <words>156</words>  
Now, in the theater’s dim haze, he climbed the ladder, each rung a question, each gap a lesson—the diary’s author had carved the wood after watching his comrades dissolve into the forest’s hunger, their bones repurposed into bioluminescent vines. <words>189</words>  
The audience murmured, their faces upturned like thirsty anemones, as the mariner reached the top, where a single beam cast a shadow resembling the forest’s central clearing, a spiral of blackened soil and singing fungi. <words>221</words>  
He threw the diary into a brazier beside him; flames erupted in ultraviolet hues, searing the air with the scent of salt and burnt vellum. “Freedom,” he roared, voice cracking the silence, “is the debt you pay with what you love most!” <words>254</words>  
The ladder shuddered, its rungs realigning into a perfect gradient as the fire consumed the diary—proof the forest’s rules could be bent, but only by those willing to become both executioner and heir. <words>286</words>  
A child in the front row gasped as the mariner leapt from the ladder, landing soundlessly on a patch of stage ivy that curled toward him like a starved animal. <words>313</words>  
“They assimilated the forest,” he hissed, pulling a shard of obsidian from his coat—a splinter from the clearing’s central stone—“but the forest assimilated them first.” <words>344</words>  
The audience’s wonder was palpable, a living thing igniting their dulled reason; he’d come to set this blaze, to trade his crew’s ghosts for a new mythology. <words>373</words>  
When the theater’s lights died, plunging the room into ultraviolet gloom, no one screamed—the mariner’s shadow loomed three times his height, a silhouette of jagged rungs and endless horizons. <words>403</words>  
He vanished as the diary’s ashes cooled, leaving only the ladder, now perfectly spaced, and the scent of a storm-churned sea—a relic of a man who’d paid the price to burn reason’s cage wide open. <words>437</words>
