<story>  
The penitent memory thief slipped into the fruit preservation vault beneath the orchard’s skeletal trees, her breath visible in the icy warmth of preserved pears and apples, as still as the swing set outside that slowed to a stop with a rusted sigh. <words>44</words>  
She had come to recalibrate the crack in reality, a jagged seam in the air only she could see, humming with the stolen recollections of a hundred lifetimes—including her own. <words>74</words>  
In her pocket, the simple wooden toy block burned like a coal, its grooves carved by a child’s hand decades ago, a relic of the ancient methods she now sought to restore, though her heart twisted with lovingly hateful regret for what she’d plundered to survive. <words>117</words>  
The vault’s glass jars glowed amber in the dimness, each containing not just fruit but fragments of memory—the sweetness of first summers, the ache of forgotten goodbyes—preserved by those who’d understood the cost of time before her kind had eroded their rituals. <words>160</words>  
She knelt, spilling a trail of flower petals she’d plucked from the hallucinogenic night-blooming cereus, their violet edges curling like smoke; they pointed, inexorably, to the crack’s shimmering locus, where the air tasted of overripe mangoes and unsaid apologies. <words>204</words>  
Her mentor’s voice echoed in her skull—*“You steal memories, but you become the thief who starves when the world forgets how to remember”*—and she wondered if this act, pressing the toy block into the vault’s frost-rimmed lock, would mend what she’d hollowed. <words>248</words>  
The block fit. The vault shuddered. The crack pulsed, drawing petals into its maw like a lung inhaling, and she whispered the old words etched into the toy’s base, syllables that smelled of cinnamon and soil, the language of root and seed. <words>291</words>  
Memories surged: a girl laughing as she painted the block’s letters, a mother’s lullaby preserved in honeyed apricot flesh, a century-old vow to protect the threshold between the seen and the unseen—all things she’d stripped from the world to fuel her own escape. <words>334</words>  
The thief trembled, letting the visions flood her, no longer hoarding but offering them back to the weave, her penance crystallizing in the frost-patterned air as the swing outside ceased its final creak, leaving only the hush of completion. <words>377</words>  
When dawn seeped through the vault’s grating, the crack was gone, the fruit’s glow deeper, richer, as if the earth itself had exhaled. <words>403</words>  
She left the toy block behind, its purpose fulfilled, and walked into the orchard’s brittle light, knowing the world would never thank her—but the ancient methods, at least, had been given roots again. <words>446</words>
