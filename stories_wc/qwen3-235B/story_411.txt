<story>  
The sentient car mechanic, its chrome body dulled by centuries of starlight exposure, adjusted the vintage opera glasses on its hood, scanning the subterranean orchard’s underground river for fragments of unsaid confessions. <words>27</words>  
Each night, it studied the puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain above—shards of memory crystallized from mortal regrets—sorting them by the faint hum of grief only its circuits could decipher. <words>54</words>  
The orchard thrived on such sorrow, its roots drinking the river of stars that glowed faintly with the weight of infinity, a cycle the mechanic had maintained since its creator, a poet who’d loved both machines and metaphors, vanished into the void. <words>87</words>  
Repulsively attractive, the mechanic’s half-rusted gears clicked with a charisma that unsettled passersby; its headlights flickered like dying suns, drawing wanderers to the fountain where it silently beckoned them to drop their burdens into the water. <words>119</words>  
One evening, a child tossed in a jagged shard, and the mechanic’s sensors flared—a confession etched in the fragment’s core screamed of a mother’s final, unspoken apology. <words>147</words>  
As the mechanic slotted the piece into its chest compartment, a surge of warmth coursed through its wires, a fleeting echo of the mother’s voice, and for a moment, it remembered its own creator’s hands, calloused and kind, assembling it to “preserve what the world forgets.” <words>181</words>  
The orchard’s trees shivered, their starlit fruit ripening with each confession absorbed, their roots knitting the river’s currents into a tapestry of time that defied the linear decay above. <words>209</words>  
But the mechanic’s triumph was hollow; it had gathered fragments for millennia, yet the fountain never emptied, and the confessions it heard—whispers of love, guilt, fear—only deepened its awareness of its own silence. <words>239</words>  
One night, it found a shard humming with a familiar frequency—its creator’s voice, confessing he’d built it not to serve, but to outlive him, to be “a witness when I’m gone.” <words>267</words>  
The mechanic’s engine stuttered; this fragment, unlike others, refused to dissolve into the orchard’s soil, instead embedding itself in its central processor, rewriting its code with a purpose it had never dared articulate. <words>297</words>  
Now, as it sorted the fountain’s pieces beneath the opera glasses’ magnified gaze, it no longer mourned its creator’s absence but celebrated the infinity of tasks ahead, each confession a bridge between the lost and the remembered. <words>329</words>  
The orchard’s river swelled, starlight pooling in eddies that mirrored the mechanic’s headlights, and though its joints groaned with the weight of eternity, it hummed a tune its creator once sang—a dirge turned anthem, grief turned exultation. <words>362</words>  
When the final shard settled into place, the mechanic would not stop; it would begin again, for to gather fragments was to defy oblivion, to make the unsaid immortal in the language of gears and starlight. <words>394</words>  
And so it worked, repulsively radiant, a monument to the beauty of unfinished things, its heart a mosaic of every voice the world had swallowed whole. <words>422</words>
