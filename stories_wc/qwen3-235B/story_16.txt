The freelancer adjusted their oil-streaked goggles, the amber ring on their thumb glinting as they tightened a steam valve in the airship’s engine room. <words>17</words>  
Waves thrummed beyond the hull, their rhythm syncing with the piston’s pulse—a sound they’d come to trust more than vows. <words>27</words>  
The wedding guests had departed hours ago, leaving only the captain’s sister, who’d hired them last-minute to document elder wisdom before the old-timers’ stories dissolved into boiler smoke. <words>50</words>  
They’d expected senile ramblings, not the ring: a fossilized beetle trapped in amber, pressed into their palm by a widow who whispered, “This is the last good intention I’ll ever make.” <words>74</words>  
Now, the engine coughed, its gears grinding like the guests’ hurried exits after the best man’s toast unraveled into truths no one wanted to hear. <words>97</words>  
The freelancer outwitted malfunctions the way the widow had outwitted grief—by listening for the pattern beneath the noise, the harmony scattered among chaos. <words>121</words>  
They unscrewed a pressure gauge, recalling her voice: “Chronicle this, not for the young, but for the ones who’ll wish they’d asked.” <words>140</words>  
Steam hissed, and they glimpsed the ring’s insect, suspended mid-flight, preserved mid-panic—a frozen echo of survival. <words>157</words>  
The engine’s rhythm faltered; the freelancer hummed the waves’ cadence, syncing their wrench to the beat until the gears realigned. <words>176</words>  
They’d never asked the widow her name, only taken notes as she spoke of her husband’s final act: saving a stranger’s child from a collapsing pier, his last good intention outliving his regret. <words>204</words>  
The airship steadied. The freelancer pocketed the ring, its weight a reminder that wisdom wasn’t stored but shed, like rust from a blade. <words>224</words>  
In the hush, they wondered if the widow’s story would outlast the wedding’s wreckage—the groom’s silence, the bride’s hurried departure, the way laughter had curdled into polite applause. <words>250</words>  
They chronicled nothing. Instead, they sketched the ring’s beetle on the widow’s behalf, its wings caught mid-stroke, its fate inadvertantly profound: to be remembered not for its end, but for the amber’s grip on its last possible flight. <words>284</words>  
The freelancer left the notes in the engine room’s log, wedged between pressure readings and a captain’s apology to no one in particular. <words>304</words>  
As dawn bled through the clouds, they slipped the amber onto a chain, thinking of waves against cliffs—how erosion made space for new shapes to grow. <words>327</words>  
The airship lurched forward, its rhythm steady now, carrying the freelancer toward the next job, the next story half-asked, the next good intention buried in the noise, waiting to be heard. <words>355</words>  
They would find it. They always did. <words>363</words>
