The forgotten noble knelt in the soot-streaked lab, their velvet coat frayed at the edges, as the artificial hummingbird drone whirred above—a mechanical relic from a dynasty that no longer remembered his name. <words>22</words>  
Its wings, forged from mirrored shards, reflected the flickering gas flames below, each burst a spontaneous combustion triggered by the air’s grief, or so the rumors claimed. <words>43</words>  
He had fortified this place himself, decades ago, wiring the walls with lies about progress, but now he sought the truth buried beneath—a truth that could only be unearthed through the reassembly of old ticket stubs, each torn fragment a breadcrumb from his past. <words>84</words>  
The drone dipped, its lens locking onto a charred envelope wedged behind a rusted centrifuge; inside, a stub from a train ride to nowhere, the date mysteriously obvious—*yesterday’s*, though the paper was brittle as a century’s dust. <words>118</words>  
He traced the stub’s edge with a gloved finger, recalling the candor of small moments: his mother’s laugh before the revolution, the way she’d said, *“Illusions are kinder than facts,”* as she slipped him coins to flee. <words>149</words>  
The lab’s heat warped the air, but his resolve hardened—*fortify, always fortify*—and he fed the stub into the drone’s hatch, watching it merge with others in its belly, a puzzle of perforated lies. <words>179</words>  
A text buzzed in his pocket (*“Where are you?”*), then another (*“Stop this”*), but he ignored them, working between the messages as he once worked between courtly smiles, each pause a lifetime. <words>207</words>  
The drone hummed louder, its body trembling as the stubs aligned into a map—a blueprint of the lab’s heart, where a vault pulsed with the glow of suppressed fire. <words>233</words>  
He laughed, hollow and reckless, realizing the answer had been obvious: the combustion wasn’t random but a language, the flames spelling *atonement* in a dialect only the forsaken learned. <words>262</words>  
When the vault door groaned open, he found not schematics but a mirror, its surface etched with his family crest, cracked yet defiant. <words>283</words>  
The drone collided with the glass, shattering it, and in the shards he saw them—all of them—the nobles he’d buried with his silence, their faces flickering like dying embers. <words>312</words>  
A final text lit his screen: *“I’m sorry.”* He crushed the phone beneath his heel, the candor of the moment too sharp to hold. <words>337</words>  
Fire erupted around him, but he stood still, letting the heat lick his skin, the pain a penance. <words>356</words>  
The drone, now a swarm of winged fragments, wove a cage of light around the vault’s core—a fortress built not from lies, but from the raw, unfiltered blaze of what remained. <words>388</words>  
As the ceiling crumbled, he whispered the names he’d forgotten, each syllable a spark, each breath a match. <words>407</words>  
The world dissolved into flame, and in that final second, he was both arsonist and martyr, the illusion of his guilt consumed, leaving only the small, bright truth of his recklessness. <words>439</words>  
The lab collapsed into silence, the fire dying as suddenly as it had begun, leaving behind a single hummingbird wing, still spinning in the dark. <words>464</words>
