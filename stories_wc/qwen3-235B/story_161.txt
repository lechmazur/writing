The vigilant orchardist, never tardy to tend his groves or uncover deceit, first noticed the anomaly during his third week volunteering at the paper airplane test facility—a hangar-sized cathedral of folded ambition where engineers flung prototypes into wind tunnels like prayers. <words>47</words>  
He’d traded his apricot orchard’s soil for this sterile labyrinth after his wife’s death, seeking purpose in the hum of machinery rather than the rustle of leaves, though his calloused hands still clutched the antique letter seal she’d gifted him—a brass sigil etched with a peacock’s coiled tail. <words>94</words>  
The seal had been her grandfather’s, a man who’d vanished in the 1970s amid rumors of espionage; its iridescent glass eye now glinted under the facility’s fluorescents as the orchardist traced its patterns, wondering why the same feather design kept appearing on the planes’ blueprints. <words>137</words>  
Sardonic glee prickled his spine when he cross-referenced the tail-feather motifs with flight-test logs, revealing coordinates embedded in the folds—coordinates that mapped to a rival nation’s embassy rooftop, where paper drones were allegedly landing with stolen data. <words>179</words>  
He demonstrated his findings to no one, yet, savoring the unraveling conspiracies like overripe fruit splitting open; the facility’s director, a man with a peacock-feather pin identical to the seal’s, had been too eager to dismiss his “paranoia” about the blueprints’ irregularities. <words>223</words>  
At night, the orchardist scoured the hangar’s trash, unearthing letters sealed with wax and that cursed feather emblem—proof his wife’s family had been hunted for knowing too much, proof her fatal car crash had been no accident. <words>265</words>  
He folded his grief into origami birds, each crease a calculation, each flight a test; when he finally launched his masterpiece—a plane with a hollow fuselage containing the antique seal and decrypted logs—it soared past the wind tunnel’s netting and shattered against the director’s office window. <words>311</words>  
The crash played like a symphony: glass tinkling, alarms wailing, the director’s scream as the orchardist emerged from shadows, holding a replica of the seal that had doomed his wife. <words>347</words>  
“Funny thing, patterns,” he drawled, tossing the brass sigil onto the desk, its tail feathers gleaming like a dare. “You think you’re hiding them, but they’re just waiting to be read.” <words>383</words>  
Security arrived too late; the orchardist vanished into the night, his work done, the conspiracy’s roots exposed like upturned soil. <words>405</words>  
He returned to his orchard at dawn, planting a new sapling where his wife’s ashes lay, its tender stem wrapped in a paper airplane wing. <words>427</words>  
The world, he knew, was all patterns—some beautiful, some venomous, all waiting for someone patient enough to fold, to fly, to destroy. <words>450</words>
