The sound engineer, whose hands were clumsily dexterous yet precise in their chaos, adjusted the fractured stained glass lens above the witch’s cauldron room, where reality simmered like broth. <words>22</words>  
The crowd outside roared, a tidal chant demanding justice or blood—perhaps both—and the engineer, known only as Mire, had spent years crafting silence from noise to hush their unstoppable voices. <words>45</words>  
Her tool was a shard of cathedral glass, cobalt and jagged, salvaged from a world erased by the same mobs now clawing at her door, its edges still humming with the prayers of the dead. <words>69</words>  
Mire’s critique of the age was wordless: she would weaponize pantomime, projecting confessions onto the public square’s fog, forcing the crowd to witness their own grotesque faces mouthing secrets they’d buried in others’ throats. <words>95</words>  
The cauldron hissed, its vapors thickening into spectral film as Mire slotted the glass into the projector’s eye, her trembling fingers betraying her resolve but never her aim. <words>118</words>  
She’d calibrated the device during the hush of a freshly erased chalkboard—the fleeting second after erasure, when dust hung suspended and time itself seemed to hold its breath. <words>141</words>  
That silence was her metronome, the void where she’d splice reality into parables, her illusions so practical they felt like truth, sharper than lies. <words>163</words>  
When the mob surged beneath her tower, torches licking the night, Mire activated the projector; the stained glass refracted her recorded phantoms into giants, their gestures grotesquely familiar. <words>188</words>  
A butcher saw himself disassembling his own ribs; a demagogue watched his mouth split into a hundred serpents, each hissing his stolen words. <words>209</words>  
The crowd faltered, their roar dissolving into gasps as the pantomimes mirrored their sins, the illusions stitched from their own memories, harvested by Mire’s soundwaves and the glass’s ancient hunger. <words>235</words>  
Clumsy dexterity saved her then: as stones shattered her window, she rerouted the cauldron’s steam into a fog that swallowed the projections, leaving only the shard’s cold glow. <words>259</words>  
The mob, now whispering, drifted away, haunted by the weight of unspoken confessions made visible, their retribution silent but absolute. <words>282</words>  
Mire collapsed beside the cauldron, the stained glass fragment dulling as it absorbed the last of the crowd’s vanquished fury, and wondered if she’d sculpted justice or merely a pause. <words>307</words>  
The room hummed, practical and illusionless now, as the chalkboard’s hush returned, thinner this time, as though the world itself had learned to listen. <words>330</words>  
She pocketed the shard, its edges worn smooth by use, and waited for the next roar to rise—knowing silence was never permanent, only borrowed. <words>353</words>  
In the quiet, her hands trembled less. <words>364</words>
