The ancient Persian palace, now a labyrinth of dust and forgotten echoes, cradled the astronomical clock like a relic of defiant precision. <words>17</words> Its gears, forged from meteoric iron and etched with constellations, whirred in silence, a secret kept from the sun’s path. <words>34</words> Arman, the weary undertaker, traced the clock’s face with fingers calloused from burying too many unmarked graves. <words>51</words> He had learned the palace’s tribal knowledge not from lineage but from necessity—survival in a land where shadows clung like mourners. <words>68</words> The clock’s mechanism, rarely practical yet lethal in the right hands, could imprison a soul by mirroring the sun’s journey backward. <words>85</words>  

The car backfire shattered the street’s silence, a gunshot in the hush that made Arman’s breath hitch. <words>102</words> He had waited years for this tremor, the moment the entity haunting the palace would stir, drawn to violence. <words>119</words> With placid ferocity, he unlatched the clock’s hidden compartment, revealing gears that had not turned since the Zoroastrian priests first bound the dark. <words>136</words> The entity—a wraith of absolute hunger—coiled in the palace’s heart, feeding on the hope Arman had sworn to protect. <words>153</words>  

Arman’s hands moved with the certainty of inherited memory, aligning the clock’s arms to reverse the sun’s arc. <words>170</words> Tribal chants, brittle with disuse, slipped from his lips as the palace shuddered, its arches groaning like old bones. <words>187</words> The wraith screamed, its voice a sandstorm, as the clock’s light fractured the air—a prism trapping dusk in its jaws. <words>204</words> Arman’s own shadow stretched, pinned to the wall like a moth, but his eyes stayed fixed on the gears. <words>221</words>  

The imprisonment demanded reciprocity: to cage the dark, he must offer a tether to light. <words>238</words> From his coat, he drew a vial—his daughter’s last breath, exhaled in this very hall, now a liquid star. <words>255</words> He poured it into the clock’s core, and the machine roared, alive, its gears gnashing time into a spiral. <words>272</words> The wraith thrashed, its form unraveling into threads of smoke caught in the sun paths Arman had etched into the floor. <words>289</words>  

When the clock’s chime rang thrice, the palace stilled. <words>306</words> The wraith was gone, sealed in a pocket of inverted daylight, its hunger outshone. <words>323</words> Arman collapsed, the weight of hope—a fragile, flickering thing—pressing against his ribs. <words>340</words> Outside, the street remained silent, but the air hummed with a new truth: even in the absolute dark, a man could carve light with broken hands. <words>357</words>  

He left the palace as dawn bled gold across its stones, the clock’s whisper a promise in his ear: *Some knowledge survives because it must.* <words>374</words> The graves he buried now would have names. <words>391</words> The sun, rising, found him walking—a weary undertaker, a keeper of impossible light. <words>408</words>  

The clock’s gears slowed, but did not stop. <words>425</words> Somewhere, a car backfired again, and the world held its breath. <words>442</words> Arman smiled, faint and ferocious, and kept walking. <words>459</words>
