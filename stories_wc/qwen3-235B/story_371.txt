The storm had spent its final growl hours ago, leaving Neonreach’s night market slick with rain and flickering holograms that hissed like wounded serpents. <words>17</words>  
Cass Vey, a swashbuckler whose coin purse was as hollow as their optimism, ducked into a derelict tenement, boots crunching on shattered glass and circuits. <words>34</words>  
Their coat—a patchwork of moth-eaten velvet and scavenged synthweave—clung to them, fashionably unfashionable, a relic of better days spent dueling debt collectors. <words>50</words>  
Beneath a rusted bedframe, something caught their eye: a swirl of antique marbles, their glass cores swirling with data-light, scattered as if mapping a secret. <words>68</words>  
Cass knelt, retrieving a tarnished hatpin from their lapel, its filigree etched with coordinates only their grandfather had ever deciphered. <words>83</words>  
When the pin’s tip pierced the marbles’ glow, they emitted a harmonic whine, projecting a hologrid onto the cracked wall—a blueprint of the market’s underbelly. <words>101</words>  
A child’s laughter echoed nearby. Cass froze. In a world on fire, kindness was a currency no one spent, yet here it lingered, fragile and defiant. <words>120</words>  
The marbles’ map led to a sealed bunker beneath the market’s skeletal remains, where a girl with a bioluminescent scar clutched a moth-eaten teddy bear. <words>139</words>  
Hunters in plasma-stitched dusters found them first, guns humming, eyes hungry for the bounty on the girl’s head—or her tech-enhanced blood. <words>157</words>  
Cass’s blade, half-sabre and half-scrap, sang as it deflected shots, the hatpin now fused to their palm, guiding the marbles’ light into a shield of refracted energy. <words>177</words>  
“You’re broke,” the girl whispered, as Cass shoved her behind a generator, “Why protect me?” <words>190</words>  
“Grandfather taught me,” Cass grunted, parrying a blast that scorched their shoulder, “kindness outlasts bullets.” <words>206</words>  
The marbles’ swirl intensified, revealing a hidden exit tunnel. Cass herded the girl inside, the hatpin searing their skin as it locked the door behind them. <words>224</words>  
Above, the market erupted in fresh violence, but here, in the dark, the child’s bear glowed faintly, mirroring the marbles’ dance—a quieter, older code. <words>243</words>  
They emerged at dawn in the Greenzone, where vines choked neon and the air smelled of soil, not smoke. Cass tossed the hatpin into a creek. <words>262</words>  
“Why’d you do that?” the girl asked, clutching their scorched coat. <words>274</words>  
“It’s a new world,” Cass said, watching the marbles’ light fade in the sunrise. “Time to stop charting ruins.” <words>292</words>  
The child nodded, and for the first time in years, Cass felt the weight of their sword not as a burden, but a promise—to shelter what the storm couldn’t break. <words>313</words>  
They walked into the green, the girl humming a lullaby their grandfather once sang, the marbles’ secret now buried where only kindness could find it. <words>332</words>
