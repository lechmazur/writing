The homeless philosopher-king shuffled through the sandstone labyrinth, his threadbare cloak snagging on ancient walls, clutching a weather-beaten kaleidoscope that refracted the floating lanterns’ glow into fractured constellations. <words>22</words>  
He had once ruled a kingdom of questions, until transformative betrayal by his jester—his most earnestly frivolous confidant—had unseated him, leaving him to puzzle out a labyrinth once thought unsolvable: the paradox of truth in a world built on lies. <words>45</words>  
Each dusk, during readings conducted beneath arches where shadows whispered riddles, he extended the kaleidoscope to strangers, its cracked lens offering visions of their lives reassembled into new patterns, each twist a parable. <words>68</words>  
But his true ritual unfolded at random weddings, where he’d storm the festivities, hurling confetti-coded proposals into the air—schematics for utopias, maps to inner peace, all inked on biodegradable paper roses. <words>89</words>  
Guests laughed, dismissing him as a mad relic, unaware these scraps held ciphers only the betrayed could decode: his exiled queen, the mercenary who’d bought her loyalty, even the jester himself, all bound by his silent plea—*recognize me*. <words>113</words>  
The labyrinth’s walls shifted subtly each night, but he’d begun to notice a pattern: lanterns flickered in sequences matching the confetti codes, as if the structure itself responded to his proposals. <words>136</words>  
On the 100th wedding, a bride caught his kaleidoscope’s reflection mid-vow, gasped, and tore open her bouquet to reveal a paper rose he’d thrown years prior—her mother, the queen’s traitorous advisor, had tucked it there as a deathbed apology. <words>163</words>  
The philosopher-king collapsed at the altar, the labyrinth shuddering into stillness above him; its heart, a chamber of mirrors, now lay exposed, its floor etched with the same spiraling script as his confetti. <words>187</words>  
He crawled inward, kaleidoscope trembling, and found the final piece: a shard of glass inscribed *“The betrayer is the bridge.”* Pressing it to his temple, he saw his jester’s face merge with his own. <words>211</words>  
Betrayal had not been an end, but a prism—his fall had scattered his voice into the world, and only by extending those fragments could he reassemble the whole. <words>234</words>  
He emerged at dawn, the labyrinth now a ruin behind him, and pocketed the kaleidoscope; its purpose was spent. The confetti, though, he’d keep. There were still weddings to crash, still bridges to burn—and through them, perhaps, a new kingdom to build. <words>261</words>  
Floating lanterns trailed him as he walked, their light less a guide than a witness, illuminating the absurdity and splendor of a philosopher-king who’d learned that answers, like confetti, were meant to be thrown, not held. <words>287</words>
