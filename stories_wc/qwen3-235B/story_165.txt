<story>  
The gentle conjurer knelt in the silent forest as a brittle branch snapped beneath their boot, the sound fracturing the stillness like a portent. <words>17</words>  
They had followed the whispers of reversed messages etched into birch bark and river stones for weeks, all leading to the dwarven underground city where justice for the forgotten garden awaited. <words>40</words>  
The garden’s ruins haunted their dreams—thornless roses, wilted violets, a fountain choked with ash—symbols of a world unbalanced by ancient greed. <words>59</words>  
Now, in the dwarves’ abandoned halls, they found the stained glass butterfly, its wings shattered into jagged sapphire and amber shards, inscrutably obvious in its purpose: to guide the rebirth of what was lost. <words>89</words>  
The conjurer’s hands trembled, not from fear but the weight of joyous terror, as they pressed a palm to the cold mosaic. <words>103</words>  
The dwarves had sealed the city when the garden died, blaming themselves for mining too deep, unleashing a rot that consumed roots and trust alike. <words>127</words>  
But the butterfly’s fragments hummed with reversed truths—their own reflections distorted, urging the conjurer to reassemble not just glass but memory. <words>149</words>  
Each shard, when turned, revealed a word backward: “*gnilbetal*” became “*lamenting*,” “*dneirf*” became “*friend*,” a lexicon of restoration. <words>171</words>  
Hours blurred as the conjurer pieced together wings, their magic coaxing the glass to remember its former glow, until the butterfly pulsed with a light like dawn. <words>198</words>  
It rose, trailing prismatic dust, and the walls shuddered, stone groaning as hidden mechanisms whirred to life—a bridge of roots unfurling from the garden’s corpse to the city’s heart. <words>225</words>  
The dwarves emerged, faces etched with shame and hope, their beards dusted with centuries of dust. <words>239</words>  
The butterfly hovered above the conjurer’s outstretched hand, its wings now bearing a map of seeds and constellations, a pact between soil and sky. <words>264</words>  
“Justice,” the eldest dwarf rasped, “is not in blame but in mending what the ancestors broke.” <words>283</words>  
Together, they planted the seeds encoded in the glass—oaks from emerald shards, lilies from crimson—each bloom a rebuttal to decay. <words>307</words>  
The fountain erupted anew, its waters clear as the conjurer’s laughter, a sound both joy and terror in a world reborn. <words>327</words>  
As the dwarves rebuilt their forges beside the garden’s edge, the butterfly perched on a willow, its wings whispering, “*Look backward to heal forward.*” <words>352</words>  
The conjurer lingered until the first stars ignited, knowing their quest was not an end but a thread in justice’s endless tapestry. <words>376</words>  
They left the city humming with life, the brittle forest above now cradling a secret: even broken things could reassemble, if only one listened in reverse. <words>403</words>  
And when the wind carried the garden’s scent to distant valleys, children would say a stained glass butterfly danced there, stitching the world together. <words>429</words>
