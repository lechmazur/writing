<story>  
The tired swordsman slumped against the chipped stone wall of the floating rock monastery’s breakroom, his calloused fingers tracing the frayed seams of a plain cloth bag resting on his lap. <words>22</words>  
He had resigned himself to silence weeks ago, retreating to this place where the air hummed with forgotten prayers and the weight of stillness felt like absolution. <words>43</words>  
But the resignation letter on the table—a colleague’s departure, another soul unshackled from the monastery’s endless vigil—stirred something he’d buried beneath fiercely apathetic years. <words>66</words>  
The bag, empty now, had once carried his master’s ashes. A hidden promise to scatter them where the sky “bled fire,” a phrase that had always sounded like a child’s fantasy. <words>91</words>  
He scoffed at the memory, yet his gaze drifted upward, through the breakroom’s arched window, to the twilight where meteor showers streaked like cracks in the heavens. <words>115</words>  
The old man had been obsessed with such omens, claiming they marked paths to truths too vast for mortal grasp. <words>134</words>  
The swordsman never believed him—until now, when the spark of defiance flickered in his chest, sharp and inconvenient, as if the universe itself refused his surrender. <words>159</words>  
He stood abruptly, the bag slipping into his coat like a relic of a half-remembered vow, and climbed to the monastery’s highest ledge, where the wind tore at his cloak and the meteors burned brighter. <words>186</words>  
There, he traced their trajectory, noting how they converged beyond the eastern ridge—a place no map named, where the sky seemed to swallow the horizon. <words>209</words>  
The journey would be foolish, suicidal even, but the thought of returning to the breakroom’s suffocating quiet, of letting the ashes rot in anonymity, felt like a betrayal he couldn’t articulate. <words>237</words>  
He moved at dawn, navigating canyons of suspended stone and forests of crystalline thorns, the meteor trails his only guide. <words>257</words>  
Each step unraveled the numbness he’d cultivated; he remembered the master’s laughter, the way he’d spun tales of celestial rivers while the swordsman sharpened his blade in stoic silence. <words>283</words>  
By the third night, exhaustion gnawed at him, but the meteors grew fiercer, their light carving a path to a cliffside where the air pulsed with static and heat. <words>307</words>  
At the edge, he untied the bag, its emptiness a mirror to the void he’d tried to become. <words>323</words>  
But as the final meteor blazed overhead, its glow illuminating a valley below—a valley awash in bioluminescent fire, the very “bleeding sky” of legend—he hesitated, breath catching in a throat gone dry. <words>351</words>  
The ashes scattered with the wind’s first whisper, spiraling into the luminous expanse, and something in him fractured, not with grief, but with the raw clarity of having *chosen*. <words>377</words>  
He did not stay to watch the valley swallow the remnants. <words>390</words>  
Returning was irrelevant; the monastery’s silence could no longer claim him. <words>402</words>  
The swordsman walked, not toward the breakroom, but toward the horizon where defiance and wonder collided—a man no longer tired, but trembling with the weight of having once again *believed*. <words>429</words>
