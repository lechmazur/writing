The surly watchman paced the sailor’s graveyard, his boots crunching on fallen oak leaves as the last gasp of autumn wind whipped through gravestone cracks, serenely frantic like the tide’s eternal argument with the shore. <words>24</words>  
He clutched a short piece of indigo yarn, frayed at the ends, salvaged from a fishing net traded at the midnight market where wisdom was currency and silence the loudest bargaining chip. <words>47</words>  
The yarn was a key, not to a lock, but to a riddle etched into the oldest tombstone—a spiral of knots and waves that the dead sailors whispered about when the moon drowned itself in the horizon. <words>72</words>  
He’d learned the craft of reading knots from his grandfather, a whaler with hands like weathered rope, who’d said, “Patterns ain’t just in the sea, boy. They’re in the gaps between what we see and what we survive.” <words>104</words>  
Now, the watchman unraveled the yarn, its fibers trembling like harp strings in the wind, and traced the gravestone’s grooves, where lichen had begun to mimic the very knots his grandfather taught him. <words>131</words>  
The riddle was a question without words: *What binds the living to the drowned, yet floats free?* The watchman’s breath hitched—a sailor’s graveyard wasn’t for the dead, but for the living who couldn’t let go. <words>161</words>  
He knotted the yarn into a starfish pattern, mirroring the constellation above the easternmost headstone, where the first frost of winter kissed the stone like a warning. <words>187</words>  
A low hum rose from the earth, harmonizing with the creak of distant ship masts repurposed as grave markers, their shadows stitching the sky into the soil. <words>210</words>  
The answer wasn’t a thing, but a motion: weaving. The living wove memories into rituals, into markets, into the very nets that fed them, while the dead clung to the loose threads. <words>236</words>  
He’d been surly not from bitterness, but from the weight of seeing the pattern—how grief and survival were the same tide, how the graveyard was a loom where souls were carded and spun. <words>264</words>  
As the first snowflake fell, dissolving on the yarn’s indigo strands, the graves quieted, their stories no longer clawing at his ankles but settling like silt into the weave of the world. <words>291</words>  
Market wisdom had taught him that value was a myth; what mattered was the exchange—the way the yarn had passed from fisherman to trader to his calloused hands, each link a stitch in the cosmic cloth. <words>321</words>  
He left the yarn on the riddled stone, a toll for the dead, and walked into the season-between-seasons, his boots no longer heavy, the chaos of the in-between now a serenity only he understood. <words>349</words>  
The graveyard would keep its dignity, the wind its frantic hymns, and he, a watchman no longer surly, but a knot in the vast, breathing net of everything. <words>375</words>
