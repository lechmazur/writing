The hidden assassin polished the moss-covered lantern with a cloth dampened by clock oil, its greenish patina reflecting the dim glow of the water clock repair shop’s single bulb. <words>17</words>  
He adored this hour—between chapters of his double life—when the rhythmic drip of calibrated time soothed the static in his skull. <words>28</words>  
His clients came seeking precision, unaware their watches were mended by hands that had slit throats in three continents, hands that trembled only when recalling his sister’s bleak eulogy, scrawled in a ledger beneath false names. <words>50</words>  
The shop was a mausoleum of seconds, each gear and spring a relic of some forgotten life, much like the lantern, its glass fogged with decades of rainwater and regret. <words>70</words>  
He’d found it in his father’s crypt, alongside a note: *“To transmute pain into a masterpiece, first drown it in routine.”* <words>84</words>  
The phrase haunted him, a quietly flamboyant mantra he recited while poisoning a diplomat’s pocket watch or resetting a gangster’s broken chronometer. <words>101</words>  
Tonight’s client was a widow in a moth-eaten shawl, her husband’s heirloom pocket watch “broken,” she claimed, though her trembling lips told another story. <words>120</words>  
He motioned her to a chair, noting the mud on her boots—fresh, from the cemetery three blocks east, where his last target had been buried that morning. <words>137</words>  
As he worked, she spoke of her husband’s “accidental” death, her voice a eulogy rehearsed too often. <words>149</words>  
He listened, his blade hidden beneath the counter, its edge dulled by the weight of secrets he’d carved into the lantern’s base over years. <words>164</words>  
When she slid an envelope across the table—payment, and a slip of paper with coordinates—he smiled, the gesture as hollow as the gears he replaced. <words>183</words>  
The address led to a warehouse where, hours later, he found her husband alive, laughing over a ledger of forged timepieces. <words>197</words>  
The man’s surprise was a masterpiece: eyes widening as the lantern’s glow revealed the assassin’s face, a ghost from his wife’s past, a brother he’d left to drown in a river. <words>220</words>  
He killed him quietly, flamboyantly precise, and tucked the slip of paper into the man’s coat—a clue for the widow, a final act of transmuted grief. <words>239</words>  
Back at the shop, he etched the husband’s eulogy onto the lantern’s moss: *“A man who mistook time for a circle, not a noose.”* <words>256</words>  
The widow arrived at dawn, her shawl replaced by a thief’s smirk, and reclaimed her husband’s watch, now ticking with a killer’s rhythm. <words>274</words>  
He watched her leave, wondering if she’d ever know the truth—that her revenge was a duet, two broken souls composing a symphony of lies. <words>294</words>  
Outside, rain began to fall, and he lit the lantern, its light a bleak beacon in the gloom, a thing both beautiful and terrible to behold. <words>313</words>  
He adored it, this life of fractured moments, each kill a brushstroke in a gallery no one would ever see. <words>328</words>  
The clocks ticked on, indifferent, as he opened his ledger to a blank page, pen poised above the next chapter’s first lie. <words>346</words>
