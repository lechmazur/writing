The remote herbalist lived in the shadow of an ancient Japanese castle, its stone walls reimagined into a sanctuary of moss and wild chrysanthemums, where she pressed petals into brittle pages of a leather-bound book <words>22</words>. Each afternoon, during art classes held in the castle’s lantern-lit hall, she slid the book across tatami mats, its pressed violets and encoded meteor showers visible only to those who lingered <words>45</words>. Her students—painters, poets—sought her subtle guidance, though none guessed her true work: decoding the night sky’s fleeting patterns to reposition the castle’s forgotten wards <words>72</words>. One student, a boy with ink-stained palms, began mirroring her gestures, arranging charcoal sketches of constellations beside her flowered glyphs, their dialogue unspoken yet precise <words>101</words>. Years earlier, a meteor’s path had led her here, to this castle, this boy, whose fate had always been knotted to hers—a truth written in the space between blooming and decay <words>131</words>. When the boy traced a star-shower’s arc onto his sketchpad, she moved, relocating a camellia to the eastern garden, its roots now guarding a fracture in time only the dead could cross <words>163</words>. Their silent exchange deepened: he painted ghosts of flowers she’d never pressed; she brewed teas from blossoms he left at her door, each blend a question, each sip an answer <words>194</words>. On the final class, he placed his sketchpad open to a drawing of her—back turned, hands buried in soil, meteor trails weaving through her hair—and beneath it, a single word: *Stay* <words>226</words>. She did not. Instead, she pressed his drawing into her book, its edges already fraying like the boundary between their worlds, and walked into the hills, where the castle’s wards hummed in quiet approval <words>257</words>. That night, the boy watched a meteor fracture the sky, its light bending around the castle spires, and understood: some conversations are eternal precisely because they are never translated into sound <words>289</words>. Decades later, visitors would find the herbalist’s book tucked beneath a stone in the garden, its flowers still faintly luminous, its patterns guiding new hands to reposition what time had displaced <words>323</words>. The boy, now old, would return each autumn to trace her corrections into the earth, his sketches blooming where her silence had once spoken <words>349</words>. Their fates, like pressed petals, remained intertwined in the castle’s breath, in the weight of unspoken things held gently aloft <words>372</words>. The wards endured, not through incantation, but through the quiet arithmetic of attention—a language older than either of them, older than the stones themselves <words>400</words>. And when the last meteor of the season fell, its light slipped into the cracks of the world, stitching together what distance had unraveled <words>425</words>. The castle stood. The garden grew. The book remained open, a page turned but never closed <words>447</words>.
