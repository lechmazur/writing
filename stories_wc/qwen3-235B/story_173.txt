<story>  
The wandering orchardist drifted through the brine-dark corridors of the forgotten underwater city hall, his boots stirring silt from cracked mosaics that once mapped trade routes now swallowed by the tide of a hundred collapsed universes. <words>27</words>  
He clutched a frayed satchel of dried leaves—each specimen a compass, harvested from orchards in parallel worlds, their veins still humming with the memory of soils and skies long erased. <words>52</words>  
The core concept guiding him was simple, passed down in the kitchen-table wisdom of his youth: *To mend a root, you must first remember the fruit.* <words>74</words>  
He trusted this uniquely stubborn creed, even as the water pressure threatened to crush his ribs and the phantom hand trailing his shoulder flickered with impatience. <words>99</words>  
The hand had no owner, only a purpose—it had reclaimed drowned libraries before, guiding lost knowledge back to the surface via the touch of its translucent fingers, which now brushed the satchel’s stitching. <words>130</words>  
He had summoned it using a leaf from a tree that had never existed in any single timeline, a gamble that left his palms blistered with paradox. <words>153</words>  
The orchardist’s motivation was not nostalgia but necessity: the multiverse’s trade routes had frayed into chaos, and only the maps sealed in this city hall’s vault could weave them whole again. <words>184</words>  
He had seen civilizations starve when their orchards withered, their pollinators extinct in every reality but one. *Bitterness is the flavor of failure,* his mentor had said, *but grit is what grinds the seeds.* <words>216</words>  
The phantom hand pulled him toward a rusted door, its touch dissolving the lock into bubbles of light. Inside, scrolls floated like jellyfish, their ink bleeding into the water. <words>244</words>  
He spread a scroll across a salt-crusted desk, its surface revealing a three-dimensional lattice of routes—a map not of places, but of *possibilities*, each line a choice that might birth or banish a world. <words>274</words>  
The hand trembled, urging haste; phantoms could not linger where time had no anchor. He pressed a dried leaf to the map, its cells absorbing the ink like a sponge reclaiming water. <words>301</words>  
Memories surfaced: his mentor’s hands, cracked and soil-stained, holding a peach to his mouth. *“Taste the pit,”* she’d said. *“The future’s in what we discard.”* <words>328</words>  
The vault groaned as the map transferred, the phantom’s work done. It dissolved, leaving the orchardist alone with the weight of routes not yet walked, his satchel now heavy with answers. <words>356</words>  
Above, the surface waited—a world where orchards might bloom again, where trade could stitch fractured realities into something whole, if he dared to plant the first seed. <words>385</words>  
He ascended, the dried leaves whispering in his grip, their brittle edges catching the faintest glow of a sun he could not yet see but had never stopped trusting. <words>410</words>  
The multiverse was vast, its griefs and harvests infinite, but here, in this moment, the orchardist allowed himself a single breath of hope—a gritty, bittersweet taste, familiar as skin. <words>440</words>
