The Marquess of Wexhaven, a man whose spine seemed perpetually bent to the will of others, knelt in the hydrangea beds, pruning shears in hand, when the dull letter opener glinted up at him from the soil—a forgotten relic of his late father’s correspondence. <words>37</words>  
He turned it over, noting the dents along its blade, the kind left by hurried hands prying open missives sealed with excessive wax; his unusually perceptive mind cataloged the details as he cataloged the sighs of servants or the tremors in his uncle’s voice during auctions. <words>74</words>  
A low hum vibrated through the garden wall—words distorted, then amplified—the echo chambers beneath the estate’s “secret agent workshop,” a folly his family had funded but never understood. <words>108</words>  
Curiosity, a trait he’d long disguised as submissiveness, drew him to press his ear to the damp stone. <words>123</words>  
“…the serum liquifies on contact,” hissed a voice he didn’t recognize. “The creature’s cells destabilize. We’ll have our weapon by dawn.” <words>149</words>  
The Marquess froze, the letter opener tightening in his grip; his father’s tales of the workshop’s true purpose—bioweapons, espionage—had always been dismissed as aristocratic gossip, but now the pieces slotted into place with the cruel precision of a puzzle. <words>185</words>  
He slipped inside through a ventilation grate, the air thick with the tang of ozone and fear, until he found it: a cage, humming with electromagnetic fields, within which pulsed a gelatinous creature, its translucent body flickering like a dying star. <words>223</words>  
It regarded him with no eyes, yet he felt its terror—a silent empathy that bypassed language, a kinship of the perpetually misunderstood. <words>247</words>  
Above, boots thudded; the agents were returning. <words>257</words>  
The Marquess jabbed the letter opener into the control panel, its blunt edge grinding against circuits until sparks hissed and the cage’s field dissolved. <words>285</words>  
The creature slumped, liquid yet alive, pooling into the grooves of the floorboards as if mapping an escape. <words>303</words>  
“You’re *quiet*,” one agent sneered, yanking the Marquess up by his cravat. “Think you’re clever, hiding your snooping behind that vacant stare?” <words>331</words>  
“Clever?” the Marquess replied, letting his voice drip with the flippant earnestness he’d honed at royal banquets. “I merely dislike loud noises. Imagine the scandal if your… *experiment* were to, say, liquefy your shoes instead of that poor thing.” <words>370</words>  
He kicked the opener toward the creature, now seeping into the ventilation pipes, its path homing in on the estate’s moat—a sanctuary. <words>392</words>  
The agents lunged, but the Marquess, ever perceptive, had already turned his back, whistling as he climbed into the garden, the weight of complicity liquifying in his chest like ice under a fever. <words>424</words>  
Later, he’d claim he’d only wanted to prune roses. <words>435</words>  
The hydrangeas, after all, bloomed best when roots were left undisturbed. <words>450</words>
