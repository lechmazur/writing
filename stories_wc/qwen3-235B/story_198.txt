The floating island’s cloud-gazing platform trembled as Mara descended the worn flight of stairs, her calloused hands brushing the rail, each step a whisper of collapse. <words>22</words>  
She was the fervent caretaker of the rustic spinning wheel perched at the island’s edge, a relic that hummed with the weight of unspoken truths. <words>40</words>  
For decades, she’d followed sun trails across the sky, mapping their dance to mend the fraying threads of this parallel dimension—a world that clung to her oddly faithful devotion. <words>62</words>  
The wheel, gnarled and iron-bound, spun not yarn but time itself, weaving the illusion of stability over the void below. <words>81</words>  
But today, the sun trails faltered, their light pooling like spilled honey at her feet, urging her toward the final step. <words>98</words>  
Mara’s breath hitched; she’d long suspected the wheel’s song was a prison, not a promise. <words>113</words>  
Her motivation had always been survival—to escape the dimension’s slow suffocation—but the truth now clawed at her: her own hands had anchored it. <words>136</words>  
The wheel’s spindle whirred, a metallic sigh, as she pressed her palm to its surface, the wood warm as a fever. <words>154</words>  
Fragile ferocity burned in her chest—she’d nurtured this thing, fed it her youth, while it devoured the sky. <words>171</words>  
A cloud shifted, revealing the jagged horizon of another world, and Mara lunged, seizing the spindle to mangle its song. <words>190</words>  
Splinters bit her skin as the wheel screamed, unraveling threads of gold that seared her arms, her vision, her soul. <words>208</words>  
The platform shuddered, cracks spiderwebbing beneath her boots, the air thick with the scent of burnt linen and ozone. <words>227</words>  
She twisted the spindle until it snapped, the fracture splitting the sky like a wound. <words>243</words>  
Downward spiraled the island, clouds tearing away to reveal endless stars, and Mara fell with it, weightless, the wheel’s remnants clutched to her chest. <words>267</words>  
The truth was a blade: the wheel had been her own heart, stitched into service by a god’s forgotten whim. <words>286</words>  
As dimensions peeled apart, she glimpsed the next caretaker—a child on a sister island—reaching for a newborn wheel. <words>304</words>  
Mara’s laughter was bitter, a storm in her throat; she’d broken the cycle, but the loom of worlds would spin on. <words>323</words>  
The stairs had ended, but the fall was infinite, and in her palm, a final sun trail glimmered—a thread to grasp, or sever. <words>345</words>  
Her fingers opened, then closed. <words>355</words>  
The trail dissolved, and Mara let the dark take her, a smile flickering—feral, fleeting—as the truth’s echo lingered: freedom was a choice, not a destination. <words>380</words>  
Above, the platform vanished, and the new caretaker’s cry faded, the wheel’s song restarting, softer now, unsteady. <words>399</words>  
Mara drifted, a speck in the unmaking, her ferocity spent, her faith finally still. <words>415</words>  
The dimension shuddered, exhaled, and the stars blinked out, one by one. <words>427</words>
