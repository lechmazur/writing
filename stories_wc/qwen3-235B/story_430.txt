The kaleidoscope park shimmered with charmingly grotesque hues—flowers blooming in neon vomit-green, benches warped like arthritic spines, the air thick with the cloying perfume of rotting lilies. <words>27</words>  
A closed-off reaver, their coat stitched from scavenged crow feathers, kicked through the detritus of yesterday’s picnics, sneering at a child’s drawing half-buried in the mud: a stick-figure family dangling from a tree, smiling. <words>54</words>  
They nagged the empty park, voice a serrated purr, “Sentiment’s a currency that expires at sunset,” but kept the paper, its edges fraying like old skin. <words>79</words>  
Generational patterns, the reaver knew, were chains forged in forgiveness—something their father’s axe never cleaved, something their mother’s silence had drowned. <words>104</words>  
That night, by lantern glow, they traced the child’s scrawled poems in the margins: *“Stars taste like peppermint if you kiss the sky right.”* A laugh, bitter and sudden, escaped them. <words>134</words>  
Mocking affection curled their lip as they wrote replies in the void’s native tongue—equations of want and weariness—addressing no one, least of all the ghost of their first love, who’d once pressed a compass to their palm and said, “Navigate better than I did.” <words>172</words>  
The park’s mirrors fractured time; before the first lie is told, there’s always a rehearsal. <words>187</words>  
They remembered that love’s last kiss: salt and iron, the faintest whisper of starlight swallowed by regret. <words>203</words>  
“Sentiment’s a currency,” they hissed again, but now to the drawing’s smudged sun, its too-bright grin. <words>221</words>  
A week later, they returned to the park, tucking their feathered coat around the child’s drawing, now framed in a locket of tarnished silver—their father’s, stolen posthumously. <words>249</words>  
Generational patterns, they thought, could drown in the right kind of rain. <words>263</words>  
When the nagging quieted, when the reaver pressed their lips to the locket’s back and tasted peppermint, they understood the poem’s arithmetic: one kiss, infinite stars, a lie told only to the past. <words>296</words>  
The first lie—*“I never cared”*—hovered, unspoken, on their tongue. <words>308</words>  
Instead, they carved a new margin-poem on the bark of the stick-figure tree: *“Forgive the axe. Forgive the silence. Forgive the compass, spinning still.”* <words>337</words>  
The park shifted, its grotesque colors softening to something like hope. <words>350</words>  
They never tasted the stars, not exactly—but the kiss they gave the wind, fierce and directionless, carried the weight of a hundred unburdened generations. <words>378</words>  
The child’s drawing, now sap-stained and rooted deep, sprouted a new poem in its margins, written in a hand both stranger and kin: *“You’re learning. That’s enough.”* <words>407</words>  
The reaver laughed, a sound like rusted bells, and let the lie die unborn. <words>423</words>  
Generational patterns, after all, were chains—and chains could be worn as crowns. <words>440</words>  
The kaleidoscope park hummed, its grotesque beauty sharpening into focus, and the reaver walked home, humming a lullaby their mother had never sung. <words>465</words>
