The dutiful sentinel adjusted the cracked plastic hair clip securing their lab coat, a relic from a sister who’d vanished into the photosynthesis research lab’s sublevels two years prior. <words>17</words>  
They’d promised her they’d finish her work, though the equations she’d left behind pulsed with a delightfully strange rhythm, as if the algae strains she’d engineered were whispering secrets through the ink. <words>42</words>  
Now, amid the clinking of wine glasses and wedding toasts echoing from the ballroom above, the sentinel crouched beneath a shared table at the reception, fingers brushing the detonator sewn into their sleeve. <words>69</words>  
The lab’s director—now the groom—had boasted during his speech about “harnessing dawn itself,” a lie the sentinel knew because the algae’s true purpose wasn’t energy but erasure: a bioweapon to dissolve the ozone, inviting the very sunrise they claimed to worship. <words>114</words>  
A guest laughed, their voice a jagged spark; the sentinel glanced up, meeting the eyes of a woman across the table, her auburn hair pinned with a twin to their own hair clip. <words>141</words>  
Recognition struck—a lab intern, vanished weeks after the sister, now groomed into complicity. <words>155</words>  
The sentinel slid the detonator toward her, their palm grazing hers, transmitting the tremor of a thousand untold stories: of spores that glowed like fireflies, of a sunrise no one believed in because it meant annihilation, of a sister who’d chosen to become part of the equation. <words>197</words>  
She hesitated, then slipped the device into her bouquet, her nod a primal chord of agreement. <words>213</words>  
Above, the groom raised his glass to “new beginnings,” his smile a serrated thing. <words>227</words>  
The sentinel stood, their voice slicing through the ballroom’s jazz: “Stories are algae. They bloom in silence until the toxins rise.” <words>249</words>  
Gasps rippled as the intern triggered the detonator, the lab’s sublevels erupting in a green-tinged concussive wave that shattered windows but spared the guests—redirected, the sentinel knew, to destroy only the vats where the sister’s name had been scrubbed from data streams. <words>289</words>  
As guests fled, the sentinel pressed the hair clip into the intern’s hand, its plastic prongs etched with the sister’s final notes: *“Photosynthesis isn’t survival. It’s a warning.”* <words>317</words>  
Dawn seeped through the ruined ballroom, the ozone intact, the sentinel’s duty fulfilled—not to a future, but to the raw, unvarnished chance of one. <words>343</words>  
The intern pocketed the clip, its teeth catching a sliver of light, and for a heartbeat, the world felt delightfully, terrifyingly strange. <words>363</words>  
They would write the story this time. <words>371</words>
