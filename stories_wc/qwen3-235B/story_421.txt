<story>  
The nomadic dreamer arrived at the flower pressing workshop just as the final petals were tucked beneath glassine sheets, their colors leaching into the parchment like whispered secrets. <words>17</words>  
She had followed the mariner’s wheel, its brass spokes tarnished but true, across deserts and deltas, guided by maps inked in starlight and half-remembered hymns. <words>35</words>  
Inside, seven figures in linen smocks stood in a circle, their hands clasped not in prayer but in the rigid grip of masked intentions, eyes flicking to the door as she entered. <words>53</words>  
The air smelled of crushed violets and iron, a scent that clawed at her throat, though she smiled ferociously polite, bowing low as if gravity itself owed her deference. <words>71</words>  
“You’re late,” said the eldest, his voice a blade sheathed in velvet, gesturing to a coin balanced on his thumb. <words>86</words>  
He flipped it—a silver flash in the hush after a coin toss decides fate—and when it landed, the dreamer saw the sigil of the Tideless Order etched on its face, a promise of drowned horizons. <words>106</words>  
They were here to unearth the Root of Tides, a relic said to bind sea and soil, to twist nature’s rhythm into a noose around human ambition. <words>124</words>  
Her mission, entrusted to her by the wind-scarred crones of the Salt Plains, was to intervene: to let the earth keep its secrets, its fractured harmony intact. <words>143</words>  
“A shame,” she murmured, her tone a blend of anguished joy, as if mourning a lover already lost. <words>155</words>  
The mariner’s wheel hummed in her satchel, its needle quivering toward the workshop’s hearth, where a trapdoor lay hidden beneath a mosaic of pressed peonies. <words>174</words>  
The eldest gestured again, and two acolytes lifted the slab, revealing a spiral stair descending into salt-crusted darkness. <words>189</words>  
She stepped forward, ferociously polite, and placed a hand on the wheel’s edge, her voice a low thrum. <words>203</words>  
“You mistake the Root for a tool. It’s a wound.” <words>212</words>  
The acolytes hesitated, their masked intentions cracking like glaze under flame. <words>224</words>  
The eldest snarled, but the dreamer spun the mariner’s wheel, its gears shrieking a language older than greed, and the stairs collapsed in a cascade of petals and stone. <words>244</words>  
They fled as the workshop shuddered, its walls exhaling centuries of preserved blooms, a requiem of spores and dust. <words>260</words>  
Outside, dawn bled gold over the fields, and the dreamer knelt, pressing a single dandelion into her journal, its frayed head a cipher for all she’d buried. <words>280</words>  
Harmony, she knew, was not a state but a scar—a thing won and lost in the same breath, like joy cradled in anguish’s palm. <words>300</words>  
The mariner’s wheel now lay silent, its purpose spent, as she turned westward, toward the next fracture in the world’s fragile song. <words>318</words>  
Behind her, the acolytes would tell tales of a woman who smiled like a storm and carried the earth’s grief in her pockets, but the truth was simpler: she never stopped listening. <words>341</words>  
The flowers, crushed and fleeting, understood. <words>350</words>
