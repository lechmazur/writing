<story>  
The dry-tongued bard slumped against the curved wall of the giant mushroom meeting hall, their calloused fingers tracing the grooves of a stained glass prism suspended at its apex, where spores drifted like liquid starlight. <words>22</words>  
The prism fractured the bioluminescent glow of the hall into jagged rainbows, each shard whispering forgotten names—a cacophony the bard had once tried to match with their cracked, hesitant voice. <words>44</words>  
Tonight, the hush of a dreamless night pressed against the mushroom’s translucent skin, and the bard wrapped themselves tighter in the cloak of doubt, a frayed relic woven from every audience’s silence, every lyric that withered mid-air. <words>73</words>  
They were gorgeously awkward: a tangle of ink-stained linen and half-finished ballads, eyes too wide for their face, voice too parched to tame the crowds that came to gawk but never stay. <words>99</words>  
A flicker in the prism’s light caught their attention—a pulse, not a flicker—and suddenly the glass spat out a spiral of sound: a voicemail, preserved in the resin of centuries. <words>122</words>  
“…don’t let the cloak feed on your breath,” hissed a woman’s voice, crackling like dry leaves. “Prisms split light, but they also stitch shadows. Use both.” <words>144</words>  
The bard recoiled. The cloak tightened, its threads slithering like vipers toward their throat. <words>155</words>  
They clawed at the collar, recalling the first time they’d donned it—a child in a tavern, trying to shield themselves from the jeers that followed their first botched hymn. <words>177</words>  
Another voicemail bloomed: a drunkard’s slurred confession. “I kept singing even when the world drowned me. You think your voice is broken? It’s a bridge. Stupid, brave bridge.” <words>204</words>  
The stained glass flared hotter. The bard staggered upright, prism in hand, and thrust it into the cloak’s swirling mass. <words>218</words>  
Light fractured through doubt, casting jagged hope onto the mushroom walls—a thousand versions of themselves, singing, laughing, weeping, all gorgeously, fiercely alive. <words>243</words>  
The cloak unraveled, its threads dissolving into moths that fluttered toward the prism’s glow. <words>256</words>  
A final voicemail hummed, softer than the rest: their own voice, from a night they’d forgotten. “Preserve the ache. It’s the only proof you’re still human.” <words>281</words>  
The bard let the prism drop, its chime resonating through the hall like a sigh. <words>293</words>  
When they stepped outside, dawn bled orange over the meadow, and their first unburdened note—a raw, trembling C—rose to meet it, cracking the sky open. <words>319</words>  
The mushroom’s spores followed, swirling in the updraft, carrying fragments of the cloak to distant ears. <words>334</words>  
They would not need it anymore. Doubt was a prison, yes, but also a teacher—it had led them here, to the fracture, to the bridge. <words>359</words>  
And somewhere, in the quiet marrow of the world, the voicemails still spun, stitching shadows into light, waiting for the next throat to tremble. <words>385</words>  
The bard walked on, their voice rough but ringing, a pilgrim in a world that had, at last, learned how to listen. <words>403</words>
