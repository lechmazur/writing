The outlaw cowboy poet rode into the brass-gear town of Meridian at dusk, his duster coat frayed like the edges of his conscience, the worn runic bone dice clutched in his calloused palm as if they might divine a way to outrun his past. <words>44</words>  
He’d heard the steampunk observatory dome housed a theater troupe rehearsing a play about celestial wars, a spectacle funded by the same industrialists who’d branded him a fugitive for verses that questioned their iron-fisted rule. <words>85</words>  
The dice hummed faintly, their glyphs shifting like smoke, a reminder of the night he’d gambled with a shadowed figure at a crossroads and lost everything but his voice—and the peculiar ability to misalign fate by reading between the lines of reality itself. <words>127</words>  
Inside the observatory’s café, walls etched with chalkboard menus pulsed with cryptic phrases that rewrote themselves hourly: *“The clockwork sun devours its children”* or *“Beneath the gaslight, lies wear spectacles.”* <words>164</words>  
He ordered black coffee, no eye contact, and let the dice tumble from his sleeve to clatter against the saucer, their vibrations syncing with the walls’ shifting text until the words blurred into a map only he could parse. <words>203</words>  
The rehearsals upstairs had grown shrill—the director’s shouts mingling with the whir of astrolabes—so he slipped into the gallery, where actors in brass-plated armor fumbled lines about intertwined destinies, their scripts as rigid as the gears grinding overhead. <words>245</words>  
By dawn, the poet had rewritten the play’s spine, scrawling amendments in charcoal on the café walls: *“The tyrant’s crown is a cage of sparrows”* and *“Every bullet’s path bends twice.”* <words>282</words>  
When the troupe read the altered text, their performances fractured into raw, jagged truths, the lead actor tearing off his helmet to scream, “Why do we rehearse a lie?”—a question that ignited the audience’s unstoppable curiosity on opening night. <words>324</words>  
The industrialists arrived mid-act, their monocles glinting with suspicion, but the poet was already gone, vanished into the labyrinth of gears beneath the dome, leaving only the dice behind, still warm with the fingerprints of a dozen possible futures. <words>366</words>  
He’d never sought redemption, only the thrill of a world unspooled, where every misalignment was a stanza in a larger poem—one that asked not who he was, but what he dared unmake. <words>405</words>  
The bone dice remained on the saucer, their runes now inert, while the café walls whispered his name in a loop: *“The outlaw, the outlaw, the outlaw…”* a refrain that would outlast the steam and the stars. <words>444</words>
