The steampunk observation deck, a lattice of brass railings and fog-streaked glass, trembled beneath the storm’s fury as Elias, the nostalgic tailor, tightened the final stitch on his masterpiece: a coat woven from threads of starlight and sorrow. <words>47</words>  
He had spent decades crafting it, each seam a requiem for the life he’d abandoned—a life where he’d chosen love over ambition, a cottage over the sky. <words>72</words>  
The dusty mirror at the deck’s center hummed, its surface rippling like liquid mercury, reflecting not Elias but a thousand other versions of himself: a soldier, a poet, a corpse. <words>100</words>  
They were the parallel lives he’d never lived, their faces pressed against the glass, whispering confessions only the storm could pry from them. <words>125</words>  
“Reassure them,” the mirror had urged him, its voice the creak of bending metal, “or none of you will ascend.” <words>147</words>  
Elias had scoffed then, but now, as lightning split the horizon, he understood: the last code—the cipher to transcend mortality—wasn’t mathematical, but emotional. <words>178</words>  
He pressed his palm to the glass, and the reflections stilled. “I wanted to stay,” he told the soldier, whose uniform bled crimson into the rain. “But I feared the war in my veins more than the void outside.” <words>213</words>  
The poet wept ink-black tears. “I wrote verses to fill the silence she left behind,” Elias murmured. “They were never enough.” <words>239</words>  
Each confession unknotted a thread in the coat, its fabric shimmering with lives half-remembered, half-imagined. <words>259</words>  
The storm deepened, thunder roaring like a beast at his back, as Elias faced his own reflection—the one that had stayed, the one that had loved. <words>286</words>  
“You think I chose this,” he growled, the menacing truth slithering out. “But the code was a lie. Ascension demands a price: all selves but one must die.” <words>315</words>  
The deck groaned; gears overhead sparked and shuddered. Elias’s hands trembled. To transcend mortal limits, he had to erase every path he’d never walked—to let the mirror devour them. <words>346</words>  
Yet as the tailor’s coat dissolved into light, he realized the mirror had lied again: it wasn’t erasure, but integration. The soldier’s resolve, the poet’s ache, the coward’s regret—all surged into him, forging something new. <words>381</words>  
The storm broke. Dawn seared the clouds as Elias stepped back, no longer a fragment, but a whole. The mirror cracked, its hunger spent. <words>404</words>  
He had not ascended. He had returned. To the world below, to the loom and the thread, to the hope that mortal limits were not chains, but soil. <words>430</words>  
And in the quiet after the tempest, the reflections smiled, their confessions finally heard. <words>449</words>
