<story>  
The morbid florist, neutrally passionate in their craft, arranged wilted lilies beneath the floating rock dojo’s glass ceiling, where constellations shifted like ink in water. <words>17</words>  
Their hands, stained with soil and resignation, positioned a plain white candle at the bouquet’s heart—a ritual object, neither mournful nor celebratory, but a bridge between. <words>34</words>  
The dojo, suspended above a churning void, hummed with the weight of tempered beliefs, its walls etched with equations mapping cosmic cycles no scholar had ever named. <words>51</words>  
Here, the florist obliged the dying requests of nameless wanderers, pressing their final words into petals, though they privately scoffed at the illusion of permanence. <words>69</words>  
Tonight, the lantern’s last flicker painted the room amber, its light clinging to the edges of a weathered trunk half-buried in the dojo’s stone floor. <words>87</words>  
Curiosity, or perhaps obligation, drew the florist to pry it open, revealing a backlog of typed pages—stories of a writer who’d sought the same cosmic truths the dojo whispered. <words>106</words>  
Each page obliquely detailed a journey through the void, encounters with floating monoliths, and the candle’s role as a “key” to unsee the self, a phrase that curdled the florist’s skepticism. <words>126</words>  
They lit the candle, its flame steady despite the dojo trembling, and read how the writer had drowned in the pursuit of cycles, their final entry a plea: “Burn this, and become the bridge.” <words>146</words>  
The florist hesitated, their neutrally passionate demeanor cracking as the lantern expired, leaving only the candle’s glow and the typed words accusing their complacency. <words>164</words>  
To oblige the writer’s ghost—or their own restless curiosity—they pressed the flame to the pages, watching ink dissolve into smoke that spiraled into a second, smaller floating rock above the dojo. <words>184</words>  
The new rock glowed faintly, its surface etched with the same equations, now incomplete, as if awaiting the florist’s contribution—or surrender. <words>200</words>  
They understood then: the dojo was no sanctuary, but a crucible, and the candle’s purpose was not to illuminate, but to transmute belief into something weightless and endless. <words>220</words>  
With a boldly timid resolve, the florist extinguished the flame, stepped onto the void, and let the cosmic cycles pull them upward, their body dissolving into spores that bloomed into lilies on the windless air. <words>241</words>  
The dojo drifted lower, the candle now unlit but unbroken, a new typed page materializing in the trunk: “The bridge obliges. The bridge is obliged. The bridge is neither.” <words>260</words>  
In the last flicker of what remained, the void seemed almost tender, swallowing certainty whole. <words>273</words>
