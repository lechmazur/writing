The brazen raider, Kael, plunged into the forgotten underwater city laboratory, their breath ragged beneath the helmet’s cracked visor. <words>17</words>  
Salt-crusted walls whispered of betrayal—echoes of scientists who’d drowned their ethics in pursuit of forbidden knowledge. <words>25</words>  
Kael’s gloved hand brushed a jagged piece of charcoal, half-buried in silt, and memory surged: a childhood game where charcoal Xs marked traitors’ doors. <words>40</words>  
Impulsively thoughtful, they pocketed the shard, its weight a grim compass guiding them deeper into the labyrinth. <words>50</words>  
Amid social upheaval above, where warlords carved the surface into fiefdoms, Kael sought something worth saving—not plunder, but purpose. <words>64</words>  
They found her in a chamber choked with bioluminescent algae: Dr. Lys, the faltering genius, her hands trembling as she calibrated a reactor core. <words>80</words>  
“Leave,” Lys hissed, her voice frayed. “This place isn’t safe.” <words>87</words>  
Kael laughed, sharp and hollow. “Neither’s the world. But I’ve seen what happens when minds like yours burn out alone.” <words>103</words>  
The charcoal burned in their pocket, a brand against betrayal—Kael’s own past a mosaic of broken allegiances, abandoned crews, survival over trust. <words>119</words>  
They warned her: “The warlords will come. Your reactor could power their machines—or bury them.” <words>131</words>  
Lys slumped. “I can’t finish it. The designs… they’re unraveling. Like me.” <words>142</words>  
Kael knelt, sketching a charcoal X on the floor—a youthful superstition to ward off ghosts. “Then we make them believe this place is cursed.” <words>157</words>  
For days, they etched warnings in charcoal: skeletal hands, drowning eyes, the old symbols of doom. Kael’s impulsivity sharpened into focus, each stroke a pact. <words>174</words>  
Lys watched, her despair softening into curiosity. “Why protect me?” <words>183</words>  
“Because I know what it’s like to be a ghost before you’re dead,” Kael muttered, the charcoal smudging their past into the walls. <words>198</words>  
When the warlords came, their floodlights sliced the dark, but the charcoal sigils glowed faintly—a primal language of fear. <words>212</words>  
The raiders fled, muttering of drowned curses, leaving Kael and Lys in the reactor’s thrumming hush. <words>224</words>  
“You could’ve left with them,” Lys said, her voice steadier now. <words>234</words>  
Kael shook their head, the helmet’s crack splitting their reflection. “I’m done running from echoes.” <words>248</words>  
In the end, the reactor flared—a fragile, blue-white flame—and Kael stood sentinel, charcoal-X scars on their palms a vow. <words>264</words>  
The city crumbled around them, but the warnings held, and the surface’s chaos ebbed, a fractured grace woven from ash and defiance. <words>280</words>  
Kael never saw the dawn, but Lys did, her genius no longer faltering, the charcoal’s memory a map to something better. <words>296</words>
