The jaded bartender wiped down the counter of the crystal growing laboratory’s makeshift bar, her fingers trembling around a bloodstained medical scalpel she’d found lodged in a drawer labeled “Fate’s Scraps.” <words>22</words>  
Outside, the city held its breath in the final stillness before fireworks ignited, their glow already bleeding into the lab’s glass walls, staining the humming crystal arrays amber and violet. <words>40</words>  
She’d globalized her despair years ago, fleeing a surgical career after a patient’s death she couldn’t reconcile—a stranger then, but now a ghost she traced in overlapping doodles on bar receipts, each sketch a fractal echoing the crystals’ jagged symmetry. <words>71</words>  
Tonight, the receipts had aligned: a star, a scar, a spiral, all converging on this lab, where Dr. Vey, the lead scientist, preached that crystals could record time itself, their lattices storing memories like frozen lightning. <words>103</words>  
The bartender didn’t care about memories; she sought answers in the scalpel’s edge, its rust a map to whoever had carved those doodles into her psyche. <words>124</words>  
Vey’s voice crackled over the intercom, urging technicians to stabilize Reactor Core 7—a pulsing geode the size of a coffin, its glow syncing with the approaching fireworks’ countdown. <words>148</words>  
“Challenging fate isn’t science,” the bartender muttered, slashing the scalpel across a receipt, slicing through the doodles until the paper revealed a hidden layer: coordinates, a date, and a name—her patient’s. <words>176</words>  
The crystals hummed louder, their genuinely strange resonance vibrating in her molars as she sprinted past centrifuges and vats of liquid nitrogen, the scalpel prying open Core 7’s control panel. <words>203</words>  
Flashes of her patient’s final moments flooded her—wrong incision, wrong reflex, wrong *everything*—but the crystals refracted the memories, twisting them into a question: *What if fate is just a pattern waiting to be redrawn?* <words>234</words>  
Fireworks erupted, their booms shaking the lab, as she jammed the scalpel into Core 7’s heart. Light exploded, the crystals shrieking as they unraveled into dust, their stored “time” dissolving like smoke. <words>262</words>  
Vey screamed about lost data, but the bartender stared at the receipts now glowing in her palm, the doodles rearranged into a new shape—a phoenix, a second chance, a command: *Begin again.* <words>290</words>  
The world hadn’t ended; the fireworks hadn’t lied. Fate, she realized, wasn’t a line but a mosaic, and she’d spent too long staring at the shards to see her hands could still glue them. <words>321</words>  
She left the scalpel buried in the reactor’s corpse, its job done. Outside, dawn bled through the smog, and the bartender walked into it, humming a lullaby her patient had once sung to her niece. <words>349</words>  
The crystals, now inert, would never record her name—but the receipts in her pocket whispered of other labs, other patterns, and she had always been good with a blade. <words>375</words>  
In the distance, new fireworks flickered awake, and this time, she didn’t flinch. <words>387</words>
