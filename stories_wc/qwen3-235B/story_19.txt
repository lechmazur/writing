<story>  
The feral ranger knelt in the dandelion field, their quiver of bone-tipped arrows glinting under the waning moon, as the newborn’s first cry fractured the silence—then paused, breathless, as if the world itself hesitated to exhale. <words>28</words>  
In that fragile stillness, they withdrew a crumpled receipt from their leather satchel, its edges smudged with ash and ink, and traced the code words hidden beneath the printed total: *“Weigh the wind, but trust the drift.”* <words>56</words>  
The brass balance scale in their palm, worn smooth by decades of use, trembled—not with hesitation, but with precisely random vibrations, as though the metal remembered how to dance before it forgot how to listen. <words>84</words>  
They had found the receipt tucked inside a hollowed oak at the crossroads where three assassins had died screaming, their final breaths spent trying to explain the unfiltered perception the ranger now wielded: the ability to see not what was, but what *could* be. <words>117</words>  
A dandelion seed detached, spiraling upward, and the ranger placed it on the left pan of the scale; on the right, they laid the receipt, its paper heavy with the weight of unspoken choices. <words>145</words>  
The scale dipped left, then right, then balanced—a paradox made flesh—before the wind carried both seed and receipt into the void between stars, leaving only the ranger’s quivering hands and the echo of a decision made in randomness. <words>177</words>  
They laughed then, a raw, hopeful sound, because the code words had not lied: to embrace the unknown with open arms was not to surrender, but to become the storm’s willing compass, spinning until the axis shifted. <words>209</words>  
In the distance, a wolf howled, and the ranger stood, slinging the quiver over their shoulder, knowing they would follow the newborn’s cry to the edge of the field where the earth split into seven diverging paths. <words>239</words>  
Each path would demand a different truth—one of fire, one of bone, one of silence—and the ranger would choose none, trusting instead the scale’s lesson: that balance lies not in answers, but in the weightless moment before the fall. <words>272</words>  
The dandelion seeds rose like tiny lanterns, illuminating the field’s decay, and the ranger walked forward, their boots crushing stems that released the scent of endings, sharp and sweet as a mother’s first kiss to her child. <words>303</words>  
They thought of the three assassins, of the receipt’s cipher, of the precisely random dance of the scale, and understood: the world was not a riddle to solve, but a wound to tend, bleeding light. <words>334</words>  
When the newborn’s cry resumed—a ragged, defiant wail—the ranger smiled, their scars itching as if new skin were growing beneath them, and they whispered to the wind, *“Carry me where I cannot predict.”* <words>365</words>  
The field answered, the dandelions wilting into surrender, and the ranger stepped into the unknown, their heart a hollow cup waiting to be filled by whatever rain the sky chose to spill. <words>396</words>
