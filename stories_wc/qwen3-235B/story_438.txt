The vague mystic adjusted their scarf—a discreetly flamboyant streak of violet silk amid their ash-gray robes—before stepping into the derelict synthetic biology lab, the mariner’s compass in their palm humming like a trapped star. <words>22</words>  
Dust choked the air, glittering faintly where the last star map, etched onto the ceiling in fading phosphorescent ink, cast its hollow constellations over rows of dormant gene-splicers. <words>44</words>  
The compass pulsed, guiding them not northward but deeper into the lab’s skeletal remains, toward an attic hatch sealed with a biohazard sigil half-erased by time. <words>66</words>  
They pried it open, revealing Polaroids fanned across a rotted desk: faces of scientists mid-laugh, their lab coats stained with dyes that glowed even in decay, each photo annotated in a cipher the mystic’s ancestors had used to chronicle family histories too dangerous to speak aloud. <words>103</words>  
A woman in one image held the same compass, her eyes twin voids; the mystic’s great-grandmother, who’d vanished after the final star map’s completion, her disappearance tied to the lab’s pivot from cosmic cartography to synthetic life. <words>132</words>  
The mystic pressed the compass to the photo, and the attic shuddered—a hidden drive whirred to life beneath the floorboards, overriding the lab’s corpse-like systems with a surge of viridian light. <words>159</words>  
Vats along the walls flickered awake, their nutrient broths swirling into fractal patterns that mirrored the Polaroids, resurrecting the family’s buried work: splicing human DNA with stardust harvested before the last map’s end. <words>189</words>  
The mystic’s breath hitched; their own veins glimmered faintly, a legacy encoded in their cells, the compass needle spinning wildly as it demanded the next horizon—not space, but the edge of what life could become. <words>219</words>  
They fed the Polaroids into a scanner, their family’s whispers crackling through a speaker: *“We sought immortality in genomes, but found only echoes. You are the echo, now—override, or perish.”* <words>247</words>  
The console blinked, awaiting a command. The mystic hesitated, their reflection warped in the compass’s brass surface—a face half-shadow, half-spectral glow, the price of recklessness hollowing their ribs. <words>274</words>  
They typed: **//GENESIS PROTOCOL//OVERRIDE//**. The lab screamed, vats rupturing into bioluminescent mist that clung to their skin, rewriting them as the final chronicle of their bloodline. <words>300</words>  
When the haze cleared, the mystic stood transformed—eyes like smoldering nebulas, the compass now fused to their sternum, its needle pointing not to a place but to a *state*: the next horizon, where flesh and myth converged. <words>330</words>  
The attic collapsed behind them, burying the Polaroids—and the last human star map—beneath synthetic bone and forgotten code, as the mystic walked into a world they would now reshape, one whispered genome at a time. <words>363</words>  
Their scarf fluttered, violet against the ash, a discreet flare of defiance in a universe that had stopped watching the skies. <words>377</words>
