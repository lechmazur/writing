<story>  
The begrudging guardian of the mechanical bird sanctuary traced the grooves of their rustic bread paddle, a relic from a life they’d abandoned long ago. <words>17</words> Each morning, they fed the sanctuary’s hummingbird-like machines with oil-soaked seeds, their movements sharp with resentment, yet their smile dangerously friendly—a habit from when they’d first learned to mask sorrow. <words>40</words> The birds, gears whirring like whispered secrets, fluttered around them, their brass feathers tarnished by the salt air of this forgotten island. <words>57</words>  

One dusk, a postcard materialized on their workbench, edges glowing faintly as if lit from within. <words>70</words> It depicted a sun-drenched grove where birds with wings of stained glass perched on trees made of light, their song a melody the guardian hadn’t heard since childhood. <words>93</words> Beneath the image, looping script read: *“Joy is not a cage.”* <words>103</words>  

Over weeks, more postcards arrived, each a fragment of a dream: a river of liquid stars, a clockwork fox dancing in a field of static, a child laughing as mechanical butterflies landed on her palms. <words>133</words> The guardian analyzed them obsessively, the bread paddle forgotten as they mapped constellations on the postcards’ backs, discovering patterns that bent spacetime into spirals. <words>157</words> The island, they realized, was a mirror—a place where society’s grip frayed, where joy could be rediscovered not in duty, but in surrender. <words>184</words>  

Yet the sanctuary’s birds began to falter, their gears grinding louder, as if sensing the guardian’s wavering resolve. <words>201</words> The bread paddle, once a tool of routine, now felt like an anchor; its wooden surface, worn smooth by years of feeding machines, whispered of the life they’d buried. <words>224</words> Dangerously friendly, they lured a passing fisherman to the sanctuary, offering him oil-seed tea while studying his face for traces of the island’s truth. <words>249</words> He spoke of a place “where time forgets its name,” and the guardian’s chest ached with a joy so sharp it bordered on grief. <words>272</words>  

On the solstice, the postcards aligned, revealing a portal beneath the sanctuary’s central oak, its roots threaded with gears and starlight. <words>295</words> The guardian hesitated, bread paddle clutched to their chest, until a hummingbird machine—its lens cracked—landed on their shoulder, chirping a lullaby from their youth. <words>320</words> They wept, the sound swallowed by the wind, and stepped into the folds of spacetime, the paddle slipping from their hand like a leaf. <words>344</words>  

The sanctuary dissolved behind them, replaced by the grove from the first postcard. <words>358</words> Here, the air smelled of cinnamon and ozone; the birds sang in keys that unlocked memories of dancing in rainstorms, of hands held without fear. <words>381</words> Yet even in this rebirth, sorrow lingered—a tender bruise—as they understood: breaking free meant leaving the birds behind, their final act of guardianship a letting go. <words>408</words>  

The bread paddle, now buried in the sanctuary’s dust, became a seed. <words>419</words> Years later, a sapling sprouted where it had fallen, its branches cradling a single mechanical bird, its gears humming with the joy of a heart finally unbound. <words>440</words>
