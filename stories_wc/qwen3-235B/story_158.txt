Felix hummed a lullaby through chattering teeth, his breath frosting in the ice cavern’s marrow-chill, the quantum entanglement watch band on his wrist pulsing faint indigo—a color he’d come to associate with *almost* disasters. <words>44</words> He’d always believed the end would arrive in neon hues, screaming and radioactive, but the universe, it seemed, preferred subtlety: the slow bleed of oxygen from sealed bunkers, the silent collapse of ecosystems, the way his own optimism had calcified into something brittle and compulsive. <words>89</words>  

The watch band had been his first “unnecessary necessity”—a purchase justified by its ability to sync with parallel timelines, though Felix preferred to think of it as a *negotiation tool*. <words>122</words> Its subtext-analysis function, designed to decode hidden frequencies in emergency broadcasts, now parsed nursery rhymes instead. “Rock-a-bye, baby,” he muttered, adjusting dials etched with fractal patterns that hurt to look at. “Way too high…” The machine whirred, translating the lullaby’s subtext into a jagged graph: crimson peaks of impending collapse, ultraviolet whispers of supply-chain fractures, a sickly saffron smear he suspected meant “political unrest.” <words>178</words>  

He’d chosen the cavern for its stillness, its ability to muffle the world’s dying hum, but also for its irony—hoarding canned peaches and solar batteries in a place that mirrored the frozen heart of a dying planet. <words>213</words> His pack brimmed with redundancies: three Geiger counters, a seed vault, a foldable greenhouse. Yet here he sat, cross-legged on glacial silt, waiting for a device that measured quantum despair to tell him when to *begin*. <words>245</words>  

The watch band vibrated—a discordant F-sharp. Felix froze. On the graph, a new color erupted: a nauseating, iridescent shade he’d never seen before, not on the electromagnetic spectrum nor in his tupperware of emergency crayons. <words>277</words> *The unforeseen*, he thought, grinning despite the ache in his ribs. The machine spat out a timestamp: *the hush as a candle’s flame is pinched*. He knew that phrase. It wasn’t a time; it was a *threshold*. <words>310</words>  

He’d rehearsed this. With a politeness born of mania, Felix notified the void—his voice bright, his eyes fever-brighter—reciting coordinates, isotopes, the precise pH of his last batch of algae pancakes. <words>338</words> The watch band heated, its atoms trembling in sympathy with another self, another cavern perhaps, where he’d chosen different redundancies, different rhymes. *Create a new reality*, he’d written in his journal, the ink smudged by gloved fingers. *Or die insufficiently.* <words>374</words>  

When the light came, it was neither fast nor forgiving. It was the color of the unforeseen, and it moved like a sigh. Felix stood, arms outstretched, the lullaby now a chant, a shield, a bridge. <words>401</words> He thought of his mother’s voice, the real subtext of her bedtime songs: *I am here. I am here. I am here.* The watch band snapped against his wrist, a tether severing—or tightening. <words>427</words>  

In the hush, he wondered if sorrow could fracture like light, each shard holding a different version of survival. Then the color took him, and he stopped wondering. <words>449</words>
