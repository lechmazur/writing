<story>  
The vivid dreamer knelt beneath the gnarled apple tree, her fingers tracing the grooves of a pressed penny collection arranged like a map on the orchard floor. <words>17</words>  
Each coin, flattened decades ago at forgotten carnivals, now glinted with an eerie luminescence, aligning itself with the moon paths—silver trails that snaked between the trees, visible only to those who oscillated between waking and slumber. <words>44</words>  
She had followed these paths for years, rationally mischievous in her belief that they led to the heart of the cosmic deception her dreams had whispered about: that the orchard, policed by silent stone sentinels, was a prison for something—or someone—the universe had tried to forget. <words>77</words>  
The statues, their faces worn by centuries of frost and fury, never moved, yet their eyes tracked her every step, their patience unnerving. <words>94</words>  
She called it dour amusement, this dance of evasion and pursuit, as if the orchard itself were a jester with a blade hidden in its jest. <words>113</words>  
Tonight, though, the moon paths pulsed faster, urging her toward a clearing where a penny lay apart from the rest, its surface etched not with a carnival logo but with a single word: *Apology*. <words>139</words>  
She hesitated, recalling the dream: a voice, neither kind nor cruel, murmuring that the deception was not in the orchard’s purpose, but in her own role as its guardian. <words>163</words>  
Had she been the warden all along, tricked into believing she was a prisoner? The thought coiled around her ribs, tightening with each oscillation of the moonlight. <words>186</words>  
A statue stirred—a jagged crack splitting its marble cheek—as she reached for the penny. <words>199</words>  
“You’re late,” it said, its voice the grinding of tectonic plates, its lips curving into something that might have been amusement or rage. <words>221</words>  
The orchard held its breath. <words>228</words>  
She pocketed the penny, her hands steady, and met the statue’s gaze. <words>241</words>  
“I wasn’t ready to listen,” she replied, the words tasting of both surrender and defiance. <words>258</words>  
The deception unraveled then: the pressed pennies were not keys but apologies, each collected from the places she’d fled, each a promise to stay and guard what she’d once tried to destroy. <words>289</words>  
The statues, not jailers, were the imprisoned—bound by her ancestors’ guilt, their stone flesh a monument to a bargain broken. <words>311</words>  
The moon paths dimmed, their purpose fulfilled, as the orchard’s trees bent toward her in collective witness. <words>329</words>  
“You’ll find the work tedious,” the statue warned, its shoulders shrugging free of ivy. <words>345</words>  
“I’ve had practice,” she said, thinking of the dreams that had shaped her, the rationally mischievous way she’d always danced around truths too vast to name. <words>371</words>  
The first apology would be to the soil, to the roots that remembered when the orchard was whole. <words>389</words>  
The statue’s laughter followed her as she walked away, its sound a rumble of thunder promising rain. <words>404</words>  
She pressed the penny into the earth, her vow swallowed by the dark, and waited for the trees to decide if they believed her. <words>423</words>  
The threshold creaked open, just a sliver. <words>434</words>  
Enough. <words>440</words>
