<story>  
Eli adjusted their tool belt, the weight familiar against their hip as they stepped into the creaking elevator shaft of the Sandspire Building, a structure older than the city’s obsession with glass and steel. <words>20</words>  
The air hummed with the dissonance of silence—the absence of the usual groans from rusted cables, the void where the ghost usually wailed. <words>34</words>  
Eli was elegantly clumsy, all deliberate movements until they weren’t, like a marionette with one frayed string; they’d once dropped an entire toolkit down a shaft while reaching for a specter only they could see. <words>56</words>  
Today, though, the ghost clutched a dried flower crown, its petals brittle as parchment, and said nothing. <words>68</words>  
Eli had spent lunch breaks for weeks staking out local ghost tours, scribbling notes on apparitions’ habits, hoping to unravel why some lingered. <words>88</words>  
The tours never mentioned the Sandspire’s lab, a forgotten wing where engineers preserved sand castles in glass cases, their spires frozen mid-collapse. <words>107</words>  
The ghost drifted toward it now, the flower crown glowing faintly. <words>116</words>  
Eli followed, their boots crunching sand meant to mimic the shore, the lab’s sterile lights contrasting with the oceanic decay outside. <words>134</words>  
They’d dissected enough hauntings to know objects tethered spirits to the living world—a locket, a wedding ring—but this crown felt different. <words>155</words>  
The ghost mimed placing it on their head, then dissolved, leaving the crown in Eli’s hands. <words>167</words>  
Back in the elevator, Eli turned the crown, noticing initials carved into its stem: *L.M., 1923*. <words>180</words>  
Research revealed L.M. was a bride who’d drowned on her wedding day, her body found clutching flowers, her fiancé’s sand castle left to the tides. <words>201</words>  
The lab, Eli realized, was his attempt to preserve what grief couldn’t—her memory, the castle, the crown. <words>217</words>  
But ghosts needed release, not preservation. <words>224</words>  
At noon, Eli returned to the lab, the crown in hand, and placed it atop the fiancé’s sand castle replica. <words>240</words>  
The silence fractured—a sigh, then laughter, then nothing. <words>249</words>  
The ghost emerged, radiant and unburdened, and walked into the light pooling through the lab’s skylight. <words>264</words>  
Eli lingered, watching the sand castle crumble, its grains slipping into the cracks like time forgiving itself. <words>282</words>  
They left the elevator unrepaired, the dissonance replaced by a hum they could finally bear. <words>297</words>  
Letting go, Eli thought, wasn’t about erasure—it was about making space for the living to remember, and the dead to forget. <words>317</words>  
The next day, a new ghost appeared in the elevator, but Eli smiled, their clumsiness softening into grace. <words>334</words>  
They’d learned: some silences weren’t empty. <words>343</words>  
They were waiting. <words>350</words>
