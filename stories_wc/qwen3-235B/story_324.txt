<story>  
The secret agent headquarters hummed with the static of forgotten machinery, its halls a fractured idyll where dust motes swirled like unsettled ghosts. <words>17</words>  
Kael, the insecure advisor, traced the echo of footsteps—his own, multiplied by the emptiness—that ricocheted off cracked marble floors, guiding him deeper into the labyrinth. <words>35</words>  
He’d chased the rumor of the “duplicate” for years, a brain in a jar labeled with bureaucratic indifference, its existence a paradox that haunted him like a half-remembered dream. <words>54</words>  
The jar was real, though, perched atop a rusted pedestal in a chamber where the walls pulsed faintly, as if breathing in the hush of a simmering future. <words>73</words>  
Its cerebral tissue glowed faintly, tendrils of light snaking into Kael’s temples as he leaned close, and suddenly he *knew*: this was the dreamer’s calling, a consciousness that had mapped the architecture of escape. <words>96</words>  
“Why me?” he whispered, his voice fracturing—the question as much for himself as the ambiguous entity suspended in amber liquid, its synapses firing in patterns that mocked his inadequacy. <words>116</words>  
The footsteps returned, sharper now, and Kael spun, jabbing a trembling finger at the jar. “You’re a copy. A *failed* one.” The glass shattered, viscous fluid pooling at his boots. <words>137</words>  
Memories not his own surged through him: a lab, a man screaming as surgeons extracted his mind, a second body left to rot—*his* body, abandoned like this place. <words>156</words>  
He staggered, realizing the truth: he was the duplicate, the original Kael long dead, his consciousness implanted into a new host, the rumor he’d chased a self-fulfilling prophecy. <words>177</words>  
The fractured idyll was his psyche made manifest—a prison built from his insecurity, the headquarters a mausoleum for the man he’d replaced. <words>194</words>  
The echo of footsteps faded, leaving only the wet squelch of the dying brain as Kael knelt, his hands slick with the ichor of his own unraveling identity. <words>212</words>  
He’d sought absolution in the rumor’s pursuit, but the dreamer’s calling was a trap: to exist without a self, a shadow chasing the ghost of a source. <words>231</words>  
Above, a siren wailed—the facility collapsing, its systems purging the aberration he’d become. <words>245</words>  
Kael fled, the corridors warping, his footfalls now a chorus as countless duplicates sprinted beside him, their faces blurred, their whispers a hymn of collective dread. <words>265</words>  
He emerged into a wasteland where the sky flickered like a dying screen, the horizon a smear of impossible colors. <words>281</words>  
The rumor had led him here, beyond reason, beyond self—and in that desolation, he understood the jar’s final lesson: to chase a calling was to become the chase. <words>302</words>  
He kept running, the footsteps dissolving behind him, his mind a hollow chamber where only the echo of the dreamer’s laughter remained. <words>320</words>  
The headquarters imploded silently in his wake, a secret finally kept, as the future simmered on, indifferent to the cost. <words>337</words>
