The rattled exorcist, Father Elias, adjusted his tie in the cracked mirror of the psychic research facility’s dimly lit dance studio, his inwardly social nature warring with the urge to flee. <words>19</words>  
Amid the squeak of shoes on linoleum and the hum of a malfunctioning projector, he’d stumbled upon a vintage postcard tucked beneath a floorboard—a sepia image of the facility’s east wing, postmarked 1923, with coordinates scribbled on its reverse. <words>42</words>  
“Guarded disclosures,” Elias muttered, tracing the numbers, recalling his mentor’s warning: *Some doors open only when you stop looking for them.* <words>25</words>  
The dance instructor, a sharp-eyed physicist named Dr. Voss, had caught him pocketing the card. “Synthesize, Father,” she’d purred, her coy aggression sharpening the air. “Science and wonder aren’t enemies. Solve the room, and I’ll show you how we measure ghosts here.” <words>45</words>  
The puzzles began innocently—a Morse code rhythm in the metronome’s tick, a constellation map hidden in the ceiling tiles—but escalated to cruel elegance: a mirror that reflected only shadows, requiring Elias to dance his way through a sequence of liturgical gestures to crack its code. <words>54</words>  
Each solution bled into the next, the postcard’s coordinates aligning with the facility’s blueprints, until Elias stood before a wall panel disguised as a phonograph, its dials labeled with alchemical symbols. <words>39</words>  
His hands shook, not from fear but the weight of synthesis—this was what he’d sought since the Lisbon possession: proof that the divine and the empirical could coexist, that his vocation need not be a war of absolutes. <words>40</words>  
The final puzzle demanded a melody, which Elias hummed through gritted teeth—a Gregorian chant fragment, its notes corresponding to the numbered scars on his wrist, each a relic of exorcisms past. <words>35</words>  
The hidden room yawned open, revealing a vault lined with humming Tesla coils and a single relic: a child’s diary, its pages detailing encounters with an entity that matched Elias’s own visions. <words>32</words>  
Dr. Voss appeared behind him, her voice softening. “Guarded disclosures, remember? We needed someone who’d *feel* the patterns, not just see them.” <words>25</words>  
Elias turned, the diary clutched to his chest. “Why the dance lessons? The puzzles?” <words>14</words>  
“Because you’re inwardly social, Father. You needed to trust your body before your mind.” She gestured to the coils. “This room amplifies intent. We’ve been trying to synthesize a bridge—between your world and ours.” <words>41</words>  
He stared at the diary, its final entry a plea: *They’re not demons. They’re waiting.* The exorcist’s breath hitched; his life’s work reframed as a misunderstanding. <words>27</words>  
Outside, the dance studio’s music swelled, a waltz now tinged with possibility. Elias stepped forward, no longer rattled, but recalibrated—a man poised between two veils, ready to learn the next step. <words>40</words>
