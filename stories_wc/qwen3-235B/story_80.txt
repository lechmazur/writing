The daring pathfinder traced the antique doorknob’s rusted grooves, its brass surface etched with symbols matching the riddle’s final clue. <words>17</words>  
She’d found it buried beneath the collapsed ticket booth of the abandoned roller coaster track, where ivy choked the steel rails and whispers clung to the air like cobwebs. <words>37</words>  
The core concept gnawed at her: this was the last fragment, the key to unraveling the riddle older than time, which had lured scholars to madness and left the inn’s registers filled with nonsensical housekeeping logs. <words>65</words>  
Ingeniously clueless, she’d decoded the logs’ patterns by accident—pages blotted with ink, dates repeated thrice, entries for “cleaning phantom grease” from tracks that hadn’t operated in decades. <words>89</words>  
Her boots crunched on shattered glass as she climbed the coaster’s splintered support beams, the doorknob burning cold in her palm, its purpose as obscure as the logs’ maniacal scrawls. <words>114</words>  
Amid page turns of the inn’s ledger, she’d discovered coordinates hidden in tea-stained margins, leading her here, where the coaster’s first car dangled suspended over a dry ravine, frozen mid-scream. <words>142</words>  
The logs had eroded with time, their ink bleeding into riddles, but she’d pieced together their demand: *“Return the knob to where motion died, or the riddle’s throat will never unclench.”* <words>170</words>  
She laughed, sharp and quiet, a sound that matched the setting’s mania—how could a doorknob restart a corpse of steel? Yet her fingers obeyed instinct, pressing it into a rusted lock beneath the coaster’s decaying seat. <words>201</words>  
Gears groaned underground, a sound like the earth itself grinding its teeth, as the track shuddered and the ravine below split open, revealing a chamber lined with mirrors. <words>226</words>  
Each mirror reflected not her face, but fragments of the riddle: *“What flees the seeker yet guides them home?”* The answer clawed at her—*a door*, *a path*, *a lie*. <words>254</words>  
The doorknob vibrated, its symbols glowing, and she realized the logs’ true purpose: to misdirect. The answer wasn’t solved with logic, but surrender. <words>278</words>  
She let go. The knob dropped into the lock’s embrace, and the mirrors shattered, their shards spiraling upward to mend the coaster’s track in a cascade of silver light. <words>304</words>  
The ride lurched forward, pulling her into a tunnel beneath the earth, where walls pulsed with the same symbols as the doorknob, chanting the riddle’s answer in a language older than stone. <words>333</words>  
She understood now: the answer was *“the seeker’s shadow.”* The riddle had waited eons for someone to stop chasing it, to become the door rather than the key. <words>360</words>  
As the coaster screeched to a halt in a cavern of frozen stars, the tone shifted—quiet mania gave way to awe. The logs, the erosion, the fragment—all had been her, all along. <words>389</words>  
The pathfinder stepped out, the doorknob dissolving to dust. The riddle’s voice echoed, sated: *“Go. You are the last fragment now.”* Behind her, the track collapsed into eternity. <words>417</words>  
She walked on, ingenuously wise, the shadows at her heels humming a tune the housekeeping logs had once scribbled in vain. <words>434</words>
