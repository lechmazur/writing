<story>  
The baroque asteroid’s labyrinthine corridors glimmered under borrowed starlight, their gilded surfaces fractured by shadows that moved like living ink. <words>17</words>  
At the heart of its hollowed core, the lurking assassin adjusted a paint-splattered camera lens, its cracked glass framing the skeletal silhouette of a departing bus. <words>35</words>  
The machine hummed, capturing the final route of the driver whose death would mirror the unforgiving road itself—ruthless, inevitable, a path only one could walk. <words>54</words>  
Rain had fallen hours earlier, a synthetic mist condensing on the asteroid’s artificial atmosphere, weaving spider’s webs into jeweled traps that now glinted like coded messages. <words>73</words>  
The assassin traced the web’s pattern on a cracked viewport, mapping the bus’s trajectory through the asteroid’s ribcage of steel and forgotten prayer. <words>92</words>  
Motivation throbbed in their throat: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, though they knew dawn was just another word for absence. <words>110</words>  
When the bus groaned into the terminal’s skeletal embrace, the assassin laughed—a dry, superficially profound sound that echoed like a misfired synapse. <words>129</words>  
They descended via maintenance ladders slick with condensation, each rung a runic echo of the road’s unyielding arithmetic. <words>146</words>  
Passengers spilled out, faceless and fleeting, while the driver lingered, lighting a cigarette whose ember mimicked the trembling dawn. <words>163</words>  
The assassin’s blade, unsheathed, refracted starlight into prismatic lies, its edge honed to sever the thread between purpose and futility. <words>181</words>  
But as the driver exhaled smoke, they smiled—a cracked, baroque thing—and said, “You think this is the last stop, kid?” <words>199</words>  
The camera lens slipped, shattering at their feet into a mosaic of fractured routes and borrowed light. <words>215</words>  
Rain began again, distorting the webs into liquid hieroglyphs that spelled the road’s only truth: it forgave nothing, not even the hand that walked it. <words>234</words>  
The assassin hesitated, their trembling hands cradling not dawn but the weight of a thousand unspoken dawns, each one a mirror. <words>252</words>  
The driver’s laugh followed—a deeper, warmer sound—as he tossed his cigarette into a puddle, his bus dissolving into the asteroid’s exhale. <words>270</words>  
Left alone, the assassin knelt, gathering shards of lens and meaning, while the borrowed starlight dimmed to a bruised, unyielding gray. <words>288</words>  
They understood then: the road was not unforgiving because it demanded blood, but because it asked them to forget they’d ever wept. <words>307</words>  
Dawn bled through the viewport, trembling in their palms like a confession, as the last web unraveled into silence. <words>324</words>  
The asteroid spun on, baroque and unrepentant, while the assassin walked, their shadow merging with the road’s endless, superficially profound arithmetic. <words>343</words>  
Behind them, the camera’s corpse glimmered, a fractured eye still watching the pattern rain would never make. <words>360</words>
