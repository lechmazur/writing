The irate explorer slammed the witch’s ledger shut, sending a plume of dust spiraling through the dim study’s amber light. <words>12</words>  
“Your *fee* is absurd,” she snapped, her calloused fingers brushing the dragonfly-wing pendant at her throat—a relic her grandmother had pried from a warlock’s corpse. <words>25</words>  
The witch, a wraith of bone and smirk, leaned forward. “The pendant’s magic isn’t a *curative*,” she hissed. “It’s uniquely static. It doesn’t heal—it *listens*.” <words>40</words>  
The explorer barked a laugh, sharp as flint. “Listening won’t mend three generations of poison.” <words>48</words>  
But the witch’s clawed hand closed over hers, cold as a tomb, and guided her to the spellbook open on the desk—a child’s scrawl filling its margins. <words>60</words>  
“This,” the witch murmured, “is how you pacify the ghosts you cart around.” <words>67</words>  
Sardonic glee twisted the explorer’s mouth, but she knelt, pressing the pendant to the page, and let the rhythm of her heartbeat during meditation drown the room. <words>83</words>  
The study dissolved.  

She stood in her childhood bedroom, frozen mid-scream: the cracked window, the moth-eaten bear, the smear of her mother’s blood on the floorboards where she’d last seen her alive. <words>102</words>  
“*You* again,” a voice drawled behind her. Her mother—whole, smirking, clutching the same pendant. <words>111</words>  
“You died,” the explorer croaked.  
“*You* left,” her mother retorted. “Drama’s your birthright, isn’t it?” <words>122</words>  
The dialogue spiraled, generations clashing—accusations of abandonment, of weakness, of pride gnawing through their bloodline like termites. <words>135</words>  
But the pendant hummed, heartbeat-rhythmed, and the room’s edges softened. Her mother’s glare wavered. “You think I wanted this silence?” she whispered. <words>150</words>  
The explorer’s throat tightened. “You stayed *static*. I had to move.”  
“And I had to let you.”  

Back in the study, the witch cackled. “Well? Did it ‘listen’?” <words>164</words>  
The explorer touched her damp cheeks, the pendant now warm as living tissue. “It… heard enough.” <words>174</words>  
Three days later, she returned, hurling a satchel of gold onto the desk. “Teach me to mend what I’ve shattered.” <words>187</words>  
The witch raised a brow. “The pendant doesn’t heal, remember?”  
“No,” the explorer said, voice fraying. “But maybe listening’s a start.” <words>203</words>  
She meditated nightly, the heartbeat rhythm peeling back decades—the mother she’d vilified, the grandmother who’d stolen the pendant to save her, the daughter she’d abandoned in turn. <words>219</words>  
Generational dialogues, raw and recursive, etched new grooves in her bones. <words>227</words>  
When she finally opened her childhood door again, the room was quiet, the bloodstain gone. Her mother’s voice lingered, sardonic but tender: “Move, then. But don’t vanish.” <words>244</words>  
The explorer clasped the dragonfly-wing pendant—static, steadfast—and stepped into the dawn, her wounds scabbed but singing. <words>256</words>  
She’d never been good at stillness. But for once, the rhythm beneath her ribs felt less like a war drum, more like a lullaby. <words>269</words>
