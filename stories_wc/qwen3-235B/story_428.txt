The city planner turned doomsday prepper knelt beneath the cracked dome of the ancient Indian temple, his calloused fingers tracing the grooves of an antique ink blotter salvaged from a collapsed archive. <words>22</words>  
Above him, the constellations—shattered, misaligned—stretched across the ceiling’s celestial map, their broken patterns a riddle he’d spent years deciphering to escape the self-imposed chains of a world he’d once meticulously designed. <words>47</words>  
He’d abandoned blueprints of steel and glass to scavenge this forgotten sanctuary, where priests millennia ago had charted stars now lost to time, their wisdom eroded like the temple’s weathered sandstone. <words>70</words>  
The ink blotter, its felt surface stained brown with age, was no relic of worship; it was a tool to decode the constellations’ decay, each faded smudge aligning with fractured star clusters he’d studied in dead languages. <words>97</words>  
At the second a handshake sealed a hidden deal with a gaunt trader who’d brought him here—gold for secrets, breath for passage—the prepper felt the weight of his own doubt rise, a specter he’d long sought to banish with unyielding will. <words>127</words>  
He’d debased himself once, drafting evacuation routes for a government he knew would collapse, his authenticity eroded by complicity; now, survival demanded he become a cartographer of oblivion. <words>152</words>  
The trader’s palm, calloused and scarred, lingered in his grip as the temple groaned, its pillars trembling beneath the burden of whispered prophecies inked onto crumbling walls. <words>176</words>  
“You seek the exit,” the trader rasped, nodding at the blotter, its stains mirroring the constellation above—a serpent devouring its tail, the stars断裂 like a snapped necklace. <words>201</words>  
The prepper’s throat tightened; he’d rarely been authentic, even in his own mind, his preparations less about survival than fleeing the ruins of his own complicity in the systems he’d built. <words>226</words>  
But here, beneath the daring caution of a sky that refused to heal, he pressed the blotter to a stone engraving, the ink leaching into glyphs that pulsed faintly, revealing a tunnel spiraling downward. <words>251</words>  
The trader laughed, low and bitter, as the ground shuddered—a handshake’s worth of betrayal, a deal to bury the past in the bedrock of a world that had already ended. <words>275</words>  
The prepper descended, the tunnel’s walls humming with the echoes of forgotten hymns, his flashlight catching the glint of gold veins in the stone, the earth’s own constellations ruptured and raw. <words>301</words>  
He would not debased by regret again; the map in his pocket, drawn in starlight and ash, promised a vault where the last of the old world’s seeds lay dormant, waiting for his unyielding hands. <words>328</words>  
Above, the temple’s dome split open, the broken constellations spilling like ink into the night, while below, he smiled—a man unchained, forging a future from the ruins he’d dared to outlive. <words>355</words>
