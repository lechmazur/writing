<story>  
The underground poet slipped past the iron gate of the witch’s familiar menagerie, their boots crunching on gravel as they volunteered to clean cages where shadowfoxes curled around moth-winged serpents. <words>19</words>  
They had taken stints in odd places before—brewing ink from squidwives in coral towers, binding grimoires in a leviathan’s ribcage—but this, a menagerie humming with static magic, felt different. <words>44</words>  
The witch, a woman with hair like tangled copper wires, crocheted a blanket by lanternlight, each stitch crackling with displaced time; the poet watched, disinterested, as threads became maps, then dissolved. <words>70</words>  
One evening, while scrubbing algae from a viperfish tank, they found an antique map tucked beneath a stone, its parchment frayed by a tear that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>97</words>  
The tear, they realized, was statically unique—a fixed rift in the world’s fabric, unhealing, unchanging, unlike any other fracture they’d seen in their wanderings. <words>122</words>  
The witch never mentioned the map, but her crocheting accelerated, loops tightening into constellations as the poet traced the tear’s edge, discovering coordinates for a place called the Brimming Cup. <words>150</words>  
It was a concept, not a location: a valley where fate pooled, overflowing its banks, waiting for someone bold enough to seize it. <words>167</words>  
The poet’s motivation had always been elusive—a hunger to surprise fate with an unplanned encore, to scribble verses in margins the universe had tried to erase. <words>193</words>  
They waited until the witch’s blanket neared completion, its threads humming with finality, then slipped into the night with the map clutched like a compass. <words>218</words>  
The tear guided them to a hollow where time pooled, a cup-shaped depression brimming with half-written possibilities. <words>235</words>  
Here, the poet knelt, hands trembling not with fear but a disinterested passion—the cold fire of someone who’d never sought glory, only truth’s raw shape. <words>261</words>  
They seized the Cup’s rim, and the world shuddered; the witch’s blanket unraveled behind them, its threads snapping like taut violin strings as fate’s script rewrote itself. <words>288</words>  
When they returned, the menagerie was silent, the witch gone, her crocheting abandoned mid-stitch. <words>303</words>  
The poet spread the map on her empty worktable, its tear now sealed, the Brimming Cup’s echo fading into myth. <words>322</words>  
Volunteer stints in odd places had taught them that magic clung to margins, to those who moved unseen—underground, uncelebrated, uniquely static in their resolve. <words>348</words>  
They wrote a poem on the map’s back, ink bleeding through parchment, and wondered if fate, surprised, would ever bother to draft an encore. <words>373</words>  
The shadowfoxes watched, their eyes twin embers, as the poet folded the map small enough to swallow—a seed for the next unraveling. <words>397</words>  
Somewhere, a blanket’s loose thread tugged itself into place, and the world, brimming, held its breath. <words>413</words>
