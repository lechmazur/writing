The soul-broker real estate agent stood on the floating tea platform, its lacquered wood creaking as if whispering secrets of past negotiations, his polished shoes planted firmly on its weirdly static surface despite the currents of recycled air swirling beneath. <words>44</words>  
He held a dusty wine bottle, its label blurred by time, and rotated it slowly, tracing the reversed script with a gloved finger—his method, honed through decades of brokering deals between the living and the lingering dead. <words>77</words>  
“The art of persuasion,” he murmured, not to the empty platform but to the bottle itself, as though its silence were a client’s skepticism he could unravel into agreement. <words>107</words>  
His motivation was neither gold nor property deeds but the forgotten songs etched into the glass’s memory, melodies that could soothe restless souls into signing their tenancies over to eternity. <words>140</words>  
Tonight’s choreography required precision: a tilt of the bottle to catch the moon’s reflection, a twist to align its spine with the platform’s hidden gears, which hummed faintly as they recycled the tea leaves below into fuel for the afterlife’s bureaucracy. <words>183</words>  
The label’s reversed text flickered into focus—a lullaby from a drowned civilization—and the agent hummed its inverse, his voice a low, resonant thread stitching the air to the water beneath. <words>220</words>  
A spectral figure materialized at the platform’s edge, its form wavering like steam; the soul had been trapped here for centuries, refusing relocation until someone could prove they remembered its name, its story, its song. <words>259</words>  
He bowed, grandiose in his modesty, and offered the bottle—a contract sealed in dust and melody—knowing the soul would recognize the tune as its own forgotten elegy. <words>295</words>  
The platform shuddered, not from motion but from the weight of the soul’s sigh as it stepped forward, fingertips brushing the glass, its edges softening like ink dissolving in rain. <words>329</words>  
“Persuasion,” he repeated, “is listening harder than the other side breathes.” The soul vanished, leaving a key of ice that melted into the tea leaves, marking the deal’s completion. <words>363</words>  
Above, the sky shifted hues, recycling dawn into dusk in a seamless loop, while the agent pocketed the bottle—its label now blank, its song spent—and waited for the next client to rise from the waves. <words>400</words>  
He would be here, static and patient, until every forgotten note found its broker, until every soul’s final lease was signed in the ink of release. <words>437</words>  
The platform floated on, a tiny, stubborn monument to transactions unseen, its purpose as quiet and vast as the space between stars. <words>472</words>  
And if the world called him strange—a man bargaining with ghosts over terroir and time—he would smile, tip his hat, and spin another bottle to catch the light just so. <words>511</words>
