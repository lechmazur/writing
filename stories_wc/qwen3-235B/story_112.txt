<story>  
The aimless traveler traced the faded floral handkerchief’s embroidered violets with a thumb, its frayed edges whispering of grandmothers’ hands and recipes lost to ash. <words>17</words>  
She’d wandered into the writing system archive on a whim, drawn by the scent of parchment and the ghost of purpose. <words>25</words>  
The archive’s vaulted ceilings loomed like a cathedral of forgotten tongues, its shelves crammed with brittle scrolls detailing languages no living mouth could shape. <words>40</words>  
But it was the hopscotch board scrawled in chalk on the marble floor—a child’s relic, dust-gilded—that arrested her. <words>50</words>  
She crouched, noting how the grid’s asymmetrical cracks mirrored the handkerchief’s floral spirals, a cipher only the factually imaginative could unravel. <words>64</words>  
Her mentor’s words surfaced: *Seeds of vigilance grow where memory is starved.* She’d hated that proverb then; now, it hummed like a key. <words>80</words>  
The traveler grilled the air itself, interrogating the silence between the hopscotch’s numbers, the way shadows pooled in its grooves like ink. <words>94</words>  
A pattern emerged—a sequence matching the order of ingredients in her grandmother’s stew, whispered to her decades ago beneath a dying fire. <words>110</words>  
*To preserve indigenous recipes*, she’d scribbled in her journal that morning, a vow born of guilt for forgetting how to make the bread of her childhood. <words>126</words>  
The hopscotch grid led her to a drawer labeled *Extinct Lexicons*, where she found wax tablets etched with symbols resembling cooking verbs: *grind*, *knead*, *ferment*. <words>143</words>  
Her hands trembled, not from cold but the weight of the hush settling around her, as intimate and fleeting as a snowflake melting on warm skin. <words>159</words>  
She transcribed the symbols onto the handkerchief’s blank corners, stitching new life into its threads with each character, each spice measure resurrected. <words>176</words>  
When the archive’s curator found her, he scoffed—*Why salvage scraps?*—but she saw the ache behind his cynicism, a kinship in erasure. <words>192</words>  
She grilled him with questions until his resolve cracked, revealing a hidden alcove where oral histories had been etched into clay, awaiting someone to listen. <words>210</words>  
By dusk, she’d cataloged seven recipes, their verbs and nouns blooming like wildflowers in the cracks of her mind. <words>224</words>  
Yet triumph curdled in her throat; for every preserved syllable, a memory slipped—a face, a voice, the exact shade of saffron her aunt once used. <words>240</words>  
The traveler left the handkerchief in the archive’s heart, its violets now intertwined with hopscotch runes, a testament to what vigilance could salvage from oblivion. <words>258</words>  
As she stepped into the snow-blanketed night, she tasted the stew she’d reconstructed, its spices sharp with mourning and hope—a flavor her people might yet reclaim. <words>276</words>  
She walked on, no longer aimless, the archive’s silence a drumbeat in her ears, the snowflakes melting like secrets she’d sworn to keep. <words>293</words>
