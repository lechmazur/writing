<story>  
The bleary-eyed physician stirred his cold coffee, its dregs forming a constellation in the cup’s bottom—a language he’d learned to parse between sleepless nights at the digital nomad camp, where Wi-Fi signals flickered like dying stars. <words>21</words>  
His hands trembled, not from fatigue but the memory of the sunken pirate’s cutlass he’d pried from the temple’s flooded chamber weeks prior, its blade etched with glyphs that hummed with a resonance he couldn’t yet decipher. <words>44</words>  
The camp’s solar-powered lanterns cast jittery shadows across his tent as he spilled the coffee grounds onto a map of the archipelago, their patterns coalescing into a spiral that mirrored the inscriptions on the cutlass. <words>69</words>  
Revisiting unfinished tales was his curse; he’d abandoned the temple excavation after a colleague’s disappearance, but the glyphs had seeped into his dreams, their quiet drama a siren call he couldn’t outrun. <words>94</words>  
Now, the grounds whispered urgency—a scramble to the cliffside ruins before the horizon’s edge swallowed the last sliver of daylight, when the temple’s mechanisms, tied to celestial alignments, would seal forever. <words>120</words>  
He packed the cutlass, its weight a grim counterpoint to his laptop, and navigated the camp’s maze of hammocks and charging cables, avoiding the prying questions of nomads who mistook his quest for madness. <words>147</words>  
The scramble down the volcanic path was a blur of loose stone and adrenaline, the air thickening with the metallic tang of an impending storm—or something older, something that thrummed in the glyphs’ silent chorus. <words>173</words>  
At the temple’s mouth, he traced the inscriptions with the flat of the cutlass blade, the patterns in his coffee now vividly alive in the carvings: a key nested within a riddle, a riddle nested within a warning. <words>201</words>  
The physician’s breath hitched as the glyphs flared aquamarine, their light pooling like spilled ink, revealing a chamber below—a vault where his colleague had likely perished, her notes scattered beside a skeleton draped in barnacles. <words>228</words>  
He’d come to decode the temple’s purpose, but the cutlass’s hum sharpened into a dirge, the storm breaking overhead as the ground shuddered, the unfinished tale demanding its due in dire enchantment and blood. <words>254</words>  
Above, the horizon’s hush deepened, the last light guttering as he pressed the blade into the lock, the coffee-ground spiral now a compass in his mind, guiding him through the labyrinth’s collapsing heart. <words>281</words>  
The physician emerged at dawn, salt-crusted and hollow-eyed, the inscriptions finally parsed: the temple was a prison for a sea god, the cutlass its failing seal. His colleague’s fate was a prologue. The tale, unfinished no longer. <words>309</words>  
Back at camp, he brewed fresh coffee, its grounds spelling only silence—a reprieve, not an ending. The horizon’s edge glowed, and he wondered what other relics waited, whispering in the language of scars. <words>335</words>
