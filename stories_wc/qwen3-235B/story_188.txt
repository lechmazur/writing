<story>  
The former lawman adjusted his vintage spectacles, their cracked left lens blurring the horizon where the ancient Japanese castle loomed like a skeletal hand clutching the mist. <words>17</words>  
He’d fled to this ruin during seed planting season, hoping the earth’s quiet rituals might bury his past—a cycle of violence etched into his bones from decades of gunfights and broken promises. <words>35</words>  
But the past had a way of stirring, relentless as the wind that gnawed through the castle’s hollow corridors. <words>44</words>  
It arrived that morning as a misplaced letter, its ink smudged but urgent: *“The shards must reunite. The shrine beneath the koi pond—before the moon wilts.”* <words>62</words>  
The address was wrong, yet the message clung to him, improbable as the spectacles he refused to discard—relics from his first wife, whose hands had once pressed them into his own, whispering, *“See better, love.”* <words>83</words>  
Beneath the pond, he found a stone cairn, its surface carved with spirals echoing the cracks in his lenses. <words>94</words>  
Inside lay fragments of jade and bone: a shattered *okimono*, a guardian spirit whose scattered pieces hummed with a corroded rapture, both mournful and exquisite. <words>113</words>  
He’d heard tales—a warlord’s obsession, a curse born of greed—but the shards’ whispers were clearer than history. <words>125</words>  
They spoke of reunification, of a violence that could end only if the whole was made visible. <words>135</words>  
He stirred the fragments with his calloused fingers, half-expecting blood to bloom in the water like ink. <words>145</words>  
Instead, the spectacles’ crack split wider, revealing a hidden compartment—a map etched onto the jade’s underside, leading to a mountain shrine where the final shard awaited. <words>164</words>  
The journey demanded three days, each night spent planting seeds in fallow soil, a habit he couldn’t unlearn. <words>176</words>  
At the shrine, he faced a yakuza heir whose father he’d killed years prior, the boy’s rage a mirror of his own. <words>190</words>  
“Funny,” the youth spat, clutching the last shard, “how the world shrinks when you’re chasing broken things.” <words>205</words>  
The lawman didn’t draw his revolver. <words>210</words>  
Instead, he offered the vintage spectacles, their lenses catching the dawn’s fractured light. <words>219</words>  
“They showed me the path,” he said, voice raw. <words>226</words>  
The heir hesitated, then placed the shard into his palm—a gesture as improbable as forgiveness. <words>236</words>  
Reassembled, the *okimono* exhaled a sigh that shook the shrine, its glow dissolving the shadows coiled around both men. <words>249</words>  
Back at the castle, the former lawman buried the relic beneath the koi pond, its work done. <words>259</words>  
He kept the cracked spectacles, though, their flaws now a map of his own mending. <words>269</words>  
When seed planting ended, he stayed, tending the soil where the shards had slept. <words>278</words>  
The earth, he learned, preferred slow miracles—roots knitting the world anew, one improbable breath at a time. <words>293</words>
