<story>  
The underground city of the goblins hummed with the clatter of tiny feet and the distant echo of playground sounds, a cacophony of innocence beneath the earth. <words>17</words>  
Elias, the meek necromancer, hunched in a moss-crumbled alcove, clutching a fountain pen with a broken nib, its fractured tip smearing ink like blood across his trembling fingers. <words>35</words>  
He had come to decode the tangled tapestry—a relic woven with threads of starlight and shadow, suspended in the goblin king’s throne room, said to hold a universal riddle that could mend the fractures of his own hollow soul. <words>65</words>  
Peculiarly sincere, Elias had bargained with goblin children for directions, offering them trinkets carved from tombstone shards, his voice soft as cobwebs yet earnest enough to earn their trust. <words>89</words>  
The pen, once his mentor’s, had been meant for inscribing spells to unravel the tapestry’s secrets, but its broken nib rendered it useless—unless he could regain its purpose through ingenuity, not force. <words>117</words>  
Amid the playground sounds drifting through the subterranean air, he knelt by a pool of still water, where dewdrops clung to fungal stalks, and studied how light fractured through their curves, remembering an old text: *Truth bends where the small and sacred meet*. <words>150</words>  
With a breath, he held a dewdrop to the faint luminescence of the goblin city’s bioluminescent lichen, and the light refracted into a spectrum that danced across the tapestry’s threads, revealing glyphs invisible to the naked eye. <words>183</words>  
The riddle was not written but woven—a question of balance, of life and decay, posed by an ancient intelligence that saw the universe as both loom and loom’s shadow. <words>207</words>  
Elias’s hands steadied as he used the dewdrop’s reflection to guide his broken pen, the fractured nib now a tool to trace the answer in the margin of the tapestry’s fabric, where dewlight and ink became one. <words>237</words>  
The tapestry shuddered, threads untangling into a single luminous thread that coiled around his wrist, whispering of regeneration, of how endings feed beginnings—a truth his necromancy had always hinted at but never embraced. <words>267</words>  
Regaining his footing, Elias felt the weight of his sincerity transform, no longer a weakness but a bridge between worlds, as goblin children gathered, their laughter now a chorus of approval. <words>293</words>  
He left the underground city not as a master of death, but as a student of its quiet reciprocity, the broken pen tucked safely away—a relic of the old way, and a promise to mend what he once thought irreparable. <words>323</words>  
Aboveground, dawn bled gold across the horizon, and Elias walked toward it, the universal riddle’s answer thrumming in his veins: to heal the tapestry, one must first unravel the fear of becoming part of its weave. <words>353</words>
