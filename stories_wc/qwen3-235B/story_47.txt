The dutiful ward adjusted the worn leather glove on their left hand, its cracked seams a map of every locked door they’d ever opened—and every secret they’d kept buried. <words>17</words>  
Soundless sanctuary though it was, the audition halls thrummed with the weight of unspoken desperation: singers, dancers, fools, all clawing for a spot in the Veil’s final performance, a ritual older than memory. <words>40</words>  
The ward’s job was simple: observe, record, reject. Yet the glove itched, as it had since dawn, when a stolen phone materialized in the votive drawer, its screen blinking with a cryptic voicemail. <words>64</words>  
“Solve it,” the voice hissed, metallic and giddy, “or the next laugh’s yours.” The ward snorted—a graceless beauty in a place of artifice—then pocketed the phone, eager to dismiss the jaded thrill crawling up their spine. <words>92</words>  
By dusk, three more phones appeared, each with a new voice, each note a riddle tangled in static: *“The third step cracks the throat of the silent singer…”* The ward traced the words to the sanctuary’s forbidden west wing. <words>120</words>  
There, beneath a fresco of the Veil’s first performers—hanged for witchcraft, or so the stories claimed—they found a matching leather glove, right-handed, paired with theirs. <words>145</words>  
The phones buzzed in unison, spitting a final clue: *“Mortality’s punchline is the punch itself.”* The ward laughed, sharp and unwilling, as the floor gave way, dropping them into the ossuary below. <words>173</words>  
Bones lined the chamber, each tagged with faded audition numbers. The Veil’s “final performance” wasn’t art—it was execution, a centuries-long purge of those deemed unworthy. <words>199</words>  
The glove warmed, alive with the whispers of past wards, all who’d solved the riddles and chosen silence. But the ward, eagerly jaded, refused the inheritance. <words>224</words>  
They smashed the phones, their fragments sparking, and dragged the fresco’s rope noose into the audition hall, where the judges gaped, their faces ashen beneath gilded masks. <words>250</words>  
“Your turn,” the ward said, tossing the noose over the grandmaster’s throne. The riddles had reframed the familiar: the sanctuary wasn’t sacred—it was a gallows. <words>277</words>  
Chaos erupted, but the ward only tightened the glove, feeling the dead grip of its twin in the ossuary. They laughed, a raw, fearless thing, as the first judge choked on the rope’s recoil. <words>305</words>  
The auditions ended in screams, the sanctuary’s silence shattered. Yet in the wreckage, the ward kept laughing, their voice cracking—a graceless beauty, a punchline hurled at the grave. <words>333</words>  
When the last judge fell, the glove crumbled to dust. The ward stepped outside, breathing air that no longer felt like a cage, and wondered what art might be, unchained from death. <words>361</words>  
They’d never know. But the laugh lingered, a final note in a sanctuary that would never again swallow its singers whole. <words>385</words>
