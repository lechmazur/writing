<story>  
The mournful troubadour tightened the embroidered collar of his moth-eaten coat, its threadbare violets and silver moons a relic of a sister he’d buried beneath a foreign sky, and stepped into the echo chamber testing site—a cavern of glass and silence where sound went to die. <words>44</words>  
Amid silent struggles, he traced star trails etched into the chamber’s vaulted ceiling, their patterns oddly predictable, as though the cosmos itself had sketched a map for fools seeking absolution. <words>70</words>  
He was here to demystify the legend of the “heartbeat of nothingness,” a pulse rumored to thrum beneath the static, a rhythm his sister had once claimed could unravel the knots of any grieving soul. <words>101</words>  
Her letters, postmarked from this very site, had obsessed over the trails and their alignment with the collar’s stitching—a cipher he’d never decoded until now, when the stars above and the threads below converged in a single, undeniable truth. <words>137</words>  
The troubadour knelt, pressing his ear to the glass floor, and let the chamber’s void swallow his breath; the silence here was not empty but hungry, a living negation that gnawed at memory. <words>169</words>  
Suddenly, a vibration—a heartbeat, arrhythmic and cold—thrummed against his ribs, and the walls shivered with echoes of his sister’s voice, fractured by static: *“The collar… the stars… they’re the same.”* <words>203</words>  
He clawed at the embroidered collar, unraveling a hidden stitch to find a sliver of mirrored glass sewn within, its surface reflecting star trails he now recognized as the scars of a supernova, charted centuries ago to mark a burial ground for lost voices. <words>241</words>  
The revelation felt less like discovery than confession: the heartbeat was not nothingness but the reverberation of choices carved into the universe long before his grief took shape. <words>273</words>  
By following the trails, he’d circled back to the inevitability of her death, the collar’s embroidery a dirge woven into his skin, the chamber a mirror that demanded he sing the elegy he’d evaded for years. <words>307</words>  
His voice, cracked and resonant, spilled into the glass, harmonizing with the heartbeat until the walls fractured into light, and for a breath, he stood in the glow of her final moment—alive, then not, then forever a note in his song. <words>344</words>  
When the echoes faded, the troubadour left the collar in the dust, its purpose spent, and walked into the dawn, the star trails above already shifting to guide another soul toward the ache of clarity. <words>379</words>  
The chamber remained, a monument to confrontations, its silence now slightly warmer, as though the nothingness had learned to hum back. <words>401</words>
