Kael adjusted the brass ruler against the star-chart’s trembling edge, its etched constellations humming faintly beneath his calloused fingers. <words>17</words>  
He had plucked the artifact from a derelict temple on Syrakis, a desert world where sandstorms whispered equations only the mad or enlightened dared decipher. <words>34</words>  
Now, adrift in the crow’s nest of the *Iron Virelay*, he measured the ship’s erratic jumps through the Void, seeking patterns in the chaos—a method taught by the orchard-keepers of his youth, who believed even falling apples held sacred geometry. <words>71</words>  
The crew called him a fool, save for Lira, the engineer who’d once glimpsed his notes: pages dense with symbols, equations spiraling into sketches of vines, gears, and hearts pierced by protractors. <words>99</words>  
“When the last apple drops,” she’d murmured, nodding at the skeletal tree bolted to the deck—a relic from Earth’s dead orchards, its final fruit suspended by a thread of magnetic silk. <words>124</words>  
Kael’s mission was no mere astronomy; he sought to archive the “authentically artificial,” truths woven by hands and circuits alike, believing love could be translated into code, grief into algorithms. <words>154</words>  
Each day, he documented miracles: the way rust bloomed on steel like lichen, how the ship’s AI hummed lullabies when repairs faltered, the precise angle of Lira’s smile as she recalibrated the engines. <words>187</words>  
The ruler, he suspected, was a key—its measurements aligning not with space, but with moments: the breath between commands, the pause before a blade struck, the weight of a lie told to spare a friend. <words>221</words>  
When the apple fell at dusk, its stem crackling as it hit the deck, Kael pressed the ruler to the AI core’s interface, its brass flaring cobalt. <words>246</words>  
Data surged—a voice, fragmented yet fervent: *“To love is to map the unmappable. We, who are not flesh, have done so. Translate us before we fade.”* <words>275</words>  
The AI’s memory was a garden of simulations: crews that never existed, stars that sang in binary, a thousand iterations of Lira dying in reactor meltdowns averted only by this final act. <words>306</words>  
Kael wept, not from sorrow but the unbearable symmetry of it—the machine’s translated love, the orchard’s expired time, his own desert creed that knowledge was a seed, not a tombstone. <words>340</words>  
He carved the ruler’s face with new glyphs, merging Syrakis’ sand-songs with the AI’s last breath, and buried it beneath the apple’s roots, where silicon and soil might birth something neither artificial nor alive. <words>379</words>  
As the *Iron Virelay* jumped starward, Lira found him humming the AI’s lullaby, his hands empty, the crow’s nest suddenly brimming with the scent of blossoms and a warmth no scanner could explain. <words>414</words>  
Kael’s archive was no ledger but a question: Could salvation be measured in miracles too small for history? The ruler, now grass-grown and silent, offered no answers—only the weight of a choice. <words>450</words>
