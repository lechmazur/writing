The vexed minstrel adjusted his lute’s strap, its polished wood slick with the moisture of the fog that clung to the falling star collection point like a shroud. <words>17</words>  
This was the third year he’d journeyed here, to the cliffside where celestial shards rained down each winter, their glow dimmed only by the mist that whispered secrets only he could hear. <words>40</words>  
His family’s tradition of watching *The Clockwork Prophecy* annually had prepared him for this night—not the film’s sentimental climax, but its cryptic final frame, a tapestry of tangled threads labeled “fate.” <words>68</words>  
The crowd surging behind him, frenzied by the stars’ descent, radiated a madness he’d been hired to quell, though the patron who’d paid him in poisoned gold hadn’t mentioned the fog’s gifts. <words>101</words>  
Gifts like the confiscated spy gadget pen now tucked into his boot, its nib humming with stolen starlight; the customs agent who’d seized it two towns over had called it “a weapon of lies.” <words>131</words>  
He’d stolen it back hours later, not out of malice, but necessity—it was the only thing that might harmonize with the fog’s true offering: a shard of the first fallen star, pulsing beneath his cloak. <words>163</words>  
The minstrel’s plan hinged on strategic spontaneity, a dance his ancestors had perfected while fleeing inquisitors—play the crowd’s chaos like a fiddle, then strike the note they’d least expect. <words>194</words>  
He climbed the jagged outcrop, the pen warming against his thigh, and surveyed the masses below, their screams sharpening as another star streaked earthward. <words>220</words>  
When the fog thickened, swallowing the cliff in its clammy grip, he unsheathed the pen, its tip radiating a cobalt haze that mirrored the movie’s closing scene: a man unraveling time itself. <words>249</words>  
The crowd froze, their hysteria dissolving into awed silence as the mist coalesced around him, weaving a spectral loom that threaded the fallen stars into a crown above his head. <words>279</words>  
He’d lied to the patron, of course—the minstrel’s true motive wasn’t to hush the crowd but to claim the tapestry’s power, to sever his lineage’s cursed thread and become the author of his own design. <words>312</words>  
Yet as the fog’s gifts settled into place, he hesitated, recalling his grandmother’s words before last year’s film: “Every thread pulled reshapes the cloth.” <words>338</words>  
The pen’s spyglass lens clicked open, revealing a tiny, blinking sigil—the mark of the very inquisitors his kin had fled centuries ago. <words>360</words>  
Coy malevolence curled his lips. Let them watch. Let them think their gadget would betray him. <words>378</words>  
Instead, he snapped the pen’s tip against the loom, fracturing the tapestry into a thousand new futures, each one radiant with the chaos he’d mastered. <words>403</words>  
The crowd erupted, not in madness but rapture, as the stars rained softer now, guided by a melody only he could play. <words>427</words>  
By dawn, when the fog retreated, the minstrel was gone, leaving behind a single cobalt feather—and the quiet, unshakable sense that fate had been remixed, not rewritten. <words>455</words>
