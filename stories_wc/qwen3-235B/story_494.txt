The arrogant swordsman stood in the calligraphy master’s courtyard, his boots crunching on gravel as he surveyed the faded tapestry fragment nailed to the wooden post—a relic of his family’s lost glory. <words>22</words>  
Its threads, once vibrant with crimson and gold, now hung like brittle whispers, mocking his doubtfully confident smirk. <words>31</words>  
He had authorized this pilgrimage, this farce of a quest, to break the shackles of his stunted blade, though his hands trembled not from fear but the weight of a legacy sung in weddings long past. <words>52</words>  
The master emerged, silent as ink, and gestured to the tapestry: “Your ancestors wove power into cloth. Now you must unweave it—with the song.” <words>67</words>  
The swordsman scoffed, his voice sharp as steel. “A *song*? I carve destiny with this blade, not nursery rhymes.” <words>81</words>  
The master’s gaze softened, harsh in its tenderness. “Your arrogance blinds you. The song is the key. Sing, and the tapestry will answer. Fail, and your potential dies here.” <words>104</words>  
Between breaths, the swordsman hesitated, the silence stretching like a wound. <words>111</words>  
Memories flickered: his father’s drunken lament, the family’s fading crest, the hollow clang of his own defeats. <words>123</words>  
With a snarl, he tore the tapestry free, its fibers resisting like clasped hands. <words>131</words>  
“Not with force,” the master chided. “With *voice*.” <words>137</words>  
The swordsman’s throat burned as he began, the wedding melody sour and fractured. <words>145</words>  
But the tapestry shuddered. <words>149</words>  
Doubt clawed at him—until the fabric glowed, threads unraveling into light that coiled around his sword. <words>161</words>  
The master nodded. “Your family’s spark was never in the cloth. It was in the *singing*—the courage to blend strength with surrender.” <words>180</words>  
The swordsman faltered, then roared the final verse, the notes sharp as cleaving steel. <words>190</words>  
The tapestry dissolved, and his blade ignited, not with fire, but with a cold, piercing luminescence. <words>203</words>  
He understood now: his shackled potential had been his own refusal to wield both sword and song. <words>215</words>  
The master bowed. “Go. Deliver that light where darkness feasts.” <words>224</words>  
He turned, the courtyard fading behind him, his heart a drumbeat of harsh tenderness—a spark authorized, not by blood, but by the audacity to harmonize. <words>243</words>  
The swordsman rode into the night, the melody still trembling on his lips, a requiem and a lullaby. <words>256</words>  
Where all lights had gone out, he would be the first flame, forged between breaths, between ruin and rebirth. <words>271</words>  
His arrogance remained, but now it was a sheath for the fragile truth: confidence was not the absence of doubt, but the choice to act despite it. <words>293</words>  
The song lingered in the air, a thread stitching past to future, as the swordsman vanished into the horizon’s thinning dark. <words>308</words>
