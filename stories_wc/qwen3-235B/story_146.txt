The faux fortune teller, Liora, arrived in the city of Veymar to study the sacred development of its extinct language, her caravan wheels crunching over cobblestones slick with spring rain. <words>17</words>  
She had taken chances before—false tarot readings, staged séances—but here, amidst the archive’s crumbling glyphs, her real visions began: flickers of bone-white flutes and subterranean halls. <words>36</words>  
Veymar’s streets, labyrinthine and regular seldom in their design, swallowed her whole one dusk; she explored alleys choked with ivy until a crypt’s mouth yawned beneath a hollow church. <words>54</words>  
Inside, dust whispered of centuries. The bone flute rested on an altar, its surface etched with the same forgotten script that haunted her dreams. <words>69</words>  
When she touched it, a vision seized her: hands planting seeds in soil, then burning libraries, then a chorus of voices speaking the dead language in perfect unison. <words>88</words>  
The archive’s curator, a wisp of a man named Toren, had scoffed at her claims of sacred linguistics. “You’re a charlatan,” he’d said, yet followed her to the crypt all the same. <words>110</words>  
Liora played the flute—a hollow, reedy note—and the walls shivered, revealing chambers sealed since the planting season of the last kingdom. <words>126</words>  
Scrolls lined the hidden vaults, their ink still vivid. Toren’s hands trembled as he deciphered the extinct script, his cynicism wilting before the weight of proof. <words>145</words>  
Her visions came more frequently now, regular seldom bursts of clarity: a child learning the language, a king’s funeral hymn, the flute’s maker binding their soul to its marrow. <words>164</words>  
Anger simmered beneath Liora’s peace—the rage of a woman who’d sold smoke now tasked with a fire she couldn’t control. The city’s elders had buried this truth; she would unearth it. <words>184</words>  
Through planting and harvest, she and Toren transcribed the glyphs, their work a bridge between then and now. The language was a liturgy of growth, each word a parable of decay and renewal. <words>205</words>  
When Toren asked why she’d really come, she lied: “For the same reason as you.” The truth was darker—a hunger to wield what she’d pretended to possess for so long. <words>225</words>  
One night, the flute’s song cracked the archive’s foundation. A tree erupted from the crypt’s heart, roots cradling the scrolls, blossoms spelling glyphs in petals. <words>242</words>  
The city gathered, awed. Toren called it a miracle; Liora felt the earth’s patient anger, the weight of chances denied and now reclaimed. <words>258</words>  
She left Veymar as quietly as she’d come, the bone flute wrapped in cloth. The archive thrived without her, its sacred tongue blooming in throats young and old. <words>276</words>  
In her wake, a single phrase lingered on the wind, one she’d never learned but now understood: *To speak is to plant. To listen, to harvest.* <words>294</words>  
Liora walked on, her peace unbroken, her anger spent but not gone—a seed herself, carried to the next forgotten field. <words>308</words>
