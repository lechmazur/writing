The orchard had no name, only a reputation. Maren called it the Throat, because everything it swallowed stayed swallowed. [22]

She had not chosen to tend it. [29] Her grandmother had died mid-sentence, pointing at the gnarled rows of trees that grew sideways from the cliff face, their roots clutching limestone like arthritic fingers, and Maren had been foolish enough to follow the direction of that dead woman's hand. [62] Now the curse was hers: the trees fruited stones, the stones sang at dusk, and any traveler who wandered into the cliffside labyrinth below the orchard rarely wandered out. [90]

The labyrinth was not ancient. [95] It had been carved perhaps sixty years ago by someone who understood acoustics and cruelty in equal measure. [112] Channels in the rock amplified the wind into voices that sounded almost like guidance, pulling the lost deeper. [129] Mechanical birds patrolled its upper ledges, copper-winged things with glass eyes that reflected lamplight but produced none. [146] They had been built to watch, not to help. [155] Maren had tried dismantling one once and found its interior was hollow except for a single gear that spun without apparent power source, offhandedly exact in its rotations, as though precision were an afterthought it happened to achieve. [191]

She hated the place. [195] She stayed anyway, because people kept stumbling into the labyrinth, and she was the only one who knew the turns. [216]

Today a family had entered. [221] She had seen them from the orchard's edge at midmorning: a man, a woman, a child old enough to walk but young enough to trust the singing walls. [249] By afternoon their shouts had faded into the labyrinth's deeper channels where even Maren's knowledge grew uncertain. [267]

She knelt among the cursed trees and opened the leather case she kept beneath the largest trunk. [284] Inside lay her grandmother's forgotten blueprint, a schematic drawn on sheepskin so old it felt like dust held together by stubbornness. [303] The blueprint described something that had never been built: a network of resonance points throughout the labyrinth that, if activated, could override the false voices with true directions. [331] Her grandmother had understood the theory. [337] Maren understood the practice. [341]

She could not touch the walls directly. [348] The curse forbade it; her skin against the labyrinth stone would add her own voice to the chorus of misdirection, one more lie for the lost to follow. [376] Instead she worked by leaving impressions without touching, pressing shaped wooden forms against thin membranes of stretched hide that she pinned over the resonance points, transferring vibration patterns into the rock the way a stamp transfers ink. [413]

From the leather case she withdrew the components. [422] Forty-three pieces of oak and bone, each carved to a specific frequency profile. [434] She began to assemble the guide-frame, slotting the pieces together with the mechanical focus of someone who had done this seven times before and resented every occasion. [462] The frame looked like a skeletal hand holding a funnel. [472] Graceless, ugly, functional in the way that desperation makes things functional. [482]

The last piece was a small nut, iron-threaded, that locked the funnel's throat tight enough to shape the output tone. [502] She threaded it with her teeth because her fingers were shaking from cold. [515] The frost would come tonight. [520] It always came suddenly on the cliffs, and when it did, the labyrinth's stone contracted and the resonance points sealed shut until spring. [543] She had hours, maybe less. [548]

Maren descended the iron ladder bolted to the cliff face, the guide-frame strapped to her back, mechanical birds tracking her with their useless glass eyes. [573] She found the first resonance point by memory, pinned the membrane, pressed the frame against it, and felt the stone accept the vibration. [596] A low hum replaced the wind's false whisper. [604]

She moved to the second point, then the third. [613] At the seventh she heard the child crying, close now, maybe two turns away. [627] At the ninth the man's voice called out, following the new tones, the true ones. [642]

By the eleventh point her arms were shaking and the air tasted of coming ice. [657] The blueprint called for fourteen points to complete the network. [667] She managed twelve before the frost crept across the stone like white fingers closing. [680] The thirteenth membrane froze before she could press the frame against it. [692]

Twelve would have to be enough. [698]

She stood in the labyrinth's mouth and shouted the final directions herself, her own flawed voice doing what the blueprint could not finish. [722] The family emerged twenty minutes later, the child asleep on the man's shoulder, the woman gripping the wall with bleeding fingers. [742]

Maren led them up through the orchard, past the sideways trees with their stone fruit, into the graceless beauty of survival on a frozen cliff at dusk. [770] She did not introduce herself. [775] She never did. [778] She simply pointed them toward the valley road and turned back to her terrible, necessary trees. [793]

I need to trim slightly — let me recount. The story appears to be 793 words, which exceeds the 790 limit. Let me revise:
