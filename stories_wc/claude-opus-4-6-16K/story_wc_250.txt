The cobalt dock gleamed after rain, every plank slicked with a mirror-skin of reflected sky. [16] Water pooled in the grooves between boards, and the canal beyond lay flat and heavy, holding its breath the way water does when it knows someone is watching. [43]

She had no name that anyone remembered. [50] The bargemen called her the silent canal guardian, though she guarded nothing they could see — no gate, no lock, no mooring post of particular value. [73] She simply stood at the dock's edge each evening, her coat dark as wet stone, her hands folded around a single object she turned and turned between her fingers: a dental mirror, small and round, its angled head catching light from sources that should have been too dim to reflect. [116]

No one asked why she carried it. [123] No one asked much of anything, because her silence was not the silence of someone who refused to speak but of someone who listened so deeply that words seemed crude by comparison. [152] Spiralingly calm, her stillness radiated outward in concentric rings, the way a stone dropped into the canal would send ripples to both banks before the surface remembered how to be flat. [181]

Tonight the rain had stopped only minutes ago. [189] The air smelled of iron and wet wood. [197] Across the canal, the old warehouse shutters hung at various angles, some open, some half-closed, their slats catching the last bruised light of dusk. [221] She studied them the way a weaver studies a loom. [231]

Then she began. [234]

She crossed the footbridge and moved along the warehouse facade, adjusting each shutter with deliberate care — tilting one thirty degrees, closing another to a slit, opening a third wide so the darkness inside gaped like a mouth. [268] She was creating patterns with shutters, and from the dock across the water, the effect was unmistakable: a constellation. [287] Not copied from any chart, but invented, the way a child might invent a constellation and name it after a feeling rather than a god. [311]

She returned to the dock and stood where she had always stood. [323] She raised the dental mirror to her eye, angling it so she could see behind her, above her, the warehouse shutters reflected in miniature — her private sky, her proof that pattern could be woven from neglect and rot. [359]

This was how she meant to teach darkness the value of stars. [371] Not by flooding it with light but by placing small openings within it, carefully, so the darkness itself became the canvas and the light became punctuation — bright syllables in a sentence the night was still learning to speak. [406]

A boy appeared at the far end of the dock. [416] He was perhaps twelve, thin-armed, holding a lantern he had not yet lit. [429] He had been crying; the evidence was in the stiff way he held his jaw, the redness at the rims of his eyes. [452] He stopped when he saw her. [458]

She did not turn. [462] She did not wave him closer or shoo him away. [472] She simply adjusted the dental mirror so it caught a faint gleam from one of the shutter-slits and sent a coin of light sliding across the wet planks toward his feet. [502]

He looked down at the light. [508] He looked up at the shutters. [514] He looked at her. [518]

Within the edge of a half-spoken secret — that trembling instant when the mouth opens and the truth has not yet decided whether to emerge — something passed between them. [545] Not words. [547] Not even a gesture. [551] A recognition, quiet as water settling after a disturbance, that loneliness is a shutter and someone can choose how far to open it. [572]

She held the mirror steady. [577] The boy set his unlit lantern down and sat on the dock's edge, letting his feet hang above the black water. [597] The constellation she had woven into the warehouse wall reflected brokenly on the canal's surface, and for a long time neither of them moved, two figures held in stillwater tension, breathing the same iron-wet air, weaving silence into something that felt, against all logic, like company. [641]

The canal did not care. [646] The rain did not return. [651] Somewhere a barge knocked gently against its mooring, and the sound was absorbed into the larger quiet the way a single star is absorbed into the pattern of a sky — not lost, but placed. [686]

She lowered the mirror at last and slipped it into her coat. [698] The boy did not look up, but his shoulders had softened, and his breathing had matched itself to hers without his knowing. [720] That was enough. [723] That had always been enough. [728]

The dock held them both, cobalt and gleaming, while the darkness overhead learned, slowly, to value its stars. [747]
