In the mirror world, where light had forgotten its own name, Elara moved through the alchemical orchard greenhouse like a woman gathering pieces of herself from the floor. [30]

She was a memory keeper, though scattered was the kindest word for what she had become. [45] Memories slipped through her mind like water through a sieve—fragments of faces, half-spoken promises, the ghost-taste of fruit that no longer grew. [67] The orchard around her stood in endless night, its glass walls dark as closed eyes, its trees bearing fruit that glowed with faint bioluminescence: silver apples, copper pears, mercury plums that wept when touched. [97] The alchemical processes that once sustained this place had slowed to a whisper. [111] Sap moved like cold honey. [116] Roots curled inward. [119] The realm was dying, and Elara could feel it in her own thinning thoughts, because a memory keeper and her world were the same flesh. [143]

She stopped before the mica window at the greenhouse's eastern wall—the only window that still held any transparency. [162] Mica, layered and luminous, splitting light into its secret selves. [172] But there was no light to split. [179] Not anymore. [181] She pressed her palm against its surface and felt the cold of a sky that had swallowed every dawn for longer than she could remember. [205]

That was the cruelest part. [210] She could not remember when the dawns had stopped. [219]

But her hands remembered something her mind did not. [228] They moved to the loom she had dragged between the rows of sleeping trees—a loom strung with threads spun from the orchard's luminescent fruit pulp. [253] She had been weaving for what felt like years, though time in the mirror world moved like a river with no banks. [274] The fabric she produced was not cloth exactly but something closer to condensed twilight, each thread holding the frequency of a color the sky had once worn. [300] Woven dawns, she called them, though she did not know if she had invented the phrase or remembered it. [318]

Her fingers found the shuttle and began again, and as they moved, a sound rose from her throat—low, tuneless at first, then finding shape. [343] A forgotten song. [346] She did not know the words, only that her body knew them, that they lived in the same place as breathing and blinking. [369] The song was about morning. [374] About the way light first touches a field. [382] About neighbors stepping outside at the same hour, drawn by the same warmth, recognizing each other in the shared gold of a new day. [404]

The mica window trembled. [408]

Elara sang louder, weaving faster, and the fabric on the loom began to glow—not with the cold phosphorescence of the orchard fruit but with something warmer, something that pulsed like a heartbeat. [440] She remembered now: the songs were how the realm had been knit together in the first place. [456] Not by decree or architecture but through forgotten songs passed mouth to mouth, binding strangers into communities, making neighbors of the lonely. [474] The songs were the connective tissue, and when they were forgotten, the world began to unravel. [489]

She pulled the finished fabric from the loom—a shimmering panel of woven dawn, warm as skin—and carried it to the mica window. [512] With trembling hands, she began to swaddle the window in the cloth, wrapping it the way one wraps a newborn, careful and fierce, binding the light-fabric against the translucent mica so that every layer amplified the glow. [550]

The greenhouse shuddered. [553] A copper pear dropped from its branch and split open on the ground, releasing a scent so sweet and sharp that Elara gasped and remembered her mother's kitchen, her mother's voice, her mother singing the same song. [586]

Through the mica window, wrapped in woven dawn, light began to bleed outward into the endless night—not a sunrise exactly, but the promise of one, the bound release of something held too long in darkness. [620] The trees straightened. [623] Sap quickened. [625] Somewhere beyond the greenhouse walls, Elara heard a second voice join hers, then a third, rising from the scattered settlements of the mirror world like smoke finding sky. [652]

She wept and kept singing, her scattered memories knitting themselves back together with every note, because the songs were not just music—they were the realm's living memory, and to sing them was to rekindle every connection the darkness had severed. [693]

Dawn, woven and swaddled and sung into being, pressed against the mica window and reached outward, and the mirror world, for the first time in an age, began to remember what morning felt like. [726]

Elara's voice cracked and held. [731] The night thinned. [734] The orchard breathed. [737]
