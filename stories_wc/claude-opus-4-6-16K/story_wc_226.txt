The towers of bone rose from the canyon floor like the fingers of something buried and still dreaming. [18] Mist threaded between them, catching in the hollows of ancient vertebrae and the arches of fused ribcages that formed their walls. [37] Every sound here returned sevenfold, the canyon of endless echoes bending whispers into choruses, footsteps into percussion, silence into a hum that pressed against the teeth. [60]

Lira climbed the spiral staircase inside the tallest tower, her charcoal-stained fingers trailing along walls made of something that had once been alive. [82] She was a defiant artist, had always been one, even before the Synod declared her murals heretical, even before they burned the wall she had painted the truth upon. [109] The truth: that the Archpriest had ordered the drowning of the river settlements not to purify them, as the liturgy claimed, but to seize the mineral veins beneath their homes. [139] One truth, painted in pigment and bile, and they had sentenced her to the Ritual of Absolution for it. [157]

Forgiveness, they called it. [161] The ritual would strip the offense from the offender's soul, but it would also strip the memory that had caused the offense. [183] She would forget what she had seen, what she had painted, what she knew. [196] That was the price of forgiveness here: not penance, but amputation. [207]

She reached the top chamber before dawn, before the ritual, while the Synod's bone-priests still slept in their lower alcoves. [227] The pale spire in mist was visible through the oculus above, a needle of white bone piercing the fog, the place where absolution would be administered at noon. [255] She stared at it and felt the old defiance harden behind her sternum. [267]

They wanted one truth erased. [272] She would make that impossible. [277]

Lira had spent her imprisonment not in despair but in preparation, scribbling verses on scraps of her own clothing, testing them against the echoes. [298] She had discovered something innocently mischievous about this canyon: it did not merely repeat sound, it transformed it. [316] A word spoken plainly would return altered in pitch, in cadence, sometimes even in meaning, as if the bone towers themselves were interpreting. [336] The echoes could refract a single truth into many, splitting it the way a prism splits light, sending it outward in versions the Synod could never fully gather and silence. [365]

She began before the first priests stirred. [372]

Her method was impromptu poetry, composed and spoken aloud in rapid succession, each verse a facet of what she knew. [393] She did not recite from memory alone; she let the canyon's acoustics shape her phrasing, responding to each echo with a new line, a call and response between artist and architecture. [422]

"The river children sleep in silt," she said, and the echo returned: *silt, silt, guilt*. [437] She caught the word and spun it forward. [444] "The guilt is not mine to carry, Archpriest, but yours to drown in." [456] The canyon multiplied her voice, sent it cascading through every tower, every hollow chamber, every listening passage where acolytes and prisoners and pilgrims pressed their ears to bone walls. [482]

She spoke of the mineral veins, the forged orders, the families who had no graves. [496] Each poem was different, each one a refraction, and the echoes carried them further than any mural ever could. [515] A painting could be burned. [520] A wall could be torn down. [526] But sound, once released into a canyon that never stopped repeating, became permanent. [538]

By the time the bone-priests reached her chamber, the air itself was thick with her testimony. [553] The forged hush they had maintained for years was shattered, replaced by a new kind of silence: the silence of people listening. [574]

The head priest stood before her, his face a controlled mask. [585] "You understand this changes nothing about the ritual," he said. [595]

"It changes everything about the ritual," Lira replied. [603] "You can carve the memory from my mind. [610] But the canyon has it now. [616] Every pilgrim who walks through will hear some version of what happened. [628] You cannot absolve a canyon." [633]

He stared at her, and she saw the calculation behind his eyes, the dawning recognition that forgiveness enforced is not forgiveness at all, and that the price of it had just become higher than the Synod could pay. [668]

Lira sat down on the bone floor and waited for noon. [679] She was not afraid. [683] The pale spire emerged slowly from the mist above, and the echoes of her voice continued their long, recursive journey through the towers, refracting, multiplying, becoming something no single act of erasure could undo. [714]

She had made the truth immortal by making it plural. [724] And if they took her memory, the canyon would remember for her. [735]
