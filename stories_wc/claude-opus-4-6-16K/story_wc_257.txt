The observatory had no clocks because it had no need for them. [11] Perched on a granite ridge where the sky never fully darkened nor fully brightened, it existed in a perpetual dusk that made the stars visible alongside the sun, as though the universe could not decide what hour to grant this place. [50] Elara had come here after hitting rock bottom — after burying her daughter, after the shop went dark, after the last commission for a mourning brooch sat unfinished on her bench because her hands had simply stopped. [82]

She was a mourning jewelry maker by trade, a woman who transformed grief into garnet and jet, who set locks of hair behind crystal and twisted gold wire into forget-me-nots. [109] For twenty years she had held other people's sorrow in her palms and shaped it into something they could clasp around their wrists. [131] Then her own sorrow arrived, and she discovered she had no vessel for it. [145]

The observatory's caretaker, an old astronomer named Sable, had left the door unlocked with a note: "Stay as long as the sky needs you." [170] Elara did not know what that meant, but she stayed. [181]

She found the tattoo stencil on vellum her first night, tucked inside the eyepiece housing of the great refractor. [198] The design was intricate — a bloom unfurling from a skeletal hand, every petal veined with constellations she half-recognized. [215] Beneath it, in faded ink, someone had written: "To teach withering to bloom again." [228] The words landed in her chest like a coal she could not spit out. [241]

Days passed, or what she assumed were days. [249] She began finding origami figures — a crane on the lens cap, a lily in the logbook, a fox balanced on the railing of the observation deck. [274] Each one, when she unfolded it, contained coordinates written in a careful hand. [286] She fed the numbers into the telescope's brass dials and aimed the instrument where they pointed. [300]

The first set of coordinates revealed a nebula she had never seen catalogued — a curtain of gas lit from within by a dying star, its folds rippling with intention, as though the universe were drawing a veil and then changing its mind, pulling it back to reveal what burned beneath. [345] Curtains of intention, she thought, and wrote the phrase in the margin of the logbook. [361] The light that reached her was genuinely artificial in a sense — not false, but shaped by distance and time into something the original star would never recognize as its own. [390] The photons were real; the image was a ghost. [399] She understood that paradox. [403] Every mourning brooch she had ever made was the same: real gold holding an absence, genuine artifice meant to illuminate what could no longer be seen. [425]

She began to work again. [430] Not jewelry — not yet — but she took the vellum stencil and traced its bloom onto copper sheeting she found in the supply room. [453] She cut and filed and set a sliver of dark glass from a cracked filter into the skeletal hand's palm, so that when light passed through, the bloom cast a shadow-Loss on one side and a light-bloom on the other. [494] She did not know whom she was making it for. [504] That felt like progress. [508]

More origami figures appeared. [512] She stopped questioning their origin — Sable, the building itself, her own sleepwalking hands. [524] Each coordinate illuminated a different celestial object in transition: a white dwarf feeding a companion, a comet shedding its tail, a galaxy mid-collision trailing new stars like sparks from a forge. [552] Every dying thing she witnessed through the eyepiece was also becoming. [562]

On what she decided to call the last night, Elara folded her own origami figure — a simple heart, because her skill was rough — and tucked inside it the coordinates of the nebula she had named Curtain. [596] She left it on the eyepiece for whoever came next, whoever arrived at the observatory with hands that had stopped. [615]

Then she sat at the bench and began a new brooch. [625] She used the stencil's bloom as her template, setting a chip of that dark observatory glass where a gemstone would go. [647] It was mourning jewelry, yes — but when she held it to the perpetual dusk streaming through the dome slit, the glass caught the mingled star-and-sunlight and threw a tiny constellation across her wrist, her arm, the wall. [688] It did not erase the withering. [694] It did not pretend the skeletal hand was anything other than bone. [705] But between those fingers, something opened, petal by petal, genuine and artificial and luminous all at once. [720]

She clasped it around her own wrist, the first piece of mourning jewelry she had ever made for herself, and descended the ridge into whatever hour waited below. [748]
