Maren had not sung for anyone in seven years, though she composed every day. [13] The ballads lived in notebooks she kept beneath her cot in the signal tower, their melodies unheard by any living soul. [33] She was a seldom-heard balladeer by choice and by circumstance, stationed alone at the Cirrus Relay, a stone outpost whose courtyard floated above a permanent sea of clouds. [58]

The mist curled through the colonnade each morning like something curious and alive. [70] Maren moved through it in her usual state--driftingly alert, half-dreaming but catching every shift in wind pressure, every flicker in the monitoring equipment that connected her tower to the network below. [97] She tended the instruments the way a watchmaker tends gears: with tinkering devotion, with quiet wonder at the fact that any of it worked at all. [121]

It was during a storm that she first noticed the ghost in the code. [134]

Lightning split the sky, and in that held-breath moment between the flash and the thunder's answer, her receiver printed a string of data that belonged to no known signal. [162] The characters resolved into coordinates--not geographic, but spatial, pointing to the courtyard's western wall. [176] Maren pulled on her coat and walked outside into the rain. [187]

There, on ancient stone that had been bare that morning, she found graffiti. [199] Not the scrawl of vandals but something elaborate and luminous: a mural of overlapping flowers--foxglove, larkspur, forget-me-not--painted in pigments that seemed to glow faintly against the wet rock. [230] Within the petals, she recognized patterning. [236] Dots and dashes. [239] Someone had encoded a message through art, threading meaning into the curvature of stems and the spacing of leaves. [254]

She spent the night deciphering it. [260] The message read: I AM STILL HERE. [267] PRESS THE PLATE. [271]

Maren knew which plate. [275] In the supply room, bolted to a forgotten workbench, sat a flower press--a relic from some previous keeper who had cataloged alpine specimens. [296] The bolt plate that clamped the press shut was engraved with a pattern she had always assumed was decorative. [314] Now she saw it differently. [319] She ran her fingers across the grooves and understood they were a cipher key. [332]

She carried the bolt plate to the wall and held it against the mural, aligning the engravings with the painted stems. [352] New letters emerged from the overlay, dozens of them, tumbling into sentences that made her breath catch. [367]

The messages were from Elin. [372]

Elin, who had kept this station before Maren. [380] Elin, whose departure had been logged as "transfer, routine" but whose personal effects had never been collected. [395] Elin, who had apparently not departed at all but had instead become something else--a presence threaded into the relay's code, a ghost who pulsed through the signal network and could only speak through art painted on stone in the instant between lightning and thunder, when the electromagnetic veil thinned enough for her to reach through. [447]

The encoded graffiti said what Elin had never been able to say while alive. [460] That the isolation had hollowed her. [466] That she had needed someone to hear her and had not known how to ask. [479] That she had poured herself into the signal equipment so completely that the boundary between operator and operation dissolved, and now she existed as pattern, as frequency, as a ghost in the code who painted flowers on walls because flowers were the language she had never spoken aloud. [522]

Maren understood this need--to articulate what lodged silent in the chest, to encode longing into form because speaking it directly felt impossible. [543] Her own notebooks were full of exactly that. [550] Ballads about connection written by someone who connected to no one. [560]

She sat in the misty courtyard and, for the first time in seven years, sang. [574] She sang one of her unheard ballads into the clouds, and the monitoring equipment behind her flickered and hummed in response. [594] The mist swirled into shapes that might have been a woman listening. [605]

After that, Maren began to encode her own messages back. [615] She mixed pigments from lichen and mineral dust and painted answering murals on the eastern wall--song lyrics hidden in the geometry of painted constellations. [638] Each storm brought new art from Elin, and each calm brought Maren's reply. [650] The courtyard became a gallery of mutual need made visible, two women speaking through beauty what neither could have said plainly. [668]

The relay operators in the cities below sometimes reported anomalies in the Cirrus signal--fragments of melody woven into the data stream, as though someone were singing through the infrastructure itself. [697] They logged the anomalies and moved on. [703] They did not know that above the clouds, in a courtyard where lightning and thunder traded secrets, a balladeer and a ghost had finally found their audience in each other. [732] The wonder of it was small and handmade, like a tinkerer's music box: improbable, delicate, and turning still. [750]
