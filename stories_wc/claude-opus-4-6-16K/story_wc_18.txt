Vela had always been firmly grounded, even when the world around her dissolved into white. [15] The ruined orchard district had been lost in centuries of thick fog for longer than anyone could remember, its apple trees calcified into skeletal pillars, its stone walls crumbling beneath the weight of moisture that never dried. [47] She kept her workshop in what had once been a cider house, its copper vats long since corroded, and there she practiced her trade: making mirrors. [70]

Not vanity mirrors, not the kind hung above washbasins. [79] Vela made mirrors that captured things. [85] Light, yes, but also the angles at which light remembered what it had touched. [97] Her mirrors held images of orchards before the fog came, streets that no longer existed, faces belonging to no one still living. [117] She sold them to the few traders brave enough to navigate the district's mist-drowned corridors, and they carried her work out into the world like frozen songs. [142]

But one mirror she had never been able to sell, because one night it had shown her something she did not make: a dream. [164] It surfaced unbidden in the glass--a vision of the district restored, every tree heavy with fruit, the fog parted like curtains to reveal a sky of staggering clarity. [191] She had reached for it, and the image fled. [200] It tore from the mirror's surface and vanished into the fog as though it had legs, as though it feared being held. [220]

Since that night, Vela had been trying to capture the runaway dream. [231]

The astronomer's broken sextant came to her by way of a collapsed roof. [243] She found it in the rubble of the old observatory at the district's northern edge, its arc cracked, its mirrors clouded, its index arm bent at an angle that pointed nowhere useful. [271] But Vela understood mirrors and the instruments that depended on them. [281] She recognized what the sextant had once done: measured the distance between a star and the horizon, erasing boundaries between the celestial and the terrestrial by collapsing them into a single observed angle. [308] That was what she needed. [313] Not the device repaired, but its principle resurrected. [321]

She spent weeks preparing. [325] She ground new mirrors to fit the sextant's fractured frame, silver-backed glass cut so thin it sang when she breathed on it. [345] She calibrated each fragment not to stars but to the fog itself, adjusting for the way light bent through moisture, the way the district's perpetual haze turned every direction into the same direction. [376] She was learning to recreate the sextant's function in reverse--not measuring boundaries, but dissolving them. [390]

The moment came upon the shimmer of twilight frost, that rare instant when the temperature dropped sharply enough to crystallize the fog into billions of suspended ice needles. [415] The district transformed. [418] Every surface glittered as though the air itself had grown edges, and the light fractured into prismatic corridors that cut through the white like glass mountains rising from nothing, sharp and translucent, terrible and beautiful. [449]

Vela stood among the dead trees with the sextant raised, its hybrid mirrors catching the frost-light at angles she had calculated through months of patient observation. [474] She could feel the dream out there, trembling in the fog like a deer at a river's edge. [490] She pressed the eyepiece to her face and began to breathe. [501]

Slowly at first, then with intention. [507] She synchronized her breathing with the pulse of the frost--the slow crystallization, the faint expansion of ice forming on every branch and stone. [528] Inhale as the crystals grew. [533] Exhale as they settled. [537] Through synchronized breathing, she matched herself to the rhythm of the district, and in that matching, something gave way. [554]

The boundary between mirror and world dissolved. [561] The boundary between dreamer and dream thinned to nothing. [570] Through the sextant's cracked arc, she saw it: the orchard in bloom, the sky wide and impossibly blue, the fog retreating like a tide. [593] The runaway dream hovered in the glass, caught at last not by force but by resonance. [608]

Vela lowered the sextant and breathed once more, and the image held. [620] It did not flee. [624] It stayed because she had erased the boundary between longing and the thing longed for, between ruin and restoration. [640] She had not trapped the dream. [646] She had become the surface in which it could finally rest. [656]

Around her, the frost shimmered and the fog closed in again, patient and ancient. [669] But in Vela's hands, the broken sextant gleamed with a light that had no earthly source, and in its mirrors, apple blossoms drifted like snow falling upward into a sky made entirely of glass. [702]
