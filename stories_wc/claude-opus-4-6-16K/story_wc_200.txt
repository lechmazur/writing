The echo gorge held sound the way a cupped hand holds water — loosely, tremblingly, always on the verge of spilling. [24]

Maren descended its narrow throat in the hush of a hidden sunrise, that strange hour when light had not yet crested the canyon walls but the sky above already burned pale gold, casting no shadows, only a diffuse and aching glow. [58] She carried her harp on her back and the crocodile's tooth on a cord against her sternum, and she moved with the quiet certainty of someone who had done this many times before and feared it only the appropriate amount. [93]

She was a lost soul collector — not a title she had chosen but one that had settled on her like dust. [113] The dead who could not move on gathered in places like this, gorges and hollows where sound folded back on itself, where a whisper could persist for days. [140] They came because they had something left to say. [149] Maren came because she had learned to listen. [157]

She found a flat stone near the canyon floor and unslung her harp. [169] Its frame was old ash wood, its strings deliberately misaligned — three tuned a quarter-step flat, two sharp, one that buzzed against a crack in the neck. [196] The distortion was the point. [201] Perfect music pleased the living. [206] The dead needed something rougher, something that mirrored the way they experienced time: bent, recursive, never quite resolving. [222]

She struck the first chord, and it rang up the gorge walls and came back changed, the echo layering over itself until the stone hummed. [245] Through the distorted notes of the misaligned harp, the spectral confessions began. [256]

A voice threaded into the dissonance — a man's voice, old and bewildered. [267] He said he had never told his daughter he was proud of her. [279] He said he had stood in her kitchen the morning she graduated and made a joke about the coffee instead. [297] The joke had been funny. [302] She had laughed. [305] But the pride had stayed locked behind his teeth, and now the teeth were gone, and the words rattled in him like seeds in a dry gourd. [332]

Maren played and listened. [336] This was the method: pursue the confession not with questions but with music that made space for it, the way a river makes space for stones. [361] She did not flinch when the voice cracked into a sob that the gorge multiplied into a dozen sobs, a choir of grief bouncing wall to wall. [389] She was modestly fearless in this way — not brave by dramatic measure, but steady, present, willing to sit inside the pain without trying to fix it prematurely. [415]

When the sobs quieted, she asked the question she always asked. [426] "What made you laugh?" [429]

Silence. [430] Then, slowly: the man described his daughter at age four, wearing his boots, clomping through mud, turning to him with a grin so wide it seemed to split her face. [457] He laughed telling it. [461] The sound was thin and spectral but unmistakable, and Maren caught it in her playing, wove it into the next chord, let the gorge amplify it until laughter and music and echo became indistinguishable. [493]

This was her purpose, her deepest motivation: to integrate laughter into healing. [504] Not to deny the grief but to remind the dead that joy had also been real, that it was not erased by the things left unsaid. [528] The crocodile's tooth against her chest was warm now — it always warmed when a soul began to loosen. [546] She had pulled it from a riverbank years ago, a talisman from a creature that could hold its breath for hours beneath dark water and still surface into light. [573] It reminded her that submersion was not the same as drowning. [583]

The man's voice softened, thinned, began to dissolve into the ambient hum of the gorge. [597] He was moving on. [601] Maren kept playing until the last echo faded and the sunrise finally broke over the canyon rim, flooding the stone with gold so bright it hurt, a luminous ache that was indistinguishable from beauty. [635]

She rested her hands on the strings. [642] Somewhere above, birds began to sing in perfect tune, and for a moment the contrast with her harp's deliberate imperfection made her smile. [663] She would climb out soon, find the next gorge, the next hollow, the next voice caught between what was said and what was meant. [687]

But for now she sat in the light and let the silence hold her the way the gorge held sound — loosely, tremblingly, precious because it would not last. [715]
