Voss pressed her fingertips against the corroded hull plating and listened. [10] Not with her ears—those were useless in the abandoned spaceport repair bay, where the only audible sound was the drip of recycled condensation falling from severed coolant lines—but with the dense network of nerve grafts threaded beneath her skin, each one calibrated to translate texture, temperature, and electromagnetic residue into spatial data. [56] She was a sensory map maker, one of the last, and the bay's ghost signals told her everything official records refused to. [74]

The repair bay on Olen Station had been decommissioned nine years ago, the same week her mother vanished. [90] Officials called it an accident: a routine slip-drive calibration that sheared the technician out of local spacetime. [105] But Voss had spent those nine years learning to read the skin of the universe, and the readings here didn't match an accident. [125] They matched a deliberate crossing. [129] Her mother had gone somewhere on purpose, and someone had sealed the record. [141] Voss needed to discover the weight of that withheld truth—not just the fact of it, but how heavy it had been for the people who chose silence, and whether that weight justified the years of grief they'd let her carry alone. [176]

She pulled a green glass shard from her belt pouch and held it to the light leaking through a cracked viewport. [196] The shard was the only artifact recovered from the calibration chamber after the event: a fragment of her mother's diagnostic lens, fused by energies no standard slip-drive produced. [222] Under Voss's nerve grafts, it hummed with coordinates that didn't belong to this universe. [235]

That was the secret she'd uncovered three months ago. [244] The shard was a key, cyclically spontaneous in its activation—it didn't open on command but on rhythm, syncing to some deeper pulse that Voss had learned to predict only by mapping its prior eruptions. [275] Every eleven days, give or take an hour influenced by local gravity, the shard resonated, and in the murmur of half-remembered dreams—that liminal phase when Voss hovered between sleep and waking—it pulled her consciousness sideways through parallel universes. [313]

Each crossing was brief. [316] Each one showed her a version of the repair bay where her mother still stood at the calibration console, alive, working, sometimes humming. [335] But Voss couldn't stay, couldn't speak, couldn't touch. [343] She could only map—record the sensory architecture of each world, note the differences, triangulate. [357] She was weaving between worlds the way a cartographer threads survey lines across uncharted terrain, stitching data from each crossing into a single coherent chart that might finally explain where her mother had actually gone and why. [393]

Tonight the shard was warm. [398] Voss lay on a tarp spread across the bay's grated floor, her fingers wrapped around the glass, and let herself drift toward the threshold. [421] The hum built. [424] The bay dissolved. [427]

She arrived in a version where the repair bay was operational, lights blazing, tools racked neatly on magnetic strips. [443] Her mother stood at the console, but this time she was not alone. [455] A man in a station administrator's uniform was gripping her arm, speaking rapidly. [466] Voss's grafts captured every vibration. [471] He was telling her to redirect the slip-drive's output—not to repair it, but to open a permanent corridor between universes, one the administration could exploit. [494] Her mother refused. [497] The administrator said refusal would be recorded as sabotage, punishable by erasure from all station logs. [512]

Her mother pulled free, turned to the console, and did redirect the drive—but not the way he wanted. [530] She aimed it at herself, launching into the corridor alone and collapsing it behind her so no one could follow or replicate the passage. [553] She chose exile to protect every world on the other side. [563]

The vision shattered. [566] Voss lay gasping on the tarp, the green glass shard now cold and cracked further, nearly spent. [581] But her map was complete. [585] She had the coordinates of the corridor's far anchor, and she had the truth: her mother hadn't been erased by accident or malice but by her own fierce, deliberate love. [611]

The weight of the withheld truth settled into Voss's chest—not crushing, but solid, like ballast. [626] She understood now why the administrators had sealed the record: not to protect her mother's memory, but to protect themselves from the evidence of what they'd tried to do. [653]

Voss stood, pocketed the shard, and began calibrating her nerve grafts for a new purpose. [667] She would not weave passively anymore. [673] She would build a map others could follow—to the truth, to accountability, and if the coordinates held, to her mother. [693] The repair bay was silent around her, but beneath her fingertips the universe hummed with directions home. [709]
