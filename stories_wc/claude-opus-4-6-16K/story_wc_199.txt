In the ashen skyborne arbor, where pale branches spread like veins against a sky the color of spent hearths, Lirren sat cross-legged on a platform of petrified wood and sorted seeds. [33]

She had always been orderly about it. [40] The roses went into the clay jar with the chipped rim. [51] The fiddlehead fern spores went into the envelope she'd folded from a page of regional folklore — a tale about the Moth Queen who wove prophecies into the wings of her children, which Lirren had read so many times the ink was nearly gone. [93] The bristlecone seeds, oldest of all, went into the hollow of her own palm, where she held them like prayers before placing them in their designated tin. [119]

Everything in order. [122] Everything accounted for. [125] That was her way, and it had been her way since the arbor first lifted from the ground three generations ago, carrying its grove of ghost-white trees into the permanent haze above the Kindling Valleys. [155]

But today the leaves were falling differently. [162]

They spiraled in sequences she hadn't seen before — not the usual autumn release, not wind-scatter, but deliberate, patterned descents that made her breath catch. [186] This was the hush where past meets prophecy, that liminal season the old stories called the Moth Queen's Inhale, when time thinned and meaning seeped through the cracks of the world like rain through thatch. [218] Lirren had waited years for this. [224] Her entire purpose — sorting, cataloging, preserving — had always been in service of a deeper motivation: to decode the message in falling leaves. [243]

She watched a silver-veined leaf pinwheel past her knee and land on the moss-covered railing. [258] Its veins formed a symbol she recognized from the folklore page: the spiral-and-tooth, which the valley people once carved into doorframes to invite transformation. [281] Another leaf followed, bearing a crescent. [287] Then another, with three parallel lines. [293]

Lirren's fingers trembled as she arranged them in sequence on her sorting table. [305] She prodded the first leaf gently with her bone stylus, turning it to catch the wan light, and the symbol shifted — no, deepened — as if the leaf were still alive and responding to her touch. [340]

"You're speaking," she whispered to the arbor. [348] The trees had never spoken before. [354] Not to her mother, not to her grandmother, who had built this station among the branches and begun the sorting tradition. [372]

Lirren reached into her breast pocket and withdrew the one object she never sorted, never categorized, because it belonged to no system she understood: a moonstone cabochon dust speck, so small it sat on her fingertip like a point of frozen light. [412] Her grandmother had found it lodged in the bark of the oldest tree and told her it was the Moth Queen's last tear, shed before she dissolved into prophecy. [441] Lirren held it over the leaf-symbols and watched it catch their meaning, refracting the spiral-and-tooth into a constellation on the wood beneath. [464]

The message assembled itself. [468]

Build for what is forgotten, the leaves said. [476] Monument by monument, until remembering returns. [482]

So Lirren did what the arbor asked. [489] She began building tiny monuments to forgotten things — a cairn of bristlecone seeds for the valley villages that had existed before the lifting, a small arch of fern spores and resin for the river that once ran beneath them, a miniature obelisk of pressed rose petals for her grandmother's name, which no one alive besides Lirren still spoke aloud. [541]

Each monument she finished changed her. [547] She felt the moss-green delight of it first in her chest, then spreading outward — a joy ancient and damp and alive, the joy of things growing over ruins and making them beautiful. [577] Her hands, always so precise in their sorting, discovered a new precision: the architecture of grief transformed into celebration. [594]

When she placed the moonstone speck atop the final monument — a tiny throne for the Moth Queen herself, built from bark shavings and the folklore page she no longer needed because its words now lived in her — the arbor shuddered. [633] Leaves erupted upward instead of falling, carrying the symbols into the ashen sky where they rearranged themselves into a moth with wings wide enough to shadow the entire grove. [662]

Lirren stood beneath it, transformed as she always emerged transformed from every task she undertook fully. [677] But this was different from the small daily transformations of a woman who finds purpose in order. [692] This was the deep change, the one the folklore had promised: she had become the translator, the bridge between what the arbor remembered and what the valley below had forgotten. [720]

The moth dissolved into a thousand new leaves that drifted down with fresh symbols, fresh messages, fresh seeds of meaning for her to sort. [744]

Lirren smiled, sat down, and began again. [751]
