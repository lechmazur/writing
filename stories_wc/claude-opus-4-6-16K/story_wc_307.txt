The boy who was once an old man sat cross-legged on the floating rock meditation platform, his legs too short now to dangle over the edge. [27] Below him, the pond lay black and still, cradled inside the magnetic grotto under starlight, where the basalt walls pulled gently at the iron in his blood and made his thoughts slow like honey. [57] He was seven today, or rather, he had counted backwards to seven. [68] Sixty-three years of living in reverse had stripped away his wrinkles, his stoop, his white beard, leaving him with milk teeth and hands too small to hold the stones he liked to throw. [94]

His student, Maren, knelt on the platform's edge across from him, her face lit blue by the mineral veins threading the grotto's ceiling. [116] She was twenty-nine, aging the normal direction, and she had come because she was disappearing. [131] Not metaphorically. [133] Her left hand had gone translucent three months ago, and now the transparency had crept past her wrist. [148] Physicians called it Veil Syndrome. [153] She called it terror. [157]

"You said you could teach me to stop it," she whispered. [167]

He picked up a pebble from the small pile he kept beside him. [180] He did not answer yet. [185] He had learned, across decades of reversing, that the truth must be woven carefully, thread by patient thread, or it unravels the listener. [206] So he chose to withhold. [211]

Instead, he tossed the pebble into the pond. [219]

The stone broke the surface and the rings began, concentric and perfect, spreading outward through the dark water until they kissed the grotto walls and returned, collapsing inward again, smaller and smaller, converging on the point of origin. [253] The magnetic minerals in the basalt made the ripples behave strangely here, bending them into spirals, figure eights, brief geometries that existed nowhere else in the world. [278]

"Watch the rings," he said, his child's voice carrying the eerie calm of a man who remembered being eighty. [296] "Not the splash. [299] The splash is what everyone watches. [305] But the truth is in the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown, not in the stone itself." [326]

Maren stared. [328] Through the trance the ripples induced, her breathing slowed, and the starlight filtering through the grotto's open crown seemed to thicken. [348] The rings played across her translucent hand, light passing through flesh as though through glass. [362]

"You think I came here to cure this," she said quietly. [373]

"You came here because you are afraid of vanishing," he replied. [384] "But vanishing is not what you think it is." [393]

He threw another stone. [397] New rings collided with the ghosts of old ones, creating interference patterns that shimmered like breathing lattice. [413] He had spent forty years of reverse-aging studying this phenomenon, publishing papers under names that matched his changing face, a backwards aging researcher whose bibliography read like a riddle. [440] Each paper revealed a fraction more, a delayed revelation stretched across a lifetime lived in the wrong direction, because he understood that the most important truths must arrive late enough that the student is ready to hold them. [475]

"Your body is not disappearing," he said finally, and the sycamore hush of the grotto absorbed his words the way old bark absorbs rain. [499] "It is arriving somewhere else. [504] The transparency is a doorway, not an ending." [512]

Maren's breath caught. [515] She looked at her vanishing hand, then at the ripples, then at him, this impossible child with ancient eyes. [533]

"You knew this whole time," she said. [540]

"I withheld it because you needed to see the rings first." [551] He gestured at the pond, where the last ripples were spiraling inward, returning to center. [565] "A splash looks like destruction. [570] But every ring carries the stone's energy outward, touches the walls, and comes back changed. [583] Nothing thrown into water is ever lost. [590] It only redistributes." [593]

She lifted her translucent hand into the starlight and watched the grotto's mineral glow pass through her palm like a lantern. [614] For the first time, it did not look like dying. [624] It looked like the outermost ring of a long, patient throw, still expanding toward a wall she could not yet see. [645]

"My motivation," he said softly, pulling his small knees to his chest, "was never to cure you. [662] It was to teach vanishing to appear as what it truly is." [673]

"And what is that?" [677]

He smiled with seven-year-old teeth and seventy years of knowing. [688] "Arrival," he said, and tossed one final stone. [697] The rings began again, carrying their quiet truth outward through the magnetic dark, and Maren watched them without fear, her disappearing hand open and reaching, as if to catch the light that was already, everywhere, passing through.
