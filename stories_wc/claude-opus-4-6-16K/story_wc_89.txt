The orchard had bloomed under permanent moonlight for as long as anyone could remember, its silver-leafed trees heavy with fruit that glowed like lanterns strung across the dark. [31] No sun had ever touched this place. [38] The moon hung swollen and unmoving, casting everything in a luminescence that made the world feel held, as though the sky itself were cupping the land in pale hands. [63]

Maren walked barefoot between the rows of trees, her fingers trailing along bark that hummed with the voices of sleeping creatures. [83] She was a beast whisperer, the last of a line that had spoken to wolves in their own tongue, had sung lullabies to serpents, had negotiated truces between hawks and hares. [111] But the beast she sought now was no ordinary animal. [121]

In her pocket, she carried a slip of paper pulled from a cookie at a roadside inn three moons ago, its words paradoxically steady against the chaos of her grief: "What dies in fire returns in fragrance." [153] She had almost discarded it, but something in the fortune's calm certainty had stopped her hand. [169] It was the first clue that led her here, to this orchard at the edge of everything, after the phoenix had risen. [190]

The phoenix. [192] Her phoenix. [194] Aster had been her companion since childhood, a creature of impossible warmth who had nested in her hair when small enough to fit in a cupped palm. [219] They had shared a bond beyond the usual whisperer's contract, something cellular and ancient, a thread woven through the marrow of them both. [241] When Aster had burned, as phoenixes must, Maren had expected renewal, the joyful cycle of ash and rebirth. [258] But Aster had risen wrong. [263] The bird that emerged from the pyre was vast and distant, its eyes full of cosmic fire but empty of recognition. [282] It had screamed once, a sound like tearing constellations, and flown into the permanent moonlight of the orchard, where no whisperer had ever followed. [305]

Now Maren knelt beneath the largest tree and opened the leather pouch at her belt. [320] Inside were the rare spices she had gathered across three kingdoms: saffron from a desert that bloomed once a century, cardamom harvested by monks who spoke only in mathematics, and a single star anise that had fallen from an actual star. [358] Their combined scent was the method by which she would conjure the old bond back into being, calling to whatever fragment of Aster still remembered the girl who had once warmed her hands against a tiny bird's feathers. [394]

She crushed the spices between her palms and the fragrance rose, thick and otherworldly, threading through the moonlit branches. [413] The orchard responded. [416] Fruit split open on the boughs, releasing perfume. [423] The trees leaned inward, listening. [428]

And then Aster came. [432]

The phoenix descended through the canopy like a second moon falling, enormous and terrible and beautiful, its feathers trailing filaments of light that made the darkness hum. [457] It landed before Maren and regarded her with eyes that contained the births and deaths of galaxies. [473]

Maren felt the pull then, the thing the fortune had truly meant. [485] Not Aster's return to what was, but Maren's own reluctant metamorphosis. [496] The spice-scent was changing her, had been changing her since she first crushed the saffron threads weeks ago, preparing her body for a transformation she had not consciously chosen. [524] Her skin shimmered. [527] Feathers, fine as eyelashes, emerged along her arms. [535]

She understood now. [538] To reforge a bond beyond death, one of them had to cross the threshold. [552] Aster could not come back down to the human world. [562] The phoenix had risen too far, into something too luminous and vast. [574] But Maren could rise too. [579]

"I didn't want this," she whispered, and her voice carried harmonics she had never heard before, the frequencies of solar wind and deep-space silence. [601] Aster lowered that enormous head, and for the first time since the burning, Maren saw recognition flicker in those cosmic eyes. [620]

She let the metamorphosis take her. [626] It was not painless. [630] It was not gentle. [634] But the scent of rare spices cradled her through it, paradoxically steady even as every cell in her body rewritten itself into light and feather and fire. [662]

When it was done, two phoenixes stood in the fairy-tale orchard beneath the permanent moon, their necks intertwined, their flames casting shadows that looked like a girl and her bird, small and warm and inseparable. [697] The fortune's slip of paper drifted from where a pocket had been, settling into the roots of the silver tree. [717]

The orchard held its breath, then exhaled blossoms. [725] Somewhere beyond the sky, the stars rearranged themselves into a shape that, if you squinted, looked like two wings folded together, intimate as a whispered secret shared between the living and the once-dead, suspended forever in the space where love refuses its own ending. [767]
