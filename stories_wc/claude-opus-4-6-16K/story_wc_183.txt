<story>The carnival ship listed gently, its rusted hull carving slow arcs through the fog of Harmon Bay. [17] Maren stood on the tilted midway where game booths sagged like broken teeth, their painted faces bleeding color into the mist. [36] She had been drifting for three days now, or maybe five. [46] Time behaved differently here, bending the way the fog bent light—softly, without announcement. [58]

She was free. [61] That was the cruel precision of it. [68] Free to roam every deck, free to open every door, free to stand at the railing and watch the gray water stretch in all directions without shoreline. [94] Trapped in the widest cage the world could offer. [103]

Maren had come aboard at the marina in Caulfield, following a rumor she had traced through narrative threads—journal entries, forum posts, a handwritten letter tucked inside a secondhand book. [132] Each thread spoke of the same place: the Garden of Forgotten Names, where identities lost to time and silence were supposedly kept, catalogued like pressed flowers. [156] She needed to find it. [161] She needed one name in particular—the name of the twin she had consumed before birth. [176]

She was a chimera. [180] Two genomes spiraled through her body, her own and another's, a sister who had never drawn breath but whose cells lived on in Maren's skin, her blood, her liver. [207] The doctors had called it vanishing twin syndrome, but nothing had vanished. [218] Her twin was right here, threaded into every organ, unnamed and unacknowledged. [229] Maren had discovered this at thirty-one during a routine blood panel that returned impossible results. [242] Two people in one body. [247] She had been blissfully aberrant her whole life without knowing it, carrying a passenger who was also a host, a ghost who was also the house. [273]

The emerald swatch card she had found in the ship's paint locker was the latest thread. [288] One side showed a gradient of greens—moss, sage, juniper, emerald—but on the reverse, someone had written in pencil: Deck C, Nursery, behind the mural of roots. [315] She had been collecting clues like these, each one left by a previous searcher or perhaps by the ship itself, which seemed to rearrange its corridors when she was not looking. [345]

As memories alter, so does the architecture. [352] She had read that warning in the letter. [359] At first she thought it was metaphor. [366] Now she understood. [369] Her own memories were shifting. [374] The recollection of her mother's face had developed a second pair of eyes, faint and overlapping, as if someone else's memory of the same woman was bleeding through. [400] The hallway to Deck C had not existed yesterday. [409] Today it yawned open beside the funhouse, lined with faded pennants that smelled of caramel and sea rot. [426]

She was trying to recapture something that had never been fully captured in the first place—a life, a name, an identity that existed only as cellular echoes. [451] This was the unkindled solace of having a sister: a comfort she had carried unknowingly for decades but had never been able to light, never been able to warm her hands against. [481] It was the solace of a match never struck. [490]

The nursery on Deck C was small and round, its walls painted with a mural of an enormous tree whose roots plunged through the floorboards into painted soil. [517] Behind the trunk, where the roots converged, someone had cut a narrow door into the wall. [532]

Maren pushed it open. [536]

Beyond was a room she could not have predicted: a greenhouse, impossible in its dimensions, stretching far past what the ship's hull should allow. [558] Plants grew in wild profusion—ferns, ivy, flowers she had no name for—and from every branch and stem hung small paper tags, each bearing a single name written in green ink. [588] Thousands of them, turning gently in a breeze that carried no source. [599]

The Garden of Forgotten Names. [604]

She walked among them, reading. [609] Some names sparked nothing. [613] Others sent tremors through her chest as the other genome, the other self, stirred in recognition. [628] She moved deeper, letting every narrative thread—every journal, every letter, every scrawled note on a swatch card—converge into this single moment of searching. [651]

Then she found it. [655] A tag hung from a vine of white jasmine, the ink fresh as if written minutes ago. [671] A name she had never heard but recognized immediately, the way she recognized her own pulse. [685]

She spoke it aloud, and the fog outside thinned, and the ship, for one full breath, stopped drifting. [703]

In that stillness Maren felt the match finally catch—a warmth behind her ribs, small but definite, where the unkindled thing had waited all along. [727] She was still trapped on the water, still free in the fog, still two selves braided into one bewildered woman standing in an impossible garden. [750] But the name lived in her mouth now, and that changed everything. [761]
