The prism terrace drifted westward again, its crystalline platforms refracting the last of a sun that no longer held fixed position in the sky. [25] This was the world after the butterfly effect—after a single monarch's wingbeat in Oaxaca had cascaded through atmospheric systems until weather itself became migratory, untethered, a roaming thing. [51] Cities had fractured. [54] Seasons arrived out of order, if they arrived at all. [63]

Maren sat cross-legged on the terrace's lowest tier, running her fingertips along the grain of a salvaged oak table. [81] The wood whispered its history in concentric lines—drought years narrow and pale, flood years dark and swollen. [96] She had learned to read these patterns the way her mother once read aerial photographs of cropland, plotting the corridors and dead ends of her famous corn mazes. [121] Maren was the corn maze architect's lost child, though she had not been lost in the way people assumed. [139] Her mother had designed labyrinths meant to disorient, and Maren had simply wandered into the largest one and kept walking until the corn gave way to open prairie, and then to highway, and then to years. [170]

Now she analyzed the grain in wooden furniture because it was the closest thing she had to communion. [187] Every table, every chair, every beam carried a climate record older and more honest than anything humans had written down. [206] She could intuit from a plank of ash whether the tree had grown on a hillside or in a valley, whether it had known fire, whether it had been lonely. [234] This was her method for understanding the new world's chaos—finding pattern where pattern had supposedly dissolved. [249]

Beside her on the refracting glass sat a pilot logbook, its margins dense with weather code. [264] She had found it in the wreckage of a cargo plane that the drifting terrace had passed over three days ago. [283] The codes were standard meteorological shorthand—CB for cumulonimbus, FG for fog, TS for thunderstorm—but the pilot had added personal annotations. [302] "Necessary distance from cell: 40nm," read one entry. [311] Another: "Necessary distance from home: unknown." [317]

That phrase had cracked something open in Maren. [325] Necessary distances. [327] The concept named what she had spent her life practicing without language for it. [340] The distance between herself and her mother's labyrinth. [349] The distance between a tree's rings and the sky that shaped them. [361] The distance between standing on a threshold and crossing it. [371]

The terrace shifted, and light broke through its surface in feathered arcs, prismatic and fleeting. [385] Maren felt featherly determined—there was no better way to describe it—as though her resolve had the quality of down, soft but insistent, impossible to shake from skin once it touched you. [414] She opened the logbook to the final entry. [423]

The pilot had written: "Threshold at FL350. [430] Sky turned sacred. [433] Cannot explain. [435] Returning." [436]

To discover why some thresholds feel sacred—this was the question Maren had carried since childhood, since the moment she stood at the edge of her mother's tallest corn maze and felt the air change. [467] Not temperature. [469] Not wind. [471] Something cellular. [473] A recognition that crossing over would mean she could not come back as the same person. [486] She had crossed anyway. [490]

The terrace drifted over what had once been Nebraska. [499] Below, she could see the remnants of a cornfield, its rows buckled by unseasonal frost, its geometry ruined. [516] Somewhere in that landscape, her mother might still be designing mazes no one would walk. [531] Maren pressed her palm flat against the oak table and felt the grain like Braille, and she intuited a truth the wood had been holding: the tree had grown at an edge. [562] Forest meeting field. [565] A threshold species. [568]

She understood then that necessary distances were not about separation. [578] They were about the space required for recognition—the gap between two things that allows each to see the other clearly. [597] Her mother's mazes had taught this. [603] You had to be lost before you could understand the architecture of finding. [615]

Maren closed the logbook and tucked it into her coat. [625] The fractured hush of the drifting terrace surrounded her—part silence, part the faint chime of light splitting through glass. [644] She stood. [646] The terrace was approaching lower altitude, and she could see a road below, cracked but walkable. [662] She would descend. [665] She would carry the weather codes and the wood grain knowledge and the featherly determination that had kept her moving since she was nine years old and chose the open prairie over the known path. [697]

Some thresholds feel sacred because they ask you to become someone you haven't met yet. [714] Maren stepped to the edge of the terrace, measured the necessary distance to the ground, and jumped. [731]
