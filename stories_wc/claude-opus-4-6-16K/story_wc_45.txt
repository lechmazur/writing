Maren had always been the village's forgiving skeptic, the kind of woman who would hear your story about fairy lights in the bog, press her lips together, doubt every word, and still walk you home so you wouldn't be afraid. [38] She set bones for a living, learned from her grandmother who learned from hers, and she trusted the things she could feel beneath her fingers: the clean snap of a fracture finding its true line again, the slow persuasion of cartilage remembering its shape. [72] She did not trust what she could not touch. [80] But after the substitute body was found in the Hargrove cradle--a bundle of elderwood and ash wrapped in a glamour that had finally, after eleven months, begun to rot into visibility--Maren felt the first cleft in her certainty she had known in forty years. [117]

The whole village saw it: the thing in the cradle that was not baby Gemma, had perhaps never been baby Gemma, its wooden joints articulating with a craftsmanship that no local hand could claim. [148] Maren was called because she was the closest thing Alder Fen had to a physician. [163] She examined the stock with steady hands, turning its limbs the way she would assess a broken arm, reading its structure through bone-setting intuition. [184] One of its carved teeth was loose. [190] She pulled it free--and found it was not wood at all but enamel, small and white and ridged with the unmistakable imperfections of something grown, not made. [217] A changeling's baby tooth, wedged into the puppet like a signature. [228]

She held it to the light and felt something she had not allowed herself in decades: she began to yearn. [246] Not for belief exactly, but for the version of the world where her grandmother's stories were maps rather than madness, where every mistake her family had made--the children they couldn't save, the fractures they set crooked, the grief they swallowed until it calcified--could be turned into constellations, bright and navigable, pointing toward something that still mattered. [299]

Her grandmother had spoken of the garden. [306] Everyone's grandmother had. [309] Hidden behind the hedge maze on the Hargrove estate, sealed off since the family's original matriarch planted it two centuries ago, it was supposedly where the fair folk left their doors ajar. [342] Maren had walked past that maze a thousand times and never entered. [354] Tonight she carried a lantern in one hand and the tooth in the other and stepped between the hedges. [371]

The maze tried to confuse her, but she navigated it the way she navigated a shattered wrist: by feel, by the logic of things that wanted to be whole. [399] When the last green wall opened, she found the garden. [410]

It was smaller than the legends promised and wilder than any cultivation should allow. [424] Foxglove grew beside circuits of luminescent moss that pulsed like slow breathing. [435] Old stone benches wore cloaks of ivy wired with something that hummed faintly, a sound halfway between a lullaby and a frequency she associated with modern machines. [460] Nostalgic and innovative at once, as though someone had been tending this place across centuries, layering each era's ingenuity over the last. [480]

And in the center, sitting on the moss with bare feet and enormous dark eyes, was a child. [496]

She looked like Gemma Hargrove but was not Gemma Hargrove. [507] She looked at Maren with an expression that was shrewdly innocent--old knowledge wearing the costume of youth, watching to see whether this human would scream or speak. [533]

"You left your tooth behind," Maren said quietly, kneeling. [542]

The child tilted her head. [547] "I leave things behind so people will come looking," she said. [558] "Most never do." [561]

Maren understood then. [564] The cleft in her certainty widened, and instead of fear she felt the cool air of a larger room she had always refused to enter. [588] She thought of every fracture she had set, every alignment coaxed back to true, and realized this was no different: something broken between worlds, waiting for hands patient enough to hold both sides. [620]

"Gemma," she said. [623] "The real one. [626] Where is she?" [629]

The changeling child stood, brushed moss from her knees, and reached for Maren's hand with small, warm fingers. [646] "I'll show you. [649] But you have to forgive what you find." [656]

Maren closed her hand around the tiny tooth one last time, feeling its edges like a star pressed into her palm, and followed the child deeper into the garden where the oldest mistakes grew into light. [692]

Behind them, the hedge maze quietly rearranged itself, and the path home became something new. [708]
