The workshop drifted on the acid sea like a belch from God's own indigestion, its pontoons of treated brass hissing where the vitriol lapped against them. [28] Gears turned inside gears, cogs meshed with cogs, and the whole magnificent floating junkyard groaned with the kind of purpose that only something truly unhinged could muster. [55] And at its center, hunched over a workbench made of petrified ironwood, sat Maren — the pioneering cart glider who'd once sailed the thermal updrafts of the Sulfur Cliffs on nothing but a wheeled platform and a prayer. [90]

She was steadily curious, which was the polite way of saying she never left anything the hell alone. [108]

"Almost," she muttered, holding up a hunter's arrow tip she'd bartered from a nomad three tides ago. [126] The tip was obsidian, older than language, and she'd ground it into something new: a stylus for the Resonance Engine, the contraption that occupied the workshop's entire north wall like a cathedral organ designed by a lunatic. [160]

The Engine's purpose was simple in theory, catastrophic in ambition. [170] Maren wanted to ring a bell no one hears yet — a frequency so far beyond the current scope of perception that it would only become audible as consciousness itself evolved. [198] She was composing a sound for the future. [206] A sound that would wait. [211]

Throughout the evolution of her work, which had consumed six years and most of her sanity, she had relied on one core principle she called the yearning algorithm. [238] It wasn't math, not exactly. [243] It was a method of calibrating longing — taking the ache of an unmet need and translating it into mechanical instruction. [263] Every gear ratio in the Engine encoded a specific human want: the desire to be understood, the need for warmth, the terror of being forgotten. [287] She tuned each cog by feeling its absence first, then building the thing that would fill the gap. [305]

The yearning algorithm demanded input, though, and this was where the kaleidoscope came in. [318]

Mounted above the workbench on a gimbal of copper rings, the kaleidoscope was no toy. [333] Maren had filled its chamber with fragments of stained glass scavenged from drowned churches, slivers of mirror from pre-acid civilization, and one chip of meteorite that threw prismatic fire when light hit it. [365] She would peer through the eyepiece and slowly rotate the barrel, watching the images tumble and reform — a mandala one moment, a shattered face the next, a spiral that looked suspiciously like the acid sea's own currents viewed from above. [403]

Through the images in the kaleidoscope, she would transliterate emotion into engineering. [414] Each pattern corresponded to a gear configuration. [421] A six-pointed symmetry meant a compound reduction train. [429] A burst of asymmetrical color demanded a friction escapement. [437] She was reading the kaleidoscope the way monks once read sacred texts — with irreverent awe, half-laughing at how ridiculous it was, half-weeping at how perfectly it worked. [462]

Tonight the acid sea was calm, its surface throwing green-yellow light through the workshop's portholes. [477] The fumes were manageable. [480] Maren fitted the obsidian arrow tip into the Engine's primary striker mechanism, the component that would ultimately produce the bell's tone. [498] She'd chosen the arrow tip because it carried intention in its very shape — it was made to fly, to pierce, to arrive. [519] That directionality was crucial. [523] The sound needed to travel not just through space but through time. [534]

She gave the kaleidoscope one final turn, saw an image that looked like overlapping wings, and adjusted the last gear by three teeth. [555]

Then she pulled the lever. [560]

The Engine engaged with a sound like a giant clearing its throat. [572] Cogs bit into cogs. [576] The arrow tip vibrated against the resonance plate, and the workshop shuddered so hard that tools fell from their hooks and the acid sea outside churned in concentric rings. [602]

Maren heard nothing. [605]

She grinned. [607]

That was the whole magnificent, stupid point. [614] The bell was ringing at a frequency her ears couldn't touch, aimed at minds that didn't exist yet — descendants who would evolve the capacity to hear it and wonder who had loved them enough to call out across millennia. [648]

She sat back, acid fumes curling around her ankles, gears still singing their silent song, and laughed with the particular joy of someone who has done something both profoundly important and absolutely absurd. [681]

The workshop floated on. [685] The sea hissed and burned beneath it. [692] And somewhere in the deep future, a bell was already waiting to be heard. [705]
