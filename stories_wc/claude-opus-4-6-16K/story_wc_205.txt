After time became visible, grief wore a different texture on Asteroid Vasari-7. [13]

Maren Solis had once been called the Torch of Elysium Station, a revolutionary who rallied three orbital colonies against the Transit Authority, who spoke in verse so sharp it cut through propaganda frequencies. [46]

That was decades ago. [50]

The revolution succeeded, then calcified, then forgot her. [58]

Now she was defunct in every meaningful sense: a name in archives, a face on no banners, a woman alone on a baroque asteroid where gilded colonnades spiraled into vacuum and cherubim carved from iron ore watched her with hollow eyes. [96]

She had come to Vasari-7 to study the dead. [106]

The asteroid's previous inhabitants, the Vasari culture, had built their halls in extravagant baroque style, every surface ornate, every corridor a meditation on excess and mortality. [133]

They had vanished three centuries before time became visible, before the amber currents of chronology began drifting through space like luminous rivers, pooling in craters, threading through doorways. [161]

Now time could be seen layered over ruins, and archaeologists could read it like sediment. [176]

This changed everything. [179]

This changed nothing, if your colleagues refused to look. [188]

The dispute had consumed Maren for four years. [196]

The prevailing academic interpretation held that the Vasari were decadent isolationists, their ornate constructions the narcissistic excess of a dying culture. [218]

Dr. Leath and the Pontifical Archaeological Congress had published seven volumes to this effect. [232]

Maren believed they were catastrophically wrong. [238]

She wanted to reimagine the entire Vasari civilization, to prove that their baroque grandeur was not vanity but language, a syntax of devotion built by beings who had somehow always known time would one day become visible. [274]

Her evidence centered on a single crystal vase shard. [283]

She had found it in the deepest chamber, where visible time pooled thick as honey and glowed with centuries. [301]

The shard bore micro-engravings: layered verse in Vasari script, poetry nested within poetry, each line shifting meaning depending on which temporal stratum illuminated it. [325]

The Vasari had been poetically inclined in ways that made human literature seem like scratching in dirt. [341]

Their architecture was not decoration. [346]

It was epic verse written in stone and gold. [355]

But Leath dismissed the shard as anomalous. [362]

One fragment, he said, does not rewrite a civilization. [371]

So Maren had to devise another way. [378]

She worked through temporal storms, when the visible currents of time surged and howled through the asteroid's corridors, rattling the gilded frames and threatening to age or reverse everything they touched. [408]

She had learned the Vasari method of covering mirrors during storms, every reflective surface draped in dark cloth so that time would not refract and multiply through them, would not shatter a room into competing centuries. [442]

This practice, too, was evidence. [447]

It showed the Vasari understood time's visible nature before humanity ever did. [458]

It showed foresight, not decadence. [463]

Alone in the shrouded halls, storm-light pressing gold against the draped mirrors, Maren translated the shard line by line. [481]

She cross-referenced engravings with architectural proportions and found metrical patterns: the colonnades were stanzas, the vaulted ceilings were refrains. [502]

The entire asteroid was a poem about impermanence, written by people who loved beauty precisely because they understood how time would eventually consume it. [526]

She compiled her findings with the care of someone who had lost one revolution and could not lose another. [544]

Her report was quiet where her old speeches had been fierce. [555]

It was precise where her manifestos had been incandescent. [564]

She was older now, and sorrow had burnished her the way time burnished the Vasari halls, not diminishing but deepening, lending a patina that made the underlying structure more visible. [593]

She transmitted the monograph to every university in the system. [603]

Then she sat in the great nave of Vasari-7, watching amber time drift past the covered mirrors, and read the walls aloud in the original tongue, a defunct revolutionary giving voice to a defunct civilization, both of them still speaking, still luminous, still refusing the comfortable silence of being forgotten.
