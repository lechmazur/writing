The last spark of the campfire twisted upward and vanished, leaving Maren alone with the cold. [18] She pulled her coat tighter and began the climb toward the lighthouse, where the dawn was just beginning to bleed pale yellow across the horizon. [40] The wind met her halfway up the path, carrying with it the sound of chimes — dozens of them, hung from the gallery railing in overlapping curtains of copper and glass. [65]

Maren was a conscience for hire. [71] That was the polite way to say it. [79] People paid her to sit across from them and tell them whether they were wrong, and she was very good at making them believe she cared about the answer. [107] Sincerely insincere — that was how her last client had described her, right before writing the check. [124] She'd smiled at that, the way she smiled at everything, with just enough warmth to seem real. [141]

But something had shifted in her on the drive out here. [152] The woman who'd contacted her, Petra, hadn't asked Maren to validate or condemn. [165] She'd asked Maren to help her doubt. [172] "I've been too certain about everything my whole life," Petra had written. [183] "I need someone to teach me how to not know." [193]

The lighthouse door was already open. [199] Inside, the spiral stairs were lit by a single lamp, and the chimes grew louder as Maren ascended. [217] She found Petra on the gallery, wrapped in a gray shawl, unhooking a wind chime from the railing with careful, deliberate fingers. [238]

"You're late," Petra said, without turning. [244]

"The fire took longer to die than I expected." [253]

Petra held the chime up to the light — five tubes of hammered brass, each a different length. [270] "Do you know how I've spent the last three years?" [280] She hung it on a different hook, lower, where the wind caught it at a new angle. [296] "Deciphering wind chime selections. [300] Each arrangement produces a different pattern of sound. [308] I've been cataloging them, trying to find the one that resolves into something perfect." [322]

"And?" [323]

"There isn't one. [326] Every time I think I've found it, the wind changes." [336] Petra turned, and her face was open in a way Maren rarely saw in clients — not desperate, not guilty, just searching. [357] "That's why I called you. [362] I don't need someone to tell me I'm right or wrong. [373] I need someone to help me wear the cloak of doubt without suffocating under it." [387]

Maren felt the phrase land somewhere beneath her ribs. [396] She reached into her pocket and found the hollow mirror shard she'd been carrying for six months, a broken piece from her own bathroom mirror, the night she'd punched it after telling a client exactly what he'd wanted to hear and watching him destroy his marriage with her permission. [441] The shard was concave, and when she looked into it, her reflection was distorted — stretched, fragmented, never quite whole. [460]

She held it out to Petra. [466]

"What's this?" [468]

"Proof that I don't know what I'm doing either." [477] The words came out before Maren could shape them into something professional, and she felt exposed in a way that frightened her. [496] But the lighthouse walls were thick, and the wind chimes filled every silence, and somehow it felt safe enough to be unguarded. [519] Protected vulnerability — that was the only way she could describe it later, the feeling of standing in a place built to withstand storms while choosing to leave the door open. [548]

Petra took the shard and turned it in the dawn light. [559] "You keep this?" [562]

"To remind myself that the reflection I sell people isn't real." [572]

Petra nodded slowly, then hung the shard on a thin wire beside the chimes. [586] The wind caught it, spinning it so it threw fractured light across the lighthouse walls in patterns that shifted and refused to repeat. [608]

"Stay for the morning," Petra said. [614] "Not as my conscience. [618] Just as someone who also doesn't know." [625]

Maren watched the light move across the stone, listened to the chimes rearranging themselves with every gust, and for the first time in years, she didn't reach for an answer. [656] She let the not-knowing settle over her shoulders like something she could finally choose to wear. [672] The dawn widened. [675] The chimes played their imperfect music. [681] And two women who had built their lives around certainty — one by selling it, one by hoarding it — stood together in the wind and practiced the difficult, necessary art of doubt. [712]
