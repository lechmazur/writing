The turbines turned above the farmhouse like slow, white gods counting the seconds since joy became law. [18]

Maren sat on the porch step and whittled a piece of pine into nothing in particular, her knife peeling curls of wood that the wind carried toward the fields. [47] She did not smile, because smiling was mandatory now, and the muscles in her face had learned a new discipline: perfect blankness. [68] Under the Happiness Mandate, all public expressions of grief had been reclassified as social contagion. [81] Fines came first, then counselors, then the performers — reassigned citizens trained to demonstrate appropriate emotional presentation in rural zones where compliance lagged. [101]

Maren was one of these performers. [107] Her face was a clean page. [113] Not happy, not sad — blank, which was the only form of resistance the mandate had failed to legislate against. [131]

She held up the whittled stick and examined it, turning it in the gray light. [145] "And now," she said to no one, her voice carrying the exaggerated gravity of a stage narrator, "the performer inspects the shapeless wood, searching for meaning in its grain, finding nothing, which is exactly the correct amount." [180] This was her method — dramatically narrating the mundane tasks of her day, as though every small action were an act in an epic no audience had requested. [207] It had started as a training exercise at the reassignment facility, a way to fill silence without expressing anything real. [224] But here, alone on the farm her dead sister had left her, the narration had become something else. [239] A way to move through rooms that still smelled like Petra. [249] A way to cultivate lightness in grief, to make the unbearable into theater, and theater into something almost bearable. [266]

On the kitchen table inside, a dried flower bouquet stood in a mason jar. [279] Petra had arranged it the autumn before she died — yarrow and lavender and something wild and purple that Maren had never identified. [299] The mandate counselors had flagged it during their home inspection. [309] Memorials to the deceased were categorized as grief artifacts. [318] Maren had told them it was decorative. [325] They had written something on their tablets and left, and the bouquet remained, brittle and fading, holding its shape the way Maren held hers. [347]

She went inside and stood before it. [354] "The performer enters the kitchen," she narrated, "and beholds the artifact of a woman who once believed flowers could be kept." [373] Her voice did not waver. [378] Her face did not move. [383] This was the remade hush — not the original silence of a house where someone has died, but the second silence, the one constructed after the government tried to fill the first with enforced laughter and compulsory optimism seminars. [416] The hush that grew back thicker, quieter, more morally ambiguous than simple sadness. [428]

Because Maren knew: her blankness unnerved the inspectors more than tears would have. [440] She knew it and she used it. [447] She was not innocent in this. [453] She performed compliance so perfectly that it became its own subversion, and she could not always tell where obedience ended and sabotage began. [474] That uncertainty lived in her the way the turbines lived above the farmhouse — massive, humming, casting shadows that moved across the walls in slow rotation, never quite the same pattern twice. [503]

She picked up the knife again and resumed whittling, this time carving a small, rough shape. [518] A petal. [520] Then another. [522] She worked in silence for a while, letting the narration rest, which was its own kind of drama. [538] The turbines thrummed. [541] A blade of shadow swept across the porch. [549]

"The performer," she finally said, "adds a wooden flower to the bouquet, because the real ones are disintegrating, and because making a thing is the opposite of losing a thing, even when you know both end the same way." [585]

She placed the rough carving among the dried stems. [594] It did not match. [598] It was clumsy and pale against the papery browns and faded purples. [610] But it stood upright, which was more than enough. [619]

Outside, the turbines turned. [623] Inside, the hush held. [627] Maren's face remained blank, which was not the same as empty, in the same way that a field lying fallow is not the same as a field that has never been planted. [658] She picked up the knife. [663] She began another petal. [667] She did not narrate this one. [673] Some things, even in a world that mandated happiness, were allowed to happen in silence — not because the law permitted it, but because the silence was already there, remade and waiting, and no legislation on earth could fill what it chose to hold open.
