She had been climbing for as long as memory allowed, which was either forever or not at all. [17]

The infinite staircase had no beginning she could recall and no end anyone had promised, yet Maren kept ascending with the steady rhythm of someone who believed the next landing would matter. [49] That was her particular affliction: she could see the grim architecture of hopelessness clearly, name every reason to stop, and still choose the next step. [73] A grim optimist, her mother had once called her, back when mothers and ground floors existed. [88]

In her left pocket she carried a pair of dice, one chipped at the corner where the six met the five, so it always favored outcomes that shouldn't exist. [117] She'd stolen them from a probability lecture she'd attended in another life, a lecture she'd walked out of seventeen minutes early because a boy with dark eyes had smiled at her from the hallway and she'd chosen the stairs instead. [155] That was the missed opportunity she kept trying to capture, not the boy himself but the texture of the moment, the exact weight of a door swinging shut behind her while possibility collapsed into a single irreversible direction. [190]

The staircase twisted upward in a helix that obeyed no architectural law. [202] Landings appeared at irregular intervals, each one a small platform where equations were carved into the stone like graffiti left by previous climbers. [222] Maren had started reading them around the ten-thousandth step. [231] By the hundred-thousandth, she'd begun adding her own. [239]

Her method was mathematical proof, the only language precise enough to describe what the staircase was doing to time and space. [259] She had filled nine landings with lemmas about perpetual motion, arguing through formal logic that a system could sustain infinite ascent only if the energy lost per step was returned through the geometry of the staircase itself. [296] If true, the structure wasn't merely infinite; it was self-sustaining, a closed loop disguised as a line. [313] Boundless confinement. [315] She was free to climb forever and imprisoned by exactly that freedom. [326]

On the landing she now reached, something was different. [335] The carved equation was incomplete, broken off mid-derivation as though the previous climber had been interrupted or had given up. [353] Maren knelt and traced the symbols with her fingertip. [362] The proof attempted to show that perpetual motion could be ruptured, that a single discontinuity introduced into the system would cause the staircase to fold, collapsing infinite steps into a finite distance. [393]

Her heart beat faster, not with certainty but with the balancedly daring hope of someone who understood both the promise and the cost. [415] She pulled the dice from her pocket and turned them in her palm. [427] The chipped one caught the pale light that came from nowhere and everywhere. [439] She had always believed randomness was the universe's signature on things it hadn't finished deciding. [452]

She rolled the dice onto the stone. [458] The unchipped die landed on four. [464] The chipped die wobbled, teetered on its damaged corner, and settled on a face that shouldn't have existed: a blank, smooth surface where no pips had ever been carved. [493] Zero. [494]

Maren stared at it and understood. [500] The discontinuity the previous climber had sought wasn't a number but the absence of one, a rupture in the expected set. [519] She picked up her chalk and completed the proof in eleven lines, each one building on the impossibility the chipped die had made manifest. [541] A zero in a system that only recognized one through six. [551] Division by nothing. [554] The architecture shuddered. [557]

Below her, steps began folding like pages of a book being closed. [569] Above her, the helix contracted, landings rushing toward each other, equations overlapping into palimpsest. [581] She felt the texture she had been chasing for all those endless steps: the precise sensation of a door swinging shut, but this time she was on the side she'd chosen rather than the side she'd defaulted to. [614]

The staircase compressed into a single step. [621] Maren stood on it, breathless, the dice still warm in her hand, the chipped one still showing its impossible face. [639] Around her, the world reconstituted itself into something that was neither up nor down, neither bounded nor free, but finally, mercifully, still. [660]

She pocketed the dice and stepped forward into the quiet that waits on the other side of forever. [677]

Behind her, the last equation glowed faintly on stone that was already forgetting it had ever been a staircase. [695]

She did not look back. [700] A grim optimist never does. [705]
