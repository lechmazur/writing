The rain arrived again at half past four, beading across the skylight in constellations that Moira Vell had learned to read almost as fluently as her cards. [27] She sat cross-legged on the loft floor beneath that wide pane of glass, surrounded by a mandala of hand-drawn tarot arranged on butcher paper, every sigil and border rendered in the onyx ink her grandmother had formulated from lamp-black and oak gall decades before Moira was born. [68] The ink had outlasted the woman, and the woman's secrets had outlasted common sense, and now Moira — steadily curious since childhood, incapable of leaving a question unturned — was using both to reverse engineer something no algorithm had managed to predict. [104]

Six months after the cryptocurrency crashes hollowed out the digital economy, people were still mapping the damage in dollars. [121] Moira mapped it in archetypes. [125] She believed the collapse was not a failure of code but a failure of myth — that millions had poured faith into decentralized ledgers because of a cultural pattern older than currency itself, a pattern her grandmother's notebooks called the Spiral of Borrowed Certainty. [163] She wanted to find that spiral's geometry, to chart the invisible folklore that made rational people behave like pilgrims. [181]

Her method was physical, almost archaeological. [187] She pulled the yellow measuring tape from its spool and stretched it between The Tower and The Fool, marking the distance in centimeters on the butcher paper, then did the same from The Fool to the Ten of Pentacles reversed. [220] Each measurement represented an interval of collective sentiment she had cataloged from forum posts, congressional transcripts, and suicide notes published in the aftermath. [241] By multiplying paths — forking each card's possible meaning into three or four interpretive branches and tracing every combination outward — she generated a web so dense it resembled a root system spreading across her floor. [274] The measuring tape gave the web proportion; the cards gave it language. [285]

She had been at this for eleven weeks, sleeping on the daybed pushed against the brick wall, eating from cans, speaking to almost no one. [308] The loft still smelled like her grandmother's turpentine, still held the ghost-impressions of old canvases against the exposed beams. [327] Moira had inherited the space and, with it, the conviction that symbol systems were not decorations laid over reality but the scaffolding inside it. [349] That conviction felt less eccentric now that an entire asset class had evaporated because enough people stopped believing in it simultaneously. [368]

The buzzer rang. [371] She crossed to the intercom and let Davi up without asking why he had come, because she already knew. [391] He was a data journalist, the one who had first published the internal communications from three collapsed exchanges, and for months he had been circling her work with skepticism that was slowly losing its teeth. [424]

He stood dripping in her doorway, staring at the floor mandala. [434] "You've expanded it." [437]

"The pattern demanded it." [441] She knelt and traced a line of tape from the Seven of Cups to a cluster of cards she had titled Consensus Hallucination. [461] "Every branch I follow multiplies into new branches. [469] But they converge here." [473] Her finger rested on The Empress, which she had drawn with her grandmother's onyx ink just that morning, the figure's face left deliberately blank. [495]

"What does convergence mean in your system?" [502]

"It means the culture wanted to be deceived in a very specific shape. [514] The shape of abundance without labor. [520] My grandmother mapped a version of it in the dot-com letters she collected in 2001." [534] Moira paused, then did something she had not done in the eleven weeks of solitary work: she decided to confide. [554] "I think the pattern recurs every generation, wearing new clothes. [563] Tulips, railways, dot-coms, crypto. [568] The spiral tightens each time. [573] I think the next turn is already forming, and I think I can see where." [586]

Davi crouched beside her, rain still running from his jacket onto the paper's edge, blurring one faint pencil line. [604] He studied the web of tape and ink as though it might suddenly resolve into something his journalism could hold. [621] "Show me," he said quietly. [626]

Above them, rain braided fresh patterns across the skylight, and Moira reached for the measuring tape, and the onyx ink, and the unfinished Empress, and began again from the convergence point outward — multiplying paths into the dark geometry of whatever borrowed certainty would come next. [670]

The loft held its breath the way inherited rooms always do: full of questions left by the dead, answered slowly by the living. [694]
