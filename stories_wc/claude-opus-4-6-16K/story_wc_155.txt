The fog had owned the orchard district for three hundred years, rolling through the skeletal apple trees and collapsed stone walls like a living thing that fed on forgetting. [30] Nobody came here anymore, which was precisely why Luma did. [40]

She was a mural artist, though that term felt too small for what she actually practiced. [54] Luma painted with light — not metaphorically, not romantically, but literally, using salvaged projectors and hand-ground phosphorescent pigments that she mixed with egg tempera in the old way. [80] Her murals breathed. [83] They shifted with the angle of the viewer, glowed at dusk, and faded by morning like dreams refusing to be pinned down. [101] Critics in the city called her work "exposed film made architectural," and she liked that, the idea that her walls were sensitive surfaces waiting to be struck by the right luminance. [131]

But she hadn't painted in seven months. [138] Joy had left her the way fog leaves a valley — slowly, then all at once — and she'd come to the ruined orchard district to find where it had gone. [167]

The fog this morning was thick enough to taste, mineral and sweet, like licking a wet stone. [183] Luma moved through it with her hands slightly extended, fingertips brushing bark and crumbled mortar. [196] The old district had once been a commune of painters, glassblowers, and fresco artists who had built their workshops among the orchards, embedding art into every available surface before the fog swallowed the neighborhood from public memory. [230] She knew this from the knowledge network — a vast, collaboratively maintained archive of lost urban histories that obsessive cartographers and amateur historians fed like a furnace, uploading scanned diaries, satellite overlays, oral recordings. [259] One entry had mentioned a workshop here with frescoes depicting orchards in bloom, painted by a collective that believed beauty was a civic duty. [282] That phrase had snagged in Luma's chest like a fishhook. [292]

She found the workshop by stumbling into its doorframe. [301] The roof had caved in decades ago, and fog pooled inside the walls like milk in a bowl. [318] Luma switched on her flashlight and swept the beam across the interior. [330]

There — on the far wall, half-buried under ivy and calcium deposits — a fresco fragment survived. [345] It showed a single apple tree in full, impossible blossom, pink and white petals rendered with a tenderness that made Luma's throat tighten. [365] The rest of the mural was destroyed, eaten by moisture and time, but this fragment persisted like a stubbornly remembered word from a forgotten song. [389]

She sat on a pile of rubble and stared at it. [400] The fog drifted through the roofless space, and the flashlight beam caught the suspended droplets, turning them into a field of tiny, hovering lenses. [424] Light scattered. [426] The fresco seemed to pulse. [430]

Within the fold of a daydream — that liminal state where she wasn't quite thinking and wasn't quite not — Luma saw it. [450] She saw the whole mural as it must have been: orchard after orchard cascading across every wall, branches interlocking, fruit heavy with color, figures moving beneath the canopy laughing at something she couldn't hear. [481] The vision was so vivid it felt less like imagination and more like the room remembering itself through her. [498]

She laughed, and the sound startled her. [505] It was a small, pensive laugh, almost a question. [514] When had she last laughed? [519]

Luma stood. [521] She pulled her portable projector from her pack, the small one she carried everywhere like a talisman, and aimed it at the wall beside the surviving fragment. [546] She began to paint with light, projecting color onto the damp stone, tracing the shapes her daydream had shown her. [565] Petals first, then branches, then the suggestion of figures in joyful motion. [576] The fog caught the projected light and scattered it further, so the images didn't just display on the wall — they floated in the air itself, filling the ruined room with a ghostly, luminous orchard. [607]

It wouldn't last. [610] By tomorrow the projector battery would die, the fog would shift, and the light-painted orchard would vanish as thoroughly as the original. [630] But the fresco fragment would remain, and now the knowledge network would carry Luma's coordinates, her photographs, her documentation, so that someone else might stumble here and feel what she felt. [661]

Joy, she realized, was not something you could hoard in a jar. [673] It was exposed film — it needed light to reveal what it carried, and it needed to be shared before it meant anything at all. [696]

She stood in her glowing, temporary orchard, fog weaving between the projected blossoms, and felt the old delight return — not roaring, but quiet, like a tree deciding, after a long winter, to bloom. [730]
