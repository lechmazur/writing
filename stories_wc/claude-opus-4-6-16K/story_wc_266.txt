The leash broke on a Tuesday, though Maren would not remember which one. [14]

She had been walking the old dog along the cliff path when the leather snapped and he bolted into the fog, and she stood there holding the frayed end like a question she could not finish asking. [49] The dog did not come back. [55] Nothing came back from the ridgeway once the mist took it. [66]

That was when the ferry guides found her. [74]

They emerged from the veiled ridgeway as though the fog itself had decided to take shape and speak kindly. [93] There were two of them, a woman with silver braids coiled like rope and a man whose beard moved in wind that touched nothing else. [116] They wore oilskin coats the color of wet stone, and each carried a lantern that burned the soft amber of a sun already beneath the horizon. [141]

"You're holding on to something that isn't holding you," the woman said, nodding at the broken leash. [158]

Maren looked down at her hand. [164] Her knuckles were white. [169] She let go. [173]

"Where does this path lead?" she asked, because the ridgeway stretched in both directions and she could see neither end. [193]

"Where unused courage waits," the man said, as though this were a station on a schedule he had memorized long ago. [214]

They did not explain further. [219] Wise guides seldom do. [224] Instead, the woman produced a ticket punch from her coat pocket, its handle worn smooth by a thousand hands, and at its mouth a small star-shaped die glinted. [251] She reached forward and punched a hole through the fog itself, or so it seemed, and where the star stamp cut, a faint light appeared in the mist like a window in a wall Maren had not known was there. [293]

"We traverse," the man said simply. [299]

They walked. [301]

The ridgeway did not permit straight lines. [308] Its spine curved and doubled, switchbacking through heather and limestone outcrops that rose like the vertebrae of something ancient and sleeping. [327] The guides led Maren through indirect routes, around standing stones and along sheep trails that spiraled inward before releasing travelers further than expected. [349] Each time the path seemed to end, the woman punched another star into the veil, and each time the passage opened again, gently persistent, the way water finds its way through rock not by force but by patience. [386]

Twilight held. [388] It neither deepened into night nor brightened toward dawn, as though the sky had agreed to pause and keep vigil alongside them. [408] Maren understood slowly that this was the nature of the place: a vigil in twilight, an hour that did not pass because it was not meant to be passed through but inhabited. [440]

"I wasn't brave with him," Maren said after a long silence. [451] She meant the dog, but she also meant her father, and the woman she had loved at twenty-three, and the version of herself that had once stood at the edge of open water and decided not to swim. [488] "I kept everything on a leash. [494] Including myself." [496]

The man's lantern swayed. [500] "Courage doesn't vanish when you don't use it," he said. [511] "It just goes somewhere to wait." [517]

The ridgeway crested. [520] Below, Maren saw it: a shoreline where the mist thinned and the water moved in a rhythm so slow and so soft it sounded like a lullaby sung by someone who had already fallen asleep. [554] The waves carried small lights, each one star-shaped, each one a hole punched through some private fog by someone who had also walked this path and finally let go of the frayed thing in their hand. [590]

The woman punched one last star into the air before Maren's chest, and Maren felt it open something inside her that had been closed so long she had forgotten it was a door. [623]

"You don't need us from here," the woman said. [632]

Maren stepped forward. [635] The heather gave way to sand, and the sand gave way to water, and the water was warm. [653] She waded in up to her knees and stood there in the twilight that would not end, keeping vigil with the tide, letting the shoreline lullaby wash over her like forgiveness she had never thought to ask for. [693]

Somewhere behind her, the guides' lanterns dimmed and folded back into the fog. [706]

Somewhere ahead, the star-shaped lights drifted on. [714]

She breathed in. [717] She breathed out. [721] The leash was broken and she was free and the courage had been here all along, waiting at the edge of the water, patient as stone, gentle as light, hers. [752]
