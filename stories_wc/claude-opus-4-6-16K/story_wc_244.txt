The ivy had eaten the railway station so thoroughly that newcomers sometimes mistook it for a hill. [18] Platform Three, where the 7:15 to Marseille once departed, now served as a communal kitchen for whoever wandered in, which was the way Marta preferred things. [43] She had spent eleven years as a disaster-relief logistician, routing water purifiers to flood zones and antibiotics to earthquake rubble, always arriving after the worst and leaving before the thanks. [70] People called her elusive, and she accepted the word like a compliment she hadn't earned. [84]

Now she lived in the old stationmaster's office, its roof half-open to weather, its walls furred green. [99] She told anyone who asked that she was retired. [108] She told herself she was hiding. [114] The truth, which she guarded with desperately jocular deflections, was that she had grown so efficient at caring for strangers in bulk that she had forgotten how to care for one person at a time, including herself. [147]

The fragment of moon rock arrived on a Tuesday, wrapped in a Marseille newspaper and tucked inside a biscuit tin left on the ticket counter. [172] No return address. [175] Just a handwritten note: "You helped my village in Sulawesi. [185] This is the most valuable thing I own. [193] Please keep it until you need something of equal weight returned." [203]

Marta turned the grey pebble in her fingers. [211] It was lighter than it looked, porous, certified by a faded NASA authentication card. [224] She laughed, loudly enough to startle the pigeons nesting in the departures board. [236] Someone had sent her a piece of another world and asked for reciprocity she had never agreed to. [253]

She pinned the note to the wall beside thirty-seven other notes she had collected over the years, messages from people she had supplied with tarpaulins and oral rehydration salts, people who kept finding her through improbable rumor chains that threaded from relief camps to diaspora cafes to, apparently, a disused railway station in southern France. [308] Each note offered something: a prayer, a名recipe, a名debt. [318] Each note bound her to a person she could not see. [328]

She had always found the binding uncomfortable, like a shoe one size too small. [342] Reciprocity implied relationship, and relationship implied presence, and presence was the one logistics problem she could not solve from a spreadsheet. [362]

But the moon rock was different. [368] It was absurd. [371] It was a cosmic joke delivered by postal service, and it sat on her desk glowing faintly in the afternoon light like a dare. [394]

That evening, she did something unprecedented: she wrote back. [403] She addressed the letter to the name on the note, care of a relief organization she used to coordinate with, trusting the same improbable rumor chain to carry it home. [432] She wrote that the moon rock was beautiful and ridiculous and that she would hold it until something of equal weight presented itself. [453] She added, in a postscript she almost crossed out, that the station had good light and anyone was welcome. [470]

The letter was the catalyst. [475] Within weeks, two of the other note-writers responded to her responses. [486] A woman from Palu sent dried cloves. [493] A man from Port-au-Prince sent a drawing of his daughter. [503] Marta replied to each, politely anarchic in her refusal to follow any protocol of charity or gratitude, insisting instead on simple exchange. [523] She sent seeds from the ivy. [529] She sent photographs of the pigeons. [535] She sent terrible puns translated into three languages, desperately jocular, because humor was the only currency she trusted herself to spend. [554]

By autumn, four people had visited. [560] They slept on the platform, cooked in the communal kitchen, and left things behind: a knitted scarf, a tin whistle, a jar of pickled mango. [584] The station filled with objects that were not supplies, not inventory, not line items in a logistics chain, but gifts. [603]

Marta understood then that the story had changed. [611] She was no longer the logistician who arrived after disaster and left before connection. [623] She was the woman in the ivy station who kept a piece of the moon on her desk and answered every letter. [643] The cure for loneliness, she realized, was not finding one person to love but allowing the web of small reciprocities to hold her weight, the way ivy held the station, tendril by tendril, until the structure underneath was no longer crumbling but cradled. [688]

She picked up the moon rock, kissed it once for luck, and set it on the windowsill where visitors could see it from the overgrown tracks. [715] A lighthouse made of borrowed light, calling no one in particular and everyone at once. [730]
