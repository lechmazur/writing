She had been chronicling tidal pools for eleven years, and in that time Maren had learned that the most important things happened in the spaces between. [27]

Between tides, between seasons, between one breath of the sea and the next -- that was where the real transformations occurred. [46] She called these the transition periods, and she had filled seventeen notebooks with her warmly observant descriptions of what lived and died and changed in those liminal hours. [72] The hermit crab migrating from one shell to another. [81] The anemone closing as water retreated, opening as it returned. [90] The barnacle deciding, in one irrevocable moment, where it would anchor for the rest of its life. [107]

Now she sat in the ancient grotto beneath the cliffs of Haeun-do, where the ceiling opened in a jagged wound to reveal stars, and across from her sat the man she had not spoken to in six years. [143]

Her father held a jade cicada in his palm, turning it slowly. [155] It had belonged to her mother. [161] The jade was dark green, almost black in the low light, carved so finely that the wing veins caught starlight through the grotto's opening above. [186] Cicadas meant resurrection in her mother's tradition -- the creature that buries itself in earth for years, then emerges transformed. [204]

He had just said something terrible and true: that her mother had asked to be cremated here, in this grotto, where the tidal pools reflected constellations at low tide, and that he had honored the request without telling Maren. [240]

The pause that followed was not silence. [247] Water dripped from limestone. [251] A pool near their feet shifted as something small moved beneath its surface. [263] Maren watched a blenny dart between rocks, its body a flicker of purpose in the dark water, and she understood that this pause was itself a transition period -- the space between knowing and responding, where everything could change depending on what emerged. [304]

She wanted to be angry. [309] She had rehearsed anger for years, carrying it like a stone in her chest. [323] But anger was a direct approach, and Maren had learned through tangential approach that the truth of things revealed itself sideways, the way you saw a faint star better by looking slightly away from it. [358]

So instead of speaking about her mother's ashes, she spoke about the tidal pools. [372]

"Do you know what I've been trying to discover all these years?" she asked. [385] Her voice was steady, curious, the voice she used when she narrated her observations into a recorder at dawn. [402] "I've been trying to discover the texture of time. [411] How it feels different in a tidal pool than anywhere else. [422] How an hour at low tide is thick and slow, full of exposure and risk, and an hour at high tide is fast and covering and forgiving." [446]

Her father looked at her. [451] His fingers stilled on the jade cicada. [458]

"Mom understood that," Maren continued. [463] "She chose this place because time moves differently here. [472] The water comes and goes and comes again, and nothing is ever really gone, it just changes form." [489]

She reached toward his hand, not for the cicada but for his wrist, and she felt his pulse -- another tide, another rhythm marking transition. [513]

"I can foresee what happens if I stay angry," she said quietly. [524] "I've watched enough pools to know. [530] The ones that stay cut off from the ocean grow stagnant. [540] The ones that stay connected survive." [546]

He exhaled, a sound like a wave retreating over gravel. [556] Then he placed the jade cicada in her palm. [565] It was warm from his holding. [571] She closed her fingers around it and felt the delicate ridges of its wings, each vein a tiny channel, like the grooves water carved through this grotto over millennia. [597]

Above them, stars turned in their ancient transit. [605] Below, a tidal pool caught Vega's light and held it, trembling. [616] The tide was coming in -- she could hear it building at the grotto's mouth, that gathering sound that meant the water would soon rush through and fill every empty basin, connecting each isolated pool back into one continuous, breathing sea. [656]

Her father said, "She loved watching you work." [665]

Maren nodded, and the pause between them ended, and what emerged from it was not the anger she had buried for six years but something older and stranger, something with wings. [695] She tucked the jade cicada into her coat pocket, close to her heart, where it rested like a small, patient resurrection waiting for its season. [720]

The first wave entered the grotto, and the pools began to merge. [732]
