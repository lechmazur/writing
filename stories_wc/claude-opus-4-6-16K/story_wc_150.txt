The first time Adaeze descended into the catacomb orchard, she did not expect to find fruit. [16]

She had returned to Igboland after twenty-three years in Manchester, carrying two suitcases and a hollowness she could not name. [35] Her mother had called it "the forgetting sickness," the way diaspora children lose the texture of home until faith becomes a word without weight. [54] Adaeze had not prayed to any god in a decade. [63] She had not felt the need to, until the emptiness grew teeth. [74]

The archaeological team welcomed her with polite confusion. [82] She was a structural engineer, not an archaeologist, but the university had needed someone who understood load-bearing walls and the risk of collapse, someone who could help them rebuild the compromised tunnels without disturbing what slept inside. [113] The tomb they were excavating belonged to a dibia, a healer-priest from perhaps the seventeenth century, buried in a network of catacombs that had since been colonized by an orchard above. [143] Fig and breadfruit roots had grown downward through generations of soil and bone, weaving between skulls and femurs like pale fingers threading through dark hair. [168] The roots held everything together now. [174] Remove them, and the dead would finally fall apart. [183]

Adaeze moved through the tunnels with a lantern and a notebook, mapping stress points. [196] She was warmly curious in a way that unsettled her colleagues, pausing to touch the roots, pressing her palm against the cool bark that had wrapped itself around a ribcage as though embracing it. [228] She asked the bones questions in her mind. [236] She did not expect answers, but the asking felt necessary. [246]

On the fourth day, she found the sundial base. [255]

It sat half-buried in a chamber where three roots converged into a knotted column, their tendrils cradling a stone disc carved with Nsibidi symbols. [278] The gnomon was missing, but the base remained, its face still legible beneath centuries of mineral deposit. [294] She recognized the symbols from her grandmother's stories: the spiral for journey, the crossed lines for interruption, the open eye for return. [314]

"Journey interrupted," she murmured, tracing the spiral with her thumb. [324] "Journey resumed." [326]

She began to wander the tunnels purposefully after that, not following the team's grid but moving by instinct, letting the roots guide her through passages that bent and branched like sentences in a language she was relearning. [362] Through purposeful wandering she found secondary chambers, ventilation shafts disguised as tree hollows, and offerings left in niches: kola nuts turned to stone, clay pots still holding the ghost-shape of water. [393] Each discovery was a syllable. [397] She was reading the tomb the way her grandmother had read the forest, with her feet. [413]

The interrupted journeys were everywhere once she knew how to look. [424] The dibia's burial path had been redirected by root growth, his bones shifted from their original position into a new arrangement that was neither decay nor design but something in between. [453] A child's skeleton nearby had been mid-burial when some catastrophe halted the ritual; the bones were only half-anointed with red camwood. [474] Even the roots themselves had been interrupted, split by stone and rerouted, yet they had found their way down regardless. [493]

Adaeze understood. [495] Every journey here had been broken. [501] Every journey had continued anyway. [506]

She began to rebuild. [510] Not the tunnels alone, though she reinforced the weakest arches with timber frames that mimicked the roots' organic geometry. [528] She rebuilt the sundial base into a centerpiece for the main chamber, setting it on a cleared pedestal where a shaft of light fell through a root-choked opening at noon. [559] Without a gnomon, the dial could not cast a proper shadow, but the light moved across the Nsibidi symbols like a slow hand reading scripture. [583]

On the last day of excavation, she sat beside the sundial base and watched that light crawl across the symbol for return. [604] The roots breathed around her with the patience of centuries. [614] The bones rested in their tangled cradle, undisturbed by her work, held by the same trees that fed the living above. [635]

She did not pray, exactly. [640] But she placed a fresh kola nut in the niche beside the dibia's skull, and she spoke to him in Igbo so broken it might have been a new dialect entirely. [669] She told him she had come home. [676] She told him she had forgotten the way, and that forgetting was its own kind of burial, and that she was tired of being half-anointed. [700]

The roots shifted faintly in a breeze from above, and fruit-light dappled the walls, and Adaeze felt something cautious and enchanted stir in the place where faith had been. [730]

It was not restoration. [734] Not yet. [736] It was the first green thread of a root finding its way back down through the dark, interrupted and reaching still. [755]
