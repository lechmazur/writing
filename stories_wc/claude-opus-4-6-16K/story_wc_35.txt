The rain had stopped an hour ago, but the desert fortress still wept from every stone. [17] Water traced the cracks in sandstone walls like tears following old scars, pooling in the courtyard where Maren stood with her hands buried in a bowl of salt. [43] She was a chef who could taste memories, and today every grain of salt carried someone else's grief. [59]

The fortress had been a military outpost once, then a monastery, then nothing at all until Maren claimed it as her kitchen. [80] She cooked for travelers crossing the dune sea, and they paid not in coin but in conversation, which she could taste on every dish she prepared for them. [108] A broth seasoned with cumin would bloom on her tongue with the flavor of a stranger's first heartbreak. [126] Roasted lamb might carry the metallic bite of a father's disappointment. [136] She had learned to read these flavors the way astronomers read stars, mapping the constellations of human regret. [153]

But she could not cook away her own. [160]

Beneath the dunes east of the fortress, accessible only after rain when the sand compacted and revealed a narrow staircase, lay the coral icebound pavilion. [185] It should not have existed in a desert, yet there it was: a structure of pale coral frozen in ancient ice that never melted, its arched ceiling glittering with frost even as the world above baked. [219] Maren had discovered it three years ago and understood immediately what it was. [231] A reliquary for stored remorse. [236]

The pavilion's floor held shallow depressions that filled with meltwater and sand, forming tidal pool formations that shifted with each rainfall. [254] Maren had spent months analyzing tidal pool formations, reading the spiral patterns of sediment and ice the way she read flavor in food. [276] Each pool contained a crystallized memory of regret left by someone who had come before, someone desperate enough to descend beneath the dunes and press their palms to the frozen coral. [305]

She was emotionally contagious through touch. [311] Whatever she held, she absorbed. [316] Whatever she absorbed, she tasted. [321] This was both her gift and her affliction, and it was why she had come to the pavilion tonight, at the close of an unspoken dream she'd carried for years: that she might finally sandpaper rough memories into something smooth enough to swallow. [362]

The memory she wanted to smooth was her daughter's face. [372] Not the living face but the last one, still and gray, in a hospital room Maren had arrived at seven minutes too late. [394] Seven minutes she had spent plating a dish for a stranger. [405] The remorse had hardened inside her like coral, sharp and branching, cutting her from the inside whenever she breathed too deeply. [424]

She knelt at the largest pool and pressed both hands to its surface. [436] The cold seized her instantly. [441] Flavors erupted across her tongue: the bitterness of a soldier's cowardice, the sour tang of a mother's neglect, the ashen taste of promises forgotten. [464] The pavilion held centuries of stored remorse, and it surged through her skin, threatening to subsume her entirely. [481]

She let it come. [485] That was the method she had devised through her months of study. [497] She would not resist the flood of borrowed grief. [506] She would let it pour through her, a thousand strangers' worst moments layering over her own, until her singular sharp-edged memory became one thread in a vast and heavy tapestry. [537] Not erased. [539] Sanded down. [541] Made bearable by company. [545]

The cold climbed her arms and reached her chest. [554] She tasted her daughter's last breath, and it mingled with the breath of every lost child held in the coral's memory. [574] The flavor changed. [577] It was still bitter, still heavy, but it was no longer solitary. [589] Something sturdy formed around the brittle core of her grief, a shell of shared sorrow that would not shatter under the weight of ordinary days. [613]

Maren withdrew her hands. [617] The ice refroze over the pool, trapping her remorse alongside the others, a new spiral in the sediment for the next reader to find. [641] She climbed the stairs on unsteady legs, emerging into a desert washed clean by rain, the fortress waiting with its weeping walls and its kitchen full of salt. [670]

She would cook tomorrow. [674] She would taste strangers' sorrows and season their meals with care, and the food would be honest because she understood now that grief was not a thing to cure but a thing to carry, and carrying was easier when the weight was shared. [714] The dream she had never spoken aloud settled quietly into the sand behind her, finally closed. [730]
