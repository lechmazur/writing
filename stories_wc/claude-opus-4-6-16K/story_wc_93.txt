The aurora painted itself across the sky like a dawn that did not belong to this hour, borrowed light cascading over the tidal bluff where Maren crouched among her painted rocks. [31]

She had been arranging them since the friction vanished. [40]

Three days ago, every surface in the world lost its grip. [51] Ships slid from harbors into open ocean, unable to stop. [61] People fell and kept sliding until they struck walls or were caught by those who had braced themselves against something bolted down. [83] The eels, though -- the eels thrived. [89] Without friction, water moved differently, and the great migratory columns of silver eels that Maren had spent her life herding through the coastal channels surged with unprecedented speed, spiraling into formations she had never witnessed. [121] They moved in patterns that reminded her of the sequences her grandmother had once traced in sand before the tide took them. [143]

Sacred patterns. [145] Maren had chased their meaning since she was nine years old, when her grandmother pressed a vial of collapsed star dust into her palm and whispered a promise: "When you understand the pattern, you'll finally be free of what you see." [182]

What Maren saw was the future, and it was a curse. [193] Not in flashes of glory or useful premonition, but in the relentless, unsorted debris of moments yet to come -- a stranger's sneeze next Thursday, the precise angle at which a roof tile would crack in six months, the last breath of someone she had not yet met. [233] The visions came without order, without mercy, without context. [242] She could not harness them. [247] They harnessed her, dragging her out of the present and into a churning sea of meaningless tomorrows. [263]

Her grandmother had been cursed the same way. [271] She had spent decades studying sacred geometries, convinced that if she could map the underlying pattern of time itself, the visions would resolve into coherence -- or cease entirely. [298] She died before finishing her work, and the promise lingered in Maren like a second heartbeat. [314]

Now Maren placed another painted rock into the sequence on the bluff's edge. [327] Each stone bore a symbol in pigment she had mixed with collapsed star dust from that same vial, the powder of a dead star ground so fine it shimmered like thought. [358] She arranged them in Fibonacci spirals, then prime-number grids, then arrangements that followed no mathematics she had names for but that felt correct the way a held breath feels correct before release. [391]

The aurora overhead shifted from green to violet. [399] The tidal waters below, frictionless now, rose and fell in perfect sinusoidal curves, lapping the bluff without any of the chaotic foam that friction once produced. [424] The eels moved beneath the surface in luminous ribbons, and Maren could see their formations mirroring her stone arrangements with eerie precision. [446]

She was close. [449]

A vision struck: herself, standing on this bluff, completing the final sequence. [461] But for once the vision carried context. [467] She could feel its position in time -- not scattered, not random, but placed. [479] It was minutes from now. [484]

Her hands trembled as she set the next stone. [493] The collapsed star dust in the pigment caught the aurora's borrowed dawn and threw it back in spectral filaments that connected stone to stone like a web. [521] The eels below surged upward, pressing against the water's surface, their bodies forming the same web from beneath. [540]

Maren understood then what her grandmother had been trying to tell her. [552] The sacred pattern was not a sequence to decode. [561] It was a relationship -- between observer and observed, between the stones she placed and the eels that moved, between the visions of the future and the actions of the present. [590] Friction had masked it. [594] The noise of resistance, of surfaces catching and dragging, had obscured the pure geometry underneath all things. [611]

She placed the final stone. [616]

The web of light between the painted rocks blazed and then softened into something steady, a glow like a dawn arriving exactly on time. [640] The visions did not stop, but they settled. [648] For the first time in her life, Maren saw the future not as a storm but as a tide -- rhythmic, navigable, patterned. [670] She could harness it now, ride it as she had always ridden the eel currents through the channels, reading the movement, adjusting, flowing. [692]

Below the bluff, her eels circled in a spiral that matched the final arrangement of stones, and Maren wept because the promise her grandmother had made was kept at last, not by answers but by the beautiful, terrible coherence of everything she had ever been afraid to see. [738]

The borrowed dawn held steady above the bluff, and Maren, the elusive eel herder who had spent her life sliding between channels and futures, finally stood still. [766]
