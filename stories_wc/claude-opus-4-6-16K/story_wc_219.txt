The tower had been washed clean by three days of rain, and now spring light moved across its stones like something remembering how to speak. [28]

Sera climbed the last flight of stairs with fly amber tucked in her coat pocket, the ancient resin warm against her ribs. [50] Inside the amber, a single insect had been suspended for forty million years, wings half-spread, caught in the act of leaving. [71] She had stolen it from the university's paleontology archive on the day she submitted her resignation letter, and she did not feel guilty. [93]

She was a luminous skeptic by nature -- the kind of person whose doubt shone so brightly it attracted others to her, moths mistaking her questioning for a lantern. [124] For eleven years she had taught xenolinguistics at the Institute, and for eleven years she had quietly refused to accept the canonical frameworks her colleagues treated as gospel. [150] Academically rebellious, they called her, as though rebellion were a phase she might outgrow. [164] But Sera had never outgrown anything; she only deepened. [173]

It had been nineteen days since first contact. [181]

The signal from Kepler-442b had arrived not as mathematics or music but as a set of coordinates -- geographical points on Earth's surface, plotted with impossible precision. [207] Twelve locations. [209] Twelve paths. [211] Each one leading to a structure that had stood, overlooked, for centuries. [221] The tower was the last coordinate on the list, and pilgrims had already begun to converge on the others. [239]

Sera refused the word "pilgrim." [244] She called them participants in an artificial pilgrimage, a term she had coined in her final, unpublished paper. [261] The signal, she argued, had not revealed sacred sites. [270] It had manufactured them. [274] By pointing at twelve unremarkable places, the alien intelligence had transformed them into destinations, grafting meaning onto stone the way amber grafts permanence onto a fly. [299]

And yet here she was, climbing. [305]

The sculpture path below the tower was overgrown with thistle and wild mint, its flagstones half-swallowed by moss. [322] Stone figures lined the way -- saints or scholars, their features eroded past recognition. [334] Dusty footprints marked the path where others had walked before her, dozens of them, their tracks drying in the spring air. [354] She had followed those footprints up the hill, letting them guide her via a trail she could have found on any map but somehow needed to feel beneath her feet. [383]

The motivation surprised her. [387] She had come, she told herself, to understand the chemistry of homecoming -- why a place one has never visited can feel like return. [409] The signal had not summoned her. [415] She did not believe in summons. [421] But she wanted to know what compound of memory, longing, and architecture produced the sensation now tightening her chest. [438]

At the top of the tower, a single room opened to the sky through a collapsed section of roof. [456] Rain had pooled in the depression of a stone basin, and the water held the sky's reflection with a bronze quiet that made her breath slow. [483] She sat on the wet ledge and took the fly amber from her pocket. [496]

She held it up to the light. [503] The insect inside had never completed its flight. [512] It had been caught between going and staying, and time had made that pause beautiful. [527]

Sera thought about the alien intelligence that had sent twelve coordinates across forty light-years of silence. [542] She thought about the others converging on the other eleven sites, strangers walking overgrown paths, leaving their own dusty footprints. [561] She thought about how none of them knew what they were looking for, and how that not-knowing was itself a kind of chemistry -- hydrogen and oxygen finding each other, becoming water, becoming the rain that washed the tower, becoming the pool that held the sky. [604]

She placed the amber on the stone basin's rim, where it caught the light and burned like a small, ancient sun. [624]

Homecoming, she decided, was not arrival. [630] It was the moment suspension ended -- the moment the fly's wings completed their stroke, even if only in the mind of the one holding the amber. [655] The aliens had not created sacred ground. [662] They had created the conditions for motion, for convergence, for the specific ache of walking toward something you cannot name. [680]

The tower stood quiet around her, bronze and spring-washed, and Sera -- the luminous skeptic who believed in nothing she could not test -- closed her eyes and felt, for the first time, home. [713]
