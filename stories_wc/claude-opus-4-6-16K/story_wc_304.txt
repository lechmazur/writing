She had always worked the threshold between beauty and death, and now Maren climbed toward the last place where that threshold still mattered. [26]

The skyborne grotto hung suspended in the upper atmosphere, a hollowed geode of crystalline ice tethered to nothing, luminous under the shifting aurora. [49] Green and violet light poured through translucent walls, casting the interior in colors that breathed. [63] Maren set down her case and knelt beside the body on the stone plinth. [77]

Her client — her final client — was the woman who had built this place. [92] Dr. Ilse Varn, atmospheric physicist, who had discovered how to grow crystal structures in the magnetosphere and who had, in her last lucid hours, requested that Maren prepare her here, above the world, beneath the lights she'd spent her life studying. [131]

Maren was a beautician mortician, the only licensed practitioner of both arts in the northern provinces. [148] People thought the combination was grotesque until they saw her work. [159] She could make the dead look not alive — that was a lie she refused to tell — but radiant, settled, complete. [179] She could make stillness look like a choice rather than a theft. [191]

She opened her case. [195] Brushes, pigments, setting powders, and one object she had never used before: an emerald chip the size of a fingernail, cut from a synthetic crystal Ilse herself had grown in the ionosphere. [227] Ilse's will had been specific. [232] Place it beneath my tongue, the letter read, so I carry one last spark of the aurora with me into oblivion. [252]

Maren held the chip up to the light. [260] Inside it, frozen in the lattice, tiny discharges flickered — actual captured particles from the solar wind, Ilse's life work made solid. [280] It pulsed faintly green, as though the aurora overhead recognized a piece of itself. [293]

She set it aside and began her work. [301]

The grotto was silent except for the hum of ionized air sliding along the outer walls, a sound like static on an old radio. [325] Maren had always found patterns in static — rhythms beneath randomness, structure inside noise. [338] It was how she saw faces, too. [345] Every face had an underlying architecture that persisted even after the muscles relaxed into death. [358] She read that architecture now, tracing Ilse's cheekbones, the asymmetry of her brow, the fine parenthetical lines around her mouth that meant a lifetime of almost-smiling. [382]

She mixed pigments to match the living warmth Ilse's skin had lost. [394] Not to counterfeit life but to honor it — to infuse the surface with the memory of blood, of heat, of motion. [416] Each brushstroke was deliberate. [420] Maren worked in a state she thought of as lucidly watchful, a calm so deep it bordered on meditation yet never lost its precision. [442] She noticed everything: the way aurora light shifted the apparent color of the foundation, the faint frost forming on Ilse's eyelashes, the moment when her own breath synchronized with the static's rhythm and the grotto seemed to hold its breath in return. [480]

This was the threshold of stillness — the exact point where preparation ended and presence began, where the body ceased being a task and became a testament. [506] Maren had crossed it hundreds of times in her career, but never in a place like this, where the whole sky leaned close to watch. [531]

She finished the face. [535] She combed Ilse's silver hair and arranged it so the aurora painted it in living color. [551] Then she lifted the emerald chip. [557]

It was warm. [560] It should not have been warm. [566] The discharges inside it quickened, responding perhaps to proximity, perhaps to some resonance between Ilse's body and the crystal she had grown from sky-stuff. [589] Maren parted Ilse's lips gently, placed the chip beneath her tongue, and closed her mouth. [604]

For one breath, the grotto filled with green light so intense it erased all shadow. [619] The static peaked into a single clear tone, a note Maren felt in her sternum. [634] Then it subsided, and the radiant hush returned — deeper now, as though the silence had substance, as though it were a room one could live inside. [661]

Maren sat back on her heels. [667] Ilse's face was luminous and still, carrying its last spark sealed behind lips that almost smiled. [682] Above them both, the aurora rippled on, undiminished, finding patterns in its own ancient static. [696]

Maren closed her case. [700] She did not hurry to leave. [706] The grotto held them both in its crystalline quiet, and for a long while she simply remained — lucidly watchful, honoring the stillness, letting it be enough. [733]
