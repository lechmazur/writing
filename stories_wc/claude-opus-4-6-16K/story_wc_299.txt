The quarry office trailer sat at the edge of a limestone pit so deep it seemed to swallow sound before returning it changed, hollowed out, lonesome, the ghost of whatever you'd shouted down into it. [35] Marcus Vell climbed the three metal steps and let himself in. [46] The trailer smelled like calcium dust and old coffee. [55] A woman named Diane had called him about estate items - her father, the quarry foreman, had died in March, and she needed everything in his office appraised before the company cleared it out. [88]

Marcus set his leather case on the desk and surveyed the room. [100] He was good at this part - the clinical sweep, the inventory eye. [112] Twelve years as an antiques appraiser had taught him to see objects as coordinates of age, provenance, and market value. [132] Facts were clean. [135] Facts didn't ask how you were doing. [142]

Six weeks ago, he'd stood on the stage of a regional auction house and confidently declared a Victorian mourning brooch to be genuine jet from Whitby. [168] It was glass. [171] Pressed black glass. [174] The correction came live, on camera, from a competing appraiser who smiled while she said it. [190] The clip circulated online with the caption "Antiques Roadkill." [199] He'd watched it four times, each viewing a small quarry of its own, each replay carving him deeper. [217]

Before antiques, he'd been a roadie for Theorem Null, a post-rock band that never quite broke through but played with the intensity of people who believed they would. [245] He'd hauled amplifiers across thirty-seven states, taped set lists to monitor wedges, and learned that the silence after the applause was a country unto itself - vast, unmapped, and difficult to leave. [276] When the band dissolved after their bassist Danny drowned in Lake Huron, Marcus discovered that country had no borders. [295] You just kept walking through it. [301]

He'd found appraising the way some people find religion: by accident, in a thrift store, holding a Rookwood vase someone had priced at four dollars. [326] Facts became his liturgy. [330] Maker's marks, glaze chemistry, kiln temperatures. [336] If he knew enough, he wouldn't have to feel the specific gravity of what he'd lost. [352]

Now he opened drawers in the dead foreman's desk. [361] A Schaefer pen, 1950s, moderate condition. [367] A Zippo lighter with a quarry company logo - collectible but common. [378] He cataloged each item with confidently uncertain precision, the way he always worked: asserting value while knowing that value was only ever a negotiation between what something was and what someone needed it to be. [413]

In the bottom drawer, beneath a stack of blast schedules, his fingers touched fabric. [427] He pulled it free and the room shifted. [435]

It was a scrap of speaker grille cloth. [443] Black, with the silver thread pattern he recognized immediately - Theorem Null's custom cabinets. [456] Danny had insisted on that weave. [462] Marcus turned the scrap over. [467] On the back, in faded Sharpie: "Marquette, MI - last good night." [478]

His throat tightened. [481] He held the cloth to his nose and inhaled dust and age and nothing that smelled like Danny, nothing that smelled like the road, and that absence was its own sharp fact. [513]

He wanted to wrest some meaning from it - to pull purpose from this fragment the way you'd pull a fossil from limestone. [535] Why was it here, in a quarry foreman's desk in southern Ohio? [547] Had the man been at that show? [554] Had he caught a scrap when they'd torn down the stage in the rain? [568]

Marcus sat in the foreman's chair and looked through the window at the quarry's pale walls, where every sound returned to you altered. [591] He understood that impulse. [595] To shout into emptiness and wait for the echo, hoping it comes back as something you can use. [613]

He set the cloth on the desk beside his appraisal sheet. [624] Market value: negligible. [627] Personal value: unquantifiable. [630] He wrote both figures down, because facts were what he had, and because sometimes the truest appraisal was admitting that the thing you held was worth more than any system could measure. [662]

Outside, a truck engine echoed across the pit and faded. [672] Marcus pocketed the cloth scrap, closed his case, and stepped back into the wide, unanswered afternoon. [688]
