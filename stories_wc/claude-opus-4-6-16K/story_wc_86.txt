The parapet had not been neutral territory when the war began. [11] It had belonged to the northern garrison, then the southern militia, then no one at all, because the storms had scoured it down to bare stone and memory. [38] Now it belonged to the mist. [44]

Maren climbed the last steps with her lantern dimmed, feeling the wind press against her like a hand urging her back. [63] She was uncommonly thoughtful for someone in her profession—prisoner exchange negotiators were expected to be sharp, transactional, cold—but Maren had always believed that the space between two enemies was sacred ground, deserving of reverence. [96] She set her satchel on the worn stone ledge and waited. [107]

The mist curled along the parapet's edge, swallowing the drop below. [118] Somewhere in the valley, two armies held each other's people in cages, and both sides had agreed that this windblown ruin was the only place where words could be spoken without bullets following. [149] Neutral territory. [151] The one geography that war could not claim. [159]

She reached into her coat pocket and turned the antique drawer pull between her fingers—brass, tarnished green, shaped like a lion's head with a ring in its teeth. [188] It had belonged to her father's writing desk, the desk where he had drafted letters of apology to families whose children he had sent to die. [214] He had been a negotiator too, before the guilt untethered him from reason and he walked into a winter river and did not walk out. [238]

Maren kept the drawer pull not as sentiment but as instruction. [249] She carried it to remind herself that remorse without direction was just drowning. [261] Her father's mistake had been letting sorrow accumulate without converting it into anything useful. [273] She intended to recycle mistakes into wisdom—his mistakes, her own, the mistakes of every commander who had let pride curdle into atrocity. [293]

Footsteps echoed from the opposite stairwell. [299] Colonel Dashev emerged from the mist, his collar turned up against the wind, his face a landscape of exhaustion. [316] He carried no weapon, as agreed, only a sealed envelope. [326]

"You received the terms?" Maren asked. [332]

"I received them." [335] He did not sit. [339] "Your side wants Lieutenant Grosz returned before we see any of our twelve." [350]

"Lieutenant Grosz has information about the shelling of Verdaine. [358] Your commanders know what happened there. [364] Until that is acknowledged, the families will not accept any exchange." [374]

A furrowed hush settled between them, the kind of silence that arrives between apology and forgiveness, when one side has spoken the difficult words but the other has not yet decided whether to believe them. [407] Dashev stared at the mist. [413]

"We issued a formal statement," he said quietly. [421]

"A statement is not acknowledgment. [426] Acknowledgment requires the return of the person who can testify." [435]

Maren set the drawer pull on the stone between them, not as a gesture but because her fingers needed steadiness and the brass was warm from her grip. [463] Dashev glanced at it. [467]

"What is that?" [470]

"A piece of furniture from a man who could not forgive himself. [481] I bring it to remind me that this work requires more than guilt. [494] It requires timing." [497]

She opened her satchel and unfolded a chart—a lunar calendar, annotated in her hand, tracking the phases of the moon across the next sixty days. [523] The method she had devised was unorthodox but precise: synchronizing through moon phases, each exchange timed to the quarter moon, so that both sides operated on a celestial schedule no general could manipulate or dispute. [556] The moon belonged to no army. [562] It was its own neutral territory. [568]

"Full moon, you release three. [573] First quarter, we release three. [578] New moon, three more from each side. [584] Last quarter, the final exchange, including Grosz, with international observers present under the dark sky." [597]

Dashev studied the chart. [601] The wind pulled at its edges but Maren held firm. [611]

"Why the moon?" he asked. [616]

"Because neither of us trusts the other's clocks." [624]

Something shifted in his face—not warmth, but recognition. [633] He understood that she was offering him a framework built on something older and less corruptible than politics. [649] She was trying to untether the exchange from the machinery of war and bind it instead to something neither side could own. [672]

He picked up the drawer pull, examined the lion's face, and set it back down. [686]

"Your father's?" [688]

"My father's failure. [691] I keep it so it becomes something else." [699]

Dashev folded the chart carefully and placed it inside the envelope he had brought. [713] "I will present your terms. [718] Full moon is in nine days." [724]

"Then we have nine days to decide whether sorry means anything." [735]

He descended the stairs without another word, and Maren stood alone on the parapet, the mist closing behind him like a door. [757] She picked up the drawer pull and returned it to her pocket, where it rested against her heartbeat, heavy with purpose. [778] Below, the valley waited in its furrowed hush, balanced between what had been broken and what might, with patience and timing and the indifferent light of the moon, still be repaired. [808]

I notice the final count is 808 words, slightly over. Let me revise:
