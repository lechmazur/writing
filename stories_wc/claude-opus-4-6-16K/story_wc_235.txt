The cabin smelled like pine resin and old ink, which was exactly how Maren remembered it, though she couldn't be sure if this was a memory from age twelve or age forty or somewhere in between. [33] Time had become unreliable since she'd stood before the granite marker bearing her own name, her own dates — born and died, the second date only three years from now. [62] She'd found it in the cemetery behind the ranger station while searching for signal, of all things, and now signal seemed like the least important thing she'd ever sought. [87]

She unrolled the birch bark scroll across the rough-hewn table, its surface already covered in her cramped handwriting — dream after dream, catalogued and cross-referenced, the work of fifteen years spent as a lucid dream chronicler. [118] The scroll was her masterwork, a continuous record she'd been keeping since she first learned to step consciously into her sleeping mind and walk its corridors like a visitor in her own museum. [147] Now the entries blurred together. [152] She couldn't tell which dreams she'd had last week and which she'd transcribed a decade ago, and worse, she couldn't tell which ones had been dreams at all. [178]

Through the cabin's single window, the Cascade Range stretched in every direction, brutal and indifferent and staggeringly beautiful. [195] She'd taken the mountain ranger posting to be alone with the work, to distill the chaos of a thousand recorded dreams into something resembling narrative — a book, maybe, or at least an understanding. [225] Instead, the altitude and the solitude had loosened something feral in her memory. [237]

Nostalgia hit her like weather now, sudden and soaking. [246] Not the gentle kind that warms you at holidays, but something with teeth — a wild, aching hunger for selves she could no longer reach. [270] She'd dream of herself at nineteen, fearless in a way that made her current body feel like a cage, and she'd wake up jealous. [293] Genuinely, corrosively jealous of the girl who hadn't yet accumulated all this knowing. [305] She'd dream of herself at thirty, sharp and ambitious, burning through relationships like fuel, and she'd wake up envious of that carelessness too. [325] Getting jealous of past selves was, she'd learned, a particular kind of poison — it turned every version of you into a rival. [347]

The gravestone had made it worse. [353] Or maybe better. [356] She was chronologically confused now in a way that felt almost liberating, as though seeing her endpoint had scrambled the sequence and freed her from pretending the timeline was a line at all. [385] In last night's dream she had been all her ages at once, standing in a field she recognized as the meadow behind her childhood home, and she had spread arms that were simultaneously chubby and freckled and lean and liver-spotted, and she had begun to soar. [425]

Not fly — soar. [429] The distinction mattered. [432] Flying was effort and direction. [437] Soaring was surrender to a thermal, a willingness to be lifted. [447] She'd written it on the birch bark this morning with hands that trembled, because the sensation had followed her out of sleep and she could still feel it in her sternum, that buoyancy, as if grief and wonder had fused into a single updraft. [485]

Jaded wonder — that was what she'd started calling this feeling in her notes. [498] The capacity to be astonished by a world you no longer trusted. [510] The mountains did it to her every morning, those ancient peaks that would outlast her so effortlessly it was almost funny. [529] She laughed sometimes, alone in the cabin, at the cosmic joke of consciousness — that you could be aware enough to chronicle your own dreams but not aware enough to stop time from eating you alive. [561]

She picked up her pen and began to write again, not because the scroll would save her but because the act of transcription was the only thing that made the chaos bearable. [592] Dream by dream, she was building something. [599] Not a monument. [602] Not a legacy. [605] Just a record that said: here was a woman who paid attention, who noticed the way her sleeping mind kept returning to the same meadow, the same thermal, the same impossible upward pull. [636]

The grave could have its dates. [642] She would keep the dreams. [648] Outside, the last light caught the snowline and turned it gold, and Maren watched with eyes that had seen too much and somehow not nearly enough, and she felt the feral thing in her chest howl its beautiful, inconsolable howl, and she wrote that down too. [695]
