Maren had always spoken in meter without meaning to, her sentences falling into rhythms that made the other dock workers uneasy, as though her voice belonged to someone older than her body could account for. [35] She was a wharf weaver by trade, mending nets and sail-canvas where the river met the sea, her fingers perpetually stained with tar and salt and the lavender thread she insisted on using for her final stitches. [66] But her real work began after the tide pools emptied each evening, when the water pulled back from the red canyon's base and revealed the narrow mouth of the labyrinth. [93]

The labyrinth had been carved into the canyon walls centuries ago by a people whose name the town had deliberately forgotten. [113] Its passages spiraled inward and upward through sandstone the color of dried blood, and for generations the town's precedent had been absolute: no one enters willingly. [137] The labyrinth was ruin, they said. [143] It was contagion. [146] The sleepwalkers proved it. [150]

Every few nights, someone in the village would rise from bed with blank eyes and walk barefoot down the canyon trail, slipping through the labyrinth's entrance as though summoned. [177] They returned by dawn, feet raw, remembering nothing. [185] The town called it a curse and nailed sleepers' doors shut, tied ankles to bedposts, poured salt across thresholds. [201] But the sleepwalkers always found a way back to those red walls, their paths overlapping and diverging through the labyrinth's corridors like threads on a loom only the unconscious mind could read. [233]

Maren had been one of them once, as a child. [243] She remembered nothing of her walks, only the strange peace she felt upon waking, a solace so delicate it reminded her of the wild orchids that somehow grew in the canyon's deepest shade — beauty persisting where it had no logical right to exist. [280] That feeling never fully left her. [286] It made her hauntingly optimistic, the kind of woman who could stand in wreckage and describe what the light was doing. [305]

She found the storybook illustration plate at a estate sale three towns over, buried under almanacs and mouse-chewed linens. [323] It was a copper printing plate, hand-engraved, depicting the labyrinth from above as it must have appeared to its original builders. [342] The image showed not a curse but a cathedral — a spiraling path meant to be walked in reverence, each passage annotated with symbols Maren recognized from the patterns her own sleeping feet had traced in canyon dust. [375] The plate had once printed pages for a book of sacred journeys, and here was the labyrinth rendered as holy architecture, not affliction. [396]

She understood then what the sleepwalkers had been doing all along. [407] They were remembering what the waking town refused to. [416] Their overlapping paths were not symptoms of disease but acts of devotion, the body honoring what the mind had been taught to fear. [438] Via those overlapping sleepwalking paths, the labyrinth's true route had been preserved in footprints and erosion, worn into the stone by centuries of unconscious pilgrimage. [462]

Maren began to sew. [466] She stretched sail-canvas across a frame in her workshop and, using the illustration plate as her guide and the sleepwalkers' foot-worn grooves as her confirmation, she stitched the labyrinth's map into fabric with the same lavender thread she used to finish her nets. [506] Each passage she had charted by lantern light on her own waking walks through the canyon, matching copper engraving to sandstone groove, she rendered in careful, loving stitches. [535] She was breaking every precedent the town held sacred — entering the labyrinth by choice, by consciousness, by craft. [553]

When she hung the finished tapestry in the town hall, no one spoke for a long time. [568] The map was undeniably beautiful. [573] It showed the labyrinth not as a wound in the canyon but as a flowering, its spiral passages opening like petals toward a central chamber where the illustration plate depicted a sky full of stars. [605] Maren stood beside her work and said, in that accidental meter of hers, that she had made it to carve a path from ruin to reverence, to show that what they had called madness was memory and what they had called contamination was communion. [647]

The first person to walk the labyrinth willingly after Maren was the harbormaster's daughter, who had sleepwalked since she was nine. [669] She went at dusk, after the tide pools emptied, carrying the lavender-threaded map rolled under her arm. [685] She returned before midnight with red dust on her feet and an expression Maren recognized — that orchid solace, delicate and defiant, blooming in a place the world had written off as barren. [715]

Others followed. [717] The precedents broke like tide pools draining, quietly, inevitably, revealing what had always been beneath. [731]
