The fortress bloomed at dusk the way fortresses shouldn't — with wisteria cascading from ramparts and jasmine threading through arrow slits, petals drifting down like soft ammunition against anyone who dared feel nothing. [35]

Maren arrived chanting. [38]

She always chanted while walking, a low percussive murmur that matched her footfalls, syllables she'd collected from every town that had hired her and every town that had sent her away. [68] The words meant nothing individually — fragments of lullabies, auction calls, a fishmonger's Wednesday pitch — but strung together they became a rhythm that kept her moving forward, and forward was the only direction that didn't collapse. [101]

She was a wandering fireworks designer, which meant she was perpetually soaked in sulfur and wonder, perpetually broke, and perpetually convinced that the next sky she painted would be the one worth remembering. [133] Tonight, though, there would be no sky to paint. [142] The stars had vanished behind a totality of cloud so complete it felt like the universe had drawn a curtain. [160] During the hush of a night with no stars, the darkness didn't sparkle — it pressed. [175]

She'd come to the fortress because of a rumor: somewhere in the courtyard walls, a mosaic depicted a formula — a note in mosaic, the locals called it — tile fragments arranged centuries ago by a pyrotechnician whose name had been scrubbed from guild records. [210] They said the mosaic encoded a composition for a firework that burned in colors no one had names for. [228] Maren didn't fully believe it, but she'd stopped requiring belief as fuel a long time ago. [243] Defiance worked better. [246] Her entire career was built to defy the gravity of hopelessness, the pull that said color was frivolous, that spectacle fed no one, that a woman who spent her savings on strontium salts deserved her poverty. [275]

Inside the courtyard, the flowers were overwhelming. [282] Their scent thickened the air into something almost liquid, and Maren had to filter sensation carefully, letting the fragrance pass through her without drowning in it, searching through ambient awareness for something sharper beneath the sweetness — the mineral tang of old glaze, the geometric interruption of intentional pattern among organic bloom. [326]

Her chanting shifted, slowed, became a kind of sonar. [335] She ran her fingers along the walls, feeling where vine gave way to tile. [348] Petals stuck to her hands. [353] She brushed them off against her belt, where a fire spinner's kerosene rag knot hung like a talisman — not hers originally, but traded to her by a performer in Almeria who'd said, Keep this close and you'll never forget that fire is a conversation, not a command. [397]

The knot was hard and dark and still faintly smelled of fuel even after months of open air. [414] She pressed it against the wall now, using it to clear away moss, scrubbing in slow circles until tessellated edges appeared. [433]

Maren worked for an hour, chanting, cleaning, filtering each revealed tile through her understanding of combustion chemistry. [448] The mosaic slowly emerged: not a picture but a diagram, ratios expressed in colored relationships — the angle of cobalt to copper, the proportion of gold to deep arterial red. [475] It was, she realized with serious delight, a recipe written for people who thought in light. [490]

She copied it onto her forearm with a charcoal stub, laughing softly at the absurdity of flesh as notebook. [508] The formula called for compounds she recognized and two she didn't, mineral combinations that would require experimentation, failure, probably small fires in inappropriate locations. [530] Perfect. [531]

The starless night pressed on, but it no longer felt oppressive. [541] It felt like a canvas waiting. [547] The hush wasn't emptiness — it was the held breath before ignition. [558]

Maren tied the kerosene rag knot back to her belt and walked out through the fortress gate, resuming her chant at full rhythm now, the new formula's ratios weaving into her cadence like a discovered verse of a song she'd always been singing. [600]

The wisteria trembled in her wake. [606]

Somewhere ahead was a city with a festival, a patron with coin, a dark sky begging for disruption. [623] She would arrive smelling of jasmine and kerosene, chanting her nonsense litany, carrying on her arm a dead pyrotechnician's final secret. [643] She would build the formula wrong three times, maybe seven. [652] She would adjust, recalculate, argue with the chemistry until it relented and gave her those unnamed colors. [667]

And then she would fire them into a starless sky and make the darkness answer, because that was the work — not to wait for light, but to manufacture it, stubbornly, beautifully, with serious playfulness and sulfur-stained hands. [703]

The night had no stars. [708]

Maren walked, chanting, and carried her own. [715]
