<story>The tower fell on a Tuesday, though Sera only knew this because the roses told her. [15]

She was senselessly perceptive that way, attuned to shifts no instrument could measure. [27] The desert roses in Dome Seven had curled their petals inward a full hour before the distant rumble rolled across the salt flats, before the plume of dust erased the horizon line where the Meridian Tower had stood for three generations. [58]

Now, in the days after, Sera knelt among the rows and pressed her palm to the sand. [73] The glass dome above caught the late sun and held it, turning the enclosure into a basin of amber light, a tranquil blaze that made the roses glow like living coals. [99]

Her father would have called this waste. [106] Kem Aldara, bounty hunter, had never understood why his daughter chose soil over steel. [118] He had left her the farm as a kind of insult, she suspected, a glass cage in the middle of nowhere, the last asset he could not sell. [142] But Sera had taken it like a seed takes rain, without argument, without resentment. [155] She was a pacifist not by ideology but by marrow. [164]

She reached into her apron pocket and withdrew a scrap of airship ballast sandbag, rough canvas, oil-stained, with the faded stencil of a freight company that no longer existed. [192] Her father had carried it folded in his vest pocket for luck, the way other men carried photographs. [207] When he had died, taken down not by a fugitive but by his own tired heart, they had sent her his effects in a tin box. [229] The scrap was the only thing she kept. [237]

She buried it now at the base of the oldest rose bush. [248]

"This is persistence," she told the plant, pressing the soil firm. [258] "This is what it means to carry weight for someone else." [268]

This was her method, strange as it sounded. [276] She was inculcating plants with values, offering each rose a story, a principle, a human quality pressed into the earth alongside bone meal and water. [298] The practice had started as grief and become ritual, then philosophy. [308] She believed the roses absorbed what they were given, that their roots wound around meaning the way they wound around stone. [327]

The settlement survivors had begun arriving yesterday, dust-caked and stunned. [336] The tower's fall had scattered infrastructure, shattered communication relays, ended the rationing schedules that kept the outer farms connected. [351] Chaos, in its purest administrative form. [357] People came to her dome because it was intact, because the glass still held, because the roses were blooming in defiant reds and pinks against the beige nothing of the desert. [384]

Sera did not turn anyone away. [390] She fed them rosehip tea and flatbread. [397] She let them sleep between the rows. [403] But she did not stop her work, because her motivation was precise: to weave continuity through chaos. [417] The roses were the thread. [422] If she could keep them growing, keep speaking into them, the world retained a grammar. [435]

A young man with a militia sash asked her if she had weapons. [447]

She looked at him with that unsettling perception of hers, reading the tremor in his hand, the grief behind his bluster, the boy beneath the soldier. [470]

"There is a knife in the toolshed," she said. [479] "For grafting." [481]

He went and found it. [486] When he came back, something in his face had changed, softened by the quiet inside the dome. [501] Sera watched him turn the blade over in his hands. [510]

"You can sheathe it," she said gently. [517] "Nothing here needs cutting." [521]

He did. [523] He sat down among the roses and wept, and she let him, because weeping was its own kind of grafting, old pain spliced onto new growth. [547]

The dome hummed with an engraved quiet, a silence that was not empty but carved, shaped by intention, scored into the glass and soil and air by weeks and months and years of a woman choosing stillness in a landscape built for violence. [585] It was the kind of quiet that left marks. [593] Visitors felt it on their skin and mistook it for temperature. [603]

Outside, the sun blazed low, turning the dome into a lantern visible for miles across the flats. [618] Sera moved between her roses, whispering. [624] Persistence. [625] Compassion. [626] Patience. [627] Surrender. [628]

The world had lost its tower. [634] She was building something else, root by root, word by word, that would not fall. [648]
