Luelle had spent eleven years tracing the origins of things that did not want to be found. [16] As a provenance researcher, she catalogued lineages of paintings, crowns, bones—artifacts whose histories curled back into shadow. [32] But nothing had resisted her like the transparent violin made of ice crystal, which sat now on a velvet pedestal in the center of the observatory, refracting midsummer starlight into a thousand silent colors. [62]

The Savrenne Empire claimed the violin as a symbol of its founding. [73] Their archivists insisted it had been forged in the imperial glassworks three centuries ago, a gift from the first Empress to her people. [95] But Luelle's research told a different story—one threaded with gaps, with silences that ached like bruises beneath silk. [113] A perforated destiny, her grandmother would have called it: a fate so riddled with holes that the truth could slip through if you weren't careful. [137]

She tilted her coffee cup and studied the stain it left on the saucer's rim. [152] This was her secret method, inherited and irrational—reading the future in coffee stains. [165] The brown residue mapped a branching pattern tonight: a tree, or a root system, or a hand reaching. [182] She had learned not to dismiss what the stains offered. [192] Last autumn, they had shown her a shipwreck two weeks before the maritime museum confirmed one. [207] Tonight they showed growth. [211] Propagation. [212] Something spreading outward from a single source. [219]

The observatory's velvet curtains stirred, though no window was open. [229] Along the sill, the midsummer jasmine shivered, and Luelle felt the familiar intrusion—not a sound exactly, but a pressure behind her thoughts. [252] The jasmine was afraid. [256]

She had become accidentally telepathic with plants three years ago, after handling a contaminated soil sample in a botanical archive. [274] The doctors found nothing wrong. [279] But the ivy in her apartment began murmuring about drought, and the oak outside her window grieved audibly each November. [298] She had learned to listen without answering, because answering only made them louder. [312]

The jasmine's fear was specific: cold. [319] The violin radiated a chill that deepened as the nights shortened toward the solstice's peak. [333] The ice crystal should have melted in any rational world, but it held its shape with a stubbornness that suggested something beyond material science. [356] Luelle had traced its composition to a glacier in the northern reaches—not the imperial glassworks at all, but a frozen lake where, according to folk record, a woman had once played music so beautiful it stopped a war. [396]

That woman was not an empress. [402] She was a shepherd. [406] And the war she stopped was the very conquest that founded the Savrenne Empire. [420]

This was the weight Luelle carried: to weigh a dream against an empire. [433] The dream of a single shepherd whose music had been stolen, reattributed, swallowed into imperial myth. [448] If Luelle published her findings, the Empire's founding narrative would crack. [459] If she stayed silent, the shepherd would remain erased—her destiny perforated beyond recognition, every hole plugged with someone else's glory. [479]

The coffee stain said propagate. [484] The jasmine said cold. [488] The violin said nothing, but it shimmered with a light that Luelle understood was borrowed from the promise—the original promise of the shepherd's song, which had been that beauty could prevent bloodshed. [520] That promise was losing its glow. [526] She could feel it dimming in the crystal's transparency, as if the instrument were slowly forgetting what it had been made to do. [548]

Before the promise loses its glow. [554] That was her deadline, though no one had spoken it aloud. [564]

Luelle set down the coffee cup. [570] She pulled her research folio from the velvet chair and opened it to the final page, where her conclusion waited, unwritten. [591] The mulberry sky beyond the observatory dome pressed close, heavy with the ache of everything that persists past its season. [610]

She picked up her pen. [615] She would not let the shepherd vanish. [622] She would propagate the truth outward from this single point—this velvet room, this midsummer night, this violin that wept cold light—until the holes in history were no longer holes but windows, and anyone who looked through them could see what had really happened. [665]

The jasmine exhaled. [668] The ice crystal sang one faint, clear note, thin as grief, bright as the moment before forgetting. [683]

Luelle began to write. [687]
