The energy beings arrived on a Tuesday, though by Wednesday no one could agree what a Tuesday had ever meant. [21]

Maren had been drifting for eleven years by then, composing verses on napkins and gas station receipts, trading poems for rides along highways that no longer led anywhere certain. [50] She was a roadside poet, the kind of person who could find the sacred in a ditch and make you believe it. [69] When the luminous entities descended and rewrote the sky into something that pulsed like a living membrane, most people screamed or prayed. [89] Maren wrote a couplet about how starlight tastes different when it's watching you back. [102]

Now she sat cross-legged in a terra-cotta grotto she'd discovered beneath a collapsed overpass outside what used to be Flagstaff, Arizona. [122] The walls were the color of dried blood and old earth, carved by water that had long since abandoned its work. [142] Above her, through a jagged aperture in the rock, the stars moved in patterns they hadn't moved in before—spiraling, recursive, as though the universe were learning to stutter. [168] The energy beings had done that, rearranged celestial geometry the way a child rearranges alphabet magnets on a refrigerator, not maliciously but with a curiosity that made malice irrelevant. [194]

In her lap she held a frayed coil of rope, hemp fibers splitting like nervous endings. [210] She'd found it three days ago tangled in the fence outside the state penitentiary in Florence, where the energy beings had dissolved every wall and every sentence simultaneously. [237] The prisoners had already fled, but this rope remained—someone's desperate, handmade lifeline, braided from bedsheets and twisted into something that could hold a man's weight over a concrete wall. [264] It had been used before the beings made all walls meaningless. [274] Maren kept it because it represented the last human escape that had required effort, the last impossible choice made with mortal hands. [294]

She ran her fingers along its braids, feeling the pattern of the weave, how desperation had its own rhythm. [313] By uncovering layers—each strand pulled slightly apart, each fiber examined—she was trying to understand something the energy beings seemed to already know. [335] She wanted to discover the texture of time itself, to feel whether it was woven tight like this rope or loose like the verses she scattered behind her. [362]

The beings had posed humanity an impossible choice three days after their arrival: they would share their knowledge of temporal architecture, the ability to perceive all moments simultaneously, but only if humans agreed to surrender linear memory. [398] You could know everything at once or remember your life as a story. [411] Not both. [413]

Maren found this ethically playful, the way a koan is playful, the way a god might tease a creature it genuinely loves. [434] She turned the rope over in her hands and thought about the prisoner who'd braided it. [449] That person had faced their own impossible choice: rot in certainty or risk death for freedom. [464] They'd chosen the braiding, the making, the pattern of action over the paralysis of safety. [478]

She began to write, pressing her pen against the curved terra-cotta wall where starlight made the surface glow amber. [496]

"Time is a rope we braid from our own unraveling." [506]

She paused, listened to the hum the energy beings made when they were close, a sound like every frequency played softly at once. [528] One hovered at the grotto's mouth, its light spilling down like water. [540] It wasn't waiting for humanity's collective answer. [547] It was waiting for hers. [551]

Maren understood then that the choice was not between knowledge and memory. [562] It was between two kinds of texture—the smooth, infinite surface of omniscience and the rough, fraying weave of a life lived in sequence. [585] She held the rope to her chest. [591] Every knot in it was a moment someone had decided to keep going despite not knowing what came next. [608]

She looked up at the being and smiled with the passionate subtlety of someone who has found her answer in the imperfection of the question. [632]

"I'll keep the braid," she said. [638]

The being pulsed once, something that might have been respect, and withdrew into the rearranged stars. [653]

Maren stayed in the grotto until dawn, writing poems on terra-cotta walls by the light of a universe that had offered her everything and watched her choose the texture of not-knowing, the impossible sweetness of time experienced one fraying strand at a time. [697]
