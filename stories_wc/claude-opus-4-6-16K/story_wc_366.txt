Margit had never spoken more than eleven words to any keeper on her route, but she knew them all by the way they stacked their stones. [25]

For twenty-three years she had skippered the supply tender along the northern chain, ferrying oil, wicks, lenses, letters, and silence from one lonely tower to the next. [52] She was reticent by nature and by necessity; the sea had taught her that words, like fresh water, ought to be rationed. [72] But she watched. [75] She watched the way Keeper Einarsson always left three flat stones beside the landing dock, tilted east, meaning he needed lamp oil before anything else. [94] She watched how old Solveig at Grimsey stacked hers in a narrow column with a shell on top, her private code for loneliness. [114] Margit never asked them to explain their cairns. [122] She simply read them the way a warmly observant mother reads the architecture of a child's silence, and she answered with supplies, adjusted schedules, a tin of dried apricots slipped between the requisition crates. [152]

The stones were the beginning of the letters, though Margit did not realize it at the time. [168]

It started the winter Solveig died. [174] Margit found the old woman's last cairn still standing on the Grimsey pier: four stones, a feather, a piece of sea glass worn to the milky green of a held breath. [202] She pocketed the sea glass without thinking, the way one pockets grief, and motored on to the next light. [221] At Skardvik she left the glass on the provisions shelf with a scrap of paper beneath it, unsigned, bearing only a sentence Solveig had once murmured during a gale: "The lamp does not ask who it saves." [254]

Keeper Hallgrimsson at Skardvik read the note, turned the sea glass over in his palm, and wrote his own anonymous line on the back of a cargo manifest. [280] He tucked it into the next outgoing crate. [288] Margit carried it, unaware, to Dranganes. [294] The keeper there added a page and sent it onward. [303] Within three months the anonymous letter chain threaded every lighthouse on the route, a braid of unsigned confessions, questions, and small braveries passed hand to hand through Margit's hold. [329] No one claimed authorship. [332] Everyone participated. [334] The keepers, who rarely saw one another, began to feel seen. [344]

Margit discovered the chain on a night in late February when the Skardvik lamp flickered out. [358] She had just docked with emergency supplies, and Hallgrimsson was below, bleeding from a fall on the ice. [374] She climbed the spiral stairs alone, entering the lantern room after the lamp flickered out and left only darkness and the vast Atlantic breathing against the glass. [399]

The room felt haunted. [403] Not by any specter she could name, but by the accumulated weight of every keeper who had ever stood there, tending fire against oblivion. [424] Their fatigue clung to the brass fittings. [431] Their prayers fogged the panes. [436] Margit struck a match, and in its brief flare she saw, pinned to the wall behind the lens mechanism, a sheaf of papers covered in different hands. [460] The letter chain. [463] She read it by matchlight, one flame after another, her chest tightening with something that was not sorrow and not joy but the luminescent ache between them, the color of sea glass held to the sun. [497]

"I keep the light because someone once kept one for me," read one entry. [511] "I am afraid of the dark I am paid to push back," read another. [524] A third: "Safety is not the absence of storm. [532] It is knowing the skipper will come." [539]

She realized then what she had been doing all these years, stacking her own invisible cairns of punctuality and provision. [556] She had been trying to protect them, yes, but more than that, she had been trying to bottle the feeling of safety itself, to seal it in routine and reliable arrivals so it could survive the passage between towers. [593] The letter chain had done what her silence could not: it gave the feeling a voice. [608]

She relit the lamp. [612] The lens caught the flame and flung it seaward, a slow rotation of borrowed light. [625] Downstairs, Hallgrimsson groaned, and she descended to splint his arm with the same steady hands that steered through fog. [643]

Before she left Skardvik at dawn, Margit added her own unsigned page to the chain. [658] She wrote only twelve words, one more than her usual maximum, and placed the piece of sea glass on top to hold the paper down. [682] The words were simple: "I have carried your light in my hold. [692] It was never heavy." [697]

She stacked three stones on the pier, tilted east, and motored into the gray morning, reticent as ever, burning so quietly that only the keepers could tell she was aflame. [728]
