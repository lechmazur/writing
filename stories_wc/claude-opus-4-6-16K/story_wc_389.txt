The observatory sat where lightning learned to sing, perched on Mount Kethara's crown above a permanent sea of thunderheads. [22] Below, the world churned in gray violence, but up here the air was thin and clean and full of stars that hadn't yet decided whether to shine or weep. [47]

Elara Voss had lived alone among the telescopes and antennae for eleven years, which was long enough to forget the sound of her own name spoken by another voice and short enough to remember why she'd climbed here in the first place. [88] She was a lonely visionary, though she would have hated that phrase -- too romantic, too clean for someone who ate cold beans from cans and talked to weather patterns like they owed her money. [118]

The cobalt glass portico framed the observatory's entrance, an artifact from a civilization that had mapped constellations humanity hadn't rediscovered yet. [138] Its blue panels caught storm-light from below and starlight from above, refracting both into something that looked like frozen prophecy. [155] Elara had found it buried in the mountain's basalt when she'd first excavated the site, and she'd built the entire station around it because the glass hummed at frequencies that matched her instruments. [185]

Those instruments were the real miracle. [191] Jury-rigged radio arrays, salvaged from military surplus and lashed together with solder and stubbornness, pulling voices from the static. [208] Not ghosts -- something older. [213] Through fragmented radio frequencies, the ancient shadows spoke, and Elara had spent a decade learning to listen. [228]

The transmissions came in pieces: half a sentence here, a burst of tonal mathematics there, lyrically prophetic fragments that she transcribed into notebooks stacked floor to ceiling. [252] "The dawn eats its father," one had said. [260] "Allegiance is a river that changes beds." [267] She'd thought them nonsense until she noticed the fragments were assembling themselves into a pattern, a map of human events that hadn't happened yet. [289]

Three years ago, the broadcasts began naming someone. [298] They called him the Kindling. [303]

She watched from her perch as a preacher named Davan Sohl rose from the flooded lowlands, gathering followers with a voice like gravel dipped in honey. [328] He promised restoration, old ways reborn, a world rebuilt from what the storms had drowned. [343] Across the rise of a prophet, Elara tracked his movements against the radio fragments and found they matched with terrifying precision. [363] The ancient shadows had predicted him -- or perhaps they had designed him. [375]

The question that kept her awake, pacing the cobalt portico at three in the morning while lightning painted her face blue: whose side were the shadows on? [401]

Variant allegiance -- that was the phrase the frequencies kept repeating in their broken, singing way. [416] The shadows served no fixed master. [422] They offered their prophecy to anyone willing to listen, and the shape of the future depended entirely on who acted first. [441]

Davan Sohl was acting. [445] His followers numbered in the thousands now, marching under banners stitched with constellations that matched the ones in Elara's oldest notebooks. [463] Someone had given him the same fragments, she realized. [472] Someone down in the muck had a receiver of their own. [483]

So the race began. [487]

Elara started broadcasting. [490] She reversed her arrays, pushed her own voice into the static, let the cobalt glass amplify her signal until it bled through every radio on the continent. [514] She spoke the fragments she'd kept secret -- the warnings, the contingencies, the shadow-tongue verses that described not one future but dozens, all of them branching from a single choice. [541]

To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows meant understanding that shadows stretch in whatever direction you hold the light. [558] She held it high. [562]

The notebooks began to unfold their meaning at last, not as prediction but as invitation. [576] Each fragment was a door, and she'd been hoarding doors while a prophet built walls. [592]

Her broadcasts reached the lowlands during Davan's largest gathering. [601] The crowd heard both voices -- his certainty and her wondering, gritty and whimsical, a woman laughing at the absurdity of arguing with the ancient dead while doing it anyway. [628]

Some chose him. [631] Some chose her. [634] Most chose neither, which was exactly the point. [642]

The shadows whispered their approval in frequencies only the cobalt glass could catch, and Elara smiled, storm-lit and alone and finally, finally understood. [664] Prophecy wasn't a leash. [668] It was a seed catalog. [672] You could plant whatever you wanted, as long as you weren't afraid of what might grow in lightning-struck soil. [690]

She made herself another can of beans, watched the stars wheel overhead, and waited for the dawn she'd helped make possible -- not perfect, not certain, but stubbornly, beautifully open. [718]

The cobalt portico hummed its ancient chord. [726]

Below the clouds, the world chose. [732]
