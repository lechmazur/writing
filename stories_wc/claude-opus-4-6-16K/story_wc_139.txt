The funeral home prep room smelled of formaldehyde and lavender, a combination that Mara had learned to breathe through without flinching. [22] She was seventeen, and she had spent her whole life learning not to flinch. [35] Her father was Desmond Kael, the most gifted con artist to ever work the eastern seaboard, and she was the one thing he'd made that wasn't a lie. [62]

She sat on the steel stool beside the embalming table, turning the vintage ink pot in her hands. [78] It was Czech, hand-blown glass with a cobalt glaze, and it had belonged to her mother before her mother had died in a country that no longer existed. [105] The ink inside had long dried to a dark residue, but Mara kept it because it was the only honest object in their household, the one thing her father had never tried to sell. [137]

Tonight she was waiting. [141] Not passively, not the way a child waits for a parent to come home. [155] She was waiting actively, the way a chess player waits with a position already built, every piece aimed at the center of the board, knowing that the opponent's next move would walk into the architecture of consequence. [190]

Her father had promised to meet her here at midnight. [200] He'd been running a scheme on a diplomat from the Moldovan consulate, convincing the man that Desmond could broker political asylum for his dissident brother still trapped in Chisinau. [228] The fee was two hundred thousand dollars. [234] The brother didn't exist. [238] Neither did Desmond's connections to immigration attorneys, safe houses, or anyone in the State Department. [250] It was all scaffolding built from forged letterheads and a voice that could make you believe the sun rose in the west. [270]

Mara had discovered the scheme three days ago when she found the diplomat's file in her father's office. [288] She'd read every page, understood the math of it, and felt the old sickness rise in her throat. [306] Not anger exactly, but something colder: the recognition that her father's brilliance was a disease that consumed everyone it touched. [324]

She wanted to find the mathematics of a fair trade. [334] That was what she'd always wanted, ever since she was old enough to understand that every deal her father made was a breach of someone's trust, a fracture line driven through the architecture of human faith. [367] There had to be an equation where both sides walked away whole. [379] Her mother had believed that. [384] The ink pot was proof, the one gift Desmond had actually paid for. [395]

The back door opened. [399] Her father stepped into the prep room, his overcoat damp with rain, his smile reflexive and brilliant. [414] He looked at her, then at the ink pot, and something in his expression shifted. [428]

"You know," he said. [432]

"I know." [434]

He sat down across from her, the embalming table between them like an altar. [447] The fluorescent lights hummed with a deathly vitality, making everything sharp and merciless. [459] In this room, bodies were made to look alive. [468] Mara thought there was a grim honesty in that, more honesty than her father had shown in decades. [484]

"The diplomat's brother is real, Dad," she said. [492] "I called the consulate. I found him. His name is Anatol, and he has a wife and a daughter who is nine." [514]

Desmond's jaw tightened. [517]

"You took his money to save a man you never intended to save," Mara continued. [530] "So now you're going to save him." [537]

"That's not how this works." [542]

"It is now." [545] She set the ink pot on the table between them. [554] "Mom gave this to you because she believed you could be something other than what you are. [569] I'm not asking you to be good. [576] I'm asking you to do the math. [583] Two hundred thousand dollars, and you actually broker the asylum. [592] You have the contacts to find the contacts. [600] You've built a network of fakes so intricate that somewhere inside it, something real can function." [614]

She watched the idea breach his defenses, watched it liquefy the rigid thinking that had kept him locked in the grift for thirty years. [636] He stared at the ink pot. [641] He stared at her. [645]

"If I do this, I'm exposed," he said. [653]

"If you don't, I turn over your files to the FBI myself." [664]

The room hummed. [667] The lavender and formaldehyde held them in a space between death and presentation, between what was and what could be made to appear. [690]

Desmond picked up the ink pot, cradled it like something fragile and irreplaceable, and for the first time in Mara's memory, he looked like a man calculating a fair price. [719]

"Okay," he said. [722]

Mara exhaled. [724] She had waited actively, and the waiting had worked. [733] Somewhere in Moldova, a man named Anatol would hold his daughter again, and the math, for once, would balance. [751]
