The mist-clad atrium at twilight held its breath the way operating rooms do — suspended between one state of being and another. [24]

Lena Vasquez sat in the glass-walled garden of the Suva rehabilitation hospital, watching fog curl through the open louvers like smoke from a war she could still taste. [51] For eleven years she had served as a translator in Pacific conflict zones — Bougainville, the Solomons, Timor-Leste — ferrying meaning between people whose languages had been shattered by the same bullets. [80] She was good at it, not because she was clever, but because she possessed a quality her colleagues called shrewdly innocent: she could look at a warlord and a widow with the same unguarded eyes, disarming both, while quietly reading every tremor of power between them. [117]

Now the power trembling was inside her own body. [126]

The anesthetic from her shoulder surgery was kicking in, a warm tide climbing from her IV line through her bloodstream, and the atrium's orchids and ferns began to soften at their edges. [157] She should have been in the recovery ward, but she had asked the nurse for ten minutes here, among living things, because the ceiling of a hospital room reminded her too much of the ceiling of a bunker in Honiara where she had lain pinned under fallen concrete, waiting for someone to translate her screams into rescue. [207]

On the table beside her sat a brain coral fragment, pale and ridged like a fossilized thought. [223] A child named Ratu had pressed it into her hand that morning, before they wheeled her away. [239] Ratu was eight, a landmine survivor from the Western Province, and he occupied the pediatric wing two floors above. [256] His left arm was encased in a plaster cast that had become, over weeks of boredom, a canvas — covered in drawings, smudged notes, words in three languages, none of them quite right. [286]

Lena turned the coral over. [291] Ratu had scratched something into its porous surface with a ballpoint pen: PLIS RIDIM ARM BLONG MI. [306] Please read my arm. [310]

She had promised him she would. [316]

The anesthetic deepened, and the atrium's twilight mist became indistinguishable from the fog inside her skull, but she held on. [336] She lifted the photographs she had taken of his cast before surgery — six images on her phone, each capturing a different panel of his plaster sleeve. [361] The notes were smudged by sweat and rain and the restless turning of a boy who could not sleep without nightmares. [381] Some words were Roviana, some Pijin, some a child's attempt at English. [393] She began to unknot them, one phrase at a time, decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast the way she had once decrypted ceasefire terms scrawled on cigarette paper. [420]

WAN BIGFALA SAMTING KAMAP LONG GRAUN — a big thing came from the ground. [433] MI HAREM NATING — I felt nothing. [440] AFTA MI HAREM EVRI SAMTING — after that I felt everything. [450]

Her throat tightened. [453] She recognized the architecture of his fear because it was her own: the shared anxieties of people who have been opened by violence and sutured shut by strangers. [478] The numbness first, then the unbearable return of sensation. [487] The conviction that your body is a foreign country whose language you have lost. [500]

She kept reading. [503] MAMA KRAE OLOWE — Mama cried always. [509] MI NO SAVE MEKEM HEM STOP — I don't know how to make her stop. [522] Then, near the wrist, almost illegible: MI WANTEM NIUFALA STORI BLONG ARM BLONG MI. [535] I want a new story for my arm. [543]

Lena set the phone down and pressed the brain coral to her lips. [556] Its ridges felt like braille for a language not yet invented. [568] To graft new meaning onto old wounds — that was what Ratu was asking. [581] Not to erase the explosion, not to pretend the arm was whole, but to let the cast become something other than a record of damage. [605] A translation. [607]

She picked up the pen the nurse had left for consent forms and, on the back of her own discharge instructions, began to write. [629] A story for his cast. [634] A boy who found a piece of coral that remembered every ocean it had lived through. [649] A boy whose arm, broken and remade, became a map of waters he would one day cross. [666]

The mist thickened around her. [671] The anesthetic pulled her under gently, lotus-hearted in its ache, and the pen slowed but did not stop. [689] She would finish before she slept. [695] She would climb to the pediatric wing tomorrow and read it aloud in every language Ratu needed until one of them sounded like home. [719]

The coral sat between them like a small, porous heart — proof that even the hardest things can be shaped by what passes through them. [744]
