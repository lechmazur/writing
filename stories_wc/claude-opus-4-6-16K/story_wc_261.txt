The anesthesia wore off at dawn, and Maren woke in the quiet tower with her mouth tasting of copper and her left hand wrapped in gauze where they had removed the scar tissue. [33]

She had asked for this. [39] She had always asked for this -- to be opened, to be read, to have someone trace the raised white lines on her skin and tell her what they meant. [64] The surgeons only knew how to cut. [71] They did not know how to translate. [78]

The tower room was sparse: a cot, a window facing east, and on the stone sill, a frosted hourglass she did not remember placing there. [101] Its glass was opaque with a permanent rime, so she could not see the sand inside, only hear it -- a faint hiss like the universe exhaling between one catastrophe and the next. [133]

Maren sat up and looked at the coffee cup on the floor beside her cot. [148] She had been drinking it black before the procedure, and the dregs had dried into overlapping rings on the ceramic, concentric and eccentric, each one a record of a separate sip, a separate tremor of her hand. [181] She had learned years ago that you could read such rings the way dendrochronologists read tree cores. [196] Each ring was a pause, a hesitation, a moment when the cup was set down and the drinker reconsidered whether to continue. [215] She lifted the cup and tilted it toward the dawn light. [226] Three rings. [228] Three moments of doubt before she had let them put her under. [239]

She was a closure seeker by nature, which meant she was also a wound opener by practice. [255] You cannot close what you refuse to unseal. [263] Every scar she carried had been investigated, prodded, sometimes reopened so she could peer inside at the memory trapped beneath the skin. [281] The doctors called it maladaptive. [286] Maren called it literacy. [290] She wanted to learn to read the stories in scars the way others read books -- fluently, without flinching. [307]

The ivy on the tower wall shifted. [314]

She felt it before she saw it -- a slow green thought pressing against the edge of her awareness, the way a cat presses its head against a closed door. [342] The accident that gave her this was laughable in its smallness: a lightning strike to a rooftop garden where she had been standing barefoot in wet soil. [367] Since then, she was accidentally telepathic with plants, a condition no physician believed and no botanist could explain. [383] The ivy was worried about the frost on the hourglass. [393] It kept sending her images of ice crystals damaging cell walls. [403]

"It's glass," she murmured. [407] "You can't hurt glass with cold." [413]

The ivy disagreed, in the way ivy always disagrees -- slowly, persistently, by growing over the thing it doubts. [430]

Maren crossed to the window. [435] The hourglass was running, she realized, though she had not turned it. [447] The sand whispered downward through the narrow throat, tunneling through itself, each grain carving a momentary channel that collapsed behind it. [463] She watched the sand tunnel and thought about miracles. [472]

The miracle was supposed to have happened here, in this tower, centuries ago -- a saint's wounds closing spontaneously, flesh knitting without thread. [491] But the miracle had been displaced. [497] It arrived too late, or in the wrong room, or to the wrong person. [510] The stories varied. [513] What remained consistent was the absence: the saint died, the tower endured, and somewhere in the world, someone who had not asked for healing was healed anyway. [537]

Maren unwrapped her bandaged hand. [542] Beneath the gauze, the surgical site was clean, pink, unremarkable. [551] The scar tissue was gone. [556] And with it, the story it had carried -- a burn from childhood, her mother's careless cigarette, the specific geometry of that pain. [574]

She pressed her bare palm against the frosted hourglass and felt the ivy surge with something like recognition. [590] The cold glass fogged under her warmth. [597] For a moment she could see inside: the sand was not falling down. [609] It was falling up. [613]

The displaced miracle had arrived, centuries late, in a tower at dawn, for a woman who did not want healing. [632] She wanted the wound back. [637] She wanted to read what had been written there. [646]

But the sand tunneled upward, the ivy crept over the sill, and the coffee rings on the ceramic dried into a language she was only beginning to learn -- one that said some stories survive their scars, and some scars survive their stories, and the silence between them is the sound a meteor makes before it reaches the atmosphere: [704]

a hush so total it could be mistaken for peace. [714]

Maren turned the hourglass over and began again. [723]
