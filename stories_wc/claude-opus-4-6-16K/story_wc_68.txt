Maret had not chosen the sewer. [7] The sewer had simply been the last thing that refused to drown. [18]

When the waters rose and swallowed the city of Theriac, its grand colonnades and archives and temples all surrendered to the tide. [38] But the sewers — carved deep into limestone bedrock centuries before anyone thought to build marble halls above them — held pockets of air and stone that the sea could not fully claim. [69] After the plague ended and the survivors crept back from the highland camps, they found Maret already there, cross-legged on a dry ledge above a black canal, surrounded by objects he had pulled from the muck, lecturing no one about epistemology. [107]

He called himself a philosopher. [112] Others called him a scavenger with pretensions. [119] The distinction did not concern him much. [126]

What concerned him was the sediment. [132]

Through sedimentary layers — centuries of compressed silt, calcium deposits, and decomposed matter — Maret excavated the bones of Theriac's true history. [152] He worked with a mason's chisel and a dentist's patience, scraping through strata the way a scholar might parse a corrupted text, layer by layer, each one a sentence written in mineral and decay. [185] The deeper he went, the older the truth. [193] And truth, in the months after the plague's end, had become the most contested resource in the sunken city ruins. [213]

Above him, on the tilted platforms of half-submerged plazas, the survivors were already arguing. [228] Two factions had emerged with competing narratives about what Theriac had been and therefore what it should become. [245] The Restorationists claimed the city had been a center of sacred learning, its purpose spiritual, its downfall a divine punishment. [266] The Foundationists insisted Theriac had been a mercantile republic, pragmatic and secular, drowned by nothing more theological than a shifting fault line. [288] Each side rewrote the past to justify the future they wanted to build. [301]

Maret found both stories incomplete, and he said so, loudly, to anyone who descended into his sewer. [319] This made him rationally rebellious — not a zealot, not a contrarian for the pleasure of it, but a man who could not accept a narrative unsupported by evidence when the evidence was right there, packed in the earth beneath their feet. [358] His rebellion was footnoted. [362] His defiance came with citations. [367]

He would agonize over a single artifact for days. [376] Weeks. [377] The latest was a small brass cog, no larger than his thumbnail, teeth still sharp despite corrosion. [394] A seafarer's chronometer cog — he recognized it from the old technical manuals he had salvaged, texts that described the instruments Theriac's navigators had once used to chart deep-water trade routes. [427] The cog was neither sacred nor purely mercantile. [435] It was both. [438] It was a piece of precision engineering born from the marriage of astronomical knowledge and commercial ambition. [453] It did not fit either faction's story, and that was precisely why it mattered. [466]

He turned it under the light of a fish-oil lamp and felt the familiar weight of futility settle over him. [486] To preserve ancient methods — the way chronometers were assembled, the way limestone was cut, the way navigation was taught through star-charts and tide-tables — this was what drove him. [516] Not nostalgia. [518] Survival. [519] The plague had killed the craftsmen. [525] The flood had killed the workshops. [531] If someone did not recover these techniques from the sediment, they would vanish entirely, and the survivors would be left building their bright new Theriac on a foundation of ideology rather than knowledge. [563]

He set the cog on the ledge beside forty other relics and wiped his hands on his coat. [579]

"You are all going to drown again," he said to the dark water, his voice flat with abrasive calm. [598] "And when you do, no one will remember how to build the pumps." [611]

No one answered. [614] The canal moved slowly. [618] Somewhere above, the factions argued about God and gold. [627]

Maret picked up his chisel, turned to the wall, and scraped another millimeter into the past. [642] The sewer did not care about narratives. [649] The sediment did not lie. [654] And the cog's tiny teeth still meshed with a ghost mechanism that had once, before plague and flood and the insufferable politics of survival, kept perfect time. [679]

He worked. [681] The lamp guttered. [684] The city remembered nothing, so he remembered for it. [693]
