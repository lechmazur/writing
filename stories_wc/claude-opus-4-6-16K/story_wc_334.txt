Maren Calloway had spent forty years cataloging everyone else's folklore without realizing she had lost her own. [16]

She was a hands-on folklorist, the kind who knelt in bog mud to trace root patterns, who slept in churchyards recording the songs drunks sang to gravestones. [41] Chronically curious, she had filled seventeen field notebooks with oral histories, charm remedies, and sketches of threshold markings from Devon to Donegal. [59] But the eighteenth notebook, the one she'd started at twenty-three on a fellowship to the Cornish coast, was empty. [76] Not lost. [78] Empty. [79] Every page blank as milk. [84]

She discovered this the week after she retired, when the habit of constant work finally broke and silence rushed in to replace it. [104] Without lectures to prepare or conferences to attend, Maren sat in her kitchen and felt a door swing open inside her chest, revealing a room she could not enter. [131] Decades later, the absence announced itself: she could not remember a single thing about Cornwall. [146] Not the boarding house, not the fishermen, not whatever she had found important enough to begin a notebook for. [164] The memories had been stolen so cleanly that she had never noticed the wound. [178]

She drove south on instinct, following a coast road that her hands seemed to know better than her mind. [197] It ended at a gravel track descending toward the sea, where the land dipped into a marshy basin and the ruins of a Victorian orchard greenhouse sat half-sunken in brackish water. [228] Its iron ribs rose like the ribcage of something drowned. [238] Around it, the skeletons of five shipwrecks jutted from the shallows, their hulls barnacled and listing, forming a rough circle as though the tides had arranged them as sentinels. [263] Maren stepped out of the car and the air hit her with a crispness that tasted like memory, like autumn mornings she couldn't quite place. [285]

Inside the greenhouse, saltwater covered the tile floor to her ankles. [296] Apple trees, impossibly alive, grew from cracked planters, their branches pressing against what remained of the glass roof. [313] And there, in the central aisle between the rows, a perfect ring of fairy ring mushrooms broke through the waterlogged soil. [332] Tan caps, pale gills, the unmistakable Marasmius oreades arranged in a circle no larger than a dinner table. [349]

Maren's breath caught. [352] She knelt, notebook instinct overriding the cold water soaking her trousers, and studied the ring. [366] Something tugged at the edge of recognition. [373] She had been here before. [378] She had knelt exactly here. [383]

That night she returned with a lamp and looked up through the fractured glass ceiling at the sky. [400] The panes that remained were etched with star charts, hand-scratched into the glass by someone who understood celestial navigation, perhaps a survivor from one of the wrecks outside. [427] But the constellations were wrong. [432] Broken. [433] Stars displaced from their expected positions, as though whoever carved them had encoded a different map entirely. [448]

Maren, who had spent a career detecting hidden patterns in folk practice, began to study the broken constellations with desperate precision. [467] She cross-referenced the displaced stars against her memory of real charts and found that each deviation pointed inward, toward a specific coordinate on the greenhouse floor. [492] Every line converged on the fairy ring. [499]

She understood then, not with logic but with the bone-deep grammar of folklore she had devoted her life to translating. [518] The ring was a lock. [523] The constellations were the key. [528] And forty years ago, young Maren had stepped inside that circle and offered something she didn't understand she was giving. [547]

She removed her shoes. [551] She stepped into the ring at the precise angle the star map indicated, facing the shipwreck whose prow pointed north-northwest. [569] The mushrooms beneath her feet released a scent like cold apples and woodsmoke, and the greenhouse seemed to inhale. [586]

It came back like rain. [591] Cornwall. [592] The old woman in the fisherman's cottage who sang in a language that preceded English. [605] The stories of drowned orchards and the greenhouse built to preserve them. [616] The warning Maren had ignored: that the fairy ring collected memories from the curious, feeding on wonder the way ordinary mushrooms feed on rot. [640] She had entered it carelessly at twenty-three, and it had taken everything she'd gathered, every song and story and image, swallowing her notebook's purpose whole. [665]

Now, decades later, standing in the circle with the knowledge of what she'd lost, she wept and laughed in the same breath. [686] The memories were sharp and crisp as the night they were made, preserved in mushroom and salt and starlight. [704] She could hear the old woman's voice again, feel the specific weight of a Cornish afternoon. [719]

Maren stayed until dawn, barefoot in cold water, reclaiming every stolen hour. [731] Then she opened the eighteenth notebook and, finally, began to write. [742]
