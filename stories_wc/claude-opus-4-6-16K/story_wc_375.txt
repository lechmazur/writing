Maren's fingers were still black with charcoal, though she hadn't sketched a portrait in three years. [16] The stains had become part of her skin, permanent as the memory of every face she'd ever drawn - and she remembered them all. [37] Every crease, every shadow beneath every eye. [44] That was the curse of being mnemonically gifted: nothing faded. [54]

She worked as a guide in the Vaalheim Crystal Caves, leading tourists through subterranean chambers where selenite columns caught lamplight and threw it back in fractured rainbows. [81] She narrated geological timelines, pointed out formations shaped like wings or hands, and smiled when children laughed at their own echoes bouncing through the corridors. [106]

It was after the last echo of laughter faded that the caves became hers. [119]

The final tour group had filed out at six, their voices thinning up the stone stairway until silence sealed itself behind them. [140] Maren stood alone in the Cathedral Chamber, surrounded by crystals that grew like frozen dawn - pale rose, amber, the faintest violet - and felt the familiar ache settle behind her sternum. [170]

She had come underground to escape the calling. [178] Three years ago she'd locked her supplies in a metal box, spun the combination lock, and shoved it behind the painting in her mother's old apartment - a watercolor landscape that hung crooked over the hallway radiator. [211] Something behind that painting would stay hidden, she'd told herself. [222] She would stop drawing faces. [227] She would stop remembering why each one mattered. [234]

Her mother's face. [237] The last portrait. [240] The one she'd sketched from the hospital bed, charcoal trembling, capturing the architecture of leaving. [254]

But inescapable callings do not obey combination locks, and the memory of that final sketch followed her underground the way water follows gravity. [276] She remembered the exact sequence, 14-31-07, though it no longer mattered. [287] When she'd finally retrieved the box last week, desperate and shaking, the lock was broken. [301] Someone - perhaps a new tenant, perhaps time itself - had cracked the mechanism. [313] The hasp hung open like a dislocated jaw. [321]

Inside she found her charcoals, her kneaded eraser, her chamois cloth. [332] And beneath them, the portrait of her mother - unfinished. [341] She had remembered it as complete. [347] For the first time, her perfect memory had lied to her, or perhaps she had lied to it. [364]

Now Maren sat cross-legged on the cave floor with the portrait balanced on her knees. [378] The crystals around her pulsed with the amber glow of her lantern, and she saw in their light what she needed to rectify: not the drawing itself, but the refusal to finish it. [410] She had stopped mid-stroke at the corner of her mother's mouth, where the expression hovered between pain and some private, luminous amusement. [432] To complete it, she would have to choose which way that mouth resolved. [444]

She lifted a charcoal stick. [449] Her fingers found their old grip as if muscle memory had been waiting, coiled and patient. [464] The first stroke sent a whisper across the paper, and the cave magnified it into something almost vocal. [481]

She drew. [483] The crystals watched. [486] Time dissolved into the scratch and blend of carbon on fiber, and Maren let herself remember fully - not just the geometry of her mother's face but the warmth of the room, the smell of cut roses on the windowsill, the terrible tenderness of documenting someone you love in the act of disappearing. [530]

The mouth resolved into a smile. [536] Not joyful, not sad - something between, like the sky in that trembling moment before sunrise when darkness acknowledges it has lost and light has not yet claimed victory. [564]

Maren held the finished portrait at arm's length. [572] The crystals behind it caught the lantern and crowned her mother's likeness in pale fire. [585] She felt something uncork inside her chest - not happiness, but flow. [596] The suppressed creativity she had buried came flooding upward, warm and aching and irresistible, filling every hollow she'd carved trying to contain it. [617]

She would draw again. [621] She understood that now. [626] The calling had waited three years in a box with a broken lock, behind a crooked painting, and then followed her into the deepest chamber of the earth. [653]

Some things cannot be locked away. [659] Some things grow, like crystals, in the dark. [667]
