The palace of Esagila had been reimagined three times since the last king fell, and now it stood between regimes, belonging to no one and therefore to everyone who dared enter its halls. [35]

Miriam crossed the threshold at dusk, when the light through the reconstructed ziggurat windows turned the color of old bronze. [55] She carried almost nothing: a leather satchel worn thin at the seams, a notebook filled with star charts, and a single magic square tile she had found buried in the courtyard rubble six months ago. [88] The tile was clay, ancient, inscribed with cuneiform numerals that summed to the same value in every direction -- fifteen, the number sacred to Ishtar. [111] Miriam had spent those six months trying to understand why it hummed faintly when she held it under starlight. [128]

She was, by all accounts, a frugal astronomer. [136] She stretched her grant money across years, repaired her own instruments, and slept in observatories rather than pay for lodging. [155] This austerity was not born of poverty but of principle: every coin saved was another night she could spend watching the sky without obligation to anyone. [180] The irony was empirically demonstrable -- she had published papers proving the expanding universe cared nothing for human devotion, yet she organized her entire life around devotion to that indifferent expanse. [207] She studied the void with the fervor of a mystic, and the void returned nothing, and she called this sufficient. [226]

But the tile had changed something. [232]

Inside the reimagined palace, the walls bore schematic representations of the old Babylonian cosmos: the firmament as a dome, the earth as a disk floating on sweet water, the stars as writing left by gods who had moved on. [267] Previous archaeologists had mapped the palace's iconography and dismissed it as primitive. [279] Miriam, however, had noticed that the schematics encoded something else beneath their surface cosmology. [292] When she overlaid her star charts onto the wall patterns, using the magic square tile as a cipher key, the constellations rearranged themselves into sequences that matched no known astronomical catalogue. [319] They were, she realized with a chill that had nothing to do with the desert evening, encrypted. [335]

Encrypted devotion -- that was the only phrase that fit. [344] Someone, millennia ago, had hidden prayers inside star maps, concealing worship within empirical observation so that it might survive the transition between regimes, when temples were razed and gods renamed. [373] The devotion was not to Marduk or Ishtar specifically but to the act of covenant itself, to the human need to seal a promise with something larger and unnamed. [400]

Miriam knelt on the cool stone floor and placed the tile against the largest schematic. [415] The wall depicted the full sky as seen from this latitude in approximately 580 BCE, but when the tile touched its surface, certain stars seemed to uncloak themselves from the background pattern, brightening in her perception as though they had been waiting. [454] She traced them with her finger, and they formed a spiral that pulled inward toward a center point where no star existed -- a deliberate absence, a space left open for whatever the unknown chose to become. [488]

Her hands trembled. [491] She was not a woman who believed in magic, and she would not start now. [506] But she believed in patterns, and this pattern was telling her that the ancient astronomers had faced the same void she faced every night and had responded not with despair but with an offer: we will keep watching, and in return, you will keep being worth watching. [550]

That was the covenant. [554]

She opened her notebook and began transcribing the uncloaked constellation, recording each position with the precision that had defined her career. [572] The dusky light through the windows dimmed further, and the real stars began to appear above the open courtyard, aligning with the ancient schematics in a harmony that felt composed rather than coincidental. [601] She worked for hours, the tile warm in her palm, the numerals on its face glowing faintly as if acknowledging her effort. [621]

When she finished, she had a complete cipher -- a method for reading devotion hidden in any star chart from any era. [643] She suspected that if she applied it to her own published observations, she would find the same spiral, the same absent center, the same open invitation. [668] The universe encoded no prayers on its own, but humans had been writing them into their measurements of it for as long as they had measured anything. [694]

Miriam placed the tile back in her satchel and stood. [704] Outside, the space between regimes continued, the palace unclaimed, the sky unconcerned. [716] She walked out into the courtyard where the stars hung thick and indifferent and beautiful, and she whispered the only covenant she knew: I will keep watching. [742]

The void said nothing, as was its custom. [750]

She found this sufficient. [754]
