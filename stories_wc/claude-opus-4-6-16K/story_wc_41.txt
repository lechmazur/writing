The fog sculpture garden had no sculptor. That was the first thing anyone learned about it, and the last thing they believed. [24]

Morrow had been coming here for eleven years, threading between the pale shapes that the marine fog carved and abandoned each morning along the coastline bluffs. [50] Some mornings the fog made arches. [56] Some mornings it made figures that resembled people he had not yet met but would, eventually, recognize in grocery stores and hospital waiting rooms. [76] He never remembered these premonitions until after they had already come true, which made them useless as warnings and devastating as memories. [95]

They called him the junkyard prophet down at the harbor. [105] He'd earned the name years ago by predicting, in fragments he couldn't recall predicting, the collapse of the old cannery, the beaching of the trawler Delphine, the fire at Harker's boatyard. [136] Each time, witnesses swore they'd heard him say something days before. [147] Each time, Morrow had no recollection whatsoever. [154] His gift was precognitively forgetful — visions that passed through him like radio signals through a wall, leaving only the faintest thermal trace. [172]

This morning he moved through the garden carrying a piece of plain chalk in his coat pocket, the same stick he'd been wearing down for weeks. [197] He used it to mark the bases of fog sculptures before they dissolved, drawing circles on the stone ground beneath them as if to prove they had existed. [226] Clinging to echoes — that was what his life had become. [236] The fog would shape something extraordinary, hold it for an hour, then let it go, and all Morrow could do was mark where it had stood. [261]

He was trying to locate a particular sound. [269] Not a fog shape this time, but something he'd heard once at the edge of the garden, a frequency that lived in the space between the crash of waves and the silence after. [300] He believed it was the sound of growing older — the actual acoustic signature of time metabolizing a human life. [318] He'd heard it the morning his daughter turned thirty and stopped calling. [329] He'd heard it again the day he found his own hands too stiff to open a jar. [345] If he could capture it, record it, hold it outside himself, maybe he could stop carrying it inside. [362]

To find the exact spot where the sound had last occurred, he'd been arranging driftwood as directional markers along the bluff paths. [381] Pale, salt-bleached limbs pointed inward from the garden's perimeter like the hands of a broken clock converging on some unmarked center. [400] Each piece of driftwood was chosen for its curve, its suggestion of gesture, so that the arrangement became a kind of language — an arrow system legible only to someone who understood longing as a form of navigation. [435]

The timeframe of his search existed amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched — that specific quality of silence that belongs to recorded moments no one will ever play again. [465] His ex-wife's tapes were still stacked in his trailer, labeled in her handwriting: "Sophie's First Steps," "Christmas '04," "Beach Day." [484] He hadn't watched them in years. [489] Their silence had become louder than anything on them. [498] That was the frequency he was chasing: the sound of a life continuing past the point where anyone was paying attention to it. [519]

This morning the fog made something new. [526] A shape near the garden's center, where six driftwood markers converged, rose slowly into a form that resembled a doorway. [545] Morrow approached it with the chalk already in his hand. [555] Through the doorway shape, he could see the ocean, gray and breathing. [566] And there — just at the threshold — he heard it. [575]

A low hum, tidal, almost sub-audible. [581] It wasn't sad exactly. [585] It was the sound of something that had once been loud learning to be quiet. [598] The sound of a wave that has already broken continuing to move toward shore. [611]

He pressed the chalk to the stone beneath the fog doorway and drew his circle. [626] The fog was already thinning. [631] In minutes the shape would be gone and he would have only the mark, another echo to cling to. [649]

But this time he also had the frequency in his ears, resonating against his sternum like a second heartbeat. [666] He closed his eyes. [669] He would forget this too, probably. [674] The prophecy of his own aging would pass through him and leave only a chalk ring on stone. [690]

Still, for one moment, standing in the dissolving garden with driftwood arrows pointing at his feet, Morrow held the sound of time inside his chest and did not let go. [720]

The fog exhaled. [723]

The circle remained. [726]
