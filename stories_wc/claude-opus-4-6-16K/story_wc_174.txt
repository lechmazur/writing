The radar dome had been dead for eleven years, its great white shell cracked along the meridian like a halved skull, letting in a single blade of starlight that fell across the concrete floor. [37] Marcus Adell sat beneath that blade, cross-legged, uncommonly serene for a man who had just been screamed at by his oldest collaborator. [57]

The argument's echo still lived in the dome's acoustics, a faint ringing that took minutes to fully die. [73] Petra had called his work exploitative. [79] She had called his puppet shows a con, said he was mining other people's trauma for barroom applause, and then she had walked out through the dome's service door into the desert night. [108] Now there was only the hush, and Marcus sitting in it, turning the campfire story stick over in his ink-stained hands. [128]

He was, by training and temperament, an urbane calligrapher. [137] For fifteen years he had lettered wedding invitations and museum placards in a bright studio in Portland, his life measured in nibs and guidelines and the elegant certainty of Copperplate script. [163] Beautiful work. [165] Meaningless work, he had come to believe. [172] Letters that said nothing he cared about, penned with exquisite precision for people who would frame them and never read them again. [192]

The puppet shows had started as penance. [199] He would travel to the seediest bars he could find, desert roadhouses and dock-town dives, and set up a battered cardboard theater on whatever table the bartender allowed. [227] The puppets were crude, stitched from shop rags, their faces drawn in his impeccable calligraphic hand, so each one wore an expression of unsettling beauty. [252] And then he would tell stories. [258] Not comfortable stories. [261] Stories about the people in those bars, or people like them, stories about addiction and betrayal and the small, corrosive lies families tell to survive. [284] He told them through the puppets so the audience could laugh, could pretend it was fiction, could feel the half-lit epiphany flickering at the edge of recognition without having to stare directly into it. [316]

The campfire story stick had been a gift from a Navajo veteran in a bar outside Gallup. [332] Carved cottonwood, notched along its length, each notch a prompt for the next beat of a tale. [349] The man had pressed it into Marcus's hands after a show and said, "You're close to something true, but you're not there yet." [372]

Marcus had carried it for two years, running his thumb along the notches before every performance, letting each groove suggest a turn in the narrative. [396] It had become his compass. [401] And tonight, in the decommissioned radar dome where he and Petra had set up a residency to develop new material, she had accused him of using that compass to navigate other people's pain for his own artistic gratification. [438]

The worst part was that she was half right. [447]

He traced the stick's seventh notch, the one he always associated with reversal. [459] In story structure, the reversal was where the protagonist's understanding inverted, where the thing they believed was revealed as its opposite. [479] He had built dozens of puppet shows around that mechanic. [489] But he had never applied it to himself. [497]

What if ethical storytelling meant reversing the lens entirely? [506] Not telling stories about the people in the bar, but giving them the puppets, letting them tell their own? [525] His role could shrink from performer to calligrapher again, but this time the letters would matter. [541] He could letter their words, shape their scripts, hold the frame while they filled it. [556]

The starlight through the dome's crack shifted as the earth turned, and for a moment the entire interior held a pale, meteor-hush glow, the light of something burning far away. [586] Marcus felt the epiphany arrive not as a thunderclap but as a half-lit thing, a candle seen through fog. [605] He understood that his serene composure after Petra's fury was not strength. [616] It was the stillness of a man who had been performing equanimity the same way he performed other people's suffering, with beautiful control and no real skin in the game. [645]

He set the story stick down on the concrete, stood, and walked to the service door. [661] The desert air was cool and tasted of creosote. [670] Petra was sitting on the hood of their van, arms folded, staring at the sky. [685]

"You were right," he said. [690] "I want to reverse the whole thing. [697] I want to hand the stage over." [703]

She looked at him for a long time. [711] "That terrifies you," she said. [717]

"Yes." [718]

"Good." [719] She slid off the hood. [724] "That's where the real story starts." [730]

Above them, the cracked dome caught starlight and held it, a broken receiver still listening for signals it was never designed to understand. [752]
