The first time Maren knocked on the door of apartment 4C, she carried an empty measuring cup and a rehearsed smile. She needed sugar, she said. What she needed was access to the rooftop garden, and everyone in the building knew that old Cassia Volk held the only key. [50]

Cassia answered in a housecoat the color of dried lavender, her eyes sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses that magnified them into something owlish and knowing. She measured sugar into Maren's cup with hands that were patiently nimble, each movement precise yet unhurried, as though she had spent decades perfecting the economy of small gestures. [100]

"You'll come back," Cassia said. It was not a question. [110]

Maren came back the following Tuesday, again with the empty cup. Cassia already had the kettle on. By the third visit, neither of them mentioned sugar at all, and the agreed upon lie had calcified into ritual: weekly tea sessions in Cassia's apartment, surrounded by towers of books in languages Maren could not read. [157]

Cassia, it turned out, had been a dead language tutor for forty years. Sumerian, Akkadian, Old Church Slavonic, Linear B--she had made her living breathing air into collapsed vocabularies, teaching graduate students to hear voices that had gone silent centuries ago. She was retired now, officially, but retirement had not dulled her. [207]

"You don't want sugar," Cassia said during their fourth session, pouring Earl Grey into mismatched cups. "You want something from this building." [228]

Maren set down her tea. "I want to learn the language of old buildings." [241]

She explained. She was an architectural conservator. The building they both lived in--a former textile warehouse from 1887--was scheduled for renovation, and the developers wanted everything modernized. Maren had been hired to document what would be lost. But documentation felt insufficient. She wanted to understand what the building was saying: the mason's marks above the lintels, the foundry stamps on the cast-iron columns, the faded painted advertisements on the eastern wall that she could only half decipher. [318]

Cassia studied her for a long moment. "Those are dead languages too," she said quietly. [332]

After that, the tea sessions moved to the rooftop garden, where Cassia kept herbs in terra-cotta pots arranged among salvaged chimney caps. She began to teach Maren how to interrogate a building the way a philologist interrogates a text: layer by layer, seeking grammar in the mortar joints, syntax in the cornice profiles, dialect in the irregularities of hand-pressed brick. [387]

"Every building lies," Cassia told her one evening, turning an antique desk seal over in her fingers. The seal was brass, engraved with intertwined initials--C.H.V., the original warehouse owner. Cassia had found it years ago wedged behind a baseboard. "It lies about its age, its purpose, its owners. But the lies are agreed upon. The developers will simply replace them with new ones." [443]

Maren understood. Renovation was just another layer of fiction pressed onto stone. [454]

The night of the meteor shower, they sat on the rooftop together, wrapped in wool blankets. The herbs smelled of rosemary and thyme, and the sky cracked open in bright, silent streaks. Cassia handed Maren the desk seal. [491]

"Keep it," she said. "It belongs to whoever listens." [500]

Maren closed her fingers around the brass. It was warm, as though it had been held for a long time. [517]

"Teach me Sumerian," Maren said, surprising herself. [524]

Cassia laughed, a sound like a door opening in an old house. "Why?" [535]

"Because I want to hear something that isn't lying." [543]

"Everything lies, dear. Sumerian lied beautifully. That's why it lasted." [553]

A meteor drew a long phosphorescent line above them, and for a moment the rooftop garden was illuminated in pale green, every leaf and chimney cap and terra-cotta rim sharply visible, as though the building itself had opened its eyes. [593]

They began the following Tuesday. Cassia wrote cuneiform on index cards with the same patiently nimble hands that had measured sugar months before, and Maren sounded out syllables that had not been spoken conversationally in four thousand years. Between lessons, they walked the building together, and Cassia translated its silences the way she translated dead scripts--with rigor, with tenderness, with the understanding that preservation is just the most beautiful of all agreed upon lies. [664]

The developers came in spring. Walls were opened, columns wrapped in plastic. Maren's documentation filled three binders. But on the rooftop, the herbs still grew among the chimney caps, and every Tuesday the kettle boiled, and two women sat among languages the living world had forgotten, listening for what the old walls chose to say next. [718]

The sugar cup gathered dust on a shelf in apartment 4C, its purpose long since outlived, its lie long since agreed upon and beloved. [742]
