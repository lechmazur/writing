The glade existed where no glade should—a disc of moss and silver birch suspended in the architecture of clouds, accessible only at midnight, only to those carrying enough grief to weigh them upward instead of down. [37] Sable found it the way her grandmother's cards had promised: by climbing until the earth forgot her. [53]

She was an onyx-ink cartomancer, the last in a lineage that read futures not from printed decks but from cards hand-painted with ink so black it seemed to swallow the lamplight. [83] She had read thousands of fortunes for strangers, but she had never read one for herself. [101] That was the rule. [105] That was also the wound. [110]

She had come here after the birth. [117] Three days after her daughter entered the world screaming, Sable left her in her sister's arms and ascended the mountain path that threaded above the cloudline, following a pull she could neither name nor resist. [152] The midwife had placed the infant on her chest, and in that raw, annihilating moment Sable had understood with terrible clarity how much time she had already lost—years spent bent over strangers' palms while her own life went unwitnessed. [192] She needed to find where lost time accumulates. [200] Because it must go somewhere. [205] That was what the cards insisted. [211]

The glade smelled of rain that had never touched soil. [221] Moonlight fell through breaks in the vapor like columns in a ruined cathedral, and the beauty of it was so acute it closed around her throat. [247] She set down her satchel and knelt on the moss, which was cold and alive beneath her knees. [265]

From the satchel she drew the objects of her craft: her onyx-ink cards, a candle, and a single saucer from a dolls' tea set—porcelain, painted with faded roses, split by a hairline crack that ran from rim to center like a road on a map. [311] It had been hers as a child, then her mother's before that, carried through decades as a vessel of small, domestic magic. [333] The crack had appeared the year her mother died, and Sable had never repaired it. [348] She suspected the crack was the point. [355]

She placed the saucer at the center of her spread and began to unfasten the leather cord that bound her deck. [376] The cards spilled out, each one drinking the moonlight with its onyx surface. [389] She laid them in the pattern her grandmother had taught her—not a Celtic cross, not a star, but the shape of a traced hand. [414]

This was the method: a family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths. [427] Every year, at every birthday, the women in her family would press their palms to the white cloth and trace around their fingers with whatever was near—pencil, crayon, the tip of a burnt match. [462] The tablecloths accumulated years of overlapping hands, growing larger, the fingers lengthening, the tracings layered like geological strata. [480] Sable had adapted this ritual into her readings. [488] She placed each card where a finger would fall, building a hand-shaped constellation of meaning. [503]

The reading that emerged left her willingly perplexed. [511] She did not fight the confusion. [517] She leaned into it the way one leans into fog, trusting that the obscurity itself was the message. [535] The cards told her that lost time does not pool in some recoverable reservoir. [549] It accumulates here—in glades above clouds, in the spaces between exhaled prayers, in the hairline cracks of inherited porcelain. [569] It becomes the beauty that chokes you. [576] It becomes the moonlight in the moss. [583]

Cloudbound repentance, her grandmother would have called it. [591] The understanding that sorrow over wasted years is itself a kind of altitude, lifting you to places you could not otherwise reach. [613] You do not get the time back. [620] You get the glade. [624]

Sable gathered her cards. [628] She pressed her palm flat against the moss and traced around it with her finger, leaving no visible mark but knowing the glade would remember. [653] Then she tucked the cracked saucer back into her satchel, stood, and began the long descent through clouds that parted like curtains around her shoulders. [678] Below, her daughter was three days old and waiting. [687] The time ahead was not a replacement for the time behind, but it was time, and it was hers, and she would not spend it reading other people's futures. [716] The crack in the saucer caught the last of the moonlight as she walked—a thin, luminous line, beautiful enough to stop the breath, pointing the way home. [744]
