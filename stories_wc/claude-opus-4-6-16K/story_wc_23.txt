The hydraulics failed on a Tuesday, and after that the dishes stopped turning. [14]

Maren stood in the control room of the Vostok Signal Station and watched the great radio telescopes freeze mid-arc, their parabolic faces locked toward a sky that no longer needed them. [44] The government had decommissioned the array six months ago, but the hydraulics had kept the dishes drifting on their own, groaning through slow rotations like sunflowers tracking a dead star. [72] Now even that ghost motion was gone. [79]

She was what they called a patchwork navigator—someone who had stitched together credentials from maritime charts, amateur radio licenses, ham operator logs, and two semesters of astrophysics she never finished after her daughter disappeared. [110] None of it made her qualified for anything official. [119] All of it made her qualified for this: standing alone on a concrete platform beneath the Milky Way, trying to build a receiver from salvage. [142]

The signal station sprawled across a plateau in northern Manitoba, a place so remote that the stars pressed down like a weight. [165] Maren had arrived three weeks after the decommission notice, driving a truck loaded with wire, soldering irons, and a patina bronze censer foot she'd found in her daughter's apartment—the only object left behind when Lila vanished. [201] The censer foot was heavy, ornate, green-black with age, its three clawed toes gripping nothing. [215] Maren kept it on the console beside her logbook because it was the last thing Lila had touched, and because its weight in her hand was the closest she came to holding her child. [247]

She was not building a radio telescope. [254] She was building a listening post. [260]

The calls had started four months ago—cryptic phone calls at midnight, always from unlisted numbers, always the same pattern: a burst of static, then a voice reading coordinates. [289] The voice was not Lila's, but it spoke about Lila. [300] It spoke about reverse migration, about people who had walked away from their lives and followed some invisible meridian south, then east, then into silence. [323] The caller used that phrase—reverse migration—as though it were a known phenomenon, a seasonal pattern of human disappearance that fluctuated with moon phases, swelling at the full moon and ebbing at the new. [356] Maren had plotted the coordinates on a map and found they traced a line from Winnipeg to Churchill to a point in the tundra that did not correspond to any road or settlement. [390] The line ended at the signal station. [397]

So she came here to listen. [403]

Night after night she soldered connections, spliced cables, and aimed the one dish she'd managed to free from its frozen mount. [424] She used the censer foot as a paperweight against the prairie wind, pinning down her frequency charts. [440] She used it as a plumb bob when she needed to level the receiver housing. [454] The bronze grew colder each night as autumn deepened, and she wrapped her fingers around it and felt the ache travel up her arms into her chest where it belonged. [483]

The phone rang again at midnight on the night she finished. [494] Static, then coordinates—the same coordinates, the station's own position, folded back on itself like a message saying you are already where you need to be. [520] Then the voice said a single new word: Listen. [529]

Maren climbed the gantry to the dish. [536] The sky was savage with stars. [542] She powered the receiver and heard, beneath the cosmic background hiss, a pattern—a rhythm that rose and fell like breathing. [561] It fluctuated, she realized, with the moon. [568] Tonight the moon was full, and the signal was strong, and it carried something she had never expected: not Lila's voice, but Lila's presence, encoded in a frequency that mapped the geography of loss itself—every parent who had searched, every child who had walked away, every line drawn on a map that ended in open air. [620]

She pressed the censer foot against her sternum and let the cold bronze anchor her. [635] The signal was not a rescue. [641] It was not a resolution. [646] It was proof that the distance between her and her daughter was not empty, that the space itself held shape and texture and could be navigated if you were willing to build the instrument patient enough to hear it. [682]

Maren sat in the raw solace of that knowing, the stars pouring their ancient light across the frozen dishes, and she listened until the moon began to set and the signal thinned to a whisper she would chase again tomorrow night, and the night after, building and rebuilding her patchwork understanding of a world that took her daughter but did not take her daughter's trace. [740]

The hydraulics had failed, and nothing turned anymore except Maren herself, slowly, toward something she could almost name. [758]
