The orchard had not borne fruit in forty years, but its trees still stood like crooked fingers reaching from the crater floor toward a sky that remembered warmth. [30]

Elska knelt among them, her breath a slow ghost in the subarctic air, arranging apple stems and brittle leaves into spiraling patterns on the frozen earth. [56] She worked with the deliberate patience of someone who understood that rushing would unravel everything -- her hands steady, her spine curved forward for hours without complaint, her knees pressed into ground so cold it burned through her wool trousers. [92] This was the discipline of a flash-paper alchemist: to handle materials that could ignite and vanish in an instant, one had to move as though time itself had agreed to wait. [122]

The patterns she created from discarded things -- fallen bark, shed feathers, the skeletal remains of blossoms decades dead -- were not decoration. [143] They were cartography. [146] Each arrangement corresponded to a rhythm she had measured against her own sternum that morning, pressing her fingertips to the hollow of her throat and counting. [170] Sixty-two beats per minute at rest, quickening to seventy-eight when she thought of her daughter, slowing to fifty-one when she listened to the orchard's silence. [195] She translated these heartbeats into maps: the faster rhythms became tight clusters, the slower ones wide arcs, and together they charted invisible geographies of feeling across the crater floor. [223]

Tonight was the night the world held its breath. [232] Every seven years, the subarctic sky paused between magnetic storms, and for a span of hours the aurora neither advanced nor retreated. [254] The stars, usually veiled by curtains of green and violet light, became fully bare. [267] Their light fell unfiltered into the crater, striking the withered branches with a clarity that made the dead wood glow as though remembering its living grain. [291]

Elska had come here for this light. [297]

From her satchel she withdrew a copper plate no larger than a hymnal, its surface etched with a storybook illustration -- a child walking through an orchard in bloom, reaching for an apple just beyond her fingers. [331] Her daughter Maren had loved this image before the fever took her ability to see it. [346] Now Maren lived in a city hospital four hundred kilometers south, blind and waiting, and Elska had promised to bring her something no doctor could provide. [370]

She positioned the plate at the center of her largest pattern, where the heartbeat-map converged into a single point -- the rhythm that had belonged to Maren's name. [396] Then she opened her alchemist's case. [402]

Inside lay sheets of flash-paper, each one treated with compounds that could capture and hold luminous energy for a fraction of a second before combusting. [425] Ordinary flash-paper, anyway. [429] Elska had spent three years reformulating the substrate, testing batch after batch, failing and beginning again with the patience her craft demanded. [449] Her version did not burn. [454] It absorbed. [456]

She layered the treated sheets over the copper plate, pressing them against the etched illustration with gloved hands. [471] The starlight, channeled by the pattern of discarded orchard remnants arranged in cardiac geometries around her, began to concentrate. [490] She could feel it gathering the way one feels a held breath in a quiet room -- not as sound, but as pressure, as presence. [513]

The flash-paper drank the light. [518]

Elska waited, demonstrating her patience physically: she did not shift her weight, did not flex her fingers, did not blink against the cold that crystallized her eyelashes. [543] She held the plate as a mother holds a sleeping child, with force calibrated to protect without constraining. [559]

When the paper had absorbed enough starlight to illuminate a small room for a year, she peeled it away and pressed it firmly against the copper plate's surface, folding the edges with practiced precision. [591] The alchemical seal bonded light to metal, locking the glow into the etched grooves of the illustration. [607]

The storybook plate now shone from within. [614] The orchard in the image bloomed with captured starlight, every apple incandescent, the child's reaching hand bathed in a warmth the subarctic had forgotten. [637]

Maren would not need eyes to feel this. [645] She would press her fingers to the plate and trace the raised lines of the illustration, and the safekept starlight would warm her skin, and she would know that her mother had mapped the distance between heartbeats, walked into a dead orchard under a breathless sky, and returned with a piece of the heavens shaped exactly like home. [700]

Elska wrapped the plate in wool, held it against her chest, and began the long walk out of the crater. [719] Above her, the aurora stirred again, and the world resumed its breathing. [732]
