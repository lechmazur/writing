The amber light of the observatory deck came not from any star but from the residue of ten billion years of stellar death compressed into a warm, honeyed glow. [29] After the universe contracted, light had nowhere left to go. [39] It pooled. [41]

Maren sat cross-legged on the deck, her collection of foreign coins spread before her in a crescent. [58] Coins from civilizations that no longer existed, minted in metals that had since unbonded into elementary particles. [75] She kept them because they were impossible - relics that should have dissolved when their home worlds unmade themselves during the contraction. [96] Yet here they were: solid, cold, and stamped with faces of rulers whose empires had already un-happened. [113]

She was a cast lots decision maker. [120] That was her title, her function, her only remaining authority aboard the observatory. [133] When the remaining crew of eleven needed to choose - which corridor to seal, which oxygen reserve to tap, which frequency to monitor - they came to Maren. [159] She would shake the coins in her cupped hands, let them fall, and read the scatter. [175] Heads, tails, edges, the angles between them. [182] Chance as governance. [185] It was the only system that still made sense when causality had started running in reverse. [201]

That was the nature of the backwards prophecy. [209] Since the contraction, every prediction pointed not forward but behind. [219] The static bursts that pulsed through the observatory's receivers carried fragments of events that had already occurred - or rather, events that were un-occurring, unraveling back toward the origin point. [248] Maren's task was to distill meaning from these signals, to parse the noise into something the crew could act upon. [268] Understanding static bursts was not intuition and not quite science. [278] It was more like listening to a symphony played in reverse and trying to feel where the composer had wept. [298]

She was quietly enthusiastic about this work, though she would never have said so aloud. [313] Enthusiasm felt obscene when the cosmos was folding itself into nothing. [324] But there was a private thrill in each burst she decoded, each coin she cast. [339] She felt closest to something true in those moments - as if the randomness of the lots and the backward logic of the prophecy were two halves of a language she was only beginning to learn. [374]

Her motivation was simple and impossible: to wavelength align with purpose. [385] Not to find meaning imposed from outside, but to adjust her own frequency until it resonated with whatever intent - if any - still hummed beneath the collapsing architecture of spacetime. [414] The coins helped. [417] Each one carried the electromagnetic signature of its origin world, faint but measurable. [430] When she cast them, their overlapping signatures created interference patterns that she could map against the static bursts. [448] It was a crude instrument, but crude instruments were all that remained. [460]

Tonight - if night still meant anything - the static had changed. [470] The bursts were arriving faster, their intervals shrinking. [478] Maren spread the coins again. [483] A copper disk from Verath-9 landed on its edge. [492] A silver octagon from the Pellen Reach spun twice before settling face-down. [504] The titanium sliver from Earth - old, battered Earth - rolled to the edge of the crescent and stopped. [521]

She studied the pattern. [525] The backwards prophecy forming in the static told her something had already unhappened that the crew hadn't noticed yet. [544] A corridor they thought was sealed had un-sealed. [552] An oxygen reserve they thought was full had un-filled. [561] The contraction was accelerating, and the observatory was losing coherence faster than projected. [574]

Maren gathered the coins slowly, one by one, feeling their impossible weight. [586] Stellar doubt pressed against her ribs - the old, heavy question of whether any of this mattered when the endpoint was already written, or un-written, or both. [612] Whether aligning with purpose was just another way of refusing to accept purposelessness. [625]

She stood. [627] The amber light pooled around her feet. [634]

She would tell the crew. [639] She would cast the lots again when they asked her what to do. [652] And she would listen to the static, because even in a universe running backward toward its own extinction, someone had to choose what came next. [677] Even if next was yesterday. [682] Even if the coins fell the same way twice. [691]

Especially then. [693]
