The copperlight comes every evening at the same hour, when the sun drops low enough to pour through the lighthouse lens and flood the curved walls with amber. [28] In that light, even a prison can feel like a cathedral. [39] Maren knows this. [42] He has counted the copperlight hours for eleven months now, locked in the lighthouse prison off the jagged reef they call the Teeth. [65] He is the son of the boy who cried wolf - not metaphorically, but literally, the child of Peder Dahlgren, who three times raised the village alarm for wolves that weren't there, and who was torn apart the fourth time while neighbors shut their windows. [109] Maren inherited nothing from his father but a surname and the certainty that no one would ever believe a word he said. [131]

This is why the bodies are still unfound. [139]

He reported them. [142] He told the harbormaster about the three fishermen weighted and sunk in the shallows east of the reef. [160] He described the stones lashed to their ankles, the way their hair moved like seagrass. [175] The harbormaster laughed. [178] The constable laughed. [181] When Maren insisted, when he shouted and grabbed lapels, they decided he was dangerous - a liar's son gone mad - and they locked him in the lighthouse prison, which had stood mostly empty for decades, its narrow door left ajar to the salt wind because no one thought anyone would ever need confining there again. [235]

Now Maren lives inside the scuffs on that narrow door - the scratches and gouges left by every desperate hand that ever gripped its edge. [259] He traces them nightly. [263] Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades, he reads the stories of prior prisoners the way a blind man reads raised letters. [289] Each groove is a sentence. [294] Each gouge is a confession. [299] He is learning to thread a labyrinth with his own story, to add his marks to theirs, to carve a path someone might one day follow back to the truth. [329]

The lighthouse sustains impossibilities. [333] That is its nature. [337] It holds light above water. [342] It makes stone hover over the sea - or seem to, when fog swallows the reef and the tower floats free against the sky. [365] Some nights Maren watches the beam rotate and feels the walls breathing, as if the building itself is alive, as if it remembers every keeper and every prisoner and holds their voices in its spiral bones. [401]

On the third landing, bolted to the curved wall, there is a lattice from a confessional - oak, darkened with age, carved with diamond shapes just wide enough to speak through. [431] It was salvaged from a chapel ship that broke apart on the Teeth sixty years ago. [447] Someone mounted it here between two cells as a joke or a cruelty or an act of strange mercy: prisoners could whisper to each other without seeing a face. [476] Maren presses his forehead to the lattice nightly now and speaks to no one. [490] He confesses everything. [493] He describes the bodies. [497] He names the man he believes killed them - the harbormaster's own brother, whose boat came back light three times in one week. [519]

He is chasing hush. [523] Not silence - hush. [526] The particular quality of quiet that follows a truth finally spoken aloud, the stillness after confession when the world holds still and decides what it has heard. [553] He has never reached it. [558] Every night the wind fills the gap where absolution should be. [569]

But the copperlight returns. [573] The copper glow slides over the lattice and turns its diamonds into a hundred small suns, and in that warmth Maren hovers between despair and something almost like repose. [602] He knows time is his. [607] The tides are shifting. [611] The winter storms will drag the shallows bare, and the weighted fishermen will surface from their graves of sand, and someone will stand on the eastern shore and see what Maren saw. [643] Before they find the bodies, he must finish his labyrinth. [653] He carves another line into the door each night - his testimony in wood. [666] When they come, when they finally believe, they will find his story threaded through every surface of this tower, scored into oak and stone, impossible to deny. [693]

The copperlight holds him. [697] The lighthouse breathes. [700] Maren speaks into the lattice, and somewhere beneath the dark water, the dead are patient, waiting to be believed. [719]
