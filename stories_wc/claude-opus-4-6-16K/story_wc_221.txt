The observation deck had been silent for eleven years, or three months, depending on which clock you trusted. [18]

Maren trusted neither. [21]

She stood at the curved viewport where the time dilation field still hummed faintly, a remnant charge that the shutdown had failed to fully drain. [43] Beyond the glass, stars moved at a pace imperceptible to anyone who hadn't spent a decade temporally stretched, watching constellations crawl like slow rivers across an impossible sky. [70] But Maren had spent that decade here, and she could see them breathing. [82]

They called her the blessed pariah. [88] Blessed because she had survived the Kaelen Station collapse when forty-seven others had not. [101] Pariah because surviving meant she had been inside the dilation chamber when the field locked, which meant she had aged three months while the rest of humanity aged eleven years, which meant she was now a stranger to every person she had ever loved. [143]

Her daughter, Lise, would be nineteen now. [150] Maren had last held her at eight, pressing a small gilded compass rose applique into her palm, the kind you'd sew onto a jacket or a bag. [177] It had belonged to Maren's mother, and her mother before that, passed along with a single instruction: always know where true north is, even when the world spins. [206]

Maren had not known where true north was for a long time. [218]

After the shutdown, the rescue teams had pried open the deck and found her sketching. [232] They'd looked at her notebook with a mixture of pity and confusion: page after page of star fields, meticulously drawn, each one dated. [254] She had not missed a single anniversary. [261]

It was a family custom, one her grandmother had started during the long winters in Tromso. [276] Every year on the anniversary of her marriage, her grandmother would take a blanket outside, lie on the frozen ground, and sketch the night sky exactly as it appeared. [303] Maren's mother had continued the tradition. [310] Maren had continued it aboard Kaelen Station, sketching the sky on the anniversary of Lise's birth, even as time pooled and thickened around her, even as each drawing captured a sky that no one else on the station could see because no one else was living at her speed. [358]

The rescue crew had asked her why. [365] She told them it was the only thing that turned confusion into exploration. [377] When the dilation field had locked and she realized she was trapped, she had screamed for days. [393] Then she had picked up her pencil and looked up. [403]

Each sketch was a glimpse of the universe from a vantage point no human was meant to occupy. [420] Stars slightly shifted. [423] Nebulae marginally rotated. [426] The drawings, placed in sequence, became a flipbook of cosmic motion that astronomers later called the most valuable observational dataset produced in a generation. [449]

Maren did not care about the dataset. [456]

She cared that on page forty-seven, she had drawn a small compass rose in the margin because she had been thinking about Lise. [477] She cared that on page ninety-one, she had written "true north" beside a star she could not identify, a star that seemed to pulse in a rhythm that reminded her of her daughter's heartbeat heard through a stethoscope at a routine checkup, steady and defiant. [522]

Now she stood on the dead deck, the hum fading further each day, holding Lise's reply letter in hands that had barely aged. [545] Lise was nineteen and had written in a voice Maren did not recognize, mature and careful, but she had taped something to the bottom of the page. [574]

The gilded compass rose applique, slightly tarnished, its edges softened by years of being carried in a pocket. [591]

Beneath it, in handwriting that still slanted left the way it had when Lise was eight, a single line: "I kept it so you could find your way back." [620]

Maren pressed the applique to her chest and looked out through the viewport at the stars she had sketched so many times they felt like family. [648] The echoed silence of the deck held her gently, the way deep water holds a diver. [664] She was temporally stretched, displaced, a woman unstuck. [673] But she had her drawings, her compass rose, and a daughter who had not forgotten. [687]

She opened her notebook to a fresh page and began to sketch the sky as it appeared tonight, the first drawing made from the other side of the shutdown, the first one that belonged to the same time as her daughter. [726]

True north, she thought, was never a direction. [735]

It was whoever waited for you on the other side of silence. [747]
