The birds had flown south three weeks ago, and Maren was the only person in the district who seemed to notice that the sky had gone silent. [28]

She noticed everything. [31] That was her particular affliction, the thing that made her useless at dinner parties and indispensable to no one. [49] She noticed when the post office changed its hours by eleven minutes. [60] She noticed when the old fountain in Barris Square stopped running and no one mentioned it, as though it had never run at all. [80] She noticed when the Korvath Bakery vanished overnight, its storefront replaced by a blank wall that neighbors walked past without blinking, and she was the only one who still had a loaf of their bread in her kitchen, going stale, proving something had existed. [120]

Creeping normality, she called it. [125] The world revised itself in tiny increments, and people's memories revised along with it, and Maren stood outside the current like a stone the river couldn't smooth. [150]

She carried the bread wrapped in cloth inside her satchel as she pushed through the overgrown gate of the old Empress's palace. [172] The grounds had been abandoned for decades, ivy swallowing the colonnades, moss felting the marble stairs. [187] But someone had been gardening here. [193] Not officially, not with permission. [198] Guerrilla gardening, the quiet kind, where someone plants lavender and rosemary in the cracks of empire and lets beauty uncloak itself through neglect. [219] Maren followed the trail of deliberately planted herbs through a corridor of wild jasmine until she found what she had been told to look for: the secret tea house in the overgrown courtyard. [250]

It was a single room with a collapsed wall open to the sky, a wooden table, mismatched cups, and a woman named Sable who was already pouring water from a kettle hung over a small fire. [285]

"You brought it?" Sable asked. [290]

Maren set the bread on the table. [297] Sable touched it with a reverence that made Maren's throat tighten. [308] "Korvath's sourdough," Sable said. [313] "I thought every trace was gone." [319]

"It's stale," Maren said. [323]

"It's evidence." [325]

Sable was heuristically gentle, Maren had learned over their handful of meetings. [336] She approached every truth sideways, by approximation, never forcing an insight but letting it arrive like a cat deciding to sit in your lap. [358] She had been the one to plant the garden paths that led here, embedding directions in rosemary and sage for those who could still read what the world was erasing. [387]

"They took the bakery because Korvath refused to change his recipe to their new flour," Sable explained, breaking a piece of the stale bread and placing it on a saucer like a sacrament. [417] "The new flour is how they dull the noticing. [426] It's in everything now. [430] Bread, pasta, the communion wafers at St. Elna's. [438] Everyone eats and everyone forgets a little more." [446]

Maren stared at the fragment of bread. [452] "And I haven't been eating it." [458]

"No. [459] You've been living on old stores and stubbornness." [467] Sable smiled. [469] "That's why you still see." [474]

The courtyard was quiet without birdsong. [480] Wind moved through the jasmine and carried the ghost of sweetness. [491] Maren understood now why she had come, not just to deliver evidence, but to find the sacred in the ordinary. [510] A loaf of bread. [514] A cup of tea poured by a stranger in a ruined palace. [525] The way rosemary grew between cracked stones as an act of resistance. [536]

"Can we undo it?" Maren asked. [542]

"We can uncloak it," Sable said. [548] "That's different. [550] We can show people what's been taken, piece by piece. [560] We plant the old seeds, bake with the old flour, leave bread where people will find it and remember. [577] But absolution for what's already been lost?" [584] She shook her head. [588] "That's tenuous. [590] We can't give back what people let themselves forget. [599] We can only make forgetting harder." [605]

Maren picked up her tea. [610] It tasted like thyme and smoke and something she couldn't name, something from before. [624] She drank it slowly, letting it uncloak the memory of a world where bakeries stayed, where birds didn't leave and get forgotten, where silence was something you chose rather than something that chose you. [657]

"Teach me to garden," Maren said. [663]

Sable handed her a packet of seeds. [670] "Start with the cracks," she said. [677] "That's where things grow best." [683]

They sat together as the afternoon light moved through the broken wall, two women eating stale bread as though it were holy, because it was the last honest thing either of them had, and because sometimes the sacred doesn't announce itself but simply waits in the ordinary for someone stubborn enough to notice.
