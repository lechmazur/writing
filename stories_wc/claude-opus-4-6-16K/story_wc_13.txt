Maren had mapped every canal that threaded between the towers, sketching the jade-colored water and the darting silver fish that lived nowhere else. [24] As a natural history illustrator, she had spent eleven years documenting the creatures of the Roofscape — the moths that drank condensation from copper gutters, the luminous fungi clinging to aqueduct stones — but the one phenomenon she could never capture was sound itself. [63] Specifically, echoes. [65]

She believed echoes were born somewhere. [71] Not reflected, not mere decayed repetitions of original noise, but living things released from a source. [85] Her mentor, Odile, had believed this too, and had died searching for proof, leaving behind only her journals and an infinity symbol pendant on a thin chain. [108]

The pendant sculpts time itself. [113] Maren had learned this slowly, accidentally, the way one learns the dangerous properties of a plant by brushing against it. [131] When she held the pendant and concentrated, she could borrow time — pull minutes from her future self and spend them now, stretching a moment into something navigable. [157] The cost was always paid later: sudden gaps, lost hours, a stutter in her own continuity. [172] But the gift was precision. [177] And precision was everything when you had only the duration of the giant's nap. [190]

The giant lay curled beneath the city's foundation, its breathing the deep metronome that governed the tides in the rooftop canals. [210] When it slept, the waters calmed. [216] When it stirred, waves surged between towers and the waterways became impassable. [227] Its naps lasted roughly three hours — sometimes less if thunder woke it or if the city's bells rang in an unfortunate sequence. [248]

That sequence mattered. [251] Maren had studied it for two years: the way the tower bells created a rhythm, a cadence that repeated and resolved predictably. [272] But sometimes — rarely — the cadence was interrupted. [279] A bell would crack, a rope would stick, and the expected resolution would not come. [293] In that gap, that silence where sound should have been, she heard something else. [307] A trembling. [309] A beginning. [311]

An interrupted cadence was where echoes were born. [319]

Tonight the giant had settled into deep sleep. [327] The canals lay mirror-still between the towers, and Maren paddled her shallow boat through them, the pendant warm against her sternum. [348] She had calculated the moment precisely: the Evening Carillon would ring from the six main towers in its usual pattern, but she had loosened the clapper bolt in the Fourth Tower's bell three days ago. [383] When the sequence reached its fourth note, there would be silence instead of sound. [396] A break in the cadence. [401] And in that break, she would find the birthplace. [410]

She borrowed time as she paddled — just a few minutes pulled from tomorrow morning — and the world around her slowed to honey. [432] The water barely rippled. [436] She watched a canal-bat frozen mid-wingbeat, its mouth open around an insect it would not swallow for another stretched second. [455] She sketched it from instinct, then pressed on. [463]

The bells began. [466] First Tower: a deep bronze tone rolling across the Roofscape. [476] Second Tower: a higher answer. [481] Third: the middle voice completing the chord's expectation. [489] Then — nothing. [491] The Fourth Tower's silence opened like a door. [499]

Maren felt it immediately. [503] The air above the canal between the Fourth and Fifth Towers began to vibrate, and from that vibration something emerged — not sound, but the precursor to sound. [530] Translucent shapes, curled like fiddlehead ferns, unspooled from the gap in the music. [543] They were echoes in their larval state, newborn and trembling, trapped inside the silence, waiting to attach themselves to any noise that came next. [567]

They were caged in the pause. [573] Held by the absence. [577]

Maren understood then what she had to do. [585] She could not merely document this. [591] She had to uncage them. [596] She struck her paddle against the gunwale of her boat — a sharp, clean note — and offered them something to carry. [617] The echo-ferns latched onto the sound, unfurled, and scattered across the Roofscape in every direction, alive and reverberating. [636]

She sketched furiously as they dispersed, capturing their spiraling forms before borrowed time caught up with her. [652] The pendant pulsed once, then cooled. [658] Below, the giant shifted, its breathing quickening toward wakefulness. [667] The canals began to ripple. [672]

But she had seen it. [677] She had found where echoes were born: in the space where expected sound fails to arrive, in the interrupted cadence of an imperfect world. [700] They were not reflections at all. [706] They were orphans of silence, waiting for someone to set them free. [718]

She closed her sketchbook as the waters rose, paddled home through the waking city, and began composing the plate she would paint — the first natural history illustration of silence giving birth to sound. [754]
