The dunes glowed amber and violet, bioluminescent flowers unfurling across sand that had not known shade since the last forest burned. [23] That was eleven years ago now, when the final canopy collapsed into ember and the sky wore ash for a season. [42] Since then, the world had become a place of open wounds and strange new blooms, and Harsk walked through it carrying a chess clock frozen at midnight. [67]

He had been a freight guard once, back when there were still trains threading through the green corridors between cities. [85] Now there was no freight to guard, no rails that hadn't buckled in the heat, and Harsk had not dreamed in seven years. [105] Sleep came to him like a shallow tide, washing in and pulling back without leaving anything behind -- no images, no stories, no ghosts. [126] His mind at night was a clean, dark room. [135] He envied no one their nightmares, but sometimes he missed the architecture of dreaming, the way a mind could build cathedrals from nothing and then forget them by morning. [161]

The chess clock had belonged to his daughter. [169] She had been eight when the forests burned, twelve when the coughing started, and gone before thirteen. [184] The clock had stopped at midnight the night she died, both flags fallen simultaneously, as though time itself had forfeited for both players. [203] He carried it in his coat pocket, and its weight was the only prayer he knew. [218]

Harsk's work now was stranger than guarding freight. [226] He was a keeper of the divergent archive -- a collection not of what had happened, but of what had almost happened, might yet happen, could never happen again. [252] The archive existed in no single place. [258] It was occasionally everywhere: a resonance that surfaced in the hum of certain rocks, in the spiral patterns of dune flowers, in the way light bent at the edges of old glass. [286] To access it, Harsk worked through wave functions, collapsing possibility into record by observing the interference patterns that memories left on matter. [306] He had learned this from a woman whose name he could not pronounce, in a settlement built inside the ribcage of a beached cargo ship. [329] She told him the universe remembers everything it almost became. [339]

Tonight, the glowing dune in bloom was singing. [347] The flowers -- engineered to survive the post-forest heat, their petals threaded with phosphorescent genes borrowed from deep-sea creatures -- emitted a faint harmonic when the temperature dropped. [373] It sounded like a fractured lullaby, the melody breaking apart and reassembling in keys that shouldn't coexist. [389] Harsk sat among them and placed the frozen chess clock on the sand before him. [403]

His motivation was simple, though the execution was not: to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners. [418] Every divergent timeline contained moments of light that this timeline had lost -- his daughter's laughter at fourteen, forests that survived, rain that still fell on green earth. [443] He could not bring those timelines here, but he could charm their echoes into the archive, coaxing them from the margins of probability the way one might coax a frightened animal from beneath a porch. [474] To charm was not to deceive. [480] It was to sing back to the universe in its own broken language and ask it, gently, to show what it had hidden. [501]

He closed his eyes and listened through the wave functions, letting the dune's song carry him into the interference pattern. [520] There -- a flicker. [523] A version of this dune where his daughter knelt among the flowers, pressing her palm to the sand, saying, "They're warm, Dad, feel them." [545] He did not reach for it. [550] Reaching collapsed the wrong things. [555] Instead he held still, the way the chess clock held still, frozen at the exact moment between one day and the next, between presence and absence, between the last move and the one that never came. [588]

The echo settled into the sand like rain into dry earth. [599] Another spark, cultivated. [602] Another unlit corner given a small, persistent glow. [610]

Harsk opened his eyes. [614] The flowers pulsed around him, their fractured lullaby continuing its impossible harmony. [624] He picked up the chess clock, brushed sand from its face, and held it to his ear. [639] Silent, as always. [642] But the archive was richer now by one almost-moment, one divergent tenderness preserved against the barren real. [658]

He stood and walked on, dreamless and awake, across dunes that bloomed in colors the dead forests never knew. [676] Somewhere ahead, another unlit corner waited. [683] Somewhere behind, the flowers kept singing their broken song to no one, to everyone, to the vast and patient dark. [701]
