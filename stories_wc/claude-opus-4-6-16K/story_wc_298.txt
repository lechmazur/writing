The catacomb orchard had no sun, yet the trees grew anyway, feeding on what the dead no longer needed. [20]

Maren descended the stone steps with a lantern in one hand and a charred tarot card in the other — the Ten of Cups, its painted family half-consumed by flame, their joy reduced to a blackened crescent. [52] She had burned it herself three years ago, believing she could destroy what it promised. [66] Now she returned to the place where destinies could be bartered, because the hole it left inside her had only widened. [83]

The half-lit corridors opened into a vaulted chamber where apple trees twisted upward through layered ossuary walls. [98] Roots snaked between femurs and ribs, cracking skulls to drink from the marrow-dark soil beneath. [112] Pale fruit hung from branches that had never seen daylight, and every apple carried a faint phosphorescence, as though each one had swallowed a candle. [135] Maren moved through them carefully, her lantern adding its glow to theirs, the combined light casting everything in shades of amber and ash. [156]

She was a reckless idealist — everyone had told her so. [167] Her mother, her partners, the hedge-witch who had first read her cards. [179] Maren believed that every wound could be mended if you were brave enough to reopen it, that every broken thing deserved the effort of repair. [202] This conviction had cost her a marriage, a home, a name she once answered to. [216] She had spent years inlaying meaning everywhere — into chance encounters, into recurring dreams, into the pattern of cracks on her ceiling — searching for proof that the universe wanted her whole. [244] But meaning, she had learned, was not the same as healing. [255]

At the heart of the orchard stood the Barter Stone, a slab of granite worn smooth by centuries of hands pressing desperate bargains into its surface. [278] Bones framed it like a reliquary. [284] Behind it sat the Keeper, an ageless figure whose gender shifted like smoke, whose voice carried the particular tenderness of someone who had witnessed every form of grief. [309] They were fiercely gentle — capable of refusing you with such compassion that you wept not from anger but from feeling, at last, truly seen. [334]

"You burned your card," the Keeper said, not asking. [343]

Maren set the charred remnant on the stone. [351] "I thought I didn't want what it offered. [359] A family. [361] Belonging. [362] I thought wanting those things would trammel me, bind me to a life too small for what I imagined I could be." [381]

"And now?" [383]

"Now there's a hole where the wanting used to live. [393] I didn't destroy the desire. [398] I just destroyed my permission to feel it." [406]

The Keeper lifted the burned card, turning it so the remaining pigment caught the light. [420] "A bartered destiny requires exchange. [425] You cannot simply reclaim what you gave up. [433] Something else must take its place on the pyre." [442]

Maren had prepared for this. [447] From her coat she drew a notebook filled with years of frantic annotation — every sign she had cataloged, every coincidence she had elevated to prophecy. [470] Her entire architecture of meaning, painstakingly constructed to convince herself that the universe was guiding her toward something grand enough to justify what she had sacrificed. [494]

"This," she said. [497] "I'll trade the story I told myself about why I had to be alone." [511]

The Keeper studied her for a long moment, then placed the notebook beside the burned card on the stone. [529] The roots beneath them shifted, and Maren felt something loosen in her chest — not dramatic, not cinematic, but like a knot she had carried so long she had forgotten it was not part of her anatomy. [564]

"The hole won't close tonight," the Keeper warned, their voice dusky with resolve and care in equal measure. [580] "But it will stop growing." [584]

Maren nodded. [586] She understood. [588] Patching holes in the soul was not a single act of bravery but a slow, recurring tenderness directed inward, the kind she had always been too reckless to attempt. [614]

She left the notebook on the stone. [621] She took the burned card back — not because the bargain required it, but because she wanted to remember what it felt like to deny herself the thing she needed most. [651] The half-lit corridors led her upward, past roots and bones and pale glowing fruit, toward a surface she could not yet see but chose, finally, to believe existed. [681]

Above the catacomb orchard, somewhere, it was morning. [689] Maren climbed toward it with empty hands and a heart that, for the first time in years, had room enough to ache. [711]
