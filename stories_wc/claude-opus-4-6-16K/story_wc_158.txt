The shell had been growing since before anyone could remember, spiraling upward from the ocean floor like a cathedral abandoned by its god and claimed by the sea. [30] Centuries of coral had fused to its inner walls, and bioluminescent creatures traced constellations across its vaulted ceiling, so that standing inside felt like standing inside a throat that had swallowed the night sky. [61] This was where Maren lived, the insomniac poet, sleepless not from anxiety but from a refusal to let any hour pass unwitnessed. [80]

She had arrived so long ago that the memory of arrival had calcified into myth. [94] Some said she had walked into the gargantuan shell as a young woman fleeing a war between two coastal nations, a war fought over blooming orchards that each side claimed as sovereign ground. [123] Others said she had always been there, that the shell had grown around her the way a pearl grows around an irritant. [143] What was certain: she had not slept in centuries, and she had filled every waking hour with verse. [161]

Her poems lined the walls in ink made from squid and rust, thousands of stanzas spiraling inward along the shell's logarithmic curve, each one an attempt to photosynthesize pain into beauty. [192] She took the wars she had witnessed, the drownings, the lovers separated by tides and time, and she pressed them into language until they bloomed. [215] This was her method and her compulsion. [222] She was shyly unstoppable — never loud, never declarative, but impossible to silence, the way roots are impossible to silence as they split stone. [244]

On the night the postcard arrived, Maren was ensconced in her deepest alcove, the one where the shell curved so tightly that she could press her back against one wall and her knees against the other and feel held. [281] She liked to ensconce herself there when the longing grew too large, when the centuries of it threatened to unspool her. [302] The postcard drifted down through a crack in the shell's apex, spinning like a leaf. [317] She caught it. [320]

On one side: a photograph of a galaxy, purple and gold, its spiral arms echoing the architecture of her home. [339] On the other side, in handwriting she did not recognize: "The orchards on both sides of the border are blooming at the same time. [361] No one is fighting. [365] They are calling it the blossom armistice." [372]

Maren read it again. [376] And again. [378] The blossom armistice. [381] The war that had driven her into the shell — or that she had carried into the shell, nursing it like a flame she was afraid to extinguish because it was the only light she knew — that war had ended. [414] Not with a treaty signed in a marble hall, but with trees on both sides of a border deciding, in the same season, to flower. [438]

She pressed the galaxy postcard to her chest and felt something she had not felt in centuries: the possibility of sleep. [458] Not yet. [460] But the possibility. [463]

She began to hum. [467] The sound traveled up through the shell's chambers, distorted by the curved walls, carried on drafts that entered through fissures where the coral had cracked. [491] Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind, her voice reached the open ocean, and the fish paused, and the jellyfish dimmed their lanterns as if listening. [520] The melody was imperfect, wavering, the way all honest things waver. [531] It was not a song of triumph. [538] It was a song of someone learning, after centuries of longing, that the thing she had been longing for had quietly arrived while she wasn't looking. [562]

She thought of the orchards. [567] She thought of blossoms falling on soldiers who had lowered their weapons not out of exhaustion but out of bewilderment at beauty. [586] She thought of how pain, pressed long enough, becomes not less painful but more luminous, the way deep water is not less dark but more full of strange light. [614] Reef-shadow joy — that was what she felt. [622] Joy that existed not despite the darkness but because of it, the way color exists more vividly at the edge of a shadow cast by living coral. [649]

She wrote one final poem on the innermost wall of the shell, where the spiral ended, where there was barely room for a single word. [675] She wrote: bloom. [678]

Then Maren tucked the galaxy postcard into the wall beside it, a stamp from a universe that had learned, across unimaginable distance, the same lesson her orchards had learned across centuries: that growing toward light is not a defeat of darkness but a conversation with it. [720]

She closed her eyes. [724] The shell hummed around her, resonant, alive. [731] For the first time in longer than memory, the insomniac poet slept, and the ocean outside was quiet, and the blossoms on the distant shore continued their gentle, unstoppable work. [762]
