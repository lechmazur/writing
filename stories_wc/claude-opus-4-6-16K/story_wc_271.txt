The arboretum had no official keeper, not since the lighthouse below it went dark. [16] After the last lighthouse keeper died, the county automated the beacon and forgot the gardens above, leaving the terraced cliff to its cypresses and salt wind. [40] Noor tended them anyway. [44]

She had come to the arboretum three years ago with a duffel bag, a set of grafting knives, and a crumpled photograph she kept in the chest pocket of every jacket she owned. [75] The photograph showed a courtyard in Sanaa strung with lights, her cousin Rasha mid-laugh, the hem of a white dress blurred by dancing. [97] Forty minutes after that frame was captured, a Hellfire missile turned the courtyard into a crater. [113] Noor survived because she had stepped outside to cool her face. [124] She survived because of a door, three walls, and dumb, unearnable luck. [136]

Now she grew trees. [140]

She was quietly talented with living things, a gift people noticed only in its results: the roses along the cliff walk that should have died in the salt air, the Aleppo pines she coaxed from seed in a greenhouse she built from salvaged lighthouse glass. [180] Visitors to the arboretum sometimes found her on her knees in the soil, earbuds in, listening to nothing, her hands moving with a sureness that looked like meditation. [210] They rarely spoke to her. [215] She preferred it that way. [220]

The problem was the freezing. [225]

It could come from anything: the whistle of a kettle, a gull's shriek pitched at the wrong frequency, the concussive slam of a car door in the parking lot below. [255] When it hit, her body locked, muscles rigid, breath stopped at the top of her lungs, the world flattening into a single bright pane of terror. [281] She would freeze mid-step, mid-sentence, mid-breath, and the courtyard would return in full sensory detail — smoke, screaming, the chemical smell of burning hair. [307]

Her therapist, Dr. Liang, called them somatic markers. [316] The body keeps its own ledger, she explained during their video sessions, Noor sitting cross-legged on the greenhouse floor. [333] Through somatic markers, the nervous system encodes threat into muscle and nerve long before the conscious mind can intervene. [351] The work was not to erase those markers but to meet them, to breathe alongside the alarm until the body learned it could survive the memory as it had survived the event. [384]

Noor practiced every morning at the cliff's edge, just above where the lighthouse lantern room rusted in the marine air. [403] She would stand with her boots in the thyme that grew wild between the flagstones and place one hand on her sternum, feeling her heartbeat, feeling the wind, feeling the difference between then and now. [438] She was searching for what Dr. Liang once called a pearl of stillness — a single moment of calm she could hold inside the panic, a bead of proof that the body could be both frightened and safe. [474]

It came to her one Tuesday in October. [482] A maintenance crew was repairing the cliff-side railing, and a pneumatic drill fired without warning. [496] Noor's legs locked, her vision tunneled, and the crumpled photograph in her pocket pressed against her heart like a brand. [516] But this time, somewhere beneath the roar, she found it: a breath that completed itself, a single exhale that traveled all the way down to her diaphragm and returned. [546] The pearl. [548] Small, imperfect, luminous. [551]

She did not pretend the panic vanished. [558] It didn't. [560] Her hands shook for an hour afterward, and she replanted a row of lavender crooked. [575] But the pearl was real, and she could return to it, and that was enough to anchor optimism in realism — not a fantasy of healing but evidence, bodily and inarguable, that she could hold both the wound and the world. [614]

That evening she unfolded the crumpled photograph and pinned it to the greenhouse wall beside a cutting calendar and a tide chart. [637] Rasha mid-laugh, the white dress blurred. [643] Noor touched the image once, then turned to water the Aleppo pines, their needles catching the last copper light that swept across the cliff where no keeper watched anymore but where things, despite everything, still grew. [680]
