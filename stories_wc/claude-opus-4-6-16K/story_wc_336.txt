Maren had pruned orchards for forty-seven years, and in that time she had learned that every cut was a conversation between what a tree remembered and what it dared to become. [31]

She stood now on the verdant parapet beside the waterfall, where moss claimed the ancient stone in slow emerald conquest and the mist softened every hard edge of the world. [62] Below, the water fell three hundred feet into a basin so deep its color shifted between jade and midnight, depending on the angle of the light. [88] Above, the last orchard of Thessaly clung to the clifftop in stubborn rows, its branches heavy with a silence that felt like held breath. [112]

It was the season upon the hush of budding hope, when the frost had finally released the soil but the blossoms had not yet committed themselves to opening. [141] The trees waited. [144] Maren waited with them, her pruning shears resting against her hip, her gaze fixed on the thin place between the mist and the morning. [169]

She had always seen it, that seam. [176] As a child she thought everyone could, that shimmering threshold where the air pleated and another world breathed just behind this one. [197] By the time she understood she was alone in this seeing, she had already begun weaving between worlds, stepping through the fold the way one steps through a doorway left ajar. [230]

The world on the other side was not so different. [240] The same mountains, the same river, but the colors there were richer, deeper, as if someone had soaked the landscape in meaning overnight. [261] Maren went there to remember what wonder looked like, and she returned to this side carrying that memory in her hands. [282]

Her method was simple and impossible: she worked by capturing essence. [292] She would cup a blossom from the other world, breathe across its petals until the color lifted like pigment from wet paper, and press that distilled hue into the bark of trees on this side. [326] It was not magic in the way stories told it. [336] It was patience, and listening, and an insatiably creative mind that refused to accept the slow graying of the earth. [355]

Because the earth was graying. [360] Year by year the orchards lost their luminance, the reds thinning to rust, the greens dimming to ash. [378] No one spoke of it directly, the way no one speaks directly of grief while it is still arriving. [396] But Maren saw. [399] She had made it her life's purpose to preserve the color of wonder, to keep the world from forgetting that it had once been radiant. [423]

From the inner pocket of her canvas coat she drew the heirloom seed, the last of its lineage. [440] It had belonged to her grandmother, who had received it from hers, passed down through hands that understood what the seed truly was: a anchor point, a bridge. [468] Planted at the seam between worlds, it would grow roots in both soils simultaneously, binding the fold open so that color could bleed freely back into the fading side. [497]

But a bridge open in both directions meant vulnerability. [506] The other world would feel the pull of this one's hunger and might dim in turn. [521] Maren knelt on the wet stone, the mist from the waterfall settling on her neck like a blessing. [539] She pressed the seed into a crack in the parapet where centuries of water had softened the rock into something almost like earth. [561]

She chose this place because the waterfall offered succor to everything that grew beside it, endless moisture, endless song. [579] The seed would not lack for nourishment. [586] And the parapet, perched between the cliff and the open sky, was the thinnest place she had ever found, the seam so delicate here that sometimes she could see both worlds at once without even trying. [621]

She covered the seed with moss and dark soil, then sat back on her heels. [636] The mist caught the first light and scattered it into a hush of gold. [650] Somewhere below, the river received the waterfall without complaint. [659] Somewhere above, the orchard's buds trembled at their tips, almost ready. [670]

Maren closed her eyes and listened to the fold breathe. [680] She could feel the seed already reaching, one pale root threading downward through stone, through the boundary, into the richer dark of the other world. [704] Color would come. [707] Slowly, the way all true things came, but it would come. [718]

She picked up her shears and rose. [725] The trees still needed pruning, the patient art of deciding what to keep and what to release so that what remained could flourish. [748] She climbed the mossy steps from the parapet back to the orchard, her hands steady, her mind already weaving. [768]

The mist held its radiant hush. [774] The buds held their breath. [780] And between the worlds, something green and ancient began to grow. [790]
