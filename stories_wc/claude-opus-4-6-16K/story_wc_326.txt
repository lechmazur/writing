<story>The opal observatory sat under snow like a buried eye, its dome catching what little starlight filtered through the storm's aftermath. [22] Maren climbed the last ridge and pressed her palm against the frost-glazed door. [35] Inside, the old instruments waited—telescopes aimed at nothing, radio equipment humming with residual static. [48]

She counted her heartbeats as she entered. [55] Sixty-seven since the ridge. [59] She always counted. [62] It had become compulsion after the hospital, after the clerk's error on the death certificate had cascaded through every system she depended on. [82] For eleven months, Maren had been legally dead—a digital ghost haunting her own life, locked out of bank accounts, insurance, employment records, her own apartment lease. [105] The algorithms believed the certificate. [110] The algorithms did not check for pulses. [117]

So she counted. [120] Each beat was evidence. [124] Each beat was rebellion against a database entry that said she had stopped. [137]

She set her bag on the observatory's central table and pulled out the notebook, the ink bottle, and the porcelain shard she'd carried since the day she'd smashed her mother's teacup in frustration—the day she'd learned no appeals board would expedite her case. [176] She'd kept one curved piece, sharp-edged and delicate, a reminder that breaking things was easy and that the jagged aftermath required patience. [198]

The radio equipment crackled. [202] She adjusted the dial, waiting. [207] The static rose, peaked, and then—silence. [214] Clean silence, the kind that meant the ionosphere had settled and the frequencies were open. [228] After the radio static cleared, the observatory's old computers could sync with the satellite relay without interference. [243] She had a narrow window. [248]

Maren opened the ink bottle and began. [255]

She'd discovered the method by accident during her months of digital purgatory. [267] Standard channels had failed—every form she submitted was rejected because the system couldn't reconcile a dead woman filing paperwork. [285] But the observatory's legacy system, built decades ago and never fully updated, could accept analog input through optical pattern recognition. [303] She would spill ink deliberately onto gridded paper, letting it bleed into ephemeral patterns that the scanner interpreted as data fragments. [323] Each pattern corresponded to a hexadecimal sequence. [330] Each sequence was a piece of her identity she could feed back into the network. [344]

She was learning to defragment herself—to gather the scattered shards of her digital existence and reassemble them into something coherent. [363] A living record. [366] Proof. [367]

The porcelain shard served as her tool, its curved edge perfect for guiding ink across the grid in controlled rivulets. [386] She tilted it, and dark lines branched like winter trees across the page. [399] The scanner hummed, reading. [403] Accepting. [404]

One hundred twelve heartbeats since she'd started. [411] She counted them like prayer beads. [417]

She was not here for vindication. [423] She'd tried that already—the angry letters, the legal threats, the desperate calls. [434] All failures. [436] But each failure had taught her something about the architecture of the systems that had erased her. [452] She had come to fetch wisdom from failure, to mine every rejection letter for clues about which databases talked to which, which nodes were vulnerable to correction. [478]

The snow pressed against the dome above her. [486] The opal panels, translucent and iridescent, turned the observatory into something cathedral-like—a sanctuary of refracted light even at midnight. [504] She felt the solace of it, the strange peace of working alone in a place built for watching distant, indifferent stars. [523]

Another page. [525] Another ink pattern. [528] Another fragment recovered. [531]

She was not rebuilding who she had been. [539] That woman—the one who trusted systems, who assumed her name in a database meant something solid—was genuinely gone. [557] What Maren was constructing now was something more deliberate, assembled with full knowledge of how easily it could shatter again. [575]

Three hundred and eight heartbeats. [581] The satellite window held. [585]

She pressed the porcelain shard into the ink one more time and drew the final pattern. [600] The computer processed it. [604] Somewhere, in a server she would never see, a record updated. [615] Status: living. [617]

Maren set down the shard, closed her eyes, and for the first time in eleven months, stopped counting. [634]
