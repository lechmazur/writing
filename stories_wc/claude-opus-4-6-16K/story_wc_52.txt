The kettle began its low hum on the iron stove, and Marguerite knew she had only these few minutes — the span of water heating from stillness to scream — to do what she had been putting off for eleven months. [42]

She sat beneath the rain-beaded skylight of the loft, droplets freckling the glass above her like a constellation mapped in water. [62] The light that filtered through was amber and rust, stained by the October afternoon and the patina of age on the panes, casting everything in a warmth that belonged to neither joy nor sorrow but to something quieter, something settled. [100] This was the loft above the old circus quarters in Arles, where she and Theodor had lived during the touring seasons, where his leather whip still hung on its hook and his boots still held the shape of his feet. [137]

On the table before her lay an ash wood carving blank, pale and smooth as a bar of soap. [155] She had purchased it from the woodworker on Rue Mireille three days after the funeral, knowing that Theodor had always meant to take up carving in retirement. [182] He had never retired. [186] The lion had seen to that. [192]

Marguerite turned the blank in her hands. [199] She was not a carver, had never held a gouge in her life, but that was not the point. [219] The point was to contain something — to press the uncontainable fact of a man's absence into an object small enough to hold. [242] She had learned this from Theodor himself, who had always said that the secret to working with lions was not courage but containment: you made yourself a vessel steady enough that the animal's fear could pour into you and find stillness there. [282]

She picked up the small knife she had sharpened that morning and set its edge against the wood. [300] She did not know what shape would emerge. [309] She only knew she had to begin while the kettle boiled, in this precise and bounded window, because grief without borders was just drowning. [333] Marguerite had drowned enough. [337]

The first curl of ash fell to the table. [346] She thought of his hands, how they smelled of lanolin and sawdust and the musk of the big cats. [365] Here and gone — that was the essential rhythm of her life now, the way memory arrived with the sharpness of a living thing and then retreated before she could hold it. [397] His laugh at breakfast, here. [402] The creak of his step on the loft ladder, gone. [412] The particular silence after he spoke to the lions, a silence that meant trust had been established — here, flickering, gone. [430]

She carved with hauntingly practical strokes, not artistic but deliberate, the way she had learned to mend costumes and balance accounts and file insurance claims after a death that made national news. [462] Practicality had become her art form, the only language grief had left her fluent in. [477] Each cut removed what was unnecessary and left behind something closer to truth. [490]

Through crystallized time — through this kettle-measured ceremony she had invented for herself — the minutes thickened like resin. [507] Each second held its own amber weight. [514] She could feel the wood yielding beneath the blade, could hear the rain intensify against the skylight, could smell the ghost of Theodor's tobacco in the wool of the chair beneath her. [546] The loft held these sensory fragments the way a reliquary holds bones: not to worship, but to harvest lessons from loss, to extract from the wreckage some instruction on how to continue. [577]

The shape emerging under her knife was simple. [585] A seated lion, rough and small, its mane only suggested by shallow grooves. [597] It was not beautiful. [601] It was honest. [604] It contained what she needed it to contain — not Theodor himself, but the space he had occupied, rendered in ash wood so she could set it on the shelf and know that the emptiness had a form and the form had edges and the edges meant she could survive it. [651]

The kettle screamed. [654]

Marguerite set down the knife, brushed the curls of wood from her lap, and rose. [669] She placed the rough lion on the windowsill where rain-light caught its grain and turned it the color of rust, of dried blood, of autumn, of peace. [697]

She poured the water over her tea leaves and watched the steam rise and vanish — here and gone, here and gone — and understood, finally, that this was not a tragedy but a rhythm, the same rhythm that ran through everything alive. [740]

The tea was strong and bitter and exactly right. [749] She drank it standing beneath the rain-beaded skylight, her hands still dusted with ash wood, her heart a steady vessel, and the small lion watching from its sill with patience carved into every unfinished line. [786]
