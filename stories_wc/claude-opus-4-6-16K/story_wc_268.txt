The temple library existed between moments, suspended across the pause of shifting constellations, when one age had exhaled and the next had not yet drawn breath. [28] Its shelves rose like canyon walls, carved from stone that remembered languages no living tongue could shape. [43] Scrolls and codices filled every alcove, their spines cracked with the weight of millennia, their pages holding dust that had once been certainty. [63]

Among these shelves moved Cael, the diminutive titan. [71] She stood no taller than a child, yet her shadow fell with the gravity of something colossal, bending the candlelight around her as though even flame recognized what she carried inside. [99] Regally unpretentious, she wore no crown, no sigils of office, only a threadbare robe and a belt from which hung a single pouch. [120] Inside that pouch rested an iron gall ink pellet, dark as a blood clot, dense as a collapsed star. [137] She rolled it between her fingers now, feeling its familiar weight, and considered the work that remained. [152]

The pretender had been careful. [157] For centuries, someone had been rewriting the genealogies, altering the temple records, inserting a false lineage into the histories that would legitimize a claim to the throne of the celestial order. [182] Cael had discovered the first alteration by accident, a single word changed in a coronation rite, shifting inheritance from the elder bloodline to one that had never existed. [207] Then she found another. [211] And another. [213] The forgeries were masterful, woven so deeply into the library's fabric that most readers would never notice the seams. [230]

But Cael noticed seams the way rivers noticed stone. [239]

She could not confront the pretender directly, not yet, not without proof that would survive scrutiny before the tribunal of ages. [258] So she chose a subtler path. [264] Through cryptic messages left in library books, she began to build her case, annotating the margins of corrupted texts with references that pointed careful readers toward the contradictions. [291] Each annotation was written with ink she made herself, dissolving fragments of the iron gall ink pellet into water she collected from the temple's weeping walls. [316] The ink bonded with the ancient pages as though it had always belonged there, invisible to careless eyes but unmistakable to anyone who knew how to look. [343]

Her messages formed a constellation of their own, a map of deception that would, when read together, unmask the pretender completely. [362]

At the center of her work was a rune of drift, an ancient symbol that meant unmooring, dissolution, the gentle coming-apart of things that had been falsely joined. [388] She inscribed it on the final page of every corrupted volume, a signature and a verdict. [403] The rune did not destroy. [408] It simply allowed what was untrue to lose its grip, to drift away from the page like smoke from a dead fire. [428] In time, the forgeries would sunder themselves, the false words separating from the parchment, leaving behind only what was original and honest. [449]

She worked for what felt like years, though time here obeyed no calendar. [462] Constellations shifted overhead through the temple's open oculus, freezing mid-rotation as though holding their breath, then lurching forward again. [479] Cael moved through the pause between their movements, placing her annotations with the patience of erosion. [494]

On the last night, if it could be called night, she found the volume she had been searching for longest: the Book of Ascensions, where every true sovereign's name was recorded in the hand of the temple's original scribes. [530] The pretender's name had been added in ink that almost matched, on parchment that almost aged correctly. [547] Almost. [548]

Cael opened her pouch and found the iron gall ink pellet reduced to a final grain. [564] She dissolved it on her tongue, tasting tannin and iron and centuries of patience, then breathed across the false entry. [583] The rune of drift materialized in the moisture of her breath, settling over the forged name like a veil. [600]

The letters trembled. [603] Then, with the grace of a cathedral finally yielding to gravity, they came apart, drifting upward through the oculus and into the frozen sky. [625] What remained on the page was an absence so clean it was its own testimony, a void where a lie had been, surrounded by truth on every side. [652]

Cael closed the book. [656] She returned it to its shelf. [662] The constellations overhead shuddered and resumed their ancient rotation, carrying the scattered letters into patterns no pretender could reassemble. [679]

She left the temple library the way she had entered it, small and unremarkable, a figure that history would record not by her stature but by the silence she restored to the spaces between honest words. [713]
