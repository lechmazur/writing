The Thunder-echo range had not spoken in fourteen days. [9] Maret counted the silence the way others counted storms — carefully, with reverence, knowing that stillness in these mountains carried its own weight. [28] The range was avalanchingly quiet, each absence of sound pressing down like packed snow before the break, a hush so total it seemed ready to collapse under itself. [52]

She climbed the scree slope toward the third cairn she'd built that morning, her satchel heavy with waterlogged wood. [68] Driftwood from the glacial lake below — pale, stripped, ancient. [77] She arranged each piece deliberately: one long branch pointing northwest toward the ridgeline, two shorter ones angled to mark the descent. [94] Directional markers. [96] Not for other travelers. [100] For herself, when she would need to find her way back from the other side. [114]

After the guardianship ended, Maret had walked away from the Alcove of Kept Things with nothing but the clothes on her back and the one relic she could not surrender. [143] The gilded reed flute rested in its leather case against her hip, warm even through the hide, as though it remembered the breath of every keeper who had played it before her. [171]

She had been the youngest relic keeper ever appointed, and the first to lose a charge. [186] The Alcove had housed forty-three relics when she assumed her post. [197] Forty-two remained when the elders stripped her title. [205] The missing piece — a seeing-stone called the Lament — had slipped between worlds during her watch. [219] She'd felt it go: a thinning in the air, a sound like fabric tearing underwater. [233] She had not been fast enough. [239]

The elders said failure was a closed door. [247] Maret believed it was an open one, if you were willing to walk through and study what lay on the other side. [269] She had come to the Thunder-echo range not to forget her failure but to harvest insights from it. [286] The Lament had crossed somewhere. [291] If she could learn the architecture of that crossing — the precise conditions under which the boundary between worlds grew thin — she could understand what she had missed. [316] She could weave between worlds herself. [322]

The driftwood markers were essential. [327] Each arrangement encoded the angle of her crossing, the time, the atmospheric pressure she estimated from cloud patterns and the ache in her knees. [348] When she played the flute and stepped through, the world on the other side was disorienting — a mirror of these mountains but lit from within, the stone itself faintly luminous, the air tasting of copper and rain. [382] She needed the markers on this side to pull her back, a constellation of pale wood against dark granite that she could feel even from beyond the veil. [408]

Now, at the ridgeline, she knelt and uncased the gilded reed flute. [419] Its surface caught no sunlight — the sky was a uniform grey — but it gleamed anyway, the gold leaf tracing patterns along the reed that resembled rivers seen from great height. [448] She held it the way one holds something both precious and dangerous: firmly, with the fingers slightly trembling. [464]

She had crossed eleven times now. [470] Each crossing taught her something. [475] The first taught her that fear was useless. [483] The fourth taught her that the other world responded to intent. [493] The seventh taught her that the Lament had not been lost — it had been called. [507] The ninth taught her by whom. [513]

Today she meant to answer that caller. [520]

Maret set her lips to the flute's mouthpiece. [528] The first note rose into the canyon hush and did not echo. [539] It simply hung, then folded inward, and the air before her opened like a page being turned. [555] Through the gap she saw the luminous stone, the copper-tasting dark, and far below in a valley that did not exist in her world, a faint pulse of light that she recognized. [584]

The Lament. [586] Still intact. [588] Still waiting. [590]

She placed the last driftwood marker — pointing home — and stepped through. [601]

The Thunder-echo range said nothing. [607] It held its silence like a breath, like a promise, like the space between one world and the next, and it waited for her return. [630]
