The morning the last fish was caught, Elody heard the ocean groan. [11]

Not everyone could hear it -- most people had stopped listening to water decades ago -- but Elody was a mage, if barely. [32] Lukewarm, her instructors had called her, and not unkindly. [42] Her fire spells produced a warmth suitable for tea. [51] Her frost incantations could chill a single glass of wine. [61] She had graduated from the Academy of Manifest Forces ranked two hundred and ninth out of two hundred and twelve students, and she had wept with gratitude at the ceremony because she believed, earnestly and without irony, that her modest gifts were still gifts. [101]

Now she stood on the sapphire viaduct at dawn, watching the sky bleed pink over the empty harbor below. [120] The viaduct was ancient, built from compressed mineral glass by engineers whose names no one remembered, and it carried water from the mountain reservoirs to the coastal city in a channel so blue it looked like a vein of sky laid across the earth. [159] Water still ran through it, though fewer people trusted it. [169] The sea had turned strange. [174] Fishermen hauled nets of nothing. [179] Yesterday the last living fish, a battered silver mackerel, had been pulled from the continental shelf by a trawler called the Eventide, and the captain had wept on the docks while reporters documented the carcass. [210]

Elody believed this was not merely ecological collapse but cosmic imbalance -- a fracture in the reciprocal circuit between land and sea that the old texts described as the Breathing Ledger. [237] Life flowed out, life flowed back. [243] Something had broken the return. [248]

She set the broken ship's bell on the viaduct's railing and studied it in the growing light. [264] She had found it in a junk shop three years ago, cracked down one side, its clapper missing, its bronze surface greened with salt and age. [290] It had belonged to a vessel called the Hymn of Kept Promises, and that name alone had been enough to make her buy it. [313] Brittle devotion -- that was what the shopkeeper had muttered, watching her count coins from a threadbare purse. [329] Elody had smiled, not understanding that the woman meant it as pity. [341]

But brittle devotion was precisely what the Breathing Ledger required: a commitment so fragile that maintaining it demanded constant, conscious renewal. [360] The old engineers had understood this. [366] The viaduct itself was proof. [371] Its sapphire channel had been calibrated not to volume or pressure but to dripping rates -- the precise rhythm at which water fell from the mountain source, drop by drop, into the channel's origin basin. [402] Each drop was a syllable in an ancient conversation between stone and sea. [414] The engineers had known that if you understood dripping rates, you understood tempo, and tempo governed every exchange the world made with itself. [436]

Elody intended to rebuild that conversation. [442]

She placed her palms against the bell's cracked bronze and pushed her lukewarm magic into it -- not enough to mend the fracture, never that, but enough to make the metal remember its resonance. [474] The bell hummed faintly, a half-tone, a broken chord. [484] She matched it with a whisper of fire, tea-temperature warmth pressed into the crack, and the hum steadied. [501]

Then she held the bell beneath the viaduct's nearest drip-point, where condensation gathered along the channel's lip and fell in slow, metronomic drops. [523] Each drop struck the bell's interior and rang -- not loudly, not beautifully, but truly. [537] One drop every four seconds. [542] She counted, adjusted the bell's angle by fractions of degrees, and listened as the tone shifted closer to what the old texts called the Return Frequency. [567]

It was absurd. [570] A lukewarm mage with a broken bell, trying to restart a cosmic engine with dripping water and earnest ignorance. [587] She knew how it looked. [591] She knew that plausibility bent around her like light around a dying star, that the impossible sat so close to the reasonable here that neither could be distinguished from the other. [621]

The two hundred and eleventh drop struck the bell and the crack sealed itself shut with a sound like a gasp. [642]

Below, in the empty harbor, something silver turned beneath the surface. [653]

Elody did not see it. [658] She was already recalibrating, already counting the next drop, her devotion brittle and unbroken, her naivete the only engine strong enough to haul the world back toward balance. [687] The viaduct gleamed sapphire in the new light. [695] The water kept its tempo. [700] And the ocean, for the first time in years, began to breathe. [712]
