The package arrived on a Thursday, wrapped in oilcloth and smelling of brine. [14] Maren had buried three people that week and wanted nothing more than silence, but the parcel sat on her counter like a fourth body demanding attention. [40] Inside: a broken lighthouse lens, fractured into seven pieces, each curved shard still holding light in a way that made her palms itch. [63] No return address. [66] No note. [68] Just the lens and, beneath it, a hand-drawn map showing coordinates that corresponded to nothing on land. [85]

She should have set it aside. [91] Maren was not an adventurer. [96] She was an undertaker in a coastal town where the dead outnumbered the living and the living barely noticed the difference. [116] But she was inadvertently stubborn — not in any dramatic way, just in the quiet manner of someone who could not leave a question unanswered once it planted itself behind her eyes. [147] She told herself she'd look into it tomorrow, and then it was tomorrow, and she was already on a boat. [166]

The coordinates led her to a stretch of gray ocean where the water turned impossibly clear. [182] Below the surface, visible through the crystalline depth, she saw rooftops. [193] Columns. [194] The arched windows of what could only be a library — vast, baroque, forgotten. [207] An entire city drowned in stillness. [213]

Maren descended in a rented diving suit that wheezed with every breath she took. [226] The underwater city library opened before her like a cathedral of silence. [237] Shelves still stood, though the books had long become something else — pulped into soft coral-like masses, their words dissolved into the water itself. [260] Schools of silver fish moved through the reading rooms like thoughts passing through a sleeping mind. [276]

She found the lighthouse at the library's center, a structure that had no business existing inside a building — occupying impossible space, a tower rising through what should have been floors and ceilings but instead opened into a hollow column of water and fading light. [320] The lens housing at the top sat empty, waiting. [329]

This was where the distress signals had originated. [337] Not radio waves, not flares — something older. [344] The lighthouse had been sending out pulses of need through the broken lens for decades, fragments of light scattered across the ocean floor, reaching anyone sensitive enough to feel them. [374] Maren had felt them in every grave she'd dug, in every coffin she'd closed, in the persistent ache that sleep never fully dissolved. [397] The dead she buried were not the source of her exhaustion. [408] This place was. [411] It had been calling her with the voice of something that could not rest. [425]

She understood now. [428] The city had drowned but never died. [435] Its library still held the memory of every soul that had lived here, encoded in the water, in the coral-books, in the restless pulse of the broken light. [463] They needed what she gave to others daily. [471] They needed burial. [474] They needed someone to say: you may stop now. [482]

Maren placed the seven shards of the lens back into their housing. [493] Her hands were steady despite the cold. [500] Each piece fit with a click she felt more than heard, and when the last shard found its place, the lens was whole again. [524] Light gathered from somewhere beneath the ocean floor and focused through the restored glass, and instead of scattering outward in desperate fragments, it turned inward. [549] It filled the library. [553] It touched every coral-book, every reading room, every impossible space the tower occupied. [566]

The distress signals ceased. [570]

Maren watched the silver fish scatter as the light passed through them. [582] The water grew warmer. [586] The coral-books softened, finally releasing their held shapes, drifting apart like ash. [598] The city exhaled. [601]

She had come to revitalize this place, and the paradox was not lost on her — she revitalized it by letting it die. [623] She gave rest a permanent address: here, in the deep, in the quiet that would no longer chase itself in circles. [644]

When she surfaced, the ocean above the city had turned opaque, ordinary. [656] The coordinates would lead nowhere now. [662] Maren motored home in the gray afternoon, the oilcloth folded neatly in her lap, and for the first time in years, the ache behind her eyes was gone. [690] The stillness had finally stopped running. [696]
