Maren had always been preemptively nostalgic, mourning the loss of moments while still living inside them. [16] It was what made her suited to the work, and what made the work slowly unbearable. [32]

She was one of the last summer-quill archivists stationed at the Orthain Observatory, perched on its granite spire above the permanent cloud deck. [55] The observatory had been built for astronomers centuries ago, but the astronomers had left when the fog began thickening, year after year, until it solidified into something between glass and stone, a translucent crust sealing the lowlands from the sky. [95] Now the observatory served a different purpose. [102] It housed the Archive of Collective Memory, and Maren was its keeper. [114]

The summer quills were rare instruments, hollow shafts cut from the pinions of solstice hawks, birds that flew only in the highest thermals of June. [139] When dipped in archive ink and pressed to vellum, they could transcribe not just words but the shared impressions of whole communities: the way a town remembered a flood, the way a generation carried the texture of a war none of them had personally fought. [184] Collective memory was imprecise, contradictory, alive. [190] Maren's role was to listen for it, record it, and try to make sense of the patterns. [207]

Her method was unusual. [211] Each morning, when stormlight broke across the observatory's platform, she would descend to the ring of monuments that encircled the spire, stone pillars erected for forgotten officials, their names eroded but their shadows still sharp. [246] She would examine the shadow lengths at each monument, measuring them against the previous day's readings. [262] The shadows told her things. [267] Not the future, exactly. [271] But through conjecture, careful, disciplined conjecture, she could infer how the collective memory below the solid fog was shifting, what emotional currents were rising through the crust like heat through stone. [302]

Today the shadows were shorter than they should have been. [312]

Maren recorded this in her ledger, her summer quill scratching softly. [323] The observatory was quiet. [327] It was always quiet up here, but lately the silence had acquired a different quality, a deepening hush, as though the world were holding its breath before a confession. [356]

She climbed back to the main platform and crossed to the crystal whispering forecourt, the small courtyard of faceted glass that adjoined the archive vault. [381] Rain had fallen an hour earlier, rare at this altitude, and the forecourt was doing what it always did after rain: whispering. [403] The crystal tiles picked up vibrations from the solidified fog below and translated them into faint, overlapping voices. [421] Not words, exactly, but the ghost-shapes of words. [429] The emotional residue of ten thousand people sealed beneath a sky they could no longer see. [445]

Maren knelt and pressed her ear to the wet crystal. [455] She heard grief. [458] She heard laughter tangled inside the grief. [465] She heard a hymn she almost recognized. [472]

She was preemptively nostalgic for this, too, for the act of listening, for the forecourt's rain-born murmuring, for the solitude of being the last person who cared about what the people below were collectively feeling. [507] She mourned the listening even as she listened. [515]

But mourning was not the same as surrender. [523]

She returned to her desk, selected a fresh summer quill, and began to write. [537] Not a transcription this time. [542] A conjecture. [544] She hypothesized that the shortening shadows and the hymn in the crystal were connected, that the people below were beginning to forget that the sky had ever existed, and that this forgetting was not decay but adaptation. [581] They were sculpting a new identity from experience, reshaping who they were to fit the world they had. [599] The fog had become solid, and so had they. [608]

Maren wrote until the stormlight dimmed and the observatory faded to amber. [620] She did not know if anyone would ever read her archive. [631] She did not know if the fog would thicken further, seal the spire itself, swallow the monuments and their shadows. [651] But the summer quill moved, and the collective memory breathed beneath her, and for now that was enough. [669]

She set the quill down in the deepening hush and listened to the crystal forecourt whisper the last of the rain away. [691]
