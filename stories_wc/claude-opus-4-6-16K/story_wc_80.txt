The drawbridge rose at seven each evening, sealing the island from the mainland with a groan of ancient chains, and only then did Maren begin her real work. [30]

She was the firm shore surveyor by title, employed by the coastal authority to measure erosion rates and document the shifting sediment along the estuary. [54] By day she walked the mudflats with her transit level and steel tape, recording numbers that mattered to engineers and to no one else. [76] But after the drawbridge rose, after the last car crossed and the iron teeth lifted against the violet sky, Maren descended to the submerged pavilion. [97]

It had been a dance hall once, built in 1923 on a sandbar that the river eventually swallowed. [114] At low tide the pavilion's roof broke the surface like the back of a sleeping animal, its copper shingles green and blistered. [135] At high tide only the cupola remained visible, a small lantern of cracked glass through which Maren lowered herself, her waterproof bag cinched tight against her chest. [162]

Inside, the ballroom existed in a permanent dusk of brackish water that reached her thighs. [177] Plaster cherubs stared from the cornices with faces half dissolved by salt. [189] The parquet floor, warped into soft ridges, still held the geometry of a world that had believed in permanence. [207] Maren waded through this hushed blaze of ruin, her headlamp catching the gilt ceiling in flashes that made the room seem to breathe with low fire. [232]

She carried with her an antique traveling inkwell, a brass cylinder no larger than her thumb, which had belonged to her grandmother. [253] The ink inside was iron gall, the same formula used in century-old letters, and it would outlast any modern pen. [272] From the inkwell she filled a nib and wrote on slips of archival linen paper, each note small enough to fold into the gaps of crumbling masonry. [297]

This was her method: placing notes in foundation repairs. [306] Wherever the pavilion's walls had been patched with newer mortar, Maren pressed her messages into the seams, letting the stone hold them the way a body holds breath. [333] Each note recorded something she had found in the building's remains, some artifact of the lives that had passed through before the water came. [357] A dance card with three names left blank. [364] A champagne cork wedged behind a baseboard. [371] A penciled phone number on a joist, digits that would ring nowhere now. [383]

She called herself the archeologist of abandoned dreams, though she said it only to the walls. [398] Stoically sensitive, Maren could catalog loss without weeping, yet she felt every absence as a kind of pressure against her sternum, an interlaced absence where one missing thing braided into another until the emptiness itself became a structure as complex as the pavilion. [437] The blank names on the dance card connected to the unanswered phone number connected to the cork from a celebration no one remembered. [457] Together they formed the architecture of what had not endured. [467]

Tonight she found something new. [472] Wedged beneath the bandstand, sealed in a rusted tin, was a leather journal filled with surveyor's notes from 1921, two years before the pavilion was built. [497] The surveyor had warned that the sandbar was migrating, that any structure placed here would be claimed by the river within decades. [519] The warning had been ignored. [524] Maren held the journal above the waterline and read by the thin fire of her headlamp, feeling the strange vertigo of meeting a predecessor who had measured the same shore and been overruled by desire. [556]

She had to wrest the final pages free from the tin's corroded lip, pulling carefully so the paper would not tear. [576] On the last page, the old surveyor had written not measurements but a single line: "They will build it anyway, and it will be beautiful, and it will go." [606]

Maren copied the sentence onto linen paper, folded it, and pressed it into a crack beside the bandstand. [624] Then she stood in the chest-deep water and let the pavilion hold her in its quiet conflagration of decay and memory. [644] Above her the cupola glass caught the last light of a sky she could not see, the drawbridge locked high, the island sealed, the world reduced to this one drowned room and its catalog of elegant, necessary losses. [680]

She capped the inkwell. [684] She would return tomorrow night, and the night after, reading the absences the way astronomers read dark matter, by the shape of what bends around the void. [710] The shore would keep shifting. [715] The notes would keep accumulating in the walls. [723] And somewhere in the braided silence of everything that was gone, the pavilion would go on almost remembering how to dance. [742]
