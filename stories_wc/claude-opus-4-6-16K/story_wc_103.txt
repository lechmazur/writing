The living bridge garden grew itself across the chasm over centuries, its ficus roots weaving into lattice and sinew, thick as a man's torso in places, thin as fingers where new growth still reached. Elara walked these bridges every morning, her bare feet reading the texture of bark and time. [50]

She had been a hedge maze designer once, celebrated for labyrinths that made visitors weep with disorientation and then, at the center, weep again with sudden clarity. [76] But that was before she found the halo fragment buried in the roots of the oldest bridge, and before the photographs began to fade. [97]

The fragment was no larger than a crescent of fingernail, translucent and thrumming with a light that seemed to come from an era rather than a source. [122] She had pried it from the root-wood thinking it was quartz. [133] The moment it touched her palm, time split open like a fig, and she saw everything that had ever happened on that bridge: a woman in mourning clothes dropping letters into the gorge below, two children daring each other across in monsoon rain, a monk sitting motionless for eleven days until the roots grew over his ankles. [180]

She could not stop seeing. [185]

That was three years ago, or what felt like three years. [196] Elara was retrocognitively trapped now, her consciousness snagged on the past the way fabric catches on thorns. [213] Every surface she touched unspooled its history into her mind, and the present grew thin around her like an overexposed photograph. [232] She kept a box of such photographs, images she had taken of the garden when she first arrived. [249] Month by month they were fading, the greens bleeding to white, the shadows dissolving, as though the past were consuming not only her perception but the evidence of her own timeline. [278]

She needed to understand. [282] Not to escape, not yet, but to discover the texture of time itself, to know whether it was woven like root-wood or layered like sediment or curved like the geometries she had once used to design her mazes. [315]

It was the mazes that gave her the answer. [324]

Elara had always worked with hyperbolic geometry, that strange mathematics where parallel lines diverge and a surface holds more space than Euclidean logic permits. [346] Her greatest hedgerows had been planted along hyperbolic curves, creating passages that felt impossibly longer inside than the garden that contained them. [367] She realized now that time behaved the same way around the halo fragment. [379] It was not linear. [383] It was hyperbolic, curving away from itself, holding more past than any present could contain. [397]

If she could map that curvature, she could navigate it. [407]

She began to redesign the living bridge garden. [415] Working with rope and grafting knife, she trained new root-growth along hyperbolic spirals, coaxing the ficus into shapes that mirrored the fragment's temporal geometry. [438] The bridges multiplied, branching and reconverging, forming a maze not of hedges but of living wood suspended over the abyss. [458] She walked the new paths with the fragment pressed between her palms, and the visions changed. [474] Instead of drowning in random pasts, she could choose her direction through them, stepping from century to century the way one steps from bridge to bridge. [498]

The photographs continued to fade. [503] She pinned the last visible one to a root-post at the maze's center and watched it disintegrate over the course of an afternoon, the paper softening, the image dissolving into white dust that the wind carried into the gorge. [540] She felt a quaking reverie as it went, a trembling awe that was equal parts grief and wonder. [558] The photograph's destruction was not loss. [564] It was time completing its own curve, the image returning to the light that had originally made it. [580]

Elara stood at the center of her living maze, barefoot on ancient roots, holding the halo fragment up to the sun. [600] Through it, the light broke into spectra she had no names for, colors that belonged to other moments. [617] She understood now that time had a texture after all. [627] It was not smooth. [631] It was fibrous and branching, like root-wood, like the bridges that grew themselves across impossible distances through patience and blind reaching. [650]

She closed her eyes and let the curvature carry her somewhere she had never been, which was also somewhere she had always been, which was also now. [677] The garden held its breath. [682] The roots kept growing. [686]
