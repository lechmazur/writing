The blackout had swallowed everything above, but down here, in the barnacled halls of the Merenthi Library, Sable Voss worked by the glow of bioluminescent kelp she'd cultivated along the reading rails. [33] She was a logical page indexer by trade, one of the last people alive who could reconstruct a catalog system from waterlogged fragments, and the sunken city of Merenthi had kept her employed for three years now. [65] The work suited her. [69] She was tranquilly perceptive in a way that unsettled colleagues who mistook silence for vacancy — she simply noticed more than she spoke. [88]

When the surface grid failed and the diving station lost power, most of the archaeological team ascended to the emergency platform. [107] Sable stayed. [109] The blackout stripped away the hum of generators, the chatter of radios, the mechanical pulse that had filled the submerged corridors since excavation began. [130] What replaced it was older: the faint percussion of deep currents against stone walls, the tick of settling sediment, the private breathing of a place that had been quiet for six hundred years. [160] She recognized this as reclaimed stillness — not absence, but restoration, the library remembering its original silence. [175]

She had come to Merenthi to trace honest origins. [184] The university consortium funding the dig wanted her to confirm their theory that Merenthi's texts were derivative, copied wholesale from the Alendic tradition to the north. [207] Prove dependency, they said, and the grant money flows. [216] Sable had agreed to index the surviving pages without bias, but the deeper she moved into the collection, the less the dependency theory held. [237]

Now, in the blackout's hush, she knelt before a cabinet she'd been slowly prying open for weeks. [253] The seal gave way. [257] Inside, wrapped in oilskin that had partially resisted the centuries of seawater, lay a registry ledger and, beside it, an antique ink stamp carved from bone. [282] The stamp's face bore the sigil of Merenthi's founding scribes — a closed eye above an open hand. [299] She turned it over carefully. [304] Along the handle, etched in the old syllabary, ran a date that predated the earliest known Alendic manuscript by at least eighty years. [325]

Sable set the stamp down on the reading rail and opened the ledger. [338] Many pages had fused together, but enough remained legible for her indexer's eye to parse the structure: acquisition records, organized not by title but by concept, a cataloging philosophy she had never encountered in Alendic systems. [371] She began cross-referencing against the fragments she'd already indexed. [381] Page by page, the pattern sharpened. [387] The Merenthi scribes hadn't borrowed from anyone. [394] They had built something original, and someone — likely during the political consolidation that preceded the city's flooding — had worked to obscure that fact. [415]

She paused and forced herself to readjust. [423] This was the moment where enthusiasm could corrupt methodology. [432] She applied the discipline she trusted most: the alternative hypothesis. [441] What if the stamp was a forgery, planted in a later era to manufacture prestige? [454] What if the ledger's dates used a different calendar? [463] She tested each possibility against the physical evidence — the mineral deposits on the oilskin, the wear pattern on the stamp's face, the ink composition visible under her magnifier. [489] Each alternative collapsed under scrutiny. [495] The bone was local. [499] The ink matched samples from the oldest verified Merenthi walls. [509] The stamp had been used thousands of times; no forger would commit to that labor. [523]

The stillness held her like water holds a stone: completely, without effort. [535] Above, the blackout continued, but she felt no urgency. [544] She felt dappled resolve — not the blazing certainty of someone who had won an argument, but the quieter, shadowed kind that comes from knowing the truth will cost something. [572] The consortium would not welcome her findings. [579] Her contract would likely end. [584] Other indexers, more agreeable ones, would be brought in to reinterpret what she'd cataloged. [596]

But the stamp sat on the rail, real and heavy, its closed eye patient. [609] The library had waited six centuries in salt and darkness for someone to read it honestly. [624] Sable picked up her pencil, opened her index notebook to a fresh page, and began writing the entry that would upend the accepted history: Item 1, Cabinet 9, East Wing. [654] Founding Registry of the Merenthi Scribal Order. [661] Origin: local. [663] Provenance: confirmed. [665]

She wrote slowly, letting each word settle into the silence the way the city had once settled into the sea — not with violence, but with the resigned grace of something returning to where it belonged. [698] The honest origin of Merenthi's knowledge was no longer lost. [709] It was indexed. [712]
