The university radio station smelled like burnt coffee and ionized dust, a combination Maren Solís had come to associate with the end of the world. [26]

She spread the astronomical charts across the broadcast desk, their hand-annotated margins trembling under the fluorescent lights. [42] Three weeks ago, she had been an unremarkable graduate student in astrophysics, cataloging background noise from a decommissioned satellite array. [59] Now she was the only celestial signal interpreter on campus who understood what was actually speaking through the static. [77]

The signals had started as anomalies — rhythmic pulses embedded in the cosmic microwave background, too precise for natural phenomena, too slow for human technology. [100] Maren had isolated them, mapped their patterns against her charts, and felt her blood go cold. [115] The frequencies weren't random. [119] They were conversational. [122]

Something out there was talking, and worse, it was lying. [132]

The first broadcast had promised clean energy. [139] A formula, elegant and simple, threaded through subsonic frequencies that most equipment couldn't detect. [152] Maren had caught it only because the university radio station's ancient analog board still processed signals below twenty hertz, vibrations felt in the chest rather than heard by the ear. [180] Professor Aldric Chen in the physics department had verified the formula. [191] It worked. [193] The campus had erupted in wonder. [199]

Then came the second transmission, offering medical breakthroughs. [207] Then the third, with coordinates to mineral deposits. [215] Each gift arrived through those subsonic frequencies, each one verified, each one real. [227] The world's attention turned toward the university like a searchlight finding a fugitive. [239]

And that was when the community began to divide. [248]

Half the faculty wanted full disclosure — every signal published, every formula shared. [260] The other half, led by Dean Vasquez, demanded institutional control. [270] Whoever owned the signals owned the future. [278] Power plays erupted in faculty meetings that felt like war councils. [289] Vasquez locked down the radio station, posted campus security at the doors, and appointed herself gatekeeper of extraterrestrial generosity. [306]

But Maren had kept working through the nights, cross-referencing her astronomical charts with the signal timestamps, and she had found the seam in the deception. [329] Each transmission's subsonic carrier wave contained a secondary pattern — a harmonic ghost that, when decoded, contradicted the primary message. [348] The clean energy formula would work for eleven months before cascading into catastrophic feedback. [361] The medical data would cure one disease while quietly engineering susceptibility to another. [373] The mineral coordinates led to deposits laced with compounds that would poison groundwater within a decade. [387]

Cosmic tricksters. [389] Maren whispered the phrase to herself like a diagnosis. [398] Whatever intelligence was broadcasting, it was playing a long game, seeding dependency before collapse. [412] Every gift was a trap with a delayed trigger. [421]

She was cautiously hopeful — not that the signals were wrong, but that she had found them out in time. [440] The question was what to do next. [448]

Dean Vasquez wouldn't listen. [452] The signals had made her powerful, and powerful people don't welcome complications. [463] The disclosure faction wouldn't listen either; they wanted the formulas released immediately, consequences unconsidered. [476] Both sides were being played, and neither could see the strings. [487]

So Maren decided to interfere. [492]

She waited until the next scheduled transmission, 2:47 AM on a Thursday, when the station was staffed by a single security guard she'd bribed with homemade empanadas. [519] She patched into the broadcast system and did something no one had considered: she transmitted back. [534]

Using the same subsonic frequencies, she sent a signal constructed from the tricksters' own secondary patterns — their hidden language, their real voice — reflected back like a mirror held up to a liar's face. [565] The astronomical charts had given her the precise coordinates for targeting the reply. [578] She wasn't trying to communicate. [583] She was trying to outwit them, to demonstrate that the deception had been detected, that this particular species wasn't as gullible as assumed. [604]

The response came in fourteen seconds. [610] Every monitor in the station flickered. [616] The subsonic hum deepened until Maren felt her teeth ache. [626] Then, silence. [628] Pure, absolute silence — not just in the station, but across every frequency her equipment could measure. [644]

The signals stopped. [647]

By morning, the formulas had begun degrading, their elegant structures unraveling like wet paper. [661] The coordinates led nowhere. [665] The gifts were being withdrawn. [670]

Dean Vasquez stormed into the station demanding explanations. [678] The disclosure faction accused sabotage. [683] Both sides turned their fury on Maren, who sat among her charts with coffee-stained fingers and an expression that held neither triumph nor regret. [704]

She had saved them from a slow poison, and they hated her for it. [718] But hatred, she thought, was a human problem. [727] Human problems she could live with. [733]

Outside, the sky was just the sky again — vast, silent, and cautiously hopeful in its emptiness. [749]
