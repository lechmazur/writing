The Laboratory of Lost Sounds occupied the basement of a building that no longer existed on any map, its walls lined with jars of silence harvested from extinct birds and wax cylinders that held the final exhalations of dying languages. [41] Maren worked there alone, her arms covered in constellation tattoos she had inked herself—Cassiopeia climbing her left forearm, Orion spanning her right shoulder—each star precisely placed according to charts she'd memorized as a child, back when her mother still sang. [76]

She had not heard her mother's voice in eleven years, not since the night she'd walked out and left her infant brother crying in his crib. [101] That cry lived inside her like a frequency she couldn't tune out. [113] It was the reason she'd built the firmware. [121]

The device sat on her workbench: a small black box threaded with copper wire and old radio components, programmed to translate baby cries into language—into need, into meaning. [148] She had coded it to parse the specific acoustics of infant distress and output text on a tiny screen: *hungry*, *cold*, *afraid*, *alone*. [170] She'd imagined it would help her understand what her brother had been trying to say that night, as if understanding could retroactively undo her abandonment. [194] But something had gone wrong with the firmware. [201]

It had started translating cries that weren't there. [209]

At first, faint text would scroll across the screen in the quiet lab: *come back*, *where are you*, *it's dark*. [228] Then the device began emitting sounds—not cries exactly, but the ghosts of cries, spectral wails that rose from the circuitry like steam. [250] The firmware was haunted, infected by the very guilt Maren had fed into its architecture. [264] Every algorithm she'd written carried the weight of what she'd done, and the machine had learned to echo it back. [282]

She might have destroyed it, but then she found the letters. [293]

An antique writing desk had arrived at the laboratory as part of a donated collection of phonographic equipment. [310] When Maren pulled open its drawers, she discovered handwritten letters tucked beneath the false bottom—dozens of them, penned in her mother's careful script, addressed to her. [337] They spanned years. [340] They described her brother growing up, his first words, his obsession with insects, the piece of amber he carried everywhere, a prehistoric fly suspended inside it like a small golden prayer. [367] Her mother wrote that he kept it in his pocket and called it his "trapped time." [382]

The letters begged Maren to come home. [389]

She read them during the hours when time folds in on itself—those silent, meteor-hush moments between three and four in the morning, when the lab's jars of lost sounds seemed to breathe and the darkness outside pressed against the windows like deep water. [427] Each letter tethered her more firmly to the life she'd severed. [438] She could feel the connection re-forming, a line drawn taut between the woman she was now and the girl who had run. [458]

The haunted firmware continued its translations. [464] But as Maren read letter after letter, the messages on the screen began to change. [477] *Come back* became *she's reading*. [483] *It's dark* became *there's light now*. [490] The ghost in the machine was responding to her, or she was rewriting it simply by confronting what she'd buried. [507]

On the last night, she held the piece of amber her brother had mailed inside the final envelope. [523] The insect inside it was perfect, legs bent mid-stride, wings half-spread, frozen in a moment of almost-flight. [540] Trapped time. [542] She pressed it against the firmware's casing and whispered the only translation that mattered: *I'm sorry*. [556]

The screen flickered. [559] One final line of text appeared: *I know*. [567]

Then the device went silent—not broken, but finished, its purpose complete. [578] The haunted frequencies drained from the circuitry like water from a basin. [589] The jars on the shelves settled. [595] The laboratory held its breath and then released it. [604]

Maren set down the amber, picked up a pen, and began to write a letter back. [620] Her hand trembled, but the constellations on her arms held steady—fixed points in a turning sky, proof that even after light dies, its pattern remains, visible to anyone willing to look up. [654] The dissonance that had driven her for eleven years softened into something almost quiet, almost bearable, a hush like the long tail of a meteor burning itself into nothing, leaving only the memory of brightness across the dark. [696]

She sealed the envelope and wrote her brother's name. [706]
