The tidal island emerged from the mud flats like a tooth from a rotting jaw, and Sable watched it materialize through the pre-dawn murk with the same haggard awe she brought to everything now — the awe of someone who hadn't slept in eleven days and had stopped believing exhaustion could kill her. [50]

After the water wars, the causeway to Maren's Rock surfaced only during the lowest tides, and only then for three hours before the sea reclaimed it. [75] Sable had learned to read the rain trails — those rivulets that carved temporary channels down the island's basalt slopes — to know exactly when the path would open. [100] Each trail told a story of drainage, of the land's slow exhalation, and by following rain trails scored into the mudstone she could time her crossing to the minute. [124]

She carried her paints in a waterproof case strapped across her chest and the amber brooch pinned inside her collar where the salt wind couldn't tarnish it. [148] The brooch had been her mother's, then briefly a currency during the rationing years when fresh water cost more than gold. [168] Her mother had refused to trade it even when their well ran dry, and Sable had inherited both the brooch and the stubbornness. [190]

She painted because she couldn't sleep, and she couldn't sleep because the world after the wars looked nothing like the world she remembered, and her mind refused to reconcile the two. [220] Every canvas was an attempt to thresh meaning from experience — to take the ruined harbors, the salt-poisoned fields, the communities rebuilt on stilts above disputed waterlines, and render them into something a human nervous system could metabolize. [253]

Maren's Rock had been a monastery once, then a military outpost, then abandoned. [266] Now someone had lit a fire in the old chapel. [276]

Sable found him sitting among the ruins, a gaunt man with steady hands and paint-stained fingers that mirrored her own. [296] He was working on a mural directly onto the chapel wall — cerulean waves devouring a city she recognized as Port Eleuth, which had been flooded in the second offensive. [322]

"You're painting the convergence," she said. [328]

He looked up, unsurprised, as though insomniacs washing ashore were a regular tide. [340] "The unearthed convergence," he corrected, wryly earnest in the way of someone who had thought too long about precise language. [358] "Where the aquifer collapse met the military advance met the storm surge. Three forces that had nothing to do with each other until suddenly they had everything to do with each other." [389]

"I was there," Sable said. [394]

"I know. I've seen your work. The exhibition in the Dryland Corridor." [406] He set down his brush. [410] "You painted it from inside. I'm trying to paint it from above. Neither perspective is complete." [426]

They regarded each other across the half-finished mural, two people hollowed by wakefulness and purpose. [440] The chapel smelled of mineral pigment and old stone and the particular brine that meant the tide was beginning to think about returning. [460]

"I have cadmium yellow," Sable said. [466] "Real cadmium, pre-war stock. You can't get the fire tones without it." [478]

His eyes widened — a reaction she understood. [485] Cadmium yellow was almost mythological now, hoarded or lost. [494]

"I have ultramarine," he said slowly. [500] "Lapis-derived. Enough for two paintings, maybe three." [508]

The exchange happened without ceremony — small tubes of irreplaceable color passed between paint-cracked hands over the chapel's broken altar. [525] Sable unpinned the amber brooch and held it up so the early light passed through it, casting a warm geological glow across his mural. [548]

"That color," he whispered. [552]

"My mother's." She pinned it back. [557] "Not for trade. But I can mix something close." [566]

They painted together through the remaining hours, merging their perspectives — her intimate ground-level anguish with his terrible aerial clarity — until the convergence on the wall became something neither could have achieved alone. [596] The mural breathed with haggard awe, the very quality that had driven Sable across the mud flats in darkness. [614]

When the rain trails reversed direction and began carrying seawater uphill, they knew the causeway was drowning again. [631] They packed quickly, carefully, the new pigments distributed between them like a covenant. [643]

"Same tide next month?" he asked. [649]

Sable looked at the mural, unfinished and already more true than anything she'd painted alone. [665] The amber brooch pulsed warm against her throat, holding its ancient light. [677]

"I'll follow the rain trails back," she said, and meant it as a promise. [691]

They crossed the causeway together in silence, two insomniacs carrying color through a world that had tried to wash itself clean of meaning, stubbornly bearing it forward anyway. [718]
