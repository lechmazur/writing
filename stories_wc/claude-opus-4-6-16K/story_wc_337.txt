The prism sanctuary had no walls, only columns of crystal that caught starlight and scattered it into pale, trembling geometries across the floor. [25] Maren knelt at the center of it, her hands shaking the way they always did now, ever since the last mask had broken beneath her fingers and she had heard the voice trapped inside it scream. [56]

She was a mask restorer, or she had been. [65] For eleven years she had repaired the ceremonial faces of the dead -- porcelain shells painted with the final expressions their families wished to remember. [86] Each mask held a spirit tethered to the living world, and each repair she performed kept that spirit calm, grounded, asleep. [104] But three months ago, the mask of Aldric Voss had crumbled despite her careful work, and his spirit had torn free in a wail that embedded itself in her bones. [131] She could still feel it vibrating there. [138] Since then, every mask she touched cracked further. [146] Her hands carried the resonance of his unrest. [154] She was broken in the way her craft understood best: a fracture that let something unwanted through. [168]

Tonight she had come to exhume what she had buried. [178] Not a body. [181] A net. [184]

The fisherman's net lay coiled in a stone basin at the sanctuary's heart, where it had rested for three centuries. [201] It had belonged to Tessaly Brune, the first mask restorer, who had been a mender of nets before she became a mender of faces. [225] The net was impossibly knotted, each knot tied by Tessaly herself as a way of binding silence into fiber. [243] Every knot held a pocket of hush -- not mere quiet, but the active, accumulating silence that could press against a scream until the scream forgot itself. [268] Tessaly had called this interlaced hush: silence woven so tightly into material that it became structural, weight-bearing, capable of holding grief in place. [289]

Maren lifted the net with reverent, unsteady hands. [297] Starlight passed through the crystals and painted her knuckles in violet and silver. [309] She could feel the silence immediately, dense and cool, like water pooling in her palms. [323] The net accumulated it -- had been accumulating it for three hundred years, drinking quiet from the sanctuary's still air, growing heavier with every undisturbed night. [347]

She reached into her coat and withdrew the tapestry needle, long and curved, its eye threaded with a filament of spider-steel. [368] This was the tool Tessaly had used to bind silence into the masks themselves, stitching hush into the porcelain's glaze. [386] Maren would use it now for the reverse: to unravel the knots and release what was stored inside. [403]

She told the darkness what she was doing, because the method required it. [415] The silence could only be freed across the sharing of a secret, spoken aloud to whatever listened. [432] "I broke Aldric Voss," she said. [438] "Not his mask. [441] Him. [442] I felt the fracture line weeks before it spread, and I chose to believe my hands were steady enough. [460] They weren't. [462] I let him shatter because I was too proud to ask for help." [473]

The first knot loosened beneath the needle's curve. [481] Silence poured from it like breath held for a century, and Maren gasped as it washed over her, pressing against the vibration in her bones. [505] The wail of Aldric Voss dimmed. [511] Not gone. [513] Dimmed. [514]

She worked the second knot, and the third, each one releasing its stored hush in a wave that layered over the last. [534] The interlaced silence built around her like armor, like a cocoon, like the careful pressure of hands cupping a flame to keep it from guttering out. [559] Her own restlessness -- the lucid, sleepless unrest that had driven her here -- began to quiet, not because it was solved but because it was held. [583]

By the ninth knot, the sanctuary hummed with released silence so thick that the starlight seemed to slow, each prismatic color lingering longer on the stone. [607] Maren felt the restless spirits she had failed -- not only Aldric but the others, the ones whose masks bore hairline cracks she had never reported -- settle into the hush like stones into still water. [641]

She would not be healed by morning. [648] The net had centuries of silence left to give, and she had years of fractures to mend. [665] But the needle moved surely now, her hands no longer shaking, guided by confession and the slow, deliberate unraveling of what someone wiser had tied shut against precisely this kind of night. [697]

She whispered another secret to the dark, and another knot came free. [710] The spirits grounded themselves in the hush, and Maren, for the first time in months, breathed without trembling. [728]

Above her the stars turned, indifferent and beautiful, and the prism sanctuary held its accumulated silence like a promise she was only beginning to understand. [752]
