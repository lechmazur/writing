Maren had not spoken her sister's name aloud in four years, though she whispered it constantly inside the architecture of her skull. [21]

She tended the orchard alone, as she always did after the canopy grew silent beneath the moon, when the last drip from the stalactites struck the limestone basin and the pale fruit trees stood like congregants frozen mid-prayer. [55] The cavern opened at its crown to a fracture in the mountain, just wide enough to let moonlight pour down in a single silver column. [76] By that light the cherry and apple trees drank, their roots curling around calcite deposits, their branches heavy with fruit no surface farmer would recognize -- translucent, faintly luminous, sweet with mineral aftertaste. [105] Maren moved among them with her lantern extinguished, reading the grove by feel alone, because she was a conjurer and secrecy was the marrow of her craft. [131]

She had come to this cavern seven years ago following Elda, who had been the gently inventive one, the sister who could look at a broken clock and reimagine it as a music box, who could skin a dead sparrow and pose it so convincingly on a wire branch that children swore they heard it sing. [177] Elda had been a taxidermist before the mountain called her underground, and she had brought her tools, her thread, her arsenic soap, and a single pair of glass eyes -- hazel, flecked with copper, sized for a fox but uncannily human in their warmth. [220] Those eyes sat now in Maren's coat pocket, wrapped in a square of oilcloth. [234] She touched them the way a mathematician touches a proof: reverently, seeking certainty. [245]

The trouble with Elda was that she had not died. [255] She had simply stopped being findable. [261] One morning four years ago she left to chart a deeper passage and did not return, and the cavern swallowed every trace of her footsteps, every echo of her voice. [290] Maren searched for eleven months. [295] She found no body, no blood, no letter. [303] The loss lived in a space between grief and hope, and Maren could not name it, could not quantify it, could not close the door on it. [328] It was ambiguous in the cruelest mathematical sense: a variable that refused resolution. [340]

That refusal was what drove her conjuring now. [349] Maren had always believed that emotion followed hidden formulae, that sorrow had a coefficient and longing a decay rate, and if she could map those numbers she could finally determine whether Elda was gone or merely elsewhere. [383] She knelt on the mosaic stepping stone Elda had laid at the orchard's entrance years ago -- tiles of blue and gold pressed into mortar, many now chipped from frost and foot traffic. [414] It was via the chipped patterns on that mosaic stepping stone that Maren performed her most delicate work. [431] Each missing fragment created a gap, and each gap described a shape, and each shape corresponded to a symbol in the notational language Elda had once invented for cataloging animal expressions. [459] Maren traced the absences with her fingertip, letting the broken code dovetail with the conjuring lattice she built in her mind, interlocking loss with logic until the two became structurally inseparable. [489]

She placed the glass eyes on the stone. [498] They caught the moonlight and held it, two small planets orbiting nothing. [510] In the old days Elda would set glass eyes into the skulls of preserved creatures and say she was returning what death had borrowed. [531] Maren wondered if conjuring was the same gesture made larger: the attempt to return what silence had borrowed, to fill a socket with seeing. [553]

The spell rose not as fire or wind but as sound -- a low hum that matched the frequency of dripping water, the resonance of the cavern itself. [579] The mosaic glowed faintly along its fracture lines. [588] Numbers surfaced in Maren's mind, not as answers but as better questions, and she understood for the first time that the mathematics of emotion did not resolve. [614] They iterated. [616] Each cycle brought the sum closer to something without ever arriving, an asymptote shaped like her sister's face. [632]

The glass eyes shimmered and went dark. [639] The orchard was silent. [643] The fruit glowed on its branches like small predictions. [652]

Maren wrapped the eyes again, stood, and brushed the grit from her knees. [664] She had not found Elda. [669] She had not proven Elda lost. [675] But the formula had shifted tonight, tightened, moved one decimal place closer to a truth she could almost hold. [694] Tomorrow she would return to the deeper passages with her lantern and her rope and the stubbornness that had always been her own quiet invention. [718]

Above the cavern the moon moved on, indifferent and reliable, and beneath it the pale trees went on growing toward a light that came and went but never fully disappeared. [748]
