The shrine breathed with her, its walls of ancient glacier ice catching the candle flames and scattering them into pale constellations. Maren knelt at the center of the hollowed chamber, her wet suit peeled to her waist, her skin prickling against the cold that seeped from every surface. The light here was not its own — it was borrowed starlight, reflected through fathoms of translucent ice from the polar sky above, mingled now with the trembling warmth of seventeen hand-dipped candles she had arranged in a crescent around her work. [82]

Before her sat the melted snow globe, its glass dome warped and half-collapsed like a jellyfish pulled from the sea. Inside, the tiny porcelain figure of a girl had fused to the base, her outstretched arms sealed in a permanent reach toward nothing. Maren had salvaged it from the wreck of the Karelian Star, a research vessel that sank three winters ago with eleven souls aboard. She dove wrecks not for treasure but for these remnants — objects still heavy with the unfinished lives of the dead. [163]

She was a ghost whisperer, though she hated the term. It suggested she listened passively. What Maren did was far more deliberate: she wove truth carefully, threading together fragments of evidence that the dead left scattered not in the physical world but in the dreams of the living. [205]

Her method was singular. The drowned did not haunt houses or howl through corridors. They appeared as cameo figures in the dreams of strangers — a face in a crowd scene, a hand passing a glass at a dreamed dinner party, a figure standing at the edge of a dreamed road. By analyzing these cameo appearances, Maren could triangulate a ghost's intention, could read the message encoded in where and how and to whom they chose to show themselves. She had spent two months collecting dream journals from people across four countries who had never heard of the Karelian Star yet reported the same woman's face surfacing unbidden in their sleep. [310]

The woman was Dr. Ailani Voss, the ship's glaciologist. The melted snow globe had been hers. [327]

Maren spread the transcribed dreams across the ice floor, weighting their corners with smooth stones. In a fisherman's dream in Reykjavik, Ailani stood behind a window, pressing both palms to the glass. In a child's dream in Marseille, she appeared at a classroom window, mouthing words. In an elderly poet's dream in Hokkaido, she knocked on a frosted pane from the outside. [389]

Windows. Always windows. Maren understood: these were windows of connection, the thin barriers between the living and the dead through which Ailani was trying to reach. She was not seeking comfort. She was trying to expose something. [424]

Maren lifted the melted snow globe and turned it slowly in the candlelight. The warped glass caught reflections of the transcribed pages, and for a moment she could almost see Ailani's face superimposed on the glass — pressing against it from the inside, just as she appeared in every stranger's dream. [472]

The ship's official report blamed engine failure. But Ailani's cameo appearances told a different story. In each dream, she held something — sometimes a folder, sometimes a vial, once a small black device that the dreamer described as a recorder. Maren had cross-referenced these objects with the ship's cargo manifest and found a discrepancy: undeclared samples, a secret drilling operation into the glacier shelf, a corporate sponsor whose name appeared nowhere in the public record. [545]

Ailani had discovered something in the ice that someone wanted buried. And so they buried her — along with ten others who simply had the misfortune of being aboard. [574]

Maren's hands trembled as she arranged the final pieces of evidence. She was not a journalist or a detective. She was a diver who talked to the dead. But Ailani had chosen her, had pressed against those dream-windows night after night until Maren found the pattern, followed the thread, pulled the truth from the wreckage. [621]

To salvage something pure from the wreckage — that was always the goal. Not justice exactly, though justice might follow. Something purer than that: the restoration of a voice silenced, a truth returned to the air. [657]

She sealed the evidence into a waterproof case alongside the melted snow globe. Tomorrow she would surface, would deliver everything to the families, to the press, to whoever would listen. Tonight she sat in the glacier shrine and let the borrowed starlight wash over her, let the candle flames dance their pale reflections across the ice, and spoke Ailani's name aloud so the walls could carry it upward through the frozen cathedral toward the stars. [726]

The candles flickered as if someone unseen had exhaled with relief. [737]

Maren smiled. The window between them, for one trembling moment, was open. [749]
