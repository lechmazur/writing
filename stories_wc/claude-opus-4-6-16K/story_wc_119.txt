The lighthouse keeper had not always been a lighthouse keeper. [10]

Before the island, before the rocks and the salt-eaten stairs, Mei Lin had written fortunes for the Golden Dragon Cookie Company in a basement office on Mott Street, turning out thousands of tiny prophecies each week on strips of paper no wider than a breath. [51] She had been, by all accounts, the best cryptic fortune cookie writer the company ever employed, her little messages landing somewhere between nonsense and revelation, the kind of phrases people laughed at over dim sum and then remembered, unsettled, months later when the words came true. [90]

Accidentally prophetic, her supervisor once called her, half joking, half afraid. [101]

The trouble started when one of her fortunes -- "The eye that reads the smallest print sees the largest betrayal" -- was found tucked inside a cookie served at a diplomatic luncheon in Washington. [133] Within a week, a junior attache was arrested carrying spycraft microdot film specs embedded in the dot of an exclamation point on a restaurant receipt. [157] The investigators traced the cookie to Golden Dragon, the fortune to Mei Lin. [170] She had no connection to the attache, no knowledge of the microdot, no explanation for how her words had anticipated the discovery. [192] But explanations, she had learned, mattered less than patterns, and the pattern said she was dangerous. [208]

So she transposed her life into a new key. [217] She applied for the lighthouse posting on Gannet Rock, a place so remote that the supply boat came only twice a month, after last orders at the harbor pub, when the captain was just sober enough to navigate the channel and just drunk enough to attempt it. [260]

The lighthouse suited her. [264] Its beam was a kind of fortune too -- a bright, rotating assertion flung into darkness, telling ships what was true whether they wanted to hear it or not. [292] She understood the work instinctively: by directing flow, she could orchestrate safe passage, guiding vessels through the narrow strait with the light's rhythm, two seconds on, four seconds off, a pulse that meant this island, this danger, this way home. [333]

She still wrote fortunes. [337] She couldn't stop. [340] They accumulated in mason jars on the spiral staircase, hundreds of slips curling like small white tongues. [355] Some were banal. [358] Some were strange. [361] "The door you forgot to lock is the one that was always open." [373] "What you buried at low tide will surface at high." [383] These were open secrets, truths so plain they hid in daylight, and Mei Lin had a gift for finding them and pressing them flat. [407]

The investigators came once, by helicopter, wanting to know if she'd written more fortunes that intersected with classified material. [424] She showed them the jars. [429] They photographed every slip, ran them through databases, fed them to analysts who specialized in steganography and cryptographic patterns. [445] They found nothing actionable and everything unsettling. [452] One agent pocketed a fortune on his way out -- "The man who searches for the code is already inside it" -- and later told his partner it was the most disturbing thing he'd encountered in nineteen years of counterintelligence. [486]

Mei Lin watched their helicopter shrink to a dot against the gray sky and thought about microdots, about how meaning could be compressed until it was nearly invisible, about how her fortunes worked the same way, tiny dense packets of implication that expanded inside the reader's mind like ink in water. [530]

The beam swept. [533] The rocks endured. [536] The familiar enigma of her life continued its slow rotation. [546]

She wrote a new fortune that evening, standing at the lantern room window while the Atlantic threw itself against the island's foundations. [566] "The lighthouse does not chase the ships. [573] The ships were always coming." [578] She folded it, placed it in a jar, and descended the stairs to make tea. [593]

Somewhere on the mainland, a diplomat opened a cookie at a late-night Chinese restaurant and read words Mei Lin had written three years ago, before the island, before any of it: "You will find yourself on the rocks, and there you will finally see clearly." [636]

He set the paper down, unsettled, and looked out the window toward the sea, where a light pulsed in the distance -- two seconds on, four seconds off -- orchestrating the dark, directing the flow of everything that moved through it, prophetic and accidental and utterly, openly, certain. [680]

Mei Lin drank her tea. [685] The beam turned. [688] The fortunes waited in their jars like seeds, like small folded futures, like open secrets patient enough to outlast every attempt to decode them into something less than what they were. [718]

Which was, of course, the truth. [724]
