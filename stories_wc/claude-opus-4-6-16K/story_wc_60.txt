The geese stopped over the city of forgotten fountains on a Tuesday that smelled of rust and dried moss. [18] Their migration paused — not for rest, but for something older, a hesitation written into the flight paths of their ancestors. [36] Maren noticed. [38] She always noticed things that others waved away. [46]

She was what the archivists called a luminous skeptic: someone whose doubt burned so brightly it illuminated everything it touched. [65] She did not believe the city's fountains had ever held memories. [76] She did not believe the old songs about water carrying voices of the dead. [89] But she was realistically imaginative enough to understand that disbelief did not equal disinterest, and that something real always hid beneath every myth worth repeating. [112]

The geese had paused. [116] According to the fragmentary journals she'd found in the sub-basement of the municipal library, that pause marked the beginning of a window — a brief opening when whatever the fountains had once contained could be reached again. [148]

Maren carried her grandmother's stained glass box under one arm. [158] It was small, hexagonal, its panels depicting six fountains in jewel-toned glass — amber, violet, cerulean. [173] Her grandmother had pressed it into her hands years ago with shaking fingers and a single instruction: "When you're ready to stop doubting everything, open it." [198]

She hadn't opened it. [202] But she hadn't discarded it either. [208]

The city sprawled around her in its defiant hush — a quiet that felt less like silence and more like a held breath. [228] The fountains stood everywhere: in courtyards choked with ivy, at intersections where streets braided together, in the centers of plazas where pigeons roosted on dry stone basins. [254] Hundreds of fountains, all dry, all forgotten. [261] The city had paved over their pipes decades ago, rerouting water to practical purposes. [274] No one remembered what the fountains had truly been for. [283]

No one except the breadcrumbs. [288]

They were nearly literal. [292] Small tiles of colored glass, embedded in the pavement at irregular intervals, catching light when the angle was right. [309] Maren had mapped them over seven months with sidereal patience, charting their positions against the constellations the way old navigators once charted coastlines. [332] Each tile corresponded to a star's position on a specific date. [343] Each pointed toward a different fountain. [349] Together, they formed a path — and by following breadcrumbs this precise, she had traced that path from the outermost ring of the city inward, fountain by fountain, toward whatever center held them all together. [384]

She followed it now. [388] Through the quiet district where laundry hung motionless above empty streets. [399] Past the fountain shaped like clasped hands. [406] Past the fountain whose basin held only dead leaves and a child's shoe. [418] The breadcrumbs led her to the fountain she'd calculated would be the terminus: a small, unadorned basin in a courtyard behind a shuttered bakery, its stone lip cracked and darkened with age. [452]

Maren set the stained glass box on the basin's edge. [462] Her doubt hummed inside her, bright and relentless. [471] Memories could not be trapped in stone. [478] Water did not carry the dead. [484] And yet her grandmother's voice echoed — not mystically, but in the ordinary way the words of those we lose persist in the living. [505]

She pressed the clasp. [509] The box resisted, its hinges corroded and seized. [518] She worked at them, patiently, methodically, until she felt something unstick — not just the metal, but something beneath it, a release that traveled through her fingertips and down into the stone itself. [550]

The fountain did not roar to life. [557] There was no dramatic torrent. [562] Instead, a thin film of water rose from somewhere deep below, covering the basin's floor like a mirror. [579] And in that mirror Maren saw: her grandmother at seven, laughing in this very courtyard. [593] A woman she didn't recognize, weeping beside this basin. [602] A man whispering someone's name into the water as though it could carry the sound forward through decades. [618] Layers of moments, preserved not by magic but by whatever strange mechanism the city's builders had engineered into the stone — something between acoustics and mineral chemistry, something she could spend a lifetime studying and unraveling. [653]

The trapped memories surfaced one by one, released by the vibration of the unsticking, carried on water thin as breath. [672] Maren watched them with the luminous doubt that was also, she understood now, a species of reverence — the willingness to look without flinching at what she could not yet explain. [701]

Above her, the geese resumed their flight. [708] The pause was over. [712]

She closed the stained glass box gently, its purpose fulfilled but its panels still glowing faintly in the courtyard's dim light, and turned to map the next tile, the next fountain. [743] There were hundreds left. [747] She had the patience of stars. [753]
