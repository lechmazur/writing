The drift-ice marina groaned beneath her feet like something alive and tired of living, which Margot found appropriate. [19]

She had come to Svalbard the way she had come to everything in the last four months — sideways, through a series of decisions that looked irrational from the outside but carried their own interior logic, the way a river carries silt toward the sea. [55] She was sixty-three years old, and she had woken up changed. [65]

The stroke had been minor, the doctors said. [73] A transient ischemic attack, they called it, as though giving it a Latin-adjacent name could make it polite. [90] But when Margot opened her eyes in the hospital in Zurich, where she had traveled to finalize arrangements with the clinic, she found that the world had shifted on some axis she couldn't name. [121] Colors seemed provisional. [124] Sounds arrived a half-second late, like subtitles poorly synced. [133] She gripped reality loosely now, the way you hold a bird you're deciding whether to release. [148]

She had been a euthanasia tourist — that was the frank term, and she preferred frank terms. [165] Terminal diagnosis, eighteen months, the slow erasure of her motor functions by a disease that would leave her mind clear enough to witness its own imprisonment. [189] She had chosen Zurich. [193] She had chosen the date. [198] She had folded her patience into a neat square and placed it in the drawer beside her passport. [215]

Then the stroke unfolded it. [220]

Not because it healed anything — it didn't — but because it gave her a preview. [235] For eleven seconds, she had been inside the ending, and the ending had a sound. [250] Not silence, as she'd expected. [255] A low, resonant hum, like wind through the rigging of a ship at anchor. [269] When she came back, she wanted to hear it again. [279] Not to die. [282] To learn the sound of approaching endings, to recognize the frequency before it arrived for good. [296]

So she postponed the clinic. [301] She signed up for disaster relief volunteering through a Norwegian NGO, because disasters were where endings congregated, and she could trawl through their aftermath for that particular note. [329] They sent her north. [333]

The drift-ice marina served as the staging area for relief operations along the coast, where early-season ice collapses had destroyed fishing infrastructure in three villages. [357] Pontoons rose and fell between slabs of grey-white ice. [366] Supply boats came and went. [371] Margot sorted provisions, tagged cargo, and rode the tenders out to shattered docks where men and women stood looking at the remnants of their livelihoods with expressions she recognized from her own bathroom mirror. [403]

She carried her mother's heirloom lace parasol, which was absurd in the Arctic, and she knew it. [420] But the tip — brass, tarnished, engraved with a pattern of forget-me-nots — had become her talisman. [436] She used it to test the stability of ice, tapping ahead of her steps the way a blind woman uses a cane. [457] The other volunteers thought her eccentric. [463] She let them. [466]

Weeks passed. [468] She listened. [470] In the creak of ice shelves calving into black water, she heard something close. [483] In the silence after a supply crate slipped from a crane and shattered across the dock, closer still. [499] A fold in patience — that was what this required. [509] Not the flat, enduring patience of waiting rooms, but a patience that doubled back on itself, that allowed her to be simultaneously ready and unhurried. [533]

One evening, standing at the marina's edge, the parasol tip resting against the frozen planking, she heard it. [550] Wind came across the ice field carrying the sound of a distant shelf collapse, and the hum threaded through it — that same low resonance from her eleven seconds of absence. [579] It moved through her chest like a vowel the world was trying to pronounce. [593]

She closed her eyes. [597] She did not feel afraid. [602]

The wind carried solace, and the solace had weight — not the weightlessness of denial, but the gravity of recognition. [621] She understood now that the ending had its own music, and that knowing the melody did not mean you had to sing it today. [644]

She picked up the parasol, turned from the edge, and walked back toward the supply tent where there was still work to be done, ice to test, cargo to sort, patience to fold and fold again. [679] Somewhere ahead of her, the sound waited. [687] It would come when it came. [693] She would know it when it did. [700]

Margot tapped the brass tip against the dock — once, twice — and followed its small percussion into the remainder of her life. [720]
