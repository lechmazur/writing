The mist always thickened at twilight, filling the atrium like breath held too long, and that was how Lenora knew the calling had begun. [23]

She adjusted the strap of her satchel and stepped through the glass doors into the vast, open-roofed chamber where fog pooled between marble columns and the last daylight bled copper through suspended water droplets. [55] This was the hour when the dead called, when whatever membrane separated the gone from the remaining grew thin enough to tremble, and Lenora's job was to trace who they reached. [85]

She was, by formal title, a contact tracer for hearts. [95] The municipality employed eleven of them, though most people didn't know the role existed. [109] When someone died, their emotional bonds didn't sever cleanly. [118] They pulsed outward, seeking the living hearts they'd loved, and those reverberations could destabilize a grieving person so completely that they stopped eating, stopped answering doors, stopped being findable at all. [148] Lenora's work was to identify the vulnerable recipients before the signal overwhelmed them, to arrive at their homes and assure them that the weight pressing against their ribs was not madness, not punishment, but the last radiance of someone who had loved them. [189]

Tonight she was tracking a particular signal, and she was using the only instrument sensitive enough to catch it: a decades-old hearing aid that had belonged to a man named Emil Covas, dead now forty-one days. [224] The device, analog and half-corroded, still carried the unique calibration of Emil's auditory world, and when Lenora held it near her ear, she could detect the faint pulses his departed heart was sending, like sonar pings mapped onto frequencies only his hearing aid had ever amplified. [271] By tracking those faint pulses, she could follow the signal to its living target. [285]

She was persistently curious by nature, which was both her qualification and her affliction. [298] Other tracers logged their cases and moved on. [307] Lenora lingered. [309] She studied the textures of each bond, wondered why some dead loved loudly while others barely whispered, catalogued the patterns in a notebook she showed no one. [337] It was this curiosity that had led her to Emil's case in the first place, because his signal was anomalous: not directed at a spouse or child, but at someone the municipal records couldn't identify. [369]

She moved deeper into the atrium, where the mist was so dense it erased her feet. [384] The hearing aid crackled, and the pulse grew stronger near the eastern colonnade. [396] There, on a stone bench, sat a woman Lenora had never catalogued. [408] She was perhaps seventy, wrapped in a coat too large for her, holding a photograph in both hands as though it were something alive and slipping away. [433]

Lenora approached quietly and sat beside her. [441] The woman didn't look up. [446] Her lips were moving without sound, the way the most vulnerable ones spoke, as if their voices had already begun to follow the dead down. [471] This was precisely the kind of person Lenora existed to protect, someone whose voice was so fragile it could be pulled under by love alone. [495]

"That's Emil," Lenora said gently, glancing at the photograph. [505] The image showed a young man and a young woman standing in this very atrium, decades ago, the glass roof clear and the plants green and nothing between them but sunlight. [534] It was, Lenora understood, the last photograph they'd taken together. [544]

The woman finally looked at her. [550] "He was my brother," she said, and her voice was the thinnest sound Lenora had ever followed. [567]

"He's still reaching for you," Lenora said. [575] She held out the hearing aid, and the woman stared at it, recognizing it, her eyes flooding. [591] "This feeling in your chest is not you breaking. [600] It's him, telling you he hasn't let go." [608]

Lenora had not come here to save anyone. [617] She had come to trace a signal, to satisfy a curiosity, to close a file. [631] But the woman gripped her hand and sobbed with the full force of someone who had been silent for forty-one days, and in that reeling hush of the mist-clad atrium, Lenora held on, understanding that heroism was almost always incidental, almost always just the act of showing up with the right tenderness at the exact moment someone needed to be told they were not alone. [694]

She did not let go until the woman's breathing steadied and the twilight passed and the mist began, at last, to lift. [717]

The calling faded. [720] The atrium grew quiet. [724] Lenora closed her notebook, tucked the hearing aid back into her satchel, and walked the woman home through streets still damp with what the evening had left behind. [750]

She would file the report tomorrow. [757] Tonight, protecting this one vulnerable voice was enough. [765]
