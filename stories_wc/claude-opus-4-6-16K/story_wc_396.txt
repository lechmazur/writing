The orchard grew where no orchard should, its roots threaded through frozen basalt on a promontory above the grinding ice floes of the Kael Strait. [27] Apple trees lined the path to the lighthouse in crooked rows, their branches heavy with fruit that tasted faintly of salt and cold iron. [49] Maren walked among them every morning, checking the limbs for frost damage, listening to the deep percussive groaning of ice plates colliding far below. [70] She was the peacekeeper of the Strait settlements, and the shadows she carried were not metaphorical. [84]

They laced her arms in dark filaments, souvenirs of every conflict she had absorbed and quieted over eleven years of service. [102] Each shadow was a violence she had stepped between, a rage she had drawn into herself so it would not land on flesh. [123] Other peacekeepers burned their shadows out in annual purges, but Maren kept hers, calmly intuitive about their worth. [140] She believed that to forget a conflict was to misunderstand the next one. [152]

In the cellar beneath the lighthouse, she kept a shop of sorts, though no one bought anything. [168] Salvage from wrecked vessels filled the shelves: chronometers, oil paintings, a taxidermied albatross with glass eyes. [183] And mirrors, dozens of them, their frames carved in styles spanning two centuries of craft, leaning against stone walls and reflecting each other in corridors of diminishing light. [210] Maren called it her vintage store, half-joking, half-reverent. [219]

She also kept, in a lead-lined box on the highest shelf, a broken crystal ball fragment the size of a child's fist. [240] It had belonged to the last seer of the Strait, who had died when the lighthouse was young. [258] The fragment showed nothing on its own, only a milky opacity that warmed when held. [272] But Maren had discovered, by accident and then by practice, that when she positioned it between two of the old mirrors at the correct angle, images surfaced in the glass, scenes from the settlements she protected, rendered in the silvered depths with startling intimacy. [313]

A woman clutching a kitchen knife and weeping. [321] Two brothers dividing a boat with a saw. [329] A child sitting alone on an ice floe that had broken free, drifting. [341]

Through these glimpses in the vintage store mirrors, Maren could reconstitute what the seer's shattered instrument once provided whole: a map of suffering in real time, fragmented but legible if she was patient enough. [374] She used it not to predict but to understand, to see the emotional architecture of a dispute before she arrived to mediate it. [396] Her goal was always the same, the principle she had carved into the lighthouse door frame: to map empathy onto action. [416] To feel precisely what each party felt and then, from that shared terrain, find the path that spared everyone the most damage. [437]

This made her a courageous anomaly among peacekeepers, who were trained to remain detached, to adjudicate from neutral ground. [455] Maren's method required the opposite. [460] She absorbed. [462] She carried. [464] The shadows on her arms proved the cost. [471]

Today the mirrors showed her something she had never seen: herself. [482] Not her reflection, which was always present, but herself as others perceived her, shadow-laced and arriving at their doors. [500] She saw fear in the faces of people she thought trusted her. [512] She saw a mother pull her son behind her back. [522] She saw an old fisherman make a warding sign. [531]

The ice groaned below, a sound like the earth reconsidering its shape. [543] Maren set the crystal fragment down and pressed her palms against the nearest mirror's cold surface. [558] The shadows on her arms pulsed faintly, each one a story of someone else's pain she had swallowed. [575] She had thought carrying them was courage. [582] Now she wondered if it was something closer to greed, a hoarding of suffering that frightened the very people she meant to protect. [601]

She stood in the weighted breath before reply, that stretched silence between question and answer where the real decision lives. [620] The mirrors waited. [623] The fragment glowed on its shelf. [629] Somewhere across the ice, a dispute was forming that would call her out before nightfall. [644]

Maren exhaled and began, carefully, to release the oldest shadow from her left wrist. [658] It rose like smoke and dissipated against the cellar ceiling. [668] The loss was immediate and specific: she could no longer recall the precise fury of a fisherman named Darvo, who had tried to burn his neighbor's nets eight years ago. [696] But something else replaced it, lighter, less certain. [704] A willingness to arrive without already knowing, to ask rather than absorb, to let the people she served hold their own pain and teach her its shape in their own words. [735]

She climbed the stairs into the orchard, where the apples hung like small red lanterns against the grey sky, and walked toward the ice. [759]
