She had been the library's guardian for so long that she no longer remembered which dimension had made her feral. [20]

The frozen garden stretched around the ruins of the old reading hall, every hedge and fountain locked in permanent frost, mist curling between the ice-sheathed topiaries like breath from a sleeping mouth. [51] This was her territory now — the place where the boundaries of light dissolved into something softer, where dawn never fully arrived and dusk never fully committed, where the world existed in a state of foggy lucidity that matched the inside of her skull. [89]

She crouched on the stone wall that bordered the garden's eastern edge, her fingers raw and blue, her hair matted with frost crystals that she never bothered to shake loose. [118] Books lined the interior of the wall itself — she had mortared them there years ago, pressing their spines into the gaps between stones, interiorizing exteriors until the boundary between shelter and story ceased to exist. [150] The garden was her library now. [156] The library was her garden. [161] Every surface held text if you knew how to read the ice. [173]

The pendant hung from a wire threaded through the wall's capstone, turning slowly in the mist. [189] It had belonged to a cultist — one of the hooded figures who occasionally stumbled through the garden seeking a door to somewhere else. [212] This particular cultist had not survived the crossing. [220] She'd found the pendant clutched in a frozen hand half-buried in the lavender bed, its surface carved with symbols that hummed at frequencies she could feel in her teeth. [248] She kept it because it reminded her of home. [258]

Not this home. [261] The other one. [264]

She was dimensionally homesick in the way that only someone who has passed through multiple realities can be — not for a specific place, but for a specific quality of existence. [294] The dimension she'd come from had a different relationship with light. [305] There, brightness was not the opposite of darkness but its continuation, the way inhaling continues exhaling. [319] Here, light had edges. [323] It stopped at walls, cowered from corners, and died every evening as though it had never existed. [339] The boundaries of light in this world were sharp and merciless, and they made her ache. [355]

So she had learned to wait. [361]

Waiting was the only action that made sense in the frozen garden, where time moved through the veil of sleep — not unconscious, not awake, but suspended in the luminous membrane between the two states. [396] She waited the way ice waits for spring: not with hope, not with despair, but with a patience so absolute it became a form of being. [425] She waited beside her wall of books, listening to the mist settle on the frozen rosebushes, feeling the pendant hum its alien hymn. [448]

Her motivation was simple and impossible. [454] She wanted to make friends with uncertainty. [461]

Every guardian she had known — in this dimension and the ones before — had tried to eliminate uncertainty, to lock the doors, to catalog every volume, to know what lay on every shelf. [493] That approach had driven them all mad, or dead, or into the hooded robes of cultists seeking yet another door. [514] She had chosen differently. [518] She would sit with not-knowing the way one sits with a stray animal, offering no food, making no sudden movements, simply sharing space until trust became possible. [543]

The mist thickened. [546] Somewhere in the garden, a book cracked open — frost splitting its spine — and released a sentence into the air like a sigh. [567] She heard it, or felt it, the words dissolving before they reached her conscious mind, absorbed instead through the skin, through the cold, through the luminous uncertainty of the space between sleeping and waking. [600]

She was interiorizing exteriors again. [605] The garden's mist became her thought. [611] The frozen fountain became her stillness. [617] The pendant's hum became the frequency of her longing, calibrated now to this world even as it echoed the one she'd lost. [638]

A shape moved at the garden's far edge — another traveler, another seeker, stumbling through the frost with hands outstretched. [657] She watched without moving. [661] They always came eventually, drawn by the books in the walls, by the humming pendant, by the strange quality of light that refused to behave like light. [685]

She would not chase them. [690] She would not hide. [695] She would wait, feral and patient, until the mist decided what this encounter would become. [710]

The boundaries of light shifted, softened, and for one breath the garden glowed the way her lost dimension had glowed — continuous, edgeless, whole. [733]

Then it passed, and she was still here, and that was enough. [745]
