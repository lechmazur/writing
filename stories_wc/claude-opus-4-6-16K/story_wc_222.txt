The sky was wrong. [4] Maren knew it the moment she stepped onto the frost-shattered balcony of the Kethalan Spire and looked up. [22] The stars had rearranged themselves — not subtly, not in ways only astronomers would notice, but grotesquely, as if someone had scooped them from their ancient beds and flung them like dice across the black. [56] The constellations her master had taught her to read were gone. [67]

She pulled her coat tighter and began to climb. [76]

The spire rose above the cloudline like a needle of pale ice, so high that the air thinned to almost nothing and the world below vanished into white. [104] Maren had scaled it twice before, both times under her master's watchful eye. [117] Oduin had called her his apprentice of wonder — not because she possessed any great magical talent, but because she refused to look away from things that terrified her. [145] She embraced the unknown with open arms, even when her hands shook. [157]

Tonight they shook badly. [161]

She reached the observatory chamber near the summit and pulled herself through the cracked window. [176] Inside, the great chess table stood exactly as she remembered it — a slab of volcanic glass set with thirty-two hand-carved pieces, each one hollow, each one containing a folded slip of vellum inscribed with a secret. [212] Oduin had built the set himself over forty years. [221] Every piece held something dangerous: a formula, a name, a confession. [232] The white queen contained the true lineage of the northern king. [243] The black rook held the location of a buried plague. [253] Knowledge too volatile to publish, too vital to destroy. [262] So Oduin had locked each secret inside ivory and obsidian and set them on a board where their positions formed a cipher only he could read. [288]

Only now someone had moved them. [294]

Maren could see it immediately. [299] The endgame Oduin had maintained for decades had been disturbed — pieces shifted, swapped, the cipher scrambled into nonsense or, worse, into a new message entirely. [324] Whoever had done this wanted the secrets read in a different order. [336] They wanted to weaponize what Oduin had spent his life protecting. [347]

She knelt beside the table and drew from her breast pocket the sundial lid — a small brass disc engraved with Oduin's notation system. [370] He'd given it to her three years ago, pressing it into her palm with that sacredly playful grin of his, the one that made holy things feel like games and games feel holy. [403] "You won't need the sundial itself," he'd said. [411] "Just the lid. [414] The lid remembers where the light was supposed to fall." [424]

She understood now. [427] The engravings on the lid weren't hour-marks. [434] They were positions — the correct positions of every piece on the board. [446]

Maren worked quickly, her fingers numb in the frigid air. [456] She swapped the black bishop back to king's third. [465] Moved the white knight from its corrupted square. [473] Each piece she lifted felt heavier than wood and bone should feel, weighted with the secrets curled inside them. [492] She was a thief by trade — a chivalrous one, stealing only to return what had been taken — and this was the strangest theft of her life: stealing a chess game back into its proper shape. [527]

Piece by piece, she began to amend what had been broken. [538]

The spire groaned around her. [543] Ice cracked along the walls in long, singing fractures. [552] Above, through the observatory's shattered dome, the wrong sky pulsed — stars drifting like embers, unmoored from meaning. [569] Maren understood that the board and the sky were connected, that Oduin's cipher didn't merely protect secrets but anchored something fundamental about the order of things. [595]

She placed the final piece — the white king — onto its square with a soft click. [610]

For a moment, nothing. [614]

Then the stars moved. [618] Not chaotically, not like before, but deliberately, sliding across the dark like beads on invisible threads, finding their ancient positions, settling. [639] The constellations reformed. [642] The sky remembered itself. [646]

Maren sat back on her heels, breathing hard, the brass lid warm against her chest. [661] She thought of Oduin, wherever he was — taken, hidden, perhaps dead. [672] She thought of how he'd trained her not in spells but in attention, in the willingness to stand at the edge of comprehension and lean forward instead of back. [701]

The wind howled through the spire. [707] The stars held steady. [711]

She pocketed the lid, memorized the board, and began her descent into the clouds — into whatever unknown waited below, arms open, hands still shaking. [735]
