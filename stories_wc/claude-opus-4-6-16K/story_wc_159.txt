Seren had always been gently systematic in her work, moving row by row through the glass orchids that lined the upper galleries of the Opal Library, each translucent bloom containing a single whispered name that no living mouth remembered how to speak. [42]

The library floated above the clouds on a foundation of petrified light, its walls shifting between milky iridescence and deep fire depending on the hour. [67] Once, thousands of scholars had climbed the vapor stairs to study here. [78] Now Seren was the only caretaker left, guardian of deserted marvels that the world below had stopped believing in. [94]

She carried her tools in a satchel sewn from moth silk: a tuning fork pitched to the key of grief, a glass pipette for feeding dew to the orchids' roots, and a small journal where she transcribed every name she coaxed from the flowers before their petals clouded beyond recovery. [137] Her motivation was simple and enormous: to preserve the sound of forgotten names, because she believed that when a name lost its last echo, the person it had belonged to vanished from every layer of existence, even from dream, even from myth. [172]

This morning she knelt before Orchid 4,781, a specimen whose bell-shaped bloom had gone nearly opaque. [188] Inside, a faint vibration still pulsed -- the residue of someone called Elodi, or perhaps Elowen. [203] Seren pressed her ear to the glass and listened, but the name blurred like watercolor in rain. [218]

She reached for the wind chime that hung from the nearest shelf bracket, a set of bamboo tubes she had inherited from the caretaker before her. [241] The lowest tube was cracked -- had been cracked for years -- and it produced a tone that did not exist on any scale Seren knew. [265] That imperfect tone was precisely what she needed. [273] She struck it softly, and the fractured note threaded through the gallery, resonating with the orchid's interior until the trapped name brightened and clarified. [296]

Elowen. [297]

Seren wrote it down, her hand trembling with foxglove regret -- the quiet, poisonous sorrow of saving something beautiful only to confirm how much had already been lost. [322] Every rescued name reminded her of the hundreds she had failed to reach in time, orchids gone fully dark on forgotten shelves, their whispers dissolved into silence. [347]

She moved to the next row, working across the museum of extinct feelings that the library's eastern wing had become. [366] Here the orchids did not hold names but emotions humanity had shed over millennia: the ache of watching a constellation be renamed, the particular joy of hearing one's mother tongue spoken by a stranger in a far city, the shame of surviving what others did not. [407] These too were fading. [411] Seren cataloged them with the same reverent precision, striking the cracked bamboo tube, letting its broken music light the dim contents of each bloom the way a lantern lights a cave -- not by force, but by the echo of a long-forgotten song that the tube seemed to remember in its splintered grain. [461]

By afternoon the clouds beneath the library had turned the color of bruised peaches. [475] Seren sat at the central reading table, her journal open, pages filled with names and feelings that belonged to no one alive. [496] She wondered, as she often did, whether her own name would one day rest inside an orchid, whether some future caretaker would struggle to hear it clearly. [524]

The cracked tube swayed in a draft from the open skylight, producing its odd half-tone unbidden. [539] Seren listened. [541] Somewhere in that sound she heard the ghost of the song it had originally been tuned to, a lullaby perhaps, or an invocation. [562] She hummed along, and for a moment every orchid in the gallery flickered with pale interior light, thousands of names momentarily audible, overlapping like rain on a still lake. [590]

Then silence returned, as it always did, and Seren picked up her pipette and continued down the row, gently systematic, faithfully alone, tending the deserted marvels that the world had left in her careful, aching hands. [624]

She would not stop. [628] The names deserved their echoes, and the feelings deserved their glass-walled afterlives, and the cracked bamboo tube deserved to go on singing its imperfect song for as long as the library held above the clouds. [662]

That was enough, Seren told herself. [668] That had to be enough. [672]
