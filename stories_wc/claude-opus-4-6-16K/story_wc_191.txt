The lore keeper Senna had spent decades cataloging the ruins of the old world - not the ancient world, but the one that came after, the gleaming civilization that had built towers into the ionosphere and then vanished like signal static. [38] She was wisely adventurous, the kind who planned three escape routes before stepping through any door yet always stepped through. [57] Tonight she would need every route she had mapped. [66]

She had found the coordinates buried in a degraded holographic archive: a hidden orchard behind a kaleidoscopic waterfall, deep in the overgrown valleys of what was once the Pacific Northwest Corridor. [97] The waterfall was artificial, engineered centuries ago with prismatic nanofilaments that fractured light into impossible spectrums. [112] Even now, in the late hours before dawn, it cast shimmering curtains of color across the cliff face, fed by geothermal springs that had outlasted their creators by generations. [140]

Behind it lay the orchard. [145] Trees with chrome-bark trunks still bore fruit - small, luminous globes that hummed faintly with residual bioelectric charge. [162] The lore keeper moved through their rows reverently, her field recorder capturing everything. [175] Each tree had been a data node once, part of a living network that spanned continents. [190] Now they were monuments. [194] Beautiful, disconnected, slowly forgetting. [198]

She had until sunrise. [202] The prismatic waterfall's light-play shifted with the sun's angle, and once dawn broke, the entrance would seal behind a curtain of concentrated refraction capable of burning exposed skin in seconds. [232] She had entered at midnight. [237] Six hours remained. [240] Maybe less. [242]

Her motivation had drawn her across two continents and through three hostile territories: to find the stairway of ascension. [261] In every archive she had studied, every oral tradition she had transcribed from the wandering tribes, the stairway appeared as the singular path to the unclaimed throne - the seat of authority over the old network, the master terminal that no one had ever activated. [304] The civilization that built it had collapsed in its own brilliance before choosing a sovereign. [319] The throne waited still, humming in its chamber, an entire world's dormant infrastructure ready to answer whoever climbed those steps and spoke the first command. [344]

Senna pressed her palm against the orchard's central tree, the largest, its bark warm and faintly pulsing beneath her touch. [363] She felt the texture shift beneath her fingers. [371] Paint. [372] Layers upon layers of paint, applied over centuries by pilgrims, seekers, and fools who had come here before her and failed. [392] Each layer was a record of someone's attempt - symbols, crude maps, desperate warnings scrawled in pigment and hope. [409] She began to peel. [413]

The paint came away in thin, brittle sheets. [421] Beneath the first layer, crude arrows pointed downward. [429] Beneath the second, a mural of a staircase spiraling into a crown of golden light. [443] Beneath the third, a warning in a dead language she happened to read fluently: "The throne does not want you." [461] She kept peeling. [464] Through the peel of successive paint layers, hidden murals emerged - older, far more precise, etched by the original engineers themselves. [483] A schematic. [485] A map of root systems beneath the orchard floor, and there, marked in pigment that still faintly glowed, the entrance. [504]

A ruby flake fell from the deepest layer into her palm. [514] Not paint. [516] Not pigment. [518] A shard of crystallized data-glass, red as arterial blood, encoded with a single resonant frequency. [533] She held it up to the prismatic light and it sang - a clear tone that vibrated through the chrome-bark trees until the ground beneath the central trunk groaned open, revealing stairs descending into darkness. [566]

Senna did not hesitate. [570] She chose to sally forth into the passage below, her boots finding stone steps that should not have existed beneath engineered soil. [590] The air tasted of ozone and ancient rain. [598] The walls pulsed with dormant circuitry that flickered awake as the ruby flake in her fist broadcast its tone. [617]

The stairway of ascension did not lead up. [625] It plunged down first into the bedrock, then curved and rose sharply, spiraling inside what must have been a structural column for the original tower. [650] She climbed. [652] Her legs burned. [655] The light grew. [658]

She emerged into a vaulted chamber where the unclaimed throne sat upon a platform of woven light, still waiting after all these centuries for someone who understood what power meant. [687] Dawn was minutes away. [691] She could feel the waterfall above shifting, the orchard sealing itself behind her. [704]

She had not come to visit. [710]

Senna sat down. [713] The network exhaled around her, vast and ancient and suddenly awake. [724] Somewhere across the broken world, old systems remembered how to listen. [735]

She would give them something worth hearing. [742]
