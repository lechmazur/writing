The tax on thoughts came first as a whisper, then as legislation, then as the tiny electrodes they fitted behind your ear at the post office. [28] After that, every flicker of imagination, every rebellious synapse, every dream that deviated from approved patterns got flagged, quantified, and invoiced. [47] Most people learned to think in beige. [54] Maren Voss did not. [58]

She was a charming rogue scholar, the kind who'd been expelled from three universities not for incompetence but for knowing too much and saying it with a grin that made administrators feel personally insulted. [89] Her specialty had been entomology, but she'd drifted through linguistics, cryptography, and horticulture with the restless appetite of someone who refused to let her mind be partitioned into billable categories. [115] Now she operated out of Dr. Liang's abandoned greenhouse on the eastern edge of the city, a cathedral of cracked glass and creeping vines where pinned moth specimens still lined the walls and the air smelled of soil and naphthalene. [150]

The entomologist's greenhouse was perfect precisely because no one cared about it. [162] The Thought Revenue Bureau monitored libraries, lecture halls, anywhere ideas might congregate and metastasize. [175] But a greenhouse full of dead beetles and overgrown ferns? [185] Invisible. [186]

This was where the secret language club met every Thursday at dusk. [198]

Maren had founded it eighteen months ago with four members. [208] Now there were thirty-one, arriving in staggered intervals, each carrying a gardening tote or a bag of potting soil as cover. [230] They came to learn Verek, the language Maren had constructed from scratch, a tongue with no digital footprint, no algorithmic signature, no taxable resonance. [254] Its grammar was built on patterns borrowed from moth wing venation and its vocabulary shifted every lunar cycle, which meant the Bureau's pattern-detection AI could never lock onto it long enough to parse meaning. [286]

When newcomers asked Maren to explain the language plainly, she'd smile and say something candidly cryptic, like, "Verek isn't something you learn; it's something you become allergic to forgetting." [314] They'd stare. [316] She'd hand them a worksheet shaped like a luna moth. [326] Eventually, they understood. [329]

But Verek needed to spread beyond the greenhouse, and that was where the gardens came in. [344]

Maren had spent months joining community gardens across the city, six in total, each in a different district. [362] In every plot she tended, she planted message patterns: specific arrangements of flowers, herbs, and vegetables whose positions encoded Verek phrases when read as a grid. [389] Marigold-basil-fennel might mean "meeting moved to Wednesday." [396] A diagonal of sunflowers could signal danger. [403] The gardens were living billboards for the resistance, and no one scanning satellite imagery for seditious content would think twice about a community cucumber patch. [425]

The system worked until the night Jonas Krey walked in carrying a gourd rattle seed. [439]

He placed it on the potting bench like a chess piece. [450] "Bureau's developing a new sensor," he said, breathless. [458] "Botanical. They're going to read the gardens." [465]

Silence colonized the greenhouse. [469] Thirty-one people stared at the seed, this humble dried kernel from a gourd rattle, the kind children shook at harvest festivals. [489] Jonas explained: the Bureau planned to seed municipal gardens with gourd rattle plants modified to function as biological microphones, their hollow chambers vibrating in response to nearby speech, transmitting data through root-network fungi. [519]

"They're going to warp our own method against us," Maren murmured. [529]

For a moment the converging chaos of it, the elegance of the Bureau's counter-move colliding with eighteen months of careful construction, nearly buckled her. [551] She picked up the gourd rattle seed and rolled it between her fingers, feeling its dry weight, its potential to unmake everything. [571]

Then she laughed. [574]

"We plant them ourselves," she said. [580] "We plant them first, in our grids, and we encode Verek into their placement. The Bureau thinks they're installing surveillance; instead they're propagating our language. Every garden they infiltrate becomes another page of our dictionary." [611]

The room exhaled. [614] Someone in the back whispered the Verek word for "defiance," a sound like wind through hollow reeds, and others picked it up until the greenhouse hummed with it. [641]

Maren pocketed the seed. [645] She thought about the tax collectors, the electrodes, the quiet erosion of every interior spark. [658] She thought about why she did any of this: to stand guard over her own spark of defiance, and to teach others how to guard theirs. [683]

The moths on the walls watched with pinned, unblinking eyes as the secret language club bent over their worksheets, learning new words for a world that had tried to make words cost too much to speak. [718]

Outside, the city hummed with taxable thoughts. [725] Inside, something older and wilder took root. [732]
