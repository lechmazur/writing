The Syndicate's latest automatons could compose symphonies in seven seconds, paint masterworks in twelve, and weave enchantments that made even the Archmages redundant. [23] Elara watched one such construct spin a levitation charm from raw aether, its crystalline fingers never trembling, never doubting, and she felt the familiar ache of being unnecessary. [51]

She was, by every measure the academies kept, an underachieving mage. [62] Her spells flickered. [65] Her wards sagged. [68] Her transmutations produced results that her instructors called "approximate." [77] But she had noticed something the constructs could not: after their perfect enchantments faded, nothing remained. [93] No warmth. [95] No residue of intention. [99] When her own clumsy light-charms dissolved, they left behind a faint glow that clung to surfaces for hours -- sometimes days. [119] Lingering luminance, her grandmother had called it, the signature of a soul that meant what it made. [136]

Her grandmother's garden folly had been demolished three years ago to make room for an automated greenhouse. [153] Elara had saved one thing: the keystone from the folly's arch, a rough wedge of limestone carved with spiraling vines that her grandmother had shaped by hand over an entire summer. [184] It was imperfect. [187] One vine curled the wrong direction. [193] A leaf was too large. [198] And yet, when Elara held it, the stone accommodated impossibilities -- warmth in freezing air, steadiness in trembling hands, the faint impression that her grandmother was still nearby, still carving, still humming. [229]

She had carried the keystone strapped to her pack for nine hundred miles, north through the automated cities where constructs painted murals no one stopped to see, past the last human settlements where people still grew herbs by hand and sang to their bread as it rose. [276] Now she stood at the base of the Albic Spire, an icebound needle of rock that pierced the cloudline and rose into a sky so dark and clear it looked like polished obsidian. [309]

The only way up was mist walking -- stepping onto the clouds themselves, treating vapor as solid ground through sheer belief. [329] The constructs could not do it. [335] Mist walking required faith in the absurd, trust in what should not hold, and the constructs operated on certainty alone. [355]

Elara unstrapped the keystone from her pack and held it against her chest. [368] The limestone was warm. [372] The carved vines pressed into her palms like living things. [382] She stepped onto the first wisp of cloud and it held. [393]

She climbed. [395]

Each step was a negotiation with impossibility. [402] The mist shifted beneath her, sometimes translucent, sometimes thick as marble, responding not to her skill but to her willingness to believe it would support her. [428] Frost gathered on her eyelashes. [433] The air thinned. [436] The brilliant dimness of the upper atmosphere surrounded her -- sunlight scattered through ice crystals into something that was simultaneously blinding and shadowed, luminous and hushed, as though the sky itself could not decide between day and night. [473]

She reached the summit at dusk, or what passed for dusk above the clouds. [487] The spire's peak was a flat table of ice no wider than a doorway, and the wind had died to nothing. [508] Silence so complete it felt architectural. [514]

Elara knelt and placed the keystone on the ice. [523]

She did not cast a spell. [530] She did not invoke formulae or channel structured aether the way the academies taught. [544] She simply pressed her hands to the stone and remembered: her grandmother humming, the smell of cut limestone, sunlight through the folly's arch falling in a pattern that looked like laughter. [575]

The keystone glowed. [578]

Not brightly -- not the way construct-light blazed, sterile and perfect and forgettable. [590] This was a dim radiance, warm and stubborn, the color of candlelight through old glass. [605] It spread across the ice, sank into the frost, and held. [616] Minutes passed. [618] The glow did not fade. [623] Lingering luminance. [625] The signature of something meant. [630]

Below the clouds, the constructs continued their perfect, empty work. [640] Up here, on a frozen point above the world, an underachieving mage knelt beside a crooked keystone and wept -- not from sadness, but from the unbearable recognition that the sacred had been here all along, hiding in the simple things, waiting for someone clumsy and faithful enough to find it. [690]

The light held through the night. [696]

It was still glowing when the sun returned. [704]
