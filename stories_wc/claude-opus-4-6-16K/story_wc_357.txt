The orchard planet had no name, only a frequency — a low hum that traveled through its floating rock arches like breath through hollowed bone. [27] Maren flew beneath the largest arch, her glider tilting into the current of mist that threaded between stone and canopy. [46] She was an orchard pilot, one of the few who dared navigate the labyrinth of suspended geology and root-tangled sky, and she had been flying for eleven years without once finding what she sought. [77]

Today the silence was different. [82] It whirled. [84] Not wind, not sound, but the particular stillness that precedes inversion — the hour when gravity flips and everything rooted tears upward, everything airborne crashes down. [107] She had twenty minutes before it began. [114]

Her method was old and unorthodox: navigating by water flow. [124] On a world where stone floated and trees grew sideways from arches, magnetic compasses spun uselessly and star-charts warped in the atmospheric refraction. [146] But water still obeyed its own truth. [153] It ran from high pressure to low, pooled where density gathered, and streamed in rivulets along the undersides of the arches toward some unseen convergence point she had spent years tracing. [183] Each expedition brought her closer. [188] Each time, the water led deeper into the planet's floating interior, toward a place the other pilots called the Gathering. [208]

She banked left, following a ribbon of water that crawled along a moss-covered arch. [223] The moss was impossibly green, thick as fur, and she noticed — as she always did near the center — that the growth here accelerated beyond reason. [249] Seeds she had dropped on previous flights had become full orchards in weeks. [262] Fruit swelled and split and reseeded before she could return to harvest. [274] Something at the core of this world accelerates plant growth, feeding the endless orchards that made the planet valuable and mysterious in equal measure. [296]

She wanted to understand why. [301] Not for profit, not for science exactly, but because Maren had watched her own resilience fracture over the years — grief, isolation, the slow erosion of purpose — and she believed that whatever force kept this world regenerating despite its impossible physics might teach her something about endurance. [344] To find the source of resilience: that was the compass needle her heart followed when water led the way. [363]

The inversion hit early. [367]

Her stomach lurched as gravity reversed and the glider slammed upward. [379] She cut the engine, let the craft flip, reoriented by instinct. [391] Trees ripped from their holds on the arches, roots clawing air, and for one surreal minute the sky was full of falling orchards rising. [416] Water reversed too, streaming upward in silver columns, and Maren followed, riding the inverted flow toward the convergence she had always calculated but never reached. [443]

There, at the heart of the floating arches, she discovered it. [454]

A hollow sphere of stone, open at the top and bottom, suspended in the center of the world's architecture. [472] Inside, the water converged and spiraled in weightless rotation, and embedded in the inner wall — half-consumed by root and mineral — was a broken arrow tip. [499] Ancient. [500] Not from this world. [504] Its edge was fractured, its shaft long gone, but the stone around it pulsed with bioluminescence, and from that pulse radiated waves she could feel in her teeth, her fingernails, the roots of her hair. [539]

A gathering of echoes. [543] Every sound the planet had ever made — every creak of wood, every splitting fruit, every pilot's shout absorbed by the arches — returned here, layered and compressed into a resonance that fed the growth. [576] The broken arrow tip was the seed of it, some ancient projectile that had struck this world and fractured, and in fracturing had created a wound the planet spent millennia healing, over and over, the act of healing itself becoming the engine of impossible fertility. [617]

Maren hung inverted in her harness, tears falling upward, and understood. [628] Resilience was not the absence of breaking. [635] It was the echo of every break, gathering, converging, becoming the force that drives new growth from old wounds. [653] The arrow tip had never healed. [659] It did not need to. [664] Its brokenness was the source. [669]

Gravity returned. [671] She fell gently back into the world's normal orientation, the water resuming its downward search, the orchards settling into their arches with sighs of rustling leaves. [695] The whirling silence closed around her like an embrace. [705]

She flew home slowly, following the water, carrying nothing but the knowledge that what was broken in her was not a failure but a frequency — one that, given time and convergence, could grow something she had not yet imagined. [745]
