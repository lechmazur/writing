The orchard garden revealed itself only after the last patron left the hedge maze attraction each evening, after the ticket booth shuttered and the groundskeeper locked the iron gate. [32] That was when the walls of privet shifted, groaning like old theater curtains, and the hidden heart of the maze opened into rows of silver-barked apple trees hung with fruit that hummed in colors only Marguerite could taste. [65]

She had been dead for forty-seven years, though the number meant less than it once might have. [80] Time here did not flow; it fractured, splintering into overlapping moments that layered like transparencies on an old projector. [96] Some nights the orchard bloomed in 1978, the year she performed her final encore at the Alabaster Theatre before the chandelier fell. [117] Other nights it ripened in decades she had never known alive, and the apples sang frequencies that tasted of cinnamon and electric blue. [138]

Marguerite was synesthetically blessed, even in death. [145] Every sound carried flavor, every color carried weight against her phantom skin. [156] She had loved the stage for this reason: applause tasted of warm bread, and the gasp of an audience smelled of rain on copper. [178] Now she wandered the orchard after closing, producing echoes of performances she had given and performances she had only dreamed of giving. [198] Her voice would leave her mouth and split against the fractured timeline, returning to her as harmonics from three or four overlapping eras at once. [222] The echoes intertwined with one another, braiding past and future into a sound so rich it made the apple blossoms open out of season. [245]

She kept a single possession: a hand-painted tarot coin she had carried in her costume pocket the night she died. [265] One side depicted the Fool stepping toward a cliff's edge, bright with possibility. [277] The other showed the Tower struck by lightning, its crown shattering. [287] A prop master had given it to her before the final act, whispering that it was lucky. [302] She turned it endlessly between her translucent fingers, feeling the ridges of paint like braille, tasting the pigment as burnt honey and violet. [322]

Tonight the orchard settled into a version of itself that felt closer to the present. [337] The apples were small and green, not yet ripe, and the air carried the astringent tang of fresh growth. [355] Marguerite sensed someone in the maze beyond the hedge wall, lingering after the business had closed. [370] She pressed her ear to the privet and heard breathing--ragged, the kind that follows weeping. [384]

She began to sing. [388]

Not loudly. [390] She chose a lullaby she had once performed in a production of a play whose name the fractured timeline had scattered from her memory. [412] The melody left her lips and echoed, multiplying through the layered years, each reflection adding a new harmonic until the sound was orchestral, ancient, impossibly tender. [438] The echoes threaded through the hedge, finding gaps between leaves, intertwining with the stranger's stuttered breath until the two rhythms fell into sync. [460]

On the other side of the hedge, a young woman named Darla sat on the gravel path with her knees drawn up, mascara streaking her cheeks. [484] She had come to the maze hoping to lose herself and had succeeded too well. [498] She did not believe in ghosts, but she believed in music, and the sound pouring through the leaves tasted--she would later swear--of warm bread and something unbearably kind. [527]

Marguerite pressed the tarot coin against the hedge. [535] The paint glowed faintly, Fool-side outward, and the privet parted just enough for the coin to tumble through onto the gravel at Darla's feet. [560]

Darla picked it up. [564] The Fool smiled at her from the edge of his painted cliff, and for the first time in weeks, she felt the vertigo of possibility rather than the vertigo of falling. [593]

The hedge sealed itself. [597] Marguerite stepped back into the orchard, the echoes of her lullaby still ringing in overlapping years, each repetition softer, each one tasting more sweetly of something she could almost call peace. [626] She had no audience to call for an encore, but the trees held their fruit toward her like open hands, and the fractured timeline folded gently around the moment, preserving it in amber. [658]

Beyond the hedge, Darla stood, pocketed the coin, and walked toward the locked gate, which she found inexplicably open. [677] She stepped through into a night that smelled of apples and rain on copper, carrying with her a small, warm certainty that someone unseen had refused to let her stay at the brink. [710]

In the orchard, Marguerite began another song, producing echoes that would wait in the walls for the next soul who lingered too long after closing. [737] The nostalgia rose through her like sap through silver bark, sweet and living, and she let it. [754]

She had always loved an encore. [760]
