The lagoon had not been still since the carousel halted, but it had grown quieter in a way that felt like breakage rather than peace. [23]

Maren crouched at the edge where vapor curled against her boots, watching the kinetic water churn in slow, directionless eddies above the cloudline. [47]

The great carousel--that spinning mechanism of turbines and tethered platforms that had once given the lagoon its purposeful rotation--stood frozen now, its arms reaching out like the ribs of something dead. [79]

Without it, the water still moved, but only in confused, recursive patterns, folding over itself with nowhere to go. [98]

She was a scavenger. [102]

She had always been a scavenger, or she would always be one, or she had not yet become one--the tenses tangled in her mind like wet rope. [128]

Chronology had become unreliable up here. [134]

The altitude did something to memory, or maybe it was the stories. [145]

She collected fragments of overheard stories--whispered exchanges between the drifters who passed through, half-sentences caught on the wind from camps she never entered--and each fragment lodged in her mind with its own sense of time, displacing her own. [187]

Someone had once said, "She used to take photographs of everything, even the rust." [201]

Maren had heard it from behind a supply cache, spoken by a voice she did not recognize about a woman she suspected was herself. [222]

That fragment lived in her skull dated to three years from now, or perhaps twelve years ago. [238]

Today--if it was today--she pulled a small object from the shallows. [249]

A disposable camera wheel, the toothed plastic disc that advanced the film one frame at a time. [265]

It was yellow, cracked, barnacled with mineral deposits from the lagoon's alkaline water. [278]

She turned it between her fingers and felt something fracture inside her chest. [291]

She had owned disposable cameras once. [297]

Dozens of them. [300]

She had wanted to be a documentarian, to catalog the world's strange upper places--the cloud settlements, the sky markets, the lagoons that physics forgot. [325]

Each click of that tiny wheel had been a promise: one frame closer to something meaningful. [340]

Now she scavenged machine parts for trade. [347]

The ambitions had not vanished all at once. [355]

They had eroded, worn smooth and then worn through by altitude and solitude and the practical mathematics of survival. [373]

One season she stopped carrying a camera. [380]

The next she stopped looking for things worth photographing. [389]

The season after that, she stopped remembering she had ever wanted to. [401]

Except she had not stopped. [406]

Not fully. [408]

The fragments would not let her. [414]

"I regret the photographs I never took more than the ones I lost," someone had said at a fire she passed three nights ago, or three nights from now. [442]

The words had entered her collection and immediately become hers, indistinguishable from her own grief. [457]

That was the danger of the method--other people's sorrows rooted so easily in the loosened soil of her chronology that she could no longer tell which regrets she had lived and which she had only overheard. [492]

This was why she kept collecting. [498]

Not for intelligence, not for trade value, but because somewhere in the accumulated whispers was the vocabulary she needed to negotiate with her own ghost. [523]

The ghost that crouched at the edges of her peripheral vision--younger, sharper-eyed, holding a camera up to the world with unweathered hands. [546]

It appeared most often in the fractured stillness after the carousel halted, when the lagoon's motion became purposeless and reflective, like Maren herself. [571]

She wanted to speak to it. [577]

To say: I did not mean to let you dissolve. [586]

To ask: what would you have done differently, and would it have mattered? [598]

To negotiate terms--could some version of that ambition survive inside this corroded life, and if so, what would it cost her to carry it? [623]

The ghost never answered directly. [628]

But sometimes, when Maren pressed the camera wheel's teeth against her thumb and closed her eyes, she heard a shutter click from somewhere inside her confused chronology--a sound that might have been memory or might have been promise. [665]

She could no longer parse the difference, and perhaps that was the negotiation already underway: the ghost offering back one frame of possibility for every fragment Maren fed it, a slow barter conducted in the currency of borrowed words and mechanical relics. [704]

She pocketed the wheel. [708]

She stood. [710]

The lagoon churned its purposeless circles above the clouds, and Maren moved along its edge, listening for the next sentence, the next scrap of someone else's story that might become the bridge between who she was and who she had failed to remain. [752]

The carousel would not turn again. [758]

But she was resolute. [762]

She would keep collecting until the ghost agreed to speak. [772]
