She hung suspended above the glowing viaduct, her body refusing the earth's oldest law, and watched rainwater trace luminous paths along the ancient stone arches below. [30]

Maren had always defied gravity. [35] Not through will or device, but through some fracture in her relationship with the world—a glitch written into her being that made her rise when everything else fell. [62] The rain had just ended, and the viaduct's bioluminescent moss blazed electric green in the wet darkness, casting the structure as a bridge between realms rather than a Roman relic. [90] She rotated slowly in the air, watching a single drop of water fall from the arch's keystone toward the canal below. [110]

Between the drop and the ripple. [116] That was the interval she needed—that impossible sliver of time when cause had committed but consequence had not yet answered. [135] In that fraction, the timelines were visible. [142]

She could see them now: dozens of translucent threads radiating from the falling droplet, each one a different version of what happened next. [164] In one, the ripple spread and faded normally. [172] In another, the canal froze solid. [178] In a third, there was no canal at all, only ash. [189] The fractured timelines splayed out like a shattered mirror, each shard reflecting a world that was and wasn't. [207]

Maren reached into her coat and withdrew the clay tablet—small enough to hold in one hand, heavy enough to feel like holding a planet. [230] Its runes were older than any language she'd studied, carved by someone who had understood what she was only beginning to grasp: that time was not a river but a labyrinth, and the labyrinth was not outside her but within. [270]

The runes described a method. [275] Through procedural generation—through rules that built upon themselves, iterating, branching, creating corridors from algorithms—the labyrinth of self could be mapped. [294] Each time she activated the tablet, it generated a new path through her fractured timelines, a new sequence of memories and possibilities to retrace. [317] No two journeys were identical because no two moments of her consciousness were identical. [330] The labyrinth rebuilt itself with every heartbeat. [337]

She pressed her thumb into the deepest rune. [345] Light crawled across the clay like veins filling with blood, and the viaduct below her blazed brighter even as the sky above grew darker—that impossible tone of darkening brightness, as if illumination itself were a form of shadow. [384]

The timelines snapped into focus. [389] She saw herself at seven, floating above her bed while her mother screamed. [401] She saw herself at nineteen, arrested for what authorities called a hoax and she called existing. [416] She saw a version of herself that had never floated at all, that had lived pressed to the ground like everyone else, ordinary and complete. [440] That version had died at forty-three, content. [448]

Maren was not content. [452] She was periodically eternal—alive across multiple timelines simultaneously, dying in some, persisting in others, her consciousness flickering between states of being and oblivion like a signal struggling through static. [479] The tablet called this state a gift. [486] She called it a sentence. [491]

To conquer the labyrinth of self, the runes instructed, one must retrace every path to its origin. [509] Not merely remember but inhabit, re-enter, feel the walls of each corridor close around you and then choose the turn you didn't take before. [535] The procedural generation would guide her, offering each junction algorithmically, ensuring she confronted every permutation of who she might have been. [557]

The drop touched the water. [562]

The ripple began. [565]

And in that transition, Maren let herself fall—truly fall—for the first time in her life. [580] She plunged toward the glowing viaduct, the tablet blazing in her fist, the timelines collapsing around her into a single corridor, the one she'd always avoided: the path where she accepted every fracture, every impossible rising and devastating fall, as one continuous self. [620]

She struck the surface of the canal and went under. [630] The green light enveloped her. [635] The runes dissolved from the tablet into her skin, and she felt the labyrinth fold inward, its walls becoming her ribs, its corridors becoming her veins. [662]

When she surfaced, she was not floating. [669] She was swimming—arms pulling against water, legs kicking, gravity holding her exactly as it held everyone else. [685] The viaduct glowed above her, dimmer now, the brightness finally darkening into something gentle and true. [700]

The tablet was blank clay in her hand. [708] The runes lived inside her now, procedural and iterating, still generating new paths—but paths she could walk on solid ground. [730]

Maren climbed onto the bank and stood, her weight fully her own, and watched the last ripple disappear into stillness. [750]
