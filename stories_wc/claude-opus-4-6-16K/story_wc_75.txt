The grotto city of Velara had no sunrise, only the perpetual silver veil of the waterfall that sealed it from the world outside. [25] Light filtered through that curtain of water in trembling columns, casting everything in a luminous, drowning glow. [41] Maret had lived behind this cascade for eleven years now, ever since the Cultural Reclamation Authority declared her people's arts degenerate and scattered them like seeds thrown onto stone. [66]

She was a cultured museum guide by training, historically oriented in ways that made her ache. [81] In the old city, she had walked visitors through galleries of lacquerwork and shadow puppetry, her voice steady with reverence, her hands gesturing toward centuries of accumulated beauty. [106] Now she guided no one. [110] The displaced persons of Velara had carried what they could into this limestone refuge--a few painted scrolls, a loom with half its heddles missing, one emerald-tinted opera glass lens that had once belonged to a theater house razed during the purges. [146]

Maret kept the lens in her apron pocket, pressing her thumb against its cool curve when dread settled over her like rosewater misted onto skin--fragrant, delicate, impossible to escape. [175] She would hold the lens to her eye and watch the waterfall turn green, imagining she sat in the velvet balcony of the Sovereign Opera, watching a soprano's mouth open into a note that could undo time. [207]

But time would not undo. [212] It only accumulated, like the mineral deposits that thickened along Velara's walls, slowly narrowing the chambers in which the displaced had built their quiet, vanishing lives. [237]

The beekeeper had been their last connection to the surface. [247] A weathered man named Doss who tended hives on the plateau above the falls, he smuggled flour and salt and news through a fissure in the rock. [273] His last visit had been thirty-one days ago. [281] He had come with a sack of rye flour and a warning: the Authority had begun surveying the plateau. [298] Then he had not come again. [304]

After the beekeeper's last visit, the flour ran low, and with it, the bread. [318] This mattered beyond hunger. [322] Among Maret's people, the Kashari, there was a family custom of baking bread shaped like initials--the initials of the dead, kneaded and formed each remembrance day so that grief could be held in the hand, broken, shared, swallowed, and transformed into the body's continuing life. [363] Without flour, the custom had stalled. [369] Without the custom, the dead became abstract, and the living began to forget why they had carried a loom and a lens and a half-burned scroll into a cave behind a waterfall in the first place. [402]

Maret understood this with the precision of a historian. [411] She knew that displaced persons did not perish from a single catastrophe but from the slow thaw of identity--each tradition that softened and gave way exposing the next to erosion, until nothing solid remained. [444] To rescue dying arts, she had to begin with the simplest art of all: bread. [458]

She organized a foraging party into the deeper grottos, where blind fish swam in mineral pools and pale fungi clung to the ceilings. [479] They found a starchy tuber growing in the silted banks of an underground river. [492] Maret dried it, ground it between stones, mixed it with water from the falls. [505] The dough was gray and dense, nothing like rye, but it held its shape when she pressed it into letters. [523]

On the thirty-second evening, the displaced gathered in the central grotto, where stalactites hung like the pipes of a cathedral organ. [542] Maret formed the initial of her mother's name, the cursive K splitting into its familiar branches under her thumbs. [559] Others shaped their own letters--an L, a D, a broad-shouldered M. [570] Children who had never seen the old bakeries watched and learned. [580]

Maret held the emerald lens to the firelight and projected a trembling green glow onto the cave wall behind them, a ghost of the theater, a whisper of pageantry. [607] The bread baked on flat stones over coals. [614] It smelled of earth and mineral water, not of the rye and honey they remembered, but the shapes were right, and the shapes were what carried meaning across the gap between the world they had lost and the world they were building in stone and spray. [657]

She broke her mother's letter in half and offered a piece to the child nearest her. [672] The girl chewed slowly, her face serious. [679]

"What does K taste like?" the girl asked. [687]

"Like remembering," Maret said, and the rosewater dread in her chest thinned just enough to let something else through--not hope exactly, but its fossil, preserved in the rock of her, waiting for the patient work of years to free it. [727]

Above them, the waterfall roared its one unending syllable, and inside that sound, the displaced persons of Velara began to thaw. [748]
