The lantern maker had always known that grief was a kind of light — blinding, relentless, impossible to hold in bare hands. [22]

Maren worked in the floating island tea garden, where jasmine bushes grew between cloud-veined flagstones and the air tasted of bergamot and altitude. [43] Her workshop occupied a pavilion at the garden's northern edge, overlooking the glass basilica on a floating isle that drifted parallel to her own, close enough to see its prismatic spires fracture the dawn into bleeding color, too far to touch. [82] The basilica had been her daughter's favorite thing in all the skylands. [93] Lira used to press her face against the railing and whisper that the building looked like a frozen prayer. [112]

Now Lira was gone, and Maren made lanterns. [120]

Not ordinary lanterns. [123] Maren was crafty in ways the tea garden's patrons didn't fully understand — each lantern she constructed captured dreams. [141] Dream recording was an old art, nearly lost, requiring a maker who could grind memory into luminescence. [157] Her method was gem polishing: she took raw crystals harvested from the garden's roots, where minerals calcified around the island's levitation core, and she cut and polished them into lenses that fit inside copper-framed housings. [192] When a sleeper placed one of Maren's lanterns beside their pillow, the polished gem caught the dream's frequency the way a tuning fork catches sound, preserving it in light that could be replayed by striking the crystal with a fingernail. [230]

She had nineteen lanterns filled with Lira's dreams. [239] She played them every night after the shadow detaches — that liminal hour when the island's own silhouette separates from its underside and falls into the abyss below, leaving everything above temporarily shadowless, raw, exposed. [272] In that naked interval, Maren would tap each crystal and watch her daughter's sleeping visions bloom across the pavilion ceiling: fields of paper animals, a laughing dog made of wind, the glass basilica shattering into butterflies and reassembling. [308]

The twentieth lantern was different. [313] It held Lira's final dream, recorded the night before the fever took her, and Maren had never played it. [332] She was afraid it would be dark. [339] She was afraid it would be bright. [346] She was afraid that once she heard its frequency, the grief she had been folding so carefully would unfold and devour her. [367]

Because that was how Maren survived: she folded grief into origami cranes. [379] Literal ones, made from pages of Lira's sketchbooks, and metaphorical ones — each sharp emotion creased and tucked until it became something with wings, something that might, if she was precise enough, fly. [412] Hundreds of paper cranes hung from the pavilion's beams, turning slowly in the thermal drafts, and each one contained a specific sorrow she had decided to transform into motion rather than collapse. [445]

Tonight, the shadow detached. [449] Maren watched it peel away and spiral downward into the dark between islands. [461] She picked up the twentieth lantern, turned the polished gem until it caught the shadowless light, and struck it. [480]

What played was impossible. [484] The dream descended while ascending — it showed Lira falling from the island, dropping through cloud and void, yet simultaneously rising, her body orienting upward even as the world pulled her down, as though gravity and grace had reached an agreement. [519] In the dream, Lira landed on the glass basilica's highest spire and the entire structure rang like a bell. [538] The sound transformed everything. [542] The basilica's glass walls rippled, softened, became translucent paper, and the building folded itself — corner over corner, crease over crease — into an enormous crane that lifted from its isle and soared. [573]

Maren's hands were shaking. [577] Her daughter had dreamed the very thing Maren had been doing with her grief, had dreamed it first, had dreamed it better. [597] The crane in the vision turned its paper head and looked directly at her, as if Lira had known, even in sleep, even in her last sleep, that her mother would eventually watch. [630]

Maren wept in the shadowless garden, luminous torment pouring through her like light through a polished gem, and she understood at last that the lanterns had never been about preserving Lira's dreams. [663] They had been about giving Maren permission to unfold. [672]

She took the twentieth lantern and hung it among the cranes. [683] Then she pulled a fresh sheet of sketch paper from Lira's book, and instead of folding, she left it flat. [703] She placed it on the worktable, picked up a charcoal stick, and for the first time since the fever, she drew: the glass basilica becoming a crane, ascending and descending simultaneously, grief and grace folded into a single wing. [744]

Above her, the cranes turned. [749] Across the gap, the basilica caught the returning shadow and held it gently, like a lantern holds its light. [768]
