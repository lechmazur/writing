The fluorescent tubes above the abandoned circus ticket office had been buzzing for years without anyone to sell tickets to, drawing power from a line that nobody had thought to disconnect. Marco Reyes set down his toolbox and listened to them hum. He wasn't here for the lights. He was here because the old freight elevator behind the ticket counter had seized sometime in the 1990s, and the county wanted it functional before demolition crews could safely strip the upper floors. Elevator repair was his job. Everything else he noticed was his curse.

The ghost standing behind the ticket window was a woman in a sequined leotard, her neck bent at an angle that made Marco look away. He'd been seeing them since he was eleven. They never spoke. They only watched, and he had learned that watching back accomplished nothing. So he focused on what he was good at: observing the physical world with a precision that bordered on obsession.

He crossed the warped floorboards toward the elevator shaft and swept his flashlight along the ceiling. That was always where he looked first. Ceilings were the honest parts of buildings. Floors got swept, walls got painted, but ceilings collected every secret a structure wanted to forget. His motivation had started as professional habit and deepened into philosophy: to discover what ceilings hide was to understand what people chose not to see.

The plaster above the ticket counter was crosshatched with fine fractures, cracks in the facade that told a story of settling and water damage and decades of thermal stress. He pulled a stepladder from his kit and climbed, analyzing dust accumulation patterns along the fissures. Where dust gathered thick and even, the cracks were old and stable. Where it was thin or disturbed, something had shifted recently.

One line of disruption ran directly toward the elevator shaft.

He followed it, prying loose a ceiling tile that crumbled in his hands. Behind it, resting on a joist as though someone had hidden it deliberately, was a brass cylinder about the size of a coffee can. Marco recognized it because his grandfather had been a clockmaker: a horologist's mainspring barrel, heavy and ornate, engraved with tiny circus elephants marching trunk-to-tail around its circumference. He turned it in his hands. Something rattled inside that wasn't a mainspring.

The fluorescent buzz died off.

In the sudden silence, the quality of the room changed. The ghost at the ticket window turned her head, and for the first time in twenty-three years of seeing the dead, a ghost looked directly at Marco. Not through him. At him.

He set the barrel on the counter between them and decided to engage. "This is yours," he said.

She didn't speak, but her hand drifted toward it, and the air around the barrel went cold enough to fog his breath. He unscrewed the cap. Inside, coiled around the mainspring, was a thin gold chain holding a locket and a folded piece of paper so old it felt like cloth. The locket held a photograph of two children in matching acrobat costumes. The note, in faded ink, read: "For Marguerite, when she comes looking."

The ghost's image flickered like a bulb about to die. Marco understood. She had been waiting not because she was trapped but because something unfinished held her here, a weightless burden she could neither carry nor set down. Someone had hidden this for her, and she had been watching the ceiling for decades, unable to reach it.

He placed the locket on the counter. The ghost pressed both translucent hands against it. The sequins on her leotard caught light that wasn't there, and then she was gone, not dramatically, not with a flash, but the way dust settles when the air finally stops moving.

Marco stood alone in the dark ticket office. The fluorescents flickered back on, buzzing as though nothing had happened. He pocketed the locket and the note. Somewhere there might be a Marguerite, or a descendant of one, and he would look.

He turned back to the elevator shaft, recalibrated his flashlight, and got to work. The cracks in the ceiling had told him everything. They always did, if you were skillfully observant enough to read them. Above him, the plaster held its silence, its secrets lighter now by one.
