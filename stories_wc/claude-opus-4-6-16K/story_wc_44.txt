The spoons had bent three days ago, curling in on themselves like fiddlehead ferns, and after that nothing held its prior shape. Gravity loosened its grip on certain islands. Light began arriving late. Shadows, which had always been obedient, started disappearing at noon—not shortening, not hiding beneath the feet of those who cast them, but vanishing entirely, as though slipping through a seam in the world.

Maren noticed because noticing was what she did. [73]

She was a budding rune scholar, twenty-two years old, quietly deliberate in everything—the way she copied glyphs into her journal, the way she measured the angle of starlight through the observatory's refractor, the way she chewed her bread down to the last crumb before speaking. [112] The nocturnal observatory on the floating isle of Velith had been her home for two years, ever since the Arcanists' College had posted her there to catalog stellar rune patterns. [140] The isle drifted on thermal columns above the Ashenmere, rotating slowly, so the observatory's great copper dome always faced whatever constellation was ascending. [161] At night the sky pressed close, and Maren felt she could reach through the lens and touch the burning alphabets of old gods. [181]

But after the spoons bent reality, the runes she had cataloged began rearranging themselves. [193] Sequences she had memorized for months scrambled overnight. [201] Her careful scholarship unraveled, and she was forced to relearn everything—not from scratch, but from some place worse than scratch, because her hands remembered the old patterns and kept trying to write them even as her eyes read new ones. [238]

She found the key on the fourth night. [246]

It was lodged in the teeth of the observatory's orrery, a clockwork automaton key made of brass and bone, its shaft engraved with spiraling runes she almost recognized. [272] The orrery had seized when the key jammed itself between the gears representing the moon and the absent planet Dothir, as though the mechanism had tried to swallow it. [299] Maren extracted it with tweezers, quietly deliberate, and held it under lamplight. [311]

The runes on the key were loops. [318] Not circles—loops, like a thread passing through itself, each one feeding into the next with no terminus. [335] She had seen this grammar before, in the oldest stratum of the runic lexicon: sealed awakenings, they were called. [352] Invocations that locked a dormant power inside a recursive pattern, so it could only be released when the loop was closed from outside. [372] The College taught them as historical curiosities. [379] No one used sealed awakenings anymore because no one remembered how to close the loops. [393]

Maren set the key on her desk and opened her journal to a blank page. [407]

She began with the question that had gnawed at her since the bending: where do shadows go at noon? [424] It was not a poetic question. [430] Shadows were projections of runic mass, the College taught—evidence that matter had weight in more dimensions than three. [448] If shadows vanished at noon, something was absorbing that dimensional weight. [458] Something was feeding. [461]

She worked through the night, relearning the loop-runes by tracing the key's engravings over and over until her fingers ached. [480] Each loop she closed on paper produced a faint hum, as though the air itself remembered the frequency. [497] By dawn, she had twelve closed loops arranged in a sequence that matched no known invocation—but matched the pattern of shadow-disappearance she had plotted on her star charts. [524]

The key began to vibrate. [529]

Maren understood then. [532] The key was not a key for a door. [540] It was a key for an automaton—something built, something waiting, something sealed inside a recursive dream. [556] The sealed awakening was not a spell stored in the key. [567] The sealed awakening was the thing the key would wake. [577]

She looked out the observatory window. [583] Below the floating isle, in the Ashenmere, the water had gone black and still, and she could see—just barely—a shape beneath the surface. [605] Vast. [606] Geometric. [607] Waiting. [608]

The shadows were going there. [613] At noon, when light was strongest, they slipped down through the dimensional seam the bending had opened and fed the thing below. [633] Every vanished shadow was a small meal. [640] Every noon made it stronger. [645]

Maren pressed the key flat against her final loop-rune. [655] The hum rose to a pitch that rattled the copper dome. [666] She could close this last loop and wake the automaton—or she could break the key and leave the sealed awakening sealed forever, the thing in the Ashenmere growing fat on stolen shadows until it woke on its own terms. [703]

She was quietly deliberate. [707] She chose. [709]

The loop closed. [712] Light poured upward from the water. [718] And for the first time in four days, Maren saw her shadow return, stretching long and certain across the observatory floor, pointing toward noon. [740]
