<story>Father Elias worked the loop pedal with his bare foot, recording silence. [12] Not the absence of sound -- true silence, the kind that existed between dimensional layers, captured and layered back upon itself until the room hummed with negative space. [39] He was a priest who decorated with silence the way others decorated with icons and incense, building cathedrals of pause in the air around him. [60]

The dimensional anchor was a concrete structure buried beneath the salt flats of Utah -- or what corresponded to Utah in the stable layer. [82] Its purpose was simple: keep the planes from sliding. [91] Sixteen electromagnetic pylons, each tuned to a different harmonic frequency, held reality stitched to itself. [104] When the stitching frayed, things slipped through. [111] Things like what had slipped into Dr. Maren Voss. [120]

She sat across from him now, wrists unbound because restraints only accelerated it. [132] Her left hand rested on an artist's palette smeared with a single color -- a deep arterial red she had been painting with for three days straight, covering the walls of her quarters in symbols that almost meant something. [167] The palette had held twelve colors when she arrived at the anchor station six weeks ago. [181] One by one the others had dried, cracked, fallen away, until only red remained. [194] Elias understood this as a diagnostic: the possession was narrowing her, collapsing the spectrum of who she was into a single frequency. [214]

He had to work before the possession completed. [222]

"Maren," he said, his voice arriving like sound through water -- that muffled clarity he had cultivated over years of interdimensional ministry. [242] "Who is speaking when you say 'I'?" [250]

A rhetorical device, but not merely rhetorical. [257] He used such questions the way a surgeon uses a scalpel: to plumb the layers between Maren and the thing wearing her. [277] Every assumption she held about her own identity was a door. [288] Some doors the entity had already walked through. [296] His task was to illuminate the hidden assumptions -- the ones she did not know she carried -- and lock them before the entity found them too. [320]

Her eyes focused on him. [325] Mostly her eyes. [328] "I am speaking," she said. [333]

"Are you? Or is that an assumption you have never examined?" [344] He pressed the loop pedal again. [350] Another layer of silence folded into the room. [358] The air thickened with stillness -- not the solid stillness of peace, but an unraveled stillness, fibrous and trembling, like a rope coming undone strand by strand. [382] This was the sound of a dimension under stress. [390]

"Consider," he continued, leaning forward. [395] "You assume you are the one who chose to paint. [405] But did you choose the red, or did the red choose you? [416] You assume your hand moves the brush. [423] But what if the brush has been moving your hand for days, and the assumption of agency is the very corridor through which this thing walks?" [448]

Something flickered behind Maren's face. [454] A tension. [456] The entity recognized what he was doing -- removing the floor it stood on, one plank at a time. [472]

She smiled with too many muscles. [478] "Clever priest. You think questions are weapons." [485]

"I think questions are light," Elias said. [492] "And I think you have been living in assumptions you mistook for walls. [505] Walls keep things out. [509] Assumptions let things in." [513]

He triggered the pedal a third time. [520] Three loops of silence now, layered and recursive, creating a pocket of acoustic void that pressed against the boundaries of the anchor's field. [541] In this deepened quiet, every word landed with weight. [550] Every rhetorical turn became architectural. [555]

"What do you want?" Maren asked. [561] Her voice cracked -- two voices diverging for a moment before snapping back into one. [574]

"I want you to question the thing you have never questioned," Elias said. [586] "Not who you are. [590] You have questioned that. [594] Everyone questions that. [597] I want you to question why you believe you can be entered at all. [610] What assumption makes you a vessel?" [616]

The silence loops pulsed. [620] Maren's hand lifted from the red palette, trembling. [628] The symbols on the walls seemed to dim. [635]

She opened her mouth. [639] Closed it. [641] Opened it again. [644]

"I assumed," she whispered, "that I was empty." [652]

The third loop of silence broke, flooding the room with a sound like the world exhaling. [667] The red on the palette cracked and dried in an instant. [677] Maren's eyes cleared -- fully hers now, wet and bewildered and whole. [688]

Father Elias lifted his foot from the pedal. [696] The dimensional anchor hummed its steady, unglamorous hum. [704] He sat with her in the quiet that remained -- not silence now, but its aftermath, the simple and breathing absence of need. [726]
