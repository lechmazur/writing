The loom spinner had not spoken in eleven years, and the silence she carried was not empty but raveling, pulling apart thread by thread like the fabric she once wove for the village below the mountain. [35]

Her name was Sable, and she lived at the edge of a forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest, where pear trees had gone wild and their fruit fell unpicked into moss so thick it swallowed sound. [69] The bamboo grew tall as cathedral columns around the clearing, and when wind passed through, the stalks knocked together in a language she almost understood. [93] She had come here after her daughter Lien crossed the border into the northern provinces, carried away by a marriage, a revolution, and then a war that sealed every road between them. [122]

Sable had tried letters. [126] She had tried messengers, radio signals, bribes to border guards. [135] Nothing crossed the impossible distance that politics and geography had stacked between mother and daughter. [148] So she returned to the only craft she knew. [157] She would weave the message into cloth, believing--as her grandmother had taught her--that a pattern made with sufficient intention could speak across any divide. [179]

But the loom had broken years ago, and she had no means to repair it. [193] The silence in her grew denser, not quiet but textured, a raveling silence that frayed at her edges, pulling loose the threads of memory and purpose until some mornings she could not remember why she rose at all. [228]

Then, at a rummage sale in the nearest town--three hours' walk through the bamboo--she found a box of jigsaw puzzle pieces. [249] They were from different puzzles, mismatched, their edges cut in patterns she had never seen: interlocking curves and notches that reminded her of heddle eyes and reed slots. [274] She bought the box for almost nothing and carried it home through the green corridor of bamboo, her fingers already sorting shapes by touch. [295]

Through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box, she began to recommence her work. [311] She fitted the cardboard teeth together into long strips, then wove those strips through a frame she built from bamboo and wire. [333] The resulting fabric was stiff and strange, a patchwork of fragmented images--a painted eye here, a cloud there, a corner of some foreign cathedral--but it held together with a tensile strength that surprised her. [365] She wove for months, stoically sparkling in the way of someone who has chosen purpose over grief, whose eyes catch light not from joy but from the relentless clarity of refusal to stop. [396]

In the orchard, the wild pear trees wept sap each spring, and the sap hardened into amber beads along the bark. [418] Sable collected them, these tree sap amber beads, and pressed them into the weave at intervals, each one a word she could not say aloud. [443] She assigned meaning to their placement: a bead at the left margin meant I am alive; one at the center meant I love you; one at the right edge meant come home if you can, and if you cannot, know that I am here. [484]

The tapestry grew through the hush of time's unraveling, season folding into season. [496] Her hands ached. [499] The bamboo forest shifted around her, new shoots rising, old stalks falling. [510] She ate the wild pears and drank from a stream that tasted of iron and patience. [524]

She understood, in the quiet way of someone who has bargained with the impossible, that the tapestry might never reach Lien. [543] That was the latent sacrifice woven into every row: not the grand gesture of martyrdom but the slow, daily expenditure of life on a task whose success she would likely never witness. [573] She wove anyway. [576] The act itself was the message. [582] The amber beads caught afternoon light and held it, stoically sparkling against the patchwork of borrowed images and bamboo thread. [598]

One autumn morning, a young woman appeared at the orchard's edge, thin and travel-worn, carrying nothing but a scrap of jigsaw-woven cloth she had received from a trader who had received it from a smuggler who had received it from a monk. [639] The scrap held a single amber bead at its center. [649]

Lien crossed the clearing. [653]

Sable looked up from the loom. [659]

Neither spoke. [661] The raveling silence between them reversed itself, threads gathering inward, tightening, reweaving into something whole. [674] Sable placed her daughter's hand against the tapestry, and Lien felt the beads beneath her fingers, reading them the way her grandmother had once read patterns in cloth. [699]

I am alive. [702] I love you. [705] Come home. [707]

The bamboo knocked its hollow music around them, and for the first time in eleven years, the silence was not unraveling but complete. [729]
