The sheet music archive occupied the basement of a condemned church on the edge of Harlow's orchard, and Sister Maren Voss arrived there on the last quiet morning before the chainsaws would sing. [35]

She was known in certain circles as the gossip-column exorcist, a title she'd earned not from tabloids but from the spirits themselves, who whispered about her the way socialites whisper about a surgeon with shaking hands. [66] She got results, but never clean ones. [73] The hauntings she resolved always left residue: a cold spot that never warmed, a door that opened on its own every third Tuesday, a faint smell of lavender where lavender had never grown. [101] Imperfect miracles, she called them. [106] The best anyone could hope for in a world that had forgotten how to be whole. [120]

She descended the stone steps into the archive, where thousands of compositions lay stacked in oak shelves that reached the vaulted ceiling. [140] Dust motes drifted through slats of gray light like eighth notes suspended between measures. [153] The air tasted of foxed paper and old resin, and beneath it, something sharper: the mineral tang of a presence that had been waiting. [176]

"Elsbeth," Maren said aloud. [180]

No answer, but the temperature dropped two degrees, and a sheaf of Debussy slid an inch across its shelf. [199]

Maren set her bag on the reading table and withdrew an antique perfume bottle, its crystal clouded with age, its silver cap tarnished to the color of a bruise. [230] It had belonged to Elsbeth Carr, the archive's former curator, Maren's former friend, and the woman Maren had failed thirty years ago when she'd dismissed Elsbeth's claims of a haunting as loneliness dressed in superstition. [265] Elsbeth had died six months later, alone in this basement, her heart stopped by something the coroner couldn't name. [283] Now she was the haunting, and the archive was scheduled for demolition along with the orchard above it. [300]

Maren needed to reconnect with what remained of Elsbeth before the bulldozers buried her forever beneath rubble and root. [317]

She uncapped the perfume bottle and set it at the center of the table. [331] Then she unwound a coil of copper wire from her bag and began laying it in a spiral around the bottle, attaching its ends to a small hand-cranked magneto. [362] Through induced currents, she could agitate the electromagnetic field enough to give a spirit purchase on the physical world, a crude bridge between silence and speech. [389] She turned the crank slowly, and the wire hummed. [398]

The lights flickered. [401] Pages rustled across the room as though stirred by breath. [411]

"You always said grief was a song played in the wrong key," Maren murmured, advising herself now the way she advised others, through metaphors, because the literal truth was a blade she'd never learned to hold. [446] "I think I've been playing in the wrong key for thirty years, Elsbeth." [458]

A voice came then, not from the air but from the perfume bottle itself, vibrating through the crystal like a tuning fork struck against bone. [481]

"You came to deliver something." [486]

"An overdue apology." [489] Maren's throat tightened. [492] "I should have believed you. [497] I should have come down here with my wires and my foolish copper and helped you when it mattered. [514] Instead I let pride convince me you were imagining things, and whatever was here fed on your isolation until there was nothing left to feed on." [539]

The bottle glowed faintly, amber light pulsing in rhythm with the magneto's hum. [551] Elsbeth's voice softened. [554] "I stayed angry for a long time. [560] Then I stayed because I forgot how to leave." [569]

"I can help you leave now," Maren said. [577] "It won't be perfect. [581] It never is. [584] You might linger as a chord someone hears when they leaf through the Debussy. [596] A resonance without a source." [601]

"An imperfect miracle," Elsbeth said, and there was something like laughter in the crystal's vibration. [615]

"The only kind I know how to make." [622]

Maren increased the crank speed. [627] The copper sang. [630] The perfume bottle filled with light so bright it cast the shadows of ten thousand compositions across the ceiling like a constellation of unplayed music. [654] Then the light faded, and the archive was still, and through the basement window Maren heard the hush of the orchard above, the trees standing in their last patience, waiting for the sound that would bring them down. [693]

She capped the bottle. [697] It was warm in her hands, and it smelled faintly of lavender where lavender had never grown. [715]

She climbed the stairs into the gray morning, carrying the residue, carrying the apology finally spoken, carrying the imperfect grace of having arrived too late and still being enough. [743]
