The carnival left Meridian Colony on a Thursday, hauling its neon rigs and synthetic cotton candy machines onto the last freight shuttle before the port authority revoked its license. [28] By Friday morning, the spaceport passenger terminal stood emptier than it had been even before the carnival arrived, which was saying something, because the terminal had been abandoned for six years. [55]

Sable Orin walked through the main concourse with her boots echoing against tile that had once guided thousands of travelers toward gates promising other worlds. [76] She was twenty-two, a civil engineering intern assigned to the Meridian Infrastructure Reclamation Office, and she had volunteered for the terminal survey because nobody else wanted it. [100] They called it a dead structure. [105] She called it a puzzle. [110]

The carnival had left behind more than trash. [118] Its temporary power lines still snaked across the floor, jury-rigged into the terminal's dormant electrical grid, and someone had rerouted the old hydraulic drainage system to feed a dozen fountain displays that now stood dry and silent. [149] Sable knelt beside an exposed junction where rainwater runoff had been redirected through channels never designed for it, feeding carnival generators instead of flowing to the colony's treatment plant. [176] She traced the improvised piping with her fingers, genuinely impressed. [186] Whoever had done this was functionally creative in a way her professors would have envied -- solving real problems with wrong infrastructure, making systems perform beyond their intended purpose. [210]

She pulled out her tablet and began mapping the redirected flows, not to document violations, but because she saw something the carnival engineers probably hadn't intended. [236] The rerouted water channels, if formalized, could sustain a living terminal again. [247] Not for space travel -- those days were gone -- but for habitation, agriculture, community. [259] The equations forming in her mind were not standard civil engineering. [269] They were something stranger, something she'd been trying to articulate since she first stood in the ruins of a colony that had stopped believing in its own future. [295] She was trying to puzzle out new equations for hope, formulas that could prove to a municipal board that resurrection was cheaper than demolition. [318]

Deep in the terminal's old navigation lounge, where pilots once waited for orbital windows, she found it. [333] A brass arc segment sat on a dusty counter beside a carnival fortune-teller's abandoned scarves. [347] Sable picked it up and recognized the craftsmanship immediately: a piece of an explorer's sextant, old enough to have been used for celestial navigation on Earth's oceans before humanity ever looked seriously at the stars. [380] An inscription read "Intention is the first coordinate." [388]

She turned the sextant piece over in her hands, feeling its weight, its improbable presence in this place. [404] Someone had carried this across centuries and light-years, and then left it behind on a fortune-teller's table in an abandoned spaceport after a carnival. [428] Or perhaps they had placed it there deliberately. [435] Intention, after all, was a maze -- every choice opening three more corridors, every good purpose tangling with selfish ones, every plan to save something threaded through with the quiet desire to matter. [464]

Sable understood mazes. [467] Her entire internship had been a maze of intentions: the colony's intention to reclaim, the board's intention to minimize costs, her own intention to prove that structures carried memory worth preserving. [492] She set the sextant piece on her tablet and photographed it, then slid it into her jacket pocket. [508] It would sit on her desk while she drafted the proposal. [519]

Over the following weeks, she worked with a stoic intensity that her supervisors mistook for mere diligence. [534] She mapped every redirected flow the carnival had created, every accidental improvement, every load-bearing wall that still held true. [551] She calculated water reclamation rates, solar exposure through the terminal's vast skylights, soil depth requirements for the concourse gardens she envisioned. [569] She fed the numbers through structural models until they sang. [579]

The proposal to resurrect the terminal through redirected flows -- rainwater, greywater, even the old hydraulic lines repurposed for hydroponic cycling -- landed on the board's table on a Monday. [607] It was ninety pages of functionally creative engineering dressed in the sober language bureaucrats trusted. [621] Sable presented it without smiling, letting the math carry its own quiet amazement. [633]

They approved a feasibility study. [638] It was not a yes. [643] It was not a no. [648] It was an open corridor in the maze, and she walked through it the way she walked through the terminal: listening to echoes, trusting that something ahead was worth reaching. [678]

The sextant piece stayed on her desk, its inscription facing upward. [689] Intention is the first coordinate. [694] She had plotted hers. [698] Now she waited for the colony to find its own, somewhere in the maze where hope and mathematics converged like old water finding new channels, flowing toward a future that no carnival could carry away.
