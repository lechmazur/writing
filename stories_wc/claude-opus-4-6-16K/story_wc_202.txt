The alchemist's market hung between rooftop pylons on cables older than anyone's memory, its wooden platforms creaking with each gust that swept across the city's crown. [27] Maren walked the suspended planks as she had since childhood, though now she walked them differently -- not as a girl chasing the smell of powdered starlight, but as a translator, the only one the vendors trusted to read what lived between worlds. [60]

She carried the lighthouse lens fragment in her coat pocket, where it pressed against her hip like a second heartbeat. [77] Her grandmother had salvaged it the night the city demolished the harbor light, an event no official record mentioned, an erasure so complete that even the fishermen's children forgot within a season. [103] But Maren remembered. [106] Between childhood and now stretched a long corridor of such forgettings, and she had made it her work to walk back through them. [125]

Her gift had announced itself early, through hidden details in paintings. [135] At seven, she had stood before a mural in the market's tea stall and seen, nested inside the painted clouds, a script no one else could read -- words from a world adjacent to this one, pressed into pigment like fingerprints left by someone leaning through a curtain. [172] The tea seller, an alchemist named Oshi, had watched Maren trace the letters with her small finger and immediately understood what the girl was. [194] A between-worlds translator. [198] Someone whose eyes could catch the residue that other realities left on this one. [211]

Now Oshi was dead, and the mural was peeling, and Maren climbed the swaying rope ladder to the upper tier where Oshi's stall had been converted into a paint dealer's booth. [241] The new owner had hung canvases over the old walls, not knowing what lived beneath. [256] Maren knew. [258] She had been dreaming of the mural for weeks, feeling its pull -- one of those anchors of intuition that she had learned never to ignore. [279] They were elusively tangible, these anchors: not quite thoughts, not quite sensations, but something caught between, like the pressure change before a storm that you feel in your teeth before you feel it anywhere else. [311]

She asked the paint dealer for a moment alone with the east wall. [323] He shrugged, accustomed to the market's eccentrics, and stepped out onto the platform to smoke. [337]

Maren set the lighthouse lens fragment on the counter and began to unfasten the canvases from their hooks, lifting them down one by one until the mural breathed open beneath. [364] Time had faded the colors but not the hidden script, which pulsed faintly in the afternoon light refracted through the market's glass-bead canopy. [385] She pressed the lens fragment to her eye. [392]

The world folded. [395]

Through the curved glass, the script sharpened into sentences, and the sentences became a history: the account of a lamplighter's guild that had maintained passages between this world and the next for two hundred years, lighting thresholds the way Maren's grandmother had lit the harbor. [433] The guild had been dissolved, its records burned, its members scattered into trades that would make them invisible. [450] Oshi had been one of them. [456] The mural was her testimony, hidden in the only language the authorities could not read. [470]

Maren translated aloud, her voice barely above a whisper, and the words hung in the stall like suspended lanterns. [488] Each sentence honored a name the city had tried to erase: the lamplighters who had kept the passages safe, the translators before Maren who had carried lens fragments of their own, the grandmothers and grandfathers of threshold work whose sacrifices had made the spaces between worlds navigable. [527]

She wrote the translation on the back of the canvases she had unfastened, using the paint dealer's own ink, so that the overlooked history would live on both sides of the cloth. [558] When she finished, the mural's glow dimmed to ordinary pigment, its message finally received. [571]

The paint dealer returned, smelling of clove smoke. [579] He glanced at the writing on his canvases but said nothing. [590] In the market above the rooftops, strange things were simply commerce. [601]

Maren pocketed the lens fragment and stepped back onto the swaying planks. [613] The city sprawled below, enormous and forgetful. [620] Above it, the market creaked and shimmered, an eternal instant strung on cables, where the things the world discarded found their way to someone who would listen. [646] She had more murals to find, more scripts pressed into paint by hands that had trusted the future to send a translator. [667] The anchors of intuition were already pulling her toward the next wall, the next hidden testimony, the next name waiting to be spoken back into the air. [694]

She walked the high planks westward, the lens fragment warm against her hip, carrying its old light into the new work. [714]
