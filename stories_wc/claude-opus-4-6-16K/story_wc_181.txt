The asteroid had no name, only a catalog number that nobody remembered, and yet its orchard bloomed in colors that existed nowhere else in the known spectrum. [30] Maren stood among the trees, bewildered, her curator's instinct telling her to classify what she saw even as her eyes refused to cooperate. [52] The branches were translucent, threaded with light the way veins are threaded with blood, and the fruit they bore pulsed gently, each one a small astral lantern suspended in the permanent twilight of deep space. [83]

She had come here to pursue forbidden knowledge — the kind her grandmother's will had demanded she seek. [99] The inheritance was simply complicated: not money, not property, but a sequence of instructions encoded across forty years of journals, each entry referencing events that hadn't happened yet when they were written. [128] Nonlinear inheritance, the executor had called it, as though that explained anything. [139] The journals didn't proceed from first page to last in any sensible order. [151] Instead, the final entry directed Maren to the first, and the first directed her to page two hundred and seven, and page two hundred and seven directed her here — to an asteroid orchard that her grandmother had described in 1986, three decades before humanity discovered it existed. [193]

Maren turned the pistachio shell cameo blank over in her palm. [204] It was the only physical object included in the inheritance: a small oval of pistachio shell, sanded smooth, awaiting a portrait that had never been carved. [229] Her grandmother's note said the orchard would reveal whose face belonged on it. [242] Maren did not yet understand. [247]

She walked deeper among the shining trees, their roots gripping the asteroid's thin soil like fingers clutching a ledge. [266] The air was breathable — another impossibility — carrying a scent like honey and static electricity. [279] A small structure stood at the orchard's center: a stone building with a single room and, improbably, a bathroom. [296] Maren almost laughed. [299] Her grandmother's journals had been explicit about this, too. [308] "You will inquire of the mirror," the entry for March 3rd, 1991 read. [321] "The breakthroughs come in bathrooms, child. They always have. Something about the smallness of the room and the honesty of the mirror." [342]

So Maren entered the bathroom, which was simple — a basin, a mirror, a single light that seemed to emanate from the walls themselves. [364] She set the cameo blank on the basin's edge and looked at her reflection. [377]

"Whose face?" she asked aloud, feeling foolish. [384]

The mirror didn't answer, but something shifted. [391] The light changed quality, becoming the same impossible color as the orchard's blossoms. [403] Maren gripped the basin and felt the philosophical breakthrough arrive not as a thought but as a physical sensation — a rearrangement of understanding, vertebra by vertebra, climbing her spine. [431]

The inheritance was nonlinear because her grandmother had lived nonlinearly. [440] The journals weren't predictions. [444] They were memories written by a woman who had experienced time the way the orchard experienced seasons: all at once, blossoming and fruiting and going bare simultaneously. [466] Her grandmother had stood in this same bathroom, looked into this same mirror, and seen not her own face but Maren's — decades before Maren was born. [492]

The cameo blank was not waiting for a stranger's portrait. [502] It was waiting for Maren's own face, carved by her own hand, to be left here for the next inheritor — someone not yet born, someone whose name her grandmother's journals mentioned in entries Maren hadn't reached yet. [536]

She picked up the blank and studied its surface. [545] The pistachio shell was warm, as though it had been holding this patience for a very long time. [561] Maren felt a brightened disquiet settle over her, the particular unease of understanding something enormous while standing in a very small room. [581] She was not the end of the chain. [588] She was a link in a sequence that operated outside of chronology, and the forbidden knowledge she'd been sent to pursue was simply this: that love could be inherited backward, threaded from future to past, the way light threads through these astral branches. [624]

Maren left the bathroom and walked back into the orchard. [634] The trees pulsed their silent, sourceless light. [641] She sat beneath the largest one, opened her grandmother's journal to a random page, and found an entry dated twenty years from now, written in her own handwriting. [668]

"You will plant a new tree," it said. [676] "You will leave the cameo for the child. You will write these words. You already have." [692]

Maren closed the journal. [696] She looked at the blank, the orchard, the impossible sky. [706] Then she began to carve. [711]
