The ridgeway ran like a spine along the top of the world, and Sael ran along it with a satchel of old things pressed against her ribs. [28]

She was jittery by nature, jittery by trade. [36] A relic courier learned to flinch at every sound because every sound might be a collector's knife or a border warden's whistle. [55] But tonight the aurora draped the sky in curtains of green and violet, and the light made the path ahead shimmer as though the ridge itself were breathing. [83] She slowed despite herself. [87]

In her satchel, wrapped in oilcloth, lay the dragonfly-wing pendant. [97] It was no larger than her thumb, its surface veined with iridescent filaments that caught light the way a creek catches leaves -- effortlessly, endlessly. [118] Her client in the southern valleys wanted it for a private collection, another dead thing under glass. [133] But Sael had carried it for eleven days now, and eleven nights she had noticed something: the pendant hummed. [150]

Not always. [152] Only when she lingered. [156]

She was built for brief encounters -- accept the relic, carry the relic, deliver the relic, move on. [172] Yet the pendant seemed to extend those encounters, pulling minutes into hours, making her pause at crossroads she would normally sprint through. [192] Tonight, on the aurora-lit ridgeway, she stopped entirely. [200]

She unwrapped it and held it flat on her palm. [210] The filaments caught the aurora's shifting green, and the hum rose, thin as a tuning fork's whisper. [227] She recognized the frequency. [231] It was the same note Oram used to play on his bone flute when he was teaching her to listen. [249]

Oram. [250] Her absent mentor, seven years gone. [256] He had trained her in the courier paths -- the hidden trails, the breathing exercises to steady shaking hands, the art of wrapping fragile things so they survived rough country. [280] Then one morning his camp was empty, his flute left hanging from a branch like an afterthought. [295] No note, no body, no grave. [301] Just absence where instruction used to be. [308]

She had spent years angry about it. [315] Then years trying to forget. [320] Now she existed in the strange territory across the fade from memory to myth, where Oram was less a man and more a principle: the idea that the world held secrets worth slowing down for. [352]

The pendant hummed louder. [356] She realized her hand was trembling -- her perpetual courier's tremor -- and the pendant was responding, vibrating sympathetically with the frequency of her own shaking body. [378] The filaments brightened. [381] Something at the pendant's core, a dark seed she had assumed was decorative resin, began to split. [396]

She watched, breathless, as a threadlike root emerged, pale and luminous as the aurora overhead. [411] The seed was alive. [415] It was beginning to germinate, coaxed into waking by the resonance between her trembling and the pendant's ancient design. [432]

Oram would have known what this was. [439] He would have crouched beside her, pointed with his crooked finger, and said something infuriating like, "See, the world rewards the ones who stop." [460] She could almost hear him. [465] Maybe that was the pendant too, vibrating old words out of her bones. [477]

The root lengthened, curled around her index finger like a question mark. [489] She should wrap it back up. [495] She should deliver it. [499] That was the job: carry, don't contemplate. [506]

But Oram had left her the flute, and she had never played it. [519] He had left her the trails, and she had used them only to run. [533] Every lesson he offered had been an invitation to coax wonder from the routine, and every time she had pocketed the wonder and sold it to someone else's collection. [561]

The root reached toward the rocky soil of the ridgeway. [571] She knelt and pressed her palm to the ground, letting the pendant touch earth. [585] The humming deepened into something she felt in her sternum. [595] The aurora pulsed as if in answer. [602]

She would not deliver this one. [608]

Let the client rage. [612] Let the fee evaporate. [616] Some relics were not meant to be carried from hand to hand in brief, jittery transactions. [630] Some were meant to be planted. [636]

She pressed the pendant into the thin mountain soil and held it there, her trembling hands feeding the resonance, the seed drinking the vibration and the light. [661] A second root emerged, then a third. [668] By dawn the pendant would be something else entirely -- not a relic, not a commodity, but a living thing rooted in the ridge where the auroras sang. [694]

Sael sat back on her heels and watched it grow. [704] For the first time in years, her hands were still. [714]

Somewhere beyond memory, beyond myth, she thought she heard a bone flute playing one long, approving note. [731]
