She had thirty-seven minutes of golden light left, and she intended to steal every one of them.

Maren crouched behind the wrought-iron bench at Emerald Station, her camera bag pressed against her ribs, watching the last commuters drift through the terminal's glass-and-copper archways. [44] The station earned its name honestly: veins of green marble ran through every pillar, every floor tile, catching the sunset and throwing it back in fractured emerald fire. [70] In thirty-seven minutes, the sun would vanish, and the moonlight would take over, and everything she'd come here to do would either succeed or collapse. [93]

They called her the golden-hour portrait thief. [100] Not because she stole portraits from galleries—though she had, once, in a moment of youthful recklessness—but because she stole moments. [119] She photographed strangers in that fleeting window when the sun hung low and turned ordinary faces into something sacred, then sold the prints to collectors who craved evidence that transcendence existed in train stations and parking lots and hospital waiting rooms. [155] Illuminated moments, her dealer called them. [161] Proof that light could love a human face. [168]

But tonight she wasn't here for photographs. [175]

Tonight she was here for the jar. [182]

It sat in the flower shop at the far end of the platform—Ludo's Arrangements, a narrow stall crammed between a newsstand and a shuttered ticket booth. [207] Old Ludo had been sending her messages for weeks, encoded in his bouquets. [220] A sprig of rosemary tucked behind three white lilies meant come Tuesday. [232] A single dahlia facing east in a bed of fern meant platform nine. [245] Maren had learned his flower codes years ago, back when she was quietly savvy enough to realize that the old florist was more than he appeared, that his green-stained fingers arranged more than petals. [278]

Ludo kept things for people who needed them kept. [287] And the thing Maren needed was a jar of captured moonbeams. [298]

She'd first heard of it from her grandmother, who described it as a mason jar filled with pale, swimming light, collected drop by drop from full moons over forty years. [329] Her grandmother said it could show you the shape of your life if you held it to your ear—not your eye, your ear—because destiny doesn't reveal itself visually. [357] It hums. [359] Maren had spent her whole career chasing illuminated moments with a lens, trying to see meaning in light, and now she understood she'd been using the wrong sense entirely. [388] She needed to press her ear against destiny's door and listen. [399]

The sunset blazed its final amber. [405] Maren crossed the platform, her shadow stretching impossibly long across the emerald tiles. [416] Ludo was closing up, folding tissue paper around unsold carnations. [425] He looked at her with eyes that held no surprise. [434]

"The arrangement you ordered," he said, sliding a small wooden box across the counter. [447] Inside, nestled among dried lavender, sat the jar. [455] It was smaller than she'd imagined, no bigger than her fist, and the light inside it moved like something alive—pale, silver, restless. [476]

"You'll want to reinterpret everything you thought you knew," Ludo said quietly. [487] "About your photographs. About what you've been chasing." [494]

She lifted the jar. [498] The last sliver of gold vanished behind the station's roof, and moonlight flooded the platform as if a curtain had been pulled. [519] Emerald Station transformed—the green marble turned luminous, almost phosphorescent, and Maren stood at the intersection of two kinds of light: the memory of the sun and the presence of the moon. [550]

She raised the jar to her ear. [557]

The hum was unlike anything she could have prepared for. [567] It was not a single note but a chord, layered and shifting, and inside it she heard every golden-hour face she'd ever photographed—the tired nurse, the laughing child, the old man weeping on a bench—not as images but as vibrations, each one a frequency in a vast, luminous composition. [610]

She understood, with a disbelief so bright it felt like standing inside the sun, that she had never been stealing moments. [631] She had been transcribing them. [636] Every portrait was a note in a score she hadn't known she was writing, and the moonbeams in the jar were singing it back to her now, complete. [664]

Maren lowered the jar. [668] The moonlight on Emerald Station was steady, generous, unspeakably beautiful. [677] She set down her camera bag, sat on the cold marble floor, and for the first time in her life, closed her eyes to truly see. [702]

Ludo watched her from the stall, arranging a single white rose among forget-me-nots—his code for she finally arrived. [720]
