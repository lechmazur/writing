The mist rolled through the rail depot like breath across cold glass, settling on every iron beam and rusted coupling until the world seemed made of whisper and water. [30]

Elara stood at the center of her repair shop, a converted maintenance bay wedged between two dormant platforms, and listened. [50] She had not seen light in eleven years, not since the chemical fire that took her sight and left her with hands that understood machines better than her eyes ever had. [80] Her fingers moved across the workbench with the certainty of a woman who had memorized every tool by weight, every component by texture, every fracture by sound. [103]

This morning, she was patching the wing membrane of an artificial hummingbird drone, a delicate courier unit no larger than her fist. [124] Its owner, a young rail dispatcher named Soren, stood near the bay doors watching the harbor beyond the depot where the maiden vessel Aurelia sat in its berth, chain taut, anchor not yet lifted. [157] He shifted his weight, anxious. [162]

"It needs to fly before the ship leaves," Soren said. [172] "The Aurelia's navigation system requires a confirmation signal from the drone swarm, and this one carries the lead frequency." [191] He paused. [193] "Without it, the captain has no directional reference." [201]

Elara nodded slowly, her calm settling over the space like the mist itself. [214] She was a heartfelt artisan, the kind who grieved over every stripped gear and celebrated every restored circuit, and she oversaw this shop not despite her blindness but through it. [244] Her other senses had become instruments of extraordinary precision. [253]

She lifted the drone closer to her ear and thumbed the rotor. [265] A faint asymmetry in the vibration told her the left wing joint had micro-fractures along the carbon lattice. [283] She reached for her patching resin, a compound she mixed herself, and began applying it in thin, deliberate strokes along the fracture lines her fingertips had mapped. [311]

"How do you know it's right?" Soren asked, not unkindly. [321]

"The water," Elara said. [325]

She gestured toward the long trough that ran beneath her workbench, fed by condensation drains from the depot's arched roof. [345] Mist gathered there constantly, creating a shallow, living mirror. [354] When she held a repaired component above the water and activated its micro-LEDs, Soren had seen her tilt the piece at precise angles, examining light refraction through the water feature's surface to detect warps invisible to the naked eye. [391] She could not see the light, but she could feel the heat signatures shifting against her skin as the refracted beams bent differently through flawed and flawless material. [419]

She held the patched wing over the trough now. [429] The LEDs pulsed. [432] She rotated the membrane slowly, her free hand hovering above the water, reading the thermal language of scattered light. [450]

"Clean," she said. [453]

Outside, a horn sounded. [457] Through the bay doors, Soren watched dockworkers preparing the Aurelia's anchor chain. [468] The winch had begun to groan. [474]

Elara reassembled the drone with movements that were both swift and reverent. [485] She connected the wing to the thorax housing, sealed the neural relay, and pressed the activation node. [500] The drone shivered to life in her palm, its wings blurring into a hum that was perfectly symmetrical now, a tone she recognized the way a musician recognizes a tuned string. [530]

"The swarm will follow this one's frequency," she said, handing it to Soren. [543] "It will decode the feedback from the other drones into direction for the ship's navigation array." [558] She turned her blind eyes toward the harbor as though she could see the great vessel waiting. [573] "Go." [574]

Soren took the drone carefully, cupping it like something sacred. [584] He paused at the door. [589] "Elara, what happens if the signal drifts?" [596]

"Then bring it back," she said, and there was warmth in the words, the steady magnetic calm of someone who had long since made peace with imperfection and devoted her life to mending it. [630] "I will always be here to patch what needs patching." [640]

He ran. [642] The anchor chain clanked upward, link by heavy link, as the Aurelia prepared to taste open water for the first time. [663] Soren released the drone at the platform's edge, and it shot forward through the mist, iridescent and alive, carrying its frequency like a heartbeat toward the waiting swarm. [693]

Elara listened until the hum dissolved into distance. [701] Then she turned back to her bench, where the next broken thing was already waiting, and she placed her hands upon it gently, the way one greets an old friend. [732]

The mist kept falling. [736] The depot breathed. [739] And somewhere beyond the harbor mouth, a ship found its direction. [750]
