Maren knelt in the dust of the abandoned carnival prize redemption center, the chain on her left ankle singing against the concrete floor. [22] The place still held its old signage -- "100 TICKETS FOR A GIANT BEAR" -- faded to ghosts above empty shelves. [40] She had not come for prizes. [46] She had come for what someone had buried here seventeen years ago, when the drought first turned the soil to powder and the Authority seized every viable seed in the territory. [75]

She was patiently strategic. [80] She had waited three years in a detention facility, memorizing maps scratched into cell walls by women who had been moved or killed. [100] She had waited another two years after escape, moving through safe houses, following whispers of a clandestine seed vault hidden where no one would think to look. [126]

The chain -- they had welded it to her ankle the day she was convicted of unauthorized cultivation. [142] She could have had it cut. [149] She chose not to. [153] It reminded her that freedom was not a state but a practice, something you dragged behind you, clanking, until the sound became music. [176]

Now she crouched beside the old upright piano shoved against the back wall. [189] Its keys were long gone, stripped for ivory trading in the early collapse years. [202] But when she lifted the bench lid, she found something unexpected: twenty-three piano keys arranged not in order but in a deliberate pattern. [224] White, black, white, white, black. [230] Gaps where keys were missing. [235] Someone had left a message. [240]

She ran her fingers along them, counting intervals. [248] By decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench, she could map them to the old musical notation system her contact, a former piano teacher named Odes, had described before he died. [280] Each key corresponded to a note, each note to a number, each number to a coordinate on a grid overlaid on the redemption center's floor plan. [304] The vault was beneath the tile at coordinate seven-twelve. [314]

She pried up the tile with a crowbar. [322] Beneath it: a steel hatch. [327]

That was when she heard boots outside. [334]

Authority scouts. [336] Two of them, sweeping the carnival grounds. [343] They had intercepted the same intelligence, or perhaps they had followed the arrow. [356]

The arrow. [358] She had found it three days ago embedded in a fence post at the edge of the grounds -- an arrow with strange fletching, its vanes made not of feathers but of pressed seed husks, laminated and shaped into fins. [394] It was a signature. [398] The old resistance had used them as trail markers, biodegradable and invisible to anyone who did not know what to look for. [418] But the Authority had been learning. [424]

She needed to impede them. [429] Not with violence -- she carried no weapon, and killing scouts would bring battalions. [441] Instead she moved with terrifying calm. [447] She repositioned the piano bench, scattered the keys into apparent randomness, replaced the tile. [460] Then she took the arrow from her pack and wedged it into the doorframe of the back exit, pointing outward toward the northern fence line, away from the hatch. [490] A false trail for anyone who recognized the fletching. [499]

She waited in the shadows behind a collapsed shelf of stuffed animals, their synthetic fur matted with years of rain and neglect. [520] The scouts entered, swept their lights across the room, found the arrow, and followed its direction out the back door into the dark. [543]

When their footsteps faded, Maren opened the hatch. [551]

Inside: rows of glass jars, vacuum-sealed, labeled in Odes's careful handwriting. [562] Wheat. [563] Sorghum. [564] Millet. [565] Amaranth. [566] Varieties bred for drought resistance, for poor soil, for the exact conditions the Authority had deemed unrecoverable. [580] Seeds to plant resilience in dry soil -- not just crops, but the radical idea that people could feed themselves without permission. [599]

She loaded the jars into her pack, her chain pooling and clinking softly, a percussive accompaniment to the most important theft of her life. [622]

Outside, the sky flashed. [627] Not lightning. [629] Explosions along the perimeter. [633] The rebel offensive had begun. [638] The wall was coming down -- the massive concrete barrier the Authority had built around the last irrigated zone, hoarding water and power behind it for a decade. [663] When the wall came down there would be chaos, movement, a thousand displaced people flooding into the dry lands with nothing to sustain them. [685]

Unless someone was already there, waiting in the cracked earth with seeds and knowledge and the stubborn, staggering grace to believe that barren ground could remember how to give. [713]

Maren shouldered her pack. [717] The chain dragged behind her across the carnival's cracked asphalt like a hymn written in iron, and she carried enough buried futures in her arms to make the desert dream of green. [748]
