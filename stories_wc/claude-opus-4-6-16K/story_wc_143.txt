The crater inspector climbed the last switchback before the moonlit summit, her boots crunching against regolith that had no business being on Earth. [25] But here it was—Loss Ridge, where the Tunguska-class impactor of 2041 had carved a bowl into the Andes, scattering extraterrestrial minerals across a peak that now glowed pale and alien under a gibbous moon. [56]

Maren Solberg had been cataloging craters for the International Impact Authority for eleven years, ever since the space age turned violent—not with war, but with a plague of near-Earth objects that peppered the planet like buckshot. [89] She was purposefully curious, the kind of scientist who didn't just measure diameters and ejecta patterns but knelt in the dust and asked what the rock remembered. [112] Tonight, though, she wasn't here to measure. [119] She was here to photograph the last of something precious. [128]

At the summit's edge, the bioluminescent lichen clung to the crater rim in trembling patches of blue-green light. [145] It had appeared three years after the impact, feeding on the exotic chemistry the bolide had seeded into the stone—iron sulfides, nickel carbonates, compounds no terrestrial organism had ever tasted. [173] The lichen had no name yet, only a specimen number: XB-7. [184] And it was dying. [187] Atmospheric oxidation was slowly neutralizing the minerals it depended on. [196] Within a season, the last colony would bleach to nothing, and an entire branch of life that had bootstrapped itself into existence from an accident of cosmic debris would vanish. [223]

Maren set her tripod at the crater's lip and uncapped her lens. [234] The lichen pulsed faintly, as if breathing. [241] She waited for the dawning hush—that liminal stillness between the last exhalation of night wind and the first thermal stirring of morning—when the air would be so calm that a long exposure could capture every filament without blur. [275]

While she waited, she opened her field case and removed a sealed vial. [287] Inside it, a single grain of sand rattled against glass. [297] It had belonged to the nightwatch's hourglass aboard the decommissioned orbital station Vostok-9, where her father had served as watch commander before the station was scuttled in 2048. [321] He had pried the grain loose the night he logged his final shift, the last manned watch before automation made human sentinels obsolete. [341] When he gave it to Maren, he said, "This grain counted every hour I stayed awake so others could sleep." [358] She carried it on every field assignment, a talisman of vigilance—a reminder that some things endure only because someone refuses to look away. [378]

She placed the vial on the tripod's base plate, where it caught the moonlight, and whispered the same thing she always whispered: "I'm still watching." [401]

To outlast the wind, she had learned patience. [409] To outlast the dark, she carried a headlamp she never turned on, preferring to let her eyes adapt. [427] To outlast the oxidation devouring XB-7, she had devised a method no other researcher had attempted: using chemical reactions for timed messages embedded in the rock itself. [453] She mixed a slow-reacting compound—calcium carbonate suspended in a silicone gel—and painted it into hairline fractures around the lichen colonies. [472] Over months, the compound would neutralize incoming oxygen at a metered rate, buying the lichen perhaps another year. [489] It was a letter written in chemistry, a message to the future that said: not yet. [503]

She did not know if it would work. [510] She did not know if a year was enough for the taxonomists to arrive, to sequence, to propagate. [527] She only knew that standing here, at the edge of a wound the sky had made, she could still choose to intervene. [546]

The wind died. [549] The dawning hush settled over the summit like a held breath. [560] Maren pressed the shutter release. [565] The camera drank light for ninety seconds, and in that silence she heard nothing—not the hum of satellites overhead, not the distant growl of supply drones, not even her own heartbeat. [594] Only the faintest crackle of the lichen's bioluminescence reacting with the cold, a sound she might have imagined. [612]

The shutter closed. [615] She checked the preview screen. [620] The lichen blazed across the image like a nebula seen from within, every thread of life vivid against the charcoal stone. [639] The grain of sand in its vial gleamed at the frame's edge, an accidental inclusion she decided to keep. [657]

Dawn touched the eastern ridge. [662] The blue-green glow faded as sunlight overpowered it, and the lichen became invisible again—gray on gray, humble, nearly gone. [680] Maren packed her equipment slowly. [685] She capped the vial, stowed the chemical kit, folded the tripod. [695]

She descended the switchback as the first warm light spilled across the crater, carrying with her the proof that something extraordinary had once burned quietly on a mountaintop, asking nothing of the universe except another hour. [730]
