The queen had not believed in her crown for seven years, but she still believed in the dreams. [18]

They came each night like a hemorrhage of light behind her eyelids — stars splitting open, their luminous blood dripping across a sky she had never seen while waking. [47] Bleeding starlight, her dead mother had called it once, in a letter written before the madness took her, before the throne passed to a daughter who never wanted it. [75] The letter said the starlight bled only when something beneath the world was trying to speak. [90]

Now the final warning had come and gone. [98] The court astrologers had begged her not to leave the palace, their voices thin with a terror they could not fully articulate. [118] The stars themselves had issued the warning — three nights of crimson auroras, the ancient signal that meant the boundary between dreaming and waking had worn too thin. [143] After that, silence. [146] No more auroras, no more pleas. [152] Just the dreams, more vivid than ever, pulling her toward the ridge. [163]

She began to climb before dawn. [169]

The path wound upward through black rock slick with condensation, past the treeline, past the clouds themselves, which settled below her like a second ocean. [194] Her breath came hard, but her steps remained deliberate, softly commanding even the mountain to let her pass. [211] She had always moved that way — not with the bombast of kings but with the quiet authority of someone who understood that true power was a whisper the world leaned in to hear. [243] Even disenchanted, even faithless in her own sovereignty, she could not shed that quality. [257] It lived in her bones. [262]

The cobalt grotto revealed itself as the last clouds parted beneath her feet. [275] It was a cathedral of blue stone veined with something that pulsed faintly, as though the mountain had a circulatory system all its own. [299] The chamber opened to the sky, and overhead the stars looked wounded, their light not white but faintly rose, trickling downward in threads so delicate they resembled lace. [328] Lace that could cut. [332] She felt it on her skin — the finest menace, beautiful and sharp, each thread of starlight carrying a vibration that hummed against her pulse. [354]

Deeper inside, the grotto narrowed into a second chamber: the ember grotto on the ridge, where the rock glowed dull orange as if remembering some primordial fire. [380] Here the bleeding starlight pooled on the floor in a shallow basin, mingling with the ember-light until the liquid shimmered between crimson and gold. [403] She knelt. [405]

In the pool she saw the dream. [412]

Not a reflection — the dream itself, alive and dimensioned, the same vision that had tormented her for years. [429] A woman who looked like her but was not her, standing at the edge of an impossible sky, holding a crown made of fractured light. [453] The woman's mouth moved. [457] This time, in the silence of the grotto, the queen finally heard the words. [470]

"You were never meant to rule a kingdom. [478] You were meant to rule the threshold." [485]

The pool rippled, and the vision dissolved into ordinary light. [495] She exhaled — a long, trembling breath that fogged in the cool air. [508] And then she saw them: the first fireflies of summer, drifting up from the clouds below, tiny lanterns breaching the altitude where no firefly should survive. [535] Someone else exhaled beside her. [540]

She turned. [542] A girl, no older than fifteen, stood at the grotto's entrance, breath still visible in a shared cloud that mingled with the queen's own. [566] The girl's eyes were wide, fixed on the fireflies, and in that shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer, something ancient and electric passed between them. [594] Recognition. [595]

"You dream it too," the queen said. [602] It was not a question. [608]

The girl nodded. [611] "Every night. [613] The bleeding sky. [616] The crown that cuts." [620]

The queen looked back at the pool, at the ember walls, at the lace of wounded starlight still drifting down like a net meant to catch them both. [648] The mystery of her recurring dreams had never been about solving a riddle. [661] It had been about arriving here, at this moment, to find the other dreamer. [674]

She removed her crown — the real one, gold and emerald, the weight she had resented for seven years — and set it on the stone floor. [700]

"Then we climb higher," she said, softly commanding, and the girl followed her out of the grotto and into the bleeding sky above. [724]
