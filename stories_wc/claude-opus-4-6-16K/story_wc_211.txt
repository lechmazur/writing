<story>The foghorn had been dying for three days, its voice thinning to a rasp before finally going silent on a Tuesday evening. [22] After that silence settled over the harbor district, Maren ascended the service elevator to the fifty-second floor and stepped through the glass door into the orchard. [45]

The trees were older than the building. [52] That was the peculiar truth no one could satisfactorily explain. [61] Apple and pear and quince trees, their roots threaded through engineered soil beds, their trunks gnarled with centuries of patient growing, though the skyscraper itself had stood only sixty years. [90] Maren had stopped questioning it long ago. [97] She was a venerable oath scribe -- the last one employed by the Municipal Archive of Affect -- and her work demanded acceptance of things that resisted explanation. [121]

She set her case on the stone bench beneath the largest quince tree and opened it. [136] Inside: a portable Edison-style recorder, six blank wax cylinders, a shaving blade, and a leather journal filled with phonetic transcriptions in Sumerian, Etruscan, and a dialect of Hittite so old that she was likely the only living person who could pronounce it. [175]

Maren spoke dead languages because the living ones were too imprecise for what she needed to capture. [192] Grief in Akkadian carried overtones that English could not replicate. [202] Joy in Proto-Celtic hit frequencies that modern tongues had abandoned. [212] Her motivation -- the purpose that had consumed the last forty years of her life -- was to archive emotional patterns: the recurring shapes that human feeling took across millennia, pressed into wax the way fossils pressed into stone. [247]

Tonight she would record the pattern of dread. [255] The foghorn's silence had made the city strange and the strangeness had made the people afraid, and Maren needed to capture that particular fear before it faded. [281]

She fitted a blank cylinder onto the mandrel and began to speak in Etruscan, letting the stylus cut grooves into the soft wax. [304] As she chanted, fine shavings curled from the cylinder's surface -- delicate amber ribbons that drifted onto her lap. [322] She collected them carefully. [326] Each wax cylinder phonograph shaving was a discarded sentence, a surplus of feeling that the groove could not hold. [343] She kept every one. [347]

It was while examining a single translucent shaving, holding it up to the orchard's lamplight, that the memory arrived: third grade, a field trip to the municipal phonograph archive, a docent showing her class how sound was stored in spirals. [385] She had pressed her thumb against a shaving just like this one and felt the ridges and thought, with a child's absolute conviction, that the wax was dreaming. [413]

Now, decades later, she let herself immerse in that memory completely -- the smell of old shellac, the docent's monotone, the weight of her too-large backpack -- and as she sank into it, her Etruscan chanting shifted without her permission. [450] The words rearranged themselves. [454] Her mouth produced a sentence she had not composed: a conjugation that fused past and future tense into a single verb form that Etruscan did not technically possess. [479]

She stopped the recorder. [483] Played it back. [486]

The cylinder spoke her voice, but the words described something that had not yet happened: a second silence, larger than the foghorn's, spreading from the harbor across the entire coast. [514] A silence in which every mechanical voice -- every alarm, every siren, every automated announcement -- would cease simultaneously. [530] And in that total quiet, people would hear what the city had been saying underneath all along. [546]

An accidental prophecy, cut into wax by a woman who had only meant to catalog fear. [562]

Maren sat beneath the quince tree and listened to the playback three times. [574] The orchard wind moved through branches that should not have been so old, carrying the faint sweetness of fruit that ripened in no known season. [597] The velvet dark pressed close. [602] Below, the harbor lay mute where the foghorn had once measured out the night in long, low syllables. [619]

She labeled the cylinder with trembling hands: Dread (Etruscan) / Possible Forecast / Unverified. [632] Then she placed the single shaving -- the one that had triggered the memory, the one that had opened the door -- into a small envelope and wrote on it: Evidence of dreaming wax. [662]

Maren closed her case. [666] The ancient trees leaned inward as if listening. [674] Somewhere far below, the silent harbor waited, and the city held its breath for a prophecy it did not yet know it had been given. [699]
