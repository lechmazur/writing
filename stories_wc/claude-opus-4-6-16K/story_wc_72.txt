The garden had waited centuries to be remembered, and when Maren finally descended through the fracture in the ocean floor, she found it remembering itself. [27]

Bioluminescent algae clung to trellises of coral and wrought iron, pulsing in rhythms that resembled breathing. [42] Anemones swayed where roses once climbed, and kelp had threaded itself through the lattice of forgotten pergolas, weaving a canopy that filtered the deep-sea light into something almost warm. [69] This was the sunken garden of Verath, a city that had slipped beneath the waves so gradually that its citizens had simply adapted, then fossilized, then been forgotten. [93]

All except one. [96]

She stood at the garden's center, on a pedestal of basalt laced with barnacles: a woman carved from marble, her arms extended as though offering something invisible to a visitor who never arrived. [126] Her surface was weathered but precise, every fold of her stone dress still sharp enough to suggest motion arrested mid-step. [145] When Maren swam closer, she felt the voice before she heard it -- a pressure behind her temples that resolved into language. [165]

*You've come because of the ampoule.* [171]

Maren stopped kicking. [174] The statue's eyes were blank, lidless stone, yet something behind them was irrefutably awake. [187] "How do you know about the ampoule?" [193]

*Because I'm the one who filled it.* [200]

Maren reached into the sealed pouch at her belt and withdrew the object that had consumed three years of her life: a small glass vessel, its walls stained deep purple from the foxglove tincture it had once contained. [236] Forensic botanists had identified the residue. [242] Historians had traced the ampoule to Verath. [249] Everyone agreed on the conclusion: the last queen of Verath had poisoned her city before the sea took it. [268] The foxglove-stained glass ampoule was proof of genocide. [277]

Maren had come to confirm this certainty. [284] Instead, the statue's telepathic voice began to dismantle it. [293]

*The queen -- my queen -- distilled foxglove for forty years. Not to kill. To heal.* [308] The statue's tone carried no defensiveness, only the incisively kind precision of someone who had spent centuries choosing exactly the right words. [328] *Foxglove steadies a failing heart. The city was sinking. The pressure changes were killing our people -- arrhythmias, seizures, hearts that simply stopped. She threaded her medicine through the structural weakness of the body itself, using the very channels that the pressure exploited to deliver the cure.* [372]

"Then why did they die?" Maren asked. [379]

*They didn't. Not from foxglove.* [385] A cascade of images flooded Maren's mind: the queen administering drops from the ampoule, citizens breathing easier, children laughing in this very garden as water rose inch by inch around the flower beds. [414] Then a second revelation: the city's council, terrified of the surface world's advancing armies, voting to let Verath sink entirely rather than be conquered. [437] Then a third: the queen, refusing to abandon the people who chose to stay, transforming herself -- *threading her consciousness into stone through the structural weakness between living tissue and mineral* -- so she could watch over the garden and testify, if anyone ever came to listen. [478]

"You gave up your body," Maren whispered. [485]

*I gave up my death. There's a difference.* [493] The statue's voice carried a faint warmth, something animate stirring in what should have been lifeless rock. [508] *The ampoule is not evidence of murder, Maren. It is evidence of care. But I understand why your people read it otherwise. Foxglove is poison and medicine both. The truth holds all of it.* [541]

Maren turned the ampoule in her fingers, watching the deep-sea light catch the purple stains. [556] For three years she had needed the story to be simple: a tyrant, a weapon, a clear moral. [572] Now the cascading revelations asked her to hold something harder -- a queen who healed and a city that chose its own drowning, love and loss braided together so tightly that separating them would destroy the thread. [605]

"If I tell this story with nuance, some people won't believe it," she said. [619]

*Some won't. But you didn't swim this deep to tell a comfortable story.* [631]

Maren looked at the garden: the animate stone, the breathing algae, the structures that had found new life in their ruin. [651] She placed the ampoule gently at the statue's feet, not as evidence but as an offering returned. [668]

"I'll tell it true," she said. [674]

The statue's blank eyes seemed, for just a moment, to soften. [685]

*Then Verath is no longer forgotten.* [691]

Maren ascended slowly, carrying the weight of nuance into a world that preferred certainty, knowing that the hardest truths are the ones that refuse to be only one thing. [720]

Behind her, in the garden, the stone woman stood with arms still extended, finally offering something to a visitor who had arrived. [741]
