Maren had worked the labyrinth for eleven years, patching its walls where root and stone disagreed, clearing the corridors of fallen leaves that carried old whispers. [26] It was honest work, mostly. [31] She trimmed the hedgerows, reset the flagstones, oiled the iron gates that led nowhere anyone remembered choosing to go. [50] The labyrinth was not a puzzle to her. [58] It was a building with bad plumbing and a tendency toward melancholy. [70]

The sorrow was measurable. [74] That was the part visitors never understood. [81] Every person who wandered the corridors left something behind - a weight, a residue - and the trees absorbed it. [100] The yews and hornbeams that formed the labyrinth's living walls grew dense with accumulated grief, their rings recording loss the way other trees recorded drought. [126] Maren had learned to read the bark years ago: hairline fractures for minor heartbreak, deep fissures for the kind of grief that rewrites a person entirely. [153] She kept a ledger. [157] Quantified sorrow, tallied by corridor and season, because someone had to track what the labyrinth held so it wouldn't hold too much. [178]

What she wanted - what had kept her here long past the point when the work stopped being about wages - was to understand what the trees actually witnessed. [206] Not the sorrow itself, but the shape of it. [215] The dreams people shed as they walked, half-remembered and fragmentary, clinging to branches like silk caught on thorns. [233] The trees saw these dreams. [238] Maren wanted to see them too. [244]

Tonight the storm had come and gone in under an hour, leaving the sky rinsed and the moon exposed like a clean bone. [266] The tower at the labyrinth's center stood stormlit, its stones still wet and gleaming. [280] Maren climbed the spiral stairs with the astronomer's sextant tucked under her arm - the one she'd found two winters ago in a corridor that hadn't existed the week before. [310] Its mirror was cracked, its arc bent slightly where someone had dropped it or thrown it in frustration. [327] An astronomer had once tried to chart the labyrinth from above, to fix its shifting geometry against the stars. [345] They had failed, obviously. [349] The labyrinth didn't answer to constellations. [355]

But Maren didn't need it to measure angles. [363] She needed it to measure fragments. [369]

She reached the tower's top and set the sextant on the stone ledge. [382] Moonlight struck the cracked mirror, and as it always did, the light mended something in her - the ache in her knees, the persistent cough, the bruise on her wrist from yesterday's collapsed archway. [415] She healed in moonlight. [419] She had never questioned this. [424] It was a mundane miracle, like the way bread rises or the way a corridor sometimes smells of someone's childhood kitchen. [444] You accept these things or you stop being able to do the work. [456]

She lifted the sextant to her eye and began to deconstruct the night. [469]

Through the fractured mirror, the dreams were visible - scattered across the labyrinth like luminous pollen, caught in branches, pooled in dead ends. [492] Each one a small, broken narrative: a woman running toward a door that kept receding, a child holding a cup that wouldn't fill, an old man speaking to someone who'd already left. [524] Maren mapped them, noting positions against the sextant's bent arc, charting each dream's location the way the astronomer had once charted stars. [547] Corridor seven held a cluster of falling dreams. [555] The east passage was dense with dreams of water. [564]

Slowly, a pattern emerged. [568] The dreams weren't random. [572] They followed the same paths the dreamers had walked, but reversed - flowing backward toward the roots, toward whatever the trees kept in their deepest wood. [599]

Then it happened. [602] The labyrinth fell perfectly, impossibly still. [608] No wind. [610] No settling stone. [613] No breath of leaf against leaf. [619] In that silence, a pin - one of the brass pins from the sextant's broken hinge - slipped from the ledge and struck the floor of the corridor below. [647] The sound rang like a bell in a cathedral. [655]

And in that moment, every tree in the labyrinth exhaled. [665] The bark split along its sorrow-lines and light poured out - not moonlight, but the stored luminescence of ten thousand dreams finally mapped, finally witnessed by someone other than wood and root. [697] Maren saw it all: every grief, every fragmented hope, every quiet miracle that had walked these corridors and been absorbed without acknowledgment. [720]

She lowered the sextant. [724] Her ledger would need new pages. [730]

The trees had witnessed everything. [735] And now, so had she. [740]
