The storms had not relented since the empathy virus burned through the valley, and Maren climbed the rope ladders into the hanging orchard with the same methodical care she brought to every task. [33] The apple trees grew from platforms bolted into the ravine walls, their roots threading through mesh and stone, their branches heavy with fruit that nobody came to harvest anymore. [60] She was not here for apples. [66]

Maren was a truffle forager by trade, rational to her marrow, and she had learned that the fungal networks thriving beneath the orchard platforms produced something rare: a black truffle variant with neurochemical properties referenced only in discredited textbooks. [101] Those old pharmacologies, laughed out of universities decades ago, described rumored cures for conditions that had not yet existed. [117] Now one of those conditions was real. [123]

The empathy virus had done what its name suggested. [132] It stripped the membrane between one person's suffering and another's, making every human within proximity a raw nerve for everyone else's pain. [153] Society had not collapsed so much as folded inward, people retreating into isolation because closeness had become unbearable. [169] Maren herself had been infected, but her rationalism gave her a framework: she catalogued her involuntary emotional responses, noted their triggers, and moved through the world like a scientist walking through fire, documenting each burn. [200]

She wanted to cultivate psychological safety, not just for herself but for the small community sheltering in the ravine's lower caves. [220] Fourteen people who flinched at each other's grief. [228] The truffles, according to those mocked texts, could occlude the virus's hyperactive empathy receptors, restoring the natural boundary between self and other without eliminating compassion entirely. [253] A calibrated cure. [256] She believed it was possible because she had tested crude preparations on herself, and for six hours afterward, she could sit beside weeping Jonas without her own chest splitting open. [285]

But the truffles were not the only thing hidden in the orchard. [296]

She found it on her third descent into the root mesh beneath platform seven: an antique glass eye, cradled in oilcloth and nestled inside a waterproof case that had been wired to the underside of a plank. [332] It was beautiful, hand-painted with an iris of impossible violet, and heavy in a way that suggested something concealed within the glass itself. [356] When she held it up to the storm-grey light filtering through the ravine, she saw a dark shape suspended at its core. [376]

A smuggled relic. [379] She recognized the craftsmanship from pre-virus auction catalogues: objects of cultural patrimony hidden inside prosthetics and medical devices to cross borders undetected. [399] Someone had used this orchard as a dead drop before the virus made travel meaningless. [413]

She should have put it back. [419] Instead, she carried it down to the caves, and when fourteen faces turned toward her, she felt their collective anxiety press against her sternum like a wave. [445]

"I found something that isn't mine," she said, because the virus had made her involuntarily truthful. [461] Not as a symptom listed in any medical text, but as a consequence of feeling others so acutely that deception became a kind of violence against oneself. [487] Lying, post-virus, hurt the liar more than the lied-to. [497]

She placed the glass eye on the stone table and explained the truffles, the discredited research, her self-experiments. [514] She explained that she did not know what the relic inside the eye was, or who it belonged to, or whether keeping it constituted theft from a world that might no longer track such things. [547]

Jonas, whose grief she had learned to sit beside, picked up the glass eye and turned it slowly. [564] "It sees nothing," he said. [569] "But it's still beautiful." [573]

That was the fractured grace of their lives now: everything was broken and transparent simultaneously. [586] The storms battered the ravine walls and the orchard swayed on its cables and the truffles grew quietly in the dark, threading their networks through dead wood, producing what the dismissed scholars had somehow foreseen. [618]

Maren began her preparations that night, grinding the truffles with mortar and pestle while the glass eye watched from the table with its violet iris. [644] She would occlude the pain without erasing the knowledge of it. [655] She would give her people back the thin, essential wall between feeling for someone and drowning in them. [672]

The relic remained unclaimed, a smuggled treasure with no destination, and in time it became a kind of talisman for their small community: proof that the world before had also hidden fragile, precious things inside bodies designed to look whole. [711] They were all glass eyes now, Maren thought. [719] Crafted to approximate sight, carrying something ancient and unnameable at their centers, held up to whatever grey light the storms allowed. [738]

She measured the dose carefully. [743] Rationality was its own form of love. [750]
