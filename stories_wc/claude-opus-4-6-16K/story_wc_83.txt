Nadia keeps a geode crystal on the console beside her terminal, split open, its amethyst interior catching the observatory's dim emergency lighting. [22] It was a wedding gift, the only object she carried out of the rubble. [36]

The floating observatory drifts at twenty-eight kilometers above sea level, tethered to nothing, suspended by helium cells and the indifference of stratospheric winds. [59] She has been here eleven months. [65] Below, the same country that killed her husband continues its geometries of war, and above, the universe pours down its data, unfiltered by cloud cover or conscience. [92]

The circuit breakers tripped again--loss of coolant to the primary sensor array, an automated safety response. [109] She has forty minutes while they cool before the system resets and the telescope resumes its scheduled survey of predetermined coordinates. [130] Forty minutes that belong to no one. [137] Forty minutes for the hunt. [142]

She is hunting for where unused potential pools. [150]

Not metaphorically--or not only metaphorically. [156] Through perturbation theory, she models small deviations in gravitational fields, tracking anomalies that suggest mass-energy configurations the standard surveys overlook. [176] Pockets where something should be happening but is not. [185] Dark matter knots. [188] Stillborn stellar nurseries. [191] Places the universe allocated energy and then forgot to spend it. [202]

She calls them pools in her private notes. [210] Her advisor at the university would have called them statistical noise. [221] Her advisor never had to lie beneath a collapsed table while a Hellfire missile's secondary fragmentation turned a courtyard of dancers into silence. [244]

That is what started it--the unfiltered awakening. [252] Not enlightenment, nothing so clean. [257] More like having every membrane between yourself and reality scorched away simultaneously. [269] After the strike, everything became intangibly tangible--grief had weight and texture, but you could never set it down. [288] Sound had edges. [291] The distance between two points on a star chart felt like something she could bruise herself against. [308] Physics stopped being abstract. [312] Every equation was a body. [317] Every variable, a name. [321]

She works fast. [324] The perturbation models require her to introduce small theoretical disturbances into the field equations, then observe how the system's behavior shifts. [345] Where the response is disproportionate to the input, something is hidden. [356] Something pooled and waiting. [360]

The geode watches from the console. [366] She picked it up from the wreckage because it was whole when nothing else was. [381] Later she cracked it open with a hammer--needed to see if the inside matched the outside's dull promise. [400] It did not. [403] It exceeded it. [406] Crystals like frozen light, like compressed patience. [413] All that potential, pooled inside plain rock, waiting for someone to break it open and look. [429]

Her fingers move across the keyboard. [435] The data reshapes itself. [439] There--a region in Cygnus where the perturbation response spikes beyond any reasonable model. [453] Energy pooled so densely it warps the local metric, yet no emission, no signature. [467] Just potential, holding its breath. [472]

She marks the coordinates. [476] Saves them to her private drive, not the institutional one. [486] These forty minutes are hers. [491] This discovery is hers. [495] She has learned what institutions do with potential they cannot control: they send a missile. [510]

Seventeen minutes remain on the breakers. [516] She leans back, and the bleak exhilaration floods her--that specific feeling of finding something enormous while knowing it changes nothing about what was lost. [541] The courtyard is still rubble. [546] Yusef is still dead. [550] The wedding music still ended mid-note. [556] But here, eleven months later, floating above the world that broke her, she has found a place where the universe itself is holding something back. [581]

She understands it. [584] She is it. [587] A survivor is a pool of unused potential--energy that was meant to dissipate in the blast but did not. [607] A life that should have ended but pooled instead, dense and dark and waiting, warping everything around it with the gravity of what almost happened. [632]

The circuit breakers click. [636] The cooling cycle completes. [640] The telescope hums back to life, resuming its authorized sweep of catalogued stars. [653]

Nadia pockets the coordinates, touches the geode's crystalline interior once--cold, sharp, real--and returns to the scheduled work. [672] But she is different now. [677] The hunt has shown her something the surveys never will: that the universe is full of unopened geodes, full of potential pooling in the dark, and that the only instrument sensitive enough to find them is a person who has been broken open herself.
