The future arrived three days early, and Sable knew because the hedges told her. [14]

She had been trimming the eastern corridor of the labyrinth when the topiary began reshaping itself—branches twisting into configurations she had only seen in her sketches, the private ones she kept beneath her cot in the groundskeeper's cottage. [53] Spirals that mimicked nerve endings. [58] Archways that recalled the vaulted geometry of dreaming. [66] The maze was becoming what she had imagined it could be, years ahead of any schedule she had dared to set. [87]

Now she stood in the cobalt glade at the labyrinth's center, the sky overhead deepening toward indigo as dusk settled like silk over the clearing. [112] In her hand she clutched a single maze topiary clipping—a sprig of boxwood still warm from its impossible growth, shaped like a key she had never cut. [140]

Sable was root-bound in every sense that mattered. [148] Her boots had not crossed the labyrinth's outer wall in eleven years. [160] The soil knew her footsteps. [165] The hedges leaned toward her when she passed, the way sunflowers lean toward light. [179] She was their keeper, their interpreter, their prisoner. [187] Long ago she had signed the covenant—service to the maze in exchange for visions of what lay beyond its walls. [208] Dreams poured through the root systems at night, carried on groundwater from distant sleepers, and Sable received them all. [227]

But the covenant had been eclipsed. [233] She understood that now. [237] The original agreement—tend the maze, receive the dreams—had been overtaken by something larger, something the maze itself had been working toward without her knowledge. [263] The hedges were not merely growing. [269] They were converging. [272] Every dream Sable had gathered over eleven years was expressing itself in the architecture of living wood, and the labyrinth was reshaping into a map of the unconscious territory where all those dreams overlapped. [306]

The intersection of dreams. [310] She had sought it for years, purposefully curious, following each vision not for its own beauty but for the coordinates it offered—the recurring landmarks, the shared hallways, the faces that appeared in one sleeper's dream and then another's. [349] She had always believed there was a place where the dreams met. [361] A nexus. [363] A crossroads beneath consciousness. [367] And now the maze was building it. [374]

She turned the clipping over in her fingers, studying the way its leaves curled into the shape of a skeleton key. [395] Her heart hammered with anxious elation—the thrill of arrival tangled with the terror of what arrival meant. [413] If the future had come early, she was not prepared. [423] Her maps were incomplete. [427] Her body ached from years of labor. [434] The scars on her hands, where thorns had opened her skin season after season, pulsed faintly in the blue light. [454]

The scars. [456] She lifted her palms and stared. [462] Eleven years of cuts, and she had never noticed the pattern—but in the cobalt dusk, with the glade humming its low electric frequency, she could see it. [490] The scars on her left hand mirrored the eastern corridors. [500] The scars on her right traced the western passages. [509] Her body had become a map of the maze, and the maze had become a map of dreams, and now, linking through scars, she could read the final passage. [538]

She pressed the clipping into the oldest scar on her right palm. [550] The boxwood key sank into her skin as though her hand were soil. [563]

The glade shuddered. [566] The hedges parted. [569]

Beyond them: not a corridor but a threshold. [577] Light that smelled of every dream she had ever catalogued, braided together into a single luminous corridor that stretched toward a vanishing point she recognized from a thousand nights of borrowed sleep. [609]

Heed the maze, the roots whispered through her feet. [618] Heed what you have grown. [623]

Sable stepped forward. [626] The cobalt sky folded shut behind her like a book whose story had finally reached its true beginning. [644] The intersection was not a place, she realized. [652] It was a moment—this moment—when the dreamer and the dream refused to remain separate any longer. [670]

Her roots held. [673] Her vision opened. [676] She walked into the convergence, trembling, radiant, unbound. [684]
