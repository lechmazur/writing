The orchard had no business growing where it did, but the apple trees never asked permission. [17] Their roots threaded through cracked marble floors and their branches fanned across the vaulted ceiling of the cathedral, heavy with fruit that caught the dusty light filtering through broken rose windows. [44] Pear and plum saplings had colonized the nave, while cherry trees climbed the old stone columns like ivy with ambitions. [62] It was here, among the rafters thick with leaves, that Maren Sollis kept her workshop, balanced on a platform of old choir pews lashed between two ancient oaks that had split the transept wide open decades ago. [93]

Maren was a quartz-eye mender, one of the last who could repair the crystalline prosthetics that had replaced glass eyes three generations back. [114] Her grandmother had invented the technique. [120] Her mother had refined it. [125] Maren had inherited it the way one inherits a language spoken only at home -- fluently, but with no one left to talk to. [148]

The breach of contract had changed everything. [155] Six weeks ago, the Syndicate of Opticians had declared her grandmother's original patents void, claiming the licensing agreement had expired through disuse. [173] They seized the workshop in the lower city, confiscated her tools, and told her the craft was now their intellectual property. [193] Maren had responded by climbing into the abandoned Cathedral of St. Venn with nothing but the old leather bag her mother had carried for thirty years, and she had refused to come down. [223]

"You can't just live in a tree," called her daughter Elsa from below, hands on her hips, sixteen years old and endearingly feisty in the way that made Maren both proud and exhausted. [253] "The Syndicate's lawyers sent another letter." [259]

"Throw it in the compost," Maren said, not looking up from the cracked quartz eye she was examining. [276] The iris had fractured along its mineral grain, a common enough injury, but her good loupes were gone with the seized workshop. [297]

"Mama, you have to actually fight them. [304] With lawyers, not stubbornness." [309]

"Stubbornness is cheaper." [312]

Elsa climbed up anyway, the way she always did, using the knotted rope Maren had hung from the lowest oak branch. [332] She settled onto the platform and watched her mother work, and after a moment she untied the pale blue ribbon from her hair and held it out. [358]

"Use this to hold the eye steady. [365] You keep squinting because you can't grip it right." [374]

Maren looked at the ribbon -- silk, fraying at one end, the same one she'd tied in Elsa's hair on her first day of school. [397] She wrapped it around the quartz eye, creating a soft cradle between her fingers, and suddenly the fracture lines resolved into clarity. [418]

"Your grandmother used to do something like this," Maren murmured, surprised. [428] "Silk dampens the vibration when you're polishing the iris. [437] I'd forgotten." [439]

"See? [440] You need me up here." [445]

Maren smiled and reached for the old leather bag. [454] She'd barely opened it since her mother's death, carrying it more as talisman than toolkit. [468] Now she unclasped it and spread its contents across the pew: a bone-handled burnisher she didn't recognize, a jar of colloidal silver, hand-ground polishing compound in a tin labeled in her grandmother's writing, and folded papers covered in diagrams she'd never studied. [507]

The diagrams showed a mending technique that predated the patents entirely. [518] Her grandmother had developed the method before signing with the Syndicate. [528] The original knowledge was unencumbered, free, older than any contract. [537]

"This is it," Maren whispered. [542] "This is the proof that the craft was ours before it was theirs." [554]

"Accidental evidence?" [556] Elsa raised an eyebrow. [560]

"Your grandmother always said wisdom hides in the bag you forget to unpack." [573] Maren laughed at herself -- she'd carried the answer for years without knowing. [585]

She would persist. [588] Not just to fight the Syndicate, but to teach Elsa what the papers contained, to bridge the generational wisdom that stretched from her grandmother's hands through her own and into her daughter's clever fingers. [618] The patents could expire, the contracts could breach and crumble like cathedral stone, but knowledge passed from mother to daughter was a deciduous vow -- it might shed its leaves in winter, look bare and dead against a cold sky, but it always returned green. [660]

Maren held up the quartz eye, cradled in blue silk, and began to polish it using the compound her grandmother had mixed decades ago. [684] Above them, apples ripened in the rafters of a ruined church, fed by rain that fell through holes no one had bothered to repair, and the light that came through was the most honest light Maren had ever worked by. [720]

"Teach me," Elsa said. [724]

So Maren did. [727]
