She had been telling stories since before the language had a word for forgetting, and now the language was dying in her throat. [25]

Maren sat at the edge of the bone tower's highest platform, her fingers tracing the copper veins that threaded beneath the skin of her forearms—remnants of a ritual she'd undergone decades ago, when the elders still breathed and the old tongue still lived on more lips than hers alone. [71] The copper carried stories through her blood, humming faintly when she spoke in the ancient syllables, falling silent when she used the traders' pidgin that had swallowed her people's words one generation at a time. [103]

Below her, the canyon stretched in every direction, its walls built from the calcified remains of leviathans that had died before memory began. [126] Towers of bone rose from the canyon floor like pale fingers reaching for an answer the sky refused to give. [145] Every sound that entered this place lived forever, bouncing between the walls, layering over itself until the canyon became a tunnel of echoes where the past never fully faded. [175] If she whispered now, her voice would join the thousands already trapped here—prayers, songs, arguments, lullabies—all in a language that fewer than a dozen people still understood. [204]

Soon it would be fewer than eleven. [211] Old Tvari had stopped speaking last week, her mind finally surrendering to silence. [223]

Maren opened her palm and studied the diamond resting there. [233] It was the size of a sparrow's egg, clouded with a deep internal fracture that split the light into something wounded and strange. [256] The flawed diamond had passed through six storytellers before her, and each one had died mid-sentence, their final tales unfinished. [276] Cursed, people said. [279] Maren thought the word was too simple. [286] The diamond didn't kill—it demanded. [292] It wanted something none of her predecessors had been able to give. [304]

She believed she finally understood what it wanted. [313]

Her life's work had been to translate texture into sound—to find the precise syllable for the grain of weathered bone beneath her fingertip, the exact tonal phrase for the roughness of canyon wind against dry skin. [350] The old language had words for these things that the traders' tongue could never replicate. [366] Words that were not metaphors but direct transmissions, sounds that made the listener's skin prickle with the texture being described. [385] When those words died, the sensations they carried would become inexpressible, sealed away from human experience like light trapped inside stone. [405]

Like light trapped inside a flawed diamond. [413]

She watched the sky. [417] A flock of birds—canyon swifts—burst from a crevice in the bone wall and wheeled overhead, their formation shifting like a living script against the pale clouds. [444] Maren had learned years ago to read meaning through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, the way her grandmother had taught her: each murmuration a grammar, each shift in direction a conjugation. [480] Now the swifts drew a shape she recognized. [489] It was the old glyph for "resonance"—the concept that every surface had a voice if you knew how to listen. [510]

She closed her fingers around the diamond and felt its fracture line pulse against her copper veins. [528] The curse was not malice. [533] It was hunger. [537] The diamond needed a voice for its broken interior, and no storyteller before her had known how to harness a sound for the texture of shattered light. [565]

Maren opened her mouth and spoke. [572]

The word she used had no equivalent in any living language. [584] It described the feeling of brightness interrupted—the specific, granular roughness where clarity meets its own flaw and scatters. [601] She spoke it slowly, quietly articulate, each syllable placed with the precision of a woman who had spent a lifetime mapping the space between sensation and speech. [630]

The diamond trembled. [633] The fracture inside it shifted, not healing but singing, the internal flaw catching her word and amplifying it outward through the canyon. [655] The bone towers hummed. [659] The echoes caught her syllable and multiplied it, weaving it into the ancient chorus already living in the walls, and for one moment the canyon spoke the old language again in a voice so vast that Maren felt it in the copper beneath her skin. [706]

The diamond went clear. [711] Not flawless—the fracture remained—but luminous now, as if the word had given its darkness a purpose. [731]

Maren exhaled. [733] The old language had one fewer speaker today than yesterday, and tomorrow it might have one fewer still. [752] But the canyon remembered. [756] The echoes would carry her word long after the last throat forgot how to shape it, and anyone who pressed their ear to the bone walls would feel, without understanding why, the precise texture of broken light made whole by sound. [798]
