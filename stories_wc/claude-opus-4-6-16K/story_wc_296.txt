The magic trick failed at sundown, and the lake began to swallow itself.

Maren watched from the shore as the water spiraled inward, dragging the orchard of dead apple trees into its gravitational throat. [34] Roots tore free from the mudbanks with sounds like snapping tendons, and the trees joined the slow, majestic rotation—a vortex of bark, black water, and cursed fruit turning at the lake's heart like the pupil of some vast, patient eye. [69] She had tried the unbinding spell three times. [77] Each attempt had accelerated the curse rather than dissolving it. [86] Now the orchard vortex churned with warlike serenity, violent in its motion yet eerily calm in its sound, as though destruction could be a form of meditation. [109]

She was a druid, but not the kind the songs remembered. [120] Maren was guarded—guarded in speech, guarded in trust, guarded in the way she held her staff across her body like a barrier between herself and anyone who came close. [149] She had earned that posture through years of finding what others had lost. [162] It was her gift, her affliction: she found lost things. [172] Missing children in snowdrifts, stolen heirlooms in river mud, buried bones that families never wanted unearthed. [185] She found them all, and each discovery peeled something away from her that mirrors could not show her was missing. [202]

That was why she had come to the cursed lake. [212] Not for the village that had hired her, not for the gold they scraped together from empty pockets. [228] She had come to discover what mirrors don't show—the thing inside her that had gone absent, the warmth she once felt when the wind touched her face, the capacity to stand beside another person without flinching. [265]

The vortex would have the answer. [271] The curse had swallowed confessions for a century, freezing them in the water like insects in amber. [287] Townspeople had whispered their sins into the lake for generations, and the lake had held them, suspended, unthawed. [305] Frozen confessions, crystallized guilt. [309] Somewhere in that spiraling archive was her mother's voice, her mother's last secret, spoken into these waters thirty years ago before she walked in and never walked out. [337]

Maren reached into her satchel and removed the flesh-eating plant seed. [348] It was small, dark, and warm against her palm, pulsing with a hunger that matched the vortex's own appetite. [367] The carnivorous bramble it would become was the only organism that could root itself inside a magical current and grow against entropy. [390] She needed it to anchor her path inward. [398]

She threw the seed into the outer edge of the vortex. [409] It caught the current and sank, and within moments a thorned vine erupted from the water, latching onto a spinning tree trunk with barbed tendrils. [435] The vine fed on the cursed wood, growing rapidly, and Maren stepped onto its thickening stem like a bridge. [455]

She moved through expanding circles, working from the vortex's rim toward its center. [467] Each ring she crossed brought louder voices—the frozen confessions thawing as the curse destabilized. [480] She heard a man admit to poisoning a well. [489] She heard a girl confess she had never loved her husband. [500] She heard weeping without words, which was the most honest confession of all. [513]

At the innermost circle, where the trees spun so close they formed a wooden wall, Maren found her. [531] Not her mother's body—that was long dissolved—but her mother's voice, hanging in the air like frost that refused to melt. [553]

"I left because I found something I couldn't return," the voice said. [565] "I found your father's cruelty, and I could not put it back where it belonged. [580] I could not unbend what he had bent in me. [590] So I gave myself to the water. [597] Forgive me for making you the one who finds everything except peace." [608]

Maren stood in the eye of the vortex, the trees wheeling around her, the carnivorous vine creaking beneath her feet. [628] She let the words enter the guarded place behind her ribs. [639] She felt something unbend there—a long-clenched thing, a fist she had mistaken for her spine. [655]

She breathed out, and the vortex slowed. [662]

The confessions, finally heard, dissolved into the water like salt. [672] The trees settled, roots groping downward into the lakebed, finding purchase in mud that was no longer cursed. [690] The vine beneath her calcified into a bridge of bone-white wood. [701]

Maren walked back across it to the shore, her staff held loosely at her side for the first time in years. [721] The mirror of the stilled lake showed her reflection clearly—but she no longer needed it to tell her what she carried. [742] She already knew. [745] She had found the lost thing at last, and it was not her mother's confession. [760]

It was permission to stop searching. [766]
