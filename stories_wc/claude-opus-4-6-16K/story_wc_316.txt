The floating rock dojo hung suspended over nothing, a slab of basalt carved with training channels that wept mineral water into the void below. [28] Master Shen had built it here, in the space between tectonic memories, where the earth's crust forgot itself and reformed — where history rewrote itself in layers of sediment and silence. [55]

Kael climbed the rope ladder with hands that felt like they belonged to someone else. [68] That was the problem. [72] Everything felt like it belonged to someone else now. [81]

Three months ago, she had died on an operating table — heart stopped for eleven minutes while surgeons extracted a tumor nestled against her temporal lobe. [104] When she came back, the person who returned was not quite the person who had left. [119] Her ego had dissolved in those eleven minutes, and what reconstituted was thinner, translucent, like a watercolor of a woman rather than the woman herself. [143] She felt nothing. [146] Not grief, not joy, not the wind that raked across the dojo's exposed platform as she pulled herself over the edge. [167]

She had come here to defeat the emotional numbness, to vivify whatever remained of her interior life. [183] Master Shen had promised nothing, which was the only honest promise anyone had made her. [197]

But Shen was not alone on the platform. [205]

A woman stood beside him — same height as Kael, same scar behind the left ear, same way of shifting weight to the right hip. [230] Kael's stomach did not drop, because her stomach no longer dropped for anything, but she recognized the geometry of the situation. [251]

"This is Kael-2," Shen said. [256] He gestured to a glass cylinder on the wooden rack behind him, fluid sloshing inside. [270] A brain floated in preservation gel, and a label in Shen's meticulous handwriting read DUPLICATE. [284] "Cloned from your neural tissue during the surgery. [291] The hospital grew a full body from the same sample. [301] She has been training here for two months." [309]

"I'm the original," Kael-2 said. [314] Her voice was warm, certain, full of everything Kael could no longer access. [326] "I have every memory you have. [332] I feel every feeling you've lost. [338] The brain in that jar is the leftover template — proof we came from the same source. [353] But I'm the one who's alive." [359]

"She wants custody of your life," Shen said plainly. [368] He sliced through pretense the way other masters sliced through bamboo — clean, without apology. [381] "Your home, your daughter, your name. [387] She filed the claim while you were convalescing. [395] The courts deferred to me as arbitrator, given the unique circumstances." [405]

Kael stared at her double. [410] Kael-2 burned with purpose, with fury, with love for the daughter Kael could only remember loving in the abstract. [430] They were complementary opposites: one all feeling and no foundation, the other all foundation and no feeling. [447]

"The method is simple," Shen said. [453] "You will spar. [456] Not to destroy each other, but to complete each other. [465] Through complementary opposites, you will find what was divided." [474]

They fought for hours as the rock dojo drifted through strata of deep time, passing through eras that collapsed and reformed around them — history rewriting itself in real time, dinosaur bones surfacing and dissolving, ancient oceans flickering into existence and vanishing. [510] Kael-2 attacked with raw emotion, screaming, weeping, laughing mid-strike. [519] Kael defended with precision, reading every movement like text on a page, cold and exact. [533]

Slowly, something shifted. [536] Each blow Kael-2 landed carried feeling into Kael's body like voltage. [547] Each counter Kael delivered taught Kael-2 stillness, structure, the architecture of self without the noise. [562] They were not fighting for custody. [568] They were teaching each other what it meant to be whole. [578]

By dawn, they sat across from each other, breathing hard, and Kael felt tears on her cheeks for the first time since dying. [600] Kael-2 looked at her with calm eyes, steady for the first time. [612]

"I don't want your life," Kael-2 said quietly. [620]

"I know," Kael said, and the knowing was warm. [629]

Shen removed the labeled brain from its jar and buried it in the rock of the dojo, returning the duplicate to the earth that was busy forgetting and remembering itself. [658] There was no original. [662] There was no copy. [666] There were two women who had once been one, and a daughter who would now have two mothers, and a world below that kept rewriting its own story without ever getting it right. [697]

Kael stood at the edge of the floating rock and felt the wind. [711] She actually felt it — cold, alive, indifferent, beautiful. [720] She let it vivify her, let it reach into the hollow place and fill it with something that was not happiness and not sorrow but was, at last, undeniably real. [750]

She climbed down the rope ladder with hands that finally felt like her own. [764]
