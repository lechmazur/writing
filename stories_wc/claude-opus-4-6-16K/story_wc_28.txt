The great fire had eaten the sky three days ago, and what remained above the ancient plaza was a fractured dome of ash and light, cracked like porcelain dropped by a careless god. [35]

Selin stood at the plaza's center, where the fountain had once sung, and pressed her palm against the mosaic stepping stone beneath her boots. [58] The tessera had come loose again—a single tile of cobalt and gold, pried free from the minaret mosaic that once decorated the great tower's base before the flames took everything vertical and left only what was flat and broken. [95] She turned it in her fingers, feeling where the glaze had chipped away in patterns that told her things no living person should know. [114]

She was retrocognitively trapped. [118] That was the term the scholars had used before the fire consumed them too, back when they still studied her condition with clipboards and furrowed brows. [140] Every object she touched pulled her backward into its history, and every history she entered refused to release her cleanly. [158] Parts of her remained in every past she visited—a sliver of attention here, a fragment of feeling there—so that the present moment reached her only through a haze of accumulated memory that was not her own. [193]

She had learned to use this. [199] That was what made her dangerous, and that was what made her gentle. [213]

The chipped patterns on the mosaic stepping stone were speaking now, feeding her visions of the artisan who had laid each tile two hundred years ago. [237] His name had been Oren. [242] His hands had been steady and his heart had been sick with grief because his daughter had been sentenced to death for stealing bread. [264] Selin felt his despair soak into her like rain into dry earth, and she cradled it there, holding it carefully inside the steel architecture of her discipline. [291]

To cradle empathy in arms of steel—that was her purpose, the reason she had chosen this path. [308] She was a gentle radical, a woman who believed the most subversive act in a world hardened by fire and loss was to feel precisely and completely what others had felt, then to act from that feeling with unshakeable resolve. [346]

The tessera showed her more. [351] Oren had gone to the magistrate. [357] He had begged. [360] The magistrate had shown him an aberrant mercy—not a pardon, but a renaming. [373] He had offered to rename Oren's daughter, to strike her identity from the records and replace it with another, so that the girl who had stolen bread ceased to exist and a new girl, unburdened, could walk free. [409] The cost was that Oren could never speak her original name again. [421] He would have to look at his own child and call her someone else. [434]

Selin's breath caught. [437] She understood now why the tessera kept loosening from the mosaic, why this particular fragment of the minaret's story demanded to be held. [456] The mercy that saved the girl had also hollowed the father. [466] He had laid these tiles with hands that could no longer shape the word that mattered most to him, and so he had embedded it here, in the geometry of blue and gold, a name disguised as pattern. [502]

She traced the chips in the glaze. [509] There—in the places where time and feet had worn the surface—the original design emerged more clearly, and she could read it. [530] Dahra. [531] The daughter's first name, written in tessellation, hidden for two centuries beneath the boots of strangers. [545]

Selin placed the tessera back into its socket in the stepping stone. [557] She pressed it firm with both thumbs until it clicked into the mosaic's embrace. [570] Then she spoke the name aloud. [576]

"Dahra." [577]

Her voice carried across the empty plaza, up through the shattered sky, warm as a hearth and cold as the acknowledgment that some wounds do not heal—they simply become architecture. [602]

She felt the retrocognitive pull release, just slightly. [610] Not freedom, never that, but a loosening. [617] Oren's grief settled into its proper place in history, no longer clawing at her present. [630] She had done what he could not. [637] She had renamed the silence back into sound. [645]

Around her, the broken sky let through a single beam of light that touched the mosaic and made the blue tiles glow like something almost alive. [670] Selin stood, knees aching, heart full of a stranger's two-hundred-year-old sorrow that she carried willingly because someone had to, because empathy unhoused was just sentiment, and empathy given structure—given steel—was revolution. [703]

She walked to the next stepping stone. [710] Its surface was chipped too, in patterns she had not yet read. [722] She knelt, and pressed her palm flat, and let the past pour in. [735]

The shattered sky watched, indifferent and beautiful, as she continued her work of aberrant mercy—one name, one tile, one borrowed grief at a time. [759]
