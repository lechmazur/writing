The village of Canopis hung in the crowns of ancient cypress trees, its walkways woven from living branches that the elders had coaxed into bridges over centuries. [30] Maren climbed the last rope ladder at dusk, when the air between the leaves turned violet and the sounds of the forest floor faded into something older than language. [56] She was an ambitious herbalist, the youngest ever permitted to tend the village's hanging gardens, and she had spent three years earning her place among the roots and fog. [82]

But ambition, she was learning, moved like wind through the canopy — restless, directionless, snapping things that should have been left to sway. [102]

She pressed her nose into a bundle of dried chamomile as she crossed the swaying bridge to her workshop. [120] Her sense of smell had always been unnervingly acute, olfactorily sensitive to a degree that made marketplaces unbearable and forests feel like symphonies. [141] Up here in Canopis, the air carried stories: resin and rain, moss and the particular sweetness of bark beetles boring into heartwood. [162] She could read the health of every plant within thirty paces by scent alone. [175]

Tonight, though, one smell troubled her. [181] It rose from the sealed clay pot on her worktable — a thick, carrion sweetness, unmistakable and alive. [197] Inside the pot lay a single corpse flower seed, given to her by the village elder, Ohn, who had said only: "When you understand why it blooms, you will understand why you cannot sleep." [231]

Maren had not slept well in months. [238] She had been journalizing obsessively, filling notebook after notebook with observations about growth rates, soil compositions, the pH of rainwater collected at different heights in the canopy. [262] Data, she believed, was the architecture of mastery. [270] If she could quantify serenity, she could cultivate it. [279]

She opened her current journal and began to write, but the words stalled. [292] Instead, she reached for a sheet of wrapping paper left over from a parcel her mother had sent — dried figs, goat cheese, a note that said simply, "Breathe more." [321] Maren turned the paper over to its blank interior and began to doodle. [334]

This was a family custom, passed down through her mother's line: the habit of doodling on wrapping paper interiors, filling the hidden sides with spirals, faces, tiny forests. [362] Her grandmother had called it "thinking with your fingers." [371] As a child, Maren had covered every gift's inner paper with imaginary maps. [383] Now her hand moved without intention, sketching the corpse flower seed, then roots spreading from it, then a figure sitting cross-legged among the roots, eyes closed. [406]

She stopped. [408] The figure looked peaceful in a way Maren did not recognize in herself. [421]

She unsealed the clay pot. [426] The smell hit her like a warm, decaying hand — not unpleasant exactly, but vast, the scent of something that had lived and died and was preparing to live again. [455] Corpse flowers bloomed rarely, and when they did, the stench was legendary. [467] But the seed itself carried only the promise of that future rot, a quiet pulse beneath the surface. [483]

The undercurrent of wisdom, Ohn had once told her, is not what you learn but what you stop resisting. [501]

It was the turning of the tide's thought — that liminal hour when Canopis shifted from waking industry to nocturnal stillness, when even the tree frogs paused before beginning their chorus. [530] Maren held the seed in her palm and breathed. [540] The smell was extraordinary: decay threaded with something green, embryonic, full of motion. [552]

She understood, suddenly, what Ohn meant. [558] The corpse flower did not bloom despite its stench. [567] It bloomed through it. [571] The rot was the invitation, the summons that drew pollinators across miles of jungle. [584] What seemed repulsive was in truth the flower's deepest act of reaching outward. [596]

Maren set the seed into a hanging pot of black soil and covered it gently. [612] She would not monitor its temperature hourly. [620] She would not journalize its progress in obsessive columns. [629] She would let it rot and grow and bloom in its own time, and she would tend it the way the elders tended the bridges — not by forcing the branches, but by listening to the direction they already wanted to bend. [668]

She doodled one last thing on the wrapping paper: the corpse flower in full bloom, enormous and ridiculous and spreading its impossible scent across the treetops. [695] Beneath it she wrote her grandmother's words: "Think with your fingers." [706]

The canopy swayed. [709] Somewhere below, the tide of the world shifted, and Maren shifted with it, breathing in the wildflower hush of a village asleep among the stars. [736]

She closed her eyes and, for the first time in months, did not reach for a pen. [752]
