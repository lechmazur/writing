<story>The amber light that remained after the city-wide blackout was the kind people used to call "nectar dusk" — that thick, honeyed glow pooling along the horizon when every artificial light has gone silent. [35]

Maren sat at her post beside the gate of Lightning Collection Tower Nine, the lacquer box on her knee catching the last of that glow. [58] She had been toll keeper here for eleven years, checking credentials, logging entries, and speaking truths she never intended to speak. [77] The condition had no medical name she trusted. [85] Every doctor called it something different. [91] What mattered was the result: Maren could not lie. [100] Not even small lies. [104] Not even the merciful ones. [109]

The blackout had come three hours ago. [116] The entire grid — towers one through twelve — went dark in sequence, like candles snuffed by a single breath. [133] Now the city below sat in unfamiliar silence, and the only people climbing the ridge road to Tower Nine were engineers and the occasional official who believed shouting would restore electricity. [162]

Tonight it was Petra Solis, Senior Grid Analyst, who arrived breathless at the gate. [174]

"What happened, Maren?" [177]

"The drone beehives failed." [180] The words left her mouth before she could consider softening them. [190]

Petra stopped. [192] "All of them?" [194]

"Every hive across the tower network. [200] The swarms that maintain the conductor arrays, the ones that repair microfractures in the collection spires — they dropped mid-flight. [218] I watched from here. [222] It looked like golden rain." [227]

The drone bees were the city's quiet miracle. [235] Bio-synthetic pollinators repurposed for infrastructure, their hive intelligence woven into the lattice of every lightning tower. [249] They sealed cracks, redistributed charge, kept the massive spires from shattering under the voltage they swallowed from storms. [265] Without them, the towers were just tall metal waiting to break. [275]

Petra leaned against the gate. [280] "Why didn't the backup colonies activate?" [286]

"Because the queen algorithms were housed in a single server, and that server overheated two weeks ago. [301] I filed the report myself. [306] No one read it." [310]

Petra's face tightened. [313] Maren watched her process this — the grief of a systemic failure that was also a bureaucratic one. [329]

"I need access to the hive chamber," Petra said. [337]

Maren nodded and opened her lacquer box. [344] Inside, nestled in velvet, were the tower's access credentials: keycards, codes, and one item that did not belong to any official protocol — a matchbox. [367] Maren lifted it out. [371]

"What is that?" Petra asked. [376]

"Something I give to everyone who enters the tower after dark." [386] Maren slid the matchbox open. [391] Inside, instead of matches, lay a slip of paper with a handwritten riddle: *What is caught but never held, spent but never saved, and returns only when you stop reaching?* [419]

Petra stared. [421] "You're joking." [423]

"I am constitutionally incapable of joking without meaning it," Maren said, which was itself the truest thing she had spoken all evening. [444] "I started doing this four years ago. [451] Everyone who climbs this ridge is exhausted or furious or afraid. [461] The riddle slows them down. [466] Makes them wonder about something that has no operational urgency. [475] I change it every week." [479]

"Why?" [480]

Maren looked out at the dark city, the nectar-dusk horizon fading to plum. [492] "Because routine devours people. [496] I check badges eight hours a day. [502] If I don't plant one strange, unanswerable thing in the middle of it, I forget that any of this — the towers, the lightning, the bees — is extraordinary. [528] And so does everyone else." [533]

Petra looked at the riddle again. [539] She mouthed the words silently. [544] Then she pocketed it, took the keycard, and walked toward the tower door. [556] She paused. [558]

"Lightning," she said. [561] "The answer is lightning." [565]

Maren smiled but said nothing — which, for a woman who could not stop telling the truth, was its own kind of reveal. [585] The answer was not lightning. [590] The answer was wonder itself, the thing you only find when you stop grasping for it. [605] But Petra would figure that out on her own, somewhere inside the dark tower, surrounded by the silence of ten thousand fallen bees, working to bring back the light the city had learned to take for granted. [639]

The last stripe of amber sank below the hills. [648] Maren closed the lacquer box, set a new riddle in her mind for tomorrow, and waited for the next person brave enough to climb. [671]
