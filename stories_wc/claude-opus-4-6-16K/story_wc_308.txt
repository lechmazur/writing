The canyon had no name that anyone still living could speak, but the harmonic stone skimmer called it the Throat. [20]

She had walked its floor for eleven days before she stopped walking altogether. [33] That was the point. [37] That was always the point. [42] To learn to navigate without moving — to become so still that the world revealed its architecture around her, layer by ancient layer, through centuries of layered dust that had settled on the towers of bone rising from the canyon floor like the fingers of something vast and buried. [85]

The towers were real bone. [90] Whale bone, some said. [94] Others claimed they were the ribs of creatures that had no modern name, stacked and fused by mineral patience into pale columns that caught every sound and held it. [122] The canyon's walls were narrow enough that a shout could return to you nine times, each echo slightly altered, slightly aged. [141] Some echoes, it was said, had been traveling since before the towers were built — sounds so old they had outlived their source, their meaning, their world. [167]

A pulse left wandering. [171]

That was what she had come to find. [178] Not a heartbeat exactly, but an intentional signal, cast into the canyon by the civilization that had erected the bone towers as acoustic instruments. [202] They had been navigators of a different kind — historically reverent people who believed that understanding the shape of the past was the only way to move through the future. [233] They did not sail or ride. [239] They listened. [241] They sent pulses of sound into the Throat and read what returned: distance, direction, the quality of stone and sky. [260] The pulse she sought had been sent centuries ago and never recalled. [271] It still wandered the canyon, degraded and splintered but alive, bouncing between bone and rock in patterns too complex for casual ears. [293]

She sat cross-legged on a flat stone, the dust of centuries pressing soft beneath her. [308] In her palm she held a stone arrowhead — not a weapon, but a tuning fork of sorts, chipped from the same mineral as the canyon walls. [333] When she held it to the bone of the nearest tower and struck it gently, it sang at a frequency that made her teeth ache and her vision swim. [361] The arrowhead was her instrument, her anchor. [368] It had been carried by the navigators who came before, and she treated it with the reverence it demanded. [385]

She struck it again. [389] Listened. [390] The echo came back wrong — fragmented, layered with interference. [399] Somewhere in that tangle was the wandering pulse, but she could not isolate it by sound alone. [415]

So she watched the birds. [420]

A flock of pale swifts nested in the upper reaches of the bone towers, and they were sensitive to frequencies far beyond human hearing. [443] When she struck the arrowhead, the birds erupted from their roosts in patterns that mapped the invisible. [458] She had learned to appraise the pulse through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight — their sudden turns, their clustering and dispersal, the way they avoided certain columns of air as though the sound itself were solid. [497] Each murmuration was a diagram. [502] Each flight path was a sentence written in a language older than speech. [514]

For weeks she struck and watched. [520] Struck and watched. [523] The dust settled on her shoulders. [529] Her stillness became so complete that the swifts began to land on her, mistaking her for stone. [545]

And slowly, the pattern resolved. [550] The wandering pulse was not lost. [556] It was spiraling — a long, slow orbit through the canyon, touching each bone tower in sequence, retracing the navigational map the ancient ones had encoded in the architecture itself. [586] She did not need to chase it. [592] She needed only to sit at the right tower at the right moment and let it arrive. [607]

On the forty-third day, it came. [613] A vibration so faint it was less than a whisper, more than silence. [625] The arrowhead trembled in her open hand. [632] The swifts lifted in a perfect ring, a compass rose drawn in feathers and flight. [647]

She closed her eyes and felt the canyon unfold inside her — every wall, every tower, every passage — as clearly as if she had walked each one. [673] She had not moved in weeks, and she knew the shape of everything. [685]

The pulse passed through her and continued on its ancient way. [695] She let it go. [699] Some things were not meant to be caught, only understood. [709]

She opened her eyes to the bone towers and the echoing dust, and she was exactly where she needed to be. [728]
