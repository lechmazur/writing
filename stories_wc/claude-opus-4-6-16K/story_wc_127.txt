The amber grotto held the last of the dusk like a jar holds honey, slow and golden and reluctant to release. [22]

Maren knelt at the center of the cavern where fossilized resin formed walls that glowed from within, each surface trapping light the way her vials trapped feeling. [47] She was, by trade and reputation, a counterfeit emotion dealer — the best in the coastal territories, professionally thorough in ways her competitors could never match. [70] Where others sold crude synthetics that burned through a buyer's nervous system in hours, Maren's product lingered, settled, became nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. [92] Nearly. [93] That word had haunted her for eleven years. [100]

She arranged her tools on the stone shelf before her: the copper condensers, the amber-stemmed pipettes, the row of glass vials containing isolated emotions she'd harvested from willing donors over the past month. [130] Grief aged six days. [134] Joy cut with nostalgia. [138] A clean, almost surgical loneliness. [143] And at the center of the arrangement, a single fragrance chemist's blotter petal — a teardrop-shaped piece of absorbent paper used to test scent compositions, given to her by the woman who had once tried to teach her that true feeling could not be manufactured. [181]

Lida had been wrong about that, but right about everything else. [192]

Maren lifted the blotter petal and held it between her fingertips. [203] It still carried the faintest trace of bergamot and cedar, Lida's signature accord, though Lida herself had been dead three years. [224] The petal was the last object that held her residue, and tonight Maren intended to use it — not to counterfeit Lida's emotions, but to subsume them entirely, to take them into herself so completely that the boundary between Maren's feelings and Lida's would dissolve. [267]

This was the transformation she had spent a decade preparing for. [278] Not a sale. [281] Not a product. [284] A fusion. [286]

She pressed her palm flat against the amber wall and closed her eyes, sensing through static electricity the way she always did — the faint charge that living stone carried at dusk, when temperature differentials made the fossilized resin crackle with tiny, invisible sparks. [323] The static moved through her fingers, up her wrist, translating the grotto's ancient memory into something her trained nerves could read. [342] Amber remembered. [344] It was the world's oldest recording medium, and Maren had learned long ago to listen. [358]

She dipped the blotter petal into the vial of grief and watched the liquid climb its fibers. [374] Then she touched it to her tongue. [381]

The grief was real — harvested, not synthesized — but it was not Lida's grief. [394] It was a half truth, which was all that counterfeit emotion ever was: the correct chemical signature wrapped around the wrong history. [414] Every vial she'd ever sold contained half truths, feelings that were biochemically authentic but experientially hollow. [429] Buyers didn't mind. [432] They wanted the sensation, not the story. [439]

But Maren wanted both. [443] Her motivation had crystallized the night Lida died, when she'd realized that all her professional thoroughness — the precision distillation, the perfect molecular mimicry — had never once allowed her to truly understand what another person felt. [475] She had insight without empathy, knowledge without communion. [483] To fuse insight with empathy: that was the only transformation worth completing. [493]

The static intensified against her palm. [499] Amber light pulsed. [502] As the transformation completed, Maren felt the counterfeit grief in her mouth begin to change, the blotter petal dissolving against her tongue and releasing not just bergamot and cedar but something beneath — Lida's actual residue, the emotional fingerprint preserved in organic matter the way a mosquito is preserved in resin. [547]

It hit her like weather. [552] Not the clean, surgical loneliness she'd bottled, but Lida's specific loneliness: the shape of it, the texture, the way it wrapped around a particular Tuesday afternoon when Lida had stood at her perfume organ and realized no one would smell what she'd created and understand what she meant by it. [598]

Maren wept. [600] Not from sadness alone, but from recognition — the shock of finally holding a whole truth after years of trafficking in halves. [618] The amber walls pulsed around her with an affectionate detachment, ancient witnesses to yet another small creature trying to feel something real inside their golden architecture. [643]

She sat with it. [647] She did not bottle it. [652] She did not label it or calculate its market value or measure its half-life. [665] She let Lida's loneliness exist inside her alongside her own, two frequencies finding harmony rather than cancellation. [681]

When she finally opened her eyes, the grotto had gone dark except for its own deep glow. [697] The blotter petal was gone, fully dissolved against her tongue, its message delivered and received. [712] Maren packed her tools with steady hands, professionally thorough as ever, but the vials she sealed now carried a different weight. [732]

She would still deal in counterfeit emotions. [739] People needed what she sold, even if it was incomplete. [749] But she would never again mistake the half for the whole. [760] She carried the whole thing now, Lida's and her own, fused and irreversible, and the amber grotto watched her leave with the tender indifference of something that had seen ten thousand transformations and loved none of them less for their impermanence.

I notice my final count reached 800, which exceeds the limit. Let me revise:
