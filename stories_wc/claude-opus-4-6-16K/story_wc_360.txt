The topaz workshop had no roof, only the sky, and the sky was losing its stars one by one. [20]

Maren noticed this the way she noticed everything — through the borrowed lens of someone else's attention. [36] Tonight she wore the personality of a shipwright's widow, a woman she'd met once at a funeral, because grief sharpened perception in ways joy never could. [59] The widow's sorrow sat behind Maren's eyes like a second pair of hands on the letterpress, guiding her fingers toward truths she couldn't reach alone. [83]

She was a cryptic letterpress operator by trade, though "trade" implied something transactional, and what Maren did was closer to surgery. [103] Each night she arranged lead type into configurations that read differently depending on the angle, the light, the reader's heartbeat. [121] Her broadsheets circulated through the mining district like rumors — half-understood, wholly felt, impossible to paraphrase. [136] She designed them that way. [140] Deliberate ambiguity was not evasion; it was architecture. [148] She built corridors in language where meaning could turn corners and meet itself coming back. [163]

The workshop floor was cut topaz, amber and orange, quarried from the mesa beneath. [177] When starlight struck the stone at the proper angle, the floor became a lens, projecting faint prismatic equations onto the walls. [197] Maren had spent eleven years studying those projections, convinced they encoded the mathematics of emotion — that feeling was not chaos but a calculable waveform, and that somewhere in the interference patterns between gratitude and terror lay a formula she could set in type. [237]

But the stars were vanishing. [242]

Not burning out — vanishing, as if someone were erasing them from a ledger. [255] Between each disappearance, the remaining light shifted, and the equations on the walls changed. [269] She was running out of data. [275]

On the press bed lay the halo fragment. [283] She'd found it three weeks ago in the tailings pile outside the topaz mine, a curved shard of iridescent metal that hummed at a frequency just below hearing. [310] It was warm regardless of temperature. [316] When she held it, she experienced something she'd never managed through her habitual borrowing of personalities: she felt what another person felt without becoming them. [340] Transposed empathy — emotion relocated, not replicated. [347] The widow's grief, when filtered through the fragment, became a geometric shape she could almost name. [362]

She set the fragment on the composing stone beside her type case. [374] Tonight's broadsheet would be her most disorienting yet. [383] She wanted to transpose the vanishing of the stars into a feeling readers would carry without understanding, the way a melody follows you down a street. [407] She needed the mathematics to be felt, not solved. [417]

Her fingers moved through the type case — selecting letters, reversing some, inverting others. [430] She composed a paragraph that could be read as elegy or instruction manual depending on which eye you closed. [448] The halo fragment pulsed as she worked, and the remaining stars above the open workshop seemed to lean closer, as if curious. [469]

Another star vanished. [472] The prismatic equations on the walls lurched, rearranging. [480] Maren dropped the widow's personality like a coat and reached, instinctively, for someone new. [493] She found the shipwright himself — the dead husband — and for a moment she knew what it was to build something meant to hold against water, against time, against the insistent mathematics of collapse. [522]

She understood then. [525] The stars weren't vanishing randomly. [530] They were being subtracted according to the same waveform she'd been chasing — the formula that described how loss compounds, how each absence reshapes every remaining presence. [553] The sky was solving for grief. [559]

She locked the type into the chase, inked the press, and pulled the lever. [573] The broadsheet emerged warm and strange, its words sliding between meanings like light through cut stone. [588] Anyone who read it would feel momentarily disoriented, uncertain whether they were remembering something or anticipating it. [603] That uncertainty was the point. [608] Empathy required not knowing, required the willingness to stand in a doorway between your pain and someone else's and refuse to choose a room. [632]

Maren hung the broadsheet on the drying line strung between two topaz pillars. [645] Above her, another star disappeared. [650] The halo fragment went cold for the first time. [659] She picked it up and held it against her sternum, feeling the transposed ache of a sky losing its own light, and she thought: this is the equation. [689] Not numbers. [691] Not symbols. [693] Just the precise, turbulent, unbearable clarity of feeling what the universe feels when it subtracts something it loved. [710]

She set the fragment in the type case, nestled among the letters, where it belonged. [725] Tomorrow she would compose again. [730] Tonight she stood in her roofless workshop and watched the remaining stars, counting not their light but the spaces between them, learning the mathematics of what remains. [758]
