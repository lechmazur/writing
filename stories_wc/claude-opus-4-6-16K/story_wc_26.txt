The library bloomed at the edge of the stratosphere, its shelves flowering outward like petals of a lotus made from glass and reclaimed wood. [26] Lira had climbed here every evening for eleven years, ascending the spiral column that threaded through the cloudbank, because she was the last person alive who noticed what dusk did to shadows. [55]

She was sharp-eyed about it, the way light retreated. [64] Others watched sunrises. [67] Others shared their dreams on the Loom, broadcasting sleep-visions to millions since the technology had made inner life public and collective. [84] But Lira watched endings. [88] She watched the moment a shadow detached from the object that cast it, the instant before full dark, when silhouettes became autonomous and drifted like smoke. [110]

She called this phenomenon the unbinding. [116]

No one else seemed to care. [122] After dreams became shareable, people gorged on each other's sleeping fantasies, on landscapes invented by strangers' subconscious minds. [138] The waking world dimmed by comparison. [144] Libraries emptied, then floated upward, untethered by neglect, rising on thermal currents until they settled above the clouds where the air was thin and the light was merciless. [170] This one, the Varuna, had rooted itself at forty thousand feet, its shelves now overgrown with alpine mosses and pale flowers that fed on UV radiation. [195] Books still lined the walls, their pages softly deliberate in the way they turned under the perpetual wind, as though the library itself were reading its own collection, slowly, with care. [225]

Lira came for the archive room. [231]

Inside, a projector cast silent video footage onto a curved wall of cloud-glass. [244] She had spent years collecting clips, mundane recordings spanning decades: a courtyard in Kyoto filmed in 2009, then the same courtyard captured in 2043. [268] A bus stop in Lagos, 2017 and 2051. [276] A river in Montana, 2001 and 2048. [283] She played them side by side, muted, and compared. [292]

By comparing silent video footage from decades apart, she had mapped something no algorithm detected. [306] Shadows were migrating. [309] In every pairing, the silhouettes had shifted in ways that bore no relation to architectural changes or solar angles. [326] They moved as if alive, sliding incrementally away from their sources, straining toward some horizon only they perceived. [342]

The shadows were unbinding. [346]

She held a river stone in her left hand, smooth and gray, pulled from the Montana footage's real-world location before the river dried. [369] It was her anchor, her proof that physical things still mattered. [380] She pressed her thumb into its coolest depression and felt the weight of something that had never been a dream, never been shared, never been projected into another mind's theater. [407]

Her motivation was not academic. [412] She wanted to preserve the shape of hope, and hope, she believed, was cast like a shadow: it extended from a person toward the future, long in the morning of life, compressed at noon, then stretching again as evening approached. [447] If shadows could unbind, so could hope. [454] It could detach from the dreamer entirely and wander off into collective sleep, diluted, belonging to everyone and therefore no one. [472]

She had watched it happen to her daughter. [480] Maren had been twelve when dream-sharing launched, and by sixteen her ambitions, her private yearnings, had metamorphosed into public content, consumed and commented on and liked into shapelessness. [506] Maren stopped wanting things for herself. [512] Her hope unbound, became everyone's gentle background noise. [520]

Lira pressed play on the latest pairing: a park bench in Berlin, 2012 and last Tuesday. [536] In the older footage, a child's shadow fell across the bench like a draped cloth. [551] In the new footage, the bench sat in open daylight, no obstruction overhead, yet a faint silhouette lingered on its surface, orphaned, sourceless. [573]

She recorded her observations in longhand, ink on paper, in a blooming library no one else visited. [590] The flowers around her glowed faintly as the sun descended beyond the cloud floor, casting the archive room in shades of amber and violet. [614] Luminous regret filled the space between her ribs, bright as the altitude, heavy as the stone in her hand. [634]

She could not share this as a dream. [642] That would be the very erosion she was fighting. [651] Instead, she would leave the notebooks here, physical and patient, for whoever climbed this high again. [667]

Outside, dusk arrived. [670] She watched a shadow slip free from the library's eastern wall and float upward into thinning atmosphere, no longer tethered to glass or wood or moss. [694] It rose like something released from a long obligation. [703]

Lira held the river stone tighter and wrote one final sentence in the evening's log: The shadow is unbound, but I am not. [725]

Then she closed the notebook, softly, deliberately, and watched the last of the light become something she could not share and did not want to. [751]
