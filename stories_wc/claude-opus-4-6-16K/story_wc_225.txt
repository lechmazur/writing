The village of Asthen had not moved in seven years. [10]

Rain hung suspended in the air like glass beads, each droplet a tiny lens through which Maret could see the frozen faces of people she had once known. [39] Children mid-leap, a baker's flour cloud arrested in bloom, a dog's bark crystallized into silence -- all of it held in the amber of stopped time. [63] Only Maret walked among them, exiled and alive, her fingers perpetually working the edges of her coat, folding and unfolding the fabric into precise, meditative creases. [87]

She had been a chess tutor before the stillness came, the finest in the northern provinces, and her hands still remembered the restless intelligence of positioning pieces. [112] Now she fidgeted productively, her fingers never idle, always shaping something -- a knot, a fold, a pattern -- as though movement itself could atone for what she had done. [140]

What she had done was teach Prince Edric the Seventh Gambit. [151]

The Seventh Gambit was not merely a chess strategy. [160] It was an ancient sequence that, when played on the platinum labyrinth board housed in Asthen's chapel, could bend temporal law. [179] She had known this, or should have known, and she had taught the boy anyway because he was brilliant and she was proud. [201] Edric, thirteen and reckless, had played the sequence alone one night, and the board had answered. [217] Time seized. [219] The village froze. [222] The prince himself became a statue mid-move, his hand reaching for a platinum knight, his mouth open in wonder that would never close. [244]

Maret alone had been spared, standing outside the chapel's radius, returning from an evening walk. [258] The royal court had exiled her within the week. [267] She was to remain in Asthen until she undid what her teaching had wrought. [281]

Seven years of solitude among the still. [288]

Now, during the lull of distant thunder -- for the storms circled Asthen endlessly but never arrived, trapped in their own kind of frozen approach -- Maret knelt before the great tapestry in the chapel's nave. [322] The tapestry depicted the platinum labyrinth from above, its winding corridors stitched in silver thread against midnight wool. [340] For years she had studied the board itself, the frozen pieces, the prince's unfinished move. [354] But the answer was not on the board. [361]

The answer was in the border. [367]

The tapestry's edges had frayed over centuries, threads loosening from the weave in patterns she had initially dismissed as decay. [387] But decay did not organize itself into notation. [395] The frayed threads were a language, each broken strand a symbol in a system older than chess itself. [412] By decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border, she had begun to winnow truth from ornament, separating the essential sequence from the decorative noise surrounding it. [440]

Her fingers worked the border now, tracing the loose filaments, cataloging their positions. [453] Pull, read, release. [456] Pull, read, release. [459] The rhythm was a woven hush, a silence made textured and deliberate, the quiet not of absence but of concentrated attention so fierce it consumed all sound. [484] In that hush, she could almost hear the village breathing beneath its stillness. [496]

Thread by thread, the counter-sequence emerged. [502] Not the Seventh Gambit reversed -- she had tried that in year two, and nothing had stirred -- but something complementary, a resolution the original gambit demanded like a chord demanding its tonic. [531]

She reached the final thread. [536] It was platinum, impossibly fine, woven into the border's lowest corner and half-dissolved with age. [552] She decoded its position: the knight to the fourth corridor. [562]

Maret rose and approached the frozen prince. [569] She placed her hand over his on the platinum knight and guided it to the square the tapestry prescribed. [586] The metal was warm despite seven years of stillness. [595]

The board rang like a bell. [601]

Around her, rain resumed its falling. [607] The baker's flour settled. [611] The dog completed its bark, sharp and joyful. [619] Children landed from their leaps and stumbled, laughing, unaware that anything had happened. [631]

Prince Edric blinked, looked up at her, and said, "Did I win?" [643]

Maret's hands trembled, then stilled -- truly stilled, for the first time in seven years. [658] She looked at the boy who had only been brilliant and young, and she understood that the tapestry's final lesson was not the counter-sequence at all. [683] It was the patience required to find it, the years of sitting with her failure without letting it destroy her, the slow and brutal grace of forgiving herself for having been proud and human and wrong. [716]

"No," she told him softly, folding his fingers closed around the knight. [728] "But neither did you lose." [733]

Outside, the thunder finally broke over Asthen, and the rain fell honest and warm and free. [749]
