The elevator groaned upward through the icebound spire, and Maren counted the floors by the changing quality of light that pressed through the crystalline walls. [28]

She had been a servant here for eleven years, scrubbing frost from the observation decks, carrying meals to astronomers who barely noticed her hands setting down their plates. [55] But three weeks ago, old Director Halse had died in his sleep on the ninth floor, and someone needed to inventory his quarters, and no one of rank wanted the melancholy work. [86] So Maren ascended. [89] That was how it always went: she rose by accepting what others refused. [101]

The elevator passed the second floor, its cables singing against the ice. [113] In her coat pocket, she felt the weight of what she'd found yesterday while clearing Halse's desk — a leather-bound diary, every page filled with script that looked like language but resolved into nothing readable. [147] Encrypted, she realized, by a man who had spent forty years studying codes in starlight. [163] Beside the diary, wrapped in cloth, she'd discovered a pair of airship captain's goggles, the leather cracked, the lenses tinted amber. [182] They seemed to belong to a different life than the one Halse had lived in this frozen tower. [199]

Third floor. [201] Fourth. [202] Maren held the goggles up and, on instinct, looked through them at the light fracturing through the spire's icy walls. [222] The amber lenses transformed the scattered light into something warmer, and she noticed — with the quiet thrill she always felt when pieces connected — that the refracted beams picked out certain ink strokes on the diary's pages more brightly than others. [260] She unfolded the diary to a random page and held it in the light, peering through the goggles. [278] Letters emerged from the chaos. [283]

Fifth floor. [285] She read, her lips moving. [290]

"Today I remembered Ulla's voice when she laughed at the rain. I have not allowed myself this memory for six years. The anguish of losing her is a locked room, but I find now that inside the locked room there is a window, and through the window I can see her laughing, and the rain, and the joy that was always underneath." [345]

Maren's breath caught. [348] She turned pages carefully, holding each one in the shifting light as the elevator climbed. [363] The scattered prismatic beams moved across the paper like searching fingers, and wherever the amber lenses focused, hidden words surfaced. [382]

Sixth floor. [384] Seventh. [385]

Halse wrote about his years as an airship captain before the spire, about the woman he had loved and lost to a storm over the Kessler Straits. [411] He wrote about choosing isolation, choosing ice, choosing work that demanded nothing of his heart. [425] And then, in entries dated years later, he wrote about Maren. [436]

"The servant girl asked me today why the southern constellations shift in winter. She asks everything with such warmth, such genuine curiosity, as though the world owes her answers and she expects it to pay gladly. I told her about precession. She listened the way Ulla used to listen — not to be polite, but because knowing things was a form of love for her." [495]

Eighth floor. [497] Maren wiped her eyes with her sleeve. [504]

"I think Maren is the reason I have begun to unseal the locked room. Her questions are small keys. She does not know this. She will likely never know." [535]

But she knew now. [539] Ninth floor, and the elevator shuddered past the quarters where he had died peacefully, his encrypted diary waiting for the one person who would be curious enough and careful enough to unfold its secrets through scattered light and old amber lenses. [577]

He had sought the joy beneath his anguish, and he had found it, and he had hidden the evidence in a code that required his captain's goggles to read — goggles from the life he'd shared with Ulla. [613] As though only by looking through the lens of that old love could anyone decipher what the new, quieter love had meant. [637]

Tenth floor. [639] The elevator stopped. [642] Maren stepped out into blinding white where the spire broke through the cloud ceiling and sunlight struck the ice in every direction. [664] She tucked the diary inside her coat, close against her ribs where it could feel her heartbeat if diaries could feel anything at all. [689] She placed the goggles over her eyes. [696] The world turned amber and warm. [702]

She had floors to climb still — there were always more floors — but she understood now that ascending was not merely about accepting what others refused. [727] It was about carrying what others could not bear to carry, and finding, in the weight of it, something that felt less like burden and more like being chosen. [757]

The clouds stretched below her like a second earth, soft and silent, and Maren began her work. [773]
