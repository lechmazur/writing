The hot springs still steamed where the volcano had torn the valley open, and Grandmother Sable still came to them every morning, as she had before the eruption, before the war, before the reconstruction crews arrived with their prefabricated temples and standardized prayers. [46]

She lowered herself into the mineral pool, her scarred knees disappearing beneath water the color of oxidized copper. [62] The reconstruction committee had declared these springs sacred again — but sacred according to their own revised liturgy, not the old ways Sable had carried in her bones for seventy-three years. [89] They wanted tradition without its teeth. [95] She wanted to evolve tradition with intent, to let it grow like the thermophilic moss that crept along the pool's edges, adapting to impossible heat rather than pretending the heat didn't exist. [124]

The moss whispered to her now. [130] It had started six months ago, after she'd breathed the volcanic gases during the evacuation — an accidental rewiring of something deep in her temporal lobe. [153] She couldn't hear words exactly, but she felt the moss's chemical urgency, the ferns' slow photosynthetic satisfaction, the lichen's patient hunger against stone. [174] She was accidentally telepathic with plants, and she had told no one, because they already called her insurgent enough. [192]

Insurgent grandmother, the reconstruction council's minutes read. [199] Disruptive to standardized cultural recovery. [204] She had disrupted their first ceremony by pointing out they'd printed the invocations backward. [217] She had disrupted their second by bringing her own offerings — sulfur flowers and volcanic glass — instead of the approved imported incense. [237] The council wanted her silence. [242] She wanted their attention. [246]

This morning, the ferns along the northern pool were agitated. [256] Their fronds curled with something beyond wind or temperature — a distress signal, Sable understood, originating from something buried beneath them. [274] She waded to the edge and dug her fingers into the hot soil. [287]

What she found made her breath stop. [294]

An embryo in amber — small enough to cup in both palms, ancient beyond estimation. [308] The resin was volcanic in origin, dark gold with veins of black, and inside it a curled form that was not quite reptilian, not quite avian, not quite anything the reconstruction committee's biologists would recognize. [343] The old songs mentioned such things. [349] Destiny seeds, her own grandmother had called them — organisms preserved at the moment before becoming, suspended in pure potential. [367] The old tradition held that each generation's purpose was implanted within such seeds, that destiny was not chosen but unsealed when the time was right. [392]

Implanted destiny. [394] Sable had always wrestled with the concept. [401] Her grandmother had believed it literally; Sable believed it as metaphor, as a culture's way of saying that purpose existed before you found the courage to claim it. [428] Either way, the amber was warm and humming against her palms, and the ferns were bending toward it like congregants. [448]

She noticed the markings then — not on the amber itself but scratched into a flat stone beneath where it had been buried, partially covered by mud. [473] She cleaned the stone and frowned. [480] The script was familiar but incomplete, matching symbols she'd seen only once before: on the tail of an abandoned kite she'd found tangled in the steam vents three weeks ago. [508] She had kept the kite's fabric, puzzled by its cryptic script, assuming it was a child's game. [526]

Now she understood it was a key. [533]

She returned to her hut, spread the kite tail beside the stone, and began working. [548] By decoding a cryptic script on the tail of an abandoned kite against the stone's matching glyphs, she reconstructed a complete invocation — the unsealing words that the old tradition prescribed for opening a destiny seed. [583] The language was older than anything the reconstruction committee had catalogued. [593] It was the tradition they thought they were preserving, raw and undomesticated. [604]

At dusk, she returned to the hot springs. [612] She held the amber over the water and spoke the invocation aloud. [624] The amber cracked along its volcanic veins. [631] She did not unseal it with force but with recognition — the words were permission, not command. [646]

The embryo inside did not emerge as a creature. [655] It dissolved into the mineral water, and the springs changed color, deepening to a luminous amber gold. [671] The moss sang. [674] The ferns uncoiled toward the sky. [680] Every plant within the valley shuddered with something Sable could only describe as remembering. [693]

The reconstruction crews would arrive tomorrow and find their standardized springs transformed. [704] They would demand explanations. [708] Sable would give them one: tradition is not a museum exhibit. [718] It is an embryo. [722] It must be allowed to hatch. [728]

She sat in the golden water, insurgent and ancient and new, listening to the moss compose hymns no committee would ever approve. [750]
