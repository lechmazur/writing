The mist came in low that night, threading through the open walls of the workshop like something alive, and Maren sat beneath the stars with a chameleon's severed tail tip resting in her palm. [36]

She had found it on the terrarium floor three hours after the truth came out. [50] Three hours after she learned that the man she'd trusted — the conservationist, the fundraiser, the voice on every podcast championing endangered species — had been funneling donations into shell accounts for years. [79] She had been his gentle face, the wildlife handler they put in front of cameras because her quietness read as sincerity, because she actually was sincere. [102] And now the cameras wanted her again, but for different reasons. [113]

The workshop was hers, at least. [119] A converted greenhouse on a hillside outside the city, open to the sky where panes had long since cracked away, workbenches cluttered with feeding syringes and heat lamps and jars of calcium powder. [149] Mist pooled on every surface, and the stars above were quietly vivid, burning through the haze in colors that seemed too saturated for reality. [173] She could hear the chameleons shifting in their enclosures, the soft rasp of scaled feet on bark. [189]

The tail tip was dry now, curled slightly, no longer capable of the regeneration it might have managed if still attached. [209] Veiled chameleons didn't truly regenerate tails — that was another thing people got wrong, another small lie in the ecosystem of larger lies she'd inhabited. [235] She turned it between her fingers. [241] It had broken off during the chaos of the raid, when officers came through the facility and an animal she'd raised from a hatchling thrashed in a stranger's grip. [268]

Maren set the tail tip on the workbench beside a notebook full of her own handwriting — care schedules, behavioral notes, sketches of color patterns she'd observed over months. [296] That record was real. [300] She opened the notebook and began, slowly, to reconstruct what she knew from what she'd been told. [316]

This was the work now: separating truth from performance, by shedding layers of narrative that Dominic had built around her. [335] He had called her indispensable. [340] He had said the animals needed her too much for her to ask hard questions about the books. [355] And she had believed him, because her convictions about the work — about the inherent worth of these small, strange creatures — had felt so solid that she mistook the ground beneath them for bedrock when it was only stage dressing. [393]

Fragile convictions, she thought. [397] Not because the love was fragile, but because she had let someone else hold the frame around it. [414]

She turned to the terrarium where Oskar, the veiled chameleon, sat motionless on his branch. [429] His colors were muted in the dark, a dusty sage that pulsed faintly with each slow breath. [445] He watched her with one turret eye, the other aimed somewhere into the mist. [459] She had always admired that about chameleons — the ability to look in two directions at once, to hold contradictions in a single gaze. [480]

She needed that now. [484] The reporters wanted her to denounce Dominic completely, to perform outrage, and part of her was outraged. [500] But part of her also remembered him kneeling in mud at two in the morning, warming a hypothermic gecko against his chest, weeping because he thought it would die. [527] That had been real too. [532] To balance self-respect and compassion meant refusing to flatten either truth into something simpler. [545]

She picked up the tail tip again and placed it carefully between two pages of the notebook, pressing them closed. [563] A bookmark, she decided. [567] A reminder of what breaks when careful hands are absent. [577]

The mist thickened. [580] The stars burned on above it, indifferent and ancient, and the workshop held its shimmering stillness like a breath between sentences. [598] Maren closed her eyes and let the silence do its work on her, dissolving the outermost layer of shame, then the layer of anger beneath it, then the brittle shell of certainty she had carried for years. [634]

What remained, when she opened her eyes, was small and unadorned: she loved the animals, she had been deceived, and she would continue. [658] Not as the face of someone else's mission, but as herself — a woman in a misty workshop under stars, holding what was broken, deciding what to build. [688]

Oskar shifted on his branch, and for a moment his skin flushed a green so deep it looked like something dreamed. [710] Maren watched, and the color held, and she began to write. [722]
