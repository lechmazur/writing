Maren had always gardened the way a locksmith's daughter would - measuring twice, cutting once, understanding that every mechanism had its season. [21] Her fire escape hung five stories above the harbor like a balcony stolen from a cathedral, and she filled it with life: basil in coffee cans, morning glories threading through the railings, and one ancient rosebush in a cracked terra-cotta pot that had survived eleven winters. [67] She was wistfully pragmatic about the arrangement. [74] She knew the fire escape wasn't hers, not really - the landlord tolerated it, the fire marshal would not - but she also knew that certain kinds of beauty justified certain kinds of risk. [106]

The rosebush had been failing since October. [113] Tonight, under a moon so full it turned the harbor luminous, she watched the final petal release. [130] It dropped without ceremony, a dark curl falling past the iron grating and into the alley below. [147] A quivering hush settled over everything - the water, the distant boats, even the wind - as though the world recognized that something small and irreplaceable had ended. [173]

After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, you learn what you've been holding onto. [189]

Maren reached into the pocket of her canvas apron and turned the lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth between her fingers. [208] It was a slender piece of steel, notched at precise intervals, that her father had used for decades to measure the cuts in keys. [232] He'd been the harbor district's only locksmith, a man who believed every locked door was a problem waiting to be solved with patience. [255] When he died, she'd kept very little - the gauge tooth, his reading glasses, a habit of studying the architecture of things that open and close. [280]

She used the gauge tooth now the way she used everything he'd left her: practically, tenderly. [296] It scored drainage holes in aluminum cans. [303] It tested soil depth. [307] It pried open seed packets when her fingers were too cold. [318] Tonight she used it to scrape the last of the dead roots from the rosebush's pot, working with the rhythm of oars in water - pull, lift, return - steady and ancient and meditative. [350]

The harbor below was mercury and glass. [357] Moonlight lay across it in sheets, and the moored boats rocked gently, their mast-lights swaying. [372] Maren had chosen this apartment for one reason: the fire escape faced east and south, catching morning sun and, on nights like this, catching the moon's reflection off the water. [402] Light poured upward from the harbor into the narrow alleys and airshafts that never saw the sun. [419]

That had always been her motivation, if she was honest. [429] Not just to grow things, but to reflect light into dark corners. [441] The alley below her fire escape was a place where needles collected and shadows pooled. [456] She'd hung small mirrors among her planters, angled them to bounce harbor-light downward. [469] She'd chosen white and silver flowers - moonflowers, dusty miller, lamb's ear - that caught and held whatever glow the sky offered. [489] People walked through that alley differently now. [496] They looked up. [499]

She wanted to instill that reflex in them. [507] The looking up. [510] The noticing. [512]

She filled the cleaned pot with fresh soil, tamping it down with the flat of the gauge tooth. [530] From a paper bag beside her she withdrew a cutting she'd taken from the botanical garden - not entirely legally, wistfully pragmatic as ever - a small slip of jasmine that would bloom white in summer and scent the whole block. [569]

The quivering hush still held. [574] The harbor gleamed. [577] Somewhere a rowboat moved between the moored vessels, its oars dipping and rising, and Maren matched her planting to its tempo without thinking: hollow, press, cover, smooth. [604] She nestled the jasmine cutting into the soil and watered it from a repurposed milk jug, feeling the old familiar tension between knowing something might not survive and planting it anyway. [635]

That was the whole of her, really. [642] She armored herself in routine and preparation, in drainage holes and proper soil pH, but every seed she pressed into dirt was an act of faith so naked it embarrassed her. [673]

The moon climbed. [676] The rowboat vanished around the breakwater. [682] Maren sat back on her heels, the gauge tooth warm in her palm, and watched the new cutting tremble once in a breath of wind off the water, then hold still. [713] It would grow, or it wouldn't. [719] She would be here either way, five stories up, tending what light she could. [733]
