Maren had tasted forty-seven silences before she found the one that mattered. [13]

Her father built bunkers for a living — concrete wombs sunk deep where no sound could follow. [16] He called them sanctuaries. [20] She called them throats. [24] Every wall pressed inward. [28] Every ceiling lowered when she wasn't looking. [35] She was the bunker builder's claustrophobic child, and the irony was not lost on her, though it had long stopped being funny. [56]

She coped by limiting exposure. [61] Ten minutes in the deepest chamber, then up. [69] Twenty in the mid-level corridor, then out to the yard where the sky at least pretended to be infinite. [86] Her father thought she was being dramatic. [93] She thought he was being buried alive and calling it a career. [104]

The tiny porcelain doll had been her mother's — a pale figurine no larger than a thumb, with a painted smile that never wavered. [126] Maren kept it in her breast pocket, over her sternum, where she could feel its slight weight like a second heartbeat. [145] When the walls contracted, she'd press her palm against it and breathe. [157] The doll was her anchor to someone who'd understood open spaces. [168]

What Maren collected was harder to explain. [175] Silences. [176] Not the absence of sound — she'd learned that true silence didn't exist — but the flavors of quiet. [193] The bunker's silence tasted like iron and held breath. [202] The forest's silence tasted like rot and patience. [210] The silence after a thunderclap tasted like burnt sugar. [219] She kept a journal, each entry cataloging a new variety, because she believed that if she gathered enough of them, she would find the one that finally felt like peace. [248] Intangibly tangible — that was how she described what she sought. [259] Something she could almost hold but never quite close her fingers around. [271]

The inversions came once a season, unpredictable in their exact timing but reliable in their occurrence. [287] For one hour, gravity reversed, and everything untethered drifted upward. [298] Her father always bolted the bunker doors and waited it out. [309] Of course he did. [313] Maren waited for him to seal himself in, then walked outside and let go. [326]

Rising felt like the opposite of drowning. [333]

She passed through the cloud layer with her arms spread, mist parting around her like curtains, and emerged into gold. [352] The xenial trellis hung above the clouds — an ancient lattice of wood and wire that no one had built and no one could explain, vast as a country, welcoming as an open door. [383] Vines threaded through its framework, and during each inversion, new tendrils would sprout from nodes that had been dormant, reaching toward the inverted earth above as if greeting a returning friend. [415] The trellis caught drifters gently. [420] It had always caught Maren gently. [426]

She hooked her arms through the lattice and hung there, suspended between the golden cloud floor below and the dark sky above, and she listened. [451]

The gilded hush. [454]

It was silence wearing light. [459] It pressed against her eardrums not with weight but with warmth, a quiet so profound it seemed to hum at frequencies below thought. [481] It tasted like honey left in sunlight. [488] Like the space between one breath and the next. [497] Like her mother's hand on her forehead during a fever — present, then gone, then somehow still present. [514]

Maren pressed the porcelain doll against her chest and breathed. [524]

This was the silence she'd been collecting toward. [532] Not empty, not dead, not waiting to be filled. [541] Full already. [543] Full the way the sky is full — with distance, with possibility, with the particular kindness of things that do not close in. [564] The trellis held her without gripping. [570] The clouds glowed without blinding. [575] For one hour, she was untethered from the earth and from every concrete throat her father had ever poured. [593]

She wrote nothing in her journal. [599] Some silences refused description. [603] They could only be worn, briefly, like borrowed gold. [612]

When the inversion ended, she descended slowly, the trellis releasing her the way good things release you — without reluctance but with an open invitation to return. [639] She landed in the yard outside the bunker. [647] Her father unbolted the door, face pale with relief and anger. [658]

"You could have died," he said. [664]

She touched the doll through her shirt. [671] The gilded hush still hummed in her bones, intangibly tangible, stretching the contracted thing inside her chest that had been clenched since childhood. [695]

"I sprouted," she said. [699]

He didn't understand. [702] She didn't need him to. [707]
