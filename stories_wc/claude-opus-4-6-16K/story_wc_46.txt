The mist curled through the serpentine grotto like breath from a sleeping god, winding along walls streaked with mineral veins of jade and iron. [27] Lira sat cross-legged on the damp stone floor, her telescope case beside her, though there was nothing overhead to observe but the grotto's ceiling, dripping with condensation. [52] She had not come to watch stars tonight. [59] She had come to remember them. [65]

The sea glass lay in her palm, a piece no larger than a thumbnail, worn smooth by decades of tide and tumble. [85] It was reflectively vibrant in a way that startled her each time she held it to the lantern light—not merely translucent but alive with captured color, as though a shard of aurora had been frozen and then softened by the ocean's patience. [121] Her mother had found it on the shore the morning Lira was born, and it had been pressed into her hand at every important threshold of her life: her first word, her first telescope, the night her mother did not wake up. [157]

Lira turned the piece slowly, weighing it between her fingers, feeling its slight mass against the immeasurable weight of what it carried. [177] She had always been an earthbound star watcher, someone who mapped constellations from cliffsides and meadows but never left the ground, never boarded the research vessels that sailed to the orbital stations. [205] Her mother had been the same way. [212] "The sky doesn't need us up there," her mother used to say. [223] "It needs us down here, telling people what we see." [233]

That was the inheritance Lira was trying to honor now, sitting in this grotto where the mist softened every sound into a hush, where the serpentine walls twisted the lantern glow into ribbons of warm amber. [265] She opened her polishing kit—small cloths, graduated abrasives, a leather strop—tools she had learned to use not for gemstones but for lenses. [287] The method of gem polishing, her mother had taught her, was the same whether you were refining a ruby or grinding a telescope mirror: patience applied in circles, pressure calibrated by feel, the slow revelation of clarity from roughness. [321]

Tonight, though, she was polishing the sea glass itself. [331]

She dampened the finest cloth and began working in gentle orbits, pressing just enough to coax the surface toward a new degree of luminosity. [355] As memories resurfaced—her mother's hands guiding hers over a lens blank, the smell of cerium oxide, laughter echoing off workshop walls—the mist seemed to thicken around her, as if the grotto were holding its breath alongside her own. [393]

Lira wanted to share light without using fire. [401] That had always been the paradox she carried. [409] Fire consumed, fire scarred, fire demanded fuel and left ash. [419] But starlight traveled unfathomable distances and arrived gentle enough to read by, cool enough to touch. [433] Her mother's love had been like that—constant, illuminating, never burning. [442] And when it ended, it did not leave wreckage, only a long, quiet dark that Lira was still learning to navigate. [461]

She held the sea glass up. [467] Under the polishing, it had reached a state she could only describe as a pearl of stillness—an object so refined and so calm that it seemed to generate its own silence, a hush that expanded outward and settled the restless churning in her chest. [505] The mist around her caught the lantern light passing through the glass, and for a moment, the grotto walls bloomed with pale color: seafoam green, the faintest rose, a whisper of gold. [537]

No fire. [539] No heat. [541] Just light, redirected and shared. [547]

Lira exhaled, and the sound joined the dripping water and the distant murmur of tide outside the grotto's mouth. [565] She weighed the sea glass one final time in her cupped hands, feeling how something so small could anchor a life's worth of meaning. [587] Tomorrow she would take it to the observatory, set it in the eyepiece housing of the old telescope her mother had built, and let visitors peer through a lens framed by ocean-tumbled light. [616] They would see the stars differently then, edged with soft color, and perhaps they would feel what Lira felt now—that gentleness was not weakness, that the quietest glow could reach the farthest. [648]

She tucked the glass into her coat pocket, doused the lantern, and let her eyes adjust. [665] In the absolute dark of the grotto, she could hear the mist moving like a slow exhalation, like a zephyr coaxing the first bloom from frozen ground. [692] And somewhere above, through stone and soil and sky, the stars were shining without burning, as they had always done, as her mother had always known they would. [720]

Lira rose and walked toward the grotto's mouth, where the mist thinned and the night opened wide, carrying her forward into all that quiet, generous light. [748]
