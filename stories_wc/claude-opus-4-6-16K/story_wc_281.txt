Maren had always loved Jonah the way one loves a storm - with awe and a healthy margin of doubt. [19] She was, by nature, an affectionate skeptic: the kind of person who'd kiss your forehead and then ask for your sources. [40] So when Jonah first told her about Synapsin - the telepathy pill, the one the pharmaceutical companies called a "cognitive empathy enhancer" - she'd laughed into her coffee and said, "Show me the peer review." [73] He couldn't, of course. [77] The trials were proprietary. [81] But Jonah believed, and belief had always been his currency, spent freely and without receipts. [96]

Then came the recall. [100]

Synapsin's manufacturer pulled every bottle from every shelf after reports of neurological cascade events - what the press dubbed "static shocks." [120] Not electrical exactly, but close: a sudden, violent reorganization of synaptic pathways that left users stranded between their own thoughts and everyone else's. [143] Jonah's static shock hit on a Tuesday afternoon in March, while he was standing in Maren's light painting studio, holding a fiber-optic wand mid-exposure. [167] She found him on the floor, eyes open, pupils fractally precise - dilated in recursive geometric patterns she'd never seen in human irises before. [190] He was breathing. [193] He was alive. [196] But the Jonah who spoke afterward was different: quieter, flinching at proximity, as though other people's inner lives pressed against his skin like weather. [220]

The doctors called it residual telepathic bleed. [227] They had no cure. [231] The recall had ensured no one else would take Synapsin, but for those already affected, recovery was unmapped territory. [250]

Maren refused to accept unmapped. [255]

She began in the studio, the only place Jonah still seemed calm. [267] The blackout curtains, the silence, the long exposures - something about the dark soothed him. [281] She noticed he responded to light differently now. [289] Certain wavelengths made him wince. [294] Others - particularly the iridescent scatter off a muscovite geode sliver she kept on her worktable - made him go still, attentive, almost peaceful. [316]

She picked up the sliver and turned it under her penlight. [327] Muscovite: a layered silicate, translucent as old window glass, splitting light into spectral whispers. [341] When she angled it during a long exposure, the resulting photograph showed branching patterns - dendrites of refracted color that looked, impossibly, like neural maps. [365]

That was when Maren decided to devise a method no one had tried. [378]

She read Damasio. [381] She read every paper she could find on somatic markers - the body's own signaling system, the gut feelings and skin-prickles and chest-tightenings that encode emotional memory beneath conscious thought. [410] If Jonah's telepathic bleed was neurological noise, then maybe the signal could be isolated through the body's own responses. [429] Not through drugs. [432] Through sensation. [434] Through light. [436]

She worked for weeks. [440] Each night, she'd seat Jonah in the studio's dark center and move the muscovite sliver through space, painting with its refracted light while a camera held its shutter open. [469] She'd ask him simple questions - "Does this feel warm? Does this feel like yours?" - and track his somatic responses: heart rate, galvanic skin response, the micro-expressions that flickered across his face like weather across glass. [504]

Pattern by pattern, pathway by pathway, she began to illuminate hidden pathways - not just in his neurology, but in the space between them. [527] The photographs accumulated on the studio walls: luminous, branching, fractally precise maps of where Jonah ended and the world began. [547] Each image was a boundary recovered, a self redrawn. [556]

He didn't heal all at once. [562] Some mornings he still flinched. [567] Some evenings the bleed pressed in and he'd grip her hand so tightly his knuckles went white, and she'd hold on, skeptical of easy answers but never of him. [596]

"I don't know if this is working," he said one night, sitting in the dark while she adjusted the sliver's angle. [617]

"I don't either," she said. [622] "But your heart rate's down twelve percent from last month, and you let me sit this close without wincing." [641]

He almost smiled. [644] "That's not data," he said softly. [650] "That's just you." [653]

"Jonah," she said, "I'm always the data." [660]

The shutter clicked. [663] Light scattered through muscovite and painted the dark in branching, hopeful lines - fragile as willow glass, precise as fractals, and stubbornly, persistently luminous. [686]

She'd never promised him certainty. [691] Only presence. [693] Only the slow, patient work of mapping what was broken until it began to resemble something navigable, something like a way home. [715]
