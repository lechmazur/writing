Maren had not slept in four days, and the gallery had begun to breathe. [13]

She stood at the center of the Escher Wing, where the floors tilted into ceilings and staircases folded into themselves, and she held a spool of sinew thread between fingers that trembled only slightly. [46] The optical illusion gallery had been her commission, her obsession, her slow unraveling. [57] She was known in certain circles as a fever dream architect, someone who designed spaces that made the rational mind stutter, rooms that obeyed every law of physics yet convinced the eye otherwise. [83] Her buildings were realistically imaginary, structurally sound but perceptually impossible, and people paid extraordinary sums to stand inside her contradictions and feel their certainty dissolve. [106]

But this gallery was different. [110] This one she was building for herself. [117]

The sinew thread came from a supply house in Reykjavik, shipped frozen, each strand the preserved tendon fiber of North Atlantic cod. [138] Organic, translucent, stronger than it looked. [144] She had chosen it because it reminded her of the connective tissue between thoughts, the way one memory attaches to another through material so thin you forget it exists until it snaps. [173] She threaded the first strand through a needle and began stitching it into the installation's frame, by weaving patterns that crossed and recrossed in geometries meant to trick depth perception. [202] From one angle the threads would appear to float free in space. [214] From another they would seem to plunge through the wall into a room that did not exist. [229]

She worked with an unsettling calm that her assistant, Jun, found difficult to watch. [242] He stood in the doorway holding coffee he knew she would not drink. [254]

"When did you last eat?" he asked. [260]

"Tuesday," she said, though it was Friday, and she did not look up. [273]

The truth was that something had begun to shift inside the architecture of her own recall, as memories altered under the pressure of exhaustion and intention. [298] She could no longer remember whether the gallery's blueprint had come first or the dream. [313] There had been a dream, she was almost certain, in which she stood in a room where every surface reflected not light but feeling, and she had reached out and touched the wall and felt the texture of connection itself, that raw thing between people, fibrous and warm and terrifyingly fragile. [360] She had woken knowing she needed to build that room. [370] Or perhaps she had built the room first and the dream was the memory refusing to stay in sequence. [387]

It did not matter. [391] What mattered was the thread, the needle, the pattern. [400]

By Saturday the installation was nearly complete. [407] The sinew threads crisscrossed the gallery in a web so dense it seemed solid from the entrance but dissolved into nothing as you walked forward. [432] The optical illusions on the walls, the Penrose triangles and Necker cubes and impossible waterfalls, merged with the physical threads until visitors would be unable to distinguish painted depth from actual dimension. [462] This was what Maren called rational enchantment, the practice of using verifiable structure to produce an experience indistinguishable from magic. [480] Every angle was calculated. [484] Every tension was measured. [488] And yet the cumulative effect would be wonder so thorough it bordered on vertigo. [501]

Jun found her standing in the center on Sunday morning, barefoot, her palms open, her eyes closed. [517] The threads surrounded her in a cocoon of translucent geometry. [527] He said her name and something erupted, not violently but inevitably, the way a held breath finally escapes. [544] She opened her eyes and tears moved down her face with the same unsettling calm that had governed every movement of the past week. [567]

"I can feel it," she whispered. [573]

He stepped into the web. [578] The threads pressed against his skin, barely perceptible, the tension of a hundred small connections redistributing across the structure to accommodate his weight, his warmth, his presence. [603] He understood then what she had been trying to discover, not an abstraction but an actual, physical texture, the way being tethered to another person has a grain and a give and a breaking point. [637]

The gallery opened to the public the following week. [646] Visitors reported a strange sensation upon entering, a calm that unsettled them, a feeling of being held by something they could not see. [670] Most assumed it was the illusions. [676] A few, the ones who stood very still and breathed very slowly, felt the sinew threads brush against their skin and knew it was something else entirely. [702]

Maren watched from the balcony above, her fever broken at last, her blueprint folded in her pocket, her memory of the dream already becoming the dream of a memory. [733] The room breathed. [736] The threads held. [739] And every connection inside it, realistically imaginary, rationally enchanted, trembled with the weight of being almost, almost, almost understood. [757]
