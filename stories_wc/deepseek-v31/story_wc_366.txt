<story>The lamp flickered once, twice, and died, plunging the lantern room into a silence so profound Elias could hear the blood rushing in his ears. [26] This was the haunted hour, the time after the great beam guttered out, when the sea’s whispers grew teeth and the old stories stretched their legs. [50] Elias, the island’s reticent lighthouse supply skipper, was not meant to be here now; a failing fuel pump had delayed his departure, trapping him atop the stone spire for the night. [78] His only comfort was the small, smooth piece of sea glass he worried in his palm, its frosty green surface worn opaque by countless tides. [103]

A low moan, more felt than heard, vibrated through the iron grating under his boots. [120] It was not the wind. [124] The stories claimed the room was haunted by the first keeper, a man who had failed to protect his own family from a winter squall. [152] Now he rattled the glass, trying to snuff out any new light. [168] Elias’s hand closed tightly around the sea glass, its blunt edges a grounding pressure. [186] He was a man of practicalities—fuel levels, grocery lists, weather reports—not ghosts. [203] But the darkness here had weight and intention. [212]

His flashlight beam cut a shaky path across the room, illuminating a small, hollow space between the gears of the rotation mechanism. [235] Tucked inside was a jar, and within it, a neat roll of papers. [251] His heart thudded against his ribs. [259] He uncorked the jar, his fingers clumsy, and unrolled the first sheet. [274] The handwriting was unfamiliar, a looping script that spoke of careful penmanship. [290] *I saw your boat today,* it began. *The red stripe is cheerful. I’ve been stacking stones on the eastern bluff. You can see them from the channel. A way of stacking stones as messages. It means ‘All is well.’* [340]

Elias sank onto a crate, reading by the wan flashlight. [351] This was the fourth letter. [355] The first was dated three months prior. [361] They were an anonymous letter chain, passed between him and the island’s only other resident, Elara, the keeper he supplied but had never formally met. [392] She left her replies in the bait box on the dock; he left his in the boathouse. [410] Their correspondence was a quiet, secret ledger of their solitude. [424] He wrote of foghorns and supply manifests; she wrote of bird migrations and the changing taste of the rain. [447] He was warmly observant in these letters in a way he could never be in person, his words painting a careful picture of a world she could not leave. [479]

Another groan shuddered through the tower, and the temperature dropped sharply. [494] The scent of salt and old sorrow thickened the air. [505] A deep, protective instinct surged in Elias, wholly foreign and absolutely certain. [521] He had to protect these letters. [527] They were not just paper and ink; they were a bottled feeling of safety, a tiny, shared flame in the overwhelming dark. [552] They were the acknowledgment that they were not alone. [565]

The metal door to the stairs flew open with a deafening clang. [577] The void beyond it was deeper than night. [586] Elias shoved the letters into his chest pocket, the jar clattering to the floor. [601] He stood, clutching his sea glass, and faced the emptiness. [613] "No," he said, his voice a rough stone in the quiet. [625] "You don't get this light." [631]

He felt a pressure build, an ancient grief seeking an entry point. [644] It focused on the letters, on the warmth they emanated. [656] Elias thought of Elara’s words, of her stone messages on the bluff, and an idea flared. [674] He dropped to his knees, ignoring the creeping cold, and began pulling tools from his kit—wrenches, pliers, a heavy hammer. [699] He arranged them not by function, but by shape and heft, building a small, deliberate cairn on the iron floor. [723] It was a message. [726] It was a barricade. [729] It said, *I am here. This is mine. You shall not pass.* [742]

The oppressive presence hesitated, recoiling from the simple, defiant geometry. [755] The cold receded incrementally, chased away by the luminescent ache of human connection, a glow that had nothing to do with the dead lamp above. [783] Outside, the first grey light of dawn touched the horizon. [795] Elias picked up the sea glass, its surface now warm from his grip, and knew what he would write next. [816]</story>
