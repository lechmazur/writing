<story>Aris found the substitute body at dawn, a waxen effigy already softening in the morning sun. [18] Its uncanny face, molded to mirror her own lost child, was a mockery that made her gorge rise. [33] She was a forgiving skeptic by nature, a historian who trusted only the evidence she could touch and catalog, and this thing was an affront to reason. [54] Yet, the grief that should have crested broke against a sudden, strange calm. [68] She felt a cleft in certainty open within her, a fissure wide enough to admit impossible truths. [84] The Fae had taken her son, Leo, and left this chilling duplicate in his crib. [98] But they had gotten one detail wrong, a mistake she, with her historian’s eye, had immediately spotted. [117] As the household descended into panicked whispers, Aris slipped away, her movements shrewdly innocent, a mother simply seeking solitude in her grief. [142] Her destination was the one place logic had never fully explained: the overgrown hedge maze at the property’s edge, and the secret garden hidden behind it. [167]

The maze was a puzzle she and Leo had loved to solve together. [179] Pushing through the final, needle-thin gap in the privet, she entered the garden. [194] It was not a place of pretty flowers, but of wild, ancient things—stone tablets softened by moss, a fountain that wept iron-rich water, and an oak so old its branches seemed to hold up the sky. [231] Here, the air hummed with a nostalgic innovation, a feeling of very old magic being used for new, desperate purposes. [253] It was the only place that feltlarge enough to hold her sorrow. [265] She came to yearn for a sign, not a passive hope but an active, aching reach of her soul into the stillness. [285] She begged the garden, the universe, anything listening, to show her how to find her boy. [302]

Her answer came not as a sound, but as a faint glint near the base of the great oak. [321] Nestled in a cradle of roots was a single, impossibly white object: a changeling's baby tooth. [341] It was the detail the Fae had missed; her real son, Leo, had not yet lost a single tooth. [362] This was a piece of their own world, accidentally left behind. [377] To a skeptic, it was proof. [384] To a mother, it was a compass needle. [392] Her shrewd innocence—a mind that questioned everything yet a heart that believed in love—coalesced into a plan. [413] She would use their own artifact against them. [423] She understood now that her motivation was not merely to get him back, but to perform a greater alchemy: to turn mistakes into constellations, to map this tragedy into a new story of understanding. [461]

Holding the tooth tightly, she felt a pull, a thread of connection. [475] She focused on Leo’s face, not his absence, and the garden responded. [489] The air thickened, the light bent, and a doorway of woven branches shimmered into existence within the oak’s trunk. [510] Stepping through was like passing through a wall of cold water. [523] The world on the other side was a mirror of her own, but sharper, brighter, and tinged with twilight. [543] A small figure hunched by a stream, his arm bent at a cruel, unnatural angle. [560] It was Leo, his small body shuddering with silent sobs. [573] The sight did not shatter her; it focused her. [583] She had arrived after the substitute was found, and her action here had to be immediate and true. [602]

“I’m here, my love,” she whispered, her voice steady. [613] He flinched, then cried out, scrambling toward her. [623] She caught him, her hands gently assessing the broken arm. [634] Her grandfather had been a bonesetter, and she had spent her childhood watching him work, the method a familiar, comforting ritual. [657] Here, now, it was her prayer. [664] She found two straight sticks for splints and tore a strip from her linen shirt for a bandage. [684] Her touch was firm and sure. [690] “This will hurt for a moment, my brave star,” she said, her voice a low song. [707] With a deft, practiced twist, she set the bone. [718] Leo cried out, then slumped against her, the worst of the pain over. [734]

As he nestled into her, the Fae emerged from the shimmering woods, not with malice, but with a watchful, curious silence. [758] Aris held up the baby tooth, its meaning clear: a bridge, not a weapon. [775] A mistake they could weave into a new constellation of truce. [787] She held her son and waited. [793]</story>
