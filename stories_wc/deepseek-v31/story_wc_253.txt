<story>The silence in the farmhouse was a thing he had built himself, a remade hush to replace the one that had been violently taken. [26] It was a different quality of quiet, dense and curated, and it was the only thing Elias could cultivate. [46] Outside, the colossal shadows of the wind turbines swept across the fields in a perpetual, silent eclipse. [67] This was life after the Happiness Mandate, where mandated joy had curdled into something hollow, leaving behind an emotional void in everyone, especially him. [92]

Elias was a blank-faced performer by trade, once paid to mime delight for public festivals. [109] Now, he performed for an audience of one in the dusty stillness of the kitchen. [126] He picked up a small knife and a piece of soft pine, his movements precise and habitual. [145] He would whittle, his fingers moving with a slow, practiced grace that belied the turmoil he could no longer express. [168] He did not know what he was making, only that the action was necessary. [185]

On the scarred wooden table beside him lay a dried flower bouquet, its petals brittle and the colour of dust. [207] It was the last thing she had gathered from their field before the Mandate’s enforcement brigade had come through, their loudspeakers blaring corrosive cheer. [235] Their demand for a smile had been met with her defiant frown, a crime that required re-education. [256] She never came back. [260] His grief was a stone in his gut, too heavy to carry, so he sought to cultivate lightness in grief instead, though he only ever achieved a profound, weightless emptiness. [290]

He began to speak, his voice a flat, low monotone that cut the thick air. [305] He was dramatically narrating mundane tasks, a private ritual to fill the silence without truly breaking it. [326] “The performer selects his blade,” he intoned. [334] “He considers the grain of the wood, the rebellion of a knot against his intended design.” [355] Each word was a performance devoid of feeling, a script for a play with no audience left. [377] His motives were morally ambiguous; was this a tribute to her memory, or was it a surrender to the void she left behind? [402]

The sweeping shadow of a turbine blade plunged the room into momentary darkness, a giant’s heartbeat. [421] In the brief twilight, the dried flowers seemed to tremble. [433] His narration continued, unwavering. [438] “He carves away the excess, the unnecessary layers. [447] He is not creating form. [451] He is revealing the silence trapped within.” [461] The wood curled away from his blade in pale, delicate ribbons. [475]

A sudden, sharp crack made him start. [482] A stem on the dried bouquet had snapped, releasing a single, petrified lavender bloom onto the table. [502] The event felt monumental. [506] He stared at the fallen flower, and for the first time in a year, a feeling not sourced from the Mandate punched through the void: not sadness, but a fierce and startling protectiveness. [545] This relic was all he had left of her, and it was crumbling to dust. [563]

His narration faltered, then resumed with a new, raw undercurrent. [575] “The performer… ceases his carving.” [581] He put the knife and the unnamed wooden shape down. [592] “He sees that some things are too light to be whittled, too fragile to bear the edge of a blade.” [614] With a tenderness that shocked him, he gathered the fallen petals into his palm. [631] He carried them to the hearth and, instead of casting them in, he began to weave the dry stems into the rough shape of a bird, a thing meant for flight, not for stillness. [667]

He was no longer cultivating lightness as an escape from grief’s weight. [682] He was trying to build a vessel for it, however fragile. [694] The turbines outside completed another rotation, their shadow passing over him like a blessing or a sentence—he could no longer tell the difference. [723] He held the skeletal floral bird in his hands, a morally ambiguous offering to a memory, a thing both dead and full of potential flight. [752] In the remade hush of the farmhouse, the void remained, but now there was a silhouette within it. [774] He placed the bird on the windowsill, where it would watch the giants turn. [791]</story>
