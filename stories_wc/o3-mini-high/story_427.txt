Inside the crumbling walls of the lighthouse, each echoing step unravelled layers of memories and philosophical musings, as the shifting equilibria of his mind deconstructed the long-held axioms of reason. <words>118</words>

As the last vestiges of daylight surrendered to a melancholy night within the lighthouse's hollow heart, his spirit, emboldened yet marred by regret, wove words and images through silent soliloquies that defied logic, uniting every shattered fragment into a silent hymn of survival and rebirth. <words>376</words>
