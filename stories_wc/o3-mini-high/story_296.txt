When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off, a familiar enigma in the form of an unsung traveler arrived at the submarine research facility. <words>23</words>
Clutched tightly in one hand, a pair of chopsticks—one noticeably broken—served as his only memento from a past life filled with chaotic beauty. <words>46</words>
In quiet solitude, he cherished the broken chopstick with a hatefully adored intensity, a paradoxical sentiment that both repelled and enchanted him. <words>68</words>
Following a set of instructions hidden in a tattered cookbook, he resolved to empower himself and those around him by decoding subtle rituals etched into fragile culinary recipes. <words>96</words>
