Before him rested a sun-bleached desert skull, its empty sockets seeming to stare into the void.

This was his primary vessel, acquired painstakingly via black-market transactions in forgotten digital alleys.
<words>80</words>
He needed it to contain the fragile, resonant whispers he sought.

Each successful capture filled him with a strange, haggard awe.

The skull pulsed faintly, absorbing the captured frequency.
<words>238</words>

His motivation wasn't profit or fame, but a deep-seated need to preserve these genuinely artificial echoes.

<words>278</words>
Another lost lullaby, contained within the silent confines of the skull.
