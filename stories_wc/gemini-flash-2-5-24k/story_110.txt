<words>16</words>
He wasn't just fixing timepieces; he was dissecting the broken mechanisms of domestic mysteries, hoping to transmute pain into a masterpiece of quiet finality.
<words>41</words>
A peculiar moss-covered lantern sat on his workbench, its dim light casting long, dancing shadows.

Tick-Tock himself was a study in contrasts, his movements precise yet imbued with a quietly flamboyant grace, like a morbid ballet dancer.
<words>78</words>
He didn't just kill; he seemed to adore the intricate, pathetic unraveling of lives built on secrets.

His signature wasn't a calling card, but a series of bleak eulogies delivered anonymously, each one a carefully crafted poem mentioning hidden truths only the deceased and their killer knew.

This particular moment felt like it existed between chapters, a pause after one messy resolution and before the next inevitable tragedy.
<words>150</words>
"Another clock stopped," he muttered with a sigh that was half genuine despair, half darkly comedic resignation.

Was the masterpiece the death itself, or the chillingly accurate eulogy that followed?
<words>253</words>
"Such drama over prize-winning petunias," he chuckled, a dry, brittle sound like gears grinding.
<words>269</words>
He saw himself as a curator of domestic decay, using bleak eulogies to highlight the rot beneath the polished surface.
<words>290</words>
This quiet interlude between chapters was necessary for processing, for finding the right words for the next truth bomb.

He truly did adore the intricate patterns of human failure, the tiny cracks that led to catastrophic breaks.
<words>327</words>
The moss-covered lantern seemed to weep green tears, mirroring the despairing humor of his task.
<words>345</words>
Each 'job' was a brushstroke, each eulogy a layer of varnish on the dark canvas of his life's work.
<words>364</words>
The rhythmic drip of a nearby water clock was the only sound, a steady pulse in the heart of his macabre workshop.
