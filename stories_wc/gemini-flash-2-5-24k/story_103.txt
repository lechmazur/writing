The weatherbeaten knight stared into the cracked mirror, seeing not his present confinement but a moment frozen within its depths. <words>19</words> He stood before a heavy oak door, its surface marred by a tarnished brass door knocker shaped like a weeping face. <words>36</words> This lighthouse prison off a jagged reef was merely the physical echo of the impossible choices made in that reflected past. <words>52</words> His sole motivation now was to hush the final cry of regret that still echoed from that decision point. <words>68</words> He remembered his own demeanor, then, a grudgingly sweet resolve masking the turmoil beneath. <words>81</words> The choice had been laid out not in words, but through a set of seemingly random items scattered before him – a broken locket, a single white feather, a blood-stained coin – that formed a chillingly clear pattern of inevitable loss. <words>116</words> To save one, the other must fall; the pattern offered no third path. <words>127</words> He had to appreciate, in a twisted way, the brutal honesty of that silent arrangement. <words>141</words> The memory brought a wave of joyful agony, a strange elation born from the profound pain of his sacrifice. <words>156</words> Every crashing wave against the reef outside felt like another beat of that moment's drum. <words>169</words> The salt spray on the glass blurred the reflection, yet the weeping knocker remained sharp, a constant reminder. <words>184</words> He traced its outline on the cold stone wall beside the mirror. <words>194</words> The pattern of items, once a guide to his doom, now seemed a map of his soul's landscape. <words>209</words> He saw the locket representing the love he protected, the feather the innocence he lost, the coin the price he paid. <words>228</words> This understanding, though forged in suffering, held a peculiar, sharp sweetness. <words>239</words> He had chosen the path that saved the many, condemning the one he cherished most. <words>252</words> The cry of regret was his own, a silent scream trapped in the mirror's glass. <words>266</words> He leaned his forehead against the cool surface, trying to absorb the image, to make its pain his own completely. <words>283</words> Perhaps by fully embracing the agony, the joy of having made *a* choice, however terrible, could finally silence the echo. <words>301</words> The lighthouse beam swept across the room, momentarily illuminating the reflection with blinding clarity. <words>313</words> He saw the knight's hand reach for the knocker, the point of no return. <words>325</words> The weight of that brass felt heavy even in this spectral replay. <words>335</words> It was the weight of a life irrevocably altered by a pattern only he could see. <words>349</words> He had to appreciate the stark beauty of such absolute consequence. <words>359</words> The joyful agony tightened its grip, a knot of sorrow and strange triumph in his chest. <words>373</words> He was a prisoner not of stone, but of a moment eternally captured within a mirrored reflection. <words>388</words> And the only key was to find peace in the terrible pattern he had followed. <words>401</words>
