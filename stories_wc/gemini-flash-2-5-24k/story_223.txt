A seasick naval officer, weary from centuries of traversing unstable realities, finally reached the crystal fortress at the end of the rainbow canyon. <words>22</words>
He'd followed the shimmering path, driven by a quiet longing that spanned ages. <words>33</words>
In his hand, he clutched a translucent ghost orchid bulb, a secret traded long ago for a truth he now doubted. <words>53</words>
Despite his perpetual nausea, he possessed an awkwardly charming way with the fortress's ethereal guardians. <words>70</words>
His ultimate goal: to transform himself, using the bulb and by tracking moon phases, into something capable of confronting the mirror before it lies again. <words>98</words>
This wasn't just any mirror; it was the one that had twisted his reflection and destiny centuries ago. <words>115</words>
His motivation burned with nostalgic defiance, remembering the past but refusing to let its deception stand. <words>133</words>
He needed to face it here, in this place built from solidified light, before its lies could poison another age. <words>154</words>
The fortress hummed with ancient power, a silent witness to his long journey and desperate purpose. <words>171</words>
He began the ritual, placing the bulb under the waxing crescent, its faint glow mirroring the distant moon. <words>190</words>
Each phase tracked brought a subtle shift, a hardening of resolve, a clarity replacing the centuries of fog. <words>209</words>
The traded secret wasn't just the bulb's power, but the knowledge of this specific transformation tied to the celestial rhythm. <words>231</words>
He remembered the sea, the endless roll, the constant unease â€“ a physical manifestation of the mirror's initial deception. <words>250</words>
That seasickness, a constant companion, was a reminder of the instability the lie had introduced into his very being. <words>271</words>
Now, within the fortress's stillness, guided by the moon's steady cycle, he felt the transformation taking hold. <words>291</words>
His essence solidified, becoming resistant to illusion, though the awkward charm remained, a genuine part of him. <words>311</words>
He was no longer just a seasick officer; he was the culmination of a long, defiant journey. <words>328</words>
The mirror waited in the fortress's deepest chamber, a shimmering portal promising reflection or deceit. <words>345</words>
He approached it, the ghost orchid bulb now a part of his transformed self, pulsing with soft light. <words>363</words>
Centuries of quiet longing culminated in this moment, a confrontation born of necessity and stubborn hope. <words>381</words>
He met his reflection, not with fear, but with the nostalgic defiance of one who had finally found his footing. <words>401</words>
The mirror flickered, attempting its old tricks, but his moon-phased transformation held firm. <words>416</words>
He saw the truth, the unvarnished reality, reflected back for the first time in ages. <words>431</words>
The seasickness faded, replaced by the solid ground of self-knowledge within the crystal walls. <words>447</words>
He had confronted the mirror, not just before it could lie again, but to reclaim the truth it had stolen centuries ago. <words>470</words>
