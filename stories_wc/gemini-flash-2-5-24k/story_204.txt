The vast, abandoned spaceport hangar held its breath.
<words>7</words>
It was the hush before an acceptance speech began somewhere far beyond its crumbling walls.
<words>20</words>
Elara, a professional cuddler whose touch brought solace in a world starved for connection, traced the dust on a derelict launch console.
<words>38</words>
Her presence here felt like an ancient novelty, something unusually usual in this forgotten place.
<words>51</words>
Clutched in her hand was a phantom train ticket punch, its metal cool and strangely insubstantial.
<words>66</words>
She was here to confront the unspoken rules that enforced a deep-seated prejudice against her kind, a prejudice she desperately needed to overcome.
<words>87</words>
The punch had come into her possession during a chance encounter at a bustling farmer's market weeks ago.
<words>103</words>
An old woman, her eyes holding the weight of forgotten journeys, had pressed it into Elara's palm, whispering of passages not taken and barriers built by fear.
<words>128</words>
The punch, she'd said, was a key to understanding the invisible tracks laid by society's judgment, the ones that kept people like Elara confined.
<words>152</words>
Now, standing amidst the decay of this once-grand hub, Elara felt the truth of those words resonate.
<words>169</words>
The prejudice, like the hangar itself, was a structure built on past fears, slowly succumbing to the inevitable action of decay.
<words>188</words>
Raising the phantom punch, she aimed it at the empty air, visualizing the invisible ticket representing the unspoken rule that labeled her profession as lesser.
<words>212</words>
There was no sound, no physical mark, but a ripple seemed to pass through the stagnant air, a subtle shift in the ancient novelty of the moment.
<words>236</words>
A quiet resolve solidified within her; the punch wasn't for marking tickets, but for acknowledging the phantom nature of the barriers themselves.
<words>257</words>
The hush deepened, pregnant with anticipation for the speech that would soon fill the airwaves, a speech about progress and connection.
<words>279</words>
Elara understood that overcoming the prejudice wasn't about fighting the decay, but about stepping through the decaying structure, recognizing its lack of substance.
<words>303</words>
Her path, unusually usual in its quiet defiance, was to continue offering connection, proving its essential nature one gentle embrace at a time.
<words>327</words>
The phantom punch was a reminder that the most rigid rules were often the ones that didn't truly exist, held in place only by collective belief and fear.
<words>353</words>
With a final glance at the decaying grandeur, Elara turned, the phantom punch a weightless promise in her hand, ready to step back into a world that needed her unusually usual touch.
<words>386</words>
The acceptance speech would speak of futures built, but Elara knew the real building began with dismantling the phantom barriers of the past.
