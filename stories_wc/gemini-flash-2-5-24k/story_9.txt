The neon glow bled across the sand, painting the maze of forgotten billboards in lurid, mocking hues. <words>20</words>
Elias, the mildly panicked soothsayer, hunched over a battered wooden bar top, its surface a roadmap of spilled drinks and despair. <words>38</words>
We were living between lost years, a time when the future felt less like a path and more like a punchline. <words>55</words>
He clutched a pocket puzzle box with 13 locks, its intricate metal cool against his sweaty palm. <words>70</words>
"Right," he muttered, a molten sarcasm dripping from his voice, "let's see what the universe has in store for us now, shall we?" <words>90</words>
His motivation was simple, if probably unlikely: to shape destiny with bare hands, or at least, with whatever meager tools he possessed. <words>111</words>
The core concept, the fate of this poisoned world and the desperate need for environmental stewardship, weighed heavier than the desert heat. <words>129</words>
He leaned closer, trying to magnify the patterns left by countless condensation rings on the wood grain. <words>145</words>
This was his method, by reading the water rings on a battered wooden bar top, seeking visions in the mundane. <words>162</words>
Each ring, a ripple in time, a consequence of neglect, a warning ignored. <words>174</words>
The puzzle box remained stubbornly locked, a symbol of the complex, multi-faceted problem he faced. <words>189</words>
Thirteen locks, thirteen hurdles, thirteen ways the future could slam shut. <words>200</words>
His panic wasn't just about the difficulty; it was the sheer, overwhelming apathy he saw reflected in the garish signs surrounding them. <words>220</words>
"Oh yes," he sighed, tracing a particularly dark ring, "looks like another century of 'progress' brought to you by 'MegaCorp Sludge & Shine'." <words>241</words>
The vision coalesced, murky and grim, showing choked rivers and skies thick with haze – the price of ignoring stewardship. <words>259</words>
He needed to find the combination to the box, to unlock whatever ancient wisdom or desperate measure it contained. <words>276</words>
But the signs in the rings were contradictory, fragmented, like trying to read a shattered mirror. <words>290</words>
"Fantastic," he drawled, wiping sweat from his brow, "the future says 'maybe don't trash the planet', but also 'buy more plastic widgets'." <words>310</words>
The probability of actually changing anything felt vanishingly small, probably unlikely to the point of absurdity. <words>325</words>
Yet, the urge to grasp that elusive destiny, to mold it with his own effort, was a fire in his gut. <words>343</words>
He pressed his fingers against the wood, trying to magnify the faintest lines, hoping for a clearer sign, a sequence for the locks. <words>363</words>
The neon pulsed, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to mock his frantic efforts. <words>376</words>
He knew shaping destiny with bare hands in this era, using this ridiculous method, was a long shot. <words>392</words>
But the alternative – passive acceptance of ecological collapse – was simply unbearable. <words>404</words>
So he kept reading the rings, kept fumbling with the box, a mildly panicked soothsayer in a world gone mad, fueled by sarcasm and a desperate, probably unlikely hope. <words>433</words>
