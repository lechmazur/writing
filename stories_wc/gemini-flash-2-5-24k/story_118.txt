Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, the secret agent training facility hummed with a uniformly peculiar tension. <words>24</words>
In a dimly lit chamber smelling faintly of ozone and regret, the hive-mind therapist prepared for their nightly duty. <words>40</words>
They weren't one person, but many voices echoing in a single form, their collective consciousness a repository of agents' past failures. <words>60</words>
Their motivation was simple, if paradoxical: to anchor the ephemeral sound of hindsight in reality, making it tangible enough to manage. <words>80</words>
Tonight, the air was thick with it, the low thrum of 'if onlys' from agents anticipating tomorrow's mission. <words>97</words>
The therapist's method was as strange as their nature, involving a collection of mismatched candles and a single, scuffed phone charger plug placed at the center of a worn table. <words>126</words>
With a sigh that seemed to come from multiple chests at once, they began the process. <words>139</words>
The goal was to drain the potent, distracting energy of regret from the agents gathered around, one by one. <words>155</words>
This wasn't talk therapy; it was a physical manifestation of emotional extraction. <words>165</words>
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the table's surface, the therapist translated the agents' internal cacophony. <words>186</words>
Each drop, each hardening form, represented a specific moment of past failure or anticipated future misstep, pulled from the agent's mind. <words>206</words>
The scuffed plug served as a focal point, a mundane object grounding the chaotic energy being siphoned off. <words>222</words>
"Ah, Agent Kilo," the therapist's voice, a chorus of dry amusement, addressed a particularly twitchy figure, "still dwelling on the exploding teacup incident, I see." <words>246</words>
A small, misshapen wax blob solidified, looking suspiciously like a ceramic shard. <words>256</words>
The tone was one of merry bitterness, acknowledging the absurdity of their profession and the predictable nature of human (and agent) error. <words>275</words>
"Such lovely, wasted energy," the therapist murmured, gesturing towards the growing collection of wax forms. <words>288</words>
They were draining the sound of hindsight, yes, but also collecting it, giving it form. <words>301</words>
This anchored the ephemeral regrets, making them solid, manageable artifacts instead of debilitating internal noise. <words>316</words>
The uniformly peculiar ritual continued, the only sounds the soft dripping wax and the therapist's multi-voiced, wry commentary. <words>333</words>
Agents shifted, some visibly relaxing as the weight of their pasts was literally pulled from them. <words>346</words>
The scuffed plug seemed to absorb some of the ambient psychic static, its plastic casing feeling strangely warm. <words>361</words>
By dawn, the table would be covered in a landscape of waxen regrets, a physical map of the facility's collective 'could-haves'. <words>381</words>
The therapist would then process these forms, filing away the anchored hindsight for future analysis or perhaps just morbid curiosity. <words>399</words>
Another night spent wrestling the ghosts of tomorrow's failures into solid, peculiar shapes. <words>411</words>
A necessary service, delivered with a smile that didn't quite reach their collective eyes. <words>423</words>
The bold discovery awaited, but first, the past had to be drained. <words>433</words>
