Amid morning walks, Elias, a black market genealogist burdened by a decade of unearthed secrets, entered the witch's incantation chamber.
<words>19</words>
It was an atypically typical space, less bubbling cauldrons and more ancient texts scattered around a worn, circular stone table.
<words>37</words>
On the table sat a chipped bowl, its ceramic surface smooth despite the imperfection, holding nothing but dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light.
<words>61</words>
Elias carried the heavy weight of guilt from lives disrupted by the truths he'd sold, desperately seeking a path to self-forgiveness.

His unique method involved analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, finding the unspoken connections and hidden lineages buried beneath polite grief.
<words>97</words>
He would zoom in on phrases, pauses, and omissions, piecing together narratives the deceased had tried to erase.
<words>113</words>
Each successful trace felt like another stone added to the cairn of his regrets.
<words>124</words>
He spoke of his illicit skill with a brazen modesty, acknowledging its effectiveness while downplaying the moral cost, a defense mechanism honed over years.
<words>146</words>
The chipped bowl felt like his own fractured soul, holding the emptiness left by his actions.
<words>160</words>
The chamber, meant for summoning spirits, felt appropriate for someone who trafficked in the ghosts of ancestry.
<words>175</words>
Today, however, felt different; a fragile sense of being on the brink of renewal permeated the dust-filled air.

He wasn't here to find a client's ancestor; he was here to find his own absolution.
<words>205</words>
He had brought eulogies for people whose lives he believed he had ruined, searching not for lineage, but for echoes of forgiveness or understanding in the words of the living.
<words>241</words>
He picked up the chipped bowl, turning it slowly, then used his phone to zoom in on a tiny, almost invisible symbol etched near the rim â€“ perhaps a maker's mark, or something more.
<words>274</words>
Could even something broken hold a sign of origin, a hint of how it was made and perhaps, how it could be mended?

"It's a peculiar talent, I admit," he muttered aloud, his voice echoing slightly, "unearthing the dead's secrets from the living's lies.
<words>314</words>
Quite effective, if morally questionable."
<words>319</words>
The morning light shifted, illuminating a section of the stone table where faint carvings were visible, symbols he hadn't noticed before amid his usual work.
<words>343</words>
Were these part of the chamber's power, offering a different kind of insight than his eulogy analysis?
<words>359</words>
He placed the eulogies beside the chipped bowl, the atypically typical chamber feeling less like a place of dark magic and more like a quiet space for reckoning.
<words>385</words>
The path to self-forgiveness was unclear, but here, surrounded by the tools of his trade and the symbols of this strange place, he felt closer than ever to stepping across that threshold.
