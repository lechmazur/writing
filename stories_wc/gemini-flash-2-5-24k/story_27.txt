Perched within the skeletal remains of the haunted amusement park prize booth, the cynic watched finches amid bird watching.

A vintage pencil box, worn smooth by time, rested beside them, holding not pencils but fragments of brittle, dark glass.
<words>35</words>
They were cursed to speak only truth, a burden that felt less like a curse and more like seeing the frayed edges of a tapestry of fate.
<words>57</words>
Their gaze, usually sharp, softened slightly as a particularly dull-eyed pigeon landed nearby, a perfect symbol of a stagnant mind.
<words>76</words>
A deep, quiet impulse stirred within the cynic: to provoke evolution, even if painful.
<words>88</words>
With a voice like calm water over sharp stones, they spoke, their tone layered tranquility masking something politely vindictive.
<words>105</words>
"Your predictable path," the cynic stated, observing the pigeon's mindless pecking, "is woven into the dullest thread of existence."
<words>123</words>
The truth, stark and unyielding, hung in the air, a seed planted in the stagnant mind.
<words>136</words>
This was their method, learned through bitter experience: truth delivered with precision to initiate change.
<words>150</words>
For those truly resistant, those clinging desperately to illusion, the truth had a more severe effect.
<words>164</words>
It could petrify, not instantly, but subtly, incrementally, with the phases of the moon guiding the slow, internal hardening.
<words>184</words>
The glass shards in the pencil box were remnants of others who had heard the unvarnished truth and could not bear the sight of fate's pattern.
<words>206</words>
They had turned inward, their minds becoming as rigid and breakable as obsidian.
<words>218</words>
The cynic felt no malice, only the quiet sorrow of witnessing inevitable consequences dictated by the tapestry.
<words>235</words>
Their motivation wasn't cruelty, but a desperate hope that some minds, exposed to the harsh light of reality, might adapt rather than shatter.
<words>256</words>
The pigeon, oblivious, cooed its simple, repetitive sound, a tiny knot in the vast, complex weave of destiny.
<words>272</words>
The cynic picked up a shard from the vintage pencil box, its edge cool and sharp against their finger.
<words>288</words>
It reflected the pale afternoon sky, a sky indifferent to the small dramas of truth and stagnation played out below.
<words>306</words>
They knew their curse was a tool, albeit a brutal one, for revealing the inescapable patterns of the tapestry of fate.
<words>324</words>
Each truthful word, spoken from the haunted amusement park prize booth amid bird watching, was an attempt to fray a stagnant thread or strengthen a resilient one.
<words>348</words>
The politely vindictive edge was merely the force required to cut through layers of self-deception.
<words>361</words>
And the petrification, guided by the moon's silent cycle, was the universe's own slow, indifferent response to minds that refused to evolve.
<words>382</words>
The cynic sighed, the sound lost in the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant, creaking groan of the park's decaying Ferris wheel.
<words>401</words>
They placed the shard back in the vintage pencil box, waiting for the next stagnant mind to cross their path, waiting for the moon to wax.
