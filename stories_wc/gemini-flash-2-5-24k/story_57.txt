<story>
Lord Ashworth, a submissive aristocrat by birth and inclination, found himself, rather absurdly, trimming hedges amid yard work at the clandestine secret agent workshop.
<words>23</words>
He clutched a dull letter opener, its brass handle worn smooth, feeling unusually perceptive today, perhaps due to the peculiar humidity.
<words>41</words>
A wave of silent empathy washed over him, a familiar pang whenever he sensed danger near the workshop's most vulnerable creature: the iridescent, perpetually startled moon-moth pupa in the greenhouse.
<words>69</words>
His sensitivity, coupled with the workshop's bizarre acoustics, meant he often gleaned snippets of crucial intel through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers designed for sonic weapon testing.
<words>96</words>
Just then, a distorted whisper bounced from the adjacent chamber – something about 'thermal destabilization' and 'scheduled disposal' of 'non-essential biologicals'.
<words>120</words>
Non-essential biologicals?
<words>122</words>
That could only mean the pupa, scheduled for termination because it wasn't a weapon or spy gadget.
<words>140</words>
Ashworth's heart, usually as placid as a pond, gave a frantic flutter; he had to act, even if it meant employing his one, utterly ridiculous, inherited ability: to liquify certain non-living substances.
<words>174</words>
Gripping the dull letter opener, which wasn't just dull but also the conduit for this odd talent, he focused on the heavy, reinforced door of the sonic chamber, the source of the cruel plan.
<words>206</words>
With a mental push, guided by his fierce, protective motivation, he willed the metal of the door's locking mechanism to liquify, just enough to jam it temporarily.
<words>231</words>
"Honestly, turning solid metal into a puddle," he muttered with earnest flippancy, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow, "one does wonder what sort of family curse this is."
<words>260</words>
The delay, however brief, would give him time to reach the greenhouse and perhaps hide the pupa, or at least plead its case to someone less... disposal-minded.
<words>290</words>
This was hardly the life Lord Ashworth envisioned – less tea parties, more melting doors – but protecting the small, shimmering life felt surprisingly right, even if it involved espionage-adjacent property damage.
<words>326</words>
The echo chamber fell silent again, the whispers gone, but the threat lingered, a cold certainty in the humid air.
<words>347</words>
He could almost feel the pupa's fragile existence, a tiny beacon of vulnerability in this world of hardened operatives and lethal gadgets.
<words>370</words>
His submissive nature warred with the urgent need to shield the creature; for once, the need to protect won, spurred by that silent, powerful empathy.
<words>397</words>
He pocketed the letter opener, its dullness now feeling like a secret weapon, and hurried towards the greenhouse, leaving the half-melted lock as a testament to an aristocrat's unexpected defiance.
