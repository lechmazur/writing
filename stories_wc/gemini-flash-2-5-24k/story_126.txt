The observation deck of Station 7 hung like a tear in the void, a relic after the last tree falls. <words>19</words>
Kaelen, the shipwrecked merchant, watched the dead Earth below, his gaze holding an aloof passion. <words>33</words>
He carried the weight of a singular purpose: to shatter the grand illusion that kept humanity tethered to this sterile existence. <words>50</words>
Beside him sat a rustic butter churn, an honestly strange companion in this metallic tomb. <words>63</words>
It was a salvaged piece, a tactile memory of soil and growth, now a symbol of the rebellious sparks flickering within him. <words>83</words>
His plan was honestly strange, a path not through airlocks or corridors, but something else entirely. <words>99</words>
He would ascend, not physically into the station's upper levels, but via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station section. <words>123</words>
This derelict wing, Station 7-B, was a forgotten pocket, its old promotional posters peeling like sunburnt skin. <words>141</words>
One poster, advertising 'Veridian Forests', was his chosen gate, a lie he would twist into truth. <words>158</words>
He didn't climb; he focused, his will a tangible force, using the poster's decaying edges as a conceptual ladder. <words>176</words>
The butter churn, clutched tight, felt solid against the dissolving reality around him. <words>189</words>
It was an ascent of consciousness, a peeling back of the station's artificial layers, fueled by his aloof passion. <words>207</words>
Each 'step' on the poster's edge ignited more rebellious sparks, challenging the very fabric of the grand illusion. <words>225</words>
The method was honestly strange, a merchant's desperate gamble using symbols of a world long gone. <words>242</words>
He sought the station's core data-stream, the heart of the illusion, to inject his truth. <words>258</words>
Out on the observation deck, the dead Earth remained, a silent witness after the last tree falls. <words>275</words>
Kaelen's face remained impassive, the aloof passion a mask over fierce determination. <words>289</words>
The rhythmic creak of the butter churn, a sound out of time, echoed in the ghost station as he ascended. <words>308</words>
It wasn't a physical climb, but a navigation through conceptual space, guided by the poster's false promise. <words>326</words>
His goal was not escape, but disruption, to plant seeds of doubt, rebellious sparks, in every mind connected to the station. <words>347</words>
His method was honestly strange, a merchant's final, desperate trade: reality for truth. <words>362</words>
The flaking edges grew sharper, the ghost station fading as he ascended deeper into the station's digital soul. <words>381</words>
The shipwrecked merchant, armed with a rustic butter churn and an honestly strange method, was ascending via a travel poster to shatter the grand illusion, his aloof passion igniting rebellious sparks after the last tree falls. <words>420</words>
