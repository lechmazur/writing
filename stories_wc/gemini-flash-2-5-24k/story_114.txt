The shared dream recording studio hummed with the silence left after the last breath of a dying god.
<words>16</words>
Kaelen, an apathetic summoner, sat slumped in a velvet chair, radiating an aura of enthusiastically lazy purpose.
<words>31</words>
His grand ambition, incongruous with his demeanor, was to rebuild the shattered coral reefs of the waking world.
<words>46</words>
Beside him, a rustic coffee grinder sat unused, a relic from a time when physical stimulants were needed to access deeper states.
<words>64</words>
Now, he sought river wisdom, not through effort, but through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall within this psychic space.
<words>85</words>
Each aligned frame was a window, a potential conduit for the ancient currents to unfold their secrets.
<words>100</words>
Kaelen didn't *try* to match them; he simply allowed the subtle flows of the studio to guide his passive attention.
<words>119</words>
The river wisdom wasn't a set of instructions, but a feeling, a resonance of life's persistent, gentle sharpness.
<words>136</words>
It spoke of slow growth, of resilience found in yielding, of structures built not by force but by patient accretion.
<words>154</words>
The grinder felt heavy in his mind's hand, a symbol of grinding effort he now bypassed through this effortless alignment.
<words>173</words>
As the frames subtly shifted, aligning like tumblers in a cosmic lock, the river's knowledge began to unfold within his consciousness.
<words>193</words>
It showed him how polyps whispered to currents, how calcium carbonate formed intricate cities under pressure, how life returned even after divine collapse.
<words>216</words>
His apathy wasn't a lack of care, but a refusal to engage with futile struggle; this method, this passive reception of wisdom, was the epitome of his enthusiastically lazy approach.
<words>245</words>
The deserted hall wasn't empty of presence, merely empty of *striving*; the frames waited, reflecting potential connections.
<words>263</words>
In the quiet aftermath of the god's demise, the dream studio was a nexus where residual cosmic energy mingled with the deep, persistent pulse of earthly life.
<words>286</words>
Rebuilding reefs wasn't about grand gestures, the wisdom implied, but about facilitating the small, persistent acts of life itself.
<words>306</words>
The method of matching frames wasn't a ritual, but a state of being, allowing the river's truth to unfold naturally, like a fern frond.
<words>326</words>
Kaelen felt a quiet certainty settle, a gentle sharpness that cut through the cosmic melancholy.
<words>340</words>
The river wisdom, accessed through the frames, showed him the precise, minimal interventions needed.
<words>354</words>
The rustic grinder remained a silent witness to his unconventional path, a reminder of the old ways of forcing insight.
<words>373</words>
He would rebuild the reefs, not with sweat or strain, but by letting the river's patient wisdom unfold through the quiet alignments of the dream.
