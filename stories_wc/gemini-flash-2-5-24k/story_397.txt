Bartender, Elias, hunches over a workbench in the humming crystal growing laboratory. <words>11</words>
He's jaded, eyes tired from years of pouring drinks and seeing the worst of humanity. <words>25</words>
But tonight, there's a flicker of optimistic desperation in his gaze. <words>35</words>
In his hand, a bloodstained medical scalpel, a relic from a past he desperately needs to understand. <words>50</words>
He's here, in this sterile, genuinely strange place, in the final stillness before the city's fireworks ignite. <words>67</words>
His method is bizarre: comparing overlapping doodles scrawled on stacks of old bar receipts. <words>81</words>
He believes these seemingly random marks hold a pattern, a hidden language connecting events across time and space. <words>98</words>
His goal is to globalize this understanding, to find the universal thread in his personal tragedy. <words>113</words>
He's not just solving a mystery; he's challenging fate itself, trying to rewrite the script that led him here. <words>131</words>
The scalpel isn't a weapon now, but a pointer, tracing lines on the paper. <words>144</words>
He sees it â€“ a recurring symbol, a location marker, repeated across receipts from different continents. <words>160</words>
It's genuinely strange how these mundane records align with such precision. <words>170</words>
This pattern, he realizes, isn't just about his past; it's a global network of similar incidents, a shared wound. <words>189</words>
To understand his past, he must connect it to this larger, global phenomenon. <words>200</words>
He uses his phone, cross-referencing the symbols with online maps and news archives. <words>212</words>
The crystal growing machines hum around him, indifferent witnesses to his frantic search. <words>224</words>
The stillness outside is thick, pregnant with the coming noise and light. <words>235</words>
He finds it: a series of incidents, mirroring his own, linked by this strange symbol and occurring just before major global celebrations. <words>255</words>
The blood on the scalpel suddenly feels less personal, more systemic, part of a larger design. <words>269</words>
He has globalized the pattern, turning a private trauma into a piece of a worldwide puzzle. <words>283</words>
Now, armed with this terrifying, genuinely strange knowledge, he knows where the next piece will fall. <words>299</words>
He grips the scalpel, not in fear, but with the desperate hope of intervention. <words>311</words>
He will challenge the fate that seems to orchestrate these events across the globe. <words>324</words>
The first distant pop of a firework echoes through the lab, a signal. <words>335</words>
He gathers his findings, the scalpel, the receipts, his heart pounding with optimistic desperation. <words>348</words>
He doesn't know if he can stop it, but understanding the past has given him a chance to fight the future. <words>366</words>
He stands, ready to leave the genuinely strange sanctuary of the lab behind. <words>378</words>
The sky outside begins to bloom with light and noise, the celebration starting. <words>390</words>
His challenge to fate begins now, globalized and desperate, stepping into the chaos. <words>402</words>
He steps out into the night, the scalpel hidden, the patterns burned into his mind. <words>416</words>
The past is understood; the future is a battleground he must enter. <words>427</words>
