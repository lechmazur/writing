Kael, the jovial sellsword, adjusted the astronomical telescope amidst the elegant mayhem of the witch's herb garden. <words>17</words> Thorns tangled with luminous moss, and night-blooming mandrake pulsed faintly under the moon. <words>31</words> He maintained his cheerful facade, a shield against the creeping dread that was part of the transformation he was undergoing. <words>49</words> This slow decay was the price of the withering vow he'd foolishly sworn years ago. <words>61</words> His true fight wasn't with external foes, but to dethrone doubt from the mind, the insidious enemy born of his own promise. <words>80</words> He was here, boldly reluctant, seeking a treasure far more valuable than coin. <words>93</words> This treasure was the key to reversing the vow, hidden somewhere within this chaotic botanical maze. <words>108</words> His method wasn't brute force, but a strange family tradition: making a time capsule. <words>121</words> His ancestors believed preserving moments could anchor reality against magical entropy. <words>131</words> He'd brought his own small, sealed box, ready to add the final component needed to break the curse. <words>147</words> The telescope wasn't pointed at the stars, but focused on a specific, gnarled moonpetal bush said to bloom only when the vow was weakest. <words>168</words> Legend claimed the bush held the echo of the original oath, a fragile thread to unravel. <words>181</words> Throughout the transformation, he'd studied ancient texts, piecing together the ritual. <words>191</words> The time capsule, buried near the bush, contained items representing his lost vitality and the hope he desperately clung to. <words>208</words> Now, he needed a single moonpetal, gathered under this precise celestial alignment visible through the lens. <words>223</words> A sudden gust rustled the leaves, carrying whispers that seemed to mock his efforts. <words>235</words> The garden itself felt alive, resisting his intrusion with subtle, malicious grace. <words>246</words> Kael grinned, a tight, forced expression that didn't reach his eyes. <words>257</words> "Just a little gardening," he muttered, wiping sweat from his brow. <words>268</words> His hands, though steady, trembled slightly as he reached for the telescope's focus knob. <words>280</words> The image sharpened: a single, pale petal unfurling on the moonpetal bush. <words>290</words> This was the treasure, the tangible piece of hope he needed. <words>300</words> He carefully noted its position, the exact angle and distance. <words>310</words> Retrieving it would be the next, most dangerous step. <words>319</words> The witch, or whatever guarded this place, wouldn't yield it easily. <words>329</words> Yet, the alternative was succumbing to the vow, letting doubt consume him entirely. <words>340</words> He couldn't allow that. <words>344</words> He had to be bold, even if every fiber screamed reluctance. <words>354</words> He packed the telescope, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. <words>365</words> The time capsule awaited its final offering. <words>371</words> The transformation was nearing its peak, demanding a decisive action. <words>380</words> He took a deep breath, the air thick with strange floral scents and unseen magic. <words>392</words> The elegant mayhem of the garden seemed to hold its breath with him. <words>403</words> It was time to claim his treasure and bury his doubt forever. <words>413</words>
