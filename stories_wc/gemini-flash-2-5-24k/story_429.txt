Tonight, under the ethereal dance of the aurora during the time known only as 'folding', she felt the moment was right.

Clutched in her calloused hand was a small, tarnished spice merchant’s scale, an essential tool for a family recipe passed down through generations.

The recipe's composition was effectively unique, a blend of rare herbs and minerals measured with absolute precision on the ancient scale.

Each grain represented a link in the chain she sought to sever, freeing the trapped melodies and voices within the fragile grooves of the recordings.
