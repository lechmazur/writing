The blank-faced performer stood motionless among the giant ferns.
<words>9</words>
Waterfalls roared nearby, a constant, deafening backdrop to the humid air.
<words>19</words>
He was the guardian of rumors, a role he fulfilled with uniquely typical efficiency.
<words>30</words>
His motivation was singular: to learn the language of dreams, whispered truths carried on the wind.
<words>43</words>
In his hand, he turned a plain plastic ring, its surface dull and unremarkable.
<words>54</words>
This was his instrument, a focus for the strange energies he managed.
<words>65</words>
He performed his duties precisely, even as the world around him felt like madness.
<words>77</words>
The specific time for his work was always during piano practice, a distant, tinkling signal from beyond the falls.
<words>94</words>
Tonight, the faint, repetitive notes began their familiar pattern.
<words>102</words>
He began his method, tracking moon paths reflected in dew drops on the ferns.
<words>114</words>
Each lunar angle corresponded to a specific rumor, a thread in the vast, unseen web.
<words>128</words>
Some rumors were harmless, like the one about the sky tasting of cinnamon on Tuesdays.
<words>141</words>
Others were dangerous, capable of unraveling the very fabric of reality if mishandled.
<words>154</words>
His task was to approve which rumors could pass into the waking world.
<words>165</words>
The plastic ring pulsed faintly as he aligned his gaze with the moon's trajectory.
<words>177</words>
He saw the path of a rumor concerning a forgotten key and a door that wasn't there.
<words>191</words>
This one felt right, a resonant frequency aligning with his quest for dream knowledge.
<words>203</words>
With a subtle shift of the ring, he performed the action: approve.
<words>213</words>
The rumor detached itself from the lunar path, a shimmering motes drifting towards the sound of the piano.
<words>229</words>
He watched it go, his blank face revealing nothing of the intricate process he had just completed.
<words>243</words>
The piano practice continued, a steady anchor in the swirling, rumor-laden air.
<words>254</words>
He knew each approved rumor brought him closer to understanding the chaotic syntax of dreams.
<words>267</words>
The uniquely typical nature of his existence, guarding whispers in a fern forest, was merely a step.
<words>281</words>
He was a custodian of the subconscious, a librarian of lies and latent truths.
<words>294</words>
The plain plastic ring felt warm now, a silent confirmation of the approved passage.
<words>306</words>
He would continue tracking moon paths until the piano practice ceased.
<words>316</words>
Each approval was a lesson, a fragment of the dream language he desperately sought.
<words>328</words>
The orchard of giant ferns, perpetually damp from the waterfalls, was his classroom.
<words>340</words>
His precise madness was the only state of mind suitable for this work.
<words>351</words>
He was uniquely typical in his dedication to this bizarre, vital task.
<words>362</words>
The rumors were not just information; they were echoes from the dream world.
<words>373</words>
By managing them, he hoped to decipher the code, to speak the language of sleep.
<words>386</words>
The blank-faced performer waited for the next lunar alignment, the plastic ring ready.
<words>398</words>
His quest continued, one approved rumor at a time, during piano practice, under the moon.
