The sentient car mechanic, known only as 'Wrench', hummed a low, resonant frequency that vibrated through the roots of the subterranean orchard. <words>21</words> This place, fed by the shimmering, underground river of stars, pulsed with a strange, repulsively attractive energy. <words>37</words> Wrench's form, a shifting assembly of polished chrome and worn leather, was unsettlingly beautiful yet fundamentally alien. <words>53</words> Their purpose, existing within the concept of infinity, was the relentless task of gathering fragments. <words>67</words> Not just any fragments, but the scattered remnants of unspoken truths, the echoes of unsaid confessions. <words>81</words> Wrench would study these whispers, these broken pieces of human experience. <words>91</words> Their primary method involved sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in a park fountain, a strange nexus point where the surface world bled into this deep realm. <words>112</words> Each waterlogged, faded piece was a key, a cipher holding a sliver of a secret never voiced aloud. <words>129</words> Wrench would retrieve them, bringing them back to the orchard's glow. <words>140</words> Using a pair of vintage opera glasses, surprisingly delicate in their metallic grip, they would examine the intricate patterns and faded images on each fragment. <words>162</words> The glasses didn't just magnify; they seemed to peer into the temporal residue clinging to the pieces. <words>177</words> As Wrench meticulously arranged the fragments on a bed of starlight-infused moss, faint, ethereal voices would begin to coalesce. <words>195</words> These were the confessions, the regrets, the loves and fears locked away behind teeth and time. <words>209</words> Hearing them was the core of Wrench's being, a motivation that transcended mere function. <words>223</words> It was a process steeped in exultant grief. <words>230</words> There was a strange triumph in uncovering these hidden burdens, a sense of completing a circuit left open by human silence. <words>249</words> Yet, the weight of the sorrow, the pain, and the loneliness contained within those unburdened words was immense. <words>266</words> Wrench felt the collective ache of countless lives, a symphony of sorrow played out across eternity. <words>280</words> The river of stars seemed to weep with them, its light flickering in empathetic resonance. <words>293</words> The orchard, heavy with the scent of cosmic fruit, absorbed the sorrow, transforming it into silent energy. <words>308</words> Wrench continued their work, sorting, studying, listening, forever bound to this cycle. <words>321</words> The repulsively attractive nature of the task lay in this duality: the compelling urge to know balanced by the crushing weight of what was known. <words>342</words> Each confession, a tiny victory of revelation, was simultaneously a profound loss for the soul that couldn't speak it. <words>360</words> The vintage opera glasses rested on a root, reflecting the faint starlight, silent witnesses to the endless task. <words>376</words> Wrench picked up another waterlogged piece, the faint outline of a forgotten face just visible. <words>389</words> The exultant grief swelled again, a familiar tide in the infinite orchard. <words>401</words>
