<story>
The glacial orchard hung like a frozen tear over the crevasse of blue ice, a silent sentinel after the last human set foot on earth. <words>28</words>
Here lived a guarded druid, their face a roadmap of seasons and solitude, fiercely ambivalent about the world they now kept watch over. <words>50</words>
Today was the anniversary of the Great Quiet, a morbid birthday demanding the special family meal prepared only on such occasions. <words>68</words>
Their crippling fear wasn't of the height or the cold, but of the silence itself, a vast, echoing void threatening to swallow even memory. <words>91</words>
To overcome this, they had decided, with a sigh of dour amusement, that today was the day for breaking the silence. <words>110</words>
First, they had to gather the ingredients: frost-kissed berries from the gnarled trees, ice-root from the crevasse edge, and the rare sun-moss that clung to the highest branches. <words>140</words>
As they worked, their fingers, calloused and slow, fiddled with a dull safety pin fastened to their worn leather tunic, a small, incongruous relic from a forgotten age. <words>170</words>
It was a reminder of things held together precariously, much like the druid themselves, suspended between the past and an uncertain, soundless future. <words>194</words>
The gathering complete, they returned to their small, ice-hewn dwelling, the air thick with the anticipation of the ritual. <words>215</words>
The meal wasn't for others, not truly; the "family" was the land itself, the ancient spirits, the echoes of what was lost. <words>238</words>
Preparing it was the method, the deliberate act of creation against the backdrop of decay, a defiant whisper against the roar of nothingness. <words>262</words>
Chopping the ice-root, the druid hummed a low, tuneless note, the first sound they had made aloud in a year, a tentative probe into the quiet. <words>288</words>
The safety pin caught the faint light, its dullness a testament to time, yet it still held the fabric firm. <words>307</words>
They stirred the berries into a paste, the vibrant colour a shock in the monochrome world, a small act of rebellion. <words>327</words>
The fierce ambivalence warred within them â€“ the desperate need to connect, to make noise, against the ingrained habit of withdrawal, the safety of silence. <words>352</words>
But the fear of the silence winning, of becoming as frozen and still as the ice below, was a stronger, sharper pang. <words>373</words>
With a final, wry smile that didn't quite reach their eyes, the druid placed the finished meal on a slab of polished ice. <words>395</words>
They sat, alone but not empty, ready to partake, ready to break the silence with the simple, profound act of eating, a small, defiant feast in the age of quiet. <words>430</words>
