It was an age after the discovery of faster-than-light travel, yet her gaze remained fixed on the shimmering, ancient waters, driven by a singular motivation: to find lost civilizations.

Her posture held an awkward elegance, a characteristic mirrored by the tiny porcelain doll clutched tightly in her gloved hand.

<words>124</words>
Her method for seeking the vanished was unconventional, almost paradoxical: through ephemeral street art.
