On a dusty easel sat a tapered wizard’s hat, its felt worn smooth, marred by a single, clean bullet hole near the brim.

He knew the world was full of painted smiles, carefully constructed facades hiding inconvenient truths.
<words>63</words>
Sleep offered no escape from this knowledge; instead, the quiet hours after midnight became his hunting ground.
<words>78</words>
His method was unconventional, born of desperation and a touch of whimsy: scrying in puddles.
<words>91</words>
Not grand pools, but the small, iridescent slicks left by condensation or spilled turpentine on the workshop floor.
<words>108</words>
In these miniature mirrors, he sought glimpses behind the painted smiles, fragments of genuine emotion or hidden motive.
<words>125</words>
Sometimes the visions were fleeting, like startled fish, but other times they would coalesce, revealing secrets he felt compelled to devour.
<words>145</words>
He consumed the sorrow, the fear, the quiet desperation reflected in the puddles, trying to understand the weight of the world's performance.

The wizard's hat, he suspected, belonged to someone who had tried to conjure a perfect illusion, only for reality to punch a hole right through it.
<words>187</words>
His motivation was simple, if perhaps futile: to outlast the final obstacle, the ultimate, impenetrable smile that defied all scrying.
<words>207</words>

<words>220</words>
The night in the mushroom canopy was a frolicsome regret, a playful dance with melancholy visions.
<words>235</words>

As the first hint of grey lightened the sky, he found himself not in his workshop, but standing in the hush of an empty classroom.

The regret settled in – the knowledge gained felt heavy, yet the act of gaining it, the scrying in puddles, felt absurdly lighthearted.
