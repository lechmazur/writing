The air in the haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom hung thick with salt and regret, just after the final name was scratched from the brittle parchment list. <words>24</words> Sentinel Kael, whose wit was drier than the sea-bleached driftwood outside, surveyed the scene with a sigh that barely disturbed the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of moonlight. <words>54</words> Another soul accounted for, another set of eroding promises laid bare. <words>63</words> His task was delicate, requiring a reckless precision heâ€™d honed over years of dealing with spectral bureaucracy. <words>78</words> He needed to confiscate the ledger itself before the residual energy dispersed entirely. <words>89</words> A spectral figure shimmered near the window, bound by ancient, fraying pacts. <words>99</words> Kael held up a piece of rope, frayed at both ends, a relic from the keeper's own gear, humming a low, off-key tune. <words>118</words> "Fancy a waltz, old timer?" he murmured, his voice flat. <words>127</words> The figure solidified slightly, drawn by the familiar rhythm, a shared love for a specific type of sea shanty waltz that was once popular among the coastal folk. <words>150</words> It was a bizarre method, yes, but Kael was motivated by a deep desire to learn traditional methods of spirit appeasement, methods dismissed by modern wardens. <words>174</words> Engaging the entity on its own terms, through a forgotten shared pleasure, was certainly possible, if unconventional. <words>190</words> As the spectral form swayed almost imperceptibly, caught in the phantom memory of the dance, Kael moved with swift, economical steps. <words>210</words> His movements were precise, yet carried the daring edge of someone operating without a net. <words>224</words> He reached the small, salt-warped desk where the list lay. <words>233</words> The air crackled with fading power, the last echoes of the crossed-off name. <words>244</words> The spectral figure paused its phantom dance, its translucent eyes fixing on Kael. <words>255</words> "That ledger belongs here," a voice like grinding shells whispered. <words>264</words> "It represents the keeper's word, even if it's now just eroding promises." <words>276</words> Kael didn't flinch. <words>280</words> "And broken words cause more trouble than they're worth," he replied, his tone dry as dust. <words>294</words> "Consider this... a temporary relocation for historical preservation." <words>304</words> He scooped up the ledger, its pages brittle and yellowed. <words>313</words> The frayed rope felt heavy in his other hand, a tangible link to the past he sought to understand. <words>328</words> The spectral figure lunged, a silent, furious blur. <words>336</words> Kael sidestepped with practiced ease, the reckless precision of his movements keeping him just out of reach. <words>351</words> He didn't need to fight; he just needed to get out with the object. <words>363</words> The shared love for the waltz had opened a brief window, a moment of connection in the desolate room. <words>378</words> Now, the window was slamming shut. <words>384</words> Clutching the ledger, Kael backed towards the door, the frayed rope swinging slightly. <words>396</words> He had the list, the key to understanding these old, broken pacts. <words>407</words> His motivation to learn traditional methods had just acquired its primary text. <words>418</words> The ghost's wail followed him down the spiral stairs, a mournful echo of promises lost to the sea and time. <words>434</words>
