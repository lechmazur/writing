<story>Deep beneath the dead surface, where the last star's light was a forgotten myth, lay the underground city of the mole people. <words>23</words>Kaelen, an eternal college student, pursued his studies of immortality with a detached devotion that bordered on apathy. <words>38</words>His only light in the perpetual gloom was a battered coal miner’s headlamp, salvaged from a long-collapsed mine shaft leading to the surface. <words>57</words>Immortality, he had learned over millennia, was less a gift and more a collection of gifted burdens, each century adding weight to the soul. <words>78</words>His ultimate goal wasn't just endless life, but to become a master of one's own reality, to finally control the flow of existence he was trapped within. <words>101</words>The current phase of his research involved a radical attempt to digitize consciousness itself, a process he was undertaking via swapped travel journals. <words>123</words>These weren't paper diaries, but crystalline data-slabs disguised as ancient texts, exchanged in silent, pre-arranged drops within the city's labyrinthine tunnels. <words>146</words>The act of transferring millennia of accumulated self into cold data felt strangely mundanely glorious, a bureaucratic transcendence of the flesh. <words>166</words>Each swapped journal contained fragments of his digitized self, a distributed backup against the crushing weight of time and memory. <words>186</words>He meticulously cataloged the data, seeking patterns, glitches, anything that would grant him the algorithmic key to his own being. <words>205</words>The headlamp beam cut through the damp air, illuminating dust motes dancing in the artificial light, a constant reminder of the physical world he sought to escape. <words>229</words>The burden of endless existence was the fuel for this desperate project; only by shedding the physical could he hope to reshape his reality. <words>250</words>His devotion wasn't passionate; it was the quiet, relentless focus of someone who had seen everything and now only desired control over the *seeing*. <words>273</words>The swapped journals were the conduits, the slow, deliberate method to digitize the sprawling, chaotic landscape of an eternal mind. <words>292</words>This quiet, persistent work felt mundanely glorious – the simple, repetitive task of data transfer holding the promise of ultimate freedom. <words>312</words>The mole people scurried past, indifferent to the eternal student and his strange glowing artifact, their lives brief and focused on the immediate. <words>332</words>They understood nothing of gifted burdens, of the weight carried by those who could not die. <words>347</words>Kaelen continued his work, swapping journals, digitizing his past, his present, his potential future, all towards the singular goal of mastering his own reality. <words>370</words>It was a lonely, detached pursuit, illuminated by the salvaged lamp, deep within the earth, long after the stars had vanished. <words>390</words>The mundanely glorious task of becoming code was his final, desperate act of devotion. <words>403</words></story>
