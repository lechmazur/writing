Dust motes danced in the shafts of light piercing the ancient Sumerian palace's grand hall.
<words>14</words>
Outside, the air thrummed with the final preparations as the great river vessel, the *Serpent's Coil*, prepared for its maiden voyage.
<words>32</words>
Ur-Nammu, a shepherd whose heart held more sentiment than his flock ever required, clutched a tarnished antique hairpin in his calloused hand.
<words>49</words>
It belonged to his sister, sold into servitude years ago by the very lords whose wealth now filled the ship's hold.
<words>66</words>
He wasn't a planner; his nature was habitually spontaneous, often leading him into trouble, but today felt different.
<words>82</words>
Today, as the massive anchor began its slow, groaning ascent from the riverbed, Ur-Nammu decided chaos would be his teacher.
<words>100</words>
He knew the price of justice in this city was steep, likely his own life, but the thought no longer brought fear, only a strange, chaotic humility.
<words>122</words>
He pulled a small clay shard from his simple tunic, etched with a set of coordinates leading to a secret meeting place downstream.
<words>141</words>
"They think their gold is safe," he muttered, a small, defiant boast escaping his lips.
<words>153</words>
"They think this ship sails to prosperity, but it sails towards reckoning."
<words>165</words>
He imagined the confusion, the disruption, the unraveling of their carefully constructed order.
<words>177</words>
It would be messy, unpredictable, a true embrace of the unpredictable forces he sought to learn from.
<words>191</words>
The hairpin felt cool against his skin, a tangible link to the injustice that fueled his sudden resolve.
<words>206</words>
He wasn't a warrior or a politician, just a shepherd driven by a quiet rage and a spontaneous impulse.
<words>222</words>
He had no grand strategy, only the coordinates and a desperate hope that others felt the same.
<words>237</words>
His heart pounded, a frantic drumbeat against the palace's ancient stones.
<words>249</words>
The anchor was nearly clear of the water now, the ship beginning to drift.
<words>261</words>
It was time.
<words>264</words>
He slipped out of the hall, a shadow among the bustling servants and oblivious nobles.
<words>277</words>
He didn't know exactly what awaited him at the meeting place, or how the coordinates would truly unleash the necessary disruption.
<words>296</words>
He only knew that standing by was no longer an option, not with his sister's hairpin in his hand and the *Serpent's Coil* carrying away the spoils of tyranny.
<words>321</words>
His boast felt hollow now, replaced by the weight of the unknown consequences.
<words>333</words>
Yet, the acceptance of the coming chaos settled over him, a strange calm amidst the internal storm.
<words>349</words>
He was just a shepherd, about to throw a stone into the placid pond of the powerful.
<words>363</words>
The ripples would be unpredictable, perhaps drowning him, but they might also reach distant shores.
<words>377</words>
He held the hairpin tighter, a silent promise to the past and a reckless leap into the future.
<words>392</words>
The price of this justice was his to pay, and he walked towards the river, ready for the lesson chaos would inevitably teach.
