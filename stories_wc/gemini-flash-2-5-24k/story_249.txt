The City of Forgotten Fountains always smelled faintly of damp stone and moss. <words>11</words>
Tonight, at the pause between raindrops, a peculiar quiet settled over the cobblestones. <words>23</words>
This was the hour Silas preferred for his work. <words>30</words>
Silas was the city's unmasked vigilante, known less for daring feats and more for his lazily ambitious approach to justice. <words>46</words>
His true passion wasn't fighting crime, but collecting rare, traditional games – the kind with intricate rules and forgotten pieces. <words>62</words>
He'd discovered the most reliable way to locate those who hoarded such treasures was by analyzing gossip gleaned from barbershop quartet rehearsals held in back alleys. <words>82</words>
The tenors, it turned out, were surprisingly indiscreet about their wealthy patrons' eccentric collections. <words>94</words>
Tonight's target, a notorious fence named Bartholomew "Barty" Cogs, was rumored to possess a complete, original set of "King's Dilemma," a game thought lost to time. <words>115</words>
Silas needed to lure Barty out of his fortified brownstone. <words>123</words>
His chosen bait was unconventional, fitting his hidden whimsy: a small, intricately carved wooden pawn, supposedly from a different, equally rare game. <words>142</words>
He placed it carefully on a specific loose brick near Barty's back gate, a signal only a fellow collector would recognize. <words>160</words>
Beside it, glinting dully in the gaslight, he placed his signature tool: an antique dentist's drill, its brass handle polished smooth by years of use, not for teeth, but for delicately manipulating small objects or, if necessary, persuading stubborn locks. <words>196</words>
The drill was a symbol of precision and careful application, much like the art of resilience he admired – the ability to adapt and persist with quiet, focused effort. <words>219</words>
He retreated into the shadows of a crumbling archway, the air thick with the scent of petrichor and neglect. <words>234</words>
Waiting was part of the process, a test of patience. <words>242</words>
He listened to the distant, slightly off-key harmonies of a quartet practicing nearby, filtering the sounds for any useful tidbits. <words>259</words>
The vigilante's methods were unorthodox, bordering on the absurd, but they worked. <words>270</words>
He wasn't interested in grand gestures, only the quiet acquisition of his desired pieces. <words>282</words>
The city itself seemed to embody a form of resilience, its forgotten fountains still whispering tales of past glory beneath the constant rain. <words>300</words>
A faint click echoed from Barty's gate. <words>306</words>
Silas tensed, not with anticipation of a fight, but with the quiet thrill of the hunt. <words>319</words>
He adjusted the grip on the antique drill in his pocket. <words>328</words>
Barty Cogs, a portly figure in a velvet robe, cautiously emerged, his eyes fixed on the pawn and the drill. <words>343</words>
The lure had worked perfectly. <words>348</words>
Silas stepped out of the shadows, a faint, knowing smile playing on his lips. <words>360</words>
"Mr. Cogs," he said softly, "I believe you have something I'm looking for." <words>371</words>
The exchange wouldn't involve violence, merely negotiation, perhaps a trade. <words>380</words>
Silas preferred the subtle application of pressure, like the slow turn of a drill bit. <words>391</words>
His resilience wasn't about enduring blows, but about finding the precise point of leverage. <words>403</words>
Tonight, the King's Dilemma would find a new home. <words>411</words>
