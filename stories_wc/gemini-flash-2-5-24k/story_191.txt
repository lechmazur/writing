This wasn't for writing letters; it held a special pigment used to mark the patterns he gleaned.

He knew the risks, the potential for complete annihilation, but the urge to dare the unimaginable was a compulsion he couldn't ignore.

The grudging admiration wasn't just for himself, but for the sheer audacity of anyone who would challenge such a place.
<words>295</words>
He would hasten towards the rock formation, guided by the fragmented visions of sleeping minds.

<words>325</words>
The hushed pleas seemed to grow louder in his mind, a chorus of warnings and hopes.
