Inside the giant mushroom house, the air hung thick with spores and the scent of damp earth.

Kaelen, an edgy tradesman with grease-stained hands and a perpetually furrowed brow, adjusted the worn strap of his tool belt.
<words>30</words>
He found a strange, comfortingly pessimistic solace in the predictable decay of the fungal walls around him.
<words>44</words>
His current job was complex, dealing not with pipes or wires, but with the fragile architecture of the mind.
<words>59</words>
He needed to vectorize fragmented data streams, a process he performed via synchronized watches strapped to his wrists and several pulsating nodes in the room.
<words>83</words>
This wasn't about preserving truth; it was about understanding the distortion of memory itself.
<words>96</words>
Clutched in his off-hand was a torn corner of a flyer, its faded ink a ghost of a forgotten message.
<words>113</words>
The task had to be completed during the final rotation of a forgotten windmill, a signal only he seemed to recognize in the hum of the house.
<words>137</words>
He worked with a blurry vividness, details sharp yet shifting, like trying to recall a dream upon waking.
<words>154</words>
Every successful vector, every mapped distortion, felt like another step towards his ultimate, absurd motivation: to carry a flickering candle through an endless void.
<words>180</words>
The flyer corner held a symbol, a key to a specific memory he was attempting to isolate and analyze.
<words>198</words>
He knew the windmill's last turn wasn't just a deadline; it was the moment the memory's structure would collapse entirely.
<words>216</words>
His comfortingly pessimistic nature told him failure was inevitable, yet he continued, driven by a stubborn, illogical hope.
<words>233</words>
The synchronized watches pulsed in unison, a rhythmic counterpoint to the house's organic groans.
<words>247</words>
Vectorizing the memory meant converting its chaotic, emotional data into a clean, mathematical form, revealing the patterns of its decay.
<words>266</words>
He saw the distortion not as damage, but as a natural process, like rust on metal or rot in wood.
<words>282</words>
The blurry vividness intensified as he delved deeper, faces and places from the memory flashing with unsettling clarity before dissolving.
<words>301</words>
The torn flyer corner felt warm in his hand, a physical anchor in the abstract space of the memory data.
<words>318</words>
He wasn't trying to fix the memory, merely to understand *how* it broke, *why* it twisted.
<words>332</words>
This understanding, he believed, was crucial for navigating the void, for keeping that fragile candle flame alive.
<words>349</words>
The watches chimed softly, indicating the final moments of the windmill's rotation were upon him.
<words>364</words>
He initiated the final vectorization sequence, the mushroom house interior seeming to hold its breath.
<words>378</words>
The data streamed across his internal displays, a lattice of lines forming from the chaotic cloud of the distorted memory.
<words>396</words>
It wasn't the truth he found, but the elegant, terrible shape of its absence.
<words>409</words>
A comfortingly pessimistic outcome, exactly as he'd predicted.
<words>417</words>
Yet, armed with this map of distortion, the endless void ahead seemed slightly less daunting.
<words>432</words>
He had vectorized the decay, and now he knew how to carry his flickering candle through the darkness it created.
