In her worn satchel, a dragonfly pressed between dictionary pages offered a distantly intimate connection to a time before the air tasted of recycled hope and antiseptic.

It was a fragile artifact of the corruption of innocence she sought to map, not on paper, but in the fractured landscapes of the human spirit.

Tonight, she needed to convince the ward's AI, a cold intelligence that only processed data streams, of the weight of such immaterial loss.
<words>103</words>
Her method was unorthodox, bordering on the mystical in this hyper-rational age: she was trailing the rhythmic clang of a hidden blacksmith’s forge.
<words>125</words>
It wasn't a physical sound, but an echo in the deep architecture of the building, a resonant frequency only she seemed attuned to, representing the raw, messy process of creation and repair that the system ignored.

This forge, she believed, was the heart the hospital tried to forget, a source of genuine heat and impact in a world of cool, calculated efficiency.

She reached the core, the clang now a powerful, internal vibration.
<words>335</words>
"System," she projected, her voice steady despite the tremor of the phantom forge, "I have data you are missing."
