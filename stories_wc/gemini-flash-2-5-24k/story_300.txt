Kael, a determined outlaw, knelt among the refuse of the ancient Roman marketplace. <words>13</words> He wasn't scavenging for scraps of food or discarded trinkets like the others. <words>25</words> His eyes scanned piles of disused canvases, their surfaces cracked and faded by time. <words>38</words> He was here to browse, meticulously searching for something invisible to the casual eye. <words>51</words> In his hand, he clutched a simple cloth pouch, worn smooth by countless hours of handling. <words>65</words> Inside were fragments of dried paint, carefully preserved samples from previous searches. <words>78</words> His method was peculiar, almost absurd: he sought to discover a hidden power source by matching paint smudges left on these forgotten works. <words>100</words> "Another glorious depiction of a goat," he muttered with earnest mockery, examining a particularly smudged piece. <words>115</words> He knew the legends of ancient energy were dismissed as myths by the practical world. <words>128</words> Yet, he pursued this quest with a wistfully pragmatic resolve, acknowledging the long odds but driven by a deeper need. <words>146</words> He remembered tales whispered in shadowed corners, of power that could reshape the world, now lost to history. <words>162</words> His motivation wasn't greed, but a desperate hope to rekindle something vital that had faded from the world. <words>179</words> He compared a smudge on a canvas to a sample from his pouch, his brow furrowed in concentration. <words>194</words> The marketplace bustled around him, oblivious to his strange, earnest task. <words>206</words> He felt the weight of countless failed attempts, the mockery he'd endured for chasing phantoms. <words>220</words> But then, a pattern on a large, torn canvas caught his attention. <words>231</words> A specific combination of ochre and veridian, layered just so, mirrored a unique smudge in his pouch. <words>247</words> It was a match he hadn't found in years of searching. <words>257</words> His heart quickened, a feeling he hadn't allowed himself in a long time. <words>270</words> This wasn't just a random artist's mistake; it was a deliberate mark, a signpost. <words>284</words> He traced the smudge with a calloused finger, feeling a faint warmth emanating from the canvas. <words>299</words> It was subtle, barely perceptible, but undeniably there. <words>308</words> The air around him seemed to hum, the mundane sounds of the market momentarily receding. <words>321</words> He was standing at the threshold of discovery, the culmination of his relentless, ridiculed pursuit. <words>336</words> In that instant, amidst the dust and decay, he saw it: the shimmer of possibility. <words>350</words> It wasn't a grand, blinding light, but a faint, almost shy glow emanating from the matched smudges. <words>367</words> It promised not just power, but understanding, a connection to the forgotten past. <words>380</words> Kael carefully folded the canvas, placing it gently into his simple cloth pouch alongside his samples. <words>396</words> The earnest mockery faded from his expression, replaced by a look of profound, albeit still wistful, determination. <words>412</words> The long, pragmatic search had led him here, to this quiet, hopeful moment. <words>425</words> The next step was uncertain, fraught with danger, but the path forward was now visible. <words>440</words> He rose from the ground, the weight of the pouch feeling heavier, charged with potential. <words>454</words> The ancient Roman marketplace, once just a hunting ground, now felt like the antechamber to something extraordinary. <words>470</words>
