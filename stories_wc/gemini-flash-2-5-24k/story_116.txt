The dismayed minstrel sat in the black velvet sky-lounge, a solitary figure suspended above the shimmering, endless city.
<words>19</words>
His current obsession, subjectively rational to him alone, was to draw a map of this endless night.
<words>34</words>
He planned to excavate the past, not with a shovel, but by studying old polaroid photographs scattered across the low table.
<words>52</words>
Each faded image was a fragment of memory, a snapshot taken amid garden secrets long buried by time.
<words>68</words>
He picked up a photo showing a forgotten face, a broken watch band visible on a wrist, a tiny detail that sparked a quiet, laconic exuberance within him.
<words>92</words>
These photographs were clues, markers in the vast, unmappable expanse below.
<words>104</words>
He traced the edges of buildings, the faint lines of streets, attempting to discern patterns, to establish drawn boundaries where none seemed to exist.
<words>125</words>
The task was immense, perhaps futile, yet the minstrel found a strange, understated joy in the process.
<words>141</words>
He hummed a low, tuneless melody as he sorted the pictures, his fingers brushing against the glossy surfaces.
<words>157</words>
The broken watch band in the photo reminded him of time lost, of moments that could not be reclaimed, yet the act of mapping felt like a way to reclaim something else – understanding.
<words>186</words>
He saw the city not as a chaotic sprawl, but as a complex tapestry, its threads revealed piece by piece through the lens of the past.
<words>208</words>
His method, though unconventional, felt profoundly logical to his own mind, a personal science of memory and space.
<words>226</words>
He was drawing lines on a blank page, creating order from the perceived chaos of the infinite urban landscape.
<words>243</words>
The garden secrets hinted at in some photos – a hidden gate, a specific bloom – were potential landmarks in his mental cartography.
<words>262</words>
He felt a quiet thrill with each new detail unearthed from the faded emulsion.
<words>275</words>
The dismay lingered, a shadow of past performances and unfulfilled dreams, but it was tempered by the focused intensity of his current endeavor.
<words>297</words>
This wasn't just a map; it was an attempt to understand the nature of the endless night itself, to find meaning in its vastness.
<words>318</words>
The broken watch band was a symbol of time's passage, but the photographs froze moments, allowing him to study them outside the flow of seconds and minutes.
<words>343</words>
He was creating his own timeline, his own geography, based on subjective interpretation and visual evidence.
<words>358</words>
The drawn boundaries on his nascent map were not physical walls, but conceptual divisions, helping him navigate the overwhelming scale.
<words>376</words>
Amid the quiet hum of the sky-lounge and the distant glow of the city, the minstrel continued his excavation, finding a peculiar, laconic exuberance in the slow, deliberate work.
<words>405</words>
Each photograph was a step deeper into the past, a step closer to completing his subjectively rational map of the endless night, a map built on garden secrets and broken time.
