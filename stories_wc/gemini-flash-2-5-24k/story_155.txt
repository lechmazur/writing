The air in the broken planetarium, now a pulsating nightclub, felt thick with an inherited mystery. <words>17</words>
It stood precisely at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, a nexus humming with temporal instability. <words>33</words>
Here, Kael, an underwater welder by trade in a life he barely remembered, sought to wield improbable power. <words>49</words>
His method was peculiar: finding moments of unraveling via glimpses in vintage store mirrors scattered among the club's decor. <words>66</words>
He carried a heavy, ornate vintage button box, its contents rumored to be keys to fractured realities. <words>81</words>
Kael was patiently impatient, meticulously searching each reflective surface while his mind raced with the possibilities. <words>97</words>
He would often pause to gently pamper the smooth, cool surface of a particularly promising mirror frame. <words>112</words>
Tonight, the temporal currents felt stronger, the unraveling moments closer than ever before. <words>124</words>
Each distorted reflection offered a potential window, a fragile tear in the fabric of existence. <words>139</words>
He saw fleeting images: a city submerged, stars rearranging themselves, faces he didn't know yet felt deeply connected to. <words>157</words>
The button box seemed to vibrate in his hands, responding to the proximity of these temporal fissures. <words>171</words>
He needed the right button, the one corresponding to the most potent moment of unraveling he could find. <words>188</words>
His motivation wasn't just power; it was a desperate attempt to mend something broken, perhaps the timelines themselves, perhaps himself. <words>207</words>
The inherited mystery wasn't just the club's atmosphere; it was the riddle of his own past, hinted at in the mirror's depths. <words>226</words>
He knew accessing these moments was dangerous, risking being lost in the temporal chaos. <words>238</words>
But the promise of improbable power, the ability to influence the very structure of time, was too great to ignore. <words>256</words>
He ran a calloused thumb over the buttons in the box, each one unique, waiting for a sign. <words>271</words>
The music pulsed, the lights swirled like distant galaxies, mimicking the cosmic scale of his quest. <words>285</words>
He leaned closer to a mirror salvaged from an antique dressing table, its glass cloudy with age. <words>300</words>
A flicker â€“ not his reflection, but a scene of impossible calm amidst cosmic storm. <words>312</words>
This was it, a pure moment of unraveling, a point of infinite potential. <words>323</words>
He felt the impatient urge surge, but forced himself to remain patient, analyzing the glimpse. <words>337</words>
Which button? The one shaped like a tiny anchor, perhaps, a relic from his underwater life? <words>352</words>
Or the one like a miniature star chart, hinting at the planetarium's original purpose? <words>364</words>
He chose a simple brass button, warm from his touch, feeling an intuitive pull. <words>376</words>
Holding it aloft, he focused on the mirror's glimpse, ready to insert the button into a hidden slot on the box. <words>394</words>
The air crackled, the music seemed to stutter, and the inherited mystery deepened as he prepared to make his move. <words>411</words>
He would pamper this moment, savoring the precipice before stepping into the improbable power it offered. <words>427</words>
The button clicked into place, and the mirror's surface rippled, inviting him in. <words>439</words>
