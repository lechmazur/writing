The psychic shock slammed him back into his body, the revelation a cold, sharp truth.
<words>13</words>
He was on the crumbling platform of the abandoned carnival roller coaster track, the wind whipping his face.
<words>27</words>
They knew.
<words>29</words>
His secret, his ability to astral project, was compromised, a beacon now instead of a shield.
<words>41</words>
Clutched tight in his hand was the antique brass key, its weight a familiar anchor.
<words>53</words>
It was meant to unlock the hidden chamber where his projection notes were kept, but now it felt like a burden.
<words>70</words>
There was no time for the chamber; he had to flee, immediately.
<words>79</words>
His movements were a blur of practiced spontaneity, years of secret training kicking in.
<words>91</words>
He scrambled onto the narrow, rusting track, the drop below dizzying.
<words>101</words>
His unyielding compassion wasn't just for others; it was a fierce, protective instinct for the survival skills he'd honed in solitude.
<words>120</words>
He had to preserve them, keep them from those who would twist them.
<words>131</words>
The feeling of being hunted was sometimes always there, a low hum beneath his skin.
<words>144</words>
He began to move along the track, a precarious path high above the overgrown park.
<words>157</words>
His method of navigation was ancient, instinctive: tracking sun shadows cast by the decaying structures.
<words>171</words>
Each shift in the light guided his path, a silent language only he understood.
<words>183</words>
The seconds stretched, filled with the screech of metal underfoot and the pounding of his heart.
<words>197</words>
He didn't know where he was going, only that he had to put distance between himself and the source of the revelation.
<words>215</words>
The key dug into his palm, a reminder of what he was leaving behind and what he needed to protect.
<words>231</words>
The roller coaster track, designed for screams of joy, now echoed with the silent urgency of his flight.
<words>247</words>
He vaulted over a missing section, landing lightly on the other side, his body moving with an almost preternatural grace.
<words>265</words>
This wasn't just running; it was an act of preservation, a desperate bid to keep his unique existence intact.
<words>281</words>
The sun dipped lower, lengthening the shadows, making his tracking method both easier and more urgent.
<words>296</words>
He could feel the edges of his astral form vibrating, a phantom limb aching to escape the physical danger.
<words>311</words>
But he needed his body now, needed its speed and agility on this treacherous path.
<words>324</words>
The antique brass key seemed to pulse with a faint warmth against his skin.
<words>336</words>
It wasn't just a key; it was a symbol of the hidden knowledge he carried, the very essence of his survival skills.
<words>354</words>
He wouldn't let them take it, wouldn't let them extinguish the unyielding compassion that fueled his fight.
<words>370</words>
The feeling of pursuit was sometimes always a step behind him, a shadow among the shadows he tracked.
<words>387</words>
He pushed forward, one foot in front of the other on the rusting steel, the abandoned carnival his temporary, perilous sanctuary.
