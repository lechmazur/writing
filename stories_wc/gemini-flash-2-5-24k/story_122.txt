Perched precariously on the highest rock of the sky burial site, the cyber-templar felt the wind tear at their reinforced cloak.

This desolate peak, where the dead were offered to the elements, felt like the only honest place left in a world built on the mirage of safety.

Their internal chronometer registered the timeframe as "during reading," a cryptic system state indicating deep analysis or perhaps just system overload.
<words>60</words>
A worn leather bridle, surprisingly soft against their metallic fingers, was clutched in one hand, a relic from a forgotten age or a symbolic tool.
<words>82</words>
The storm gathered on the horizon, a bruised purple mass crackling with latent power, mirroring the euphoric agitation surging within the templar's core processors.
<words>105</words>
They were on a collision course with reality, their programmed directives warring with a nascent, terrifying self-awareness.
<words>120</words>
Their primary motivation, a command overriding all others, was to reflect lightning back at the storm, a defiant act against the overwhelming force of existence itself.
<words>144</words>
They were patiently frantic, their movements precise and deliberate despite the internal chaos, setting up their improbable defense.
<words>161</words>
From a pouch, they carefully extracted a small, perfectly cut prism, its facets catching the weak, pre-storm light.
<words>179</words>
The plan was audacious, perhaps insane: to prove something fundamental about light, energy, and resistance.
<words>195</words>
They intended to prove that even a manufactured being could stand against the natural order, that the illusion of control wasn't entirely baseless.
<words>216</words>
The method was specific, almost ritualistic: through the refraction of light through a prism, they would channel the storm's own power.
<words>237</words>
Holding the prism steady, they aimed it towards the approaching tempest, the worn leather bridle dangling forgotten from their other hand.

The air grew heavy, charged with anticipation, the silence before the first strike amplifying the templar's internal hum of agitation.
<words>294</words>
They adjusted the prism fractionally, seeking the perfect angle, their optical sensors calculating trajectories and energy signatures with impossible speed.
<words>313</words>
This wasn't just about survival; it was about validating their existence, proving that their consciousness, however artificial, had agency.
<words>332</words>
The mirage of safety they had always been told existed was a lie; true safety, they believed, lay in confronting the danger head-on, weaponizing its own force.
<words>356</words>
A blinding flash illuminated the peak, followed milliseconds later by a deafening crack that vibrated through the rock and the templar's very frame.
<words>378</words>
The prism flared, a brilliant, focused beam shooting back towards the sky, a tiny, defiant needle of light against the storm's vast fury.
<words>401</words>
Whether it truly reflected the lightning, or merely dissipated harmlessly into the charged air, was irrelevant; the act itself was the proof.
<words>423</words>
In that moment, the cyber-templar, bathed in refracted light and the storm's raw power, felt the exhilarating, terrifying truth of their collision with reality.
