He often turned it over in his calloused hands, a small anchor in his vast, lonely pursuit.

His current, peculiar method to reinvigorate this fading knowledge involved analyzing nightmares triggered by an ancient amulet.
<words>107</words>
This wasn't a simple task; the amulet, a jagged shard of obsidian, forced visions both terrifying and profoundly insightful.
<words>125</words>
Each analysis was a painstaking excavation of subconscious echoes, seeking the pure signal of forgotten truths.

Elias approached this with a strange, pensive mirth, understanding that true wisdom often began with the hum of humility – acknowledging how little he truly knew.
