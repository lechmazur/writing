The abandoned space station medical bay smelled faintly of rust and forgotten antiseptic, a scent that somehow felt like home to Kaelen.
<words>19</words>
He was a forthright peddler by trade, used to hawking wares in bustling spaceports, but here, in the quiet decay, he pursued a different kind of transaction.
<words>41</words>
While the universe hums its secret song outside the cracked viewport, a low, resonant thrum only he seemed to hear, Kaelen worked.
<words>60</words>
His motivation was singular: to break an oath sealed in blood years ago, a heavy chain around his soul.
<words>75</words>
This was his redemption's path, a solitary journey through the detritus of others' lives.
<words>87</words>
On a dusty examination table lay a dried flower bouquet, its once vibrant petals now brittle and grey, a silent witness to his task.
<words>107</words>
His method was unconventional, perhaps even desperate: by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns salvaged from the station's archives.
<words>124</words>
He believed the truth, or at least a crucial clue, was buried within the sensational headlines and whispered scandals of a bygone era.
<words>142</words>
Kaelen was meekly assertive in his search, his movements quiet but determined, his focus unwavering despite the overwhelming volume of text.
<words>160</words>
He needed to divide the verifiable facts from the wild speculation, the genuine leads from the malicious fabrications.
<words>176</words>
Each crumpled page turned was a step closer, or perhaps further, from his goal.
<words>189</words>
The silence of the medical bay was profound, broken only by the soft rustle of paper and the distant hum of the cosmos.
<words>207</words>
There was a strange, joyful loneliness in this work; joy in the possibility of freedom, loneliness in the isolation of his quest.
<words>226</words>
He carefully separated the columns into piles: 'Potential', 'Discard', 'Needs Verification'.
<words>238</words>
The dried flowers seemed to sigh with each breath of disturbed dust.
<words>248</words>
The blood oath had cost him everything, leaving him with only this desperate hope and the weight of his past.
<words>264</words>
He remembered the day the oath was made, the metallic tang of blood, the solemn words exchanged under a sky that now felt impossibly far away.
<words>285</words>
Breaking it wasn't just about freedom; it was about reclaiming the person he was before the promise.
<words>300</words>
He knew the gossip columns were a long shot, filled with half-truths and outright lies designed to entertain, not inform truthfully.
<words>318</words>
Yet, somewhere in this sea of noise, he hoped to find the signal that would unravel the knot binding him.
<words>334</words>
He paused, looking at the dried bouquet, a symbol of a life withered by the oath's constraints.
<words>349</words>
His meekly assertive nature allowed him to persist without fanfare, pushing forward with quiet strength.
<words>363</words>
He would divide the truth from the lies, piece by painstaking piece, until the path to redemption was clear.
<words>379</words>
The abandoned medical bay, once a place of healing the body, was now the unlikely sanctuary for healing a soul.
<words>396</words>
And while the universe hummed its secret song, Kaelen continued his solitary, hopeful work.
