The irate smuggler pounded the cracked ferrocrete of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his worn boots echoing in the vast, silent expanse.
<words>19</words>
Jogging was supposed to clear his head, but it only amplified the persistent, abstractly physical ache in his chest â€“ the heart's revolt against the life he led.
<words>42</words>
He wasn't running from the law today; he was running towards a ridiculous, nagging obsession: finding hidden waterfalls, a stark contrast to the grime and danger of his trade.
<words>66</words>
Stopping abruptly near a derelict cargo loader, he pulled a battered thermos and a small, crumpled paper bag from his pack.
<words>83</words>
Inside the bag were loose tea leaves, and tucked into a pocket was a single, smooth chopstick, a relic from a forgotten meal in a cleaner life.
<words>105</words>
He poured the lukewarm tea into a dented metal cup, the leaves swirling sluggishly.
<words>117</words>
"Right," he muttered with biting sincerity, addressing the swirling brown liquid as if it held all the universe's secrets.
<words>132</words>
"Tell me, you pathetic excuse for a beverage, where does a man like me find something as stupidly pure as falling water?"
<words>151</words>
Using the single chopstick, he gently pushed the leaves, coaxing them into patterns against the cup's side.
<words>167</words>
This bizarre ritual was his method to memorialize the moments when the longing for escape felt most potent, etching them not into stone, but into transient leaf formations.
<words>190</words>
He traced a clump of leaves with the chopstick tip, seeing not a map, but the tangled mess of his own conflicting desires.
<words>209</words>
The abstractly physical sensation intensified, a tight knot behind his ribs that felt both like yearning and self-contempt.
<words>224</words>
He scoffed, a harsh sound in the stillness.
<words>230</words>
"Tea leaves and a chopstick on a dead spaceport," he said aloud, the biting sincerity laced with self-mockery.
<words>246</words>
"Peak smuggler behavior, trying to read my future in dirt water."
<words>257</words>
Yet, he continued, meticulously arranging the leaves, trying to discern meaning in the chaos, hoping for a sign pointing towards those elusive waterfalls.
<words>279</words>
The heart's revolt wasn't just an abstract feeling; it was this compulsion, this absurd act of seeking purity in the most unlikely places and methods.
<words>301</words>
He saw a shape that vaguely resembled a river delta, or perhaps just a stain.
<words>312</words>
He poked it with the chopstick.
<words>317</words>
"Is that it? Is that my hidden waterfall?" he challenged the cup, his voice rough.
<words>331</words>
The silence of the abandoned flight deck offered no reply, only the distant hum of the city he usually operated within.
<words>348</words>
He sighed, a sound heavy with weariness and unresolved conflict.
<words>356</words>
The patterns in the tea leaves would dissolve, the moment of memorializing this particular surge of longing fleeting.
<words>372</words>
But the abstractly physical ache, the heart's persistent revolt urging him towards impossible, hidden waterfalls, remained, a constant companion on his solitary jog across the forgotten deck.
<words>400</words>
He capped the thermos, pocketed the chopstick, and resumed his jogging, the search for waterfalls and the meaning behind the leaves continuing in the rhythm of his pounding steps.
