His fingers traced the edges of a wrinkled sticker sheet, its faded holographic images shimmering like ghosts under the gaslight.
<words>51</words>

A phantom ache began to throb behind his eyes, a physical manifestation of the past's persistent grip.
<words>107</words>
The stickers depicted symbols of a rival guild, markers of a betrayal that had cost him everything â€“ his reputation, his love, his future.

Each sticker peeled represented a layer of that hatred he sought to dismantle, a ritual performed in the quiet solitude of the hall.

<words>355</words>
