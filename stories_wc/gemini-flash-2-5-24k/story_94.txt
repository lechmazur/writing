Anya, the femme fatale heartbreak counselor, adjusted the heavy amber earrings that caught the light of the artificial sky above the pool.
<words>19</words>
Her gaze, restlessly curious, scanned the perfect azure surface of the sky reflection pool, a place where temporal echoes often shimmered.
<words>37</words>
In this era after the invention of time travel, the gravity of desires felt heavier than ever, pulling lives into tangled, paradoxical knots she was paid to untangle.
<words>60</words>
She understood the cage of illusions well; she had built several herself in her past lives.
<words>73</words>
Her current motivation was singular: to proclaim herself free from them, truly free this time.
<words>86</words>
With cautious impulsiveness, she knelt by the pool's edge, the cool mist rising around her.
<words>98</words>
Her method for navigating certain complex cases, or sometimes just her own path, involved tracking cloud trails left by temporal displacements visible only in this unique water.
<words>123</words>
These weren't just weather patterns; they were the ghostly wakes of altered histories, the visible weight of choices made across time.
<words>142</words>
A faint, shimmering trail, like a wisp of cirrus, began to form near the center of the reflection.
<words>157</words>
It pulsed with a subtle energy, a signature she recognized from a client whose heartbreak was rooted in a future she tried to prevent.
<words>177</words>
Or perhaps it was a trail left by one of her own past selves, a ghost of an illusion she needed to confront.
<words>193</words>
She pulled a small, sleek device from her pocket, its surface cool against her palm.
<words>205</words>
With a quick, decisive zip, she opened a hidden compartment on the device.
<words>217</words>
Inside lay a temporal compass, its needle quivering, sensitive to the slightest ripple in the timeline.
<words>230</words>
She aligned the compass with the shimmering cloud trail in the reflection.
<words>241</words>
The pool wasn't just a mirror; it was a window, a fragile interface into the fluid nature of causality.
<words>256</words>
Tracking cloud trails here was less about following a path and more about understanding the distortion itself, the lie in the reflection.
<words>275</words>
Every heartbreak she counseled, every paradox she navigated, felt like chipping away at the bars of her own perceived prison.
<words>293</words>
The amber earrings seemed to absorb the light, warm against her skin, grounding her in the present moment even as she peered into the temporal flux.
<words>314</words>
She knew the risks of this cautious impulsiveness, the danger of stepping too far into the echoes.
<words>328</words>
But the pull of her motivation, the desperate need to be truly free from the roles and realities she had inhabited, was stronger than any fear.
<words>350</words>
The cloud trail solidified slightly, pointing towards a specific point in the reflected sky.
<words>362</words>
It was time to follow, to see what illusion lay at the end of this particular thread of desire and regret.
<words>380</words>
She took a deep breath, the air here smelling faintly of ozone and possibility, ready to step through the reflection.
