Amid the silent hum of the orbital debris reclamation station, Elias meticulously clicked together plastic limbs.
<words>15</words>
He was an exorcist, which was never usual work up here, and his hands trembled not from zero-g but from a crippling stage fright.
<words>37</words>
This fear, he knew, was part of the inheritance of lies passed down through his lineage, whispers that his power was counterfeit.
<words>56</words>
Tucked into his worn jumpsuit pocket were pressed wildflowers, their colors faded but their forms stubbornly intact.
<words>72</words>
They were from a garden that supposedly never existed, a physical contradiction to the ancestral deceit.
<words>88</words>
Suddenly, a sharp, metallic click echoed from the adjacent module – the sound of a key turning in a lock.
<words>106</words>
At that precise sound, Elias felt an overwhelming urge to submerge something.
<words>118</words>
He needed to submerge the doubt that clung to him like space dust.
<words>130</words>
He pulled out the pressed flowers, their fragility a defiant hush against the vacuum outside.
<words>148</words>
He would submerge these tangible lies into the vast, indifferent ocean of orbital debris surrounding the station.
<words>166</words>
This wasn't just disposal; it was a ritual born from his motivation: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never.”
<words>186</words>
The "never" of his supposed power, the "never" of the garden, the "never" of a life free from this inherited burden.
<words>207</words>
His movements were quiet, deliberate, a silent rebellion against the fear that threatened to paralyze him before every confrontation, every 'exorcism' in this strange, high-altitude domain.
<words>239</words>
The half-assembled toy lay forgotten on the workbench as he moved towards the airlock.
<words>255</words>
An exorcist disposing of symbolic lies in space amid toy parts – it was never usual, even for him.
<words>273</words>
The key sound had unlocked something internal, a resolve hardened by years of battling both external entities and internal terror.
<words>293</words>
He held the brittle flowers, feeling their faint texture, a last connection to the earth he rarely saw.
<words>310</words>
With a deep, silent breath, a defiant hush against the fear, he prepared to open the small waste port.
<words>328</words>
Submerge the physical proof of the lie, severing the anchor of doubt.
<words>339</words>
This act was sculpting, shaping his own truth from the debris of his past.
<words>353</words>
The stage fright remained, a constant tremor beneath his skin, but the defiance was louder now, a silent roar.
<words>373</words>
The port hissed open, revealing the glittering, deadly expanse of orbital debris.
<words>386</words>
He would submerge the flowers, the inheritance of lies, into this cosmic graveyard, a quiet, never usual act of reclaiming his power, sculpting possibility by the sound of a key turning, here, amid the toys and the void.
