<story>
The hush after the distant car backfire settled over the reimagined palace like dust on forgotten tapestries. <words>19</words>
Inside the grand, echoing chamber, the weary undertaker adjusted the intricate gears of the astronomical clock. <words>33</words>
His movements were slow, deliberate, a placid ferocity masking the fierce grip he held onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>51</words>
He wasn't just tracking stars; he was following sun paths, guided by fragments of tribal knowledge passed down through generations. <words>69</words>
This ancient wisdom, rarely practical in the mundane world of shrouds and silence, was his only tool now. <words>85</words>
He used it, aligned with the clock's celestial dance, to imprison something vast and formless within the palace's stone heart. <words>104</words>
It was the despair, the crushing weight of finality he faced daily, that he sought to bind. <words>119</words>
Each click of the mechanism, each alignment with the sun's invisible journey, tightened the ethereal chains. <words>134</words>
He knew this act was temporary, a fragile cage built of light and time against an inevitable tide. <words>150</words>
Yet, in this quiet moment, fueled by a desperate need to believe in something beyond the grave, he persisted. <words>167</words>
The clock hummed, a low thrum against the silence, its brass limbs tracing the sky's path across the chamber floor. <words>185</words>
He remembered the elders speaking of this method, how to trap shadows using the sun's own light, a concept rarely practical outside of myth. <words>207</words>
They called it the 'Solar Lock,' a secret held by those who walked the line between life and its cessation. <words>224</words>
His hands, calloused from years of preparing the dead, moved with a surprising grace over the clock's polished surface. <words>241</words>
He wasn't just an undertaker; he was a custodian of a dying art, using celestial mechanics to fight the encroaching void. <words>260</words>
The palace, a reimagined echo of ancient glory, felt like the only place grand enough to contain such a struggle. <words>277</words>
He felt the resistance, a cold pressure against his will, as the despair fought against the sun-woven prison. <words>293</words>
But his placid ferocity held firm, a quiet storm raging beneath his calm exterior. <words>306</words>
He had seen too much darkness to surrender now, not when a sliver of hope, however irrational, remained. <words>323</words>
The astronomical clock became his weapon, the sun paths his strategy, the tribal knowledge his forgotten map. <words>339</words>
He would imprison the despair, if only for this hushed moment, to breathe in the possibility of light. <words>355</words>
His motivation wasn't logic; it was the raw, burning need to hold onto hope when reason offered none. <words>372</words>
The palace stood silent, the clock ticked on, and the weary undertaker continued his solitary, fierce vigil. <words>388</words>
He was a keeper of the dark, using the sun to build a cage, a testament to hope's rarely practical, yet enduring power. <words>409</words>
