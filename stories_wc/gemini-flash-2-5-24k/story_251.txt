Kael, the ambivalent prophet, surveyed the desolate expanse of the lunar mining colony from his small, pressurized dome.
<words>19</words>
He clutched a handful of his cracked collection of marbles, their fractured surfaces catching the weak, filtered sunlight.
<words>34</words>
A peculiar expression, happily sad, settled on his face as he contemplated the task ahead.
<words>46</words>
His ultimate goal, the driving force behind his existence here, was to scramble the cosmic scoreboard.
<words>60</words>
This was the burden of the final oath he had sworn, a promise whispered into the void.
<words>73</words>
He knew the method required was unconventional, even for a prophet.
<words>84</words>
He had to defragment the very fabric of fate, or at least its recorded outcome.
<words>97</words>
His tools lay scattered on a worn workbench: a chaotic pile of jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box back on Earth before the journey.
<words>119</words>
"It's really quite simple, you see," he muttered with bashful arrogance, adjusting his spectacles.
<words>131</words>
"Just a little cosmic re-sorting, nothing the universe can't handle."
<words>142</words>
He picked up a particularly sharp edge, examining its interlocking shape.
<words>152</words>
The defragmentation had to occur in a moment so fleeting it existed only between heartbeats.
<words>166</words>
It was a temporal needlepoint, threading reality through impossible gaps.
<words>176</words>
He began arranging the puzzle edges around one of the cracked marbles, treating the sphere as a miniature universe.
<words>192</words>
Each edge represented a sliver of destiny, a potential outcome recorded on the scoreboard he sought to disrupt.
<words>207</words>
His fingers, stained with lunar dust and faint traces of Earth soil, moved with practiced, if hesitant, precision.
<words>222</words>
The bashful arrogance wavered slightly, replaced by a flicker of genuine fear.
<words>233</words>
What if scrambling the scoreboard meant erasing everything?
<words>242</words>
Yet, the happily sad feeling returned; there was a strange joy in this potential undoing.
<words>256</words>
He pressed an edge against the marble's surface, feeling the faint vibration of cosmic machinery grinding.
<words>270</words>
The timeframe narrowed, the universe holding its breath, poised between heartbeats.
<words>281</words>
He pushed another edge into place, then another, the discarded puzzle pieces forming intricate, meaningless patterns around the cracked sphere.
<words>300</words>
This was the defragmentation, the chaotic reassembly of what was meant to be ordered.
<words>312</words>
The final oath pulsed in his mind, a silent, heavy promise.
<words>322</words>
He wasn't sure if it was working, if the cosmic scoreboard was truly being rewritten or just smudged.
<words>338</words>
His ambivalence was a constant companion; perhaps failure was just another form of success in this strange endeavor.
<words>353</words>
He continued placing edges, lost in the intricate, impossible task.
<words>363</words>
The lunar mining colony hummed softly around him, oblivious to the cosmic surgery happening within its walls.
<words>378</words>
He smiled, a small, bashfully arrogant smile, at the cracked marbles and the rummage sale tools.
<words>392</words>
"Just a little tidying up," he whispered, happily sad, as the moment between heartbeats stretched into eternity.
