The baroque asteroid hung in the void, its ornate spires catching the distant, borrowed starlight. <words>13</words>
Within its labyrinthine structures, a lurking assassin named Kael waited. <words>21</words>
His fingers traced the cool metal of a paint-splattered camera lens, a relic from a life before the unforgiving road he now traveled. <words>38</words>
He was here for one purpose: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, a goal that felt both desperately real and superficially profound. <words>56</words>
The air was still, thick with the dust of ages and the hum of dormant machinery, waiting for the signal. <words>71</words>
That signal would come when the bus driver completes the final route, bringing his target to this forgotten corner of the cosmos. <words>88</words>
Kael studied the intricate network of conduits and walkways above, seeing patterns emerge via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, a method he used to predict movement and plan his approach. <words>116</words>
Each glint of light on the wet-look surfaces, each intersection, spoke a language only he understood. <words>130</words>
He thought of the dawn, imagining its warmth, a stark contrast to the cold calculations that filled his mind. <words>146</words>
The irony of his mission, seeking light through shadow, made him quietly laugh, a dry, rasping sound swallowed by the silence. <words>164</words>
The unforgiving road had led him here, to this moment poised on the edge of something he couldn't fully grasp. <words>181</words>
He adjusted his grip on his weapon, the weight familiar and comforting. <words>191</words>
The paint splatters on the lens seemed to mock him, remnants of a time when his vision was clearer, less focused on death. <words>209</words>
But the dawn called, a promise whispered across the void. <words>219</words>
He needed that light, that fragile hope, to justify the darkness he inhabited. <words>231</words>
The bus's distant drone began to register, a low thrumming growing steadily louder. <words>242</words>
The final route was nearing its end. <words>249</words>
Kael's heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the borrowed starlight. <words>261</words>
He checked his position, confirming the angles, the escape routes, all mapped out via the pattern of a spider's web after rain. <words>279</words>
The target would disembark near the old docking bay, a perfect choke point. <words>289</words>
He allowed himself another brief, humorless laugh at the predictability of it all. <words>301</words>
This was the culmination of the unforgiving road, the final turn before the potential dawn. <words>314</words>
His hands trembled slightly, not from fear, but from the sheer weight of anticipation, the desperate need to finally cradle that light. <words>333</words>
The paint-splattered camera lens hung around his neck, a constant reminder of the cost of this journey. <words>347</words>
He peered through the lens, the splatters distorting the view, making the approaching bus look like a smear of color against the black. <words>366</words>
It was a fitting image for a life lived in blurred lines and moral ambiguity. <words>377</words>
The bus hissed to a stop. <words>382</words>
The door opened. <words>385</words>
The moment had arrived. <words>390</words>
Kael took a deep breath, the borrowed starlight reflecting in his eyes. <words>401</words>
He was ready to reach for the dawn, no matter the cost. <words>411</words>
