Deputy Mara Vell moved through the lush orchard that stretched impossibly across the rafters of the abandoned cathedral, her boots silent on the moss-covered beams. <words>25</words>  
The air shimmered with the scent of overripe figs and the low hum of bees, their wings whispering secrets only the trained could decipher. <words>45</words>  
She paused beneath a crumbling archway, her expression impassive, though her heart beat with the cautious bravery of someone who had come seeking something sacred. <words>68</words>  
In her gloved hand, she held a twisted twist tie—once mundane, now a key, encoded with the secret language of bees. <words>88</words>  
She had learned their dialect during oil changes at the edge of town, where the hives buzzed louder than engines and time slowed to a syrupy crawl. <words>113</words>  
The bees had taught her to listen, not with ears, but with the stretch of silence between thoughts, where uncharted echoes lived. <words>134</words>  
Each echo was a memory not her own, a fragment of grace left behind by those who had once worshipped beneath these vaulted ceilings. <words>155</words>  
Mara moved forward, her personally impersonal demeanor shielding her from the weight of the cathedral’s forgotten prayers. <words>172</words>  
She wasn’t here to mourn; she was here to witness a moment of pure grace, one that the bees had promised would come. <words>194</words>  
The orchard pulsed with life, vines curling around stained glass windows, apples glowing like lanterns in the dim light. <words>213</words>  
She reached a platform where a single tree grew from the stone, its roots tangled with bones and rusted chalices. <words>232</words>  
There, a swarm of bees hovered, forming symbols in the air—an invitation, a warning, a map. <words>247</words>  
Mara raised the twist tie and bent it into the shape the bees had shown her during her last oil change. <words>266</words>  
The air thickened, and the bees parted, revealing a shimmer in the space between branches, like a curtain of breath. <words>286</words>  
She stepped through, her body stretching as if time itself resisted her passage, and emerged into a chamber of soundless light. <words>307</words>  
Here, the uncharted echoes coalesced into a vision: a child offering a bruised pear to a dying priest, both radiant with forgiveness. <words>328</words>  
Mara watched, unmoving, as the moment unfolded—pure, unfiltered grace, untouched by doctrine or decay. <words>344</words>  
Tears welled in her eyes, though her face remained unreadable, the deputy’s mask never slipping. <words>359</words>  
The bees circled her once, then vanished into the rafters, their message delivered, their promise kept. <words>374</words>  
She turned and walked back through the orchard, the twist tie now straight in her hand, its purpose fulfilled. <words>392</words>  
Outside, the sun dipped low, and engines hummed in the distance, waiting for their oil to be changed. <words>409</words>  
Mara didn’t look back; she had seen what she came for, and the echoes would carry her forward. <words>427</words>  
In the cathedral’s silence, the orchard rustled, and somewhere, a bee danced a story only she would understand. <words>448</words>
