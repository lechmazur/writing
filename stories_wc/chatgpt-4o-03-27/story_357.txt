The frost giant’s lair was colder than regret and twice as silent, save for the clatter of dice on ancient stone. <words>21</words> 

Elias, a focused collector of rare emotions and rarer artifacts, adjusted his scarf and studied the board game before him. <words>38</words> 

He wasn’t here for fun—he was here to triumph over despair, the alpha predator that had stalked him since childhood. <words>54</words> 

Each round of the game was a battle, not just against the frost giant’s cunning but against the creeping chill of hopelessness. <words>71</words> 

Pinned inside his leather-bound journal was a black rose, its petals preserved in ink and memory, a relic from the day he chose solitude. <words>91</words> 

That day, he’d walked away from noise and need, embracing the quiet like a cloak, seldom odd but always alone. <words>106</words> 

The frost giant, a towering brute with eyes like cracked glaciers, chuckled as he moved his obsidian pawn. <words>119</words> 

“You play well, little man,” he rumbled, “but you cannot unravel despair with dice.” <words>131</words> 

Elias smiled with earnest flippancy, the kind that masked scars with charm. <words>140</words> 

“Maybe not,” he said, “but I can outlast it.” <words>148</words> 

The game continued, each round a metaphor, each card drawn a memory faced and filed. <words>160</words> 

Then came the sudden invitation—a scroll of ice unfurled before him, glowing with runes: “Attend the Gathering of Shadows.” <words>175</words> 

It was a party, of sorts, hosted by the frost giant’s kin, where solitude was mocked and masks were mandatory. <words>190</words> 

Elias hesitated, the black rose brushing his fingers as he turned the page in his journal. <words>201</words> 

He accepted—not to mingle, but to confront the echo of his own isolation. <words>211</words> 

At the gathering, laughter rang like icicles shattering, and Elias stood apart, observing, collecting. <words>223</words> 

He saw how others wore their loneliness like costumes, while he had made his into armor. <words>235</words> 

A frost sprite offered him a drink; he declined with a nod, eyes fixed on the frost giant across the room. <words>250</words> 

They resumed their game in a corner, the party swirling around them like a storm of forgotten dreams. <words>263</words> 

With each move, Elias unraveled a little more of the despair that clung to him like frostbite. <words>276</words> 

He played not to win, but to understand, to see the shape of his solitude in the mirror of another. <words>291</words> 

The final round came, and Elias placed his last piece—a carved figure shaped like a rose—on the board. <words>305</words> 

The frost giant leaned back, eyes narrowing, then nodded once. <words>313</words> 

“You’ve bested me,” he said, “not with strategy, but with stillness.” <words>324</words> 

Elias closed his journal, the black rose pressed firm between its pages. <words>333</words> 

He had not defeated despair, but he had named it, faced it, and found it wanting. <words>346</words> 

As the party faded into frost and memory, Elias walked alone, not lonely, the echo of dice still in his ears. <words>361</words> 

Solitude, he realized, was not absence but presence—his own, unshaken and seldom odd. <words>373</words> 

And in that presence, even despair had to blink first. <words>381</words>
