In the probability mapping center, where timelines shimmered like heatwaves and futures were plotted with surgical precision, the peculiar collector arrived without announcement. <words>23</words>  
He wore a coat stitched from expired constellations and carried nothing but an old pencil stub tucked behind his ear. <words>39</words>  
The staff, trained to anticipate anomalies, found his presence both statistically improbable and infuriatingly calm. <words>52</words>  
He moved through the corridors as if he’d been there across millennia, tweaking knobs and dials with the familiarity of a ghost returning home. <words>69</words>  
No one dared stop him, not even when he began decoding the arrangement of keys left in the piano bench of the observation chamber. <words>87</words>  
The piano had sat untouched for centuries, its bench sealed, its purpose forgotten—until the collector pried it open with a sigh. <words>103</words>  
Inside, the keys were arranged not musically, but mathematically, each note a cipher, each chord a buried truth. <words>117</words>  
He used the pencil stub to trace patterns in the dust, revealing a map of dormant talents hidden in the folds of time. <words>134</words>  
These were not talents of skill or art, but of potential—abilities suppressed by fear, by systems, by silence. <words>148</words>  
The collector’s mission was not to awaken them all, but to make a final stand against the entropy of forgotten brilliance. <words>163</words>  
He moved with fractured grace, like a dancer remembering steps from a dream, each motion unlocking another layer of the encoded bench. <words>179</words>  
The staff watched, mesmerized, as probabilities shifted on their screens—timelines once deemed impossible now flickered with renewed viability. <words>193</words>  
One technician, a young woman named Elen, approached him, her voice trembling: “Why now?” <words>204</words>  
He looked at her with eyes that had seen civilizations rise and fall, and said, “Because the world has forgotten how to remember.” <words>221</words>  
With a final tweak of the piano’s inner mechanism, a low hum filled the room, resonating with the buried talents of everyone present. <words>237</words>  
Elen felt something stir within her—a childhood dream of flight, long dismissed, now pulsing with possibility. <words>249</words>  
Others gasped, wept, or stood in stunned silence as their own dormant gifts began to surface. <words>260</words>  
The collector stepped back, his task complete, the pencil stub now worn to a nub, its purpose fulfilled. <words>273</words>  
He placed it gently on the piano, where it shimmered briefly before dissolving into light. <words>284</words>  
Then he turned and walked into the deepest corridor of the center, where no probabilities had ever been mapped. <words>298</words>  
Elen called after him, but he did not respond—his calm unbroken, his path unaltered. <words>309</words>  
She understood then that he was not a man, but a memory given form, a final echo of resistance. <words>323</words>  
The center would never be the same; its purpose had shifted from prediction to awakening. <words>334</words>  
And across millennia, the buried talents of countless souls began to rise, reshaping futures once thought lost. <words>347</words>  
The collector’s stand had not been loud, but it had been final—and it had been enough. <words>359</words>  
In the silence that followed, the piano played a single note, clear and true, as if to say: remember. <words>373</words>  
And they did. <words>375</words>
