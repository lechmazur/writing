The prismatic lake shimmered like fractured glass under the half-built skyline, where cranes loomed like skeletal birds amid construction. <words>21</words>  
Milo stood at its edge, a joyless performer in a velvet coat too fine for the dust, too modestly extravagant for applause. <words>41</words>  
He had once danced on stages lit by chandeliers, but now he moved only to organize the chaos within himself. <words>58</words>  
Each morning, he walked to the abandoned playground near the lake, where the echo of a squeaking seesaw guided him like a metronome. <words>78</words>  
It was there, beneath the rusted slide, that he buried the simple drawer knob—his brother’s last gift before the accident. <words>96</words>  
The knob had belonged to their childhood dresser, a relic of shared secrets and whispered dreams, now a talisman of guilt. <words>113</words>  
Milo had ignored his brother’s final call, choosing instead to rehearse a solo he never performed. <words>126</words>  
The dissonance of that choice echoed louder than any applause he’d ever earned. <words>137</words>  
He came to the lake not to remember, but to hush that dissonance, to drown it in the shifting colors of the water. <words>157</words>  
The lake, like him, was torn between truths—beauty and pollution, serenity and noise, memory and forgetting. <words>172</words>  
He watched the cranes swing steel beams like pendulums, measuring time he could never reclaim. <words>185</words>  
Each creak of the seesaw was a confession, each gust of wind a reminder that guilt never truly settles. <words>200</words>  
One afternoon, he found a child’s drawing pinned beneath a stone near the knob’s burial site. <words>213</words>  
It showed a man in a velvet coat standing beside a rainbow lake, smiling. <words>225</words>  
The drawing was crude, but the smile was unmistakably his—one he hadn’t worn in years. <words>239</words>  
He folded the paper carefully, organizing it into his coat pocket like a sacred script. <words>252</words>  
That night, he returned to the lake and unearthed the knob, its brass dulled but intact. <words>266</words>  
He held it to his ear, absurdly, as if it might whisper forgiveness. <words>277</words>  
Instead, the seesaw groaned behind him, its echo a lullaby of cautious abandon. <words>289</words>  
Milo turned toward the cranes, their silhouettes now softened by twilight, and began to dance—not for an audience, but for the silence. <words>309</words>  
His movements were modestly extravagant, each step a negotiation between sorrow and grace. <words>322</words>  
He danced until the stars blinked awake, until the lake mirrored not his guilt, but his release. <words>336</words>  
In that moment, the drawer knob slipped from his hand and sank, not as a burden, but as a benediction. <words>352</words>  
The seesaw creaked once more, then stilled, as if the playground itself had exhaled. <words>364</words>  
Milo stood alone, no longer a performer, but a man who had finally organized his truths. <words>378</words>  
He walked away from the lake, the drawing in his pocket, the silence behind him no longer empty. <words>393</words>  
The cranes continued their work, building upward, as Milo moved forward—not to forget, but to begin. <words>407</words>
