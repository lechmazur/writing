The wind howled through the ribcage of the fossilized giant, its bones forming a cathedral of calcified silence where the sentient scarecrow stood vigil. <words>23</words>  
Its straw-stuffed chest bore a sigil burned into burlap—a promise made long ago, an oath sworn to a dying queen in a world now crumbled. <words>45</words>  
The scarecrow’s button eyes flickered with a dull glow as it traced the lines in the earth beneath its feet, ancient grooves etched by titanic claws. <words>66</words>  
These lines were not mere scars but coordinates, a map between parallel worlds, each one a whisper of what could have been or might still be. <words>88</words>  
It had no heart, but it remembered the queen’s voice, trembling and resolute, as she pressed the forgotten lace fan into its stitched hands. <words>108</words>  
“This fan,” she had said, “holds the breath of our realm—guard it, and find the one who can awaken the marrow of the giant.” <words>130</words>  
Now, centuries later, the scarecrow wandered the fossil’s hollowed skull, entering virtual realms through a rusted helm embedded in the cranium’s crown. <words>150</words>  
Each encounter in virtual reality brought it closer to the truth, each simulation a shard of memory, a test of loyalty, a trial of will. <words>172</words>  
In one world, it met a girl who spoke in riddles and danced with shadows; in another, a beast who wept molten tears over a broken harp. <words>195</words>  
But none bore the mark, none could wield the fan, none could stir the bones of the colossus back to motion. <words>211</words>  
The scarecrow’s fervent apathy grew—its purpose burned like a dying star, bright but cold, a duty without desire, a flame without warmth. <words>231</words>  
Then, in a realm of glass trees and bleeding skies, it found a boy who drew lines in the earth with his bare fingers. <words>251</words>  
The scarecrow watched as the boy’s lines pulsed with light, echoing the ancient grooves beneath the fossil’s feet, resonating with the oath’s forgotten rhythm. <words>272</words>  
It approached, extending the lace fan, and the boy took it without fear, unfolding it with reverence as wind stirred from nowhere. <words>291</words>  
The fan shimmered, revealing glyphs that danced like fireflies, and the scarecrow knew—this was the one, the marrow-stirrer, the oath’s fulfillment. <words>311</words>  
But a shadow rose behind the boy, a creature of stitched mouths and rusted blades, seeking to skewer the chosen before the awakening. <words>330</words>  
The scarecrow moved without thought, impaling itself on the blade to shield the boy, straw and burlap unraveling in the wind. <words>348</words>  
As its form collapsed, the fan burst into flame, and the lines in the earth blazed, threading light through the fossil’s bones. <words>367</words>  
The giant stirred, its eye sockets glowing, and the boy stood within its heart, holding the burning fan like a torch against the void. <words>387</words>  
Between parallel worlds, the scarecrow’s essence lingered, not alive, not dead, but fulfilled—its oath upheld, its purpose complete, its apathy finally at peace. <words>407</words>
