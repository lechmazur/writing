In the heart of a city that had grown too fast for its own soul, Maren posed as a fortune teller in a crooked tent near the old train station. <words>26</words>  
She wore bangles that clinked like wind chimes and spoke in riddles, but her visions—uninvited and vivid—were real. <words>45</words>  
She had them regularly seldom, as she liked to say, meaning they came when least expected but always when most needed. <words>66</words>  
One spring morning, during the early days of planting, Maren wandered from her tent, letting her feet explore the city’s unfamiliar veins. <words>88</words>  
She had no map, only a restless ache and a whisper of something waiting. <words>99</words>  
Getting lost was her method, a ritual of surrender that often led her to strange truths. <words>112</words>  
That day, it led her to a crumbling building with ivy strangling its nameplate: The Archive of Extinct Languages. <words>132</words>  
Inside, dust danced like spirits in shafts of light, and the air smelled of parchment and forgotten prayers. <words>150</words>  
She wandered through aisles of brittle scrolls and cracked tablets, her fingers brushing alphabets no tongue had spoken in centuries. <words>172</words>  
In a back chamber, behind a false wall, she found a crypt sealed with wax and bone. <words>188</words>  
Curiosity, that sacred hunger, urged her to break the seal. <words>198</words>  
Inside lay a bone flute, carved with symbols she recognized from a vision she’d had as a child. <words>216</words>  
She lifted it, and the room sighed, as if the building itself remembered. <words>228</words>  
When she played the first note, the air shimmered, and a voice—not hers—spoke in a language she didn’t know but understood. <words>250</words>  
It told of a people who had once sung seeds into the earth, whose songs shaped the growth of sacred crops. <words>270</words>  
They had vanished when their language died, their knowledge buried with their bones. <words>283</words>  
Maren wept, not from sorrow, but from peaceful anger—anger at the loss, peace in the rediscovery. <words>300</words>  
She knew then her visions were not curses but calls to action. <words>311</words>  
She returned to her tent, but no longer told fortunes. <words>321</words>  
Instead, she taught the songs from the flute, syllables that made soil tremble and roots stir. <words>338</words>  
People came, drawn by something they couldn’t name, and stayed to learn. <words>350</words>  
Throughout planting, the city changed—not quickly, but deeply. <words>360</words>  
Gardens bloomed in alleyways, and children sang to their seeds. <words>372</words>  
Maren watched, knowing she had taken a chance by exploring, by getting lost, by listening. <words>388</words>  
She had studied sacred development not in books, but in breath and bone. <words>401</words>  
And in doing so, she had become something more than a fortune teller—she had become a keeper of what was nearly lost. <words>423</words>  
The flute rested beside her now, silent but not still, waiting for the next seeker to take a chance. <words>442</words>  
And somewhere in the city, another wall cracked open. <words>451</words>
