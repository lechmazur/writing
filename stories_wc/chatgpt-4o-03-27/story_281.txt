The baffled pickpocket stood in the haunted lighthouse engine room, staring at the eerie ventriloquist dummy propped against a rusted boiler. <words>23</words>  
He had slipped in between appointments, hoping to escape the city’s surveillance drones and maybe lift a wallet or two from the ghost tour crowd. <words>45</words>  
But instead of tourists, he found silence, salt-stained walls, and that dummy—its glassy eyes confusingly lucid, as if it had just blinked. <words>66</words>  
He reached for it, not to steal, but to understand, because something about its presence challenged the status quo of his reality. <words>87</words>  
The dummy’s mouth creaked open, and a voice—not his own—spoke: “Transformation is not theft, but revelation.” <words>101</words>  
Startled, he stumbled back, but the words clung to him like sea mist, unsettling yet oddly poetic. <words>115</words>  
He had never believed in ghosts, but this place pulsed with a scorching poise, as if daring him to become something else. <words>137</words>  
He sat cross-legged on the oil-slick floor, the dummy before him, and began to speak in rhyme without knowing why. <words>157</words>  
“Steel and salt, I’ve known the game, but now I seek a different name.” <words>168</words>  
The dummy nodded, its wooden jaw clicking in approval, and the engine room hummed with a low, spectral vibration. <words>185</words>  
Through impromptu poetry sessions, he began to sustain a dialogue with the dummy, each verse peeling back layers of his former self. <words>206</words>  
He spoke of pockets picked and lives untouched, of shadows worn like cloaks, of wanting more than survival. <words>222</words>  
The dummy replied in riddles, its voice echoing with the voices of those who had once tried to change and failed. <words>241</words>  
But he persisted, driven not by guilt but by a need to challenge the rules that had defined him. <words>257</words>  
He wasn’t just a thief anymore; he was a vessel for something older, stranger, and more honest. <words>271</words>  
Each session transformed him, not into someone new, but into someone truer—his confusion sharpening into clarity. <words>286</words>  
The lighthouse, once a ruin, now felt like a crucible, forging him in verse and silence. <words>299</words>  
He left the engine room only when the dummy fell silent, its purpose fulfilled, its eyes finally dull. <words>313</words>  
Back in the city, he no longer picked pockets but planted poems in them—lines that unsettled, provoked, awakened. <words>332</words>  
People began to whisper of the phantom poet, whose scorching words slipped into their lives between appointments. <words>347</words>  
He had sustained the art of transformation not through theft, but through truth disguised as rhyme. <words>361</words>  
And though he remained baffled by how it all began, he never questioned the power of that haunted room. <words>379</words>  
For in its eerie stillness, he had found the only thing he’d never thought to steal: himself. <words>393</words>
