During the third hour of crocheting a blanket from yarn dyed with moonflower sap, I found the antique map with a tear tucked inside the lining of a velvet pouch. <words>27</words>  
The pouch had been sewn into the hem of a moth-eaten cloak belonging to a witch’s familiar—a talking stoat named Bramble who ran the menagerie. <words>52</words>  
I wasn’t supposed to be there, but I’d volunteered to clean cages and alphabetize potion ingredients, hoping odd places might yield odd truths. <words>74</words>  
The map was brittle, its ink faded except for a single phrase scrawled in red: “The brimming cup spills only for the statically unique.” <words>98</words>  
I read it aloud, and Bramble, perched on a perch meant for owls, blinked slowly and said, “That’s not meant for just anyone, you know.” <words>122</words>  
I told him I wasn’t just anyone—I was an underground poet who’d stopped writing because the words had started to feel like someone else’s. <words>146</words>  
He sniffed, unimpressed, and asked what I was really doing here, crocheting blankets and scrubbing dragon scales with vinegar and salt. <words>167</words>  
“To surprise fate with an unplanned encore,” I said, not entirely sure what I meant until I heard myself say it. <words>186</words>  
Bramble tilted his head, then leapt down and scurried into a drawer labeled “Unclaimed Destinies,” returning with a key shaped like a question mark. <words>211</words>  
He told me the map led to the brimming cup, a relic that filled only for those who’d emptied themselves of expectation. <words>232</words>  
I asked how to find it, and he said, “Seize the tear, not the map.” <words>246</words>  
So I did—I tore the map further, and the room folded inward like a paper crane collapsing into ink. <words>267</words>  
When I opened my eyes, I was standing in a field of mirrors, each reflecting a version of me I’d never dared to write. <words>291</words>  
One held a microphone, another a shovel, another a child’s hand; all of them looked at me with the same disinterested passion I’d worn for years. <words>318</words>  
In the center of the field stood a pedestal, and on it, the brimming cup—overflowing with something that shimmered like language before it’s spoken. <words>342</words>  
I reached for it, but a mirror-me stepped forward and said, “Only the statically unique may drink—have you stopped moving long enough to be seen?” <words>368</words>  
I thought of the volunteer stints, the poems I never published, the blankets crocheted in silence, and I nodded. <words>386</words>  
The cup tilted toward me, spilling a single drop onto my tongue, and suddenly I remembered every word I’d ever meant to write. <words>410</words>  
I woke back in the menagerie, Bramble asleep on a pile of spellbooks, the torn map now blank, the blanket finished in my lap. <words>434</words>  
I picked up a quill and began to write—not for readers, not for fame, but to see what would happen if I did. <words>459</words>  
And in that moment, I seized something more elusive than fate: the encore I hadn’t planned, but had always been waiting to perform. <words>484</words>
