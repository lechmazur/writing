The slow fade of an echoing hour draped the collapsed cathedral in a hush that felt like memory. <words>17</words>  
Once a monument to faith, now it stood as a haven for street artists, its broken arches tattooed with color. <words>33</words>  
Among the shattered pews and spray-painted saints, a shaky mercenary named Rell moved with carefully reckless steps. <words>47</words>  
His hands trembled not from fear, but from the weight of years spent chasing ghosts he couldn’t name. <words>60</words>  
He had come here following a chain of improbable rumors, whispers passed from drunk to dreamer to dying man. <words>75</words>  
Each tale spoke of a chunk of amber, no larger than a fist, with a spider trapped inside. <words>89</words>  
They said it pulsed faintly in moonlight, like a heartbeat sealed in golden resin. <words>99</words>  
Rell didn’t believe in magic, but he believed in symbols, and this one had haunted his sleep. <words>112</words>  
The spider, they said, was ancient—older than the cathedral, older than the city, older than regret. <words>124</words>  
He needed to find it, not for power or profit, but to finalize something left undone. <words>136</words>  
Years ago, he’d abandoned a brother in a jungle war, choosing survival over loyalty. <words>147</words>  
The spider had belonged to that brother, a talisman he’d claimed could trap fate itself. <words>159</words>  
Now, Rell sought it not to change the past, but to make peace with it. <words>170</words>  
He stepped over a mosaic of shattered glass and found a mural of a man dissolving into birds. <words>183</words>  
Behind it, a hollow in the wall glowed faintly, as if the stone remembered fire. <words>194</words>  
Inside, nestled in dust and forgotten prayers, lay the amber. <words>201</words>  
The spider within was curled, legs folded like secrets, its body suspended in eternal pause. <words>213</words>  
Rell reached out, his fingers brushing the surface, and the tremble in his hands stilled. <words>225</words>  
He saw his brother’s face—not in the amber, but in the silence that followed. <words>236</words>  
The cathedral seemed to breathe, its broken ribs exhaling centuries of longing. <words>246</words>  
Rell sat down, the amber warm in his palm, and let the hour fade around him. <words>258</words>  
He didn’t cry, but something inside him loosened, like a knot finally unpicked. <words>269</words>  
The rumors had led him true, not to treasure, but to a reckoning. <words>280</words>  
He stayed until the last echo died, until the light turned the amber to fire. <words>292</words>  
Then he stood, carefully reckless as ever, and walked out into the waiting dark. <words>303</words>  
Behind him, the spider slept on, a sentinel of the past, sealed in golden stillness. <words>315</words>  
Rell didn’t look back; he didn’t need to. <words>321</words>  
The unknown he’d searched for wasn’t the spider—it was the forgiveness he’d never dared to seek. <words>334</words>  
And in that improbable hour, among ruins and paint, he’d found it. <words>343</words>  
Not in words, but in the finality of choosing to remember without running. <words>354</words>  
The city swallowed him, but the cathedral kept his echo, a whisper of longing made whole. <words>367</words>  
And somewhere, through rumor and ruin, another seeker would come, chasing their own unknown. <words>379</words>  
But for Rell, the search was over, and the silence was enough. <words>388</words>
