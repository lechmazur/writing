The orchardist moved through the resonance testing facility with the gait of a man who had buried too many songs. <words>1</words>  
His boots echoed against the steel floor, each step a reminder of the hush where past meets prophecy. <words>2</words>  
He carried a sun-bleached desert skull under one arm, its hollow sockets filled with dried lavender. <words>3</words>  
The skull had once belonged to a desert beast whose cries were said to mimic lullabies lost to time. <words>4</words>  
He had acquired it via black-market transactions, trading a crate of fermented orchard sap and a promise never to return. <words>5</words>  
The facility’s walls pulsed faintly, tuned to frequencies only the truly broken could hear. <words>6</words>  
He was not a scientist, but a craftsman—an orchardist whose trees bore fruit that whispered forgotten melodies. <words>7</words>  
But the trees had gone silent, their roots tangled in grief, their branches heavy with unsung sorrow. <words>8</words>  
He believed the lullabies were not gone, only misplaced, scattered like seeds in the wind. <words>9</words>  
To collect them, he needed to contain their echoes, to trap them in vessels that remembered how to sing. <words>10</words>  
The skull was one such vessel, its bone porous with memory, its silence aching to be filled. <words>11</words>  
He placed it on the resonance platform, aligning it with the facility’s harmonic grid. <words>12</words>  
The technician, a woman with genuinely artificial eyes, nodded once and activated the sequence. <words>13</words>  
She had been grown in a vat of synthetic empathy, designed to feel what others could not. <words>14</words>  
The room dimmed, and the skull began to hum, a low vibration that stirred the orchardist’s ribs. <words>15</words>  
He closed his eyes, and in the hum he heard the first notes of a lullaby his mother once sang. <words>16</words>  
It was cracked and incomplete, but it was enough to make his knees buckle. <words>17</words>  
The technician caught him, her grip firm but not unkind, her eyes flickering with borrowed sorrow. <words>18</words>  
“You’re close,” she whispered, her voice like wind through brittle leaves. <words>19</words>  
He nodded, tears carving paths through the dust on his cheeks. <words>20</words>  
Each skull he collected brought him nearer to the orchard’s voice, to the songs that once lulled the trees to bloom. <words>21</words>  
He had five more to find, each hidden in deserts where the sun bleached bones and memories alike. <words>22</words>  
The black market was dangerous, but pride in his craft demanded he risk everything. <words>23</words>  
He was not just an orchardist; he was a keeper of echoes, a gardener of grief. <words>24</words>  
The technician handed him a data crystal, its surface etched with the lullaby’s waveform. <words>25</words>  
He slipped it into his coat, next to the others, each one a seed of sound waiting to be planted. <words>26</words>  
As he left the facility, the skull’s hum still echoed in his bones, a reminder that even silence could sing. <words>27</words>  
Outside, the wind carried dust and prophecy, and he walked into it with haggard awe. <words>28</words>
