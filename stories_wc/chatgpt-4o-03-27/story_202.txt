The found object museum shimmered under dusty starlight, its rusted signage flickering as if remembering better days. <words>17</words>  
Inside, amid mannequin limbs and broken radios, Cassian crouched beside a display of antique skateboards, his fingers trembling slightly. <words>33</words>  
He wasn’t here for nostalgia—he was here to test the edges of gravity, to see how far instinct could carry him. <words>48</words>  
Cassian was a careful poisoner, not of bodies, but of truths, slipping doubt into certainty like venom into wine. <words>61</words>  
Tonight, he followed a trail of cryptic clues hidden in a scavenger hunt designed by someone who knew his code of instinct. <words>77</words>  
Each clue was a whisper from the past, each object a mirror to his guilt—innocent in appearance, damning in implication. <words>91</words>  
He skated silently through the museum’s echoing halls, wheels humming over cracked linoleum, the air thick with rust and memory. <words>104</words>  
The next clue was tucked inside a hollowed-out toaster, a slip of paper inked with coordinates and a single word: “Authenticate.” <words>118</words>  
Cassian knew what it meant—he had to prove he was still himself, still bound by the instincts that once saved him. <words>132</words>  
He reached the mezzanine, where an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt lay displayed beneath shattered glass, its blade catching moonlight. <words>146</words>  
It had belonged to his mentor, who taught him that precision was mercy and hesitation was cruelty. <words>157</words>  
Cassian lifted the rapier, feeling the fracture in the hilt like a heartbeat, and remembered the final lesson: poison is only as careful as its wielder. <words>174</words>  
He turned to the wall behind the display, where a faded mural depicted a man mid-air, skateboard beneath him, defying gravity. <words>188</words>  
Cassian pressed the rapier’s tip to the mural’s heart, and a hidden panel clicked open, revealing a velvet box. <words>200</words>  
Inside was a vial of iridescent liquid and a note: “To fall is human. To rise, authenticate.” <words>211</words>  
He drank without hesitation, trusting the code of instinct that had never failed him, even when it led him to guilt. <words>224</words>  
The world tilted, not with poison, but with clarity—memories rearranged, truths rebalanced, gravity redefined. <words>234</words>  
Cassian dropped the rapier, its cracked hilt splitting fully, and stepped onto his board, now glowing faintly beneath his feet. <words>247</words>  
He skated through the museum’s final corridor, walls bending like light, the air humming with the weightlessness of absolution. <words>259</words>  
Outside, the stars blinked in approval as he launched into the night, no longer innocently guilty, but authentically free. <words>271</words>  
Behind him, the museum sealed itself shut, its secrets once again buried beneath layers of forgotten objects and remembered sins. <words>284</words>  
Cassian vanished into the starlit dark, a silhouette in motion, testing the edges of gravity with every breath. <words>296</words>  
And somewhere, far above or deep within, instinct whispered: “You are still you.” <words>305</words>
