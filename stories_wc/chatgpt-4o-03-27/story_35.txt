The quiet gardener arrived at the Universal Translation Center just as the first bird calls echoed through the glass atrium. <words>20</words>  
He clutched an embroidered purse, its faded threads depicting a scene he couldn’t quite remember but felt deeply familiar. <words>38</words>  
The purse had been found buried beneath a rose bush he’d planted years ago, unearthed during a regularly random inspection of the roots. <words>58</words>  
Inside, he’d discovered a photograph of himself as a child, standing beside a woman whose face flickered in and out of recognition. <words>76</words>  
He had no memory of her, yet the ache in his chest told him she mattered more than anything he’d ever forgotten. <words>94</words>  
The Translation Center, usually reserved for decoding alien dialects, had recently opened a pilot program to interpret the language of emotions. <words>112</words>  
He had signed up not out of curiosity, but out of an improbable longing to recover what had been lost. <words>129</words>  
The program required a shared experience at a silent retreat, where participants communicated only through presence, gesture, and breath. <words>146</words>  
There, amid the hush of wind and the rhythmic calls of unseen birds, he met a woman with eyes like stormlight. <words>165</words>  
She, too, carried an embroidered purse, nearly identical to his, and when they sat beside each other, something inside him flickered again. <words>184</words>  
They didn’t speak, but their silence was thick with recognition, as if their hearts were translating what their minds could not. <words>202</words>  
Each day, they gardened together in the retreat’s courtyard, their hands brushing soil and memory alike. <words>215</words>  
The act of planting became a ritual, each seed a question, each bloom a possible answer. <words>229</words>  
One morning, as the sun filtered through the leaves, she handed him a folded note from her purse. <words>244</words>  
It read: “Do you remember the orchard?” and with that, a cascade of images returned—laughter, apples, her voice calling his name. <words>265</words>  
He remembered being five, chasing her through rows of trees, the embroidered purse swinging from her shoulder. <words>278</words>  
She was his sister, lost in a car accident that had stolen not just her life, but his memory of her. <words>296</words>  
The trauma had buried her beneath layers of silence, like the purse beneath the rose bush. <words>309</words>  
Now, through the shared stillness and the language of emotion, she had returned to him. <words>322</words>  
They wept without sound, their tears translating what no words ever could. <words>334</words>  
The Translation Center recorded their session, noting the flicker of recognition as a breakthrough in emotional linguistics. <words>349</words>  
But for the gardener, the only translation that mattered was the one that brought his sister back. <words>363</words>  
He returned to his garden, the purse now resting on a bench beside him, no longer a mystery but a memory reclaimed. <words>382</words>  
Bird calls echoed once more, and he smiled, knowing that some languages bloom only in silence. <words>396</words>  
And in that improbable longing, he had found not just understanding, but peace. <words>407</words>
