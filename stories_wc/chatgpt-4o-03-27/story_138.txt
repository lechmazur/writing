The spontaneous combustion lab reeked of ozone and burnt paper, a fitting place for a forgotten noble to hide from the world that had erased his name. <words>23</words>  
Once, Lord Thalen of House Virell had commanded fleets and feasts, but now he crouched between scorched benches, reassembling old ticket stubs into a fragile wall. <words>47</words>  
Each stub bore a date, a place, a moment—fragments of a life once lived in full color, now used to fortify his mind against the creeping fog of irrelevance. <words>72</words>  
He worked quickly, knowing he had only the time between text messages from his handler, a woman who claimed to be his niece but never used his name. <words>99</words>  
The artificial hummingbird drone buzzed overhead, its wings shimmering with a mysteriously obvious hum, as if daring anyone to pretend it wasn’t watching. <words>121</words>  
Thalen ignored it, focusing instead on the stub from the Royal Opera, where he’d once wept during a soprano’s final aria—true candor in a small moment. <words>145</words>  
He pressed it into the wall, aligning it with a ferry pass and a torn cinema ticket, each one a truth he refused to let burn. <words>167</words>  
The lab’s heat pulsed like a heartbeat, and the drone dipped lower, scanning the structure he built not for defense, but for clarity. <words>188</words>  
He wasn’t hiding from enemies; he was fortifying his soul against the illusion that he had never mattered. <words>204</words>  
The drone chirped, a sound like a question, and Thalen looked up, his eyes hollow but defiant. <words>219</words>  
“I know what you are,” he said, voice rough with disuse, “and I know why you’re here.” <words>234</words>  
The drone hovered, its lens dilating, recording his confession as if it were a royal decree. <words>248</words>  
“You want me to forget,” he continued, “to believe I was never more than a footnote, a glitch in the archive.” <words>266</words>  
He reached into his coat and pulled out the final stub—a faded entry to the coronation of a king who’d later betrayed him. <words>285</words>  
With trembling fingers, he placed it at the center of the wall, the keystone of his truth. <words>298</words>  
The drone paused, then emitted a low tone, almost respectful, before retreating into the rafters. <words>312</words>  
Thalen sat back, sweat streaking his soot-covered face, and waited for the next message that would pretend to be casual. <words>331</words>  
He would answer it with silence, the only candor left to a man who had once ruled and now remembered. <words>349</words>  
Outside, the lab flickered with the threat of combustion, but inside, the wall stood—fragile, absurd, and unyielding. <words>367</words>  
In the hollow recklessness of his exile, Thalen had found something real: the power to cut through illusions with memory. <words>386</words>  
And in that, he was noble still. <words>390</words>
