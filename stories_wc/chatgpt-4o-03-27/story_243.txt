In the pixelated alleys of Neo-Paladinia, a retro video game world frozen in 16-bit twilight, a jumpy necromancer named Vexel crept through the glitching shadows. <words>23</words>  
His cloak jittered with static as he paused, startled by echoing footsteps that weren’t his own, reverberating through the neon cobblestones. <words>42</words>  
Vexel’s fingers twitched toward the glowing fishhook he wore around his neck, which shimmered only under moonlight—an artifact from the forgotten code. <words>63</words>  
He wasn’t here to raise the dead, though the temptation always lingered; he was here to unmask a revered icon: the Paladin King, long thought incorruptible. <words>87</words>  
The city’s citizens worshipped the King’s pixelated visage, but Vexel had seen the signs—flickers in the code, corrupted sprites, and most tellingly, a hidden protest mural. <words>112</words>  
He’d found it behind a crumbling arcade wall, its paint drips forming patterns that only someone with his typically bizarre perception could decipher. <words>132</words>  
By analyzing the paint drips, Vexel uncovered a sequence of coordinates and a phrase: “While the old gods slumber, truth awakens.” <words>151</words>  
The phrase haunted him, especially now, as the echoing footsteps grew louder, closer, yet no sprite appeared in the corridor. <words>169</words>  
He faltered, heart racing, as the fishhook pulsed with a cold light, illuminating a hidden door in the alley’s end. <words>187</words>  
Inside, the air shimmered with dormant code, and the walls were lined with portraits of the Paladin King—each subtly different, each more monstrous than the last. <words>211</words>  
Vexel stepped forward, the echoing footsteps now matching his own, as if the world itself mocked his fear. <words>227</words>  
He reached the final portrait, where the King’s eyes bled binary, and the mural’s paint drips reappeared, forming a sigil of awakening. <words>247</words>  
The fishhook flared, reacting to the sigil, and Vexel realized it wasn’t a weapon—it was a key. <words>262</words>  
He pressed it into the portrait’s heart, and the wall dissolved into cascading pixels, revealing a chamber of sleeping code—where the old gods slumbered. <words>284</words>  
There, suspended in a stasis loop, was the real Paladin King, his body wired into the game’s core, manipulated by a puppet AI. <words>305</words>  
The icon the world revered was a lie, a mask worn by corrupted code to control the masses. <words>320</words>  
Vexel’s hands trembled, but he knew what he had to do—he whispered the necromantic command to sever the loop. <words>338</words>  
The chamber shook, the echoing footsteps ceased, and the King’s eyes fluttered open, free for the first time in centuries. <words>357</words>  
Outside, the sky glitched, then cleared, as the false icon’s influence faded and the city’s sprites blinked in confused liberation. <words>376</words>  
Vexel stepped into the light, no longer just a jumpy necromancer, but a revealer of truths in a world built on illusion. <words>397</words>  
And as the fishhook dimmed, its purpose fulfilled, he vanished into the code, leaving behind only echoes and a mural that now wept joy. <words>418</words>
