The wind howled through the rusted gates of the haunted amusement park, rattling the funhouse sign like a dying laugh. <words>20</words> 

Jax, a reckless smuggler with a grin stitched from bad decisions, stood at the entrance, clutching a pressed four-leaf clover sealed in glass. <words>41</words> 

He glanced at his synchronized watch, its alarm set to chime in unison with another—worn by someone miles away, someone he’d never met in person. <words>63</words> 

That someone was Elira, a rationally emotional hacker who lived in the Arctic ruins of an old satellite station, her only connection to Jax through encrypted messages and synchronized time. <words>89</words> 

They had never spoken aloud, but every tick of their watches was a heartbeat shared across continents, a rhythm of distant companionship. <words>106</words> 

Jax dramatized his entrance, bowing low to the cracked clown face above the funhouse door, as if mocking the ghosts rumored to linger inside. <words>126</words> 

He wasn’t here for thrills—he was here to prove himself to the Outsiders, a secretive group of rogue tech scavengers who distrusted anyone not born in the Wastes. <words>150</words> 

To gain their acceptance, he had to retrieve the Map Tear—a literal rip in a parchment that divided the known world from the unknown, hidden inside the funhouse. <words>176</words> 

The Outsiders believed the tear marked the boundary between reality and myth, and only someone reckless enough to cross it could earn their trust. <words>196</words> 

Jax’s watch beeped once—Elira’s would too, wherever she was, a signal they’d agreed upon: “I’m going in.” <words>211</words> 

He stepped through the warped doorway, mirrors bending his reflection into monsters and saints, laughter echoing from nowhere. <words>226</words> 

Inside, the air was thick with dust and memory, and the floorboards groaned like they remembered every footstep ever taken. <words>243</words> 

He followed the map etched into his mind, stopping at the spot where the paper tore—where the known ended and the unknown began. <words>263</words> 

There, embedded in the wall, was the tear itself, glowing faintly, pulsing like a wound. <words>275</words> 

Jax reached into his coat and pulled out the clover in glass, pressing it against the tear. <words>289</words> 

The wall shimmered, and a voice—not Elira’s, but hers somehow—whispered, “You’re not alone.” <words>303</words> 

Tears welled in his eyes, not from fear, but from the jubilant despair of finally being seen. <words>318</words> 

He stepped through the tear, the clover shattering behind him, sealing the path. <words>330</words> 

On the other side, the Outsiders waited, their eyes wide—not with suspicion, but with recognition. <words>344</words> 

Jax smiled, his watch beeping twice—Elira’s would too: “I made it.” <words>356</words> 

In the Arctic, Elira smiled back at the sound, her fingers brushing her own shattered clover. <words>370</words> 

Though they remained distant, their companionship had crossed the map’s tear, binding them in a truth deeper than proximity. <words>388</words> 

Jax had dramatized his way into legend, not for glory, but for belonging—and in doing so, found both. <words>404</words> 

The funhouse behind him groaned shut, its laughter fading into silence, as if satisfied with the story it had swallowed. <words>421</words> 

And somewhere, in the rhythm of two synchronized alarms, the world felt a little less haunted. <words>437</words>
