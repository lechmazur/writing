The wind howled through the skeletal remains of the abandoned roller coaster track, its rusted rails groaning like forgotten voices. <words>20</words>  
A daring pathfinder named Elric crouched beneath a warped support beam, his fingers tracing the outline of an antique doorknob clutched in his palm. <words>39</words>  
He had found it buried in the floorboards of a haunted inn, hidden beneath a loose plank marked in bizarre housekeeping logs. <words>56</words>  
The logs, written in looping, erratic script, detailed impossible chores—dusting shadows, ironing echoes, and feeding the attic’s hunger. <words>72</words>  
Elric, ingeniously clueless, had followed the trail with manic devotion, convinced the doorknob was the last fragment of a riddle older than time. <words>91</words>  
Each page turn of the logbook had drawn him deeper into obsession, the quiet mania of discovery eroding his sense of self. <words>108</words>  
Now, amid the twisted metal and silence of the coaster’s corpse, he believed he was close to an answer. <words>121</words>  
The doorknob pulsed faintly in his hand, warm despite the chill, as if remembering the door it once belonged to. <words>137</words>  
He rose, eyes scanning the track’s looping skeleton, and spotted a maintenance shack half-swallowed by ivy and time. <words>151</words>  
Inside, dust motes danced like spirits, and a single book lay open on a desk—another log, its ink still wet. <words>167</words>  
Elric flipped through it, heart pounding, each entry more deranged than the last: “Polish the screams,” “Sweep the forgotten birthdays,” “Erode the silence.” <words>186</words>  
He paused at a final line: “Turn the knob where the ride ends and time begins.” <words>197</words>  
Clutching the doorknob tighter, he stepped back into the open, following the track’s descent into a tunnel choked with vines. <words>213</words>  
The air grew thick, heavy with the scent of ozone and old dreams, as if the tunnel exhaled memories. <words>227</words>  
At its end stood a door with no frame, suspended in the air, its socket empty but waiting. <words>240</words>  
Elric approached, trembling, and inserted the doorknob; it clicked with a sound like a thousand clocks resetting. <words>253</words>  
The door swung inward, revealing a library of infinite shelves, each book whispering secrets in forgotten tongues. <words>266</words>  
He stepped through, pages fluttering around him, each one a fragment of the riddle he had chased. <words>278</words>  
The last fragment, he realized, was not the doorknob, but himself—his journey, his erosion, his transformation. <words>291</words>  
He had become the question and the answer, the path and the destination, the keeper of the haunted logs. <words>304</words>  
Behind him, the door vanished, and the roller coaster track crumbled into dust, its purpose fulfilled. <words>316</words>  
Elric wandered the library, turning pages amid silence, his mania quiet now, but eternal. <words>328</words>  
Each book he opened revealed another haunted inn, another log, another seeker destined to erode. <words>341</words>  
He smiled, ingeniously clueless still, but content to be the last fragment in a riddle that never ends. <words>355</words>  
Outside the library, time paused, waiting for the next daring pathfinder to find the doorknob. <words>367</words>  
And somewhere, in a forgotten inn, a new logbook began to write itself. <words>377</words>
