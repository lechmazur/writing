In the sky reflection pool, where clouds shimmered like secrets on the surface of still water, she waited. <words>20</words>  
Her amber earrings caught the refracted light, glowing like twin suns trapped in orbit around her sharp, unreadable face. <words>39</words>  
She was known only as Lys, a femme fatale heartbreak counselor with a reputation for healing wounds she herself had once inflicted. <words>60</words>  
Time travel had made such paradoxes possible, and Lys had mastered them with the same grace she used to unmake lovers. <words>79</words>  
She crouched by the pool’s edge, restlessly curious, watching the sky’s mirrored dance for signs of her next client. <words>96</words>  
The gravity of desires pulled people here—those who had tried to escape their pasts by leaping into futures they didn’t understand. <words>117</words>  
Lys had once done the same, zipping through centuries by tracking cloud trails that only she could interpret. <words>134</words>  
Each trail was a whisper of longing, a vaporous thread of regret or hope, and she followed them like a bloodhound of the heart. <words>157</words>  
Today, the trail was jagged, erratic, and tinged with violet—a rare hue that meant the client was dangerously close to unraveling. <words>178</words>  
She zipped her leather jacket, the sound sharp against the hush of the pool, and stepped onto the mirrored surface. <words>197</words>  
The pool held her weight like a promise, rippling only slightly as she walked toward the trail’s origin. <words>213</words>  
He stood there, a man with eyes like broken clocks and a voice that trembled with unshed yesterdays. <words>229</words>  
“I came to forget her,” he said, “but I keep remembering myself instead.” <words>241</words>  
Lys tilted her head, amber earrings swinging like pendulums measuring the ache in his soul. <words>255</words>  
“You’re not here to forget,” she said, “you’re here to proclaim yourself free in a cage of illusions.” <words>272</words>  
He blinked, as if her words had struck something buried deep beneath his skin. <words>284</words>  
“I thought time travel would fix it,” he whispered. <words>291</words>  
“It only reveals what you tried to bury,” she replied, kneeling to touch the pool’s surface. <words>305</words>  
A new trail bloomed beneath her fingers, spiraling outward in golden arcs. <words>316</words>  
“Follow this,” she said, “but not to escape—only to understand.” <words>327</words>  
He hesitated, then stepped beside her, their reflections merging into one fractured silhouette. <words>340</words>  
As they walked, the pool shimmered with memories not yet lived, and Lys felt the old ache stir in her chest. <words>361</words>  
She had counseled hundreds, but never herself. <words>368</words>  
The gravity of desires was relentless, and even she was not immune. <words>380</words>  
Still, she moved forward, cautious but impulsive, drawn by the possibility that healing might be mutual. <words>397</words>  
Behind them, the sky reflection pool rippled once, then stilled, holding their secrets like stars in water. <words>414</words>  
And somewhere in the distance, a new trail began to form. <words>423</words>
