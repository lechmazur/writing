At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, the skeptical minstrel known as Thimble Jack crept into the ruins of the disappearing ink factory, his lute slung across his back like a forgotten promise. <words>28</words>  
He wasn’t there for melodies—he was there to out-scheme an immortal trickster who had once convinced a kingdom to trade its crown for a jar of pickles. <words>51</words>  
The factory hissed with the breath of ancient steam vents, their whispers guiding Jack deeper into the rusted belly of the place like a trail of ghostly breadcrumbs. <words>74</words>  
He paused beside a vat labeled “Permanent Vanishing,” where he’d hidden a slingshot carved from the wishbone of a saint and strung with unicorn hair. <words>97</words>  
Jack’s plan was impossibly plausible, the kind of scheme that only worked if you didn’t think about it too hard—which, fortunately, the trickster never did. <words>120</words>  
He retrieved the slingshot and loaded it with a scrap of dragon-scale armor, the only thing the trickster feared, having once lost a bet to a dragon named Kevin. <words>145</words>  
The armor shimmered with residual heat, pulsing like a heartbeat, and Jack grinned with irreverent awe at the idea that this ridiculous plan might actually work. <words>168</words>  
He followed the hiss of a steam vent that sounded suspiciously like laughter until he reached the central chamber, where the trickster lounged on a throne of unpaid parking tickets. <words>193</words>  
“Jack!” the trickster boomed, juggling invisible apples, “Come to trade your soul for a kazoo again?” <words>207</words>  
“Not today,” Jack said, raising the slingshot and aiming it at the trickster’s smug grin. <words>219</words>  
The trickster laughed, but it faltered when he saw the dragon-scale scrap glinting in the light of a flickering emergency exit sign. <words>241</words>  
“You wouldn’t,” he said, suddenly less immortal and more mortal. <words>252</words>  
Jack fired. <words>254</words>  
The scrap struck the throne, which exploded into a cloud of overdue citations and glitter, sending the trickster tumbling into a vat of disappearing ink. <words>278</words>  
As the trickster vanished with a yelp and a burp, Jack muttered, “Reckless generosity, my foot,” and pocketed a glowing coin that had fallen from the trickster’s robe. <words>303</words>  
He left the factory via a steam vent that hissed like applause, the coin burning a hole in his pocket and his conscience. <words>324</words>  
Outside, the mailbox remained empty, but Jack knew better than to trust silence—it was just the trickster’s way of saying “to be continued.” <words>348</words>  
He strummed his lute once, a chord that sounded like a wink, and walked off into the midday shadows, already plotting his next impossibly plausible scheme. <words>370</words>
