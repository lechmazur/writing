The forgotten city hall, once a marble monument to civic pride, now sagged under ivy and silence, its rot masked only by the faint scent of must in a shuttered children’s theater tucked behind the council chamber. <words>33</words> 

Ambassador Lira stepped through the warped doors, her boots crunching over broken crayons and brittle programs, her expression a mask of abrasive calm. <words>52</words> 

She was a measured diplomat, trained in twelve languages and three forms of psychological warfare, but today she came not to negotiate peace, but to decode genetic patterns. <words>77</words> 

The fox tail tassel she wore on her belt, once torn from a bandit who’d ambushed her envoy, swayed with each step—a reminder of the price of revenge. <words>104</words> 

She had jested once, long ago, that diplomacy was just war with better lighting, but the joke had curdled in her mouth after the massacre at Varn’s Crossing. <words>132</words> 

Now, amid drum circles echoing from the anarchist camps outside the city, she sought answers buried in the DNA of the fallen, encoded in blood and betrayal. <words>160</words> 

The children’s theater had been chosen for its isolation, but also for the way the musty air preserved the organic traces of those who had once screamed and laughed here. <words>190</words> 

Her scanner, an organically synthetic device grown in a vat and bonded to her nervous system, pulsed against her palm as it absorbed the ambient genetic residue. <words>218</words> 

She crouched beside a puppet stage, brushing aside a moth-eaten curtain to reveal a smear of dried blood—bandit, child, or councilor, she couldn’t yet tell. <words>244</words> 

The tassel twitched as if alive, reacting to the proximity of its former owner’s kin, and Lira’s jaw tightened. <words>260</words> 

Revenge had cost her a sister, a city, and the last shreds of her idealism, but it had also given her clarity. <words>282</words> 

She no longer believed in justice, only in patterns—genetic, behavioral, historical—and how they could be bent, broken, or rewritten. <words>304</words> 

The scanner beeped softly, confirming a match: the bandit’s bloodline had infiltrated the rebel camps, their leader a descendant of the man who’d worn the fox tail first. <words>336</words> 

Lira stood, her silhouette framed by the cracked stained glass of forgotten governance, and whispered a jest to the empty room: “Peace is just revenge with better manners.” <words>368</words> 

Outside, the drums grew louder, but inside, she smiled—because now she knew exactly what to say to end the war before it began. <words>392</words> 

And this time, she would not pay the price alone. <words>400</words>
