The high-altitude tea house clung to the cliffside like a stubborn weed, its windows fogged with steam and secrets. <words>21</words>  
Inside, patrons sipped oolong and whispered about the mad botanist who had arrived with a crate of carnivorous plants and a worn-out leather belt. <words>42</words>  
Dr. Elowen Gratch, comically serious in demeanor and wild of hair, adjusted her cracked spectacles and muttered about ionizing spores. <words>60</words>  
She had come not for tea, but for the intermission between film reels, when the projectionist changed reels behind the velvet curtain. <words>78</words>  
The tea house doubled as a cinema, and tonight’s feature was a black-and-white documentary on Himalayan cloud formations. <words>92</words>  
Elowen believed that hidden sections in the film reel contained clues to ancient pathways lost to time and altitude. <words>108</words>  
She had once ionized a moss sample to reveal a map etched in chlorophyll, and now sought a similar revelation. <words>126</words>  
Her carnivorous plants, nestled in ceramic pots, twitched with anticipation, sensing the electromagnetic charge of the reel room. <words>141</words>  
The worn-out leather belt around her waist held vials of reactive pollen and a tiny projector lens. <words>155</words>  
As the lights dimmed and the first reel ended, Elowen slipped behind the curtain with the grace of a creeping vine. <words>172</words>  
The projectionist, loyal only to the highest bidder, gave her a fickle nod and handed over the reel with a shrug. <words>189</words>  
She unspooled the film, revealing frames that shimmered oddly, as if ionized by some ancient energy. <words>202</words>  
Using her lens, she magnified the hidden sections—tiny glyphs danced between frames, visible only in the flicker of projection. <words>218</words>  
The glyphs matched those she’d seen in a petrified orchid deep in the Andes, suggesting a transcontinental network of botanical waypoints. <words>236</words>  
Her plants hissed softly, their leaves curling in recognition, as if the film whispered truths only they could hear. <words>251</words>  
Elowen’s heart pounded; the pathway was real, and it began here, above the clouds, in a tea house of shifting loyalties. <words>267</words>  
She replaced the reel just as the lights flickered back on, her expression unreadable beneath her comically serious brow. <words>281</words>  
Back at her table, she sipped lukewarm tea and fed a fly to her smallest plant, which burped contentedly. <words>296</words>  
The patrons resumed their murmurs, unaware that the mad botanist had just decoded an ancient map from a forgotten reel. <words>312</words>  
Outside, the wind howled like a warning, but Elowen only smiled, her belt creaking as she stood to leave. <words>327</words>  
She had a path to follow, one ionized frame at a time, through jungles, ruins, and the roots of forgotten empires. <words>346</words>  
The tea house would remember her, as it remembered all who sought answers in steam, celluloid, and soil. <words>360</words>  
And somewhere, far below, the ancient pathways stirred, awakened by flickering light and the hunger of curious leaves. <words>376</words>
