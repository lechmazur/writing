The glass desert shimmered beneath a pale sun, its crystalline dunes refracting light into a thousand fractured rainbows. <words>17</words>  
Elias trudged forward, his boots crunching against the brittle surface, each step echoing like a question he couldn’t answer. <words>33</words>  
He was a missionary, or had been, though the title clung to him like a name he no longer believed in. <words>47</words>  
Faith had once been his compass, but now it was a riddle he couldn’t solve, especially here, during the migration of the last monarch butterfly. <words>65</words>  
The butterflies passed overhead in a slow, golden tide, their wings whispering secrets he couldn’t quite hear. <words>77</words>  
He carried a tarnished silver fork in his satchel, the only relic from the monastery that had exiled him. <words>91</words>  
They had called him capriciously consistent—too unpredictable in method, too unwavering in belief, a contradiction they could not abide. <words>106</words>  
But Elias had seen something in the desert, something that made him believe magic was real, and that he could become its conduit. <words>123</words>  
He reached the piano buried half in sand, its keys exposed like bones, its strings rusted and wild. <words>136</words>  
Each night, he played it—not with music, but with intention—decoding patterns in its untuned echoes. <words>149</words>  
The sounds bounced off the glass dunes, returning in warped harmonics that only he seemed to understand. <words>162</words>  
He believed the desert was speaking, and that the fork was the key to unlocking its language. <words>175</words>  
He held it up now, watching the butterflies swirl around him, their wings brushing his skin like absolution. <words>188</words>  
He struck a note, then another, listening as the echoes returned in a rhythm that matched his heartbeat. <words>202</words>  
He concealed his doubts beneath the ritual, burying them like seeds in sand, hoping they would bloom into certainty. <words>216</words>  
The fork vibrated in his hand, humming with a frequency that made his teeth ache and his soul stir. <words>230</words>  
He played faster, the notes chaotic yet deliberate, a capriciously consistent pattern that mirrored his own fractured faith. <words>244</words>  
The butterflies descended, forming a spiral around him, their wings beating in time with the piano’s dissonant song. <words>258</words>  
He wept—not from sorrow, but from recognition—as the echoes revealed a map etched in sound and light. <words>271</words>  
The fork pointed toward a dune that shimmered differently, as if concealing something beneath its mirrored surface. <words>284</words>  
He walked toward it, the butterflies parting like a curtain, the piano’s final note still ringing in his ears. <words>298</words>  
He knelt and dug with trembling hands, uncovering a hollow chamber filled with symbols he had seen only in dreams. <words>313</words>  
The fork fit perfectly into a slot at the center, and when he turned it, the chamber pulsed with warmth. <words>327</words>  
Magic surged through him—not as power, but as understanding—and for the first time, his faith felt earned. <words>340</words>  
He was alone, but not lonely, intimate with the desert’s truth, no longer a missionary, but a vessel. <words>353</words>  
The butterflies rose in a final spiral, their migration complete, their purpose fulfilled in him. <words>365</words>  
He smiled, the fork still warm in his hand, as the glass desert sang its silent hymn. <words>377</words>
