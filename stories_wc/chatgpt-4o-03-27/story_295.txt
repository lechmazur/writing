The moon hung low over the witch’s herb garden, casting silver light on rows of mandrake, wolfsbane, and thyme, where a jovial sellsword named Corwin knelt beside an astronomical telescope. <words>28</words> 

He adjusted the brass instrument with a grin, its lenses fogged slightly from the garden’s fragrant mist, and muttered, “Stars don’t lie, but people do.” <words>47</words> 

Corwin had come not for stargazing, but to fulfill a family tradition: burying a time capsule during a moment of transformation. <words>63</words> 

Tonight marked the end of his mercenary days and the beginning of something far stranger. <words>74</words> 

He was boldly reluctant to abandon the sword, but the withering vow he’d made to his dying mother echoed louder than steel. <words>91</words> 

“Dethrone doubt from your mind,” she had whispered, “and plant your truth where it can grow.” <words>104</words> 

So here he was, in a garden owned by a witch who brewed chaos like tea, seeking treasure not of gold, but of clarity. <words>123</words> 

The witch, a wiry woman with eyes like stormglass, emerged from the shadows, her hands stained green from nettle and rue. <words>139</words> 

“You brought the telescope?” she asked, voice like wind through bone chimes. <words>149</words> 

Corwin nodded, lifting it with reverence; it had belonged to his grandfather, a stargazer who once charted comets and curses alike. <words>166</words> 

“Place it there,” she said, pointing to a circle of lavender and ash. <words>176</words> 

As he set it down, the ground shimmered, and the stars above seemed to pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat. <words>190</words> 

The witch began to chant, her words curling like smoke, and Corwin felt the vow within him tighten, then unravel. <words>205</words> 

Visions flooded his mind—battles fought, laughter shared, doubts harbored like rusted daggers. <words>215</words> 

He saw himself not as a blade-for-hire, but as a keeper of stories, a guardian of forgotten truths. <words>229</words> 

The telescope glowed, revealing constellations that danced into symbols—his family crest, a sword entwined with ivy, and a capsule sealed in wax. <words>247</words> 

He dug into the soil, unearthing a small iron box, its hinges creaking like old memories. <words>259</words> 

Inside lay letters from ancestors, each confessing their fears and triumphs, each vowing to pass on courage. <words>272</words> 

Corwin added his own parchment, inked with a single line: “I chose to change.” <words>283</words> 

He resealed the capsule and buried it beneath the telescope, anchoring his transformation in earth and starlight. <words>296</words> 

The witch smiled, her mayhem momentarily elegant, and said, “You’ve treasured what matters.” <words>307</words> 

Corwin stood, lighter than he’d ever felt, the weight of doubt dethroned by the gravity of purpose. <words>320</words> 

As dawn crept over the herb garden, he walked away—not as a sellsword, but as a seeker of meaning. <words>334</words> 

Behind him, the telescope gleamed, a sentinel over buried truths and blooming resolve. <words>345</words> 

The garden rustled with unseen laughter, and the stars winked approval from a sky now forever changed. <words>358</words> 

Corwin’s footsteps faded into the morning, each one echoing the vow he had rewritten in soil and starlight. <words>371</words> 

And somewhere deep in the earth, the capsule waited, a treasure of transformation for the next reluctant soul. <words>384</words>
