In the labyrinthine bookstore that spiraled up the entire mountain, the meandering bard known only as Lark wandered between shelves like a ghost in exile. <words>23</words>  
He was a man of ordinarily extraordinary presence—his voice a cracked violin, his eyes twin lanterns flickering with stories unsaid. <words>43</words>  
The bookstore, called “The Spine,” was a place where time folded in on itself, and books whispered secrets to those who dared to listen. <words>66</words>  
Lark had come not to read, but to sow warmth into the cold soil of forgotten hearts, using the only method he trusted: subversive puppet shows in seedy bars hidden within the stacks. <words>101</words>  
Each bar was a nook carved between genres—romance beside horror, philosophy beside cookbooks—where patrons drank ink-dark ale and watched shadows dance. <words>125</words>  
Lark’s puppets were stitched from old bookmarks and bound pages, their mouths sewn shut with thread from abandoned journals. <words>145</words>  
He gave them voices, not his own, but borrowed from the books themselves, and through them, he told stories that radiated warmth like a hearth in winter. <words>174</words>  
One night, during the lull before an apologetic text was sent from a trembling hand in the poetry aisle, Lark unveiled his most curious prop yet. <words>204</words>  
A set of dentures, yellowed and cracked, rumored to belong to the long-dead philosopher-poet Elian Voss, whose words once stirred revolutions. <words>229</words>  
He placed them in the mouth of a puppet shaped like a broken compass, and the crowd leaned in, breath held, as if expecting the dead to speak. <words>259</words>  
And speak it did—not in words, but in a warmth that spread from puppet to patron, a heat that melted cynicism like wax. <words>283</words>  
The dentures clicked with eerie rhythm as the puppet recited verses that had never been written, only felt, and the bar fell silent. <words>308</words>  
Lark watched them—drunks, scholars, lost lovers—each face lit by something ancient and tender, something they thought they’d buried. <words>330</words>  
He wasn’t sure if the warmth came from the dentures, the puppet, or the story itself, but he knew it was real. <words>353</words>  
After the show, a woman with ink-stained fingers approached him, tears carving paths through dust on her cheeks. <words>373</words>  
“My father used to quote Voss,” she whispered, “but I forgot how it felt to believe in anything.” <words>392</words>  
Lark handed her the puppet, now silent, its warmth lingering like a memory. <words>405</words>  
“Then sow it,” he said, “wherever hearts have gone cold.” <words>414</words>  
She nodded, and somewhere deep in the stacks, a phone buzzed—a message sent, apology blooming like a late rose. <words>437</words>  
Lark turned, his cloak catching the scent of old pages, and vanished into the maze, a bard with no home but the stories he left behind. <words>467</words>  
And in his wake, warmth. <words>471</words>
