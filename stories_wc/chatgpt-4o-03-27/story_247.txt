The weathered poet arrived at the mountaintop just as the last flicker of electricity surrendered to the storm. <words>17</words>  
He welcomed the outage like an old friend, for only in darkness could he hear the sacred flows whisper. <words>33</words>  
The labyrinth of bonsai forests bloomed wildly around him, their miniature branches trembling with secrets too old for cities. <words>49</words>  
He carried no map, only an ideally messy notebook filled with half-rhymes and diagrams of imagined currents. <words>63</words>  
Each tree, he believed, was a lung of the mountain, and he had come with an invitation to breathe. <words>78</words>  
He paused at a clearing where the wind tangled his beard and the scent of wet bark clung to his coat. <words>94</words>  
There, nestled in moss, lay an unmarked makeup compact, its mirror cracked like a spider’s web. <words>106</words>  
He grasped it gently, as if it might vanish, and opened it to find a faded reflection of his younger self. <words>122</words>  
The compact pulsed with memory, and he remembered her—the barista who wrote confessions on coffee cup sleeves. <words>136</words>  
She had once scribbled, “I dream of forests that breathe,” and he had never forgotten. <words>147</words>  
He had read her sleeve every morning, decoding her soul one latte at a time, until she disappeared. <words>161</words>  
Now, in the bonsai labyrinth, her words returned like echoes, guiding him deeper into the sacred geometry of roots. <words>176</words>  
He followed the flow, stepping over twisted trunks and under archways of living wood, each breath a poem. <words>189</words>  
The storm above raged with joyful dread, thunder applauding his pilgrimage, lightning illuminating the path ahead. <words>202</words>  
He stopped at a bonsai shaped like a spiral galaxy, its leaves trembling with unseen rhythm. <words>214</words>  
There, he placed the compact at its base, an offering to the mountain’s memory. <words>225</words>  
The wind stilled, and in that silence, he felt her presence—not as a ghost, but as breath. <words>238</words>  
He opened his notebook and wrote, “To map sacred flows is to follow the confessions of trees.” <words>251</words>  
The compact shimmered once, then dulled, its purpose fulfilled, its mirror now reflecting only sky. <words>263</words>  
He smiled, ideally messy and wholly alive, and turned back through the labyrinth, each step a stanza. <words>275</words>  
The power would return eventually, but he had found a current no outage could sever. <words>287</words>  
Back at the summit’s edge, he brewed tea over a fire of pine needles and read her final sleeve. <words>301</words>  
It said, “If you find the forest, breathe for me.” <words>307</words>  
He did. <words>309</words>  
And the mountain breathed back. <words>313</words>
