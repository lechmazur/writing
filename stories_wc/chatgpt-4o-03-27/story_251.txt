The lunar mining colony of Selene’s Scar shimmered under the pale light of Earthrise, its domes cracked like old marbles forgotten in a child’s pocket. <words>21</words>  
Inside Dome 7, Prophet Elian sat cross-legged on a crate of oxygen canisters, his eyes closed, his smile happily sad. <words>36</words>  
He was known as the ambivalent prophet, a man who foresaw futures but never cared enough to warn anyone—unless the mood struck him. <words>52</words>  
Today, the mood had struck like a meteor through glass. <words>58</words>  
In his lap rested a cracked collection of marbles, each one representing a failed prophecy, a misstep in fate’s choreography. <words>72</words>  
He rolled one between his fingers, whispering the final oath: “Let the scoreboard scramble, let the stars forget their order.” <words>85</words>  
The oath was ancient, older than lunar dust, passed down through prophets who had long since defragmented their minds into cosmic clarity. <words>99</words>  
But Elian’s mind was a jigsaw puzzle, its edges frayed and mismatched, pieces found in a rummage sale box on Earth decades ago. <words>114</words>  
He had bought the box for a single credit, drawn by the image on the lid—a sky torn open by laughter. <words>128</words>  
Each puzzle piece he’d assembled since then had whispered secrets between heartbeats, truths too slippery for linear time. <words>140</words>  
Now, with the marbles trembling in his palm, he felt the moment arrive—not in seconds, but in the breathless space between them. <words>155</words>  
The colony’s miners, unaware of the cosmic scoreboard’s impending scramble, argued over oxygen rations and the price of synthetic whiskey. <words>168</words>  
Elian stood, his robe stitched from old mining flags, and walked to the central dome where the gravity regulators hummed like sleeping gods. <words>183</words>  
He placed the cracked marbles in a circle on the floor, aligning them with the puzzle pieces he’d carried in his satchel for years. <words>198</words>  
Each edge clicked into place with a sound like forgotten prayers, forming a mosaic of chaos and symmetry. <words>210</words>  
The final piece, shaped like a crescent moon, fit into the center, and the floor beneath him pulsed with ancient algorithms. <words>223</words>  
Elian laughed, bashfully arrogant, as if apologizing to the universe for being clever enough to undo its scoreboard. <words>235</words>  
The marbles cracked further, releasing light that smelled like childhood and endings. <words>243</words>  
Miners dropped their tools, eyes wide, as the dome filled with visions—alternate lives, reversed deaths, scrambled destinies. <words>256</words>  
Elian’s voice echoed: “This is not a warning. This is a gift wrapped in entropy.” <words>266</words>  
He felt himself defragment, not into clarity, but into joyful disarray, his atoms dancing between heartbeats. <words>277</words>  
The scoreboard above the colony—an ancient satellite tracking fate—flickered, then displayed a single word: NULL. <words>288</words>  
Elian’s body dissolved into puzzle pieces, each one drifting toward a different star, carrying fragments of the final oath. <words>301</words>  
The miners wept, happily sad, unsure if they had lost a prophet or gained a new kind of freedom. <words>313</words>  
In the silence that followed, the marbles reassembled themselves into a new pattern, one no prophet had ever dared to see. <words>327</words>  
And somewhere, between heartbeats, the universe blinked—bashfully, arrogantly—and began again. <words>336</words>
