Sir Cedric of Haldenmoor, a straight-laced knight with a penchant for order and a sword polished to mirror shine, found himself ankle-deep in the luminous swamp of Virellia, where the moss glowed like moonlight and frogs hummed in baritone. <words>33</words> 

He had come not for battle or glory, but to verify the existence of a fossilized snail shell said to whisper secrets of forgotten kings. <words>55</words> 

The shell was the centerpiece of an urban legend he’d been chasing since the scoreboard reset at the Grand Jousting Championship, where his lance had snapped and his destiny had, quite literally, splintered. <words>84</words> 

He’d lost the match, but gained a new obsession—collecting tales that danced on the edge of truth and myth. <words>99</words> 

The swamp, with its phosphorescent vines and air thick with the scent of wet stone, was the last known location of the shell. <words>117</words> 

As he reached for the final item on a crooked shelf in a half-sunken apothecary’s hut—a moss-covered jar labeled “Snail, Eternal”—his gauntlet bumped another hand. <words>143</words> 

Startled, he turned to see a woman in a tattered academic robe, her eyes sharp with mischief and intellect. <words>160</words> 

“Apologies,” she said, not sounding sorry at all. <words>168</words> 

“I’m Professor Elira Vance, expelled from the Royal Academy for suggesting dragons once taught philosophy.” <words>183</words> 

Cedric blinked. <words>185</words> 

“I’m Sir Cedric. I verify legends.” <words>192</words> 

“Then we’re rivals,” she said, grinning. <words>200</words> 

“Or allies,” he replied, surprising himself with the warmth in his voice. <words>211</words> 

They examined the jar together, and inside, nestled in velvet moss, was the fossilized snail shell, spiraled like a galaxy. <words>230</words> 

Elira whispered, “They say if you listen closely, it tells you where your path converges with another’s.” <words>247</words> 

Cedric, ever the skeptic, pressed the shell to his ear—and heard not words, but the echo of his own heartbeat, steady and shared. <words>267</words> 

Elira leaned in, her breath warm. <words>274</words> 

“Destinies don’t always clash,” she murmured. <words>282</words> 

“Sometimes they converge.” <words>285</words> 

They left the swamp together, the jar between them, glowing faintly like a lantern of fate. <words>299</words> 

Cedric still polished his armor and followed rules, but now he also listened to whispers in the dark. <words>316</words> 

Elira still challenged academia, but now she had a knight who believed in her madness. <words>330</words> 

Together, they hunted legends—not to debunk or prove, but to feel the pulse of stories that refused to die. <words>349</words> 

And somewhere in the luminous swamp, the frogs sang of converging destinies, and the moss remembered their names. <words>365</words> 

Because sometimes, the last item on the shelf isn’t just a relic—it’s a beginning. <words>379</words> 

And sometimes, bumping into someone is the universe’s way of saying, “Now.” <words>392</words> 

Sir Cedric and Professor Elira never returned to the championship, but they kept score in legends, and the scoreboard never reset again. <words>412</words> 

In the end, the fossilized snail shell whispered only one truth: destiny is not a path, but a meeting point. <words>432</words> 

And they had arrived. <words>435</words>
