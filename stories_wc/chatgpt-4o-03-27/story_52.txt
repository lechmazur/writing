When the chalk lines on the sidewalk fade away, the hourglass marketplace hums to life, its grains of sand shifting like breath through the glass dome above. <words>25</words> 

Vendors shout tastefully offensive slogans—“Our figs are sexier than your ex!”—while spices and secrets swirl in the air. <words>39</words> 

Among them, Juno slips through the crowd, a hopeful pickpocket with nimble fingers and a heart full of ache. <words>52</words> 

She isn’t after coin today, but something heavier: a truth she’s carried too long, one that sears her soul. <words>66</words> 

Her fingers brush a broken pencil sharpener in her coat pocket, the last thing her brother gave her before vanishing into the sands. <words>81</words> 

He’d said, “When it stops working, I’ll be gone,” and it hasn’t sharpened a thing since. <words>92</words> 

Juno weaves past a stall selling hourglass-shaped pastries, her eyes scanning for the man with the cobalt scarf. <words>104</words> 

He’s the only one who might know where her brother went—and why he left. <words>114</words> 

She finds him near the spice merchant, humming a tune that stirs something ancient in her bones. <words>126</words> 

Without thinking, she joins in, their voices rising in a spontaneous karaoke duet that draws a curious crowd. <words>139</words> 

Their harmony materializes something strange: a shimmer in the air, like heat off stone, and then a door. <words>152</words> 

The crowd gasps, but Juno steps forward, devotion driving her deeper than fear ever could. <words>164</words> 

Inside, time slows; the walls are lined with chalk drawings of people who’ve disappeared. <words>175</words> 

She sees her brother’s face, younger, smiling, etched beside a message: “I left to protect you.” <words>187</words> 

Tears sting her eyes, but she smiles—blithe discontent curling at the edges of her grief. <words>198</words> 

The man with the scarf appears beside her, no longer humming. <words>206</words> 

“He gave up his place in time to keep you safe,” he says, voice low. <words>218</words> 

Juno clutches the broken sharpener, understanding now that devotion isn’t always gentle—it can be jagged, desperate, and still beautiful. <words>232</words> 

She steps back into the marketplace, the door vanishing behind her like a mirage. <words>243</words> 

The vendors resume their banter, unaware of the moment that just passed. <words>253</words> 

Juno walks on, lighter somehow, her secret no longer a burden but a bond. <words>264</words> 

She slips the sharpener into a child’s pocket, a quiet promise passed on. <words>275</words> 

The chalk lines may fade, but some truths materialize only when we sing them aloud. <words>287</words> 

And in the depths of devotion, even a pickpocket can find something worth keeping. <words>298</words> 

She hums the duet’s melody, letting it guide her through the shifting sands of the hourglass. <words>311</words> 

Each note a step forward, each breath a tribute to the brother who vanished for love. <words>323</words> 

The marketplace spins on, time-worn and eternal, as Juno disappears into its rhythm. <words>334</words> 

Somewhere, a new chalk line is drawn, waiting to fade. <words>341</words> 

And somewhere else, devotion waits to be sung again. <words>348</words>
