The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of the abandoned carnival prize booth, where dust clung to faded plush toys and rusted tin trinkets. <words>21</words> 

Among the debris stood Elian, a bookbinder with telekinetic powers, his fingers twitching as if still stitching spines in forgotten libraries. <words>39</words> 

He wore a strictly casual blazer over a threadbare T-shirt, the kind of contradiction that made him invisible to most, yet unforgettable to those who noticed. <words>60</words> 

In his palm lay a single chopstick wrapper, creased and yellowed, the last remnant of a meal shared with a mentor who vanished into myth. <words>81</words> 

A sudden gust rattled a tin bell above the booth, and the sound triggered a flashback so vivid it knocked Elian to his knees. <words>100</words> 

He saw the mentor again—eyes like stormglass, voice like thunder—whispering, “Transformation is not a gift, Elian, it’s a toll.” <words>115</words> 

The carnival around him shimmered, and for a moment, the booth revived: lights flickered, laughter echoed, and the scent of candied almonds filled the air. <words>134</words> 

Elian’s telekinesis surged, lifting the wrapper into a slow orbit around his head, as if it too remembered the weight of that long-lost evening. <words>153</words> 

He had come not for nostalgia, but for knowledge—the kind buried beneath layers of legend, the kind that demanded sacrifice. <words>169</words> 

The wrapper unfolded mid-air, revealing a hidden glyph inked in crimson, a sigil of metamorphosis known only to those who’d paid the price. <words>188</words> 

Another sound bite—a child’s giggle—sent him spiraling into a memory of his first binding, when a book screamed as he stitched its cursed pages. <words>208</words> 

He had thought then that knowledge was power, but now he knew: knowledge was hunger, and he was starving. <words>222</words> 

The booth’s shadows deepened, and from them emerged echoes of those who’d sought transformation and failed, their eyes hollow, their hands reaching. <words>240</words> 

Elian stood, the wrapper now glowing, his telekinesis weaving the air into threads of possibility, stitching past and present into a single tapestry. <words>259</words> 

He whispered the glyph’s name, and the booth trembled, its prizes twitching as if remembering their purpose. <words>272</words> 

One by one, the echoes faded, revived not as ghosts but as truths, each revealing a fragment of the transformation Elian sought. <words>289</words> 

He saw himself not as a man, but as a vessel—binding stories, reviving legends, paying the toll with every stitch. <words>305</words> 

The wrapper disintegrated, its purpose fulfilled, and Elian turned from the booth, his steps echoing across the tapestry of lost legends. <words>322</words> 

Behind him, the carnival sighed, its silence now sacred, its secrets entrusted to the only one who dared to bind them. <words>338</words> 

Elian’s blazer flapped in the wind, strictly casual still, but his eyes burned with the solemn fire of one who had transformed. <words>355</words> 

He had learned that the price of knowledge was not pain, but permanence—the inability to forget what had been revived. <words>371</words> 

And as the final bell tolled, he vanished into myth, a bookbinder whose bindings held the weight of worlds. <words>386</words>
