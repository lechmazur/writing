The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of skyscrapers as Jalen crouched on the edge of the rooftop farm, his fingers brushing the brittle leaves of a dying tomato vine. <words>27</words>  
He had never intended to become anything more than a scavenger, but the world had a way of coercing purpose from even the most reluctant souls. <words>49</words>  
Below, the city lay in ruins, a graveyard of ambition and ash, and above, the stars blinked like indifferent gods. <words>65</words>  
Jalen’s softly militant resolve had grown not from rage, but from the quiet insistence that something must be salvaged from the wreckage. <words>84</words>  
He had found the mariner’s spyglass in a dusty attic, tucked beneath a child’s drawing of a boat sailing toward a sun that no longer rose. <words>108</words>  
The brass was tarnished, the lenses cracked, but when he peered through it, the world shifted—lines of energy, unseen before, danced across the sky. <words>132</words>  
He didn’t understand it at first, but the spyglass revealed patterns, constellations of loss and gravity, as if the universe mourned with him. <words>155</words>  
Each night, in the space between the first tear and the final sigh, he mapped the celestial architecture, trying to decode the balance that had once held everything together. <words>185</words>  
The rooftop farm, once a desperate attempt at survival, had become his observatory, a sanctuary where he could dissect the cosmos with dirt under his nails. <words>210</words>  
He remembered the day the sky cracked open—the day his sister vanished in a flash of light, leaving behind only her journal and a half-planted row of carrots. <words>239</words>  
Her words, softly militant like his own thoughts, had urged him to look beyond survival, to seek understanding in the ruins. <words>260</words>  
So he scoured dusty attics, not for food or fuel, but for relics—fragments of a world that once believed in meaning. <words>281</words>  
The spyglass was the key, he was certain now, not to escape, but to comprehend the weight of what had been lost. <words>303</words>  
Through it, he saw not just stars, but echoes—memories of laughter, of cities breathing, of oceans that hadn’t yet boiled away. <words>325</words>  
He was a late-blooming hero, not forged in fire, but in silence, in the slow realization that awe could be a form of resistance. <words>349</words>  
And as dawn threatened the horizon with its pale, reluctant light, Jalen raised the spyglass once more, determined to find the balance his sister had believed in. <words>378</words>  
He would not rebuild the world, but he would understand it, and in that understanding, perhaps, plant the first seed of something new. <words>400</words>
