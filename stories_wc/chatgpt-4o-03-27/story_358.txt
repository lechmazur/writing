The arctic wind howled against the reinforced glass of the research greenhouse, where frost bloomed like ghostly flowers across the panes. <words>21</words>  
Inside, amid rows of bioluminescent moss and genetically modified snow-peas, an old-fashioned mage named Thasselby adjusted his velvet cuffs with trembling fingers. <words>42</words>  
He had arrived not by sled or plane, but through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections, each one a portal stitched from forgotten spells. <words>63</words>  
Thasselby’s purpose was as ancient as it was obscure: to claim an uncharted frontier hidden beneath the ice, where riddles whispered in hieroglyphs. <words>84</words>  
Clutched in his gloved hand was a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, etched with symbols that shimmered when touched by moonlight. <words>103</words>  
The fragment pulsed now, faintly, as if sensing the proximity of its long-lost twin buried beneath the greenhouse’s foundation. <words>120</words>  
Children’s laughter echoed faintly from the nearby research station’s playground, a jarring contrast to the sanctified dread curling in Thasselby’s gut. <words>141</words>  
It was playground time, and the scientists’ children ran in circles, unaware that beneath their feet lay a riddle older than language. <words>162</words>  
Thasselby moved purposefully aimless through the greenhouse, his steps tracing a pattern only he could see, guided by the coffin’s pulse. <words>183</words>  
He paused before a mirror used by botanists to reflect light onto shaded plants, and in its surface, his reflection blinked. <words>202</words>  
Not him—another version, younger, eyes burning with ambition, holding the same coffin fragment and mouthing a single word: “Cuddle.” <words>221</words>  
The mage’s breath caught; the riddle was unfolding, not in logic, but in paradox—tenderness as the key to ancient power. <words>240</words>  
He knelt and pressed the fragment to the soil, whispering the word aloud, and the ground trembled with a low, reverent hum. <words>261</words>  
From the earth rose a sarcophagus of ice, its surface etched with mirrored glyphs that shimmered like starlight on water. <words>280</words>  
Thasselby reached out, and the lid dissolved into mist, revealing not a mummy, but a child curled in sleep, arms open. <words>299</words>  
He hesitated, then leaned in to cuddle the child, and in that embrace, the riddle completed itself—love as the final frontier. <words>320</words>  
The greenhouse lights flickered, and every mirror within showed not reflections, but memories—ephemeral encounters that had led him here. <words>339</words>  
He saw himself as a boy, aimless yet yearning, always searching for something he could never name until now. <words>358</words>  
The child in the coffin stirred, eyes opening to reveal galaxies, and whispered, “You’ve charted it.” <words>373</words>  
Outside, the children’s laughter faded, and the ice beneath the greenhouse began to melt, revealing a path forward. <words>392</words>  
Thasselby stood, the child in his arms, and stepped into the unknown, the riddle now part of him. <words>409</words>  
Behind him, the mirrors shattered, their purpose fulfilled, and the greenhouse bloomed with impossible flowers. <words>426</words>  
The frontier was no longer uncharted—it was held, gently, in a cuddle. <words>439</words>
