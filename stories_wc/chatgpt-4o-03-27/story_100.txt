At the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken, Lira stood beneath the silver-barked apple trees of the enchanted orchard, her pressed penny collection clinking softly in her satchel. <words>29</words>  
She was a vivid dreamer, known in her village for sleepwalking into truths no one dared to name, and for waking with riddles on her tongue. <words>51</words>  
Tonight, she followed the moon paths—those shifting beams of lunar light that only the dream-touched could see—hoping they would lead her to the patient guardian. <words>74</words>  
The orchard was policed by living statues, carved from obsidian and moss, who oscillated between stillness and sudden, jarring motion whenever a lie passed through the air. <words>100</words>  
Lira had learned to speak only in questions here, a rationally mischievous tactic that kept the statues guessing and her limbs intact. <words>118</words>  
She paused beneath a tree whose fruit glowed with a dull, internal ache, and pulled from her satchel a penny pressed with the image of a weeping moon. <words>142</words>  
Each penny in her collection marked a dream she had survived, and this one—her most recent—had whispered of a cosmic deception so vast it bent time. <words>167</words>  
The patient guardian, a creature of bark and breath, emerged from the roots, its eyes like knots of regret, its voice a rustle of fallen leaves. <words>190</words>  
"You seek the truth," it said, "but truth is a fruit that bruises when bitten." <words>202</words>  
"I seek the lie that shaped the stars," Lira replied, her tone laced with dour amusement, "and the apology the universe forgot to make." <words>225</words>  
The guardian nodded, its branches oscillating gently, as if swaying between permission and denial. <words>236</words>  
"Then you must trade a memory for a map," it said, extending a hand of twigs and twilight. <words>249</words>  
Lira hesitated, then offered the penny of the weeping moon, feeling the memory of that dream slip from her mind like mist. <words>270</words>  
In return, the guardian traced a path in the soil with a single claw, a moon path that shimmered with impossible geometry. <words>289</words>  
"Follow this," it said, "and you will find the architect of the lie, still crafting apologies in the language of silence." <words>308</words>  
As Lira stepped onto the path, the statues turned their heads in unison, their eyes glowing with something like sorrow—or perhaps recognition. <words>330</words>  
She walked, oscillating between fear and resolve, her satchel lighter, her purpose heavier. <words>343</words>  
The orchard faded behind her, and ahead, the moon paths twisted toward a horizon that pulsed with secrets. <words>360</words>  
She would unravel the deception, not to punish, but to understand why the stars had lied—and who they had tried to protect. <words>384</words>  
And perhaps, when the final truth was spoken, the apology would no longer be needed. <words>397</words>
