The floating island spa of Vellum Drift hovered above the clouds like a smug secret, its mineral springs bubbling with the kind of serenity that made even assassins sigh. <words>25</words> 

Among the robed guests lounged a contrite swordsman named Elric, whose hypnotically rigid posture betrayed a man unused to peace. <words>41</words> 

He wore a cracked monocle over his left eye—not for vision, but to remind himself of the duel that had cost him his honor. <words>58</words> 

Elric had come to Vellum Drift not for healing, but to unmask a pretender to the throne rumored to be hiding among the cucumber-masked elite. <words>78</words> 

The spa’s hush, where hope took root in the steam and silence, was the perfect place for secrets to steep. <words>91</words> 

Elric’s only clue was a series of cryptic tattoos inked across his own back, given to him by a dying oracle who’d said, “Unravel these, and truth shall yarn itself.” <words>115</words> 

He’d spent weeks trying to decipher them, until a masseuse named Tilda, with hands like warm bread and a laugh like a hiccuping harp, offered to help. <words>139</words> 

Tilda, who’d once been a codebreaker for the Royal Postal Guild, saw patterns in the tattoos that Elric had missed—knots of meaning, loops of lies. <words>160</words> 

Each session, she’d gently trace the ink with her fingers, unraveling the story like yarn from a stubborn skein. <words>174</words> 

As she worked, Elric found himself loosening too—his guilt, his stiffness, even his monocle’s crack seemed to widen with each chuckle she coaxed from him. <words>193</words> 

One evening, as the moon soaked the spa in silver, Tilda gasped and whispered, “The pretender wears a crown of steam and speaks in borrowed proverbs.” <words>215</words> 

Elric knew then—it was the spa’s owner, Lord Vint, whose hypnotically rigid smile never reached his eyes and whose wisdom was suspiciously plagiarized from fortune cookies. <words>238</words> 

He confronted Vint during the morning gong bath, where accusations echoed louder than gongs. <words>249</words> 

Vint scoffed, but Tilda stepped forward, holding a towel embroidered with the royal seal—one only the true heir would possess. <words>267</words> 

“I found it in your laundry,” she said sweetly, “next to a book titled ‘How to Be King in Ten Easy Aphorisms.’” <words>285</words> 

The guests gasped, their cucumber slices falling like startled coins. <words>293</words> 

Vint tried to flee, but slipped on a patch of exfoliating mud and was promptly detained by a squad of surprisingly muscular aestheticians. <words>313</words> 

Elric, freed by kindness and towel-based espionage, bowed to Tilda, his monocle finally shattering as he laughed without shame. <words>331</words> 

He no longer needed it—the truth was clear, and so was his path forward. <words>343</words> 

He would serve the rightful heir, whoever they may be, and perhaps open a spa of his own, one where guilt was exfoliated daily. <words>365</words> 

Tilda agreed to help, provided she could name the massage oils after obscure punctuation marks. <words>379</words> 

And so, in the hush where hope takes root, a swordsman and a codebreaker began anew—unraveled, unmasked, and unexpectedly moisturized. <words>398</words>
