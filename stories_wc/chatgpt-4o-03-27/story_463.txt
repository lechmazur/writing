The final name was crossed off the list with a flourish that belied the tremor in the sentinel’s hand. <words>20</words>  
He stood alone in the haunted lighthouse keeper’s bedroom, where the wallpaper peeled like old regrets and the wind whispered unfinished apologies. <words>41</words>  
A frayed piece of rope hung from a rusted nail above the bed, its fibers unraveling like the promises that had brought him here. <words>64</words>  
He confiscated it with a sigh, not because it was dangerous, but because it was sentimental—and sentiment had no place in his work. <words>89</words>  
The dry-witted sentinel, known only as Rook, had never believed in ghosts, but he believed in consequences, and this place reeked of both. <words>112</words>  
Each name on the list had belonged to someone who’d tried to modernize the lighthouse without learning the traditional methods first. <words>134</words>  
They’d ignored the old dances, the ones the keepers used to perform on stormy nights to keep the sea from swallowing the light. <words>158</words>  
Rook had learned them in secret, drawn in by a shared love for the intricate footwork and the rhythm that echoed like waves. <words>182</words>  
It was certainly possible, he thought, to honor the past without being trapped by it—but no one else had managed that balance. <words>206</words>  
The rope in his hand had once tethered the keeper’s boots during the dance, a safeguard against slipping into the sea’s embrace. <words>230</words>  
Now it was just another relic, like the list, like the names, like the lighthouse itself—eroding promises carved into stone and salt. <words>254</words>  
He turned to the cracked mirror above the dresser and saw not himself, but the last keeper, eyes hollow with regret and rhythm. <words>278</words>  
“Too late for you,” Rook muttered, “but maybe not for the next fool who thinks electricity can outshine tradition.” <words>296</words>  
He tucked the rope into his coat, its weight oddly comforting, like a hand on his shoulder urging him to keep dancing. <words>318</words>  
Outside, the wind howled approval, or warning—it was hard to tell in a place where even the air remembered betrayal. <words>338</words>  
Rook stepped into the center of the room, boots scuffing the floorboards in time with a rhythm only he still knew. <words>360</words>  
He danced with reckless precision, each step a reclamation, each turn a refusal to let the past be forgotten or misused. <words>384</words>  
The lighthouse groaned around him, but the light above flickered to life, steady and strong, as if it, too, remembered the steps. <words>408</words>  
When he stopped, breathless and alone, the mirror was empty again, and the rope in his coat no longer felt frayed. <words>432</words>  
It felt earned. <words>434</words>
