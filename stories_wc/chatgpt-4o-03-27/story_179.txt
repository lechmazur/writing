The confident watchman, Jaro, stood at the edge of the honeycomb chamber, his boots echoing softly against the waxen floor. <words>17</words>  
He had been stationed inside the giant beehive interior for years, guarding its secrets with a smile that masked a deeper ache. <words>35</words>  
Each day, during the coloring sessions when the hive’s children painted pollen murals on the walls, he felt the echo of yearning stir within him. <words>56</words>  
It wasn’t for the art or the innocence—it was for the quiet envy he harbored toward their freedom to create without consequence. <words>75</words>  
To hush the voice of envy, he had developed a ritual: he would mobilize his thoughts, redirecting them through the patterns in a fingerprint under a microscope. <words>98</words>  
He’d discovered that each fingerprint held a map of longing, and by tracing them, he could understand and release his own. <words>114</words>  
Jaro kept a cracked plastic ruler in his pocket, a relic from his youth, and used it to measure the ridges of each print. <words>134</words>  
The ruler, though broken, was precise—its jagged edge a reminder that even flawed tools could guide healing. <words>149</words>  
He would sit beside the children, forcibly gentle in his movements, helping them blend waxy colors while secretly studying their tiny fingers. <words>169</words>  
Through their prints, he saw dreams of flight, of sunlight beyond the hive, of songs unsung and stories untold. <words>185</words>  
Each pattern whispered a different yearning, and in decoding them, Jaro felt his own burdens lighten. <words>198</words>  
One day, a girl named Luma handed him a drawing of a watchman with wings, his eyes bright with tears. <words>215</words>  
“You look like him,” she said, her voice sticky with honeyed innocence. <words>225</words>  
Jaro laughed, a sound of jubilant remorse, and ruffled her hair with a hand that trembled slightly. <words>239</words>  
He realized then that his envy had never been about the children—it was about the part of himself he had locked away. <words>258</words>  
That night, he mobilized his courage and pressed his own finger under the microscope, tracing the loops and whorls with the cracked ruler. <words>278</words>  
He saw a spiral of longing, a yearning to be more than a guardian—to be a creator, a dreamer, a child again. <words>296</words>  
The next coloring session, Jaro brought his own palette and joined the children, his strokes hesitant but growing bolder with each hue. <words>314</words>  
The hive walls soon bore a new mural: a watchman flying above the combs, his wings made of fingerprints and fractured rulers. <words>332</words>  
The children cheered, and Jaro smiled, the echo of yearning now a harmony within him, no longer a cry. <words>347</words>  
He had hushed the voice of envy not by silencing it, but by listening, understanding, and finally, painting it into joy. <words>366</words>  
And in that jubilant remorse, he found peace, his watch no longer a burden, but a canvas of becoming. <words>380</words>
