Detective Callahan lit his last cigarette with the kind of flair only someone confidently unsure could muster, the ember flaring like a dying star in the hush that follows the final siren. <words>28</words>  
The Vanishing Point Gallery stood before him, a crumbling cathedral of forgotten art and half-remembered sins, its windows blinking like tired eyes. <words>45</words>  
He stepped inside, boots echoing on the marble floor, each step a metronome counting down to something he couldn’t name but felt in his bones. <words>64</words>  
The gallery was empty, save for a single playing card lying face-up beneath a shattered skylight—Queen of Spades, her smile smug with secrets. <words>84</words>  
Callahan crouched, picked it up, and felt the weight of a thousand cases he never solved press against his spine like a loaded gun. <words>102</words>  
He rummaged through the debris, fingers brushing against broken frames and dust-thick canvases, searching for something he couldn’t define but knew he’d recognize. <words>121</words>  
Memories flickered in his mind like static on a dying screen—his partner’s laugh, the scent of blood on rain-soaked pavement, a lullaby sung off-key. <words>141</words>  
He pulled a half-damaged kaleidoscope from beneath a collapsed sculpture, its glass cracked but still catching light in fractured, fleeting images. <words>158</words>  
Holding it to his eye, he saw her—Elena, the one who vanished, the one he couldn’t save—dancing through shards of color and time. <words>176</words>  
Each twist of the kaleidoscope brought a new memory: her hand in his, the warmth of her breath, the moment she slipped away. <words>193</words>  
He laughed, molten sarcasm dripping from his lips like venom, because what else could he do when the past mocked him with beauty? <words>210</words>  
The gallery pulsed around him, walls breathing in and out like a dying animal, as if the building itself remembered more than he did. <words>228</words>  
He pocketed the card, the Queen’s eyes winking at him like she knew the punchline to a joke he’d never get. <words>243</words>  
Outside, the city held its breath, waiting for something—anything—to break the silence that had settled like ash. <words>257</words>  
Callahan lit another cigarette with shaking hands, the flame dancing like Elena once had, just out of reach. <words>271</words>  
He wasn’t here to solve anything anymore; he was here to outdance a looming inevitability, to keep moving before the darkness caught up. <words>290</words>  
The kaleidoscope slipped from his pocket, landing with a soft clink, its images scattering like memories too fragile to hold. <words>306</words>  
He didn’t pick it up. <words>309</words>  
Instead, he walked deeper into the gallery, chasing ghosts through corridors painted with regret and lit by the flicker of dying dreams. <words>327</words>  
Each step was a defiance, a refusal to be still, to be swallowed by the silence that always came after the siren. <words>345</words>  
The Queen of Spades burned in his pocket like a dare, a reminder that some games never end, only change players. <words>362</words>  
And Callahan, overworked and unraveling, smiled like a man who knew the dance was rigged but danced anyway. <words>377</words>
