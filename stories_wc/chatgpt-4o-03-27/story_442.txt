The final rotation of the forgotten windmill groaned through the mushroom house like a dying breath, stirring spores from the velvet walls. <words>21</words>  
Inside, the edgy tradesman known only as Varn adjusted the strap of his toolbelt and muttered, “One last spin, then the dark.” <words>39</words>  
The house’s interior pulsed with a blurry vividness, as if memory itself had been soaked in rain and left to dry crooked. <words>56</words>  
Varn’s fingers brushed the torn corner of a flyer pinned to the spongy wall—its faded ink read: “Vectorize your past—before it forgets you.” <words>76</words>  
He pocketed the scrap, knowing it was the only clue left from the time before the void swallowed the sky. <words>91</words>  
His synchronized watch ticked in harmony with the windmill’s final creak, a countdown shared with no one but himself. <words>106</words>  
Varn had once been a cartographer of forgotten places, but now he mapped only the distortions in his own mind. <words>122</words>  
Each memory he tried to vectorize twisted into something else—his mother’s lullaby became a siren’s wail, his first kiss a mouthful of ash. <words>142</words>  
Still, he pressed on, comfortingly pessimistic, muttering, “If it all burns, at least I’ll know the shape of the fire.” <words>158</words>  
The candle he carried flickered with a stubborn glow, its flame refusing to die even as the air grew thinner. <words>173</words>  
He wasn’t sure if the void was outside or inside him anymore, only that the candle had to reach its end. <words>189</words>  
The mushroom walls began to contract, reacting to the windmill’s final shudder, spores falling like snow in a dream half-remembered. <words>205</words>  
Varn checked his watch—three seconds left—and stepped into the corridor that hadn’t existed a moment before. <words>218</words>  
The torn flyer in his pocket pulsed warm, guiding him through the shifting architecture of the house’s memory. <words>232</words>  
He passed a mirror that showed him as a child, then as a stranger, then as a shadow with no face. <words>247</words>  
The candle’s flame danced wildly, casting silhouettes of people he’d never met but somehow mourned. <words>259</words>  
He reached the heart of the house—a chamber of roots and gears, where the windmill’s axle turned its last. <words>273</words>  
There, he placed the candle on a pedestal of bone and bark, synchronized watch ticking its final beat. <words>287</words>  
The flame surged, not brighter, but deeper, as if burrowing into the void to stitch a path backward. <words>300</words>  
Varn whispered, “Vector complete,” and the torn flyer dissolved into spores that rewrote the air. <words>313</words>  
The mushroom house sighed, remembering itself, and the void blinked—just once—as if surprised. <words>326</words>  
Varn turned, not to leave, but to remain, a flickering presence in a place that now remembered him. <words>340</words>  
Outside, the windmill stopped, and inside, the candle burned on, steady in the endless dark. <words>353</words>  
He smiled, comfortingly pessimistic: “At least the dark is honest.” <words>360</words>  
And in that honesty, he found the shape of something like peace. <words>370</words>
