The wind dragged dust across the cracked soil of the dystopian farm, where scarecrows wore gas masks and the corn whispered secrets to no one. <words>23</words>  
Jasper, a small-time con artist with an unusually normal face, crouched behind a rusted silo, cradling an empty tape dispenser like a relic. <words>45</words>  
He wasn’t hiding from the law—he was waiting for the ghosts. <words>53</words>  
They came every story time, just after the sun dipped behind the irradiated hills and the cows began to hum lullabies. <words>72</words>  
Jasper had learned to summon them not with chants, but with questions, sharp and barbed, designed to pry open their regrets. <words>94</words>  
Tonight, he needed comfort, though he’d never admit it—not even to the dead. <words>104</words>  
He clicked the tape dispenser absentmindedly, its hollow sound echoing like a metronome for his thoughts. <words>118</words>  
The ghosts arrived in flickers, their forms stitched from smoke and memory, hovering above the furrows like forgotten scarecrows. <words>137</words>  
“Tell me,” Jasper said, voice low with mild fervor, “what did you lose before you died?” <words>153</words>  
A woman in a tattered bonnet answered first, her voice like wind through broken windows: “My son, to the harvest machines.” <words>172</words>  
Jasper nodded, not out of sympathy, but calculation—each sorrow was a thread he could pull. <words>186</words>  
Another ghost, a boy with no eyes, whispered, “I lost my name.” <words>197</words>  
Jasper leaned forward, the tape dispenser now a totem in his hand. <words>208</words>  
He interrogated them not for justice, but to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin in their face. <words>225</words>  
Each confession was a balm, a strange comfort that reminded him he was still alive, still unclaimed by the soil. <words>244</words>  
He wasn’t haunted by guilt—he was seduced by the lull of remorse, the way it softened the edges of his schemes. <words>266</words>  
The ghosts circled him, drawn to his questions like moths to a dying bulb. <words>278</words>  
“Why do you ask?” one finally demanded, her voice brittle with suspicion. <words>289</words>  
Jasper smiled, teeth yellowed but sincere. <words>295</words>  
“Because I want to know how close I can get to the edge without falling.” <words>308</words>  
The ghosts murmured, unsure whether to pity or punish him. <words>319</words>  
He stood, brushing dirt from his knees, and held up the empty tape dispenser like a trophy. <words>334</words>  
“This,” he said, “once held the lies I used to seal my fate.” <words>346</words>  
Now it was hollow, like him, like them. <words>353</words>  
But unlike them, he still had breath, still had time to twist the truth into something useful. <words>370</words>  
The ghosts began to fade, their stories spent, their remorse absorbed into Jasper’s grin. <words>383</words>  
He walked back toward the barn, where the cows hummed and the corn listened, the night thick with unspoken bargains. <words>402</words>  
Behind him, the wind carried a whisper: “You’ll be one of us soon.” <words>413</words>  
Jasper didn’t look back. <words>417</words>  
He didn’t need to. <words>421</words>  
He already knew the ending—he just wasn’t ready to stop telling the story. <words>435</words>  
And as long as he could ask, he could pretend he wasn’t answering. <words>447</words>  
The tape dispenser clicked once more, a hollow echo in the silence. <words>459</words>  
Jasper grinned. <words>461</words>
