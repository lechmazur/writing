The dandelion field shimmered under the pale light of dawn, each seed head trembling like a secret waiting to be spoken. <words>20</words>  
A newborn’s first cry echoed from the nearby birthing tent, and in the short pause that followed, the world seemed to hold its breath. <words>41</words>  
From the edge of the field, the feral ranger emerged, her cloak stitched from crow feathers and moss, her eyes wild with unfiltered perception. <words>63</words>  
She moved with a precisely random gait, each step unpredictable yet purposeful, as if guided by a rhythm only she could hear. <words>83</words>  
In her hand, she carried a brass balance scale, tarnished by time but still perfectly calibrated, its pans swaying gently in the morning breeze. <words>106</words>  
She approached the tent, where the midwife handed her a crumpled receipt, its ink faded except for a string of code words hidden in plain sight. <words>130</words>  
The ranger’s fingers quivered as she read the message, her body reacting before her mind could catch up, as if the truth had struck a nerve. <words>153</words>  
The code spoke of a child born under the sign of the Hollow Moon, destined to see the world without filters, without lies. <words>175</words>  
She had waited for this moment, not to protect the child, but to learn from them—to embrace the unknown with open arms. <words>195</words>  
The balance scale began to tilt, one pan lowering as if weighed by invisible choices, the other rising with the lightness of possibility. <words>216</words>  
She remembered her own birth, alone in a cave of roots, her first cry swallowed by silence, her path carved by instinct and solitude. <words>238</words>  
Now, she stood at the edge of something new, her feral past brushing against a future she could not predict but longed to understand. <words>260</words>  
The dandelions around her began to release their seeds, a thousand tiny parachutes drifting upward, as if the earth itself exhaled. <words>280</words>  
She stepped into the tent, the scale held steady, the receipt folded into her palm like a promise. <words>295</words>  
The child blinked up at her, eyes wide and unclouded, and for a moment, the ranger saw herself reflected—not as she was, but as she could be. <words>322</words>  
She knelt beside the newborn, whispering a name not her own, but one carried through generations in the rustle of leaves and the hush of wind. <words>346</words>  
Outside, the field quivered again, not from wind, but from the quiet tremor of change, as if the world had shifted a fraction toward hope. <words>368</words>  
The ranger smiled, her heart aching with a hopeful melancholy, and let the unknown wash over her like rain on dry earth. <words>388</words>  
In that fragile pause between cries, she chose not to guard the future, but to walk beside it, barefoot and unafraid. <words>408</words>  
And somewhere in the code of that moment, a new path began to write itself, one step at a time. <words>423</words>
