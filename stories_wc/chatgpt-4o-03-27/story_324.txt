In the hush of a simmering future, where cities blinked like dying stars and silence hummed louder than machines, the secret agent headquarters lay buried beneath the ruins of a forgotten museum. <words>28</words> 

Its corridors, once alive with purpose, now echoed with the hesitant footsteps of an insecure advisor named Elian, whose loyalty was as fragile as his self-worth. <words>49</words> 

He moved like a shadow, drawn not by orders but by a rumor that had taken root in his mind like a parasite—whispers of a brain in a jar labeled “duplicate.” <words>72</words> 

They said it pulsed with the thoughts of a dreamer who had once glimpsed the end of all things and smiled. <words>85</words> 

Elian had never smiled at endings, only flinched, but something in the story called to him—a dreamer’s calling, they called it, though no one could say what it meant. <words>109</words> 

He followed the echo of his own footsteps through the abandoned place, each step a jab at the silence, each corridor a test of his resolve. <words>130</words> 

The headquarters had been sealed after the Collapse, when agents turned on each other and the world outside forgot what secrets were worth keeping. <words>149</words> 

Now, only Elian remained, chasing a rumor beyond all reason, driven by a need to matter in a world that had stopped asking questions. <words>169</words> 

He found the jar in a vault behind a door that required no key, only belief—a clearly ambiguous mechanism that responded to intent more than action. <words>191</words> 

Inside, the brain floated in a pale blue fluid, twitching faintly, as if dreaming still. <words>202</words> 

The label “duplicate” was etched in fading ink, but Elian knew this was no copy—it was the original, or perhaps the only one that mattered. <words>224</words> 

He pressed his hand to the glass, and the room trembled with a low hum, like a voice trying to remember how to speak. <words>243</words> 

Visions flooded his mind—fractured idylls of futures that never were, cities built on clouds, oceans of glass, and a child with his face staring into the sun. <words>267</words> 

The dreamer’s calling was not a summons but a surrender, an invitation to dissolve into possibility. <words>280</words> 

Elian wept, not from fear, but from recognition—he had always been a duplicate, a shadow of someone braver, someone real. <words>298</words> 

But in this moment, he was the dreamer, and the dream. <words>306</words> 

He opened the jar. <words>309</words> 

The brain pulsed once, then stilled, and the silence that followed was not empty, but full of meaning. <words>327</words> 

Through the echo of footsteps in that abandoned place, Elian vanished, not erased, but rewritten. <words>343</words> 

Outside, the world stirred, as if remembering something it had long tried to forget. <words>356</words> 

And somewhere, in the hush of that simmering future, a new rumor began to spread—of a man who had become more than himself. <words>379</words> 

A man who had answered the dreamer’s calling. <words>387</words>
