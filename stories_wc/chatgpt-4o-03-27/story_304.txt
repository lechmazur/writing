When the bus driver completed the final route, the baroque asteroid exhaled silence, its gilded spires casting long shadows across the cratered marble. <words>23</words>  
In that hush, the lurking assassin emerged from the cathedral’s broken nave, his boots whispering over shattered mosaics of forgotten saints. <words>41</words>  
He carried no blade, only a paint-splattered camera lens, its glass cracked like the surface of a frozen tear. <words>56</words>  
Through it, he saw the world not as it was, but as it might have been—if mercy had ever mattered. <words>72</words>  
The assassin’s name was lost to time, but his purpose remained: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands before it vanished forever. <words>89</words>  
He followed the unforgiving road that spiraled through the asteroid’s hollow heart, a path etched in obsidian and regret. <words>104</words>  
Each step echoed with the laughter of ghosts, a sound that made him pause—not in fear, but in recognition. <words>118</words>  
He remembered laughter once, before the stars turned cold and the sky became a ledger of debts unpaid. <words>132</words>  
Now, laughter was a weapon, wielded by those who mistook cruelty for wisdom and called it superficially profound. <words>147</words>  
He passed a mural of a spider’s web, glistening with rain that had never fallen, painted by a mad monk centuries ago. <words>164</words>  
The pattern shimmered with hidden meaning, a map of choices and consequences, each thread a life, each droplet a death. <words>179</words>  
He traced it with his gloved finger, decoding the path forward not with logic, but with longing. <words>192</words>  
The assassin had once been a poet, before the empire burned his verses and his village in the same fire. <words>206</words>  
Now he wrote only in silence, his verses etched in footsteps and shadows, his stanzas composed of breath and blood. <words>221</words>  
At the road’s end stood a throne of rusted satellites, where the tyrant watched the stars die one by one. <words>235</words>  
The tyrant laughed, a sound like glass breaking underwater, and said, “You’ve come to kill me with a camera?” <words>249</words>  
The assassin raised the lens, and through it, the tyrant saw himself—not as ruler, but as ruin. <words>262</words>  
The image fractured, refracted through paint and pain, until the tyrant’s laughter turned to weeping. <words>274</words>  
The assassin stepped forward, not to strike, but to offer the lens, trembling in his hands like a newborn sun. <words>289</words>  
“See,” he whispered, “what you’ve become, and what you could still be.” <words>297</words>  
The tyrant reached out, fingers brushing the cracked glass, and for a moment, the dawn hesitated. <words>310</words>  
Outside, the asteroid’s baroque towers shimmered with borrowed starlight, as if holding their breath. <words>322</words>  
Then the tyrant laughed again—not cruelly, but softly, like a man remembering a song he once loved. <words>336</words>  
The assassin turned away, his mission complete, the road behind him no less unforgiving, but no longer empty. <words>350</words>  
He vanished into the cathedral’s shadow, leaving only the lens behind, resting in the tyrant’s open palm. <words>364</words>  
Rain began to fall—impossible rain—tracing the spider’s web anew, each droplet a promise, each thread a chance. <words>379</words>  
And somewhere deep within the asteroid, a bus engine sighed, ready to begin again. <words>390</words>
