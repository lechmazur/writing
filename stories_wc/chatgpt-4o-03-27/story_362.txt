The cranky oracle squinted through the dust-flecked light of the secret society chamber, muttering curses as she adjusted the cracked lens of her monocle. <words>21</words>  
She had resettled here after the last temple burned, dragging her belongings—including an abandoned terrarium filled with dead moss and forgotten beetle husks. <words>42</words>  
The chamber, hidden beneath a pawn shop, pulsed with the scent of old copper and betrayal, its walls lined with scrolls chronicling ancient patterns of deception. <words>63</words>  
She didn’t trust the society’s new recruits, especially the boy who had found her through the glimmer of battered dog tags in the pawn shop window. <words>85</words>  
He claimed to be a historian, but his eyes flickered too quickly, and his questions were too precise for someone merely curious. <words>102</words>  
Still, she let him in, because the art of deception was not just her study—it was her legacy, and she needed a successor. <words>123</words>  
The boy marveled at the terrarium, asking why she kept such a useless thing, and she replied, “Because even dead worlds remember how they once thrived.” <words>147</words>  
He didn’t understand, not yet, but she saw the seed of cunning in him, the rare glint of someone who could lie with purpose. <words>168</words>  
Under the fleeting golden sunset that filtered through the chamber’s single stained-glass slit, she began to teach him the patterns hidden in history’s lies. <words>189</words>  
Each scroll they unrolled revealed a civilization that rose not through truth, but through carefully crafted illusions, each fall marked by a failure to deceive. <words>211</words>  
She taught him how to read between the ink, to see the motives behind the myths, and to recognize the virtually rare skill of honest deceit. <words>234</words>  
The boy listened, learned, and lied back to her with increasing elegance, until she could no longer tell when he was pretending to care. <words>255</words>  
That pleased her more than she admitted, for the best deceivers always begin by fooling their mentors. <words>268</words>  
One evening, he asked about the dog tags, and she told him they belonged to the last oracle, who had failed to see betrayal coming. <words>291</words>  
He nodded solemnly, pocketing them without asking, and she knew then that he was ready to inherit the chamber—and the burden of chronicling deception. <words>314</words>  
She resettled the terrarium on the altar, whispering to the dead moss, “Watch him closely,” before vanishing into the shadows behind the scroll racks. <words>336</words>  
The boy stood alone, the golden light fading, the chamber now his to guard, deceive, and remember. <words>349</words>  
Outside, the pawn shop closed for the night, its window empty, the dog tags gone, and the world none the wiser. <words>368</words>  
In the silence, the terrarium pulsed faintly, as if something inside had begun to stir. <words>380</words>
