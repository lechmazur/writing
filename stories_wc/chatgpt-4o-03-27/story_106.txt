The sullen farmer stood ankle-deep in brine, staring at the rusted turbines of the forgotten underwater city power station. <words>20</words>  
He had come here not for electricity, but for clarity, dragging behind him a satchel filled with a collection of used postage stamps. <words>39</words>  
Each stamp bore the face of a place he’d never been, a life he’d never lived, and a promise he’d never kept. <words>55</words>  
The quilt wrapped around his shoulders, stitched from mismatched patches by generations before him, clung to his back like a second skin. <words>72</words>  
Through its faded threads, he felt the weight of inherited dreams and the ache of boundaries drawn by others. <words>86</words>  
He had always been objectively biased—seeing the world not as it was, but as it had failed to be for him. <words>104</words>  
The power station groaned, its submerged bones echoing with the ghosts of forgotten ambition and drowned potential. <words>117</words>  
He moved with sudden zest, tearing open the satchel and scattering the stamps across the algae-slick floor. <words>131</words>  
They floated briefly, then sank, like memories too heavy to hold. <words>139</words>  
In that moment of pure inspiration, he saw the quilt not as a burden, but as a map. <words>152</words>  
Each patch a boundary once drawn, now ready to be erased. <words>161</words>  
He traced the seams with calloused fingers, whispering the names of the women who had sewn them—his mother, her mother, and hers. <words>179</words>  
Their borrowed valor surged through him, not as pride, but as permission. <words>189</words>  
He stepped deeper into the station, past corroded panels and barnacle-covered gauges, until he reached the control room. <words>204</words>  
There, he laid the quilt across the console, aligning its patches with the faded schematic etched into the metal. <words>220</words>  
The machine hummed, recognizing the pattern, the legacy, the intent. <words>229</words>  
Lights flickered, not with power, but with memory, illuminating the path forward. <words>240</words>  
He smiled for the first time in years, not because he had found answers, but because he had chosen to walk away from a dead end. <words>259</words>  
The quilt shimmered, its patches dissolving into light, erasing the boundaries between past and future, land and sea, self and story. <words>276</words>  
He turned, leaving the stamps behind, their purpose fulfilled, their weight lifted. <words>287</words>  
Outside, the ocean pressed against the glass, vast and waiting. <words>296</words>  
He stepped through the final door, not as a farmer, but as a man unbound. <words>308</words>  
The city behind him sighed, not in sorrow, but in release. <words>318</words>  
And somewhere above, the sun pierced the waves, touching the quilt of the world with warmth. <words>331</words>  
He walked toward it, each step a stitch in a new story. <words>341</words>  
No longer sullen, no longer stuck, he moved with the zest of someone who had finally remembered how to begin. <words>358</words>
