The final beep of the hospital monitor echoed like a farewell whistle through the seasoned woodsman’s mind. <words>17</words>  
He stood alone in the radio wave garden, where rusted antennae bloomed like iron flowers from cracked concrete. <words>33</words>  
The air shimmered with static, and the scent of ozone clung to his flannel like a ghost. <words>45</words>  
In his calloused hand, he clutched an antique hairbrush, its ivory handle worn smooth by generations. <words>58</words>  
It had belonged to his mother, who once sang lullabies while brushing her tangled, artfully messy hair. <words>71</words>  
She had died in this very hospital, her final breath syncing with the monitor’s last mechanical sigh. <words>84</words>  
Now, with her gone, he was finally free to pursue the truth he’d buried beneath years of silence. <words>98</words>  
He had lied to protect her, claiming his father vanished in a storm, not on the tracks. <words>111</words>  
But the truth was darker—his father had been mapping abandoned railways when he disappeared without a trace. <words>125</words>  
The woodsman had always suspected foul play, but fear and loyalty had sealed his lips. <words>137</words>  
Now, freed by honesty whispered to his mother’s still form, he could finally follow the echoes. <words>150</words>  
He approached the abandoned water tower, its rusted shell looming like a sentinel over forgotten rails. <words>163</words>  
Inside, he clapped once, sharply, and waited as the echo bounced back in fractured waves. <words>176</words>  
By measuring the echo in the abandoned water tower, he could trace the hidden tunnels beneath. <words>189</words>  
The sound returned unevenly—there was a cavity below, a chamber not marked on any map. <words>202</words>  
He descended through a hatch, flashlight flickering, heart pounding with despairing cheer. <words>213</words>  
The chamber was filled with old equipment, wires snaking like vines, and a humming control panel. <words>226</words>  
He reached for the panel, but a surge of instinct stopped him—he needed to short-circuit it. <words>239</words>  
Using the metal bristles of the antique hairbrush, he bridged two terminals, sparks dancing like fireflies. <words>252</words>  
The panel died with a hiss, and a hidden door groaned open, revealing a tunnel lined with maps. <words>266</words>  
Each map was hand-drawn, annotated in his father’s script, detailing routes long erased from memory. <words>279</words>  
Tears welled in his eyes as he traced the inked lines, each one a breadcrumb of truth. <words>292</words>  
He realized then that his father hadn’t vanished—he’d been silenced, buried beneath bureaucracy and fear. <words>305</words>  
The woodsman emerged from the tunnel at dawn, the radio wave garden humming with new purpose. <words>318</words>  
He would finish the map, expose the truth, and honor both parents with the honesty they deserved. <words>331</words>  
His flannel was torn, his beard tangled, his hair artfully messy like his mother’s had been. <words>344</words>  
But his eyes were clear, and his steps sure, as he walked the forgotten rails into morning. <words>357</words>  
The antique hairbrush rested in his pocket, a relic of love, loss, and the courage to speak. <words>371</words>  
In the distance, a train whistle blew—not real, perhaps, but real enough to guide him forward. <words>384</words>  
He smiled through tears, despair and cheer braided like tracks beneath his boots. <words>395</words>  
And for the first time in years, the woodsman felt the weight of silence lift. <words>407</words>
