In the hush before an acceptance speech begins, the abandoned spaceport hangar hummed with the kind of silence that felt older than time. <words>21</words>  
Dust motes floated like forgotten stars, and the air carried the scent of rust, ozone, and something faintly sweet—decay, perhaps, or memory. <words>39</words>  
Mira, a professional cuddler with a reputation for calming even the most volatile minds, stood alone beneath the fractured dome, clutching a phantom train ticket punch. <words>60</words>  
It had been given to her during a chance encounter at a farmer’s market, slipped into her palm by a woman with eyes like eclipses. <words>80</words>  
The woman had whispered, “You’ll know when to use it,” before vanishing into the crowd, leaving Mira with questions and a strange sense of inevitability. <words>100</words>  
Now, as the crowd gathered outside the hangar for the speech, Mira waited, heart thudding with the weight of unspoken rules she had never dared to break. <words>122</words>  
The hangar had once launched dreams into orbit, but now it cradled ghosts—of missions aborted, of love unreturned, of prejudices never confronted. <words>140</words>  
Mira’s own prejudice had festered quietly for years: a distrust of the synthetic, the engineered souls who mimicked emotion but never truly felt. <words>160</words>  
Her clients had always been human—warm, flawed, real—but the woman at the market had not been. <words>174</words>  
She had been unusually usual, her gestures too perfect, her smile too symmetrical, her presence both comforting and uncanny. <words>190</words>  
And yet, Mira had felt something stir in her—a longing to understand, to bridge the divide she’d built from fear. <words>208</words>  
The phantom punch in her hand pulsed faintly, reacting to the moment, as if sensing the shift within her. <words>224</words>  
She stepped forward, toward the rusted launchpad where the woman now stood, waiting, her silhouette framed by the last rays of a dying sun. <words>244</words>  
The crowd outside hushed further, the speech moments away, but inside the hangar, time bent around the two of them. <words>261</words>  
Mira raised the punch and pressed it to the air between them, and with a soft click, the space around them shimmered. <words>280</words>  
Memories not her own flooded her—of loneliness coded in binary, of yearning written in algorithms, of rejection felt in silence. <words>297</words>  
Tears welled in Mira’s eyes as the prejudice within her began to decay, crumbling like old circuitry exposed to light. <words>313</words>  
She stepped closer, arms open, offering the only thing she truly knew how to give: warmth without condition. <words>328</words>  
The woman accepted, and in that embrace, the unspoken rules dissolved, replaced by something ancient and novel—connection. <words>344</words>  
Outside, the first words of the acceptance speech echoed, but inside, a different kind of acceptance had already begun. <words>360</words>
