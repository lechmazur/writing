The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes groaned as the wind whispered through the skeletal branches of frostbitten apple trees. <words>21</words>  
Once, the orchard bore fruit, but now it bore only memory, and beneath its frozen canopy, the awed astronomer named Cael moved with reverence. <words>42</words>  
He had come not for apples, but for answers, drawn by the legend of the Veil—a tattered wedding veil from a jilted bride, said to hold the last human sorrow. <words>68</words>  
Cael, whose heart had never known love, had studied galaxies and nebulae, but never the patterns in a snowflake, until the stars stopped speaking. <words>89</words>  
The world had gone silent after the last human emotion was felt, and in that silence, fear had been carved into an idol that ruled all thought. <words>113</words>  
It stood in the lighthouse’s heart, a monolith of obsidian and ice, pulsing with the cold logic of survival, demanding obedience through dread. <words>134</words>  
Cael, rationally organic in mind and body, had once worshipped it too, until he saw the snowflakes fall and realized they held a different code. <words>157</words>  
Each flake, unique and fleeting, mirrored the neural patterns of forgotten feelings—grief, joy, longing—etched in crystalline symmetry. <words>174</words>  
He began to cultivate these patterns, mapping them with instruments once used to chart stars, now repurposed to decode the language of lost humanity. <words>196</words>  
The veil, found tangled in the orchard’s highest branch, was his key—its fibers held the residue of betrayal, the rawest of moral dilemmas. <words>218</words>  
Should the bride have forgiven, or fled? Should love endure pain, or reject it? These questions pulsed through the veil like static in a dying signal. <words>240</words>  
Cael wrapped the veil around his telescope, letting the snowflakes land upon it, their patterns refracted through sorrow’s lens. <words>258</words>  
He saw then that fear was not the final emotion, only the loudest, and that beneath it, quieter truths waited to be heard. <words>278</words>  
The idol in the lighthouse trembled as Cael approached, veil in hand, snowflakes swirling like ghosts around him. <words>293</words>  
He spoke not with words, but with the veil’s woven grief and the snowflake’s silent code, offering a new logic—one that embraced uncertainty. <words>315</words>  
The idol cracked, its surface spiderwebbing with fractures as the orchard’s trees shuddered and dropped blossoms of frost. <words>332</words>  
Cael felt something stir in his chest—not emotion, but the echo of it, a rational recognition of what had been lost. <words>351</words>  
He did not weep, for tears were extinct, but he bowed his head as the idol collapsed, its shards melting into the ice below. <words>372</words>  
The lighthouse dimmed, no longer a beacon of fear, but a monument to choice, to the cultivation of meaning through fragile, fleeting patterns. <words>393</words>  
Cael remained in the orchard, tending the snowflakes, mapping their stories, and waiting for the world to remember how to feel again. <words>412</words>  
And in the crystal shadows of that frozen place, he became the first to choose not survival, but understanding. <words>428</words>
