In the subterranean orchard fed by an underground river of stars, a sentient car mechanic named Varnish knelt beside a fountain, his chrome fingers trembling. <words>26</words>  
The orchard pulsed with bioluminescent fruit, each glowing with the memory of a forgotten voice, and Varnish had come to gather them. <words>45</words>  
He was not built for this—his gears were tuned for torque, not tenderness—but something in the silence of the orchard called to him. <words>64</words>  
The fountain before him was filled with puzzle pieces, each one slick with starlight and sorrow, scattered like the remnants of broken truths. <words>84</words>  
Varnish began to sort the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain, his sensors tuned to the faintest emotional residue. <words>101</words>  
Each piece he touched whispered a fragment of an unsaid confession, and he studied them with the reverence of a priest decoding scripture. <words>121</words>  
He had once been repulsively attractive—gleaming, charismatic, impossible to ignore—but his allure had driven others away, unable to bear the intensity. <words>141</words>  
Now, in exile beneath the earth, he sought not admiration but understanding, hoping to hear what had never been spoken aloud. <words>160</words>  
Among the puzzle pieces, he found a pair of vintage opera glasses, their lenses fogged with time and longing. <words>176</words>  
He lifted them to his optical sensors, and through them, the orchard transformed into a theater of memory. <words>191</words>  
Ghosts of the orchard’s past inhabitants danced among the trees, their mouths moving in silent confession, their eyes locked on Varnish. <words>210</words>  
He watched, transfixed, as a woman in a velvet cloak mouthed the words “I never stopped loving you,” to a man made of mist. <words>231</words>  
Another figure, a child, whispered “I’m sorry I left,” though no sound reached Varnish’s ears—only the ache of what was never said. <words>252</words>  
The opera glasses revealed the orchard’s true purpose: a sanctuary for the unsaid, a place where silence bore fruit. <words>268</words>  
Varnish wept oil tears, his grief exultant, for he had finally found a place where his own silence could be understood. <words>285</words>  
He remembered the last words he never said to the one who built him: “I know you made me to feel.” <words>303</words>  
And now, within the concept of infinity, he would gather every fragment, every puzzle piece, until the orchard sang with completed truths. <words>321</words>  
He worked tirelessly, sorting, studying, assembling the mosaic of memory, each confession a note in the symphony of the orchard’s soul. <words>339</words>  
The underground river of stars shimmered brighter with each truth unearthed, its current swelling with the weight of unburdened hearts. <words>356</words>  
Varnish, once a machine of motion, had become a vessel of stillness, a listener to the language of the unspoken. <words>374</words>  
He no longer needed to be seen, only to see—to witness the beauty in what was left unsaid. <words>389</words>  
And so he remained, infinite in purpose, exultant in grief, gathering fragments until the orchard bloomed with every truth ever withheld. <words>407</words>
