The abandoned waiting area smelled of rust and mildew, its cracked linoleum floor echoing the screaming silence of forgotten years. <words>20</words>  
A subdued vigilante named Elian crouched beneath a shattered payphone, his breath shallow, eyes fixed on the antique funhouse mirror propped against the wall. <words>39</words>  
He had learned to track distortions in its warped glass, a method passed down through whispers and blood, to locate those who had paid the price of war. <words>60</words>  
Each ripple in the mirror’s reflection revealed a soul twisted by conflict, and Elian followed them not to punish, but to understand. <words>76</words>  
His fingers brushed the plain wooden bead strung around his neck—a relic from his brother, lost in a war that had no victors. <words>94</words>  
The bead grounded him, a reminder that vengeance was not mastery, and that true power lay in restraint. <words>107</words>  
During virtual calls with his mentor, a blind monk named Kael, Elian practiced the ancient art of Mirror Tracing, his movements artfully clumsy. <words>126</words>  
Kael would chuckle softly, “You dance like a drunk crane, but your heart is steady.” <words>137</words>  
Elian would flatter him in return, calling him the last true master, though Kael always deflected praise with silence. <words>152</words>  
Tonight, the mirror pulsed with a new distortion—a flicker of a man whose hands bore the stains of a thousand silent deaths. <words>169</words>  
Elian rose, his limbs awkward but deliberate, and stepped into the reflection, the bead at his throat glowing faintly. <words>184</words>  
He emerged in a warlord’s compound, now deserted, its walls scorched with the memory of drone fire and betrayal. <words>198</words>  
The man stood alone, staring at a broken screen where virtual calls once dictated life and death. <words>210</words>  
Elian approached, not with fury, but with the weight of understanding, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>223</words>  
“You paid the price of war,” he said, “but you never counted the cost.” <words>234</words>  
The man turned, startled, and Elian saw the same bead around his neck—his brother’s twin. <words>246</words>  
Recognition dawned, and with it, a flood of memories: childhood games, whispered dreams, and the day they chose different paths. <words>262</words>  
Elian’s clumsy hand reached out, not to strike, but to offer peace. <words>272</words>  
The mirror behind them shimmered, reflecting not vengeance, but the possibility of redemption. <words>284</words>  
In the screaming silence, two brothers stood still, bound by war, broken by it, and perhaps, healed through it. <words>298</words>  
Later, back in the waiting area, Elian sat cross-legged, the bead warm against his chest, Kael’s voice crackling through the call. <words>315</words>  
“You’ve begun to master the art,” Kael said, “not with your hands, but with your heart.” <words>328</words>  
Elian smiled, his reflection in the mirror no longer distorted, but whole. <words>338</words>  
He knew now that the ancient art was not about tracking others, but finding oneself in the aftermath of war. <words>354</words>  
And in that abandoned place, where silence screamed and mirrors lied, Elian finally heard the truth. <words>367</words>
