The last swipe of paint dried on the mural, a phoenix rising from rusted gears, as the detached swordsman stepped into the recycling center’s shadow. <words>25</words>  
He moved with the grace of someone who had long ago stopped belonging to the world, yet still chose to meddle in its broken promises. <words>45</words>  
The air buzzed with ozone and the scent of melted polymers, but his focus was on a bin overflowing with discarded collage scraps. <words>63</words>  
He knelt, fingers brushing aside neon flyers and torn stencils until he found what he sought: a shard of sea pottery, smooth and sky-colored. <words>85</words>  
It was the final piece, the heart of the vow he had vowed never to make, yet now sought to consecrate. <words>100</words>  
The vow had been whispered once, long ago, to a girl who wove secrets into her laughter and vanished before he could ask her name. <words>121</words>  
She had been one of the secret weavers, those who stitched meaning into the city’s chaos, hiding truths in murals and alley mosaics. <words>141</words>  
He had watched her from rooftops, lovingly detached, never daring to interfere—until the day her final mural ended in a smear of red. <words>162</words>  
Now, he meddled not with swords but with scraps, reassembling her last message from the refuse of a city that forgot too quickly. <words>181</words>  
Each piece he placed was a syllable, a breath, a memory of her voice echoing through the steel canyons of the metropolis. <words>199</words>  
The sea pottery shard fit perfectly into the center, anchoring the collage like a pupil in an eye that saw too much. <words>218</words>  
As he stepped back, the mural shimmered—not with light, but with recognition, as if the city itself remembered her through his hands. <words>236</words>  
A soft hum rose from the walls, the recycling center’s machinery pausing as if to listen, as if to mourn. <words>251</words>  
He bowed, not out of reverence, but because the vow demanded it: to never forget, to never forgive, to always rebuild. <words>268</words>  
The secret weavers had taught him that truth was not spoken but assembled, piece by piece, from what others discarded. <words>284</words>  
He turned away, his coat catching the wind like a sail, the mural behind him now pulsing with quiet defiance. <words>299</words>  
Somewhere in the city, another bin overflowed, another secret waited to be reassembled, another vow begged to be made. <words>314</words>  
He would find them all, not because he cared, but because caring had become the only sword he had left. <words>331</words>  
The city didn’t need heroes—it needed meddlers, lovingly detached, who knew how to listen to silence and speak through scraps. <words>349</words>  
And so the swordsman walked on, a ghost with calloused hands, consecrating the impossible one collage at a time. <words>365</words>  
Behind him, the mural blinked once, then settled into stillness, its secrets safe in the rhythm of recycled breath. <words>380</words>  
He smiled, barely, as the wind carried the scent of salt and paint, and the city exhaled. <words>394</words>
