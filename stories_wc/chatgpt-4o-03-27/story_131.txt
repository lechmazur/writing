Dust spiraled in lazy eddies as Milo, the aloof orphan with a gaze like distant stars, swept the garage floor with a cracked broom. <words>21</words>  
He had no memory of his parents, only the softly audible hum of the wind that always seemed to follow him. <words>38</words>  
The garage, cluttered with relics of a life he never lived, sat at the edge of a gravitational anomaly that bent time and light. <words>59</words>  
Milo had grown up here, in the house of his late uncle, who vanished one night after muttering about “the stones and the message.” <words>80</words>  
He found the collection of smooth stones in a rusted tin beneath a pile of old tires, each one warm to the touch. <words>99</words>  
They pulsed faintly, like tiny hearts, and Milo felt something loosen in his chest—an old fear, perhaps, beginning to dissolve. <words>117</words>  
He remembered the cryptic message scrawled on the back of a lottery ticket he’d found in the attic: “Loosen the fear, or perish.” <words>138</words>  
At the time, he’d laughed, but now, with the stones in hand and the anomaly humming louder, it felt like prophecy. <words>157</words>  
The gravitational anomaly had grown stronger over the years, warping the garage’s walls and pulling at Milo’s thoughts like a tide. <words>176</words>  
He’d always avoided it, afraid of what it might do, but now he understood—he had to adapt or perish. <words>193</words>  
He placed the stones in a circle on the garage floor, each one aligning with a faint groove he hadn’t noticed before. <words>212</words>  
The softly audible hum intensified, and the air thickened, pressing against his skin like a velvet glove. <words>226</words>  
Milo stepped into the circle, heart pounding, and whispered the words from the ticket: “Loosen the fear.” <words>240</words>  
The stones glowed, and the anomaly surged, pulling him upward, inward, through a tunnel of bending light and memory. <words>256</words>  
He saw flashes—his mother’s smile, his father’s laugh, the moment they left him, not out of cruelty, but necessity. <words>273</words>  
They had faced the anomaly too, and failed to adapt; now it was his turn to transform fear into courage. <words>290</words>  
When he landed, the garage was still, the anomaly gone, the stones now dull and cold. <words>303</words>  
But Milo felt different—lighter, braver, as if the detachment he’d worn like armor had melted into something warmer. <words>319</words>  
He picked up the broom again, sweeping with a quiet purpose, the softly audible hum now inside him. <words>335</words>  
Outside, the sky shimmered with possibility, and Milo, no longer just an orphan, stepped forward into a world he was ready to meet. <words>355</words>  
The garage was clean, the past loosened, and the future—whatever gravity it held—was his to shape. <words>370</words>
