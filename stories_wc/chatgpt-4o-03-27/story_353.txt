In the emergency time machine garage tucked behind the crumbling chapel of Duskvale, a small-town baker named Elric adjusted the dials with flour-dusted fingers. <words>25</words>  
He had never built a time machine before, but desperation had a way of making even the gentlest cynic exceed their limits. <words>42</words>  
Elric’s bakery had once been the heart of the village, until the tyrant known only as the Hollow Regent outlawed warmth, laughter, and yeast. <words>61</words>  
Now, bread was contraband, and Elric’s oven sat cold, its silence echoing louder than any rebellion. <words>73</words>  
But Elric had a plan, seeded not in vengeance, but in the quiet defiance of pressed flowers. <words>86</words>  
Each bloom, flattened and preserved in waxed parchment, held the memory of someone lost to the Regent’s contagion of control. <words>100</words>  
He had collected them for years, each petal a whisper of resistance, each stem a vow. <words>112</words>  
The contagion had not been a disease of the body, but of the will—spreading through decrees, curfews, and the slow erosion of hope. <words>130</words>  
Elric, cynically gentle, had watched neighbors betray neighbors, their shadows growing longer and more articulate with each passing moon. <words>145</words>  
He began tracking moon patterns, noticing that during certain phases, the shadows murmured secrets in forgotten dialects. <words>158</words>  
It was during the waning crescent that they first told him how to build the machine. <words>169</words>  
The shadows, once voiceless, had learned to speak when the Regent’s power peaked—an unintended side effect of his tyranny. <words>183</words>  
Elric listened, scribbled, and baked coded messages into loaves he dared not sell. <words>194</words>  
He fed the resistance with crumbs of knowledge, each bite a step closer to revolution. <words>206</words>  
Now, standing in the garage lit by flickering lanterns and moonlight, he placed the final pressed flower into the machine’s core. <words>221</words>  
It was his sister’s favorite—lavender, the last bloom she’d touched before vanishing into the Regent’s dungeons. <words>234</words>  
The machine hummed, gears turning like the hands of a clock remembering how to move. <words>245</words>  
Elric set the coordinates: the night the Regent first whispered his lies into the ears of the council. <words>258</words>  
He would arrive before the contagion took root, before shadows learned to betray. <words>269</words>  
The machine shuddered, and Elric felt the weight of every loaf, every flower, every whispered secret. <words>282</words>  
He had no sword, only memory and moonlight, but he would exceed the tyrant’s reach. <words>294</words>  
As the garage dissolved into stars, Elric whispered, “Let the seeds of truth bloom where fear once grew.” <words>308</words>  
Time folded, shadows recoiled, and the baker vanished into the past, carrying the scent of lavender and rebellion. <words>321</words>  
In Duskvale’s future, ovens would burn again, and bread would rise like hope from the ashes. <words>333</words>  
And in the silence that followed, the shadows wept—not from sorrow, but from remembering how to be human. <words>347</words>  
Elric had not just traveled through time; he had planted something deeper. <words>357</words>  
A contagion of courage, seeded in flour, flowers, and the phases of the moon. <words>368</words>  
And when the people awoke, they found their voices blooming like pressed petals in the sun. <words>380</words>
