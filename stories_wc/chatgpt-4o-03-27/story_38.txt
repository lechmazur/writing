The attic above the old brownstone on 12th Street was haunted, but not by ghosts—by memories that refused to die. <words>17</words>  
Ezra, a meticulously messy insomniac poet, had made it his sanctuary, cluttered with notebooks, broken clocks, and botanical samples. <words>36</words>  
He collected the samples from abandoned gardens and subway tracks, pressing them between pages of half-finished verses. <words>49</words>  
Each leaf and petal whispered warnings in a language only he seemed to understand. <words>59</words>  
The whispers came strongest between subway stops, when the train lights flickered and time seemed to pause. <words>72</words>  
Ezra rode the trains at night, scribbling lines while the city slept and the ghosts stirred. <words>85</words>  
He wasn’t afraid of the whispers—they were his only companions, his only truth. <words>96</words>  
They told him of violence wrapped in velvet, of secrets spilled via drunken confessions at after-parties. <words>109</words>  
He’d listen, nodding silently, as strangers leaned in too close, breath thick with gin and regret. <words>121</words>  
They spoke of betrayals, of plans to eliminate rivals, of love turned to ash. <words>132</words>  
Ezra never judged; he only wrote, capturing their sins in stanzas and metaphors. <words>143</words>  
But lately, the whispers had changed—they no longer warned, they pleaded. <words>152</words>  
They begged him to act, to intervene, to stop the cycle before it spiraled. <words>164</words>  
He didn’t believe in violence; he sought the power of non-violence, of words as weapons. <words>177</words>  
So he began leaving poems behind—on subway seats, in coat pockets, under after-party ashtrays. <words>190</words>  
Each poem was a mirror, reflecting the confessor’s darkest truth back at them. <words>201</words>  
Some laughed, thinking it coincidence; others wept, recognizing themselves in the ink. <words>212</words>  
One night, between the 14th and 23rd Street stops, a man named Victor found a poem. <words>225</words>  
It described, in chilling detail, his plan to eliminate his business partner during a staged robbery. <words>238</words>  
Victor staggered off the train, pale and shaking, and never followed through. <words>248</words>  
Ezra watched from the next car, heart pounding, unsure if he’d done right or wrong. <words>260</words>  
Back in the attic, the whispers softened, no longer urgent but grateful. <words>270</words>  
He pressed a new botanical sample—a wilted violet—into a fresh page. <words>280</words>  
The violet had grown near the tracks, where Victor had dropped his weapon. <words>291</words>  
Ezra wrote a poem about redemption blooming in unexpected places. <words>300</words>  
He didn’t sleep that night, or the next, but he felt full. <words>311</words>  
Not of peace, but of purpose, an empty abundance that filled the void. <words>323</words>  
The attic creaked above him, the ghosts humming lullabies in forgotten tongues. <words>334</words>  
He whispered back, promising to keep listening, to keep writing, to keep believing. <words>346</words>  
The city pulsed below, unaware of the poet who fought violence with verse. <words>357</words>  
And somewhere between subway stops, another confession waited to be transformed. <words>367</words>  
Ezra would be there, pen ready, heart open, chaos meticulously messy. <words>377</words>  
Because sometimes, the only way to eliminate darkness is to name it in light. <words>389</words>  
And sometimes, the most haunted places are the ones that teach us how to heal. <words>401</words>
