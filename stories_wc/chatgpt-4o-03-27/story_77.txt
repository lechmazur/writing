The asteroid spun lazily in the velvet dark, its surface pocked with docking scars and forgotten dreams. <words>17</words>  
Inside the hollowed-out cavern of the space pirate hideout, dim lanterns flickered like tired stars. <words>30</words>  
Mira sat cross-legged on a rusted crate, her fingers brushing the brittle limbs of a dried starfish. <words>44</words>  
She was an introverted empath, her mind a quiet harbor for the storm-tossed emotions of others. <words>56</words>  
The starfish had once belonged to her brother, lost in the raid that shattered the marionette. <words>68</words>  
That marionette, now in pieces across the floor, had been their secret code, their shared language. <words>80</words>  
Each fragment held a memory, and Mira was reassembling them not just to remember—but to marshal. <words>93</words>  
To marshal the scattered truths, the buried griefs, the obviously hidden wisdom of the mountain. <words>104</words>  
Not a literal mountain, but the metaphorical one her brother always spoke of—where reason stood tall. <words>117</words>  
He had believed in championing the outcasts of reason, those whose logic was dismissed as madness. <words>130</words>  
Mira had never understood until the journal surfaced, its final page tucked beneath the marionette’s chest. <words>143</words>  
The ink was faded, the words slanted with urgency: “They’ll never see the truth unless we show them.” <words>157</words>  
Now, as she fit the marionette’s wooden arm back into its socket, she felt his presence stir. <words>170</words>  
Not a ghost, but a resonance—his thoughts echoing through her empathic senses like a half-remembered lullaby. <words>183</words>  
The pirates around her laughed and drank, unaware of the revolution being born in their midst. <words>195</words>  
They were outcasts too, though they didn’t know it—drifters exiled from the empire of logic. <words>207</words>  
Mira’s plan was simple: awaken them, not with speeches, but with the marionette’s dance of memory. <words>220</words>  
Each movement would tell a story, each gesture a truth too raw for words. <words>230</words>  
She would perform it during the next gathering, when the asteroid’s orbit brought it closest to the sun. <words>244</words>  
That warmth would seep into their bones, and maybe, just maybe, into their minds. <words>254</words>  
The marionette’s head clicked into place, and Mira whispered, “You’ll speak again, brother.” <words>265</words>  
She tucked the dried starfish into its chest cavity, a heart of brittle hope. <words>276</words>  
The journal’s last page fluttered in the recycled air, as if nodding approval. <words>287</words>  
Outside, the stars blinked in drowsy enthusiasm, as if they too were waiting. <words>298</words>  
Waiting for the moment when forgotten wisdom would rise from the shadows of an asteroid. <words>310</words>  
Mira stood, marionette in hand, and stepped into the flickering light of the pirate hall. <words>322</words>  
She felt their emotions swirl—boredom, suspicion, longing—and she drank them in like fuel. <words>334</words>  
The marionette bowed, and Mira pulled the strings with trembling grace. <words>343</words>  
Wooden limbs moved, telling of mountains climbed by minds once mocked. <words>353</words>  
The pirates fell silent, their eyes wide, their hearts cracked open by the dance. <words>365</words>  
In that hush, Mira felt her brother’s smile, not on her lips, but in her soul. <words>378</words>  
She had marshaled the fragments, reassembled the forgotten, and championed the outcasts of reason. <words>390</words>  
And in doing so, she had become the mountain herself—obviously hidden, but unshakably present. <words>402</words>
