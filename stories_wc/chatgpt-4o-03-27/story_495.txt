Within the folds of spacetime, nestled between forgotten centuries and unborn futures, there stood a mechanical bird sanctuary where time chirped in reverse and feathers ticked like clocks. <words>27</words> 

Here, a begrudging guardian named Elric maintained the gears and wings of the avian automatons, though his heart longed for something he could no longer name. <words>49</words> 

Each morning, he wielded a rustic bread paddle—not for baking, but to gently prod the larger clockwork cranes into motion, their brass beaks clanking in protest. <words>72</words> 

Elric had once been a baker in a village that no longer existed, swallowed by the ever-tightening grip of society’s expectations and the slow erosion of wonder. <words>96</words> 

Now, he lived among birds that never flew, in a sanctuary that never aged, haunted by dangerously friendly visitors who smiled too wide and asked too little. <words>121</words> 

They came bearing dreamlike postcards from an unknown island, each one depicting impossible skies and laughing oceans, addressed only to “The One Who Forgot.” <words>143</words> 

Elric collected them in a rusted tin box, analyzing each image with trembling fingers, trying to illustrate the contours of a joy he once knew. <words>165</words> 

One card showed a child dancing with a bird made of starlight; another, a loaf of bread steaming on a stone hearth beside a smiling stranger. <words>188</words> 

He began to sketch these scenes on the sanctuary walls, using soot and oil, the images growing more vivid with each passing day. <words>208</words> 

The mechanical birds watched silently, their gears slowing as if listening to the memories etched in charcoal and longing. <words>223</words> 

One evening, a new postcard arrived, its paper warm and pulsing like skin, showing Elric himself—laughing, barefoot, holding the bread paddle like a scepter. <words>247</words> 

The caption read: “Break free, and you will remember.” <words>253</words> 

That night, Elric stood before the largest bird, a phoenix of copper and steam, and whispered, “Take me there.” <words>270</words> 

The bird’s eyes glowed, and with a shuddering cry, it opened a portal woven from ticking feathers and forgotten lullabies. <words>289</words> 

Elric stepped through, the bread paddle in hand, as the sanctuary dissolved behind him into a mist of gears and soot. <words>308</words> 

He landed on the island from the postcards, where the air smelled of cinnamon and salt, and laughter echoed like wind chimes. <words>328</words> 

Children ran to him, dangerously friendly in their joy, and he wept as one handed him a loaf of bread shaped like a bird. <words>351</words> 

He baked again, danced again, and remembered the name of the stranger in the postcard—it was his own, before the world had caged him. <words>374</words> 

And though sorrow lingered like a shadow, joy bloomed anew, wild and ungoverned, in the heart of the man who had finally flown. <words>394</words>
