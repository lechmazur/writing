The tide had just begun to recede from the narrow causeway when Edrin, the frail guard of the western watchtower, slipped from his post with a sour-smelling alchemy phial tucked beneath his cloak. <words>33</words>  

He moved with the hesitance of someone resolutely wavering, each step toward the forest edge a silent argument between duty and the desperate need to escape a predetermined fate. <words>64</words>  

The island, known as Viremoor, was only reachable during low tide, and even then, the sea whispered warnings through the salt-stained wind. <words>84</words>  

Edrin had served the House of the Painted Stag for twenty years, their sigil tattooed on his neck in ochre and ash, a mark of painted allegiances he no longer believed in. <words>115</words>  

He had once believed in their cause, but the years had peeled away the layers of honor, revealing only rot beneath the gilded promises. <words>139</words>  

Now, he followed a trail of messages carved in tree bark, each one a cryptic instruction from a hidden ally who claimed to know a way off the island. <words>169</words>  

The first message read: “When the tide forgets the moon, the path will open.” <words>182</words>  

He didn’t understand it fully, but he trusted the rhythm of the forest more than the lies of the keep. <words>202</words>  

The second message, deeper in the woods, said: “Yank the root beneath the twin stones.” <words>217</words>  

He found the stones—moss-covered and shaped like sleeping wolves—and pulled hard on the gnarled root between them. <words>237</words>  

The earth groaned, and a hidden hatch creaked open, revealing a narrow tunnel that smelled of damp soil and old secrets. <words>259</words>  

Edrin hesitated, the phial in his hand trembling slightly, its contents sloshing with a stench that reminded him of burnt copper and spoiled fruit. <words>284</words>  

It was a concoction brewed by the alchemist-prisoner he had once guarded, meant to mask his scent from the hounds that patrolled the island’s perimeter. <words>312</words>  

He drank it in one gulp, gagging as it burned down his throat, and descended into the tunnel. <words>331</words>  

The final message was carved into the tunnel wall: “You are not your mark.” <words>345</words>  

He touched the tattoo on his neck, the painted allegiance that had defined him, and felt something inside him loosen. <words>366</words>  

The tunnel led to a cave that opened onto the sea, where a small boat bobbed in the moonlight, tethered to a rock by a fraying rope. <words>392</words>  

Edrin climbed in, his limbs aching, and cut the rope with a shard of flint he’d carried since his first watch. <words>414</words>  

As the tide began to rise again, he drifted away from Viremoor, the island shrinking behind him like a fading scar. <words>436</words>  

He didn’t know what waited beyond the horizon, but for the first time in years, he felt the weight of choice in his hands. <words>464</words>  

And though the sea was vast and the night uncertain, Edrin rowed forward, guided by the hope that he could become more than what he had been. <words>494</words>
