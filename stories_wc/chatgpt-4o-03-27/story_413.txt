Before the first creature developed sentience, when the world was still a whisper of what it might become, a listless noble named Elion wandered the endless corn maze that stretched across a haunted plain. <words>33</words>  

He wore a faded scarf, once crimson, now the color of old secrets, wrapped loosely around his neck like a memory he couldn’t quite forget. <words>55</words>  

Elion had no kingdom to rule, no court to impress, and no ambition beyond the vague desire to understand the power of intention. <words>76</words>  

He moved with the naively sophisticated air of someone who had read about purpose but never quite practiced it. <words>91</words>  

The corn maze, rumored to shift its paths with the moods of the dead, offered no clear direction, only rustling whispers and the occasional echo of forgotten laughter. <words>117</words>  

One dusk, as the sky blushed with the embarrassment of another day ending without meaning, Elion received an unexpected invitation. <words>135</words>  

It was a parchment folded into the shape of a crow, fluttering down from nowhere, landing at his feet with eerie precision. <words>154</words>  

The message inside read: “Rendezvous at the heart of the maze—bring your intention.” <words>167</words>  

Elion, who had never been invited to anything spontaneous in his life, blinked twice and smiled for the first time in centuries. <words>188</words>  

He tucked the note into his scarf and began walking, guided not by logic but by the absurd hope that someone, or something, awaited him. <words>211</words>  

As he wandered deeper, the corn grew taller, the air thicker, and the whispers louder, as if the maze itself was amused by his earnest confusion. <words>236</words>  

He passed scarecrows that bowed mockingly and shadows that mimicked his gait with theatrical flair. <words>251</words>  

At last, he stumbled into a clearing where a bonfire crackled, surrounded by figures cloaked in moonlight and mischief. <words>270</words>  

They wore masks of beasts that had not yet evolved, and their eyes sparkled with the kind of joy that only comes from shared laughter. <words>293</words>  

One figure stepped forward, offering Elion a goblet filled with starlight and a question: “What do you intend?” <words>311</words>  

Elion hesitated, then removed his scarf and held it out like a flag of surrender. <words>325</words>  

“I intend to remember what it feels like to matter,” he said, his voice trembling with the weight of forgotten dreams. <words>344</words>  

The masked figures erupted in laughter—not cruel, but warm, like the sun finally understanding its own light. <words>361</words>  

They danced around him, their joy infectious, their movements chaotic yet purposeful, as if intention itself were a rhythm. <words>380</words>  

Elion laughed too, at the absurdity, the beauty, the irony of finding meaning in a place designed to confuse. <words>397</words>  

And in that moment, before sentience ever bloomed in the world, a listless noble became something more: a man who chose to matter. <words>418</words>  

The scarf, now glowing faintly, drifted into the fire, releasing a sigh that echoed across the haunted plain. <words>437</words>  

The maze shifted once more, not to trap, but to guide, honoring the first true intention it had ever known. <words>456</words>  

And somewhere in the rustling corn, laughter lingered—shared, eternal, and impossibly alive. <words>470</words>
