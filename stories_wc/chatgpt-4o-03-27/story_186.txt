In a palace suspended from the cavern ceiling by chains thicker than tree trunks, the whimsical tinkerer known as Elric Varn adjusted the brass thermometer embedded in his chest. <words>28</words> 

He had sculpted it himself, a delicate instrument that measured not temperature, but the slow decay of the world’s breath. <words>45</words> 

Each tick of its needle whispered truths only he could hear—oddly truthful murmurs of melting glaciers, poisoned winds, and forests turned to ash. <words>66</words> 

Elric’s home, anchored to stalactites that pierced the skyless dark, swayed gently as he stepped toward his latest invention: a pop-up carnival fortune-teller booth. <words>89</words> 

It unfolded with a hiss and a sigh, gears clicking like cicadas, revealing a mannequin draped in velvet and crowned with a cracked crystal orb. <words>111</words> 

He had built it not for entertainment, but as a conduit—each fortune it delivered was a sculpted truth, drawn from the dying breath of the Earth. <words>135</words> 

Today, he fed it a question carved into birch bark: “How long until the last tree falls?” <words>149</words> 

The mannequin’s eyes flickered, and its voice rasped, “Across the moment an artist’s brush first meets canvas, the end begins.” <words>167</words> 

Elric nodded solemnly, understanding the metaphor—creation and destruction were twins, born in the same breath. <words>181</words> 

He turned to his wall of canvases, each one painted with scenes of environmental change: coral reefs bleached to bone, deserts swallowing cities, skies choked with soot. <words>207</words> 

He painted not to preserve beauty, but to chronicle loss, to sculpt memory from pigment before memory itself decayed. <words>225</words> 

The thermometer in his chest ticked faster now, its brass casing warm with urgency. <words>237</words> 

He knew what it meant—his time was thinning, like the ozone he once tried to mend with mirrors and prayers. <words>255</words> 

Still, he worked, his oddly truthful hands never lying, never flattering, only recording. <words>268</words> 

Visitors came rarely, but when they did, they left changed—haunted by fortunes too precise to ignore. <words>284</words> 

One child asked, “Will the world end?” and the fortune-teller replied, “Only if you forget to remember.” <words>300</words> 

Elric wept then, not from fear, but from the weight of knowing. <words>311</words> 

He sculpted one final piece—a globe of glass filled with ash and light, suspended in a cage of brass vines. <words>330</words> 

He placed it beside the fortune-teller, a silent warning and a prayer. <words>342</words> 

As the palace creaked and the stalactites groaned, Elric lay beneath his canvases, the thermometer’s needle slowing. <words>360</words> 

He smiled, knowing his truths would outlive him, whispered through gears and paint, through carnival booths and oddly truthful machines. <words>380</words> 

And somewhere, a child picked up a brush, the world holding its breath. <words>392</words>
