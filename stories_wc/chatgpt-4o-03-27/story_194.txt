Each morning, the spirited lumberjack pedaled his rusted bicycle through the misty hills, his flannel shirt flapping like a flag of stubborn resilience. <words>21</words>  
He rode not to fell trees, but to reach the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant nestled in the bones of a forgotten monastery. <words>39</words>  
The restaurant, called Marrow & Thyme, served bone broth infused with herbs once used by monks to heal both body and soul. <words>56</words>  
He had taken a job there not for the pay, but to learn healing traditions whispered through recipes and rituals. <words>72</words>  
His hands, once calloused from axes, now trembled gracefully awkward as he arranged marrow-stuffed dumplings on porcelain plates. <words>88</words>  
The chef, a former war medic with eyes like cracked glass, saw through his clumsy elegance and offered silent approval. <words>104</words>  
But the lumberjack’s true purpose lay deeper, hidden beneath the restaurant’s fragrant steam and candlelit charm. <words>117</words>  
He had received a coded letter from a future war, slipped into his coat pocket during a stormy ride. <words>132</words>  
The letter spoke of hidden agendas buried in the ossuary’s catacombs—secrets that could either heal or destroy. <words>146</words>  
Each night, as he biked home under a bruised sky, nightmares reawakened—visions of fire, bone, and betrayal. <words>160</words>  
He saw himself wielding not an axe, but a scalpel, carving truth from flesh in a war not yet begun. <words>175</words>  
These dreams, though terrifying, guided him like a compass forged in sorrow and steel. <words>186</words>  
He began to revamp the restaurant’s cellar, claiming it was for wine storage, but really to access the ossuary’s sealed chambers. <words>203</words>  
There, he found relics—skulls etched with runes, herbs fossilized in amber, and a second letter confirming his role. <words>218</words>  
He was to become a healer in the coming war, one who understood both pain and tenderness. <words>231</words>  
The chef confronted him one night, cleaver in hand, eyes wet with memory. <words>241</words>  
“I know what you’re doing,” he said, voice like gravel soaked in wine. <words>252</words>  
“I fought in that war’s first echo. You’ll need more than broth and dreams.” <words>264</words>  
Together, they began to prepare—not just meals, but medicines, rituals, and maps of the soul. <words>277</words>  
The lumberjack’s awkward grace became a strength, his sincerity cutting through deception like a well-honed blade. <words>291</words>  
He no longer feared the nightmares; they were memories from a future self, urging him forward. <words>304</words>  
Through bike rides and bone dust, he stitched together a new identity—part chef, part healer, part soldier of tenderness. <words>320</words>  
The restaurant thrived, its dishes healing more than hunger, its walls humming with ancient purpose. <words>333</words>  
And when the war finally came, it began not with gunfire, but with a spoonful of broth passed hand to trembling hand. <words>351</words>  
In that moment, the lumberjack understood: healing was not the absence of pain, but the courage to face it with open hands. <words>368</words>  
He had revamp’d his life not to escape the war, but to meet it with harsh tenderness and a heart full of marrow. <words>384</words>
