The quiet room design studio shimmered with a strange stillness, as if the air itself remembered a time before memory. <words>20</words>  
Its walls, curved like the inside of a seashell, pulsed faintly with light from no discernible source. <words>33</words>  
At the center stood a welcoming landlord named Thale, whose smile was as permanent as the dustless floor. <words>47</words>  
He greeted each visitor with a nod that felt like a homecoming, though no one could recall ever leaving. <words>61</words>  
Pinned to his lapel was a framed Napoleonic bee pin, its golden wings spread in eternal vigilance. <words>74</words>  
The pin, he claimed, had once belonged to a general who dreamed of peace but died in conquest. <words>87</words>  
Thale’s studio was not for designing rooms, but for redesigning the endings of stories too painful to finish. <words>101</words>  
Clients arrived by accident, often through detours caused by parades they didn’t remember joining. <words>113</words>  
One such client, a woman with eyes like cracked mirrors, stumbled in clutching a journal of blank pages. <words>127</words>  
“I want to adapt,” she said, her voice trembling with manic clarity, “but I don’t know what from.” <words>141</words>  
Thale offered her tea brewed from leaves that whispered forgotten lullabies, and gestured to the design table. <words>154</words>  
There, blueprints of unlived lives and sketches of alternate farewells lay scattered like fallen feathers. <words>167</words>  
He spoke in cryptically obvious phrases: “To mend a weathered heart, you must first unwear the storm.” <words>180</words>  
She traced the lines of a drawing where she left instead of stayed, where silence was not surrender. <words>194</words>  
The studio hummed, responding to her choice, reshaping the air with the scent of rain on warm stone. <words>208</words>  
Thale nodded, the bee pin catching light that hadn’t yet been born, and said, “You’ve remembered forward.” <words>221</words>  
Outside, the parade passed again, this time in reverse, musicians marching backward into the unknown. <words>233</words>  
The woman stepped out, her journal now filled with words she hadn’t written but always meant. <words>246</words>  
Thale turned back to the studio, where another detour would soon arrive, another heart weathered but willing. <words>259</words>  
He adjusted the pin, its frame warm with the weight of a thousand reimagined endings. <words>271</words>  
In this place before time, where no being had yet recorded its pain, healing was the only history. <words>285</words>  
And Thale, the landlord of lost conclusions, waited with a smile that knew every story’s secret shape. <words>298</words>  
The studio sighed, content, as if it too had adapted to the ache of becoming whole. <words>310</words>  
Each visitor left lighter, their fears rewritten in ink that shimmered with possibility. <words>321</words>  
And though no one remembered the way in, they all remembered the way out. <words>332</words>  
The bee pin gleamed once more, a cryptically obvious symbol of transformation, framed in golden defiance. <words>345</words>  
Thale whispered to the empty room, “Let the endings fear us now.” <words>354</words>  
And somewhere, before the first memory, a heart unweathered began to beat. <words>364</words>
