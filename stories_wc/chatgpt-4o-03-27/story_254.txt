He sat on the rusted swing of the deserted playground at the edge of a wilderness, the chains creaking like old bones in the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry. <words>27</words>  
Once, he had made millions laugh, but now the humorless comedic actor stared blankly at the horizon, where the sun bled into the trees. <words>47</words>  
In his lap rested a dried-out inkwell, a gift from a fan who’d claimed it once belonged to a poet who’d died mid-sonnet. <words>68</words>  
He had received hundreds of such unwanted gifts—props, scripts, even a taxidermied squirrel dressed as Chaplin—but this inkwell haunted him. <words>89</words>  
It was objectively personal, as if the fan had known he’d lost the ability to write, to feel, to laugh. <words>104</words>  
Each day, he returned to this playground, where laughter had long since fled, and surrendered to persistent daydream loops. <words>119</words>  
In them, he stood on stage again, but the audience was silent, their faces blurred, their eyes like empty sockets. <words>136</words>  
He’d concede to the silence, bowing to ghosts, his voice echoing through the hush like a forgotten punchline. <words>151</words>  
The inkwell, though dry, seemed to pulse with memory, as if it remembered ink, remembered words, remembered breath. <words>166</words>  
He imagined bottling a star’s dying breath, sealing it in the inkwell, and writing one final joke that could make the universe laugh. <words>187</words>  
But the joke never came, only the loop, again and again, through the playground, through the wilderness, through the unraveling tapestry. <words>204</words>  
He remembered the first time he’d made someone laugh—his mother, coughing blood, still managing a chuckle at his crooked impression of death. <words>223</words>  
That laugh had been a gift, not unwanted, not wrapped in delusion or nostalgia, but real, raw, and fleeting. <words>238</words>  
Now, all he had were echoes and the inkwell, which he began to carry like a relic, a totem of what he’d lost. <words>257</words>  
One night, the stars above the playground flickered like dying embers, and he whispered a joke into the inkwell’s mouth. <words>274</words>  
It was a terrible joke, flat and broken, but he imagined the inkwell catching it, holding it like breath. <words>289</words>  
He laughed then—not because it was funny, but because it was his, and the stars seemed to pause in their dying. <words>306</words>  
The wilderness leaned in, the trees holding their breath, the swing stilling beneath him as if the world had conceded to his moment. <words>325</words>  
He stood, the inkwell in hand, and walked into the trees, where the playground ended and the hush began. <words>342</words>  
Through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry, he vanished, a man who had once made the world laugh, now chasing a star’s last breath. <words>363</words>  
And somewhere, in the loop of dreams and silence, the inkwell filled—not with ink, but with the echo of a laugh that mattered. <words>383</words>
