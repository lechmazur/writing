When the last star fades into morning light, Elira Vance sits cross-legged in the brig of the space pirate ship *Grave Merriment*, her fingers tracing the chipped edge of a pair of ancient dice. <words>30</words>  
She is a psychic genealogist, proudly humble despite her uncanny ability to read bloodlines through objects, and the dice whisper secrets only she can hear. <words>55</words>  
The brig hums with the low thrum of the ship’s failing core, and Elira knows time is short if she’s to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak echoing through her veins. <words>84</words>  
Her lover, Captain Ralix, betrayed her not with another, but with silence—refusing to share the truth of his lineage, a truth that might unravel the puzzle of destiny itself. <words>115</words>  
She rolls the dice again, watching the chipped one land askew, as if resisting fate, and she smiles with grave playfulness, knowing resistance is the first clue. <words>141</words>  
The diaries she found on the abandoned bullet trains orbiting the dead moon of Virellia had spoken of a bloodline cursed to repeat betrayal until the pattern was broken. <words>172</words>  
Each diary, written in a different hand but the same voice, lengthened the thread of a single soul reincarnated across centuries, always ending in heartbreak, always beginning with dice. <words>204</words>  
Elira had followed the trail across galaxies, decoding the ink of memory and the syntax of sorrow, until it led her here—to Ralix, to the brig, to the end. <words>234</words>  
She closes her eyes and lets the dice rest on her palm, channeling the echoes of the past through them, feeling the weight of choices made and unmade. <words>263</words>  
Ralix’s blood sings in the dice, a harmony of guilt and longing, and Elira sees it all: the first betrayal on Earth, the duel on Mars, the kiss on Titan. <words>296</words>  
Each life a stanza in a poem of doomed love, each death a comma, never a period, and now she holds the final verse. <words>319</words>  
The brig door hisses open, and Ralix steps in, his eyes shadowed by regret, his voice trembling as he says, “You found the diaries.” <words>343</words>  
“I did,” Elira replies, her tone soft but unyielding, “and I know who you are, who we’ve been, and what we must choose now.” <words>370</words>  
He kneels before her, not in surrender but in recognition, and she offers him the dice, the chipped one facing up like a scar that never healed. <words>399</words>  
“If we roll them together,” she says, “we might lengthen the thread into something new—something that doesn’t end in silence.” <words>419</words>  
Ralix nods, tears catching in the artificial gravity, and together they roll the dice, not to decide fate, but to rewrite it. <words>443</words>  
The chipped die lands true this time, and Elira feels the alarm bells hush, not because the pain is gone, but because it finally has a voice. <words>475</words>  
Outside, the last star fades, and morning light spills across the brig, not as an ending, but as the first line of a new diary. <words>500</words>
