Jax, a scrappy tavern-hand with a mop of straw-colored hair and a grin that could curdle milk, had never believed in destiny—until the vacuum chamber garden began to whisper. <words>28</words>  
The garden, sealed beneath a dome of glass and humming with artificial gravity, bloomed with flora that had never known sunlight, only the cold breath of engineered starlight. <words>52</words>  
Jax had stumbled into it while chasing a runaway keg, only to find himself inexplicably drawn to a patch of fossilized footprints embedded in the dried-up riverbed that bisected the chamber. <words>78</words>  
Each footprint pulsed faintly, as if echoing a heartbeat from a time when the sands of time flowed backward and logic had the consistency of soup. <words>100</words>  
He knelt, brushing dust from the impressions, and felt a jolt—like a memory not his own—of oceans that sang and skies that wept ink. <words>121</words>  
That was when he noticed the broken collection of seashells scattered beside the largest footprint, their jagged edges arranged in a spiral too deliberate to be accidental. <words>144</words>  
He reached out, and the shells shimmered, randomizing their positions with a clatter that echoed like laughter in a cathedral. <words>161</words>  
Jax blinked, and the garden shifted—plants rearranged themselves, vines curling into glyphs, petals spelling out riddles in forgotten dialects. <words>180</words>  
He stood, predictably unpredictable as ever, and muttered, “Well, that’s new,” with the same tone he used when the ale turned to vinegar mid-pour. <words>200</words>  
The footprints began to glow, and Jax felt the inescapable calling tug at his ribs like a fishhook made of moonlight and regret. <words>220</words>  
He tried to walk away, but the garden folded space around him, looping his steps until he stood again before the spiral of broken shells. <words>241</words>  
A voice, neither male nor female, neither kind nor cruel, whispered through the chamber: “To catapult imagination beyond known realms, you must first forget the tavern.” <words>265</words>  
Jax scoffed, “I barely remember breakfast,” but his fingers trembled as he touched the center shell, which pulsed with a warmth that smelled like salt and thunder. <words>288</words>  
The chamber darkened, and the fossilized footprints lifted from the ground, floating like constellations rearranging themselves to form a map only dreamers could read. <words>310</words>  
Jax, ever the reluctant hero, felt his feet leave the ground, his body unraveling into thought, his thoughts unraveling into stardust. <words>328</words>  
He laughed, a sound both flippant and solemn, as the garden dissolved into a kaleidoscope of impossible geometries and the shells sang in harmonies of elsewhere. <words>349</words>  
Through the footprints, he traveled—not forward, not backward, but sideways into a realm where tavern-hands became cartographers of the unreal. <words>368</words>  
There, he would randomize the laws of nature, plant seeds of paradox, and harvest stories that bent time like wire. <words>386</words>  
And though he missed the clatter of mugs and the smell of spilled ale, he knew this was his place—etched in fossil, sung by shells, demanded by destiny. <words>412</words>  
Because some callings, no matter how absurd or inconvenient, are inescapable—and Jax, predictably unpredictable, had finally answered. <words>428</words>
