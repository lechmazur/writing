In the humid dusk of the firefly breeding grounds, where the air shimmered with bioluminescent whispers, an amiable gambler named Corwin knelt beside a moss-covered stump, thumbing through a vintage ledger bound in cracked leather. <words>33</words>  
The ledger, once belonging to his grandfather—a court accountant before the fall—held secrets not of numbers, but of names, places, and the art of unbecoming. <words>55</words>  
Corwin was mildly obsessed with the idea that unbecoming wasn’t about losing oneself, but about shedding the false layers imposed by time, like petals falling from a flower. <words>81</words>  
He had learned this method from the ledger’s final pages, where ink faded into poetry and instructions, guiding him to hydrolyze the past not with violence, but with grace. <words>109</words>  
Each charity drive in the nearby villages became his stage, where he gambled not for coin, but for stories, heirlooms, and forgotten truths traded over laughter and ale. <words>137</words>  
The villagers adored him, unaware that behind his easy smile and lucky dice, Corwin was piecing together the shattered lineage of a lost kingdom—his own. <words>161</words>  
The kingdom had fallen not to war, but to erosion—of memory, of purpose, of identity—until it became myth, then silence. <words>180</words>  
Corwin’s peaceful anger simmered beneath his charm, a quiet rebellion against the amnesia that had swallowed his bloodline. <words>198</words>  
He believed that unbecoming the gambler, the jester, the orphan, was the only way to become the heir again. <words>216</words>  
The fireflies, drawn to his presence, blinked in patterns he had come to interpret as omens, their light a language older than the kingdom itself. <words>242</words>  
During one charity drive beneath the canopy of whispering trees, an old woman offered him a torn page from a hymnbook, its margins scribbled with royal sigils. <words>270</words>  
He traded her a silver ring he’d won from a drunk baron, and in that moment, another petal fell. <words>288</words>  
Night after night, he returned to the breeding grounds, laying out the ledger, the hymn page, and other relics, letting the fireflies dance above them. <words>316</words>  
He believed their light could hydrolyze the lies clinging to these objects, dissolving falsehoods via the way petals fall from a flower—soft, inevitable, true. <words>344</words>  
One evening, as the fireflies pulsed in a spiral, Corwin read aloud the names from the ledger, his voice steady with peaceful anger. <words>368</words>  
The air thickened, and the ground beneath him trembled—not with violence, but with recognition. <words>384</words>  
The breeding grounds, once a sanctuary of insects, became a cathedral of memory, and Corwin, unbecoming the gambler, stood as the kingdom’s echo. <words>410</words>  
He did not need a crown; he needed only the truth, restored piece by piece, through obsession, through grace, through the art of unbecoming. <words>436</words>  
And as the fireflies circled him like stars reborn, Corwin smiled—not as a gambler, but as a king who had remembered. <words>460</words>
