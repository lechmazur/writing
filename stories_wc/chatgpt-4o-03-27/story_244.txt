The final petal drifted from the old rosebush outside the neon sign repair shop, curling like a whisper into the dusk. <words>21</words>  
Inside, Kaela wiped her hands on a rag, the scent of solder and ozone clinging to her fingers like memory. <words>36</words>  
She was a swordswoman once, before guilt carved its name into her soul with every life she took. <words>50</words>  
Now, she repaired broken light—quiet work for a woman who once shattered worlds. <words>60</words>  
On the wall above her workbench hung a tribal mask, its labyrinthine carvings pulsing faintly under the flicker of neon. <words>75</words>  
It had been gifted to her by a dying seer who whispered, “This is the key to the door of release.” <words>91</words>  
Kaela didn’t know what the door was, only that it called to her in dreams of windless plains and silent stars. <words>107</words>  
She had tried to forget, to bury the past beneath layers of circuitry and glass tubing. <words>119</words>  
But the mask watched her, and the guilt never slept. <words>127</words>  
So she began to pursue the truth, reservedly bold, like a blade drawn halfway from its sheath. <words>141</words>  
She sought out half-truth historians—those who knew just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be silenced. <words>156</words>  
From them, she gleaned secrets: of ancient doors hidden in forgotten places, of masks that whispered riddles to the worthy. <words>172</words>  
Each tale was a shard, and Kaela pieced them together with the precision of a sword stroke. <words>185</words>  
The mask, she learned, was not merely carved—it was etched with a map, a path through the labyrinth of her own remorse. <words>202</words>  
One night, as the neon signs outside buzzed like distant insects, she placed the mask over her face. <words>215</words>  
The world shifted; the shop dissolved into a corridor of light and shadow, walls breathing with ancient sorrow. <words>229</words>  
At the end stood a door, pulsing with the same rhythm as her heart. <words>239</words>  
She stepped forward, each footfall echoing with the names of those she had slain. <words>250</words>  
The door did not judge—it waited. <words>255</words>  
Kaela reached out, her hand trembling not with fear, but with the weight of release. <words>267</words>  
She opened it. <words>269</words>  
Beyond was not redemption, nor punishment, but understanding—a place where guilt could be laid down like a sword. <words>284</words>  
She stepped through, and the mask crumbled behind her, its purpose fulfilled. <words>294</words>  
The neon signs flickered once, then glowed steady, as if the world exhaled. <words>305</words>  
Kaela was gone, but the door remained, waiting for the next soul brave enough to seek the unknown. <words>319</words>  
And outside, the rosebush bloomed again, one petal at a time. <words>328</words>
