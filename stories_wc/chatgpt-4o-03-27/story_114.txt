After the last breath of a dying god, the world exhaled into silence, and in that hush, a shared dream recording studio flickered to life. <words>23</words>  
Its walls shimmered with the residue of forgotten thoughts, and in the center sat an apathetic summoner named Lior, slouched in a beanbag chair. <words>45</words>  
Lior was enthusiastically lazy, a paradox wrapped in a hoodie, who summoned spirits only when the mood struck and only if they brought snacks. <words>68</words>  
He had no interest in power or glory—his only motivation was to rebuild coral reefs, not out of virtue, but because he liked fish. <words>91</words>  
The studio’s ceiling pulsed with dreamlight, and on the far wall hung matching empty frames, portals to memories that had never been lived. <words>113</words>  
Lior’s fingers toyed with a rustic coffee grinder, its wooden body worn smooth by generations of use, though he never ground coffee—he liked the sound. <words>138</words>  
He turned the handle slowly, and with each creak, the frames on the wall began to shimmer, unfolding scenes from the river of wisdom. <words>161</words>  
The river flowed not with water, but with truths too old for language, and Lior watched as they danced through the frames like silver fish. <words>185</words>  
He sighed, not from boredom, but from the weight of knowing he’d have to do something soon, and doing things was exhausting. <words>206</words>  
Still, the coral reefs were dying, and the fish he liked were disappearing, so he summoned a spirit of sediment and salt. <words>228</words>  
The spirit emerged through the frames, its form unfolding like kelp in current, whispering secrets in the dialect of tides. <words>247</words>  
Lior barely moved, only raised an eyebrow, but the spirit understood—he wanted to know how to restore what had been bleached away. <words>270</words>  
The spirit answered not in words, but in images: polyps blooming, currents shifting, and hands—his hands—scattering spores like stars. <words>291</words>  
He groaned, stretched, and muttered, “Fine,” as if agreeing to help was a personal tragedy, then reached for the grinder again. <words>312</words>  
With each turn, the frames unfolded new instructions, ancient techniques encoded in dream logic, only decipherable by the enthusiastically lazy. <words>333</words>  
Lior followed them, not with urgency, but with a kind of gentle sharpness, like a tide that never stops but never hurries. <words>354</words>  
And as he worked, the studio filled with coral light, the dream recording itself into the world, reef by reef, breath by breath. <words>376</words>  
The god was dead, but the river still flowed, and in its wisdom, even apathy could become action, if only for the fish. <words>398</words>
