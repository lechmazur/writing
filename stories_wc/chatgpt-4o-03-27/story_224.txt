The lingering minstrel stood at the edge of the giant’s dining room, his lute slung across his back like a forgotten promise. <words>20</words>  
He had wandered far from the villages below, drawn not by coin or fame, but by the ache of a mundane existence. <words>39</words>  
The room stretched endlessly, its ceiling lost in shadows, and the table above him groaned with platters the size of rooftops. <words>58</words>  
He arrived amid rush hour, when the giants returned from their labor, stomping through the stone halls with thunderous steps. <words>76</words>  
Yet none noticed the tiny figure slipping between their boots, his presence affirmed by silence rather than spectacle. <words>93</words>  
He was openly private, a contradiction that suited him—his songs told truths he never dared speak aloud. <words>109</words>  
In his satchel, wrapped in velvet, he carried the witch’s gnarled wooden ladle, stolen from a crumbling tower. <words>126</words>  
It was said to stir not just soups, but the very essence of memory and time. <words>139</words>  
He had no recipe, only a hope that it might rejuvenate the soul he felt slipping away. <words>155</words>  
Climbing a chair leg like a vine-covered cliff, he reached the tabletop, where crumbs were boulders and spills, lakes. <words>173</words>  
There, nestled beside a cracked salt cellar, lay a meteorite fragment, its surface rough and whispering with ancient texture. <words>191</words>  
He pressed his palm to it, and the sensation surged through him—cold, coarse, and impossibly alive. <words>205</words>  
Memories not his own flickered behind his eyes: stars birthing in silence, planets weeping molten tears. <words>219</words>  
He dipped the ladle into a puddle of spilled broth, then touched it to the meteorite’s skin. <words>234</words>  
The broth shimmered, thickened, and began to glow, casting soft light across the vast wooden plains. <words>248</words>  
He drank, and the taste was like forgotten lullabies and the first breath after drowning. <words>261</words>  
His heart beat louder, not faster, as if rediscovering its purpose in the rhythm of the cosmos. <words>276</words>  
A giant paused mid-bite, sensing something shift, but said nothing—affirmed by silence, the minstrel remained unseen. <words>291</words>  
He sang then, not aloud, but within, a melody that stitched together the frayed edges of his being. <words>307</words>  
The ladle pulsed warm in his hand, its gnarled wood now smooth where his fingers gripped it. <words>321</words>  
He descended the chair, lighter than before, the weight of his longing replaced by quiet resolve. <words>335</words>  
Outside, the sun dipped low, and the rush of giants faded into the hush of twilight. <words>349</words>  
He walked on, not to escape, but to arrive—each step a note in the song he was becoming. <words>365</words>  
The minstrel had not found magic; he had remembered it, hidden in texture, silence, and the will to change. <words>383</words>  
And though no one clapped, no one cheered, he was affirmed by silence, and that was enough. <words>398</words>
