Steam curled from the chipped clay teapot as Cassius waited for the leaves to steep, his fingers drumming against the marble stall counter of the reimagined Roman marketplace. <words>27</words>  
The air buzzed with the scent of roasted olives and the low hum of encrypted trade, where vendors sold secrets alongside spices. <words>43</words>  
Cassius, a hacker with a moral code etched deeper than any law, had come not for coin but for a name—one erased from every scroll and server. <words>66</words>  
He wore a tunic stitched with circuit-thread, blending ancient drape with modern stealth, and carried a broken rake handle strapped to his back like a relic. <words>87</words>  
Few noticed the tiny inscriptions carved along its length—code fragments, coordinates, and memories—his method of preserving truths too fragile for digital vaults. <words>106</words>  
The marketplace, though ancient in design, pulsed with augmented overlays: holographic laurel wreaths, AI-driven oracles, and stalls that whispered in Latin and binary. <words>126</words>  
Cassius approached a vendor whose wares were rarely common—bottle caps from lost civilizations, each one etched with a symbol of forgotten resistance. <words>144</words>  
He traded a line of code for a cap bearing the Hydra sigil, a clue in his quest to retrieve the name of the one they called "the Monster." <words>168</words>  
The Monster had once been a philosopher, a healer, a mother—until the Senate deemed her dangerous and scrubbed her from memory. <words>185</words>  
Cassius had adopted her cause not out of pity, but because her story mirrored his own: brilliance punished, truth buried. <words>201</words>  
He traced the rake handle’s carvings, recalling the night he’d found it in the ruins of a collapsed data library, its wood scorched but intact. <words>221</words>  
Each inscription he added since had been a breadcrumb, leading him through layers of myth and malware toward her erased identity. <words>237</words>  
A child tugged at his tunic, offering a cap with a crude face drawn in charcoal—“She said you’d need this,” the child whispered. <words>254</words>  
Cassius knelt, examining the cap; beneath the soot was a micro-etching, coordinates to a hidden archive beneath the old Senate steps. <words>270</words>  
He thanked the child and offered a smile—rarely common in this place, but genuine—and tucked the cap into his satchel. <words>285</words>  
The tea was ready now, its aroma grounding him as he prepared for the descent into the archive’s shadows. <words>299</words>  
He sipped, letting the warmth steady his nerves, and reviewed the final inscription he’d carved that morning: “To humanize the monster is to remember her name.” <words>321</words>  
With confident uncertainty, he stepped into the alley behind the spice stall, where a hidden lift awaited, disguised as a wine press. <words>338</words>  
The lift groaned downward, gears grinding like ancient teeth, until it opened into a chamber lit by flickering data-torches. <words>353</words>  
There, among shattered busts and corrupted scrolls, stood a terminal—its interface archaic, its firewalls formidable. <words>366</words>  
Cassius inserted the rake handle into a carved slot, the inscriptions aligning with the terminal’s grooves like a key. <words>380</words>  
The screen flickered, then bloomed with her face—soft, defiant, human—and beneath it, her name: Livia Octavia. <words>394</words>  
He exhaled, the weight of centuries lifting slightly, and whispered, “Welcome back.” <words>403</words>
