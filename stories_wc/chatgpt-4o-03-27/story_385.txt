In the quiet shift before sunrise in the hospital ward, Dr. Elara Venn moved like a shadow between beds, her mind not on patients but on the obsidian skyscraper across the street. <words>28</words> 

Its windows reflected the moonlight like ancient mirrors, and she believed the building held the key to decoding the symbols that had haunted her dreams for months. <words>51</words> 

She was a pleasant meddler by nature, always inserting herself into puzzles that didn’t belong to her, but this one had chosen her. <words>70</words> 

The symbols first appeared in the margins of old patient charts, scattered like seeds across time and paper, unnoticed by anyone else. <words>90</words> 

They matched no known language, yet they pulsed with meaning, as if whispering secrets only she could hear. <words>105</words> 

Elara’s obsession had grown openly manipulative; she’d reassigned nurses, altered schedules, and even faked equipment malfunctions to buy herself time alone. <words>126</words> 

She believed the answer lay not in the hospital, but in the footprints left by a nighttime beach wanderer she’d once followed. <words>145</words> 

That wanderer had walked backward, leaving receding footprints that led her to a rusted pair of ice skates buried in the sand. <words>165</words> 

The skates were impossibly old, their blades etched with the same symbols now appearing in her charts. <words>179</words> 

She’d taken them, hidden them in her locker, and felt something inside her weaken each time she touched them. <words>196</words> 

Not her body, but her certainty—her grip on what was real and what was imagined. <words>209</words> 

The symbols began to appear in her dreams, then in the condensation on windows, then in the patterns of spilled coffee. <words>229</words> 

She realized they weren’t just messages—they were instructions, scattered seeds meant to grow only in the right mind. <words>247</words> 

And she was the soil. <words>251</words> 

Tonight, she would act. <words>254</words> 

She left the ward, crossed the street, and entered the obsidian skyscraper through a service door she’d unlocked days ago. <words>274</words> 

Inside, the air was thick with silence, the kind that hums with anticipation. <words>286</words> 

She climbed to the top floor, where the walls were covered in the same symbols, glowing faintly in the dark. <words>305</words> 

In the center of the room stood a pedestal, and on it, a shallow bowl filled with sand. <words>320</words> 

She placed the rusted ice skates beside it, and the symbols on the walls began to shift. <words>335</words> 

They rearranged themselves, forming a map that traced the receding footprints she’d once followed. <words>348</words> 

Elara understood then: the wanderer had been her, in another time, scattering seeds of knowledge backward through memory. <words>367</words> 

The skates were the key, the weakening a necessary surrender of ego to receive the message. <words>382</words> 

She stepped into the bowl, the sand warm beneath her feet, and the symbols surged with light. <words>397</words> 

Lucid confusion washed over her as the skyscraper dissolved into stars, and she finally read the message she had written to herself. <words>417</words> 

It said only: “You are the soil, the seed, and the bloom.” <words>428</words> 

And then she was gone, scattered across time like the symbols she had chased. <words>442</words>
