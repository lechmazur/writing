In the last flicker of a guttering lantern, Marlow pressed his fingers to the rim of a plain white candle, watching wax pool like tears on the stone floor. <words>26</words>  
He was a morbid florist by trade, known for arranging funeral wreaths that whispered secrets to the dead. <words>41</words>  
But tonight, he sat cross-legged in the floating rock dojo, suspended above a sea of stars, seeking something beyond petals and decay. <words>61</words>  
The dojo drifted silently, tethered only by the gravity of forgotten philosophies and the occasional gust of cosmic wind. <words>76</words>  
Marlow’s beliefs had once burned bright, but time and loss had tempered them into something quieter, something neutrally passionate. <words>92</words>  
He no longer raged against the void, nor embraced it—he simply obliged its presence, like a guest who overstayed but never left. <words>110</words>  
Before him lay a battered trunk, its brass hinges groaning as he opened it to reveal a backlog of typed pages. <words>126</words>  
They were the writings of a long-dead writer-monk who had once trained here, each page a meditation on the cycles of stars and souls. <words>146</words>  
Marlow read them slowly, his eyes tracing the faded ink as if it were a map to the divine. <words>160</words>  
The words spoke of birth and rot, of galaxies blooming like lilies and collapsing like lungs emptied of breath. <words>174</words>  
He felt the weight of each sentence settle into his bones, not as truth, but as possibility. <words>186</words>  
The candle flickered, casting shadows that danced like mourners across the dojo’s wooden beams. <words>198</words>  
Marlow reached for a page that trembled in the breeze, its corner curling like a dying leaf. <words>211</words>  
It spoke of obligation—not to gods or doctrines, but to understanding, to the sacred duty of asking why. <words>225</words>  
He thought of the funerals he’d adorned, the grieving hands that clutched his flowers, the silence that followed every eulogy. <words>240</words>  
Each arrangement had been a question, not an answer, and now he saw that his life had always been a dialogue with the cosmos. <words>258</words>  
The dojo creaked as it shifted, aligning with a constellation that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>270</words>  
Marlow stood, the candle in hand, and walked to the edge where the stars began. <words>282</words>  
He held the flame aloft, not to banish darkness, but to greet it. <words>292</words>  
In that boldly timid gesture, he obliged the universe once more, not with certainty, but with reverent curiosity. <words>307</words>  
The pages rustled behind him, as if approving, as if the writer-monk’s spirit stirred in the ink. <words>320</words>  
Marlow whispered a vow—not to know, but to seek, to arrange the cosmos as he had flowers: with care, with awe. <words>338</words>  
The candle guttered, then steadied, its flame mirroring the stars above and the quiet fire within. <words>351</words>  
He smiled, neutrally passionate, and sat once more, ready to read, to write, to understand. <words>364</words>  
The floating rock dojo drifted onward, a petal on the breath of eternity. <words>374</words>  
And Marlow, morbid florist, seeker of cycles, obliged the mystery with every beat of his tempered heart. <words>388</words>
