The stoic wanderer arrived at the witch’s familiar training ground just as the teacher wiped the final formula from the chalk-dusted slate. <words>21</words>  
The air shimmered with the residue of spells, and the scent of burnt sage clung to the mossy stones like a warning. <words>38</words>  
He had followed a trail of nightmares to get here—visions of clawed hands, whispering mouths, and a cabin that bled shadows. <words>55</words>  
In his pack, wrapped in oilcloth and silence, he carried a floorboard from that very cabin, its grain etched with forgotten sigils. <words>74</words>  
The floorboard was mesmerizingly bland to the untrained eye, but to him, it pulsed with the weight of necessary lies. <words>89</words>  
He had told the villagers the cabin was empty, that no rituals had ever taken place there, that the screams were wind. <words>106</words>  
But he knew better—he had imposed silence on truth to protect the fragile balance between memory and myth. <words>120</words>  
The training ground was quiet now, the apprentices gone, their familiars still flickering in the trees like half-formed thoughts. <words>135</words>  
He stepped onto the circle of scorched earth where familiars were summoned, the floorboard in hand, and knelt. <words>149</words>  
His fingers traced the sigils, coaxing them to life, whispering the names of rituals long buried beneath layers of denial. <words>165</words>  
He wasn’t here to summon, but to archive—to preserve the practices before they vanished into the ether of forgotten magic. <words>181</words>  
The ground trembled slightly, not in fear, but in recognition, as if the earth remembered what the world had chosen to forget. <words>198</words>  
He spoke softly, with brash tenderness, naming each rite, each forbidden gesture, each lie told to keep the truth alive. <words>214</words>  
The floorboard glowed faintly, absorbing the words, becoming a vessel of memory, a ledger of the unspoken. <words>227</words>  
He had no name, no home, only the burden of remembering what others refused to carry. <words>239</words>  
The nightmares had not led him astray—they had guided him to the last place where truth could be safely hidden. <words>255</words>  
As the sun dipped below the twisted trees, he buried the floorboard beneath the summoning circle, sealing it with a final breath. <words>272</words>  
He stood, his face unreadable, and vanished into the woods, leaving behind only the scent of sage and the echo of necessary lies. <words>289</words>  
Somewhere, a familiar stirred, sensing the shift, and the training ground exhaled, as if relieved to be remembered. <words>303</words>  
The stoic wanderer walked on, following the next nightmare, carrying the weight of rituals and the tenderness of truth unspoken. <words>319</words>  
He would impose memory where silence had taken root, not for glory, but because someone had to. <words>332</words>  
And in the end, that was enough. <words>336</words>
