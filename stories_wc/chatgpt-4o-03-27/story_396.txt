Marceline had always been a charmingly forgetful urban forager, known in the Montmartre alleys for mistaking moss for mint and yet somehow crafting teas that made poets weep. <words>27</words> 

She wandered the city with a satchel full of mismatched herbs and a single, jagged fragment of a stained-glass window she’d found wedged in a gutter. <words>50</words> 

The glass shimmered oddly, catching light even in shadow, and Marceline, though she couldn’t recall where she’d picked it up, felt it pulsed with a fragile wonder. <words>74</words> 

She kept it wrapped in silk, tucked between dried nettle and lavender, convinced it was a relic from a forgotten cathedral or perhaps a saint’s dream. <words>97</words> 

One rainy afternoon, she ducked into a science fair held in the catacombs beneath Paris, a labyrinthine champagne vault repurposed for eccentric minds and their inventions. <words>121</words> 

She hadn’t meant to attend—it was a chance encounter, really, following the scent of truffle oil and ozone down a stairwell she didn’t remember noticing. <words>145</words> 

Inside, the vault buzzed with static and champagne bubbles, and booths blinked with neon hypotheses and robotic arms pouring flutes with mechanical grace. <words>167</words> 

Marceline wandered, disinterested but curious, until she stumbled upon a display of refracted light studies, where a young physicist named Étienne adjusted prisms with trembling hands. <words>192</words> 

Their eyes met, and he smiled, distractedly charming, as if he’d forgotten why he was there but remembered her from a dream. <words>211</words> 

She showed him the stained-glass fragment, and his breath caught; he claimed it matched a missing piece from a medieval observatory lens lost during the Revolution. <words>236</words> 

The lens, he explained, was designed to focus moonlight into a beam that revealed hidden inscriptions on ancient manuscripts—an alchemical marvel lost to time. <words>260</words> 

Marceline, skeptical but intrigued, agreed to negotiate its return, but only if it would be used to protect, not exploit, the wonder it revealed. <words>284</words> 

Étienne nodded solemnly, and they sealed the agreement with a toast of vintage champagne, the vault echoing with the clink of fragile glass. <words>305</words> 

As the final performance of the fair began—a kinetic sculpture of light and sound—Marceline and Étienne slipped behind the stage, the fragment cradled between them. <words>330</words> 

They fitted it into a reconstructed lens, and moonlight, funneled through a skylight above, struck it with a hum that silenced the crowd. <words>353</words> 

On the wall, glowing script unfurled in forgotten tongues, and gasps rippled through the vault as centuries of lost knowledge shimmered into view. <words>375</words> 

But Marceline, ever disinterested in acclaim, slipped away before the applause, forgetting even to take her satchel, though she remembered the wonder she’d shielded. <words>399</words> 

She wandered back into the Paris night, the scent of lavender trailing behind her, already forgetting Étienne’s name but not the way the light had danced. <words>423</words> 

Above her, the moon blinked through clouds, and somewhere beneath the city, a vault whispered secrets to those who still believed in fragile things. <words>445</words>
