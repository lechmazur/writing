Through the hush of fate unraveling, Father Elian jogged beneath the dull radiance of a sun that never fully committed to shining. <words>21</words>  
He was an unapologetically confused man, a lapsed priest whose faith had frayed like the hem of his once-sacred robes. <words>39</words>  
The labyrinth orchard of giant beanstalks loomed around him, their stalks thick as towers, their leaves whispering secrets in a language older than sin. <words>60</words>  
He clutched an abacus with missing beads, its gaps a cruel metaphor for the prayers he’d forgotten and the penance he’d never completed. <words>80</words>  
Each bead that remained clicked with a hollow sound, echoing the emptiness he carried since abandoning the altar for silence. <words>96</words>  
He had come here not to find redemption, but to step beyond fate’s design, to see if choice still mattered in a world ruled by patterns. <words>118</words>  
The snow had begun to fall days ago, not from the sky, but from the clouds tangled in the uppermost leaves of the beanstalks. <words>140</words>  
It drifted down in spirals, forming strange constellations on the ground, and Elian followed them, believing they mapped a path not yet written. <words>162</words>  
He jogged not for speed but for rhythm, syncing his breath with the pulse of the orchard, hoping to awaken something buried deep within. <words>182</words>  
The orchard was endless, its paths shifting subtly, as if the stalks themselves conspired to test his resolve or mock his confusion. <words>200</words>  
Once, he had believed in divine order, in a God who counted every hair and every sin, but now he trusted only the snow’s design. <words>222</words>  
He paused at a clearing where the snow formed a spiral, and in its center lay a single bead—identical to those missing from his abacus. <words>244</words>  
He knelt, breath steaming, and picked it up, feeling a jolt of memory: a confession half-heard, a child’s question unanswered, a sermon delivered without conviction. <words>266</words>  
The price of complacency, he realized, was not damnation but drift—becoming a man who moved without direction, who mistook motion for meaning. <words>284</words>  
He slid the bead into the abacus, and it clicked into place with a sound that felt like a heartbeat returning after long silence. <words>304</words>  
The snow patterns shifted instantly, forming a new trail that curved sharply left, away from the orchard’s heart and toward a stalk that shimmered faintly. <words>326</words>  
Elian rose and jogged again, faster now, the abacus clutched tight, its weight no longer a burden but a compass. <words>343</words>  
He passed stalks that bent slightly as he neared, as if acknowledging his choice, or perhaps warning him of what lay ahead. <words>361</words>  
The dull radiance brightened imperceptibly, and for the first time in years, Elian felt the stirrings of purpose, fragile but undeniable. <words>379</words>  
He would follow the snow until it stopped, until the orchard ended or he did, because even confusion deserved a destination. <words>397</words>  
And if fate unraveled in the process, so be it—he had already paid the price of standing still. <words>411</words>
