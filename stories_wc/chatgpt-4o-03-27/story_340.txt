When the clock dares to skip a beat in the treehouse city of Viridia, something wicked usually follows. <words>17</words> 

That morning, the vines trembled, the parrots squawked in Morse code, and the bridges between homes snapped shut without warning. <words>34</words> 

It was the sudden closure of a usual path that first alerted Marlo, the proud exorcist with a flair for the dramatic. <words>49</words> 

He adjusted his crimson sash, muttered a curse at the humidity, and tucked the wizard’s battered grimoire under his arm. <words>63</words> 

The book, older than the city’s oldest banyan, smelled of mildew and misplaced ambition. <words>72</words> 

Marlo had inherited it from his mentor, who’d vanished mid-incantation while trying to youthify a jaguar. <words>84</words> 

The jaguar now ran a smoothie stand and refused to talk about it. <words>92</words> 

Marlo’s mission today was not to fix jungle smoothies, but to outshine a looming shadow—his late mentor’s legacy. <words>106</words> 

Everyone still whispered about the old man’s feats, like the time he exorcised a demon from a toucan using only sarcasm. <words>121</words> 

Marlo, endearingly feisty and chronically underestimated, was determined to be remembered for more than his mentor’s leftovers. <words>134</words> 

He climbed the spiral vine-ladder to the Council Tree, where the elders were already panicking in coordinated robes. <words>147</words> 

“The Path of Roots has sealed itself,” Elder Pira said, wringing her hands like they were wet laundry. <words>159</words> 

“That path connects us to the Heartwood—our power source!” <words>165</words> 

Marlo rolled his eyes. “Yes, thank you, exposition fairy.” <words>172</words> 

He flipped open the grimoire, its pages fluttering like startled bats. <words>180</words> 

A spell glowed faintly: “Chrono-Suture: For when time misbehaves.” <words>188</words> 

“Perfect,” Marlo muttered, tracing the glyphs with a finger stained by ink and mango. <words>198</words> 

He chanted, the words curling through the air like mischievous smoke. <words>207</words> 

The treehouse city shuddered, and the sealed path groaned open like a reluctant jaw. <words>217</words> 

But something else emerged—a shadowy figure, half-formed, wearing his mentor’s grin. <words>227</words> 

“Miss me?” it asked, voice like rusted wind chimes. <words>234</words> 

Marlo’s heart thudded. “You’re supposed to be dead.” <words>241</words> 

“Death’s boring,” the shadow said. “Thought I’d drop by.” <words>250</words> 

Marlo squared his shoulders. “Well, I’ve got a city to protect and a legacy to rewrite.” <words>262</words> 

He flipped to a page labeled “Youthify: Advanced.” <words>269</words> 

“Let’s see how you handle being twelve again, old man.” <words>277</words> 

The spell burst from his hands in a swirl of neon leaves. <words>286</words> 

The shadow shrieked, shrinking, until a confused preteen in oversized robes stood blinking. <words>297</words> 

Marlo grinned. “Welcome back to puberty, mentor.” <words>304</words> 

The elders gasped, then applauded. <words>308</words> 

Marlo bowed with exaggerated flair, the grimoire tucked under one arm like a trophy. <words>319</words> 

Responsibility, he realized, wasn’t just about bearing weight—it was about knowing when to throw it. <words>331</words> 

And maybe, just maybe, being endearingly feisty helped too. <words>339</words> 

As the clock resumed its beat, the city exhaled, and Marlo finally felt taller than the shadow he’d chased. <words>353</words> 

He winked at the jaguar, who rolled his eyes and handed him a mango smoothie. <words>364</words> 

“Legacy tastes better with mango,” Marlo said, sipping. <words>371</words> 

The clock ticked on, but this time, it kept perfect time. <words>380</words>
