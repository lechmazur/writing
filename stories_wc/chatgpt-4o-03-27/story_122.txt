The sky burial site shimmered with heat, the bones of the dead bleached white beneath a sun that refused to blink. <words>20</words>  
A cyber-templar named Virex stood at the edge of the cliff, his chrome armor humming with a frequency only birds could hear. <words>39</words>  
He held a worn leather bridle in his gloved hands, its cracked surface whispering of a beast long gone, a mount that once obeyed. <words>59</words>  
The bridle was not for riding now—it was a relic, a tether to memory, and a key to the prism he carried. <words>78</words>  
Virex’s mission was not to bury the dead, but to prove that safety was a mirage, a lie refracted through comfort and illusion. <words>98</words>  
He had read the sacred texts encoded in ultraviolet, during the reading of the storm scrolls, when lightning danced like serpents across the sky. <words>118</words>  
Each bolt etched a truth into his neural cortex, and he had become patiently frantic, a paradox of calm urgency. <words>134</words>  
The storm was coming again, and this time, he would not kneel—he would reflect its fury back upon itself. <words>150</words>  
He placed the bridle on the altar of bones, aligning it with the prism’s axis, letting the sun’s rays fracture through the crystal. <words>170</words>  
Colors exploded across the sky, not in beauty, but in warning—each hue a scream, each beam a blade. <words>185</words>  
The illusion of safety shattered as the light bent, revealing the storm’s true face: a godless hunger cloaked in thunder. <words>200</words>  
Virex stepped into the spectrum, his armor catching the refracted light, his body becoming a conduit of mirrored wrath. <words>216</words>  
He remembered the first time he saw lightning strike his village, how it spared no one, not even the praying. <words>231</words>  
That day, he vowed to become the blade that turned storms inward, to make the sky answer for its cruelty. <words>247</words>  
The prism pulsed, and the bridle caught fire—not with flame, but with memory, the beast’s final breath echoing in the wind. <words>263</words>  
Virex screamed—not in pain, but in euphoria, the agitation of purpose fulfilled, the climax of a life on collision with truth. <words>280</words>  
The storm struck, but the light struck back, refracted through the prism, redirected by the bridle’s alignment, vengeance in geometry. <words>296</words>  
Thunder cracked, but it was not the sky’s voice—it was Virex’s, amplified by the prism, a war cry of mirrored justice. <words>313</words>  
The storm recoiled, folding into itself, devouring its own lightning, its own illusion, its own false promise of safety. <words>328</words>  
Virex collapsed to his knees, the bridle now ash, the prism dark, but the sky clear for the first time in years. <words>345</words>  
He had proven it: safety was never given, only taken back from the storm, through light, through memory, through will. <words>361</words>  
And as the bones around him glowed with refracted dawn, he smiled, patiently frantic, ready for the next storm to come. <words>377</words>
