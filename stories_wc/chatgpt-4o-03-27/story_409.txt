The attic was thick with dust and silence, broken only by the soft ticking of clockwork animals frozen mid-motion. <words>20</words> 

A brass fox with a missing eye stared at the bruised fighter as he limped across the floorboards, each step echoing with pain. <words>39</words> 

He wasn’t born a fighter—he’d become one through necessity, through failure, through the slow erosion of lies he once told himself. <words>58</words> 

In his hand, he clutched a clay pot shard, its edges worn smooth, its surface etched with an inscription he couldn’t read but somehow understood. <words>80</words> 

The inscription pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat, guiding him deeper into the attic where forgotten dreams gathered like cobwebs in corners. <words>97</words> 

He had come here not to remember, but to abduct something from himself—something hidden, something that had kept him from standing for anything real. <words>118</words> 

The attic was his grandfather’s, a sculptor who believed the soul was revealed the moment the chisel first struck marble. <words>134</words> 

That moment, he’d said, was when truth began—when the stone could no longer pretend to be whole. <words>149</words> 

The fighter had never sculpted, but he knew what it meant to be struck and to crack. <words>163</words> 

He was skillfully incompetent at most things—he could throw a punch but not land it, could speak but not say what mattered. <words>181</words> 

But he had learned to survive, and now, survival wasn’t enough. <words>189</words> 

He knelt before a broken mechanical owl, its wings rusted mid-flap, and placed the shard into a hollow in its chest. <words>207</words> 

The owl clicked, gears grinding reluctantly, and its eyes glowed with a dim amber light. <words>219</words> 

From its beak came a whisper, not in words but in memory—his mother’s voice, telling him he was meant for more. <words>237</words> 

He had buried that voice beneath years of bruises and bravado, but now it rose like dust in sunlight. <words>252</words> 

The attic shimmered, and he saw himself as a boy, fists clenched, lying to himself that he didn’t care. <words>267</words> 

He reached out, not to comfort the boy, but to take back what he had left behind: belief. <words>280</words> 

The shard pulsed again, brighter now, and the inscription shifted, revealing a single word—“Stand.” <words>293</words> 

He stood, spine straightening, not because he was healed, but because he was ready to stop pretending he wasn’t broken. <words>310</words> 

The clockwork animals stirred, ticking in unison, as if time itself acknowledged his choice. <words>322</words> 

He descended the attic stairs, the shard warm in his palm, the owl’s whisper echoing in his chest. <words>336</words> 

Outside, the world waited, unchanged, but he was not the same man who had entered. <words>349</words> 

He had abducted the last vestige of self-deception from the attic of forgotten dreams. <words>361</words> 

He had stood for something—not victory, not vengeance, but truth. <words>370</words> 

And in that truth, bruised and skillfully incompetent as he was, he found the beginning of peace. <words>384</words> 

The chisel had struck, and the marble had cracked, and from it, a man had emerged. <words>398</words> 

Not perfect, not whole, but real. <words>403</words>
