The waxing moon cast a pale shimmer over the orchard island, its trees swaying gently despite the maelstrom that churned endlessly around them. <words>23</words>  
Eira, the critical midwife, moved between the gnarled trunks with a bundle of pressed herbs clutched tightly in her calloused hands. <words>41</words>  
She had delivered life into the world with precision and skepticism, but tonight she sought something far more elusive—her own stolen memories. <words>60</words>  
The island, adrift in the storm’s eye, was the last place she remembered before the gaps in her mind began to widen. <words>79</words>  
Her cottage, half-swallowed by ivy and time, stood crooked near the orchard’s edge, its chimney still exhaling the scent of charred paper. <words>99</words>  
Inside, she knelt before the fireplace, where half-burned diaries whispered secrets in curling smoke and brittle ash. <words>113</words>  
She sifted through the remains, fingers blackened, until she found a page that hadn’t fully surrendered to flame. <words>128</words>  
The ink bled, but the words pulsed with familiarity: “To transcend, you must remember what was taken, not what was lost.” <words>147</words>  
Eira’s breath caught; the phrase echoed something she’d once said during a birth, though she couldn’t recall to whom. <words>162</words>  
She pressed the herbs to her chest, their scent unlocking a flicker of a memory—laughter, a child’s cry, a betrayal. <words>179</words>  
The orchard shimmered outside, each tree bearing fruit shaped like faces she almost recognized. <words>191</words>  
She stepped into the moonlight, the dissonant calm of the island wrapping around her like a forgotten lullaby. <words>205</words>  
Eira had always been openly secretive, revealing truths in riddles and hiding pain in plain sight. <words>219</words>  
Now, she whispered to the trees, naming them as if they were old friends: “Liora, Tomas, Elen—come back to me.” <words>238</words>  
The wind shifted, carrying voices from the maelstrom’s edge, voices that once called her mother, sister, traitor. <words>252</words>  
She followed the sound to the orchard’s heart, where a stone well pulsed with moonlight and memory. <words>266</words>  
Dropping the herbs into the well, she watched them dissolve, releasing scents that twisted the air into visions. <words>280</words>  
She saw herself younger, laughing, then screaming, then silenced by a hand she trusted. <words>291</words>  
The truth struck like lightning—her memories weren’t stolen; they were buried, hidden by her own will to survive. <words>308</words>  
To transcend, she now understood, was not to escape the past but to grow wiser through its thorns. <words>323</words>  
The orchard trembled, and the faces in the fruit smiled, their eyes no longer hollow. <words>335</words>  
Eira stood taller, the critical midwife reborn not through birth, but through remembrance. <words>348</words>  
The maelstrom began to recede, its fury calmed by the return of what was once forgotten. <words>361</words>  
Under the waxing moon’s glow, the island no longer drifted—it anchored itself in her reclaimed truth. <words>375</words>  
She turned from the well, her steps steady, her mind whole, her wisdom no longer growing but grown. <words>389</words>
