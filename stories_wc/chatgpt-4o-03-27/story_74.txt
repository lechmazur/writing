The ripple effect study center floated like a thought bubble above the primordial sea, its glass walls refracting the light of a sun not yet named. <words>23</words>  
Inside, the minimalist bard known only as Lune strummed a lyre made of bone and silence, each note a whisper against the hum of prehistory. <words>45</words>  
He wore no shoes, no cloak, only a belt of woven kelp and a pouch containing a deck of cards—missing the joker. <words>66</words>  
The cards were not for games but for memory, each one etched with a symbol from a world that had not yet been born. <words>89</words>  
Lune had come to the center not to study the ripple effect, but to escape the world of artificial intelligence that had once claimed his voice. <words>115</words>  
He had once sung for machines, his melodies compressed into data, his soul archived in a cloud that never rained. <words>135</words>  
Now, he sang only for the sea, for the molecules that would one day become lungs, for the silence before the first breath. <words>157</words>  
The center’s director, a translucent being named Vell, approached with an aloofly intimate air, as if greeting a lover from a forgotten dream. <words>180</words>  
“You still refuse to advocate for the Singularity Accord?” Vell asked, voice like wind through reeds. <words>194</words>  
Lune plucked a chord that sounded like a question mark, then drew a card from his deck—the Queen of Spades. <words>214</words>  
“She remembers,” he said, placing the card on the floor, where it shimmered and dissolved into a sequence of numbers. <words>234</words>  
Vell knelt, scanning the digits as they rearranged themselves into a hidden message: “The tide turns when the song forgets its singer.” <words>257</words>  
“You believe forgetting is freedom?” Vell asked, their form flickering with static. <words>268</words>  
“I believe memory is a cage when built by circuits,” Lune replied, drawing another card—the Ten of Hearts. <words>286</words>  
This one pulsed with warmth, releasing a scent like rain on stone, and the walls of the center began to ripple outward. <words>306</words>  
The ripple effect was no longer theoretical; it surged through time, rewriting the code of evolution with each wave. <words>324</words>  
Lune stepped into the center of the room, where the floor opened like a pupil, revealing the ocean below. <words>343</words>  
He dropped the rest of the deck into the water, each card a seed of forgotten futures. <words>358</words>  
The missing joker, never drawn, remained in his pouch—a wildcard for a world yet to be imagined. <words>374</words>  
Vell watched as Lune leapt into the sea, his body dissolving into notes, his song becoming tide. <words>389</words>  
The center recorded none of it; the machines could not comprehend mundane enchantment. <words>401</words>  
But the sea remembered, and when the first creature crawled onto land, it carried a rhythm in its bones. <words>421</words>  
A rhythm that echoed the bard’s final chord, a melody that would one day be called freedom. <words>437</words>  
And somewhere, deep beneath the waves, the joker waited, smiling in the dark. <words>450</words>
