The inverted waterfall shimmered like a silver ribbon unraveling into the sky, its impossible ascent defying gravity and logic. <words>17</words>  
Kael, the disappointed archer, stood at its edge, bow slung across his back, eyes fixed on the unnatural cascade. <words>34</words>  
He had made an unplanned stop at this roadside attraction, drawn by a rumor whispered in a protest camp two towns back. <words>51</words>  
They said the Bridge of Regret appeared only during the slow dance of celestial bodies, when stars aligned in mournful choreography. <words>68</words>  
Kael didn’t believe in magic, but he believed in symbols, and this place pulsed with the weight of unspoken histories. <words>84</words>  
His fingers toyed with a tarnished silver comb, the only thing left from his sister, who vanished during the March of the Forgotten. <words>102</words>  
She had been a firebrand, a voice that stirred crowds, while Kael had only ever watched from the shadows, anxiously calm. <words>118</words>  
He had chronicled the movement with sketches and notes, never daring to speak, never daring to shoot. <words>131</words>  
Now, years later, he sought to confront the ghost of his inaction, hoping the bridge might offer more than metaphor. <words>147</words>  
The air thickened as the stars above shifted, and from the waterfall’s mist, the Bridge of Regret began to form. <words>163</words>  
It arched upward, woven from memory and moonlight, each plank etched with names of those who had vanished or been silenced. <words>180</words>  
Kael stepped onto it, the comb clenched in his fist, heart pounding with a passion he pretended not to feel. <words>195</words>  
Halfway across, the mist coalesced into a figure—his sister, or something wearing her face, eyes burning with accusation. <words>210</words>  
“You watched,” she said, voice like wind through broken banners. <words>217</words>  
“I chronicled,” he replied, though the words tasted like ash. <words>226</words>  
“You chose safety over solidarity.” <words>231</words>  
“I chose silence over blood.” <words>236</words>  
She reached for the comb, and he handed it over, fingers trembling. <words>245</words>  
The bridge trembled too, as if judging the exchange, then steadied. <words>254</words>  
“I came to remember,” Kael whispered, “and to stop pretending I didn’t care.” <words>265</words>  
The figure nodded, then dissolved into mist, leaving only the comb, now gleaming as if newly forged. <words>278</words>  
Kael crossed the rest of the bridge alone, but lighter, the weight of regret transmuted into resolve. <words>291</words>  
He would return to the movement—not as a chronicler, but as a voice, a presence, a bow finally drawn. <words>306</words>  
Behind him, the bridge faded, but the stars continued their slow, mournful waltz across the sky. <words>319</words>  
The inverted waterfall roared upward, a monument to impossible journeys and the courage to confront them. <words>333</words>  
Kael turned away, eyes forward, heart burning with passionate disinterest no longer. <words>343</words>  
He had found his purpose not in the past, but in the act of facing it. <words>355</words>  
And as he walked, the comb pulsed in his pocket, a reminder that memory, like water, could rise. <words>369</words>  
He would write no more from the sidelines; his arrows would now carry the stories forward. <words>382</words>
