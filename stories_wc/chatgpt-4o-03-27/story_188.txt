The wind stirred the cherry blossoms as they fell like ash over the moss-covered stones of the ancient Japanese castle. <words>20</words> 

Inside, a man with a crooked back and a badge long buried in memory adjusted his vintage spectacles, their lenses cracked but still clear enough. <words>41</words> 

He was once a lawman in a land far from here, but now he lived among ghosts and rice fields, trying to escape a cycle of violence. <words>65</words> 

Each spring, during seed planting, he told himself this year would be different—that he would not be drawn back into the blood. <words>86</words> 

But the past had a way of stirring, like wind through dry leaves, and today it came in the form of a misplaced letter. <words>108</words> 

The envelope was yellowed, addressed to a name he didn’t recognize, yet the handwriting was unmistakably his late wife’s. <words>127</words> 

He opened it with trembling fingers, the paper brittle, the ink faded but legible: “To the one who still believes in gathering broken pieces.” <words>150</words> 

The words struck him like a blade; she had written it before her death, meant for someone else, but it had found the right person. <words>173</words> 

He read on, her voice echoing in his mind, urging him to forgive himself, to rebuild what violence had shattered. <words>192</words> 

Outside, villagers prepared the fields, their laughter distant, probably improbable in a world that had known so much sorrow. <words>211</words> 

He stepped into the courtyard, letter in hand, and watched a child drop a clay pot, shards scattering like memories. <words>230</words> 

Without thinking, he knelt and began gathering the broken pieces, fitting them together with a patience he thought he’d lost. <words>251</words> 

The child watched, wide-eyed, as the former lawman smiled for the first time in years, the corroded rapture of redemption warming his chest. <words>274</words> 

He handed the mended pot back, and the child bowed, unaware of the storm that had just passed through the old man’s soul. <words>296</words> 

That night, he placed the letter beside his spectacles and stared at the moonlight spilling through the paper walls. <words>314</words> 

He whispered a promise to the wind: no more blood, no more running, only planting, mending, and remembering. <words>332</words> 

The castle creaked around him, ancient and tired, but still standing—like him, like the world he hoped to help rebuild. <words>351</words> 

And as the seeds took root in the dark soil outside, so too did something fragile and new within him. <words>370</words> 

He would gather the broken pieces, not to forget, but to honor what once was and what could still be. <words>390</words> 

In the improbable quiet of that night, the cycle was broken—not by force, but by a letter that found the right heart. <words>412</words> 

And in that corroded rapture, he finally found peace. <words>419</words>
