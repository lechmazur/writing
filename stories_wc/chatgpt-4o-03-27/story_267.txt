The black hole resort shimmered like a mirage on the edge of spacetime, where gravity bent light and luxury alike. <words>17</words>  
Among its staff was a mild-tempered guard named Elian, whose poetically bland demeanor made him invisible to guests and gods. <words>35</words>  
He spent his shifts amid bike rides through the resort’s gravity-defying trails, where wheels spun in loops that defied Newton. <words>51</words>  
Elian wasn’t there for the paycheck or the perks, but to unravel the thread of a lie stitched into the universe. <words>69</words>  
He believed in neither hero nor villain, only in the quiet rebellion of those who refused the labels. <words>83</words>  
Each night, he followed stray cats through alleyways that twisted behind the resort’s event horizon, where secrets clung like dust. <words>101</words>  
The cats, unbothered by physics or fate, led him to places where reality frayed and truth bled through. <words>116</words>  
There, hidden beneath a collapsed observatory, lay a blacksmith’s anvil—an ancient relic humming with paradox. <words>130</words>  
Elian touched it, and memories not his own surged through him: wars fought in silence, peace brokered with lies. <words>145</words>  
He saw himself in every role—savior, destroyer, coward, martyr—and rejected them all with a smile. <words>158</words>  
To the resort’s elite, he wore a disguise: a uniform, a name tag, a forgettable face. <words>171</words>  
But beneath that, he was a cartographer of collapse, mapping the unraveling thread that bound all stories. <words>185</words>  
One morning, during a routine bike ride, he veered off-path and pedaled straight into a gravitational rift. <words>198</words>  
Time fractured; he emerged in a ballroom where guests danced in loops, their laughter echoing like screams. <words>212</words>  
He placed the anvil at the center of the floor, and the music stopped as if the universe inhaled. <words>227</words>  
“I am not your hero,” he said, voice soft but sharp, “nor your villain—I am the silence between.” <words>243</words>  
The guests dissolved into stardust, their roles no longer needed, their masks crumbling like ash. <words>255</words>  
Elian stood alone, the thread in his hand glowing with the weight of unchosen paths. <words>267</words>  
He didn’t pull it, didn’t cut it—just let it drift, poetically bland, into the singularity’s mouth. <words>281</words>  
Savage bliss washed over him as the resort collapsed inward, not in destruction, but in release. <words>294</words>  
The cats watched from the shadows, their eyes reflecting galaxies, their tails twitching in approval. <words>306</words>  
Elian smiled, finally unseen, finally unbound, finally neither this nor that—just a man who chose. <words>319</words>  
And somewhere, amid the folding of space and self, the anvil rang once, like a bell at the end of time. <words>336</words>  
The sound echoed through the void, not as a warning, but as a lullaby for those who refused to be named. <words>352</words>  
In the end, the thread unraveled not in chaos, but in clarity, each strand a truth no longer hidden. <words>367</words>  
And Elian, mild-tempered and forgotten, became the myth that needed no telling. <words>377</words>
