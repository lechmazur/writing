In the hush of a dreamless night, the giant mushroom meeting hall pulsed with a faint bioluminescent glow, casting long shadows across the mossy floor. <words>23</words>  
A gorgeously awkward bard named Elric stood at its center, his dry tongue clicking against his teeth as he prepared to speak. <words>41</words>  
He wore the cloak of doubt like a second skin, its folds stitched from years of self-questioning and half-sung truths. <words>58</words>  
In his trembling hands, he held a stained glass prism, its fractured colors dancing across the fungal walls like forgotten lullabies. <words>75</words>  
Elric had come not to perform, but to preserve something fragile—his own fading sense of self. <words>88</words>  
He had discovered, buried beneath layers of static and silence, a cache of forgotten voicemails left by a voice he once trusted. <words>106</words>  
Each message was a breadcrumb, leading him through the labyrinth of his own mind, past the prison bars he’d forged from shame. <words>124</words>  
The prism, once belonging to his mother, refracted not just light but memory, unlocking echoes trapped in the folds of time. <words>141</words>  
He placed it on the mossy altar at the hall’s center, where spores drifted like dust motes in a cathedral. <words>157</words>  
The voicemails played through a cracked speaker embedded in the mushroom’s stalk, their words warped but unmistakably hers. <words>173</words>  
“You are not your silence,” she had said, her voice a balm and a blade. <words>184</words>  
“You are the song you’ve yet to sing.” <words>190</words>  
Elric’s throat tightened, but he did not look away from the prism’s kaleidoscopic truth. <words>202</words>  
He had spent years cloaked in doubt, mistaking it for humility, for wisdom, for safety. <words>215</words>  
But now, in this fungal cathedral, he saw it for what it was: a shroud. <words>227</words>  
He began to hum, low and uncertain, the notes catching like dew on spider silk. <words>239</words>  
The prism caught the sound, refracted it, and the hall responded with a harmony older than language. <words>253</words>  
Elric’s voice grew stronger, shedding awkwardness like old skin, until it rang clear and gorgeously true. <words>267</words>  
He sang not to perform, but to remember, to preserve the self he had buried beneath doubt. <words>281</words>  
The voicemails faded, their purpose fulfilled, and the cloak slipped from his shoulders like mist. <words>294</words>  
He stepped from the center of the hall, lighter, unshackled, the prism still glowing behind him. <words>307</words>  
Outside, the night remained dreamless, but within him, a new story had begun to bloom. <words>320</words>  
He would carry it forward, not as a bard, but as a man who had finally heard himself. <words>335</words>  
And in that crisp languor, he found the first true note of freedom. <words>345</words>
