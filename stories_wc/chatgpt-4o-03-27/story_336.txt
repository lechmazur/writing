The hush after a car backfired in the silent street lingered like a held breath, and in that pause, Daryush the undertaker stepped through the brass-inlaid gates of the reimagined Persian palace. <words>28</words>  
He moved with the slow certainty of someone who had buried more kings than he had counted years, his eyes dulled by time but still searching. <words>47</words>  
The palace, once a marvel of sapphire domes and mirrored halls, now stood hollow, its grandeur faded into a memory only the walls dared whisper. <words>66</words>  
Daryush had come not for the dead, but for the living memory locked within the astronomical clock that crowned the central tower. <words>84</words>  
The clock, forged by artisans who followed sun paths to chart time, was said to imprison the last breath of the empire’s wisdom. <words>103</words>  
That wisdom—tribal knowledge passed from stargazers to stonecutters—was rarely practical, yet it held the secret to surviving the dark that had swallowed the world. <words>123</words>  
He climbed the spiral stairs, each step echoing like a drumbeat in the silence, his fingers brushing faded mosaics that once told stories of fire and stars. <words>144</words>  
At the summit, the clock loomed, its gears frozen, its face cracked, yet its golden hands still pointed to a time that had not yet come. <words>165</words>  
Daryush reached into his satchel and withdrew a shard of obsidian etched with sun paths, the last relic of his tribe’s forgotten astronomers. <words>183</words>  
He pressed it into the clock’s heart, and the mechanism groaned awake, grinding centuries into motion with a sound like bones shifting in a grave. <words>203</words>  
The gears turned, aligning with the sun’s imagined arc, and a compartment opened, revealing a scroll wrapped in silk the color of twilight. <words>221</words>  
He unrolled it with reverence, eyes scanning the script that danced like flame—formulas, myths, and a map to light buried beneath the palace. <words>240</words>  
Hope, he realized, was not a feeling but a direction—one that could be followed even in absolute dark, if one knew the stars. <words>258</words>  
He descended, scroll in hand, his steps quicker now, the weight of centuries lifting as he moved toward the chamber beneath the throne room. <words>277</words>  
There, he found the prison—not of stone, but of shadow—where the last ember of the empire’s soul flickered behind a lattice of forgotten names. <words>297</words>  
By aligning the scroll’s map with the sun paths etched into the floor, he unlocked the chamber, and light spilled forth like a long-held breath. <words>317</words>  
The light did not blind but revealed—walls inscribed with truths too deep for speech, warmth that remembered every hand that had once built this place. <words>336</words>  
Daryush knelt, not in worship but in gratitude, for he had not come to bury the past, but to awaken its promise. <words>353</words>  
In the placid ferocity of that moment, he understood: even the weary can carry fire, if they walk by the stars and not by sight. <words>373</words>  
And so he stayed, not as undertaker, but as keeper, guarding the light that could not be imprisoned, only remembered and passed on. <words>391</words>
