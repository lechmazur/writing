The hanging orchard in the ravine had once been a place of sweet cider and children’s laughter, but now it sagged under the weight of storms and secrets. <words>25</words> 

Elias, a conscientious objector turned reluctant scout, trudged through the mud with a map case slung over his shoulder and a rusty nail clenched between his teeth. <words>49</words> 

He claimed the nail was a charm, passed down through generations during the family’s All Souls’ Day tradition of burying iron to ward off wandering spirits. <words>70</words> 

The orchard’s trees, twisted and half-dead, hung low like mourners, their fruit rotting in clusters that buzzed with flies and whispered with wind. <words>91</words> 

Elias had volunteered for the neighborhood watch not out of duty, but because he was valiantly bored—too principled to fight, too restless to sit idle. <words>114</words> 

The watch had evolved during the craft fairs, when strangers flooded the ravine to peddle wares and stories, and sometimes, vanish without a trace. <words>135</words> 

Elias’s true mission, however, was to map the migration routes of the stormbirds—creatures that only appeared during the fairs, their wings slicing through thunderclouds. <words>157</words> 

He believed they carried messages, or perhaps memories, and he tracked them with the same reverence his grandfather once reserved for saints. <words>176</words> 

Each evening, he hosted a xenial gathering beneath the orchard’s largest tree, offering cider and bread to travelers in exchange for tales of the skies. <words>198</words> 

He listened with a coy malevolence, smiling too long, asking too little, letting silence stretch until truths slipped out like seeds from overripe fruit. <words>220</words> 

One night, a woman with stormbird feathers braided into her hair arrived, her eyes sharp as frost and her voice like distant thunder. <words>240</words> 

She spoke of a route that curved through lightning and memory, a path only visible to those who had refused to kill. <words>258</words> 

Elias offered her cider, and she handed him a feather soaked in rainwater and ink, a map etched in veins and whispers. <words>278</words> 

He pressed the rusty nail into the tree’s bark, marking the moment, the tradition, the turning. <words>289</words> 

The orchard groaned, and the wind shifted, carrying the scent of ozone and old regrets. <words>301</words> 

From the ravine’s edge, the stormbirds rose, their wings catching moonlight, their cries echoing like hymns. <words>317</words> 

Elias followed, his boots sinking into the wet earth, his map fluttering like a heartbeat in his hand. <words>335</words> 

Behind him, the neighborhood watch lit lanterns, unaware they were guarding a place already lost to sky and story. <words>353</words> 

The orchard, battered but listening, waited for the next fair, the next tale, the next soul to walk its crooked path. <words>373</words> 

And somewhere above, the stormbirds circled, drawing lines across the clouds that only Elias could read. <words>388</words> 

He smiled, the rusty nail warm in his pocket, and vanished into the wind. <words>400</words>
