On a floating tea platform adrift above the clouds, Marcellus Vane adjusted his velvet lapels and surveyed the horizon with grandiose modesty. <words>21</words>  
He was a soul-broker real estate agent, specializing in properties that existed between lifetimes, and today’s client was particularly elusive. <words>39</words>  
The platform creaked weirdly static beneath his polished boots, unmoved by the wind or time, as if tethered to a forgotten rhythm. <words>56</words>  
Marcellus reached beneath the tea table and retrieved a dusty wine bottle, its label reversed and barely legible through the grime of centuries. <words>75</words>  
He had learned long ago that reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles revealed truths not meant for the forward-facing world. <words>92</words>  
Today, he sought a song—one lost during the last recycling of the world, when memories were composted into dreams. <words>108</words>  
The client, a translucent figure named Elira, shimmered into view, her voice a chord of wind chimes and regret. <words>123</words>  
“I want a place where forgotten songs echo,” she said, her eyes reflecting constellations that no longer existed. <words>137</words>  
Marcellus bowed slightly, choreographing his gestures with the precision of a maestro conducting silence. <words>149</words>  
“Then you’ll need a property that remembers,” he replied, uncorking the bottle and inhaling the scent of old lullabies. <words>164</words>  
He poured the invisible wine into two cups, the liquid humming softly as it settled, vibrating with unsung verses. <words>178</words>  
Elira sipped, and her form grew more defined, as if the song within the wine was stitching her back together. <words>193</words>  
Marcellus began his pitch, weaving the art of persuasion into every syllable, each word a note in a melody only she could hear. <words>210</words>  
“The property floats between the third and fourth recycling,” he said, “where echoes of ancient choirs still haunt the rafters.” <words>225</words>  
He gestured, and the tea platform shifted, revealing a vision of a house built from harp strings and forgotten verses. <words>240</words>  
Elira gasped, her translucent hands reaching toward the vision, her longing as palpable as thunder. <words>252</words>  
“But it requires a key,” Marcellus said, holding up another dusty bottle, this one labeled in a language that danced backward. <words>268</words>  
He read it aloud in reverse, and the air around them shimmered with the chorus of a thousand lost lullabies. <words>283</words>  
Elira wept, her tears forming pearls that hovered midair, each one a note from a song she once sang. <words>297</words>  
“I remember now,” she whispered, “the song of my first breath.” <words>305</words>  
Marcellus smiled, modest in his triumph, for he had not sold a house—he had restored a soul’s melody. <words>319</words>  
The platform began to descend, slowly, as if bowing to the gravity of memory. <words>330</words>  
Elira stepped into the vision, now solid, her new home echoing with the music of her rediscovered self. <words>344</words>  
Marcellus remained behind, sipping the last of the wine, already scanning the reversed labels for his next forgotten song. <words>359</words>  
For him, the art of persuasion was not about convincing—it was about remembering what the world had chosen to forget. <words>375</words>  
And as the platform floated onward through the endless recycling, he smiled, humming a tune no one else remembered. <words>389</words>
