In the hush of a grocery store at midnight, where the fluorescent lights hummed like forgotten lullabies, a kindly guard named Elric stood watch beside the frozen peas. <words>27</words>  
He wasn’t guarding the food, not really—he was guarding the soft edges of time, which pooled like mist between the cereal aisle and the bakery. <words>50</words>  
Elric had once been a soldier of the sky, stationed on a floating island cloud café where the air smelled of cinnamon steam and regret. <words>72</words>  
There, he had learned the art of being loyally disloyal—serving the café’s enigmatic patrons while secretly dreaming of the horizon’s hidden promise. <words>95</words>  
Each morning, he stirred their drinks with a basic measuring spoon, its handle worn smooth by years of quiet rebellion. <words>111</words>  
The spoon had belonged to his mother, who had whispered stories of time’s soft edges while baking bread that never rose. <words>129</words>  
Now, in the grocery store’s midnight silence, Elric worshipped those memories with the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys—click, pause, click, like prayer. <words>151</words>  
He tapped his fingers on the cart handle, composing invisible letters to the sky, to the café, to the promise he had never seized. <words>174</words>  
The store was empty, save for the ghosts of shoppers who once debated brands of soup with the gravity of philosophers. <words>193</words>  
Elric wandered past the dairy section, where the air was colder than the cloud café’s highest terrace, and paused before a display of honey. <words>216</words>  
He remembered a woman with honey-colored eyes who had once asked him, “Do you believe in the future, or just in escape?” <words>239</words>  
He hadn’t answered then, but now, with the spoon in his pocket and the hush around him, he whispered, “Both.” <words>257</words>  
The soft edges of time curled around his ankles like fog, and he stepped through them, aisle to aisle, as if walking between worlds. <words>280</words>  
Each product on the shelf shimmered with potential—canned peaches, paper towels, a box of tea that promised clarity. <words>296</words>  
He picked up the tea and held it to his chest, as if it might unlock the horizon’s secret if steeped long enough. <words>316</words>  
Outside, the parking lot was a sea of sodium light and silence, and Elric knew the café still floated somewhere above it all. <words>338</words>  
He had left it behind to find something real, but reality had proved more vaporous than steam rising from a porcelain cup. <words>359</words>  
Still, he guarded the store not for duty, but for the chance that time might soften again, and let him slip through. <words>380</words>  
He walked back to the entrance, the spoon warm in his hand, and tapped it against the doorframe—click, pause, click. <words>399</words>  
The rhythm echoed like a promise, and in that moment, Elric believed the horizon might finally turn its face toward him. <words>419</words>  
He smiled, a frothy despair curling at the corners of his lips, and whispered, “I’m still here.” <words>433</words>  
And somewhere above, in the cloud café’s kitchen, a kettle began to boil. <words>444</words>
