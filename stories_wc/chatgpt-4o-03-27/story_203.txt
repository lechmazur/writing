The exorcist hovered in the orbital debris, her breath shallow, her hands trembling as she assembled a toy giraffe from salvaged plastic. <words>21</words> She had never been usual, not even before the inheritance—an inheritance not of wealth, but of lies, layered like sediment in her bloodline. <words>42</words> Her grandmother, a famed medium, had whispered secrets into her ear as a child, secrets that now echoed louder than the silence of space. <words>63</words> Each toy she built was a ritual, a ward, a way to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” from the wreckage of truth denied. <words>84</words> She paused, fingers brushing a packet of pressed wildflowers sealed in resin, a relic from Earth, a reminder of the garden her mother never tended. <words>105</words> The flowers were brittle, but their colors still defied the void, much like her own resolve, fragile yet unyielding. <words>120</words> She had stage fright, a cruel irony for someone who banished spirits—her voice faltered when it mattered most, when the dead demanded theater. <words>141</words> But here, amid the floating bones of satellites and forgotten missions, there was no audience, only ghosts and the sound of a key turning in a lock. <words>166</words> That sound came now, metallic and final, as the hatch behind her sealed, submerging her in the chamber where the truth waited. <words>185</words> The chamber was a vault of ancestral recordings, each confession encoded in static, each lie preserved like a sacred hymn. <words>202</words> She activated the first file, her grandfather’s voice crackling through the speakers, admitting he’d faked the possession that made their family famous. <words>223</words> Her knees buckled, but she didn’t fall; she floated, tethered only by the weight of revelation. <words>237</words> One by one, the voices played—her aunt’s staged hauntings, her father’s doctored footage, her mother’s silence. <words>252</words> The inheritance was a theater of shadows, and she its reluctant understudy, trained to perform but never believe. <words>267</words> Yet belief had found her anyway, in the quiet moments between toy parts clicking together, in the defiant hush of her own heartbeat. <words>288</words> She reached for the pressed wildflowers again, pressing them to the vault’s scanner, unlocking a final message hidden in their veins. <words>307</words> Her grandmother’s voice, soft and certain: “Lies are only prisons if you stop building.” <words>317</words> The exorcist smiled, stage fright and all, and began assembling a new toy—a phoenix, wings outstretched, rising from the debris. <words>336</words> She would not perform the past; she would rewrite it, one piece at a time, in orbit, in silence, in truth. <words>353</words> The ghosts watched, not to haunt, but to learn, as she sculpted a future from the wreckage of their deceit. <words>370</words> And in that defiant hush, she found her voice—not loud, but real, not usual, but hers. <words>384</words> The key had turned, the lock had opened, and she had submerged not into fear, but into freedom. <words>401</words> Amid toy assembly and orbital debris, she became not the heir of lies, but the architect of possibility. <words>417</words> The exorcist, never usual, had finally exorcised the past. <words>425</words>
