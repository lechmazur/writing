The town-weary traveler arrived at the edge of the coast just as the sun dipped behind the cliffs, casting long shadows over the abandoned carnival house of mirrors. <words>23</words>  
He had walked for days, driven by a need to escape the confines of his mind, which had grown too loud with memories and regrets. <words>45</words>  
The carnival loomed like a forgotten god, its rusted rides and broken booths whispering secrets only the wind could understand. <words>63</words>  
A metal sign above the entrance swung in the coastal wind, tapping rhythmically against its frame, as if knocking on the door of something buried. <words>87</words>  
He stepped inside, boots crunching on shattered glass and old popcorn, the air thick with the scent of salt and rust. <words>106</words>  
Mirrors lined the walls in warped rows, reflecting versions of himself he didn’t recognize—taller, thinner, smiling, crying. <words>123</words>  
In the center of the room stood a stained glass panel, its colors dulled by time but still catching the last light like a dying ember. <words>145</words>  
He approached it, drawn by something he couldn’t name, and saw within its fractured hues a scene: a cradle of sparks suspended in a void. <words>170</words>  
The image pulsed faintly, as if alive, and he reached out, fingers trembling, brushing the glass with the reverence of someone touching a wound. <words>193</words>  
Suddenly, the tapping of the metal sign intensified, each clang echoing through the mirrors, vibrating the air like a heartbeat. <words>212</words>  
The stained glass shimmered, and from its center, sparks began to fall—tiny, glowing seeds that drifted down and vanished into the floor. <words>234</words>  
He realized then that the cradle of sparks was not just an image, but a method—an intentionally accidental way to fertilize forgotten places with possibility. <words>260</words>  
The mirrors began to ripple, their surfaces no longer reflecting him but showing moments he had buried: a hand held too briefly, a goodbye never said. <words>286</words>  
He dropped to his knees, overwhelmed, the hush of the room pressing in like a held breath before someone finally says, “I love you.” <words>309</words>  
Tears came, not from sadness, but from the release of something long clenched, as if the carnival itself had exhaled through him. <words>330</words>  
The stained glass panel cracked, not from damage, but from completion, its purpose fulfilled in the quiet redemption of a broken man. <words>351</words>  
He stood, lighter somehow, and walked back through the mirrors, each step echoing with the sound of the tapping sign, now softer, almost grateful. <words>373</words>  
Outside, the wind had calmed, and the sky was a cradle of stars, each one a spark waiting to be born. <words>391</words>  
He smiled, not because he was healed, but because he had finally begun. <words>402</words>
