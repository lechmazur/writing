The elevator dinged hollowly as its doors slid open to reveal an empty floor, the sound echoing like a sigh through the subterranean cathedral. <words>23</words>  
Inside the cavern, phosphorescent flora pulsed with a dim, bioluminescent rhythm, casting eerie shadows across the stone walls like a heartbeat in slow motion. <words>45</words>  
At the center of this living cathedral sat an astute hermit named Elgar, cross-legged on a mossy slab, sharpening a pair of blunt scissors with a rock. <words>70</words>  
The scissors had never cut anything cleanly, but Elgar insisted they were strangely effective for tasks no one else could define. <words>89</words>  
He sniffed the air suddenly, nostrils flaring—there it was again, the scent of a fresh loaf of bread wafting impossibly through the damp air. <words>111</words>  
It wasn’t real bread, of course, but a chemical compound he’d engineered to amplify memory and lure forgotten instincts from the brain’s dusty corners. <words>135</words>  
Isolation had taught Elgar many things, including how to manipulate the senses to simulate companionship, purpose, and even hope. <words>153</words>  
He stood, bones creaking like old hinges, and shuffled toward a rusted control panel embedded in the cathedral wall. <words>171</words>  
The panel controlled the ancient water systems that once nourished the underground city above, now dry and crumbling like stale crust. <words>191</words>  
Elgar’s motivation was simple: restore the water systems and maybe, just maybe, the city would remember it had once been alive. <words>212</words>  
He inserted the blunt scissors into a makeshift keyhole—an act that should’ve been futile, yet somehow, strangely, it worked. <words>231</words>  
The panel lit up with a flicker, coughing sparks like a smoker trying to quit, and Elgar chuckled with despairing humor. <words>250</words>  
“Of course,” he muttered, “nothing like a pair of useless scissors to fix a civilization.” <words>263</words>  
The scent of bread intensified, a signal that the memory amplification was working—he could almost hear laughter from a long-dead bakery. <words>285</words>  
He closed his eyes and let the illusion wash over him: children chasing pigeons, water fountains gurgling, the clatter of cups in cafés. <words>308</words>  
But when he opened them, only the glowing flora remained, swaying gently as if mourning the absence of wind. <words>326</words>  
Still, the control panel now hummed, and a distant gurgle echoed through the cathedral’s stone veins. <words>342</words>  
Water was moving—slowly, hesitantly—like a forgotten song remembered in fragments. <words>355</words>  
Elgar limped to a nearby basin and watched as a single drop fell, then another, until a thin stream trickled forth. <words>377</words>  
He laughed again, this time with something like joy, though it was tinged with the bitterness of knowing no one else would see it. <words>401</words>  
The elevator dinged once more, still empty, still waiting, as if expecting someone who’d never arrive. <words>417</words>  
Elgar raised the scissors in salute, their dull blades catching the glow of the flora like a knight’s broken sword. <words>437</words>  
“Here’s to isolation,” he said, “the mother of madness and miracles.” <words>448</words>  
And with that, he returned to his slab, the scent of bread lingering like a ghost in the air. <words>467</words>  
The water flowed, the flora pulsed, and the cathedral breathed on, alive in its loneliness. <words>484</words>
