The neon-lit desert buzzed like a dying fly, its maze of billboards flickering with promises no one believed anymore. <words>20</words>  
At the center of this electric mirage sat Vex, a mildly panicked soothsayer with a cracked voice and a cracked worldview. <words>38</words>  
He hunched over a battered wooden bar top, reading the water rings like ancient runes, trying to magnify the future from condensation. <words>56</words>  
"Probably unlikely," he muttered, squinting at a particularly stubborn ring that refused to reveal anything but his own failure. <words>70</words>  
The bartender, a cactus in a Hawaiian shirt named Thorn, grunted without looking up. <words>80</words>  
Vex pulled the pocket puzzle box from his coat—a cursed thing with 13 locks and no instructions. <words>96</words>  
Each lock represented a choice, a consequence, or a lie he’d told himself during the lost years. <words>110</words>  
He turned it over in his hands, fingers trembling, not from fear but from the weight of maybe. <words>124</words>  
Destiny wasn’t supposed to be this heavy, but then again, shaping it with bare hands never came with a manual. <words>140</words>  
The desert outside pulsed with heat and sarcasm, as if the land itself mocked his every prophetic twitch. <words>154</words>  
Billboards screamed slogans like “Drink Dust, It’s Organic!” and “Recycle Your Regrets—Now With Bonus Guilt!” <words>168</words>  
Vex had once believed in omens, but now he believed in entropy and the occasional miracle disguised as trash. <words>182</words>  
He twisted the first lock open, a soft click echoing like a gunshot in the silence of his doubt. <words>196</words>  
The second lock required a whisper, the third a memory, the fourth a promise he hadn’t kept. <words>210</words>  
By the seventh, he was sweating irony and bleeding metaphors, but the box began to hum with purpose. <words>224</words>  
Outside, the wind shifted, carrying the scent of ozone and old forests that hadn’t existed in decades. <words>238</words>  
He paused, reading the new water ring forming beneath his glass—an unbroken circle, rare and probably unlikely. <words>252</words>  
Thorn raised a brow. “You gonna save the world or just flirt with it?” <words>262</words>  
Vex smirked, sarcasm molten in his throat. “Depends if the world buys me a drink first.” <words>276</words>  
The twelfth lock opened with a sigh, the thirteenth with a laugh that wasn’t his. <words>288</words>  
Inside the box: a seed, glowing faintly, pulsing with the rhythm of forgotten rain. <words>300</words>  
He held it up, and the billboards dimmed, as if the desert itself leaned in to listen. <words>314</words>  
“Time to plant something that matters,” he said, voice steadier than it had been in years. <words>328</words>  
He stepped outside, the seed warm in his palm, and dug into the cracked earth with bare hands. <words>342</words>  
The wind howled approval, or maybe just laughed, but either way, the sky blinked a little bluer. <words>356</words>  
Vex didn’t know if it would grow, but he knew it had to be tried. <words>368</words>  
Because even in a neon desert of lies, stewardship wasn’t optional—it was the only real prophecy left. <words>382</words>  
And for once, probably unlikely felt like the best odds he’d ever had. <words>393</words>
