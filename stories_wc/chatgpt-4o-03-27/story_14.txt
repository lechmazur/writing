The tidal power monitoring station at the edge of the bay was never meant to host candlelit dinners, but that didn’t stop Felix from setting the table each night with a chipped plate, a bent fork, and a rustic candle mold he’d found buried beneath the supply shed. <words>38</words>  
He wasn’t a scientist, not really—just a naive gambler who’d lost everything in a game of “Tide or No Tide” and had been docked here as part of a community restitution program. <words>72</words>  
The station’s only other occupant, Professor Larkspur, was a wiry man with wild eyes and a penchant for rebellious midnight lectures that spiraled into rants about entropy, love, and the unspoken bargains we make with time. <words>112</words>  
Felix didn’t understand half of what the professor said, but he listened anyway, drawn in by the man’s rarely predictable logic and the way his voice cracked when he spoke of lost chances. <words>148</words>  
Each night, as the tide surged and the turbines hummed like distant whales, Felix lit the candle and imagined he was dining with someone who remembered his name before he’d bet it away. <words>184</words>  
The candle mold, rough and pitted, had once belonged to the station’s original keeper, a woman who’d vanished without a trace, leaving behind only wax drippings and a journal filled with equations and poetry. <words>224</words>  
Felix read the journal in secret, tracing her words with trembling fingers, feeling as though he were trespassing on a sacred pact between her and the sea. <words>256</words>  
He began to suspect that the station itself was built on unspoken bargains—between man and nature, between light and dark, between staying and leaving. <words>284</words>  
One night, during a particularly violent tide, the professor burst into the dining room, soaked and laughing, clutching a soaked blueprint and shouting, “We’ve done it! We’ve captured the last spark before oblivion!” <words>324</words>  
Felix didn’t know what he meant, but he laughed too, tears streaming down his face, because for once, the chaos made sense. <words>352</words>  
They docked the blueprint to the station’s mainframe, and the turbines pulsed with a rhythm that felt almost human, as if the sea itself had agreed to their terms. <words>386</words>  
In that moment, Felix understood that his losses had led him here not by chance, but by a rarely predictable design that only revealed itself in candlelight and madness. <words>424</words>  
He reached across the table, touched the mold, and whispered a thank-you to the woman who had once dared to dream in wax and waves. <words>456</words>  
Outside, the tide receded, leaving behind a silence so complete it felt like a promise kept. <words>475</words>  
And for the first time, Felix didn’t feel like he was gambling—he felt like he’d finally won. <words>494</words>
