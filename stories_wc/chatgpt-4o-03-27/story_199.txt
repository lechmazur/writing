After the last human dream was dreamt, the world didn’t end—it simply forgot how to remember. <words>1</words>  
In the heart of the city, where a repurposed highway overpass had become an urban orchard, Ranger Elka patrolled with a fervor that bordered on religious. <words>2</words>  
She wore her uniform like armor, her boots crunching over fallen apricot pits and windblown petals, eyes scanning for violations that no longer mattered. <words>3</words>  
The orchard was a tangle of chaotic organization—rows of fig trees beside wild strawberries, grapevines climbing rusted guardrails, bees nesting in old traffic cameras. <words>4</words>  
Elka’s mission, however, was not to protect the fruit, but to catch the echo of a goddess her grandmother once whispered about. <words>5</words>  
Her grandmother, a woman with eyes like stormclouds and a voice that fluctuated between lullaby and warning, had left behind a plain notebook. <words>6</words>  
The notebook was filled with sketches of unfamiliar constellations, recipes for forgotten herbs, and riddles that made Elka’s teeth ache. <words>7</words>  
Each page hinted at a presence that was familiarly unknown—something Elka felt in her bones but could never name. <words>8</words>  
She believed the goddess had once walked this orchard when it was still asphalt and exhaust, leaving behind echoes in the soil. <words>9</words>  
Through chance encounters with vagrants, dreamless children, and pigeons that spoke in Morse code, Elka pieced together a map of divine residue. <words>10</words>  
One morning, while chasing a squirrel that had stolen her compass, she stumbled upon a woman humming beneath a cherry tree. <words>11</words>  
The woman wore a coat stitched from parking tickets and smelled of ozone and cinnamon. <words>12</words>  
Elka demanded identification, but the woman only smiled and handed her a plum. <words>13</words>  
The fruit pulsed in Elka’s hand, and for a moment, she heard her grandmother’s voice reciting a lullaby in reverse. <words>14</words>  
The woman vanished, leaving behind a single feather shaped like a question mark. <words>15</words>  
Elka recorded the encounter in the notebook, her handwriting fluctuating between her own and her grandmother’s. <words>16</words>  
She began to notice patterns in the orchard’s chaos—how the apples ripened in Fibonacci spirals, how the wind carried syllables. <words>17</words>  
Each fluctuation in the environment felt like a breath from something vast and sleeping. <words>18</words>  
She stopped issuing citations and started planting seeds in the shape of ancient runes. <words>19</words>  
The city above forgot the orchard existed, but Elka knew it was becoming a temple. <words>20</words>  
One night, beneath a blood-orange moon, she found a door carved into the bark of a pear tree. <words>21</words>  
Inside was a room filled with mirrors that reflected not her face, but her grandmother’s memories. <words>22</words>  
She saw the goddess—tall, laughing, her eyes like galaxies collapsing inward. <words>23</words>  
The goddess whispered, “You are the echo,” and Elka finally understood her purpose. <words>24</words>  
She left the orchard that night, notebook in hand, to become a chance encounter for someone else. <words>25</words>  
And in her absence, the trees began to hum. <words>26</words>
