The city’s lights flickered and died, plunging the skyline into a trembling hush as if the buildings themselves held their breath. <words>20</words> 

From the top of the moth observation tower, Elian knelt, his breath fogging the glass as he watched the darkness ripple below. <words>36</words> 

He was a scout, fiercely loyal to the Order of the Inner Lantern, sworn to protect its secrets even from himself. <words>50</words> 

In his gloved hands, he held a bullet journal with a leather cover engraved with the sigil of a spiraling storm. <words>66</words> 

Each page inside was filled with coded nonsense—jokes, puns, and absurd routines that only the initiated could decipher. <words>78</words> 

The Order had long used comedy as camouflage, embedding radical teachings in laughter to avoid detection. <words>89</words> 

Elian flipped to a page marked with a doodle of a moth wearing sunglasses and read aloud, “Why did the guru refuse the umbrella? Because he preferred to weather inside storms.” <words>111</words> 

He chuckled, but the sanctified dread in his chest deepened—he was close to understanding. <words>121</words> 

The city’s outage wasn’t random; it was the signal, the moment when the veil thinned and the real training began. <words>134</words> 

He had come to the tower not to observe moths, but to balance the storm within himself. <words>146</words> 

Meditation, the Order taught, wasn’t about peace—it was about holding chaos without letting it spill. <words>157</words> 

Elian had always been individually common—average in skill, unremarkable in appearance—but his loyalty made him dangerous. <words>169</words> 

The Order needed someone like him to carry the teachings forward without drawing suspicion. <words>180</words> 

He closed his eyes and breathed in the scent of dust, ozone, and moth wings. <words>191</words> 

Below, the city murmured in confusion, its people lighting candles, their shadows dancing like ancient spirits. <words>203</words> 

Elian began to recite another coded joke, this one about a monk, a toaster, and a hurricane. <words>215</words> 

Each line was a mantra, each punchline a key to unlocking deeper awareness. <words>225</words> 

He felt the storm inside him rise—memories, fears, doubts—but he did not flinch. <words>236</words> 

Instead, he welcomed them, letting them swirl like moths around a flame. <words>246</words> 

The engraved cover of his journal grew warm in his hands, as if affirming his path. <words>258</words> 

He had been radicalized not by anger, but by absurdity, by the sacred nonsense that revealed truth. <words>270</words> 

The tower creaked as wind pressed against its frame, and Elian stood, steady as a lighthouse. <words>282</words> 

He was ready to descend, to walk among the flickering lights and teach others to balance their storms. <words>295</words> 

Not with silence, but with laughter that hid fire, with jokes that opened doors. <words>305</words> 

The city would not know it was changing until it already had. <words>314</words> 

And Elian, the scout with the storm-engraved journal, would be its quiet catalyst. <words>325</words> 

He stepped away from the window, the moths fluttering behind him like blessings. <words>336</words> 

Outside, the first lights blinked back on, but Elian knew the real illumination had just begun. <words>349</words> 

He tucked the journal into his coat and whispered, “Let the nonsense begin.” <words>359</words> 

Then he vanished into the stairwell, carrying the storm with him, balanced and burning. <words>370</words>
