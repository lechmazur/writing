The orchard fence surrendered to rust slowly, its iron bones flaking into the wind like forgotten promises. <words>17</words>  
Beyond it, in a time-dilated zone where minutes stretched like taffy and hours folded in on themselves, Elian waited. <words>35</words>  
He crouched beside a gnarled tree, its fruit petrified mid-ripening, and held a centuries-old coin between his fingers. <words>50</words>  
The coin bore faint indentations—almost imperceptible—but Elian had learned to read them like braille for the soul. <words>64</words>  
Each groove whispered a pattern, a rhythm of time’s breath, and he listened with the reverence of a monk. <words>78</words>  
His whispering advisor, a translucent figure named Cael, hovered nearby, voice like wind through reeds. <words>90</words>  
“You’re close,” Cael murmured, “but empathy must rise before the pattern reveals itself.” <words>100</words>  
Elian frowned, brushing his thumb over the coin again, feeling the oddly comforting warmth it emitted despite the chill. <words>114</words>  
He had come here not to manipulate time, but to understand its patterns—to honor its flow, not bend it. <words>129</words>  
The orchard had once belonged to his ancestors, who planted trees in sync with lunar pulses and solar sighs. <words>143</words>  
Now, the trees stood frozen in a moment stretched thin, their shadows unmoving, their stories paused. <words>155</words>  
Elian reached into his satchel and pulled out a piece of driftwood, smooth and pale like bone. <words>168</words>  
It had washed ashore near the ruins of the old observatory, where time first began to fracture. <words>181</words>  
Cael had told him the driftwood was a key, not to unlock, but to attune. <words>193</words>  
He placed it beside the coin, aligning the grain of the wood with the coin’s indentations. <words>206</words>  
A hum rose from the earth, low and resonant, vibrating through his bones like ancestral memory. <words>219</words>  
Elian closed his eyes, and in the darkness, he saw moments not his own—his great-grandmother planting the first tree. <words>234</words>  
He saw a child laughing in a future orchard, where the fence had crumbled and time flowed freely. <words>247</words>  
Tears welled in his eyes, not from sorrow, but from a rising empathy that connected him to all who had come and would come. <words>266</words>  
The coin grew warmer, the indentations deepening slightly, as if acknowledging his understanding. <words>277</words>  
Cael’s whisper softened further, “You’ve honored the pattern, Elian. Now, time will speak to you.” <words>289</words>  
The orchard shimmered, its frozen fruit ripening in slow motion, the rusted fence sighing as if relieved. <words>302</words>  
Elian stood, the driftwood in one hand, the coin in the other, and felt the pulse of time within him. <words>316</words>  
He no longer needed to control it; he had become part of its rhythm, its memory, its future. <words>329</words>  
The time-dilated zone began to contract, folding gently around him like a closing flower at dusk. <words>341</words>  
As he stepped beyond the orchard, the whispering advisor faded, his purpose fulfilled. <words>352</words>  
Elian looked back once, honoring the rust, the trees, the driftwood, and the coin that had taught him to feel. <words>367</words>  
In the distance, the orchard breathed again, and time, at last, exhaled. <words>376</words>
