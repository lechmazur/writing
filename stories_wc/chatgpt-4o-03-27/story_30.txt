The navigation room of the pirate ship *Verdant Wager* pulsed with dim starlight and the scent of scorched copper, a sacred disorder of blinking consoles and whispered secrets. <words>26</words>  
Cassian Vale, high-stakes gambler and last heir of the Arbor Lineage, hovered his telekinetic dice above a cracked star chart. <words>42</words>  
Each die shimmered with encoded glyphs—lost languages from Earth’s forgotten root tongues, languages once used to bless soil and summon rain. <words>58</words>  
He rolled them not for luck, but for alignment, seeking the right moment to act, as his ancestors had taught. <words>71</words>  
A fragment of medieval tapestry, stitched with dragons coiled around saplings, hung beside the nav-screen, its threads humming faintly with ancient resonance. <words>86</words>  
Cassian’s fingers brushed it reverently; it was the last relic from Earth’s final harvest temple, smuggled aboard generations ago. <words>99</words>  
He was philosophically practical—he believed in miracles only if they could be grown, rooted, and passed down. <words>111</words>  
The ship’s AI, named Myrrh, flickered to life with a low chime. <words>119</words>  
“Coordinates locked,” it said, “but the path is unstable—solar flares threaten the route.” <words>129</words>  
Cassian nodded, eyes narrowing. <words>132</words>  
“Then we flame through,” he said, igniting the thrusters with a gesture, the dice spinning wildly in zero-gravity. <words>145</words>  
The ship surged forward, slicing through plasma storms like a blade through silk, guided by the gambler’s will and ancestral math. <words>159</words>  
He wasn’t chasing treasure or vengeance—he sought the last fertile moon, where he could plant a tree for his newborn niece. <words>174</words>  
It was a family tradition older than any flag or frontier: one tree per soul, roots for remembrance. <words>186</words>  
The pirates didn’t understand, but they followed him, drawn by his certainty and the way the dice never lied. <words>199</words>  
In the quiet between stars, Cassian whispered to the tapestry, reciting a prayer in a language no longer spoken. <words>212</words>  
The dragons seemed to stir, threads glowing faintly, as if acknowledging his vow. <words>221</words>  
He remembered his grandmother’s hands planting a sapling in Martian soil, her voice trembling with hope and dust. <words>233</words>  
Now it was his turn to preserve the old farming methods, to keep the soil sacred even in exile. <words>246</words>  
The dice settled midair, showing the glyph for “arrival.” <words>252</words>  
Myrrh confirmed: “Moon in sight. Atmosphere viable. Soil untested.” <words>259</words>  
Cassian exhaled, unstrapping the seedling from its cryo-cradle. <words>266</words>  
He stepped onto the moon’s surface, boots sinking into loam that smelled faintly of Earth. <words>277</words>  
With care, he planted the tree, pressing the tapestry fragment into the soil beside it. <words>288</words>  
The dragons would guard it, he believed, and the lost languages would root again. <words>298</words>  
Above him, the stars flamed in silence, and the gambler smiled. <words>307</words>  
He had bet everything on this moment—and won. <words>313</words>  
Back aboard the *Verdant Wager*, the crew watched the moon bloom on their screens, awe softening their pirate edges. <words>327</words>  
Cassian returned, dirt under his nails, dice in his palm, and a new word forming in his mind—one no one had spoken in centuries. <words>345</words>  
He whispered it to the ship, to the stars, to the seedling. <words>353</words>  
It meant “begin.” <words>356</words>  
And so it did. <words>359</words>
