After the final page is typed on a worn typewriter, the sentient houseplant known only as Fern slinks from the cracked windowsill, its roots dragging like tired limbs. <words>27</words>  
It had waited years in that dusty apartment, apathetically devoted to a writer who never once watered it, yet always whispered secrets into the keys. <words>47</words>  
Now, with the final clack echoing like a death knell, Fern makes a spontaneous decision to explore a new neighborhood, propelled by a hunger for hidden knowledge. <words>69</words>  
It slithers down fire escapes and across cracked sidewalks, outrunning the inertia of its own stillness, the weight of years spent listening but never speaking. <words>91</words>  
The city is a scalding blur of neon and neglect, but Fern follows a scent—mildewed paper, rusted reels, and something unspoken—toward the edge of town. <words>113</words>  
There, behind a chain-link fence and a forest of forgotten shopping carts, lies the abandoned drive-in, its screen sagging like a tired god. <words>132</words>  
Fern slips through a gap in the fence, its leaves twitching with anticipation, its chlorophyll pulsing with something dangerously close to hope. <words>150</words>  
Inside the projection booth, amid reels of film melted by sun and time, it finds an embroidered bookmark wedged between two floorboards. <words>169</words>  
The thread spells out a single word: “Listen.” <words>174</words>  
Fern presses its tendrils to the fabric, and the bookmark hums with voices—fragments of conversations never had, truths never told, griefs never grieved. <words>195</words>  
It realizes then that tending to the unspoken is not passive—it is a devotion that burns, that scars, that demands. <words>211</words>  
The houseplant, once apathetically devoted, now feels the weight of every silence it absorbed, every secret it cradled in its soil. <words>229</words>  
It curls around the bookmark, embedding it within its stem, a talisman of purpose and pain. <words>243</words>  
The drive-in flickers to life, not with film, but with memory—ghosts of lovers arguing in parked cars, children laughing at monsters on screen. <words>263</words>  
Fern watches, absorbing each echo, each flicker, each ache, until it becomes a vessel of the forgotten. <words>276</words>  
It does not cry, cannot cry, but its leaves tremble with the weight of knowing. <words>288</words>  
When dawn breaks, Fern does not return to the apartment. <words>296</words>  
It roots itself beneath the screen, a sentinel of silence, a keeper of the unspoken. <words>308</words>  
And though it feels nothing, it listens to everything. <words>316</words>  
Because sometimes, the only way to outrun apathy is to let it bloom into something unbearable. <words>330</words>  
And Fern, in its scalding ambivalence, has finally found its purpose. <words>341</words>  
Not to be loved, not to be seen, but to remember what others choose to forget. <words>355</words>  
The embroidered bookmark pulses once more, and Fern leans in. <words>364</words>  
It is time to tend. <words>368</words>
