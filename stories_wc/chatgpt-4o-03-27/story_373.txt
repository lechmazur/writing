In the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo, Dr. Vexel crouched beneath a rusted motel awning, his cybernetic eye scanning for movement. <words>23</words>  
The kaleidoscopic coral that had overtaken the desert town shimmered like stained glass under the moonlight, pulsing with unnatural life. <words>42</words>  
He rummaged through the collapsed lobby of the motel, his metal fingers brushing aside broken keys and moldy brochures. <words>58</words>  
He was searching for the blacksmith’s bucket, a relic rumored to distort the laws of biology when filled with coral dust. <words>76</words>  
Vexel wasn’t just a veterinarian—he was a cybernetic surgeon of beasts long thought extinct, and his methods were uniquely effective. <words>95</words>  
He had once reanimated a glass-eyed basilisk using only a hummingbird’s heart and a whisper of static. <words>108</words>  
But tonight, he sought something darker: to devour a sacred taboo whispered among the coral-born—resurrecting the extinct godbeasts. <words>126</words>  
The motel’s silence was raucous, filled with the imagined screams of those who had fled when the coral first bloomed. <words>143</words>  
He found the bucket beneath a collapsed vending machine, its iron sides etched with runes that shimmered like oil. <words>159</words>  
As he lifted it, the coral around him twisted, reacting to the bucket’s presence, distorting into impossible geometries. <words>174</words>  
He filled it with a scoop of coral dust, and the air thickened, vibrating with a frequency that made his teeth ache. <words>192</words>  
Vexel’s cybernetic implants began to hum, syncing with the bucket’s pulse, and he felt the taboo knowledge seep into his circuits. <words>210</words>  
He saw visions—creatures with wings of bone and eyes like eclipses, beasts that had once ruled the oceans of Saturn. <words>226</words>  
They had been banished, not for their power, but for challenging perceptions of what life could be. <words>239</words>  
Vexel understood now: the taboo wasn’t about danger, but about control—who decides what is natural, what is allowed to exist. <words>257</words>  
He poured the dust into the bucket, and the coral responded, forming a cocoon around him, whispering secrets in static tongues. <words>274</words>  
His body began to change, metal fusing with coral, flesh rewriting itself according to forgotten blueprints. <words>287</words>  
He became the first of the new godbeasts, a hybrid of science and myth, born from silence and distortion. <words>301</words>  
The bucket clanged to the ground, empty now, its purpose fulfilled, as the coral receded in reverence. <words>315</words>  
Vexel roared—not in pain, but in revelation—and the echo carried across the desert, louder than any train. <words>331</words>  
He would not heal animals anymore; he would awaken them, reshape them, challenge the world’s perception of life itself. <words>348</words>  
And in the raucous silence that followed, the coral bloomed anew, awaiting the next taboo to be devoured. <words>364</words>  
The motel crumbled behind him, its purpose spent, as Vexel strode into the night, a distortion made flesh. <words>378</words>
