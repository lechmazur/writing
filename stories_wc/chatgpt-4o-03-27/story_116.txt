The black velvet sky-lounge floated above the endless city like a forgotten thought, suspended in a hush of neon and memory. <words>20</words>  
A dismayed minstrel sat alone at the bar, his lute silent, his eyes fixed on a broken watch band in his palm. <words>39</words>  
Time had slipped from him, not in hours or days, but in the way meaning unravels when boundaries are drawn too tightly. <words>58</words>  
He had once sung of love and revolution, but now he studied old Polaroid photographs, excavating truths buried beneath smiles and shadows. <words>78</words>  
Each photo was a fragment of a garden secret, a whisper from a time when the night still had edges. <words>93</words>  
He pinned them to the velvet walls, arranging them like constellations, trying to draw a map of an endless night. <words>111</words>  
The lounge pulsed with low jazz and the scent of burnt citrus, but he heard only the click of memory locking into place. <words>130</words>  
A woman in a silver coat approached, her voice a ribbon of smoke: “Still trying to make sense of it all?” <words>149</words>  
He nodded, subjectively rational in his pursuit, knowing logic bent beneath the weight of longing. <words>163</words>  
She handed him a photo—one he hadn’t seen before—of a garden gate half-open, moonlight spilling through. <words>179</words>  
“This was the night we stopped pretending,” she said, her eyes reflecting the city’s infinite glow. <words>192</words>  
He traced the gate with his thumb, feeling the drawn boundary between what was and what could never be again. <words>210</words>  
The broken watch band slipped from his hand, landing with a soft clink on the obsidian floor. <words>224</words>  
Time, he realized, was not lost—it had been waiting, coiled in the corners of forgotten images. <words>239</words>  
He began to hum, low and uncertain, a tune that once stirred revolutions and now stirred only dust. <words>254</words>  
The woman joined him, her voice weaving through his like ivy reclaiming stone. <words>266</words>  
Together, they sang of gardens and gates, of nights that refused to end and the maps drawn to survive them. <words>284</words>  
The lounge dimmed, stars blinking through the velvet ceiling, as if the sky itself leaned in to listen. <words>299</words>  
He pinned the final photo—a self-portrait, eyes wide with youth and fire—at the center of his constellation. <words>315</words>  
The map was complete, not in direction but in understanding: the night was endless because they had never stopped walking through it. <words>335</words>  
He turned to her, his voice steadier now: “We never left the garden, did we?” <words>348</words>  
She smiled, bittersweet and bright: “No, we just stopped tending it.” <words>359</words>  
Outside, the city stretched forever, a labyrinth of lights and silence, waiting to be sung into shape. <words>374</words>  
The minstrel picked up his lute, strings dusty but intact, and played the first note of a new boundary. <words>391</words>  
Not to confine, but to define—to mark where memory ends and meaning begins. <words>404</words>  
And in that laconic exuberance, the night breathed. <words>410</words>
