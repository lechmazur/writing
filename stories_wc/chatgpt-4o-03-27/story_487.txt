The drum solos echoed through the greenhouse labyrinth, each beat a pulse in the tangled veins of vines and glass. <words>20</words>  
Beneath the rhythmic thunder, Bruhn moved with disturbingly calm precision, his massive frame brushing past man-eating plants that hissed like boiling kettles. <words>42</words>  
He was a docile bruiser, a contradiction in boots, whose fists could crush skulls but whose heart beat to lullabies. <words>61</words>  
In his calloused hands, he held a conductor’s baton rumored to raise the dead, its silver tip glinting like a promise. <words>83</words>  
He hadn’t found it by chance—it had taken months of piecing together a shredded treasure map found under the floorboards of a collapsed opera house. <words>113</words>  
Each fragment had been a whisper in a language he didn’t speak, symbols that danced like ghosts across parchment. <words>132</words>  
Language barriers had always haunted Bruhn, who spoke only in grunts and gestures, his thoughts too large for words. <words>151</words>  
But he’d learned to listen with his bones, to feel meaning in the tremble of ink and the twist of silence. <words>174</words>  
Now, amid the cacophony of drums and the rustle of carnivorous leaves, he sought to mold a myth from the mud of reality. <words>200</words>  
The baton was his chisel, the greenhouse his marble, and the myth—his brother, lost in the war and buried without a name. <words>225</words>  
Bruhn had never cried, not even when the telegram came, just clenched his jaw and started digging—through dirt, through lies, through time. <words>250</words>  
He believed the baton could bring his brother back, not as a ghost, but as a truth too stubborn to stay dead. <words>273</words>  
The plants recoiled as he passed, sensing something older than hunger in his stride, something sacred and unyielding. <words>293</words>  
He reached the heart of the labyrinth, where a stone pedestal waited like a held breath, and placed the baton atop it. <words>317</words>  
The drums outside surged, a solo so fierce it cracked the glass above, letting moonlight spill like milk across the floor. <words>340</words>  
Bruhn raised his arms, not to fight, but to conduct, each motion a prayer in a language only the dead remembered. <words>362</words>  
The baton shimmered, twisted in his grip, and the air thickened with the scent of wet soil and old lullabies. <words>383</words>  
From the roots below, a figure emerged—mud-caked, silent, eyes wide with recognition and sorrow. <words>399</words>  
Bruhn stepped forward, his massive hands trembling as he reached out, not to crush, but to hold. <words>417</words>  
His brother’s lips moved, forming words Bruhn couldn’t understand, but the meaning was clear in the way he smiled. <words>439</words>  
They stood there, two myths made flesh, beneath the shattered glass and the watching plants, as the drums faded into silence. <words>464</words>  
And in that silence, Bruhn finally spoke—not with words, but with the brash tenderness of a man who had twisted fate itself. <words>491</words>
