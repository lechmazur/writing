The floating observatory creaked like an old ship as the lone trapper adjusted the dials on the spectral array, his fingers calloused from years of solitude. <words>23</words>  
He worked between shifts, when the stars blinked like tired eyes and the silence was so thick it became silently audible. <words>42</words>  
The trapper, known only as Rell, had once hunted aurora beasts across the polar stratospheres, but now he hunted something less tangible. <words>63</words>  
He sought to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt—a metaphysical phenomenon that had swallowed his brother during a failed expedition. <words>85</words>  
The observatory floated above the cloudline, tethered to nothing but Rell’s obsession and a rusted gyroscopic anchor. <words>100</words>  
He had found the piece of sea glass in his brother’s final transmission, embedded in a coded message hidden within microfilm from shady archives. <words>123</words>  
The microfilm had been buried in the ruins of the old Lunar Library, guarded by bureaucrats who spoke in riddles and wore mirrored masks. <words>145</words>  
Rell had decoded it by candlelight, each frame revealing fragments of a map, a formula, and a whisper of purpose. <words>164</words>  
The sea glass shimmered unnaturally, pulsing with a hue that didn’t exist in any known spectrum, as if it remembered something the universe had forgotten. <words>188</words>  
He kept it in a velvet pouch, close to his chest, where it warmed or chilled depending on his thoughts. <words>205</words>  
Tonight, it was warm—almost feverish—as if urging him to recommence the experiment he had abandoned after the last failure. <words>225</words>  
He hesitated, remembering the last time he tried to extract radiance: the observatory had nearly imploded, and his sanity had frayed like old rope. <words>248</words>  
But loss had taught him something—something sharp and necessary—that the upside of loss was clarity, a brutal kind of wisdom. <words>268</words>  
He powered up the siphon array, its coils humming with a sound that was both mechanical and mournful. <words>284</words>  
The black hole of doubt hovered in the distance, a void that bent light and memory alike, its edges flickering with forgotten truths. <words>306</words>  
Rell aligned the sea glass with the siphon’s core, watching as it refracted the void’s darkness into something almost beautiful. <words>324</words>  
The observatory groaned, its hull flexing as if resisting the pull of revelation, but Rell stood firm, eyes locked on the impossible. <words>344</words>  
He whispered his brother’s name, and the sea glass pulsed in reply, silently audible like a heartbeat in a dream. <words>362</words>  
The siphon engaged, drawing not light but understanding, not energy but acceptance, and Rell felt the weight in his chest begin to lift. <words>384</words>  
He saw now that loss wasn’t an end but a lens, and through it, he could finally see the shape of what remained. <words>406</words>  
The observatory steadied, the void dimmed, and Rell smiled—not because he had won, but because he had finally let go. <words>426</words>  
He placed the sea glass back in its pouch, its glow now soft and steady, like a lighthouse for the soul. <words>444</words>  
Outside, the stars resumed their blinking, and Rell recommenced his vigil, no longer hunting, but watching, and waiting with peace. <words>464</words>
