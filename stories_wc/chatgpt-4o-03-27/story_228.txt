The bunker was buried beneath a mountain, its corridors humming with secrets and fluorescent light. <words>17</words>  
Iris, an ambitious herbalist with dirt under her nails and fire in her chest, moved silently through its halls. <words>35</words>  
She had been recruited not for her loyalty, but for her knowledge of regeneration—how plants healed, how cells remembered. <words>52</words>  
The government wanted to weaponize growth, to twist nature’s resilience into something controllable. <words>63</words>  
But Iris had other plans, born from the relentless drumming of “not enough” that haunted her since childhood. <words>80</words>  
She remembered her mother’s hands, always trembling, always folding laundry with a plain wooden clothespin clenched between her teeth. <words>98</words>  
That clothespin now lived in Iris’s pocket, a dramatically simple totem of survival and silence. <words>111</words>  
The bunker’s air was stale, thick with the weight of unspoken experiments and dreams that had never taken flight. <words>128</words>  
Iris had studied the regeneration chamber for weeks, watching how it forced cells to obey, to grow unnaturally. <words>144</words>  
She knew the process was flawed—growth without purpose was just mutation. <words>153</words>  
One night, a sudden storm aboveground knocked out the satellite feeds and forced a change of route for the guards. <words>170</words>  
In the hush of redirected footsteps, Iris slipped into the chamber with a satchel of her own making. <words>185</words>  
Inside were herbs that whispered of balance, of healing not through force but through remembering what it meant to be whole. <words>204</words>  
She replaced the synthetic serum with her blend, fingers trembling as she clipped the clothespin to the control panel. <words>220</words>  
It was a signal to herself: this was the moment to break free from limitations, to choose creation over control. <words>237</words>  
The machine hummed, then stuttered, then pulsed with a new rhythm—one that felt like breath, like soil, like rain. <words>253</words>  
Cells began to regenerate not as weapons, but as gardens—each one remembering its purpose, its peace. <words>266</words>  
Alarms blared, but Iris didn’t run; she stood in the center of the chamber, arms open, eyes closed. <words>280</words>  
She felt the storm above echo within her, a hushed turbulence that no longer screamed “not enough.” <words>293</words>  
The guards found her hours later, surrounded by vines that had burst through concrete, reaching for light. <words>306</words>  
They didn’t understand what they saw, only that something had changed, something irreversible. <words>318</words>  
Iris smiled, the clothespin still clipped to the panel, a monument to simplicity and defiance. <words>331</words>  
She had not destroyed the machine; she had taught it to remember. <words>341</words>  
And in doing so, she had remembered herself—not as a tool, but as a seed. <words>354</words>  
Before the first dream could take flight, she had planted something deeper. <words>364</words>  
Something that would grow. <words>368</words>  
Something that would never again be told it wasn’t enough. <words>377</words>
