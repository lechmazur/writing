The broken planetarium pulsed with ultraviolet light, its shattered dome refracting stars that no longer existed. <words>17</words>  
Once a temple of science, it had been reimagined as a nightclub called “The Celestial Rift,” where timelines whispered through basslines. <words>36</words>  
Dax, an underwater welder by trade, stood at the bar, his calloused fingers wrapped around a drink that shimmered like liquid nebula. <words>54</words>  
He was patiently impatient, a paradox of a man who could wait years for a weld to hold but twitched at every tick of the cosmic clock. <words>76</words>  
Tonight, he sought the vintage button box rumored to appear only when the timelines crossed—an artifact said to grant improbable power. <words>95</words>  
He’d first seen it via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, reflections that didn’t match the shelves they mirrored, always behind him, never in reach. <words>116</words>  
Each glimpse unraveled him a little more, like threads pulled from a suit stitched in forgotten dimensions. <words>129</words>  
The bartender, a woman with eyes like eclipses, slid him a note folded into a star: “Midnight. Observatory floor. Bring nothing but memory.” <words>150</words>  
He nodded, pampering his nerves with another drink, letting the music massage the tension from his spine. <words>163</words>  
At midnight, the dance floor split open, revealing the observatory’s original telescope, now a throne of chrome and shadow. <words>179</words>  
There, on a pedestal of meteorite glass, sat the vintage button box—its surface etched with constellations that no longer aligned. <words>195</words>  
Dax approached, each step echoing like a countdown, the air thick with inherited mystery. <words>206</words>  
He reached out, and the box clicked open, revealing buttons of bone, brass, and stardust, each labeled in a language he almost remembered. <words>225</words>  
A mirror flickered beside him, showing not his reflection but a version of himself who had never left the sea. <words>240</words>  
That Dax was whole, unfractured, untouched by glimpses or unraveling. <words>247</words>  
But this Dax, the one who had chased the impossible, pressed the button marked “Convergence.” <words>259</words>  
The nightclub shuddered, stars bleeding through the walls, timelines folding like origami in a black hole’s breath. <words>274</words>  
He saw himself welding the ocean floor while dancing under alien constellations, pampering paradox with every breath. <words>288</words>  
Moments unraveled and rewove, each thread a choice, each choice a universe. <words>298</words>  
The box vanished, leaving only a single button in his palm—warm, pulsing, waiting. <words>310</words>  
He smiled, patiently impatient, knowing he’d press it again when the stars forgot their names. <words>322</words>  
Outside, the planetarium’s dome reassembled itself in reverse, sealing the night inside. <words>334</words>  
Dax walked into the mirror, becoming both welder and wanderer, wielding improbable power at the crossing of never-meant timelines. <words>352</words>  
And somewhere, in a vintage store that never opened, a mirror waited to show someone else what they’d almost forgotten. <words>370</words>  
Because some mysteries aren’t solved—they’re inherited, lived, and pressed into buttons that only appear when you’re ready to unravel. <words>388</words>
