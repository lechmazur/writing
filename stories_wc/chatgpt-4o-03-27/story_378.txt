The carnival was packing up under the first rays of dawn, its laughter and lights fading into mist as the swamp orchard exhaled its sour breath. <words>21</words>  
Mayor Tulliver, who had become mayor by accident after a ballot misprint, stood ankle-deep in muck, glaring at the monks’ gnarled pear trees. <words>42</words>  
He was a lovably grumpy man, known for cursing at clouds and feeding stray cats with the same scowl. <words>56</words>  
He hadn’t wanted to be mayor, but fate had scribbled his name in ink, and now he was here, boots sinking, heart heavy. <words>75</words>  
The monks, silent and reclusive, tended the polluted swamp orchard with a reverence that made Tulliver uneasy. <words>87</words>  
They spoke rarely, but their eyes held the kind of water wisdom that came from listening to rot and bloom alike. <words>102</words>  
Tulliver had come because of a clockwork beetle, no bigger than a walnut, that had crawled from the mayoral desk drawer last night. <words>121</words>  
It ticked like a heartbeat and whispered in clicks, leading him here, to the orchard’s heart. <words>134</words>  
He’d first heard of the beetle in a crowded café, where two monks had spoken in hushed tones over steaming nettle tea. <words>151</words>  
They hadn’t seen him behind the fern, scribbling notes on a napkin, trying to make sense of their murmured prophecy. <words>166</words>  
“Only when the beetle metamorphoses will the orchard breathe again,” one had said, voice trembling with reluctant awe. <words>180</words>  
Now, standing before the gnarled tree at the orchard’s center, Tulliver held the beetle in his palm. <words>193</words>  
It clicked once, twice, then unfolded itself into a delicate silver-winged creature, pulsing with light. <words>206</words>  
The monks emerged from the mist, their robes soaked, their faces solemn. <words>216</words>  
“You heard the call,” one said, bowing slightly. <words>224</words>  
“I heard a lot of things,” Tulliver muttered, “mostly nonsense.” <words>232</words>  
But the beetle rose, hovering above the tree, and with a final chime, dissolved into mist. <words>245</words>  
The tree shuddered, leaves unfurling, roots drinking deeply from the poisoned earth. <words>256</words>  
A ripple spread through the orchard, and the swamp began to clear, its waters turning from black to amber. <words>270</words>  
Tulliver stared, mouth agape, as frogs croaked songs not heard in decades. <words>281</words>  
He hadn’t meant to change the course of fate—he’d only wanted to return the beetle to wherever it belonged. <words>297</words>  
But now, the monks knelt, and the orchard breathed, and the carnival’s last wagon vanished into the horizon. <words>311</words>  
Tulliver sighed, scratched his beard, and muttered, “Well, damn. Guess I’m the mayor after all.” <words>324</words>  
The monks smiled, and the swamp sang. <words>330</words>  
And somewhere deep in the orchard, something ancient stirred, grateful for the grumpy man who had listened. <words>344</words>  
He turned back toward town, boots squelching, heart lighter, the dawn painting gold across the water. <words>357</words>  
Fate, it seemed, had a sense of humor—and a clockwork beetle to prove it. <words>369</words>
