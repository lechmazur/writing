Between flights, when the world blurred into terminals and time zones, Elian made his yearly pilgrimage to his family’s ancestral home nestled deep in the moss-veiled woods of Vermont. <words>27</words> 

He was a scout by trade, but not the kind who charted terrain for armies—Elian was a somnambulist scout, mapping spiritual wisdom in dreams he walked while asleep. <words>54</words> 

Each year, he returned to the sunken laboratory hidden beneath the roots of a collapsed elm, where his great-grandmother once studied the secrets of the woodland. <words>75</words> 

The lab, half-swallowed by earth and time, pulsed with a quiet energy, its walls lined with dusty tomes and jars of preserved flora, but Elian’s favorite was the bottled lightning bug collection. <words>101</words> 

The insects, still glowing faintly after decades, were said to hold fragments of forgotten truths, their light flickering in patterns that only dreamwalkers could decipher. <words>122</words> 

Elian, unapologetically humble despite his rare gift, never claimed to understand everything he saw in his sleep, but he believed the forest whispered to those who listened. <words>144</words> 

He would lie on the mossy floor of the lab, the bottled bugs arranged in a circle around him, and drift into slumber as the forest hummed its lullaby. <words>169</words> 

In his dreams, he scouted the woodland’s hidden paths, where trees spoke in riddles and foxes wore the faces of ancestors, guiding him toward truths buried beneath bark and bone. <words>195</words> 

This year, the dreams were different—more vivid, more urgent—as if the forest itself was trying to show him something it had long kept secret. <words>215</words> 

He followed a trail of glowing beetles through dream-thickets until he reached a clearing where a mirror pool reflected not his face, but the faces of those who came before. <words>241</words> 

They spoke in unison, their voices like wind through pine: “The map is not the land, but the light that moves across it.” <words>260</words> 

Elian awoke with tears on his cheeks and a new pattern etched into the glass of one lightning bug’s jar—a constellation he’d never seen before. <words>282</words> 

He sketched it quickly, heart pounding, knowing it was a key to something deeper, a layer of woodland wisdom yet unmapped. <words>299</words> 

As he packed his things, the forest seemed to lean in, watching, waiting, its secrets no longer hidden but entrusted. <words>316</words> 

He left the sunken lab with reverence, locking the hatch behind him, the bottled bugs safely cradled in his pack. <words>337</words> 

Back at the airport, between flights, he sat by a window, tracing the constellation on a napkin, the glow of the bugs faint through his bag. <words>361</words> 

He wasn’t just a scout anymore—he was a keeper of woodland truths, a cartographer of the unseen, guided by light bottled long ago. <words>383</words> 

And though the world bustled around him, Elian’s mind remained in the forest, where secrets waited patiently for those humble enough to dream. <words>405</words>
