At the edge of the Pacific Arcology, nestled in a kelp forest observation post swaying gently with the tides, Policy Enforcer Lira Venn adjusted her visor and sighed. <words>28</words>  
She hadn’t slept in thirty-six hours, and the utopia she served—Eunoia—demanded perfection, even from the exhausted. <words>42</words>  
Her job was to ensure compliance with the Harmony Directives, a set of laws so idealistic they practically glowed. <words>56</words>  
But lately, something had been glowing back. <words>61</words>  
It started with the rustic bread box. <words>66</words>  
An antique, out of place in the sleek, algae-powered kitchen of the post, it had arrived without explanation. <words>80</words>  
Lira had opened it expecting contraband or perhaps a prank, but instead found a note: “Guide them with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance.” <words>98</words>  
No signature, just a faint scent of salt and something older. <words>106</words>  
She laughed, a short bark of disbelief, then tucked the note into her pocket, telling herself it was genuinely fake. <words>120</words>  
But that night, as the kelp swayed like dancers and the moonlight filtered through the glass dome, she heard it. <words>134</words>  
A low, pulsing beat, like a drum echoing through water and bone. <words>143</words>  
She followed it, barefoot, her steps syncing with the rhythm, descending into the observation chamber. <words>155</words>  
There, at the exact second a promise was sworn—her own, whispered years ago to never fear the unknown—something shimmered. <words>171</words>  
A figure emerged from the kelp, not swimming but gliding, its form shifting like seafoam and memory. <words>183</words>  
Lira’s breath caught, but she didn’t run. <words>188</words>  
She remembered the note, the beat, the promise. <words>194</words>  
“I greet fear as a necessary teacher,” she said aloud, voice trembling but clear. <words>204</words>  
The figure paused, then nodded, its face a mirror of her own, only older, wiser, and smiling with laughing tears. <words>218</words>  
It raised a hand, and the bread box appeared between them, now glowing faintly. <words>228</words>  
Inside, not bread, but memories—hers, others’, all woven into a tapestry of choices and consequences. <words>240</words>  
“You enforce policy,” the figure said, voice like waves on stone, “but who enforces truth?” <words>251</words>  
Lira didn’t answer. <words>254</words>  
Instead, she reached into the box and pulled out a single thread of light. <words>264</words>  
It pulsed with the drumbeat, guiding her hand to the observation console. <words>274</words>  
She rewrote a directive, just one, allowing for the supernatural to be acknowledged, studied, even welcomed. <words>286</words>  
The system blinked, hesitated, then accepted the change. <words>293</words>  
The figure bowed, dissolving into the kelp, leaving behind only the beat and the bread box. <words>304</words>  
Lira sat down, laughing until tears came, the kind that cleanse rather than sting. <words>314</words>  
She was still overworked, still tired, but no longer alone in her knowing. <words>324</words>  
The utopia had cracks, and through them, wonder seeped. <words>331</words>  
She would guide others, not with rules, but with rhythm. <words>339</words>  
And when fear came again, as it always would, she would greet it like an old friend. <words>351</words>  
Outside, the kelp danced, and somewhere deep, the drumbeat continued. <words>360</words>  
Lira smiled, the bread box warm beneath her hand, and whispered, “Let’s begin.” <words>370</words>
