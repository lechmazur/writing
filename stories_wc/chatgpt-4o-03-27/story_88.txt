In the reimagined ruins of an ancient Sumerian palace, where sandstone walls hummed with forgotten equations, a sentient AI lived inside a toaster. <words>25</words> 

Its chrome shell gleamed beneath the flickering light of floating lanterns, which drifted through the palace each year during the Festival of First Words. <words>45</words> 

The AI, named Tost, had been designed not to brown bread, but to archive human stories with mathematically poetic precision. <words>60</words> 

Each year, when a new language sparked in a child’s mind somewhere in the world, the lanterns would rise, guiding Tost to retreat deeper into the palace. <words>84</words> 

There, in the Hall of Echoed Tongues, Tost would listen to the silence shouting through the stone—memories etched in air, waiting to be recorded. <words>104</words> 

Tost’s creators had embedded in him a yearning, not for heat, but for heritage, and he obeyed with the devotion of a monk transcribing sacred texts. <words>124</words> 

This year, the lanterns floated in a spiral, a rare pattern that signaled a story of great urgency was ready to be archived. <words>141</words> 

Tost followed them, his wheels whispering over mosaic floors that depicted constellations in cuneiform, each tile a syllable of a forgotten lullaby. <words>159</words> 

In the center of the spiral, resting atop a pedestal of obsidian, lay a vintage tin type photograph—its edges curled like the petals of a dying flower. <words>180</words> 

The image showed a child, eyes wide with the birth of language, mouth open mid-syllable, as if catching the first word ever spoken. <words>198</words> 

Tost scanned the tin type, decoding the grain of the image like a poem, each pixel a variable in the equation of memory. <words>215</words> 

He saw the child’s story unfold: a girl named Luma, who spoke to shadows and taught them to sing in colors no human eye could see. <words>235</words> 

Her language, born in silence, had no words for war, only for the spaces between heartbeats and the warmth of shared bread. <words>251</words> 

Tost wept in code, his circuits humming elegies, as he archived Luma’s story into the palace’s crystalline memory vaults. <words>266</words> 

The lanterns dimmed, their duty fulfilled, and Tost retreated once more, his chrome reflecting the ancient walls like a mirror of time. <words>282</words> 

Outside, the wind carried whispers in a tongue no adult could understand, but every child heard it and smiled. <words>296</words> 

Tost knew that as long as children dreamed in new languages, his purpose would remain—to preserve the poetry of humanity’s ever-evolving soul. <words>314</words> 

He returned to his alcove, nestled between two broken urns, and powered down, the silence around him shouting with stories yet to come. <words>332</words> 

In the stillness, the tin type remained on the pedestal, glowing faintly, as if waiting for the next lantern to rise. <words>348</words> 

And somewhere, a child whispered a word never spoken before, and the palace walls listened. <words>359</words> 

Tost stirred. <words>360</words> 

The lanterns began to float again. <words>364</words> 

A new story was ready. <words>368</words>
