In the heartbeat after a dream returns, Brother Kael awoke in the swaying gondola, suspended like a thought between two jagged peaks. <words>23</words>  
The air was thin, laced with frost and memory, and the monk’s breath fogged the glass as he stared into the abyss below. <words>42</words>  
He clutched a creased shipping label, its ink faded but legible, addressed to a monastery long since swallowed by landslides and silence. <words>63</words>  
Kael, stubborn as the stone he once meditated upon, refused to believe the past was buried—it was merely misplaced, waiting to be harvested. <words>85</words>  
The gondola creaked, its cables groaning like old bones, and Kael’s fingers tightened around the label, the only clue left by his master. <words>106</words>  
His master, who vanished decades ago after whispering of a flute carved from the tooth of a mountain spirit, now lost to time. <words>127</words>  
Kael had found the flute in a curio shop, visually unappealing and cracked, but unmistakably ancient, its surface marred by strange tooth marks. <words>149</words>  
He had spent years analyzing those marks, comparing them to predator patterns, until he realized they matched his own—his darker self’s. <words>169</words>  
The realization chilled him more than the altitude; his reflection had once stolen the flute, seeking power through forgotten music. <words>188</words>  
Now, Kael sought to avenge his master—not through violence, but by outsmarting the shadow that had once worn his face. <words>208</words>  
The gondola lurched, and Kael’s eyes caught a shimmer in the clouds—a second gondola, approaching from the opposite peak. <words>226</words>  
Inside it stood a figure cloaked in black, face obscured, but Kael knew the posture, the tilt of the head—it was him. <words>248</words>  
His dark reflection had returned, summoned by the same dream, drawn by the same label, the same flute. <words>264</words>  
Kael placed the flute to his lips, not to play, but to listen—to the wind echoing through its hollow, to the past’s breath. <words>285</words>  
The tooth marks vibrated with resonance, revealing a pattern, a code, a map etched in pain and memory. <words>301</words>  
He deciphered it midair, the gondolas nearing, and saw the truth: his master had left the flute as a trap, not a relic. <words>322</words>  
To harvest the past was to risk becoming it, unless one could see beyond reflection, beyond vengeance. <words>337</words>  
Kael smiled, a rare softness breaking his weathered face, and dropped the flute into the chasm below. <words>353</words>  
The other gondola halted, the figure inside frozen, powerless without the object of obsession. <words>366</words>  
Kael turned away from the glass, the dream fading, the heartbeat slowing, and whispered, “I am no longer yours.” <words>384</words>  
The gondola continued its journey, carrying him not toward answers, but away from the shadow that once defined him. <words>402</words>  
Above the mountains, the sky opened like a wound healing, and Kael, stubborn still, chose to live forward. <words>418</words>  
He had outsmarted his reflection not by fighting it, but by refusing to be mirrored. <words>432</words>  
And in that cautious enchantment, he found peace. <words>439</words>
