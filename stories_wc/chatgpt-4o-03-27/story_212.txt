The ethereal plains shimmered with a light that had no source, stretching endlessly beneath a sky that never changed. <words>17</words>  
After the last resource war, the world had fractured into silence, and only the wind dared jabber across the emptiness. <words>34</words>  
Elias, a typically atypical farmer, knelt in the dust, coaxing life from soil that had forgotten the taste of rain. <words>50</words>  
He bred seeds not just for food, but for memory—each sprout a whisper of what once was, and what might be again. <words>67</words>  
His only companion was a magician’s deck of trick cards, left behind by a wanderer who claimed to hear the song of boundaries. <words>85</words>  
Elias never understood the cards’ illusions, but he shuffled them nightly, hoping they’d reveal a path beyond this dictated life. <words>101</words>  
The war had ended with no victors, only survivors, and Elias had been assigned his role like a number in a ledger. <words>118</words>  
But he longed to escape, to find a place where his choices weren’t rationed like water or weighed like grain. <words>133</words>  
He sent messages in bottles, casting them into the sea that lapped at the edge of the plains, though no one believed it still moved. <words>152</words>  
Each message was a fragment of his soul, a plea wrapped in seed paper, inked with dreams and sealed with desperation. <words>167</words>  
One morning, a bottle returned—its glass warm, its cork humming with a tune that wasn’t wind but something older. <words>181</words>  
Inside was a single card from his magician’s deck, the Queen of Spades, now etched with strange glyphs and a map. <words>197</words>  
The song of boundaries played in his ears then—not music, but a vibration that made the air shimmer and the soil pulse. <words>213</words>  
He followed the map, leaving behind his crops, his shack, and the silence that had become his cage. <words>226</words>  
The plains shifted as he walked, revealing paths that hadn’t existed, or perhaps had always been waiting for him to see. <words>243</words>  
He passed through veils of light and shadow, each step echoing with the jabber of forgotten voices and remembered names. <words>258</words>  
At the edge of the world, where the sea met the sky in a kiss of mist, he found a door made of salt. <words>275</words>  
The Queen of Spades pulsed in his hand, and the door opened—not to another place, but to a life unclaimed. <words>290</words>  
There, he planted his final seed, and the earth sang back, not in sorrow, but in raw solace. <words>303</words>  
The song of boundaries faded, not because it ended, but because Elias had finally crossed it. <words>316</words>  
And somewhere, far behind him, the magician’s deck scattered in the wind, its tricks no longer needed. <words>329</words>  
He was no longer a farmer, nor a prisoner of roles, but a man who had rewritten his fate through a bottle and a song. <words>347</words>  
The plains watched in silence, and for the first time, they did not shimmer—they bloomed. <words>359</words>  
Elias smiled, typically atypical to the end, and vanished into the horizon where no boundaries remained. <words>373</words>
