<story>
The weatherbeaten knight stood before the lighthouse prison, its spire clawing at the stormy sky like a finger of judgment. <words>17</words>  
He had crossed the jagged reef on a raft of bones, each one a memory he could neither bury nor burn. <words>35</words>  
In his gauntleted hand, he clutched a brass door knocker shaped like a lion swallowing its own tail. <words>49</words>  
The door opened not with a creak, but with a sigh, as if the prison itself mourned his return. <words>63</words>  
Inside, mirrors lined the walls, each reflecting not his face, but moments he had failed to change. <words>77</words>  
He saw the boy he left behind in the burning village, the queen he betrayed for peace, the brother he struck down. <words>95</words>  
Each reflection whispered a different regret, but all ended with the same cry—the final one he had come to hush. <words>110</words>  
The knight moved forward, boots echoing on the stone floor like a heartbeat too stubborn to stop. <words>122</words>  
He passed cells filled with seemingly random items: a cracked teacup, a featherless arrow, a wilted rose, a child’s shoe. <words>137</words>  
At first, they seemed meaningless, but as he walked, the pattern emerged—each item marked a choice he once made. <words>152</words>  
The teacup from the poisoned peace treaty, the arrow from the duel he refused, the rose from the grave he never visited. <words>168</words>  
The child’s shoe—he knelt before it, trembling, remembering the daughter he never claimed. <words>179</words>  
He wanted to scream, but instead, he whispered, “I appreciate the weight of what I’ve done.” <words>191</words>  
A grudgingly sweet voice echoed from the mirrored walls, “Then why return, knight of rust and sorrow?” <words>203</words>  
“To choose again,” he said, “even if the choices are impossible.” <words>211</words>  
The mirrors shimmered, and one reflection stepped forward—a version of himself, younger, unscarred, eyes full of fire. <words>224</words>  
They stared at each other, the past and the present, until the younger knight offered a blade made of light and shadow. <words>239</words>  
“Only one of us may leave,” the reflection said, “and only if he carries no regret.” <words>251</words>  
The knight took the blade, not to fight, but to kneel, pressing it to his own throat. <words>263</words>  
“I carry them all,” he said, “but I will not let them scream anymore.” <words>274</words>  
The blade dissolved, and so did the reflection, leaving only silence and the sound of waves crashing outside. <words>287</words>  
The lighthouse prison began to crumble, its purpose fulfilled, its final cry hushed. <words>297</words>  
The knight walked out through the storm, the brass door knocker now hanging from his belt like a medal. <words>311</words>  
He did not smile, but his eyes held a grudging sweetness, as if joy and agony had finally made peace. <words>326</words>  
Behind him, the reef swallowed the lighthouse whole, and the sea grew calm for the first time in years. <words>340</words>  
He looked into a tidepool, saw his reflection, and for once, it did not look away. <words>352</words>  
He nodded to it, appreciating the man he had become, forged by impossible choices and tempered by regret. <words>366</words>  
Then he turned from the mirrored water and walked into the dawn, the storm behind him, the silence ahead. <words>380</words>
