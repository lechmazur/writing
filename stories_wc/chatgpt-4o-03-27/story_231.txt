As the anchor lifted from the harbor floor, signaling the maiden voyage of the merchant ship *Ereshkigal’s Whisper*, the shepherd known as Tammuz tightened the leather strap around his satchel and turned his eyes toward the crumbling silhouette of the ancient Sumerian palace. <words>38</words> 

He had never left the high pastures before, but the coordinates etched into the antique hairpin he wore around his neck had summoned him here, to the heart of forgotten empires. <words>66</words> 

The hairpin, once belonging to his mother, a palace servant executed for treason, had been passed to him with a whisper: “Justice has a price, and you must pay it.” <words>96</words> 

Tammuz, sentimental by nature and habitually spontaneous by flaw, had not questioned the message—he had simply followed it, as he followed the wind across the hills. <words>122</words> 

Now, standing before the palace’s obsidian gates, he felt the weight of his mother’s memory pressing against his ribs like a second heartbeat. <words>143</words> 

Inside, the air was thick with incense and the ghosts of judgment, the walls carved with cuneiform tales of kings who had bartered their souls for fleeting order. <words>170</words> 

He moved through the halls with the awkward grace of a man who had never worn sandals indoors, his shepherd’s crook tapping against the stone like a metronome of fate. <words>199</words> 

At the center of the throne room, a circle of robed figures awaited him, their faces hidden, their silence louder than any welcome. <words>221</words> 

He stepped into the circle, pulled the hairpin from his neck, and held it aloft. <words>234</words> 

“I boast not of lineage or wisdom,” he said, voice trembling, “but I carry the truth of a servant who died for knowing too much.” <words>262</words> 

The tallest figure stepped forward, revealing a face lined with inked runes and sorrow. <words>276</words> 

“You seek justice?” the figure asked. <words>283</words> 

“No,” Tammuz replied, “I seek chaos, for only in its fire can truth be forged.” <words>298</words> 

A murmur rippled through the circle, and the figure nodded, gesturing to a stone basin filled with black water. <words>318</words> 

“Then drink, and let the past unravel.” <words>325</words> 

Tammuz drank, and visions surged—his mother’s trial, the bribed judges, the hidden scrolls, the coordinates carved in desperation. <words>346</words> 

He saw the price of justice: not gold, but memory, not verdicts, but sacrifice. <words>359</words> 

When he awoke, the palace was gone, replaced by a field of ash and stars, and the ship *Ereshkigal’s Whisper* sailed above him in the sky. <words>387</words> 

He laughed, not in triumph, but in chaotic humility, for he had learned that justice was not a destination, but a storm one must welcome to grow. <words>416</words> 

With the hairpin now embedded in his staff, he turned toward the hills, ready to teach others what the fire had taught him. <words>439</words> 

And as he walked, he boasted—not of what he had done, but of what he had survived, and what he had chosen to become. <words>467</words> 

For Tammuz, the sentimental shepherd, had paid the price of justice, and found in its chaos the clarity of purpose. <words>488</words>
