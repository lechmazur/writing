In the hush as the last parade float disappeared down the cobbled street, Emmerick stood alone, soot still clinging to his fingernails. <words>23</words>  
The grieving miner had not worked a shaft in months, not since the collapse that took his brother and half the crew. <words>42</words>  
He clutched a tiny bell, silent and tarnished, once tied to his brother’s helmet—a charm against cave-ins that had failed. <words>61</words>  
The bell never rang again, but Emmerick kept it close, a mute witness to the past he couldn’t bury. <words>77</words>  
Tonight, he approached the ivy-covered door of the secret society meeting hall, hidden behind the old clockmaker’s shop. <words>93</words>  
Inside, the air buzzed with the low murmur of thinkers, tinkerers, and watchers of change, all gathered to chronicle technological shifts. <words>113</words>  
Emmerick had joined not for invention, but to understand the machines that had replaced men like his brother. <words>129</words>  
He moved with a passionately indifferent gait, as if his heart burned but his limbs refused to show it. <words>145</words>  
The hall’s walls were lined with sketches, gears, and fading blueprints, each a relic of progress and its price. <words>161</words>  
He took his seat beneath a flickering gaslight, eyes scanning the room with careful observations honed in the dark. <words>177</words>  
The chairman, a woman with brass spectacles and oil-stained gloves, nodded at him to begin. <words>190</words>  
Emmerick cleared his throat, then spoke not from memory, but from the after-images of persistent nightmares. <words>204</words>  
He described the rhythmic groan of the mine before it gave, the way light bent around falling stone. <words>219</words>  
He coaxed the room into silence, not with drama, but with the raw precision of someone who had seen too much. <words>237</words>  
As he spoke, the tiny bell in his pocket seemed to grow heavier, though it made no sound. <words>253</words>  
He told them how the new drills had no soul, how they dug faster but listened less. <words>268</words>  
The room leaned in, not out of pity, but because his grief mapped the cost of advancement. <words>283</words>  
When he finished, the chairman rose and placed a gear-shaped token on the table before him. <words>297</words>  
“Your chronicle is accepted,” she said, voice soft but firm, “and necessary.” <words>307</words>  
Emmerick nodded, unsure if he felt lighter or more burdened. <words>316</words>  
Outside, the last echo of the parade faded, leaving only the ticking of the hall’s great clock. <words>331</words>  
He stepped into the night, the bell still silent, but his purpose newly forged. <words>344</words>  
In the distance, a new float was being assembled—sleek, mechanical, and humming with promise. <words>358</words>  
Emmerick watched, eyes narrowed, ready to observe, to remember, and to coax meaning from the march of progress. <words>374</words>
