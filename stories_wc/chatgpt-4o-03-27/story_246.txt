At the hush of a phone once its battery dies, the silence in the town of Marrow Creek becomes almost sacred. <words>21</words>  
It’s in that silence that Ellis Granger, the town’s discreetly flagrant conspiracy theorist, listens for the truth beneath the static. <words>39</words>  
He lives alone in a crooked house near the edge of the magnetic field anomaly that’s warped compasses and minds for generations. <words>56</words>  
Locals say the anomaly makes birds fly backward and clocks tick in reverse, but Ellis believes it’s a wound in the world. <words>75</words>  
He’s convinced that the anomaly is the result of a generational curse, one that began with his great-grandfather’s betrayal during a solar storm. <words>95</words>  
Ellis’s obsession began when he found a bundle of handwritten letters hidden in the drawer of an antique rolltop desk he bought at auction. <words>114</words>  
The letters, yellowed and brittle, were addressed to no one, signed only with the initials “E.G.” and dated over a century ago. <words>132</words>  
They spoke of a pact made under a blood moon, a promise to polymerize the soul with the earth to gain cosmic favor. <words>151</words>  
Each letter was wrapped in an embroidered handkerchief, stitched with the same sigil Ellis had seen burned into the bark of trees near the anomaly. <words>172</words>  
The sigil, a spiral within a triangle, appeared again and again in his dreams, always accompanied by the sound of a dying phone. <words>191</words>  
Ellis believed the letters were written by his ancestor, a man who tried to tip the cosmic scale in his favor and failed. <words>210</words>  
Now, Ellis is determined to finish what was started, to break the curse that has haunted his bloodline and poisoned the town’s peace. <words>229</words>  
He begins writing his own letters, mimicking the old script, each one a confession, a plea, a ritual etched in ink and desperation. <words>247</words>  
He hides them in antique furniture scattered across town, hoping someone will find them and continue the chain if he fails. <words>264</words>  
At night, he walks to the heart of the anomaly, where the air hums and the stars seem to pulse with breath. <words>282</words>  
There, he buries the embroidered handkerchiefs, one for each generation, whispering apologies into the soil as if it could forgive. <words>299</words>  
The townspeople think he’s mad, but they don’t see the way the trees lean toward him now, or how the clocks have begun to sync. <words>319</words>  
Ellis knows the curse is unraveling, thread by thread, as if the letters are polymerizing his intent with the fabric of reality. <words>337</words>  
But peace doesn’t come easy; it crumbles like old paper, and Ellis feels the weight of every ancestor pressing down on his spine. <words>356</words>  
Still, he writes, even as his phone dies in his pocket, even as the hush returns, thick and expectant. <words>372</words>  
He writes because he must, because the scale is tipping, and for once, it might fall in his family’s favor. <words>388</words>  
And when the final letter is sealed, wrapped in the last embroidered handkerchief, Ellis smiles, knowing the silence now carries his voice. <words>407</words>
