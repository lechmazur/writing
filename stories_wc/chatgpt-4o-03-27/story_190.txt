The drought prediction center buzzed with the low hum of machines and the occasional drip of condensation from overworked air conditioners. <words>1</words>  
Inside, under the flickering fluorescent lights, a cautious smuggler named Elian waited beside a hospital bed, clutching a small, glass case containing a pressed butterfly. <words>2</words>  
The butterfly, once vibrant blue, had dulled with time, but its wings still shimmered faintly, like a memory refusing to fade. <words>3</words>  
Elian wasn’t here for weather data—he was here for the painter’s confession, scheduled during anesthesia for a minor surgery. <words>4</words>  
The painter, known only as Vireo, had once been a revolutionary artist before vanishing into obscurity and paranoia. <words>5</words>  
Now, sedated and vulnerable, Vireo was expected to spill secrets—secrets Elian needed to predict the next emotional drought in the city’s collective psyche. <words>6</words>  
Elian’s smuggling wasn’t of goods, but of feelings—he trafficked in musical memories, stolen from the minds of the anesthetized. <words>7</words>  
Each memory was a melody, a symphony of emotion encoded in neural rhythms, and Elian had become meticulously impulsive in collecting them. <words>8</words>  
He believed that to become a master of empathy, he had to feel every note of another’s pain, joy, and longing. <words>9</words>  
The butterfly had belonged to his sister, who’d died in a flood years ago, and it served as both talisman and reminder. <words>10</words>  
He pressed it to his chest as Vireo began to mumble, the anesthesia loosening the painter’s grip on reality. <words>11</words>  
“I painted the drought,” Vireo whispered, “before it came… in colors no one could hear.” <words>12</words>  
Elian leaned closer, activating the neural recorder hidden in his collar, capturing the painter’s delirious confessions. <words>13</words>  
“I saw the music in the cracks of the soil,” Vireo continued, “each fissure a note, each silence a scream.” <words>14</words>  
Elian’s breath caught—this was it, the emotional blueprint of a city on the brink of forgetting how to feel. <words>15</words>  
He could already hear the melody forming in his mind, a dirge of dust and forgotten rain. <words>16</words>  
The smuggler’s enthusiasm was buried beneath layers of practiced apathy, but inside, he trembled with purpose. <words>17</words>  
He would take this memory, this song, and smuggle it into the hearts of those who had grown numb. <words>18</words>  
He would predict not just weather, but the emotional climate, and prepare the city for the storm of feeling to come. <words>19</words>  
Vireo’s voice faded into incoherence, but the melody lingered, etched into Elian’s mind like a scar. <words>20</words>  
He stood, pocketed the butterfly, and walked out of the center, unnoticed, a ghost carrying a song. <words>21</words>  
Outside, the sky cracked open—not with rain, but with the first notes of a city remembering how to weep. <words>22</words>  
Elian smiled faintly, already planning his next heist of the heart. <words>23</words>
