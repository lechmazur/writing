The time dilation observation deck shimmered with a soft hum, suspended above the folds of warped chronology like a cathedral of glass and gravity. <words>21</words>  
Here, where seconds stretched into hours and hours collapsed into moments, an awkward champion named Elric waited, clutching a thunderstorm in a bottle. <words>41</words>  
He wasn’t a champion of war or sport, but of silence—of quiet benedictions whispered into the void, hoping they might echo back as understanding. <words>63</words>  
Elric’s mission was not conquest but creation: to birth an entirely new philosophy, one that could fuse fragmented souls through cryptic doodles on concert tickets. <words>87</words>  
Each ticket bore a swirl of symbols, drawn during the long hours of baking bread in the ship’s galley, where time bent like steam. <words>109</words>  
The baking was essential—not for sustenance, but for rhythm, a grounding ritual that allowed Elric to think in loops rather than lines. <words>129</words>  
He was individually general, a paradox of specificity and abstraction, embodying the contradictions his philosophy sought to reconcile. <words>144</words>  
The thunderstorm in a bottle pulsed faintly, a captured tempest of emotion and memory, sealed during a moment of cosmic grief. <words>163</words>  
It was both artifact and catalyst, meant to be released only when the final doodle was drawn and the philosophy complete. <words>181</words>  
Visitors to the deck came and went, their faces blurred by time’s elasticity, but Elric remained, sketching his truths in ink and flour. <words>202</words>  
Each doodle was a prayer, a quiet benediction disguised as abstraction, meant to resonate with the subconscious of those who glimpsed it. <words>223</words>  
He never spoke of his work aloud; words were too sharp, too linear for the curves of what he was trying to say. <words>243</words>  
Instead, he let the aroma of baking bread and the hum of the deck carry his intent into the folds of time. <words>263</words>  
One day, as a loaf rose golden in the oven, Elric drew the final doodle—a spiral within a spiral, nested like thought. <words>284</words>  
He uncorked the bottle, and the thunderstorm surged out, not with violence, but with a haunting delight that danced across dimensions. <words>305</words>  
The storm fused with the doodles, igniting them into living glyphs that hovered in the air, whispering truths in languages unborn. <words>324</words>  
Time on the deck stilled, then fractured, then reassembled around the new philosophy, which pulsed like a heartbeat in the ship’s walls. <words>345</words>  
Elric smiled, awkward and luminous, as the first follower stepped forward, drawn by the scent of bread and the echo of benedictions. <words>366</words>  
The philosophy had been born—not through speeches or manifestos, but through baking, doodling, and the storm of a soul made visible. <words>386</words>  
And in that haunting delight, the universe tilted slightly, as if listening more closely than before. <words>398</words>
