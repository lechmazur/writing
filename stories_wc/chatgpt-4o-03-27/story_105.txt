In the hush of a half-lit corridor, Elian crept past rows of levitating carpets, their tassels twitching like sleeping cats. <words>21</words>  
The witch’s flying carpet garage was closed at this hour, but Elian had never been one for rules. <words>36</words>  
An outcast scholar with ink-stained fingers and a reputation for asking questions no one wanted answered, he moved with frantic peace. <words>54</words>  
He clutched a seashell with a strange symbol etched into its spiral—a glyph that mirrored his own soul. <words>69</words>  
The shell had jolted in his hand when he first touched it, as if recognizing something buried deep within him. <words>85</words>  
He’d found it weeks ago, hidden behind a loose tile in a public restroom, wrapped in pages torn from old diaries. <words>103</words>  
The diaries belonged to a woman named Lys, a witch who vanished decades ago after claiming midnight could be broken. <words>118</words>  
Her words, scrawled in looping ink, spoke of soul-mirroring and the hour when time folds in on itself. <words>132</words>  
Elian believed her—not just because of the shell, but because her voice in those pages felt strangely trustworthy. <words>146</words>  
He reached the back of the garage, where a carpet stitched with constellations hovered, humming softly like a lullaby. <words>161</words>  
This was Lys’s carpet, according to the diaries, and it only flew for those who understood the truth of midnight. <words>176</words>  
Elian placed the shell on the carpet’s center, and the symbol began to glow, casting shadows that danced like memories. <words>192</words>  
The carpet shuddered, then jolted upward, lifting Elian into the air with a gasp and a rush of wind. <words>206</words>  
Outside, the sky was ink-black, but the stars blinked in patterns he’d only seen in Lys’s diagrams. <words>219</words>  
He whispered her final words: “Midnight only lasts so long—it is not an end, but a mirror.” <words>232</words>  
The shell pulsed, and Elian felt his soul stretch, reflect, and settle into something clearer, more whole. <words>245</words>  
He saw himself—not as the outcast, but as the seeker, the one who dared to believe in broken hours. <words>260</words>  
The carpet soared higher, slicing through the night, chasing the edge of dawn like a promise. <words>272</words>  
Below, the world slept, unaware that time had just bent, if only slightly, to let a soul be seen. <words>287</words>  
Elian laughed, not with triumph, but with relief, as if the universe had finally exhaled with him. <words>299</words>  
He would return, eventually, with proof that midnight was not eternal, that even darkness has a seam. <words>313</words>  
But for now, he flew, strangely trustworthy to the stars, a scholar no longer outcast but aligned. <words>326</words>  
The shell dimmed, its purpose fulfilled, and Elian tucked it into his coat like a heartbeat. <words>339</words>  
He had mirrored his soul and found it not broken, but waiting. <words>347</words>  
And in the hush of that half-lit corridor, something ancient had finally moved forward. <words>358</words>  
Midnight, after all, only lasts so long. <words>363</words>
