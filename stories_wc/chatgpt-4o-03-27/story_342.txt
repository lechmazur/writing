The careless pilot drifted low over the twisted orchard labyrinth, his dirigible groaning like an old man remembering flight. <words>20</words>  
He wore a worn-out glove on his left hand, the leather cracked and stained with ink from postcards he could never quite forget. <words>39</words>  
The enchanted oak grove below shimmered with a deliberately dreamy haze, as if the trees themselves were half-asleep and half-aware. <words>56</words>  
He landed in the lull between echoing thunder and fresh rain, when the air held its breath and the world paused to listen. <words>75</words>  
His mission, absurd and sacred, was to archive natural patterns—spirals in bark, the rhythm of falling leaves, the geometry of moss. <words>94</words>  
But lately, the postcards had changed, their backs no longer blank but filled with sinister doodles: eyes in roots, teeth in clouds, maps of nowhere. <words>115</words>  
He investigated them obsessively, tracing each line with his gloved finger, hoping to emancipate the truth buried in borrowed memories. <words>134</words>  
The glove had once belonged to a cartographer who vanished in this very grove, leaving behind only a journal of dreams and a compass that spun wildly. <words>155</words>  
Now, the pilot wore it like a relic, hoping it might guide him through the orchard’s shifting paths and into the heart of its mystery. <words>174</words>  
He wandered beneath gnarled branches that whispered in forgotten dialects, the trees leaning in as if to share secrets or swallow him whole. <words>193</words>  
Each postcard he found was pinned to bark with thorns, the doodles growing more frantic, more alive, as if drawn by trembling hands in a storm. <words>214</words>  
One showed a spiral staircase descending into roots; another, a face made of leaves, weeping ink; a third, a glove reaching toward a vanishing sun. <words>235</words>  
He began to remember things that weren’t his—dancing in moonlight with bark-skinned lovers, screaming as roots wrapped around his ankles, laughing as he flew upside down. <words>256</words>  
The borrowed memories tangled with his own, and he no longer knew if he was the pilot, the cartographer, or the grove itself dreaming of men. <words>275</words>  
Still, he pressed on, resigned yet exuberant, cataloging the orchard’s patterns with reverence, even as the rain began to fall in slow, deliberate drops. <words>294</words>  
He reached the center of the labyrinth, where a massive oak stood hollow and humming, its bark etched with every postcard he’d ever touched. <words>313</words>  
Inside, he found a final postcard, blank but warm, and as he held it, the glove crumbled to dust, and the rain washed away his name. <words>334</words>  
He smiled, finally emancipated from memory, from self, from sky, and stepped into the tree’s embrace, becoming another pattern in the archive of the grove. <words>353</words>  
Above, the thunder returned, softer now, as if mourning or applauding, and the orchard twisted once more, hiding its heart from the next dreamer. <words>372</words>  
The dirigible, untethered, rose slowly into the clouds, its cabin empty but for a single postcard fluttering on the wind, ink still wet. <words>391</words>
