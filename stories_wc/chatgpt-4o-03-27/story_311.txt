The lunar greenhouse on the crater’s edge shimmered under the filtered sunlight, its glass panels etched with dust from the last meteor storm. <words>20</words>  
Inside, Rhea stood motionless among the spiraling vines of oxygen-rich flora, her tense bodyguard stance betraying the storm within. <words>36</words>  
She wasn’t guarding anyone anymore—just the memory of a life she was trying to escape. <words>47</words>  
In her gloved hand, she held a faded photograph: a child’s smile, a woman’s eyes, and a man’s shadow behind them. <words>64</words>  
The image had survived Earth’s collapse, tucked in her boot through evacuations, betrayals, and the long silence of space. <words>78</words>  
She had once protected the man in the photo, a political architect who’d built colonies with charm and coercion. <words>92</words>  
He’d ratified laws that bound people like her to service, loyalty extracted like breath from lungs. <words>104</words>  
But amid park visits on Earth—those rare, unscheduled moments—Rhea had begun collecting fragments of overheard stories. <words>117</words>  
Children whispering about secret gardens, old women murmuring about resistance, lovers dreaming of rebirth beyond the stars. <words>130</words>  
She’d pieced them together like a mosaic, each shard a clue to a world outside his control. <words>143</words>  
Her serendipitously stubborn nature had kept her listening, even when it was dangerous, even when it hurt. <words>156</words>  
Now, on the moon, she was no longer his shadow but her own uncertain light. <words>167</words>  
The greenhouse had been her sanctuary, a place where she could breathe without orders, without surveillance. <words>180</words>  
She’d cultivated more than plants here—she’d nurtured the idea of a timely rebirth. <words>191</words>  
The lunar soil, mixed with Earth’s last seeds, mirrored her own transformation: fragile, deliberate, inevitable. <words>204</words>  
Each morning, she walked the crater’s edge, the Earth a blue ghost on the horizon. <words>216</words>  
She thought of the child in the photo—her daughter, taken from her to ensure obedience. <words>229</words>  
The man had promised safety, but only if Rhea remained his weapon. <words>239</words>  
Now, she was gathering stories again, this time from the whispers of hydroponic engineers and lunar botanists. <words>253</words>  
They spoke of a new charter, one that would ratify freedom for all lunar settlers. <words>265</words>  
Rhea offered her skills not as a bodyguard, but as a protector of truth. <words>276</words>  
She trained others to listen, to collect fragments, to build resistance from roots and rumors. <words>288</words>  
Her anger had not vanished—it had become serene, focused, like the slow growth of a vine toward light. <words>302</words>  
One evening, she placed the photograph beneath a sprouting fig tree, letting the past nourish the future. <words>315</words>  
She whispered her daughter’s name, a promise carried in the greenhouse’s recycled air. <words>326</words>  
The crater’s edge no longer felt like a boundary, but a beginning. <words>336</words>  
And as the stars blinked awake, Rhea stood tall, no longer tense, but ready. <words>347</words>  
She had broken free—not with violence, but with patience, with stories, with stubborn hope. <words>359</words>  
The man’s influence had withered like an unwatered root, irrelevant in this blooming world. <words>371</words>  
Rhea smiled, the first real smile in years, and turned back to the greenhouse. <words>383</words>  
Tomorrow, she would teach the children how to listen, how to grow, how to begin again. <words>396</words>
