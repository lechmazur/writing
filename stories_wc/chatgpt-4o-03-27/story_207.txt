The abandoned space station’s medical bay still smelled faintly of antiseptic and burnt ozone, though no soul had walked its halls in decades. <words>21</words>  
Juno, a forthright peddler with a knack for finding forgotten things, stepped over a collapsed gurney, her boots echoing in the silence. <words>41</words>  
She carried a dried flower bouquet wrapped in faded starlace, its petals brittle but preserved, a relic from a time before her oath. <words>61</words>  
The oath had been sealed in blood—hers and her sister’s—on the day they swore never to return to this place. <words>79</words>  
But the universe hummed its secret song, and Juno had learned to listen between the notes, where redemption whispered. <words>95</words>  
She had come to divide the past from the present, to sift through the wreckage of memory and find the truth. <words>113</words>  
Her meekly assertive nature had always made her the quieter of the two, but now she stood alone, stronger in solitude. <words>131</words>  
The gossip columns she’d scoured across the outer colonies had hinted at survivors, at experiments gone wrong, at her sister’s name. <words>149</words>  
Rumor-laden and half-mad, the stories had led her here, to the place where everything had begun and unraveled. <words>165</words>  
She placed the bouquet on a rusted console, the gesture both offering and apology, petals trembling in the recycled air. <words>183</words>  
Juno remembered the day they’d fled, her sister’s hand slick with blood, the oath spoken through clenched teeth and tears. <words>201</words>  
They had divided their lives then—Juno to the stars, her sister to the shadows of the station’s secrets. <words>215</words>  
Now, she sought to reunite what had been broken, to walk redemption’s path even if it led through ghosts. <words>231</words>  
A flicker of light danced across a cracked monitor, and Juno turned, heart thudding, hope and dread entwined. <words>247</words>  
The screen blinked to life, static forming a face she hadn’t seen in years—older, wearier, but unmistakably her sister. <words>263</words>  
“You came,” the image said, voice thin but steady, as if pulled from the very bones of the station. <words>277</words>  
“I had to,” Juno replied, her voice catching, “I broke the oath to find you.” <words>289</words>  
Her sister smiled, a sad, joyful curve of lips that mirrored Juno’s own loneliness. <words>301</words>  
“I never left,” the image whispered, “I became part of the station, part of its hum.” <words>313</words>  
Juno stepped closer, tears welling, the bouquet’s scent—faint lavender and dust—rising like memory. <words>325</words>  
“I brought these,” she said, touching the screen, “from the garden we planted before everything fell apart.” <words>339</words>  
Her sister’s image flickered, then steadied, as if the flowers bridged the divide between flesh and code. <words>353</words>  
“Then let’s begin again,” the voice said, “not as oathbreakers, but as sisters.” <words>365</words>  
Juno nodded, the joyful loneliness in her chest blooming into something warmer, something whole. <words>377</words>  
Outside, the stars shimmered, and the universe continued its secret song, now with a new harmony. <words>391</words>  
Juno sat beside the console, the bouquet between them, and listened to the melody of redemption. <words>405</words>
