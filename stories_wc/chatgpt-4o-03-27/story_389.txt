When the final calendar page of the year was flipped, the thin-lipped warlock known only as Vellin descended into the abandoned mine with a lantern in one hand and a fragment of a Viking ship’s figurehead in the other. <words>33</words>  
The mine, long forgotten by maps and men, concealed a library whispered about in the footnotes of discredited textbooks—texts Vellin had studied with formally casual interest that masked his feverish obsession. <words>66</words>  
He sought lost artifacts, not for wealth or power, but to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite the warnings etched in blood and ash across the margins of arcane tomes. <words>96</words>  
The figurehead fragment, carved into the snarling face of a sea-dragon, pulsed faintly with a warmth that had no source, guiding him deeper through the mine’s skeletal corridors. <words>123</words>  
Vellin’s boots crunched over brittle bones and rusted rails as he muttered optimization spells—half-remembered incantations meant to sharpen perception and silence doubt. <words>147</words>  
He had read of the library’s location through rumored cures in discredited textbooks, where diagrams of diseased minds were annotated with riddles pointing to this subterranean vault. <words>177</words>  
The deeper he went, the more the air thickened with the scent of mildew and forgotten ink, until he reached a door of petrified wood etched with runes that shimmered like oil. <words>210</words>  
He pressed the figurehead fragment into a hollow at the door’s center, and the runes flared, recognizing the artifact as a key long lost to time and tide. <words>239</words>  
The door groaned open, revealing shelves that spiraled into darkness, each crammed with volumes bound in skin, bark, and metals no longer mined. <words>266</words>  
Vellin stepped inside, his breath catching—not from awe, but from the certainty that he had been here before in dreams he had never admitted aloud. <words>294</words>  
He moved with formally casual grace, fingers trailing over spines that whispered in forgotten dialects, each book a promise of forbidden clarity. <words>319</words>  
He selected a tome titled “The Cartography of Unseen Organs” and opened it to a page that pulsed like a heartbeat, revealing diagrams that mapped the soul’s decay. <words>351</words>  
As he read, the figurehead fragment began to hum, resonating with the knowledge pouring into him, optimizing his mind beyond mortal thresholds. <words>377</words>  
But with each revelation, his body trembled, veins glowing faintly as if inked with starlight, and the library seemed to lean closer, its shelves breathing. <words>405</words>  
He turned another page, and another, gorging on truths that rewrote his memories, until he no longer remembered warnings, only the confusing certainty that he was becoming the library’s next artifact. <words>443</words>  
The final page turned itself, revealing a mirror of ink that showed Vellin’s reflection—thin-lipped, yes, but now with eyes like open books, unreadable and eternal. <words>472</words>  
The door sealed behind him, the figurehead fragment crumbling to dust, its purpose fulfilled, as the mine above collapsed in silence, forgotten once more. <words>496</words>
