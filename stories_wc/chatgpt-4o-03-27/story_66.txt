The cracked mirror in the corner of the greenhouse reflected a face that no longer belonged to any nation, any war, or any name. <words>21</words>  
He had left the uniform behind in a ditch of red clay and silence, a quiet deserter with no destination but away. <words>38</words>  
Now, he worked among the whispering leaves and trembling stems of the plant communication study, where chlorophyll hummed secrets through root networks. <words>56</words>  
The scientists called it “bioacoustic signaling,” but he knew it as something older, something dizzyingly grounded in the earth’s own breath. <words>74</words>  
He spent his days listening, not to orders or gunfire, but to the slow, deliberate language of green things. <words>89</words>  
Each plant, like each person, had a story, and he had learned to reconstruct them from shattered porcelain masks left behind in the soil. <words>110</words>  
The masks were remnants of a forgotten ritual, once used to honor the dead by capturing their final expressions in fragile clay. <words>128</words>  
He pieced them together like jigsaw puzzles, each shard a syllable, each crack a pause, until the story emerged whole again. <words>146</words>  
Through this method, he believed he could carbonize the pain—burn it down to its elemental truth and let it nourish something new. <words>165</words>  
The others in the lab thought him eccentric, a noble fool who spoke to roots and wore gloves stitched from old flags. <words>183</words>  
But he knew what they didn’t: that the plants remembered, and that memory could be rewritten if one listened long enough. <words>200</words>  
He had once tried to belong to a cause, a country, a command, but each had broken him like the mirror in the corner. <words>219</words>  
Now, he sought a place where he truly belonged, even if it was nowhere, even if it was only among the ferns. <words>237</words>  
One evening, while aligning the final pieces of a particularly expressive mask, he heard a vine whisper a name he hadn’t spoken in years. <words>257</words>  
It was his own, or what used to be, and it came not as accusation but as invitation. <words>270</words>  
He pressed his palm to the soil, dizzy with the grounded truth that he had never truly been lost—only waiting to be reassembled. <words>289</words>  
The cracked mirror caught the last light of day, and for a moment, it reflected not a deserter, but a gardener of memory. <words>307</words>  
He smiled, foolishly perhaps, but nobly, as he began to carbonize the final mask, letting its ashes feed the roots of a young sapling. <words>327</words>  
The cycle was breaking—not with violence, but with listening, with care, with the quiet courage to rebuild from what had been shattered. <words>345</words>  
And though he belonged nowhere, he had found a purpose that fit him like soil around a seed. <words>359</words>  
The plants rustled in agreement, their leaves brushing like pages turning, stories unfolding, lives unforgotten. <words>373</words>  
He would stay, not as a soldier, but as a scribe of roots and ruins, a quiet deserter who chose to grow. <words>392</words>  
And in the greenhouse, where mirrors cracked and masks whispered, the cycle finally began to heal. <words>405</words>
