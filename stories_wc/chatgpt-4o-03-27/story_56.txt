The toppled skyscraper groaned in the wind, its steel bones wrapped in ivy and apple trees, reclaimed by time and stubborn roots. <words>21</words>  
Inside, beneath a canopy of glass and moss, Milo adjusted his threadbare blazer, the blank price tag still dangling from the sleeve. <words>42</words>  
He was a bluffing swindler by trade, but today he wasn’t selling lies—he was here to bare a truth no one dared to handle. <words>66</words>  
The orchard buzzed with a strange stillness, like the breath before a confession, and Milo’s steps were energetically lethargic, each one heavy with purpose. <words>89</words>  
He paused beside a rusted elevator shaft, where a makeshift stall sold salvaged tech and bruised fruit, and dropped a book from his coat pocket. <words>112</words>  
It hit the ground with a soft thud, and as he bent to retrieve it, another hand reached down—slender, calloused, and trembling slightly. <words>134</words>  
Their eyes met: hers, sharp and skeptical; his, tired but glinting with mischief—and just like that, the meet-cute unfolded. <words>153</words>  
“I think you dropped your manifesto,” she said, holding up the book with a smirk that didn’t quite reach her eyes. <words>172</words>  
Milo chuckled, brushing dust from his knees. “Or maybe you found it because you were meant to.” <words>187</words>  
She raised an eyebrow. “You always this cryptic, or just when you’re trying to magnetize strangers with charm?” <words>204</words>  
“Only when the stakes are high,” he replied, nodding toward the blinking terminal behind her, frozen for hours until—click—it finally restarted. <words>225</words>  
The screen flickered to life, revealing encrypted files Milo had spent months tracking, files that could unravel the city’s buried sins. <words>246</words>  
She glanced at the screen, then back at him. “You’re not just a drifter, are you?” <words>260</words>  
“No,” he said softly. “I’m a liar who’s tired of lying.” <words>271</words>  
Invisible allies stirred around them—whispers in the leaves, shadows shifting behind broken walls, unseen hands that had guided him here. <words>292</words>  
She hesitated, then handed him the book. “Then let’s tell the truth. Together.” <words>306</words>  
Milo took it, heart pounding with something dangerously close to hope. <words>316</words>  
The orchard seemed to breathe with them, the apples above glowing faintly in the filtered light. <words>332</words>  
He turned to the terminal, fingers hovering over the keys, and began to type. <words>345</words>  
Each word he entered peeled back a layer of the city’s rot, exposing secrets no one wanted unearthed. <words>362</words>  
She stood beside him, silent but steady, her presence a magnet for courage he didn’t know he had. <words>380</words>  
The truth, once buried beneath steel and soil, now bloomed in the orchard’s heart, harsh and gentle as spring frost. <words>402</words>  
And for the first time, Milo didn’t need to bluff—he only needed to be believed. <words>417</words>
