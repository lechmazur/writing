The antique airship creaked like an old violin as it hovered above the hush of an empty playground at twilight. <words>20</words>  
Inside, the mellow bard, Thalen, tuned his lute with fingers calloused by time and softened by songs. <words>34</words>  
His coat, elegantly disheveled, fluttered with each gust that slipped through the cracked brass vents. <words>45</words>  
He had once sung for kings, but now he traveled alone, seeking to resuscitate wonder in jaded eyes. <words>60</words>  
Tonight, he prepared a traditional holiday meal in the galley, the scent of roasted chestnuts and spiced root vegetables curling through the air. <words>78</words>  
He laid the worn wooden ruler beside the cutting board, a relic from his childhood, etched with tiny notches of forgotten songs. <words>96</words>  
The ruler had belonged to his mother, a seamstress who measured dreams in inches and lullabies. <words>108</words>  
As the stew simmered, Thalen hummed a tune that once made children dance and old men weep. <words>120</words>  
He had learned patience not from silence, but from the long pauses between applause. <words>131</words>  
Outside, the playground’s rusted swings swayed gently, as if remembering laughter. <words>141</words>  
Then came the knock—three soft raps on the airship’s hatch, impossible at this altitude. <words>153</words>  
Thalen opened it to find three figures cloaked in twilight: a girl with eyes like stormglass, a boy clutching a broken compass, and an old woman with feathers in her hair. <words>177</words>  
“We smelled your stew,” the girl said, her voice trembling with hunger and something older. <words>189</words>  
Thalen welcomed them in, his heart thudding with joyful terror, for he knew these were no ordinary guests. <words>203</words>  
They sat around the table, steam rising between them like ghosts of forgotten feasts. <words>214</words>  
The boy spoke first, asking if Thalen still remembered the song of the Hollow Star. <words>226</words>  
Thalen nodded, fingers trembling as he reached for his lute, the ruler tapping rhythm beside him. <words>239</words>  
He played, and the airship groaned in harmony, its gears singing along in rusted harmony. <words>251</words>  
The melody overloaded the silence, bursting through the hull and into the twilight below. <words>263</words>  
Lights flickered on in the playground, though no wires ran there, and laughter echoed faintly. <words>275</words>  
The girl wept, the boy smiled, and the old woman whispered, “You’ve remembered.” <words>285</words>  
Thalen’s voice cracked, but he sang on, each note a thread stitching wonder back into the world. <words>299</words>  
The stew was eaten, the ruler passed hand to hand, each guest measuring their own memories. <words>312</words>  
When the meal ended, the guests faded like mist, leaving only feathers, a compass, and a single tear on the ruler. <words>328</words>  
Thalen stood alone again, but the playground below now shimmered with unseen children and invisible games. <words>341</words>  
He had learned patience through years of silence, but tonight, he had found his audience. <words>353</words>  
The airship drifted higher, its antique bones humming with new purpose. <words>362</words>  
Thalen smiled, elegantly disheveled, heart overloaded with joy and terror, and began composing a new song. <words>376</words>  
It would be a song for those who had forgotten how to dream, and those who never had. <words>389</words>  
As twilight deepened, the playground below whispered thanks, and the stars leaned in to listen. <words>401</words>
