The dial tone of an outdated phone finally cut out, its last hum swallowed by the hum of the ship’s failing life support. <words>23</words> 

In the cargo hold of the space pirate ship *Mirthless Mercy*, a wry caretaker named Elgan leaned against a crate of stolen stardust. <words>42</words> 

He was warmly aloof, the kind of man who offered tea in a storm but never asked your name. <words>55</words> 

Elgan drew a line on the metal floor with a piece of chalk, the white mark stark against the rusted steel. <words>70</words> 

Each line marked a moment he’d chosen not to vanish. <words>77</words> 

He tracked time not by clocks, but by the paths of clouds drifting across the observation dome above. <words>91</words> 

Clouds in space were rare—nebulae, really—but they moved like thoughts, slow and full of meaning. <words>104</words> 

He watched them to hush the endless “what if” siren song that haunted the ship’s corridors. <words>117</words> 

The crew had long since gone, vanished one by one, chasing futures that never arrived. <words>129</words> 

Elgan stayed, not out of duty, but because someone had to remember the weight of time. <words>142</words> 

He believed time wasn’t a line but a spiral, looping back on itself like the chalk circles he drew. <words>156</words> 

Each loop was a choice, and each choice a tether to the now. <words>166</words> 

He’d once tried to vanish too, stepping into the airlock with a heart full of silence. <words>179</words> 

But the clouds had shifted, forming a shape like a child’s drawing of a home, and he’d stepped back. <words>194</words> 

Now, he marked the floor with chalk to remember that moment, the one where he chose presence over escape. <words>209</words> 

The ship groaned, metal aching like old bones, and Elgan smiled with gentle harshness. <words>220</words> 

He whispered to the empty hold, “Time’s not chasing us—we’re chasing ghosts.” <words>229</words> 

The chalk snapped in his hand, brittle from use, and he pocketed the stub like a relic. <words>242</words> 

Outside, a new cloud path began to form, curling like smoke from a forgotten fire. <words>254</words> 

Elgan tilted his head, watching it with the reverence of a monk reading scripture. <words>265</words> 

He knew the pattern—it was the same one from the day the captain vanished. <words>276</words> 

That day, the dial tone had cut out too, as if time itself had paused to listen. <words>289</words> 

He stepped forward, chalkless now, but certain. <words>294</words> 

The spiral had looped again, and this time, he would follow the cloud path to its end. <words>308</words> 

Not to vanish, but to understand. <words>313</words> 

To hush the siren song not by silence, but by knowing its tune. <words>324</words> 

The cargo hold dimmed, stars blinking through the dome like ancient eyes. <words>334</words> 

Elgan walked into the spiral, each step a note in a melody only he could hear. <words>347</words> 

Time, he realized, wasn’t cruel—it was curious. <words>354</words> 

And he, the last caretaker, was its final question. <words>362</words> 

When the chalk mark faded, and the dial tone never returned, Elgan was already gone. <words>374</words> 

Not vanished, but transformed—into a story the clouds would carry forever. <words>385</words>
