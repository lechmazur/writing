The observation deck of the derelict space station hung in silence, orbiting a dead Earth where the last tree had long since fallen. <words>21</words>  
Jareth, a shipwrecked merchant with soot-streaked cheeks and a coat stitched from old trade flags, stared through the cracked glass at the ash-gray planet. <words>42</words>  
He had once sold spices and stories between moons, but now he clutched a rustic butter churn like a relic of a forgotten ritual. <words>63</words>  
The churn, oddly pristine, hummed faintly with energy—an honestly strange artifact he’d salvaged from the wreckage of his cargo hold. <words>81</words>  
He didn’t know why he’d kept it, only that it pulsed with the same rebellious sparks that danced behind his tired eyes. <words>101</words>  
The station, abandoned since the Collapse, whispered secrets through its rusted vents and flickering lights, as if remembering the people it once held. <words>121</words>  
Jareth wandered its corridors, guided by instinct and the churn’s subtle vibrations, until he reached the ghost station’s forgotten transit hub. <words>140</words>  
There, a faded travel poster peeled from the wall, its flaking edges curling like fingers pointing upward toward a shaft of dim light. <words>161</words>  
He pressed his palm to the poster, and the wall behind it groaned, revealing a narrow passage that spiraled toward the station’s core. <words>182</words>  
With each step, he ascended via the flaking edges of the travel poster, as if climbing the dreams of a world that no longer dreamed. <words>204</words>  
The churn grew warmer in his arms, its hum deepening into a low thrum that resonated with the station’s bones. <words>222</words>  
At the top, he emerged into a chamber lined with mirrors, each reflecting not his face, but fragments of Earth’s lost forests and skies. <words>243</words>  
He set the churn in the center, and it began to spin, casting flickers of green and blue across the mirrored walls. <words>262</words>  
Jareth spoke aloud, his voice cracking: “Let the illusion shatter.” <words>270</words>  
The churn responded, releasing a pulse that fractured the mirrors, revealing behind them not glass, but windows into alternate timelines. <words>289</words>  
In one, trees still stood; in another, oceans shimmered; in a third, he saw himself never shipwrecked, still trading joy for coin. <words>309</words>  
But he turned away from those temptations, his aloof passion rooted not in nostalgia, but in the need to awaken the sleepers. <words>328</words>  
The churn’s energy surged, and the station trembled, its systems flickering to life for the first time in decades. <words>344</words>  
Screens lit up across the deck, broadcasting the shattered illusion to every remaining outpost, every hidden colony, every soul still watching. <words>364</words>  
Jareth stood tall, no longer a merchant, but a messenger, his honestly strange journey culminating in a single act of defiance. <words>383</words>  
He had ascended not to escape, but to reveal—to ignite the rebellious sparks buried in humanity’s collective heart. <words>400</words>  
And as the churn slowed, its hum fading into silence, he smiled, knowing the illusion was broken and the truth had begun to bloom. <words>421</words>
