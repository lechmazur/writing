The biodome’s artificial sun flickered as Jax Rell bent into a stretch, his breath fogging the glass near the hydroponic kale rows. <words>21</words> 

He was alone, save for the whisper of irrigation tubes and the faint hum of the language recorder strapped to his wrist. <words>39</words> 

Jax, once a notorious trickster lawyer, now lived in exile, cataloguing the last whispers of dying dialects spoken only by AI-augmented livestock. <words>61</words> 

He had chosen this path not out of guilt, but because the world had stopped listening to words unless they were encrypted or extinct. <words>83</words> 

Each morning, during stretching, he received a cryptic dare—always encoded in a leftover gift tag, always from a different high school rival. <words>105</words> 

Today’s tag, wedged between nutrient packs, read: “Divert the irrigation to quadrant 9. Trust the silence.” <words>118</words> 

He sighed, impatiently patient, knowing the dare would lead somewhere, even if the logic unraveled slowly. <words>132</words> 

Jax had learned to wait like a predator, still but coiled, his mind racing while his body obeyed the pace of the dome. <words>153</words> 

He diverted the irrigation as instructed, watching the water snake away from the engineered wheat and toward the neglected quadrant. <words>170</words> 

There, beneath the soil, a panel hissed open, revealing a rusted recorder etched with glyphs from a language thought lost in the Pacific Collapse. <words>192</words> 

He knelt, reverent, and pressed play; a ghostly voice murmured syllables that danced like wind through broken reeds. <words>207</words> 

Jax’s recorder blinked red—new data, unclassified, precious. <words>213</words> 

He smiled, the kind of smile that knew the cost of every word and the weight of every silence. <words>229</words> 

His rivals weren’t enemies anymore; they were co-conspirators in a game only the forgotten could win. <words>243</words> 

Each dare they sent was a breadcrumb, a test, a reminder of the paths they’d all chosen when the world fractured. <words>261</words> 

Jax had chosen exile over trial, truth over comfort, and language over law. <words>271</words> 

The biodome was his courtroom now, the livestock his jury, the vanishing tongues his testimony. <words>285</words> 

He stretched again, bones creaking like old floorboards, and whispered the new syllables to himself until they felt like his own. <words>303</words> 

Outside, the world burned or froze or forgot, but inside, Jax preserved what mattered. <words>316</words> 

He was a trickster still, but now his tricks saved voices instead of silencing them. <words>330</words> 

The gift tag fluttered in the recycled breeze, its ink fading, its message complete. <words>343</words> 

Jax tucked it into his journal, beside dozens of others, each a step on a path only he could walk. <words>361</words> 

He didn’t know where it ended, but he knew why he walked it. <words>373</words> 

And that was enough. <words>376</words>
