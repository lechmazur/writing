The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, clutching a flask of something that smelled like regret and rosemary. <words>20</words>  
He had brewed it himself, of course, in a fit of inspiration and insomnia, hoping to distill his values into something drinkable. <words>39</words>  
The protest had paused—just a lull, really—but the voices were gathering again, murmuring like wind through cracked tombstones. <words>55</words>  
He wasn’t here for the protest, not directly; he was here to become the living embodiment of his values, whatever that meant anymore. <words>75</words>  
The mansion loomed ahead, its windows like hollow eyes, and the graveyard whispered secrets in a language only the half-drunk could understand. <words>92</words>  
He reached the spiral staircase, its iron spine coiled in dust and disuse, and noticed the slightest discoloration on one of the steps. <words>110</words>  
That was the method, he remembered—the discoloration was the signal to initiate the ritual, subtle as a sigh in a sermon. <words>127</words>  
He knelt, placing a piece of a broken mirror on the step, its jagged edge catching the moonlight like a smirk. <words>144</words>  
The mirror had once belonged to his grandmother, who claimed it showed not reflections but intentions, and he needed clarity now. <words>160</words>  
As he stared into the shard, the encroaching darkness began to seep from the corners of the graveyard, slow and deliberate. <words>177</words>  
It wasn’t just nightfall—it was something older, something uniquely generic, like a fear everyone had but no one could name. <words>194</words>  
The brewer laughed, a dry chuckle that echoed off mausoleums, because of course the darkness would be blandly terrifying. <words>209</words>  
He took a swig from his flask, the rosemary burning his throat, and whispered, “Let’s get on with it, then.” <words>224</words>  
The mirror shimmered, showing not his face but a version of himself with eyes like extinguished stars and a spine of vines. <words>241</words>  
This was who he could become—if he let go of pretense, of comfort, of the illusion that brewing was just a trade. <words>259</words>  
The darkness reached the staircase, curling around his boots like smoke, and he stood, flask in one hand, mirror in the other. <words>276</words>  
He stepped upward, each footfall a vow, each breath a distillation of belief, the spiral staircase groaning beneath his resolve. <words>291</words>  
Outside, the protest voices rose again, a chorus of defiance and fatigue, and he felt their rhythm in his bones. <words>306</words>  
He would return to them—not as a brewer, not as a ghost, but as something in between, something necessary. <words>321</words>  
At the top of the staircase, the door opened without touch, and the darkness paused, as if waiting for his lead. <words>337</words>  
He turned once more to the mirror, saw only the sky, and smiled with flippant solemnity. <words>349</words>  
Then he stepped through, initiating the rest of his life. <words>356</words>  
Behind him, the graveyard exhaled, and the mansion began to hum. <words>365</words>  
The protest swelled, and somewhere within it, a new voice joined—uniquely generic, unmistakably his. <words>380</words>
