The orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls was not on any map, but the blank-faced performer arrived there every dusk, precisely when the piano practice began. <words>26</words>  
He carried no sheet music, only a plain plastic ring looped around his finger, dull and colorless, yet humming faintly with the weight of unspoken things. <words>51</words>  
Each note he played echoed through the fern-fringed air, not as sound, but as shifting symbols only visible to those who had once dreamed in another tongue. <words>78</words>  
He was the guardian of rumors, a title not bestowed but inherited through silence, and his duty was to approve which whispers became truths. <words>102</words>  
This approval came not by decree, but by tracking moon paths across the waterfall mist, where the lunar reflections tangled with the orchard’s breath. <words>126</words>  
The performer’s face, blank as a mask carved from fog, betrayed no emotion, yet his fingers trembled with the urgency of his secret purpose. <words>150</words>  
He was uniquely typical—so ordinary in appearance that no one ever remembered him, which made him perfect for guarding the fragile architecture of belief. <words>175</words>  
The plain plastic ring was his only inheritance, passed down from a predecessor who vanished mid-note, swallowed by a rumor too potent to contain. <words>200</words>  
Each evening, as the piano keys whispered their coded language, he listened for the dreams hidden in the harmonics, trying to decipher their grammar. <words>225</words>  
He believed that if he could learn the language of dreams, he might finally speak to the moon itself and ask why it watched him. <words>251</words>  
The waterfalls roared like forgotten gods, drowning out all but the most persistent melodies, and still he played, fingers bleeding into the ivory. <words>274</words>  
One night, a new rumor arrived, carried on the back of a moth with wings like torn parchment, and it hovered above middle C. <words>299</words>  
The performer paused, sensing the weight of it, and struck the key gently, releasing a note that shimmered like a blade in moonlight. <words>322</words>  
The rumor unfolded: a dreamer had spoken in their sleep of a place where ferns whispered back, and the moon answered in riddles. <words>345</words>  
He tracked the moon’s path that night with the ring pressed to his eye, watching as it aligned with a waterfall’s crest at midnight. <words>370</words>  
The alignment approved the rumor, and the orchard shifted—ferns bowed, waterfalls paused, and the moth dissolved into a single word: “Begin.” <words>393</words>  
He understood then that the language of dreams was not spoken, but played, and that each rumor was a note in a symphony of becoming. <words>419</words>  
With precise madness, he played until dawn, the orchard listening, the moon nodding, and the ring glowing faintly with every truth he dared to believe. <words>444</words>  
And though his face remained blank, his music wept, laughed, and screamed, telling stories only the dreaming could hear, and only the moon could approve. <words>470</words>  
In that orchard of giant ferns, beneath the waterfalls’ hush, the blank-faced performer finally began to dream in his own language. <words>492</words>
