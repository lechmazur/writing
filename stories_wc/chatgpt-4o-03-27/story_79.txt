Sheriff Eliah Grange stepped into the scientific poetry library during the midday lull when time feels suspended, the dust motes hanging like frozen stars in the shafts of light. <words>26</words>  
He removed his hat, revealing silvering hair and eyes that had seen too much silence, too many endings. <words>39</words>  
The library, a cathedral of equations and verse, hummed with the echo of quiet—an absence so profound it felt like presence. <words>53</words>  
He walked past shelves where Newton’s laws met Neruda’s longing, where black holes rhymed with broken hearts. <words>65</words>  
In his pocket, the tarnished silver chain coiled like a memory refusing to fade, its links cold and ethereally physical. <words>78</words>  
It had belonged to his daughter, Lissa, who vanished one year ago under a sky that bled meteors. <words>89</words>  
They said she rebelled, ran off chasing stardust and theories, but Eliah knew better—she had followed the path of falling stars. <words>104</words>  
He traced her steps now, not with boots on dirt, but with fingertips on vellum and ink, decoding her trail in stanzas and star charts. <words>120</words>  
Each poem she left behind was a breadcrumb, a cipher, a note in a symphony meant to defeat an entire dirge of despair. <words>134</words>  
He paused before a display case where her final poem lay, etched into a copper plate, the words trembling with ghostly resolve. <words>147</words>  
“Where silence sings, I’ll be,” it read, “where gravity forgets, I’ll rise.” <words>155</words>  
Eliah closed his eyes and listened—not with ears, but with the ache in his chest, the place where her lullabies once lived. <words>169</words>  
The echo of quiet answered, not empty, but full of her—her laughter, her questions, her defiance. <words>181</words>  
He unclasped the silver chain and laid it on the copper plate, a bridge between the physical and the vanished. <words>193</words>  
The air shimmered, not with heat, but with presence, as if the library itself exhaled her name. <words>204</words>  
Books rustled without wind, pages turned by unseen hands, and Eliah felt her—ethereally physical, like a thought made flesh. <words>217</words>  
He whispered, “I hear you,” and the tarnish on the chain brightened, a single note rising from metal and memory. <words>229</words>  
It rang through the library, soft but unyielding, a rebellion against forgetting, a melody that refused to mourn. <words>241</words>  
Eliah stood straighter, the weight of grief lifting as the note lingered, defeating the dirge that had haunted him. <words>253</words>  
He turned and walked out, the echo of quiet now a companion, not a curse. <words>263</words>  
Above him, the sky held no stars, but he knew where to find them—in verse, in silence, in her. <words>276</words>  
And as he stepped into the light, the midday lull broke, time resumed, and the sheriff smiled. <words>287</words>  
He had rebelled—not with guns or law, but by tracing the path of falling stars to find a daughter lost to wonder. <words>302</words>  
In doing so, he let a single note—hers—defeat an entire dirge. <words>311</words>  
And in that note, he found peace. <words>316</words>
