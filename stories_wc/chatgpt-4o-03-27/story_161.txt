Ever since the accident that claimed his twin brother during a botched pesticide trial, Malcolm Virelli, a vigilant orchardist with a penchant for punctuality, had volunteered at the government’s paper airplane test facility to unravel what he suspected was a conspiracy buried beneath layers of bureaucracy and balsa wood. <words>41</words> 

He arrived every morning at 6:59 a.m. sharp, never tardy, his boots echoing through the hangar like a metronome of suspicion. <words>58</words> 

The facility, a cavernous relic of Cold War paranoia, now served as a playground for engineers obsessed with aerodynamics and plausible deniability. <words>75</words> 

Malcolm, ostensibly there to assist with folding techniques, spent his hours observing the patterns in the peacock’s tail feathers painted on the test planes—each swirl and eye a code he believed pointed to something darker. <words>101</words> 

He had once read that peacocks were sacred to Hera, goddess of secrets, and he took sardonic glee in imagining the engineers as unwitting priests of a paper cult. <words>123</words> 

His only clue was an antique letter seal he’d found in his brother’s effects, etched with a sigil that matched the tail pattern on a prototype glider dubbed “Project Plumage.” <words>144</words> 

The seal, heavy and cold, bore the initials “A.R.” and a stylized orchard tree—an emblem Malcolm had never seen before his brother’s death. <words>162</words> 

He began to demonstrate increasingly elaborate folding techniques, each one subtly incorporating the sigil, hoping to provoke a reaction from the engineers. <words>180</words> 

One afternoon, while demonstrating a reverse delta fold to a distracted intern, Malcolm noticed a senior technician blanch at the sight of the seal’s imprint on a test wing. <words>202</words> 

The technician, a man named Rourke with a limp and a fondness for lemon drops, dropped his clipboard and muttered, “Not again.” <words>218</words> 

That night, Malcolm followed Rourke to a locked sub-hangar labeled “Aerodynamic Research—Restricted,” where he watched through a vent as men in lab coats discussed “orchard vectors” and “aerial dispersal ethics.” <words>243</words> 

It was then he understood: the paper planes were prototypes for pesticide delivery systems, and his brother had died testing an early version. <words>261</words> 

The patterns in the peacock’s tail weren’t just decorative—they were chemical dispersal maps, encoded in art to evade scrutiny. <words>276</words> 

With sardonic glee, Malcolm began folding a new model, one that would demonstrate the truth to the world via a public test flight. <words>294</words> 

He volunteered to launch it during the facility’s annual open house, where dignitaries and press would be present. <words>308</words> 

As the plane soared, its tail unfurled mid-air, revealing the sigil and a trail of harmless colored powder that mapped the dispersal pattern. <words>328</words> 

Gasps rippled through the crowd as the powder formed the orchard tree emblem in the sky, a silent accusation. <words>344</words> 

Rourke was escorted out in handcuffs, and Malcolm, though still grieving, felt the first breeze of closure. <words>359</words> 

He returned to his orchard, pruning with renewed purpose, the antique letter seal now mounted above his workbench as a reminder. <words>377</words> 

The conspiracy had unraveled, not with a bang, but with a whisper of paper wings and the vigilance of a never-tardy orchardist. <words>395</words>
