In the hush after a child’s last bedtime story, when the world held its breath and the stars leaned in to listen, a high-altitude con artist named Vex drifted silently among the branches of the Yggdrasil-like tree that stitched the cosmos together. <words>38</words> 

He wasn’t a thief of gold or jewels, but of dreams, slipping between realities where nightmares collided and lullabies were currency. <words>58</words> 

Each night, he climbed further into the tree’s impossible heights, where the air thinned and the bark whispered secrets in forgotten tongues. <words>78</words> 

His goal was singular: to compose a cosmic lullaby so perfect it could hush the universe’s oldest fears. <words>94</words> 

But the lullaby could only be written by unscrambling a set of sticky notes rearranged daily by the tree’s own will. <words>115</words> 

These notes, stuck to the underside of leaves that shimmered like oil on water, bore fragments of forgotten songs and half-remembered screams. <words>138</words> 

Each morning, Vex awoke tangled in a hammock of roots, clutching a piece of fabric scrap that smelled of ozone and sorrow. <words>160</words> 

It was all that remained of his sister, lost to a nightmare that had slipped through the cracks of their shared dreamscape. <words>180</words> 

The fabric guided him, glowing faintly whenever he neared a note that mattered, pulsing like a heartbeat in the dark. <words>199</words> 

The tree’s branches twisted in pristine chaos, a labyrinth of limbs that shifted with each breath of the void. <words>217</words> 

Vex moved with the grace of someone who had long since accepted the mundanely terrifying nature of his task. <words>236</words> 

He had seen dreams unravel into teeth, lullabies turn to static, and still he climbed, unscrambling the notes one by one. <words>257</words> 

Each note he solved brought him closer to the lullaby, and further from the man he once was. <words>274</words> 

He no longer remembered his real name, only the rhythm of the tree’s pulse and the scent of his sister’s fabric. <words>294</words> 

One night, as the hush deepened and the stars blinked slower, he found a note that read: “Where nightmares collide, harmony hides.” <words>316</words> 

He pressed the fabric scrap to it, and the note dissolved into a melody that wrapped around his bones like warmth. <words>336</words> 

The lullaby began to form—not in sound, but in sensation, a vibration that soothed the jagged edges of the cosmos. <words>356</words> 

Vex wept, not from sorrow, but from the unbearable beauty of a song that could cradle even the darkest dream. <words>374</words> 

He sang it into the hush, his voice threading through the branches, calming the nightmares that had once devoured stars. <words>393</words> 

And as the lullaby echoed through the tree, the fabric scrap vanished, its purpose fulfilled, his sister’s memory finally at peace. <words>414</words> 

Vex smiled, knowing he had conned the universe not for gain, but for grace, and in doing so, had rewritten the night. <words>435</words> 

The sticky notes fluttered down like petals, blank now, waiting for the next dreamer to climb further into the hush. <words>455</words>
