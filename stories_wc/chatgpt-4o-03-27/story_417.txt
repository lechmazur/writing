The jungle had swallowed the manor whole, but the Victorian parlor inside remained untouched, as if time had politely knocked and been refused entry. <words>23</words>  
Dust floated like ghosts above velvet chairs, and the scent of damp orchids clung to the heavy drapes, which muffled the cries of unseen birds. <words>45</words>  
Here, during studying hours, Brother Calix sat cross-legged on a moth-eaten rug, surrounded by books he never opened and maps he never followed. <words>66</words>  
He was an unhinged zealot, not by choice but by revelation, convinced that the jungle whispered truths only he could decipher. <words>85</words>  
In his trembling hand, he clutched a plain metal bottle cap, the relic of a forgotten soda, which he believed held the final unspoken agreement. <words>108</words>  
Theoretically playful in design, the cap bore no markings, yet Calix insisted it was the seal of a covenant between man and vine. <words>129</words>  
He had once tried to explain this to the others, but they had laughed, until he uprooted the rosewood piano and hurled it into the underbrush. <words>153</words>  
Now, no one laughed, and no one entered the parlor except for Elira, the only one who understood the strength in vulnerability. <words>174</words>  
She came each dusk, during the hour of study, not to learn but to listen, her presence a whispered confession in a dark room. <words>195</words>  
“Tell me again,” she said one evening, her voice barely louder than the rustling leaves beyond the cracked windowpane. <words>210</words>  
Calix’s eyes gleamed with fevered light as he held up the bottle cap like a priest with a chalice. <words>226</words>  
“This,” he whispered, “was left by the First Botanist, who made peace with the jungle through silence and surrender.” <words>243</words>  
Elira nodded solemnly, though she knew the cap had likely come from a crate of supplies dropped decades ago. <words>259</words>  
Still, she believed in the ritual, in the absurdity that felt more honest than reason. <words>271</words>  
Calix leaned closer, his breath smelling of moss and ink. <words>280</words>  
“They uprooted themselves,” he said, “left their roots behind to become part of the canopy.” <words>293</words>  
Elira reached out and touched his hand, grounding him. <words>301</words>  
“I think,” she said, “that’s what you’re trying to do too.” <words>311</words>  
He blinked, the mania in his eyes softening into something almost human. <words>322</words>  
“Yes,” he said, voice cracking, “but I don’t know how.” <words>333</words>  
She smiled, not with pity but with recognition. <words>340</words>  
“Then let’s study it together,” she said, and for the first time, he let the bottle cap fall. <words>357</words>  
It landed with a soft clink on the rug, insignificant and holy. <words>368</words>  
Outside, the jungle sighed, as if acknowledging the unspoken agreement between madness and mercy. <words>382</words>  
In the absurdity of their shared delusion, they found a kind of truth that no textbook could offer. <words>398</words>  
And in that Victorian parlor, swallowed by green and time, two souls studied not facts, but the fragile strength of being seen. <words>418</words>
