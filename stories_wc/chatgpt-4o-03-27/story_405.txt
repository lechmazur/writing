The underground mushroom farm buzzed with a frantic peace, its bioluminescent caps casting a soft glow over the damp stone walls. <words>21</words>  
Jasper, a skeptical gambler with a knack for truthfully lying, crouched beside a crate of lion’s mane fungi, muttering to himself. <words>39</words>  
He wasn’t here for mushrooms or recipes—though the air was thick with the scent of garlic and thyme from ongoing recipe testing. <words>56</words>  
He was here because of the scrawls—cryptic messages etched into subway seats that only he seemed to understand. <words>71</words>  
Each message led him deeper underground, past impounded train cars and forgotten tunnels, toward something he couldn’t name. <words>86</words>  
He carried a small tin in his coat pocket, a collection of dried petals from flowers he couldn’t remember picking. <words>102</words>  
They were tokens, he believed, from travelers he’d guided to safety—though he never saw them again after they vanished into the dark. <words>121</words>  
Jasper didn’t believe in fate, but he believed in patterns, and the scrawls had never lied to him—only twisted the truth. <words>139</words>  
He’d once told a woman her brother was alive, knowing full well he wasn’t, because the scrawl had said, “Hope is the only map.” <words>160</words>  
Now, the latest message read: “Grief grows where mushrooms bloom—follow the scent of rosemary.” <words>172</words>  
He sniffed the air, caught the herbal note, and moved past the recipe station where a chef stirred a bubbling pot of mushroom stew. <words>191</words>  
The chef didn’t look up; no one ever did when Jasper passed, as if they sensed the uncharted grief trailing behind him. <words>210</words>  
He followed the rosemary trail to a locked door marked “Impounded Equipment – Authorized Personnel Only.” <words>223</words>  
With a flick of his wrist, he picked the lock—another gambler’s trick—and stepped into a room filled with confiscated gear and silence. <words>242</words>  
In the center stood a girl, no older than ten, clutching a stuffed rabbit and blinking at him through tears. <words>258</words>  
“You’re not supposed to be here,” she whispered. <words>263</words>  
“Neither are you,” Jasper replied, kneeling and offering her a petal from his tin. <words>275</words>  
She took it, and something in her eyes shifted—recognition, maybe, or the first flicker of trust. <words>288</words>  
“I followed the drawings,” she said. “On the seats. They told me to find the man who lies truthfully.” <words>304</words>  
Jasper chuckled, a sound like gravel. “Then you found him.” <words>311</words>  
He took her hand, and together they retraced the path through the mushroom-lit corridors, past the chefs and the scrawled messages. <words>329</words>  
Each step echoed with the weight of grief neither could name, but both could carry. <words>341</words>  
At the surface, dawn broke like a promise, and Jasper handed her off to a waiting woman with tear-streaked cheeks. <words>357</words>  
He didn’t stay for thanks; he never did. <words>363</words>  
Instead, he returned underground, where the next scrawl waited, and the petals in his tin rustled like memories. <words>378</words>  
He wasn’t a hero, just a gambler chasing patterns, lying truthfully to make the world a little less lost. <words>394</words>  
And in the frantic peace of the mushroom farm, he found purpose in guiding others through their uncharted grief. <words>409</words>
