The nervous minstrel stood at the edge of the glowing promenade, where the bacteria-powered city hummed with a low, bioluminescent pulse. <words>21</words>  
His fingers trembled over the strings of his lute, not from cold, but from the weight of a crumpled photograph in his pocket. <words>39</words>  
It showed a smiling girl with ink-stained fingers, someone he once pretended to love, though sincerity had never come easily to him. <words>56</words>  
He had left her behind, not out of cruelty, but because the ordinary life she offered felt like a cage. <words>71</words>  
Now, beneath the dome of artificial stars, he sought escape—not from her, but from the hollowness that followed. <words>85</words>  
The city ran on engineered microbes, its streets lit by colonies that fed on waste and glowed in return, a marvel of science and desperation. <words>104</words>  
He wandered these alleys nightly, playing half-hearted tunes for coin, his songs rarely sincere, his smile even less so. <words>118</words>  
But tonight, something stirred—a pattern in the stars above, not real stars, but projections mapped from ancient constellations. <words>132</words>  
He remembered a tale his grandmother once told: that if you followed the right star pattern, you could deploy your soul into purpose. <words>149</words>  
With cautious revelry, he traced the constellation of the Serpent’s Path, its tail curling toward the city’s forgotten edge. <words>162</words>  
He walked, lute slung over his back, the photograph clenched in his fist, the candle in his rented room burning low. <words>177</words>  
He had until it guttered out to find something—anything—that made the ache inside him make sense. <words>189</words>  
The path led him to a dome where children painted with light, their laughter echoing like wind chimes in the sterile air. <words>204</words>  
One girl, no older than ten, asked him to play, her eyes wide with wonder, not expectation. <words>216</words>  
He hesitated, then sat and played—not a song for coin, but one from memory, raw and unpolished. <words>229</words>  
The children danced, their shadows flickering like moths, and for the first time, his music felt like truth. <words>241</words>  
He unfolded the photograph and set it beside him, letting the girl’s smile watch over the moment. <words>253</words>  
The candle in his mind flickered, not with despair, but with fragile hope. <words>262</words>  
He had deployed his soul, not into fame or fortune, but into connection, however fleeting. <words>274</words>  
As the artificial stars dimmed for the city’s nightly rest, he whispered thanks to the pattern that led him here. <words>288</words>  
He was still a nervous minstrel, still rarely sincere, but tonight, he had escaped the ordinary. <words>300</words>  
And in a world of uncertainty, that was enough to begin again. <words>309</words>
