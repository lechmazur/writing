Each morning, amid the dew-slick cobblestones of the old quarter, Elias took his walk, passing shuttered bakeries and the scent of burnt sage wafting from the witch’s incantation chamber tucked behind the apothecary. <words>33</words>  
He walked not for health, but for penance, his steps echoing the names he’d falsified in family trees sold to desperate clients seeking noble blood. <words>55</words>  
Elias had once been an archivist, but the black market paid better, and guilt, he’d learned, was a slow-burning currency. <words>72</words>  
Now, he carried a chipped bowl in his satchel, the last remnant of his mother’s kitchen, its fracture a mirror of his own. <words>93</words>  
He’d stolen her legacy too, rewriting her lineage to impress a client, and she’d died before he could confess. <words>110</words>  
The witch’s incantation chamber, with its walls of dried herbs and whispering candles, had become his sanctuary, a place where he could zoom in on the truth. <words>134</words>  
Not through spells, but by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, which the witch collected like others did coins. <words>151</words>  
Each eulogy was a map of grief and omission, and Elias read them with the precision of a surgeon, seeking patterns, regrets, and hidden truths. <words>175</words>  
He was an atypically typical man—neither hero nor villain, just someone who’d made too many wrong turns and now sought a path back. <words>197</words>  
The witch, who never asked for payment, only silence, let him work in the mornings, when the chamber was quiet and the air still held dreams. <words>221</words>  
One morning, he found a eulogy that mentioned a name he’d forged years ago, a child who never existed but was mourned as if she had. <words>245</words>  
The words were raw, unfiltered, and they cracked something in him deeper than the bowl’s porcelain. <words>259</words>  
He wept, not for the lie, but for the love someone had poured into it, believing it real. <words>275</words>  
That day, he left the bowl on the witch’s altar, a modest offering, brazen in its vulnerability. <words>291</words>  
He began writing letters to the families he’d deceived, not to explain, but to acknowledge, to name the harm. <words>308</words>  
Each letter was a step, each truth a stone laid on the path to self-forgiveness. <words>321</words>  
The witch never spoke, but one morning, she placed a sprig of rosemary in his hand—a symbol of remembrance and renewal. <words>343</words>  
Elias smiled, the first real one in years, and walked out into the morning light, no longer hiding from it. <words>362</words>  
He was still a man of shadows, but now he moved toward the brink of renewal, not away from it. <words>380</words>  
And in the quiet between footsteps, he heard something like forgiveness whispering through the cobblestones. <words>395</words>
