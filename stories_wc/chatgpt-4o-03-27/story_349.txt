The wind whispered through the broken dome of the abandoned observatory, where Elias, a drone pilot from another world, stared out at the orchard below, its trees trembling in the hush before their execution. <words>33</words> 

He had crash-landed here months ago, his drone shattered, his world unreachable, and now he lived among stone walls and starlit silence, a stranger in a realm of magic and myth. <words>66</words> 

The locals called him Sky-Eye, a name born from awe and suspicion, and though he wore their tunics and ate their bread, he remained a man apart. <words>91</words> 

He clutched a dried herb bundle in his hand, gifted by a hedge-witch who claimed it would ward off despair, though Elias suspected it was more ritual than remedy. <words>119</words> 

Still, he kept it close, its scent of sage and lavender grounding him when the stars above looked too much like home. <words>139</words> 

He remembered the speed dating event that had brought him here—an experimental VR simulation meant to disseminate emotional compatibility data across dimensions. <words>162</words> 

He’d laughed at the absurdity, cynically hopeful that maybe, just maybe, he’d meet someone who understood the ache behind his sarcasm. <words>185</words> 

Instead, the simulation had glitched, and he’d awakened in this world of dragons, dusk, and dying orchards. <words>204</words> 

Now, as the villagers prepared to cut down the orchard—believing it cursed—Elias stood watch, unwilling to let beauty vanish without protest. <words>229</words> 

He had seen the trees bloom under moonlight, their blossoms glowing like embers, and he believed they held something sacred, something misunderstood. <words>255</words> 

He began to disseminate his theory among the villagers, using sketches, gestures, and broken phrases to explain that mercy could be a horizon, not a weakness. <words>284</words> 

They listened, wary but curious, drawn by the fire in his voice and the strange maps he drew of root systems and star paths. <words>309</words> 

One night, a girl named Lira approached him, her eyes reflecting the orchard’s glow, and said, “Show me what you see.” <words>332</words> 

Together, they climbed the observatory, and he spoke of possibility teetering on the brink of despair, of how even a lost man could find purpose in saving something others had given up on. <words>370</words> 

When dawn came, the villagers stood before the trees, axes lowered, and Lira stepped forward with Elias, holding the herb bundle high like a banner of belief. <words>400</words> 

The orchard was spared, not by force, but by the quiet conviction of a man who had once flown above worlds and now walked among them, seeking mercy in every horizon. <words>435</words>
