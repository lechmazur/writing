In the hush of an empty classroom at first light, Marlow dipped his brush into a jar of ochre and stared at the canvas with eyes that hadn’t closed in three days. <words>27</words>  
He was an insomniac painter, not by choice but by necessity, for sleep brought dreams he could no longer bear. <words>45</words>  
His arboreal workshop, suspended among giant mushrooms that glowed faintly with bioluminescent spores, swayed gently in the morning breeze. <words>66</words>  
The place was peacefully chaotic—canvases leaned like drunken philosophers, paint dripped from the ceiling, and a cat named Thistle slept in a teacup. <words>89</words>  
Marlow’s latest obsession was a tapered wizard’s hat with a bullet hole through its crown, which he’d found beside a puddle that never dried. <words>113</words>  
He believed the hat belonged to the last true magician, a man who’d vanished after claiming he could devour sorrow itself. <words>132</words>  
Marlow didn’t want to devour sorrow—he wanted to outlast the final obstacle: the truth behind the painted smiles he’d been creating for years. <words>155</words>  
Each portrait he painted wore a grin, but behind those smiles were secrets he never intended to reveal. <words>172</words>  
He’d learned to scry in puddles after midnight, watching reflections twist into visions that whispered what his subjects dared not say aloud. <words>195</words>  
Last night, the puddle beneath the hat had shown him his own face, grinning like a marionette, eyes hollow with frolicsome regret. <words>218</words>  
He’d laughed then, a brittle sound, and painted until the sun threatened to rise. <words>231</words>  
Now, in the classroom’s hush, he added the final stroke to a canvas that depicted the hat atop a faceless figure. <words>252</words>  
The figure stood among mushrooms, arms outstretched, as if offering the bullet hole like a gift. <words>267</words>  
Marlow stepped back, heart thudding, and whispered, “Is this the end, or the beginning?” <words>281</words>  
The puddle at his feet shimmered, and in it, he saw the classroom dissolve into spores and laughter. <words>299</words>  
He reached down, touched the water, and felt it devour his reflection, leaving only the hat behind. <words>316</words>  
Thistle stirred in the teacup, blinked once, and leapt onto the windowsill, tail flicking with knowing indifference. <words>334</words>  
Outside, the mushrooms pulsed with light, and the workshop creaked as if exhaling a long-held breath. <words>351</words>  
Marlow smiled—not painted this time, but real—and let the brush fall from his hand. <words>367</words>  
He walked into the canvas, into the chaos, into the truth he’d always feared but finally embraced. <words>386</words>  
Behind the painted smiles, he had found himself—not whole, but honest—and that was enough to outlast the final obstacle. <words>408</words>  
The puddle stilled, the hat vanished, and the classroom filled with the soft sound of morning. <words>424</words>  
And somewhere, in the hush, a new canvas waited. <words>432</words>
