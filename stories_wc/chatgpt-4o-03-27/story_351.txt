The ivy-choked arches of the disused railway station whispered with the hush of forgotten departures. <words>14</words>  
A brass sundial, half-buried in moss, caught the last light of dusk like a secret. <words>28</words>  
Elias, a dreamy poet with ink-stained fingers and a heart full of vanished names, stood motionless before it. <words>42</words>  
He had followed riddles etched into old journals, scrawled in margins, and murmured in sleep, each one leading here. <words>56</words>  
The final riddle had dissolved in his mind only moments ago, like sugar in warm tea. <words>68</words>  
Now, the silence around him felt like breath held too long. <words>76</words>  
He reached into his coat and withdrew the unopened letter, its wax seal marked with cryptic shapes. <words>89</words>  
The seal was not merely ornamental—it compelled him, as if the symbols themselves whispered in forgotten tongues. <words>103</words>  
He had once been formally rebellious, defying the academy’s rigid poetics with verses that bled and burned. <words>116</words>  
But this—this was rebellion of another kind: to stand by the unremembered, to give voice to the erased. <words>130</words>  
He cracked the seal, and the letter unfolded like a sigh, revealing a single line: “Undo what time has done.” <words>145</words>  
The sundial shimmered faintly, its gnomon casting no shadow despite the fading sun. <words>155</words>  
Elias knelt, brushing away the moss, revealing etched coordinates and a name: “Liora.” <words>166</words>  
She had been a poet too, once, her verses banned, her memory scrubbed from the archives. <words>178</words>  
They had corresponded in ciphered stanzas, their words dancing between rebellion and reverence. <words>189</words>  
Her last letter had never arrived—until now. <words>195</words>  
He placed the letter on the sundial, aligning the cryptic seal with the engraved name. <words>206</words>  
The ground trembled softly, and the ivy recoiled as if startled awake. <words>215</words>  
A hidden stairwell yawned open beneath the platform, exhaling the scent of old paper and rust. <words>227</words>  
Elias descended, each step echoing like a heartbeat in a cathedral of silence. <words>238</words>  
Below, a chamber bloomed with forgotten manuscripts, their pages fluttering in unseen wind. <words>249</words>  
In the center stood a pedestal, and upon it, a second sundial—this one of obsidian. <words>261</words>  
He understood then: this was not resurrection, but a delicate undoing of erasure. <words>271</words>  
To remember was to rebel; to speak her name was to defy oblivion. <words>281</words>  
He whispered, “Liora,” and the chamber pulsed with quiet intensity, as if the walls themselves exhaled relief. <words>294</words>  
The sundial turned, casting a shadow backward, unspooling time like thread from a spindle. <words>306</words>  
Verses long buried rose in the air, forming constellations of ink and breath. <words>317</words>  
Elias wept—not from sorrow, but from the weight of remembrance finally shared. <words>328</words>  
He would remain here, guardian of the unremembered, compelled by love and the cryptic seal of fate. <words>341</words>  
Above, the ivy resumed its slow embrace, but now it cradled memory instead of hiding it. <words>353</words>  
The railway station, once forgotten, now hummed with the quiet intensity of reclaimed truth. <words>365</words>  
And Elias, dreamy and defiant, wrote her name again and again into the air. <words>377</words>  
Each letter a rebellion, each word a delicate undoing of silence. <words>387</words>  
The sundial gleamed, brass and obsidian in harmony, marking not hours, but echoes. <words>399</words>
