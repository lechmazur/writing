The glass-walled observatory clung to the ocean cliff like a barnacle, its windows fogged with salt and secrets. <words>17</words>  
Inside, a sapped herbalist named Elenor slumped over a moss-stained journal, her fingers stained with tincture and time. <words>34</words>  
She had once cherished the art of healing, but now she only studied tide patterns, her passion eroded by years of unmet expectations. <words>52</words>  
The observatory had been built by her late mentor, who believed the sea’s rhythm held the key to botanical perfection. <words>68</words>  
Elenor, thoughtfully thoughtless in her routines, traced the flight path of a lone goose across the sky, noting its angle against the waves. <words>87</words>  
She recorded the moment in her journal, not because it mattered, but because it might. <words>97</words>  
The bellows of a blacksmith, rusted and out of place, sat beside her, repurposed to fan drying herbs in the salt-heavy air. <words>115</words>  
Its wheeze reminded her of her own breath—strained, mechanical, and necessary. <words>124</words>  
She had dragged it up the cliff herself, believing that perfection required tools as much as knowledge. <words>136</words>  
But perfection had a price, and she had paid it in solitude, in the slow draining of her spirit. <words>149</words>  
During napping hours, when the world softened and the sea whispered, she remained awake, charting the tides with a fervent indifference. <words>165</words>  
She no longer believed the patterns would reveal anything, but she couldn’t stop. <words>174</words>  
The observatory creaked as the wind shifted, and the goose returned, circling once before vanishing into the mist. <words>188</words>  
Elenor’s eyes followed it, her heart aching with a longing she refused to name. <words>198</words>  
She remembered how her mentor used to say, “Cherish the imperfect—it’s where life hides.” <words>209</words>  
But Elenor had chased perfection instead, and now she was alone with her charts, her bellows, and her brittle herbs. <words>224</words>  
A sudden gust slammed against the glass, rattling the panes and scattering her notes. <words>234</words>  
She didn’t move to gather them. <words>238</words>  
Instead, she watched the tide roll in, its rhythm unchanged by her years of study. <words>250</words>  
The sea didn’t care for perfection, and perhaps that was its wisdom. <words>260</words>  
Elenor stood, her joints stiff, and walked to the bellows, pressing its handle with a sigh. <words>273</words>  
The air it expelled stirred the herbs, releasing a scent she hadn’t noticed in years. <words>285</words>  
It smelled like beginnings. <words>288</words>  
She turned back to the window, the goose now a speck on the horizon, and for the first time, she smiled. <words>303</words>  
Not because she had found perfection, but because she no longer needed it. <words>313</words>  
The tide would come and go, the goose would fly, and she would remain—thoughtfully thoughtless, but finally at peace. <words>329</words>  
She picked up a fallen page, smoothed it gently, and wrote: “Today, I cherished the wind.” <words>342</words>  
Outside, the sea roared its approval, indifferent and eternal. <words>349</words>  
And Elenor, in her glass sanctuary, let go of the price she had paid. <words>360</words>  
She was no longer perfect, but she was whole. <words>367</words>  
And that, perhaps, was enough. <words>372</words>
