The domed vineyard shimmered like a dream misplaced, its glass ribs catching the last sigh of twin suns over the barren alien plain. <words>21</words>  
Inside, vines curled in defiance of the dust-choked world beyond, their fruit glowing faintly with bioluminescent promise. <words>36</words>  
Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse annex, a figure moved—furiously tranquil, as if rage had learned to whisper. <words>52</words>  
She was called Lira, archivist of forgotten intentions, and her hands sifted through brittle petals and soil-stained paper trails. <words>68</words>  
Each scrap she uncovered bore the ink of vanished voices, folded notes from those who once dared to dream in ink. <words>84</words>  
One such note, creased and sealed with a sigil of starlight, trembled in her palm as if it remembered being written. <words>100</words>  
She opened it slowly, reverently, as if the words might vanish if startled: “To cup starlight in mortal palms—begin beneath the vine.” <words>118</words>  
Lira’s breath caught; the phrase echoed the prophecy whispered across the hush of a possibility just born. <words>131</words>  
She turned, startled by the crunch of boots on gravel, and there he stood—the sneering envoy from the Outer Accord. <words>147</words>  
His uniform gleamed with synthetic authority, but his eyes held the boredom of a man who’d seen too many failed revolutions. <words>163</words>  
“You still chasing ghosts in grapevines?” he asked, voice slick with disdain. <words>172</words>  
Lira held up the folded note like a blade. <words>179</words>  
“This ghost left a map,” she said, “and I intend to follow it.” <words>189</words>  
The envoy scoffed, but his gaze lingered on the glowing fruit, unease flickering beneath his practiced sneer. <words>203</words>  
“You think starlight can be harvested?” he asked. <words>210</words>  
“I think it already has,” she replied, gesturing to the vines, their tendrils pulsing with quiet light. <words>223</words>  
He stepped closer, curiosity cracking his mask. <words>230</words>  
Lira turned back to her sifting, uncovering more notes, more trails—each a breadcrumb left by those who believed. <words>244</words>  
The envoy knelt beside her, drawn despite himself, and together they pieced together a lattice of intentions. <words>257</words>  
Outside, the alien wind howled, but inside the dome, destiny rambled forward like a vine seeking sun. <words>270</words>  
The folded notes formed a constellation of purpose, each one a whisper from the past daring the future to listen. <words>286</words>  
Lira pressed her palm to the soil, feeling warmth rise—not from the earth, but from the stars caught in the roots. <words>302</words>  
The envoy watched, no longer sneering, as the vines began to bloom with impossible light. <words>313</words>  
In that moment, across the hush of a possibility just born, he understood. <words>323</words>  
They weren’t chasing ghosts—they were becoming them, leaving paper trails for those who would come next. <words>337</words>  
Lira smiled, furiously tranquil, as the dome filled with the scent of starlight and the rustle of unfolding futures. <words>351</words>  
The envoy reached for a folded note, his fingers trembling, and added his name to the constellation. <words>363</words>  
Outside, the barren plain remained unchanged, but within the dome, something had shifted—something that would not be unwritten. <words>377</words>
