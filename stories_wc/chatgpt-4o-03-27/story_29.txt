The hush of a streetlamp flickering out signaled the moment Sir Elric stepped into the hedge maze, his armor humming softly with anticipation. <words>21</words>  
He was a hopeful knight, not in the sense of blind optimism, but in the way a man clings to light while drowning. <words>39</words>  
The mystic orchard garden lay hidden at the maze’s heart, its trees bearing fruit that shimmered like bottled memories. <words>53</words>  
Elric’s quest was not for glory, but to sabotage the machine that cycles regrets, a cursed device buried beneath the orchard’s roots. <words>72</words>  
It had stolen his brother’s laughter, his mother’s lullabies, and the final words of a love he could no longer name. <words>89</words>  
He carried with him a stray jigsaw edge, the only piece left from a puzzle his brother had once completed in joy. <words>107</words>  
The edge pulsed faintly, resonating with cryptic frequencies that only Elric, in his cleverly naive determination, could interpret. <words>122</words>  
He had learned to sync with these frequencies by listening to the orchard’s wind, which whispered in riddles and wept in silence. <words>140</words>  
Each step deeper into the maze brought him closer to the machine, and closer to the memories it had devoured. <words>155</words>  
The garden greeted him with agonizing bliss—petals of sorrow, roots of longing, and air thick with the perfume of forgotten dreams. <words>172</words>  
Elric knelt before the ancient tree at the center, where the machine pulsed like a second heart beneath the soil. <words>187</words>  
He pressed the jigsaw edge into the bark, syncing its jagged rhythm with the machine’s hidden frequencies. <words>200</words>  
The ground trembled as the machine resisted, spewing echoes of regrets it had hoarded: missed chances, unsent letters, unspoken truths. <words>217</words>  
Elric’s mind flooded with them, but he held fast, his cleverly naive hope shielding him like a knight’s shield of old. <words>233</words>  
He began to neutralize the machine, not by force, but by harmonizing with its sorrow, offering it the one thing it lacked—release. <words>251</words>  
The jigsaw edge glowed, completing a puzzle the machine didn’t know it was part of, and the orchard sighed in relief. <words>266</words>  
Memories rained from the trees like golden leaves, returning to the world, to the hearts that had long ached for them. <words>281</words>  
Elric wept as his brother’s laughter echoed through the branches, and a lullaby hummed itself into the wind. <words>296</words>  
The machine crumbled into dust, its cycle broken, its regrets no longer bound to the roots of the orchard. <words>310</words>  
As dawn crept over the maze, Elric emerged, not victorious, but whole, carrying nothing but the jigsaw edge and a healed heart. <words>329</words>  
The streetlamp flickered back to life behind him, casting light on a world subtly changed, subtly reclaimed. <words>343</words>  
He turned once to see the hedge maze close behind him, the orchard hidden once more, waiting for the next seeker of the lost. <words>361</words>  
And though the agony lingered, so too did the bliss, entwined like vines in the soul of a hopeful knight. <words>376</words>
