When the orchard dog finally stopped barking at night, Elias knew it was time. <words>17</words>  
He slipped through the museum’s back door, the one that creaked like a dying pterosaur. <words>30</words>  
The dinosaur skeletons loomed in the moonlight, their bones casting long shadows across the marble floor. <words>43</words>  
Elias, a gentle swordsman by trade and temperament, moved with reverence between the fossilized giants. <words>57</words>  
He wasn’t here to steal or vandalize—he was here to listen. <words>66</words>  
In his pocket, he carried an empty matchbox, once filled with sparks he’d used to light the coded sundial. <words>81</words>  
The sundial, half-painted and forgotten in the museum’s courtyard, held secrets in its angles—messages only late bloomers could decipher. <words>96</words>  
Elias had always been a late bloomer, slow to anger, slower to love, but quick to wonder. <words>109</words>  
He had spent years studying the sundial’s geometry, decoding its whispers via the shifting shadows of dusk. <words>122</words>  
Tonight, the final angle had aligned, pointing him here, beneath the ribcage of a Tyrannosaurus rex. <words>135</words>  
He knelt, placing the empty matchbox on the floor, aligning it with the fossil’s sternum. <words>147</words>  
The box clicked open, though it held no matches—only a folded scrap of parchment. <words>158</words>  
He unfolded it with care, revealing a map inked in constellations and foreign alphabets. <words>169</words>  
Elias was a xenophile, drawn to the unknown, the alien, the languages that danced beyond comprehension. <words>182</words>  
He traced the map with a calloused finger, each symbol a promise, each star a destination. <words>194</words>  
He had been faithfully unfaithful to his homeland, always chasing the next horizon, the next mystery. <words>207</words>  
But this—this was different. <words>210</words>  
This was a call to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, to hold its trembling beauty close. <words>223</words>  
He stood, brushing dust from his knees, and looked up at the dinosaur’s skull. <words>234</words>  
“Thank you,” he whispered, brusque affection in his voice, as if speaking to an old friend. <words>247</words>  
The bones didn’t answer, but the silence felt like approval. <words>254</words>  
He turned toward the exit, the map tucked safely in his coat, the matchbox empty but fulfilled. <words>267</words>  
Outside, the orchard dog remained silent, the stars blinking like ancient eyes above the museum. <words>279</words>  
Elias walked into the night, a gentle swordsman with no sword, only purpose. <words>289</words>  
He would follow the map, not to conquer, but to understand, to listen, to hold. <words>301</words>  
The sundial’s final message had been clear: the universe blooms late, and so do its keepers. <words>314</words>  
He smiled, a rare thing, and let the wind carry him forward. <words>324</words>  
Behind him, the museum lights flickered once, then went dark, as if winking goodbye. <words>336</words>  
He didn’t look back. <words>339</words>  
There was too much ahead, too many stars to cradle, too many truths to gently unsheathe. <words>352</words>  
And somewhere, in the coded angles of time and bone, he had finally found his beginning. <words>365</words>
