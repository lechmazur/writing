In the hush after the final guest leaves a wedding, Jory slipped into the steampunk airship’s engine room, amber ring glinting faintly under the flickering gaslight. <words>26</words>  
He was a freelancer who freelanced everything—weddings, repairs, espionage, even storytelling—his life a patchwork of borrowed skills and half-finished farewells. <words>45</words>  
Tonight, he was here to chronicle elder wisdom, a dying engineer’s last good intention whispered between champagne toasts and the clink of silverware. <words>63</words>  
The engine room pulsed with heat and brass, gears turning like the rhythm of waves against a cliff, steady and ancient. <words>78</words>  
Jory moved with scattered harmony, his steps unsure but oddly graceful, as if improvising a dance he’d never learned. <words>92</words>  
He found the old man slumped beside the main turbine, eyes closed, breath shallow, the scent of oil and lavender clinging to his coat. <words>111</words>  
“Master Elric,” Jory whispered, kneeling, “you said you had something to pass on.” <words>120</words>  
Elric’s eyes fluttered open, clouded but sharp, and he reached for Jory’s hand, fingers brushing the amber ring. <words>134</words>  
“That ring,” he rasped, “was forged from the sap of the last tree that remembered the stars.” <words>147</words>  
Jory blinked, caught off guard by the inadvertently profound poetry of the statement. <words>157</words>  
Elric chuckled weakly. “You think I’m mad, but listen—this ship runs not on steam, but on memory.” <words>170</words>  
Jory leaned closer, heart thudding like a misfiring piston. “Memory?” <words>178</words>  
“Every elder who served here left a piece of themselves in the gears,” Elric said, tapping the brass floor. <words>191</words>  
“And now it’s your turn to outwit time, to keep us flying.” <words>200</words>  
Jory hesitated, the weight of his freelanced life pressing down, but something in Elric’s gaze anchored him. <words>213</words>  
He slipped the amber ring from his finger and placed it on a small spindle beside the turbine. <words>226</words>  
The engine shuddered, then hummed, a new rhythm joining the old, like a fresh verse in an ancient song. <words>239</words>  
Elric smiled, eyes closing for the last time, his final breath syncing with the ship’s renewed pulse. <words>251</words>  
Jory sat in silence, the hush after the wedding now a cathedral of ticking gears and whispered legacies. <words>264</words>  
He pulled a notebook from his coat, fingers smudged with ink and oil, and began to write. <words>276</words>  
Not just about Elric, but about all the elders he’d met, their wisdom scattered like stardust across his travels. <words>290</words>  
He wrote with the rhythm of waves against a cliff, steady, relentless, shaping something lasting from the erosion of time. <words>304</words>  
Each word was a gear, each sentence a piston, building a machine of memory that might outlive him. <words>316</words>  
He realized then that freelancing everything had been his way of listening, of gathering fragments for this moment. <words>329</words>  
The amber ring glowed faintly, as if approving, as if remembering. <words>337</words>  
Jory smiled, inadvertently profound in his solitude, and kept writing. <words>345</words>  
Outside, the airship lifted into the night, its engine singing a new song composed of old truths. <words>358</words>  
And somewhere in the sky, the last good intention found its place among the stars. <words>369</words>
