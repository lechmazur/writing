<story>
When the old watchtower clock struck thirteen, a sound no soul had heard in centuries, the dejected knight stirred from his exile beneath the shattered chandeliers of the zero-gravity dance hall. <words>33</words>  
He floated upward, armor clinking in slow spirals, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where constellations once danced in rhythm with forgotten music. <words>55</words>  
The knight clutched a single trident prong, rusted and glowing faintly blue, salvaged from the sunken realm of Thalassor where gods drowned in their own pride. <words>83</words>  
It was no ordinary relic—it pulsed with a normally abnormal energy, humming with the breath of ancient oaths and submerged kingdoms. <words>104</words>  
He had come to this sacred place of disorder not to dance, but to quicken the vow he had once whispered into the abyss. <words>127</words>  
A vow to voice the silence that echoed through ages, to awaken the truth buried beneath centuries of ceremonial lies. <words>147</words>  
Through forgotten paths—tunnels of memory, corridors of dust, and stairwells that spiraled into nowhere—he had arrived at this moment. <words>169</words>  
The dance hall, once a temple of levity, now spun with ghostly echoes and drifting petals of long-dead roses. <words>189</words>  
He floated past the skeletal remains of revelers, their bones locked in eternal pirouettes, their masks cracked but still grinning. <words>210</words>  
The knight’s heart, long numbed by exile and regret, began to quicken with each beat of the trident’s glow. <words>229</words>  
He reached the center of the hall, where gravity once bowed to rhythm, and raised the prong toward the fractured dome above. <words>251</words>  
The clock struck again—fourteen—and time itself seemed to stagger, as if unsure whether to proceed or retreat. <words>270</words>  
From the prong burst a beam of aquamarine light, piercing the dome and revealing a sky not of stars, but of eyes watching from beyond. <words>296</words>  
They were the witnesses of his vow, the ancients who had once danced here before the fall, before silence claimed their voices. <words>317</words>  
The knight spoke, his voice trembling but resolute, “I am the echo of your silence, the bearer of your forgotten truth.” <words>339</words>  
The hall responded—not with applause, but with a deepening horizon, as walls dissolved into endless sea and sky. <words>359</words>  
He drifted forward, no longer bound by gravity or grief, the vow now alive in every breath of the sacred disorder. <words>380</words>  
Behind him, the clock struck fifteen, and the dance began anew—not of bodies, but of truths long submerged, now rising. <words>402</words>  
The knight vanished into the horizon, his armor shedding like scales, the trident prong guiding him toward a realm reborn. <words>423</words>  
And in the silence that followed, the vow echoed still, deepening with every heartbeat of the cosmos. <words>440</words>
