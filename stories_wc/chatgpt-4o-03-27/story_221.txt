The air inside the abandoned carnival shooting gallery was thick with dust and memory, the scent of rusted metal and old popcorn lingering like a ghost. <words>21</words>  
Cassian knelt beside a collapsed booth, his wetsuit still damp from the morning dive, and whispered to the silence, “I know you’re here.” <words>41</words>  
He wasn’t speaking to no one—he never was—because Cassian was a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, and the dead had stories they needed to finish. <words>63</words>  
In his gloved hand, he held a piece of amber with a tiny insect trapped inside, a relic he’d found wedged in the hull of the sunken ship “Maribel.” <words>89</words>  
The insect, perfectly preserved, reminded him of his mother’s voice reading bedtime stories about time standing still, and how some things never truly die. <words>110</words>  
Cassian had come here not just for the spirits, but to arouse something long buried in himself—a thawing heart, frozen by years of silence and shadows. <words>134</words>  
His family had always attended the carnival’s opening night together, a tradition broken when his father vanished during a dive off the coast of Cyprus. <words>157</words>  
Since then, Cassian had lived in the shadow of that absence, diving deeper into wrecks and whispers, hoping to find the man who never returned. <words>181</words>  
Tonight, between the lines of a half-written letter he’d found in his father’s old journal, Cassian had traced the coordinates that led him here. <words>203</words>  
The letter spoke of a promise, of a final message meant to be delivered at the place where joy and sorrow once danced hand in hand. <words>226</words>  
He stepped behind the counter of the shooting gallery, where faded plush toys still hung like forgotten dreams, and placed the amber on the ledge. <words>250</words>  
A cold breeze stirred, and the shadows shifted; a voice, low and familiar, whispered, “You found it, son.” <words>266</words>  
Cassian’s breath caught, joyfully melancholic, as the air shimmered and the outline of his father emerged, translucent and smiling. <words>284</words>  
“I couldn’t leave until someone remembered,” the ghost said, eyes fixed on the amber, “until someone came not to follow, but to lead.” <words>307</words>  
Cassian nodded, tears tracing salt over his cheeks, and whispered, “I’m ready to step out of your shadow.” <words>324</words>  
The ghost’s form flickered, then faded, leaving behind warmth where cold had ruled, and Cassian felt the thaw begin in his chest. <words>346</words>  
He picked up the amber, now glowing faintly, and walked out of the gallery into the night, a fleeting rebellion against the silence he’d known too long. <words>372</words>  
The carnival lights would never shine again, but in Cassian’s heart, something had been reignited—fragile, luminous, and finally free. <words>390</words>
