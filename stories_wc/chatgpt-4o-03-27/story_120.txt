At the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, Eli stood at the mouth of the quantum tunnel, his boots soaked from the last loop’s rain. <words>25</words>  
He was a paramedic by trade, but lately, he’d become something else—something stitched together by repetition and regret. <words>41</words>  
Each loop began the same: a single raindrop tapping the metal roof of the ambulance, the sound slicing time like a scalpel. <words>59</words>  
That drop was his cue, his method of return, his curse and compass. <words>68</words>  
He’d tried to ignore it once, but the loop punished him with silence, a void more unbearable than the trauma he carried. <words>87</words>  
The trauma wasn’t just his—it belonged to the people he couldn’t save, the ones whose names he never learned but whose faces nested in his mind. <words>109</words>  
He called them his ghosts, though they never spoke, only stared with eyes that asked why. <words>122</words>  
In his pocket, he kept a weathered fishing lure, rusted and chipped, the last thing his brother had given him before drowning in a lake Eli couldn’t reach in time. <words>147</words>  
It was a privately public grief—he never spoke of it, but it clung to him like the scent of antiseptic and diesel. <words>164</words>  
The tunnel shimmered with quantum static, a corridor of fractured light and memory, and Eli stepped in, the lure clenched in his fist. <words>182</words>  
He wasn’t sure if the tunnel was real or just a metaphor his mind had built to survive the loops. <words>197</words>  
But it always brought him back to the same moment, the same call, the same child pinned beneath a collapsed swing set. <words>214</words>  
He’d tried everything—different approaches, different tools, even different words—but the outcome never changed. <words>227</words>  
The child always died, and Eli always woke to the sound of that raindrop. <words>239</words>  
Today, though, he felt something shift—not in the loop, but in himself. <words>251</words>  
He no longer wanted to fix the moment; he wanted to baptize his nightmares in acceptance. <words>265</words>  
He knelt beside the child, not to save him, but to nest his own brokenness beside the boy’s fading breath. <words>282</words>  
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, placing the lure in the child’s hand, a token of shared loss. <words>296</words>  
The tunnel didn’t open this time, and the raindrop never fell. <words>307</words>  
Instead, silence wrapped around him like a warm shroud, and for the first time, Eli didn’t feel the need to run. <words>324</words>  
He sat there until the bell echoed again, not as a summons, but as a benediction. <words>337</words>  
The quantum tunnel flickered, not with urgency, but with invitation. <words>348</words>  
Eli stood, lighter somehow, and stepped forward—not to escape, but to continue. <words>361</words>  
The trauma hadn’t healed, but it had been seen, acknowledged, and nested within the folds of his soul. <words>378</words>  
He would loop again, yes, but now with purpose—not to change the past, but to carry it with grace. <words>395</words>  
And when the raindrop finally fell, it sounded less like a curse and more like a lullaby. <words>409</words>
