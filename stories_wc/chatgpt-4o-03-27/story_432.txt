In the final second before the ice sculpture collapsed, Elian pressed his palm to the cold stone wall behind the subterranean waterfall. <words>1</words>  
The roar of water masked the sound of the sculpture’s shattering, but he felt the tremor in his bones. <words>2</words>  
He had come here not to witness art’s demise, but to map the energy flows that pulsed beneath the city’s skin. <words>3</words>  
Elian was a poison taster by trade, a strangely compelling figure in the hidden society of the Undermind. <words>4</words>  
The Undermind thrived in the caverns below, a network of thinkers, seers, and exiles who interpreted the world’s chaos through unconventional means. <words>5</words>  
Elian’s method was unique: he bound meaning from the frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, decoding patterns others dismissed as madness. <words>6</words>  
Each call was a thread, and he wove them into maps of unseen currents—emotional, psychic, and sometimes lethal. <words>7</words>  
He had tasted death a hundred times, sipping poisons to test their resonance with the flows he charted. <words>8</words>  
But he longed for one that would finally bind him to the truth he sought, permanently. <words>9</words>  
The bookmark in his pocket—a simple cloth rectangle embroidered with a spiral—was his only keepsake from the surface. <words>10</words>  
It had marked a passage in a book he no longer owned, a line about serenity found in upheaval. <words>11</words>  
That line had led him underground, chasing the paradox that had become his life’s work. <words>12</words>  
Tonight, the waterfall’s chamber pulsed with energy, the flows converging in a way he had never seen. <words>13</words>  
The ice sculpture, a towering figure of a woman with outstretched arms, had been placed precisely to channel the convergence. <words>14</words>  
Its collapse was not an accident—it was the final signal. <words>15</words>  
Elian stepped forward, letting the icy mist soak his skin, and opened the small vial he had prepared. <words>16</words>  
The poison inside shimmered with a faint blue light, reacting to the energy in the air. <words>17</words>  
He drank it slowly, feeling the burn trace the same paths he had mapped for years. <words>18</words>  
Visions surged—fractals of thought, voices from the radio calls, the spiral on the bookmark spinning in his mind. <words>19</words>  
He saw the hidden societies not as separate enclaves, but as organs of a vast, dreaming body. <words>20</words>  
The poison did not kill him; it bound him to the flows, made him a conduit. <words>21</words>  
He collapsed beside the shattered ice, breath shallow, eyes wide with understanding. <words>22</words>  
Above, the surface world continued unaware, but below, the Undermind stirred. <words>23</words>  
They would find him, not as a martyr, but as a map. <words>24</words>  
The bookmark fluttered from his pocket, landing in the water, spiral side up. <words>25</words>  
It drifted toward the waterfall’s edge, caught in the current he had finally joined. <words>26</words>
