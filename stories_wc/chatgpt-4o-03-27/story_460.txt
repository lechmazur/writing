The acid rain forest hissed as droplets sizzled against the bark of twisted trees, their leaves long since melted into skeletal lace. <words>20</words> 

King Orlen trudged through the steaming underbrush, his crown a tarnished band hidden beneath a hood, his gait lethargically energetic—each step slow, yet determined. <words>42</words> 

He was an unassuming monarch, long stripped of court and kingdom, wandering the ruins of a world that had collapsed under its own weight. <words>61</words> 

In his satchel, he carried a box of mismatched puzzle pieces, each one scavenged from forgotten places, none fitting together, yet none discarded. <words>83</words> 

He believed the puzzle held the ember of choice, a remnant of the old world’s last decision, scattered before the end. <words>101</words> 

The forest whispered secrets in chemical sighs, and Orlen listened not with ears, but via the texture of a feather he kept in his sleeve. <words>125</words> 

It was from a bird extinct since the first acid rains, its barbs still soft, still resonant with the vibrations of truth. <words>144</words> 

When he pressed it to his palm, he could perceive the forest’s moods—its warnings, its regrets, its buried wisdom. <words>162</words> 

He sought not power, but to cradle wisdom in rough, calloused hands, to hold something real in a world of corrosion. <words>181</words> 

Each night, beneath the shelter of a rusted canopy, he laid out the puzzle pieces, trying combinations that never quite aligned. <words>201</words> 

But he felt the ember stir when he touched them, a flicker of warmth in the cold ash of civilization. <words>218</words> 

One evening, the feather quivered violently as he placed a jagged piece beside a smooth-edged one, and the forest fell silent. <words>237</words> 

He froze, perceiving a shift—not in the puzzle, but in himself, as if the choice had always been internal. <words>254</words> 

The ember flared behind his eyes, illuminating memories not his own—of cities breathing, of laughter echoing through clean air. <words>272</words> 

He wept, not from sorrow, but from the prickly wonder of remembering what had been lost and what might still be found. <words>292</words> 

The puzzle would never be complete, he realized, because it was not meant to be solved, but to be held. <words>309</words> 

Each piece was a fragment of choice, a shard of potential, and in holding them, he honored the world’s broken beauty. <words>328</words> 

The forest resumed its hissing lullaby, and Orlen, monarch of nothing, smiled beneath his hood and walked on. <words>344</words> 

He was no longer searching for answers, but for the questions that made the ember glow. <words>359</words> 

And in that glow, he found purpose—not to rebuild, but to remember, to perceive, and to carry forward the weight of wisdom. <words>380</words> 

The feather brushed his palm again, soft as breath, and he knew the forest approved. <words>393</words> 

He vanished into the mist, a silhouette of quiet resolve, puzzle box clutched like a relic of sacred fire. <words>410</words> 

Behind him, the acid rain forest whispered his name—not as a king, but as a keeper of choices. <words>428</words> 

And the ember burned on. <words>432</words>
