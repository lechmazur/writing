When the last library card was returned to the desk, the cloud city exhaled a sigh of forgotten knowledge. <words>17</words>  
Above the vaporous streets, where zeppelins whispered and neon fog curled like incense, Elias waited for the midnight call. <words>33</words>  
He was a professional scapegoat for hire, robustly delicate in manner—able to absorb blame with grace, yet never break. <words>48</words>  
His clients were always desperate, always powerful, and always anonymous, speaking only through cryptic phone calls at midnight. <words>61</words>  
Tonight’s voice was different—hoarse, reverent, and trembling with the weight of sacred symbols needing to be decoded. <words>74</words>  
“I need you to refashion an identity,” the voice said, “one that was abandoned long ago, but not by choice.” <words>89</words>  
Elias’s fingers brushed the metal washer he wore on a chain—his only keepsake from a life he no longer claimed. <words>104</words>  
He had once been a linguist, a decoder of ancient glyphs, until a scandal erased him from academia’s memory. <words>117</words>  
Now, he bore others’ sins, wearing their shame like tailored suits, each fitting more snugly than the last. <words>129</words>  
The voice gave coordinates—Sector 9, Tower Umbra, where the clouds thickened and time seemed to stall. <words>141</words>  
There, Elias found a room lined with mirrors etched in spirals, each reflecting a different version of himself. <words>154</words>  
In the center lay a journal bound in cloud-leather, its pages filled with symbols that pulsed faintly with heat. <words>167</words>  
He traced them with the washer, its edges aligning perfectly with the curves and angles of the sacred script. <words>180</words>  
The symbols told a story of a name erased, a truth buried beneath layers of borrowed guilt. <words>192</words>  
Elias realized the journal was his, written in a hand he had trained himself to forget. <words>203</words>  
The voice on the phone had been his own, recorded years ago, triggered by the return of the final card. <words>217</words>  
He had orchestrated this entire ritual to reclaim what he had once surrendered: his identity. <words>228</words>  
The washer, once part of a machine that printed forbidden texts, was the key to decoding his past. <words>241</words>  
He refashioned his name from the symbols, each letter a shard of memory, each word a breath of rebirth. <words>254</words>  
Outside, the cloud city shimmered with new light, as if recognizing the return of something long lost. <words>266</words>  
Elias stepped into the mist, no longer a scapegoat, but a man who had rewritten his own myth. <words>278</words>  
He would no longer carry others’ guilt; he would decode the sacred for himself, with obsessive calm. <words>290</words>  
The phone rang again at midnight, but this time, he let it echo unanswered into the clouds. <words>302</words>  
He had no need for cryptic voices now—his own was finally clear. <words>311</words>  
And in the silence, the city listened. <words>316</words>
