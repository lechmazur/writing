At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, the gentle conjurer named Elowen felt the tremor of a long-buried truth stir beneath her feet. <words>23</words>  
She knelt, pressing her palm to the mossy ground, and whispered a spell that shimmered like dewlight, revealing a hidden path to the underground city of the dwarves. <words>45</words>  
Elowen had come not for gold or glory, but to reassemble a forgotten garden that once bloomed in the heart of the mountain. <words>63</words>  
The garden had been destroyed in a war of pride, its memory erased save for one artifact: a stained glass butterfly, shattered and scattered across the dwarven halls. <words>89</words>  
Each fragment held a reversed message, etched in runes that only revealed their meaning when read backward under moonstone light. <words>106</words>  
Elowen’s magic, gentle yet persistent, coaxed the fragments from their hiding places—beneath anvils, behind murals, inside hollowed-out gears. <words>124</words>  
The dwarves watched her with inscrutably obvious suspicion, their eyes narrowed but their hands never reaching for weapons. <words>139</words>  
They remembered the garden too, though none would admit it aloud, for justice in their city was a matter of silence and stone. <words>158</words>  
Elowen’s presence stirred something ancient, a joyful terror that danced like firelight in the corners of their minds. <words>174</words>  
She laid the fragments on a slab of obsidian and began to reassemble the butterfly, each piece clicking into place with a chime like laughter. <words>195</words>  
As the final shard settled, the butterfly pulsed with color, casting kaleidoscopic light across the chamber and revealing the reversed messages in full. <words>216</words>  
They told of betrayal, of a garden poisoned by envy, and of a promise made by the last gardener to return when justice could bloom again. <words>240</words>  
The dwarves, moved by the truth they had long buried, knelt in silence as Elowen raised the butterfly high. <words>256</words>  
Its wings beat once, twice, and then it flew, leading them through tunnels long sealed by grief. <words>270</words>  
At the garden’s ruins, roots stirred and petals unfurled, awakened by the butterfly’s light and Elowen’s unwavering purpose. <words>287</words>  
The dwarves joined her, their hands rough but willing, planting seeds of memory and hope. <words>300</words>  
Justice, they realized, was not vengeance but restoration—a truth made inscrutably obvious by the garden’s rebirth. <words>316</words>  
Elowen smiled, tears tracing paths down her cheeks, as the first flower bloomed in soil once thought dead. <words>332</words>  
The butterfly circled above, a stained glass sentinel, watching over a city learning to remember. <words>346</words>  
And in the joyful terror of that moment, the mountain breathed again. <words>355</words>  
Elowen stayed, not as a conjurer, but as a gardener, tending to justice with every bloom. <words>370</words>  
The dwarves sang songs of her, their voices echoing through stone halls, no longer silent. <words>384</words>  
Each note carried the memory of a brittle branch breaking, and the garden that grew from it. <words>400</words>
