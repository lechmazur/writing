The first time I met Evelyn Marrow was at a blood drive in the basement of the old opera house, where she offered me a cookie and asked if I believed in ghosts. <words>27</words>  
She had the kind of voice that made silence louder, and I, a dog walker for the ultra-rich, found myself nodding before I understood the question. <words>51</words>  
Evelyn wasn’t rich, but she moved like someone who had inherited secrets instead of money, and she smelled faintly of lavender and old paper. <words>72</words>  
She told me about the Marrow estate, a mansion perched on the edge of the city where color bled from day into night like bruises on the sky. <words>98</words>  
I agreed to visit, not because I believed her stories, but because I wanted to stand where fear dares not tread. <words>117</words>  
The dining room was cavernous, its chandelier swaying though no wind stirred, and the walls were lined with her late grandfather’s botanical collection—pressed flowers, dried vines, and poisonous roots. <words>147</words>  
Each specimen was labeled in Latin, but some had annotations in a language I didn’t recognize, written in a hand that trembled with purpose. <words>170</words>  
Evelyn moved through the room with a carefully careless grace, brushing dust from frames as if waking them. <words>189</words>  
She said the house listened, and that silence here was not absence but presence—loud, watching, waiting. <words>208</words>  
I asked why she invited me, and she said, “Because you walk dogs for people who never walk themselves—you understand silent agreements.” <words>233</words>  
I didn’t argue; she was right. <words>237</words>  
Every leash I held was a contract unspoken: protect, obey, disappear. <words>251</words>  
She led me to the head of the table, where a single chair faced the window, and told me to sit. <words>270</words>  
Outside, the sky was bleeding into itself, and the trees bent as if bowing to something unseen. <words>288</words>  
She placed a dried orchid in my hand and whispered, “Justify your presence.” <words>303</words>  
I didn’t know how, but I felt the weight of every step I’d taken to get here. <words>321</words>  
I said, “Because I want to know what it means to be afraid and stay anyway.” <words>338</words>  
The chandelier stilled. <words>340</words>  
The silence deepened. <words>342</words>  
And Evelyn smiled, not kindly, but knowingly, as if I had passed a test I never knew I was taking. <words>366</words>  
Later, as I left the mansion, the orchid turned to ash in my palm, and I understood that some agreements are made not with words, but with presence. <words>398</words>  
And some places remember. <words>401</words>
