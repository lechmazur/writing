Lord Percival Thistlewaite, a submissive aristocrat with a penchant for bonsai pruning, found himself amid yard work when he overheard something peculiar. <words>21</words> 

The hedges surrounding his estate concealed more than just squirrels—they echoed with whispers from the adjacent secret agent workshop, recently disguised as a garden shed. <words>45</words> 

He hadn’t meant to eavesdrop, but the acoustics of the marble birdbath created an accidental echo chamber, funneling voices straight to his unusually perceptive ears. <words>72</words> 

“Target must be liquified before sundown,” one voice said, clipped and cold, like a guillotine in mid-sentence. <words>88</words> 

Percival dropped his dull letter opener, which he’d been using to gently separate root clusters, and blinked at the hedge as if it had insulted his cravat. <words>112</words> 

He wasn’t brave, nor particularly clever, but he possessed a silent empathy that made him feel the pain of others as if it were his own. <words>140</words> 

And the “target,” he suspected, was not a man, but the small, trembling fox cub he’d found sheltering beneath the azaleas that morning. <words>165</words> 

The cub had a limp and eyes like tarnished silver, and when Percival had offered it a biscuit, it had accepted with regal restraint. <words>191</words> 

He’d named it Algernon, because it seemed the sort of name a fox of noble bearing might appreciate. <words>207</words> 

Now, with agents plotting liquefaction and Algernon napping in a flowerpot, Percival knew he had to act. <words>224</words> 

He tiptoed into the workshop, where gadgets blinked and hummed like judgmental fireflies, and found a blueprint labeled “Operation Meltwhisker.” <words>248</words> 

His heart thudded like a misfiring metronome, but he remembered the agents’ words: “He’s too soft to notice.” <words>267</words> 

Soft, perhaps, but not stupid. <words>271</words> 

He swapped the liquify serum with a vial of elderflower cordial—his late aunt’s recipe, potent only in its ability to induce mild nostalgia. <words>298</words> 

Then he returned to his yard, resumed pruning, and waited. <words>307</words> 

When the agents emerged, they looked confused, then sentimental, then wandered off muttering about childhood picnics and the scent of linen. <words>332</words> 

Algernon blinked up at him, and Percival gave a solemn nod, as if to say, “Yes, I’ve just saved your life with cordial and cowardice.” <words>362</words> 

The fox licked his hand, and in that moment, Percival felt more valorous than any duelist or diplomat. <words>382</words> 

He returned to his bonsai, the dull letter opener in hand, and whispered, “Let’s keep this between us, shall we?” <words>405</words> 

The fox yawned, the agents wept softly in the distance, and the garden resumed its quiet conspiracy of leaves. <words>429</words>
