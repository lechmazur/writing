In the pause between a singer’s verses, Marla adjusted a scuffed plastic comb in her pocket, the only keepsake from her brother who vanished near the stone circle. <words>27</words>  
She was a ruthless flower arranger by trade, known for slicing stems with surgical precision and arranging petals like a general marshaling troops. <words>47</words>  
But today, she wasn’t here to conquer bouquets—she was here to decode the rock art etched into the ancient stones. <words>63</words>  
The stone circle loomed like a forgotten punctuation mark in the countryside, its glyphs whispering secrets only the intellectually spontaneous could hope to unravel. <words>84</words>  
Marla had always been quick-witted, her mind leaping from theory to theory like a fox through brambles, but this mystery demanded more than cleverness. <words>106</words>  
She needed to distinguish between myth and message, between the watcher’s burden and the watched. <words>118</words>  
The watcher’s burden, her brother once said, was to see everything and say nothing, to carry truths too heavy for the world to hear. <words>140</words>  
He had been obsessed with the stone circle, convinced it was a map, a warning, or perhaps a confession. <words>157</words>  
Marla had dismissed him then, too busy arranging funeral lilies to listen, but his disappearance had rearranged her priorities. <words>175</words>  
Now, she wandered the circle’s edge, murmuring to herself, letting spontaneous road trip conversations with strangers echo in her mind. <words>193</words>  
One trucker had mentioned the stones hummed at dusk; a hitchhiker claimed they aligned with forgotten constellations. <words>208</words>  
Each tale was a petal in a larger bloom, and Marla, ever the arranger, began to see the pattern. <words>225</words>  
She knelt before a stone etched with spirals and lines, her fingers brushing the grooves like she once brushed rose thorns. <words>242</words>  
The scuffed plastic comb slipped from her pocket, landing teeth-down in the dirt, pointing toward a smaller, half-buried stone. <words>258</words>  
Polite anarchy stirred in her chest—a rebellion not of violence, but of curiosity unchained. <words>270</words>  
She dug with her hands, unearthing a slab marked with the same glyph her brother had drawn in his final letter. <words>287</words>  
It was a symbol of the eye, open and unblinking, the eternal watcher. <words>297</words>  
Marla sat back, breath caught in the pause between understanding and disbelief, like the silence between verses. <words>311</words>  
She realized then that the watcher’s burden wasn’t just to see—it was to act when others wouldn’t. <words>326</words>  
Her brother hadn’t vanished; he had stepped into the role of watcher, leaving clues for someone willing to distinguish signal from noise. <words>345</words>  
Marla stood, brushing dirt from her knees, the comb clenched in her fist like a relic. <words>358</words>  
She would carry the burden now, not out of guilt, but out of blooming purpose. <words>370</words>  
The stone circle no longer felt like a mystery—it felt like a message waiting to be arranged. <words>384</words>  
And Marla, ruthless and spontaneous, was ready to listen. <words>392</words>
