When the morning paper landed on the empty porch of the crooked cottage nestled deep in the Blackroot Woods, the coy spy known only as Marlowe adjusted his collar and stepped inside the witch’s potion brewery. <words>33</words>  
The air was thick with the scent of burnt sage and regret, and cauldrons bubbled with secrets too old to speak aloud. <words>50</words>  
Marlowe’s mission was simple in theory: bypass the wards of time, mend a broken alliance, and retrieve the one thing that could complete his transformation into a master of disguise. <words>75</words>  
He fingered the loose button on his coat, a relic from his first failed infiltration, now enchanted to reverse time in short bursts—his only way past the witch’s diabolically benevolent traps. <words>104</words>  
The witch, known as Mother Vex, had once been his mentor before betrayal split them like shattered glass, each shard reflecting a different version of the truth. <words>129</words>  
She had taught him the art of illusion, the science of scent, and the power of borrowed valor—how to wear another’s courage like a second skin. <words>153</words>  
But Marlowe had wanted more, had stolen a vial of her essence, and in doing so, fractured the fragile trust between them. <words>174</words>  
Now, years later, he returned not just for the final ingredient to his disguise, but to mend the fence he’d burned to ash. <words>196</words>  
He crept past shelves of bottled memories and jars of laughter, each labeled in a language that only the guilty could read. <words>216</words>  
A whisper of movement—he reversed time by three seconds, the button glowing faintly, and sidestepped a falling vial that would’ve turned him into a songbird. <words>241</words>  
Mother Vex appeared in a swirl of smoke, her eyes both kind and cruel, her smile a blade wrapped in velvet. <words>261</words>  
“You’ve come to steal again?” she asked, voice like honey laced with arsenic. <words>274</words>  
“No,” Marlowe said, bowing low, “I’ve come to return what I took—and ask for what I never earned.” <words>294</words>  
He placed the vial on the table, its contents swirling with remorse, and offered her the loose button. <words>311</words>  
She studied him, then the button, and finally the truth in his eyes. <words>324</words>  
“You always were a terrible liar,” she said, but her fingers closed around the button. <words>340</words>  
With a flick of her wrist, time surged backward, and they stood again at the moment before betrayal. <words>358</words>  
This time, Marlowe chose differently. <words>362</words>  
He asked to learn, not to take. <words>368</words>  
And in that moment, the fence between them mended—not with nails or wood, but with trust reborn through reversed time. <words>392</words>  
Mother Vex handed him a mask, woven from shadows and sincerity. <words>404</words>  
“Now,” she said, “become what you were meant to be.” <words>416</words>  
And as the morning paper fluttered on the porch once more, Marlowe vanished into the world—not as a thief, but as a master of disguise. <words>445</words>
