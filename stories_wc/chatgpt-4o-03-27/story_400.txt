The glacial orchard hung like a frozen chandelier over the yawning crevasse, its crystal branches heavy with frostfruit that never ripened. <words>21</words> 

Eira, the last druid, stood at the edge of the orchard, her cloak stitched with moss and silence, her eyes wary beneath a hood of woven bark. <words>43</words> 

She had not spoken aloud in seventy-three years, not since the last human vanished into the wind like ash from a dying fire. <words>63</words> 

Her only companion was a dull safety pin, once used to fasten her mother’s cloak, now pinned to her own as a talisman of memory. <words>87</words> 

It was her birthday, though no one remained to remember it but her, and the orchard, and the ice that never melted. <words>106</words> 

Tradition demanded she prepare the family meal—root stew with frostfruit glaze and marrowbread—though the ingredients had grown scarce and her appetite scarcer. <words>128</words> 

Still, she gathered what she could: brittle herbs from the orchard’s edge, a single frostfruit, and marrow scraped from the bones of long-dead beasts. <words>151</words> 

The act of gathering steadied her, though her hands trembled with the weight of memory and the cold that never left her bones. <words>172</words> 

She was fiercely ambivalent about the ritual—resenting its futility, yet clinging to its shape like a raft in a sea of silence. <words>193</words> 

As the stew simmered over a fire of glacial bark, she sat cross-legged and stared into the steam, her breath mingling with it. <words>214</words> 

The silence pressed in, thick and ancient, a presence more than an absence, and she felt it watching, waiting, daring her to break it. <words>237</words> 

She reached for the safety pin, its dull metal warm from her body, and unfastened it with a reverence that surprised her. <words>256</words> 

Holding it in her palm, she whispered, “I’m still here,” the words brittle and strange, like a language half-remembered from a dream. <words>276</words> 

The orchard shivered, branches clinking like wind chimes, and a single frostfruit dropped, splitting open to reveal a seed pulsing faintly with light. <words>298</words> 

Eira stared, heart pounding, unsure if it was magic or madness, but the silence had cracked, and something had answered. <words>316</words> 

She laughed then, a sound like breaking ice, sharp and sudden, and the dour amusement of it startled even her. <words>336</words> 

The stew was ready, and she ate alone, as always, but not untouched by the moment, not entirely unchanged. <words>355</words> 

The safety pin lay beside her bowl, no longer just a relic, but a key that had unlocked something buried deep. <words>375</words> 

Tomorrow, she would gather again, not out of duty, but out of hope, however fragile, however foolish. <words>392</words> 

And perhaps, in time, the orchard would bloom again, not for humans, but for whatever came next. <words>408</words> 

She would be ready, or at least, no longer afraid to try. <words>417</words>
