The mist curled like smoke around the rusted carousel as Jace, a reckless hunter with a vintage camera lens slung around his neck, stepped into the abandoned funfair. <words>27</words>  
He wasn’t here for thrills or nostalgia—he was here to map ghost towns, chasing whispers of places that had vanished from memory. <words>45</words>  
The lens, salvaged from a pawnshop in a town that no longer existed, revealed things the naked eye couldn’t—shadows of the past, flickers of forgotten lives. <words>68</words>  
Jace’s methods were meticulously careless; he documented ruins with precision but never planned his routes, trusting instinct over maps. <words>84</words>  
He believed that wise choices weren’t always safe ones, and sometimes, the only way forward was to leap before looking. <words>100</words>  
The funfair had been swallowed by the forest decades ago, its laughter long since atomized into the mist. <words>113</words>  
Jace wandered past a toppled Ferris wheel, its skeletal frame groaning in the wind, when he heard the faint strum of a guitar. <words>130</words>  
Following the sound, he found a trio of street musicians playing beneath a broken neon sign that read “Euphoria.” <words>144</words>  
They weren’t ghosts, but they weren’t quite real either—more like echoes given form by the forest’s memory. <words>158</words>  
Through conversations with them, Jace learned of a forgotten promise he’d made as a child—to return here and find what was lost. <words>176</words>  
He had buried the memory deep, but the musicians’ songs unearthed it, note by note. <words>188</words>  
The promise had been to his sister, who vanished in this very funfair during a family trip, swallowed by the mist. <words>204</words>  
Jace had run, terrified, and never looked back—until now. <words>211</words>  
The camera lens pulsed with warmth as he raised it, revealing a trail of glowing footprints leading toward the hall of mirrors. <words>228</words>  
Inside, reflections shimmered with scenes from the past: his sister laughing, running, hiding. <words>239</words>  
He followed the trail until it ended at a cracked mirror, behind which lay a door he’d never noticed before. <words>254</words>  
Opening it, he stepped into a room untouched by time, where his sister sat, unchanged, holding a music box. <words>269</words>  
“I waited,” she said, her voice both real and unreal. <words>277</words>  
Tears blurred his vision as he knelt beside her, the lens capturing the moment in a single, eternal frame. <words>292</words>  
He realized then that mapping ghost towns wasn’t about geography—it was about confronting the past with bold vulnerability. <words>308</words>  
The musicians’ final song echoed through the trees as the mist began to lift, revealing paths long hidden. <words>322</words>  
Jace took his sister’s hand, and together they walked out of the funfair, the vintage lens swinging gently at his side. <words>339</words>  
He had made a wise choice—not in finding her, but in choosing to remember. <words>351</words>  
Behind them, the funfair faded, atomized into memory, its purpose fulfilled. <words>361</words>  
Jace would continue mapping ghost towns, but now with a new compass: the promises we forget, and the courage to keep them. <words>380</words>
