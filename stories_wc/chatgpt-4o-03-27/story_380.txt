The last human was born under a sky that hadn’t wept in centuries. <words>1</words>  
His name was Elian, and he lived alone in a forgotten library built inside a treehouse that groaned with age. <words>2</words>  
The treehouse clung to a petrified oak, its roots sunk deep into a desert where oceans once whispered. <words>3</words>  
Elian was a convicted dream thief, sentenced not by courts but by the collective memory of those he’d stolen from. <words>4</words>  
He had once siphoned dreams from sleeping minds, bottling them like fireflies to sell in the black markets of the mind. <words>5</words>  
Now, with no one left to dream, he wandered the library’s spiraling shelves, haunted by echoes of stolen selves. <words>6</words>  
His only companion was a flimsy photo album, its pages warped and brittle, filled with faces he couldn’t name. <words>7</words>  
He believed—madly, quietly—that if he could remember who they were, he might remember who he was. <words>8</words>  
But numbers betrayed him; he was mathematically challenged, unable to count the years or the faces. <words>9</words>  
He often miscalculated time, thinking a day had passed when it had been a week, or a week when it was an hour. <words>10</words>  
Still, he clung to the album, convinced it held the key to coaxing thunder from the empty skies. <words>11</words>  
He believed the storm would come if he could reassemble the fragments of his stolen self. <words>12</words>  
Each photo was a shard, each name a note in a forgotten song. <words>13</words>  
He had once loved a woman named Kael, a fellow dream thief who taught him to play skyball—a sport lost to time. <words>14</words>  
They had shared a love for the game, leaping between floating platforms, chasing spheres of light through the clouds. <words>15</words>  
In those moments, he felt whole, as if the fragmented self could be stitched together by motion and laughter. <words>16</words>  
But Kael had vanished during the last dream war, her mind shattered by a plunge into someone else’s nightmare. <words>17</words>  
Elian had tried to follow her, diving into the dreamscape, but emerged with only pieces of her and none of himself. <words>18</words>  
Now, he replayed their matches in his mind, the way her feet barely touched the platforms, the way she laughed. <words>19</words>  
He built a crude skyball court in the treehouse’s upper canopy, using books as platforms and mirrors as goals. <words>20</words>  
Each game he played alone, imagining Kael beside him, her voice calling plays, her eyes storm-colored. <words>21</words>  
He believed that if he played well enough, the sky would remember her too. <words>22</words>  
One dusk, as he leapt for an impossible shot, the photo album slipped from his belt and plunged into the abyss below. <words>23</words>  
He screamed, not in fear, but in release, as if the fall had freed something buried. <words>24</words>  
The sky, long silent, rumbled faintly—like a throat clearing after centuries of silence. <words>25</words>  
Elian stood still, heart pounding, eyes wide, waiting. <words>26</words>  
A single drop of rain struck the wooden floor beside him. <words>27</words>  
He looked up, and for the first time in his life, the sky wept. <words>28</words>
