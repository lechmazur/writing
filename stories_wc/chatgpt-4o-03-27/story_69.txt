The hologram repair shop buzzed with static and the scent of soldered circuits, tucked between a shuttered bakery and a pawn shop that only opened during eclipses. <words>26</words>  
Elias, a druid whose magic had always been more suggestion than spell, sat cross-legged behind the counter, cradling a dented lunch tin like a relic. <words>50</words>  
He wasn’t sure if he was meant to fix holograms or simply listen to their flickering ghosts whisper through broken projectors. <words>65</words>  
The lunch tin had belonged to his grandmother, a woman who’d once turned a riot into a garden with nothing but compost and conviction. <words>84</words>  
Inside the tin were dried petals, a cracked compass, and a note that read: “Forge beauty from anarchy, or be swallowed by it.” <words>102</words>  
Elias had wandered far since finding the note, drifting through cities like pollen, never quite landing, always searching for the right soil. <words>118</words>  
His latest path had led him to this shop, open only throughout library hours, as if knowledge itself dictated when broken illusions could be mended. <words>138</words>  
He spent mornings repairing holograms of lost pets and forgotten lovers, afternoons auditioning through back-alley theater troupes that cast by instinct, not résumé. <words>157</words>  
Each audition was a ritual, a test of whether his uniquely common presence could stir something real in a world of projected perfection. <words>174</words>  
He never got a callback, but the directors always looked at him like they’d seen a ghost they couldn’t name. <words>188</words>  
It was during one such audition, beneath a flickering streetlamp and a leaking awning, that he met Marla, a mime who never stopped humming. <words>207</words>  
She watched him perform a monologue about a tree that forgot how to grow, then handed him a flyer for a show called “Obligation.” <words>226</words>  
“It’s about the ties we didn’t choose,” she said, her voice like wind through reeds. <words>236</words>  
Elias nodded, unsure if he was agreeing or just afraid to disagree. <words>246</words>  
He showed up the next day, lunch tin in hand, and was cast not as a character, but as the stage itself. <words>263</words>  
They painted his arms with moss and wired his fingers to pulse with light; he became the forest that bore witness to every betrayal. <words>281</words>  
During rehearsals, he felt something shift—his uncertainty no longer a flaw, but a mirror for the audience’s own doubts. <words>296</words>  
The show ran only during library hours, in the back room of the hologram shop, where books hummed and projectors blinked like fireflies. <words>314</words>  
People came, not for the plot, but for the feeling that something fragile and real was being held together by invisible threads. <words>331</words>  
Elias never spoke on stage, but his presence said everything: that beauty could be forged from chaos, that obligation could bloom into choice. <words>349</words>  
After the final performance, Marla kissed his forehead and whispered, “You wandered into the right story.” <words>361</words>  
He opened the lunch tin one last time and found a new note: “You are the soil.” <words>374</words>  
The holograms flickered around him, not broken now, but dancing, as if they too had found their purpose. <words>388</words>  
Elias smiled, uncertain still, but rooted. <words>392</words>
