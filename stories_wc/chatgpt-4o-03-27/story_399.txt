The witch’s crystal scrying room shimmered with starlight, its domed ceiling open to the cosmos, where constellations pulsed like ancient runes. <words>21</words>  
Beneath the celestial canopy, the grumpy crypt caretaker, Thorne, hunched over a sand mandala etched with fractal precision. <words>34</words>  
He had never believed in magic, but tonight, belief was irrelevant—he needed answers, and the patterns in the sand whispered truths. <words>47</words>  
Each grain shimmered as he jiggled the edge of the mandala with a trembling hand, watching the symbols multiply singular into mirrored infinities. <words>61</words>  
The unmarked cardboard tube lay beside him, innocuous yet humming with a presence that made his bones ache. <words>72</words>  
He had found it buried beneath the crypt’s oldest tomb, sealed in wax and wrapped in a child’s burial shroud. <words>85</words>  
Inside, he’d discovered not a scroll or relic, but a sliver of obsidian etched with a scream only the soul could hear. <words>99</words>  
That scream had awakened something within him—an uprising of memories long buried, traumas he had entombed beneath years of silence. <words>112</words>  
He had once been a soldier, then a mourner, then a man who chose the dead over the living. <words>123</words>  
Now, as stargazing hours passed and the mandala shifted, he saw the uprising was not against others, but within himself. <words>136</words>  
The trauma he had buried had multiplied, singular pain fracturing into countless echoes that haunted his every breath. <words>148</words>  
The crystal spheres around the room began to glow, reflecting not stars, but moments of his past—his brother’s last breath, his mother’s silence. <words>162</words>  
He reached for the obsidian shard, its surface cold and slick, and pressed it into the center of the mandala. <words>174</words>  
The sand recoiled, then danced, forming a vortex that pulled the shard inward, drawing his memories with it. <words>185</words>  
He felt the uprising quell—not vanish, but settle, like a storm choosing to sleep rather than rage. <words>196</words>  
The witch, unseen until now, stepped from the shadows, her voice a whisper of wind through bone. <words>207</words>  
“You’ve faced it,” she said, “and in doing so, you’ve become more than a keeper of the dead.” <words>219</words>  
Thorne looked up, the stars reflected in his eyes no longer distant, but part of him. <words>229</words>  
He understood now: trauma was not a curse, but a crucible, forging the self through fire and memory. <words>241</words>  
The mandala dissolved, the sand scattering like stardust, and the room fell silent save for the heartbeat of the cosmos. <words>254</words>  
Thorne stood, straighter than he had in years, the unmarked tube now empty, its burden lifted. <words>265</words>  
He left the scrying room not as a grumpy caretaker, but as a man who had faced the uprising within. <words>278</words>  
Outside, the stars continued their vigil, and Thorne walked beneath them, each step a quiet triumph. <words>289</words>  
The crypt would still be there, but now, so would he—whole, haunted, and finally, awake. <words>300</words>
