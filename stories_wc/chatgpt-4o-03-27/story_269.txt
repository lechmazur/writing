The brass gears of the steampunk observation deck groaned as the storm rolled in, lightning illuminating the sky like fractured glass. <words>21</words>  
Elias, the nostalgic tailor, stood before the dusty mirror bolted to the deck’s far wall, his reflection flickering with each thunderclap. <words>42</words>  
He had sewn suits for kings and paupers alike, but none had prepared him for the truth he now faced. <words>58</words>  
The mirror, long ignored, had begun to whisper during storms—improbable confessions that unraveled the seams of reality. <words>74</words>  
Tonight, it spoke again, its voice subtly menacing yet oddly familiar: “You’ve lived this life before, Elias, and others too.” <words>93</words>  
He clutched the lapel of his waistcoat, stitched with thread from a world he barely remembered, and whispered, “Show me.” <words>110</words>  
The mirror shimmered, revealing a parallel life—another Elias, younger, crueler, standing over a broken loom and a weeping apprentice. <words>128</words>  
He recoiled, heart pounding, but the storm outside howled louder, demanding he watch. <words>139</words>  
In that other life, he had sought power through manipulation, tailoring not clothes but destinies. <words>153</words>  
“I was him?” Elias asked, voice trembling, the wind rattling the deck’s copper bones. <words>165</words>  
The mirror replied, “You are all your selves, stitched together by choices and storms.” <words>177</words>  
He turned from the glass, seeking reassurance in the familiar hum of the deck’s machinery, but found none. <words>192</words>  
Instead, he remembered the final code he had broken—a cipher hidden in the hem of a royal cloak. <words>208</words>  
It had revealed the existence of the Ascendants, beings who transcended mortality by mastering all their parallel lives. <words>224</words>  
Elias had laughed then, dismissing it as myth, but now the mirror’s truths made him reconsider. <words>237</words>  
He stepped closer, the storm’s fury matching the tempest within him, and asked, “Can I ascend?” <words>251</words>  
The mirror’s surface rippled, revealing yet another Elias—this one serene, eyes glowing with knowledge beyond time. <words>266</words>  
“You must reconcile them all,” the serene Elias said, “even the ones you fear.” <words>278</words>  
Lightning struck the deck’s spire, and the mirror cracked, but the vision held. <words>289</words>  
Elias fell to his knees, overwhelmed by the weight of his fragmented soul. <words>301</words>  
“I only ever wanted to make things whole,” he whispered, tears mixing with rain. <words>314</words>  
The mirror, now fractured, reflected every version of him—tailor, tyrant, seeker, sage. <words>326</words>  
He reached out, fingers brushing the glass, and felt warmth instead of cold. <words>338</words>  
The storm began to calm, as if the sky itself had been reassured by his resolve. <words>351</words>  
Elias stood, spine straighter, eyes clearer, and turned from the mirror toward the deck’s edge. <words>364</words>  
Below, the city shimmered with steam and promise, unaware of the man who had just chosen transcendence. <words>379</words>  
He would tailor his soul as he had tailored suits—with care, precision, and hope stitched into every seam. <words>396</words>  
The storm had passed, but Elias knew others would come, and he would meet them all. <words>409</words>  
For he was no longer just a tailor—he was the thread that bound his lives together. <words>423</words>  
And in that binding, he would ascend beyond mortal limits, one storm at a time. <words>436</words>
