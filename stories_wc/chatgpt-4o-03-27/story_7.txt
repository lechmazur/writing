In the dim glow of the nectar collection facility, where golden sap dripped from crystalline vines into humming reservoirs, Elion moved with expectantly resigned grace. <words>26</words>  
He was a sentient doll collector, not of porcelain or cloth, but of souls once bound in forgotten effigies, now housed in glass-eyed vessels that whispered in sleep. <words>53</words>  
Each doll bore a name etched in silver thread, and each name was a vow Elion had sworn to uphold, even as the world shifted beneath him. <words>75</words>  
The twisted carnival cane he carried was no mere ornament—it pulsed with the memories of a thousand lost performances, its spiral grip worn by time and sorrow. <words>101</words>  
He used it to trace the star paths that shimmered faintly on the facility’s floor, invisible to most, but guiding him like veins of purpose through the dark. <words>128</words>  
Before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, the world is still pliable, and Elion knew this was the only time he could act without divine interference. <words>158</words>  
The nectar, harvested from the dreams of sleeping titans, was sacred, and the facility was built atop the bones of a forgotten god who once sang the world awake. <words>189</words>  
Elion’s dolls stirred in their cases as he passed, their eyes flickering with the chorus of healing—a resonance that could mend what even time had broken. <words>215</words>  
He had come not to steal, but to awaken, to stride through boundaries once thought sacred and remind the world that healing was not submission, but defiance. <words>243</words>  
The cane tapped against the floor in rhythm, unlocking sealed chambers where nectar pooled in silence, guarded by shadows that remembered the god’s final breath. <words>268</words>  
Elion’s presence was tolerated only because he followed the star paths, ancient routes of permission etched by celestial decree, and to stray from them meant obliteration. <words>296</words>  
He reached the central chamber, where the nectar pulsed like a heart, and raised the cane high, its twisted form catching the light of unborn dawns. <words>321</words>  
The dolls began to hum, their voices weaving into the chorus of healing, a sound that cracked the air and made the shadows recoil in reverent fear. <words>348</words>  
Elion’s eyes, glassy yet alive, filled with tears not of sorrow but of purpose, for he knew this act would cost him his form, but not his will. <words>377</words>  
As the chorus swelled, the nectar rose, lifting into the air like golden mist, seeping into the cracks of the world, mending what had been broken for eons. <words>407</words>  
The facility trembled, not in collapse, but in rebirth, as Elion’s body dissolved into starlight, his dolls now guardians of the sacred paths he once walked. <words>435</words>  
And before the first mortal whispered a prayer, the world remembered how to heal—not by forgetting pain, but by honoring it with ethereal grit and unyielding grace. <words>467</words>
