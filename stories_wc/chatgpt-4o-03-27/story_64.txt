At the hush before the judge reads the verdict, Elian stood beneath the drifting canopy of the floating marketplace, his fingers trembling around a cracked scale from a mythical beast. <words>33</words> 

The scale shimmered faintly, its fractured surface catching the light like a broken promise, and Elian wondered again if immortality was worth the price he’d paid. <words>58</words> 

He was an alchemist, technically wild by guild standards, having never completed the formal rites, but his knowledge of ancient methods was unmatched—especially those hidden in plain sight. <words>83</words> 

The marketplace, tethered to a dozen hot air balloons, swayed gently above the forest canopy, its stalls creaking with the weight of rare spices, forbidden books, and whispered secrets. <words>111</words> 

Elian had come not for trade, but to safeguard something older than the marketplace itself: a map etched in the scuffs of a centuries-old marble floor beneath the judge’s dais. <words>141</words> 

The floor, worn by generations of feet and forgotten rituals, held a code only he could read—one that led to the forest trails where the mythical beast had once shed its scale. <words>172</words> 

He had found the scale years ago, buried beneath moss and time, and since then, it had whispered to him in dreams of endless life and the cost it demanded. <words>200</words> 

The cost was not gold or blood, but memory—each year of life traded for a name, a face, a moment once cherished and now lost. <words>225</words> 

Elian had already forgotten the name of his sister, the color of his mother’s eyes, and the sound of his own laughter. <words>245</words> 

Still, he pressed on, driven by a mundane miracle: the desire to map the forest trails so others might find their way without losing themselves. <words>270</words> 

The judge, robed in velvet and silence, raised a hand to still the murmurs of the crowd, and Elian knelt, pretending reverence while his eyes traced the scuffed marble. <words>299</words> 

Each mark was a letter, each groove a direction, and as he read, the map unfolded in his mind like a living thing, pulsing with forgotten paths. <words>324</words> 

He had to safeguard it, not for himself, but for those who would come after—those who might seek immortality and need to know the way back. <words>349</words> 

The judge’s voice broke the hush, pronouncing a sentence Elian barely heard, for he had already risen, the cracked scale clenched in his palm like a compass. <words>375</words> 

He stepped away from the dais, the marketplace tilting slightly as a gust caught the balloons, and he smiled, uncertain but resolute. <words>397</words> 

The price of immortality was steep, but perhaps, in mapping the way, he could make it less lonely for those who dared to pay it. <words>423</words> 

And in that small, technically wild act of defiance, Elian found a kind of peace, a mundane miracle stitched into the sky above the forest. <words>448</words> 

He vanished into the crowd, the scale warm in his hand, the map alive in his mind, and the verdict echoing behind him like a fading storm. <words>475</words>
