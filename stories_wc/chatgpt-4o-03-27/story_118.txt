The secret agent training facility, nestled beneath a crumbling observatory, hummed with anticipation through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery. <words>21</words>  
Inside, the hive-mind therapist known only as Echo-9 adjusted its neural resonance, preparing to counsel a particularly fractured recruit. <words>36</words>  
Echo-9 was not a person but a collective consciousness, a uniformly peculiar blend of retired spies, philosophers, and one disgraced poet. <words>51</words>  
Its chamber smelled of wax and ozone, lit only by a dozen candles whose slow drip formed coded shapes on the floor. <words>66</words>  
Each shape was a memory, a confession, or a regret—decoded not by eyes, but by the mind attuned to the sound of hindsight. <words>82</words>  
Agent Lira entered, clutching a scuffed phone charger plug like a talisman, its frayed wires whispering of missions gone wrong. <words>96</words>  
She had come not for healing, but to anchor the ephemeral in reality—to drain the ghosts of her past into something solid. <words>111</words>  
Echo-9’s voice, a chorus of mismatched tones, greeted her with merry bitterness: “You’ve brought your tether, Agent Lira. Shall we begin?” <words>126</words>  
She nodded, placing the charger plug into a shallow bowl of wax, watching as the heat coaxed out its hidden story. <words>140</words>  
The wax dripped slowly, forming a spiral that pulsed with encoded guilt, each drop a syllable in the language of regret. <words>154</words>  
Lira’s eyes flickered as Echo-9 translated: “You hesitated in Prague. The diplomat died. You blamed the weather.” <words>166</words>  
“I blamed the wind,” she whispered, voice cracking like old vinyl. <words>173</words>  
“The wind is not your enemy,” Echo-9 replied, “but the echo of your indecision.” <words>183</words>  
The spiral widened, revealing a second shape—a jagged line intersecting a circle. <words>192</words>  
“Berlin,” Lira said, recognizing the pattern. “The train. The child.” <words>200</words>  
“You saved the mission,” Echo-9 intoned, “but lost the boy.” <words>208</words>  
Lira’s hands trembled as the wax continued to drip, each shape a wound she’d sealed with silence. <words>220</words>  
“I want to remember,” she said. “Not just the facts. The weight.” <words>230</words>  
Echo-9 pulsed with approval, its voices harmonizing into something almost human. <words>239</words>  
“To remember is to drain the poison,” it said, “and to leave behind the antidote.” <words>250</words>  
The final shape formed—a perfect square, unbroken, unburned. <words>257</words>  
Lira stared at it, tears catching the candlelight. <words>264</words>  
“What does it mean?” she asked. <words>270</words>  
“It means you’re ready to forget just enough to move forward,” Echo-9 replied. <words>281</words>  
Outside, the wind carried the sound of hindsight across the facility, a low hum of lessons learned too late. <words>295</words>  
Lira stepped into the corridor, the scuffed charger still warm in her pocket, her past now etched in wax and memory. <words>310</words>  
Behind her, Echo-9 dimmed, its voices retreating into silence, waiting for the next soul seeking to anchor the ephemeral. <words>324</words>  
The candles flickered once, then steadied, their coded shapes cooling into permanence. <words>333</words>  
In the merry bitterness of that night, something fragile had been made real. <words>343</words>  
And in the morning, the bold discovery would not be a gadget or a weapon, but the resilience of a haunted mind. <words>358</words>  
For in a world of secrets, the truest mission was always to survive oneself. <words>368</words>
