The comet had burned across the sky for seven days, its tail a molten scar above the ghostly orchard where the hermit moved with deliberate wilderness. <words>27</words>  
He had no name, only the pressed flower album he carried, each bloom a memory of a place he’d once tried to coax life from barren ground. <words>55</words>  
The orchard, long dead, whispered with the brittle sighs of trees that remembered fruit, and the hermit listened, translating their grief via the exact angle of a half-bent weathervane. <words>84</words>  
He moved from tree to tree, his steps slow, mindful, as if each choice of direction might awaken something slumbering beneath the frostbitten soil. <words>108</words>  
Though he lived alone, the hermit was not without purpose; he was theoretically rebellious, defying the decay of the world not with fire, but with patience. <words>135</words>  
Each night, beneath the comet’s glow, he opened the album and pressed his fingers to the petals, recalling the scent of lavender fields, the hum of bees. <words>163</words>  
He believed that memory, when tended with care, could become seed again, and so he whispered names into the wind, names of flowers and places and lost friends. <words>194</words>  
The orchard had once belonged to a village, now vanished, its people scattered by drought and despair, leaving behind only the trees and the weathervane. <words>220</words>  
The hermit had returned not to mourn, but to choose—mindfully, rebelliously—to believe that life could still be coaxed from the ground. <words>243</words>  
He studied the weathervane each morning, noting its half-bent angle, translating its stubborn lean into a direction, a rhythm, a ritual. <words>268</words>  
He dug shallow furrows beneath the trees, planting nothing but fragments of petals from the album, trusting that intention might root where seeds could not. <words>296</words>  
The comet’s fire grew brighter each night, casting long shadows that danced like ghosts among the branches, but the hermit did not flinch. <words>320</words>  
He moved throughout the orchard, throughout moving time itself, as if the act of tending could slow the sky’s unraveling. <words>342</words>  
One morning, he found a sprout—small, green, defiant—pushing through the ash where he’d laid a violet’s remains. <words>362</words>  
He knelt, pressing the album to his chest, and for the first time in years, he smiled, not because he had won, but because he had chosen. <words>394</words>  
The orchard, still ghostly, still quiet, seemed to breathe with him, and the weathervane turned slightly, as if nodding in agreement. <words>418</words>  
Above, the comet began to fade, its fire dimming, not extinguished, but changed—like the hermit, like the orchard, like the world. <words>443</words>
