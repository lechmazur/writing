The floating yoga studio bobbed gently on the harbor, its bamboo walls swaying with the rhythm of the soothing tides. <words>17</words> 

Inside, amid the scent of sandalwood and salt, Eron adjusted his hood, hiding the blush that always betrayed him. <words>34</words> 

He was the village’s executioner, a role passed down through generations, but his heart beat not for death, but for dance. <words>52</words> 

The studio doubled as a sanctuary where his family preserved ancient dance movements, each step a tribute to ancestors long gone. <words>70</words> 

They celebrated milestones not with feasts or fireworks, but with a unique ritual: a silent performance at dawn, barefoot on the floating floor. <words>91</words> 

Today marked the 100th year since the first executioner-dancer, and Eron’s turn to lead the ritual had finally come. <words>106</words> 

Outside, the village buzzed with festival preparations—lanterns strung between boats, spices sizzling in pans, laughter echoing across the water. <words>123</words> 

But inside, Eron stood alone, clutching a cheap keychain shaped like a lotus, a gift from his late mother. <words>140</words> 

It was sincerely rare for him to feel ready, but the keychain grounded him, reminding him of her whispered words: “Ferocity can be kind.” <words>161</words> 

He stepped onto the mat, the tide’s lullaby beneath him, and began the dance—fluid, fierce, and full of grace. <words>177</words> 

Each movement told a story: of mercy in judgment, of strength in restraint, of a blade that never thirsted for blood. <words>193</words> 

As he spun, he flinched—just slightly—when a gull cried overhead, a reflex from years of hiding his softness. <words>208</words> 

But he recovered, letting the benign ferocity of the dance carry him forward, his limbs slicing the air like poetry. <words>224</words> 

From the dock, his younger sister watched, her eyes wide with awe, clutching her own keychain—a matching lotus. <words>239</words> 

She would be next, the first female executioner-dancer, and Eron’s performance would be her guide. <words>252</words> 

The final pose held, arms outstretched like wings, toes barely touching the mat, as if he floated above the tides. <words>268</words> 

Applause erupted from the boats nearby, villagers pausing their preparations to honor the ritual they barely understood. <words>283</words> 

Eron bowed, his hood falling back, revealing the blush that no longer shamed him but crowned him. <words>297</words> 

He stepped off the mat, handing the keychain to his sister, who took it with trembling hands and a nod. <words>313</words> 

Together, they watched the sun rise, its light dancing on the water, as the studio rocked gently beneath their feet. <words>329</words> 

The tides whispered promises of peace, and for the first time, Eron believed them. <words>340</words> 

He had preserved the dance, honored his family, and transformed his role from feared to revered. <words>354</words> 

In the floating studio, amid the scent of incense and sea, the executioner had become a guardian of grace. <words>370</words> 

And as the festival drums began to beat, he smiled—not with pride, but with quiet, enduring purpose. <words>384</words>
