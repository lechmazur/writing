The snow fell in soft spirals outside the ephemeral art gallery, where silence hung like a veil over forgotten canvases and half-finished sculptures. <words>21</words> 

Inside, a hardheaded traveler named Elian wiped frost from his coat, his boots leaving wet impressions on the marble floor. <words>36</words> 

He had come not for the art, but for the scraps of prophecy rumored to be hidden in the library’s neglected corner. <words>51</words> 

The gallery, open only amid snow days, was a sanctuary for those seeking more than beauty—those desperate enough to pay the price of power. <words>69</words> 

Elian’s heart, wholeheartedly broken by years of wandering and loss, beat with a quiet urgency as he passed beneath a sculpture of a weeping tree. <words>88</words> 

He had once believed in permanence, in love, in home—but nature had taken all of it, and now he sought solace in her embrace again. <words>108</words> 

The library was a dim annex, its shelves bowed with age, its air thick with dust and forgotten longing. <words>121</words> 

He struggled to read the faded ink on torn parchment, piecing together riddles that spoke of a secret book safe hidden behind a painting of fire. <words>141</words> 

The painting, a swirling tempest of crimson and gold, pulsed faintly as if aware of his presence. <words>153</words> 

With demure audacity, Elian pressed his palm to the canvas, and it dissolved into mist, revealing a hollow in the wall. <words>169</words> 

Inside lay the book safe, carved from obsidian and bound with vines that twitched at his touch. <words>181</words> 

He opened it, revealing a single page: “To command the storm, surrender your roots.” <words>192</words> 

The words struck him like thunder—he had no roots left to give, only the ache of their absence. <words>205</words> 

Still, he whispered the phrase aloud, and the gallery trembled as snow outside turned to ash. <words>217</words> 

Power surged through him, wild and cold, and he saw visions of forests burning, rivers reversing, mountains crumbling beneath his will. <words>233</words> 

But with each vision came a deeper emptiness, a hollowness that echoed louder than the wind. <words>245</words> 

He had struggled so long to find peace, and now he held destruction in his hands. <words>257</words> 

The price of power was not pain—it was the absence of everything else. <words>267</words> 

Elian stepped back, closed the book safe, and let the vines reclaim it. <words>278</words> 

He walked out of the gallery as the snow returned, soft and forgiving. <words>289</words> 

In the distance, a grove of birch trees shimmered beneath the moonlight, untouched and waiting. <words>301</words> 

He trudged toward them, not to conquer, but to kneel, to listen, to begin again. <words>313</words> 

The storm within him quieted as he entered the woods, each step a surrender, each breath a prayer. <words>327</words> 

He had found no answers in prophecy, only the truth that solace could not be taken—it had to be earned. <words>344</words> 

And so, the hardheaded traveler laid down his burdens beneath a snow-laden branch, letting the cold cradle his weary soul. <words>360</words> 

The forest whispered nothing, and in that silence, he heard everything he needed. <words>372</words> 

Power had offered him dominion, but nature offered him peace. <words>382</words> 

He chose peace. <words>384</words>
