The witch’s greenhouse clung to the hill like a stubborn vine, its glass panes fogged with breath from forgotten spells and the scent of rosemary mourning. <words>23</words>  
Inside, the uptight scribe adjusted his collar, his fingers trembling as he placed the prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop on a moss-covered table. <words>45</words>  
He had found it hidden in a sealed envelope, the adhesive still faintly sweet, and had analyzed its residue to trace the sender’s intent. <words>66</words>  
The analysis led him here, to this greenhouse perched among gravestones, where the dead whispered secrets through root and stone. <words>84</words>  
He was certainly uncertain—his mind a ledger of logic, yet his heart a ledger of longing. <words>96</words>  
The bulb, though inert, pulsed with a promise he couldn’t name, as if it waited for the right moment to awaken. <words>112</words>  
He bellowed into the silence, a sound too large for his narrow frame, startling a crow from the rafters. <words>126</words>  
“Show yourself!” he cried, though he feared what might answer. <words>134</words>  
From the shadows, the witch emerged, her eyes like cracked glass, her hands stained with chlorophyll and grief. <words>148</words>  
“You seek empathy,” she said, voice brittle as dried thyme. <words>157</words>  
“I seek to cradle it,” he replied, “in arms of steel, so it cannot be broken again.” <words>170</words>  
She studied him, then the bulb, then the gravestones beyond the glass, each one a name she once whispered to sleep. <words>186</words>  
“Empathy is not a thing to be caged,” she murmured, “but a light to be shared.” <words>198</words>  
He hesitated, then offered her the bulb, his fingers brushing hers—cold, calloused, alive. <words>210</words>  
She placed it in a socket grown from vine and bone, and with a twist, it flickered. <words>222</words>  
In that flicker, the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, he saw himself—not as a scribe, but as a soul. <words>239</words>  
The greenhouse warmed, not with heat, but with understanding, as if the dead approved. <words>250</words>  
He felt the steel in his chest soften, not melt, but bend—enough to hold without harming. <words>263</words>  
The witch smiled, a buried optimism rising like steam from damp earth. <words>273</words>  
“You are changing,” she said. <words>277</words>  
“I am being changed,” he corrected, voice softer than ink on parchment. <words>288</words>  
Outside, the gravestones shimmered faintly, as if touched by dawn. <words>297</words>  
He turned to leave, but paused, the bulb now glowing steadily behind him. <words>309</words>  
It was not brightness that mattered, but the quiet transformation it signaled. <words>320</words>  
And in that silence, he found the courage to carry empathy—not as burden, but as beacon. <words>334</words>  
The witch returned to her plants, humming a tune only the dead remembered. <words>345</words>  
The scribe descended the hill, his steps lighter, his certainty still uncertain—but now, it was enough. <words>359</words>  
Behind him, the greenhouse pulsed like a heartbeat, steady and strange. <words>369</words>  
And somewhere in the world, another envelope waited to be opened. <words>379</words>
