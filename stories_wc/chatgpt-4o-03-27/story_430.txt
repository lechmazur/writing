The reaver stood at the edge of Kaleidoscope Park, where the trees shimmered like stained glass and the air smelled faintly of burnt sugar. <words>23</words>  
He was a closed-off man, stitched together by silence and scars, his armor rusted in places that told stories he refused to share. <words>45</words>  
Children laughed in the distance, their joy echoing like a language he’d once known but forgotten. <words>58</words>  
In his gloved hand, he held a crumpled piece of paper—a child’s drawing of a monstrous figure with a crooked smile and stars for eyes. <words>81</words>  
The figure looked like him, grotesque in a way that was almost charming, as if the child had loved the monster anyway. <words>101</words>  
He unfolded it carefully, smoothing the wrinkles with fingers that had once crushed skulls but now trembled. <words>116</words>  
In the margins of the drawing, scrawled in uneven handwriting, were poems—nagging little verses that rhymed too well to be accidental. <words>137</words>  
They whispered of hunger, of longing, of a kiss that could taste the stars and end the ache passed down like a curse. <words>157</words>  
The reaver scoffed, a sound like gravel in his throat, but he read every line twice. <words>170</words>  
He knew the handwriting—it was his own, from a time before the first lie was told, before he learned to wear silence like armor. <words>194</words>  
The drawing had been folded into his coat pocket for years, forgotten, like the child who’d drawn it. <words>208</words>  
He remembered now: a daughter with eyes like nova flares and a laugh that could split the sky. <words>222</words>  
She had nagged him constantly, not with words, but with poems slipped into his boots, his bread, his blade sheath. <words>241</words>  
Each one a plea: come back, be more, break the pattern. <words>249</words>  
But he hadn’t listened, too wrapped in the generational rot that had made monsters of men and myths of fathers. <words>267</words>  
Now, in the park where colors danced like memories, he felt the weight of every ignored verse. <words>281</words>  
He sat on a bench shaped like a crescent moon, the drawing in his lap, and began to write. <words>296</words>  
His poem was jagged, clumsy, but honest—a mocking affection bleeding through every line. <words>309</words>  
He wrote of stars and kisses, of daughters and monsters, of how he’d tasted nothing but ash. <words>323</words>  
He left the poem on the bench, pinned by a stone, and walked into the kaleidoscope trees. <words>337</words>  
Somewhere, he hoped, the pattern had cracked. <words>343</words>  
Somewhere, a child might draw a different monster—one who stayed. <words>353</words>  
And maybe, just maybe, the stars would taste sweet. <words>361</words>  
Behind him, the wind picked up the paper, and the park shimmered with a new kind of light. <words>376</words>  
The reaver didn’t look back. <words>380</words>
