In the second a simple yes or no can change everything, Captain Elira knelt beside a rusted luggage carousel in the abandoned spaceport baggage claim, her fingers tracing a detached coat button etched with the insignia of the Old Readers’ Guild. <words>36</words>  
The button had belonged to her mentor, Sarn, who vanished decades ago after declaring the Guild’s mission obsolete in a galaxy that no longer read. <words>58</words>  
Elira, pilot of the flying library Aetheris, had returned to this forgotten place not for closure, but to preserve a fading tradition that once bound worlds together through stories. <words>84</words>  
The air was thick with dust and memory, and the silence hummed with the fractal sorrow of a thousand unread books. <words>100</words>  
She brewed thick, bitter coffee in a dented thermos, then poured it into a cracked saucer, watching the stains form spirals and lines like ancient constellations. <words>123</words>  
By reading the future in coffee stains—a practice both spiritually secular and deeply personal—she sought guidance from the patterns that once guided the Guild’s path. <words>147</words>  
The stains revealed a bridge, not of stone or steel, but of shared understanding—a bridge to unity forged through the act of reading. <words>169</words>  
But the stains also showed a shadow: a decision looming, a yes or no that would obliterate either her mission or her self. <words>189</words>  
She remembered Sarn’s last words: “When the stories stop, so does the soul of the stars.” <words>201</words>  
Elira stood, clutching the button, and walked toward the carousel’s control panel, where a hidden compartment held the last transmission beacon of the Guild. <words>223</words>  
Activating it would summon the remnants of the Guild, scattered and silent, to rally once more—or expose them to those who sought to erase them. <words>247</words>  
Her hand hovered over the switch, the weight of tradition pressing against the gravity of fear. <words>261</words>  
She whispered, “Yes,” and pressed it. <words>267</words>  
The beacon pulsed, sending a signal across the void, a story begun anew in the language of light. <words>285</words>  
Above, the Aetheris stirred, its shelves trembling with anticipation, engines humming with remembered purpose. <words>300</words>  
In that moment, the bridge to unity began to rebuild—not through conquest or creed, but through the quiet power of shared imagination. <words>322</words>  
Elira turned back to the saucer, where the coffee stain now resembled an open book, its pages fluttering in unseen wind. <words>342</words>  
She smiled, tears tracing the dust on her cheeks, and whispered, “Let them read.” <words>355</words>  
The carousel creaked to life behind her, as if the spaceport itself remembered what it once was. <words>371</words>  
And in the silence that followed, the stars listened. <words>378</words>
