Sir Cael, a cold-natured knight turned covert operative, stood at the hush of a deserted intersection late at night, his breath fogging in the dim glow of a flickering streetlamp. <words>26</words>  
The secret agent center loomed behind him, disguised as a shuttered bakery, its windows dark but its walls humming with encrypted transmissions. <words>45</words>  
He adjusted the strap of his satchel, which held not weapons, but a growing collection of folk remedies gathered from forgotten villages and whispered legends. <words>68</words>  
Though trained in steel and silence, Cael had become lawfully rebellious, bending protocol to support the preservation of ancient healing arts. <words>89</words>  
His latest mission had taken him to a crumbling chapel in the northern woods, where he found an incomplete family altar beneath a collapsed roof. <words>112</words>  
Among the scattered relics was a child’s lost mitten, woolen and faded, tucked beside a cracked ceramic bowl once used for herbal infusions. <words>135</words>  
He took the mitten, not as evidence, but as a symbol—an echo of warmth in a world he had long viewed through frostbitten detachment. <words>159</words>  
Back at the center, he placed the mitten on his desk, beside sketches he’d begun drawing—unbidden, untrained—of the altars he’d seen. <words>181</words>  
Each line he traced awakened something dormant, a flicker of artistry that defied his rigid past and hinted at a soul thawing beneath armor. <words>204</words>  
He didn’t understand why the altars moved him, only that they did, and that his hands now itched more for charcoal than for a blade. <words>228</words>  
His supervisor, Agent Mirelle, noticed the change and confronted him in the archive room, where Cael had begun cataloging remedies with poetic annotations. <words>251</words>  
“You’re drifting,” she said, her voice low but not unkind, “but maybe that’s what this place needs—a knight who remembers why we protect.” <words>275</words>  
Cael met her gaze, the cold in his eyes softened by the ember of purpose, and nodded once, a silent vow to continue. <words>297</words>  
He began leaving sketches at the incomplete altars he visited, small offerings of support to families long gone, his rebellion now a quiet devotion. <words>321</words>  
The mitten remained on his desk, a muse and a memory, reminding him that even the smallest loss could inspire the greatest awakening. <words>343</words>  
In time, his art spread through the center, pinned to bulletin boards and tucked into dossiers, a secret gallery of healing and resistance. <words>366</words>  
And though he still moved through shadows, Sir Cael no longer walked alone—his path lit by the warmth he once believed he’d lost. <words>388</words>
