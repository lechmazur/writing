The wind whispered through the rusted skeletons of roller coasters as Edwin adjusted his binoculars, pretending to bird-watch amid the haunted amusement park’s prize booth. <words>27</words>  
He wasn’t here for birds, not really—he was here because the tapestry of fate had begun to unravel, and he could feel it tugging at his spine. <words>52</words>  
Cursed to speak only the truth, Edwin had learned to wield honesty like a scalpel, politely vindictive in every syllable, slicing through delusion with surgical precision. <words>74</words>  
The vintage pencil box in his coat pocket rattled softly, its contents shifting with each breath, a relic from a childhood he barely remembered but could never forget. <words>99</words>  
It had once belonged to his sister, now a statue in the garden of regrets—petrified during a waxing crescent moon, when Edwin had told her the truth she refused to hear. <words>127</words>  
He hadn’t meant to turn her to stone, but the curse worked with the phases of the moon, and that night, his words had aligned with celestial cruelty. <words>153</words>  
Now, he waited beneath the flickering bulbs of the prize booth, where stuffed animals hung like limp ghosts, for the next soul whose mind needed evolution. <words>177</words>  
The park had long been abandoned, but it pulsed with spectral energy, a place where fate’s threads tangled and tightened, and where Edwin’s purpose found clarity. <words>201</words>  
A girl approached, no older than sixteen, her eyes sharp with skepticism, her hands clutching a notebook filled with sketches of birds and questions about the world. <words>227</words>  
“You’re not here for birds,” she said, her voice steady, “You’re here for something else.” <words>239</words>  
Edwin smiled, the kind of smile that held both apology and challenge. <words>248</words>  
“I’m here to tell you the truth,” he said, and the pencil box trembled. <words>260</words>  
She raised an eyebrow. “What truth?” <words>266</words>  
“That your mind is a cage gilded with cleverness, and you mistake observation for understanding.” <words>278</words>  
The moon, now in its first quarter, shimmered through the broken glass canopy above them. <words>289</words>  
She flinched, as if his words had struck bone, but didn’t retreat. <words>299</words>  
Instead, she opened her notebook and tore out a page, offering it to him. <words>311</words>  
On it was a drawing of a bird mid-flight, its wings tangled in threads that resembled a tapestry. <words>325</words>  
“I see the threads,” she whispered. <words>330</words>  
Edwin took the page, and the pencil box fell silent, as if appeased. <words>341</words>  
“You’re ready,” he said, and the booth around them shimmered, the ghosts of prizes past bowing in silent approval. <words>355</words>  
The girl blinked, and for a moment, her skin shimmered like marble, but the moon was not yet full. <words>368</words>  
“You won’t petrify me,” she said. <words>374</words>  
“No,” Edwin replied, “You’ll evolve.” <words>380</words>  
And with that, he handed her the vintage pencil box, now warm to the touch, its curse passed on like a torch. <words>397</words>  
As she walked away, the tapestry of fate rewove itself behind her, threads tightening with purpose, and Edwin vanished into the layered tranquility of the night. <words>417</words>
