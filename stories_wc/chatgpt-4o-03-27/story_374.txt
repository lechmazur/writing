The lonesome minstrel tuned his synth-lute atop the rooftop horse stables, his fingers moving with a bizarrely typical grace. <words>20</words>  
Below, the futuristic metropolis hummed with the low thrum of hovercars and the hiss of espresso machines amid coffee lines. <words>36</words>  
He wasn’t there for caffeine or company—he was there to read the silent cosmos by tracking cloud patterns. <words>50</words>  
Each swirl and drift above the skyline whispered secrets, and he believed the sky held answers to questions no one dared ask. <words>66</words>  
His ancestors had bickered for generations with the family of a rival sky-reader, a feud passed down like a cursed heirloom. <words>82</words>  
The rivalry had begun over a misread storm that sank a floating opera house, and neither lineage had forgiven the other. <words>98</words>  
Now, he watched the clouds not just for truth, but to out-read his rival, who lived two rooftops away. <words>112</words>  
She, too, was a minstrel, though her melodies were sharper, her rhythms more precise, as if she argued with the wind. <words>128</words>  
They never spoke directly, only exchanged glances and the occasional cryptic verse carried by rooftop pigeons. <words>141</words>  
Today, he clutched a rubber stamp with an image so unclear it seemed to shift each time he looked at it. <words>157</words>  
It had belonged to his great-grandfather, the first to claim the clouds could be read like scripture. <words>170</words>  
The stamp was said to mark the true reader, though no one knew what the image was meant to be. <words>185</words>  
He pressed it onto a scrap of parchment, hoping the cosmos would reveal its meaning through the ink. <words>198</words>  
Instead, the mark resembled a smudge, or perhaps a bird mid-flight, or a broken harp. <words>210</words>  
Frustrated, he glanced at the rival rooftop, where she stood with her own stamp, identical and equally unreadable. <words>224</words>  
They locked eyes, and for the first time, he crossed the narrow beam between their stables. <words>236</words>  
She met him halfway, and they began to bicker—not with words, but with melodies, plucking notes that clashed and harmonized. <words>252</words>  
Their music rose above the city, drawing curious glances from those in coffee lines far below. <words>265</words>  
As they played, the clouds shifted into a spiral, a pattern neither had seen before. <words>277</words>  
Together, they tracked its movement, their inherited rivalries dissolving into shared wonder. <words>288</words>  
The cosmos, it seemed, had waited for them to listen together. <words>296</words>  
Later, they stamped the spiral onto parchment, and this time, the image was clear: two minstrels beneath a single sky. <words>312</words>  
They laughed, a sound bizarrely typical for such an enchanted moment. <words>321</words>  
From then on, they played in tandem, reading the sky not as rivals, but as co-authors of its silent verses. <words>337</words>  
The rooftop stables became a sanctuary, where horses dreamed of clouds and minstrels sang of unity. <words>349</words>  
Even amid the mundane bustle of coffee lines, people began to look up, wondering what the clouds might say next. <words>364</words>  
And the minstrel, no longer lonesome, found that the cosmos spoke clearest when shared. <words>375</words>
