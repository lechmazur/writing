The bright-eyed apprentice descended the spiral staircase into the haunted lighthouse basement, her boots echoing against the damp stone. <words>20</words>  
She carried a satchel filled with crumpled notes—each one parsed from slips left under her door by a silent benefactor. <words>39</words>  
The world above had gone dry after the last war was fought for water, leaving only salt winds and rusted pipelines. <words>58</words>  
But down here, beneath the lighthouse, secrets still flowed—especially those tied to the ancient star maps she was determined to decode. <words>78</words>  
Her name was Elira, and she was uniquely literal, a trait that made her both frustrating and indispensable to her late master. <words>98</words>  
He had once told her, “The stars don’t lie, but they do speak in riddles,” before vanishing into the sea mist. <words>117</words>  
Now, she followed his grand designs, etched into the walls of the basement in phosphorescent ink only visible under lunar light. <words>137</words>  
She unlocked the rusted panel with a phone booth key—an artifact from a defunct phone company that no longer existed. <words>155</words>  
The key clicked, and the wall groaned open, revealing a chamber pulsing with soft blue light and humming with forgotten energy. <words>175</words>  
Inside, a console blinked to life, demanding a code she had pieced together by parsing the notes slipped under her door. <words>195</words>  
Each note had been a fragment of a larger truth, written in a cipher only someone as literal as Elira could unravel. <words>215</words>  
She entered the code, and the ceiling above her shimmered, projecting a map of the stars as they had been millennia ago. <words>236</words>  
The constellations twisted, aligning into a pattern that matched the designs her master had drawn in his final, fevered days. <words>255</words>  
A voice, neither male nor female, echoed from the walls: “You seek the Wellspring. You must overcharge the beacon to reveal the path.” <words>277</words>  
Elira frowned; overcharging the beacon could collapse the entire structure, but the voice had spoken with brazen calm, as if it knew her. <words>298</words>  
She adjusted the dials, feeding more power into the beacon than it was ever meant to hold, her hands steady despite the risk. <words>319</words>  
The walls trembled, and the star map flared, revealing a hidden constellation shaped like a keyhole, pointing toward a forgotten quadrant of space. <words>340</words>  
Her heart pounded, not with fear, but with purpose—this was the culmination of her master’s grand designs and her own relentless decoding. <words>360</words>  
The floor beneath her shifted, revealing a hidden stairwell spiraling even deeper, where the true map was said to be etched in crystal. <words>380</words>  
She took one last look at the flickering beacon, then descended, the phone booth key still warm in her palm. <words>398</words>  
The haunted whispers followed her, not with menace, but with approval, as if the lighthouse itself had been waiting for her all along. <words>418</words>  
Elira smiled, her literal mind finally aligned with the cosmos, ready to unlock the stars and quench a thirst older than war. <words>438</words>
