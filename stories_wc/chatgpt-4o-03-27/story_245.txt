The irate smuggler jogged alone across the cracked flight deck of the abandoned spaceport, his breath sharp in the cold Martian dawn. <words>21</words>  
Each footfall echoed like a curse against the rusted hulls of forgotten ships, their shadows long and accusing. <words>35</words>  
He clutched a single chopstick in his gloved hand—not for eating, but for decoding the patterns in tea leaves he brewed each morning. <words>54</words>  
The chopstick had belonged to his sister, lost years ago in a raid gone wrong, and now it served as both relic and compass. <words>73</words>  
He believed the leaves whispered truths, abstractly physical messages that danced in spirals and dots, guiding him toward the waterfalls she once dreamed of. <words>94</words>  
Waterfalls on Mars were a myth, of course, but myths were all he had left to chase. <words>106</words>  
His heart, once loyal to profit and silence, had revolted after her death, demanding meaning instead of credits. <words>120</words>  
He memorialized her not with stone or song, but through the ritual of tea, brewed in a cracked thermos beside the landing lights. <words>139</words>  
Each morning, he jogged the perimeter, then sat cross-legged, stirring the leaves with the chopstick until patterns emerged. <words>154</words>  
Today, the leaves formed a jagged spiral, like a whirlpool collapsing inward—he took it as a sign to descend into the cargo tunnels. <words>174</words>  
The tunnels beneath the deck were a maze of rust and silence, but he moved with purpose, guided by the revolt in his chest. <words>193</words>  
He remembered her voice, laughing about waterfalls hidden in Martian canyons, her eyes bright with impossible hope. <words>206</words>  
Hope had once been a liability in his trade, but now it was his only currency. <words>217</words>  
He reached a sealed hatch, its keypad long dead, and pried it open with the chopstick, the metal groaning like a wounded beast. <words>235</words>  
Inside, the air was stale, but the walls shimmered faintly with condensation—an impossible thing. <words>247</words>  
He followed the moisture, heart pounding, until he reached a chamber where water trickled down stone, pooling in a shallow basin. <words>264</words>  
A hidden waterfall, small and defiant, alive in the belly of a dead world. <words>273</words>  
He knelt, dipped the chopstick into the water, and felt something shift inside him—grief, yes, but also peace. <words>288</words>  
The heart’s revolt had led him here, not to riches, but to remembrance. <words>297</words>  
He brewed tea beside the fall, letting the steam rise like incense, the leaves swirling into a pattern he didn’t need to read. <words>317</words>  
He already knew what it said: she was here, in the water, in the ritual, in the revolt. <words>331</words>  
The smuggler smiled, bitter and sincere, and for the first time in years, stayed still. <words>343</words>  
Outside, the wind howled across the flight deck, but below, in the chamber of water and memory, silence reigned. <words>359</words>  
He would return tomorrow, and the next day, jogging the same path, honoring the same pattern, until the heart’s revolt became a rhythm. <words>379</words>  
Not of escape, but of arrival. <words>383</words>
