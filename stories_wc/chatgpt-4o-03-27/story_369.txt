The lighthouse stood crooked on the edge of a jagged island, its stones slick with salt and secrets. <words>17</words>  
Inside, Emory, a fanatical puzzle maker with ink-stained fingers and a mind like a labyrinth, waited for the next package. <words>36</words>  
They always arrived the same way—no return address, no sender, just a wax seal shaped like a spiral and a faint scent of lavender. <words>56</words>  
Each package contained a puzzle, and each puzzle, once solved, revealed a secret Emory had never known he was keeping. <words>74</words>  
He lived between two fateful letters: the one that had summoned him here, and the one he had not yet dared to write. <words>94</words>  
The lighthouse, with its rusted gears and whispering walls, was both sanctuary and snare, a place where time wriggled like a trapped eel. <words>113</words>  
Emory believed that solving the puzzles would track his spiritual development, though he could never explain to whom or why. <words>130</words>  
He was optimistically bitter—hopeful that the next secret would free him, resentful that each one only deepened the mystery. <words>147</words>  
Today’s package was smaller than usual, wrapped in oilskin and tied with a single piece of string. <words>161</words>  
He untied it slowly, savoring the tension, the way the string resisted before giving in with a sigh. <words>177</words>  
Inside was a puzzle box carved from driftwood, its surface etched with symbols that seemed to shimmer when he blinked. <words>193</words>  
He turned it over in his hands, feeling the weight—not of the wood, but of the secret it held. <words>209</words>  
The box clicked open after an hour of twisting and tapping, revealing a folded scrap of parchment and a tiny mirror. <words>227</words>  
The parchment read: “You lied to yourself before you lied to them.” <words>235</words>  
Emory stared into the mirror, watching his face wriggle into unfamiliar expressions—guilt, recognition, something like peace. <words>250</words>  
He remembered the first letter, the one that had promised clarity if he came to the lighthouse and stayed until the end. <words>268</words>  
He had thought the puzzles were tests, but now he saw they were confessions—each one a truth he had buried. <words>284</words>  
The lighthouse groaned as the wind picked up, and Emory felt the island shift beneath him, as if acknowledging his realization. <words>301</words>  
He took the piece of string and tied it around his wrist, a reminder that even the smallest thread could bind a soul. <words>319</words>  
The second letter had not yet arrived, but he knew it would come when he was ready to write it himself. <words>336</words>  
Until then, he would wait in lethargic excitement, solving puzzles, unearthing secrets, and watching the sea for signs. <words>351</words>  
The mirror caught the last light of day, casting a spiral on the wall that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>366</words>  
Emory smiled, bitter and hopeful, as he reached for the next box that had just arrived at the door. <words>381</words>  
He didn’t need to open it yet; he already knew it would contain another piece of himself. <words>395</words>  
And so the lighthouse stood, a monument to the weight of secrets and the man who wriggled beneath them. <words>410</words>
