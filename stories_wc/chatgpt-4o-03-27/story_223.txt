Lieutenant Calder Vane, an awkwardly charming naval officer with a stomach that rebelled at the mere scent of salt, stood at the edge of the crystal fortress, staring down the rainbow canyon that shimmered like a wound in the world. <words>33</words>  
He had sailed across centuries, not seas, chasing whispers and traded secrets that echoed through time like gull cries over empty decks. <words>52</words>  
The fortress, carved from quartz and memory, pulsed faintly under moonlight, its spires humming with the quiet longing of those who had waited too long. <words>74</words>  
In his gloved hand, Calder held the translucent ghost orchid bulb, a relic said to bloom only when truth was near and lies had nowhere to hide. <words>99</words>  
He had bartered for it with a dreamwalker in the ruins of a drowned city, offering the name of his first love in exchange. <words>120</words>  
Each night, he tracked the moon phases, waiting for the moment when the bulb would stir, its petals unfolding like secrets too long buried. <words>141</words>  
Tonight, the moon was full and sharp, slicing through the canyon mist, and the bulb trembled in his palm like a heartbeat remembered. <words>162</words>  
Calder stepped into the fortress, its halls echoing with the footfalls of those who had come seeking answers and left with heavier questions. <words>183</words>  
He followed the path of mirrored walls, each reflection a version of himself—braver, crueler, more broken—until he reached the final chamber. <words>204</words>  
There, the Mirror waited, ancient and silver-veined, its surface rippling with the lies it had told and the truths it had devoured. <words>224</words>  
He had come to confront it, to demand the truth it had stolen from his bloodline, to stop it before it lied again. <words>245</words>  
The ghost orchid bloomed in his hand, casting a pale light that made the Mirror flinch, its surface warping like a guilty conscience. <words>266</words>  
Calder’s voice, though trembling, rang with nostalgic defiance as he spoke the name he had traded, anchoring himself in memory. <words>285</words>  
The Mirror hissed, and the fortress shuddered, but Calder stood firm, letting the orchid’s light transform him—not into something new, but into who he had always been. <words>311</words>  
The seasick boy who had once fled the truth now became the man who could bear it, even if it broke him. <words>330</words>  
As dawn crept into the canyon, the Mirror cracked, and Calder turned away, the orchid fading in his hand, its purpose fulfilled. <words>351</words>  
He walked back through the fortress, each step lighter, the traded secrets behind him, the truth finally his to carry. <words>370</words>  
Outside, the rainbow faded, but the sky was clear, and for the first time in centuries, Calder did not feel the world spinning beneath him. <words>393</words>
