The prudent knight adjusted his cloak as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the reimagined ruins of the ancient Minoan palace. <words>23</words>  
He had arrived during the evening commute, when the narrow stone corridors echoed with the hurried footsteps of scholars and archivists returning to their quarters. <words>45</words>  
Though clad in armor dulled by time, his presence stirred no alarm—his mysteriously cheerful demeanor disarmed suspicion, even among the most vigilant guards. <words>66</words>  
He had come not for conquest, but to trace an unknown ancestry whispered to him in dreams and half-remembered lullabies. <words>83</words>  
The palace, now a living museum of reconstructed frescoes and digital archives, held secrets older than any bloodline, guarded by time and silence. <words>104</words>  
In his satchel, he carried a bundle of secondhand letters, their pages yellowed and ink faded, bound loosely by a single binder ring. <words>125</words>  
Each letter bore cryptic patterns—dots, slashes, and looping glyphs—that he had spent years learning to understand. <words>139</words>  
The patterns were not random; they formed a map, not of places, but of people—names erased from history, yet alive in the margins. <words>160</words>  
He followed the clues through the palace’s labyrinthine halls, past reconstructed throne rooms and echoing courtyards where tourists once marveled. <words>179</words>  
Now, only the hum of preservation drones and the occasional flicker of torchlight accompanied his steps. <words>192</words>  
He paused before a sealed chamber, its door etched with the same symbols found in the letters, and pressed his palm to the stone. <words>213</words>  
The wall trembled, then yielded, revealing a narrow passage lit by phosphorescent moss and lined with frescoes of forgotten kings. <words>232</words>  
Inside, he found a pedestal bearing a single scroll, untouched by time, its seal identical to the binder ring he carried. <words>251</words>  
Unrolling it, he read aloud the names of ancestors lost to war, exile, and shame—names that matched the patterns in his letters. <words>270</words>  
Tears welled in his eyes, not from sorrow, but from the quiet joy of understanding where he came from. <words>285</words>  
The guarded secrets of his lineage had not been erased, only hidden, waiting for someone prudent enough to seek them. <words>302</words>  
As he stepped back into the corridor, the palace seemed to breathe with him, its ancient stones no longer foreign but familiar. <words>319</words>  
He walked with purpose now, the loose binder ring clinking softly in his pocket like a bell marking the end of a vigil. <words>338</words>  
Outside, the stars blinked into view, and the last of the commuters vanished into the night, unaware of the legacy reclaimed beneath their feet. <words>359</words>  
The knight smiled, mysteriously cheerful as ever, for he now carried not just armor, but a name, a story, and a place in history. <words>380</words>  
He would return to the world above, not as a relic of chivalry, but as a bridge between forgotten blood and remembered truth. <words>399</words>  
And in the quiet hours that followed, he would write new letters, binding them with care, for the next seeker to understand. <words>417</words>
