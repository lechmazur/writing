After the last wish was granted, the frozen orchard fell into a hush, its trees steaming faintly from the geothermal streams that pulsed beneath the snow. <words>23</words>  
The ghostly caretaker, once a man named Elric, drifted between the frostbitten trunks, his translucent form flickering like candlelight in a blizzard. <words>45</words>  
He wore a solemnly silly expression—eyebrows arched in eternal surprise, lips curled in a wistful grin—as if he’d just remembered the punchline to a forgotten joke. <words>70</words>  
Elric had stayed behind not out of duty, but desire: he longed to communicate with animals, to understand the language of the orchard’s silent deer and whispering crows. <words>99</words>  
He believed the key lay in the forbidden expedition logs buried beneath the orchard’s oldest tree, where the roots curled like sleeping serpents. <words>121</words>  
The logs, written by explorers who vanished decades ago, were said to contain rituals that could perforate the veil between species, between life and afterlife. <words>147</words>  
One morning, as the geothermal mist curled like breath from the earth, Elric found a plastic straw wedged in the bark of a pear tree. <words>172</words>  
It was absurd, out of place, yet it shimmered with a strange energy—as if fate had woven it into the orchard’s story with deliberate mischief. <words>199</words>  
He plucked it free, and the tree groaned, releasing a gust of warm air that carried the scent of cinnamon and old paper. <words>222</words>  
Following the scent, Elric floated downward, through layers of ice and memory, until he reached a hollow chamber where the expedition logs lay sealed in wax. <words>250</words>  
Using the straw, he perforated the wax with gentle pokes, each one releasing a whisper, a syllable, a chirp of forgotten language. <words>273</words>  
The logs unraveled themselves, pages fluttering like wings, revealing diagrams of antlers etched with constellations and phonetic guides to squirrel chatter. <words>296</words>  
Elric read solemnly, giggling now and then at the absurdity of a ghost learning to meow or bray. <words>313</words>  
Outside, the orchard stirred; a fox paused mid-step, ears twitching, as if hearing a lullaby from beneath the snow. <words>335</words>  
Birds circled above, their cries harmonizing with the geothermal hum, weaving through fate like threads in a celestial loom. <words>357</words>  
Elric emerged, straw tucked behind his ear, and whispered to a rabbit, who blinked, then nodded, understanding. <words>377</words>  
The orchard was no longer silent; it buzzed with gentle chaos, a symphony of species finally heard. <words>395</words>  
And Elric, the solemnly silly caretaker, laughed softly, knowing he had finally spoken the language of the living. <words>414</words>
