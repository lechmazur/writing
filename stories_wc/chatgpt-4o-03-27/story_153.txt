When the last star flickered into silence, the eternal student descended into the earth, seeking the mole people’s city buried beneath the crust. <words>23</words>  
He had studied immortality for centuries, not to escape death, but to master the architecture of his own reality. <words>39</words>  
The mole people, blind and wise, traded in memories and truths, their culture preserved via swapped travel journals etched into stone tablets. <words>58</words>  
He offered them his own journal—volumes of failed experiments, lost loves, and the mundanely glorious moments of infinite semesters. <words>74</words>  
In return, they gave him a coal miner’s headlamp, salvaged from a collapsed mine that once breached their sanctuary. <words>89</words>  
The headlamp, they said, held the burden of a gift: it illuminated not darkness, but the weight of choices unmade. <words>106</words>  
He wore it as he wandered their labyrinthine city, its tunnels carved with reverence and resignation, lit by bioluminescent moss. <words>122</words>  
The mole people lived without sun or sky, yet their lives pulsed with a rhythm more honest than surface time. <words>138</words>  
He digitized their journals, encoding their wisdom into neural threads that he wove into his own consciousness. <words>151</words>  
Each thread was a burden—memories of lives he never lived, regrets he never earned, joys he could never claim. <words>167</words>  
Still, he bore them with detached devotion, knowing mastery required surrender to the weight of others’ truths. <words>180</words>  
The headlamp flickered when he neared the city’s heart, where the oldest mole, blind since birth, waited in silence. <words>196</words>  
She touched his face and whispered, “You seek to master reality, but reality is not yours alone to command.” <words>213</words>  
He nodded, understanding that immortality was not freedom from death, but the obligation to carry what others could not. <words>230</words>  
In the chamber of echoes, he uploaded the digitized journals into the city’s memory core, a crystalline root system. <words>245</words>  
The mole people gathered, humming a resonance that vibrated through stone and soul, accepting his offering. <words>258</words>  
The headlamp dimmed, its burden transferred, its gift fulfilled. <words>264</words>  
He left the underground city, not lighter, but more complete, his reality now a mosaic of shared burdens. <words>278</words>  
Above, the universe was dark, but within him, the mole people’s stories glowed with quiet defiance. <words>291</words>  
He resumed his studies, not to escape, but to understand the mundanely glorious truth: that mastery begins with empathy. <words>307</words>  
Each journal he wrote now bore not just his thoughts, but echoes of the mole people’s wisdom, digitized and eternal. <words>323</words>  
He mailed them to no one, left them in forgotten places, hoping someone would find them and carry the burden forward. <words>341</words>  
For in a universe without stars, only shared stories could light the way. <words>350</words>  
And so he walked, headlamp extinguished, but soul ablaze with the weight of gifted burdens. <words>362</words>  
He was no longer just a student of immortality—he was its archivist, its witness, its humble architect. <words>376</words>
