The abandoned space station control room smelled like rusted circuits and forgotten dreams. <words>1</words>  
Jax, an underachieving mage with a knack for being exceptionally usual, kicked a loose panel and sighed. <words>2</words>  
He had come here not for glory, but because a misdelivered package had arrived at his crumbling farmhouse, addressed to someone long dead. <words>3</words>  
Inside the battered box was a doll head with blinking eyes, its gaze eerily synchronized with his own heartbeat. <words>4</words>  
The package also contained a note: “Unveil the truth where the stars once spoke.” <words>5</words>  
Jax, who had failed every magical aptitude test since age seven, felt a flicker of bored excitement. <words>6</words>  
He had always suspected his family’s legacy was more than just failed crops and dusty spellbooks. <words>7</words>  
The space station, perched at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, had once been a hub for arcane-astral research. <words>8</words>  
Now, it was a mausoleum of blinking lights and silent consoles, perfect for someone trying to spring a trap on their own limitations. <words>9</words>  
Jax placed the doll head on the central console, its eyes blinking faster as if recognizing home. <words>10</words>  
He whispered the activation phrase from the note, and the control room hummed to life. <words>11</words>  
Holograms flickered into view—his ancestors, mages of renown, standing in a circle around him. <words>12</words>  
“You were never meant to be ordinary,” one said, her voice like wind through wheat. <words>13</words>  
Jax scoffed, “Tell that to my report cards.” <words>14</words>  
The doll head’s eyes turned red, and a hidden panel slid open, revealing a wand etched with constellations. <words>15</words>  
He reached for it, and the moment his fingers touched the wood, memories not his own flooded in. <words>16</words>  
Battles fought in orbit, spells cast in zero gravity, and a promise made to protect the heritage of stellar mages. <words>17</words>  
Jax staggered back, overwhelmed but exhilarated. <words>18</words>  
He understood now—his mediocrity had been a shield, a way to hide from a destiny too vast to grasp. <words>19</words>  
But the misdelivered package had found him anyway, as if fate had grown impatient. <words>20</words>  
He turned to the console and began to type, each keystroke unveiling more of his family’s legacy. <words>21</words>  
The station’s systems responded, revealing maps, spells, and a list of descendants—all marked “AWAITING AWAKENING.” <words>22</words>  
Jax grinned, the first real smile in years, and whispered, “Let’s see how usual I really am.” <words>23</words>  
Outside, the farmland shimmered under the stars, unaware that its fate had just changed. <words>24</words>  
And in the control room, the doll head blinked once more—slow, deliberate, approving. <words>25</words>
