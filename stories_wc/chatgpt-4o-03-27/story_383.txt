The Dark Matter Diner flickered into existence between rides, nestled in a fold of spacetime where lost thoughts and half-finished dreams gathered like dust. <words>23</words>  
General Hal Vexler slumped in a cracked vinyl booth, his medals dulled, his eyes scanning a menu that hadn’t changed since the last war ended. <words>45</words>  
He ordered dried seaweed and black coffee, the only things that didn’t remind him of command tents and casualty reports. <words>59</words>  
The waitress, a hologram with a Brooklyn accent and a glitch in her left eye, slid into the booth across from him. <words>75</words>  
“You look like a man who’s fought too many battles and won too few,” she said, her voice a blend of static and sympathy. <words>93</words>  
Hal chuckled, a dry sound like boots on gravel. <words>99</words>  
“I’m trying to dethrone fear from the throne of reason,” he said, stirring his coffee with a spoon bent by gravity anomalies. <words>115</words>  
The waitress nodded, pulling a stack of black-and-white photographs from her apron, each one arcing with faint pulses of memory. <words>130</words>  
“These are from others who sat where you sit,” she said, spreading them like tarot cards. <words>141</words>  
Each photo shimmered with shared anxieties—soldiers hugging shadows, lovers kissing under mushroom clouds, children building bunkers from Lego. <words>157</words>  
Hal touched one: a young man saluting a mirror, his uniform stitched from newspaper headlines. <words>168</words>  
“That one’s mine,” he whispered, the absurdity rational in this place where logic bent like light near a black hole. <words>182</words>  
The waitress smiled, her glitch flickering like a wink. <words>189</words>  
“Then you know what to do.” <words>194</words>  
Hal took the photo and held it over his coffee; steam curled around it, revealing new arcs—paths not taken, regrets unspoken. <words>210</words>  
He saw himself refusing the final order, choosing mercy over protocol, and the world didn’t end—it just changed. <words>223</words>  
The dried seaweed crackled between his teeth, tasting of oceans he’d never seen. <words>233</words>  
He felt something shift inside, a tectonic plate of guilt sliding off the continent of his soul. <words>246</words>  
“I want to renew,” he said, voice steady, “not escape.” <words>254</words>  
The waitress nodded again, this time with both eyes clear. <words>262</words>  
“Then leave the photo,” she said, “and take the ride.” <words>271</words>  
Hal stood, leaving the image behind like a shed skin. <words>280</words>  
Outside, the next ride shimmered into view—a train made of starlight and second chances. <words>292</words>  
He boarded without looking back, the diner already fading into myth. <words>302</words>  
Somewhere, fear screamed as it was dragged from its throne, replaced by something quieter, wiser, and mischievously brave. <words>316</words>  
The waitress wiped the table, humming a tune only the broken could hear. <words>327</words>  
Another general would come, another photo would arc, and the diner would serve its strange salvation again. <words>341</words>  
Between rides, in the folds of the universe, healing was always on the menu. <words>352</words>  
And sometimes, all it took was dried seaweed, a photograph, and the courage to laugh at the rationally absurd. <words>368</words>  
Hal’s laughter echoed faintly as the train vanished, a sound like thunder learning to forgive. <words>380</words>
