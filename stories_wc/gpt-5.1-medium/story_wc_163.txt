<story>The ocean above the dome was black glass when I arrived at the forgotten underwater city research facility. [18]
Floodlights combed the drowned avenues beyond, catching glints of skeletal railings and algae-furred statues frozen in parade. [35]
I had charted mountain shadows and river constellations on the surface, but never a city that slept underwater. [53]
They called me a landscape astrologer, as if the folds of earth were a sky only I could read. [72]
Here, though, my charts curled damply in my bag, useless as old horoscopes in a place without weather. [90]
This time I had come without clients or patrons, only a quiet ache to learn the rhythm of belonging. [109]
The facility custodian met me at the airlock, her hair buoyant around her head like a dark halo. [127]
Her name was Mira, and she moved with a softly ingenious economy, every gesture shaped by years underwater. [145]
She offered no handshake, only a mirrored nod, as if we were already reflections of one another. [162]
You are the sky-reader, she said, voice blurred slightly by the rebreather collar at her throat. [178]
Down here we have ceilings, not heavens, but the supervisors think you can tell them why the lights keep failing. [198]
I followed her through corridors that pulsed with pumps and distant, groaning shifts of pressure. [213]
Outside the thick glass, the drowned city shimmered in our floodlit wake, its towers like reefs made from forgotten errands. [233]
I was meant to diagnose electrical faults, interpret fluctuations as if they were constellations, but the facility hummed with another question. [254]
Who among the living could claim this place as home, and who were only passing through its pressure-thick rooms? [273]
In my pocket, I carried a burnt feather wrapped in waxed cloth, the last relic of my surface life. [292]
Once it had been part of a kestrel I rescued, then failed to keep from the wildfire that took my village. [313]
I told myself the feather was a pen, a pointer, something to chart with, but mostly it smelled of leaving. [333]
Mira led me to the observation theater where the main dome arched above a plaza swallowed in dim green. [352]
Banks of lights along the dome flickered like tired stars, failing one by one in erratic, anxious rhythm. [370]
Our technicians replace them, Mira said, but the darkness always returns, and with it, strange behavior in the volunteers. [389]
I watched a cluster of researchers below moving between kiosks, their pale suits licking back the gloom in brief, luminous respite. [410]
The phrase rose in my mind like a tide, making me think of nights on scorched hills after the fire. [430]
There, a single intact house lantern could captivate an entire wandering crowd, a tiny harbor for eyes that had lost everything. [451]
If light was a harbor, then this city had a coastline that kept rearranging itself, tides of malfunction and repair. [471]
I asked Mira to dim the working lights along one quadrant and leave the other dark, against protocol. [489]
She hesitated, then smiled with a crooked curiosity that felt like a door unsticking, and keyed in the override. [508]
I watched how the volunteers shifted, drifting unconsciously toward the half-lit zone, orbiting kiosks that glowed like wayward moons. [527]
Even fish outside the dome veered closer, their bodies making quick silver cursive against the glass before vanishing. [545]
It is not failure, I murmured, mostly to myself; it is the architecture of attention trying to find balance. [564]
Mira leaned on the rail beside me, our shoulders almost touching, and the glass above us slowly darkened. [582]
We fell quiet in a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer, though they were not fireflies at all. [602]
Tiny bioluminescent shrimp rose from the city streets outside, winking on and off in currents like shifting constellations. [620]
The dome lights, surrendered for the moment, let that wild script write itself over our faces. [636]
I felt something loosen in my chest, a knot of smoke that had lived there since the village burned. [655]
Belonging was not the fixed point on a chart, I realized, but the interval between breaths shared in noticing. [674]
Shadow pooled in the corners, light clung to our skin, and the whole dome became a chamber of shadowseam wonder. [694]
Until sunrise, I worked with Mira to redesign the lighting cycles, not as repairs, but as tides of invitation. [713]
We mapped where people gathered, where they shied away, where memories seemed to bloom in their faces when the shrimp ascended. [734]
I used the burnt feather to trace patterns on the condensation-fogged glass, lines that Mira translated into switch sequences and dimmers. [755]
By the time the first gray of morning filtered through leagues of water, the city outside glowed in gentle pulses. [775]
Not a fixed beacon, not a desperate flare, but a breathing rhythm, teaching me how to belong by listening. [794]</story>
