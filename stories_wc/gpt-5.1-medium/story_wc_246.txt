<story>By the time the sky began folding inward, I had already spent three decades listening for messages between stars. [19]
They called me a celestial signal interpreter, but I always felt more like a translator of half-forgotten questions. [37]
My observatory hung at the edge of a gentle gravitational anomaly, where falling and floating negotiated an uneasy truce. [56]
You learned to move slowly here, not from fear of slipping, but from fear of drifting away unfinished. [74]
It was, I suppose, an appropriate exile after planting the wrong seeds back on the verdant, impatient Earth. [92]
I had once believed that decoding alien pulses would redeem my earlier mistakes, that patterns could absolve misdirected intentions. [111]
Instead, the universe mailed me silence and a single package: a dried-up fountain pen with an exotic nib. [129]
No return address, only a note taped to the barrel: For editing history, not documents. [144]
I laughed, because history in this place seemed immune to ink, let alone to a pen that no longer flowed. [164]
Still, I kept it in my breast pocket, the way you keep a forgotten key whose door you cannot remember. [184]
I was confidently uncertain about its purpose, a posture that had become my closest thing to faith. [201]
Uncertainty preserved options; confidence let me continue breathing inside them. [211]
Most of my work involved mapping faint transmissions onto planetary alignments, teasing meaning through contingent relationships rather than direct translations. [231]
Signals from one pulsar only made sense against the echo of another; everything depended on everything else. [248]
In that tangled web, my motivation was simple enough: to thresh meaning from experience, to separate grain from cosmic chaff. [268]
The more I listened, the more the anomaly hummed like a patient throat clearing before speech. [284]
One dawnless cycle, the floor buckled very slightly, and every loose object in the observatory leaned toward the central void. [304]
Holographic charts shivered, my chair slid half a centimeter, and the pen in my pocket turned hot against my ribs. [324]
When I pulled it out, the dry reservoir glowed with a sullen, trapped light, as if ink remembered wanting to move. [345]
Without quite deciding to, I touched the nib to the observation deck, where microscopic dust held the prints of countless footsteps. [366]
Lines of light scratched themselves across the metal, not in any alphabet I recognized, but in the trajectories of moments. [386]
Here was the night I refused my brother's apology; there the afternoon I falsified data to please an impatient benefactor. [406]
Each appeared as a skewed curve in the dust, bending away from softer possibilities I had chosen not to inhabit. [426]
On impulse, I pressed the nib against one sharp angle, willing it to unbend, to relax back toward what-might-have-been. [445]
The anomaly deepened, the horizon tilted, and my memory shuddered as that argument with my brother replayed, then quietly rewrote itself. [466]
I still remembered shouting, but this time I also remembered listening, hearing the shake in his voice, and choosing differently. [486]
The curve on the deck softened; the dust re-settled along a gentler path, like a river freed from an old stone. [507]
Outside the viewport, a star winked into a slightly altered position, no farther away, just fractionally less estranged. [525]
The pen, I realized with a creeping, strange comfort, was for editing history, but only along the grain of possibility. [545]
It could not conjure new seeds; it could only coax already planted ones to sprout along kinder geometries. [563]
After planting the wrong seeds, I had believed redemption demanded erasure, but the pen refused to delete; it revised. [582]
Night after artificial night, I walked the deck, tracing other jagged curves of my life, nudging them a hair's breadth wider. [603]
I could not bring back the child whose medication I miscalculated, but I could unbend the despair that followed, redirecting colleagues toward safer protocols. [627]
Every change rippled outward through contingent relationships, altering which grants were funded, which telescopes built, which faint extraterrestrial whispers reached my station at all. [651]
The cosmos did not reset; it exhaled, as if relieved that causality could flex without breaking. [667]
Soon the anomaly's pull felt less like a threat and more like a cradle, rocking ever so slightly with each revision. [688]
I became, in truth, a celestial signal interpreter at last, listening not only outward but inward, where my own timelines whispered. [709]
They told me that meaning was never stored in isolated events, but in the ways they leaned toward one another. [729]
I would die here, I knew, still confidently uncertain, still threshing meaning from experience with a pen that barely wrote. [749]
Yet the thought no longer terrified me; it simply joined the others, another curve I might someday, gently, unbend. [768]</story>
