After the procedure, the city looked almost clean enough to believe in. [12]
The pigeons still limped through oil slicks, and the towers still wore their soot like old war medals, but my head felt scraped and polished, a bare plate where history used to sit. [45]
They said the cleanse erased only what I did, not what I am, as if that difference were delicately robust instead of a fragile lie scribbled on a consent form. [75]
I wanted a clean slate, yes, but mostly because I knew exactly how dirty the past could get when you shove other people into it. [100]
Before they flushed my memories, I left myself a map in the only place the censors never bothered to check. [120]
Not a drawing, not a file, nothing so obvious; it was a trail of classified ads and obituaries, coded by reading between newspaper lines the way my grandfather once read weather in the cracks of dry riverbeds. [157]
Every Tuesday edition carried a phrase that meant nothing to anyone whose guilt had been laundered. [173]
To the old me, and now to the new me who trusted the old me more than the doctors, it spelled out directions to somewhere beneath the city, somewhere wet and shining and wrong. [207]
So, after the procedure, when the stabilizers stopped humming behind my eyes, I stepped out into the evening and began the journey the dead version of me had prepared. [236]
The first checkpoint was at the abandoned stadium, its field drowned in dust, its floodlights long since repurposed to glare down at protest lines. [260]
Seat 42B, my instructions had said, and there, wedged under hardened popcorn like a fossil in amber, I found the baseball signed by a time traveler. [286]
The signature was my own handwriting, older, shakier, dated ten years from now, followed by three words that tightened my throat: DO NOT HESITATE. [310]
I turned the ball over and saw tiny etched arrows spiraling along the seams, pointing toward a service tunnel whose door was welded shut. [334]
An oxy torch lay where the arrows ended, a little gift from me to me, and soon the seal gave way with a cough of rust. [360]
The tunnel sloped down, past murals half scrubbed from the walls, past layers of city like tree rings, until the air grew colder and tasted of minerals and old electricity. [390]
Down there, my steps echoed like someone else was following, and I wondered which version of me would reach the end first. [412]
Eventually the stone opened into a cavern so wide my headlamp could not find the far wall, and the floor dropped away into an underground bioluminescent lake. [439]
The water glowed with a bruised turquoise light, pulsing gently, as if the whole lake were breathing through its wounds. [459]
Strands of algae hung from the ceiling like chandeliers, dripping slow sparks that dissolved before they hit the surface. [478]
The air hummed with a low vibration that settled into my bones, a sound like distant applause at a game nobody wanted to win. [502]
This, then, was what I had been protecting from my own forgetfulness. [514]
Not treasure, not escape, but a place where the city kept the feelings it no longer had room for upstairs. [534]
The cleanse clinics prided themselves on civic peace, on erasing the memories that sparked vendettas and riots, but peace had a cost, and the receipt was written on the faces that no longer knew how to flinch. [571]
They had scrubbed away guilt, yes, but they had also scoured off empathy, leaving everyone smooth and bright and harmless as glass marbles. [594]
In the reflection of the lake, my own face looked like that, a stranger practicing expressions it could no longer fully feel. [616]
The baseball in my hands, though, felt real enough, the stitching rough against my fingertips, the future date on the leather like a pulse. [640]
I realized why I had come, why the old me had risked the cleanse instead of simply running. [658]
If the city could not remember its own cruelty, then someone had to, just long enough to kindle empathy where none remains. [680]
This lake was the reservoir, the labyrinth of choices everyone had made and then thrown away, glowing softly in the dark like the guts of a conscience. [707]
Each ripple carried an echo, a scene, a tiny pain, all of it suspended here after being vacuumed from skulls that paid extra for the deluxe forgetfulness package. [735]
I waded in up to my knees, the cold biting through my boots, and the water reacted, brightening in nervous flares, as if it recognized my sins pressing down through my skin. [767]
Images rushed me then, not as memories but as possibilities, branches of the life I had hacked through, now reaching back like accusing arms. [791]
