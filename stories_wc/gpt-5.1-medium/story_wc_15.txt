<story>After the tide pools empty, the wharf goes quiet enough for Orren to hear his own thoughts. [17]
He is the poetic wharf weaver, fingers calloused by rope and salt, mind stitched with lines of verse no one has asked to hear. [41]
Tonight, the moon drags a pearl path across the bay, and its light spills down through the cliffs into the centuries-old labyrinth carved into the red canyon walls behind the docks. [72]
Orren waits for this hour, after the tide pools empty and the fishermen go home, because the labyrinth belongs to him then, and to the ghosts of broken precedents that whisper in its corridors. [106]
He steps away from the wharf, coils of half-mended net still looped over his shoulder, and descends the narrow rock stair where barnacles shine like dull coins. [133]
Orren moves with a hauntingly optimistic slowness, as if each footfall might yet be trusted to find grace instead of another collapse. [155]
He is not content to mend nets and listen to storms ruin what little the town still reveres; he is walking to carve a path from ruin to reverence, one secret tunnel at a time. [190]
The labyrinth breathes a muted, orchid solace around him, sandstone walls washed in violet moon-sheen, the air smelling of iron and old tide. [213]
Orren has walked these passages so often that, when sleep takes him in his cot, his body rises and returns here, tracing routes via overlapping sleepwalking paths he rarely remembers by morning. [245]
Over years, his waking feet and his dreaming feet have braided separate maps, crossing and recrossing until the floor itself seems sewn with his wandering. [270]
Tonight he carries, wrapped in sailcloth, the town's last storybook illustration plate, a copper rectangle etched generations ago with scenes from the founding myths. [294]
Once, the plate stamped bright images onto cheap paper for every child, boats leaping waves toward a radiant harbor, saints striding across wind, but the press house burned, and only this warped survivor remained under Orren's bed. [331]
He cannot read the old stories, yet he knows the curves of their outlines by fingertip, and he has watched the town forget them as nets fray and boats sink unchecked. [362]
If the page is gone, he thinks, perhaps the walls can carry the tale. [376]
He reaches the first chamber, where the canyon narrows and the ceiling stoops low, and unrolls his bundle on the cold stone. [398]
From his belt he pulls a curved awl and a coil of waxed twine, tools meant to sew torn canvas, not to converse with rock. [423]
Yet this is how he knows to pray: by sewing edges back together until they can hold weight again. [442]
He holds the plate against the wall, aligning its bent corners with faint scratches his sleepwalking self carved here months ago, and begins to score along its lines, tracing boats, faces, sunbursts into the sandstone skin. [478]
Dust falls like flour onto his boots, and the canyon seems to listen, each tap of metal a syllable in a language older than ink. [503]
As he works, images from the plate mingle with memories not his own, glimpses that arrive via those overlapping sleepwalking paths: a woman lowering the first ladder into an untouched cove, a boy laughing as he names every current. [542]
Perhaps the labyrinth itself has been walking through him all these nights, he thinks, using his body to remember its first footsteps. [564]
He moves to the next chamber, where the walls twist tighter, and begins again, sewing story to stone, scene to turning. [585]
Here he engraves the storm that wrecked the old harbor, but he alters the plate's design, lifting the boats higher, angling their bows toward a gap in the rocks that never existed yet aches to be real. [622]
Broken precedents chip away with each stroke; the story no longer binds itself to what happened, but to what might still be salvaged. [645]
Orren pauses, hand aching, and imagines children tracing these carved lines long after paper has mildewed and nets have rotted, their fingertips learning that history can be unfastened and resewn. [675]
He thinks of the fishermen who sell their nets for drink, of the council that shrugs when another boat fails to return, and he feels anger rise, sharp and clean, then settle into a steadier resolve. [711]
If no one else will lay new law upon the tides, he will at least lay new story, trusting that reverence follows the lines of what people can imagine. [740]
When dawn begins to thin the darkness and the sea sighs back into the coves, he stands in the final chamber, palm pressed to a fresh carving of a harbor both ruined and renewed, its entryway widened, its piers woven like nets reaching for the horizon. [786]</story>
