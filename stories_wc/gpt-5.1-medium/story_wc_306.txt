<story>By the time the campfire's last spark dies, my real work begins. [12]
I walk the narrow path up to the old lighthouse, the sky paling toward dawn. [27]
Wind comes in off the sea, restless and salt heavy, nudging my coat open. [41]
Tonight I feel made of thin glass and guarded secrets, all edges and protected vulnerability. [56]
Clients like that, or so they tell me when they hire a conscience for hire. [71]
They do not want comfort; they want someone to argue with the story they tell themselves. [87]
That is my specialty. [91]
I keep certainty on the hook just long enough to slip a question underneath it. [106]
At the lighthouse door, the metal ring is cold against my fingers as I unhook the chain. [123]
The keeper is already awake, because some people never truly sleep once regret moves in. [138]
Mara opens the door only a crack, her eyes narrow, her mouth sincerely insincere. [152]
You look exactly like I imagined, she says, which is to say not at all trustworthy. [168]
That is usually how this begins. [174]
I step inside and the wind follows, filling the round room with tinkling chimes and distant surf. [191]
Mara's tower is full of wind chimes, hundreds of metal tongues poised for guidance. [205]
She gestures upward, wary but hopeful. [211]
You do it by listening to those, she says, not by reading my face, yes. [226]
That is the rumor, I reply, moving to the center of the room where the drafts cross. [243]
In truth, the chimes are only a language; I am the one who listens for verbs. [259]
From my pocket I take the hollow mirror shard, its silvered skin missing from the center. [275]
It frames a moving oval of air, as if reality were something you could scoop. [290]
Mara flinches when she sees it, then pretends she has not, wrapping herself in briskness. [305]
The shard only reflects what you already know, I tell her, but it hollows the glare. [321]
You called me because your certainty is bright enough to blind you. [333]
She laughs once, sharp as cracked glass. [340]
I keep this place, she says, but I do not keep my promises. [353]
The fishermen think the light is for them; my wife thought it was for us. [368]
She left after the last storm when I chose the ships over her voice on the radio. [385]
Now I want you to tell me I was right or I was wrong and make it stick. [403]
My rates do not include absolution, I say, setting the hollow shard on the table. [418]
Wind stirs, chimes ring, and I feel the familiar weight of the cloak of doubt settling over us. [436]
It is not fabric, not exactly; it is the hush that descends when easy answers walk out. [453]
Mara hugs her arms, as though more layers could keep the questions from touching skin. [468]
I lift the mirror shard so that it holds the pink edge of dawn and the dark of her pupils. [488]
Tell me what you feared when you chose, I say. [498]
Not what you believed, not what you rehearsed afterward, just the fear itself. [511]
She watches the empty center of the glass like it might show her a safer memory. [527]
I was afraid that if I saved her boat, someone else would drown, she whispers. [542]
Afraid that loving her more than strangers made me a smaller person than I claimed. [557]
The chimes answer, a cluster of high notes to the east, low to the south, nothing from the north. [576]
I close my eyes and translate their scattered ringing, deciphering wind chime selections like lines of hesitant script. [594]
They say there was no clean heroism on offer, only different debts, different griefs. [608]
You did not choose between good and evil, I tell her; you chose between kinds of unfinished sorrow. [626]
I want you to say I was wrong, she insists, but her shoulders loosen as if muscles remember mercy. [645]
Or right, I add, and we both hear how sincerely insincere that sounds, a coin spinning on its edge. [664]
My work is not to flip it, only to keep it spinning long enough for her to see both faces. [684]
The wind shifts again, the chimes fall mute, and the cloak of doubt thins into ordinary morning chill. [702]
Through the narrow window, the horizon grows cleaner, but not simpler. [713]
The ships are still out there, the broken marriage still away somewhere, the choice unerasable. [728]
Yet something softer has entered the room, as if nuance itself had finally found a welcome perch. [745]
When I leave, Mara insists on walking me to the door, her steps careful on the spiral stairs. [763]
Outside, the breeze takes my coat again, but this time I do not pull it closed. [779]
I let the morning in, sharp and unsure, and carry it with me down the hill. [795]</story>
