<story>The first time I saw the herbalist's underground garden, I thought I had fallen through a bruise in reality. [19]
Purple lamps hummed like patient hornets, coaxing bioluminescent moss to rise in gravitationally playful spirals along the roots of inverted trees. [40]
Drifts of chamomile fog clung to the ceiling while the soil under my boots pulsed with the slow heartbeat of something not entirely plant. [64]
I reminded myself that I was not here as a tourist; I was a cryptid researcher working undercover, and this was supposed to be reconnaissance, not wonder. [91]
The herbalist, Mara, walked ahead of me, her bare feet soundless on the damp stone, her gray braid swinging like a pendulum that had made peace with time. [119]
She had agreed to let me see the garden only after the missing return changed, after the people who went up the mountain stopped coming back wrong and simply stopped coming back at all. [153]
You carry the mountain on your face, Mara said, not turning around. [165]
Her voice had the rasp of frostbitten hope, brittle and persistent, like someone who had quit believing in miracles but still salted the doorstep against the unknown. [192]
I told her I was a journalist writing about sustainable agriculture, which technically was not a lie, only a camouflage for the stranger thing I hunted. [218]
My other name, the one only the institute used, sounded like a joke: field liaison for anomalous fauna. [236]
But there is nothing funny about tracking a phenomenon that leaves behind no bodies, no footprints, only a feeling people described as a harmony untamed ringing through their bones. [265]
Mara stopped beside a low archway woven from living roots and touched the stone inset at its center, a dull triangle of flint that looked older than the mountain itself. [295]
It was an arrowhead, edges blunted by centuries of river talk and thumb grease, tied to the roots with faded red thread. [317]
Every door has a tooth, she said; this one remembers before the mountain was a boundary. [333]
I felt the urge to catalog the object, to note its material, estimated age, cultural context, the way any good researcher would, but the arrowhead vibrated softly under her fingers, as if shrugging off the nets of classification. [371]
We went through, and the air changed from earthy damp to something sharp and metallic, like breathing the inside of a storm cloud. [394]
At the garden's heart stood a circle of bowls made from polished bone, each filled with dark loam and a single plant that did not match any taxonomy I knew. [424]
Their leaves shimmered as if unable to decide which color they wanted to be, sliding from blue to green to the bruised yellow of old paper. [450]
Mara crouched beside the nearest bowl and picked up an object resting in the soil, an old cordless phone with a cracked plastic shell and an unblinking red light. [479]
You want to understand what is taking them, she said; then you need to hear what the mountain hears. [498]
She pressed the phone into my hands, and the second my skin met the slick, yellowed plastic, static burst in my ears, loud as breaking ice. [524]
Voices rose and sank in the hiss, overlapping confessions, recorded not through wires or satellites but via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone left on some forgotten ledge of the mountain. [557]
I heard a man laughing as he described letting go of his grief like a handful of gravel, heard a child apologizing to the wind for naming every shadow a monster, heard Mara's own younger voice saying, clearly, I refuse to come back the same. [602]
The static settled into a rhythm, a low, coursing hum that matched the tremor in the soil, and I realized the confessions were not mere recordings but seeds. [630]
Mara moved from bowl to bowl, whispering names I recognized from the institute's missing-person files, and with each name a plant shivered, then steadied, as though choosing whether to keep growing. [661]
They turn into this, I said, unable to stop the professional horror from sharpening my voice. [677]
No, she replied, still crouched, fingers sunk in the soil; they metamorphose into what the mountain cannot carry alone. [696]
I looked again at the plants and saw, in the tilt of a leaf or the knot of a stem, echoes of the voices I had heard: a crooked laughter line here, a child's hesitant curl there. [733]
They had not been erased, only redistributed, every lost person composted into a larger, stranger chorus, a harmony untamed that made the bones of the mountain less lonely. [761]
The institute had sent me here to map a threat, to diagram its behavior and extract a strategy, but the garden kept refusing to fit on my grid. [789]
Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke. [800]</story>
