<story>The first thing I heard after the anesthesia wore off was the ivy whispering against the stone of the tower. [20]
Dawn had barely started leaking into the quiet tower, a pale hush, like the pause before a meteor appears. [39]
You are awake, the ivy said inside my skull, its voice damp and green, smelling of rain trapped in cloth. [59]
I kept my eyes closed, because opening them would mean admitting the surgery had not removed what it was meant to. [80]
The doctors promised the new graft would quiet the hallucinations, would separate my grief from the phantom voices in the walls. [101]
Instead, I had become accidentally telepathic with plants. [109]
We did not consent to silence, the ivy added, sounding offended, every small leaf a mouthful of rustling consonants. [128]
My name is Mara, and I came to this tower because I am a closure seeker who opens wounds instead. [148]
I tell people I study trauma, that I want to learn to read the stories in scars, to map healing. [168]
But you cannot close what you do not first reopen, my mentor used to say, before she tunneled away into her own damage and never wrote again. [195]
They called what she did a breakdown; I called it a displaced miracle, a salvation that showed up in the wrong room. [217]
So when the hospital offered a trial surgery, a neural mesh to filter perception, I signed before they finished explaining the side effects. [240]
Now, in this quiet tower at dawn, wrapped in a stiff white blanket that smells of starch and antiseptic, I can hear every fern breathing. [265]
Beside the bed, on a small metal tray, someone has left a cup of coffee and a frosted hourglass the size of my fist. [289]
The hourglass glows faintly from within, its sand frozen mid-fall, every grain lit like a dust mote crossing a projector beam. [310]
Someone has scrawled on the bedside chart: Observe temporal anomalies by examining coffee rings. [324]
The cup sweats a brown halo onto the metal, and I stare at the ring as if it were a fresh incision. [346]
Show me, I think, not sure whether I am speaking to the coffee, the hourglass, or the ivy braided along the window. [368]
The ivy answers first, because plants are impatient gossipers. [377]
You want closure, it rustles, but you are built like a key, not a lock. [392]
I laugh, which hurts, and my fingers drift to the bandage zigzagging my shaved scalp, the newest scar in my collection. [413]
Each mark on my body is a chapter I have not finished reading, a sentence cutoff I keep trying to reopen. [434]
That is why I followed my mentor into the dark, why I learned to tunnel through other peoples pain with questions that sliced. [457]
Tell me about the night it happened, I would say, and they would, and afterward their faces looked both lighter and more hollow. [480]
Closure, I told myself, as if naming it that kept me blameless. [492]
Now the ivy and the fern and the potted rosemary by the door all breathe words into my skull, and none of them are gentle. [517]
The rosemary remembers every hand that tore at its stems, every kitchen knife, every Sunday roast; to it, a scar is simply where sunlight got in. [543]
You want to read scars, it whispers, then stop asking people to bleed for you and ask the tissue itself. [563]
The coffee ring has spread, a misshapen circle like a crater seen from orbit, and in its uneven edge I glimpse something moving. [586]
A childs wrist, purpled and stitched; a mans chest with a starburst burn; my own scalp, already scarred in a future I have not reached. [611]
The images ripple around the ring, each scar a small orbiting world, and I see their stories unfolding like time-lapse wounds. [632]
This is your miracle, the hourglass hums without sound, sand brightening, but it has been displaced, knocked sideways out of the body and into the residue. [658]
You will not close wounds anymore; you will read them the way astronomers read craters for histories of impact and fire. [679]
But if I only read, I say aloud, who tends the living hurt. [692]
The fern shakes spores into the air like a slow exhale. [703]
Outside, the sky brightens in a meteor hush, and I understand that some closures bloom only when you stop trying to seal them. [726]</story>
