<story>The first time I woke somewhere new, I blamed bad sleep and the cheap mattress in my rented room. [19]
By the twelfth awakening in a different place, excuses seemed thinner than the dawn light. [34]
That morning I opened my eyes to a canopy of glinting brass leaves, dripping oil like dark rain. [52]
Gears turned in the trunks of towering ironwood trees, their roots humming softly beneath the soil of copper filings. [71]
I had heard of the mechanical rainforest in footnote rumors and barstool theories, but never believed it could exist. [90]
Yet there it stood around me, ticking, sighing, and breathing steam into the sky like a living engine. [108]
Every night I fell asleep in my cramped city apartment, and every morning lately I woke somewhere else entirely. [127]
The doctors called it dissociative episodes until the day they watched me vanish from the sleep lab in a blink of static. [149]
After that, they called it someone elses problem. [157]
I called it the price of asking one question too many about reality. [170]
I had always been a stray philosopher, the kind who drifts between jobs, ideas, and couches, more rumor than resident. [190]
My only steady belongings were a notebook full of half finished theories and a small gear I kept in my pocket. [211]
The gear was unremarkable at first glance, no larger than my thumbnail, worn smooth at the teeth. [228]
I found it six months ago on my pillow after dreaming of a machine that measured thoughts instead of time. [248]
Since then, everything had been coming loose, like the world was a sweater beginning to unravel from one stolen stitch. [268]
People used to say that five senses tied us to the world; lately, I felt that tether slackening. [286]
Then, one night, listening to the traffic outside my window, I heard a sixth thing beneath the noise. [304]
It was not a sound, not exactly; more a pressure behind the ears, the hum of insight turning slowly. [323]
When that sixth sense awakened, corners of reality began to peel back like wallpaper soaked in rain. [340]
I started to hear questions inside objects, unanswered and patient, as if the universe had been waiting for me to notice. [361]
Now, standing in the mechanical rainforest, I realized that the place answered a question I had never dared phrase. [380]
The air shivered with countless tiny ticks and whirs, but through them moved another current, like wind through thousands of leaves. [401]
Only these leaves were polished steel, and the breeze played them as if the forest itself were a listening ear. [421]
I closed my eyes and tried to orient myself by sound the way a blind person reads distances. [439]
I walked slowly, letting the sound of wind through different trees tell me where to step. [455]
The high fast whistle in the canopy meant the branches here were thin coils; the low grinding sigh marked heavy rotating crowns. [477]
Between them, I found safe paths, as though the forest accepted me as some uncertain apprentice. [493]
I did not know who had built this place, only that it felt older than my questions and younger than my fears. [515]
Somewhere in the distance, a deeper rhythm pulsed, a heart like a quiet piston calling me forward. [532]
I followed until I reached a clearing where roots of braided copper held a circular platform above a pool of mercury. [553]
Reflected in the trembling mirror was not my face, but a shifting landscape of memories, some mine, some impossible. [572]
City streets I never walked, conversations I almost had, childhood days from lives I did not remember living. [590]
My sixth sense thrummed, telling me that the pool showed the wild frontier of my mind, the pieces exiled by ordinary days. [612]
I had come here, or been dragged here by sleep, to rediscover that frontier before it rusted under habit. [631]
Above the platform hung a lattice of branches, and at their center, one tooth was missing from a grand bronze gear. [652]
My hand moved to my pocket before my thoughts caught up. [663]
The small gear there had exactly the right number of teeth to complete the circle overhead. [679]
I hesitated, feeling the probable weight of what would happen, a miracle hovering just shy of certainty. [696]
The forest seemed to lean in; the trees stilled their turning, and even the wind paused to listen. [714]
I reached up on my toes and pressed the gear into place. [726]
For a moment, nothing occurred, and disappointment began to creep in like fog along a river. [742]
Then the completed mechanism shuddered and began to spin, slow at first, then faster, until the entire canopy resonated. [761]
The hum of insight rose from a faint vibration to a clear tone that filled my sinuses and ribs. [780]
The sound poured down into the mercury pool, sending ripples across my reflected not self. [795]
I let the vision be. [800]</story>
