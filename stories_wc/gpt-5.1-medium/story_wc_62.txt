<story>The first time Elias carved a butterfly into stone, it was by mistake. [13]
His chisel slipped at the edge of a name, and the stray curve unfurled wings along the margin of the granite. [34]
Now, years later, he stood in the ancient greenhouse at dusk, listening to the glass bones of its roof tick as the heat fled the day. [60]
Outside, the first wave of the butterfly migration blurred the cemetery paths, a slow river of color moving south. [79]
Elias, a thoughtful gravestone carver and a fiercely meditative man, had brought his tools here because the workshop felt too crowded with unfinished sorrow. [103]
On the potting bench beside him lay a narrow woven ribbon roll, pale blue with silver threads, its loose end pinned under a rusted trowel. [128]
It was all that remained from his grandmother, who had taught him, patiently and sternly, that the way a name entered stone could quiet an entire village. [155]
She also left him one more inheritance, less visible than the ribbon: a spectral mentorship that returned each autumn with the butterflies. [177]
He felt her before he saw her, the air turning dense as though the greenhouse were taking a deep breath. [197]
The glass panes dimmed, and his grandmother stepped out between the shadows of the fig trees, the woven pattern of her old house dress flickering like a second ribbon. [226]
You brought it, she said, nodding toward the ribbon roll, her voice carrying the thundering calm of rain on distant hills. [247]
Elias exhaled, the breath leaving him in a fog that should not have been possible in the warm glass house. [267]
I thought we were done with lessons, he replied, but even as he spoke he smoothed the ribbon with calloused fingers. [288]
She smiled, a small rearrangement of shadow. [295]
Grief is never done, she said, and you have begun to hear questions in the stone that I never answered. [315]
He knew what she meant, for lately every commission had felt like a fragment of a larger design, as if the village were trying to tell him one immense story about the dead. [348]
He wanted, more than sleep, to discover the shape of collective grief, to see how all the losses braided together beneath the surface of their lives. [374]
This year, his grandmother said, the butterflies will stay longer; across the full span of their migration, we will retrace the sorrow that brought them here. [400]
You will carve, and I will show you what you have been learning with your eyes closed. [417]
He nodded, remembering the family custom of trading favorite poems at dinner, each person reciting a few lines so that the table filled with other peoples words instead of small talk. [448]
Those evenings had felt like practice for this moment, for finding language precise enough to hold grief without letting it spill. [469]
His grandmother gestured toward the far end of the greenhouse, where slabs of raw stone leaned against cracked brick like unfinished doors. [491]
So they began, night after night, while the butterflies slept in trembling clusters on the ivy outside and dusk thickened early over the graves. [515]
Each visit, she led him to a different stone commissioned that week: the boy who drowned, the midwife who whispered the first breaths of half the village, the beekeeper who died in winter because he could not bear to see his hives empty. [558]
For every name, she asked him to speak aloud the poem that came first to his tongue, then to choose one line and carve it in secret along the base, hidden but present. [591]
Between the letters, he threaded the pale ribbon, measuring each span and marking it with charcoal, so that the roll grew dark with a map of all the graves he had touched. [623]
On the last night of the migration, when the butterflies began to lift in restless spirals against the greenhouse glass, his grandmother told him it was time to retrace their path. [654]
Together they walked from stone to stone, the ribbon unwinding behind them like a thin, determined river, each charcoal mark lining up with a carved secret line of verse. [683]
He read the hidden words under his breath, and with each one he heard an answering murmur rise from the ground, not as voices but as a pressure, a shared ache changing shape. [716]
By the time they reached the far hill, the ribbon was almost spent, and he understood that the village had been grieving not only for the dead but for the distances between the living. [750]
The butterflies rose in a single thrum, a soft roar of wings pulsing through the dusky air, and the sound laid itself over the graves like a great, steadying hand. [780]
In that moment he understood grief as a ribbon, binding solitary hearts into one quiet body. [796]</story>
