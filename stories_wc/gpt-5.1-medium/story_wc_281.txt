<story>After the static shock, the world felt briefly outlined in crackling white, as if redrawn. [15]
Eli blinked in the darkened light painting studio, fingertips still buzzing from the faulty switch. [30]
He exhaled slowly, watching his breath cloud the faint beams from the fiber brushes on the table. [47]
Across the room, Naya cradled the muscovite geode sliver like a fragile memory waiting to be spoken. [64]
She was an affectionate skeptic, always doubting the method but never the person who believed in it. [81]
You sure the pill wore off? she asked, tilting the sliver so it caught the stray light. [98]
Telepathy pill recall was supposed to fade in two hours, not leave him sparking like a live wire. [116]
Eli flexed his fingers and felt, instead of pain, the feather-touch awareness of Nayas gaze on his skin. [134]
Yeah, he said, but I think the static jump-started something the drug only hinted at. [149]
The geode sliver warmed in Nayas palm, mica facets catching the projector glow in fractally precise reflections. [166]
The lab said it boosts latent pattern recognition, not long distance mind reading. [179]
You got your refund, remember. [184]
I remember everything, Eli murmured, and that is the problem. [194]
He closed his eyes, letting the humming darkness press close, and waited for the afterimages to settle. [211]
Shapes hung behind his eyelids, drifting lines of colored light from last nights performance, each path a question mark. [230]
They had built the show to illuminate hidden pathways in the audience minds, a moving maze of luminosity. [248]
Now those paths clung to him like cobwebs of possible choices, tugging whenever he tried to rest. [265]
Tell me what you feel, Naya said, softer now, as if speaking into a fragile glass. [281]
Eli lowered himself to the floor, back against the cool wall, and let his hand hover near hers. [299]
Not touching, not quite, but close enough that the air between their fingers felt knitted and trembling. [316]
The doctor had said the telepathy was not magic, just a heightened reading of signals through somatic markers. [334]
Muscle tension, microexpressions, subtle shifts in heat and breath, all woven into meaning before thought caught up. [351]
But after the static shock, those markers had become pathways, and the pathways had become almost visible. [368]
Fine, he said, voice steadier than he felt, let us treat this like a design problem. [384]
We devise a way to aim whatever this is, instead of letting it chew through my sleep. [401]
Naya smiled, the quick sideways curve he trusted more than any guarantee printed on a bottle. [417]
Okay, she said, show me your haunted corridors, professor. [426]
He focused on the sensation in his chest, a faint forward leaning whenever a memory wanted to bloom. [444]
It was willowglass hope, fragile but flexible, reflecting every doubt while bending toward some yet unseen clearing. [461]
As he leaned into it, the studio fell away, and he was back onstage, lights sweeping like comets. [479]
He felt Nayas hand not on his skin but tracing along the edge of his memory, steadying. [496]
Here, she whispered, though her lips barely moved, this is where you started mapping them. [511]
Lines of light unfurled from his chest outward, threads looping from one face in the audience to another. [529]
Each line carried not words but feelings, somersaults of curiosity, stabs of fear, quiet pools of grief. [546]
He had soaked them in without knowing, the pill opening doors his ethics had never consented to unlock. [564]
Now he saw the pathways between those feelings, how one joke redirected despair, how a color quieted rage. [582]
We can learn from this, Naya murmured inside the vision, not to pry, but to guide. [598]
You do not have to carry every echo; you can devise patterns that return the light. [614]
He turned slowly within the web of lines, noticing where threads tangled into knots of shared hurt. [631]
There, a cluster near the back row, a tightness that matched the ache in his own ribs. [648]
He reached, not with hands but with intention, letting his breath slow, inviting the knot to loosen. [665]
Light shifted, colors reweaving, the muscovite geode sliver in Nayas hand flaring as if in sympathetic relief. [682]
In the present, he heard Naya gasp, then laugh, the sound full of astonishment and something like gratitude. [700]
You redirected it, she said aloud now, touching his arm, you changed how the memory sits in you. [718]
Not just in me, Eli replied, opening his eyes to the dim studio, I think I nudged their paths too. [738]
Naya looked down at the sliver, now dull again, and her skepticism folded into something more complicated. [755]
So, she said slowly, maybe your cursed souvenir is actually a tool, and this studio becomes our compass. [773]
Eli felt the buzzing in his fingertips settle into a steady hum, like distant traffic on a clear night. [792]</story>
