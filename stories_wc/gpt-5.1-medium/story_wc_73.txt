<story>The staircase had no first step and no last, only a gray ribbon twisting forever through blankness. [17]
Arin climbed it as he always had, boots scuffing stone that never wore down, a grim optimist in motion. [36]
He carried a small velvet bag in his pocket, and inside rattled a pair of dice, one chipped. [54]
The flaw on the corner made the cube wobble strangely when thrown, favoring no number, just the act of falling. [74]
Arin liked that, because he believed fairness lived not in outcomes but in second chances. [89]
Above him, below him, the infinite staircase spiraled in both directions, like a diagram for perpetual motion sketched by an exhausted god. [111]
He climbed not to reach an end, which he knew did not exist, but to prove why ending was unnecessary. [131]
He sought to build, through mathematical proofs traced in his notebook, an engine that could never run down. [149]
Motion without fuel, ascent without arrival, a system that would honor effort alone. [162]
This, he told himself, was how he would finally capture the texture of a missed opportunity. [178]
Not by going back, which the staircase refused, but by refusing to stop walking forward. [193]
Each landing he passed looked almost like the last, yet each held some small asymmetry, a hairline rupture in the pattern. [214]
Here a cracked baluster, there a darker stone, elsewhere a railing warm as though just gripped by another unseen climber. [234]
Arin paused at such places, fingers resting on the evidence of difference, and tried to imagine the choice he had not made. [256]
There had been a doorway once, back when steps still seemed finite, and someone in its frame who had asked him to stay. [279]
He had not, because the staircase promised everything if he kept climbing, and he had been balancedly daring enough to believe it. [301]
Now the promise felt like a contract signed in fog, legible only at certain angles, dissolving whenever he tried to read it fully. [324]
He took out the dice and rolled them on the step ahead; they clattered, spun, and settled on eight. [343]
Eight meant nothing, of course; numbers never carried messages except the ones imposed by frightened minds. [359]
Still, the chipped die lay skewed, its imperfection insisting that chance was always already written into the stone. [377]
He scribbled in his notebook, lines of symbols marching like stairs, each deduction leaning on the last, climbing toward a sealed horizon. [399]
Through mathematical proofs, he argued that if motion could be perfectly transferred between steps, the system would sustain itself forever. [419]
Every ascent would feed the next, every breath push another body upward, no energy lost, no fatigue allowed. [437]
It was nonsense, perhaps, but beautiful nonsense, and beauty, he suspected, might be the only perpetual motion available to the human mind. [459]
A shudder ran through the staircase, subtle as a change in thought, and a crack chased itself along the inner wall. [480]
Arin braced himself, hand on the railing, as the rupture widened and a slice of the world outside showed through. [500]
Not sky, not earth, just another staircase crossing this one at an impossible angle, its steps empty, its landings dim. [520]
For a moment he saw himself on that other path, older or younger or simply different, paused beside a doorway he had entered. [543]
The figure looked back across the gap, and their eyes met like parallel mirrors, doubling the narrow space between them into eternity. [565]
He lifted his hand, dice cupped in his palm, but the crack shivered shut before he could offer them across. [585]
The stair under his feet steadied; the world resumed its gray, unruffled turning, and the missed opportunity passed into certainty. [605]
Arin stood breathing hard, as though he had run, though he had moved only a single step. [622]
Texture, he realized, did not belong to what might have been, but to the grain of the present scuffing beneath his boots. [644]
If he wanted to trap that feeling, he would have to keep walking, letting each unchosen path press lightly against his skin and fade. [668]
He pocketed the dice, trusting the chip to tilt nothing and everything, and set his foot on the next step. [688]
Boundless confinement awaited above and below, but within that endless corridor of stone his choices still made small, stubborn circles of meaning. [710]
So Arin climbed, a grim optimist with proofs in his pocket and a world of doors he would never open behind him. [732]</story>
