<story>The first time I met the counterfeit emotion dealer, the amber grotto at dusk hummed like a low, patient heart. [20]
Light from fossilized resin seeped through the stone ribs overhead, staining every face with a syrupy, honeyed sorrow. [38]
I had come because my own feelings were unreliable, glitching like a radio between stations, and business required clarity. [57]
As the memory auditor for the city courts, I was expected to be professionally thorough, surgically precise, and utterly unshakeable. [77]
But lately, whenever I touched the evidence spools, static crawled up my fingers and whispered feelings that were not mine. [97]
That was how I sensed now, through static electricity, tasting other people's terrors and hopes in faint, crackling halos. [116]
The emotion dealer sat on a crate of bottled moods, sleeves rolled, revealing wrists netted with thin copper filaments that arced softly. [138]
His smile was kind without belonging to him, as if borrowed for the evening from a warmer, braver man. [157]
You are Eve Kanner, the auditor who cannot trust her own verdicts anymore, he said, as though reading a file. [177]
I noticed the fragrance chemist's blotter petal tucked behind his ear, stained a deep umber, exhaling a ghost of burnt sugar. [198]
It fluttered when he spoke, as if catching scents of my doubt and cataloguing them for resale. [215]
You deal in counterfeit feelings, I said, choosing a flat tone; our codes classified his trade as psychological forgery. [234]
He shrugged with affectionate detachment, as though the accusation were a small, familiar dog tugging at his trousers. [252]
Authentic, counterfeit, he replied; people do not come to me for purity, they come for usable narratives. [269]
Half truths spend easier than whole ones, softer on the tongue, quicker into the bloodstream. [284]
I had been raised to hate half truths, those slippery compromises beneath perjury, but now my own clarity felt authoritarian and thin. [306]
The courts wanted verdicts carved in granite; the minds I audited were mud, rain, and shifting footsteps. [323]
So I had come here with a question: could borrowed emotions help me fuse insight with empathy instead of sacrificing one for the other? [347]
He listened as I explained, fingers resting lightly on a jar labeled Consolation, Bulk, his copper wires flickering where they met the glass. [370]
You wish to feel what your subjects feel, without becoming them, he summarized, and to distinguish fact from the emotions that obscure it. [393]
That balance does not exist naturally, Eve; it must be engineered, he said, tapping the blotter petal against his lower lip. [414]
What I offer is a scaffold of feelings, counterfeit yet tailored, upon which your real perceptions might safely climb. [433]
He invited me deeper into the grotto, where the amber walls thickened, catching dust and echoes in their golden trap. [453]
Shelves grew from the stone like ribs, cradling vials of diluted fear, filtered grief, and enthusiasm with the sharper edges sanded away. [475]
I felt the static deepen as we walked, my hair lifting, each step stirring invisible fields that tasted of rain on copper. [497]
The dealer selected a small ampoule with a practiced hand, his movements professionally thorough, reverent as a surgeon choosing an instrument. [518]
This is calibrated empathy without surrender, he explained; a counterfeit that admits itself a counterfeit, a half truth that glows in the dark. [541]
You will still know where you end and the other begins, but their tides will wash close enough to leave readable patterns. [563]
What is the price, I asked, though the static in my fingertips already reached hungrily for the ampoule's thin glass. [583]
Nothing you do not already pay, he said; only that, for a time, your certainties will be subsumed into questions. [603]
As the transformation completes, you may not like the person who walks back out of this grotto wearing your name. [623]
He broke the ampoule over the blotter petal, which drank the liquid with a hushed, thirsty sound, then pressed it into my palm. [646]
The moment fabric touched skin, the grotto dimmed, and a soft storm of borrowed feeling rose, threading itself through my nerves like silver roots. [670]
I sensed the fear of a teenage witness, metallic and hot; the resigned hope of an old thief, tasting of weak tea; the brittle pride of a judge, sharp as bitten glass. [702]
They layered beneath my own emotions instead of replacing them, like subtitles under an image, shifting yet legible. [720]
For the first time, my static sense did not drown me; it arranged itself, assembling patterns the way constellations emerge from scattered stars. [743]
I could feel where each story lied, not by the heat of deception, but by the cool absence where true pain should have burned. [767]
Half truths glimmered before me, no longer enemies to be crushed, but scaffolds to climb toward a clearer, kinder vantage. [787]</story>
