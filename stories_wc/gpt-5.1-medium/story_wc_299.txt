<story>The quarry office trailer shuddered each time a dump truck growled past outside. [13]
Eli Meeks steadied the wobbly card table with his knee and told himself it felt almost like a stage again. [33]
A very small, badly lit stage where nobody clapped. [42]
He set the magnifying loupe to his eye, insulating himself emotionally with facts the way other people wore earplugs. [61]
Mahogany cabinet, 1967, British, probably from a touring bass rig, cigarette burns along the top edge. [77]
The auction house wanted to know if the amp could be linked to anybody famous, anybody worth mentioning in the catalog copy. [99]
Eli wanted to know if it was his. [107]
Outside, the quarry spread in a wide gray bowl, an echo valley that swallowed sound and fed it back a second later, thinner and unsure. [132]
At dusk, when the machines cut off, the silence out there felt exactly like after the applause used to feel backstage. [153]
Once, he had lived for that moment, the stunned ringing in his ears after the last crash of cymbals, the crowd noise falling away like a curtain. [180]
Now he cataloged objects from other peoples shows, assigning numbers instead of set lists. [194]
Confidently uncertain, that was how his manager at the appraisal firm described him in quarterly reviews. [210]
You sound sure but you leave a door open, Eli, hedging without looking like you are, she had said, and he had taken it as a compliment because it sounded like something a good frontman might do with a crowd. [250]
But on the internet livestream last month, when he had declared a counterfeit amp authentic, there was nothing confidently uncertain about the comment section. [274]
The clip of him saying one hundred percent real, no doubt about it had looped with sarcastic subtitles until the company suspended him pending review. [299]
Failing publicly felt different at fifty-one than it had when he dropped a monitor off the stage in Toledo and the singer made a joke into the mic. [327]
Back then, the crowd had roared, loving the chaos, and afterward the applause had felt like forgiveness. [344]
Now algorithms replayed his mistake in private living rooms he would never see. [357]
Suspension meant freelance work, whatever the temp agency could wrest from odd clients, so here he was in a quarry office trailer appraising gear salvaged from a bankrupt rehearsal space. [387]
The foreman had shrugged and said the stuff belonged to some guys who never paid their rent, band or something, and that the unit was getting cleared for stone samples. [417]
Eli had nodded, absorbing the facts like sandbags against a flood he refused to name. [432]
Loss, he told himself, was only a misalignment of expectations and reality. [444]
Say it that way and it did not sound like divorce, or waking up in a motel parking lot to find the bus gone, or watching a comment counter climb under your humiliation. [477]
The amp on the table was doped in decades of dust, but under the grime his fingers recognized the curve of the cabinet lip with a jolt that bypassed thought. [507]
He had loaded this exact model in and out of trailers, counted its handles by feel in the dark, cursed its weight on narrow backstage stairs. [533]
He slid the chassis forward, heart kicking, and saw the speaker grille cloth scrap tucked behind the power transformer, its faded pattern of silver threads and cigarette singe unmistakable. [562]
He had torn that scrap himself in Milwaukee, yanking gaffer tape too fast while the headliner yelled about buzz, and the singer had laughed and told him he was putting his signature on the rig. [597]
You break it, you name it, Eli, she had said, looping a cable around his neck like a medal. [616]
He sank back on the folding chair, the trailer buzzing faintly with fluorescent light and old wiring, and for a moment the facts deserted him. [641]
All that remained was the memory of that singers voice cracking on the last tour, of the manager counting losses, of Eli waking one morning to find the bus not gone this time but up for sale on a website. [681]
After the applause had died for good, nobody told him where to stand or what to lift, and the quiet had been louder than any crowd. [707]
He had thought becoming an antiques appraiser would give that quiet shape, a way to measure the past instead of drowning in it. [730]
Instead, he had carried the same emptiness into climate-controlled rooms, just with better lighting and more paperwork. [747]
Looking at the scrap of grille cloth, he realized the story mattered more than the signature, and that nobody but him could tell this one straight. [773]
He picked up his pen and wrote, Provenance uncertain, but history priceless to those who remember. [789]
He felt, dimly, to discover purpose after loss was enough, finally. [800]</story>
