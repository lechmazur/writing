<story>After the wind chime fell silent, Tomas stayed alone on the midnight ridgeway at twilight. [15]
Twilight bled along the reservoir shore, a thin bruise between land and sky. [28]
The water lay in a mirrored hush, holding upside down the skeletal piers and lamp posts. [44]
He was the vigilant levee warden here, vigilant by habit and by grief. [57]
Tonight his rounds were slower, his footsteps measured like someone pacing the edge of a photograph. [73]
The reservoir had dropped another foot, and the old town was coming back. [86]
Broken rooftops breached the surface, chimneys poked out like gray fingers, streets traced themselves in lines of exposed stone. [105]
People called it the reservoir town resurfacing, as if a memory could simply climb the ladder of evaporation. [123]
For Tomas, it felt more like the dead insisting they had never agreed to leave. [138]
He paused where the ridgeway narrowed beside the levee gatehouse and listened to the stillness. [153]
Behind him, at the caretaker cottage, the wind chime gave no answer, its song long ended. [169]
He had taken it down himself after his wife Mara died, unable to bear its random consolations. [186]
Since then, his care of the levee had grown almost ritual, a precisely humane attention to every crack and rivet. [206]
He believed in structures that held, even when people did not. [217]
Down on the exposed mud of what used to be Market Street, something glinted blue. [232]
Tomas crossed the slope, boots sucking at the wet ground, until his hand closed around a scrap of paper. [251]
It was a liqueur label, sapphire hued even under the dull sky, its edges furred with algae. [268]
The cursive letters blurred, but one word still leapt at him, the brand Mara used to buy for rare celebrations. [288]
He could see her in the kitchen, laughing for his sake more than her own, twisting the bottle toward the light. [309]
The label in his hand smelled of river rot, but the color was unabashed, a small defiance of drowning. [328]
He slipped it into his coat and noticed, a few yards away, the pale rectangle of a photograph half buried in silt. [350]
The image showed the same liqueur bottle on a bar counter, behind it the old town cinema marquee. [368]
Someone had written a date on the back in blue ink, the year the dam first filled. [385]
Tomas looked up, and for the first time he realized the photographs were not random debris. [401]
They marked a line, scattered along the slope like breadcrumbs, each catching the last light in a small silver flash. [421]
He followed a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory, his breath soft, the water on one side, the waking town on the other. [446]
Each photograph was a scene from before the flooding, yet each held some detail he had forgotten, or never known. [466]
A boy on a bicycle passing the tailor shop, the mayor tapping a microphone, his younger self leaning on a truck bed. [488]
Whoever left these, he thought, wanted him to remember not just structures, but stories. [502]
He had spent years tightening bolts and reading pressure gauges, while the town treated the reservoir as a placid erasure. [522]
Now the drowned streets rose again, asking for something other than engineering reports. [535]
At the end of the ridge, where the old church steeple peered from the water like a question, the trail stopped. [556]
The last photograph showed Mara standing on that very spot, hair blown across her face, laughing toward the person behind the camera. [578]
He did not remember taking it, yet the angle betrayed his height, his guarded affection. [593]
A forgotten memory slid back into place, and with it a different version of himself, one who believed stories could hold water too. [616]
He understood then that whoever had laid this path wanted him to do more than guard a wall. [634]
They wanted him to spin stories into shared meaning, to keep the town from pretending its past was merely silt. [654]
The council would soon demand reports on subsidence and stress, ask whether houses could be salvaged or should be blasted and buried again. [677]
They would want to expunge the awkward half life of this resurfacing, tidy their maps, and move on. [695]
Tomas looked from the photograph in his hand to the steeple, then to the dim shapes of neighbors gathering on the dam road. [718]
He walked back up the ridgeway, his grief and duty balanced like water on either side. [734]
They fell silent as he approached, all their questions crowding the air but not yet spoken. [750]
The mirrored hush between them and the darkening reservoir felt as fragile as glass. [764]
Tomas held up the photograph of Mara, the sapphire label, the boy on the bicycle, and began. [781]
He started not with warnings, but with a story, and watched their listening faces become another kind of levee. [800]</story>
