<story>After the mirror cracked, the quay no longer looked like a place belonging to the living. [16]
I sat with my brushes and boards, a nostalgic quay painter stranded between tides and fragments of reflection. [34]
The broken mirror lay against the salt stained wall of my shack, its spiderweb fractures dividing yesterday from now. [53]
In every shard I saw the same promise I had made to myself long ago and never yet kept. [72]
I had sworn to paint the one place in this town that did not yet exist, then make it real. [92]
It was a hidden promise to myself, foolish and private, like a bottle thrown into an empty sea. [110]
People called me intimately aloof, close enough to smell the turpentine on my hands yet distant as the horizon. [129]
I belonged to the quay but never quite to its people, as if my home were somewhere still unfinished. [148]
On the table beside the cracked mirror rested a single painted seashell, the only survivor of simpler days. [166]
I had painted it as a boy, clumsy strokes turning ordinary spiral into a storm of cobalt and gold. [185]
Back then, time felt like a circle inside the shell, forever returning yet somehow never leaving the present. [203]
My father had called that feeling temporary eternity, the illusion that a moment could stretch without ever breaking. [221]
He was wrong about many things, but not about that; the quay made such moments and then erased them. [240]
The night the mirror cracked, I decided the time for waiting was over, and I went searching for my painting. [260]
Not the canvas itself, which had never existed, but the scene it demanded I find. [275]
I followed the moonlit path along the quay, past sleeping boats and shuttered taverns, until the town dissolved into rocks. [295]
There was an old track the fishermen used, carved between boulders and scrub, but at the fork I took a wrong turn. [317]
The path narrowed, the sea vanished behind high stone, and I slipped through a cleft to a hidden oasis of saltwater light. [339]
It was the mouth of the coastal cave network we were warned about as children, a labyrinth where tides devoured wanderers. [360]
Yet the air inside was warm and still, tasting of lime and old storms, as if the sea held its breath. [381]
I stepped in, leaving the broken mirror and my shack and most of my fear behind me on the stones. [401]
The caves opened and narrowed like lungs, chambers echoing with drops of unseen water, their walls veined with gleaming minerals. [421]
Patterns gathered in the stone, shapes like sails, like eyes, like the spirals of a thousand unpainted seashells. [439]
I walked until my lantern guttered, until darkness pressed against me like wet cloth, intimate yet somehow still aloof. [458]
That was when the cavern widened without warning, and the ceiling tore open to a ragged circle of sky. [477]
Moonlight poured down a hidden shaft and struck a pool so clear it seemed made of glass before the moment of breaking. [499]
Around the pool, stalagmites rose like frozen waves, crests forever about to crash yet motionless, caught in temporary eternity. [518]
I knew then this was the place my broken mirror had been insisting upon, the scene my promise required. [537]
Here, the world balanced between collapse and stillness, everything poised on the edge of shattering but endlessly delayed. [555]
I set down my pack, took out a board and brushes, and opened the small tin of colors I had saved. [576]
Beside the water I placed the painted seashell, its worn cobalt storms facing the moon, a trembling compass for my hand. [597]
Every stroke I laid on the board felt like a reveal, stripping away stone to show the shape of longing beneath. [618]
I painted the pool not as it was, but as it seemed to wait to become, a mirror unbroken. [637]
The stalagmites I turned into waves held at their highest breath, the opening above into a distant, patient eye. [656]
As I worked, time loosened its grip, stretching thin and luminous, until hours and minutes lost their faces and became only movement. [678]
I understood then that my promise had never been to paint a masterpiece, but simply to witness this temporary eternity and bring back proof. [702]
When the painting was finished, I washed my brushes in the pool, and the water held the colors without mixing, as if agreeing to keep the secret. [729]
Carrying the board under my arm, the painted seashell in my pocket, I left the cavern by another passage and felt the night close around me like a curtain, knowing at last I had kept my hidden promise to myself. [769]</story>
