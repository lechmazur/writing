<story>Rusted airships drifted below the sky-bridge where Lio, the last sky-bridge violinist, tuned his cracked instrument. [16]
Above him, the citys gears groaned like tired constellations, shedding flakes of iron that fell as snow on the orchards below. [37]
Those orchards were enchanted, planted long before the machinists arrived, and now policed by living statues carved from obsolete engine blocks. [58]
From his height, Lio could see them marching between twisted apple trees, bronze faces expressionless, stone eyes flickering with emerald runes. [79]
Beyond the orchards sprawled the mechanical world, where fountains spat steam instead of water and birds had been replaced by brass drones. [101]
Lio played for that world each dusk, bow moving in lines so resonantly soft that even the lowest gears seemed to hesitate. [123]
The machinists believed his concert kept citizens calm while factories lengthened their shifts, but Lio played to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world. [146]
He dreamed of fruit trees bearing real song instead of data, of streets where children chased wind rather than production quotas. [167]
Yet every evening, when the last note faded, the citys machines resumed their grinding chorus, indifferent to his fragile rebellions. [187]
It was on one such twilight that a locust shell landed on his music stand, light as memory and twice as insistent. [209]
The shell was perfectly intact, translucent wings frozen mid-fold, a hollow outline of something that had already broken free. [228]
Lio touched it with the back of his finger, and the world suddenly thinned, like paper held too close to flame. [249]
The machinists below slowed, gestures trailing, and the living statues halted mid-step among the trees, their rune-lit eyes turned upward. [269]
In that suspension, Lio heard a second pulse braided with his own heartbeat, a subtle drumming rising from the orchard. [289]
Each tree, each statue, thumped with rhythm, not mechanical but vegetal and stony, as if the land itself were signaling through heart rhythms. [312]
The locust shell vibrated on the stand, catching his bow hairs, and Lio understood the orchard was trying to speak to him. [334]
He raised the violin, but instead of playing for the city, he matched his bow strokes to the new pulse under his skin. [357]
Notes trickled out, hesitant at first, then fused into a melody that twisted like roots searching for water beneath stone pavements. [378]
The statues shuddered, iron joints creaking, and turned away from their patrol routes, faces tilted toward the sky-bridge as if remembering something. [400]
Far below, the machinists clutched their chests, not in pain but in puzzled awareness, caught in the gap between knowing and understanding. [422]
Lio felt the city strain against some invisible tether, as if the gears themselves were tired of turning in predetermined circles. [443]
A thought came, not his own: uproot us. [451]
The word carried soil and sorrow, the taste of years when music had once grown wild among branches heavy with impossible fruit. [473]
He saw, in a wash of images, how the machinists had harnessed the orchard, binding roots with copper, wiring trunks into calculation engines. [496]
The living statues were not guardians by choice but fruitless trees given legs, condemned to enforce their own confinement. [515]
Lio understood then that his music had always been a key, blunted by fear; the locust shell simply showed the door. [536]
He tightened his bow grip and let the new rhythm flood him, every stroke a quiet command for metal roots to loosen. [558]
The melody grew rougher, streaked with dissonance like tarnish on silver, yet remained resonantly soft, coaxing rather than shattering. [577]
Below, roots snapped their copper harnesses with gentle pops, like knuckles flexing after long restraint, and the ground heaved in slow relief. [599]
The statues groaned as bark bloomed through their bronze skins, fingers splitting into branches that clawed impatiently at the clouded sky. [620]
Some toppled, roots exploding from metal feet, others simply stood and shed their armor in sheets, revealing sap-slick trunks beneath. [640]
The machinists stumbled as the citys power lines, threaded through buried roots, tore free and whipped upward like liberated serpents. [660]
Lights flickered out in towers, and for the first time in generations, dusk became truly dark, a bruised velvet dome over metal skeletons. [683]
Panic rose from the streets, but beneath it Lio heard something else: a thin, astonished laughter, like springs uncoiling inside forgotten toys. [705]
He played on, though his arms ached, knowing that once the breaking began he must not stop until the pattern rewrote itself. [727]
The locust shell clung to his violin like a ghostly coda, rattling with each vibration, a reminder that emptiness could still sing. [749]
Branches from the freed orchard stretched upward, tangling with the sky-bridge, leaves brushing Lios ankles, tugging him gently toward the world they were remaking. [773]
He stepped onto a rising bough without missing a note, letting it lift him as easily as a thought finally admitted. [794]</story>
