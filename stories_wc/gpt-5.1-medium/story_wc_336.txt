<story>The first time I met Lior, he was pruning ghosts from the apple trees. [14]
Or so it seemed, as every branch he touched shivered with light and memory. [28]
The orchard clung to a verdant parapet beside a waterfall, suspended like a balcony over mist. [44]
It was upon the hush of budding hope, the last frost barely melted from the stones. [60]
Lior, the wise orchard pruner, moved with the patience of years and the curiosity of childhood. [76]
His shears clicked softly, never hurried, as though each cut negotiated a treaty with the air. [92]
I had come seeking work, but stayed because the place held a radiant hush that listened back. [109]
The waterfall roared beyond the stone rail, yet within the trees there was a weaving between worlds. [126]
Wind carried the scent of bruised leaves, wet rock, and something sweeter, like memory steeped in sunlight. [143]
Lior noticed me watching and crooked a finger, inviting me among the rows of twisted trunks. [159]
You carry questions like unwatered seeds," he said, his voice rough yet kind. [172]
Tell me what you hope to grow. [179]
I could not answer, because hope had felt like a luxury I could no longer afford. [195]
My city had collapsed under a slow siege of grayness, colors leached from sky, street, and thought. [212]
People moved like ghosts, speaking in tired bargains instead of dreams. [223]
I had fled upward, following rumor of a man who could succor weary imaginations by teaching them to prune. [242]
Lior listened to my halting story, then opened his palm to reveal a single heirloom seed. [258]
It was no larger than a tear, veined with faint iridescent threads that shifted when I breathed. [275]
This comes from the first tree that ever dared to remember its own blossoms, he said. [291]
I prune and plant to preserve the color of wonder, for the world forgets faster each year. [308]
The seed needs a keeper with an insatiably creative heart, someone who will never stop asking new questions. [326]
His gaze rested on me, not as a test but as a quiet invitation. [340]
What does it grow into? I asked, half afraid of his answer. [352]
Whatever you are brave enough to imagine, he replied, though not in the way you think. [368]
We plant it not in soil, but in the space between what is and what might be. [385]
I followed him past the last row, where the stone parapet curved outward over the waterfall. [401]
Mist cooled my face, and the roar below faded into a rhythmic breathing, as if the chasm slept. [419]
Here, Lior said, laying the seed upon the warm stone, this is where the worlds fray and braid. [437]
To tend this orchard is to practice weaving between worlds, so neither becomes thin or cruel. [453]
He placed his hands over the seed, not quite touching, and closed his eyes. [467]
Watch, and remember, he murmured, for remembering is how you water what cannot yet be seen. [483]
The air thickened, colors gathering from the corner of my sight, pooling around his fingers like ink in water. [502]
I felt something lean toward us, curious, the way a forest leans toward sunlight after long winter. [519]
Lior opened his eyes, and in his pupils I saw the orchard repeated in other seasons and other skies. [538]
Spring blossoms rained backward into buds; autumn fruit unspoiled itself; branches unbroke, healing without forgetting they had once been broken. [558]
This is how we succor a starving world, he said softly, by capturing essence before it dissipates. [575]
Not trapping it, but holding a mirror, so wonder recognizes itself and chooses to remain. [590]
He stepped back and nodded for me to take his place beside the resting seed. [605]
My hands trembled, but when I reached out, I felt threads of warmth lift from the stone. [622]
They were colors I had no names for, shades of possibility, tinged with fear and laughter. [638]
I thought of my gray city, its boarded windows, its dried-up fountains, the children who had never seen a rainbow. [658]
I imagined them running through streets painted with murals still wet, with music spilling like petals from open doors. [677]
The warmth surged, and the heirloom seed shimmered, absorbing the images, anchoring them within its translucent shell. [694]
Behind my closed eyelids, the orchard expanded, branches reaching down into my city, up into unfamiliar constellations, offering fruit that tasted like remembered courage. [718]
When I opened my eyes, the parapet was the same, and yet every leaf gleamed as if newly awake. [737]
Lior smiled, lines around his mouth deepening like rings in an ancient trunk. [750]
Now you know why we prune, he said, not to diminish, but to make room for what arrives next. [769]
The hush around us brightened, no longer empty, but waiting, and I realized I had finally planted my first true hope. [790]</story>
