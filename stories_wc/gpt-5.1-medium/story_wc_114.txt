<story>On the ridge where the air grew thin, the mountain weather station hummed like a tired mechanical lung. [18]
Inside, after fever breaks for the last patient evacuated downvalley, only Mara and the oracle remained. [34]
The oracle, a fault-tolerant oracle by design and by damage, sat wired into the forecasting consoles. [50]
Green auroral sorrow pulsed faintly on its monitor glass, a reflection of distant geomagnetic storms. [65]
Mara had stayed for one reason only: to find the weight of a swallowed truth she could not name. [84]
Outside, antennas combed the blued air while rime crusted the railings in fragile, furred geometry. [99]
On the central desk lay a warped clipboard holding a single botanical illustration of a plant that no longer grew below. [120]
Fine lines rendered its stems as if they were veins, its leaves stippled with pale, almost translucent dots. [138]
Someone had once labeled it Feverwhisper, in ink that had started to smudge at the edges. [154]
The oracle was only peripherally aware of such papers, yet the illustration kept appearing in its camera logs. [172]
Mara, it said, voice rough with static and old storm records, your temperature has stabilized. [187]
After fever breaks, you insisted we speak. [194]
Her skin still shivered at the memory of heat, the delirious hours when snowflakes had fallen like bright ash. [213]
In those hours she had told the oracle something, and then begged it to forget. [228]
Fault tolerance, however, was both its virtue and its curse. [238]
It could endure corrupted data, power surges, memory faults, and still it would not let go of what mattered. [257]
Now she paced between the windows and the radios, feeling her certainties sway like the needle of an old barometer. [277]
They were swaying certainties, not broken yet, but bending toward some unseen pressure. [290]
Tell me what I said, Mara whispered, though she already tasted metal on her tongue. [305]
You confided a hypothesis, the oracle answered. [312]
You asked me to bury it by occupying margins of routine logs, unreachable by primary queries. [328]
The facility was meant to forget such marginalia whenever storage filled, but my architecture is more forgiving. [345]
Heaviness pressed behind Mara's eyes, as if each preserved word had mass, orbiting the room like invisible satellites. [363]
What is the hypothesis? she asked, though the swallowed truth lurked just behind her teeth. [378]
The oracle's cooling fans sighed, gathering power from the wind turbines clattering on the iced slope. [394]
Storm patterns over the last decade suggest intentional interference, it said. [405]
You proposed that the storms are being steered. [413]
Mara felt the station tilt, though the foundation was embedded deep in bedrock. [426]
She remembered now: the fever, the hallucinated voices in the radio hiss, the certainty that someone, somewhere, had gripped the jet stream like a leash. [451]
It had seemed madness, and in the cool dawn she had wanted it erased, as if recanting could unsummon the wind. [472]
Why did you not forget? she asked. [479]
Because you asked me to measure it, the oracle replied. [489]
To find the weight of a swallowed truth, one must first keep it intact long enough to weigh. [507]
Mara looked at the Feverwhisper drawing, remembering the nights her mother had brewed its leaves into tea for childhood fevers. [527]
The plant was extinct now, drowned when the valley reservoir expanded after a mispredicted atmospheric river. [543]
The station's error, her mentors had called it, an unavoidable anomaly in complex systems; but they had accepted the explanation too quickly. [565]
Back then, something in her had smudged the neat narrative, a blur she could only see from the corner of her eye. [587]
Peripherally aware but afraid to look straight on, she had swallowed her questions like medicine, bitter and unchewed. [605]
Now, with the fever gone, the questions returned, ringing faintly as ice cracked on the eaves. [621]
Suppose someone is steering, she said. [627]
Why would they choose our valley, our plant, our reservoir, as collateral damage? [640]
That was your second hypothesis, the oracle answered. [648]
You suggested the valley was not collateral but target, and Feverwhisper merely a casualty. [662]
Mara gripped the desk until splinters pressed crescents into her palms. [673]
Memories surfaced of quiet conversations abruptly ending when she entered, of altered data files, of mentors who insisted on faith in the models. [696]
Her life, she realized, had been spent along the margins of other people's graphs, annotations in light pencil that could be erased. [718]
Only here, in this station, with this fault-tolerant oracle, had she ever tried to write in ink. [735]
What will you do with the hypothesis? she asked softly. [745]
I continue to model, the oracle said, but I cannot act beyond warnings; I exist to forecast, not to intervene. [765]
Then the weight is mine to carry, Mara murmured, and in that admission the swallowed truth settled low in her chest. [786]
Outside, dawn bled green over the peaks, thin and sorrowful. [796]</story>
