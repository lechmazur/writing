<story>On the floor of the iridescent cave inside the giant crystal geode, Lio sifted through cooling sea-foam. [17]
Each bubble hissed with a memory too light to keep its shape, and that was precisely his specialty. [35]
Lio was the only sea-foam recollectionist on this coast, a patient clerk of tides and forgotten footsteps. [52]
He vowed to catalogue every wandering path remembered by the waves, to discover why some paths disappear. [69]
It was a bright sort of sorrow, this work, like whistling in fog you knew would never lift. [87]
Today the cave chimed softly as sunlight threaded through the geode walls, scattering rainbows across pools of foam. [105]
His tools lay around him in orderly halos: nets of woven kelp, ink made from cuttlefish jokes, and the crater glass. [126]
The crater glass was a fist-sized chunk of fused seawater and meteor, green-black and pocked with tiny stars. [144]
Through it, memories refracted differently, revealing the missing pieces that simple foam could not hold. [159]
Lio lifted a fresh strand of foam with his net, closed one eye, and peered at it through the crater glass. [180]
Colors flared, then condensed into looping sigils that he jotted in his ledger; the symbols transliterates emotions into readable script. [200]
Joy curled in ascending spirals, loss sagged in broken arcs, and confusion arrived as smudges of tidal gray. [218]
This particular memory belonged to a traveler whose footprints had once tattooed the shoreline in fearless loops. [235]
The foam showed sand, then forest, then an abrupt blank, as if the world itself had politely stepped aside. [254]
Another vanished path. [257]
Lio knew he had only moments before memory fades, before the foam slumped back into meaningless salt. [274]
Humming under his breath, he traced the sigils into his ledger with seawater ink, anchoring the emotion to the page. [294]
The pattern of blanks was growing, and with it his unease, a small dark crab skittering in his thoughts. [313]
Paths did not simply end; they curled, branched, or doubled back in drunken cartwheels, but they did not vanish. [332]
Unless something gently erased them. [337]
He gazed up at the vaulted crystal ceiling, where the echoes of waves flickered like distant lantern festivals. [355]
Near the cave mouth, a migrating bird paused on its long invisible road, shook itself, and showered the rocks with tiny seeds. [377]
Lio watched them bounce and roll into crevices, each seed a possible story waiting for its own weather. [395]
Almost idly, he began to conjecture that the vanishing paths might be traced via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird. [417]
After all, if birds mapped the sky with their journeys, perhaps their crumbs marked the absences below. [434]
The idea felt ridiculous enough to be promising, like most truths the sea bothered to keep. [450]
Cheered by his own gloominess, he packed his tools, slipped the crater glass into a pouch, and followed the seeds. [470]
They trickled down a narrow tunnel he had never noticed, a prismatic crack burrowing deeper into the geode's heart. [489]
As he walked, crystals shifted from sea-green to bruised violet, humming with a low, consoling dissonance. [505]
The seeds shone faintly, as if remembering sun, and nestled in little hollows like punctuation in a forgotten sentence. [524]
Lio touched the first cluster, and the air thickened into foam without water, a dry surf of recollection. [542]
Through the crater glass he saw the traveler again, stepping from forest to emptiness, then continuing on a path that no longer existed. [565]
Beneath the vanished road lay a seam of raw, unpolished crystal, its facets smeared with unformed colors and skittish shadows. [585]
The world here, he realized, had simply not finished deciding what it wanted to be. [600]
To spare passing feet from walking on indecision, the sea had folded those paths away, tucking them into gentle erasures. [620]
The missing pieces were not stolen; they were postponed. [629]
Lio let out a soft laugh that echoed strangely, half-mirth and half-mourning, the natural dialect of cheerful gloom. [647]
Carefully, he transliterates emotions swirling in the unfinished crystal, mapping the hesitant hope, the shy terror, the sly excitement of unborn roads. [669]
In his ledger he left the paths blank but labeled them with small symbols that meant, in his private notation, 'Not yet, but soon'. [693]
When he finally emerged back into the main cave, seeds still clinging to his boots, the tide had crept closer, curious and patient. [716]
He knelt in the foamy shallows and whispered his findings, letting the waves read over his shoulder. [733]
In return, the sea gifted him a new surge of memories, bright and incomplete, trusting him to keep watch until they were ready to walk. [758]
Lio smiled, feeling the familiar ache of things half-formed, and set to work before any of it could fade. [777]</story>
