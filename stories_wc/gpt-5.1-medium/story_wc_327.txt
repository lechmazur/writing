<story>The copper-veined storyteller arrived at the canyon of endless echoes just before dusk, walking alone beside his mule. [18]
Ahead, towers of bone rose like pale lightning frozen in stone, their hollows whistling with restless memory. [35]
Between them gaped the entrance to the tunnel of echoes, a black throat swallowing every stray sound and footstep. [54]
He paused, quietly articulate even in silence, fingertips tracing the copper veins that webbed his own weathered wrists. [72]
All his life he had walked the world to translate texture into sound, to give roughness and smoothness voices. [91]
Now his work stretched across the death of a language, recording last words nobody alive still knew how to speak. [111]
In his pocket lay a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed, its imperfect heart clouded like trapped breath. [129]
That stone, people said, swallowed stories or twisted them, yet he carried it as his most precise instrument. [147]
He used it to harness meanings hidden in motion, reading them through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight. [168]
Here, though, no birds circled the towers of bone; even scavengers shunned the echoes that never ended. [185]
He stepped into the tunnel of echoes, and every footfall multiplied, marching ahead like ghosts rehearsing his choices. [203]
The walls, smooth in some places and jagged in others, pulsed faintly with the breath of wind and forgotten syllables. [223]
He ran his palm along the stone, feeling pocks, ridges, and faint carvings, imagining how each texture might sound if spoken. [244]
Then he took out the flawed diamond and pressed it gently against the wall, letting its edges catch the darkness. [264]
The curse, he believed, was only that it showed the truth too clearly for fragile minds to bear. [282]
Inside the stone, fractures caught the faint tremors of the canyon, splitting them into prismatic threads of possible sound. [301]
He tilted his head, quietly articulate even in thought, and listened for textures hiding within the vibrations like seeds. [320]
Years before, he had first learned the stone's language by studying cranes over salt flats, memorizing their sudden swerves and spirals. [341]
Those flights had mapped the grammar of a tongue already dying, each turn a verb, each lift of wing a question. [362]
Now he read the fractured light inside the diamond the way he had read those birds, sentence after glimmering sentence. [382]
The canyon spoke slowly through it, a language of pressure and erosion, already half dead from lack of listeners. [401]
The towers of bone, he learned, were not monuments but vertebrae of something that had once wrapped the valley like a ring. [423]
Its movements had carved the canyon and its breathing had filled the first words of the people who lived here. [443]
Those people had vanished, their language crumbling into isolated echoes still trapped in the tunnel, wearing grooves into the stone. [463]
He had come to catch those last grooves and give them sound again before they ground themselves entirely to dust. [483]
He whispered nonsense syllables into the tunnel, letting them ricochet along the walls until they warped into unfamiliar tones. [502]
The diamond absorbed those warped textures and returned them as soft glows on its flaws, each glow a tentative phoneme. [522]
He spoke them back, quietly articulate, feeling the syllables scratch his throat like sand yet leaving his mouth strangely refreshed. [542]
The tunnel of echoes shuddered, and new voices surfaced from its depths, layered over his like distant harmonies. [560]
In that moment he understood the curse anew: every story the diamond touched became entwined with all the others. [579]
His own voice was being braided into the canyon's dying language, copper veins joining bone and stone in shared resonance. [599]
He did not step back; instead he chose to harness that merging, guiding it like reins through his breath. [618]
Ridges in the walls translated into rising notes, pits into pauses, and polished stretches into long vowels that fluttered. [637]
Outside, the towers of bone vibrated faintly, shedding powder that sparkled as it fell, like molted letters from an unwritten script. [658]
Far above, a small flock of dark birds finally crossed the sky, their shifting patterns echoing the rhythms inside the tunnel. [679]
Through the flawed diamond he aligned his voice to their flight, letting each turn tighten or loosen his tone. [698]
Across the death of a language he sang another into being, woven from bone dust, echoes, birds, and his own veins. [719]
If the diamond was cursed, then so was every bridge between worlds, but he accepted the burden and kept speaking. [739]</story>
