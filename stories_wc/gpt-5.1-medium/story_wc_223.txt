<story>During an interregnum, when the city had a king-shaped vacancy but no throne, I took temp work at the whispering gallery. [21]
Tourists believed I was only there to shush them, but my contract listed me as Acoustic Integrity Liaison. [39]
Unofficially, I was gathering material to become the historian of small gestures. [51]
In that domed chamber, whispers arrived stripped of faces, turning into a kind of luminous absence that hung between strangers. [71]
People came to test the acoustics, but they stayed to test what they could say without ever being seen. [90]
I walked continuous circuits along the curved wall, my steps tracing a pattern of walking that spells words only the stone could read. [113]
I spelled apologies I owed, names I had forgotten, headlines I had once pretended to survive. [129]
Before this job, I had worked as a crisis actor, hired to imitate terror so audiences could rehearse their compassion. [149]
Then the staged emergency became real, smoke replacing glycerin, bullets replacing blanks, and I became a crisis actor real crisis survivor in the same breath. [174]
News crews wanted my story, but all I could remember clearly were fingers brushing shoulders, the small, frantic courtesies of people who thought they were still acting. [201]
So I came to the gallery, where touch was traded for echo, and began archiving gestures by their sounds. [220]
A cough at thirty meters was often a swallowed confession; a laugh at fifteen was usually a failed lie. [239]
I kept a notebook like a field medic of silences, annotating the pauses that clung to the dome long after their owners left. [262]
On the third Thursday, the custodian wheeled out a glass case containing a chessboard missing all the pawns and set it near the center. [286]
He told me it was part of an exhibit about leaderless systems, but the board felt more like a morgue drawer for expendability. [309]
Visitors circled it and whispered strategies that no longer required sacrifice, as if omitting the pawns could unbind them from guilt. [330]
The missing pieces haunted me; I was one of them, a pawn who had walked off the board and kept walking. [351]
Some evenings, after closing, the custodian and I played phantom games on the empty grid, moving only knights and bishops through the glass with our eyes. [377]
He was benevolently ruthless in his play, sacrificing everything for position, then offering me tea when I inevitably lost. [396]
I asked where the pawns had gone, and he said quietly that they were out in the world, practicing new openings. [417]
That night, as I made my closing circuit, my footsteps spelled a question: what does a pawn become when it refuses promotion. [440]
The dome answered with a draft that slipped along the walls like a nomadic penumbra, a traveling shadow searching for another body. [462]
I realized the city itself was in that same state, orbiting the absent monarch, everyone walking careful circles around power that was not there. [486]
During the day, the ministers argued on television; at night, the gallery filled with their citizens, practicing how to be subjects of nothing. [509]
One woman whispered across the dome to a man she could not see, asking him to sign their divorce papers before the new regime arrived. [534]
He answered with a soft knock on the stone, three beats that translated perfectly into I will. [551]
I logged the exchange as Gesture 187: consent without eye contact, exemplary. [563]
Another evening, a boy recited the news report of my own disaster from the far side, his voice trembling as he played it for his unseen parents. [590]
They told him, through the wall, that it had been staged, that no one real had died, and I felt my throat close around the truth. [616]
The dome held their ignorance gently, as if even mistaken comfort deserved a careful echo. [631]
I did not correct them; my role here was not to shout facts but to catalogue how people reached for one another when history failed. [656]
Still, later, I walked their words into the floor, tracing the boy's sentence with my heels until the stone remembered it better than they did. [681]
As the interregnum dragged on, rumors said the next ruler would close the gallery, afraid of any architecture that let ordinary voices travel too far. [706]
I decided that before that happened I would unbind my archive from paper, teaching the floor itself to remember by walking every story into its circumference. [732]
When the locks finally changed and the tourists stopped coming, the gallery kept whispering, a luminous absence filled with routes of words only my feet could have written. [760]</story>
