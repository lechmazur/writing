<story>After the last forest burns, the sky forgets how to be dark. [12]
Ash drifts for years, then sinks into sand that learns a slow, bioluminescent glow. [26]
They call this place the glowing dune in bloom, because nothing else remembers how to grow. [42]
I walk its ridges every night, a dreamless freight guard with no trains left to protect. [58]
The tracks are buried far below, but my boots still follow their straight, rusted memory. [73]
The company that hired me is gone, its depots consumed, its schedules curling like burnt leaves. [89]
Yet the clock in my chest keeps punching invisible tickets, refusing to learn that arrival is over. [106]
On my first patrol after the fires, I found the chess clock frozen at midnight, half-buried in warm sand. [125]
Both sides showed twelve, both flags caught mid-fall, as though two players had vanished in symmetrical shock. [142]
I took it as a sign that time here had agreed to hold still until someone learned new rules. [161]
So I wound the silent knobs every dusk, listening for a click that never came. [176]
Silence, I discovered, has its own schedule, printed not on paper but on wave functions. [191]
When the wind shifts just right, the dune shivers, and I see faint tracks of possibility bruising the air. [210]
Paths that were never walked flicker beside my footprints, then fold away like shy animals. [225]
The dune is an archive of all the journeys that might have been, a divergent archive written in shifting grains. [245]
Some nights those unchosen tracks grow nearly solid, and I feel other versions of myself pacing beside me. [263]
One hums a song under his breath, a fractured lullaby that tastes of smoke and distant engines. [280]
Another carries a lantern filled with dark, using its outline to measure how deep the night still is. [298]
They never look directly at me, but when I breathe in time with them, all our footsteps briefly align. [317]
For a moment I am occasionally everywhere, scattered along every line the rails could have taken. [333]
It is not comfort, but it is wider than loneliness, and that feels like a kind of charm. [351]
I was not paid to understand any of this, only to keep watch over what passes through. [368]
But the trains are gone, and now possibilities are my cargo, rattling invisibly in the cars of the wind. [387]
The dune blooms brighter each season, tiny sparks floating up from between the grains like seeds seeking gravity. [405]
I crouch and cup my hands around them, frightened they will burn out before choosing a direction. [422]
My motivation, if I can still call it that, is to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners. [440]
There are many corners here, despite the open sand: rusted signal towers, gutted cars, tunnels where tracks once dived underground. [460]
In each hidden place, I place the chess clock, one face turned inward, one face turned to the stars. [479]
The hands never move, but the sparks seem to linger, circling the frozen midnight as if testing its patience. [498]
I whisper arrival times to them, invented schedules for trains that will never roar across this buried earth. [516]
Each made-up route is a lullaby in pieces, soothing no one, but persisting, because stopping feels like erasing the dead. [536]
Sometimes a spark accepts the story, dives into the chess clock, and for an instant the flags twitch. [554]
Then a distant rail sings, not metal on metal, but possibility on silence, and fresh tracks scar the air beside me. [575]
When the echo fades, I cannot say what has changed, only that the dune seems to breathe easier. [593]
Maybe somewhere in the divergent archive, a forest does not burn, and a train arrives on time. [610]
Maybe in that branch, I am sleeping on duty, dreaming trees back into existence leaf by leaf. [627]
Here, though, I stay awake, because someone must witness the choices that never grow legs. [642]
Someone must count the sparks, name their almost-worlds, and tuck them gently under the dune's shifting skin. [659]
The chess clock waits in the center of it all, a heart that forgot how to beat but not why. [679]
I press my ear to its cold glass and hear, faintly, the oceanic tick of wave functions collapsing. [697]
Each collapse is a cradle snapping shut, a lullaby losing one more missing note. [711]
So I sing the gaps myself, off-key but steady, until the dune joins in, humming with unborn journeys. [729]
Whatever listens out beyond the ash must hear me through wave functions, not words, yet I sing anyway. [747]</story>
