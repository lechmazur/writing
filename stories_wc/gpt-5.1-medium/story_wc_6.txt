<story>Maris moved along the fire line like a dancer, gracefully alert to every crackle in the wind. [17]
The brushfire had broken out on the back side of the coastal dunes, where scrub met sea. [34]
Salt clung to the smoke, softening the smell that usually drove memories like nails into her. [50]
Today, the wind carried something different, a hush that hung between sky and water during the migration of clouds. [69]
It was the one season the captain let engine crews answer dune calls by foot instead of truck. [87]
Maris welcomed the walk, boots sinking into hot sand as if wading through years she preferred not to own. [106]
Ahead, where the dunes parted, the obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes waited like an unblinking eye in the earth. [125]
Local kids called it the Mirror, a place where the sky sank to rinse its tired colors. [142]
To Maris, it was something else: the site of her father's last blaze. [155]
He had chosen the old pier by this lagoon for his grand finale, wanting fire where the water could watch. [175]
Everyone in town still spoke of the flames leaping from tar-black planks, their reflection doubling the terror. [192]
Maris spoke of it too, but only to herself, mostly in the language of hose couplings and safety checks. [211]
Being a firefighter, the arsonist's daughter firefighter, felt like grafting new skin over old burns and daring it to hold. [231]
Still, she had promised herself that her life would not be a rejection of his, but a reply. [249]
Unyielding compassion, the chief called it, the quiet kind that refused to let a past crime define a present call. [269]
Now that call came thin and high over the dunes, a child shouting near the lagoon. [285]
Not panic, she thought, but urgency, like someone trying to keep a song from stopping. [300]
She crested the last dune and saw the fire, a ribbon of orange licking through the dry marram grass. [319]
But it was the boy standing at the water line that stopped her more than the flames. [336]
He was barefoot, trousers rolled, a jar cradled in his hands like something sacred. [350]
Inside the glass, black sand from the volcanic beach downshore shimmered, each grain catching light like a held breath. [369]
Beside him, the obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes lay mirror-still, kelp-drift peace curling in slow hieroglyphs along the shore. [388]
Behind him, the grass crackled, inching toward his skinny ankles. [398]
Maris ran the numbers in her head, water, distance, wind, a silent calculus she had learned in academy drills and childhood nights alike. [421]
She could reach him before the fire bridged, but only if she turned her back on the flame for a moment. [442]
Her father would have said fire loved distraction. [450]
Her chief would say the kid always came first. [459]
Maris moved, not choosing between them but carrying both voices like tools in the same hand. [475]
She shouted as she ran, telling the boy to stay still, to keep his eyes on her, not the flames. [495]
He listened, though he trembled, jar clinking as the black sand shifted. [507]
When she reached him, she set her body between boy and fire, feeling heat kiss the back of her neck. [527]
"What are you doing here, kid?" she asked, voice low and steady as the lagoon. [542]
His eyes, dark as wet pumice, flicked to the jar. [552]
"I came to give it back," he said. [560]
"My dad took this sand from here when he was little, before the volcano sleeps again." [576]
He says it cursed him with restless feet. [584]
"He keeps moving, never staying, never happy, so I thought maybe if I put it back, the curse would stop." [604]
The boy looked past her to the marching line of fire, no wider than a man yet greedy as a tide. [625]
It followed the wind, following the migration of clouds that smudged the sky overhead. [639]
Maris glanced at the lagoon, then at the jar, and an old understanding rose like a flare. [656]
She knew about fathers who believed in curses more than consequences. [667]
She knew about wanting to prove that scars can sing, not just scream. [680]
"Give me the jar," she said. [686]
He hesitated, fingers white around the glass, then surrendered it with a small, shuddering breath. [701]
From the pocket of her turnout coat, Maris took a foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread, the only thing of her father's the court had not burned. [730]
She looped the red thread around the jar's neck, graft of one story to another, then pressed it back into the boy's hands. [753]
"Return it together," she said. [758]
"You and your dad." [762]
Tell him curses break easier when you let someone else hold the jar for a while. [778]
Water crews arrived, hissing the flames flat, while Maris watched the boy and felt something quiet inside finally ease. [797]</story>
