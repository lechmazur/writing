<story>By the time Rhea found the forgotten library, the city had already erased its own name. [16]
She arrived at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze, that strange hour when echoes hesitate. [36]
The doors groaned open like reluctant witnesses, exhaling dust that glittered in the slanting light. [51]
Inside, the afternoon shadow caught in glass was waiting for her. [62]
It lay across the shattered mirrors lining the west wall, turning each shard into a thin, dark reservoir. [80]
Rhea closed the door gently with the heel of her hand, as though not to startle a sleeping animal. [99]
She had come because the city kept exiling its own memories, and someone needed to decide which banishments could be reversed. [120]
The Council called her the shard-mirror archivist, half in respect and half in accusation. [134]
Every decree of forgetfulness they passed, she recorded here among the splinters. [146]
Some memories were sentenced to permanent oblivion; others she consigned to reversible exile, suspended in the fractured reflections until the city was brave enough to want them back. [174]
She liked the reversible ones best, the ones that trusted time to change its mind. [189]
Rhea walked down the central aisle, her boots echoing between the tall, blind shelves. [203]
The nearer she drew to the mirror wall, the more her gut tightened; she walks backwards when nervous, so now each cautious step carried her away even as she tried to approach. [235]
The shadows in the shards seemed amused, stretching longer, folding over themselves like ink in water. [251]
On the low table before the mirrors waited a chipped porcelain cup and the slender brass spoon of her trade. [271]
Exile and return, guilt and grace, all of it Rhea weighed by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves. [289]
She brewed the bitter dusk-colored liquid now, steam coiling up to mingle with the dust motes and the trapped afternoon shadow. [310]
Today she had not come alone, though her companion hid behind the nearest stack, pretending to study an index of obsolete storms. [332]
Jun, small and wiry, wore defiance like a second spine, but their eyes were scared in the way of those who had run out of places to run. [360]
The Council had scheduled Jun for permanent forgetting after they shouted questions in the plaza that no one dared answer. [380]
Rhea had argued until her throat burned, her combative tenderness barbed with fury, and won a compromise that tasted of ash. [401]
Jun would be sent into the mirrors, into reversible exile, and Rhea would be allowed to mentor resilience quietly from the other side of the glass. [427]
The Council imagined this was punishment for them both; Rhea imagined differently. [439]
She called Jun out from hiding with a tilt of her head and poured the tea into the waiting cup. [459]
"Sit," she said, "though your knees will want to flee." [469]
Jun obeyed with theatrical reluctance, jaw set as if bracing for a blow rather than a reading. [486]
Rhea swirled the cup three times and overturned it on the saucer, listening to the soft, wet sigh as liquid abandoned porcelain. [508]
When she lifted the cup, the leaves clung to the sides in jagged constellations, tiny topographies of futures that might yet be negotiated. [531]
"You are angry," she said, tracing a crooked line that rose, broke, and rose again, "but you do not know whether to be angrier at them or at yourself for believing them." [563]
Jun snorted, which in their language meant agreement and contempt wrapped in the same breath. [578]
"You think changing our minds later makes this better," they said, a tremor sneaking into the edges of their voice, like a crack in enamel. [603]
Rhea touched the mirror nearest to her, feeling the cold nothing just beneath the surface, and for a moment her reflection failed to follow. [627]
"No," she answered, "I think changing our minds later is the only reason this might be survivable." [644]
"I cannot stop them from fearing you, but I can refuse to let their fear be final." [661]
Her voice was gentle and sharp at once, combative tenderness forged into a promise. [675]
She began to annotate the patterns of leaf and light on a long strip of vellum, each mark a narrow bridge laid across the gulf opening between Jun and the world. [706]
"These are the rules of going in," she said, "and the rules of coming back, and I will hold the exit open as long as my hands remember how." [735]
Jun watched her move, the ink on the vellum a series of stubborn horizons, and something inside their posture loosened by a fraction. [758]
"Fine," they said, "if we are doing this, then I want you to promise that forgetting me will hurt." [777]
Rhea smiled like a drawn blade and said, "That, at least, I guarantee." [790]</story>
