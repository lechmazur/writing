<story>The first time I stepped into the icebound atrium under starlight, the glass ribs of the ceiling rang like frozen bells. [21]
I was seventeen then, an heirloom seed saver carrying my grandfather's canvas satchel like a second heart. [38]
The world outside the dome had already forgotten how to grow anything that was not stamped, patented, or poured from a lab. [60]
Inside, beneath the rimed iron balconies, the last seeds that still remembered wildness slept in numbered drawers. [77]
I had come because the letter said the egg had finally cracked. [89]
They would only unlock the sealed cabinet after the egg hatches, the curator had written in a hand that trembled like thawing ice. [112]
Now the egg lay in a cradle of blue light at the center of the atrium, its shell parted along a spiral seam. [135]
From within, something breathed, slow and tidal, frosting the air with each exhale. [148]
The sound filled the dome with a wild serenity, like a storm humming itself to sleep. [164]
Beside the cradle waited Myra, the old curator, furiously tranquil, her hands folded so tightly the knuckles were bloodless. [183]
Around her neck hung an oak acorn cap threaded on tin wire, polished smooth by decades of anxious thumbs. [202]
She touched it once when she saw me, a gesture halfway between greeting and apology. [217]
Your grandfather saved this place, she said, voice brittle as hoarfrost, but it will be you who decides whether we reopen it. [239]
People come to me with seeds, I answered, not with eggs that breathe. [252]
This is a seed of another kind, she said, and what it hatches is our vortex inheritance. [269]
I had heard rumors in the seed-saver circles, spoken softly over envelopes of beans and corn that no catalog listed. [289]
They said the old families did not just keep seeds of plants, but seeds of time itself, spiraled tight like fern fiddleheads. [311]
You mean this thing will grow hours, or years? I asked, stepping closer until my breath fogged the cradle's glass. [331]
Not grow, Myra said, redistribute. [336]
Some will lose what others gain; that is the law of borrowed time. [349]
I came here to catalog and carry, not to meddle with laws, I said, though my fingers tingled with curiosity. [369]
Then why did you really come? Myra asked. [377]
Because the letter promised that if I witnessed the hatching, I might finally discover the texture of borrowed time, I admitted. [398]
She smiled, small and dangerous, like the first crack in river ice. [410]
Then feel it, she said, and pressed my palms flat against the glass. [423]
The thing inside the egg shuddered, and the air thickened, grainy, as if time itself had gone from water to sand. [444]
Memories that were not mine scraped past my skin: a boy feeding geese by a river that no map showed, a woman sewing seeds into her sleeves before a border crossing, a child laughing in an orchard of trees that had never been planted. [488]
Each memory spun around the next, pulling tighter, until my own life felt like the calm eye of a storm built from other people's yesterdays. [513]
This is the vortex, Myra whispered somewhere far away, the place where inheritances meet and decide what survives. [531]
If you accept it, the egg will choose a lineage for you, and you will keep our world from unraveling by decreasing entropy, however slightly. [556]
The phrase sounded like nonsense, but I could feel its shape in the drag of the air, in the way scattered dust motes drew together into faint, swirling columns. [585]
Myra unclasped the oak acorn cap from her neck and laid it on the cradle like an offering. [603]
It belonged to the first curator, she said, who planted the last sapling oak in this city, and who chose to spend fifty years of her own life so the tree could have fifty more. [638]
She gave that time to the vortex, and in return it remembered her; now the choice is yours. [656]
I thought of the envelopes stacked in my tiny apartment, seeds from forgotten fields, each packet a promise waiting for soil that might never exist again. [682]
If I walked away, the drawers here would stay locked, the egg would cool, and the last wild futures would rot into theory. [705]
So I steadied my breathing until it matched the tidal hush within the shell, until I was furiously tranquil too, and I whispered that I would pay in years, but only if the vortex let me feel each stolen day like a seed between my fingers. [751]
The egg answered with a rush of warmth that poured up through my arms and into my chest, threading strange memories into the lattice of my own. [778]
When I opened my eyes, I knew I would reopen the atrium. [790]</story>
