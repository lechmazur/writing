<story>The first time I saw the stars from the benthic city, they were only numbers on a ceiling screen. [19]
Yet even as numbers, they felt older and more honest than the lamps humming in the pressure domes. [37]
It was three years after humanity discovered the aliens beneath our ocean floor, and the world above had become a rumor. [58]
By then I had been reassigned from ship helmsman to navigation instructor for the abyssal academies carved into basalt. [77]
My students arrived with eyes widened by somber marvel, still half expecting the alien vaults outside the windows to blink. [97]
I wore my old boat anchor chain link on a cord around my neck, a speck of surface rust in this glassy abyss. [120]
They thought I wore it as a superstition, but truly it reminded me why I still wanted to learn to navigate by starlight. [143]
Charts here were mapped against thermal currents and alien beacons, yet my mind chased unfolded horizons no sonar could display. [163]
The aliens said my species was balancedly curious, torn between fear and wonder, and that this tension made our trajectories interesting. [184]
Their emissary, a ripple-bodied mathematician we called Mirror, attended my lectures from a water column at the back of the hall. [205]
Mirror insisted that if I wished to teach true navigation, I must first understand what they named edge geometry. [224]
On the first day of the new term, it pulsed the request across my slate, its symbols unfolding like tidal flowers. [245]
Meet me at the furthest viewport tonight, when the cities above your clouds turn their faces toward the stars, it wrote. [266]
I almost declined; after six shifts of instructing cadets to plot safe arcs through trench junctions, I wanted only sleep. [286]
But the chain link clinked softly against my ribs, and I remembered steering under naked sky, when risk still smelled of salt, not coolant. [310]
So I went. [313]
The furthest viewport was a blister of diamond glass grown from the city's flank, overlooking a plain of black manganese nodules. [334]
Beyond it, in the distance where our lights thinned, alien spires rose like frozen sound, each one humming a note below hearing. [356]
Mirror waited there, suspended in its column, skin shivering with equations that crawled like pale constellations over its surface. [375]
You chase unfolded horizons, it vibrated through the metal, but you are still drawing on flat paper. [392]
Show me, I said, if you think my paper can be taught to curve. [406]
Mirror dimmed the lights until the viewport went from window to mirror to faint reflection of another, higher sea. [425]
Above us, kilometers of water layered themselves into darkness, then into a film so thin my eyes insisted it was emptiness. [446]
Pinpricks emerged, trembling, as the city's sensors translated the occluded sky into wavelengths we could see. [462]
Those are your ancestral stars, Mirror said, and also their absences; edge geometry lives in the borders between what shines and what is eaten. [486]
Lines of faint gold appeared, connecting not the stars themselves but the invisible edges where their light faded into the void. [507]
It was as if someone had traced the outline of a missing continent on a blank map, letting absence expand into direction. [529]
Our ships rode currents along these gradients of starlight pressure, Mirror explained, long before your species carved hulls from trees. [549]
To move safely, you measure not distances but shifts at the edge, where one song becomes another. [566]
I watched the faint web of edges flicker, and something old in me ached, the memory of steering locked to a single pole star. [590]
Down here, there was no north, only gradients and harmonics, yet I felt my mind tilt, relearning which way was forward. [611]
I unclasped the chain link and held it against the glass, a tiny iron loop facing a cosmos it had never known. [633]
Once it had sunk from some forgotten ship into mud, a dead weight; now it framed a sliver of sky, anchoring nothing but my attention. [658]
Teach me to read these edges as I once read waves, I whispered, not sure whether I spoke to Mirror, the stars, or the rusted metal. [684]
Mirror flared a soft corona of light, the alien equivalent of a nod, and began sketching new constellations that wrapped around the city like unseen rigging. [710]
As the patterns grew more complex, I imagined future cadets standing where I stood, learning to steer not just through water but through the dark itself. [736]
Perhaps one day they would rise from this benthic city, follow the edges of absence into interstellar gulfs, and find other minds waiting at their horizons. [762]
Until then, beneath the crushing sea and the distant, invisible stars, I stood as a navigation instructor between worlds, quietly astonished that the universe still had room to expand. [791]</story>
