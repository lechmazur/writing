<story>The first time I met the locksmith, the sky was just beginning to bruise into twilight. [16]
He stood at the edge of the old viaduct, unassumingly bold in his threadbare coat, as though the concrete and rusted railings answered to him. [41]
People called him the Enigmatic Locksmith because no one knew where he slept, what he loved, or how he always appeared where something needed opening. [66]
That evening, the town around us smudged into shadows, and the river below spoke in little broken roars. [84]
He told me the viaduct was a hinge, a shadowed nexus under starlight, though no stars were visible yet. [103]
I laughed, which I regret now. [109]
You are here for a lock, he said, not for a joke. [121]
I almost turned away then, because I had not told anyone about the thing trapped in my mind. [139]
It was not a memory, and not exactly a dream, more like a bright, trembling idea that knocked whenever I tried to sleep, begging to get out. [166]
Whenever I looked at it inside, I felt only the rough wall of fear, cold as the river stones. [185]
The locksmith watched me the way a key might watch a door, as if he felt the resistance in my breathing. [206]
Show me what you brought, he said. [213]
I reached into the lining of my coat and took out the small glass vial. [228]
Inside it lay a single lock of hair tied with ribbon, the color of dried blood under moonlight. [246]
The hair had been my mother's, cut the night before she died, when she told me there are doors inside you that no one else can see. [273]
She pressed the hair into my palm, and with it, a terror of ever letting my own ideas step beyond safety. [294]
Years after, the vial grew heavier, as if every unfinished thought sank into that single curl. [310]
Now I had come to the viaduct because my head ached with the weight of things unsaid, and rumors of the locksmith moved through town like a quiet wind. [339]
He took the vial from me, holding it up so the last smear of daylight slid along the glass. [358]
In that pale light, the hair looked less like a keepsake and more like a vein torn from the dark. [378]
Everything you keep, he said, keeps you in return. [387]
His fingers, nicked and scarred, moved over the stopper with a care that felt almost reverent. [403]
What do you open, exactly, I asked, since I saw no doors here, only the rising dark and the river. [423]
He smiled without showing his teeth. [429]
I open what is locked, he answered, and not everything that is locked has hinges. [444]
The wind thickened around us, carrying the smell of rain from somewhere very far away, somewhere past the map. [463]
Above the western hills, the first star pushed through the bruised sky, sharp as a pin. [479]
The locksmith followed my gaze, and his eyes brightened, as though he had been waiting for that speck of light to speak. [501]
There, he murmured, the hint has been given by the first star seen at twilight. [516]
I waited for a riddle, a prophecy, some ancient phrase, but he only nodded toward the water below. [534]
It says begin, he explained, and nothing more. [542]
Improbable longing surged up in me, not for riches or love, but for the simple courage to let my own idea breathe. [564]
The locksmith uncorked the vial, and the air around us tilted, just enough to disorient my sense of where the ground ended and the sky began. [590]
For a heartbeat, we were nowhere in particular, only suspended across the hush of cosmic possibility. [606]
The star above flared, and the world rearranged itself around that one bright pin, as if space had inhaled. [625]
From the open vial rose no smoke, no ghost, only a pressure, like the soft unfurling of a thought that had been curled on itself for years. [652]
It brushed the back of my eyes and slipped behind my forehead, where the old fear waited like a clenched fist. [673]
I felt the fist, felt how long it had been holding on, how it had mistaken guarding me for imprisoning what I might become. [697]
The locksmith's hand rested, surprisingly light, on my shoulder. [706]
You came to free an idea trapped behind fear, he said, but understand that fear is not an enemy, only a door that grew over the threshold. [733]
If you hate it, the hinges will never turn. [742]
In the distance, the town clocks chimed without harmony, anchors of ordinary time, but here on the viaduct the minutes felt looser, as if they hoped to slip their own locks. [773]
I faced the pressure inside my skull and, very gently, thanked the fear for keeping the idea safe this long, then asked it to step aside. [799]</story>
