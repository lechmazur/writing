<story>The lunar observatory above the clouds looked less like a building than a lantern nailed to the raw dark of space. [21]
Inside, among caged lenses and trembling star maps, Ilias the sage camera repairer listened to the groan of shifting regolith beneath the pylons. [44]
It was the hour the engineers called when foundations shake, when the moon flexed and every bolt remembered the gravity it once denied. [67]
On the central console, the clock hand that won't stop spinning whirred in tight furious circles over a dial stripped of numbers. [89]
The observatory kept no official clock, only this scavenged relic Alma had wired into the tremor sensors, insisting that broken time noticed broken worlds. [113]
Long ago she had said, We are here to harness the ephemeral, or nothing justifies drilling steel into this silicate desert. [134]
Alma was three years dead, but her voice remained changelessly constant in the cavities of Ilias's mind, like the hum of dormant machinery. [157]
Outside the shielded dome, the sky was a slab of obsidian speckled with slow, disinterested fire, but the instruments saw differently. [178]
Somewhere beyond the reach of any hand, a star had shattered, smearing its death across their sensors in a wavefront only a second wide. [202]
A second, Alma had once said, is enough to change a universe, if you can catch it before it escapes. [222]
The data surge hit the observatory like weather, turning numeric streams into white glare, making the walls seem to bend inward with invisible tide. [246]
Alarms crawled up from the basement laboratories, one pitch after another, climbing toward panic. [260]
All the while the clock hand that won't stop spinning shrieked in its little glass cage, pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. [282]
Ilias steadied himself against the console, feeling the tremor in his knees echo the tremor in the stone two hundred meters below. [304]
He knew, with the tired precision that had made him the station's sage camera repairer, that the quake was not what mattered. [326]
What mattered was whether their machines could escape the noise long enough to see clearly, whether their understanding could reach escape velocity before the moment evaporated. [352]
The main imaging array had already slipped out of alignment, its mirrors trembling like teeth in an old jaw. [371]
Protocol said to lock everything down and ride out the motion, but protocol was for nights when the sky behaved like a patient animal. [395]
Tonight the sky was flinging away pieces of itself, and Ilias could almost feel them streak across the dome like invisible hot rain. [418]
He moved from console to console, overriding locks, forcing the array to track the dying star even as the floor rolled under his boots. [442]
If he let the computers decide, they would protect themselves, shutter their eyes, and the flare would pass by unrecorded, as if it had never been. [468]
To harness the ephemeral you had to risk breaking the tool that reached for it; Alma had taught him that with both tenderness and fury. [493]
He opened the housing of Camera Three, fingers working by memory, and began to restructure its circuitry while the observatory swayed around him. [516]
The automatic damping filters would smear the data into mush; he bypassed them, coaxing a raw, burning stream straight from the sensor into the core. [541]
He had learned to judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling, as the old saying went, though no leaves had ever touched this rock. [568]
Instead there were micrometeorites ticking against the hull, attenuators sighing, the faint crackle of static that told him when the system gasped for air. [592]
He listened now, eyes half closed, while the quake deepened and the foundations shook in earnest, deciding how far he could push without tearing something vital. [618]
Around him the rest of the staff clung to handrails, shouting protests that blurred into the general rumble, but no one tried to stop him. [643]
They trusted him grudgingly because his work was changelessly constant, because every camera that passed through his hands returned sharper, more patient, more willing to wait. [669]
The quake reached its crest, a long slow heave that made the star field outside lurch, and the spinning clock hand blurred into an unbroken circle of silver. [697]
For an instant Ilias thought of escape velocity again, not as math but as a promise: the speed required to leave behind whatever bound you. [722]
If they captured this stellar death cleanly, the observatory's work would survive any collapse of funding or politics; if they failed, they were only another crater. [748]
The instruments sang, lines of code racing across the displays like illuminated script, and somewhere in that luminous ache of numbers Alma's laugh seemed to surface. [774]
He held the configuration steady through the last aftershock, then let the safety systems close like eyelids, sealing their brief, stolen clarity inside the archive. [799]</story>
