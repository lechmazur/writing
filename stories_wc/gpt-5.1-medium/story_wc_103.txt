<story>I became a hedge maze designer because straight paths never told me enough about time. [15]
Now I tend a living bridge garden, where vines arch into trembling corridors above black water. [31]
Every morning the roots pulse like distant drums, and I walk beneath them in quaking reverie. [47]
I say I am pruning hedges, but truly I am trying to discover the texture of time. [64]
The garden answers with a single artifact: a halo fragment lodged in the oldest bridge trunk. [80]
It glows faintly, like a memory remembering itself, staining the leaves with slow revolving light. [95]
Beside it hangs a string of fading photographs, weather curled, their faces bleaching into sky colored ghosts. [112]
They show visitors crossing my bridges, smiling as if nothing could ever vanish beneath their feet. [128]
But when I touch each photograph, I feel myself retrocognitively trapped inside its captured afternoon. [143]
The wind freezes, the colors sharpen, and I become another version of myself, silently watching. [158]
The hedges there twist through hyperbolic geometry, expanding faster than I can walk, corridors branching into impossible flares. [176]
A step forward doubles the distance behind me, and guests laugh, thinking it is only illusion. [192]
Yet the maze remembers every footfall, storing them like rings inside the living bridges, year over year. [209]
Sometimes sap seeps out in prints shaped like lost shoes, then dries before anyone notices. [224]
Only the halo fragment sees and refuses to forget, its circle shattered yet endlessly recompleting in flickers. [241]
I found it years ago embedded in a root-knot, humming like a trapped throat, warm as fever. [258]
When I pressed it to my chest, the world buckled, and the bridges rose like startled serpents. [275]
Since then, time here has never moved only forward; it ricochets between moments as though uncertain. [291]
Visitors sense the shiver and shorten their tours, but I stay, listening for the pattern beneath. [307]
At dusk, when the sky bruises violet, I bring a lantern and lay the photographs in a ring. [325]
Each print contains a different past, yet the halo fragment stands in every frame, sometimes barely a blur. [343]
I realized then that the object is not mine; I am one of its recurring keepers. [359]
The knowledge shakes me, but the reverie is too deep to escape, trembling through bone and breath. [376]
Tonight I decide to attempt what the maze hints at: to step where time must disintegrate. [392]
I start on the youngest bridge, where tender shoots braid the handrails and dragonflies hang like punctuation. [409]
With each pace, the geometry sharpens, angles stretching, curves swallowing distance the way water swallows stones. [425]
I clutch the halo fragment, and my hands appear in multiple positions at once, smeared across perception. [442]
The photographs around me fade faster, their silver halides abandoning form, yet the scenes inside grow louder. [459]
I hear children who visited years apart speaking over one another, their laughter weaving chords of misplaced chronology. [477]
Time is not a line here but a trembling lattice, every moment touching many others through hyperbolic geometry. [495]
When I reach the middle span, the living bridge thickens, bark spiraling in golden logarithms around my ankles. [513]
The halo fragment pulses in synchrony, projecting ghost paths ahead, swift flickers of all the ways I once walked. [532]
I see myself as apprentice, measuring hedge shadows at noon; as lover, hiding letters inside hollow branches. [549]
I see future versions too, older and gaunter, pruning away bridges that never were yet still remember footprints. [567]
Every image quivers like a photograph beginning to burn, edges curling inward, emulsion blistering with invisible fire. [584]
I understand then that disintegration is not destruction but diffusion, the moment when boundaries become porous to neighboring whens. [603]
If I walk farther, I might dissolve into this lattice, a designer no longer separate from the maze. [621]
My heart drums a warning, yet reverie trembles louder, promising that within dissolution lies the texture I seek. [639]
I place the halo fragment on the bridge floor, and roots curl around it like cautious fingers. [656]
Light spills downward, not up, falling into the water, which refuses reflection and instead opens like a pupil. [674]
I step after it, feeling my outline fray, each cell remembering every place it has ever stood. [691]
The bridge, the garden, the photographs, and I disintegrate together, our histories smeared into one quaking reverie of time. [710]</story>
