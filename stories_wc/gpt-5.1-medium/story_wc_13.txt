<story>The day I first climbed to the rooftop canals, the city was holding its breath. [15]
I was a natural history illustrator, but my newest commission had nothing to do with birds. [31]
I had been hired to find the place where echoes are born. [43]
The only clue was an old infinity symbol pendant that hummed when I touched water. [58]
The rooftop canal system wove between the towers like silver veins, carrying rainwater and secrets across the dusk. [76]
Far below, the giant who slept beneath the city had just settled into his nightly nap. [92]
Everyone measured time by the rhythms of his breathing, by the rising and falling streets. [107]
My journey needed to begin and end across a giant's nap, or not at all. [122]
The client had been very clear about that, though not about who they actually were. [137]
Beside my sketchbook, the pendant swung from a loop of wire, tracing slow eights in the air. [154]
Its motion fell into a soothing pattern, then caught on some invisible snag, an endlessly interrupted cadence. [171]
Watching it, I realized it did not mark time; it sculpted time itself around me. [186]
When the metal grazed my skin, the world staggered, and the ripples in the canal slowed. [202]
I drew a breath that seemed to last an entire footstep of the giant below. [217]
So that was how I would search: by borrowing time from the pendant, one pause at a time. [235]
I stepped into a narrow gondola moored along the tiles, its hull scarred by old tides. [251]
A canal keeper waited there, his face lined like a weather map, his pole already in the water. [269]
You are late, illustrator, he said without greeting, though the giant has barely closed one eye. [285]
Echoes do not wait for ink to dry. [293]
I held up the pendant, and the faint hum joined the murmur of water against stone. [309]
He fell silent, watching its motion, his own breath unconsciously matching its stuttering arcs. [323]
You really mean to uncage it, he whispered, the first echo, the one that taught stones to answer. [341]
I mean to draw it, I said, though my voice faltered over the lie. [355]
He pushed us off without another word, and the gondola slipped into the lattice of canals. [371]
We glided past chimneys and rooftop gardens, between wash lines and rusted antennae, always following the hum. [388]
Sometimes the pendant cooled, and the city resumed its usual sway to the giant's breathing. [403]
Sometimes it flared hot, and every droplet in the air seemed hung on invisible threads. [418]
In those stretched instants, I sketched furiously, capturing the warped outlines of towers and clouds. [433]
Time draped around us like clay, and the pendant's interrupted cadence guided the canal keeper's hands. [449]
Turn on the offbeat, he muttered once; the currents are written in the spaces between. [464]
We reached a section of canal that narrowed between two leaning towers, their shadows locking like teeth. [481]
Here, the keeper said, planting his pole; beyond this, the city belongs more to sound than stone. [498]
He would go no farther, he explained, because too many who chased the first echo never returned. [515]
I stepped out onto the slick tiles, the canals now whispering with every shift of my weight. [532]
Here the pendant vibrated so hard I had to brace it with both hands. [546]
The air tasted like old bells, like thunder heard from underwater. [557]
I closed my eyes and let the hum crawl up my arms and into my chest. [573]
Then I borrowed time in earnest, twisting the pendant so the figure eight became a tightened knot. [590]
Sound peeled away from the city like paint, leaving bare silence that pulsed with distant, unborn voices. [607]
I saw them then, not with my eyes but with the habit of sketching, outlines of futures. [624]
Each echo began as a shimmer at the edge of a breath, a question not yet spoken. [641]
They gathered around me, tugging on my thoughts, trying on my memories as if they were masks. [658]
I understood then that to draw the birthplace of echoes would be to choose which ones survived. [675]
The pendant pulsed in my grip, sculpting time itself into narrow channels, forcing possibilities into single lines. [692]
I had spent my life rendering the fixed poses of beetles and bones; now the world begged for edits. [711]
I released my grip, letting the figure eight fall back into its interrupted cadence. [725]
Time loosened, and the unborn echoes scattered, free to find their own beginnings in other mouths. [741]
Instead of catching one, I sketched the absence, the moment where choice could not yet hear itself. [758]
The canals roared suddenly back into being, and the giant shifted in his sleep, streets heaving overhead. [775]
The keeper studied my empty hands, and I only said, I brought back drawings, not chains, and that is enough. [795]</story>
