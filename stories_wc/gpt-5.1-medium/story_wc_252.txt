<story>At the edge of the harbor, where pilings vanished into green twilight, Mara moved like water between the moored skiffs. [20]
Dock workers were supposed to be rough, but she was a graceful dock worker, each step measured as a tide. [40]
She had learned to carry crates with her hips and shoulders, letting the weight roll through her instead of bruising. [60]
After violence becomes impossible, people still try to hurt each other, Mara thought, they just use sharper words and softer hands. [81]
Her own words often came out barbed, yet her fingers brushed barnacled hulls as if apologizing for every scrape. [100]
That afternoon she met the pirate, though the old woman insisted the word no longer meant anything. [117]
I was a pirate when breaking a hull meant drowning a crew, the woman said, dropping a small bundle onto the pier. [139]
Now the worst I can do is overstay my welcome. [149]
Mara eyed the bundle, wrapped in sailcloth stained with old tar and something that looked too dark to be rust. [169]
What is it? [172]
A pirate's whalebone scrimshaw, carved before the world decided blood was inconvenient, the woman replied, voice like gravel under waves. [192]
She unwrapped it to reveal a length of yellowed bone etched with tiny ships, storms, and a single smooth island. [212]
The island on the scrimshaw seemed blank, yet the emptiness drew Mara's gaze more fiercely than any fine detail. [231]
It appeared to have been polished by the insistence of thumbs, as if generations had tried to rub something away. [251]
Why bring that here, Mara asked, when the harbor already drowns in old stories. [265]
Because it unlocks guarded hearts, the woman said, and because the island etched there is real, and it is disappearing. [285]
Mara laughed, a short harsh sound, but it softened at the edges, like surf breaking around a familiar rock. [304]
Islands do not vanish, she said, though she knew sandbars changed shape each season along the sublittoral fringe of the bay. [325]
Not the way you mean, anyway. [331]
Come back at low tide, the woman replied, and bring no one else; I want someone who still believes in strain. [352]
The word made Mara flinch, remembering nights when her muscles spasmed from moving cargo, when she had to detach her mind from pain. [375]
Yet strain had given her grace; each ache taught her that resistance could be a kind of rough affection. [394]
She returned at dusk, when the sea dragged purple light down into its throat and the pilings sweated cold. [413]
The old pirate waited in a skiff, the scrimshaw bone resting across her knees like a narrow altar. [431]
Get in, she said, we are going to the place your charts pretend is sand. [446]
Mara stepped aboard, the skiff nodding under her weight, and together they rowed toward the open throat of the bay. [466]
The harbor lamps shrank behind them, replaced by the breathing dark of the sublittoral fringe, where seaweed rose like drowned banners. [487]
Here the world thinned; no waves crashed, only lifted and settled, as if the ocean were trying not to wake anyone. [508]
How did violence end, Mara asked suddenly, because everyone tells that story as if it were merciful. [525]
The pirate snorted, dipping her oar just hard enough to splash Mara's knees, a gesture half rebuke, half teasing baptism. [545]
They put lattices in the sky to swallow every bullet, she said, and nets in the water to tangle every blade. [566]
They wrapped the world with rules until you could not strike without your own bones humming with pain, so no one tried. [588]
But a cage lined with cushions is still a cage, and some of us kept sharpness in other ways. [607]
You. [608]
Mara bristled, then let the words wash through her; softness did not erase her anger, but it shaped it. [627]
Ahead, a low shape surfaced from the water, not quite land, not quite sea, a smeared shadow on the tide. [647]
The disappearing island, the pirate murmured, as if naming an old lover she both resented and cherished. [664]
Each time the tide turns, it sinks; each time a certain sound rises, it returns. [679]
She lifted the scrimshaw and, with surprising gentleness, pressed it into Mara's hands. [692]
This is how you call it back, she said, by the call of a whale from the deep. [710]
You expect me to sing, Mara asked, because my throat has only ever known curses. [725]
Not singing, the pirate answered, pushing the skiff closer to the shadowed shore; listening. [739]
Hold the bone to your ear and remember every moment you refused yourself, every time you buried what you were. [759]
Mara pressed the cool whalebone against her skin, expecting silence, and instead felt the harbor rise inside her like a held breath. [781]
She knew her only wish, to find freedom in embracing one's true nature, was the whale's awaiting song. [799]</story>
