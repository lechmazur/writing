On the orchard planet of Virentia, where floating rock arches braided the sky above endless groves, a meek blacksmith named Corren kept his forge beneath a bowed tree heavy with cobalt pears. [32]
The pears glowed faintly at dusk, casting the workshop in a wash of azure defiance that made the anvils look less like tools and more like promises. [59]
Corren was quietly determined, though his shoulders curled inward as if apologizing for every strike of his hammer. [77]
He specialized in mending orchard tools and pruning hooks, yet lately the farmers brought him stranger commissions: shattered ladder rungs fused with stone, baskets stiffened into mineral husks, and branches that rang like iron when the wind passed through them. [117]
The planet itself seemed to be forgetting how to be soft. [128]
Scholars said the floating arches were sinking, losing height year by year, dragging unseen currents of gravity through the orchards and calcifying whatever they touched. [153]
Others whispered that the arches were waking up. [161]
Corren only knew that everything breakable was breaking, and that the people who lined up outside his forge wore the same hollow stare between understanding and confusion. [188]
They asked for repairs, but what they really wanted was reassurance that anything could still be made whole. [206]
He called the transactions bartered awakenings, because with each fixed tool he demanded not coin but a story of something the owners still hoped might grow here. [233]
A new graft of pear that tasted like rain, a child who dreamt of building wings from fallen archstones, a neighbor who had begun singing to stop her own hands from turning to slate. [267]
Corren listened, storing their hopes like hot coals in the quiet furnace of his chest. [282]
At night, when the pears dimmed and the arches glowed faintly overhead, he walked beyond the groves to the old mining district, where the ground gaped in a hundred abandoned mine shafts ringed by warning sigils. [318]
The miners had left when the stone began floating up instead of coming down, and no one claimed to understand what lay below anymore. [342]
Corren descended anyway, a lamp at his belt and a strip of magician's silk looped around his wrist like a tether. [363]
The silk had been payment from a traveling illusionist whose cracked crystal lenses Corren had reforged; she claimed it could remember shapes the world had given up on. [391]
Corren did not know if he believed her, but when he tied the silk to a splinter of archstone the cloth shivered toward the dark, tugging him to particular tunnels with the obedience of a divining rod. [428]
He began using abandoned mine shafts as arteries through the planet, moving beneath the orchards like a cautious ghost, mapping the way the arches pull ripples of force into the bedrock. [459]
Where the pressure peaked, stone fractured into weightless shards that hummed against his skin, as if waiting for someone to tell them what to be. [484]
He touched them with blackened fingers, thinking of ladders, baskets, branches, and of the people who carried those things home like brittle prayers. [507]
His motivation was simple: to coax resilience from rubble, to trade his own fear for some new way the world might bend without breaking. [531]
Deep underground, between the grinding logic of stone and the wild pull of the arches, he felt suspended between understanding and confusion, the same uneasy threshold he saw in the orchard folk above. [564]
One night, the silk yanked so hard it nearly pulled him off his feet, dragging his hand toward a collapsed gallery clogged with a tangle of roots and shattered support beams. [595]
At the center lay a heap of stone like any other, except that fragments of orchard ladders, pruning hooks, and even a child's toy windmill were fused through it, as if the mine had been eating the village's losses for years. [636]
The shards trembled under his touch, trying to rise but falling back, as though some instruction in them had been half erased. [658]
Corren laid the magician's silk over the pile, its surface flashing with ghost images of ladders intact, baskets woven, tiny hands spinning a windmill in real wind instead of stale mine air. [690]
He spoke to the stone the same way he spoke to cooling metal on his anvil, low and deliberate, promising it a future if it would only hold together a little differently. [722]
Around him, the mine creaked and the floating arches far above groaned in answer, their unseen lines of force knotting through his bones until he felt like a wire strung tight between earth and sky. [757]
Then the pile rose, not weightless but newly willing, reshaping itself under the guidance of the silk into a lattice of steps and rails, stone grown supple enough to flex without shattering. [789]
Corren climbed back toward the orchards, carrying that azure defiance. [799]
