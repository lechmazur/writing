<story>I was a bunker builder's claustrophobic child, unable to stand being underground for more than minutes. [16]
He said claustrophobia was a design flaw in his only child, an irony poured like concrete around us. [34]
So he let me spend my days on the xenial trellis above the clouds, where he never dared climb. [53]
The trellis had been a failed sky-farm, a lattice of rusted beams and glass ribs now hosting wind instead of crops. [74]
Yet it felt more welcoming than any kitchen table, each crossbar a hand held out to travelers drifting too high. [94]
On clear days, the bunkers far below were only rumors under the cotton of clouds. [109]
Up here, the air had its own gravity, a stretching contracted tone that made every breath feel like a question half answered. [131]
I came for that feeling, and for the silences that pooled between the beams like invisible dew. [148]
I had a purpose: to collect the flavors of different silences, the way other children collected stones or stickers. [167]
It started after the first time, when gravity inverts for an hour. [179]
The alarms had howled in the bunkers, but on the trellis everything simply let go and drifted upward, including me. [199]
My father screamed from a hatch below while I hung laughing above the clouds, my fear uprooted and shaking soil from its roots. [222]
When gravity settled back where it belonged, something new had sprouted in me, an intangibly tangible awareness of quiet. [241]
The silence during inversion tasted bright and metallic, as if every unspoken word had been gold leaf pressed against my tongue. [262]
Afterward, the world seemed coated in a thin gilded hush, shimmering around corners, hiding behind conversations, waiting to be noticed. [282]
I began to carry a tiny porcelain doll in my pocket, the last relic from the storefront above our first bunker. [303]
Its painted eyes were chipped, and a spiderweb crack ran from its collar to its cheek like a delicate fault line. [324]
When I pressed it to the metal of the trellis, its hollow body resonated, catching silences the way bottles catch wind. [345]
Different beams tasted different in my mind: the western strut carried a dusty quiet, like unopened books; the eastern spar, a wet, waiting hush. [369]
I learned the art of listening by limiting exposure, never staying too long in any one stillness, so none would numb me. [391]
Father called it escapism, but he could not understand that silence, like air, can suffocate if inhaled without measure. [410]
He came up once, helmet strapped on as if the sky were another bunker waiting to collapse. [427]
He found me stretched along a beam, the porcelain doll balanced on my forehead, listening to the small echo of my pulse. [449]
What are you doing, sprout? he asked, using the nickname that never fit, since my fear never let me dig deep. [470]
Collecting, I said, and the word rang oddly loud in the open air. [483]
He followed my gaze to the horizon, where storm clouds bruised the edge of the sky, their silence thick and clotted. [504]
You cannot collect nothing, he muttered, but his voice had already been swallowed by the gathering hush. [521]
When the next inversion hour approached, he surprised me by staying. [532]
We clipped ourselves to the trellis and waited as the world took a long, careful breath. [548]
Then gravity tilted, the bunkers below loosening their grip, and we rose like seeds in slow water. [565]
The porcelain doll slipped free, turning end over end between us, its arms wide as if accepting a delayed embrace. [585]
For a moment, my old claustrophobia flickered, imagining all that empty sky as a reversed bunker, an endless ceiling rushing up. [606]
But the silence around us bloomed, an orchard of unsounded thoughts, and fear had no soil here in which to root. [627]
I heard my father's breath hitch as the traffic grumble, the siren whine, even the whisper of dust against concrete fell away. [649]
This one, I murmured, is a heavy silence, like a room where apologies never arrived. [664]
He closed his eyes, and I watched his shoulders unclench as if bolts were unwinding inside him. [681]
Maybe, he said slowly, we were building bunkers to keep that kind of silence out, not just bombs and storms. [701]
Up here, I answered, you can let it in until it loses its edge; you learn its flavor, and it changes you instead of crushing you. [727]
We hung there together in that gilded hush, two bodies and one drifting doll, all of us briefly unbound from the math of fear. [751]
When the world finally remembered which way down was, we descended with new weight: a shared vocabulary of silences, sprouting quietly between us. [774]</story>
