<story>The first light never reached echo gorge directly; it slid in sideways, a shy secret spilled across stone. [18]
In the hush of a hidden sunrise, the shadows seemed to listen harder than the living ever could. [36]
Mara stood at the brink, modestly fearless, fingertips grazing the air as if testing the temperature of memory. [54]
To the villagers she was a myth, a lost soul collector who bartered silence and song for restless dreams. [73]
To herself she was only a woman who had once refused to let her brother die alone. [90]
The gorge muttered beneath her, a low throat of wind and water, rehearsing a language of unfinished goodbyes. [108]
From its depths drifted a thin melodic scraping, like laughter caught in a rusted wire fence. [124]
The sound came through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp, every warped chord trembling with trapped intent. [142]
The harp had been hammered into the cliff face generations ago, strings woven from riverweed and funeral thread. [160]
When the wind played it, the dead tried to speak, and their spectral confessions rose in bruised harmonies. [178]
Mara adjusted the leather thong around her neck, feeling for the small curve of the crocodile's tooth against her skin. [198]
It was river-polished, stolen long ago from a circus beast that had swallowed a drowning boy and given him back. [218]
The tooth reminded her that even jaws built for ending could be persuaded to open. [233]
Today she had come to echo gorge not merely to ferry another soul, but to pursue a different kind of rescue. [254]
The village children had stopped laughing, their games dissolving into watchful quiet whenever the wind picked up from the ravine. [274]
Parents whispered that the gorge was hoarding their joy, drinking it down with every nervous glance. [290]
Mara believed something stranger was happening, an imbalance in the music that braided the dead to the living. [308]
Her work had taught her that grief could sour into superstition, but it could also ferment into a rough, saving humor. [329]
She had promised herself, kneeling once beside her brother's fevered bed, to integrate laughter into healing wherever she walked. [348]
If the dead here had learned only to wail, then she would have to teach them how to remember the joke. [369]
She stepped onto the narrow path spiraling down, boots knocking pebbles into the listening dark. [384]
With each turn the harp-sound grew clearer, its crooked chords tilting between sobbing and mirth like a drunk acrobat. [403]
Faces began to tremble in the rock, pale as breath on glass, flickering out whenever she focused too hard. [422]
They were not yet ghosts, only intentions, the first drafts of haunting that the gorge was still revising. [440]
At the ledge where the harp jutted from stone, Mara stopped and let the wind arrange her hair into a simple crown. [462]
The strings shivered, and voices poured out, layered so tightly that sorrow and giggle were indistinguishable. [478]
Mara lifted the crocodile's tooth to her lips and bit it gently, a ritual to remember not to flinch. [497]
Then she spoke into the rising chord, her tone a luminous ache threaded with something almost playful. [514]
Come on, she told the unseen, I know you are there, and I know you miss being ridiculous. [532]
For a moment the wind faltered, and in that pocket of stillness one confession pushed free, thin as a reed. [552]
I stole my grandmother's dentures for a puppet show, a young boy's voice blurted, and she laughed so hard she died. [573]
Mara barked a laugh, not cruel, letting its echo ricochet, and the gorge seemed surprised by the sound. [591]
One by one, other spectral confessions followed, tripping over each other in a rush of awkward shame and yearning delight. [611]
A woman admitted she had faked her own haunting to keep suitors away, moaning under bedsheets until she believed herself a curse. [633]
An old fisherman recalled telling outrageous stories of river monsters, only to vanish downstream and become the legend he invented. [653]
As each story surfaced, Mara nudged it gently toward its absurd edge, coaxing memories of pratfalls, misheard vows, and botched seductions. [674]
The laughter that rose was warped and shaky, but it stitched itself through the music like gold mending a broken bowl. [695]
The harp's misaligned strings tightened with every chuckle, discord sliding slowly toward a rough, unlikely harmony. [711]
When Mara finally climbed back toward the rim, the sunrise had fully found the gorge, no longer hidden but gently veiled. [732]
Behind her the wind still played, carrying new giggles up the stone, and she felt the world tilt, just slightly, toward healing. [754]</story>
