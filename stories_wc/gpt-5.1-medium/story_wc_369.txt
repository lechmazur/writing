<story>On stormlit nights the tower sounded hollow, like a seashell held too long against the ear. [16]
Milo, senior labyrinth maintenance worker, preferred those nights, because the cracks in reality were easier to spot. [33]
Water bled through the stone joints, lightning mapped the sky, and every leaking echo told him where the maze was tired. [54]
His job description mentioned none of that, only sweeping corridors, oiling hinges, and logging structural anomalies in a smudged ledger. [74]
But the maze had opinions, and Milo had made a habit of listening between the drips and drafts. [92]
Tonight the storm sat low and sulking, slapping the tower windows with sheets of rain brightened by moonlight. [110]
He was down in Corridor Theta, brushing gravel from the tiles, when the entire labyrinth inhaled. [126]
Every sound dropped away, even the storm; he could hear his own pulse and the wet tick of condensation. [145]
Then somewhere down the corridor, impossibly loud in that silenced breath, a single pin struck stone. [161]
Later he would swear his real life diverged right there, at the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor. [182]
He followed the sound and found, lying perfectly centered on a damp flagstone, the astronomer's broken sextant. [199]
He recognized it from the tower museum upstairs, where it sat in a dusty case labelled INSTRUMENTS RETIRED FROM REASON. [219]
According to the placard, the sextant had once measured comet tails until it started returning values labeled sorrow instead of degrees. [240]
The astronomer called it quantified sorrow, and the council politely retired both his device and his stipend. [257]
Milo knelt, thumb running over the cracked arc where numbers blurred into hair-thin scratches like tangled constellations. [274]
The metal was cold, but underneath was a faint heat, as if it remembered hugging starlight. [290]
He should have logged it as lost property and returned to sweeping, yet the maze seemed to hold its breath again. [311]
Rain hammered the distant tower glass in steady code, and Milo suddenly understood the sextant was not broken but waiting. [331]
He took it with him up the hidden service stair, climbing toward the stormlit tower by moonlight. [348]
The tower housed the observatory, the archives, and a rooftop garden of potted trees nobody officially acknowledged. [365]
Milo had discovered the trees during a leak inspection and kept returning, drawn by the way their leaves shivered before distant thunder. [387]
He watered them from the cleaning cisterns and talked to them more than he talked to people. [404]
It had started as a joke, wondering what trees witness when they stand so long, patient and rooted. [422]
Over years, that wondering hardened into his only real wish: to discover what trees witness and carry silently. [440]
On the roof, wind tore at his coat and flung spray from some unseen overflow, but the moon hung clear between veils of cloud. [464]
Milo set the sextant on a stone ledge among the pots, where moonlight pooled like spilt milk. [481]
Slowly, the twisted limb of brass straightened, the cracked glass mended, and the instrument seemed to heal in moonlight. [500]
It was not dramatic, more like a tired joint easing after rain, an everyday mercy the world sometimes remembers to provide. [521]
Milo understood then that the sextant measured not only celestial sorrow but whatever long attention soaked into a thing. [540]
Trees, with their rings of bad years and good, must be dense with such quantified sorrow, layered and legible. [559]
He lifted the revived sextant, sighted along its frame, and pointed it not at the stars but at the nearest sapling. [580]
The dials spun, stopped, and rearranged themselves into a diagram of tiny rooms connected by hairline corridors. [597]
He saw, hovering in the brass like an afterimage, a labyrinthal cross section of seasons: budding, burning, leaf-fall, frost. [616]
Every turn in that tiny maze corresponded to some long-ago moment when the tree had watched a human pass beneath. [636]
To read it properly, he realized, he would need to deconstruct the labyrinth of memories, node by patient node. [655]
The sextant provided a method; it began mapping scattered dreams, catching loose impressions from the storm, the trees, and his own mind. [677]
Each mapped dream clicked into the diagram like a tile returned to its proper corridor downstairs. [693]
He saw a child lost and found, a woman leaving in snow, a man laying his palm against bark before execution day. [715]
The sorrow the sextant tallied was not tragic so much as cumulative, the way dust gathers until someone finally wipes a shelf. [737]
By dawn the storm had wandered off, leaving the rooftop washed and humming, and Milo sat among the trees, ledger open on his knees. [761]
In neat columns he recorded what the trees had witnessed and how the sorrow measured there bent quietly toward forgiveness. [781]</story>
