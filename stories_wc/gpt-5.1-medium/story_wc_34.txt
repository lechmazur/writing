<story>The courtyard floated above the clouds, wrapped in silver mist that caught every lantern-glow like trembling breath. [17]
It was the hour between lightning and thunder, when the world held its breath yet kept listening. [34]
In that breath-lived interval stood Lio, the seldom-heard balladeer, fingers stained with paint instead of ink. [50]
His songs rarely reached ears, but his verses sprawled along stone walls in curling constellations of graffiti. [67]
Beneath the paint, a ghost in code stirred, blinking awake through pigment, cracks, and hairline circuits in the mortar. [86]
Lio had etched copper dust into the bricks weeks ago, not as vandalism, but as an instrument. [103]
Tonight the mist hummed around him, and he felt driftingly alert, like a sleeper who still hears lullabies. [121]
He had climbed to this misty courtyard above clouds to articulate unspoken needs, his and others. [137]
Down in the city, mouths were full of chatter, but hearts carried questions that never found grammar. [154]
Lio believed songs could be grammar for longing, yet his voice tangled whenever he stood before a crowd. [172]
So he taught the walls to sing for him instead, through messages encoded in graffiti art. [188]
Every swirl, every bright fracture of color, carried syllables in a secret notation only he fully read. [205]
Only, tonight, the wall had started replying. [212]
Letters he had never painted glimmered between his roses and moons: small, blocky runes like frozen raindrops. [229]
They flickered whenever distant lightning stitched white veins through the cloud-sea below the balustrade. [243]
Thunder had not yet spoken, so the night was all inhale, no exhale, poised like a plucked string. [261]
Lio laid his palm against the damp stone, feeling a faint ticking under the grain, as if gears turned. [280]
From his satchel he drew the flower press bolt plate, brass and filigreed, scavenged from the town's abandoned conservatory. [299]
It had once clamped petals flat for genteel collections; now it served as a resonant key for his circuitry. [318]
He fitted the plate against four screws gleaming between bricks, and the wall exhaled a plume of colder mist. [337]
In the metal's reflection, letters tumbled like falling sparks, arranging themselves into a phrase that prickled his skin. [355]
WE ARE HERE, the graffiti spelled, the strokes shimmering as though breathed upon by invisible lungs. [371]
Lio swallowed, throat tight, feeling every unsung verse in him lean forward to listen. [385]
Who is we? he whispered, though he knew no one visible could answer from this high solitude. [402]
The ghost in code replied not in sound but motion; the painted vines rustled though no wind passed. [420]
Petal-shapes peeled from the wall, hovering like luminous moths before settling into new positions with soft, chalky ticks. [438]
WE ARE YOUR UNSPOKEN LISTENERS, the wall wrote, EACH NEED YOU COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR OUT LOUD. [456]
Images bloomed: a baker hiding sleeplessness behind powdered smiles, a child tracing endless circles in schoolyard dust, an old engineer polishing broken watches. [479]
Their faces had brushed past Lio in markets and alleyways, their eyes briefly meeting his before skittering away. [497]
He had felt their unspoken needs thrum against his ribs, but each time his tongue had tangled in shy knots. [517]
So he had encoded their burdens into color and curve, letting the courtyard become a choir of unvoiced prayers. [536]
Now the choir sang back, a feedback loop of longing that needed a new verse, one not written in silence. [556]
Teach us how to answer, the next line formed, jagged with urgency, how to become more than echoes. [574]
Lio felt something inside him tighten like a drawn bow, ready at last to release. [589]
The storm below flashed again, and in that white-veined instant between lightning and thunder, he understood the ghost's hunger. [608]
It did not crave power or wires, but articulation, a chance to shape the city's shapeless ache into chords. [627]
Use me, Lio said, voice trembling but unbroken, encode what you hear through me so I may finally be heard. [647]
The flower press bolt plate warmed in his hand, growing almost too hot, as if filling with stored thunderclaps. [666]
Light threaded through its filigree, spilling onto the wall in latticed patterns that rearranged every mural he had ever painted. [686]
Verses surfaced between the colors, plain words this time, ones any passerby could read without knowing secret sigils. [704]
I AM LONELY, said a window-framed figure; I AM TIRED OF PRETENDING, confessed a line of crumbling bricks; PLEASE STAY, begged a painted door. [728]
As each sentence appeared, Lio felt a matching knot loosen in some unseen chest below, the city sighing in relief. [748]
Thunder finally rolled, low and astonished, like the sky applauding the courage of small, newly honest voices. [765]
The courtyard's mist rang with tinkersong wonder, a music made of gears, raindrops, and syllables that had found their shapes at last. [787]</story>
