<story>The counter clockwise clock maker arrived at the mysterious lighthouse on the rocky island at dusk. [16]
The boatsman refused to land closer than the kelp line, muttering that the beacon turned souls backwards. [33]
That suited Aurek; he had spent his life walking against the current of clocks and men alike. [50]
He stepped onto the slick stones under the slow exhale of low tide, feeling the sea withdraw like a held breath. [71]
Each retreating wave exposed more of the island's ribs, basalt shining with a faint, latent radiance of trapped daylight. [90]
He had come for the hunger stone buried in those ribs, the one sailors said whispered worse futures. [108]
The stone, they said, woke only when the world forgot how close it had come to starving. [125]
Aurek believed it was older than famine, older than time as clocks pretended to measure it. [141]
His own clocks ticked counter to the sun, their hands unwinding days into something raw and undecided. [158]
Buyers called them unsettling, but people whose lives had already shattered trusted him to count what still might be. [177]
It was for them, and for the tired ache in his own marrow, that he hoped to step beyond fate's design. [198]
The lighthouse loomed above him, no keeper at its railing, its lamp dark despite the approaching stormfront. [215]
Aurek had studied the sketches salvaged from its drowned builder, pages warped with salt and strange geometry. [232]
The plans hinted that the lighthouse was not meant to warn ships from rocks, but to measure the hunger of the world. [254]
Somewhere in its foundation, the hunger stone anchored a mechanism that turned agony into foresight. [269]
If he could find it, if he could tune it, he might learn where sorrow began and step around it. [289]
The entrance door resisted until he turned its knob backward, counter clockwise, hearing bolts withdraw with a reluctant sigh. [308]
Dust lay thick inside, but the brasswork gleamed as if polished by unseen, neatly inventive hands. [324]
Aurek traced the curved stair, noting the stair risers were numbered from the top down, as though descent were ascent. [344]
On the first landing he found the yoyo. [352]
It lay in the hollow of a windowsill, its string fossilized with salt, its body carved from some dull stone. [372]
He recognized the sigils etched into its halves: the same that marked the margins of the builder's sketches. [390]
To initiate the tower's heart, the notes had said, one must understand the falling that returns. [406]
That was why Aurek, more watchmaker than mystic, had been summoned by the gossip of drowned sailors. [423]
He turned the yoyo in his fingers, sensing tiny shifts within, as if sand moved through hidden glass. [441]
The puzzle was too precise to be magic; it begged to be solved through reverse-engineering the puzzle of an ancient yoyo. [462]
He dissected it with the same patience he had given his first backward clock, prying carefully at hairline seams. [481]
The shell parted to reveal nested weights and springs, all arranged to hoard momentum instead of release it. [499]
Not a toy, he thought, but a portable well, designed to drink the energy of each fall and never truly relinquish it. [521]
The core was a shard of something like glass, yet darker than seawater at midnight, humming with latent radiance. [540]
When he touched it, the air inside the lighthouse thickened, and the distant surf began to sound disturbingly like breathing. [560]
Aurek reassembled the yoyo with the shard rotated, so that the captured force would spill instead of pool. [578]
Then he descended toward the base, following a draft that smelt faintly of rust, brine, and old prayers. [596]
The stair ended in a round chamber whose floor was split by a jagged crack leading directly into the sea. [616]
There, unveiled by the receding tide, the hunger stone jutted from the earth like a molar in a rotting jaw. [636]
Words were cut into its face in dozens of languages, all saying variations of the same thing: "If you see me, despair." [658]
Aurek felt something yield inside him, some thin seam between fear and resolve. [671]
He had despaired long enough; despair was only a clock that never changed its hands. [686]
He knelt, fitting the yoyo into a shallow cup carved at the top of the stone, where a rounded nub waited. [707]
The device settled with a click that resonated up through his teeth, like the first tick of a new clock. [727]
The sea did not pause, yet the room felt held between seconds, as if time itself were listening. [745]
Aurek cast the yoyo over the crack, letting it fall toward the breathing dark below. [760]
The string screamed against the stone as it unspooled, then tugged tight, the yoyo spinning unseen in the void. [779]
Bleak exhilaration flooded him as the lighthouse trembled, answering with a future still unwritten. [793]</story>
