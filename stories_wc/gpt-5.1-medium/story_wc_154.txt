<story>The mist-clad atrium at twilight smelled like iodine, wet stone, and the sour breath of fear. [16]
I waited beside the gurney, my badge reading pacific conflict-zone translator, though lately that meant reluctant confessor. [33]
The boy on the gurney watched the ceiling, one arm in a plaster cast crowded with smudged signatures. [51]
The anesthetic had already kicked in, leaving his pupils huge and his questions floating just beneath his tongue. [69]
My name is Mara, and I was there to unknot words, not sutures, yet both kept tearing open. [87]
Outside, mortars thumped somewhere inland, a distant percussion that shook dust from the greenhouse glass above us. [104]
Inside, the atrium plants sweated a jungle hush, trapped in their pots like civilians in disputed borders. [121]
On the metal tray beside the boy lay a brain coral fragment, pale and ridged like folded maps. [139]
A diver had found it lodged in his thigh after the blast at the harbor checkpoint, coral turned shrapnel by politics. [160]
The surgeons wanted it as evidence; the boy wanted it as proof he had once swum somewhere unbroken. [178]
Translate for him, the anesthesiologist said, her voice clipped, already half behind her mask. [192]
Tell him about the consent form, the risks, the part where he might wake up less himself. [209]
But his mother had already signed, inked exhaustion trembling in each curve of her name. [224]
What he needed translated were not clauses, but the shared anxieties layered between our languages like sedimentary scars. [242]
He blinked slowly and asked, in the creole of the northern atolls, Will they put the sea back inside me? [262]
The anesthetic made his voice floaty, shrewdly innocent, like he knew the answer and needed me to confess it. [281]
I said, They will take out the foreign thing and leave the rest of you alone. [297]
He squinted, considering this imperfect symmetry, then lifted his casted arm with obvious effort. [311]
The cast was filthy now, plaster grayed by the camp dust, its drawings and messages smeared into ghost-letters. [329]
He tapped it against the rail, a hollow knock, and whispered, Can you read them before they cut me? [348]
The surgeon muttered about time, but I nodded, because this was the only consent that mattered to him. [366]
I leaned close and began decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast, my tongue tripping over faded ink. [384]
Some were simple: a brothers crude shark, a neighbors joke about becoming metal-legged, a heart surrounding his mothers initials. [403]
Others were half lost, letters dragged by sweat or rain until they resembled tide lines instead of words. [421]
He watched my mouth as I reconstructed them, syllables backlit by operating lamps, turning plaster into a fragile scripture. [440]
Every message I translated was small, almost silly, yet together they formed a nervous chorus around his silence. [458]
I realized we were both listening for the same thing: proof that our fear meant we were still human. [477]
My job was supposed to be neutral, but every word was a graft, new meaning stitched onto our old wounds. [497]
The boy frowned when I read a line I could not quite parse, the letters reduced to muddy blooms. [516]
Maybe it was a name, maybe a prayer, maybe just someone pressing the pen down too hard to say goodbye. [536]
So I said, This one says the sea will remember you, and if it forgets, we will remind it. [555]
It was a lie, but it was a careful lie, a lotus-hearted ache blooming in a place built for triage. [575]
He smiled lopsidedly, lips numb, and whispered, Then tell the sea I did not mean to bleed in it. [594]
His mother made a choked sound, something between a laugh and a sob, and gripped the brain coral fragment. [613]
It looked obscene in her hand, like she was holding the extracted thought of the island itself. [630]
She pressed it into my palm without meeting my eyes, as if deputizing me to remember what surgery would remove. [650]
Its cold weight surprised me; the ridges fit strangely against my lifeline, as though tracing a map of futures cancelled. [670]
In that moment I imagined stitching it back into the boy, not as shrapnel, but as an anchor for another story. [691]
A story where coral grew around his wound, translating pain into reef, turning every tide into a whispered apology. [710]
Instead I slipped the fragment into my pocket, nodded to the team, and followed them as they rolled him toward the operating doors. [733]
His eyes had finally closed, lashes trembling, yet his fingers still curled instinctively around the air where the cast had been. [754]
As the doors swung shut, the misted glass reflected my own face back at me, blurred but undeniably afraid. [773]
Out in the atrium, between the hanging orchids and the hospital generators, our shared anxieties drifted like unclaimed translations waiting for a tongue. [796]</story>
