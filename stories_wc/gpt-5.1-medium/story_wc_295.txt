<story>I arrived at the celestial mapping observatory just before the clocks surrendered to midnight. [14]
Above the domed roof, the sky looked less like darkness and more like a vast black page waiting for someone to write on it. [38]
I had come because the dreams would not leave me alone. [49]
For months, my sleep had filled with a ruined temple standing under unfamiliar constellations, its inscriptions shimmering like breath on glass. [70]
By day I was a lucid dream chronicler for the Institute, paid to map the cartography of other peoples nightmares and revelations. [92]
By night, my own dreams had begun to outvote my waking life. [104]
I carried their evidence in my coat pocket, a daylily-pressed telegram that should not, by any reasonable measure, exist. [123]
The paper smelled faintly of summer and train smoke, though the sender claimed to write from several centuries ago. [142]
His name was Brother Kephra, guardian of the temple in my dreams, and his message had been simple: Come witness what we could not understand. [167]
The Institute director had laughed my report out of his office until he saw the pressed flower and the date stamped in ink that predated the telegram itself by fifty years. [198]
Then he sent me here, to the highest observatory in the range, with orders to correlate my dreams with the night sky. [220]
He suspected I was fabricating a case to justify more funding; I suspected the universe was trying, clumsily, to dictate a letter. [242]
When I entered the dome, the only other person inside was the starguard on duty, a woman wrapped in a shawl the color of first light. [268]
Her name tag read ARIA, and beside it, in smaller letters, Counselor. [280]
You are late, she said, not unkindly, adjusting the telescope that pointed through the opened slit of the dome. [299]
The stars do not wait for anyone, not even dreamers. [309]
Dream chroniclers, I corrected, because job titles were the thin armor I wore against the unsteady ground of my own mind. [330]
She smiled as if that difference mattered to her. [339]
Here your dreams are the data, she said, and I am not only the starguard; I am the one who listens when they hurt you. [364]
You heal with words, I guessed, noting the soft rasp of her voice, worn by long nights of receiving other peoples confessions. [386]
It is the only medicine they trust up here, she replied. [397]
What did the Institute tell you about your assignment. [406]
That I am to decode temple inscriptions that do not officially exist, by mapping them to the sky you keep watch over, I said. [430]
And that, if I fail, this observatory will lose the budget line that pays for your extra blankets and coffee. [450]
Then let us not fail, Aria murmured, because I have grown fond of both blankets and coffee. [467]
She dimmed the lamps until the dome was a hollow of midnight solace, the faint red emergency bulbs glowing like coals at the edges of vision. [493]
Then she rotated the telescope, not toward any famous nebula, but toward a patch of sky pulsing with subtle flickers. [513]
Variable stars, she explained, their brightness rising and falling with patient insistence, like breathing written in light. [530]
Your Brother Kephra wrote that the temple ceiling mimics a field of changing stars; if your dreams are accurate, we should find the same pattern here. [556]
Through variable stars, then, we would read a language older than the stones that carried it. [572]
I unfolded the daylily-pressed telegram on the narrow desk and copied the temple inscriptions from my notebook, the curling lines and intersecting circles I had traced upon waking for weeks. [602]
Aria overlaid a transparent star chart on top, her fingers deft as if arranging bandages over a wound. [620]
As we matched symbols to flickers, the pattern emerged: a series of repeating coordinates, each corresponding to a recorded catastrophe in the Institutes archives. [644]
Floods, plagues, lost expeditions, the day an entire city woke speaking a language no one could remember by dusk. [663]
The temple had not been a place of worship alone; it had been a ledger of burdens carried across centuries, each disaster etched into stone, each stone matched to a star. [694]
Someone had believed that suffering, if recorded with enough precision in heaven and earth both, might one day be balanced, perhaps even lessened. [717]
Shared burdens, I murmured, tracing a line between a star and a scratched symbol that translated, roughly, to We carried this so you would not have to. [744]
Or so you would not have to carry it alone, Aria corrected gently. [757]
Her hand rested on the edge of the desk near mine, close enough that I could feel the faint tremor of fatigue and something like grief. [783]
In that quiet hour, when understanding dawns without sunrise, I finally witnessed my own healing. [798]</story>
