<story>The first time Mara broke her chains, she did it to stay chained. [13]
Freedom, she had learned, was only useful if you could aim it. [25]
Tonight, in the abandoned carnival prize redemption center, her ankles gleamed with new shackles that matched the dust. [43]
The place still smelled faintly of popcorn oil and cheap plastic, of stuffed bears that had never been won. [62]
Above her, prize shelves sagged with mildewed boxes and sun-faded posters promising victory nobody needed anymore. [78]
The carnival had died when the wall went up; tonight, when the wall comes down, something else might live. [97]
Mara listened to the distant thunder of detonations, each dull bloom of sound a countdown she had no clock for. [117]
They would breach the barrier before dawn, the insurgents and the soldiers together, cracking the city like an egg. [136]
Most people just wanted out; Mara wanted roots. [144]
She was the chained liberator because she had asked for the cuffs, insisted on them, bargained her wrists for time. [164]
The Overseer believed she had defected from the underground, and his ego needed visible proof of ownership. [181]
In exchange, he kept her close to the vault he did not know he was guarding. [197]
The clandestine seed vault lay buried beneath the prize counter, disguised in the city's registries as a forgotten storage sump. [217]
Before the famines, when soil still held memories of rain, people had lined up here for stuffed tigers and neon whistles. [238]
Now, they would line up for seeds, if anyone survived long enough to learn they were here. [255]
Mara's motive was simple and impossibly large: to plant resilience in dry soil, to coax stubborn green from exhausted dust. [275]
The cuffs on her ankles were welded to a bolted stool, but her hands were free, and her mind was patiently strategic. [297]
She watched the Overseer pace between dusty claw machines, his boots scattering ticket stubs like molted scales. [314]
Over his shoulder, mounted high on a warped pegboard, hung the arrow with strange fletching that had once been the grand prize. [336]
Its feathers were not feathers at all but lacquered slivers of circuit board, emerald and gold, humming faintly when the lights flickered. [358]
Children had saved thousands of tickets for it, not knowing it pointed to something other than a heroic fantasy. [377]
Mara knew better; the arrow was a key, and the key was a song. [391]
Beneath the prize counter, half-swallowed by shadows, squatted an old upright piano whose veneer had peeled like sunburned skin. [410]
Its bench was locked, of course, and the Overseer wore the key around his neck, a trinket between government badges. [430]
He believed it hid contraband instruments from the old musicians who had scored the carnivals, nothing more dangerous than nostalgia. [450]
But there was another key, one nobody living knew: by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench. [470]
Mara had seen the diagrams etched into the arrow's circuit fletching years ago, before they had taken her. [488]
Lines of copper traced the pattern of broken piano keys like constellations, mapping which ones must be removed, which left to sing. [510]
If arranged correctly inside the bench, they would complete a hidden circuit that powered the vault door deep below. [529]
If arranged incorrectly, they would ignite the charges wired to the surrounding foundations, collapsing the building and burying the seeds forever. [550]
The Overseer intended exactly that, once he had cataloged the vault for his superiors, ensuring nothing useful survived the coming breach. [571]
Mara's task was to impede him without revealing the vault's true purpose or her own. [586]
When he finally tired of pacing and summoned two guards to haul the piano forward, Mara bowed her head as if defeated. [608]
The stool scraped, chain-links rasping like reluctant applause, and she timed the drag of her feet to study his movements. [628]
He leaned over to unlock the bench, the lanyard of keys swinging; in that pendulum arc, Mara counted. [646]
Every revolution matched the muffled booms beyond the wall, the city's heartbeat stumbling toward its own collapse. [663]
On the third swing she coughed, a wet, practiced convulsion that sent her forward just enough to clip his wrist with the chain. [686]
The keys spilled into the open bench like dull teeth, some clattering down between warped piano strings. [703]
He cursed, shoving her back, but she had already seen which key his hand had favored, which notch shone with new wear. [725]
He scooped the keys into the bench, muttering that she would wait while he decoded whatever idiot sabotages the technicians had left. [747]
He never suspected that she decoded him, instead: the sequence of his choices, the hierarchy of his fears. [765]
By the time he had aligned the first row of keys according to his own logic, Mara understood how to mislead it. [787]
She spoke softly, guiding his hands away from ruin with staggering grace. [799]</story>
