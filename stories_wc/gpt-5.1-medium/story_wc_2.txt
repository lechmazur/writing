<story>The first time Eli heard the subterranean waterfall, he thought the clocks were finally grieving. [15]
Their brass mouths gaped on the shelves of his workshop, stopped hands pointing nowhere and everywhere at once. [33]
Eli was a broken-clock tinkerer, more accustomed to listening than repairing. [44]
He lived alone in the abandoned rail depot above the city, where tracks ended in darkness and rumors. [62]
The waterfall, he discovered, did not run beneath the depot but through it. [75]
At night a faint hiss rose from the floorboards, as if the building were remembering rain. [91]
Eli followed the sound the same evening his last working clock fell silent at 11:11. [106]
Coincidence, he told himself, though he had reached the age when coincidence becomes pattern. [120]
Floorboards lifted easily for a man who had spent decades prying open stubborn casings. [134]
Beneath the ashes of old coal dust and forgotten tickets, he found a trapdoor framed in rusted iron. [152]
The hiss became a roar when he pulled it open, cold breath rising from the depths below. [169]
Eli descended a narrow staircase, lantern swinging, clocks ticking faintly in his memory like distant gulls. [185]
The stairs ended in a cavern carved by water and time, where the subterranean waterfall shone like a vertical river of glass. [207]
Veils of spray hung in the air, catching the lanternlight and scattering it into trembling echoes. [223]
Along the rock walls, metal shelves jutted like ribs, cluttered with instruments whose purposes he could not name. [241]
Nautical charts curled in damp rolls, their ink running like rivers seeking new courses. [255]
In the center of the cavern, on a stone pedestal crusted with mineral salt, lay a brass disk in the shape of a flower. [279]
Its petals were engraved with tiny directions, not merely north and south but words like Someday and If. [297]
He recognized it from the stories his grandfather had told, about the admiral's lost compass rose that did not point to places but to possibilities. [322]
According to legend, the admiral had vanished chasing a direction called Otherwise, his fleet dissolving into rumors and fog. [341]
Eli touched the compass rose, expecting it to be cold, but warmth pulsed beneath his fingers like a quiet, insistent heartbeat. [362]
The petals shifted minutely, aligning with an invisible current in the cavern, until the word Perhaps faced him. [380]
Eli had spent his life trying to banish Perhaps from his workshop. [392]
Broken clocks came to him because people wanted certainty restored, seconds marching in obedient rows. [407]
He would open their backs, align the gears, and feel briefly, uncertainly certain that time could be persuaded to behave. [427]
Yet his own life had never clicked into place; plans shattered, savings dissolved, friendships drifted away with the trains. [446]
He had come to live above the depot precisely because nothing scheduled arrived there anymore. [461]
Now, standing before the admiral's lost compass rose and the waterfall that ran under his life, Eli felt coincidence shift into pattern. [483]
Perhaps, the compass suggested, was not a threat but a direction. [494]
As he watched, the petals turned again, aligning toward a dark archway on the far side of the cavern. [513]
Between tattered ferns, a staircase climbed toward a faint green glow. [524]
Eli lifted the compass rose from its pedestal, surprised at how naturally his hand closed around it. [541]
He had no map, no plan, only an old habit of trying to repair what did not quite work, and a new, uneasy desire to befriend uncertainty in planning. [570]
So he did what he had always told nervous clients never to do with time: he decided to improvise. [589]
The staircase ended in a warped door furred with moss, its glass panes filmed with dust. [605]
He pushed it open and stepped through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse, where vines had shattered the roof and sunlight fell in cautious beams. [631]
The air smelled of damp earth and forgotten experiments. [640]
Tables lay overturned, seed trays sprouting only cobwebs, but along the central path grew a row of clock faces mounted on iron stems. [663]
Each face lacked hands, bare numerals circling small empty holes. [673]
The compass rose vibrated softly, its petals aligning so that the word Now pointed straight ahead. [689]
Eli understood, not fully but enough, that the clocks waited for him to choose how they would move. [707]
He could assign them precise hands, grafting certainty onto every stem, or he could leave them open to wandering minutes. [727]
Turning the compass between his fingers, he saw other words glint along the petals: Again, Maybe, Begin. [744]
For the first time, he considered that planning did not need to be the art of trapping time, but of walking beside it, uncertainly certain that change was the only promise it kept. [777]
Eli set the compass rose on the nearest clock face, and began attaching hands that knew how to hesitate. [796]</story>
