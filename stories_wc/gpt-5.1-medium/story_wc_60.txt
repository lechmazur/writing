<story>The city of forgotten fountains began where the river gave up remembering its own source. [15]
Stone basins sat dry and hollow under balconies of cracked marble, yet the air tasted faintly of rain. [33]
In this place walked Lira, the luminous skeptic, whose doubts shone brighter than most people's faith. [49]
She was realistically imaginative, never trusting a vision unless she could feel the grit beneath its beauty. [66]
From the pause of migrating geese that traced wavering arrows over the rooftops, her work for the year began. [85]
She had come to liberate trapped memories, the ones clotted in the city like leaves strangling gutters. [102]
All of them, she believed, were being slowly siphoned into a stained glass box hidden somewhere among the fountains. [121]
The rumors spoke in a defiant hush, as if the very paving stones feared being overheard by the box itself. [141]
Old women forgot the names of their children mid-sentence, and shopkeepers misplaced entire afternoons between closing and dusk. [159]
The stained glass box, the stories said, fed on these absences, drinking down time as if it were light. [178]
Lira trusted no story, but she trusted the pattern of loss, and she meant to unstick it by following breadcrumbs. [198]
The breadcrumbs were not crumbs at all, but small anomalies she collected in a thin leather notebook. [215]
A fountain that flowed only when no one watched, a child who remembered tomorrow but not yesterday, a shadow without its owner. [237]
Each anomaly pointed subtly toward the next, sketching a hesitant trail through arcades and alleys, like constellations learning to walk. [257]
It was a work that required sidereal patience, the same long, cold focus with which distant stars watch empires blink out. [278]
Lira trained her doubt to move at that pace, refusing every easy explanation the way a fasting monk refuses bread. [298]
On the forty-third day, the breadcrumbs led her to a plaza where a single working fountain whispered beneath the ruins of three dry ones. [322]
Its water rose straight up, then halted in midair, like a question that refused to fall or be answered. [341]
When Lira stepped closer, the air around the fountain thickened with a pressing silence, and she felt someone else's childhood hovering there. [363]
In the trembling arc of water she saw, as if through warped glass, a boy losing his red kite to a sudden gust. [386]
Without thinking, she reached into the watery image and gripped the string, her fingers burning with the cold of another year. [407]
The fountain shuddered, the boy laughed somewhere beyond hearing, and the water finally fell, splashing her up to the knees. [427]
Lira stumbled back, realizing that every fountain was a lock and every lost moment a key, if only she dared to turn it. [450]
Around her, the plaza seemed to lean in; shutters closed in a slow, defiant hush, but unseen eyes stayed at their cracks. [472]
She knew then that the stained glass box must be near, for the city itself had started to remember being afraid. [493]
The trail of fountains, now flowing one by one as she freed their captive scenes, drew her toward the oldest quarter, where the streets dipped underground. [519]
There, beneath an arch etched with nameless coats of arms, she found a stair spiraling down between sweating stone walls. [539]
The chamber below was lit by its own artifact: a box the size of a coffin, panes of stained glass breathing with slow, internal light. [564]
In each pane a different memory flickered, half-formed: a wedding without a bride, a classroom without students, a bed where no one ever slept. [588]
The box hummed with a sound like held breath, and in that sound Lira heard her own forgotten moments calling back to her. [611]
To open the box, she sensed, would unstick all those memories at once, but it would also demand something equal in return. [633]
Being realistically imaginative, she measured her fear against the city's hollowed eyes and decided her own certainty was a fair price. [654]
She laid both hands on the glass and poured her skepticism in, every guarding question, every careful hesitation she had ever used as armor. [678]
The box swelled, colors brightening to a harsh dawn, then shattered without a sound, its fragments rushing upward like startled birds of glass. [701]
Above, every fountain roared back to life as memories slammed into their owners, making them stagger, weep, or laugh in bewildered relief. [723]
In the chamber, Lira sank to her knees, her mind suddenly clear of doubt, not empty but open, painfully luminous from the inside out. [747]
She listened to the city breathing through its fountains, no longer a defiant hush but a careful, hopeful silence learning how to begin again. [771]</story>
