<story>After time became visible, it draped the baroque asteroid in slow, iridescent curtains that everyone pretended not to see. [19]
The curtains pooled in corners like spilled years, slid along cornices carved from nickel-iron, and collected inside mirrors. [37]
On such days, when storms of magnetic dust rattled the windows, Mara went through the galleries shrouding every mirror she could find. [59]
She said the exposed glass let time leak in too quickly, that reflections gave it angles and leverage. [77]
The younger archivists laughed, but they helped, because no one liked the taste of years on their tongue. [95]
Mara had once led a revolution here, back when the asteroid was still a hollowed fortress of engines and artillery. [115]
They called her defunct now, in the way one might describe a broken antenna or a dead satellite. [133]
Her slogans remained faintly visible on the vaulted ceilings, ghost letters beneath newer frescoes of saints of entropy. [151]
In the Hall of Fractured Dynasties, she met Elyas, the most poetically inclined of the young archaeologists. [168]
He was cataloging a box of debris recovered from an impact crater at the asteroid's equatorial fringe. [185]
Among the rusted bolts and fossilized insulation lay a single shard of crystal, clear as frozen breath. [202]
Mara picked it up, and time thickened around her fingertips, swirling in pale bands suspended like smoke in syrup. [221]
Elyas saw it too, the way the years inside the shard trembled, miniature and terrified, seeking escape. [238]
He whispered that the shard was part of the Founders' Hourglass, the legendary chronometer shattered when time first bled into view. [259]
The Council claimed the Hourglass had never existed, dismissed it as insurgent mythology, like most stories attached to Mara's name. [279]
But the shard pulsed against her palm, and she felt old chants surface, not as slogans, but as questions. [298]
What if the revolution had failed not because they were wrong, she thought, but because they had imagined too little? [318]
Elyas, eyes bright with unsanctioned curiosity, asked if she would join the excavation team disputing the Council's latest proclamation. [337]
According to new stratigraphic readings, the earliest habitation layers lay not beneath the fortress, but within it, sealed behind ornamental bulkheads. [358]
If true, it would mean the war engines had been additions, that the asteroid's first purpose was not conquest but ceremony. [379]
Such a claim threatened the Council's founding myth, which painted the Founders as pragmatic warlords rather than delicate builders of impossible rites. [401]
Mara agreed, not out of loyalty to her old cause, which lay embalmed in commemorative manuals, but because a different rebellion stirred in her. [425]
She wanted to reimagine the entire civilization, to peel away the varnish of inevitability and see what might have been possible. [446]
Together they descended into the sealed compartments, where baroque corridors twisted like frozen music and time hung in curtains thicker than breath. [468]
Mirrors lined the walls, each framed in copper vines, each reflecting not their faces but the asteroid at earlier moments of itself. [490]
Spooked, Elyas suggested covering them, and Mara, remembering her storm rituals, tore down velvet drapes from a ceremonial balcony. [509]
As they veiled each mirror, the visible time within it recoiled with a sound like distant weeping, leaving the glass clear and ordinary. [532]
Behind the last mirror they found a chamber crowded with hundreds of crystal vase shards, each holding a trembling coil of captured years. [555]
Elyas argued that these were funerary vessels, preserving lifetimes the way ancient cultures preserved organs, and that the asteroid was a mausoleum. [577]
Mara countered that the coils moved not in closed loops but in branching patterns, like maps of roads no one had walked yet. [600]
Their disagreement bloomed into an archaeological dispute that spread through the institute, splitting scholars between those who saw death and those who saw rehearsal. [624]
The Council sided with the funerary interpretation, which left history tidily fatal, and ordered the chambers sealed again under layers of protocol. [646]
Mara and Elyas met in the echoing chapel of obsolete engines to devise another way of telling the story. [665]
They began recording the movements of the time coils, tracing each branching filament into poems that described worlds that had never solidified. [687]
Elyas wrote of cities that could pivot into gardens overnight; Mara wrote of councils that listened before they ruled. [706]
They projected these verses onto the veiled mirrors, and slowly, like tarnish lifting from metal, new reflections assembled beneath the cloth. [727]
The asteroid appeared not as fortress or tomb, but as a theater suspended in the dark, stages layered within stages of unused possibility. [750]
Mara knew these visions would never replace the official histories, yet their glow burnished the sorrow that had long calcified in her chest. [773]
When the next magnetic storm rose, she walked the corridors alone, covering mirrors not to keep time out, but to keep these reimagined futures from leaking away. [800]</story>
