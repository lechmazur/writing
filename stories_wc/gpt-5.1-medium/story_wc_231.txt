<story>The first time I saw the eccentric lighthouse keeper, he was kneeling on the opal dock in mist, cupping something invisible. [21]
It was at nautical twilight, when the sea refused to admit it was night and the sky refused to admit it was day. [44]
The dock glowed like a buried moonstone, wet planks throwing back colors no one had painted there. [61]
He heard my footsteps and turned, his yellow slicker hanging open, a dried Edelweiss boutonniere pinned where a name tag should be. [83]
That little flower was so out of place here, at sea level, that I stopped three boards away and forgot what excuse I had prepared. [108]
He looked past me, as if checking who might be listening, though there was only the mutter of waves and the soft complaining of ropes. [133]
You came back, he said, and his voice was not surprised, just softly persistent, as though he were resuming a conversation I had forgotten starting. [158]
I had never met him before, but the certainty in his washed gray eyes made me feel as if I were the one who had misplaced something. [185]
You dropped these, he added, holding out his empty palms as if they cradled glass, and the mist between us shivered like a living thing. [210]
Later I would realize this was how he spoke about borrowed memories, as though they were objects you could misplace on a table or lose between floorboards. [237]
At the time, I only knew that behind him the lighthouse loomed over the cliff, its lantern caged in rust, its windows blind as cataracts. [262]
You are here to investigate, he said, before I could introduce myself, and the way he said it made it clear it was not a question. [288]
I was, though the report in my pocket called it a routine inquiry into the final gesture of a man found drowned beneath this very dock. [314]
Witnesses had seen the stranger stand alone here at nautical twilight, lift his hand as if offering something to the air, then step silently into the black water. [342]
My assignment was simple, the supervisor had said: decode a stranger's final gesture, write it down, file it away, forget it. [363]
But standing on that opal dock in mist, with the eccentric lighthouse keeper regarding me like a long delayed letter, simplicity felt like another lie. [388]
He tapped his boutonniere, the dried Edelweiss crackling faintly, and I realized the petals were not white at all but the color of old bones. [413]
He gave me this, the keeper said, the night before he drowned, and asked me to wear it until someone came looking for him. [437]
People die grand for strangers, he went on, but only the lonely leave instructions. [451]
What instructions, I asked, though I already had the sense that the answer would not fit neatly into my official questionnaire. [472]
He turned his back to me and faced the water, as if he were listening to a voice under the waves dictating the reply. [496]
He wanted me to remember for him, the keeper murmured at last, to hold the weight of what he had done without having to feel it. [522]
My trade is borrowed memories, you see, and business is always best where no one wants to be known. [541]
He smiled then, not at me but at the fog, and I felt the peculiar sensation that someone invisible had stepped very close, just beyond the reach of touch. [570]
How do you investigate something like that, I whispered, and the keeper answered that you do it by observing gaps, not the events that fill them. [596]
You study what was almost said, the chair left empty, the cup left unraised, the hand lifted toward nothing at all. [617]
Together we walked the length of the dock, his steps softly persistent beside mine, and he pointed out absences as if they were stains on the world. [644]
By the time the last light bled from the horizon, I understood that the stranger's final gesture had been a request for witnessed isolation, a plea to be seen vanishing, and I could no longer pretend I was only here to write a report. [688]
So I took the Edelweiss from his coat, pinned it to my own, and waited for someone else to arrive. [708]</story>
