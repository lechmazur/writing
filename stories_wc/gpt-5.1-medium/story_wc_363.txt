<story>In a forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest, Nari the loom spinner listened to the silence breathe. [18]
She was known in the mountain villages as the wistful loom spinner, weaving tapestries no one fully understood. [36]
They said her threads caught echoes of things that had not yet happened, and memories of things never lived. [55]
Nari wove because she could not bear how quickly words dissolved, how easily promises frayed into a raveling silence. [74]
Only while her shuttle flew did she feel the world steady itself through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry. [93]
She wove to carry a message across impossible distance, farther than mountains, farther than the brittle line of the horizon. [113]
The message was for her brother Haru, who had vanished ten winters ago in a blizzard that swallowed all paths. [133]
No body had been found, only his walking stick, rimed with ice and standing upright like a stubborn question. [152]
The elders declared him gone; Nari's mother cut her hair in mourning and never again spoke his name aloud. [171]
But Nari kept a single tree sap amber bead Haru had carved for her, its trapped bubble stoically sparkling in the dim light. [194]
When the night cicadas fell quiet, she pressed the bead to her lips and whispered the unfinished messages she never dared speak aloud. [217]
Her loom lived at the orchard's heart, where crooked apple trees rose among bamboo stalks like old men lost at a festival. [239]
Once, long ago, someone had tried to graft these worlds together, forest and field, but the attempt had been forgotten with the planter's name. [263]
Bamboo swallowed the paths, apples shriveled unpicked, and the orchard watched centuries pass without anyone to taste its fruit. [282]
Nari liked it that way; solitude made the threads listen. [292]
One autumn, traders from the lowland town brought a box of broken things to the mountain market, a rummage sale of strangers' leftovers. [315]
Most walked past the dented pans and cracked mirrors, but Nari paused over a nest of jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box. [340]
The cardboard pieces were painted with tiny fragments of sky, horizon, and something that looked like snow blowing sideways. [359]
Haru had loved puzzles, swearing each corner knew exactly where it belonged, even before human hands understood. [376]
Without knowing why, Nari traded two skeins of dyed wool for the box and carried it back to the orchard. [396]
That night, as moonlight threaded through bamboo leaves, she poured the puzzle pieces onto the packed earth beside her loom. [416]
Their cardboard edges sparked something in her fingers, a sense that these too were threads, only stiffer, more stubborn. [435]
She began to fit them together by lantern light, following no picture but the tug in her chest where Haru's absence lived. [457]
Hours slipped past; frost silvered the fallen apples; the puzzle grew from scattered teeth into a jagged window. [475]
Through it, in the wavering lantern light, Nari saw not cardboard but a wind-torn slope, footsteps vanishing into whiteness. [494]
The orchard hushed; even bamboo leaves seemed to hold their breath. [505]
A raveling silence spilled from the puzzle, unwinding the thin noises of night like yarn pulled from a careless scarf. [525]
In that silence, Nari heard her own heartbeat and another, fainter rhythm, as if answering from a great distance. [544]
She understood then that the puzzle was not a game but a loom turned sideways, its pieces warping space instead of thread. [566]
If she finished it, perhaps it would recombine what the blizzard had torn, and her message could finally find Haru. [586]
But to complete it, something of equal weight would have to be given, for threads never bind without cost. [605]
Nari looked at her loom, at the half-woven tapestry where a river of silver thread curved toward an unfinished shore. [625]
For ten years she had poured her youth into that cloth, believing each line of pattern might carry a syllable of farewell. [647]
She knew, with the quiet clarity of cold dawn, that to recommence the puzzle's forming she would have to feed the tapestry to it. [671]
Latent sacrifice had been woven into every thread already, yet this would make it plain, a cut that could not be resewn. [693]
She took the tree sap amber bead from her neck and hung it on the puzzle's corner, a small sun setting in cardboard sky. [717]
Then she unwove her tapestry, pulling out the silver river, the mountain lines, the hidden symbols that spelled Haru's name. [737]
Each thread she fed into the puzzle's gaps, and the picture deepened, the blizzard clarifying, a lone figure now visible on the slope. [760]
When the last thread slipped from her fingers, the loom stood bare and skeletal, and the orchard felt abruptly older. [780]
From the finished puzzle window, a warm breath exhaled, and distant footsteps turned, as if hearing. [796]</story>
