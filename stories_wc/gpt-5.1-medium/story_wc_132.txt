<story>The storm season came early to the valley, thick with greenhouses and glass. [13]
In its center stood Mara's plant nursery, a long rectangle of misted panes and humming grow lights. [30]
Mara, the plant nursery owner, had been up since before dawn. [41]
Mara did not think of herself as sentimental, but the mossy trellis after rain always slowed her steps. [59]
Water still jeweled the wire and wood, each drop holding a ghost of sky, and the air smelled like waking roots. [80]
She told herself she walked this way each morning only to study plant behaviors, to see which leaves turned first toward the light, which fungi pushed quickest through the dark boards. [111]
But the truth lived in the circuitously sincere detours her feet kept making, as if some shy part of her circled the trellis hoping to be noticed. [138]
On that particular morning, the rain had broken only an hour earlier, and the world still felt rearranged by water. [158]
Mara stopped beneath the trellis to pick a linden leaf stuck to the damp mesh, its heart shape pressed flat and gleaming. [180]
The linden tree by the road had always been her boundary marker, the edge of what she believed she understood. [200]
Beyond it, the hills rose in a confusion of scrub and oak where storms twisted the wind into knots and she never bothered to walk. [225]
Her world was pots and tags and invoices, seedlings sorted in soldier-straight rows, every growth accounted for. [242]
Yet storms had been arriving out of schedule, thrashing the valley with sideways rain, bending her careful rows until they learned new shapes without asking her permission. [269]
A week before, lightning had struck the linden, burning a spiral down its trunk, and still it stood, leafing out around the wound as if reconstructing itself by releasing control. [299]
Mara rubbed the smooth skin of the leaf between her fingers and felt a tug of envy. [316]
Plants did not question whether they deserved to change; they simply bent, split, sprouted, or died. [332]
She, on the other hand, had built her life to resist all unscheduled growth. [346]
The nursery was the last piece of order her parents had left her before they drove up into the mountains and never came back. [370]
She told the story in brisk, circuitously sincere phrases when customers asked, skipping the part where she woke to sirens on the ridge. [393]
Now, as thunder grumbled distantly like a tired animal, Mara tucked the linden leaf into her pocket and went inside to prepare for the next assault of weather. [421]
She lowered shade cloths, checked gutters, and moved fragile flats off the floor, her body remembering the choreography even as her thoughts wandered back to the wounded tree. [449]
Why had the storm not taken it completely? [457]
And why, when she stood beside it two nights ago with a flashlight, had she felt that same spiral burning faintly in her chest? [481]
The afternoon turned slate-colored, clouds shouldering over the hills faster than the radio forecast had warned. [497]
Customers trickled out early, clutching their cardboard flats like shields, and by closing time the nursery belonged again to the hiss of irrigation and the soft ticking of cooling glass. [527]
Mara should have gone home, made tea, watched the storm from behind safely locked windows. [542]
Instead she found herself back at the mossy trellis after rain, though the new rain had not yet fallen. [561]
The air felt stretched thin, heavy with what the sky had not yet decided. [575]
She reached into her pocket for the linden leaf, meaning only to touch it once before locking up, but when her fingers brushed its surface she felt sudden heat, as if a small, patient ember had been waiting there. [614]
The trellis shimmered, not with light but with attention, as if every vine and bead of water had turned to watch her. [636]
Her knees gave, and she knelt in the mud before she understood she was falling. [651]
The nursery sounds fell away, replaced by a dense, green hush full of sap-thick whispers. [666]
Images flickered through her mind, not memories but observations she had filed and forgotten: roots curling around stones, stems straightening after wind, a cracked pot cradling new moss. [694]
Each scene tugged her in a direction she resisted, not toward answers but toward surrender. [709]
She realized, with a fear that tasted like iron, that the storm outside was only echo to the reluctant metamorphosis pressing inside her, a sustaining transformation rather than a single strike. [740]
Somehow, without her consent, every hour she had spent among seedlings and shade cloth and dripping hoses had been teaching her how to reconstruct herself as they did, by releasing control of what form she must finally take. [778]</story>
