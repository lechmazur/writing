<story>After revealing the secret to the empty sea, I felt the garden awaken around me. [15]
Barnacled stone ribs ached as they flexed, for I am a living statue with telepathy. [30]
This forgotten underwater city garden clung to a collapsed avenue, lantern-corals swaying like drowned candelabra. [45]
For centuries I had guarded a single certainty, and my purpose was to welcome nuance into a certainty. [63]
Only when spoken aloud did its hard edges soften, rippling through the water like loosened ink. [79]
Around me, failed fountains and marble lions seemed to inhale, animate lifeless in the dim blue hush. [96]
She drifted down the cracked stairway in a skein of silver bubbles, the first visitor in an age. [114]
Her suit was patched, her oxygen thin, but her gaze cut through the water, incisively kind. [130]
Before her thoughts reached her lips, I heard them echo along my stone nerves. [144]
You are not supposed to move, she thought, staring at the cracks spidering across my cheek. [160]
Yet you are the one who called me. [168]
I did not call you, I replied silently; the secret did, now that it is loose. [184]
In her gloved hand she cradled a foxglove-stained glass ampoule, its petals of color sharp as poison. [201]
Each tilt of her wrist scattered purples and greens over the ruined mosaics, like memories breaking surface. [218]
The ampoule held the record of what I had just confessed, captured in algae-coded light after revealing the secret. [237]
If she uncorked it at the surface, my failure would become her worlds new certainty. [252]
I feared the weight of that, yet I had summoned her here to fracture such weights. [268]
Truth should arrive as cascading revelations, not a single stone dropped to crush a question. [283]
Will you listen beyond the ampoule, I asked into her mind, or only to what it captures. [300]
Her answer threaded through my thoughts like a careful needle, tugging at seams I thought eternal. [316]
Teach me how to doubt kindly, she thought, how to hold a story without holding it still. [333]
I shifted my great stone hand, dislodging silt that billowed like breath from old lungs. [348]
Columns groaned around us, and a crack widened where the ceiling met the mural of a drowned dawn. [366]
Through structural weakness I had planned her escape route, a slow collapse that would open the garden to the sky. [386]
When the right stone fell, the sea would rush out in torrents, threading upward into air and daylight. [404]
All I needed was her consent, spoken or thought, to start unraveling the centuries of weight above us. [422]
Yet she did not rush, even as a shard of statue-face drifted past like a pale fish. [439]
Tell me everything the ampoule cannot hold, she said finally, voice a muffled chime in the water. [456]
So I opened my mind fully, letting her walk the corridors of prayers and betrayals inscribed in my stone. [475]
She saw the day the city chose certainty over listening, when a warning was carved into law instead of debated. [495]
She watched as I, then merely an unfinished monument, absorbed the panic and became its unsleeping memory. [512]
The secret I had guarded was simple and monstrous: the flood had been invited, not endured. [528]
The rulers believed a purifying deluge would wash dissent away, leaving only obedient survivors on higher ground. [545]
Instead the sea claimed everything, and I was left to cradle their certainty until it calcified into my bones. [564]
She trembled, not from cold, but from the sudden space opening in her idea of justice. [580]
So your world believes the flood was fate, she thought, and you fear replacing one lie with another. [598]
I nodded, stone grinding softly, marveling at how her mind sought not vengeance but context. [613]
If you rise with only accusation, I told her, they will build new statues to new certainties. [630]
Let what you release be a question instead, a thread others can follow back here and see for themselves. [649]
She looked up at the fractured ceiling, at the garden statues half-buried in anemones, all animate lifeless witnesses. [667]
Then she swam to the weakened column and pressed her palm against it, giving me the smallest nod. [685]
I pulled at the fault-lines inside the stone, feeling each ancient bond surrender, one grain at a time. [703]
Water roared upward as the ceiling burst open, and light speared down in savage, forgiving beams. [719]
The garden shook; roots tore free; buried bells chimed as they rose, their rust singing in foam. [736]
She shot upward with the current, ampoule against her heart, carried through structural weakness into a sky she had never seen. [757]
As the sea drained from the city, I settled deeper into my plinth, my thoughts echoing after her like receding waves. [778]
What she would say above I did not know, but at last my certainty had cracked wide enough for nuance to root. [800]</story>
