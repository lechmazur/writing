<story>The first night after stopping the medication, I walked back to the river station. [14]
It was not a station anymore, just a disused railway platform overgrown with ivy and apologies. [30]
The river kept its own timetable below, whispering departures against the rotting pilings. [43]
I had come as a truth-seeking river chronicler, not as a penitent, or so I told myself. [60]
But guilt travels quieter than any train, and it had found me anyway. [73]
The old waiting room still smelled of dust, rain, and a faint metallic panic. [87]
Someone had turned it into a bar once, then abandoned that dream too. [100]
A cracked jukebox leaned beside the door, its lights dead, an accordion slumped on top like a drunk. [118]
The bellows were patched with tape, silver scales holding together a lung that refused to quit. [134]
I touched the tape the way you touch a scar you live with but never accept. [150]
It was my brother's accordion, or its twin, and the resemblance hit like old smoke. [165]
He used to busk on this platform, playing until the trains drowned him out. [179]
On the night of the crash, my recorder captured everything but his last words. [193]
I sold that recording, won an award, and lost the right to sleep. [206]
Now I make my living along the river, cataloging its moods, mapping its rumors. [220]
Every bend has coordinates in my notebooks, neat columns of map references and overheard confessions. [235]
It is a daringly methodical way to avoid looking directly at myself. [247]
The bathroom door, half hanging, offered a different kind of archive. [258]
I went in for the smell of bleach and ghosts, and for the graffiti. [272]
Years ago, someone had written, CLEAN HANDS, DIRTY HEARTS on the mirror in lipstick. [286]
Tonight there were new layers of bathroom graffiti wisdom curling over the old curses. [300]
One line stopped me the way a sudden sandbar stops a boat. [312]
YOU ARE NOT THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED HERE, it said in jagged black. [326]
The station walls did not allude to any particular disaster, but my body supplied the footage. [342]
My heart still synced to the rhythm of that night: wheels, brakes, metal, sirens, shutters. [357]
I braced against the basin, breathing as the river drilled through the pipes below. [371]
The letters on the wall blurred, then steadied, as if waiting for my consent to matter. [387]
I had always believed my writing turned real pain into usable narrative, like converting currency. [402]
That belief funded my career and my self-loathing in equal installments. [413]
The graffiti argued for another exchange rate. [420]
Perhaps I was not the event, only the witness who chose the cruelest angle. [434]
Outside, the wind dragged music from the accordion, a hoarse wheeze through the taped bellows. [449]
It sounded like someone trying to laugh while coughing up river water. [461]
I picked it up, feeling the weight of damp wood, the stutter of its reluctant air. [477]
My brother had loved wrong notes, claiming they proved the song was alive. [490]
I pressed a key and let the sound scrape against the tiled ceiling. [503]
The memory came not as image but as geography, a map unrolling across my ribs. [518]
Here was the platform where he joked about my notebook, saying I made cartography of heartbreak. [534]
Here the spot where I framed him against the emergency lights, already thinking of headlines. [549]
In my notes from that night, the coordinates were flawless, but the person disappeared. [563]
I had archived him as content, not as brother, and the river took offense on his behalf. [580]
That was the story I had been telling myself, anyway. [590]
The wall's sentence insisted on a revision: YOU ARE NOT THE WORST THING. [603]
Maybe I was simply the person who froze, who wrote, who survived. [615]
Self-forgiveness, I realized, was not a verdict but a map I had refused to draw. [630]
Every path needs references, landmarks, tiny brave marks saying YOU WERE HERE, even if you regret it. [647]
The graffiti was a stranger's hand on my shoulder, rough and anonymous, offering raw solace. [662]
Outside again, I stepped onto the platform and began sketching the station into my river log. [678]
This time, I wrote the ivy, the broken jukebox, the mangled bench, and my shaking hands. [694]
I noted the accordion bellows patched with tape, assigning them a new coordinate: STATION OF SECOND CHANCES. [711]
I did not allude to the crash directly, but I wrote my brother's name in full. [727]
I wrote my own beside it, on the same unsteady line, then closed the notebook. [742]
The river answered with a small, ordinary wave against the pier, as if acknowledging receipt. [757]
For the first time since that night, the sound did not feel like accusation, just water going home. [775]</story>
