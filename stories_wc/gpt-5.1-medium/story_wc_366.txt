<story>The night after the lamp finally flickered out, Elias Finch brought the last crate of winter oil to Greyhook Light. [20]
He was the supply skipper, reticent by habit, steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology through the black swell. [39]
Above him the lighthouse loomed, its lantern room dark for the first time in ninety-seven years. [55]
He felt the absence of the beam like a missing rib, a sharp, cold vacancy under his own skin. [74]
The keepers had all gone ashore at dusk, leaving him to deliver supplies and check the useless machinery alone. [93]
Officially, the lamp failed when the funding failed, and the town decided navigation apps were cheaper than kerosene and glass. [113]
Unofficially, people whispered the lantern room was haunted, and that when the beam stopped sweeping, something else would wake. [132]
Elias did not believe in ghosts, only in tides, weather reports, and the weight of crates under his hands. [151]
Still, as he climbed the iron steps, his warmly observant eyes cataloged every creak, every draft, every swallowed echo. [170]
He had ferried lamps, barrels, and lonely men for twenty years, noticing what they tried not to say. [188]
On the landing outside the lantern room, he stopped, because someone had stacked stones on the floor in a crooked spiral. [209]
Elias recognized the pattern at once, the old fisherfolk code: a way of stacking stones as messages when paper could not survive the damp. [233]
He had learned it from his grandfather, who claimed wreckers once used it to guide ships not to safety but to ruin. [255]
Tonight the spiral pointed inward, toward the locked door and the tower of dark glass above. [271]
He bent, rearranged two stones, and changed the message from invitation to warning, the way his grandfather had shown him. [291]
Elias told himself it was only habit, yet his fingers trembled as he unlocked the door and stepped into the haunted lantern room. [314]
Even without the lamp burning, the curved panes held the sea in fragments, black water and white foam slicing around him like shattered film. [338]
On the floor by the extinguished lens lay a small envelope and, beside it, a green piece of sea glass. [358]
The glass had been polished by years of waves into something soft-edged and luminous, like a captured drop of the very beam that used to turn here. [385]
Elias picked it up first, pressing it against his palm, feeling a foolish, painful urge to bottle the feeling of safety it suggested. [408]
When he opened the envelope, there was no name, only a single line written in blotted ink: Thank you for watching over us. [431]
Another envelope lay tucked into the gear housing, the same crabbed hand asking, Who will protect us now that the light is gone. [454]
Elias found a third inside the hollow of the stair, the words smudged as if read and reread: We will keep each other, if someone shows us how. [482]
They were part of an anonymous letter chain, he realized, passed from keeper to keeper, never signed, always thanking, always afraid to stop writing. [506]
He imagined lonely hands reaching for stationery in the long storms, sending gratitude forward like a lifeline to whoever would inherit the night. [529]
No one had written one to him; the supply skipper was a shadow between their names, carrying oil and bread, never confessions. [551]
Yet the letters hummed in his chest, a luminescent ache, as if all the old gratitude had been misaddressed and finally found him. [574]
Outside, without the revolving glare, the ocean turned invisible, though he knew trawlers and weekend sailors still felt their way past the buried reefs. [598]
It was not his job to patrol them, only to deliver boxes and leave before dawn, but the question in the second letter would not let go. [625]
Who will protect us now, he murmured, and the lantern room answered with the shuffle of his own breath and far-off surf. [647]
He set the sea glass on the dead lens, angling it so the faint harbor glow below threaded through, casting a small green halo on the ceiling. [674]
The light it made was nothing ships could see, but it reached his own hands, and strangely, that was where protection needed to begin. [698]
He gathered the letters, found a blank sheet in the keepers desk, and wrote without signing, as they had done. [718]
I am only the one who comes and goes, he wrote, but I have been watching the water longer than any of you. [741]
If you leave the stones on the landing, I will read them, and I will answer, and we will keep each other. [763]
He tucked the new letter under the sea glass, a fragile beacon for whoever came after, then went down, scuffing the spiral of stones so the message would mean safe. [793]</story>
