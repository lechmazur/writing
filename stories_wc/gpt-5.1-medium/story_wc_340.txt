<story>The elevator hummed as it pierced the clouds, climbing ten floors toward the icebound spire where the servants were never meant to go. [23]
Etta, the lowest-ranked server in the sky-palace, stood alone inside, an ascending servant by accident and stubborn, misdirected hope. [42]
She had timed her theft of the maintenance key for this hour, as the elevator climbs ten floors without stopping for nobles or guards. [66]
She told herself she rode upward only to polish forgotten brass, but the truer reason pressed at her chest: to seek out the joy beneath anguish. [92]
Her curiosity had always been warmly inquisitive, more suited to a scholar than a scullion, and the palace punished such warmth with colder and colder work. [118]
Frost traced silver ferns along the glass walls as the elevator shuddered past the lower garden decks and the kitchens, into seldom-traveled air. [141]
Above, she glimpsed the destination: an icebound spire above the clouds, its terraces rimed with sunlit daggers, its windows dark as sealed eyes. [164]
Around her neck hung the airship captain's goggles she had rescued from the rubbish chute, their lenses cracked yet tinted the world amber and green. [189]
She wore them not as a trophy but as a tool; behind their scratches, scattered light behaved strangely, revealing seams others did not see. [213]
Rumor claimed that in the spire's observatory, the last airship captain had left a diary so dangerous it was locked, encrypted beyond any court wizard. [238]
Etta imagined not curses and treason inside, but lost jokes, secret songs, some testament that a life spent above the clouds might still be tender. [263]
The nobles drifted past her days like painted ghosts, their sorrows displayed on silk sleeves; she dusted around them with an affectionate detachment she hardly understood. [289]
Their complaints about oversteeped tea and under-polished balustrades sounded like code for something truer, a quiet anguish that hid its own frightened joy. [312]
If the captain's diary could unfold that code, could show how to read the joy beneath anguish in anyone, she wanted to learn. [335]
The elevator sighed past the eighth floor; her ears popped, and the world outside turned whiter, the clouds below now a wrinkled, glowing sea. [359]
She clutched the maintenance key in her pocket, its teeth biting her palm, and rehearsed lies for the guards she might not meet. [382]
On the tenth floor, the doors folded open with a sigh that smoked in the cold, revealing an empty corridor frosted in pale, patient blue. [407]
Etta stepped out, her breath a ghost ahead of her, and followed the corridor toward the heart of the icebound spire, boots scraping softly. [431]
The observatory door was a circle of dull metal veined with crystal; through its narrow window, scattered light from rotating prisms painted frantic colors. [455]
She slipped on the captain's goggles, and the chaos calmed; through the tinted glass the colors resolved into lines of script looping around the lock. [480]
The script was no language she knew, yet it felt like the nobles' complaints, patterns of suffering arranged politely; she traced them with gloved fingers. [505]
Instead of prying the lock, she pressed where the script brightened, murmuring apologies and small kindnesses, as if the door wanted consolation more than force. [530]
The metal warmed under her hand and rotated; the door unfolded slowly, petals of ice scraping aside to reveal a room cluttered with instruments and notebooks. [556]
On a central lectern lay the diary, its cover patchworked from balloon silk and leather, its pages edged in symbols that shifted whenever she tried to focus. [583]
She angled the diary beneath the spinning prism above, reading through scattered light as it fell across the paper, goggles amplifying each glint into tentative meaning. [609]
Lines rose from the page like steam, forming memories: storms weathered, mutinies soothed with jokes, the captain's aching back eased by laughter shared with frightened apprentices. [635]
Etta realized the encryption was not meant to keep pain secret but to insist that every cruelty be annotated with the small joys that survived beside it. [662]
The captain described passengers who wept over imagined insults, crew who raged at frostbitten fingers, and always she watched them with affectionate detachment, sketching their hidden gladness in margins. [691]
Etta's own life unfolded between the lines: scrub-water cracks, midnight songs in the laundry, the warmth of another servant's shoulder during storms when the palace shook. [717]
She closed the diary gently, not to steal it but to carry its method back down the ten floors, an invisible script for reading suffering differently. [743]
When the elevator doors swallowed her once more, she faced the descent as a servant still, yet now an ascending one, eyes tuned to the joy beneath anguish. [771]</story>
