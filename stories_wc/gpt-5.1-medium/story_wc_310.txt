<story>The universe had already contracted when I climbed the ambered observatory deck for the last time. [16]
Outside, space was no longer an expansion but a held breath, a dark ocean waiting to decide whether to inhale again. [37]
Inside, I resumed my post as the station's cast lots decision maker, the one trusted to randomize fate when reason ran dry. [59]
My tools were a battered wooden bowl and a collection of foreign coins whose nations had evaporated with the first collapse of spacetime. [82]
Each coin held a symbol of a vanished certainty, a profile or crest that once claimed, however briefly, that the world made sense. [105]
Now they whispered only stellar doubt as they clinked against each other, a tiny constellation of metals arguing over probability. [125]
Tamsin waited by the console, quietly enthusiastic in the way of people who had decided that fear could be rebranded as curiosity. [147]
She had been born after the universe contracted, and so to her the notion that space once galloped outward felt like a dubious rumor. [171]
What she believed in instead was the backwards prophecy humming through the receivers, a story told from ending to beginning in broken broadcasts. [194]
We had learned the method a decade ago, understanding static bursts not as noise but as sentences unraveled by time and flung upstream. [217]
Every shift, we tuned the dish by hand, hunting the precise frequency where their inverted messages could teach us to wavelength align with purpose. [241]
Tonight, the static had thickened into something like urgency, and Tamsin had requested a casting of lots before we risked replying. [262]
I held the bowl under the low amber lights and felt the metallic chill gather in my palms. [280]
As always, I whispered the precollapse litany: 'Chance knows what cause forgets.' [292]
Then I cast the coins across the glass floor, listening to how they spun, how they chose their resting constellations. [312]
The pattern that emerged resembled a lopsided spiral cutting inward, as if motion itself had been wounded and was curling around the injury. [335]
Tamsin crouched beside me, her breath fogging the floor. [344]
"What does that say?" she asked. [350]
I followed the spiral inward with my fingertip, tracing coins minted on worlds where gravity had once pointed outward, not inward. [371]
It says we only move closer, never away, but the lot is unsure whether closer means wisdom or oblivion. [390]
Tamsin nodded as if that were already obvious, her eyes returning to the monitors where the backwards prophecy crackled in jagged peaks. [412]
On the screen, the waveform folded against itself, carrying a voice we would never meet, speaking from the universe that would follow ours. [435]
We always listened in reverse, recording the bursts, then flipping the sequences so a broken farewell became an uncertain greeting. [455]
Tonight, though, the voice arrived already inverted, as if whoever spoke had finally understood that communication required meeting us in our own direction. [478]
Static throbbed, then cleared just enough for a line to emerge: 'Do not cast again; the choice loops; step off the spiral.' [500]
The coins on the floor glimmered like guilty witnesses, and my fingers twitched toward the bowl out of reflex. [519]
I was the cast lots decision maker, the person you called when neither mathematics nor prayer could break a deadlock; to stop casting was to amputate my function. [547]
Tamsin heard the same sentence and smiled with raw relief, as if the universe had finally said, 'You may choose your own way now.' [571]
Stellar doubt flooded me; if chance stepped aside, whatever we did next would belong entirely to us, unshared and unforgiven. [591]
Beyond the dome, the sky looked bruised and sticky, stars packed so closely that their light became a thick marmalade against the glass. [614]
The cosmologists said that when this compression finished, a new burst would follow, another outrush of matter and will, seeded with whatever choices we made in these final turns. [643]
If that was true, then my job had never been to surrender to randomness; it had been to distill from uncertainty a pattern worth bequeathing forward. [669]
I crouched among the coins and, for the first time, did not scoop them up. [684]
The lot has spoken, I said, surprising myself with how steady my voice sounded. [698]
It says I should stop listening to it. [706]
Instead, I walked to the console and placed my hands on the tuning dials, feeling the faint buzz as the static washed through me, as if the universe were groping for my outline. [739]
Together, Tamsin and I adjusted the frequency in slow, careful turns, not seeking an order from beyond but trying to wavelength align with purpose already latent within our own trembling atoms. [770]
When the static finally softened into a low, continuous hum, she let out a quietly enthusiastic breath, and I, still ruled by stellar doubt, chose to trust that hum anyway. [800]</story>
