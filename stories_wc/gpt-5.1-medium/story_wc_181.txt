<story>Between the first and last page of the Archive of Orbits, Elias became curator of a museum that did not exist. [21]
Its galleries hung in the vacuum above a lonely asteroid, where an astral orchard blossomed in silent, unbreathable wind. [40]
From certain angles the apples were miniature suns; from others, they were closed eyes that did not yet know who dreamed them. [62]
Elias had been assigned here because he was, as the appointment letter claimed, simply complicated. [77]
He could catalog meteorites in his sleep yet forgot his own age whenever someone dared inquire. [93]
His bewilderment was not incompetence but overflow, like a library whose shelves extended faster than anyone could walk. [111]
The orchard was the museum, and the museum was the book, and the book was still being written. [129]
Visitors seldom came in person; mostly, they arrived as annotations, drifting down as thin luminous margins across the starless dark. [149]
Each annotation whispered a question, and the orchard answered by budding a new fruit whose seeds were memories. [167]
Elias collected those seeds, pressing them between transparent plates in the catalog hall that circled the asteroid like a belt. [187]
His favorite artifact, however, was smaller than a fingernail: a pistachio shell cameo blank resting in a velvet cavity. [206]
Nothing yet had been carved into it, and that emptiness seemed louder than any depiction of emperors or saints. [225]
The label floating beside it read, Source Unknown, Ownership Nonlinear, Handle With Paradoxes. [238]
Elias suspected the shell was an anchor for a theory he was not supposed to pursue, a theory of inheritance that looped sideways through time. [263]
The Archive called it nonlinear inheritance: histories passed not from parent to child, but from reader to character, dreamer to stone, apple to astronaut. [287]
Forbidden, according to the regulations etched on the asteroid's underside, because such inheritance eroded the comforting lie of chronology. [306]
Yet the more Elias avoided reading about it, the more the annotations clustered around him like guilty fireflies. [324]
They brushed his sleeves, requesting attention, asking in breathless margins who truly inherited a story: the one born into it, or the one who found it late. [351]
Whenever the questions grew too thick, Elias retreated to the bathroom at the back of the catalog hall, the only room with a door. [375]
There, beneath the steady drip of recycled condensation, he had his most unsettling clarity, as if he were cursed to have philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms. [400]
On the night the cameo blank began to glow, he was leaning over the tiny sink, watching his reflection stutter in the warped metal. [424]
His face appeared between the first and last page of itself, every age overlaid, none in the correct order. [443]
Behind him, in the mirror that should have shown only the door, he saw the astral orchard blooming inside the bathroom stall. [465]
Branches grew from the toilet tank, heavy with fruit that pulsed like soft green lanterns, each one etched with a different name. [487]
One fruit bore his own signature, though he had never signed it, and another carried the looping script from the label of the pistachio shell. [512]
He reached out; the mirror did not resist, and his hand slipped through cool glass into the orchard air that was not air at all. [537]
The fruit with his signature fell neatly into his palm and split open without effort, revealing not pulp but pages, thin as pistachio skins. [561]
On those pages, someone had carved a cameo of him, still blank-faced, as if waiting for his present expression to finish the engraving. [584]
The realization struck with brightened disquiet: he had not inherited this image from his ancestors, but from futures he had not yet considered. [607]
Some version of him, perhaps centuries ahead or behind, had offered this self-portrait into the orchard as payment for something unspeakable. [628]
Nonlinear inheritance meant his choices here could reshape that distant bargain, could send knowledge rippling backward to the hand that first held the blank shell. [653]
No regulation could stop this; the law carved under the asteroid did not reach sideways into the book he was becoming. [674]
He stepped fully through the mirror, carrying the future-fruit and the memory of the tiny bathroom, and walked among the trees. [695]
To pursue forbidden knowledge now felt less like rebellion and more like custodial duty, as though every unanswered question in the orchard were waiting to inherit him. [722]</story>
