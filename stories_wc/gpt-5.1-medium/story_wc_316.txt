<story>When the hearing began, the floating rock dojo drifted above the ruined courthouse foundations. [14]
Wind curled around us in slow spirals, carrying dust, old paper, and fragments of forgotten verdicts. [30]
I stood at the center circle, an ego death survivor masquerading as a legal witness. [45]
After my mind had shattered and dissolved last year, feelings returned only as faint shadows of themselves. [62]
I had come here to defeat emotional numbness before it calcified into the only law I obeyed. [79]
Across from me levitated my clone, Arin-2, barefoot on a smaller rock, his orange robe snapping. [95]
Between us, secured by glass tendrils, floated the brain in a jar labeled duplicate. [109]
Its pale folds twitched sometimes, like it heard arguments before anybody spoke them aloud. [123]
High above, the arbiter hovered cross-legged on a shard of basalt, robe half white and half black. [140]
Master Kesh was famous for rulings that sliced through pretense and left motives twitching in the open. [157]
His eyes never blinked in the same color twice, as if history rewrote itself each time he inhaled. [175]
The clerk struck the gong, and fragments of sound flattened into a translucent floor between the drifting rocks. [193]
We stepped onto it, Arin-2 and I, meeting at the node where all paths converged. [208]
This was the appointed arena for the clone custody battle over the consciousness sealed in the jar. [225]
By law, only one of us could walk away recognized as the authentic Arin, guardian of that mind. [243]
The loser would be archived, memory stripped into algorithmic compost, feelings erased to prevent recursive appeals. [259]
Kesh spoke, his voice equal parts warmth and frost, the very definition of complementary opposites. [274]
You stand here, Arin-prime and Arin-2, while history rewrites itself beneath us, he said. [288]
Today we will vivify the question of self, not in theory but in consequence. [302]
Proceed with your claims. [306]
Arin-2 spoke first, of course; he had always been faster with words, an echo sharpened by resentment. [323]
I should take custody, he said, because the jar holds the backup we both sprang from. [339]
Its label says duplicate, but duplication is origin here, not fraud. [350]
He gestured toward the brain, and the fluid around it fizzed like soda disturbed by an unseen hand. [368]
I watched, feeling almost nothing, just a distant pressure where fear should have been. [382]
That was the real reason I had petitioned for this hearing: not to win, but to feel. [399]
Master, I said, I seek custody to defeat emotional numbness, whether the court names me original or copy. [417]
Without responsibility for that mind, my days are data, not life. [428]
Kesh tilted his head, and the sky above us flickered through centuries, cities forming and crumbling in silence. [446]
History rewrote itself in broad strokes, yet our little argument hung untouched between edits, like a stubborn annotation. [464]
The arbiter lowered his hands, and two training blades blossomed from the air, one black, one white. [481]
Through complementary opposites we will test your claims, he declared. [491]
Take them. [493]
The black hilt settled into my palm, cool and surprisingly heavy, while the white blade flew to Arin-2. [511]
Kesh spoke again, each word a small incision. [519]
You will strike not flesh, but memory; what survives will guide my ruling. [532]
The dojo stones shimmered, and suddenly we stood within a projection of our shared childhood bedroom. [548]
Posters of starfields peeled at the corners, and the small window still leaked winter around its frame. [565]
Strike, said Kesh, and the floor rippled like water awaiting stones. [576]
Arin-2 lunged first, blade describing a white arc toward my memory of the day we first read about cloning. [595]
If he cut it, that moment would vanish from both of us, and with it the awe that had once warmed my chest. [618]
I parried, the black blade humming, and felt the faintest spark of panic, almost like real fear. [635]
We moved from scene to scene, each clash erasing or preserving fragments: our first kiss, our first betrayal, the silent meals after the accident. [659]
Every time I chose to defend a memory instead of attack his, something raw stirred beneath my numbness. [677]
I realized I did not want to win by hollowing him out, because whatever survived would be unrecognizable as me. [697]
At last we stood panting in a final memory, the night of the procedure that had created the jarred brain. [717]
Arin-2 raised his blade toward the surgeon's face, ready to erase the guilt that still sat like ice between us. [737]
Wait, I said, lowering my weapon, and for the first time my voice trembled. [751]
If that guilt goes, so does the understanding that we hurt someone to make ourselves infinite. [767]
Without it, whatever we vivify from the jar will be monstrous and numb, just like I have been trying not to stay. [789]
Kesh nodded, verdict forming, as the dojo rocks drifted closer. [799]</story>
