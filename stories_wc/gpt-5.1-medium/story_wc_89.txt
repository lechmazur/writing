<story>After the phoenix rises, the world holds its breath, and the orchard remembers every lifetime it has witnessed. [18]
The trees bloom under permanent moonlight, each blossom silver-veined, luminous, and humming with secrets older than rain. [35]
I walk between them barefoot, the soil cool and alert beneath my heels, as if listening back. [52]
Once they called me a beast whisperer, though the beasts I knew best no longer wore flesh or fur. [71]
They lived as wind-currents, as tremors in roots, as constellations half-erased by the stubborn glow of the moon. [89]
Tonight I have come to speak to only one of them, though she has been dead three years. [107]
I come to reforge a bond beyond death, though every step tightens the knot of dread around my ribs. [126]
The moon hangs paradoxically steady above the shifting petals, as if nailed to the sky by unseen hands. [144]
Its light catches the small paper rectangle I keep folded in my palm, softer than any relic should be. [163]
It is a fortune from a cookie we cracked together on her last living night, laughing at its absurd prophecy. [183]
The ink has faded, but I know the line by heart: You will cross the distance no map shows. [202]
I did not understand then that the distance would be death, or that the bridge would demand my own unmaking. [222]
At the orchard's heart stands the cauldron tree, its trunk hollowed into a bowl polished by centuries of wishes. [241]
Moonlight pours into the hollow like clear milk, swirling with motes that pulse in rhythm with my breathing. [259]
From a pouch at my belt I lift the last of my rare spices, gifts from creatures I once soothed. [279]
Phoenix ash clings to them, faintly opalescent, still warm from the recent burning that birthed the new sun-bird. [297]
I let the grains fall into the hollow, and the orchard inhales, leaves shivering as if tickled from within. [316]
I was taught to conjure her only via the scent of rare spices, never by blood, never by tears. [335]
The air thickens, fragrant with cardamom, star anise, phoenix ash, and the sharp, clean bite of crushed juniper. [353]
My head swims, yet my hands remain steady, arranging the fortune slip at the cauldron rim like a compass. [372]
Her name leaves my throat as a vibration more than a word, a note tuned to the orchard's sap. [391]
Around me, beasts of moonlight stir: fox-shadows, moths with translucent ribs, an antlered stag grown entirely from frost. [409]
They recognize my call and encircle the cauldron tree, their presence a low chorus beneath the crackle of starlight. [428]
No one told me that summoning the dead would require my animals, too, to loosen their hold on the world. [448]
Their eyes meet mine, full of trust and the quiet accusation of those ready to pay my unspoken price. [467]
I do not want to change, to cross, to be broken and remade in the shape our love demands. [486]
My fear is a small, sharp thing clutching the inside of my chest, insisting we have already lost enough. [505]
But the scent works its slow alchemy, and I feel the reluctant metamorphosis begin beneath my skin like thawing ice. [525]
My fingers lengthen into branches, nails rooting into bark; veins spread into twigs, mapping constellations of sap and memory. [544]
The beasts press closer, their bodies dissolving into wind that threads itself through my widening wooden ribs. [561]
I want to scream, to run, yet my heart beats paradoxically steady, matching the pulse of the moon above. [580]
Her voice arrives first, a tremor in the spice-thick air, whispering my name as if tasting it after long hunger. [600]
The fortune slip lifts, spinning slowly, and her shape coalesces around it like mist finding bone. [616]
She is both as I remember and not: hair of drifting smoke, eyes lit with woven galaxies. [633]
The distance between us is a breath, a lifetime, a death, and the width of the moon itself. [651]
You should not have come, she says, but her hand reaches for my bark-rough cheek despite the warning. [669]
Her touch completes the bridge, and suddenly I feel every lifetime the orchard has stored inside its roots. [687]
I see us as children chasing fireflies, as elders sharing soup, as two specks beneath a collapsing, radiant star. [706]
The metamorphosis finishes with a soft cracking, and I am no longer a man but an entire listening grove. [725]
She steps into me, among my branches and beasts and memories, her spirit twining with mine in cosmic intimacy. [744]
We do not defeat death or undo time; we learn to inhabit them together, like moonlight inhabits every petal. [763]
Above us the phoenix circles once, scattering embers over the orchard, and each ember becomes a new, listening seed. [782]</story>
