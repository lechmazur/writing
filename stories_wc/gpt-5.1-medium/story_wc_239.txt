<story>The last custodian of the ancient temple library lost in time called himself No-One. [14]
He was the end of history witness, appointed to remember everything that could still be forgotten. [30]
Outside the shattered cloisters, the universe was holding its breath, poised on the edge of a hiccup. [47]
Inside, a resounding hush spread through dust, stone, and the countless scrolls sleeping in their alcoves. [63]
No-One paced between leaning shelves, his steps wanderingly exact, tracing a pattern only he understood. [78]
He carried a softcover dictionary pressed flat against his ribs, its spine rebuilt again and again. [94]
It was the smallest book in the temple, and the only one that kept rewriting itself. [110]
Every time the universe flinched, certain words shifted, definitions curling and uncurling like shy animals. [125]
No-One opened it now on a lectern of cracked obsidian and found a new entry etched in pale ink. [144]
Spiral arbitration, the page read, the reconciliation of all paths by turning through them in widening circles. [161]
Below the term, the letters shivered as if unsure whether they should exist at all. [176]
He had been waiting for that phrase, without knowing its shape, since the first stars began to dim. [194]
His charge was to unravel cosmic illusions before the universe hiccuped and reset, spitting out new laws of being. [213]
Each cycle erased temples, empires, and gods, yet left a faint afterimage in the library stones and in him. [232]
He alone remembered the prior designs, the failed corrections, the truces that never held between matter and meaning. [250]
Spiral arbitration, he murmured, tasting the words like a key made of dust and light. [265]
Perhaps this was the final method, the way to unify all the diverging timelines that frayed whenever the universe trembled. [285]
He knew the ritual would not be a climb upward or a descent below, but a journeying inward while walking out. [306]
The library itself had been built around that paradox, corridors folding back on themselves, doorways opening into earlier steps. [325]
To walk straight here was to draw a spiral, each lap passing closer to an unseen center. [342]
No-One closed the dictionary, the soft cover whispering against his palm like a breathing creature. [357]
He tucked it into his robe and began walking, counting shelves instead of steps, categories instead of heartbeats. [375]
Astrology dissolved into physics, physics into grammar, grammar into fragments of forgotten prayers as he turned and turned. [393]
The more he moved, the more the temple grew still, until the air vibrated with a stationary urgency. [411]
The universe hiccuped once, a tiny lurch that made a row of candles flare sideways and then straighten shyly. [430]
Between two heartbeats, entire galaxies blinked out and reappeared with slightly different constants, like a sentence rewritten with stricter punctuation. [450]
No-One felt the change as a draft against his skin, as if time had opened a side door. [468]
He did not slow, because the spiral demanded continuity, a refusal to flinch when reality wavered. [484]
Ahead, the stacks parted, revealing a circular chamber he had never entered in all the ages he recalled. [502]
Books were arranged on the floor in nested rings, their covers facing upward like patient faces awaiting judgment. [520]
At the center lay a blank space exactly the size of his softcover dictionary. [534]
He understood then that spiral arbitration was not a law to study but a task to perform. [551]
The universe, turning and turning through its cycles, needed a witness who could weigh each possibility and let none be discarded. [572]
To unravel cosmic illusions was not to prove them false, but to place them where they could be seen completely. [592]
He stepped into the center, set the dictionary down, and opened it to the first word it offered. [610]
The entry read I, though he had long since surrendered the comfort of such a simple pronoun. [627]
Around him, the ringed books rustled open, pages fluttering like a slow wind circling a still lake. [644]
Each volume displayed a different history, a different outcome of a single cosmic decision made at the dawn of time. [664]
No-One felt them pressing against his mind, not as voices but as arrangements of meaning vying for balance. [682]
He did what he had always done, but this time with the clarity of the new term burning in him. [702]
He weighed each history wanderingly exact, neither clinging nor rejecting, letting them coil around one another like strands of a single rope. [724]
Slowly, the spirals of possibility drew tight, knotting at the center where his small book lay open, and a resounding hush pealed outward across the universe's hiccup. [751]
When the lurch passed, there was only one history, braided from all the others, and he stood within it, the end of history witness at last, knowing the library had finally unified with the world it remembered. [788]</story>
