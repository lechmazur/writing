<story>The potter reached the abandoned beekeeping oasis just as the last heat shimmer dissolved into the scorched horizon. [18]
He moved with the unhurried care of someone who had spent years becoming a zen-minded potter of desert clay. [37]
All around the oasis, the world lay peeled and blistered, a vast wasteland where nothing grew taller than his knees. [57]
He had come here to understand why some places resist change, why this pocket of green refused to burn away. [77]
Cracked hives leaned like old teeth around a dry central well, their frames empty, yet the air held a hushed expectancy. [98]
From his pack he drew a piece of faded lantern glass, its surface crazed with hairline fractures that caught the hard light. [120]
He had salvaged it from the last town whose kilns still worked, trading a bowl for this single translucent shard. [140]
When he fired his pots by following sun patterns instead of clocks, the glass would show hair-thin echoes of other firings, other days. [163]
He had come to call those flickers fractured timelines, as though each choice of heat and angle split time like cooling clay. [185]
If anywhere could reveal why one path preserved life while another delivered ash, it would be this forgotten apiary. [204]
He waited until the distant village chimneys began to smudge the sky, watching as chimney smoke flattens against the evening wind. [225]
That was when the boundaries loosened, when the lantern glass best revealed the seams running invisibly through the day. [244]
He set the faded glass atop a ratcheted hive frame and circled the oasis slowly, the way a potter circles a turning wheel. [267]
Step by step he moved by following sun patterns on the cracked stones, letting the shadows of hive boxes mark hours no clock knew. [291]
As he walked, the oasis began to thrum with almost-sound, a low remembered vibration like bees trapped inside a buried jar. [312]
Through the glass he saw faint double-images of himself, some bending to tend hives heavy with amber, some stepping through blackened ruins. [334]
One timeline held humming abundance, another the same scorched wasteland extending even over this fragile ring of shade. [352]
The potter knelt, feeling grit grind into his knees, and wondered which small gentleness had once tipped the world toward honey instead of cinder. [376]
In the shimmering overlap, he noticed how the brighter strands of time bent toward certain gestures, almost phototropic to kindness. [396]
There he was, in one faint layer, leaving a shallow dish of water for exhausted bees, though water itself was rarer than sleep. [419]
In that version, blossoms later embroidered the cracked earth, and the hives swelled with gold until pillars of bees blurred the air. [441]
In another, he saw his own hand swat an early scout from his face, a tiny cruelty tossed away like dust. [462]
There the glass showed no later blossom, only a widening crust of salt where nothing living dared break the surface. [482]
He felt no self-loathing, only a sharp gentleness toward the version of himself who had not yet learned the weight of small decisions. [505]
Perhaps, he thought, places resist change when enough kindness has soaked into their stories, making them stubborn against the drift of harsher possibilities. [528]
The not-quite-sound of bees grew louder, a layered thrum like a kiln warming, each pulse an unwritten chance still hanging in the air. [551]
He rose and walked the perimeter of the oasis, right hand hovering over each dead hive as though greeting an absent friend. [573]
At every stand he placed a pinch of his clay, mixed with ground wildflower seeds he had carried for years without much conviction. [596]
He had learned that clay remembered pressure, that vessels shaped in anger rang differently when tapped, and he wondered what memory seeds held. [619]
If the fractured timelines leaned toward kindness, he would flood this place with it, stroke by stroke, whether or not any bees returned. [642]
Already the faded lantern glass showed his overlapping selves softening, tiny adjustments in posture, shoulders eased as though unburdened by invisible weights. [664]
Along the inner wall of the well, hairline sprouts lifted uncertain heads, almost imperceptible, yet they leaned toward where his hands had passed, phototropic to kindness made tangible. [692]
He knew the wasteland beyond might never change, but this circle of stubborn life would, in some timeline, swarm again. [712]
That knowledge settled inside him like cooled porcelain, fragile yet enduring, and he walked on, gently, sharply, into whatever version of tomorrow awaited. [735]</story>
