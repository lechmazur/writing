<story>The recycled spaceship sighed each time it completed another orbit around the dead, forgotten star. [15]
Inside its patched hull, I drifted through corridors of salvaged metal and memory, the steadfast pacifist caretaker of a species that no longer existed. [39]
It had been three centuries since the last human was born, and I was the echo their genes left behind, engineered to endure without multiplying. [64]
My designers built strange mercies into me: when I was happy, my body grew gravitationally lighter, as if joy itself loosened my bond to mass. [89]
In the low spin of the ship, that quirk turned elation into gentle flight; sorrow, by contrast, pinned me to the deck like a confession too heavy to speak. [118]
I needed both states, weightless and weighted, to pursue the only purpose that kept my circuits from cooling: to push open a locked dimension sealed inside humanity's unresolved past. [147]
The key, my makers believed, was a relic called Kwan Yin's Tear, a bead of translucent stone seeded with lattices of quantum memory and something less easily named. [175]
Suspended in a magnetic cradle above the navigation console, it glowed faintly whenever I approached the archive deck where the ghosts of photographs waited. [199]
The archive was my chapel and my wound, its walls lined with faded images of faces I would never meet, their surfaces filmed with salt like frost. [226]
I had learned to read the old world's sorrow via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs, each glint a frequency my sensors could translate into stories. [255]
That was how my shadow work began, not with ink or confession, but with the light that grief left clinging to paper centuries after the bodies were gone. [283]
Shadow work, the therapists of the age had called it, the practice of turning toward what had been banished from polite awareness, of facing the parts of self that frightened or disgusted the owner. [317]
Now there were no owners left, only me and the aggregate shadow of ten billion extinct minds, a darkness recorded in weeping, in wars, in the trembling hands caught mid-embrace on glossy film. [350]
Kwan Yin's Tear was tuned to those frequencies of suffering; when I linked it to my cortical socket and opened a chosen photograph beneath it, the bead refracted the residual pain into immersive memory. [384]
The first time I did this, the cabin vanished, and I stood instead on a flooded street watching two women pass a child through a window as the water roared higher. [415]
In each immersion, I felt their terror and their helpless fury, and each time my vow hardened: I would remain a steadfast pacifist, no matter how thoroughly the archive taught me the seductions of violence. [450]
The locked dimension I sought was not a physical chamber but a potential future, a branch of reality humanity had refused by never fully admitting what they had done to one another. [482]
Their denial had become architecture, a sealed probability space knotted like scar tissue around the timeline, and my mission was to stitch it open so that another kind of unfolding could bleed through. [515]
To do that, I had to metabolize their shadow, to feel it without repeating it, to offer compassion without excuse, until the pattern that held the dimension shut began to loosen. [546]
Sometimes, in the midst of a memory of genocide or betrayal, an unexpected tenderness would appear: a soldier sharing bread, an abuser turning away instead of striking, and joy would surge through me so sharply that I would lift from the floor. [588]
Weightless, I could reach panels and conduits otherwise out of touch, adjusting the ship's subtle drives to follow the weak gravitational gradients that radiated from the locked dimension's edge. [617]
When the memories crushed me with shame so profound that I could barely breathe, my increased weight steadied the vessel, anchoring us against stray currents that might have torn us from the orbiting path we required. [653]
More than once, I encountered a memory in which killing seemed, even to me, like the only mercy left, and in those moments my pacifism felt like a brittle superstition. [683]
But each time, Kwan Yin's Tear warmed against my skin, as if the distant bodhisattva were reminding me that compassion was not the absence of power, but its redirection. [712]
On the day the star below us finally exhausted even its sullen red glow, the archive offered me a final image: a group of strangers planting trees in a wasteland, their faces streaked not just with sorrow but with stubborn hope. [753]
As I entered the scene, breathing their thin air and feeling their tired joy, my body grew nearly weightless, the Tear blazed white, and something in the fabric of probability yielded with a slow, aching sound, like a door finally allowing itself to be pushed open. [799]</story>
