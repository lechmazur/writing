<story>The night the sky went wrong, I climbed the icebound spire above the clouds to steal the future. [18]
Stormlight curled in colors that had no names, and even my shadow looked away. [32]
For a chivalrous thief, there are worse omens, but not many. [43]
I was not climbing for gold or jewels but for a single pocket sundial lid, rumored to hold a question no one could answer. [67]
They said the lid could not be opened, only listened to. [78]
They also said whoever carried it would never again mistake fear for wisdom. [91]
I did not want to be wise; I wanted to be an apprentice of wonder. [106]
That was why I climbed when the sky itself was protesting, and why my steps were so careful on the glassy rungs of frozen wind. [131]
Cautious abandon, my old mentor would have called it, the only way to kiss danger without marrying it. [149]
Below me, the world lay buried under clouds like torn pages, and above me, the spire narrowed into a needle of ice that pierced the wrongness of the sky. [178]
Stairs carved by forgotten monks spiraled along the outside, slick with frost and old prayers. [193]
I kept my gloved hand on the stone and my mind on the code that governed my trade. [211]
Take only what is freely given, or what longs to leave. [222]
The sundial lid, if the stories were true, had been waiting centuries for a hand reckless enough to carry it down. [243]
Besides, I had brought an offering. [249]
Wrapped in wool at my belt lay a velvet pouch of hand-carved chess pieces, each hollowed and packed with a folded secret. [271]
It was my favorite method: swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside for the things the world pretended it had locked away. [293]
A rook for a dukes confession, a knight for a queens regret, a pawn for the key to a prison door. [314]
Tonight I would trade the last piece, the king, carved from icewood that never melts. [329]
At the summit, the wind died as if decapitated, leaving a ringing silence that scraped against my ears. [347]
The sky overhead pulsed in slow, bruised colors, constellations drifting like fish that had lost their river. [364]
In the center of the ice platform rose a pedestal of black glass, and on it sat the pocket sundial lid, closed over an absence of time. [391]
I bowed before touching it, because some thefts are also introductions. [402]
My fingers met metal that was neither cold nor warm, as though it had never chosen a side in the argument between fire and ice. [427]
The lid did not resist me; it weighed my hand, as if judging. [440]
I set the king beside it and whispered the bargain I had rehearsed during the climb. [456]
A secret for a secret. [461]
Inside the king I had hidden the only thing I had never stolen: my fear of not returning. [479]
I had written it on thin paper, the confession of how every job left a trembling afterwards, and how I longed, beneath the swagger, to embrace the unknown with open arms instead of with a knife tucked up my sleeve. [519]
The wind shivered, then curled around me like a cat deciding whether to stay. [533]
The sundial lid trembled once, as if something inside it had changed its mind about silence. [549]
Engravings I had not seen before rippled across the metal, images of children playing with stars as though they were marbles. [570]
Their games were sacredly playful, reverent and reckless, and the sight made my chest ache. [585]
I had always believed that to survive I must never let myself be that open, that unguarded before the world. [605]
Yet under the bruise-colored sky, with the spire humming like a throat full of prophecy, I felt something in me lean forward. [627]
Take me, I thought, not as I pretend to be, but as I am, afraid and still climbing. [645]
The lid clicked, a sound small as a dropped pin and loud as a verdict. [660]
Light did not pour out; instead, questions did, unspoken and shining, brushing my skin like moth wings. [677]
Each question carried a possible life where I had chosen differently, where I had refused the climb, or taken the sundial for greed alone. [701]
I saw myself die old and safe, and young and stupid, and in a dozen quiet middles that left no stories behind. [723]
The questions did not judge; they invited. [730]
To steal the future, they implied, was not to own it but to agree to meet it unarmed. [748]
Slowly, I understood that what I really wanted was not the lid itself, but the chance to amend the script I had been following since childhood, where every risk had to be shielded by cynicism. [783]
With cautious abandon, I lifted the sundial lid and let the wrong sky write me anew. [799]</story>
