<story>The night the dead began to whisper, Elara climbed the bone stairs to the skyborne grotto under aurora. [18]
She was a beautician mortician, half artist, half priest, accustomed to softening death with rouge, silk, and carefully stitched illusions. [38]
Yet nothing in the velvet quiet of her basement parlor resembled this radiant hush trembling around the grotto in the high, frozen air. [61]
The grotto hung like a stone lantern beneath the auroral curtain, its mineral ribs glistening with frost and faint phosphorescence. [81]
Inside, the bodies waited on floating slabs of ice-rock, each wrapped in veils of spun glass that chimed whenever the lights above flickered. [104]
Elara moved between them with lucidly watchful steps, her boots silent, her breath small puffs that vanished before they fully formed. [125]
Each corpse belonged to a skyfarer whose airship had gone down in the polar storm, their contracts demanding presentation in this celestial mausoleum. [148]
The guild had summoned Elara not merely to adorn them, but for what she alone could do at the threshold of stillness. [170]
She specialized in that last impossible moment, when the body had stopped and the soul, perhaps, had not yet realized it. [191]
Her tools lay arranged on a slab of clear crystal: brushes, vials of luminescent pigments, silver needles, and a tiny emerald chip catching stray auroral flares. [217]
The chip had been cut from a meteorite jewel, rumored to remember every sky it had fallen through, rumored to drink starlight like blood. [241]
Elara needed it tonight to infuse each face with a final, honest glimmer, to capture one last spark before oblivion sealed them. [263]
She began with the youngest skyfarer, a woman whose freckles were still visible beneath the pallor, whose hands still curled as if holding invisible rigging. [288]
Elara brushed frost from the lashes and pressed the emerald chip to the girl's forehead, closing her eyes to listen. [308]
At first there was only the usual static of the dead, that faint, grainy hiss filling the spaces where breath had once moved. [331]
But Elara had trained herself to find meaning there, finding patterns in static the way navigators read storms, the way lovers read silences. [354]
Behind the hiss emerged images without color: a rope ladder whipping in gale, a compass spinning, a laugh cut short by sudden weightlessness. [377]
Elara guided them gently into the muscles of the girl's face, fingertips coaxing, as though rethreading memory through slack fibers. [397]
The lips gained a ghost of mischief, the brows relaxed from their death-fixed surprise, the cheeks remembered how to hold a rumored warmth. [420]
Not a lie of life, but a portrait of the moment just before, when fear had not yet drowned joy. [440]
Moving from slab to slab, she repeated the ritual, each time letting the emerald chip drink impressions, then drip them back as faint expressions. [464]
One old captain's face settled into stubborn serenity; another's, scarred and stern, unexpectedly softened into wonder, as if he still watched the aurora from below. [489]
The grotto grew brighter, not in light, but in intention; the dead no longer looked abandoned, but paused, waiting at some interior ledge. [512]
Outside, the aurora thickened into cascading veils, their colors spilling through fractures in the ceiling, bathing the ice-rock slabs in slow, shimmering rivers. [535]
The air changed then, pressing lightly on her eardrums, as if the grotto had inhaled, as if the sky itself held its breath. [558]
A final body waited at the center, higher than the rest, laid out beneath a fissure through which one fierce beam of emerald aurora fell. [583]
Elara recognized the profile before her mind allowed the name; the slope of nose, the chipped front tooth, the crooked scar along the jaw. [607]
Isren, the pilot who had once taught her to sleep between heartbeats, to listen for the spaces where the world stopped and started again. [631]
He had called it a threshold of stillness, that fragile hinge on which a life could turn toward terror or toward awe. [653]
Now he rested upon it in truth, caught between the storm that killed him and the nothing waiting past her reach. [674]
Her hands shook as she lifted the emerald chip, now hairline-cracked from use, warm with borrowed echoes of everyone she had touched tonight. [697]
If it failed here, if it shattered, Isren would drift away faceless into the dark, and so would the part of her he had awakened. [722]
She placed the chip over his sternum instead of his brow, aligning it with the bruised center of his silent chest. [743]
Closing her eyes, she leaned close until her forehead nearly brushed his, until their shared stillness hummed like a taut, invisible wire. [765]
In the roaring quiet behind her ears, the static surged, then split, resolving into a single clear tone that rose like breath returning. [788]</story>
