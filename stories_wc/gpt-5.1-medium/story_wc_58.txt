<story>The last ship sailed at dawn, leaving the harbor bare as a stripped altar. [14]
I watched its receding wake from the cliffs and knew my work would begin only after its vanishing. [32]
The city preferred its departures clean that way, stories sealed with a neat horizon line. [47]
I am their traveler, their collector of unfinished endings, the one who writes obituaries for the living. [64]
I arrive only after the last ship sails, when absence becomes an ache sharp enough to name. [81]
On this assignment, that ache led me inland to a shadowed garden in autumn behind the abandoned palace. [99]
The garden walls were high enough to hide grief, low enough to invite the wind to trespass. [116]
Here lived Lady Sera, who had not set foot beyond the palace gates in seven years. [132]
To petition my services, she sent not a letter but a parcel wrapped in silk the color of dried blood. [152]
Inside lay a single palace carpet weft thread, still smelling faintly of smoke and chrysanthemums. [167]
The enclosed note bore only three words in a cramped, decisive hand: explain my absences. [182]
Explained absences are the strangest commissions, because they ask me to write of the spaces around a life, not the life itself. [204]
Still, I went, following the thin red thread like a line on a map meant for ghosts. [221]
The garden waited in a hush of lonesome splendor, fountains dry, bronze nymphs crusted with leaves, roses bowing beneath their own unpruned abundance. [244]
Lady Sera received me beneath a pergola draped in browned vines, her cloak the same somber red as the thread. [264]
She did not offer her hand; instead, she sat close enough that her silence brushed against my skin, an intimate greeting by projecting presence alone. [289]
Your task is peculiar, she said, but then, so is mine. [300]
I asked what she wished me to write. [308]
Not my death, she replied, my disappearances. [315]
They say I am mad, or cursed, or simply cruel to those who wait, but none of that is accurate. [335]
I withdraw because I am attempting to understand the geography of healing, and each absence is a pilgrimage into an unmapped interior country. [358]
Her words stirred something familiar; my own travels were nothing but cartography of wounds drawn across roads and harbors. [377]
Tell me where you go when they say you have vanished, I said, taking out my notebook of thin blue pages. [398]
She gestured toward the garden paths, their gravel silvered with fallen birch leaves. [411]
When the palace still hosted balls, the carpets inside were woven by my mother, she began, fingers resting on the thread in my palm. [435]
She showed me once how every weft thread must pass invisibly beneath a pattern, holding its brightness from below, like breath. [456]
When she died, her last carpet remained unfinished, and I realized I had no map for sorrow, only corridors. [475]
So I began leaving, not to escape but to walk the unseen threads, the places beneath appearances where hurt and hope entwine. [497]
Sometimes I vanish into the servants quarters, listening from behind walls until a sob becomes a story instead of a sound. [518]
Sometimes I lock myself in the music room and play the same four notes until their echo stops hurting. [537]
And once each year, after the last ship sails, I walk this garden until dusk, measuring how far I can go without fleeing myself. [561]
These are my absences; they are not refusals but experiments, she said, eyes fixed on the brittle roseheads. [579]
I write for those who stay, I answered, but I cannot praise a vanishing unless I know what it seeks. [599]
Help me walk it, she replied, and I understood that this commission was less an obituary than a shared excursion. [619]
We rose and followed the oldest path, where moss had begun to erase the stones, softening their insistence on direction. [639]
As we walked, she named each place not by its history but by the pain it had once contained. [658]
Here, she said, my brother struck the gardener; there, a messenger collapsed with news of war deferred, not ended. [677]
Her voice grew vividly descriptive, etching invisible topographies of regret and tenderness that hovered over the gravel like low mist. [697]
By the time we circled back to the pergola, the garden lights had not been lit, and dusk pooled thick between the trees. [720]
You see, she murmured, nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern, and we pretend it is gone because we fear following. [742]
I knew then how to write her obituary, not as an ending but as a map of explained absences, charting every place she dared to feel alone. [769]
When I left at last, the harbor was dark, yet I carried her presence like a lantern. [786]</story>
