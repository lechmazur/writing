<story>By the time the moon reached its narrowest edge, the glade was already awake. [14]
Midnight pooled in the grass like ink, and below the cliff a sea of clouds shone faintly. [31]
Lysander, the onyx-ink cartomancer, stood at the center of the clearing, shuffling his black cards. [46]
He had climbed to this midnight glade above clouds only hours after the birth of his daughter. [63]
They said the slope was dangerous, but he had come anyway, to find where lost time accumulates. [80]
The air was thin and savage with stars, so beautiful it made his throat tighten painfully. [96]
He was willingly perplexed by nights like this, grateful for mysteries that refused to be solved quickly. [113]
Tonight the clouds themselves felt like an altar, waiting to receive the weight of cloudbound repentance. [129]
Lysander feared that every second he spent reading cards for strangers had stolen seconds from his child. [146]
He wanted to ask the sky where those stolen moments hid, and whether they could ever be returned. [164]
His deck was heavy with onyx dust and river-silted ink, every card veined like polished stone. [180]
He cut the deck and let three cards fall on the moss, each landing with a soft, decisive sigh. [199]
The first showed a child staring at a dolls' tea set saucer crack, seeing in that thin fracture a future. [219]
He recognized the room from the faded walls and the tablecloth patterned with looping, awkward outlines of hands. [237]
It was his mother's kitchen, where every birthday they kept a family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths. [256]
He saw his own small palm there, sketched in blue ink, forever five years old, never growing, never late. [275]
The second card showed a woman in a hospital bed, hair slick with sweat, eyes unfocused from the effort of birth. [296]
He flinched, knowing the angle of her cheekbones, the way her mouth pressed sideways when she tried not to scream. [316]
He had kissed that mouth only hours ago, whispered that he would be back before dawn, after the birth settled. [336]
Yet here he was on the mountain, counting clouds instead of breaths, chasing answers instead of holding them. [354]
The third card was blank except for a narrow silver line running from top to bottom, like a rope or a crack in heaven. [378]
Lysander knew it meant a path, but not whether it climbed or fell, only that it divided then refused to heal. [399]
Wind rolled through the glade, thinning the clouds below until they became separate islands, each one waiting for a penitent. [419]
He wondered if every regret he had ever refused to feel had condensed there, becoming a weather system of cloudbound repentance. [440]
The cold finally reached his bones, and he knelt to unfasten the worn leather case that held his childhood mementos. [460]
From it he drew a folded strip of birthday tablecloth, its fabric stiff with old wax, his smallest hand traced near the edge. [483]
Beside the cloth lay a shard of porcelain from the dolls' tea set saucer crack, the break that had ended his childhood party. [506]
He saw again the cup slipping, the sauce of berries spilling like blood, his mother snapping that there was no more time for games. [530]
In that moment he had believed her, and the years since had felt like standing outside his own life, watching where time went. [553]
He pressed the torn cloth into the moss and laid his adult hand over the ghost of his child's outline, fingers not quite matching. [577]
When he breathed, the silver line on the third card brightened, and the clouds below surged upward like a tide of luminous ash. [600]
The glade dissolved, leaving him standing on a narrow bridge of mist, suspended above whirlpools of scenes he half remembered. [620]
Every missed bedtime, every postponed visit, every reading done for someone else instead of for himself spun slowly below, catching starfire. [641]
He understood then that lost time did not vanish; it circled patiently, waiting for him to recognize its shape and step toward it. [664]
With a sob that hurt like swallowing glass, he gathered the cards, the cloth, the porcelain shard, and turned back down the mountain. [687]
He could not reclaim the hours already spent, but he could meet the dawn beside his daughter and begin to pay them back. [710]</story>
