<story>The mountain bookstore did not have doors so much as sudden absences in stone, like pages torn from granite. [19]
People climbed toward it along switchback paths, books fluttering in the wind from its carved balconies like uneasy birds. [38]
Some came for bargains, others for miracles, but I came because remembering had begun to hurt more than forgetting. [57]
By then it was after remembering had become painful, when every old street in my mind ended in rubble. [76]
I hoped the bookstore might loan me a different past, one with softer edges and fewer ghosts. [93]
At the threshold an old woman waited, her eyes silvered like mercury-glass, reflecting me in a hundred shaken fragments. [112]
She called herself the mercury-glass seer and admitted patrons only if their reasons for entering matched the books that wanted them. [133]
Her voice scraped like a page turned too many times. [143]
Why are you here, memory-burdened child, she asked, though I was nearly thirty and taller than her bent shoulders. [162]
To understand the shape of home, I answered, surprised to hear the words before I knew I believed them. [181]
Home had been bombed into a geometry of absences, its corners and corridors existing only in the ache behind my ribs. [202]
She nodded, as though the answer matched some private index entry, and motioned me inside with a hand that shook like thin paper. [225]
Inside, the bookstore corkscrewed upward through the mountain, staircases folding over each other, shelves leaning like overgrown trees thirsting for readers. [246]
Lanterns hung at strange heights, their light tinted through stained pages pasted over glass, so the air itself read like marginalia. [267]
Every corridor changed when you looked away, so the map she pressed into my palm was drawn in moving ink that wriggled like shy eels. [292]
This place substitutes reality nightly, she said, almost kindly; our aisles reorder themselves with each moonrise to suit the dreams of unread stories. [315]
If you stay past closing, you may never find the exit that remembers you. [329]
I promised nothing, which felt safer than promising to leave. [339]
The map led me lower, away from the chatter of visible books, into stacks where titles hid their letters like shy teeth. [361]
Here the air was thick and cool, touched by the underground spring that supposedly fed ink to the whole mountain. [381]
I followed the sound of dripping water until it became the soft irregular tapping of something small knocking patiently against glass. [402]
In a niche carved directly into the rock, I found a single display case, dusty but fiercely locked, containing a stone the size of my palm. [428]
The stone was engraved with characters I did not recognize, crisp and deep despite the dust, as if freshly cut into forgetting. [450]
Lost language, said a slip of paper beneath the glass; donor unknown; rumored to seed new tongues in those who listen closely. [472]
When I leaned closer, the glass felt to my fingers like the texture of a feather, all ghosted friction and secret direction. [494]
I stroked along that invisible grain, and the lock clicked open as if persuaded rather than forced. [511]
The stone was warm, almost pulse-warm, though no veins crossed its surface. [523]
When I cupped it, voices unfurled inside my skull like banners loosened in a buried wind. [539]
They were not my languages, yet every sound pressed against the sore places of memory as if testing for hidden doors. [560]
Images spilled after them, not of words but of hands teaching, of grandparents breathing stories into infants, of villages mapping home in shared syllables. [584]
I realized the stone was not offering me a new language but demanding that I remember the one I had buried. [605]
Not the language of my childhood country, but the private dialect of my family, the ridiculous nicknames, the mispronounced recipes, the lullabies half hummed. [629]
I had smothered them under perfect grammar in a foreign tongue, ashamed of how crooked they sounded between my teeth. [649]
Now they rose, shy and luminous, called up by the lost language stone as if by a patient conductor. [668]
The air around me thickened, the shelves retreating into shadow; only the stone and the pain in my chest remained in focus. [690]
I understood then that my talents for forgetting, my careful erasures and accentless sentences, were not survival but burial. [709]
The stone demanded I reverse the process, unearth the words, seed them back into the soil of my mouth. [728]
I began to speak aloud, first in broken phrases, then in the full, awkward music I had abandoned, each sentence cracking open a sealed room inside me. [755]
Somewhere above, a storm moved over the mountain, its thunder muffled by miles of shelving, yet every distant rumble echoed inside my bones. [778]
Hidden thunder, I thought, like grief, like love, like the shape of home returning in the language that named every room. [799]</story>
