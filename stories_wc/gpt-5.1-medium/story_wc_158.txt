<story>The first time the waves woke him, the moon was missing. [11]
In the gargantuan shell where he lived, nights rarely noticed absence. [22]
But for an insomniac poet, even a missing moon screamed. [32]
He rose from his hammock of woven kelp and listening ink. [43]
The corridors of the shell thrummed softly, barnacles pulsing like metronomes. [54]
Water-light filtered through spiral windows, casting reef-shadow joy along the walls. [65]
Joy, because the city still breathed; shadow, because it still hurt. [76]
He had vowed long ago to photosynthesize pain into beauty. [86]
Tonight, the ache of the missing moon demanded more careful tending. [97]
He gathered his notebook, his rusted telescope, and the galaxy postcard. [108]
The postcard was older than the tide-maps, older than his name. [119]
On its bent surface, a spiral of distant stars wheeled patiently. [130]
On the back, in fading ink, his grandmother had written instructions. [141]
When the world goes dark, follow this sky where it hides. [152]
Tonight, with the moon gone, that sentence felt less like nostalgia than map. [165]
He moved through the spiral streets, shyly unstoppable in his determination. [176]
Neighbors nodded from doorways carved into the shell, their lanterns jellyfish-bright. [187]
They knew his midnight wanderings, the poems he murmured to algae. [198]
They trusted his peculiar vocation, even if they understood almost nothing. [209]
At the outermost chamber, where the shell opened to the sea, he stopped. [222]
Beyond, the water was a heavy blue bruise, restless yet expectant. [233]
The moon should have lain there, silvering the surface like spilled milk. [245]
Instead, the horizon yawned blank, as if someone had erased light. [256]
He placed the galaxy postcard on the threshold and knelt beside it. [268]
The card glowed faintly, reacting to ancient starlight remembered in its ink. [280]
He unfolded his notebook, but instead of writing, he began to hum. [292]
It was the lullaby his grandmother sang when insomnia gnawed his childhood. [304]
She had promised that words could curl around a wound like moss. [316]
Now he sang it to the sea, and the sea frowned. [327]
The notes were imperfect, wandering, carried via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind. [341]
The wind slipped through the shell openings, worrying barnacles and brittle stars. [353]
Each word he sang felt like a seed, small but stubborn. [364]
He imagined them drifting out over the black water, searching. [374]
He imagined the sky listening, embarrassed by its own sudden absence. [385]
In his chest, an old phrase unfurled: the blossom armistice. [395]
It was a legend from the shallow reefs, told in hushed bubbles. [407]
Once, they said, warfare between seasons had nearly torn the tides apart. [419]
Winter refused to release its grip; spring refused to stop blooming. [430]
The truce came when flowers agreed to carry both frost and fragrance. [442]
That agreement, the blossom armistice, allowed beauty and sorrow to coexist. [453]
Tonight he sought a similar treaty between the shell and the sky. [465]
His voice rose, shyly unstoppable now, weaving promises for any listening void. [477]
If you return, moon, we will forgive your bright cruelty. [487]
Shine on our sleeplessness, but let us keep our shadows. [497]
Drench us in tides, but leave space for quiet darkness between. [508]
His words drifted outward, and something unexpected stirred in the water. [519]
Tiny polyps emerged from coral cracks, opening tentative petals of bone. [530]
They blossomed in slow motion, pale and luminous, like underwater lanterns. [541]
He had never seen coral bloom at night, nor answer a song. [553]
The sea, usually indifferent, seemed to be hemming closer to listen. [564]
Petal after petal unfolded along the reef, forming a path of light. [576]
At its end, the water rose like a curtain, shimmering. [586]
Behind it, tucked just below the surface, the missing moon waited. [597]
Not stolen, he realized, only clouds that tried to ensconce it. [608]
The coral path pulsed, urging him to complete the negotiation. [618]
He lifted the galaxy postcard, holding it up like an alternate sky. [630]
These stars have watched us across centuries of longing, he whispered. [641]
They do not vanish when we disappoint them; they wait. [651]
Be like them, moon; return, and we will accept your phases. [662]
The water shivered, then stilled, and the sulking clouds thinned reluctantly. [673]
Silver bled through, hesitant at first, then pouring in gentle astonishment. [684]
The moon slipped from its hiding, settling back into the sky above. [696]
Its light struck the gargantuan shell, turning barnacles to coins and windows to halos. [710]
The blooming coral dimmed, satisfied, storing the truce in their calcified hearts. [722]
He felt his own heart follow, ensconcing the night in patient verse. [734]
Back in his room, he wrote until dawn, lines curling like tendrils. [746]
Each poem was a small treaty, a blossom armistice between sleeplessness and peace. [759]
Outside, the city within the shell slept easier, rocked by restored tides. [771]
Inside, the insomniac poet finally lay down, cradled by reef-shadow joy. [782]</story>
