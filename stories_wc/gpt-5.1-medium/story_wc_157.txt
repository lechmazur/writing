<story>By the time thoughts became taxable, I was already smuggling questions for a living. [14]
It is less lucrative than it sounds, but far more entertaining. [25]
The Ministry lists me as Arlen Quill, minor historian; my friends call me a charming rogue scholar, which is kinder and closer to the truth. [50]
Tonight I wait inside the city entomologist's greenhouse, where the air hums with wings and illegal ideas. [67]
Rows of glass terrariums glow like bottled moons, and beetles click against their enclosures like impatient typewriters. [84]
We chose this place for our secret language club because the insects provide plausible background noise for forbidden meanings. [103]
Also, the entomologist owes me three favors and pretends not to notice when we rearrange her watering schedule. [121]
Mara arrives first, slipping between fern fronds, her satchel stuffed with ruled notebooks and a single gourd rattle seed that ticks faintly when she moves. [146]
The seed is our newest instrument, a dry little heart that shakes out syllables no algorithm can yet decode. [165]
Behind her comes Jin, carrying soil samples and a tray of labeled seedlings like an overworked altar boy at the church of chlorophyll. [188]
He nods once, businesslike, but his eyes glitter with the same converging chaos that has been gathering over our city for months. [210]
Every week the Ministry adjusts the Thought Tariff, charging more for concepts deemed destabilizing, discounting those that keep minds obedient and dull. [232]
Curiosity recently doubled; irony is now a luxury item; dissent costs more than most people will earn in their lifetimes. [252]
Our club formed not out of nostalgia for word games, but to stand guard over your own spark of defiance, the tiny taxed ember inside every skull. [279]
That is our shared vow, spoken in a dialect we designed to sound candidly cryptic, as if we are confessing and concealing at the same time. [305]
Tonight we are upgrading from whispered ciphers to something slower and stranger, a language that can warp the city without a single illegal word. [329]
I unroll the map on the potting bench, brushing aside spilled soil and a curious mantis that swivels its head as if already taking notes. [354]
The map shows every community garden in the city, small rectangles of sanctioned greenness wedged between surveilled streets and apartment blocks. [375]
According to law, their plantings must follow Ministry guidelines for optimal nutritional yield and emotional compliance. [391]
According to us, they are blank pages. [398]
Mara taps a corner of the map where six gardens form a rough spiral around the river. [415]
If we join these community gardens to plant message patterns, arranging blooms and beetle friendly herbs in our chosen sequences, anyone looking down from a rooftop or drone will be reading a sentence they do not yet know exists. [454]
Color, height, flowering time, insect density, even the gaps between beds, all become our alphabet. [469]
Jin adds that the entomologist's greenhouse will serve as our grammar school, the place where we test which arrangements attract which species and for how long. [495]
Beetles for verbs, bees for questions, moths for warnings that must glide into dreams. [509]
It sounds romantic until you remember that the Ministry audits every seed purchase and cross checks it against your declared mental budget. [531]
Buying too many flowers associated with longing or revolt can trigger a recalculation, and suddenly you owe tax on emotions you have never dared to feel. [557]
That is where I come in, with my forged permits and my habit of speaking in footnotes when prosecutors demand simple answers. [579]
While Jin negotiates with gardeners and Mara calibrates our lexicon, I warp the paper trail, bending our purchases through dummy collectives and research grants the Ministry is too embarrassed to admit it does not understand. [614]
In return, the gardeners get soil improvements, rare seeds smuggled inside boring legal ones, and a quiet sense that something rebellious is rooting beneath the surface. [640]
They do not know the sentences they are helping us write, only that strangers visit with shovels and questions and leave with empty notebooks and dirty knees. [667]
One night, as we test a prototype phrase made of marigolds and mealworms, the entomologist herself steps from the shadows, a clipboard shield in her trembling hands. [694]
For a long moment nobody speaks; the insects do it for us, droning and skittering in chords that sound suspiciously like an argument about courage. [719]
Finally she lowers the clipboard and says that when thoughts became taxable, her students stopped asking why butterflies migrate and started asking how much curiosity costs per hour. [747]
She tells us to keep the lights off after midnight, to label our experiments as pest control, and to save her a seat in whatever sentence we are writing across the gardens. [779]
So we work, while the city sleeps, and a quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams. [795]</story>
