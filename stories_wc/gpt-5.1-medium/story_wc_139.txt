<story>The first body I ever prepared belonged to my father, who taught half the city how to lie. [18]
He was a small time con artist with big time charm and a ledger full of ruined lives. [36]
I was his honest child, the one who held the coats while he vanished wallets and wedding rings. [54]
Now I work nights in the prep room of the Mercy Street Funeral Home, where nothing can be pickpocketed anymore. [74]
The air hums with formaldehyde and whispers, a kind of deathly vitality that never quite lets me sleep. [92]
Tonight, between one corpse and the next, I am supposed to calculate the price of my fathers last trick. [111]
If I get it right, my mother and I will earn political asylum, a fair trade for everything he stole. [131]
The officials from the consulate are coming at dawn to take his confession, locked in numbers instead of words. [150]
That is why his body lies on my metal table, naked under the fluorescents, a puzzle cooled to room temperature. [170]
Beside his stiff hand rests his old vintage ink pot, salvaged from our apartment before the creditors swarmed. [188]
The ink inside looks ordinary, but my father swore it liquefies rigid thinking, turning stubborn minds into wet clay. [207]
He said every crime has a repayment hidden in it, and that the right equation could balance any account. [226]
That equation is my inheritance, more fragile than money, more dangerous than the knives hanging sterile beside me. [244]
The consulate wants proof that my father was not just a thief but an architect of the regime he served. [264]
They want numbers: account routes, shell corporations, the precise breach where stolen public funds slid quietly into private coffins. [283]
In exchange, they offer my mother and me a new country where no one will recognize our last name. [302]
The trick is that my father died before giving them the key, leaving only me, the honest child, to finish the job. [324]
Honest does not mean clean, only that my lies, when I tell them, are told in pursuit of the truth. [344]
So I stand over his body and wait, not passively, but in the way he taught me to wait for a mark. [366]
Waiting actively means watching every detail, every twitch in the world, until the shape of the pattern steps forward. [385]
His chest is open from the autopsy, sewn poorly by a hurried doctor; I unpick the stitches with a scalpel. [405]
The cavity is a quiet red cavern, organs bagged and numbered, but something shifts beneath the plastic like a thought. [425]
I find a thin metal cylinder taped along his spine, exactly where no respectful mortician would slice. [442]
Inside the cylinder is a roll of paper dense with equations, arrows, and symbols I recognize from his notebooks. [461]
Ink has bled at the edges, but the center is dry, waiting like a locked safe for the right combination. [481]
I unstopper the vintage ink pot, touch a brush to the surface, and feel the way my thoughts loosen. [500]
Ideas slide and rearrange, numbers no longer cliffs but rivers, and suddenly the symbols on the paper begin to speak. [520]
He has mapped every theft, each embezzled fund, as coordinates in a geometric lattice whose center is labeled Fair Trade. [540]
According to his mathematics, a life ruined by fraud can be balanced only by sheltering another life from persecution. [559]
Ten families deported, ten families hidden; three politicians bribed, three whistleblowers smuggled; each sin paired with a mercy. [577]
The final line is an unfinished equation, its answer marked not with a number but with my initial. [595]
He wanted me to decide what would balance his last account: my mothers freedom, or the exposure of his crimes. [615]
If I hand over everything, they will grant us political asylum, but the network he built to move money will crumble. [636]
If I hold back a piece, the stream of stolen funds can be redirected instead of stopped, feeding hidden refugees for decades. [658]
My fathers ink eats through my certainty, liquefying the rigid categories of guilt and innocence I once clung to. [677]
I rinse my hands, stitch his chest closed, and write my own equation in the margin of his. [695]
Half the numbers for the consulate, half for a ghost network of couriers who will move people instead of cash. [715]
It is a breach, but a chosen one, a cut I make with eyes open in the flesh of his design. [736]
This, I decide, is the mathematics of a fair trade: not symmetry, but a living imbalance that favors the broken. [756]
As dawn seeps through the prep room blinds, my father lies still, yet his last trick breathes on in different lungs. [777]</story>
