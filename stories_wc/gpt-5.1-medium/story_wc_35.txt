<story>At the close of an unspoken dream, Rafi woke to the smell of wet stone and cumin. [17]
The desert fortress after rain felt like a chest exhaling, its adobe ribs darkened and sighing. [33]
He was the fortress chef who could taste memories, and the morning's first flavor was regret steeped in cardamom. [52]
Rafi moved through the kitchens with a sturdy brittle calm, careful not to brush against any bare skin. [70]
Here, the staff were emotionally contagious through touch, and a single accidental graze could flood him with another life. [89]
He had learned to keep his hands tucked into his sleeves, as monks did with dangerous prayers. [106]
He cooked to sandpaper rough memories, to file them down into something tongues could bear and stomachs could hold. [125]
Every pot of stew, every pan of flatbread carried stored remorse like ash mixed into the flour. [142]
Outside the central courtyard, the rain had collected in shallow depressions, making transient tidal pools on the flagstones. [160]
Rafi knelt beside them, analyzing tidal pool formations as if they were tea leaves spread in miniature oceans. [178]
The patterns told him how the fortress would taste that day, where the hurt would concentrate. [194]
Today, the water ringed itself around a single cracked tile, circling it like an accusation. [209]
Beneath that tile, he knew, lay the stairway to the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes. [225]
It was a secret frozen hall where the fortress stored what it dared not speak, layered in salt and silence. [245]
On mornings like this, when the dream's taste still clung to his tongue, he descended to check the stock of sorrow. [266]
The fortress itself seemed only half awake, as if still at the close of an unspoken dream. [283]
Rafi pried up the tile, fingers careful, and cold air breathed out like a long-kept secret. [299]
The stairs spiraled down through sandstone and ancient sea shells, each step humming faintly with remembered storms. [316]
At the bottom, the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes bloomed outward, a reef arrested midwave and sealed in frost. [336]
Translucent tables rose from the floor like anemones; within them, colors swirled, bruised and luminous. [351]
Each table held dishes of stored remorse, crystallized into jagged shards that chimed when the air shifted. [368]
Rafi's job was to taste these shards, to decide which could be shaved into the day's menu and which must remain buried. [390]
He lifted one piece with tongs, but even through the metal he felt the quiver of a woman's unspoken apology. [410]
When he pressed it to his tongue, her memory burst: a slap delivered in panic, the sting echoing for years. [430]
The regret flooded him, threatening to subsume his own quieter guilts, and he braced one hand against the frozen coral. [450]
The coral was emotionally contagious through touch, cold nerves running from the pavilion into his skin like invasive roots. [469]
He closed his eyes and imagined again the tidal pool formations, the way water chose hollows but never forgot the sea. [490]
He let the woman's remorse pass through him in slow eddies, scouring but not settling, as if he were only stone. [511]
This shard, he decided, could be sanded down; a pinch would lend a necessary ache to the evening's lentil stew. [531]
He scraped its edges against a grater of ancient bone, caught the iridescent dust in a vial, and returned the core to rest. [554]
Another table showed a darker clotted memory, so dense the frost around it had cracked. [569]
He tasted only a grain and staggered back as a soldier's massacre roared through him, sand and blood and burning dates. [590]
No meal could carry that; no palate should bear it, not even his. [603]
With shaking hands he sealed the shard deeper into the coral, letting fresh ice grow over its furious color. [622]
When he climbed back to the kitchens, the clouds had burned off, leaving the courtyard pools already shrinking. [640]
He worked through the day with a sturdy brittle focus, measuring spices against the remembered weights of sorrow. [658]
Into the lentil stew he dropped exactly three grains of the softened remorse, watching it dissolve into the simmering surface. [678]
That night, the garrison ate in an unusual hush, spoons pausing midair as if each soldier were listening inward. [697]
Later, Rafi watched their faces soften, heard laughter catch then resume, like blades dulled just enough not to draw blood. [717]
He knew the memories were not erased, only sandpapered at the edges, their sharpest corners worn into something almost bearable. [737]
When he finally lay down on his narrow cot, the taste of the day still on his tongue, the fortress returned to its own uneasy sleep, waiting for the next rain to stir what lay frozen below. [774]</story>
