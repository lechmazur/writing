<story>The tea platform drifted on a slab of rock above the cloud sea, humming softly in the saturated hush. [19]
Lan knelt at its center, robes pooled like ink, fingers trembling around a chipped porcelain cup. [35]
He was only a budding rune scholar, yet the old master had chosen him for this impossible ceremony. [53]
Above them, motes of tea steam spiraled into patterns that hinted at glyphs he had not yet learned to read. [73]
The air was a breath between storms, too still, as if the sky pressed its ear against their fragile world. [93]
One stray gust would shove the floating rock tea ceremony platform into the thunderheads lurking a short distance below. [112]
On the lacquered tray before Lan lay a crow quill trimmed tip, gleaming blacker than the storm shadows. [130]
Its shaft was hollowed for ink, but today it held only the breath of his own unease. [147]
When Lan was frightened, his thoughts did not race; they crystallized when stressed, forming clear, cold shards of memory. [166]
Each shard caught some past humiliation, some scar of failure carved into the softer stone of his childhood. [184]
He had come to this ceremony not for promotion, not for praise, but to transform scars into stories. [202]
Master Sui poured water from a hovering kettle; the stream arced sideways, ignoring gravity as if obeying older rules. [221]
The leaves in Lan's cup unfurled like tiny ink dragons, their fragrance thickening the silence between claps of distant thunder. [241]
The master raised two fingers, and the world seemed to pause; everything that mattered would happen during a held breath. [261]
You will write your first living rune, the master murmured, by revisiting youthful superstitions and laying them bare upon the air. [282]
His voice wrapped around Lan like steam, gentle yet scalding where it touched old fears. [297]
You will not banish them, Sui continued, but shed their husks so their living cores may speak. [314]
Lan dipped the crow quill trimmed tip into the surface of his tea, disturbing the reflection of his narrow, scarred face. [335]
Thin ripples raced outward, brushing the edges of the platform, where carved talismans flickered awake in faint blue light. [354]
Lan's first memory-shard rose: a village lane, muddy, boys circling him, chanting that his birthmark was a demon's thumbprint. [373]
Shame had once burned hotter than any brand, convincing him to hide his left cheek behind hair, collars, and turned shoulders. [394]
Now, in the saturated hush, he traced a trembling curve through steam, shaping the rune for Face and Flame intertwined. [414]
His fear crystallized when stressed, but the shards this time arranged themselves into deliberate facets, guiding his hand along invisible lines. [435]
The glowing stroke hung in the air, a ribbon of vapor threaded with faint symbols that fluttered like trapped moths. [455]
Lan exhaled, and with that breath he released the old superstition that his mark was a curse instead of a compass. [476]
The rune brightened, then settled into a thin scar of light hanging just above his cup, humming in sympathy with his pulse. [498]
Good, Master Sui said, though his lips hardly moved, as if speech might jolt the delicate balance of clouds and rock. [519]
Again. [520]
Another shard surfaced: young Lan sitting alone in the granary, whispering to the mice because adults dismissed his questions as bad luck. [542]
They had warned him that naming patterns in spilled grain would call famine, so he had counted silently, ashamed of his curiosity. [564]
Lan lifted the quill and drew looping spirals, evoking grain scatter and mouse trails, the rune for Question bound to Plenty. [585]
For a moment, during a held breath that seemed to stretch from his childhood granary to this skyborne altar, nothing moved. [606]
Then the new rune flared gold, and warmth seeped into his hands, into the cringing places behind his ribs. [625]
His scars, outer and inner, did not vanish; they rearranged, aligning with the shapes he had written, becoming margins instead of wounds. [647]
The platform creaked as a testing gust shoved at it, and the tethering chains sang, but the ceremony did not break. [668]
Lan realized the storm below was not moving away; it circled patiently, waiting for the moment his new runes faltered. [688]
This was only a breath between storms, he understood; future tempests would test whether these stories could hold their shapes. [708]
Yet he felt ready to meet them, not as a boy hiding behind omens, but as a scribe bearing luminous scars. [729]
Master Sui nodded once, and the platform began descending through mist, their small circle of light slowly shedding height toward the waiting world. [752]
Lan cradled his cup as if it were an inkwell of weather, every swirling leaf a story he had yet to write. [774]</story>
