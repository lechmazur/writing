<story>The first time the port declared him dead, he barely noticed. [11]
Paperwork washed through offices like rainwater through rusted gutters, and names dissolved. [23]
He walked out of the hospital with someone elses death certificate anyway. [35]
Later, a clerk called to apologize for the error, but he kept the copy. [49]
He studied it like a mirror that refused to return a face. [61]
From that day, he decided his name was provisional, a placeholder. [72]
He moved to the port city where containers towered in crooked aisles of steel. [86]
From the highway, the stacks looked like frozen waves, a manufactured cliff of cargo. [100]
Inside the towering labyrinth of shipping containers, sound traveled strangely, folding and echoing. [113]
He rented a narrow room above a customs office and began listening. [125]
He had discovered he filters reality differently, through misfiled forms and overheard breaths. [138]
Other people saw containers, cranes, and ships; he saw layers of abandoned stories. [151]
At night, trucks grumbled, chains clanged, and the tide inhaled and exhaled dark water. [165]
He timed his walks through the maze across the rhythm of tides. [177]
The city seemed to breathe with the sea, forgetting and remembering each shipment. [190]
His work was simple, though no one had hired him and no contract existed. [204]
He walked the aisles and layered sound over sight, rumor over rust. [216]
He was, by accident and then by choice, an archivist of erased histories. [229]
He gathered his material by collecting fragments of overheard stories from dockworkers and passersby. [243]
Voices floated through container walls, telling of stowaways, lost cargo, debts, and quiet betrayals. [257]
He wrote nothing down, afraid ink would pin the stories into lies. [269]
Instead, he let them soak into him, layering like paint over his missing name. [283]
In a market near the docks, he found the label from poison bottle displayed under cracked glass. [300]
The seller said it came from a ship that vanished between one manifest and the next. [316]
No wreck, no survivors, just a missing line of numbers in a database. [329]
He bought the label and pinned it above his bed, an emblem of disappeared facts. [344]
He understood that a mistake on paper could erase a ship or a person. [358]
He was a death certificate error survivor, living proof that bureaucracy could misplace a soul. [373]
At dawn, when fog smudged the cranes, he walked among stacked containers listening for himself. [388]
Sometimes he thought he heard his erased life speaking in the foreign curses of sailors. [403]
Sometimes it was in the quick click of a lock, opened then closed again. [417]
He did not know his original profession, or if he had loved anyone. [430]
The death certificate carried a name, but it felt like an alias borrowed from a stranger. [446]
He decided that to discover the texture of memories, he had to forget chronology. [460]
Dates belonged to governments; textures belonged to tides, metal, and breath on cold mornings. [474]
So he layered each overheard fragment with a physical sensation: salt smell, diesel hum, gull cries. [490]
A woman laughing in Spanish became the roughness of rope between his fingers. [503]
A whispered threat in the dark became the metallic taste of blood he could not trace. [519]
Slowly, his body became an index of other lives, cross referenced by scars and shivers. [534]
He wondered if his own past now lived dispersed in strangers, as a word here, a gesture there. [552]
Perhaps someone in another city woke with a sudden taste of salt and his childhood flooded them. [569]
One evening, a container swung overhead, and from inside came a voice calling his paper name. [585]
The syllables struck him like hail; he clutched the rusted ladder and listened. [598]
The voice was reading a list, boxes checked, items approved, no space left for a life. [614]
When the crane set the container down, the voice stopped, and only waves answered. [628]
He returned to his room and stared at the poison label until the letters blurred. [643]
What antidote existed for a life officially concluded yet stubbornly continuing to breathe? [656]
He realized he did not want his old story back, only a way to be unfinished on purpose. [674]
So he wrote a new certificate on the back of the poison label, in pencil. [689]
Date of death, he wrote, was pending, revised daily by tides and passing voices. [703]
Under cause, he wrote, erased histories accumulating beyond the reach of any archive. [716]
For name, he left a blank line, spacious as the harbor at low tide. [730]
He lay down beneath the label, listening as the port shuffled and sighed around him. [745]
In the nameless dark, layered with other peoples memories, he let the next story begin. [760]</story>
