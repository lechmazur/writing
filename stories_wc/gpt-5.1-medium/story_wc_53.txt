<story>After the carousel halts, the lagoon finally remembers how to be still. [12]
Its surface is a skin of mirrored gears, each wave turning some hidden axle in the clouds below. [30]
I stand at the edge of the kinetic lagoon, scavenging for reflections that have fallen out of time. [48]
They call me a resolute scavenger, but resolve is only what remains when all the better things erode. [66]
Ambitions go first; the lagoon sands them down, grain by grain, until they are smooth enough to skip. [84]
What is left in me is not hope, just the shape of eroded ambitions I am still learning to read. [104]
I am chronologically confused, my memories shelved in no order the living mind would recognize. [119]
Some days I remember the end of my life more clearly than the day it began. [135]
Today I have come for something specific, though the words for it keep rearranging themselves. [150]
I have come to negotiate with my own ghost. [159]
To negotiate with ones own ghost, you must first know what you lost and when you truly lost it. [178]
The only method I trust is this: I gather myself back together by collecting fragments of overheard stories. [196]
The lagoon is full of them, words that slip from gondolas of passing dreamers and sink like coins. [214]
Each morning, after the carousel halts and the music withdraws into its brass lungs, I begin my trawl. [232]
Seagulls of clockwork and steam wheel overhead, their wings ticking, their shadows cutting the light into panels. [249]
From the shallows I retrieve a disposable camera wheel, its plastic teeth crusted with salt and sky-dust. [266]
Someone once turned this with damp, eager fingers, believing every click preserved a future worth seeing. [282]
Now the negatives inside are fogged, scene after scene smeared into a continuous gray hesitation. [297]
I pocket the wheel, feeling its circle echo the one that used to spin beneath my ribs. [314]
My ghost is patient, but patience is not the same as forgiveness. [326]
It waits at the center of the lagoon where the gears turn fastest and the water looks most like glass. [346]
I row out in a skiff built from discarded balustrades of the defunct carousel, their paint flaked into constellations. [365]
Every oar-stroke pulls up faint music, a muffled calliope lamenting a round it will never finish. [381]
I regret the carousel most, though I never built it and never rode it while alive. [397]
Its endless circuit looked too much like my own life, spinning around a center I refused to approach. [415]
Instead I chased reflected prizes, the cheap lights along the rim, and told myself it was momentum, not fear. [434]
By the time I realized I was only orbiting my own absence, the music had already begun to slow. [453]
That slowing is the last thing I remember clearly, a syrupy drag on every note, the crowd restless and unaware. [473]
Memory jumps after that, skips like a stone over the night I died, landing only on the splash of consequence. [493]
At the center of the lagoon I stop rowing, and the skiff sways in the machine-made tide. [510]
The ghost climbs out of my reflection as though it were a hatch. [523]
It looks like me only in outline; the interior has been scratched away, frame by frame, like film overexposed to regret. [544]
We sit facing each other, the lagoon trying to keep its fractured stillness between our breaths. [560]
I hand the ghost the disposable camera wheel, and it turns the stiff plastic as though counting years. [578]
With every click, a sliver of sound rises from the water: a strangers whispered confession, a childs half-finished prayer, a lovers lie. [600]
These are the stories I stole from the lagoon over years of scavenging, thinking they could replace my own. [619]
I thought if I filled myself with enough borrowed lives, the gaps in my timeline would stop aching. [637]
The ghost shakes its hollow head, and the lagoon echoes the motion with a slow, reluctant ripple. [654]
Those fragments are not a life, it says without speaking; they are only the rusts worth of other peoples eroded ambitions. [675]
You fed on echoes when you could have spoken, it continues, and now you want to bargain with silence. [694]
What can you offer me. [699]
I do not answer; instead I upend my pockets, letting the scavenged relics spill onto the boards of the skiff. [719]
Ticket stubs blurred with mist, a locket that never held a picture, a paper crown softened into pulp. [737]
Each piece carries someone elses almost, the moment right before they chose or failed to choose. [753]
Take them, I tell the ghost; they weigh more than I can bear, and less than I once believed. [772]
The ghost gathers the objects without touching them, drawing their outlines into its own empty frame until it is crowded with faint, overlapping selves. [796]</story>
