<story>The night I brokered peace on the storm-worn, windblown parapet, the sea erased every other sound. [16]
Mist crawled over the stones like a low animal, whitening the air between enemies. [30]
I was only a prisoner exchange negotiator, but tonight they spoke my name as if it were a final verdict. [50]
The parapet was declared neutral territory, a spine of wet granite jutting from the cliff where neither flag dared to fly. [71]
Someone once called me uncommonly thoughtful, as if the habit of turning every angle twice were a blessing and not a slow form of drowning. [96]
Tonight, all thought narrowed to the thin space between apology and forgiveness, that dangerous interval where history either softens or hardens forever. [118]
In my pocket lay the antique drawer pull I had stolen from my father's desk the day I left home, an oval of tarnished brass warmed by my pulse. [147]
Its weight reminded me that every opening begins as a refusal to stay closed. [161]
To the east waited the Black Coast captains, their armor lacquered like beetle shells, guarding the shackled sailors I hoped to bring back. [184]
To the west, beyond the broken merlons, the Riverhold emissaries clustered in gray cloaks, pretending their fear was only cold. [204]
Above us, the nearly full moon strained through the mist, right on schedule; both kingdoms had agreed that our exchanges would be timed by synchronizing through moon phases, so the sky, not the clocks, would witness every promise. [242]
It comforted them to imagine a cosmic metronome, as if the heavens could guarantee our sincerity. [258]
But the mood on the parapet was a furrowed hush, a field of brows plowed by sleeplessness and worry. [277]
I had come here less for their prisoners than for a chance to recycle mistakes into wisdom, starting with my own. [298]
My father had died on a different wall, under a different flag, because I once misjudged a negotiation and believed a promise that deserved to be strangled in its cradle. [328]
The drawer pull was all I took from his study, the only thing my grief-stricken mother did not notice missing, and I had carried it as both guilt and compass ever since. [360]
Now I pressed it between thumb and palm as I stepped to the parapet's center and raised my hands for silence. [381]
This stone listens but does not repeat, I said, invoking the old phrase that marked true neutral ground. [399]
No one laughed; choices made in such places had hunted all of us here. [413]
We began with the wounded, those unlikely to survive another week in captivity, trading them two for two along the slick walkway while torches smoked and sputtered. [440]
I counted their steps, measured each limp and stagger, storing every detail, because being uncommonly thoughtful meant I could not stop my mind from tallying hidden costs. [467]
Between each crossing there was a pause, an inhaled moment between apology and forgiveness in which both sides wondered if they had asked for enough, or for too much. [496]
The storm truly arrived when the Riverhold captain pushed forward a hooded figure whose name was not on any list I carried. [518]
He untied the ropes, and my brother lifted his head, eyes blackened, hair clotted with salt and blood. [536]
I had believed him dead these five years, another ruin of my misjudged war. [550]
The Riverhold captain spoke into the hush, offering my brother in exchange for a single woman held on the Black Coast galleys, a spy they hated and feared. [578]
It was a bad bargain on paper, dangerously uneven, the kind of exchange I had sworn never again to accept. [598]
Yet the numbers blurred, because here was the last living branch of my family tree, shivering in chains on supposed neutral territory that suddenly felt like someone's private altar. [627]
If I chose him over the nameless spy, I would be repeating the same selfishness that had once sent my father to die for a doomed treaty. [654]
If I refused, I might finally recycle mistakes into wisdom, but at the cost of leaving my brother to rot under foreign whips. [677]
My fingers closed around the drawer pull until its metal bit my skin, and I understood it had never been a keepsake but a question I carried from wall to wall. [708]
I walked to the edge, where a signaling lantern swung on a frayed cord, and I untethered it, letting its light drift out over the teeth of waves below. [737]
In the darkness that followed, both captains shifted uneasily, as if I had cut loose more than a lamp. [756]
I chose the spy, my voice low but steady, and in that furrowed hush my brother's gaze broke, moving past me to the moon, as if asking it to hurry the distance between apology and forgiveness. [792]</story>
