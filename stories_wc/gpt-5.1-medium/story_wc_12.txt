<story>The loop pedal priest arrived at the abandoned chapel just before dusk, carrying his battered guitar and a satchel of cables. [21]
Inside, dust softened the stained glass light into a muffled clarity that made every movement feel distant, as if the air were listening. [44]
The chapel had been chosen as a dimensional anchor, a place where overlapping realities could be nailed down long enough for exorcists to work. [68]
But tonight there was only him, Father Jonas, whose ordination had been accompanied not by organs but by looped chords and a congregation humming countermelodies. [93]
He set the guitar case on the altar beside an artist's palette with one color, a circular board holding only a single square of deep ultramarine pigment. [120]
The pigment was older than anything else in the room, ground from a stone excavated under the foundations when the chapel was first laid out as a citys secret fault line. [151]
It was the only color the Order allowed during possessions, the theory being that a single hue gave the spirit fewer surfaces on which to fracture its identity. [179]
On the front pew, the girl sat stiff as carved wood, eyes closed, wrists bound loosely with linen that was more symbol than restraint. [203]
Her parents waited outside by instruction, because Father Jonas preferred his rituals private, where he could decorate with silence instead of candles and incense. [227]
The demon had already begun its slow knitting around her mind, but there were hours yet before the possession completes, hours in which meaning itself might be argued into changing direction. [258]
He unlatched the guitar case, thumbed the loop pedal on the floor, and strummed a dry chord that hung in the rafters like a question that did not yet know its mark. [290]
The pedal captured it and returned it, over and over, building a lattice of sound sparse enough that thought could still move between the notes. [315]
Jonas believed that music, like theology, worked best when it unraveled stillness instead of trying to shatter it, pulling threads until what seemed solid admitted its seams. [342]
He approached the girl and spoke softly, words slipping into the spaces the looping chords left open. [359]
I am not here to drag you out, he said, but to ask why you walked in. [376]
Her eyelids twitched, and a second voice folded under his looping guitar, speaking from her unmoving mouth. [393]
You think yourself clever, priest, the demon murmured, using toys because you lack conviction. [407]
If I lacked conviction I would have brought a choir, Jonas replied, lightening the chord into a major shape that made the dust vibrate. [431]
We are here to plumb the depths of why you find her such an appealing vessel. [447]
The demon laughed, a dry rattle that the loop pedal immediately swallowed and fed back as a ghostly percussion under the chords. [469]
She is empty, it said, and that is all. [478]
Jonas reached for the palette, dipped two fingers into the single square of ultramarine, and drew a line across the brow above her eyes, then a second line across his own. [509]
The blue glowed faintly, not with light but with a strange attention, as though the pigment remembered every gaze that had ever crossed it. [533]
We say empty, Jonas continued, but what we really mean is full of things we do not want to name. [553]
Let us try another word. [558]
He slowed the loop, letting the chords stretch until they became almost speech, and then he began to preach not at the demon but at the architecture of its thinking. [588]
His homily was a net cast through rhetorical devices, anaphora and paradox and careful repetition looping like his guitar, each phrase circling closer to the hidden center. [615]
You claim she is empty, he said, yet you also claim her mind is rich enough for you to harvest; which claim do you abandon. [640]
You call her will weak, but you require that will to be strong enough to obey your slightest pressure; where exactly does your logic rest. [665]
The demon tried to answer, but every sentence snagged on a mirror Jonas was holding up, every assertion tangled in another question that glowed the same cool blue as the lines on their brows. [699]
He was not trying to win an argument so much as to illuminate hidden assumptions, the quiet little phrases where the demon had smuggled in the idea that control was the same as care. [733]
As he spoke, the chapel seemed to contract, the walls drawing nearer, not with menace but with a listening intent, the dimensional anchor tightening its grip on every drifting possibility. [763]
Something uncoiled in her shoulders, a shudder passing through her as the demon, cornered by its own contradictions, slipped free and left her breathing alone. [788]</story>
