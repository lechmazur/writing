<story>The first time I followed Lio into the catacomb orchard, the air tasted like rust and pomegranates. [17]
It was always within the glow of half-lit corridors that he chose to make his bargains. [33]
Lio moved with the careless grace of a street acrobat and the eyes of a reckless idealist. [50]
He could not pass a broken thing without wanting to mend it, to patch holes in the soul of whoever carried it. [72]
I was there because my own soul felt like moth-eaten cloth, and I was desperate enough to let him try. [92]
The orchard lay far beneath the city, where the stone ribs of forgotten temples arched over rows of sour cherry trees. [113]
Their roots snaked between bones, trammeling skulls and femurs the way roots usually trammel rocks, indifferent and patient. [131]
Candles burned in niches along the walls, throwing more shadow than light, so that every branch seemed doubled and watchful. [151]
We walked within that dusk of wax and stone, a kind of dusky resolve made visible, and Lio hummed under his breath. [173]
He carried his satchel like a priest carries relics, careful and fiercely gentle, though I had seen him punch men twice his size. [196]
Compassion, he always said, was more dangerous than violence, because compassion made promises the body had to keep. [214]
At the center of the orchard stood the altar, a slab of basalt veined with something that shimmered like trapped moonlight. [235]
Someone long ago had carved channels in its surface, inlaying meaning everywhere with silver dust, runes looping like vines. [254]
Lio spread a cloth over the stone, then laid out the tools of his trade: glass beads, dried fig slices, and a single burned tarot card. [280]
Its edges were blackened and curled, the image half-lost, but I could still make out a figure stepping off a cliff into stars. [303]
The Fool, I guessed, and Lio smiled like we had shared a secret. [316]
Not a fool, he corrected softly; a beginning that refuses to calculate the fall. [330]
He ran one thumb over the scorched card, then looked at me with that same reckless idealism that both comforted and terrified me. [353]
You know how this works, he asked, though he knew I had heard the rumors. [368]
People said Lio dealt in bartered destinies, trading the weight of one life for the possibility of another. [386]
He never took money, only stories, regrets, and the small sharp objects of memory we carried like splinters. [404]
Tonight, he wanted mine. [408]
Tell me what you cannot forgive yourself for, he said, and place it on the cloth. [424]
The memory came to me with the precision of a knife: my little brother on the riverbank, my hands empty, the water thick and fast. [449]
I had been looking away, in love with some distant horizon, and when I turned back he was gone. [468]
I never found his body, only his blue scarf snagged on a root, trammeling it against the mud like an accusation. [489]
I could not place the river on the cloth, so I placed my hand instead. [504]
Lio covered it with the burned tarot card, as if granting my guilt a small, scorched shelter. [521]
What do you want, he asked, not unkindly. [529]
Not pardon, I said; just a chance to become someone who would have stayed and watched the water. [547]
To be the kind of person who does not look away when the world needs a witness. [564]
He nodded, then pricked his thumb and let one drop of blood fall onto the card, where it beaded on the ash-darkened surface. [587]
The roots beneath the altar shivered, disturbed, as if something hungry had scented dinner. [601]
I felt the air stretch, a thin tightening, and the candles hiccuped wax down their sides. [617]
Lio spoke then in a language that sounded like wind blown backward, his voice fiercely gentle, coaxing rather than commanding. [637]
Around us, the trees bent slightly, their branches making a low creak like an old door deciding whether to open. [657]
I saw then that the channels carved into the altar led down into the soil, into the tangle of roots wrapped around bones. [680]
This was no mere table but a mouth, and the orchard its throat, swallowing what people brought here and feeding it back as changed futures. [705]
In that moment I understood why Lio always came away from his bargains a little dimmer around the edges. [724]
He was not a merchant but an offering, letting the orchard eat pieces of him so it would spare the rest of us. [747]
Light flared under the burned tarot card, a pale bloom that smelled faintly of river water and wet wool. [766]
I felt something sift through me like sand: moments I had lived, choices I had made, rearranging themselves with slow, aching care. [788]
When it was over, Lio looked older, and I steadier. [798]</story>
