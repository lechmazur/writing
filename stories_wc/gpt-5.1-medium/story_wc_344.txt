<story>The first time I climbed to the frozen library above clouds, the sky was still tasting of night. [18]
It was under the soft hush of a distant morning, the kind that forgets to turn the light all the way on. [40]
Frost filmed every step, and my breath felt borrowed, but nostalgia clung to me like old driftwood pulled from a receding tide. [62]
They called me the lunar-eclipse locksmith, though the moon was nowhere to be seen and I had never owned a proper key. [84]
What I carried instead was a clockmaker's gear assortment in a small oak case, every tooth and cog salvaged from timepieces that had forgotten their purpose. [110]
I had come to the library to learn the rhythm of repair, not of clocks or locks alone, but of whatever had broken so quietly no one remembered how it used to sound. [143]
The frozen library above clouds rose from the mountain like a crystal vertebra, its windows rimed, its stairwells breathing out little sighs of trapped centuries. [168]
Inside, rows of books slept under skins of ice so thin they looked painted on, each spine a frozen current of some forgotten sea of thought. [194]
Silence here was not empty; it was layered, like dust you could not brush away because it was made of other people's unfinished sentences. [218]
The librarian led me without speaking to a chamber at the heart of the building, a hall of mirrors that had once been a reading room. [244]
Now every wall wore silvered glass, and each pane showed not my reflection, but doorways closing and opening in other people's lives. [266]
Somewhere in that shifting geometry, I was told, lay the locks that governed memory, habit, and regret. [283]
But I was not allowed to touch the mirrors until I had earned the library's measure, and that measure could only be taken through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner. [315]
The librarian pointed to the farthest shelf, where the ceiling sagged and the frost grew in delicate, hauntingly bright feathers. [335]
There, between atlases of extinct rivers and catalogs of obsolete constellations, I found paper that had curled itself into quiet spirals. [356]
Each scrap bore only fragments of sentences, verbs lost, subjects erased, as if the future had been too shy to speak in full. [379]
I read them aloud, and the frozen air seemed to lean in, listening, while the gears in my oak case shifted faintly of their own accord. [405]
Pieces of prophecy spoke of shattered pendulums, of locks that forgot which side was inside, of mornings that refused to end. [426]
Between their half-frozen phrases, I began to hear a faint ticking, a rhythm not of seconds, but of things almost mended. [447]
The hall of mirrors waited behind me, its many doorless walls glinting like unread faces, and I understood that each reflection I would not see there was another fracture waiting for repair. [479]
When I had gathered all the scraps I could hold, the librarian offered me a small bottle of melted frost sealed with a lead cap. [504]
You must uncap this only once, she whispered, when a lock refuses every honest answer you know. [521]
Her voice sounded like pages turning themselves. [528]
Back in the hall of mirrors, the air trembled with a low, patient ringing, as if a bell were buried under the floor, dreaming of being struck. [555]
I knelt, set down the oak case, and opened it, the clockmaker's gear assortment gleaming softly like a scatter of rescued stars. [577]
No two gears matched, yet when I brushed them with my thumb they clicked together in brief alignments, making chords of motion that faded before I could name them. [606]
I faced the nearest mirror, which showed a stranger sitting at a kitchen table, his hands hovering over a letter he would never send. [630]
There was a lock there, not on the door behind him, but on his throat, a tight, invisible clasp that kept his words from turning into sound. [657]
I listened to the hovering tick inside my chest, matched it to the quiet chords of the gears, and felt for the rhythm of repair the prophecies had been circling. [687]
One by one, I lifted gears and held them up to the mirror; in their reflections they became key-teeth, aligning along the man's silent breath until something in the glass made a soft, releasing sound. [722]
The clasp on his throat unmade itself, his shoulders shook, and though I could not hear the words, I saw the room around him deepen in color, as if finally inhabiting its own morning. [756]
I moved from mirror to mirror, coaxing loose latches from memories, habits, and regrets, my fingers chapped, my eyes stinging with a slow, driftwood nostalgia for lives I had never lived. [787]
Somewhere above the clouds, the frozen library listened, and slowly, it thawed. [799]</story>
