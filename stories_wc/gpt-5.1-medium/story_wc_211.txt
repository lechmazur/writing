<story>After the foghorn fell silent, a shuddering sigh trembled through the steel bones of the skyscraper. [16]
In the sudden quiet, the ancient orchard garden atop the skyscraper's crown seemed to breathe in relief. [33]
Lan Zhen shuffled along the gravel path, robe hems whispering, fingers stained with ink as dark as the soil. [52]
He was the tower's venerable oath scribe, keeper of promises too fragile and too dangerous to trust to memory alone. [72]
Around him, the trees bore fruit like muted lanterns, each pear and apple wrapped in gauze labels inked with dates and names. [94]
The orchard was his archive, and tonight it would receive another confession. [106]
Lan carried, cradled in both palms, a velvet-lined box containing a thumb-sized coil of brown wax. [122]
It was a phonograph shaving, the ghost of a recording scraped from some forgotten cylinder. [137]
The wax ribbon curled softly in its nest, as though remembering the spiral it had once been. [154]
The donor waited near the central fig tree, hands jammed in the pockets of a weather-beaten coat, eyes tracking the city lights far below. [178]
He had given only a first name, Maro, as if surnames were more dangerous than what he had brought. [197]
You are late, he murmured, though the tower clock had not yet finished swallowing the hour. [213]
Traffic, Maro said, but the word broke oddly in his mouth, as though it meant something else where he came from. [234]
Lan had heard that kind of fracture before; it was the sound of a living language guarding a dead one underneath. [255]
He himself spoke dead languages the way some men collected rings, each dialect a loop of obligation around his heart. [275]
Show me, Lan said, and the garden seemed to lean inward, branches creaking with a slow, expectant hush. [293]
Maro opened his fist to reveal a tiny metal stylus, the kind that once rode the grooves of an old phonograph. [314]
This is all that is left, he said, and I need you to store the rest. [330]
The garden lamps dimmed to a velvet disquiet as clouds thickened over the moon, softening every edge into suggestion. [349]
Lan set the wax shaving on a flat river stone and laid the stylus across it like a question mark. [369]
He had no machine, but he had something older, a method the tower had not recorded in any diagram. [388]
To archive a sound, one had to immerse in its ghost. [399]
He closed his eyes, brought his ear near the tiny curl of wax, and let his breathing match the remembered spiral. [420]
The world thinned, the present sliding aside like a curtain, and he was standing in a classroom that smelled of glue and chalk dust. [444]
Lan was eight again, shoes too big, watching a visiting historian set a hulking phonograph on a rolling cart. [463]
It had been a curious third-grade field trip in reverse, the museum coming to them with relics that growled and sang when wound. [486]
He remembered the needle biting a spinning cylinder, the room holding its breath as a dead voice poured out, thin as spider silk. [509]
A buried language, the historian had said, and the word buried had knotted itself around Lan's heart and never left. [529]
Now the phonograph was gone, but the principle remained: follow the groove until it turns into a road. [547]
Lan let the remembered whir of the school phonograph merge with the silence of the garden until a thread of sound appeared. [569]
It rose from the wax, faint but precise, a voice speaking in a language so old it had petrified into ritual. [590]
Lan understood enough to stand very still. [597]
The speaker was reciting oaths, but not the personal threads he was used to; these were institutional promises, vast and cold, binding not people but entire futures. [624]
Maro shifted, gravel crunching, but his eyes were closed too, caught in the same listening. [639]
Tell me what it says, he whispered, though he could not have heard his own voice over the recording that was not quite sound. [663]
It is not for you, Lan said, and felt the orchard tighten, fruit hanging heavier on their stems. [681]
The dead language named a city in the past tense, then listed storms that had not yet happened, deaths that had not yet ripened, decisions trembling just beyond tomorrow. [710]
Lan realized, with the slow clarity of nightmare, that the cylinder from which this shaving was taken had once recorded an oath-scribe like himself speaking over a different garden in a different age. [743]
The man on the recording was describing outcomes, arranging them into a pattern of feeling, not events: dread, relief, regret, elation, numbness, awe. [766]
He was trying, like Lan, to archive emotional patterns, to catalog the weather inside the human chest before it changed beyond recognition. [788]
And in doing so, he had spoken an accidental prophecy. [798]</story>
