<story>The day the ghosts finally learned to cast shadows, I unlocked the apiary gate again. [15]
It was long after ghosts become visible to everyone else, but they had ignored me. [30]
By then I was an astonished recluse, the last living beekeeper in a scorched wasteland. [45]
The hives, cracked and empty, formed an abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland of glassy dunes. [62]
Wind hissed through warped frames with a kind of mute eloquence, saying everything my neighbors never had. [79]
I had stayed when they fled the drought and the flickering apparitions, driven by a stranger motive. [96]
I wanted to preserve the weight of unspoken words that used to thicken our summer air. [112]
In the hive yard, silence had always been heavy, purposeful, and I trusted it more than speech. [129]
Now the ghosts drifted between toppled boxes, half-bright, wearing the faces of those who had abandoned me. [146]
They thought I did not see them, but I was tranquilly perceptive in my solitude. [161]
I read their intentions not from their mouths but through contextual clues, the tilt of a spectral head, the curl of translucent fingers. [184]
That morning one figure hovered near the old queen-rearing shed, where my stained glass box waited beneath dust. [202]
I had built the box from shattered chapel windows, soldering saints and suns into a small reliquary of color. [221]
Inside lay scraps of wax comb, brittle letters, and a scroll bearing the tangled covenant that bound the dead to this place. [243]
It was not written in any language, only looping grooves pressed by absent hands into softened glass. [260]
When the last villagers left, they had sealed their regrets there, asking me to keep the box hidden. [278]
They feared the ghosts would learn to read it and claim what was owed. [292]
I feared something else entirely: that the covenant would fade, and with it the memory of what we had not dared say. [314]
So I visited the shed each dawn, unlocked the door, and sat across from the box in patient witness. [333]
I would gaze at its stained panels until colors pulsed like slow bees, until my own outline blurred. [351]
The ghosts grew bolder over the years, wandering the apiary paths, pausing as if to remember how sun felt. [370]
Today the hovering figure stepped fully through the shed wall and resolved into Mara, who had once promised never to leave. [391]
Her eyes were fogged mirrors, but her posture retained the stubborn tilt of the girl who argued with every cloud. [411]
You kept it, she said, voice weaving around my ears like smoke too tired to rise. [427]
I nodded, because there was nothing I trusted my mouth to do that my silence could not do better. [446]
Mara floated closer, her outline disturbing the dust motes into brief constellations. [458]
You know why we bound ourselves, she murmured, though the words seemed to bloom from the air, not her lips. [478]
Because you were afraid of what speaking plainly would cost, I thought, but did not answer. [494]
Instead I opened the stained glass box, hinges whining, and let the stored colors spill across her translucent chest. [513]
Light bent strangely through her, as if the covenant were a lens scraping against the curve of her being. [532]
In that prismed glow, the grooves on the scroll rose like welts, arranging themselves into shapes my mind had no words for. [554]
I understood them anyway, through contextual clues stitched from years of watching bees navigate distances they could not see. [573]
Promises of return, bargains with thirst, apologies buried under jokes; every unsent letter of the village glowed before me. [592]
The covenant was tangled because their desires had been, each strand a half-spoken wish twisted around another. [609]
They had anchored their ghosts here not to haunt, but to linger until someone worthy could sort the knots without breaking them. [631]
Mara watched me with a patience sharper than any accusation. [641]
You stayed, she finally said, because you could bear the quiet we could not. [655]
I almost laughed, but the sound died behind my teeth, a bee that chose not to sting. [672]
Someone had to remember the texture of our silence, I answered at last, the way it carried more than any argument. [693]
If the covenant loosens, your words will scatter, and no one will know what you almost said. [710]
Mara reached toward the scroll, her fingers passing through it as through water, and the grooves shivered. [727]
Then she withdrew, as if accepting that the task was mine alone. [739]
Keep it, she whispered, not as prison, but as witness. [749]
The shed filled with a hush so dense I could almost feel its grain, a wood of unsaid things. [768]
In that mute eloquence I sensed the true covenant: not between the living and the dead, but between silence and meaning, each holding the other in careful, astonished trust. [797]</story>
