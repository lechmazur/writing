<story>The mushrooms woke before I did, rinsing the hangar in blue-green static. [12]
It was always like this before the echo of morning birdsong reached us from the city trees above. [30]
The bioluminescent mushroom farm glowed in careful grids, each tray stacked three high along the ex-military hangar walls. [48]
I paced the central aisle with my tablet, the way an intrusion detection specialist patrols a firewalled perimeter only half believing in safety. [71]
I am, inconveniently, spatially gifted; I cannot unsee how things connect, align, and slip past each other. [88]
Tonight, though, I walked the aisles to understand the physics of letting go, not just the geometry of keeping out. [108]
On the monitors, faces drifted through the loading dock like ghosts of a life I almost lived, familiar strangers I had never once met. [132]
They came every few weeks, never breaching, only testing, as if the door were a mirror and they were checking their own persistence. [155]
I watched them the way you watch yourself in windows at night, half afraid the reflection will look back with its own intentions. [178]
Rae found me standing too long in front of Camera Four, my fingers hovering over the laser pointer button clipped to my belt. [201]
"You are not supposed to tag them unless they cross the second perimeter," she said, voice low but not unkind." [221]
"I am not tagging," I said, and heard the quiet wildfire in my own words, the way they burned softly at the edges. [244]
"I am wondering what it would take for us to stop acting like walls." [258]
Rae raised an eyebrow, then tilted her head, doing that quick mental triangulation she did with air currents, cable runs, and human moods. [281]
She was spatially gifted, too, but where I saw vectors of threat, she saw paths of escape. [298]
"They are hungry," she said, nodding toward the monitors where the familiar strangers shuffled their weight, hands bare in the winter air. [320]
"They think food grows here." [325]
In a way it did; our mushrooms chewed through municipal waste, old pallets, shredded legislation, turning refusal into protein. [344]
From the ceiling, nets of mycelium hung in thick veils, breathing, drinking, proving that life moves through permeable barriers more easily than code ever predicts. [369]
I had come here from corporate security, from a job that promised to revolutionize intrusion detection with predictive algorithms and ended up mostly selling fear. [394]
I quit the day I realized I could map the office better than I could map my own desires. [413]
Since then, every corridor I walked felt like an equation unsolved, each door a variable in the physics of letting go. [434]
On the dock feed, the tallest stranger stepped closer, breath feathering white against the metal, and for a moment his eyes lifted to meet the camera lens. [461]
It felt like standing in front of a mirror that refused to be only glass. [476]
My thumb found the laser pointer button again, that cheap red diode we used to highlight anomalies on live feeds. [496]
Rae placed her hand gently over mine, grounding it against my belt. [508]
"There are other ways to draw lines," she murmured, "ways that do not pretend we are not also on the outside of something." [531]
Her words moved slow but sure, a quiet wildfire licking along the dry arguments I kept stored for nights like this. [552]
"We can open the dock," I said, surprised to hear myself, surprised that the idea did not sound like treason but like physics fulfilling itself. [577]
Rae studied me, then the screens, calculating impact vectors not of bodies, but of choices rippling outward through our carefully drawn maps. [599]
"If we let them in," she said, "we change the model forever." [611]
Maybe the model is meant to be changed," I answered, feeling the old promise of revolutionize humming again, this time pointed inward. [633]
We walked together down the metal stairs, through the aisles of glowing trays where the mushrooms pulsed gently like a second, slower heartbeat. [656]
Every step felt like approaching a version of myself I had abandoned, a familiar stranger waiting on the other side of a badge-locked door. [680]
At the dock, only a sheet of reinforced plastic separated us, cloudy with age, humming faintly in the stillness before the echo of morning birdsong. [705]
Up close, the barrier did not look solid; tiny scratches formed constellations where light slipped through, mapping possible futures across their faces and ours. [729]
I keyed in the override, felt the lock hesitate, then release, the weight of the door swinging inward as if obeying some long-neglected equation. [753]
The strangers stepped back first, startled, then forward, the tallest one meeting my eyes with a confusion that mirrored my own. [774]
In that shared hesitation, I finally understood that letting go was just another form of precise alignment. [791]</story>
