<story>On the morning the tide forgot to turn, I finally went back to the drowned bay. [16]
Decades later than I had promised myself, the path down still remembered the press of my boots and my notebook's weight. [37]
I was once the hands-on folklorist of our scattered fishing towns, crawling under piers and into attics to rescue stories from rot. [59]
Being chronically curious had never felt like a fault until the day curiosity cost me my own memories. [77]
I had come back to the bay to recover stolen memories, the ones I knew existed only because of the hollow shapes they left. [101]
The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks waited where the cliff cracked open, its glass ribs jutting from the water like a drowned cathedral. [125]
Before the sea took it, the greenhouse had been my favorite field site, a place where trees, legends, and experiments shared the same soil. [149]
It was there, among grafted apple branches and wind-humming panes, that the old woman with the tide-colored eyes bargained away pieces of my past. [173]
She had needed a folklorist to document a ritual no one else remembered, and I had needed funding and a story no one could ignore. [198]
The price, she said, would be a few habits I would not miss, small loops of mind she would trim away like dead vine. [222]
Only now, returning when habits break of their own accord with age, did I understand how much more she had taken. [243]
My notebooks held stories I could not remember collecting, my handwriting wrapping around lives that felt like dreams told by a stranger. [265]
Whole friendships, whole winters, sat on the page while my mind skipped over them like a needle jumping from a cracked record. [287]
The woman had left me one clue; she said I could detect the missing pieces by studying broken constellations reflected where no sky should be. [312]
So I waited for low tide, when the water inside the orchard greenhouse calmed to a mirror, and climbed down the rusted ladder. [335]
Around me, broken masts of shipwrecks leaned like half-drowned sundials, their shadows slicing the surface into shards of trembling night. [355]
On the silted floor of the greenhouse, where apple roots once drank rain, a circle of fairy ring mushroom caps glowed a faint, improbable blue. [380]
Their pattern echoed the burlap maps in my old field kits, and I realized they were not growing randomly but following the gaps overhead. [404]
Where panes of glass were missing, the evening's first stars pricked through, their reflections splintered by the still water and completed by the mushroom circle below. [430]
There it was: a map drawn by studying broken constellations, half celestial, half fungal, pointing toward everything I had lost. [450]
Nostalgia came then, not as warmth but as a crisp tightening in my chest, like cold air entering lungs unused to honest breathing. [473]
I knelt, the hands-on folklorist again, pressing my fingers into the damp ring as if I could read history by touch alone. [495]
Images rose, not as visions but as fully weighted sensations: the ache of a rope burn, the taste of stolen cider, the laughter of a brother. [521]
I staggered, because until that moment I had not known I ever had a brother, yet the memory landed with unquestionable certainty. [543]
More memories followed, each bead pulled through the narrow eye of the fairy ring mushroom, threading my life back together in sharp, unfinished segments. [567]
For every recollection that returned, something else frayed; I felt facts thinning, phone numbers dissolving, the exact dates of storms slipping out of reach. [591]
The bargain had never truly ended; the old woman had only changed its terms, offering me a choice between a tidy life and a complete one. [617]
I thought of my students in town, who already complained that I told too many tangents, that I chased sidetracks no one else could see. [642]
Perhaps this was simply what happened when habits break, when the chronically curious refuse to file their lives into neat, forgettable columns. [664]
I stayed in the circle until the tide crept back in, letting the broken constellations guide every vanished moment home, even as everything else blurred. [689]
When I finally climbed out, decades later seemed to have passed behind my eyes, yet for the first time my own story felt unswervingly mine. [714]</story>
