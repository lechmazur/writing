<story>After the last echo of laughter fades from the world above, Elias descends alone into the crystal cave. [18]
The tunnel's mouth seals behind him with a sigh of stone, leaving only the subterranean glitter and his breathing. [37]
Charcoal dust moons his fingertips, the indelible badge of a portrait sketch artist who cannot stop seeing faces. [55]
Upstairs, the theater has finally gone dark; downstairs, his inescapable calling glows brighter than the cave's crystals. [72]
He has come to uncork his suppressed creativity, the one thing the paying patrons upstairs never wanted from him. [91]
The key is a broken combination lock, palm-warmed and useless, salvaged from the theater's discarded prop trunk. [108]
It once fastened the donation box that kept him paid yet caged, clicking open only for other people's numbers. [127]
Elias is mnemonically gifted; every code, face, and whispered insult ever thrown his way hangs in perfect recall. [145]
He remembers the lock's original combination, remembers the manager's smirk, remembers deciding never again to open it on command. [164]
Now the lock will fasten something else: the painting waiting at the cave's heart, the one with something behind it. [184]
Crystals sprout from the walls like frozen fireworks, catching his lantern light and breaking it into shy, auroral colors. [203]
Their glow bathes his cheeks in auroral sorrow, as if dawn itself were grieving somewhere just out of reach. [222]
He follows the narrow path deeper, boots scraping limestone, each step a quiet refusal of the life above. [240]
Up there, applause always drowned out his smallest experiments; down here, even the last echo of laughter has died. [259]
The tunnel opens into a domed chamber, its ceiling bristling with crystals and its far wall draped by a single canvas. [280]
He painted it months ago in secret: his own face, eyes closed, mouth sewn shut with threads of charcoal. [299]
Behind the canvas, concealed in a niche he carved with shaking hands, waits the only drawing he never finished. [318]
That unfinished portrait is the reason he cannot sleep, the reason every stranger's face rearranges into hers. [335]
Her name was Mara, the one art student who came backstage not for autographs but to ask about his sketchbook. [355]
She said they shared inescapable callings, that some people were born to make images no matter who tried to own them. [376]
Two nights later, she fell from the theater's asbestos-crusted catwalk, leaving only a smear of chalk dust on the rigging. [396]
He started her portrait the next morning in the staff break room, kneading his grief into careful lines that would not hold. [418]
The manager saw, hissed about liability, and ripped the paper from his hands before he had drawn her eyes. [437]
What little survived he smuggled down here, hiding Mara's half-formed gaze behind his self-portrait like contraband breath. [454]
He vowed never to complete it, telling himself the unfinished lines would preserve her better than a finished lie. [473]
Yet every caricature he drew for tourists, every flattering stage portrait, only sharpened the need to rectify that betrayal. [492]
So he brought the broken combination lock tonight, intending to fasten the canvas to the stone so no one could interrupt. [513]
He twists the dial through its old sequence anyway, his mnemonically gifted mind reciting the numbers like an incantation. [532]
The lock, gutted of mechanism, clicks in hollow mimicry, but the sound feels like something real surrendering. [549]
He lifts his own mute-faced painting from its hooks, revealing the hidden sheet, yellowed and trembling in the lantern light. [569]
Mara's jaw is there, her hair beginning to curl around the margins, but the space where her eyes belong gapes white. [590]
He sits cross-legged on the damp stone and sets the paper on his knees, crystals reflecting twin lanterns where her irises should be. [613]
Closing his eyes, he summons every stored fragment of her: the way she frowned when she concentrated, the tilt of skepticism. [634]
Memory is a cruel abundance; he knows exactly where each lash belongs, how the corner of her mouth lifted before a joke. [656]
As charcoal rasps over paper, the cave listens, droplets timing his strokes, crystals dimming as if swallowing their own reflections. [676]
When he finally draws her eyes, two dark ovals cupping light, tears streak the dust on his face and blur the lines. [698]
He realizes he has not freed himself from her or from art; he has simply answered what was always waiting. [718]
Inescapable callings do not end, he understands; they only stop corroding you when you stop trying to lock them away. [738]
He rehangs his self-portrait over hers, threads the broken combination lock through the wire, and sits until the crystals pale with morningless, auroral sorrow. [762]</story>
