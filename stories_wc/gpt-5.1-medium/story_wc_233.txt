<story>The queen woke from the dream with her throat raw and her crown on the floor. [16]
In the dream, the sky had opened like a wound and bled starlight into a cavern high above the clouds, and every drop that touched her skin whispered her true name. [47]
By daylight, she was Isera, a disenchanted queen of mountain realm, but in sleep the stars called her something else, something sharp enough to cut it open. [74]
This was the seventh time she had woken like this, after the final warning given by the court seer, and the taste of iron in her mouth no longer felt like fear but like an order. [110]
Somewhere on the western ridge lay an ember grotto no map recorded, and if she did not climb there soon to unravel mystery of her recurring dreams, the sky would bleed out. [142]
Isera rose, her heavy ceremonial silks hissing like displeased snakes, and looked toward the shuttered balcony where the dawn was beginning to thin the night. [167]
Today she was meant to preside over harvest treaties, to smile with softly commanding patience at bickering lords, to pretend the throne still pleased her. [192]
Instead, she rang the silver bell that summoned her captain of guards. [204]
Ralen entered with his helm under his arm, scars catching the thin light, habit already dropping him to one knee until she gestured for him to rise. [231]
We ride within the hour, she said, her voice low and edged, like lace soaked in venom. [248]
Majesty, the lords wait for you, he replied, but he did not sound surprised, only wary, the way a man sounds at the edge of a cliff he has been ordered to approach. [281]
Let them wait until the stones grow wheat, she said. [291]
There is a grotto on the western ridge, a cobalt grotto above clouds, and I must see what the sky is hiding there. [314]
She did not tell him about the bleeding starlight or the voice that called her by a name only half remembered; some truths sounded more dangerous aloud. [341]
By noon they had left the terraced fields and the palace that perched like an ornament on the highest shelf of the world, and were clinging to the mountain paths that goat herders claimed even spirits feared. [378]
Thin air scraped their lungs, and the sky grew so near it felt like the inside of an enormous, listening ear. [399]
Sometimes Isera thought she could hear it muttering in a language made of wind and distance. [415]
When they reached the last shepherd hut, abandoned and half sunk in snow, Ralen called for a halt, and the warriors dismounted with grateful groans. [440]
A storm sweeps in from the north, Majesty, he said, pointing with his chin at a bruise of cloud pulsing on the horizon. [463]
We can shelter here and continue tomorrow. [470]
Once, years ago, she and Ralen had stood in the palace orchard as dusk thickened, a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer, both of them pretending not to feel the nearness tremble between their shoulders. [507]
Tomorrow, she knew, the dreams would come again, more insistent, more laden with that lacy menace that threaded through her sleep like cobwebs strung with teeth. [533]
No, she said, and her refusal was softly commanding, not raised, yet leaving no space for argument. [550]
We climb now. [553]
The ridge path narrowed to a ledge gouged into stone, the drop a white blur of cloud that swallowed sound and sense alike. [576]
Lightning flickered inside the oncoming storm, but above them, unnervingly, the sky was clear, a vault of blue so deep it bruised the eye. [600]
It was there, as they rounded a spur of rock shaped like a broken fang, that the grotto revealed itself. [620]
Its mouth yawned from the cliff face like a wound burned into the mountain, edges dark with old soot, the stone within glowing with a pulse too steady to be reflected day. [652]
The air here was warmer, tasting faintly of metal and something sweeter, like overripe fruit left by a god. [671]
This is the ember grotto, she said, though she had never seen it before and could not say how she knew. [692]
Ralen ordered the others to wait outside while he followed her inward, one hand on his sword, as if steel meant anything beneath a sky that bled. [719]
Inside, the grotto widened into a chamber whose ceiling was lost above them, yet visible in strange shards, as if they looked up through shattered glass. [745]
From those shards, starlight dripped, not white but dark, each drop a tiny wound in the air that fell, slow and heavy, to burst silently on the stone. [773]
Where it burst, images flared and died: a girl running through snow; a crown sinking into a lake; the palace halls split open like ribs. [798]
Isera remembered. [800]</story>
