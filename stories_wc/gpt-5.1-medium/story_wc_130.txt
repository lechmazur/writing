<story>After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon, the secretive conjurer returns to the cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites.[20]
His name, when he uses one, is Corren, but in the underworld markets they call him the Listener of Echoes.[40]
He has come tonight to solve a problem that has no clean answer: to understand the mathematics of emotion etched in the silences between heartbeats.[65]
A gently inventive man, Corren hides his workings behind small, precise spectacles and a manner so mild that people forget he is dangerous.[88]
What haunts him is not a death, but an absence that never properly arrived, an ambiguous loss that hovers like mist between what was and what might still be.[117]
Years ago his brother Lio walked into these caverns following a rumor of fruit that could rewrite memory, and simply did not walk back out.[142]
No body, no farewell, only the arithmetic of missing steps and the way his mother set one extra bowl at the table for three winters.[167]
The cavern orchard breathes around him, rows of pale trees whose roots drink from mineral pools where stalactites drip like slow clocks.[189]
Each fruit is a glassy orb veined with faint luminescence, rumored to hold one forgotten hour for anyone brave enough to bite.[211]
But tonight the orchard is mute, its branches bare, the air thick with the flavorless dust of unspoken stories.[230]
Corren kneels on the damp stone and studies the only guide he has left: a mosaic stepping stone half-buried near the first tree, its surface chipped into a pattern Lio once traced with laughing fingers.[265]
The path to his brother, he believes, runs via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, if only he can read the broken tesserae like a spell.[293]
From his satchel he draws the taxidermist's glass eye pair, small orbs of smoky blue that once watched from the sockets of a stuffed stag in a royal hall.[322]
The stag had been mounted mid-leap, forever chasing something just beyond the painted trees, and Corren had bought the eyes for the way they held unfinished motion.[349]
Unfinished things, he has learned, listen closely to other unfinished things.[360]
He sets the glass eyes into shallow hollows in the stone, letting them stare up at the mosaic as if it were a sky they are trying to remember.[389]
Then, with fingers that have coaxed rain from dry wells and borrowed whispers from snoring sailors, he begins to conjure.[409]
His magic is not the explosive sort that cracks stone; it is gently inventive, weaving possibilities the way moss threads its way across forgotten statues.[434]
He murmurs numbers under his breath, ratios of longing to memory, equations where hope and fear dovetail into spirals neither growing nor shrinking, only circling.[459]
As he speaks, the cavern orchard seems to lean in, leaves like dim hands cupping sound, stalactite drips hesitating in midfall.[480]
In the glass eyes, reflections shift: not his own face, but Lio's laughter smeared into arcs of light, his brother's outline dissolving into the stone pattern.[506]
Corren wants to reach through, to solve the equation by dragging Lio back across whatever boundary stole him, but the more he calls, the more the image frays.[534]
The orchard hums with a low ache, tree trunks bruised with shadow, the air contracting around him as if the whole cavern is taking a breath it will never release.[564]
This is the mathematics of emotion resisting neat solutions: variables that refuse to stay constant, infinities lurking in memories he cannot fully summon and cannot truly forget.[591]
Sweat beads on his forehead, and at last Corren understands that to drag Lio back would mean tearing open every branch, ripping fruit from futures that belong to others.[620]
A thought, small as a seed and buried in the gravel of his grief, begins to root: perhaps not every sum must end with retrieval; perhaps survival can balance on acceptance instead.[652]
He shifts the spell, no longer pleading for Lio's return but asking the orchard to show him how to live with the shape of the missing space.[679]
The glass eyes cloud, then clear, and in them Corren sees himself walking these rows years from now, teaching children to listen to drips, to count pauses, to honor what is gone without pretending it never was.[716]
Old sorrow and tentative purpose dovetail inside his chest, awkward but workable, like mismatched pieces that still hold a table steady.[737]
When he finally rises, the orchard has not given back his brother, but it has given him a way to remain, and as he retrieves the glass eyes and pockets them, the stalactites resume their ticking and the silence feels, for the first time, almost kind.[783]</story>
