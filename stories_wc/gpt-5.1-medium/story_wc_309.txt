<story>The icebound spire above the clouds rose like a frozen question mark over the automated world below. [17]
Inside it, in a cell the size of a broom closet, lived Orren, the underachieving mage no guild remembered recruiting. [37]
Orren had failed transmutation, bungled illusions, and once managed to set water on fire, which the examiners insisted should have been impossible even for him. [62]
So they sent him where failure could be safely forgotten: to tend the archive at the top of the sky. [82]
His job, according to the thin brass tablet bolted to his door, was to supervise legacy analog artifacts in an era when creativity gets automated. [107]
Which meant, in practice, dusting things nobody asked for and feeding catalog data into an algorithm that composed better stories about them than humans ever had. [133]
Tonight, blinking under the brilliant dimness of the spire's enchanted lamps, Orren stared at the newest arrival on his workbench. [153]
It was a garden folly keystone, a lump of veined stone carved into an arch's central wedge, its surface dull yet threaded with a faint, lingering luminance. [180]
The manifest said it had once crowned a useless doorway in a forgotten estate, from a time when the wealthy built structures that did nothing just to prove they could. [210]
Now it was here, another orphaned object for the archive's yawning database. [222]
Orren reached out, then stopped, hearing the quiet hiss that meant the story-engine downstairs had begun its nightly work. [241]
The machine would swallow his dry catalog notes and emit six polished narratives about the keystone, each more profound, more moving, more marketable than anything he could imagine. [269]
Once, he had tried to read them and learn. [278]
Instead, he found his own thoughts curled up like burned paper beside their glimmering paragraphs. [293]
So he had stopped reading, and the engines had continued without him, exhaling perfect tales into the void. [311]
The keystone gave off a soft warmth when his fingers finally closed around it, as if the stone were remembering the sun. [333]
Its lingering luminance bled into his skin, not bright enough to dazzle, not dim enough to ignore, a patient insistence in the bones of his hand. [359]
There was a tag tied to the keystone's iron loop, written in a crabbed script from some field archivist long since replaced by drones. [383]
ACCOMMODATES IMPOSSIBILITIES, it read, followed by a smudge that might have been a question mark or a fingerprint. [401]
Orren snorted, but the words clung to him the way the light did. [414]
Outside his tiny window, the clouds pulsed faintly with cityglow from far below, a distant, automated aurora. [431]
The spire creaked like an old lung. [438]
On impulse, he unstrapped the leather harness that hung on the wall, the one he was supposed to wear whenever he left the safe radius of his desk. [466]
Regulations said the harness should always be clipped to the central rail, anchoring him against the spire's open shafts and treacherous balconies. [488]
Regulations did not mention what to do when a stone in your hand whispered that the whole tower was a doorway. [509]
He stepped into the corridor, the chill biting harder with every pace upward toward the observation ledge. [526]
Halfway there, the keystone grew heavier, tugging his arm toward a side stair he had never used, its steps sheathed in rime. [548]
The tower was supposed to be fully mapped, yet this stairwell felt like an apology for an oversight, a place the architects had drawn and then forgotten to erase. [577]
He followed it up into the throat of the spire, where the air grew thinner and the lamps gave way to a milky, sourceless glow. [602]
At the top waited a circular platform open to the night, ringed by delicate arches of ice that did not melt in the wind. [626]
The world below was hidden under an ocean of cloud, its electric heartbeat reduced to a faint, pearly throbbing that painted the underside of the mist. [652]
Orren stepped to the edge and felt the familiar tilt in his balance, the old fear of falling that had haunted him since he botched his first levitation charm. [681]
He remembered the examination hall, the snickering apprentices, the way the instructors had looked away as if his failure were a draft they could simply discard and rewrite. [709]
The keystone pulsed, and the air around his boots thickened into mist, not the blank, white kind that erased horizons but a textured vapor threaded with quiet light. [737]
He had read once, in a volume the engines had deemed obsolete, about mist walking, a minor, unfashionable discipline that let certain mages skim the boundaries between here and maybe. [767]
The discipline had been mocked for lacking spectacle or reliable outcomes. [778]
Now, standing in that brilliant dimness, Orren finally understood he wanted to find the sacred in the simple. [796]
He stepped into mist. [800]</story>
