<story>In the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites, the prince woke to grinding gears. [14]
His silken banners were long since replaced by dangling cables and shivering copper pipes. [28]
Rain had never reached this high, yet he was always damp, a bedraggled prince of rust. [44]
Below, the mechanical world ground on, all piston blossoms and iron rivers, efficient and empty. [59]
Above, the stalactites disappeared into darkness, trembling with every faraway tremor of mining drills. [73]
No birds flew there anymore. [78]
They were theories now, and museum sketches, and wistful code in obsolete entertainment automata. [92]
The prince had never seen a feather except in mosaics printed on ceramic floor plates. [107]
Yet he woke each morning with the memory of wings, as if from another lifetime. [122]
That feeling was his only crown now, tarnished, bitterly sweet, and impossible to pawn. [136]
In the central hall, the court philosophers were already assembled around the Continuum Engine. [150]
It was a drum of black glass and brass, cables threading from it like spilled hair. [166]
Inside, the first dawn of the world turned on repeat, gears simulating a flawed genesis. [181]
Every morning, they tuned that artificial dawn, hypothesizing about everything that could have gone differently. [196]
They charted what might have happened if rivers had run with water instead of lubricant. [211]
If soil had been allowed to exist, unanodized, unmeasured, unpatented. [221]
If wings had found purchase in air not yet zoned for cargo routes. [234]
Each new hypothesis spun the Engine, printing another glass tablet of speculative trees and vanished rivers. [250]
The prince sat above them on his corroded throne and listened, shaking. [262]
He was supposed to approve which fantasy would become the next advertising campaign for the mining syndicates. [279]
Their billboards below already showed forests and oceans, repackaged as amenities in luxury ventilation corridors. [294]
But today, a courier approached at a run, boots clanking on the grated floor. [308]
He bowed so low his forehead kissed rust. [316]
Your Radiance, the excavators have unearthed something that is not ore, not metal, not fossil. [331]
They are afraid to feed it to the smelters. [340]
Farm it out then, the prince began, thinking of mutant polymers and troublesome gases. [354]
No, Your Radiance, the thing is fragile, like a blown bulb or a teardrop. [368]
It has a shell, and inside, something moves when you hold it to the light. [383]
The palace trembled as more ore-lifts docked beneath, but inside the prince a stillness opened. [398]
Bring it. [400]
They met not in the hall but in his private observatory, where the walls were transparent. [416]
Below, the world was a maze of cranes and chimneys, a sputtering garden of industry. [431]
Above, stalactites loomed like teeth of a sleeping god that had forgotten how to wake. [446]
The courier unwrapped the find with hands that shook as if the future were inside. [461]
On the cloth lay an egg the color of old moonlight, mottled, faintly warm. [475]
Not reptile, the court biologist whispered, gloved fingers hovering. [484]
Bird, Your Radiance, from a lineage registered extinct during the First Efficiency Wars. [497]
This is an extinct bird's egg, intact, unfossilized, inexplicable. [506]
The prince touched the shell, and something inside fluttered like a mechanical fault longing to fail. [522]
In that instant, a memory that was not his own seared through him. [535]
Sky without ceilings, air without the taste of burnt oil, a horizon that did not end in rails. [553]
He felt the world as it might have been born, not from flawed genesis in a drum, but from heat and tides and chance. [577]
His knees went weak; the observatory floor seemed to tilt, a quaking reverie made of light and breath. [595]
Through the discovery, one thought crystallized above the roar of engines below. [607]
If this small, trembling possibility lived, the world might remember beauty that was not made of circuits. [624]
His duty to the syndicates fell away like flaking paint. [634]
Instead he saw a single purpose, bright and terrifying: to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world. [650]
We will not smelt it, he said. [657]
We will assemble whatever this life requires, no matter what laws we break. [670]
The philosophers protested that the egg was data, a natural experiment that must be disassembled and modeled. [687]
The biologist warned of unknown diseases, contaminants from a softer era. [698]
The courier only watched the egg, as if it were a verdict. [710]
Silence, the prince said, surprising himself with how the word rang like metal struck true. [725]
All my life you have asked me to approve advertisements for possible worlds. [738]
Now a possible world has arrived, not on glass but in shell and heartbeat. [752]
I will be its custodian, or its fool. [760]
He ordered a chamber cleared and warmed, not by furnaces but by redirected sunlight from the mirrors outside. [778]
There, he sat vigil beside the extinct bird's egg, waiting for the crack of a new dawn. [795]</story>
