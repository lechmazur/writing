<story>In the serpentine grotto in mist, I lay out my small constellation of tools. [14]
My hands remember their places among them even before my memories resurface. [26]
I am an earthbound star watcher, sworn to map light that never burns. [39]
Around me the grotto coils and curves, walls slick and dark, breathing out ocean hush. [54]
Veils of mist drift through the tunnels like slow comets, catching echoes of older lives. [69]
Each night I return here, where stone remembers tides, to teach broken things how to shine. [85]
My treasures wait in a shallow basin: fragments of sea glass, river pebbles, shells hollowed by time. [102]
They are cloudy, scratched, and weary, but I see the constellations sleeping inside them. [116]
Tonight the mist smells of rain and lemons, a tender sharpness that tugs loose a forgotten hour. [133]
I close my eyes and, as memories resurface, the grotto becomes the cliffside village of my childhood. [150]
We could not keep fires for fear of drawing raiders, so our nights drowned in a softer dark. [168]
My grandmother would sit by the window, turning a shard of sea glass between her fingers. [184]
She said it gathered the memory of waves and lent it bravely to the moonless air. [200]
Light without fire, she whispered, is a promise that does not scorch the ones who seek it. [217]
When the raids came and the houses burned, I remember her pressing that cool shard into my palm. [235]
Now, in this breathing cavern, I polish glass because I never found her again. [249]
My craft is gem polishing, though my gems were once discarded, scoured by waves, abandoned to grit. [266]
I cup one fragment in my palm, milky green and dull, an unremarkable sliver of sea-worn bottle. [283]
The stone beside me is flat and dark, its surface sprinkled with fine sand, my faithful, silent wheel. [301]
I begin to rub the glass in slow circles, letting my breath find the rhythm the waves taught. [319]
The grotto settles around me, mist folding like petals, the air a zephyr bloom against my skin. [336]
As I work, the shard grows reflectively vibrant, catching threads of dim light from cracks high overhead. [353]
I watch tiny stars awaken inside it, fractured points arranging themselves into the pattern of her window. [370]
The room, the raids, her last hurried kiss, all rise like distant constellations just visible through smoke. [387]
I pause to weigh the shard in my hand, testing its heft against the ache in my chest. [405]
It feels almost like a heart, almost like an answer too fragile to speak aloud. [420]
My work is not only to brighten these pieces, but to measure how much sorrow each can safely carry. [439]
Too sharp an edge and the light cuts; too heavy a glow and it blinds. [454]
So I listen, not with ears but with the thin trembling place behind my sternum. [469]
When the glass quiets, when it holds its brightness like the hush before dawn, I know it is ready. [488]
One by one I polish the rest, until the basin brims with a shy galaxy of softened shards. [506]
They shine without flame, gleaming like a pearl of stillness held in the throat of the cave. [523]
In their quiet I hear the village children laughing, hands cupped around the first piece I ever polished. [541]
They had gathered in the ruins, afraid to sleep, and I had nothing but a pouch of scraps. [559]
When I poured the glowing pieces onto the ground, their faces lifted like flowers seeking sun. [575]
We watched our breath shimmer in that borrowed radiance, no smoke, no sparks, only courage slowly unfurling. [592]
I swore then to share light without using fire, to become a lantern that never burned down. [609]
The memory loosens its grip and I am back in the grotto, knees damp, hands ringed with luminous dust. [628]
Outside, the tide booms like a distant drum, but inside this coiled stone the air is tender and listening. [647]
I gather the polished glass into a cloth, feeling their collective glow press faintly against my ribs. [664]
In the deepest curve of the grotto, where the mist hangs thickest, the youngest refugees wait tonight. [681]
Their eyes are huge in the gloom, already rehearsing a fear they should never have had to memorize. [699]
I walk toward them, my steps quiet, my bundle warm, carrying not fire, but the memory of oceans learning to be gentle with glass. [723]
When I open the cloth and their faces fill with that cool, reflectively vibrant glow, it feels as if the whole sky has bowed low enough for them to touch. [753]
In their cupped hands the shards become tiny moons, and for a moment the world holds still, listening to its own heart learn a gentler way to shine. [781]</story>
