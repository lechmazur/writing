<story>Snow fell in slow spirals over the palace, muting every color into a single restless silver. [16]
In the silver courtyard under snow, lanterns burned with a blue so soft it seemed dangerous. [32]
Here, between sigh and smile, the chaste courtesan waited with her hands folded inside her sleeves. [48]
They called her Iri, for the way every unspoken desire bent around her like light around glass. [65]
She wore white not for purity but as a quiet refusal, a blank page no patron had yet written on. [85]
To defy the lullaby of conformity that hummed through palace halls, she had made herself unreadable. [101]
Yet tonight the unreadable was summoned, and so she stood in the snow as bells stuttered midnight. [118]
The king had ordered a harvest of echoes, and only Iri knew how to bring them forth alive. [136]
Echoes were what remained when a feeling died politely instead of screaming, a residue clinging to stone and breath. [155]
The palace had centuries of them, layered beneath paint and etiquette, soft as dust and just as lethal. [173]
The king wanted those echoes harvested, distilled, and locked away before they could ferment into rebellion. [189]
Iri wanted the opposite. [193]
A guard in lacquered armor bowed and stepped aside, revealing a narrow stair cut into the courtyard well. [211]
From its throat rose a dim shimmer, not of water but of light folded so many times it had forgotten its color. [233]
This was the descent to the prism sanctuary under starlight, a place said to predate the palace itself. [251]
No torches burned below, for light there was born by pressure, by memory, by what people refused to say aloud. [271]
Iri descended, her steps bodily poetic, every shift of weight a line of verse pressed slowly into the cold air. [291]
Her training had not been in bedsheets and perfume, but in observing how a room inhaled and exhaled around secrets. [311]
She had learned that a gaze averted a heartbeat too late left a brighter imprint than a kiss. [329]
Tonight she would gather those imprints, not for the king, but for whatever lay outside his mapped world. [347]
The sanctuary opened into a chamber woven with light, each strand a trembling recollection she could unlock by untangling threads. [367]
Iri slipped off her gloves and reached, not touching the threads but moving her hands alongside them, like wind teaching chimes to remember a storm. [392]
Images startled awake: a boy choking on unshed tears, a minister swallowing an apology, a queen laughing one note too high. [413]
Each echo rattled the chamber, eager to resume the feelings that had birthed it, yet bound to repeat only the moment of refusal. [436]
There was an alarming serenity to their motion, like birds flying in perfect circles around a burning tree. [454]
Iri felt the palace above them like a weight on her ribs, each beat of her heart a muffled drum of defiance. [476]
She began the harvest of echoes, but not as the king intended. [488]
Instead of guiding the threads into the crystal jars waiting on the altar, she wove them together into new constellations. [508]
The chamber brightened, the strands knotting around her wrists and shoulders, drawing poems on her skin in invisible ink. [527]
She let them mark her, let their unspent grief turn her posture into punctuation, her silence into an uprising of pauses. [548]
Above, in the silver courtyard under snow, courtiers felt a shiver without knowing why, their conversations snagging on sudden quiet. [568]
The lullaby of conformity faltered, its melody warping as if someone had bent the palace itself through a prism. [587]
Down below, Iri gathered the echoes into a single, dense hush and drew breath. [601]
Between sigh and smile, she exhaled, sending the hush upward through the well like a reversed blessing. [618]
It reached the courtyard as snowfall suddenly slowing, every flake hanging in the air as if reconsidering its descent. [637]
For one held breath, no one in the palace could remember the rules of how they were supposed to stand, speak, or desire. [660]
The stillness was gentle, almost tender, yet it rang in their bones like an alarm. [675]
In that gap, some straightened from habitual bows, some let their hands fall from ritual gestures, and one young soldier simply closed his eyes and allowed himself to feel tired. [705]
The spell broke, but its memory did not; it clung to them like a question that could no longer be unsaid. [726]
Far below, in the prism sanctuary under starlight, Iri stood alone, her body humming with borrowed echoes, her chastity revealed not as absence but as fierce, untouched choice. [754]
She smiled then, the first true smile of her service, knowing the king would sense the shift and call it treason, yet also knowing that somewhere above, a new kind of listening had already begun. [789]</story>
