<story>On the morning the river ice broke, Ira stepped off the train with paint-stained fingers and restless eyes. [18]
He was a vivid mural artist, quietly driven, carrying a canvas satchel and a question that would not loosen. [37]
The question had grown all winter, across the melting of winter's last snow, soft but relentless as thaw-water. [55]
He had come to the town of Bellmare to understand why flowers bloom at night along its riverbanks. [73]
Locals spoke of black tulips that opened only under starlight, their scent like ink and distant matches. [90]
Ira reckoned there was a story buried in those petals, and stories were the only things he trusted. [108]
At the station edge stood an amber pavilion in autumn colors, though the calendar insisted it was early spring. [127]
Saplings around it flared gold and rust, as if the season itself were painted over the stubborn snowmelt. [145]
He paused under its eaves, feeling the air thicken into a dawning hush that did not belong to day. [164]
Someone had pinned a collection of old postcards along the wooden beams, their corners curled like reluctant petals. [182]
Each postcard showed the same cathedral on the hill, its windows burning with improbable light against a night sky. [201]
Beneath them, in neat ink, was written, They bloom when no one watches. [214]
The handwriting matched the letters that had summoned him here, unsigned except for a tiny sketch of a window. [233]
As he lifted one postcard, a woman stepped from the pavilion shadow, her coat dark as unlit glass. [251]
You touched mine, she said without anger, only a kind of umbral tenderness that made her voice almost blue. [270]
Ira apologized, but she shook her head, introducing herself as Liora, keeper of the cathedral windows and reluctant botanist. [289]
The postcards are a map, she said, not to the cathedral, but through it. [303]
If you want to know the night flowers, you must look through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window. [325]
Her eyes, the color of deep moss, regarded him as though he were another fragile card pinned to wood. [344]
Why send for a muralist, he asked, when you plainly know more than I do. [359]
Because, Liora answered, paint remembers what stone forgets, and glass will only confess to someone who understands color as confession. [379]
She led him up the hill, past gardens still bristling with hoarfrost, where dark buds waited like thoughts not yet spoken. [400]
The cathedral rose ahead, stone ribs catching the pale sun, but its great windows looked oddly dull, like eyes after tears. [421]
Inside, the air glowed with dust and incense, and that same dawning hush settled over Ira's shoulders like a cloak. [441]
Liora brought him to the largest window, where saints and vines and meteors tangled in frozen parade above the altar. [461]
From this side it is sermon, she murmured; from the other, if you are patient, it becomes question. [479]
At her nod, he climbed the narrow stair to the gallery, heart pacing, hands already sketching lines in the stale light. [500]
The window from behind was different, its colored panes veiled by fine etchings of vines, rivers, and little star-shaped flowers. [520]
As the sun slipped toward evening, light entered at a low angle, sliding through the etched glass like water through layered rock. [542]
The vines in the glass bent their shadows onto the stone floor, precisely where the garden beds lay outside the wall. [563]
Night would tilt those shadows differently, Ira realized, guiding moonlight into narrow bands that crossed only certain patches of soil. [583]
The etched saints were not only holy figures; they were careful lenses, granting secrecy to blossoms that feared the brutal sun. [604]
He thought of Liora's postcards, of the amber pavilion in autumn hues against the wrong season, of hands arranging light like petals. [626]
Someone had designed this uncertainty, this gentle misalignment of time, so the flowers could bloom when the world believed them sleeping. [647]
Later, standing again beside Liora in the nave, he tried to explain how the glass turned darkness into a sheltering hand. [668]
Instead he unfolded his sketchbook, filling page after page with murals where nocturnal flowers climbed rooftops and cathedral walls like secret constellations. [690]
Paint, he knew, could carry the pattern back to alleys and tenement courtyards, letting other night gardens learn to listen. [710]
As the cathedral bells tolled and the first true stars appeared, a dawning hush rose again, not of morning, but of understanding. [732]
Ira felt it settle between them, an umbral tenderness shared by glass and flower and two quietly driven strangers who had chosen to see. [756]</story>
