<story>The grotto floated like a green lantern above the clouds, its ferns exhaling mist into skywide silence. [17]
Inside it, time moved with a blushing stillness, each heartbeat softened as though wrapped in moss. [33]
Erin called it home, though her home never stayed in the same place long enough to grow mail. [51]
The grotto was a transiently rooted island, anchored to nothing but the shifting lattice of warm currents. [68]
It drifted with the winds, following rumors of forgotten migrations. [78]
Erin drifted with it, an esoteric realist with pockets full of string and a head full of ghosts. [96]
She believed only what she could touch, and she touched the past by tying it into the present. [114]
Her work began the day the last monarch butterfly rose from the lowlands, searching for a sky that no longer remembered it. [136]
From the mouth of the grotto, Erin watched the solitary ember of orange and black wobble against the light. [155]
Wind buffeted it in interrupted cadences, a broken rhythm of gust and lull that threatened to dash it downward. [174]
Erin felt the pattern in her ribs, the stutter-step pulse of a species being written into silence. [191]
History, she thought, was not lost all at once, but in these little hesitations where stories failed to land. [210]
She had climbed into the world above clouds to find those hesitations and knot them into something that could be seen. [231]
So she went to work, fingers nimble, heart slow. [240]
She plucked long grasses from the grotto walls, their blades cool and wet, and braided them into spires. [258]
She arranged shelves of smooth stone, stacked and unstacked until the pattern suggested a path through air. [275]
Every tower, every arch of branch and fern, was a temporary structure built as a signal, a geometry drawn for wings instead of eyes. [299]
From above, she hoped, the monarch would read the grotto itself as a single outstretched hand. [315]
This was how Erin honored overlooked histories, not by writing names in stone, but by lending shape to their last movements. [336]
The grotto had seen other migrations sputter and fail. [345]
Once, the sky had darkened with passenger pigeons, a living storm that passed below her floating garden. [362]
She had been too young then to build signals, too mystified by abundance to imagine extinction. [378]
Later, she wove little altars of cloud-shadow and seed husks, but the pigeons were already only echoes between gusts. [397]
That helplessness had knotted inside her, a tightness she could not unmake. [409]
Now, as the last monarch faltered, the old knot pulled her toward action instead of grief. [425]
She hung a moth wing from the highest branch at the grotto's edge, its pattern like smoke trapped in parchment. [445]
The moth had died in her palm the previous season, worn thin by lamps it could never quite reach. [464]
She had kept the wing not as a trophy, but as a reminder of how light can confuse the directions a body trusts. [487]
Now it spun gently, catching sun, a faded banner that told the monarch there was shelter in this impossible place. [507]
The butterfly veered, struggling with the interrupted cadence of the wind, and began to climb toward her verdant grotto above the clouds. [529]
Erin held her breath, feeling the stillness blush deeper, as though the whole sky were embarrassed by its history. [548]
The monarch staggered onto a ledge of moss, wings trembling like paper in a slow-burning fire. [564]
Up close, its orange was freckled with translucence, the color of sunset remembered rather than seen. [580]
Erin knelt beside it and spoke aloud the names of every butterfly species she knew, each syllable a small scaffolding against oblivion. [602]
She did not believe the monarch understood the language, only the cadence, the way it refused to stop where endings usually came. [624]
The butterfly flexed, antennae tasting the air, reading the temporary towers of grass and stone the way a sailor reads stars. [645]
It moved from ledge to ledge, following a line of petals Erin had laid out like stepping stones across a river. [666]
With each hesitant flutter, she adjusted the structures, shifting a twig here, untangling a dangling root there, answering its doubts in architecture. [688]
The grotto, usually content to hum its own leafy music, seemed to listen, holding back drips and creaks so nothing would startle the traveler. [712]
At last the monarch reached the heart of the grotto, where Erin had left a shallow bowl carved from stone and lined with dew. [736]
It lowered its proboscis and drank, the motion delicate, insistently alive. [747]
Erin understood it would not live long; its journey had already outlasted the maps etched into its blood. [765]
But for this moment, the world had bent around one small history and let it arrive. [781]
The sky, embarrassed and forgiven, resumed its wandering, and the grotto drifted on. [794]</story>
