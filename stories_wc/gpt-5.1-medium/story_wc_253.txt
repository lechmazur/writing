<story>The wind turbines loomed like pale, turning skeletons above the farmhouse, their shadows sliding over the cracked yard. [18]
Inside, the performer sat at the kitchen table with a blank face and a chipped mug of cooling tea. [37]
On the table lay a dried flower bouquet, bleached beige and thin as old paper. [52]
It had once been bright enough to sting the eyes, back before the Happiness Mandate and the arrests for gloom. [72]
Now brightness was regulated, measured in smiles per hour, laughter per conversation, gratitude per breath. [87]
The performer was officially a State Joy Amplifier, trained to entertain and correct the moods of rural households. [105]
Unofficially, they had come to this farmhouse to break the law in the smallest, quietest way they could imagine. [124]
They were here to cultivate lightness in grief, which the Mandate listed as a prohibited emotional paradox. [141]
Across from them sat Mara, shoulders rounded, eyes dry from too many days of required cheer. [157]
There were no more tears left for her dead brother, only a bruised numbness that the government measured as improved. [177]
The performer cleared their throat and began, not with a joke, but with the spoon in their hand. [195]
This, they announced, was a heroic instrument, sworn to stir the universe of Mara's tea counterclockwise into rebellion. [213]
Their voice was rich and steady, dramatically narrating mundane tasks as if each carried the fate of empires. [231]
Mara watched, uncertain, as the spoon sank and rose like a slow comet in the chipped mug. [248]
Outside, the turbines thumped the air, a constant mechanical cheer that made true silence impossible. [263]
The performer decided that if the world would not allow silence, they would fashion something near to it. [281]
They reached into their bag and drew out a small block of soft pine and a folding knife. [299]
Under the turbines' low drone, they began to whittle, each curl of wood falling like a quiet syllable. [317]
Mara frowned, because crafting unauthorized objects during a mandated joy visit was at least morally ambiguous, possibly sedition. [335]
What are you doing, actually, not theatrically, she asked in a flat voice. [348]
The performer shaved another strip from the pine and let it fall among the wood shavings like pale petals. [367]
I am building a hush that the machines cannot measure, they said, eyes on the grain. [383]
A remade hush, one that lives in actions instead of absence. [394]
They narrated every cut as if it were a chapter title, turning the slow carving into a saga Mara had not asked for. [417]
Behold, the heroic reduction of unnecessary volume, they intoned, as a corner of pine dropped with the softest tap. [436]
Mara felt the corners of her mouth threaten movement, something like almost-laughter, and clamped them down by force of habit. [456]
Laughter had become exhausting since the Mandate, a gym exercise for the face, supervised, scored, and archived. [473]
What if someone reports you, she said, glancing toward the window, where the nearest turbine carried surveillance sensors under its blades. [494]
They will see a State Joy Amplifier dramatically improving the narrative texture of domestic experience, the performer replied without expression. [514]
And privately, we will both know that grief is sitting at the table with us, allowed to breathe without smiling. [534]
They finished the whittling and held out a rough wooden figure, something between a turbine and a flower. [552]
Its petals were blades, its blades were petals, and its center was a hollow that invited the eye to rest. [572]
Place it beside the bouquet, the performer said, as if giving stage directions to a hesitant actor. [589]
Mara obeyed, setting the wooden hybrid among the dried flower bouquet so that dead stems cradled new, unfinished grain. [608]
The turbines outside kept turning, but for a moment their thudding became part of the room instead of an intrusion. [628]
The performer described the silence that was not silence, the hush that was built from wood shavings, cooling tea, and breathing. [649]
They spoke as if every heartbeat were a stage cue, as if Mara's still face were an audience waiting to be safely moved. [672]
Deep inside, she felt nothing shift, no flood of feeling, only a slight easing, like loosening a belt one notch. [692]
It was not happiness, and therefore it might be dangerous, but she let it stay. [707]
The performer gathered their knife and shavings, leaving the wooden figure and the dried bouquet as quiet co-conspirators on the table. [728]
When they stepped out into the turbine-shadowed yard, their face was still blank, but inside they carried the remade hush like contraband. [750]</story>
