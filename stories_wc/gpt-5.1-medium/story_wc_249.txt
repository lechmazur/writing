<story>They said I was lucky to be selected, but experimental treatment guinea pigs are not supposed to remember the cage. [20]
I remember everything, though, as if the injections turned my nerves into film and my thoughts into relentless projectors. [39]
They called the drug Chorus, promising it would unspool trauma by disentangling memories, but it bound mine tighter instead. [58]
Now my mind feels like a knot of headphone wires, braided with other peoples nightmares and nearly impossible to separate. [78]
I first noticed the entangled memories the night they let us walk through the sound wave garden. [95]
The facility architects had carved stone ridges into concentric ripples, as if someone had dropped infinity into concrete. [113]
Speakers hidden under the gravel pulsed subsonic chords, making the ground tremble like a heartbeat echoing beneath skin. [131]
We were supposed to shuffle in preapproved loops, but I have always been quietly rebellious in ways nobody checks for. [151]
So I slipped behind a pillar of mossed stone, following the basslines vibration toward a shimmer at the gardens far edge. [172]
There, impossible and patient, waited the auric lagoon under starlight, cupped in broken marble like a secret the earth forgot. [192]
No one had mentioned water, only stages and scanners, but the lagoon hummed in sympathy with the buried speakers. [211]
The surface flickered in pale gold waves, translating the low chords into light that ran across it like whispered sentences. [231]
A thin railing circled the pool, presumably to keep good little subjects from falling in, so naturally I chose to perch there. [253]
My hospital gown cracked in the cold, and my fingers began their old habit, drumming on everything within reach. [272]
The metal rail clicked under my knuckles, sending new ripples into the music, into the light, into whatever slept below. [292]
That was when the world seemed to pause, arriving at the hush of the universe inhaling before some cosmic verdict. [312]
Stars overhead sharpened, every point a needle, and the auric lagoon brightened until I saw my reflection and someone elses, overlapping. [333]
Her eyes looked out through my face, hazel instead of brown, and a scar split her upper lip like a white river. [355]
When she lifted a hand, mine followed, fingers blurring across the rail, drumming a pattern that was not entirely mine. [375]
Entangled memories, I realized, were not just fragments crossing wires inside my skull; they were bridges leading out. [393]
She was one of the others in the trial, maybe earlier, maybe later; time jittered like bad reception around her. [413]
Behind her, I glimpsed a room with rounded walls of living wood, leaves vibrating as if the tree were listening. [433]
Other faces flickered through us like skipped frames, strangers whose names I had never heard yet somehow loved with aching familiarity. [454]
The Chorus drug had tied our recollections together, an accidental choir of lives humming underneath my single voice. [472]
I understood then the true purpose our handlers would never admit: to breathe life into a shared dream vast enough to steer humanity. [495]
If they could align our entangled memories, they could tune an entire population like strings, plucking us toward whatever future they preferred. [517]
The thought draped over me in auroral sorrow, luminous and cold, beautiful in the way distant disasters can be. [536]
I could feel the others terror, their hope, their quiet rebellions, all braided into mine like strands of spectral hair. [556]
One memory rose above the rest - a child drawing circles in dirt, saying that every person deserved a garden of their own. [579]
Another showed a protest hidden in plain sight, patients rearranging cafeteria trays into constellations that spelled the word Enough. [598]
These were not just scenes; they were instructions passed through our connected minds, code smuggled under the wardens radar. [617]
Perched above the lagoon, I tapped faster, my drumming on everything becoming a signal instead of a nervous tic. [636]
The water mirrored my rhythm in pulses of gold, and I felt the others notice, their attention sliding toward me like tide. [658]
Together, without words, we leaned into the borrowed dream, testing its walls, pressing against the shapes they had drawn for us. [679]
The garden around me blurred; the rippling stone circles expanded into rings of possibility, each one another version of tomorrow. [699]
At the center, where the lagoon should have been, I saw only open sky, waiting for whatever song we chose to begin. [721]</story>
