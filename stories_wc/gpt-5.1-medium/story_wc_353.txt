<story>Morning comes late to the siskin alder grove, as if light tiptoes on its toes. [15]
In this intensely quiet hollow, even the breeze seems to hold its breath. [28]
Work begins only after the hedgehog uncurls from its mossy sleep beside the roots. [42]
When the tiny creature stretches and waddles off, Lio rises to greet the trees. [56]
Lio is a tree-song sculptor, the last in a lineage no one else remembers. [70]
In a world where sound disappeared generations ago, his craft is considered useless curiosity. [84]
Yet he wakes each day driven to create music in a silent world. [97]
Lio is symphonically minded, though the symphonies live entirely in the motions of things. [111]
He reads swaying branches like scores, and fallen leaves like scattered, unheard notes. [124]
Today his attention returns to the tallest alder, whose trunk twists around a porcelain insulator. [139]
The insulator once guided the hum of electric speech along vanished copper wires above the grove. [155]
Now it hangs uselessly, a smooth white remnant of a time when messages traveled as sound. [171]
Lio cups it gently, feeling its chill, and wonders how silence first captured the world. [186]
Elders tell of a storm that peeled noise from the air like bark from birch. [201]
The last echoes, they say, were trapped inside a sculpture standing in the old stone square. [217]
That sculpture shattered long ago, but Lio once found its buried fragments outside the deserted town. [233]
He mapped the spidering fractures, believing the cracks recorded the moment when the world went mute. [249]
He learned by analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture, tracing each line like a melody. [265]
Those lines led him here, to this grove where wires once sang and now lie rusted underground. [282]
If sound is gone, he reasons, perhaps its empathy remains, waiting for motion to wake it. [298]
Empathy in motion, he calls the feeling when fingers on bark seem to echo in his chest. [315]
He believes music is not only heard but also shared through patterns of touch and movement. [331]
So he has shaped living instruments from the alders, careful not to wound them more than necessary. [348]
Curved slits guide the wind across their hollowed knots, and hidden cords of bark wait to be strummed. [366]
He threads old copper through the porcelain insulator, stretching it between two trunks like a silent breath. [383]
As he works, footsteps whisper over leaf mold, and Ina appears at the edge of the grove. [400]
Ina cannot remember sound at all, but she feels vibrations better than anyone Lio knows. [415]
Her palms, scarred from years of pressing them to rails and hollow logs, are her instruments. [431]
You are late, she signs with a raised eyebrow, then rests her hand against the alder trunk. [448]
Lio answers with a shrug, then places her fingers along the copper so she can feel his plan. [466]
He shows her the sketchbook where fractures from the broken sculpture spiral into designs for living instruments. [483]
The cracks seemed to move, he writes, as if the stone were trying to remember how to sing. [501]
Ina traces the drawn lines, then nods slowly, understanding that he is chasing the shape of lost reactions. [519]
If we move together, she signs, maybe the world will move with us. [532]
They stand on either side of the insulator, hands poised on the copper, feet braced in the leaf litter. [551]
Lio breathes deeply, then lets his fingers strum the wire in a slow, deliberate arc. [566]
No sound rises, but the motion trembles through the copper, into the trees, and down into the soil. [584]
Ina gasps silently as the alder under her palm shudders, its leaves rippling in careful, measured waves. [601]
Around them, mushrooms tilt, blades of grass sway, and even the hedgehog pauses mid-sniff to feel. [617]
The grove begins to move as one, each living thing responding with minute adjustments, like dancers obeying an unheard rhythm. [637]
Lio senses their bodies answering each other, empathy in motion flowing through shared patterns of sway and stillness. [655]
Though no note reaches his ears, he feels chords form between trunks, mushrooms, hedgehog, Ina, and himself. [672]
His eyes blur as the grove sways, and he realizes this is music shaped entirely from connection. [689]
The world remains silent, yet everywhere around him motion carries feeling the way sound once did. [705]
Exhausted, he and Ina sink to the ground, hands still touching the trembling roots of the alder. [722]
When at last the hedgehog curls again into its mossy nest, the grove settles, but the new music continues inside every moving body. [745]
Lio closes his eyes, feeling the quiet pulse between his ribs, and knows he has finally created music in a silent world. [767]</story>
