<story>The orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches turned slowly beneath a copper sky. [14]
Every dusk, when gravity inverts for an hour, the trees let go of their fruit and the fruit fell upward. [34]
Lio, an intrepid orchard pilot, timed his flights to that impossible tide. [46]
In the whirling silence that followed the inversion, engines were unnecessary; even thoughts seemed to drift. [62]
He steered by fingertips on bark, by wind on eyelids, by the tug of the rising harvest. [79]
Tonight he was navigating by water flow instead of starlight, chasing the silver threads that poured from the levitating wells. [99]
They streamed uphill through soil and sky alike, drawing shimmering canals between the roots and the drifting arches. [117]
Lio followed them to find the source of resilience that kept the orchards thriving in a universe that should have torn them apart. [140]
He had seen planets crumble, seas boil, and cities spin into the dark, yet this world of branches and stones endured. [161]
The elders said the answer lay in the high groves where no one walked, where the roots drank more sky than water. [183]
So he had retrofitted a pruning glider into a hushed skiff and learned to ride the inverted hour like a migratory bird. [205]
Below him now, the orchards stretched in concentric terraces, dim under the thickening dusk, leaves trembling for the moment of release. [226]
Above, the floating rock arches cast slow shadows like sleeping serpents, their undersides veined with streams that refused to fall. [246]
When the bells of the gravity clocks chimed together, soundless in his helm, the world shuddered and turned inside out. [266]
Dust lifted from the paths, tools drifted from sheds, and the first apples slipped their stems to sail toward the sky. [287]
Lio rose with them, the skiff expanding around him as its woven branches relaxed into weightlessness. [303]
He cut the motor, trusting the currents of inverted pull and the thin guides of water. [319]
Under his boots, sap channels brightened, glowing like constellations drawn in roots, all flowing uphill toward the forbidden groves. [338]
Every traceried line promised an answer, or at least another question shaped like a seed. [353]
As he drifted past the last tended terrace, he saw the first sign that the water was not just water. [373]
Where it touched bare stone, moss erupted in a heartbeat, fanning out in fractal greens around a force that accelerates plant growth before his eyes. [398]
Tiny shoots thickened into branches, blossoms flared and withered, and pods fattened, all within a drifting breath. [415]
The air smelled of sap and rain and something older, like stone remembering forests. [429]
He knew stories of engineers and alchemists searching for such a force to mend ruined worlds, yet here it spilled wild and unattended. [452]
Something must be guarding it, or ignoring it, and he did not know which possibility frightened him more. [470]
The skiff bumped a rising branch and spun slowly, and in that lazy spin he saw the circle of stones ahead. [491]
They formed a halo around a hollow at the heart of the highest grove, each stone pierced by a natural archway so that the whole structure resembled a vast crown. [521]
Water surged through the arches, rising in perfect loops before spilling into the air and breaking into glittering droplets that refused to drift apart. [545]
They circled one another like planets in miniature, and among them shimmered shapes that were not quite light. [563]
Lio tightened his harness and angled the skiff into the hollow, feeling his breath slow as the world fell away on every side. [586]
Sound vanished entirely as he crossed the threshold, replaced by a gathering of echoes that did not touch his ears but his bones. [609]
Memories vibrated inside him: his first flight, his sister laughing from a swaying ladder, the moment his home moon cracked like an egg. [632]
The droplets around him flickered with images not his own, storms and droughts and saplings pushing through shattered pavement. [651]
He realized the waters carried not just minerals and spores but impressions of every struggle they had ever passed, stored in motion and pattern. [675]
From the center of the hollow jutted a stone pedestal, and on it rested a broken arrow tip the color of dry blood. [698]
It pulsed faintly with each looping surge, as if the planet itself were a bow forever releasing and recalling the same shot. [720]
He reached out, and the moment his fingers brushed the metal, he did discover what he had come seeking, though not as he had imagined. [745]
The arrow was a seed of intention, fired ages ago by someone who had refused to let their world die, its will etched into the flow of water and stone. [775]
Their defiance had sunk into the planet, teaching rivers to climb and roots to drink sky, turning every cycle of loss into fuel. [798]</story>
