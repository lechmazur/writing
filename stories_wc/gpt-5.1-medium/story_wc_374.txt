<story>I arrived at the lavender bluff under aurora on the night the trees were counting their votes. [17]
They call it an election when the forests decide which roots get promoted to memory and which are allowed to forget. [38]
I had waited years to come here while forests hold elections, because that is when the sky listens hardest. [57]
In those days I was known as the luminous skeptic, half for my bioluminescent skin and half for my doubt. [77]
I had come to learn why some people carry weather with them, trailing cloudbursts or droughts wherever they walk. [96]
The old climatologist on the coast said the answer would be written in taste, if I could stand to notice it. [117]
He called it sensing through taste changes, a way of reading the moods of spacetime with your tongue. [135]
For that, he gave me a tin compass ring, dull and gray, stamped with directions no mapmaker would recognize. [154]
He said the ring was an emergent compass, not pointing north or south but toward whatever pattern was trying to be born. [176]
Its pull, he promised, would feel terrestrially cosmic, like gravity with an accent, local yet impossibly far-reaching. [193]
On the bluff, the aurora draped itself low enough to brush the cliff grass, making every blade glow with hesitant color. [214]
Below, waves rolled in slow, luminous lines, as if the sea were trying to imitate the sky and nearly succeeding. [234]
Around me, the voting trees rustled, their leaves clicking like beads on an abacus as sap tallied up the seasons. [254]
Every few minutes a branch lifted or lowered, a silent yes or no in the forest parliament. [271]
I slipped the ring onto my middle finger, feeling its cheap metal cool against the faint glow of my skin. [291]
Immediately, the air tasted of rust and distant lightning, a flavor I had not known since childhood storms over the flooded plains. [313]
As I walked toward the edge, the taste shifted, sweetening with something like burnt sugar and pine resin. [331]
I realized the emergent compass was pulling not on my hand but on my tongue, guiding me by flavor rather than force. [353]
It led me to a patch of earth where the grass grew in spirals, each tuft leaning toward an invisible center. [374]
There, three strangers were already waiting, their silhouettes backlit by the aurora like cutouts from an old postcard of the future. [395]
Their coats shimmered with moving weather, tiny storm cells blooming and dissolving across the fabric, a private climate for each. [415]
One carried sunlight that kept breaking into evening, another wore a drizzle that never reached the ground, and the third was wrapped in slow snow. [440]
I tasted ozone, salt, and something like old paper, and I knew these were the people who carried weather with them. [461]
The ring grew warm, then warmer, until its tin melted into my skin like a second, metallic vein. [479]
I asked them why, and the one with the ever-falling snow smiled sadly, as if remembering a forecast that never arrived. [500]
Because the world needed a way to converge its scattered seasons, she said, and someone had to volunteer their body as the meeting place. [524]
Long ago, when the oceans rose into the clouds and stayed there, our grandparents stitched emergency climates into our blood. [544]
We became walking archives of rain and frost and sunlight, she continued, so the planet would remember how to change. [564]
But archives are heavy, the one with evening sunlight added, and sometimes the weather leaks out through our moods. [583]
When we are lonely, the storms last longer; when we are loved, the droughts break early. [599]
I remembered the years I had spent denying that my glow meant anything, insisting I was only a luminous skeptic and nothing more. [622]
Yet there, under the aurora, the taste of the air shifted again, now flavored with recognition, like biting into water you once called home. [646]
The ring pulsed, and images surfaced on my tongue: thunderstorms trapped in subway tunnels, children teaching clouds to spell their names, cities shading themselves with borrowed fog. [673]
I understood then that my doubt was not a wall but a lens, and the world wanted me to focus it on these weather-bearers. [697]
Will you help us remember how to let go, the drizzle-wrapped stranger asked, her voice like rain on old tin roofs. [718]
I tasted the question, bitter and bright, and answered without words as the forests finalized their vote and the aurora dimmed to a promise. [742]
In that fleeting, terrestrially cosmic twilight, we stood together on the lavender bluff under aurora, four small bodies carrying the weather of a larger tomorrow. [767]</story>
