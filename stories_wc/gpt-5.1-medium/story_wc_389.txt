<story>The observatory floated above the cloudline like a chipped teacup left on the lip of the world. [17]
Stormlight kept licking its rusted ribs, bleaching the metal a trembling silver whenever lightning threaded through the swollen sky below. [37]
Inside this stormlit observatory above clouds, a lonely visionary named Ilen tuned a forest of radios that never fully agreed with each other. [60]
They coughed static, hummed hymns in mismatched keys, and occasionally whispered things that made his lungs forget how to breathe. [80]
The messages arrived through fragmented radio frequencies, shivering shards of speech and song bouncing off unseen machinery in the rain-fat atmosphere. [101]
Ilen called it the Choir of Rust, because naming the chaos made it slightly less likely to eat his thoughts. [121]
He lived here alone, by choice and by exile, mopping condensation from the cobalt glass portico that ringed the observatory like a halo fallen sideways. [146]
Beneath that portico, the clouds roiled in bruised purples and feverous greens, as if the sky were brewing potions for gods with low standards. [170]
Ilen had come with a mission that sounded noble when written in grant proposals and slightly unhinged when he muttered it to the drip trays. [195]
He wanted to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows, coaxing forgotten transmissions from lost civilizations into a pattern that humanity could live by. [219]
The academy had called him lyrically prophetic and funded him because it sounded cheaper than building another space elevator. [238]
They also assumed he would fail quietly, far above their budgets and reputations. [251]
But the radios were changing, and so was he. [260]
The signals had started to demonstrate variant allegiance, sometimes echoing his questions, sometimes contradicting them, and sometimes answering conversations he had not yet begun. [284]
It was as if the Choir were a council of overlapping futures, each voting on which version of Ilen they preferred to speak with. [308]
One storm-night, when the sky sounded like gravel poured over drums, a new voice unfolded out of the static. [327]
Unlike the others, it did not stutter, warble, or echo; it arrived whole, like a knife slid expertly into conversation. [347]
HELLO, ILEN, it said, the letters forming in his head as clearly as if someone knuckled them onto the back of his skull. [370]
He jerked, knocking over a mug of lukewarm tea that had achieved its own ecosystem of floating, abstract molds. [389]
You should clean more, the voice noted, almost gently, as the mold colonies marched toward the drain like tiny doomed pilgrims. [410]
Ilen swallowed, tasted metal and insomnia, and turned every dial until the needles fluttered like panicked birds behind glass. [429]
Who is this, he asked, aware that he was finally talking to the experiment instead of merely about it. [448]
A candidate, the voice replied, for a role that does not yet exist but will insist it always has. [467]
You might call it prophet, though the job description is undergoing renovations. [479]
The word hung in the buzzing air, heavy with every story that had ever ended poorly for someone chosen by mysterious forces. [501]
Across the rise of a prophet, the voice continued, there must first be a listener willing to be wrong about everything, including themselves. [524]
Ilen laughed once, the sound scraping like a chair on concrete, because gritty whimsy had always been his last defense against sincerity. [546]
And what do you need from a listener, he said, besides better housekeeping. [559]
Allegiance, the voice answered, but of a particular sort, the variant allegiance you offer your own future when you are not yet sure you deserve it. [585]
Stand under your cobalt glass portico when the next storm crest arrives, and do not flinch, no matter what unfolds from the clouds. [608]
If you can obey, you will help me edit history into a version where dawn remembers its debts to darkness. [628]
Disobey, and I will find another, but the replacement will be worse at metaphors. [642]
The promise and the threat braided together around his ribs, and he realized the choice had probably been made years ago. [663]
He remembered being a child in a blackout, tracing constellations on the ceiling with a flashlight, inventing heroic stories for the stains. [685]
Back then he had believed the dark kindly lent the light somewhere to stand. [699]
Now, older and more eroded, he stood beneath the portico as thunderheads climbed toward him like mountainous animals smelling a new trainer. [721]
Rain lashed the cobalt panels, turning the world into a warped aquarium where he was both specimen and curious child pressing his face to the glass. [747]
The voice poured through the radios in layered choruses, languages folding over each other, a tide of potential futures arguing cheerfully about which one would hurt least. [774]
He did not know if he was rising or falling, only that the dawn would remember this bargain. [792]</story>
