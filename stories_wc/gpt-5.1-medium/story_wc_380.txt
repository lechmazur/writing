<story>The night after the whale beached itself below the harbor wall, the lanterns refused to stay lit. [17]
I was the dock-side lantern lighter, and it was my job to coax their flames awake. [33]
But every time my taper kissed a wick, the fire folded inward, as if swallowed by invisible pockets of gravity. [53]
The harbor lay in a gleaming silence broken only by the dull shudder of the tide against the stranded whale. [73]
Moonlight silvered its massive flank, and the town kept its distance, pretending not to smell the slow souring of its flesh. [94]
I felt the whale watching us with the blind side of its skin. [107]
Each time a lantern snuffed itself, the darkness around its hook thickened, as if a small, private night were blooming there. [128]
My father once said that light is only what escapes gravity, and I laughed because he found omens in coffee grounds. [149]
He would whirl the dark slurry in his cracked cup, then read the future through patterns in coffee grounds clinging to the porcelain. [172]
Those constellations of residue told him when storms would come, when ships would not, and when a man would forget his own name. [195]
Memory, he said, fluctuates mysteriously, as if it, too, were tugged by hidden tides. [209]
Back then I thought he meant ordinary forgetting, the kind that leaves only a soft indentation where a thought once sat. [230]
But after the whale came ashore and the lanterns began to fail, people started losing days as if someone had torn them from the calendar. [255]
A conversation would end, and when it resumed, the other person stared at you with the dismay of a house whose door no longer matches its frame. [282]
They remembered you, but not the thread that had bound you together five minutes before. [297]
Some of us began to wonder where the missing pieces went, and whether the failing lanterns were marking the entry points. [318]
In the mornings I tended the salt crystal growing chamber built in the gutted warehouse by the piers. [336]
It had once stored cod, but now glass trays stretched in ordered rows, each seeded with brine that climbed itself into glittering prisms. [359]
The town council claimed the crystals would draw new trade, though no one could explain why they pulsed faintly when I walked between them. [383]
Sometimes, if I paused, I felt the same thickening of air as by the darkened lanterns, as if tiny pockets of gravity were nesting inside the salt. [410]
I kept a notebook of these disturbances, marking where and when the crystals blurred, when a lantern died without smoke, when a neighbor stumbled mid-sentence. [435]
On their own the entries were nonsense, but together they formed a ragged constellation like the grounds in my father's cup. [456]
It came to me that what he had read was never weather, but the shifting gravity of forgetting. [474]
If memory fluctuates, then there are troughs where it drains away, and peaks where it pools too deep to reach. [494]
The dead whale, I suspected, had lodged itself in such a trough, plugging some channel we were never meant to see. [515]
Each failed lantern and trembling crystal was a leak around the edges. [527]
The notion settled over me in that gleaming silence, clear and cold as the moonlight on the whale's skin. [546]
If the town was shedding hours and days, perhaps they lay somewhere close, layered like silt just beyond our senses. [566]
To find where deleted memories go, I would have to exhume them as carefully as gravekeepers lift bones from soil. [586]
But I had no shovel for the mind, only my father's habit and the strange apparatus of salt and light. [606]
That night I brewed coffee in the warehouse, the bitter smell at odds with the clean sting of mineral air. [626]
I poured it into my father's cup, which I had kept wrapped in cloth with a book of pressed wildflowers from the hills above town. [651]
The flowers had lost their scent but not their colors; they glowed faintly in the lamplight like memories flattened to thinness yet refusing to vanish. [676]
I drank, then upended the cup over a glass tray, letting the last drops spatter the salt beside the forming crystals. [697]
When I turned the cup upright, the grounds clung not to porcelain but to the edges of the nearest crystal, arranging themselves in tight, crooked lines. [723]
They looked like the tide marks left on the harbor wall, except these marks curved inward, spiraling toward points that were not there. [746]
As I watched, the air above each spiral thickened, my breath slowing as though my chest had been filled with wet sand. [768]
In those dim pockets I saw flashes of faces mid-laugh, arguments half spoken, the missing days circling like stunned fish. [788]
The crystals hummed, and the silence gleamed around me. [797]</story>
