<story>I am the corporate memory keeper, but most days it feels like I am only tending ghosts. [17]
My office sits at the center of the social network archive, a humming cathedral of obsolete lives. [34]
Every scroll, every tagged photo, every flung-off comment is backed up in chilled racks that never sleep. [51]
People think deletion is a clean erasure, but the system only routes the data somewhere I am not allowed to see. [72]
That not-knowing is a stone in my shoe, my private reason to keep watching so brightly attentive. [89]
Officially, my job is to curate legacy feeds for bereaved families and legal teams and marketing retrospectives. [106]
Unofficially, I work a missing persons cold case the company refuses to admit exists. [120]
Her name was Ora Quin, a junior data designer who wrote the happiest bug reports I have ever read. [139]
Two years ago she walked into the archive to debug a corrupt cluster and never badged out. [156]
No cameras, no logs, just a black square of time across the echo of forgotten songs the servers keep humming. [176]
Security ran their scripts, posted a small reward, and quietly let her profile drift into the memorial garden of the platform. [197]
But the morning after she disappeared, I began seeing the same three numbers everywhere in the archive. [214]
They flickered in ad impressions, follower counts, timestamps, even in the checksum tails of backup manifests. [230]
713, over and over, like the system had learned to stutter. [241]
At first I flagged it as a glitch, but the report bounced back stamped RESOLVED without any attached explanation. [260]
RESOLVED in our system is not a verdict, it is a lie we tell regulators and ourselves. [277]
The next time I rebuilt a deceased user's timeline for their family, the recurring numbers appeared in the auto-suggested songs. [297]
Track seven, minute one, second three, highlighted in a soft blue she used for her interface prototypes. [314]
Ora had obsessed over humane design, about interfaces that respected silence as much as chatter. [329]
She once told me the archive felt like a choir forced to sing commercial jingles, and that one day she would rewrite its score. [353]
So when 713 kept resurfacing, I wondered if she was humming from wherever deleted files go. [369]
Deleted does not mean gone; it means moved to a place with fewer witnesses and more rules. [386]
The company scripts call it Deep Cold, a vault for things we might need to resurrect under subpoena or scandal. [406]
Access requires multi-signed warrants I will never hold, but the archive loves patterns more than policy. [422]
If Ora had hidden herself, she would have braided the clue into the system's favorite habit, its tendency to echo. [442]
I began tracing every instance of 713, stitching them on my private dashboard until a map emerged. [459]
The numbers orbited certain accounts, users who had vanished without the usual flurry of goodbye posts or grief reactions. [478]
Their profiles showed a last login to the physical offices, then nothing but dust and birthday reminders. [495]
They were not just users; they were employees assigned to privacy, moderation, compliance, each role too close to the bones of the machine. [518]
In a locked drawer I keep a patch from a crashed spaceship mission, a souvenir from Ora's desk that nobody else wanted. [540]
Its threadbare orbit and tilted star remind me that official stories are always comfortingly incomplete. [555]
The mission report said equipment failure, but the recovered flight data hinted at deliberate silence, radios turned off on purpose. [575]
Ora used to rub the patch like a worry stone and say that some crashes were really escapes. [593]
The night I decided to follow 713 into Deep Cold, I pinned the patch to my lanyard as if it were a keycard. [616]
I spoofed a review audit, telling the system I needed a random sampling of archived deletions for quality assurance. [635]
That was another lie, one the logs would keep as faithfully as any truth. [649]
When the gateway finally yielded a sliver, it was music that slipped through, a playlist compiled from deactivated accounts. [668]
The tracks crossfaded in impossible ways, voices answering themselves from different languages, beats aligning like planets. [684]
Threaded between them were moments of silence tagged 7:01:03, each quiet pocket a doorway the interface pretended not to notice. [704]
In those silences I could feel a sensed absence, like the brief pressure in a room after someone slips out and closes the door. [728]
I wrote a query that should not exist, treating silence itself as content, and the archive, fond of paradox, returned coordinates. [749]
They did not point to any server room or backup tape, but to a buried subnet where profiles continued after deletion, stripped of ads and metrics and public reach. [778]
I closed the interface, knowing at last where deleted files go, and who chooses to stay. [794]</story>
