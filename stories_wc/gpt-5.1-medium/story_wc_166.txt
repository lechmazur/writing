<story>The night the garden chooses me, the sky is a bruised violet bowl trembling on the edge of darkness. [19]
Around the twilight garden under stars, lantern-moths drift in slow spirals, their wings dusting every leaf with a quiet phosphorescent hush. [40]
I am a skilled tide dancer, apprenticed once to harbors and moonpull, now in elective exile from the cities that outlaw remembering. [62]
It has been ten years since the nostalgia ban severed our songs from their histories, cutting every story loose from the shore of before. [86]
Here, beyond the surveillance buoys, the garden floats on a shallow lagoon, spontaneously anchored to the moon-tugged sand by roots of black glass. [109]
In its mirrored paths I practice my steps with obsidian grace, coaxing the tides to rise, bow, and hush at the flick of my heel. [134]
I dance not for spectacle, but to gather the right currents for a single forbidden act: to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin. [158]
The verse will carry memory where no scanner looks, etched into the dermal constellations, hiding whole galaxies between freckles and scars. [179]
For ink, I guard a moonstone cabochon dust speck in a hollow of my tooth, contraband so small it rides my breath unseen. [202]
I learned to dance the currents of law and absence by observing gaps: the pauses in patrol routes, the hesitations in official voices, the blank spaces left where names once lived. [233]
Tonight the gaps have aligned, and someone is coming across the lagoon, guided by the rumor that the last tide dancer can teach memories to fledge. [259]
I see the skiff first as a smudge against the ruined city glow, then as a narrow shadow slipping through the reeds toward my shore. [284]
The passenger climbs out, water sheeting from their coat, eyes bright with the reckless clarity of someone who has already lost everything nostalgia once offered. [309]
"You are Mareh," they say, my outlaw name, the one I buried when I chose exile over amnesia. [327]
Names are ghosts here," I answer, listening for drones between the waves, but yes, I am the one who still remembers how water reads us. [352]
They peel back their sleeve, revealing an arm mapped with pale, empty skin. [365]
"I want a story that the ban cannot burn," they say, voice shaking on the word story as if it were contraband by itself. [389]
For a moment my elective exile trembles; the garden feels less like sanctuary and more like a taut rope stretched between us and the listening world. [415]
If I inscribe them, their skin becomes a lighthouse, and the authorities have grown adept at reading new lights on the banned spectrum. [438]
Yet the currents are right, and the gaps I have studied for years yawn open tonight like invitation, like a held breath waiting to become word. [464]
I nod and bite gently into my molar, freeing the moonstone cabochon dust speck, which shivers on my tongue like condensed moonlight. [486]
I walk to the lagoon, let a wave kiss my ankles, and flick the speck into the rippling shallows, where it blossoms into a faint, swirling glow. [513]
The tide answers my call as I step into the pattern, every gesture a verb, every spin a clause, the water writing itself around my ankles. [539]
By observing gaps between wavecrests, I read the unwritten, drawing the unspoken ache of the stranger into the shifting grammar of foam and starlight. [563]
The verse begins to fledge from the water, first as scattered droplets hanging impossibly in the air, then as lines of liquid script orbiting the stranger's bare arm. [591]
With obsidian grace I guide each line down, letting the glowing ink sink into their skin, threading between hairs and pores like rivers carving canyons. [616]
The cosmic verse is not words but trajectories: maps of ancestors erased from records, of homes leveled after the ban, of children who will never know why their elders fall silent at dusk. [649]
To scanners it will register as harmless scar tissue, but under starlight and saltwater the patterns will bloom, calling lost moments back like tide returning to a forsaken cove. [678]
When the last filament sinks, I feel the price: a sliver of my own memory unmoors, drifting out with the retreating waves. [700]
I cannot recall my brother's face anymore, only the silhouette of his laughter, but I know it lives now in the stranger's newly mapped firmament. [725]
They look at their arm, at the faint shimmer fading into ordinary flesh, and tears track down, surprised, as if grief itself were a contraband sensation. [751]
As they depart, their skiff dim against the waking horizon, the twilight garden under stars feels less like my exile and more like a quiet rebellion still learning to breathe. [781]</story>
