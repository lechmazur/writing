<story>The first time I woke up after seeing my own grave, the ceiling beams looked like frozen lightning. [18]
They split the mountain ranger cabin into jagged panels of shadow and moonlight, as if reality were misfiled. [36]
I lay on the top bunk, listening to the wind argue with the shutters, trying to remember what year it was. [57]
Chronologically confused is what the therapist in town calls it, but she has never watched her own funeral from six angles at once. [80]
Out here they call it mountain sickness or ghost weather, and they leave an extra cup on the table, just in case. [102]
I call it my job. [107]
I am the lucid dream chronicler for this forgotten stretch of peaks, the unofficial archivist of everyone who ever slept too close to the sky. [132]
The park service hired me after my third documented death, when they realized I kept bringing back maps from places you could only visit by dying a little. [160]
The maps are not on paper, of course, but on narrow curls of birch bark scroll, peeled from trees that never grew. [182]
I wake with resin on my fingers and the sharp green smell of sap in my throat, and the scrolls waiting on the bedside chair. [207]
They are always written in my handwriting, but by someone I used to be. [221]
Getting jealous of past selves is not listed in the clinical literature, yet it is the method that keeps me awake at night. [244]
I reread old scrolls and envy the version of me who once believed time moved like a river instead of a pack of stray dogs. [269]
He was frightened, sure, but his fear had edges; mine is a fog with teeth. [284]
Tonight the wind drops, and the silence has that thick backstage quality, as if the world is waiting for someone to miss their cue. [308]
That is when the grave memory comes back in full color, smelling of wet granite and cheap carnations. [326]
I had stood on a ridge above the ranger station, looking down at the small fenced plot where they bury lost hikers, and seen my own name on a crooked white cross. [358]
Three dates, none of them matching the year on my pay stub. [370]
I remember thinking it was a clerical error, the universe misprinting my expiration date, and laughing until something stepped out from behind the cross. [394]
It wore my body like an outgrown uniform, sleeves too short, eyes too calm. [408]
The double looked at me with an expression of feral nostalgia, as if I were a childhood home condemned for luxury condos. [430]
That was when I understood that my future selves were stalking my memories, hungry for the versions of me that still believed in sequence. [454]
I ran, naturally, tripped on a root, and woke up in the infirmary with a concussion and a new stack of bark on my chest. [479]
Since then, every scroll has begun with the same line: You fell, but not the way you think. [497]
Tonight's scroll is still blank, the birch skin curved like a question mark on the table beside the kerosene lamp. [517]
The cabin walls creak as if someone large is shifting their weight just outside, rearranging history to see if it falls better. [539]
I pull on my boots, because the only way to stop the timelines from breeding is to walk straight into them. [560]
Outside, the air is so thin it feels like an accusation. [571]
The stars are close enough to touch, and when I stretch my hand up in the practiced way, I feel the old lucid dreaming trick kick in. [598]
Gravity loosens its fingers, and I begin to soar above the cabin, the pines shrinking into a dark comb on the mountain's scalp. [621]
From up here the cemetery is a scatter of pale teeth, and my crosses are glowing softly, like indicators on a malfunctioning dashboard. [644]
Each grave shows a different age, a different cause: exposure, avalanche, heart failure in sleep, none of which I remember and all of which feel true. [670]
The jealousy comes then, a hot twist under my ribs, aimed not at the deaths but at the cleaner stories those versions of me must have had. [697]
They probably believed every choice led somewhere, that suffering built character instead of drafts. [711]
I am here alone in a thin-aired present, tasked to distill chaos into narrative, to stitch all their unfinished sentences into something like a plot. [736]
Hovering between graves and roofline, I realize jaded wonder is the only honest tone left to me, the weary awe of a narrator who has spoiled every ending and still cannot look away. [769]</story>
