<story>The first time I woke in the abandoned spaceport repair bay, I thought my own mind had misfiled reality. [19]
Flaking hazard stripes peeled from the walls like old skin, and the air hummed with a faint ozone tang that suggested engines long shut down but never quite at rest. [49]
It was always the same moment, suspended in the murmur of half-remembered dreams, as if waking itself were just another echo among many. [72]
I am called Lio, a sensory map maker, hired to chart places that exist only at the edge of perception. [92]
My craft is cyclically spontaneous, coming in surges that follow no calendar, each burst of clarity separated by seasons of dull, ordinary sight. [115]
In those active seasons I see currents of sound, heat, memory, and probability, and I weave between worlds the way other people weave between crowded market stalls. [142]
That talent is why the Archivist summoned me to the dead edge of the system, offering no details beyond a coordinate string and a promise that here, at last, lay the withheld truth of my life. [178]
The withheld truth had mass in my imagination, like a dense star bending every decision I had ever made, and I had come to measure its weight at last. [207]
What I found instead, on the cracked deck of the repair bay, was a single green glass shard catching light that should not have existed. [232]
It glowed without source, its edges sharp enough to draw thin threads of color from the air, as though slicing the spectrum itself. [255]
I reached toward it, and my mapping senses flared open like an emergency hatch, flooding the bay with overlapping diagrams of smell, temperature, and remembered footsteps. [281]
Each trace diverged, then rejoined, as if the room were hosting rehearsals of itself from parallel universes, all slightly misaligned yet determined to share the same stage. [308]
The green shard was the knot in that weave between worlds, the place where every version of this bay had chosen to disagree. [331]
I knew then that the shard was not debris but a tool, perhaps a broken instrument meant to redirect the flows of experience themselves. [355]
The Archivist appeared behind me without footfall, her figure resolving from the haze of overlapping realities as if she had stepped sideways through their disagreements. [380]
You always arrive here, she said, voice flat, as if reciting a result she had graphed a hundred times already. [400]
Cyclic patterns tugged at the edges of my awareness, memories of visits I could not recall yet felt in the ache of muscles that had braced for the same surprise before. [431]
How many times have I come? I asked, still watching the shard as it pulsed in time with some rhythm my ears could not hear. [456]
As many as it takes for you to stop mapping for others and start mapping yourself, she replied, and there was a tiredness in her that suggested she had delivered this line before. [489]
The withheld truth, I realized, was not some external record or confession but the pattern of my own repetition, the way I had allowed employers, clients, and distant authorities to chart the course of my talent. [525]
All my life I had moved through parallel universes of obligation, tracing other peoples blind spots while leaving my own unmapped. [546]
Show me, I said, and the Archivist nodded toward the shard, giving consent rather than instruction, as if the decision had always been mine. [570]
When my fingers closed around the green glass, the repair bay fell away, and I was flung through a corridor of selves, each another possible Lio who had turned aside from this moment. [603]
One version had refused the Archivists summons and grown old mapping tourist districts on humid moons, another had joined a research fleet and vanished with a data ship, another had gone blind rather than face the overload of perception. [642]
Each path carried a different weight, pressing against me like atmospheres stacked on atmospheres, and in the press I finally understood that withheld truth is not only what is hidden by others but what we quietly refuse to witness in ourselves. [683]
The corridor narrowed, choices collapsing into a single, present version of me, and I felt the old cycles buck like misaligned gears, demanding that I forget again, that I snap back into the comfort of repetition. [719]
Instead I used the shard to redirect that momentum, cutting loose the binding threads of expectation that tied me to every other Lio who had turned away. [746]
The repair bay reassembled around me, quieter than before, its rust, its silence, its suspended motes of dust arranged in a pattern that, for once, belonged only to this single world. [777]
The Archivist watched, waiting for a question, but I had none; the map unfolding inside me was answer enough. [796]</story>
