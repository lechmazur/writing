<story>The vintage bookshop attic smelled of rain-soaked cardboard and brittle glue, a forgotten lung above the city. [17]
Noel stood there each dawn, balancing on a warped floorboard as if the whole room were a scale. [35]
Around him, their cages rustled, the courier pigeons waking, soft wings churning the dusty air into currents. [52]
He was a courier pigeon trainer, their cartographer, teaching them streets and rooftops the way librarians teach the alphabet. [71]
But lately he trained them for stranger routes, ones that began and ended with himself. [86]
On the old trunk beside him lay the Mars meteorite chip, dark as dried blood, smaller than his thumbnail. [105]
He had bought it with the money from selling his last remaining record player, the one that still worked. [124]
Its weight hardly mattered, yet he felt his balance tilt every time he looked at it. [140]
The dealer had promised it came from a meteorite that once skimmed the Martian atmosphere, humming with silent thunder. [159]
Noel did not care if that was true; he needed something unquestionably older than his mistakes. [175]
His mistakes lived downstairs, in rows of invoices and scribbled receipts, a paper trail that mapped his unspooling life. [194]
After the fire at the music hall, after the court dates and settlement letters, after the tabloids, the shop had become his refuge. [217]
He sold vintage songbooks and sheet music to collectors who wanted to resurrect the past without remembering how it ended. [237]
Yet upstairs, in the attic among the pigeons, he reinvents his personal history entirely. [251]
He named the birds after songs that no longer existed, melodies he swore had once filled the music hall rafters. [271]
Their coos, overlapping, were like chords whose notes had slipped out of human frequency. [285]
He told himself he trained them to carry invoices and catalog slips, but that was not the truth. [303]
He was trying to preserve the echo of lost songs, smuggling fragments of them through the sky on feathered backs. [323]
Each message he tied to a leg contained a bar of melody, drawn as tiny mountains and valleys instead of notes. [344]
He imagined the routes as staves, the city a vast score the pigeons alone could still read. [361]
To plan those routes, he watched the attic dust. [370]
Every morning, when the sun finally pierced the grime-scratched skylight, a single column of light unfurled like a slow trumpet. [390]
He would stand beneath it, devising new routes by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight. [409]
Where the motes drifted he sent the birds, believing the dust knew the hidden winds better than he did. [428]
It was a ridiculous method, yet it felt like the only honest compass he had left. [444]
People came to the attic occasionally, following the wrong staircase or the strange music of wings. [460]
Most he sent away with a polite lie about insurance regulations, but one winter morning a woman refused to leave. [480]
She wore a green coat gone shiny at the cuffs and carried a folder swollen with photocopies. [497]
I am looking for Noel Harrow, she said, the one from the Rialto fire. [511]
The name struck him like a wrong chord hammered until it almost sounded right. [525]
Downstairs, the paper trails knew him by that name, but up here he had been trying to forget it. [544]
What do you want with him, he asked, though his pigeons had already gone suddenly, watchfully still. [561]
She opened the folder and spread photographs on a crate: the music hall before the fire, all velvet and brass. [581]
My sister died there, she said, and there was a song the band never got to finish. [598]
They say you wrote it. [603]
Noel felt every delayed flame of memory lick at him, yet something inside resisted collapsing into ash. [620]
I wrote many songs, he replied, and none of them belong to me anymore. [634]
She pointed to the Mars meteorite chip on the trunk, as if recognizing a relic from a shared hallucination. [653]
You used to say music was falling stones, she murmured, and if we listened together we could predict the impact. [673]
My sister believed you, right up until the ceiling did what ceilings do. [686]
He saw then that she had not come for money or apology, but to see whether faith could survive its ruins. [707]
Trust, he realized, was another word for unfinished song, a melody that keeps expecting the next note despite everything. [726]
Across learning to trust again, she kept returning to help him feed the pigeons and learn their routes. [744]
Together they listened to the cooing loft and the rain on the skylight, hearing in their overlap a withering promise that still bloomed. [767]
One evening, as dusk turned the dust to drifting ink, he finally wrote the song her sister never heard, then tied it to a bird. [792]</story>
