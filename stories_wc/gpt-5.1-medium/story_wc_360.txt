<story>The night the third star vanished, I found the workshop glowing like a buried sun under glass. [17]
They called it the topaz workshop, because every surface held that amber sheen, drinking in what little starlight remained. [36]
At its center stood Mara, the cryptic letterpress operator, hands inked, eyes reflective as unset gems. [52]
She did not look up when the last of the star-dust wind slipped in with me. [68]
We always met between vanishing stars, in that hush where the sky revised itself and no one else seemed to notice. [89]
On the tables lay trays of moveable type carved from cloudy topaz, each letter catching the dark like a question half-asked. [110]
Closest to Mara sat a small metal ring, broken into six segments, each piece limned with a pale fire: the halo fragment. [132]
It hummed like a faint chorus, always just beyond the range of understanding, the way grief hums beneath an ordinary day. [153]
Mara had the unnerving habit of borrowing personalities like jackets; tonight she wore my late brother's slouch, my mother's careful sarcasm, and the precise hesitation of the teacher who once failed me. [185]
Watching her was like seeing a crowd move behind a single set of eyes. [199]
You came back, she said without greeting, as though plucking the thought from some passing stranger; then, softer, You still want to learn the mathematics of emotion. [226]
I nodded, because language felt fragile under that kind of attention. [237]
Outside, the second star thinned to a smear, leaving us balanced on the edge of measurable night. [254]
Mara claimed that when stars died, their light did not simply vanish; it transposed empathy across distances, folding feelings into new constellations of cause and effect. [280]
To read those constellations, she said, you needed a press that printed not words but states of mind. [298]
The halo fragment focused the residue of dying starlight into the topaz type, and the type, when pressed, attempted to solve for the equation of a feeling. [325]
At least, that was her explanation the first time, given in a tone of almost scientific calm. [342]
Later I realized she was trying to disorient me through deliberate ambiguity, scattering half-truths until my own certainties cracked and let other possibilities leak in. [367]
Ambiguity, she insisted, was the only solvent strong enough to loosen the rigid arithmetic I kept applying to my grief. [387]
Tonight, she gestured me closer to the press, where a fresh sheet of thin, translucent paper waited like a pond refusing to admit it was ice. [413]
Choose a feeling you cannot solve, she said. [421]
I almost answered love, but the word felt like a drawer everyone rummaged through; instead I said, The moment before you decide to leave someone, when every future you will not live tries to breathe at once. [458]
Mara smiled with my mother's mouth, sorrow folded at the corners, and began setting the topaz type, each letter a facet of that unsolved instant. [483]
The halo fragment brightened, casting a ring of pale equations across the ceiling, symbols I half-recognized from school and half from nightmares. [505]
Press the lever, she told me, and do not decide what you hope will appear. [520]
The mechanism sighed as I pulled, topaz letters kissing paper with a soft, devastating finality. [535]
When we lifted the sheet, no text waited, only a dense geometry of lines and curves, some looping back like regrets, others shooting off the page as if refusing containment. [565]
My chest tightened, because the pattern felt like something I had already survived but could not name. [582]
Put your hand on the halo, Mara said, voice now stolen from the first person who ever lied to me, which made defiance taste familiar. [607]
The metal was neither warm nor cold; it felt like pressure made solid, like the moment just before tears break. [627]
The workshop, the remaining star, even Mara's shifting posture fell away, and I was standing inside the printed geometry, every line a possible decision. [651]
Transposed empathy, in practice, did not feel like understanding someone else; it felt like everyone else quietly rearranging chairs inside your skull. [673]
I could taste the iron in the throat of a stranger deciding to stay, feel the pinch in the heel of Mara choosing, years from now, not to answer a desperate knock, and sense my brother's vanished paths bending away from the crash he never walked from. [720]
Each borrowed perspective flickered through me, not as vision or voice but as rearranged variables in the equation that had once defined me as the one left behind. [748]
When the geometry dissolved and the workshop swam back into place, I staggered, disoriented not by spectacle but by the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief. [775]
So that is the mathematics of emotion, I said, voice hoarse, its variables stolen and returned in unfamiliar order. [794]</story>
