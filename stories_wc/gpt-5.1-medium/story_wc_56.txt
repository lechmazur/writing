<story>The first rumor reached me on a night when the canal forgot how to echo. [15]
Twilight sat low over the barge canal, a bruise of violet behind the warehouses. [29]
I walked the towpath like an errant legend seeker who had misplaced the legend. [43]
Every step was guided by a quiet hunger to understand the architecture of lies. [57]
In my pocket, the antique pocket sundial ticked against my thigh like a second heartbeat. [72]
It was useless in the dark, but I carried it to remind myself that time could be read differently, by training instincts instead of trusting clocks. [98]
Ever since the towers fell and the broadcasts stopped, we measured hours by the silence of morning radio. [116]
The city had entered a phase of serene upheaval, where everything looked the same yet nothing aligned. [133]
Cargo still moved along the water, but the barges carried rumors instead of grain. [147]
Tonight I was following one such rumor, about a wreck nobody wanted officially salvaged. [161]
They said a government barge had scraped the lock and gone under, its cargo too sensitive to salvage by daylight. [181]
They also said the barge had been carrying the blueprints for how our history was rewritten. [197]
That last rumor was why I came alone. [205]
The canal narrowed near Lock Eleven, and the air there always smelled of wet iron and lost decisions. [223]
I saw the barge hull first, a shadow overturned, its rust catching the final smear of light. [240]
Two men waited on the opposite bank, shapes as still as the piling posts behind them. [256]
They had the thoughtful stillness of people who could kill without raising their voices. [270]
When I hailed them, my own voice came out thoughtfully clear, like someone else's confession. [285]
You the diver, one called, though there was no question mark in his tone. [299]
I nodded, showed them the coiled rope and the harness, but kept the sundial hidden. [314]
Payment after, the other man said, tipping his chin at the black ripple where the barge slept. [331]
He did not ask why nobody had hired a company instead. [342]
We all pretended there were still companies. [349]
I strapped on the harness, the leather stiff against my shoulders, and felt a tremor of cowardly honesty. [367]
If I found nothing, I could keep lying to myself about the shape of things. [382]
If I found what I hoped for, every comfortable story would come apart. [395]
The first plunge stole my breath, the water colder than truth and twice as heavy. [410]
Sound folded over me, and the world reduced to bubbles, shadows, and the pull of the rope. [427]
I found the hull by touch, palms sliding along barnacled metal as if reading braille. [442]
A jagged tear opened in the side, big enough for a single honest body. [456]
Inside, the dark thickened, but my fingers learned the interior contour by training instincts to replace sight. [473]
Crates lay spilled like teeth from a broken jaw, their lids warped, their seals half dissolved. [489]
I pried one open and felt paper slick with algae, the pages swollen yet stubbornly legible. [505]
Blueprints, yes, but not of buildings; they mapped how headlines had been altered, how footage had been spliced, how names had been moved from hero to traitor and back again. [535]
In that submerged chamber I felt hindsight clarity strike, not as comfort but as a scalpel. [551]
Every inconsistency I had forgiven rearranged itself into a deliberate pattern, a geometry of deceit. [566]
I understood then that I was not here to salvage documents; I was here to salvage my own capacity for disbelief. [587]
The rope tugged twice, the signal to surface, but some deeper signal told me to stay one breath longer. [606]
I stuffed as many pages as I could inside the waterproof satchel and kicked for the hole. [623]
When I broke the surface, the sky had gone from violet to ink, and the two men were silhouettes against a single low lantern. [647]
Got something, the nearer one said, stepping closer than the waterline allowed. [659]
Enough, I answered, my voice still thoughtfully clear, which made his eyes narrow. [672]
He gestured for the satchel, but I only lifted the dripping sundial from my pocket. [687]
Its tiny gnomon quivered, catching more lantern light than night, as if insisting that direction still mattered. [704]
You hired the wrong kind of diver, I told them, calm as the current sliding past. [720]
I do not bring things up just to hand them over. [731]
I bring them up so they can no longer pretend to be hidden. [744]
Around us, the twilight barge canal swallowed our reflections, and even in that fragile quiet I felt the world tilt, not into chaos, but into a new and dangerous honesty. [774]</story>
