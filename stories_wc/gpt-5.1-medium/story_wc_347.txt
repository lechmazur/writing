<story>The orchard clung to the cliff like a bad decision that refused to fall. [14]
Its twisted trees leaned over the drop, roots knotted into stone, branches baited with bruised silver fruit. [31]
I never wanted to tend them, but the orchard had chosen me the night I survived the fall. [49]
Now I walked its crooked rows, listening to the sea grind the cliff below, waiting for travelers. [66]
They always came eventually, drawn by rumors of a shortcut through the cliffside labyrinth to the western road. [84]
They never knew about the curse, or the birds, or how easily the path swallowed the careless. [101]
Above the orchard, iron wings clicked and folded as the mechanical birds patrolled their tight circles. [117]
They were older than me, older than the road, older maybe than the cliff itself. [132]
Rust freckled their brass feathers, but their glass eyes stayed offhandedly exact, missing nothing that moved. [148]
People thought they were guardians; they were really counters, tallying every soul who entered the maze. [164]
My job was not to stop travelers but to guide lost ones back out, before the night frost formed. [183]
Frost here did not simply bite; it remembered, and it kept whatever it remembered. [197]
The old caretaker had told me that, coughing blood onto the roots, pressing a small nut into my palm. [216]
It was no bigger than my thumbnail, dull brown, carved with lines too fine for my tired eyes. [234]
`You assemble the paths with this,' he had rasped, `or they assemble themselves around you.' [249]
I thought he was delirious until the first time a traveler stumbled into my trees, bleeding hope. [266]
She was young, city bred, boots too clean, map ink still wet where the rain had blurred it. [284]
I felt the orchard stir around her, hungry as low tide, and the birds tightened their spirals overhead. [302]
She asked for the fastest way through the cliffside labyrinth, voice already cracking from the salt air. [319]
I should have sent her away; instead I closed my fingers around the nut and listened. [335]
When I held it, space shifted, soft as breath, and the orchard grew crowded with faint doubling. [352]
Ghost paths forked and rejoined, none of them quite real, leaving impressions without touching a single leaf or stone. [371]
They wrapped around the girl like possibilities, each one leading somewhere different, most of them worse than death. [389]
In that haze of maybe, I saw a thin white thread of safety running toward the western road. [407]
It was flimsy, steep, skirting the maze instead of entering it, hugging terraces cut long ago. [423]
I pointed without thinking, and the ghost paths trembled, then slid into place, assembling a narrow trail beneath her boots. [443]
The birds dipped lower, clockwork necks twisting, counting her, approving or condemning; I could not tell which. [460]
She walked, wavering, but the path held, a line of graceless beauty scraped along the cliff. [476]
When she vanished around the shoulder of rock, the nut cooled in my hand, and the ghost paths faded. [495]
That night, frost filmed the orchard, tracing every footprint she had not taken, each one its own dead maze. [514]
I saw then what the old caretaker had meant; the orchard was a blueprint that kept rewriting itself. [532]
Not on paper, but in possibility, a forgotten blueprint laid over the cliff, the labyrinth, even the sky. [550]
Every step someone might take, every path the frost would remember, was already there, waiting to be chosen. [568]
My curse was not the orchard itself but the obligation to read that invisible plan and defy it. [586]
Years passed, and I guided more travelers, each one another argument against the blueprint, another smudge on the frost. [605]
Sometimes the nut showed no safe path, only gradations of ruin, and still I had to choose. [622]
I grew precise in my failures, offhandedly exact in explaining risks, but my voice always shook anyway. [639]
The mechanical birds learned my patterns, circling closer when strangers neared, driving them toward my orchard instead of away. [658]
I realized then that they were not counters only but messengers, assembling their own routes through the air. [676]
They traced invisible corridors between cliffs and clouds, leaving impressions without touching, sketching updates onto the vast blueprint I defied. [696]
One autumn, when the wind smelled of iron and rot, a traveler arrived who carried no map. [713]
He moved like someone used to falling and getting up again, shoulders scarred, gaze steady as tidal rock. [731]
`I am looking for the blueprint,' he said, as if asking for bread, as if nothing else mattered. [749]
The nut in my pocket burned like a coal, and every tree shifted, shedding leaves in sudden stillness. [767]
I understood then that the blueprint wanted to be remembered, and that guiding him might finally free the orchard from me. [788]</story>
