<story>The sky mechanic arrived at the xenobiology research station just before the second sunset. [14]
Above the ice-sheathed cliffs, the twin moons smeared thin halos across a metallic dusk. [28]
From the landing gantry he could see the aviaries, dark domes where the planet's native fliers slept. [45]
The entire valley rested within the hush of beating wings at rest, a stillness deeper than snow. [62]
Cold seeped through the railing into his gloves, but inside he felt an odd, icy warmth. [78]
They called him Ilen, the obliging sky mechanic, because he never refused a broken thing. [93]
Tonight the station director had not summoned him for repairs, at least not of metal. [108]
Dr. Rae waited by the central spire, her breath clouding the corridor lights like cautious ghosts. [124]
"You are late," she said, the rebuke softened by fatigue more than kindness. [137]
"The shuttle was delayed by crosswinds," Ilen answered, his voice mechanically warm, practiced comfort over lingering ache. [154]
He had left a small family on the orbital habitat, their messages now months out of sync. [171]
Perhaps that was why the director's encrypted request intrigued him: she wanted to prove that time moves sideways. [189]
He followed Rae through the pressure doors into the heart of the xenobiology research station. [204]
Here the air smelled faintly of ozone, preservative mist, and the iron tang of thawing samples. [220]
Glass columns rose in clusters, each containing a suspended embryonic creature folded around an obsidian shell. [236]
Rae gestured toward them with a gloved hand, as if the subdued awakenings inside might startle. [252]
"They are dreaming in intervals," she said. [259]
Each consciousness flickers on a different axis of duration, but we cannot map the pattern alone. [275]
"You think time is bending around them?" Ilen asked. [284]
Rae shook her head and led him to the observation deck, where twilight bled through hexagonal windows onto a magnetic nexus of instruments. [307]
Coils of superconductor gleamed like coiled frost, converging on a hovering prism caged in pale laser light. [324]
In its depths, colors chased themselves backward, a slow whirlpool that never quite completed a circle. [340]
"This is the temporal manifold," Rae said. [347]
We built it through holographic principles, encoding spatial interference patterns into layered timeslices of the local field. [364]
The creatures respond to it, slightly ahead or behind our measurements, as though listening to sideways echoes. [381]
But the manifold is unstable, and we need someone who understands machines that hang between gravities. [397]
"Sky mechanic sounds more romantic than it is," Ilen said, though he could not deny the pull. [414]
"What do you want from me?" [420]
"To tune the nexus until the dreams align," Rae replied. [430]
If your adjustments work, we will see whether time truly flows sideways, latticed across their sleeping minds. [447]
"And if it does not?" Ilen said. [454]
Then the manifold fractures, the awakenings become violent, and we lose both them and this valley's future. [471]
He stepped closer to the control console, its surface curved like frozen water, lit by faint amber veins. [489]
The main lever rose from the center, a slender arc of metal wrapped in insulating polymers polished by anxious hands. [509]
He wrapped his gloved palm around it, feeling almost nothing, yet sensing the station's heartbeat waiting. [525]
Outside, unseen beyond the frosted windows, thousands of wings shivered in their sleep, never quite lifting. [541]
He thought of his children sending him delayed jokes, their laughter already past when he received it. [558]
Perhaps, he mused, they existed in a sideways corridor of time as well, fingers brushing his in absentia. [576]
"Show me the calibration grid," he said. [583]
Rae activated a projection, and the console blossomed into a lattice of hovering lines and drifting runes. [600]
Through holographic principles the grid overlaid both the room and the embryos, each point echoing across half-seen duplicates. [618]
Where lines intersected, the prism flared, and the sleeping creatures twitched like leaves in soft, underwater wind. [635]
Ilen nudged the lever a fraction, watching how one embryo's neural spark drifted not forward but sideways along the grid. [655]
The prism steadied, and a faint harmonic rose, higher than hearing yet felt along his bones. [671]
In that tremor he sensed their thoughts uncoiling, subdued awakenings adjusting themselves to a new direction of before and after. [691]
Rae watched the monitors, her usual severity thinned by awe, like ice beginning to run with meltwater. [708]
"They are stabilizing," she whispered. [713]
"You have given them a sideways present, a place to rest between the future and the past." [730]
He did not feel heroic, only obliging, as though he had simply tightened a bolt that held the sky together. [750]
Yet as the valley lay within the hush of beating wings at rest, and the prism hummed with icy warmth, Ilen allowed himself to believe that time, at least here, now moved sideways because he had asked it to. [789]</story>
