<story>After the shadow detaches from the body, the lantern maker begins her work. [13]
On the floating island tea garden, she waits until twilight stains the clouds indigo. [27]
Only then does the sky feel hollow enough to carry other peoples dreams. [40]
Her name is Liora, and she is the craftiest lantern maker above the sea. [54]
By day she pours tea for visitors who come to float, forget, and briefly forgive themselves. [70]
By night she coaxes their unspoken regrets into glass and flame. [81]
Beyond the garden, tethered to the same drifting rock, rises a glass basilica on a floating isle. [98]
Its spires catch moons the sea has forgotten, storing them as prisms in its ribs. [113]
Every window there once belonged to a lantern Liora built for someone who could not sleep. [129]
Tonight, though, the basilica waits for her, not for a stranger. [140]
It is the first evening after the shadow detaches from her own feet. [153]
She watches it standing at the cliff edge, looking thinner than last year. [166]
Her shadow hesitates, then steps off into the open air, falling upward toward the basilica. [181]
Like everything here, it descends while ascending, darker the higher it climbs. [193]
Only when it dissolves into the crystal buttresses does Liora allow herself to breathe. [207]
The ritual is simple, the torment less so. [215]
She sets out three cups on the moss-soft table, though only one will be used. [230]
The second is for the daughter she lost, the third for the future she abandoned. [245]
Steam rises, twisting like uncut paper from the kettle spout. [255]
Liora unrolls a packet of silvered rice paper, its edges already creased into invisible lines. [270]
These are not yet cranes, only the possibility of them, thinned by years of hesitation. [285]
She tells herself she folds grief to keep it from rotting, to turn ache into architecture. [301]
But the paper stays flat until the dreams arrive. [310]
Dream recording is illegal in the kingdoms below, yet here it purchases silence and altitude. [325]
People climb the rope gondolas with pockets full of unspoken terrors, leaving lighter, shorter, dimmer. [340]
Liora captures their nightmares in molten glass, seals them with wire, and hangs them among the tea shrubs. [358]
When the lanterns sway, the dreams replay in miniature, looping above the steam-scented leaves. [372]
Visitors sip and watch their pain turn to theater, luminous yet safely distant. [385]
Tonight, there are no visitors, only Liora and the one dream she has refused to distill. [401]
It waits in the stone locket pressed against her throat, heavy as unshed rain. [415]
She opens it, and the air sharpens like a blade polished on thunder. [428]
The memory spills out soundlessly, a pale child running along a pier, hair silver with salt. [444]
Waves rise, lanterns shatter, a scream is swallowed before it ever reaches the air. [458]
This is the moment she has refused to polish, the gem she has kept deliberately dull. [474]
Yet the basilica hums above her, a throat clearing before confession, and she knows delay is another cruelty. [492]
She carries the memory like an uncut stone to her workbench beside the tea bushes. [507]
Her tools are humble: cloth, oil, a copper wheel whispering with impatient rotation. [520]
Gem polishing, the old masters called it, though the stones here are memories, not minerals. [535]
She presses the memory against the wheel, and sparks of seawater leap from its surface. [550]
The scene clarifies, cleansing itself of haze, until every droplet becomes a tiny window of light. [566]
Her heart feels flayed, luminous torment pouring through each newly sharpened facet. [578]
When she can bear no more, she lifts the cut memory and drops it into waiting glass. [595]
The molten sphere swallows it, shuddering, then hangs from her tongs like a second, burning moon. [611]
She walks to the basilica, lantern in hand, climbing the spiral bridge of transparent stone. [626]
With every step upward, the world falls away below, and she descends through layers of herself. [642]
At the basilica door she pauses, then breathes onto the cooling globe, commanding it to transform. [658]
The glass opens like a flower, petals unfolding into sheets of glowing rice paper. [672]
Her hands move without instruction, taught by loss; she folds the first crane from her daughters final breath. [690]
Then another, and another, until the basilica rafters are crowded with fragile, radiant birds. [704]
Each crane carries a sliver of grief, sharpened but bearable, ready to migrate wherever forgetting is required. [721]
Below, the kingdoms sleep unknowingly beneath a sky of folded sorrow, glowing softly, transformed at last. [737]</story>
