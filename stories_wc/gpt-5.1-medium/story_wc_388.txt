<story>After the liquidation, the orchard was the only thing still growing in the dead zone. [15]
Gnarled trees sagged with gray, irradiated fruit, their roots drinking from poisoned aquifers while radioactive dust storms scratched the sky. [35]
Theo Brant walked the rows in a respirator mask, notebook in hand, eyes sharply observant behind fogged lenses. [53]
He had become famous as a conspiracy debunker, the man who broke viral myths for a living. [70]
Now his only employer was the Reconstruction Committee, and they had sent him to this wasteland orchard to prove something. [90]
Officially, Theo was here to verify that the fruit tested clean, that the soil's residual glow posed no threat. [109]
Unofficially, he was here to excavate truth from comfortable lies, the way he always had. [124]
The liquidation of the old Directorate had ended with fireworks and sealed records, and Theo did not trust seals. [143]
Rumor said the Directorate's last minister had buried a flawed diamond somewhere in the orchard, a stone cursed with knowledge. [163]
Find the diamond, the rumor continued, and you would understand why this orchard thrived when every other farm died. [182]
Theo did not believe in curses; he believed in leverage, in blackmail, in data made to look like paradise or doom. [203]
If a diamond mattered, it mattered because it held a record, perhaps engraved, perhaps encoded in its internal fractures. [222]
The Committee brief had mentioned a phrase from confiscated sermons, something about a hidden stillpoint at the heart of catastrophe. [242]
Theo suspected that stillpoint was not mystical at all, but a protocol, a failsafe, a quiet place in the code. [262]
His first clue came from the packing shed, where boxes of old fertilizer invoices concealed bags of meticulously shredded letters. [282]
They were written on Directorate stationery and dappled with brown stains that looked too old to be blood. [300]
Theo spread the strips across a sorting table, the fruit dust glowing faintly under his ultraviolet lamp. [317]
He began reassembling shredded letters into jagged paragraphs, his fingers moving with a patience that felt almost devotional. [335]
Line by line, patterns emerged, and Theo started to intuit the shape of a conversation that should have been erased. [355]
The letters were from the minister to an unnamed partner, discussing a pilot project seeded in hostile soil, watered with waste from the reactors. [379]
The orchard was no miracle, no divine reprieve from the fallout, but a calculated experiment in engineered resilience. [397]
Farther down, a torn fragment referenced the diamond explicitly, calling it the 'crystalline stillpoint' to which all contingency keys had been bonded. [419]
Theo felt the air in the shed tighten, heavy as the dust storms that sometimes roared beyond the treeline. [438]
If the diamond was a stillpoint, then whoever held it could unlock whatever the Directorate had built into this land. [458]
That meant the Committee wanted more than safety assurances; they wanted custody of the key, and perhaps plausible deniability about how it functioned. [481]
Theo pocketed the reconstructed pages and walked back into the orchard, counting rows until he reached the oldest, sickliest trees. [501]
Here the bark flaked like ash, and the fruit hung small and dark, each one bearing faint geometric scars. [520]
He crouched, brushing aside grit until his glove touched metal, a loop of chain fused to the base of a trunk. [541]
Someone had once padlocked something there, and the chain pointed inward, into the roots, as if the tree were guarding a treasure. [563]
Theo dug until his shoulders burned, the radioactive dust swirling around him in slow, luminous veils. [579]
His spade finally struck something that rang like glass but felt like ice, and he lifted the flawed diamond into the murky light. [602]
It was no jeweler's prize; a cloudy vein cut through its center, scattering rainbows into a crushed, fractured halo. [621]
For a heartbeat, the orchard's wind seemed to still, as if the entire wasteland were pausing, listening. [638]
Theo told himself that was nonsense, yet the hairs along his neck rose, registering a pattern his rational mind had not yet parsed. [661]
He thumbed the diamond, feeling microscopic ridges under the grime, and recognized them as the same geometric scars on the fruit. [682]
The stillpoint was not only a key but an imprint, a template through which every engineered seed in the orchard had been aligned. [705]
If the Committee gained it, they could propagate this resilience anywhere, or withdraw it, starving regions that refused their governance. [725]
If he destroyed it, the orchard would likely wither, and the scattered survivors depending on its fruit would slowy choke on dust. [747]
Theo had spent years dismantling fantasies, telling people that no hidden cabal guided the world, only greed, neglect, and random disaster. [768]
Now, standing in the radioactive hush with the cursed diamond in his hand, he finally met something like a secret government, and chose not to deliver it back. [796]</story>
