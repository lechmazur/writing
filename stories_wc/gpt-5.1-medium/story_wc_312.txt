<story>The sapphire viaduct at dawn did not look like a place where the universe could crack. [16]
Its arches glowed with a sleepy blue, and the sea beneath yawned in slow tides after the last fish is caught. [37]
Tamsin, lukewarm mage of the Tidal Collegium, shuffled across the stones in boots that had never fully dried. [55]
Steam rose from her cuffs, not from power, but from last nights rain. [68]
She was, by all reasonable measures, a disappointing sorcerer. [77]
Her fire warmed tea yet left kettles lukewarm, her winds fluffed sails without filling them, and her illusions faded at the edges like shy clouds. [102]
Still, she had come to the viaduct to right a cosmic imbalance. [114]
This was precisely the kind of phrase that kept getting her reprimanded by her instructors. [129]
Tamsin was earnestly naive, yes, but her naivete had teeth. [139]
It bit down on the world and refused to let go until meaning leaked out. [154]
Today that meaning hinged on a broken ship's bell cradled in her arms like a sleeping child. [171]
The bell had washed ashore two nights ago, tangled in eelgrass, still throbbing faintly with some drowned command. [189]
When Tamsin touched it, she had heard not sound but absence, as if every lost toll from every lost harbor had rushed together into one silent gasp. [216]
That hush had felt like a miscount in the universe. [226]
Something, somewhere, was no longer being properly announced. [234]
She had taken it as a sign, which was the sort of error a more talented mage would never make. [254]
Yet error or not, the pulled thread of that silent gasp had snagged on the brittle devotion she carried around her heart. [276]
Her faith in cosmic fairness had been baked thin and hard by small humiliations, by tepid spells, by teachers sighs, and once cracked it might never hold again. [304]
So she had promised the bell that she would fix whatever it had failed to finish. [320]
Now the viaduct rose before her, each arch a rib of stone holding up the pale underbelly of the sky. [340]
Folktales claimed this bridge listened to tides the way sages listened to stars, and that somewhere in its foundations the worlds balance was counted drop by drop. [367]
She had laughed at that story as a child. [376]
Today she hoped the story had not laughed back. [385]
At the center of the viaduct, a low plinth waited, slick with night mist. [399]
An iron bracket atop it jutted like an empty throat. [409]
The original bell had shattered in a storm a century ago, or so the legend went, and no one had been foolish or brave enough to replace it. [437]
Tamsin set the broken ship's bell beside the bracket and studied the crusted green metal. [452]
A jagged bite marked where its tongue had once hung. [462]
She could not weld it, could not conjure missing bronze from air, could not, in any practical sense, rebuild it. [482]
What she had was time, and a peculiar gift that every examiner had politely called useless. [498]
Tamsin could sense how things dripped. [504]
Not just water from a roof or wax from a candle, but the rate at which any slow falling thing surrendered its height. [527]
Her first mentor had tested this by holding up a bucket of sand and asking her, eyes closed, to predict when the last grain would fall. [553]
She had been correct to the heartbeat, and then sent to the archives, where nothing was expected ever to fall at all. [575]
Now she knelt by the edge of the viaduct, held the broken ship's bell in both hands, and leaned it toward the drop until the sea filled its hollow. [604]
Cold water licked her fingers, then began to overflow, spilling back in tiny threads. [618]
She closed her eyes and listened to the dripping rate, every bead a number, every number a plea. [636]
The bell wanted to ring, to finish a note that the storm had bitten through. [651]
Each drop fell at a slightly different pace, delayed or hastened by dents in the metal, by barnacles, by the faint otherness clinging to it like rusted prayer. [679]
Understanding dripping rates, her mentors had said, would never change the world. [691]
Yet here the world was, balanced on a series of falling drops, waiting for her to count them right. [710]
She spoke quietly to the bell as the sky brightened in shy peach behind the arches. [726]
I cannot make you whole, she said, but I can help you finish. [739]
All I ask in return is that whatever you were meant to tell the sea, you also tell me. [758]
The drops slowed, aligning themselves, and for a breath she felt the weight of the oceans tilt toward her. [777]
In that moment she saw how storms had leaned wrong, how tides had arrived a heartbeat late for years. [796]
She let it ring. [800]</story>
