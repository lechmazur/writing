<story>I woke in the frozen garden in mist, certain I had fallen asleep inside the library, not outside. [18]
Mist glazed every branch with hoarfrost, yet the air tasted of paper dust and ink, not winter. [35]
I knew then that the shelves had followed me, rearranging the world again, obeying the feral library guardian. [53]
She watched from the far end of the path, crouched on a marble bench, all thorns and bare feet and distrust. [74]
Around her throat hung a cultist's pendant, a dull glass triangle that trapped a wandering ember of light. [92]
The ember flickered as if breathing through the veil of sleep, never bright, never dark, pacing the boundaries of light. [112]
I asked her name, but names are doors, and she was contracted to guard all thresholds, even her own. [131]
Instead she sniffed the air, like a cat wondering if this particular human might pet or poison. [148]
You crossed without knocking, she rasped, voice brittle as frostbitten paper, so why should I let you back. [166]
Back where, I asked, though my teeth already ached with the answer. [178]
Home, she said, and the word shuddered sideways, skipping past directions, pointing toward a dimension I remembered only as pressure. [198]
I had been dimensionally homesick for as long as I could think, craving a place my maps refused to print. [218]
The library knew, of course; its corridors bent toward that lost axis, and the guardian stalked those bends like a weather. [239]
Come sit, she said, or go wander until the mist closes and you discover how long a person can wait. [259]
Waiting sounded like every day of my life, so I walked to her bench, each step ticking like a reluctant clock. [280]
The marble bit through my clothes, but the cold felt clean, as though the garden were an erased chalkboard. [299]
Around us the paths curled into unreadable spirals, and I practiced interiorizing exteriors, letting the garden sink inward until it felt like thought. [322]
Bushes became clauses, statues turned to punctuation, the frozen fountain a question mark paused midfall. [337]
This was how the library moved, she said, foggy lucidity threading her words, making confusion feel almost friendly. [355]
It rearranges what is outside until inside has room for new shelves. [367]
And me, I asked, am I just another misplaced book. [377]
Her eyes flashed like the pendant's ember, catching for a moment on some catalog only she could read. [395]
You are a margin note, she answered, written by someone who mistrusted certainty and hoped the page might argue back. [415]
I came here to make friends with uncertainty, I said, surprising myself with how right the words felt in my mouth. [436]
Stability had only ever offered me locked rooms and fluorescent headaches; doubt, at least, left the door ajar. [454]
The guardian studied me for a long, twitching moment, then loosened the cultist's pendant so it dangled between us. [473]
The glass triangle showed not our reflections but a corridor hung with lanterns, their flames pressed against invisible walls. [492]
Those are the boundaries of light, she whispered, where brightness discovers it is also a kind of cage. [510]
Step past, and you lose your shadow; stay behind, and you never learn what glows without you. [527]
I reached toward the pendant, feeling heat lick my knuckles, not burning but rewriting the distance between skin and flame. [547]
The garden shook, or I did, and for a breath I saw another version of myself pacing an aisle of impossible books. [569]
He looked exhausted, cataloging exits that refused to lead outdoors, dimensionally homesick inside a place built exactly for that ache. [589]
Our eyes met across the echo, and I realized I had been waiting for proof that my longing was legible. [609]
The guardian snapped the pendant shut, and the corridor vanished, leaving only the sound of lanterns remembering they were glass. [629]
So, she said, will you walk blind into that corridor, or sit here forever naming the shapes of fog. [648]
The choice sounded false, like a trick question in a test on paradox, and I laughed, frost catching in my throat. [669]
Why not both, I said; I will walk, but I will also sit, because uncertainty arrives in different costumes. [688]
I will wait while moving, and move while waiting, a friendship rather than a surrender. [703]
She considered this, then nodded once, the sharp approval of a creature who bites before trusting, but sometimes chooses otherwise. [723]
Her fingers unclasped the chain, and the pendant slid into my palm, warm as a held question. [740]
Keep it, she said; learn to walk where light forgets its edges, and remember to write in the margins. [759]
When I finally closed my eyes, the garden hardened around me, and the library unfolded ahead, waiting, uncertain, almost kind. [779]</story>
