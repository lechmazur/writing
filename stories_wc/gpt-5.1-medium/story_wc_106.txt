<story>By the time the city remembered the word sunset, I had already stolen three faces from its light. [18]
They call me the golden-hour portrait thief, but I only ever meant to borrow people from their shadows. [36]
That evening the sky burned copper and rose, a fleeting golden sunset smeared like disbelief across the glassy river. [55]
I walked toward Emerald Station by moonlight already pooling in alley corners, chasing the last slant of radiance. [73]
On my back hung the camera, old and brass, its lens polished like a tiny, patient moon. [90]
In my left hand I carried a jar of captured moonbeams, their pale threads quivering whenever I exhaled. [108]
I stole faces because photographs were the only illuminated moments I trusted not to flicker out of existence. [126]
Each shutter click felt like pressing my ear against destiny's door, listening for the hinge that might finally open. [145]
I was quietly savvy about where to stand, how to angle someone so the light confessed what they were hiding. [165]
Emerald Station rose ahead, its tiled archways green as bottled oceans, its clock already shrugging into twilight. [182]
Soon the sun would slip, and people would remember it only as a rumor at the emerald station by moonlight. [202]
I was not here for trains but for messages, the ones written as codes in flower arrangements along the platforms. [222]
Each bouquet on the iron bench spelled a name, a warning, or a rendezvous no timetable ever mentioned. [240]
Tonight the tulips and marigolds nearest Track Three meant, Wait until the last light, then follow the mirrored stranger. [259]
I did not know who had left the code, only that our correspondence had been blooming for months. [277]
I called them the Florist, and I suspected they knew more about my stolen faces than I did. [295]
The mirrored stranger arrived in the reflection before they arrived in the flesh, a silhouette rippling in the station window. [315]
They stepped into my angle of vision just as the sun caught their cheek, and my fingers tightened on the camera. [336]
Their eyes flashed as if they recognized the theft before it happened, as if already lit by my yet-unpressed shutter. [356]
You brought the jar, they said, nodding toward the moonbeams glass, though I was certain I had never shown it to anyone. [378]
Their voice sat somewhere between question and prophecy, and the air around us brightened like film left too long in the chemicals. [400]
Who are you, I asked, though the flowers had already whispered one answer: the one who will reinterpret your work. [420]
They smiled with a kind of luminous disbelief, as if baffled that the universe still bothered to surprise them. [439]
I am here to show you what you have really been stealing, they said, and gestured toward the tracks. [458]
The last light dropped lower, sliding between pillars, striping our faces gold and shadows, a countdown painted in geometry. [477]
Take my portrait, they said, but first open the jar. [487]
I hesitated, because the moonbeams were my only superstition, gathered over years on rooftops when insomnia turned the sky to confession. [508]
Still, destiny's door was humming somewhere beyond the tracks, and my ear had been aching against it for too long. [528]
I twisted the lid, and the jar of captured moonbeams sighed open, releasing thin rivers of silver that climbed the station columns. [550]
They spilled into the fading sunlight, mixing gold with milk-pale light until the whole platform looked underwater, preserved in some impossible aquarium. [572]
Take it now, the stranger urged, and there was no telling whether they meant the picture, the moment, or the future. [593]
I raised the camera, framed their face against the drifting light, and saw not only them but every person I had ever captured. [616]
In the viewfinder each portrait layered behind the next, transparent, illuminated moments stacking like glass until the stranger's features were prismatic. [637]
They were not one person but an archive of stolen instants, the Florist, the coded messages, all threaded through my own hunger. [659]
Do you see, they asked softly, how you have been waiting at the hinge instead of stepping through. [677]
I pressed the shutter, and the sound cracked the air like a knuckle against wood, like the first knock answered from the other side. [701]
When I lowered the camera, the platform was empty, yet the jar in my hand brimmed again, now with tiny burning reflections of faces. [725]
I realized the moonbeams had not been light at all, but the echo of every gaze I had ever stolen and never understood. [748]
Emerald Station flickered back into ordinary night, the aquariums of light gone, the bouquets merely flowers again, damp and fragrant and undeciphered by passersby. [772]
I walked home under a cool, unspectacular moon, jar glowing, unsure whether I had stolen or been stolen. [790]</story>
