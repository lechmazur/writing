<story>They brought me in at dusk, when the sky and the sea shared the same exhausted bruise above the lighthouse prison off a jagged reef. [25]
The guards rowed in silence, their oars clicking like teeth each time the boat slid between black teeth of stone. [45]
They had shackled my ankles, though there was nowhere to run except into the waves and their patient knives. [64]
One guard finally spoke my name, then corrected himself and smirked, calling me instead the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son. [86]
As if my father had not already paid for his shouts with torn throats and torn trust. [103]
As if the world did not still bleed from believing him once, and refusing him after. [119]
Inside the tower the air smelled of rust, wet stone, and the old smoke of lanterns that no longer burned. [139]
Cells climbed the spiral like stacked mouths, each barred window a missing tooth in the cylindrical jaw. [156]
My own cell held a cot, a bucket, and a narrow slit where glass had once been, now plugged by a lattice from confessional bolted to the salt-shot stone. [185]
Through its crossing bars I could see three things: a wedge of horizon, a sliver of water, and the failing copperlight repose of evening settling over both. [212]
Most men here scream; I listened. [218]
My father had taught me that if you lie to the world, the world eventually stops answering, but if you listen hard enough, it will whisper ways it can be changed. [249]
He said every prison is a story told so often the stones begin to repeat it, and that story sustains impossibilities in its cracks. [273]
Some impossibilities keep you in; others, if you are quiet, will let you out. [287]
I was brought here, they believed, for fraud and for fraud's inheritance, for tricking men into chasing hush across empty fields where no wolves waited. [312]
They do not know I came because this is the one place where everyone agrees the truth cannot be trusted. [332]
In such a place a new story can be born without immediately being strangled by proof. [348]
I mean to grow one strong enough to open stone. [358]
Nights, when the sea climbs the reef and hurls itself against the walls, I stand at the confessional lattice and map the tower by its groans. [384]
From below comes the deep roll of foundation stones shifting; from above, a higher note, like a giant inhaling through bad lungs. [406]
Between them, somewhere in the turning stair, I hear a third sound, thinner than wind. [421]
It is not stone or sea, but a faint, continuous shiver, as if a mouth I cannot see is trying not to laugh. [444]
That is the sound I follow, because my father told me that to thread a labyrinth with your own story, you must first find where the laughter waits. [472]
So I shift my cot, count the stones, and press my ear to the wall until the cold numbs my jaw. [493]
The listening leads me, not forward or back, but sideways, toward the corridor the guards pretend not to see. [512]
At its end waits a narrow iron-plated door, never fully closed, never opened, breathing flakes of rust each time the tower shifts. [534]
Generations of fists have beaten it; their scuffs gray the metal in crescents around the handle. [550]
When the guards sleep, I kneel there and let my eyes adjust, peering through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades until shapes swim in the darkness beyond. [581]
I do not see stones, or cells, or chains, but thin lights stacked in spirals that hover where floors ought to be. [603]
They bob like will-o-the-wisps in a staircase that forgot which way was up. [616]
Between them drift pages, or things that want to be pages, translucent and sleepless, turning themselves in slow, soundless gusts. [636]
It is a library of unfinished paths, a place where every story that never quite got believed comes to wait. [656]
I understand then why the tower shivers, why its stones mutter at night. [669]
The lighthouse is not only a prison; it is a throat clogged with tales no one was patient enough to swallow. [690]
My father's last story might be in there, the one he was trying to tell when the village turned its back and the wolves finally came. [716]
If I can find it, finish it, and set it walking, perhaps it will clear his name, or at least muddy mine into something of my own making. [744]
All of this must happen before they find the bodies out on the reef, before they realize that the missing men did not drown so much as vanish into sentences. [774]
For now, the island still believes in ordinary deaths, in accidents and storms, and that belief is a cloak wrapped about my shoulders. [797]</story>
