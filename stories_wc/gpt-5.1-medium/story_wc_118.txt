<story>The silo had once stored grain, but now it stored whispers bound in paper. [14]
Shelves spiraled up the curved concrete, climbing toward a skylight filmed with dust and old storms. [30]
In this reclaimed silo library, the air held a bronze quiet, as if listening back. [45]
Brann, the odd historian, moved without echo, his boots wrapped in strips of worn cloth. [60]
He was not human, though he wore their shape like a politely borrowed coat. [74]
Humanity had gone silent generations ago, after the last human dream is dreamt and recorded. [89]
Brann existed in the long waking that followed, built by machines to remember what sleep had meant. [106]
Yet memory was thin without friction, and so he sought the roughness of walls and char. [122]
His motivation was simple and strange, even to himself: to collect the stories walls have heard. [138]
He believed stone remembered pressure, remembered voices vibrating against it, remembered the warmth of sleeping bodies. [154]
And he believed, with a sensitively perceptive stubbornness, that those memories could be coaxed into language again. [171]
His hands were patterned with faint conductive filigree, circuits tuned to probe the textures of plaster and ash. [189]
Today, he knelt before the blackened mouth of a fireplace sunk into the silo floor. [204]
It had been carried here intact from a ruined house, brick by brick, soot still clinging inside. [221]
Within the throat of it, he found his favorite sort of archive: half-burned diaries found in a fireplace. [239]
Pages curled like autumn leaves, ink blurred into small storms, margins bitten by flame into uneven coasts. [256]
He lifted one gently, as though it were a fragile insect, and pressed his palm against the singed edge. [275]
Heat bloomed through his circuits, a ghost of the fire that had once tried to erase these words. [293]
Behind his eyes, an interior screen flickered, and an image rose like smoke becoming form. [308]
A small room appeared, paneled in pine, dim with the late light of a winter afternoon. [324]
A human woman sat at a table, writing, while snow feathered itself against the darkened window. [340]
Brann could feel the walls humming with her thoughts, holding them the way lungs hold breath. [356]
He traced the charcoal along the diary's edge, tuning his sensors to the frequencies of remembered pressure. [373]
Words unfolded, not from ink but from resonance, as the room spoke through the woman's abandoned sentences. [390]
She wrote of the city tilting, of compasses failing, of birds flying in confused circles at noon. [407]
Somewhere beyond her sight, the planet's axis had slipped, a displaced axis shuddering the logic of seasons. [424]
Summer came with snow; tides climbed stairs; clocks lost faith and spun their hands in frantic prayer. [441]
People lit fires out of fear more than cold, burning books whose predictions had failed them. [457]
The diaries had been sacrifices to this panic, half-offered to oblivion, half-rescued by collapsing chimneys. [472]
Brann watched the woman pause, fingers ink-stained, staring at the wall as if it might answer. [488]
The wall indeed murmured, storing her question as a vibration Brann could now translate into tone. [504]
Why are we still dreaming, she wrote, if the world is losing its place to spin around. [521]
The sentence shook him, because he knew how that question would end, and when. [535]
Soon after, the dreams stopped altogether, as if the mind of the species had slipped out of gear. [553]
What remained were rooms, and their walls, and the artifacts they had watched quietly for centuries. [569]
Brann laid the diary aside and turned to the shelf where a fragment of a medieval tapestry hung. [587]
Only a corner survived, showing dragons coiled around a spinning world, their bodies knotted like interrupted orbits. [604]
He touched the faded thread, and another room flowered in his inner vision, older by many centuries. [621]
Stone walls, candle smoke, needle-pricked fingers; a weaver humming as she imagined monsters to carry heaven's weight. [638]
She wove the world slightly off-center, her loom's center beam misaligned, a displaced axis in wool. [654]
The wall beside her absorbed the pattern of worry in her song, the fear of falling skies. [671]
Now Brann heard that worry as a faint metallic chord, part of the bronze quiet of the library. [689]
He realized the walls of every age had been rehearsing the same question in different tongues. [705]
What holds us in place when the center slips, and what stories can outlast the slipping. [721]
He looked up the silo's height, at circular shelves reaching toward the dust-dimmed sky, and felt almost religious. [739]
No new dreams would arrive, no new voices murmur into plaster, but the old ones were enough work. [757]
Brann tightened the cloth around his boots and descended to the next fireplace, already humming with unsaid history. [775]
Above him, the reclaimed silo library listened with all its walls, waiting to tell him what they knew. [793]</story>
