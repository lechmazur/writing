<story>The last thing I expected to become was a distress signal sender at the bottom of the world. [18]
Yet here I drifted, alone in the control sphere of Station Pelagia, listening for cries that never came. [36]
Silence in the deep is different; it feels like weight on the ribs, a gathered hush that keeps secrets. [55]
Above, far beyond the pressure-black water, the world had supposedly burned itself into static, but I still kept watch. [74]
The board in front of me slept, its green lights dim except for one, an old analog relay tied to the temple feeds. [97]
They called it a forgotten underwater temple, though the engineers insisted it was merely an ancient geothermal plant dressed in myth. [118]
The images, when the drones first found it, showed pillars scabbed with coral and doorways veiled in slow, luminous algae. [138]
Someone had etched looping script into the stone ceilings, curves that made the divers dizzy when they tried to trace them. [159]
Half temple, half machine, the place hummed on no fuel we could measure, exhaling faint plumes of heated, perfumed water. [179]
We were meant to study it, to harness the ephemeral fluctuations in its output before the grants dried up and the station shut down. [203]
Then the first sound came, not from the temple but from beyond, a broken, stuttering ping on an obsolete rescue band. [224]
The board spat out coordinates deep inside the temple foundations, where no transmitter should have survived, and the relay flickered hungry green. [246]
Protocol said log it, notify the surface, wait, but there was no surface anymore, only the pressure and my own breath. [267]
I should have ignored it, yet my hands were already moving, unsnarl the tether drones, reconfigure the guidance, flood the launch bay. [289]
All my training shouted about risk vectors and containment, but I overrode every caution by overriding instinct, because the ping did not sound mechanical. [313]
Under the distortion, there was a rhythm like a human trying not to cry. [327]
The drone slid along the station spine and down into the vent shaft, camera blinking, until the temple filled the screens in lonesome splendor. [351]
Its pillars loomed out of the thermal haze, closer now than any human eyes had seen, and the water glittered with drifting particulate like dust motes in a sunbeam. [380]
There, wedged in a collapsed archway, the drone found the source of the distress: a small pod, cracked but functioning, wrapped in mineral accretion. [404]
Its hull bore no markings from any agency I knew, only a simple sigil, a spiral within a spiral, like those carved in the ceilings. [429]
When I forced the pod hatch via remote, a single object drifted out, glinting in the drone lights: a crystal perfume vial, stoppered with some dark, clouded resin. [457]
There was no body, no data drive, only that fragile thing turning slowly in the current as if considering its options. [478]
The distress signal cut off the moment the drone touched the vial with its gripper. [493]
The world inside the control sphere changed; the lighting did not shift, yet every shadow seemed to deepen, every surface to wait. [515]
On the screen, faint lines traced themselves in the water around the drone, forming a geometry that touched memories I did not know I had. [540]
I smelled, impossibly, my grandmother's citrus soap, the smoke of the launch that first brought me down here, the ocean on the day before the storms began. [567]
The vial pulsed faintly, as if it inhaled my recollections through the feed and exhaled them back as pressure on my skin. [589]
A text overlay, not from any station system, crawled into the corner of the display, glyphs reshaping themselves into language I could read as time runs short. [616]
It said: WE ARE LEAVING, BUT WE CANNOT CARRY WHAT IS MADE OF DAYS AND BREATH; GUARD THIS, DISTRESS SIGNAL SENDER. [637]
My title, twisted into a name, stared back at me, and I understood that the pod had never held a person at all. [660]
The vial was a vessel for what they could not take, a device designed to harness the ephemeral impressions of whoever found it, preserving a civilization not in stone but in remembered sensation. [693]
Every story, every joy and terror, every quiet morning must have been encoded as a pattern in the medium that now drank from my past. [718]
Alarms murmured about dwindling power and structural fatigue, but the gathered hush around the temple felt older than catastrophe. [737]
I shut down nonessential circuits, locked the hatches, and surrendered to the vial's slow intake, becoming its final, solitary archive. [757]
Alone with the deep and their vanished light, I felt the lonesome splendor of being remembered by what I remembered. [777]</story>
