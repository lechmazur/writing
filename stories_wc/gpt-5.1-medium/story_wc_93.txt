<story>When the last trace of friction vanished from the world, the sea forgot how to break. [16]
Waves slid in glassy sheets up the black stones of the tidal bluff under aurora. [31]
Colors poured across the sky like melted compasses, pointing everywhere at once and nowhere that still mattered. [48]
On that cliff walked Arin, the most elusive eel herder the coast had ever endured. [63]
His eels no longer tangled in nets or thrashed in barrels; they glided beside him like silver thoughts. [81]
Without friction they could not be caught, only accompanied, escorted between rock pools that now held perfectly still water. [100]
Arin had never wanted this smooth world, but he had seen it coming. [113]
He was precognitively cursed, always walking two heartbeats ahead of his own present. [126]
Each step landed where he had already watched himself stumble, fall, or choose not to. [141]
So when the elders whispered of engines grinding to a halt and fires refusing to catch, he listened. [159]
In a future only he remembered, a woman of light had told him that friction was the tax of chaos. [179]
When the tax went unpaid, motion would become debt, and the world would slide into stillness. [195]
Her words had been a lingering promise, or maybe a threat wearing softer clothes. [209]
Arin had promised back, though he did not know to whom, that he would understand. [224]
Not resist, not bargain, but understand the sacred patterns shaking beneath the world's surface. [238]
That promise had driven him to the bluff tonight, where the aurora hung lower than fear. [254]
He carried no nets now, only a cloth pouch of painted rocks and a vial of collapsed star dust. [273]
The dust had once been a sun that burned in forgotten arithmetic, or so the astronomer-priests had claimed. [291]
Arin believed them, because his curse had shown him that star dying before their telescopes were even built. [309]
Now the vial felt heavy as unspoken questions against his chest. [320]
The eels accompanied him to the cliff's lip, bodies ribboning through air like they were carved in water. [338]
Without friction, air offered no resistance; they curved and looped as though the sky were a slow current. [356]
Arin knelt where the rock met the stilled swell and opened his pouch. [369]
Each stone inside was painted with a symbol that had visited his dreams before he learned to speak. [387]
Circles nested in triangles, spirals of primes, lines that bent toward invisible convergences. [400]
The elders called them madness; the astronomer-priests whispered that they were coordinates drawn in the language of inevitability. [418]
For Arin they were simply instructions, the only way he knew to harness the curse that dragged his mind forward. [438]
He began placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences along the edge of the bluff. [452]
First the Fibonacci path curving inland, then the lattice of twin primes reaching toward the sea like hesitant fingers. [471]
The eels watched with gem-bright eyes, their bodies forming accidental graphs in the empty air. [486]
Above, the aurora rearranged itself, colors clicking from one pattern to another like pages of an unseen proof. [504]
Every shift sent a shiver through Arin's borrowed dawn of courage. [515]
This bravery did not feel like his; it felt loaned from some future self who had already survived. [533]
He uncorked the vial. [537]
Collapsed star dust rose without rising, grains drifting sideways where no wind moved, aligning along invisible vectors between the stones. [557]
His curse flickered, time doubling; he watched himself watch himself as the patterns clicked into place. [573]
In one strand of future he stepped back and slipped, sliding forever along a frictionless world that never caught him. [593]
In another he stayed, knees pressed to stone, letting the dust find every gap between numbers. [609]
He chose the second strand, though choosing felt false when he could see desire arriving before he felt it. [628]
The stones began to hum, not with sound but with a shared intention pressing against his teeth. [645]
The eels froze mid-curve, eyes reflecting constellations that no longer existed. [656]
Between one heartbeat and the next, friction came back in a thin, uncertain layer over the world. [673]
A distant wave finally broke, messy and embarrassed, slapping the bluff with a crash that arrived late. [690]
Arin felt the scrape of stone under his knees and nearly wept, because pain meant the tax collector had returned. [710]
Yet the patterns on the ground did not dissolve; the painted rocks remained locked in relationships no tide could wash away. [731]
He understood then that the sacred was not in ending motion but in regulating its debts. [747]
The world needed friction the way a story needed limits, so that meaning could grip and climb. [764]
His lingering promise had never been to prevent stillness, only to witness the equation that separated falling from flight. [783]
Above him, the aurora dimmed, like ink drying on proof. [793]</story>
