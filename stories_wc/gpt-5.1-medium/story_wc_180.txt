<story>By the time the apples ripened in the rafters, the contract lay in ashes on the cathedral floor. [18]
Above me, a lush orchard spanning the rafters of an abandoned cathedral breathed its green hush into the broken nave. [38]
I, the quartz-eye mender of this place, was the one who had signed that impossible contract. [54]
Now, after the breach of contract, every echo under these ribs of stone sounded like a question I had dodged. [74]
I had come back for one reason only, and it was not remorse but the stubborn urge to bridge generational wisdom. [95]
In my pocket lay my daughter's hair ribbon, faded to a soft ghost of red, knotted three times for courage. [115]
She had left it on my workbench the morning she said, with endearingly feisty certainty, that she would never mend glass for a living. [139]
She wanted to splice roots and graft branches, to coax fruit out of abandoned places instead of fixing what others had shattered. [161]
When the bishop sold the cathedral roof to a consortium of bankers, I signed a clever little document promising to make it useful again. [185]
I thought I was securing space for my daughter's experiments; instead, I allowed them to install the spells that turned stone dust into soil. [209]
The contract said the orchard would belong to the bank, the light to the bishop, and the risk to the undersigned mender. [231]
Risk, I learned, could grow like moss, soft until you tried to pull it free. [246]
When harvest time came, the bankers demanded the fruit and the seeds and even the roots, leaving nothing for the soil or for my daughter. [271]
I refused, tore the contract in half, and the spells shuddered, turning the orchard feral overnight. [287]
Branches plunged through stained glass windows, roots buckled the flagstones, and apples began to ripen in unfamiliar, unsettling colors. [306]
The bishop called it a curse, but I heard in the creaking limbs something else, a kind of deciduous vows whispered between stone and sap. [331]
These were promises that could be shed like leaves, renewed each season, instead of chiseled forever into contracts no one read twice. [353]
My daughter had stormed out the day I signed, and I had not seen her since. [369]
Now I stood beneath her runaway orchard, clutching her ribbon, hoping the trees had learned from both of us. [388]
To reach the higher branches, I rummaged through my old repair bag, using forgotten bag contents as though they were relics from another lifetime. [412]
A cracked lens became a makeshift magnifier, a bundle of copper wire a ladder of hooks, and a strip of lead a careful counterweight. [436]
Mending had taught me how to coax fractures into alignment, but trees obeyed a different grammar, one my daughter spoke instinctively. [457]
So I did what I always did when I did not understand: I began to persist with small, clumsy kindnesses. [477]
I pruned where branches strangled each other, whispered apologies where I cut too deep, and tied my daughter's hair ribbon around the trunk that seemed most watchful. [504]
The ribbon fluttered, and for a moment the whole orchard hushed, like a congregation holding its breath between confession and absolution. [525]
One of the apples above me shimmered, reflecting in my quartz eye with a clarity no human glass had ever held. [546]
Inside its mirrored skin I saw my daughter, older, kneeling in some other ruin, teaching children how to graft hope onto stubborn rootstock. [569]
She was still endearingly feisty, scolding a boy for cutting carelessly, then laughing as he invented a new way to splice two saplings together. [593]
The vision wavered, and I realized the fruit was not showing me fate but possibility, the unwritten clauses of a different kind of agreement. [617]
We could abandon ironclad contracts and learn instead from deciduous vows, accepting that promises must fall and regrow to stay alive. [638]
The orchard did not need an owner so much as a caretaker who would listen each season and answer in pruning and patience. [661]
I spoke aloud, feeling foolish, and offered the trees a new bargain, one without ink or witnesses. [678]
I would tend them until my daughter returned, and they, in turn, would keep showing me glimpses of futures where our mistakes composted into wisdom. [703]
If she never came, the children she taught in that shimmering elsewhere would find this place, guided by seeds carried in their pockets like small, beating hearts. [730]
I did not expect the trees to answer, yet a slow rain of petals fell from the highest boughs, dusting me in pale agreement. [754]
Somewhere in their rustling I heard my daughter's impatient voice, mocking my accidental wisdom for arriving years later than it should have. [776]</story>
