<story>The wandering fireworks designer arrived at the blooming fortress at dusk, humming under his breath. [15]
By habit he chants while walking, little nonsensical rhymes to keep doubt from clumping. [29]
Tonight the rhymes stumble, because the sky above the broken battlements shows no single star. [44]
It is the hush of a night with no stars, when even mistakes sound louder. [59]
He has come to defy the gravity of hopelessness settling over the fortress like extra stone. [75]
The garrison believes the invading army will arrive at dawn; he believes despair will arrive first. [91]
They hired him not for weapons, but for spectacle, as if light could negotiate surrender. [106]
He prefers to think of it as building a ladder from sparks, rung by glittering rung. [122]
The courtyard smells of damp earth and bruised petals, because the fortress literally blooms. [136]
Vines climb the stone towers, heavy with night-opening flowers that turn walls into exhaling gardens. [151]
When breezes pass, the blossoms brush each other with soft clicks, like cautious marbles in a pouch. [168]
Lanterns are covered; archers demand darkness, so only his small workfire shows an orange eye. [183]
He kneels beside his crates, fingers finding each shell by shape rather than sight, practicing ambient awareness. [200]
It is how he designs, through ambient awareness of crowd breaths, stone echoes, and unspoken wishes. [216]
He listens now to the fortress itself, inhales fear and pollen, filters them through his ribcage. [232]
What remains after the filter is a steady ache shaped like a question mark facing upward. [248]
On the flagstones beside him lies the fire spinner's kerosene rag knot, dark and pungent. [263]
It is not his tool, but the spinner's caravan never arrived, trapped beyond the flooded road. [279]
The captain had tossed the knot to him, saying, Do something with this or burn it. [295]
So he studies it now, the coarse cloth twisted tight around fuel-soaked intention. [308]
A fire spinner uses knots as punctuation, he remembers; every loop is a pause in flame. [324]
His own art is grammar in the sky, bursts that say stay when the horizon says run. [341]
He ties the rag knot to a length of fuse, whispering his walking chant under his breath. [358]
Wander wide, fire inside, ash to guide, he murmurs, the words pattering like small bare feet. [374]
From the ramparts come snatches of soldier talk, brittle jokes spring-loading fear into laughter. [388]
They think him foolish, this wandering fireworks designer who treats despair like a design flaw. [403]
He thinks them brave for staying put when every instinct screams to be brightly elsewhere. [418]
He arranges his shells along the courtyard's inner circle, aligning them with cracks in the stone. [434]
From above, the pattern will look like nothing, a scatter of metal mouths waiting to shout. [450]
Only when the fuses run will the message assemble itself, a note in mosaic written with fire. [467]
He scratches the design in charcoal on the flagstones: a vast hand cupped beneath the sky. [483]
The fingers will blossom from rockets; the palm will be the whirling knot, burning like a seed. [500]
The note it will write across the starless firmament is plain: You are still held. [515]
He hopes the soldiers read it, yes, but more than that, he hopes the night reads it. [532]
He wants the darkness to feel, for once, that something has reached up instead of down. [548]
A messenger descends the stair, armor rattling softly, and says the captain demands to know his progress. [565]
Tell her the sky is a stubborn page, he answers, but I am learning its margins. [581]
The messenger snorts, yet lingers to watch as he oils the rag knot, hands moving with serious playfulness. [599]
Every motion is exact, measured against disaster, yet he flicks the fuse like a teasing cat's tail. [616]
He remembers other cities, other ramparts, nights when fireworks meant harvest festivals instead of sieges. [631]
He remembers failing once, a misjudged wind turning his ladder of sparks into a rain of scars. [648]
That was when he began to chant while walking, to weigh each step against unlit grief. [664]
Now he walks the circle of shells, murmuring, Let it lift them, let it lift me. [680]
On the wall above, the captain watches, her stern profile cut from the same stone as the parapet. [698]
She cannot command the clouds or the enemy, but she has hired this one piece of defiance. [715]
When he gives the signal, archers will loose no arrows; instead, they will simply watch with everyone else. [733]
He waits until the night feels thick enough to touch, until even his chants come out whisper-thin. [750]
Then he lights the first fuse with a coal, and the fire spinner's knot drinks flame hungrily. [767]
The courtyard explodes into running sparks that race along their paths, assembling his mosaic of refusal. [783]
Above the blooming fortress, a giant hand of fire opens, palm up, catching hearts before they fall. [800]</story>
