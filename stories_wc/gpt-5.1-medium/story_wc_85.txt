<story>On the cobalt terrace at dusk, I laid my tools out like accusations. [13]
I am a black market genealogist, and every client leaves a new scar. [26]
Tonight the scars itch with a guilt I have finally decided to name. [39]
The air around me hangs thick under the weight of unspoken words. [51]
For years I have manufactured false memories for those willing to pay for kinder bloodlines. [66]
A heroic grandfather instead of a deserter, a lost child conjured from paper and ink. [81]
I told myself I was only softening the past, quelling pain that history refused to forget. [97]
But there is one record I never altered, one story I have never dared to quell. [113]
It is my own, and tonight I am here to discover the weight of a withheld truth. [130]
On the terrace railing lies a pocket watch, its glass shattered, a single watch hand missing. [146]
The gap in its face gapes back at me like a tooth pulled from time. [161]
That watch belonged to my father, though the man who raised me never knew it. [176]
He believed the story I sold him, the lie I had crafted in my own ledgers. [192]
I forged documents that severed me from my blood, erasing a name that tasted of iron. [208]
My client then was not a stranger but myself, hiding from a father condemned for smuggling lives. [225]
Beyond the terrace, the sea murmurs against the forgotten shore that cradled his trade. [239]
They once said shipments were arranged by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore. [254]
Each carved symbol meant a name, a price, a life diverted from official records. [268]
I never saw that code, only heard my father was drowned when the authorities closed in. [284]
My mother repeated it until it hardened, and I accepted the tale like a sentence already served. [301]
Years later I discovered a file marked with my name in a confiscated archive. [315]
Inside lay only the broken watch and a note that read, simply, Ask the shore. [330]
I built new identities for others, but for that note I built only silence. [344]
Now the silence feels like a sieved hush, as if the world has strained every sound except this question. [363]
I pocket the watch, feeling the absence of its missing hand like a pulse with no beat. [380]
Down the stone steps from the cobalt terrace, the path crumbles toward the shore. [394]
The dusk deepens, soft blue sliding into bruised purple over the restless water. [407]
I walk as if through the corridors of an unwritten file, each wave a page I once refused to open. [427]
When the sand gives way to heaps of driftwood, I see them: carvings, half buried, their edges softened by years. [447]
Some are simple circles, some jagged lines, some shapes like anchors hooked into nothing. [461]
I kneel and begin my search by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore, fingertips tracing each groove. [480]
The patterns are not letters I know, yet something in them pricks like half-remembered handwriting. [495]
I have spent a lifetime engineering false ancestries, but this language refuses to be edited. [510]
After a while I notice one symbol recurring, a forked line crossed by a short slash near its center. [529]
Holding the watch to the dim light, I see the same forked emblem etched beneath the missing hand. [547]
The realization snaps something that has ached wordlessly for years, like a bone finally admitting its break. [564]
My father did not merely smuggle strangers; he smuggled the past itself, spiriting records away from those who would weaponize them. [585]
These carvings are the index of the erased, the genealogy of people allowed to begin again. [601]
In every forged tree I ever sold, in every invented ancestor, I have unknowingly echoed his work. [618]
Where he carved in secret to protect the living, I typed in secret to comfort them. [634]
Yet my comfort carried a quieter cruelty, stealing the right to face the unsoftened truth. [649]
Kneeling among the driftwood, I feel the tempered regret of two lives crossing, his and mine. [665]
If I follow these symbols, I could reconstruct the hidden network, reveal names he died to shield. [682]
If I turn away, I continue the lineage of silence that began with my own first forgery. [699]
The sea whispers around the wood, the sound a sieved hush passing through generations of regret. [715]
I understand, suddenly, that the withheld truth is not only what my father did, but what I might yet choose to do. [737]
So I gather the carvings that bear the forked emblem, stacking them like fragile bones in my satchel. [755]
I will return to my trade, but this time I will not manufacture false memories; I will study these marks until I can read the truth they hold. [783]</story>
