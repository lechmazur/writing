<story>By the time the mysterious package arrived, Elias had already buried three generations of the same family. [17]
He was the only undertaker left in the rusted harbor town, and the work had made him quietly, densely weary. [37]
Still, he kept at it, inadvertently stubborn in the way of men who mistake exhaustion for duty. [54]
He told himself he was only trying to give rest a permanent address, one grave at a time. [72]
The package arrived at dusk, thudding against his door like a weak heartbeat. [85]
No return address, only a smear of salt and the faint reek of seaweed. [99]
Inside lay a broken lighthouse lens, its thick glass spidered with cracks that caught the fading light in shivered rainbows. [119]
Under it, folded to the size of a matchbox, was a chart drawn in cramped black ink. [136]
Elias recognized the patterns at once, though he had never seen this particular chart before. [151]
They were distress signals, coded in old lighthouse notation, the kind sailors once trusted more than prayer. [168]
The marks looped and crossed, diving off the edges of the paper like someone had tried to map panic itself. [188]
At the bottom, in a hand that trembled even in ink, were three words: Please come alone. [205]
Elias should have taken the lens to the harbor master or the priest, but their doors felt suddenly far away. [225]
The chart had marked coordinates just beyond the last buoy, where the sea went from gray to bottomless green. [244]
By full dark he was rowing out alone, the broken lens wrapped in oilcloth at his feet. [261]
The sea and sky pressed close, chasing what little stillness remained in him into some narrow corner of his chest. [281]
When he reached the coordinates, the water shone with a faint downward glow, as if a drowned moon were burning far below. [303]
The lens pulled in his hands, not with force but with insistence, aligning itself to the glow like a compass finally remembering north. [326]
Elias held the fractured glass over the gunwale, and the sea opened like an eye. [341]
The boat slid down through water that did not wet him, into a silence made of pressure and old bells. [361]
Lights bloomed around him, pale and swaying, and out of them assembled streets, plazas, and stone arches furred with barnacles. [381]
Elias realized he was drifting into a city built on the sea floor, not ruined but paused, like someone had pressed their thumb on time. [406]
At its center rose a building of glass and stone, its doors bowed outward as though swollen with unwritten words. [426]
He knew a library when he saw one, even in a forgotten underwater city no map had ever admitted existed. [446]
The boat bumped gently against the steps, and water thick as sleep lifted him onto the landing. [463]
Inside, shelves spiraled upward and downward, occupying impossible spaces, bending around corners that did not exist until they were needed. [483]
Books drifted like slow fish, pages fluttering without wind, each bound in materials he could not name. [500]
Some covers were pressed sea-salt, some were woven from hair or fog, and some seemed made of the moment before a person spoke. [523]
A figure waited at a central desk, pale as the library stones, wearing a keyring of coral and rusted brass. [543]
She regarded Elias with an appraiser's care, as if weighing his grief against the weight of the water overhead. [562]
You took your time, undertaker, she said, her voice muffled, like sound traveling through wet cloth. [578]
There are always more dead than hours, Elias answered, surprised to hear how brittle his own voice sounded here. [597]
Why have you called me, he asked. [604]
Because you work in rest, and rest has gone missing, she replied, and every absence leaves a record somewhere. [623]
She gestured, and the shelves shuddered, then parted to reveal a chamber sunk deeper than the rest of the stacks. [643]
Inside, tables lay overturned, bindings snapped, and books spilled open, their contents smeared into unreadable gray, as if drowned twice. [663]
These are the lives that never found conclusion, she said, their distress signals arrived all at once and broke the lens that receives them. [687]
The broken lighthouse lens in his pack warmed, answering some invisible call from the ravaged chamber. [703]
You carried the surface wound here, the librarian murmured, so perhaps you can help us mend the depth. [721]
I bury bodies, Elias protested, not cities, not whatever this is. [732]
You bury what the living refuse to carry, she said, which is only another way to say you revitalize what the world thinks finished. [756]
The task was not to heal the dead, he realized, but to shelve them properly, to give their uproar a coordinate, a permanent address of rest. [782]
He stepped between breaths and spines, occupying impossible spaces as chased stillness finally paused. [796]</story>
