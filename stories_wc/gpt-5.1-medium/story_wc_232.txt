<story>Elias kept his shop open long past midnight, though almost nobody bought antique maps anymore. [15]
Loneliness pressed against the glass display cases, but his empirically intuitive mind kept cataloging paths and possibilities. [32]
Each rolled chart and sea-stained parchment whispered of routes not taken, echoing the lingering promise he lived by. [50]
Years ago his sister Mara had sworn, We will find the doorway of decisions together. [65]
Then she vanished upriver without a map, leaving only a water-warped notebook and a receipt for metal type. [83]
Folded inside the receipt lay a type foundry matrix chip, etched with coordinates instead of letters. [99]
Elias had turned it over in his fingers for eight careful years, feeling decisions rust around him. [116]
On the first midsummer after he finally locked the shop for good, he followed a dream upstream. [133]
In the dream, Mara called to him as the creek rises, her voice bubbling through stone and fern. [151]
So at dawn he packed a lamp, the notebook, and the matrix chip, and walked toward the hills. [169]
His empirically intuitive streak distrusted compasses that spun near hidden ore, so he started following ants home instead. [187]
They traced black punctuation marks along tree roots, always finding the safest line between water and rock. [204]
Elias muttered thanks under his breath as the creek beside the trail thickened with melt and rain. [221]
The higher he climbed, the more the air smelled of iron and blossoms, an impossible mingling of foundry and garden. [241]
By noon he reached the ravine where the stream slipped under limestone and into a blooming cavern known only in rumors. [262]
Petals the size of his palms clung to the ceiling, exhaling pale pollen that glimmered in shafts of borrowed sunlight. [282]
Every blossom cupped a drop of water, each trembling with the creek's subterranean pulse as the creek rises above. [301]
The ants did not hesitate; they poured along a stone ledge, slipping through the petals as if through curtains. [320]
Elias followed with one hand on the wall, the other gripping the matrix chip like a talisman. [337]
At a bend the ceiling dropped, forcing him to crawl, and the petals brushed his neck with damp, fragrant mouths. [357]
The notebook's last page had shown a rough sketch of this passage, arrows pointing toward a question mark in darkness. [377]
Beneath the question mark Mara had written only, When the water decides, you must decide too. [393]
The phrase had become a lingering promise and a threat, tugging each time he avoided any real choice. [411]
Now, kneeling in the heart of rock, he heard the creek deepen, a slow surge echoing through the floor. [430]
Water began licking his knees, warmer than the air, carrying petals away in spinning constellations of color. [447]
Ahead, the ants climbed a vertical sheet of stone where no crack showed, converging on a point that started to glimmer. [468]
The matrix chip warmed in his fist, and faint lines unfolded across its surface like a map waking up. [487]
Where the chip brightened, the stone thinned, turning not transparent but undecided, as if it contained all possible doorways. [506]
He realized this was the doorway of decisions Mara had sought, a hinge in reality tuned to choice. [524]
Every map he had ever sold, every path he had ever traced for strangers, had been a rehearsal for this turn. [545]
The warming water tugged at his legs with growing urgency, reminding him that staying still was itself a decision. [564]
He pictured retreating, returning to the dead shop, locking his heart behind glass with the unsold maps. [581]
He pictured stepping through unknown stone, perhaps never coming back, perhaps finding only more unanswered questions and no Mara. [600]
The chip brightened further, projecting a lattice of potential paths across the wall, each line flickering like a possible life. [620]
His empirically intuitive instincts, trained on contours and currents, sifted those paths as if weighing elevations and hazards. [638]
One route bent back toward town, neat and safe; another tunneled beneath the creek, thin as hope. [655]
A third, faint and stubborn, climbed into blankness, labeled only with the same small question mark as in Mara's sketch. [675]
He thought of the lingering promise they had made, not to avoid choice but to meet it with their whole attention. [696]
As the creek rises behind him, pooling cold around his ribs, Elias reached toward the faint path and set the chip against the undecided stone. [721]
The wall softened with a sound like paper turning, and the ants vanished through first, precise as ink. [739]
He followed, not knowing which life the doorway had chosen with him, only that at last he was choosing. [758]</story>
