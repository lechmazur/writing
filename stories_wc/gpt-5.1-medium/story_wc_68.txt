<story>After the plague ended, the city finally stopped screaming. [9]
It only gurgled now, half drowned, its avenues collapsed into canals and its towers leaning like broken teeth above the gray water. [31]
I took that as an invitation to move in, down where the old storm drains fed the sewers under the sunken city ruins. [54]
Philosophers always did their best work underground anyway, or so I told myself while wading through ankle deep filth. [73]
Calling myself a philosopher was ambitious, yes, but I was at least a consistent wannabe philosopher living in a sewer. [93]
When your address is below the rat line, people expect delusion, and I prefer mine to be well reasoned. [112]
They say the floods came before the plague, or after, or during, depending on which survivor you listen to and how drunk they are. [136]
Competing narratives breed faster than bacteria, and the city is rotting with both. [149]
One story says the gods drowned us for arrogance; another blames engineers who drilled where the bedrock was only an old superstition away from giving out. [175]
My own theory is less poetic: centuries of neglect, a few poorly understood machines, and no one bothering to keep the manuals dry. [198]
The manuals matter, because someone has to remember the ancient methods before the last working hinge flakes into rust and myth. [219]
That is why I collect pieces, cogs, valves, any relic of how things were once done on purpose instead of by accident. [241]
The prize of my gutter museum is a single seafarer's chronometer cog, brass and stubborn, teeth still sharp despite the salt. [262]
I found it lodged in the silt where a harbor clock tower had sheared off and slid, slow and stately, through sedimentary layers of drowned marketplaces and forgotten prayers. [291]
Digging it out, I felt like a beetle burrowing through history's compost, careful not to snap any remaining gears of the past. [313]
Above me, the waterline slapped the broken stones in a rhythm suspiciously close to a heartbeat, but the city was long past caring. [336]
Once, the chronometer cog turned with thousands of others to tell sailors where they were on the ocean and when they might see land again. [361]
Now it sits on a rock shelf in my sewer cell, ticking only in my imagination while the actual time leaks away. [383]
Every evening, when the upper city starts its ritual of drunken forgetfulness, I light a stolen lamp and agonize over the cog's silence. [406]
If I knew the full design of the chronometer, I could restore its voice, make it a metronome for memory instead of letting it corrode into ornament. [433]
But the schematics are gone, eaten by mold or burned by priests who preferred their version of time, which ends conveniently at their altars. [457]
Up there, above the waterline and the rats and me, the new Council spins a clean narrative about the plague and the flood, about our glorious rebirth. [484]
They say the past was diseased, that the old devices brought contamination, and that real wisdom is to break everything complicated, just in case. [508]
I listen to their proclamations echoing down the storm drains, all polished hope and disinfected history, and I feel a rationally rebellious itch under my skin. [534]
If ignorance kept people alive, I might accept it, but ignorance only keeps them obedient, staring at the Council's mirrors instead of the water lines rising. [560]
So I rebel in the smallest, sharpest way I can: by preserving ancient methods, by rebuilding whatever I can coax from the muck and memory. [585]
Brass teaches patience; you can scrub and polish and argue with it, but it will not pretend to be anything other than what it is. [610]
People are not so honest, which is why two survivors of the same disaster can swear to opposite truths and both feel saintly about it. [635]
Down here, among the dripping arches and the slime, I can at least test a story against a rusted hinge or a stubborn bolt. [659]
If a tale claims the old bridges fell because the gods sneezed, I look at the shear marks and the water damage and quietly disagree. [684]
My calm about these things bothers people when they visit, because they want rage or tears, not this abrasive calm that scrapes against their cherished lies. [710]
But I have seen the city from the bottom up, through every clogged artery and collapsed corridor, and I know that truth settles like silt, stubborn and heavy, waiting for whatever rationally rebellious rat finally digs deep enough to feel its teeth on metal. [754]</story>
