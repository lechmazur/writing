<story>After the birds fly south, the palace courtyard remembers its old geometry in rustling dreams. [15]
Elias sits in the middle of it, on cracked tiles veined with moss and mint. [30]
Around him, glassless arches frame the sky, and bamboo screens uncloak the secret tea house. [45]
It is only open now, in the thinning light, when regular customers have forgotten it exists. [61]
That forgetting is why Elias comes, because he is a creeping normality noticer by temperament. [76]
He notices the small shifts everybody else accepts, the way absence hardens into decor. [90]
Today he has brought bread from the vanished bakery, wrapped in newspaper that still smells of yeast. [107]
The bakery shuttered last winter without farewell, its windows painted black overnight like sudden eclipse. [122]
But the ovens had been hot enough to finish one last batch, which appeared on his doorstep. [139]
No note, only steam, braided into the cold air like a question he still carries. [154]
The tea mistress emerges from behind the bamboo, her steps heuristically gentle, as if testing each tile. [171]
She adjusts her grey sleeves before speaking, as though language were something that might bruise. [186]
You kept it, she says, eyes on the wrapped loaf instead of his face. [200]
I did, Elias answers, though sometimes it feels like the bread kept me. [213]
He has not eaten it, though the crust has softened, the interior likely collapsed into fragrant ruin. [230]
He is waiting for a purpose that is not nostalgia or waste. [242]
Sit, she says, and the tea house seems to fold closer, an inhalation of wood and leaf. [259]
Steam rises from kettles suspended over a sunken brazier, tracing delicate currents in the cooling air. [275]
Beyond the low wall, the courtyard is an overgrown map of what once passed for order. [291]
Fig trees braid themselves through balustrades, rainwater pools in marble bowls, and feral camellias root in broken pots. [309]
Someone has planted beans and chicory among the ornamental thorns, their green insisting on being noticed. [325]
The city forgets this place, but Elias and a few others remember it through guerrilla gardening. [341]
They turn neglect into soil, smuggling seeds in coat linings, watering at dusk from stolen cisterns. [357]
He comes here to find the sacred in the ordinary, though he is not sure what sacred means anymore. [376]
The tea mistress pours golden liquid into chipped cups, the steam perfumed with fennel and something bitter. [393]
Absolution is not on the menu, she says, but people seem to sip at it anyway. [409]
Only the tenuous absolution of hot water and patience, he replies, and she almost smiles. [424]
He unwraps the loaf, revealing a collapsed dome, its crust blotched with flour like ancient plaster. [440]
The smell is astonishing, a reminder that the past was once merely someone else s present. [456]
I thought I would eat it when I forgave myself for not protesting, he says. [471]
For walking past the black-painted windows and deciding it was none of my business. [485]
Instead the bakery is gone, the city moved on, and the bread kept aging politely. [500]
You think you could have stopped it, the tea mistress asks, her tone observational rather than kind. [517]
I think I could have at least made it less quiet, he answers after a long swallow of tea. [536]
Some changes arrive like thunder, she says, and people rush to the windows to watch. [551]
Others creep in like ivy, leaf by leaf, until the building wakes up strangled and everyone calls it normal. [570]
You just happen to notice sooner than most. [578]
Is noticing anything more than an excuse, he asks, fingers tracing the bread s collapsed pattern. [594]
She tears the loaf in half, the crumb surprisingly soft, strands stretching like reluctant threads of memory. [611]
You brought it here, she says, which is different from throwing it away in the dark. [627]
You are letting it be witnessed, and sharing is a form of direction, if not control. [643]
They eat in small bites, dipping bread into tea until the last crumb dissolves into amber. [659]
Nothing miraculous happens, which feels like the closest thing to honesty either of them can manage. [675]
Outside the arches, the overgrown courtyard holds their silence as carefully as it holds the rain. [691]
When they finish, Elias feels no absolution, only a slight adjustment in his posture. [705]
It is enough to notice that warmth still rises from the cups, slowly, defiantly, into the cooling courtyard air. [724]</story>
