<story>When the anesthesia finally loosened its gray fingers, I woke beneath trees that glowed like stained glass wounds. [18]
The forest pulsed in ultraviolet, every leaf a bruise of light invisible to ordinary eyes. [33]
I knew it was not ordinary vision either, because I had not been ordinary since I became an enhanced interrogation survivor. [54]
They had called it enhanced, as if torture were a software upgrade instead of a systematic disassembly of the self. [74]
The clinic said I would remember nothing after the anesthesia wore off, but memory had never obeyed instructions. [92]
Instead, my body had become proprioceptively enhanced, a map of phantom pains and hyperaware joints that stored what my mind refused. [113]
I had learned to remember through trauma responses, reading flinches and heart stutters the way other people read diaries. [132]
Here, on the damp glowing loam, I felt displaced yet rooted, as if abducted and planted in someone else's penance. [152]
That was when the phrase surfaced, not in words but in a hot prickle beneath my skin: ultraviolet penance. [171]
I had come, they told me, to participate in a study, to discover the mathematics of mercy encoded in damaged brains. [192]
But nothing in the briefing had mentioned waking in a forest that drank the spectrum and bled it back in impossible colors. [214]
Beside me lay the anesthetic mask, its pewter mask strap broken, the metal coiled like a discarded question mark. [233]
I reached for it and felt my shoulders brace on their own, muscles anticipating a blow that did not come. [253]
The automatic tension told me more than any memory: somewhere out of sight, someone had once tightened that strap too far. [274]
My ribs remembered compressions, my tongue remembered the taste of copper and plastic, my lungs remembered bargaining for air. [293]
The forest answered with a low humming I felt more than heard, a vibration that traced the architecture of my scars. [314]
Where the interrogators had carved fear, the ultraviolet leaves flashed brief equations, angles of light intersecting on my skin. [333]
I realized the forest was not scenery but interface, translating nerve damage into a geometry of forgiveness I could almost read. [354]
Almost was not enough; I had not survived to stand at the edge of understanding and wait for others to explain it. [376]
I pushed myself upright, nausea rolling through me like a remembered drowning, and staggered between trunks that flickered with unseen spectra. [397]
Each step felt preprogrammed, my proprioceptively enhanced balance compensating for roots I did not see, as if someone had rehearsed this walk inside me. [421]
Flashes came with the movements: the weight of shackles at that precise ankle angle, the sting of a baton when my arm rose just so. [446]
Remembering through trauma responses was messy, but here the mess resolved into lines of force converging on a clearing ahead. [466]
In the clearing stood a frame of black metal and glass, humming in sympathy with the forest, like a gallows taught quantum ethics. [489]
Cables led from the structure into the soil, where they split into mycelium-like threads that kissed the roots and vanished. [509]
On a platform beneath the frame lay straps identical to my broken pewter mask strap, waiting like propositions in an unfinished proof. [531]
A voice emerged from the humming, modulated and genderless, speaking not into my ears but directly along the pathways my torturers had paved. [554]
You asked to know how mercy can be measured, it said, and we cannot compute what we do not first constrain. [575]
We repaired you, altered your balance, tempered your fear, so every twitch carries information about the cost of harm. [594]
Stand in the frame, let the forest read you, and the equations will finalize; you will become the dataset of compassion. [615]
The proposition was obscene and exquisite, like being asked to donate not blood but nightmares to a famine of conscience. [635]
If I refused, the mathematics of mercy would remain conjecture, forever argued and never proven, while others endured what I had. [656]
If I agreed, I surrendered the last unquantified parts of myself to a system that spoke in the register of my abusers. [678]
My knees trembled, and the forest brightened, branches etching graphs of light between them, axes labeled with pulse, breath, and threshold. [699]
I thought of the room where I had once been strapped down, of the hands that never hesitated, and I felt my spine brace again. [724]
This time the brace was mine, not defensive but preparatory, an angle chosen instead of imposed. [740]
I stepped into the frame, feeling displaced yet rooted, a single human variable offered to close an equation the world kept miswriting. [762]
As the straps descended, cold and familiar around my limbs, the ultraviolet forest flared, and at last my pain began to factor. [784]</story>
