<story>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night hummed like a sleeping heart buried beneath the frost. [17]
Over the hush of winter-cracked fields, its glass ribs glowed with a dim, patient phosphorescence. [32]
Inside, I tended the trees that bore metallic fruit and luminous seeds, apprenticed to a master long departed. [50]
He had left me nothing but his notebooks and the ashen-veil ghost bride who drifted between the rows. [68]
Her veil smoked gently in the darkness, as if every thread remembered the pyres of some forgotten ceremony. [86]
When she appeared, the air sharpened into mournful elation, grief braided with a sweetness too intense to bear. [104]
She never stayed long, only slipped through ephemeral cameo appearances, like a memory trying not to disturb the living. [123]
I called her Lady Veil, because it felt less presumptuous than learning the name of a ghost. [140]
She would ghost past my shoulder, a chill brushing my neck whenever my hands faltered over the grafting knives. [159]
One such night, as the distant fields cracked in the cold, she offered me a small carved stone bead. [178]
It rested in her palm like a captive moon, pale and pitted, etched with sigils that crawled when I blinked. [198]
Her voice, when it reached me, was lovingly venomous, each word caressing my ears while pricking at my doubts. [217]
You still do not remember, she whispered, though you planted the first of these trees with your blood and mine. [237]
Her words struck the bead, and something rang inside my chest, the first tremor of what she called resonant awakenings. [257]
I saw, for an instant, the greenhouse reborn as a chapel, branches woven into arches, her living hands entwined with mine. [278]
Then the vision shattered, and I stood again among metal fruits and bottled shadows, her hollow eyes studying my face. [298]
Why show me this, I asked, fingers closing around the bead; I have nothing you could wish to claim. [317]
Her smile slanted, sorrowful and sharp, like glass left too long in running water. [331]
I am not here to claim, she said; I am here to repay a debt across lifetimes, one you have forgotten. [352]
The bead warmed in my hand until the stone wept steam, and the orchard stirred as if hearing its own name. [373]
Branches creaked, not with wind but with remembrance, sap rising like breath drawn after too long underwater. [390]
This greenhouse was our covenant, she continued, a place where failed lives could find resonant awakenings in new roots and altered bodies. [412]
Once, you promised to return and free me when your work was done; instead you died elsewhere, and I waited. [432]
Her accusation should have frozen me, yet it slipped in like thaw-water, searching cracks I had not known were there. [452]
Memories surfaced: black soil under my nails, her laughter among blossom-scent, a ring of woven twigs on her wrist. [471]
In that other life, we had bound our futures to this orchard, seeking transmutation not of metals, but of endings. [491]
Death would feed fruit, fruit would carry echoes, and someday two souls would ripen enough to remember together. [509]
I had become that second soul by chance of birth, wandering here as an orphaned apprentice; she had never stopped being the first. [532]
What debt, I asked, voice rough; what could I possibly give you now, when I cannot even keep myself warm. [552]
She lifted her veil, and beneath it her face was both ruin and radiance, winter and the harvest it had promised. [573]
Stay until dawn that will never come, she said; keep the trees alive, and listen when the bead sings. [592]
Each time it calls, another life will remember, and the cage of this night will loosen by a single bar. [612]
Do this, and one evening the bead will fall silent, and I will walk out across the fields with you. [632]
Her terms rooted in me like seeds dropped in open furrows, simple and inexorable. [646]
Outside, over the hush of winter-cracked fields, the world had forgotten us, but the orchard had not, and neither had she. [667]
I pressed the carved bead to my lips, tasting mineral and old smoke, and swore the vow my former self had broken. [689]
The greenhouse heart beat once around me, branches bowing in solemn joy, and her form brightened, thin and triumphant in the endless night. [712]</story>
