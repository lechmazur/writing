<story>The day the circus packed up, the rain finally came and stayed. [12]
Now it whispered against the skylight of Mara's loft, beads of water tracing restless paths overhead. [28]
She called it her rain-beaded skylight loft, high above the emptied fairgrounds where the big top once stood. [46]
To the few who still wrote letters, Mara signed herself plainly: lion tamer's widow, no forwarding address. [63]
It sounded theatrical, but it was only accurate in the hauntingly practical way grief demanded. [78]
This morning, while the kettle boils on the single hot plate, she studies the ash wood carving blank. [96]
It lies in her palm like a small mute animal, pale and unmarked, waiting to be told. [113]
The carver in town said ash was forgiving, that it bent toward purpose instead of splintering. [129]
Mara had not believed him; nothing that lived or died under the big cats' gaze felt forgiving. [146]
Yet here it was, the wood that did not argue, asking only for shape and patience. [162]
Steam begins to cloud the glass above, softening the gray sky into something nearer to memory. [178]
When the kettle clicks off, the loft falls into that held breath of silence between here and gone. [196]
She does not move to pour the tea; instead she closes her fingers slowly around the blank. [213]
Her knuckles whiten as she tries to contain its smoothness, as if it might spill away like the sawdust smell of the tent. [236]
This is why she keeps it uncarved, she thinks: not to create, but to hold a pause. [253]
In the circus, pauses were dangerous, the spaces where a lion might remember its wildness and leap sideways. [271]
Luca used to step into those gaps deliberately, his boots tracing circles in straw as he waited. [288]
He said time could be coaxed like an animal, that fear loosened if you walked slow enough around it. [307]
The crowd believed he tamed lions; Mara knew he only tamed the seconds between their heartbeats. [323]
Those seconds had burst like beads on a broken string the night the new male refused to bow. [341]
No one blamed the lion; accidents, they called it, the way a storm is called weather, not intention. [359]
Afterward, she left the routes and railcars, fled to this tired city, to a loft that leaked stories. [377]
During the first storm, she lay under the rain-beaded skylight, hearing the downpour as crowd noise fading. [394]
The peace it brought was a rust-hued peace, stained by memory yet somehow warm, like weathered metal under a late sun. [415]
She had come here to harvest lessons from loss, though at first all she could reap was silence. [433]
The silence filled the corners, nested in the rafters, waited by the teacups like an uninvited patron. [450]
To live with it, she began carving the air, tracing invisible arcs as Luca once had in the ring. [469]
Her body remembered the sequence: step, turn, extend hand, pause, as if she moved through crystallized time. [486]
In those slow circuits around the empty loft, the sharpest edges of the day she found him began to soften. [506]
Not forgiveness, not yet, but a space where the memory could stand without lunging. [520]
The ash blank is different, more demanding than air, its weight insisting on a future form. [536]
She rolls it between her palms, feeling where the grain catches like small hesitations in speech. [552]
What would she carve, if she dared to let the wood remember something other than emptiness? [568]
Not a lion; she owes the living beasts their freedom from her story. [581]
Perhaps instead, a stool, the simple sort Luca sat on while polishing his boots behind the caravan. [598]
Or a small box, something meant to contain matches or buttons, ordinary sparks of a life he never reached. [617]
The ideas feel almost like betrayal, as if turning him into furniture might fix him in place forever. [635]
But then she remembers his hands, scarred yet deft, repairing cages and kettles with the same concentration. [652]
He was never romantic, only hauntingly practical, measuring love in tightened bolts and extra nails, in checked latches at midnight. [672]
If she carves something useful, she thinks, then his absence might sit beside her like a tool, not a wound. [692]
The kettle ticks as it cools, reminding her that even water only boils for a brief permission of heat. [711]
She sets the blank on the table, beside the cup, and finally reaches for the carving knife. [728]
Outside, the last of the circus trucks disappear down the slick road, red taillights smearing, here and gone. [746]
Inside, under the rain-beaded skylight, Mara draws the first careful line, opening the wood so something useful can stay. [765]</story>
