<story>The last petal slipped from the old rosebush beside the platform clock and did not stir. [16]
Only then, after the final petal drops from the old rosebush, did Elias arrive. [30]
The disused railway station, overgrown with ivy, lay quiet under a roof of glass and gathering dusk. [47]
Elias was a fictional historian by profession, a paradox he wore like a second coat. [62]
He wrote histories of invented kingdoms for novels and games, treating their records as meticulously as any archive. [80]
Yet tonight he had come not to invent but to rescue truth from a pit of lies. [97]
The ivy pressed through broken windows like thick handwriting, as though the station itself were being annotated by time. [116]
On the central bench waited a folder and, on top of it, an illuminated letter drawn on vellum. [134]
The letter was not a message but a single ornate capital, blue and red, curling with gold leaf. [152]
It was the letter T, the initial of a king who had never existed outside a bestselling series. [170]
Elias picked it up carefully, emotionally rational even in the half darkness, measuring awe against professional suspicion. [187]
He had designed this king years ago, shaping his reign out of real chronicles and plausible wars. [204]
The publisher had insisted the monarch be morally luminous, a model of noble lies told for the common good. [223]
Elias had obliged, giving the king secret massacres disguised as necessary sacrifices, then burying evidence in footnotes nobody read. [242]
The books sold millions, and the fictional kingdom leaked into classrooms, sermons, and political speeches hungry for simple righteousness. [261]
Now the publisher claimed to own not just the text but the history itself, commissioning scholars to cite it as precedent. [282]
A televised debate last month had waved Elias's imagined king like a flag to justify real emergency powers. [300]
Watching at home, Elias felt the floor tilt, as if his study had become a carriage leaving the tracks. [319]
To recapture control over his creation, he had demanded this meeting with the publisher's envoy at the forgotten station. [338]
The setting had been the envoy's idea, theatrical yet deniable, like everything else about the company. [354]
Footsteps clicked along the platform, and a woman in a gray suit emerged from the tunnel, carrying no briefcase. [373]
Her name was Mara, legal architect of the extended universe contracts, rumored to ghostwrite half the televised arguments. [391]
She sat opposite him, studying the illuminated letter between them as though it were a fragile insect. [408]
So, she said, you object to how truth imitates fiction when that fiction is profitable. [423]
I object, Elias replied, to how you sell those imitations as guidance while hiding the scaffolding I built from lies. [443]
He spoke slowly, emotionally rational, forcing each feeling into a shape that could stand as evidence. [459]
Your king is aspirational myth, Mara said, no more dangerous than an illuminated letter in a medieval margin. [477]
Readers understand it is curated, even exaggerated. [484]
Do they, Elias said, or do they treat stories like verdicts when those stories flatter the power they already hold. [504]
By drawing parallels between my invented crises and their own, your commentators smuggle in excuses they could not otherwise defend. [524]
People quote the king's speeches as if he were a founding father rather than a draft I revised twelve times. [544]
Mara's gaze drifted to the ivy, where a tendril had slipped through a busted clock face like a green hand. [564]
History has always been made of noble lies, she said, carefully; we merely admit the nobility and the fiction together. [584]
When a government borrows your king's tactics, that is their misuse, not our design. [598]
Then release the drafts, Elias said, the cut scenes, the memos where you ordered his crimes softened and his virtue emphasized. [619]
Let the public see the pit of lies under the throne, and choose whether to keep bowing. [636]
Mara hesitated, fingers resting on the illuminated T, tracing the gold that caught the station's thin scraps of light. [655]
You think truth is a solid object, she said, something you can recapture once it has escaped into culture. [674]
Elias shook his head, listening to a distant train that would never come, or had already passed unseen. [692]
I think truth is a relationship, he answered, and you are rewriting the terms without informed consent. [709]
Give me the rights back, let the king be footnoted as fiction, not paraded as authority. [725]
Otherwise I will publish my own history of this enterprise, with contracts quoted and dates attached, and let readers compare scriptures. [746]
Mara exhaled, the sound mixing with leaves rubbing against glass, like two pages reluctantly parting. [761]
You would undermine the faith that keeps millions steady, she said; you would pull away their guiding star. [779]
I would give them night vision instead, Elias said, standing as the ivy shivered, and the empty tracks swallowed their echoes. [800]</story>
