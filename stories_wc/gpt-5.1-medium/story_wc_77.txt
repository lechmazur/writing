<story>The lingering luminance began as a faint smear along the broken mirrors of the funhouse. [15]
No one had paid to enter this abandoned carnival funhouse for twenty years, yet it still glowed. [32]
Tonight, after the resuscitation, Elias followed that sickly light as if it were a summons. [47]
His whispering advisor kept pace inside his skull, every word a damp fingertip on his thoughts. [63]
You owe the darkness an answer, the advisor murmured, or it will take back what the doctors stole. [81]
Elias carried proof of that debt in his pocket: a photographically cursed Polaroid from the night he drowned. [99]
In every version he had tried to take since, his face appeared bloated, blue, and unmistakably dead. [116]
Only here, inside the rusted skeleton of spectacle, did the Polaroid fade to a pallid almost living tint. [134]
He followed the lingering luminance to the ticket booth, where an opera cloak clasp lay gleaming on the dusty ledge. [154]
It was shaped like twin masks, comedy and tragedy fused so tightly their mouths became a single wound. [172]
When Elias touched it, the whispering advisor gasped with something like pleasure, and the funhouse lights coughed awake. [190]
Rotting bulbs flickered on, vomiting yellow halos that made every cobweb glow with repulsive allure. [205]
The mirrors ahead no longer reflected him; they showed corridors twisting inward, lined with doors that opened into more doors. [225]
Remember why you came, the advisor sighed, voice as soft as spoiled fruit: to trick fear into revealing its weakness. [245]
Elias swallowed, feeling the thick saliva of hospital tubes still phantom in his throat, and stepped into the first corridor. [265]
On the floor lay a book he recognized from his childhood nightmares, a dream dictionary swollen with mildew and paradoxical notes. [286]
His grandmother had kept such a volume by her bed, scribbling corrections whenever her dreams contradicted the printed meanings. [305]
Now new handwriting crawled between the definitions, thin as veins: instructions left by his own panicked hand yesterday. [323]
Through paradoxical notes in a dream dictionary, his future self had been trying to warn his past self away. [342]
Do not trust the mirrors, one note read, unless they show you what you refuse to see. [359]
Another line, written over itself until the paper tore, commanded: Unbosom yourself to the thing you most dread. [377]
The funhouse air tightened, smelling of wet velvet and chemical smoke, as if listening for obedience. [393]
Elias stepped before a mirror that showed not his reflection but the moment of his drowning, looped like film. [412]
Children on the pier pointed at the river while his own body thrashed and went slack, face whitening with lingering luminance. [433]
He watched the lifeguard drag him out, watched the frantic hands on his chest, the blue lips, the awful stillness. [453]
After the resuscitation, the crowd had cheered; in the mirror, however, they recoiled as his revived self stood up alone. [473]
No one else moved; they hung in the air like badly developed photographs, their features smearing when he tried to focus. [494]
You came back wrong, the whispering advisor crooned, because fear finished the drowning before the water did. [511]
Trick it now, and you may finish returning. [519]
Elias felt a lure in that promise, equal parts salvation and rot, and stepped through the mirror like a curtain. [539]
Cold rushed over him, smelling of river mud and formaldehyde, and he found himself back on the pier. [557]
The crowd of frozen onlookers ringed his lifeless body, their eyes black negatives, their mouths wetly open but silent. [576]
Fear crouched among them, not a monster but a small boy wearing Elias's childhood face, teeth chattering in delight. [595]
It clutched the opera cloak clasp in both hands, worrying it like a rosary, each click another stolen heartbeat. [614]
Elias knew then that the clasp had fastened him to the moment of terror, keeping him photographically cursed in every image. [635]
If he wanted to finish returning, he would have to unbosom himself to that small, shivering thief. [652]
He knelt before the boy, feeling his adult knees grind on planks that should not hold weight from a dead man. [673]
I am more afraid of living than of dying, Elias confessed, words tasting like pond scum and anesthesia. [691]
Afraid of waking up every day with this brightness in my skull, this lingering luminance that never dims. [709]
The boy blinked, surprise wrinkling his borrowed features, and the repulsive allure of his grin slackened into something almost human. [729]
So you fear the light, it whispered, not the dark; you fear being seen continuing. [744]
Elias reached for the opera cloak clasp, and this time the boy did not resist as the cold metal left his hands. [766]
The moment of drowning shattered like glass, leaving Elias alone in the funhouse corridor, the Polaroid warm against his heart. [786]
His new Polaroid showed him breathing, haunted yet alive, darkness waiting patient without hunger. [800]</story>
