<story>By the time the strangers became family, the orchard planet had started to ring. [14]
Its twin moons pulled at the crust, loosening stone into floating rock arches that drifted like reefs. [31]
Between their shadows, trees bowed with fruit and lanterns, and the dead learned to walk again. [47]
I was one of those dead, an altruistic ghost who had never stopped organizing. [61]
In life I drafted petitions; in death I drafted routes for souls and satellites. [75]
The living called me Kerran, and somehow they still heard me when the arches chimed. [90]
Sound travels kindly for those who died trying to help. [100]
Our settlement clung to one particularly low arch, an iron-black loop cradling an old butterfly garden. [116]
No butterflies survived the long winter, but their butterfly garden watering bell still hung from a rusted chain. [134]
It was delicate, glass clouded with mineral ghosts, etched with spirals that caught the faint auroras. [150]
When the moons dragged the sky just right, wind threaded the arches and the bell would ring. [167]
Everyone thought the bell only marked weather, but that was before the first message appeared. [182]
I left it on the main promenade, three days after the quakes began. [195]
Meet at dawn under the watering bell, it read in chalk that stung my spectral fingers. [211]
Forty people came, blinking sleep from their eyes, heads wrapped in scarves against the unsettled wind. [227]
They could not see me, but they trusted the bell, and whoever could move chalk without hands. [244]
The arches hummed around us, groaning like tired ships. [253]
Today, I wrote, the planet will shed another ring; the northern orchards will fall into open sky. [270]
We must orchestrate a collective effort or watch the roots crack apart alone. [283]
Silence settled, then old Mara, whose sons had died in the methane blight, lifted her cane. [299]
I do not know this hand, she said, but it feels strangely trustworthy. [312]
That sentence loosened something I had tightened around my own memory of drowning in hospital light. [328]
I had died believing my last campaign, to clean the rivers, had failed utterly. [342]
But here, people were ready to move whole groves if a ghost asked kindly enough. [357]
We planned under the chiming bell until the twin suns burned white behind the arches. [372]
Families agreed to sleep in shifts, pack seedlings in insulated crates, braid harnesses from old tether lines. [389]
The youngest marked safe routes between arches with solar paint, tiny glowing veins over stone. [404]
For days I wrote instructions through messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn, before anyone swept. [420]
Move the apiaries; shore the cisterns; lash the ladders to the westernmost trunks. [433]
The quakes intensified, and fissures opened where children had played ring-ball only a week before. [448]
Still, they followed the chalk, and the chalk followed the bell, and the bell followed the arches. [465]
On the seventh day, the sky tore quietly open. [474]
Gas flared from the higher atmosphere, a violet river curling into itself, becoming a luminous bruise. [490]
Our astronomer, Ryo, wept behind his visor and whispered, The nebula of respite is forming. [505]
Legend said that when a world exhausted itself, the cosmos grew a soft harbor to cradle the pieces. [523]
We watched as the gas river spiraled above the northern orchards, slowing the fall of broken land. [540]
Chunks rose instead of falling, lifted by unseen tides, drifting toward the newborn nebula like seeds on wind. [558]
It would have been beautiful, if half our food and homes were not rooted to those chunks. [575]
Under the arch, our bell rang until it cracked. [584]
The sound pierced stone and skin and whatever gauze separates the living from the organizing dead. [600]
Move now, I scraped along the pavement, each letter a drag against the gravity that ignored me. [617]
They reexamined every plan in minutes, abandoning heirlooms, trimming packs, choosing who would ride the first lifts. [634]
Harnesses bit into bark as whole groves swung, carried by grav-cranes toward arches that still held. [650]
Mara led the elders along the safest span, humming old protest songs to drown the planetary groan. [667]
Ryo directed cranes by radio, voice breaking, promising that if the nebula truly meant respite, it would wait. [685]
The first arch collapsed behind them, spilling empty ladders into the violet updraft like discarded vertebrae. [701]
No one screamed; they were too busy counting who had made it across, calling each name like a prayer. [720]
When the shaking eased, they stood together on the surviving span, orchard and homes intact, bell in shards. [738]
Strangers who had once bartered in silence now held one another, sap and dust streaking their faces. [755]
They could not see me smiling, but I felt their gratitude tangle with grief, a brambled hope sturdy enough to share the weight of a changing sky. [782]</story>
