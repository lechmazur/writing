<story>The harmonic stone skimmer came alone to the canyon of endless echoes at the turn of dusk. [17]
Around him rose towers of bone, jagged vertebrae and ribs fused into pale spires by forgotten pressures. [34]
Each gust drew out a low chord from their hollow cages, as if the canyon tuned itself on his breath. [54]
He laid his satchel on a flat slab and waited for the echoes to settle into something like silence. [73]
Waiting was his first discipline, the foundation of learning to navigate without moving. [86]
In another age the harmonic stone skimmer would have been an ordinary ferryman, casting pebbles to read currents. [104]
Now the rivers had dried, and only sound still flowed. [114]
He was historically reverent, and carried the tools of his forgotten predecessors as careful talismans against his ribs. [132]
From the satchel he drew a stone arrowhead, dark and glossy, its edges nibbled yet unbroken by time. [150]
Someone had shaped it to fly straight and true, but it had never known the air, only burial. [168]
He turned it over in his palm, trying to appraise not its worth but its remembered direction. [185]
A tool, after all, was a sentence the past tried to finish in the future. [200]
He set the arrowhead on the stone beside him and reached for a handful of smooth river pebbles. [218]
No river fed this canyon, but through centuries of layered dust the old beds still whispered their shapes to him. [238]
He chose seven stones, each a different tone when struck, and laid them in a small crescent before the arrowhead. [258]
Above, a flock of bone-white birds turned in a slow gyre between the spires, feathers catching the dying light. [277]
He watched them, breathing with the rhythm of their wings, reading the sky the way others read ink on parchment. [297]
His teachers had shown him how to think through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, and then gone still forever. [320]
The birds wheeled, broke, rejoined, describing invisible currents in the air and in something deeper, a weather of memory. [339]
He closed his eyes and let their collective motion write itself across his inner sight. [354]
Somewhere under the layered dust of his thoughts, a pulse left wandering all his life began to answer. [372]
It was not a heartbeat, exactly, but the memory of one, a rhythm unanchored to flesh or distance. [390]
He had followed that stray pulse from city to salt-flat to ruin, promising it he would one day give it bearings. [411]
Now, in the canyon, it beat in time with the faint tremor of the bone towers, as if testing their patience. [432]
He opened his eyes, picked up the first pebble, and skimmed it along the canyon floor. [448]
The stone danced, kissing rock seven times before coming to rest, each impact sending a note shivering up the walls. [468]
Echoes layered upon echoes, folding back from unseen corridors, a map of sound thickening in the air. [485]
He skimmed the second, the third, each at a different angle, each call answered by a different hollow in the towers. [506]
The birds shifted, their spiral narrowing, their wings tilting as if to follow the echoes threading between the bones. [525]
He watched their changing formation and understood at last that the canyon was teaching him to move his attention, not his feet. [547]
To navigate without moving was to let the world rearrange itself around a still point, and to become that point. [567]
He placed his hand over the arrowhead, not touching it, letting the air between skin and stone hum with the gathered echoes. [589]
Images rose in him, not visions but directions, vectors of forgotten intent straining to reattach themselves to the present. [608]
Someone long dead had stood where he now sat, arrow nocked, breath held, the same pulse wondering which way to go. [629]
The canyon had taken that shot, swallowed it in silence, and left the intention wandering, unspent, for generations. [647]
He understood then that the pulse he carried was not his alone but the residue of countless choices never completed. [667]
Weathered resolve settled over him like dust settling after a storm, patient, persistent, faintly abrasive. [682]
He would not try to spend those pulses in strides or journeys, but in stillness, letting them map themselves around him. [703]
He lowered himself until his spine aligned with a tall rib of bone, the tower humming faintly against his back. [723]
Above, the flock loosened, then stretched into a long river of wings, flowing toward a horizon he would never need to reach. [745]
He closed his eyes and felt the canyon arrange itself in ringing layers, every echo a coordinate, every silence a path. [766]
In that unmoving map, guided by a pulse no longer left wandering, he finally knew where he was. [784]</story>
