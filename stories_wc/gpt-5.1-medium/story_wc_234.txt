<story>I call myself a pocket-sun alchemist, though the guild rolls its eyes at that title. [15]
They prefer my registry name, Lio Kerren, Thermal Microreactor Specialist, as if poetry were a contaminant. [31]
But in the ember nexus at twilight, titles melt and the air listens closer than people do. [48]
The nexus is a basin of slagged stone behind the south furnaces, where discarded heat gathers like migrating birds. [67]
Rusted rails arc above it, sketching iron halos that catch the last light in trembling filaments. [83]
This is where I come when my pocket suns misbehave, when their tiny flares refuse to stabilize in their glass wombs. [104]
I sit cross-legged on the warm stone, instruments scattered around me in what looks like chaos but is really directed spontaneity. [125]
Tonight my favorite microstar flickers inside a reinforced ampoule, golden and sullen, like it knows I have doubts. [143]
Its light splashes against my notes, where numbers scribble into metaphors, trying to assemble a palette of resolve. [161]
If I can tune the reaction properly, these pocket suns could heat drifting habitats, sterilize water, even thaw old grudges. [181]
That is the official proposal, at least, full of diagrams the guild calls scientifically romantic, half equation and half confession. [201]
The unofficial proposal is simply to capture the density of presence that glows between people when they decide not to give up. [223]
I know the exact instant that idea fused, because it was born in the moment a secret is whispered between friends. [244]
Kira and Jash had perched on these same stones months ago, passing a smuggled bottle of vapor gin between them. [264]
I was pretending to recalibrate a temperamental reactor, but really I was listening, greedy for whatever lived beyond their words. [284]
You do not love him, Kira had said, so quietly the gin fizz got louder just to hear. [302]
Jash laughed the way people do when they are trying to revalue their own hearts without breaking them open. [321]
The three of us glowed in the reflected furnace light, small planets in improbable orbits, unwilling to collide. [339]
I remember wanting to bottle that precarious balance, that fragile stubbornness that kept them talking instead of walking away. [358]
Science alone could not hold it, and romance alone could not measure it, so I stitched them together inside my work. [379]
That is how a pocket-sun alchemist gets born: not in a lab, but in overheard courage. [395]
Tonight, though, the nexus has other alchemy planned. [403]
Footsteps scrape the slag slope, and I look up to see Kira balancing a satchel and an expression like cracked glass. [424]
Behind her, Jash hesitates at the rim, haloed by the last band of sun, hands shoved deep into his jacket. [444]
You working, Lio, or worshipping? Kira calls, her voice sliding over the heat shimmer. [458]
Both, I answer, because the line between those has always been a theoretical construct at best. [474]
She drops the satchel beside my notes, and something inside clinks with the deliberate sound of an experiment beginning. [493]
From the padded cloth she unwraps a nautilus shell columella curl, ivory and spiraled, its inner whorl polished to a soft mirror. [515]
It catches the pocket sun's flicker, folding light along its spiral like a decision reconsidered at every turn. [533]
Where did you get this, I ask, though I already suspect contraband or inheritance or both. [549]
Jash finally slides down to us, shoes skidding, and answers before Kira can inhale. [563]
From the decommissioned tidal lab, he says, wincing, like the words taste of rust and possibility. [579]
They were mapping resonance patterns in shells, trying to store signals in the geometry of the columella. [596]
Kira meets my gaze, her eyes steady in the trembling light, and I can feel the experiment uncurling already. [615]
We want you to imprint something on it, she says, something that will travel with us if we leave. [634]
Leave, I echo, as if syllables were a phase change I had not prepared for in my calculations. [652]
Jash looks toward the distant towers, where guild lights twitch like insects trapped behind frosted glass, and nods once. [671]
They want us on the orbital farm-rings, he says, dryly triumphant, and even their gravity wells cannot hold quiet. [690]
You are going, Kira corrects, and I am following, but only if we can bring this place with us somehow. [710]
The shell is a vessel, Lio, she continues, and you are the only one reckless enough to pour the right thing in. [732]
I touch the curl's smooth spine, feeling the faint temperature gradient where fossil and future argue in silence. [750]
The pocket sun pulses behind me, impatient, as if it too wants a say in what gets remembered. [768]
All my equations were meant to send energy outward, but now I begin solving for us, by returning differently. [787]</story>
