<story>The viaduct glowed after the rain, every stone slick with reflections of streetlamps and distant neon. [16]
Time seemed pinned between the drop and the ripple, as if gravity itself were holding its breath. [33]
Lio, the gravity defier, hovered a fingerbreadth above the wet stone railing, soles never quite touching. [49]
Every few seconds he let himself fall, only to drift upward again, a periodically eternal pendulum. [65]
The brightness of the viaduct's new-washed lights was already darkening, shadows thickening in the arches below. [81]
Rainwater still whispered through the drains, carrying city grit and the last shreds of the storm. [97]
Lio was not here for the view; he floated there to conquer the labyrinth of self. [113]
Inside his chest, it felt as if a dozen fractured timelines scraped against one another, each demanding to be real. [133]
He reached into his coat and drew out the ancient clay tablet with runes gouged so deep they cast tiny shadows. [154]
Water beaded on its surface but never quite sank in, as if the fired earth refused to remember the rain. [174]
The tablet, they had told him, was a map of his possible lives, encoded not in symbols but in algorithms. [194]
The runes described a universe that iterated him endlessly through procedural generation, testing new selves like random seeds. [212]
Each time he jumped from a rooftop, wrote a poem, kissed a stranger, another branch of him spun outward. [231]
There were so many branches now that the future looked less like a path and more like a shattering. [250]
The clay tablet hummed faintly in his hands, syncing to the exact hinge of time between decision and consequence. [269]
That hinge was tonight, on this glowing viaduct after rain, between the drop and the ripple. [285]
Lio lifted the tablet to his forehead, feeling grit and grooves bite into his skin. [300]
The first vision hit like vertigo: he saw himself falling under a train, a smear of red and broken electricity. [320]
Then a second: himself older, heavier, still alive but dulled, working night shifts in a windowless room full of blank monitors. [341]
A third: a monastery, bare feet on cold flagstones, his gift for floating traded for a vow never to rise again. [362]
None of them were lies; they were all true in other slices of reality already curling away from him. [381]
The tablet was not showing futures so much as reminding him of debts his other selves had already paid. [400]
To conquer the labyrinth of self, he realized, he would have to retrace the turns those lives had taken without him. [421]
His fingers tightened on the clay, and the viaduct's lights pulsed once, as if acknowledging the decision. [438]
The world tilted; water drops hanging from the railing froze in place, each one a tiny lens of the city. [458]
Within every drop, he saw a different Lio racing outward, the timelines fracturing again and again like glass. [476]
He stepped off the railing, not up or down but sideways, slipping into the narrow seam between the drop and the ripple. [498]
The viaduct dimmed behind him until it was only a line of darkening brightness, a memory of light retreating. [517]
Ahead stretched corridors made of his own past choices, walls shifting as if coded on the fly. [534]
Rooms bloomed and collapsed through procedural generation, conjuring childhood bedrooms, hospital halls, nights on rooftops under cheap beer stars. [553]
Every door he passed contained a version of himself mid-act, frozen at the instant just before regret. [570]
He stopped at one where he was about to push someone he loved away with a joke that cut too deep. [591]
Another showed him signing a contract he had never read; another had him reaching for a ledge and missing. [610]
Retrace, the tablet urged, its runes warming in his palm like coals. [622]
So he stepped into the first room and let the scene unfold, this time staying instead of turning away, listening instead of performing. [645]
In the next corridor the walls shifted, fewer doors now, the maze tightening as some futures quietly extinguished. [663]
Each choice he remade bled through the fractured timelines, sealing cracks here, opening windows there, redistributing pain and mercy. [682]
He understood then that conquering the labyrinth of self did not mean erasing his other lives, but bearing witness to them. [703]
The more he walked, the less he floated; gravity returned in increments, claiming him as the maze simplified. [721]
At last there was only one corridor, leading back toward the faint sound of dripping water and distant traffic. [740]
He emerged onto the viaduct just as the drops began to fall again, the first ripples finally spreading in the puddles. [761]
Lio set the ancient clay tablet with runes on the railing and let it slide into the dark water below. [781]</story>
