<story>The gloom-hill coachman guided his empty carriage down to the harbor, long after passengers had become a memory. [18]
It was after the reef dies, people said, though the years since that season of bleaching were already uncounted. [37]
Where coral cathedrals had once glowed offshore, a flat gray tomb now caught only the weight of the tide. [56]
On the pier they now called the blooming jetty at twilight, he reined in his horses and listened. [74]
Birds gathered along the rusting railings, their silhouettes small strokes of ink against the dim orange sky. [91]
Their calls braided the air, thin and piercing, and he closed his eyes to hear the syntax within. [109]
The gloom-hill coachman spoke dead languages, and the birds trusted him because he never tried to teach them his. [128]
He had once whispered to fading soldiers in the trench hospital, reciting prayers from tongues buried for millennia. [146]
He had preached to barnacled stones in the under-harbor, naming lost species and forgotten treaties. [161]
But these days he mostly conversed with birds, because their grammar held the last accurate map of desire. [179]
I have brought more, he told them now, though the words came out as a series of rising trills. [198]
From beneath the bench of his carriage, he lifted the wooden case that housed his collection of dried seed pods. [218]
Each pod was labeled in a script no one alive could read, not even him, though he spoke their cousins. [238]
The handwriting belonged to a botanist who had loved both war and mercy in impossible proportions. [254]
She had walked the battlefield before it was a harbor, pressing petals into the wounds of the earth. [272]
When shells fell, she mapped the craters, calculating where roots might later cradle shrapnel into harmless stillness. [289]
That was her submerged concord, the peace sunk below explosions, dreaming of germination while men still shouted above. [307]
Before she died, she entrusted the case to the coachman, setting his life on rails she never saw. [325]
Take them where the reef will be, she had said, because her grammar did not distinguish well between future and ruin. [346]
The reef had died, but her instruction still glowed like a coal in the coachman s chest. [363]
So he came each evening to fertilize the scars of the shoreline, guided by the birds and the tides. [382]
He did not scatter the seeds blindly; instead, he asked the birds to show him where hunger nested deepest. [401]
By understanding bird calls, he could hear the invisible contours of the land, the low language of salt and rust. [421]
A keening note from the terns meant the buried ammunition was swelling with seawater beneath them. [437]
A clipped chatter from the sandpipers told of thin soil where roots would tangle and suffocate unless carefully paired. [456]
He translated their warnings into placement, tucking pods into crevices of broken concrete and bomb glass. [472]
Some seeds had spines thin as hair, meant to ride wind over water before anchoring in the cracks of hulls. [492]
Others were heavy and dark, sly with oils that would coax faint poisons out of the soil as they germinated. [512]
All of them were part of the botanist s plan to let a garden reclaim a battlefield without anyone noticing the moment of victory. [536]
He moved along the jetty, the world condensed to the narrow beam of his looping lantern and the vast, listening dark beyond. [558]
That was the sensation of these evenings, a narrow vastness, as if existence had been reduced to a corridor through infinity. [579]
Behind him, the horses waited patiently, their breath drifting up like small ghosts inspecting the resumed business of the world. [599]
Ahead, the dead reef lay hidden beneath the black water, an absence so complete it seemed like a statement. [618]
He wondered whether the polyps had possessed words of their own, and whether any survived, trapped in carbonate echoes. [637]
If they did, he thought the birds might someday carry those syllables inland, dropping them like seeds onto new stone. [657]
The coachman knelt where the pier narrowed and the war had once been fiercest, feeling beneath the planks the quiver of spent metal. [680]
He placed the final pod in a crack there, a modest brown tear-shaped thing that smelled faintly of rain on ash. [701]
For a moment he imagined the battlefield as it would be when the garden finally rose, grasses sheathing bullets, roots knitting helmets into soil, blossoms rewriting the colors of old flags. [732]
The vision felt neither hopeful nor sad, merely accurate, like hearing a word in a dead language and knowing exactly what it means. [755]
He rose, brushed rust from his knees, and whistled to the birds that the night s work was finished. [774]
They answered in a ragged chorus that might, to someone who did not speak their language, have sounded like mere noise over the water. [798]</story>
