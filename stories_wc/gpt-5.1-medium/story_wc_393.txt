<story>The bell above the door chimed with a tired little dignity as Elias entered. [14]
The antique music box repair shop always greeted him with a vibrant hush, gears whispering beneath glass. [31]
Rain dragged gray veils across the street outside, turning the window into a wavering mirror of his hesitation. [49]
He paused there, penitentiary chaplain badge still clipped to his belt, though he was off duty. [65]
Inside, clocks ticked in layered rhythms, a chorus of tiny hammers and springs keeping contradictory time. [81]
Behind the counter, Mara lifted her magnifying visor and smiled, always aptly deliberate, never hurried. [96]
You look like you brought more than a broken melody this time, Chaplain, she said. [111]
Elias removed the small cloth-wrapped object from his coat and set it on the counter. [126]
The wrap came away to reveal a clockwork heart, brass ribs curved around a hollow center. [142]
Tiny cogs were exposed, some bright, some blackened, one tooth visibly bent out of place. [157]
I need a second opinion, Elias said, surprising himself with how quickly the words escaped. [172]
Mara arched an eyebrow. [176]
From me, or from the machinery, she asked. [184]
Both, if you have the time, he answered. [192]
He watched her fingers, scarred and steady, as she rotated the heart and listened to its faint ticking. [210]
The sound stuttered, catching on something invisible, like a confession snagging on a word never quite spoken. [227]
Where did you get this, she said, no casual curiosity in her tone now. [241]
From a man named Jonah Carr, inmate 34821, Elias replied. [251]
He gave it to me yesterday, said it was all he had left of his father. [267]
He wanted me to decide if he deserved forgiveness before his parole hearing. [280]
Mara leaned closer, the shop light burnishing the brass into the color of late autumn leaves. [296]
And what did you decide, she asked. [303]
I told him forgiveness was not really mine to give or withhold, Elias said. [317]
But my silence answered him anyway. [323]
In the calm before realization, right there in his cell, I let the moment pass. [338]
He pressed this heart into my hand and said, Maybe you should talk to someone who fixes broken things for a living. [360]
So here I am, getting a second opinion from the only mechanic I trust. [374]
Mara exhaled slowly, the sound merging with the ticking around them until it was impossible to tell machine from breath. [394]
You want me to judge him based on his clockwork, she said. [406]
I want to know if I deserve to stand in front of that parole board tomorrow, Elias said, or if I am just another cog locking him in place. [435]
Mara set the heart on a velvet pad and adjusted her lamp, angling it so the light cut across the brass. [456]
By the way light breaks through storm clouds, she finally murmured, that is how you tell what is inside something. [476]
The heart was tarnished in places but not corroded; the bent tooth looked like damage, not design. [493]
Someone struck it hard, probably in anger, but they also wound it carefully afterward. [507]
What does that say to you, she asked. [515]
That remorse is not the same as repair, Elias answered, yet both leave marks. [529]
He remembered Jonah's trembling hands, the man who had killed in a drunken panic and spent twenty years replaying one night. [550]
I think he wants to turn an apology into action, Elias said slowly, like a man translating himself. [568]
You do too, Mara replied. [573]
Otherwise you would not be here, hovering among old lullabies and broken waltzes. [586]
The shop held them in its layered ticking, a vibrant hush echoing the silence of cells and chapel alike. [605]
What are you really asking, Elias, she said, and this time her voice was not a mechanic's but a friend's. [625]
I am asking if a man can deserve a future he did not guard in his past, Elias said. [644]
And whether I, who listened to his confession and flinched away from decision, deserve to guide that choice. [662]
Mara picked up a slender file and began to straighten the bent tooth, each motion small and exact. [680]
Sometimes, she said, our second opinions are not about the patient but about ourselves. [694]
You are aptly deliberate, Elias; you wait for certainty, but this heart will never tick in perfect agreement with you. [714]
It only offers proof that damage and care can live in the same small space. [729]
She set the tool down and nudged the key, letting the mechanism wind to a fuller tension. [746]
The clockwork heart began to beat in a steadier rhythm, not flawless, but undeniably alive. [761]
Take it back to him, Mara said, and tell the board what you hear in it. [777]
Not what you think he deserves, but what you are willing to stand beside when the doors open. [795]</story>
