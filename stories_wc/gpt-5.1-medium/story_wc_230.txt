<story>The ravine had once been a riverbed, but now it held a hanging orchard swaying over emptiness. [17]
Storms had chewed its walls into pale scars, and cables bit into the rock like nervous ligaments supporting the trees. [37]
After the empathy virus, this was where the village sent the ones who could not stop feeling everything. [55]
I came as a rational truffle forager, contracted to map the fungal lace that threaded the orchard roots. [73]
They said the truffles absorbed residual moods, that if we harvested them carefully we could lighten the air. [91]
They also wanted me because I was involuntarily truthful, incapable of speaking a false sentence for longer than a breath. [111]
After the virus, that kind of defect made people feel safer. [122]
I wanted something more than safety, though; I wanted to cultivate psychological safety, the sort that let you risk being known. [143]
The village elders gave me an antique glass eye as payment in advance, wrapped in velvet that smelled of salt and dust. [165]
It was cloudy at the center, like a storm occluding the pupil. [177]
If I turned it just so, the inner film seemed to shift and then to occlude the tiny reflection of my own face. [200]
They told me it was a smuggled relic from before the virus, carried across quarantined borders inside a shipment of hollowed walnuts. [222]
No one seemed to know what it did, only that it had to stay in the ravine, watching. [240]
The only instructions I received were a leather satchel of discredited textbooks on contagion and empathy, margins filled with rumors of impossible cures. [263]
The elders wanted me to work through rumored cures in discredited textbooks, as though decoding a forgotten recipe for gentleness. [283]
My hut hung from the lowest cable, a small wooden seed pod swaying over the void, reached by a ladder that hummed when the wind rose. [309]
At night the storms crawled along the ravine, slow and electric, and the orchard groaned like a dreaming animal. [328]
The others in the ravine slept in similar pods, the so called oversensitive, whose nervous systems had never quite recovered from the infection. [351]
The virus had not killed many; it had merely excoriated the thin skin between selves, leaving people porous, flooded by the moods of strangers. [375]
Before I caught it, I had been good at finding hidden things, at weighing odds, at building clean hypotheses; afterward, I could not lie, even to spare someone. [403]
The truth sheared out of me in sharp strips, often kinder than silence, but not always. [419]
On the second week, a woman climbed down the ladder with the glass eye cupped in both hands. [437]
Her name was Risa, and the virus had left her hearing the nearby hearts of people as chords, unresolved and aching. [458]
She placed the eye on my table and asked, very calmly, whether it saw more than we did. [476]
Because I could not lie, I told her that when I slept, I dreamed from the eye outward, as if the ravine were a socket and the sky a lid. [506]
I said that sometimes I woke with the taste of iron in my mouth and the feeling of having watched everyone at once, from nowhere. [531]
Risa considered this, listening to whatever music my heart made, and then she laughed in a way that sounded like something cracking and then letting light through. [558]
She said the village believed the relic could focus our collective empathy, make it bearable, but only if someone honest mapped the truffle network first. [583]
The fungi, according to the textbooks, were supposed to act as buffers, occluding the most violent currents of feeling the way tree roots broke the force of water. [611]
But the textbooks were discredited, I said, and my honesty made the words feel like stones between us. [629]
Risa touched the leather covers as if they were warm animals and said that sometimes discredited meant only that the truth had arrived too early. [654]
So we worked together, tracing the mycelial veins that stitched tree to tree, human to human, mood to mood. [673]
Every time I felt a surge of fear from a neighboring pod, I spoke it aloud, unable to occlude or soften it, and Risa answered with the chord she heard in return. [705]
The work was clumsy and exposed, a praxis of fractured grace, but slowly the orchard felt less haunted and more like a choir tuning itself. [730]
On the night the biggest storm came, the glass eye cleared for the first time, its clouded core becoming transparently ordinary. [751]
Nothing mystical shone from it; instead, we realized it was only ever a mirror we had agreed to fear, a focal point for terror that could now disperse. [779]
In its plain surface we practiced seeing one another and surviving the sight. [792]</story>
