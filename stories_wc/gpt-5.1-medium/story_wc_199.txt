<story>The ashen skyborne arbor drifted above the valley like a remembered promise that refused to land. [16]
Inside its hollowed trunk, an orderly seed sorter named Lio arranged kernels and husks with obsessive care. [33]
Each seed sat in a groove carved from heartwood, aligned by color, weight, and the angle of forgotten winds. [52]
Lio worked here During the hush where past meets prophecy, when even distant thunder held its breath. [69]
In that pause, leaves loosened from the arbor's upper boughs and spiraled inward like slow green comets. [86]
Lio's purpose was simple to name and difficult to bear To decode the message in falling leaves. [103]
Regional folklore claimed the arbor sprouted from a question the valley once asked the moon and never retracted. [121]
Ever since, the tree had been dropping answers a leaf at a time, cryptic and stubborn as seeds in drought. [141]
Other sorters had tried before Lio, leaving behind tangled charts and brittle theories, but the pattern resisted them. [159]
They said whoever truly read the leaves emerges transformed always, unable to return unchanged to the valley below. [177]
Lio did not fear transformation; Lio feared misunderstanding, the quiet horror of almost but not quite knowing. [194]
As each leaf floated down, Lio would prod it gently with a twig, guiding it toward a waiting niche. [213]
Some leaves arrived curled like sleeping fists, others flat and veined with silver or faintly luminous spores. [230]
Lio sorted them not just by shape, but by the stories they whispered when pressed between fingers. [247]
Each evening, after the last leaf settled, Lio practiced building tiny monuments to forgotten things along the inner bark. [266]
An abandoned proverb became a spiral of husks; a never-sent letter became a column of mottled stems. [283]
Lio's favorite monument honored a word once spoken between two strangers on a bridge then lost to shyness. [301]
For that, Lio used a single seed held upright by a crescent of bark, eternally almost falling. [318]
One hush-dim hour, a new kind of leaf descended, heavier than the air yet drifting with unhurried certainty. [336]
It shimmered with a pale sheen, and at its center clung a moonstone cabochon dust speck. [352]
The mote seemed laughably small, yet the leaf trembled around it as though bearing an entire winter. [369]
Lio caught the leaf on a palm, feeling a coolness seep up the arm, mossy delight tingling in veins. [388]
The tree's inner rings hummed, and a voice like distant rain sifted through Lio's thoughts without asking permission. [406]
You sort seeds yet never plant them, the voice observed, as if dusting off an old, amused curiosity. [424]
Lio swallowed, then answered aloud, because answers felt sturdier when anchored to breath instead of thought alone. [441]
I sort to listen, Lio said, and I listen To decode the message in falling leaves. [457]
Planting would mean deciding the answer before I truly hear the question the valley keeps asking. [473]
The moonstone speck winked, catching light that was not there, and the leaf unfolded into a veined map. [491]
On it, Lio saw the valley's rivers braided with ghost streams, paths of water that belonged to neither past nor future. [512]
Tiny sigils indicated where the monuments along the trunk echoed those hidden currents, translating absence into shape. [529]
You have been building an alphabet without knowing its sound, the voice said, almost tender now. [545]
The monuments to forgotten things are how the valley remembers what it has not yet experienced. [561]
Lio felt the weight of that, a soft tidal pull, and realized the pattern had never been purely botanical. [580]
Every sorted seed, every prodded leaf, every precarious sculpture of husks, all were punctuation in a larger sentence. [598]
The arbor creaked, branches bending to encircle Lio, and the air thickened with the smell of wet stone and sap. [618]
Will you plant them, the voice asked, not as command but as invitation to step from listening into speaking. [637]
Lio looked at the leaf-map, at the moonstone cabochon dust speck pulsing like a tiny, patient heart. [654]
If I plant the questions, Lio replied slowly, perhaps the answers will grow where they can be shared. [672]
With hands steady from a lifetime of order, Lio opened the arbor's floor and pressed seeds into its waiting roots. [692]
The sky outside brightened from ash to luminous dusk, and somewhere far below, the valley felt a new story beginning. [712]</story>
