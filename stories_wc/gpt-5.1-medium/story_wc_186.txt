<story>After the collapse of civilization, the beacon-tower custodian watched the dusk bleed through the cracks of the glass humming pavilion. [20]
He had no name anyone still living could remember, so he answered to Keeper when the wind bothered to speak. [40]
In the center of the pavilion, on a pedestal of fused bone and slag, lay a broken crystal prism that once bent the lighthouse beam into a lattice over the dead sea. [72]
Inside its fractured heart rested a shard of hush, a sliver of silence so dense it kept the old world from rotting entirely into noise. [97]
Keeper was retrocognitively blessed, cursed some would say, for he could stand barefoot on any forgotten threshold and feel backwards along the footprints of time. [122]
When he touched the prism, histories whispered through him in lightless flashes, but never the one he needed most. [141]
He meant to rekindle the beacon not with oil or flame but by tracking star paths across the ashen sky until they aligned again with the prism's wounded faces. [170]
He told himself, and the empty sea below, that he did this to prove that coincidences have meaning, that the scattered remnants of pattern were not just the twitching of a dead universe. [203]
It was a thistle-blown hope, drifting, snagging on rusted railings and the ribs of long-dead ships, yet it was the only hope he had not already outlived. [230]
The glass humming pavilion had grown around the ancient lighthouse like a salt flower, its panes vibrating softly with the radio ghosts that still howled along the horizon. [258]
Each night, Keeper climbed the spiral of corroded steps, carrying the broken prism in both hands as if it were a sleeping animal. [281]
At the top, he set it on the cracked pedestal and pressed his forehead to the nearest pane, letting his retrocognition drift outward like a net cast backward along star paths long vanished from human charts. [317]
He saw the sky as it had been before the collapse, mosaicked with satellites and glutted with signals, constellations over-written by adverts and emergency codes. [342]
Somewhere inside that vanished glare had been a pattern, the one that first woke the shard of hush, teaching it to drink the clamor and leave a corridor of quiet where messages could pass untouched. [377]
When the satellites fell and the oceans burned, the prism cracked, and the hush inside, startled, swallowed an entire decade's worth of unsent pleas. [401]
Keeper had been one of those voices, a child then, mouthing coordinates into a dead radio, begging some nameless tower to send his parents back from the evacuation ships. [430]
He knew, with the stubborn certainty that kept him breathing, that his plea was trapped somewhere in that shard, preserved like an insect in ambered quiet. [456]
If he could coax the stars into the same geometry, if he could persuade coincidence to repeat itself, then the hush might release that single message, and the universe would have confessed to caring at least once. [493]
For years he charted the faint pricks that still troubled the night, tracking star paths on scraps of sailcloth and flensed plastic, his diagrams spidering across the walls beneath peeling hazard glyphs. [525]
Most nights the prism stayed cold under his hands, the hush a sealed throat, his retrocognition looping through the same exhausted memories like a tethered beast. [551]
On the eleventh year after the last recorded storm, a stray comet grazed the horizon, an ice flare that no surviving almanac had predicted. [575]
Keeper felt the coincidence strike his chest like a bell; something uncharted had chosen to appear exactly when his oil was nearly gone and his knees had begun to mutiny. [605]
He hauled the prism to the highest deck, glass and iron singing under the comet's pale roar, and he redrew his charts in his head, fitting this new light into the old destinies. [638]
Closing his eyes, he let his retrocognition latch onto the comet's path, then slide backwards along its invisible ellipse, brushing through centuries of dark, until it tangled with the remembered lattice of satellites and war-bright flares. [674]
The points snapped together in his mind with the clean inevitability of a closing box, and the shards of the prism, for the first time in decades, caught the starlight in a single obedient beam. [709]
The shard of hush trembled, then cracked like thawing ice, and a child's voice spilled out, thin but whole, reciting coordinates and a promise to wait until the lights came back. [740]
Keeper recognized the child as himself, and though the universe did not answer with thunder or angels, the fact that the words had survived their impossible journey was enough to rekindle him, to prove that even broken prisms and stray comets could conspire toward a fragile, thistle-blown meaning.
