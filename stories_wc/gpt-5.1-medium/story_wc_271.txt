<story>The arboretum perched on the seaside cliff had been quiet for years after the last lighthouse keeper left. [18]
Salt fog slid through glass corridors, blurring the labels on rare ferns and the memorial plaques to lost sailors. [37]
Far below, waves chewed at the black rocks with a patience that sounded almost like grinding teeth. [54]
Mariam sat on a wrought iron bench beneath an old fig tree, notebook balanced on her knees, listening. [72]
She had come because her therapist said to find a place that felt safe but not unreal. [89]
Real was the ocean roar and the cold metal beneath her fingers and the ache in her left shoulder. [108]
Safe was the numbered wristband in her pocket and the knowledge that here, drones were forbidden airspace. [125]
Her quietly talented hands, once known in the neighborhood for bridal henna so intricate it looked like lace, now trembled when she uncapped a pen. [150]
The tremor came from memory, and memory came uninvited, like smoke under a door. [164]
On the bench beside her lay a crumpled photograph, edges softened by salt and the press of her thumb. [183]
In it, she stood under strings of bare bulbs in a courtyard washed with jasmine scent, henna still drying on her wrists, a bride mid-laugh. [208]
Behind her, cousins and aunties blurred into a soft crowd the camera could not keep still long enough to capture. [228]
The streak in the sky, the shriek, the white light opening like a second sun, none of that was in the photograph, though her body recalled it in perfect detail. [258]
Sometimes a gull would dive overhead and she would freeze, muscles locking, heart racing into a sprint her feet never joined. [279]
Her therapist had called these somatic markers, the body leaving little flags where the mind did not want to walk. [299]
Each tightening muscle, each cold ripple under her skin was, he said, a signal more honest than any story she could tell. [321]
So she sat in the arboretum, listening to the leaves, and tried to learn a different language from her own nerves. [342]
A docent in a frayed navy vest shuffled by and nodded, then disappeared into the orchids with a watering can that dripped a thin trail. [367]
Almost no one came this far out since the shipping lanes moved and the lighthouse went dark, its keeper the last to leave the cliff. [392]
The locals said the plants missed the blinking light, had grown toward it for decades, and now leaned toward the empty air out of habit. [417]
Mariam understood how a body could reach for something that was gone and still not entirely believe in its disappearance. [437]
She traced the veins of a fig leaf, following the branching lines the way she used to trace the hands of brides, mapping futures in curls and dots. [465]
Once, she had believed that skill could shield people, that beauty made of ink and intention formed a thin armor against chaos. [487]
That belief died with most of the wedding party, buried under rubble and official statements about collateral damage. [505]
What survived was stubborn, smaller, like a pearl sanded down by tide and grit until only its core remained. [524]
Her therapist called that core resilience, but alone here, listening to the glass roof ping as the fog condensed, she renamed it a pearl of stillness. [550]
It was not hope exactly, and not denial, but a dense, quiet center where she could stand and not be blown away. [572]
From that center, she wanted to anchor optimism in realism, to imagine a future without lying about the wreckage that preceded it. [594]
She wrote in her notebook, the pen scratching faintly under the surf, listing what she knew instead of what she wished. [615]
Drones existed, and sometimes they mistook weddings for enemy gatherings, and the people under them were not abstractions. [633]
Her shoulder would always seize when metal shrieked overhead, and her sleep would always be stitched with sirens and dust. [653]
And also, sea lavender could grow in the cracks of a concrete seawall, and children on the tram still pressed their noses to the glass when the ocean appeared. [682]
Some truths did not cancel each other; they sat side by side like rocks in the tide, both wet, both real. [703]
Mariam folded the photograph along its existing creases, smaller and smaller, until the laughing bride was just a blur of color no wider than her fingernail. [729]
She did not throw it away; instead, she slipped it into the notebook, between pages where ink had begun, timidly, to imagine tomorrow. [752]
Outside, the absent lighthouse cast no beam, yet the path back to the tram was clear enough beneath her steadying feet. [773]
The ocean kept its own counsel, the cliff held, and inside her, the small pearl of stillness did not break. [793]</story>
