<story>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes had never been meant for people like Ira. [16]
He was a shadow-laced peacekeeper, calmly intuitive, trained to hear arguments before they were spoken. [31]
Yet the orchard wanted dreams, not negotiations, and dreams made his training unreliable. [44]
Each bare-limbed tree rose from a ring of fog, lanterns swinging like low moons between branches. [60]
Below, the ice floes shifted and sighed against one another, a slow grinding choir beneath his boots. [77]
The Keepers had sent Ira here because the ordinary treaties were failing, and the world hated anomalies. [94]
This place, they whispered, birthed a courageous anomaly that refused every command but compassion. [108]
If Ira could not bring it into the accords, they implied, nothing would stand between the nations and open war. [128]
Ira found the anomaly inside the lighthouse, where the stairwell widened into a strange shop smelling of dust and stormwater. [148]
Mirrors leaned against every curved wall, mismatched frames scratched and silvering, a vintage store balanced impossibly above the sea. [167]
On the counter lay a broken crystal ball fragment, its edges dulled but its center still holding a restless light. [187]
The anomaly wore the shape of a young woman whose shadow moved a heartbeat out of sync with her body. [207]
She held the fragment between thumb and forefinger like a coin she was considering spending. [222]
You are late, peacekeeper, she said, and the mirrors repeated her mouth silently, a chorus of unsaid things. [240]
Ira let the accusation rest between them during the weighted breath before reply. [253]
Silence, he had learned, often told him more than testimony, and this silence tasted like fear wrapped in stubbornness. [272]
You called for mediation, he said at last, though we both know you do not believe in our laws. [291]
I called because your Keepers are sharpening their knives, she replied, and because I refuse to become their excuse. [310]
She flipped the crystal fragment, and the light inside it flickered through several futures at once. [326]
In one mirror, Ira saw the orchard burned for military timber; in another, the floes cracked under refugee ships. [345]
In a third, he watched himself give the signal that made both tragedies inevitable. [359]
The images did not feel like prophecy so much as pressure, choices kneeling on his ribs. [375]
You do that often, Ira said softly, mapping fear onto vision. [386]
The anomaly smiled, and her shadow stayed very still. [395]
And you, peacekeeper, map empathy onto action, or so your instructors brag; show me how that works when every option is cruelty. [417]
He should have argued, but his calmly intuitive mind walked instead through the mirrors, letting each glass offer him a different angle. [439]
In one reflection he saw the Keepers as saviors; in another, as colonizers with polished signatures instead of chains. [458]
In all of them, the anomaly remained what she was: a courageous anomaly, refusing to bend into any projected role. [478]
The mirrors showed him not just outcomes but the threads of feeling that led there, anger spun into policy, grief hardened into borderlines. [501]
If I write the accord they want, he said slowly, your orchard becomes symbol and spoil, never sanctuary. [519]
If I refuse, they will still come, only louder and less supervised. [531]
What do you want, truly, beyond not being used, he asked, though he suspected she had not let herself know. [551]
Her fingers tightened around the fragment, and hairline cracks ran deeper through the glass. [565]
I want the uprooted to have somewhere that is not conquest or exile, she said, voice turning raw; I want this place to choose itself. [590]
The words hung in the mirrors, written across every reflection of her, Ira, and the restless sea below. [608]
Maybe, he thought, the treaty itself was the broken crystal, showing only jagged futures because it had been shattered by fear. [629]
What if we reconstitute the accord, he said, not to own this orchard but to recognize it as a deciding voice. [650]
The Keepers will never agree to that, she said, yet her shadow leaned a little closer. [666]
They will, Ira answered, if they believe the alternative is losing moral claim entirely; help me show them. [684]
He lifted the fragment from her hand, feeling the barely contained futures shiver across his skin. [700]
One by one, he held it up to the vintage store mirrors, letting each reflection catch and alter the light. [720]
In some panes, he envisioned settlements governed jointly by displaced peoples and rooted ones; in others, tribunals where trees and tides had standing. [743]
He watched which visions made the anomaly's shoulders ease and which tightened her jaw, cataloging not only outcomes but reactions. [763]
It was an old discipline among peacekeepers, using other minds as mirrors, but he had never taken it this literally. [783]
Slowly, via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, he reconstituted the accord into something the orchard chose. [799]</story>
