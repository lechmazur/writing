<story>The first time I heard a color die, it was blue. [11]
Blue sounds like glass breathing out, a thin sigh nobody else notices. [23]
Down here, in the sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks, there is only blue. [37]
It sloshes over my skin when the current moves the broken panes. [49]
I came to this drowned place because I design hearing aids for the living. [63]
But my real work is listening for the sound of trust breaking. [75]
No microphone has ever caught it, so I had to change the root design. [89]
I rewired the prototypes to mirror my own anomaly, the way I hear colors faintly. [104]
Every shade above the waves has a timbre, but down here, the palette is ruined. [119]
Still, the ruined have their music. [125]
The greenhouse once grew apples and pears, their branches training toward the glass ceiling. [139]
Now skeletal trunks grope through dim water, leaves replaced by algae and patient barnacles. [153]
Around us, shipwrecks tilt like failed promises, their ribs blooming rusted anemones. [165]
The whole scene is a battered marvel, half graveyard, half cathedral. [176]
In the orchard center stands the ashen forge under aurora, my impossible workshop. [189]
Ashen, because its stone drank a fire that went out centuries ago. [201]
Aurora, because the leaking chemical light from broken hulls gathers there like wounded dawn. [215]
The forge does not burn; it hums. [222]
Inside, I assemble devices that can hear what bodies refuse to admit. [234]
To make them sensitive enough, I must imprint each with a specific absence. [247]
You cannot record betrayal directly, I decided, so you circle it by collecting absences. [261]
Every dive, I harvest what is no longer here. [270]
There is the silence where crew once cursed, the gap where fruit once dropped. [284]
I pass the microphones through cobwebbed cabins and tangled rigging, asking them to remember nothing. [299]
The recordings play back as textures in my head, each absence a different bruise of color. [315]
Some are yellow, papery and soft; others are deep red, clotted and hot. [328]
None yet match the record in my bones, the sound I am chasing. [341]
It happened in a kitchen, years before the sea rose. [351]
Steam on the windows, dishes stacked, my partner talking with the careful calm of demolition. [366]
They had already decided to leave, but only then were they detonating the bridge. [380]
I remember the click of the door latch, the tap shutting off midstream. [393]
Underneath, something tore that had no name, bright green turned suddenly mute. [405]
That was the sound of trust breaking, and I have chased its echo ever since. [420]
If I can capture it, I think, I can build a device to stop it. [435]
Not by rewinding time, but by warning a wearer when words are about to fracture. [450]
The biology will not care about my engineering, yet both are written while cells divide. [465]
Every growing moment in the body stores pressure, and pressure always seeks a crack. [479]
So I design tiny guardians for those cracks, little metallic orchards in the ear. [493]
Down here, among drowned branches, I test them against the planet's oldest fractures. [506]
A hull split by greed sounds different from a hull split by storm rage. [520]
Trust can break for reasons just as varied, I remind myself, exhaling bubbles into the green. [536]
My latest prototype sits in the ashen forge, petals of metal curled like a listening flower. [552]
I feed it the absences I collected today, letting the aurora's poisoned colors wash over us both. [569]
The device trembles, then releases a sound thin as a hairline fracture. [581]
I close my eyes and listen, fingers pressed to the forge's cooled stone. [594]
There it is, almost: a pale green, turning, deciding, leaning toward silence but not yet gone. [610]
The memory surges back, not as pain but as structure, showing me where the crack began. [626]
I realize I never heard only one sound in that kitchen; I heard two overlapping. [641]
The first was my partner breaking trust with me; the second was me breaking trust with myself. [658]
I had known for months and refused to speak, letting our shared colors rot in place. [674]
No device can change that, but perhaps it can notice the rot earlier for someone else. [690]
The forge hum rises, joined by the soft ticking of distant, unseen organisms dividing. [704]
While cells divide out there in the dark, new chances are being minted without our consent. [720]
I open the prototype, adjust a filament, and let the broken blue swirl through it again. [736]
This time, when it sings, the note carries both betrayals at once and does not shatter me. [753]
It simply lays a new layer of memory over the old, thin but steady, like lacquer on a cracked instrument. [773]
Maybe that is all trust ever was, I think, a battered marvel continually repaired by those who choose to hear. [793]</story>
