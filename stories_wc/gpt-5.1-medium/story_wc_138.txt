<story>The first crack in space sounded like hushed thunder rolling behind the walls of my prismatic escondite. [17]
I would have ignored it, as I ignore most things after twelve thousand years, but the light changed color. [36]
The beams that usually braided themselves into patient rainbows began to knot and flare like anxious serpents. [53]
Even for a bored immortal, that was new. [61]
I rose from the stone bench grown smooth by centuries of my inaction and let my awareness slip outward. [80]
When you are dimensionally aware, walls are at best polite suggestions. [91]
The chamber unfolded into overlapping geometries, each plane humming with spectrum and reluctance. [104]
Above, beyond, beside, the solar storm snarled around the planet like a crown of bent nails. [120]
Its charged particles slammed into the upper air, shaking every magnetic field my escondite depended on for secrecy. [138]
The light in the room stuttered, then bent sharply toward the far wall, as though gravity had grown ideas. [157]
On my worktable, the cursed amulet fragment woke up. [166]
For six hundred years it had lain there, a dull crescent of blackened metal, whispering nothing I cared to hear. [186]
Now it vibrated so violently that tiny sparks leapt between it and the surrounding tools, sketching frantic constellations. [204]
I pinned it with two fingers, feeling its tug not on my skin but on nearby possibilities. [221]
The fragment had been born from an act of spatial mutiny, forged when a dying sorcerer tried to resign from reality. [242]
Instead of letting go, the world had shattered him and kept the shard that still disagreed. [258]
I kept it for the same reason I kept my escondite wedged between dimensions, like a bookmark in a closed book. [279]
I am tired of pages that never turn. [287]
I want to discover what happens after goodbye. [295]
The fragment trembled harder, aligning itself with the storm raging above, its hunger tuned through magnetic fields I could almost taste. [316]
Lines of force spilled into the room, visible to me as glassy threads sliding along angles no mortal eye could resolve. [337]
They wrapped the fragment, then me, knitting us into a circuit the storm insisted on closing. [353]
Information flooded in, not as images or words, but as rearrangements of distance. [366]
Corners rebelled, corridors shortened, and the escondite twisted like a ship mutinying against its own hull. [382]
The space that had once obeyed my designs now conspired with the storm and the amulet, tilting its loyalty elsewhere. [402]
It was intrigue on a geometric scale, rooms and vectors plotting behind my back. [416]
The fragment spoke at last, its voice a pressure against every surface of my mind. [431]
You linger, it said without sound, because you mistake endlessness for safety. [443]
I answered as I always do when artifacts get philosophical, with silence long enough to feel like contempt. [461]
Outside, the solar storm roared louder, yet in here it was still that same hushed thunder, as if respect bound the noise. [483]
The space around me buckled inward, folding the distance between my present and every goodbye I had refused to say. [503]
I saw the faces I had turned away from when time first lost its edge, all the mortals who loved me enough to leave. [527]
Their exits had been doors I locked behind them, declaring the hallway endless, convincing myself no final room waited ahead. [547]
The fragment pulsed, and the magnetic fields snapped into a new configuration, aligning my escondite with some remote, unlit coordinate. [567]
Here is what happens after goodbye, the shard pressed, sharing images made of orientations instead of light. [584]
Spaces once occupied by bodies did not go blank; they stretched, like skin after weight is lifted, then slowly remembered elasticity. [605]
Paths curved differently, choosing shorter lines between hearts now separated, while conversations bruised the air for a while before smoothing. [625]
Goodbye, the fragment showed me, was never an annihilation but a rearrangement of nearness, a lawful mischief of distance. [644]
Those who left me had not fallen into void; they had stepped sideways into neighborhoods of space my stubbornness refused to visit. [666]
To follow, I would need to permit a final distance, to allow my own coordinates to untie from immortality. [685]
The storm outside began to wane, its pressure easing as the fields released their feral alignment. [701]
My prismatic walls steadied, colors settling back into orderly rainbows, but now every hue looked like a question. [719]
The cursed fragment lay quiet in my palm, yet its disagreement with reality had infected me. [735]
I set it at the center of the room and began to redraw the boundaries of my escondite, loosening its anchors. [756]
There would be another storm, another chance to let space mutiny not just around me, but with me. [774]
When it came, I thought, I might finally learn how to say goodbye and mean not an ending, but a direction. [795]</story>
