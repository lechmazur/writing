<story>The first time I drifted into the nebula garden, the stars were already wilting. [14]
Petals of ionized dust fell in slow spirals, each one a fading echo of some forgotten transit. [31]
I am called an otherworldly sentimentalist by those who still bother to name things, because I collect moments the way others collect weapons or debts. [56]
In this place, where radiance approximates infinity yet never quite arrives, there is little use for either. [73]
Instead, I tend the drifting blossoms of gas and ice, pruning trajectories, coaxing eruptions into delicate, translucent blooms. [91]
Their colors are wrong for human eyes, tuned to frequencies that would rattle bone, yet here they hang with a troubling serenity. [113]
Across the quiet sigh of falling petals, time moves differently, not in hours but in patterns that repeat and distort like reflections in curved glass. [138]
Generational patterns, I call them, though no children are born here and no bodies decay. [153]
Instead, suns bud from the mist, flare into brief authority, then shed their layers like old regrets, feeding the next wave of trembling seeds. [177]
I watch them all and I remember. [184]
Memory is my only real tool, though the archivists insisted I carry a calculating machine gear, cold and brass, as proof that I once believed in totals. [211]
It hangs at my wrist on a wire of frozen time, ticking softly whenever a cycle closes and another begins. [231]
Each tick is a sonar pinging through the luminous fog, echoing off unseen futures and returning with possibilities slippery as light. [252]
I listen, not with ears, but with the ache behind my ribs where a heart might have existed in a more literal body. [275]
Once, long before I volunteered for this exile, I lived among people who mistook burning for illumination. [292]
Every lesson was a flame, every tradition a brand pressed into the mind, until our houses shone like furnaces and our stories left scars. [316]
They called that wisdom, those generational patterns passed down like torches, but I only remember the smoke. [333]
So when the Nebular Council sought a caretaker, someone whose motivation was to share light without using fire, I signed my name and did not look back. [360]
Here, light grows slowly, diffused through hydrogen veils, folded and refolded by gravity until it learns gentleness. [377]
I guide the young stars into stable dances, nudging with invisible hands so no orbit cuts too deep, no flare devours its siblings. [400]
Yet even in this curated peace, troubling serenity pools in the shadows, for I cannot prune what grows inside the garden of myself. [423]
Sometimes, when the petals fall thick and the gear at my wrist shivers violently, I glimpse familiar constellations forming in the distance, shapes I thought I had escaped. [451]
A star swallowing its smaller companion out of fear of being alone; a cluster exiling a dim member to preserve their symmetry; a spiral arm curling back to strike itself. [481]
The sonar pings feel heavier then, like questions I forgot to ask when I still had a voice and a face and a family that knew them. [508]
I wonder whether tending this place is enough to break the old equations, or whether I am merely extending them into a quieter register. [532]
Generations of stars will bloom and fade under my watch; their total number approximates infinity, yet each loss lands with the sharpness of a specific name. [558]
I press the calculating gear between my fingers, feeling its teeth bite gently into whatever passes for skin, and I think of my grandmother teaching me to extinguish candles by hand. [589]
She would pinch the wick until the flame surrendered, then hold up her soot-stained fingertips and say that some lights must be touched if they are to be trusted. [618]
Out here, there are no wicks, no matches, no breath to blow, only fields of ion fire arranging themselves into flowers and the long patience of my watch. [646]
Still, I reach out, closing luminous filaments before they flare to cruelty, spreading dim warmth to wandering comets, teaching each newborn sun that shining is not the same as burning. [676]
Perhaps, if I do this long enough, if I keep listening to the echoes of my own sonar pinging through the nebula garden, the pattern will shift. [703]
Perhaps some distant child of a distant star will inherit a sky where light arrives without wounds, and my exile will have been more than a sentimental calculation. [731]
Until then, I drift among the falling petals and the humming gears of invisible machines, an otherworldly sentimentalist pruning the cosmos, tender and troubled, quiet and unafraid. [758]</story>
