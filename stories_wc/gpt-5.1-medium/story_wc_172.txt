<story>The first time I saw the salt flat from the helicopter, it looked like a broken mirror laid beneath a pitiless sky. [22]
Thunder muttered somewhere beyond the horizon, too far to be threatening, close enough to suggest that rain still existed for other, luckier geographies. [45]
I told the pilot to circle once more, because I wanted to see if the river had died completely. [64]
From above, the old channel was a pale scar writhing through the crystalline crust, a ghost vein in a bleached hand. [85]
It had taken five years and a staggeringly expensive lattice of dams, diversions, and legal subterfuge to starve it. [104]
Five years to manufacture a drought so perfect it felt like an act of God instead of the project of a single man with an overabundance of money and an understocked conscience. [136]
My board called it water optimization. [142]
The villagers downriver, whose wells coughed up dust and salt, had less polite phrasing. [156]
I had funded token relief shipments, built a glossy desalination plant for the city that had stolen their river, and endowed a chair in hydrological ethics at the university. [185]
Philanthropy as misdirection, generosity as alibi; no one ever accused me of being boring. [199]
On paper I was an amoral philanthropist, the kind whose name shines from hospital wings while smaller, quieter names vanish from maps. [221]
In private, I carried a shoebox lined with velvet wherever I traveled, and inside that shoebox rested an egg the color of old porcelain, traced with hairline cracks like faint blue lightning. [253]
It was the last known egg of the azure sandrail, an extinct bird that had once haunted these flats in flocks so thick they were said to dim the sun. [283]
A secretly sentimental man would have called it a relic; I called it an investment in absolution. [300]
What I never told my lawyers or my lovers was that I could still hear them, sometimes, the birds that no longer existed. [323]
In the lull between distant thunderclaps, when the city noise fell away and power plants caught their mechanical breath, a high, thin chorus would rise in my ears, bright and impossible. [354]
At first I thought it was guilt, some neurological feedback of buried conscience, but guilt implies a belief in the possibility of repair, and I have never been that optimistic. [384]
Instead I chose to interpret the sound as an echo trapped in the architecture of the world, rebounding from collapsed habitats and abandoned nests, refusing to go silent simply because the throats that made it had been erased. [422]
I decided, in a moment I would later describe as strategy and privately know as weakness, that my legacy would be to preserve that echo at any cost. [450]
That decision led me, inevitably, to the salt flat I had helped create. [463]
The drought had drained the river and left behind miles of cracked clay now shrouded in a thin, glittering crust, as if the earth had wept itself dry and the tears had crystalized. [496]
From the air, the cracks spidered in every direction, senseless as madness. [508]
But when I stepped down onto the salt and the helicopter shrank to a complaining speck behind me, perspective changed. [528]
The fissures beneath my boots converged and separated, lines thickening, narrowing, intersecting to form something that was not quite random. [548]
If you stared long enough, the dried riverbeds became cartography, a map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds themselves, guiding anyone stubborn or foolish enough to follow. [575]
I followed. [577]
The air tasted of metal, of old coins and new batteries, and the sky pressed down like a hand considering whether to comfort or smother. [602]
The thunder on the horizon hesitated, a growl lodged in the throat of clouds that refused commitment. [619]
In that suspended hush, the chorus arrived again, a ring of invisible wings beating just beyond hearing. [636]
The cracked map drew me toward its center, to a shallow basin where the salt thinned to gray mud. [655]
There I knelt, suit trousers whitening at the knees, and opened the shoebox with hands that shook. [672]
The egg lay in its hollow like a captured moon, fragile and ludicrous in a landscape built on my ruthlessness. [692]
No court could have compelled this gesture, no shareholder report would mention it, yet my chest ached with something dangerously close to devotion. [715]
I had taken the river; I had ended their migrations; I had edited them out of existence. [732]
Now I intended, arrogantly, to give something back, not life, not bodies, but continuity of sound. [748]
I lifted the egg, felt the faint warmth leached from my own skin, and released it onto the waiting mud, trusting the cracked map and the lingering echo to know what to do with my offering. [784]</story>
