<story>The first thing tourists noticed about Nereus Raft was that the carnival never stopped. [14]
The second thing, if they stayed long enough, was the exhaustion in the locals who kept it spinning. [32]
I made a living as a culture shock absorber, guiding newcomers through the noise and neon tides. [49]
On the residency form my job title was written as liaison, but my friends called me Jae, the orderly intuitive. [69]
Our home was a perpetual carnival afloat on a raft city, lashed together from tankers, pontoons, and the skeletons of drowned suburbs. [91]
This was before privatization, before the investors in mirrored yachts circled us like slow, hungry sharks. [107]
Everyone knew the tide was turning, and my quiet obsession was to navigate gentrification without letting the raft crack apart. [127]
It started with the foundation stone chip, a fleck of basalt my grandfather said came from the first anchor block driven into the seafloor. [151]
He had chipped it loose the day the engineers declared the raft city stable, pocketing it like a secret exit. [171]
Now it hung on a cord against my chest, warm as if remembering all the feet that had danced above it. [192]
When the Council asked me to help reorganize the maze of districts, I felt the chip grow hotter, as if warning me about my dual allegiance. [218]
Half my heart belonged to Carnival Row, the original barges of street vendors and acrobats who had raised me, and half to the Planning Office that paid my rent and fed my data habit. [252]
The Council wanted clear zoning maps, evacuation routes, and rent tiers, something legible to investors looking in from satellite feeds. [272]
The Carnies wanted the opposite: a labyrinth so wild no title deed could find purchase. [287]
I thought, naively, that I could chart a middle passage. [297]
So I did what any culture shock absorber would do: I listened, quietly, then began to translate their fears into patterns, sketches, and, eventually, into plans. [323]
At night, when the ferris wheels dimmed to a sleepy glow, I met Lilo under the rusted roller coaster. [342]
Lilo was the raft's most notorious muralist, already a legend for smuggling evacuation maps into her flood dragons and union slogans into her shooting stars. [367]
She laughed when I told her the Council wanted order. [377]
Order is just a story someone gets paid to tell, she said, dipping her brush into phosphorescent paint. [395]
Help me tell one that keeps our people here, I answered, feeling the foundation stone chip burn like a second heartbeat. [416]
Our method would be simple and deniable: we would reorganize the city through messages encoded in graffiti art. [434]
Where the Council saw a need for clearer pathways, I saw pressure points where the poor could be pushed out or locked in. [457]
I fed Lilo the data, block by block: which barges were at risk of being sold, which piers were crumbling, where the water pumps failed at high tide. [485]
She turned it into constellations of arrows, color codes, and hidden symbols only the kids and the kitchen crews bothered to learn. [507]
A blue swallow painted on a support beam meant rent hikes were coming; a cracked mask above a stall meant the owner planned to sell his lease to outsiders. [536]
Slowly, the carnival began to lean into the warnings. [545]
Food carts migrated in loose flocks toward barges with stronger moorings; performers formed co-ops to buy the decks beneath their stages before speculators could. [569]
It looked like chaos, but underneath, an order grew, crooked yet deliberate. [581]
Those months tasted of hopeful desperation, every light-strung alley buzzing with rumors of buyouts and counterplans. [597]
Of course, the Council noticed the drift. [604]
In progress meetings, they fingered holographic models showing whole neighborhoods shifting like schools of fish. [619]
Jae, they said, your proposals seem to anticipate these moves perfectly, as if you knew what people would do before they did it. [642]
I shrugged, hiding my racing pulse, and told them any orderly intuitive could read the currents here. [659]
But the hotter the foundation stone chip burned, the more I wondered whether I was guiding the raft or only buying us time before the inevitable. [685]
Privatization documents began to leak, stamped with logos of firms I had never heard of but whose lawyers already owned half the world. [708]
The plans spoke of premium vistas, curated culture corridors, and security upgrades that sounded a lot like gates. [726]
When I showed the pages to Lilo, she did not curse or cry; she just uncapped a new spray can and began sketching a serpent that wrapped around three entire barges. [757]
Its body traced evacuation routes, its eyes pointed toward safe harbors, and in the curl of its tail she hid a question that only I could answer: stay and fight, or help our people slip away before the walls closed in. [798]</story>
