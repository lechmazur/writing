<story>On the edge of the city, where timetables had surrendered to rust, stood a disused railway station overgrown with ivy. [20]
No trains came, but on certain nights the platform filled with people who were technically not supposed to know each other. [41]
They called it the Exchange, because trade sounded too capitalist and gathering sounded too cultish. [56]
The host, if there was one, was an elusive disaster-relief logistician named Mara who insisted she did not exist on any official roster. [79]
Mara appeared whenever some distant flood or fire went wrong in ways spreadsheets could not predict, and then vanished again like a politely closed parentheses. [104]
Between catastrophes, she used the abandoned station as an improvised warehouse for mismatched supplies and mismatched people. [121]
The only rule of the Exchange was that everyone was bound by reciprocity, though nobody could quite agree on what that meant. [143]
Some thought it meant gifts must be returned, others thought it meant stories must be answered, and Mara claimed it meant you stayed to clean up afterwards. [170]
On the night when the story changes, a new arrival stepped off the invisible timetable and onto the cracked platform. [190]
He wore a suit with elbows gone white from leaning on too many desks, and his smile was desperately jocular, like a joke told in a hospital corridor. [218]
Mara met him halfway, stepping over a fern that had colonized a broken tile. [232]
First time here, Kenji. [236]
He blinked, surprised she knew his name, then remembered that invitations to the Exchange traveled through improbable rumor chains that threaded refugee camps, co working spaces, and late night radio call ins. [268]
You are Mara, Kenji said, because in the rumors you were taller. [280]
Tonight I am exactly this height, she replied, which is lucky because the ceiling is very specific. [297]
Kenji carried a small locked case, the size of a lunch box and the weight of a confession. [315]
Mara gestured toward a bench whose wooden slats had been sanded smooth by uncountable waiting. [330]
You said the Exchange could help me find the cure for loneliness, Kenji began, sitting down carefully, as if the bench might decline the appointment. [355]
Not cure, Mara corrected, lowering herself beside him, because loneliness is not a rash; it is more like gravity. [374]
But we do have an experiment. [380]
She nodded at the case, and the air around them seemed to lean in. [394]
Kenji hesitated, then flipped the latches, revealing a fragment of moon rock wrapped in scorched silk. [410]
The rock was dull and gray, less impressive than the rumors, but it made the ivy tremble as if it heard a far train. [434]
Stolen from a failed museum in a failed state, Kenji said quietly, and traded upward through five wars until it arrived on my harmless little desk. [460]
Every time someone passed it along, they swore the same oath: I will not keep it for myself. [478]
Bound by reciprocity, Mara murmured, touching the silk with the respectful irreverence of a street priest. [494]
If I cured my own loneliness with it, Kenji said, the chain would break. [508]
So I brought it here. [513]
Mara smiled, the kind of smile that apologized before anything bad happened. [525]
This station has been collecting unfinished chains for years, she said, pointing to shelves where mismatched objects sat like stalled prayers. [546]
A guitar missing two strings, a server full of unread emails, vials of vaccines that expired the week peace was declared. [567]
We use them to catalyze experiments in connection, in risk, in the art of not hoarding miracles. [584]
And if the experiment fails, Kenji asked, what happens to the moon. [596]
Then it goes back into circulation, Mara said, because nothing this lonely should stay in one place. [613]
They carried the rock to the center of the platform, where the cracked concrete formed a crude map of broken rivers. [634]
People drifted closer, drawn by the particular silence that gathers around important experiments and train delays. [650]
Mara raised her hands for attention, her voice slipping into its usual tone of polite anarchy, as if she were about to announce both a bake sale and a revolution. [680]
Friends, strangers, statistically improbable acquaintances, she called, tonight we attempt something rude to physics and reasonable to the heart. [699]
Kenji will hold this piece of moon, and each of you will tell him one true thing you would never post online. [721]
In return, he will tell you the truest thing he knows about logistics, which is secretly the truest thing he knows about love. [744]
This seemed fair, and also ridiculous, which was how the Exchange signaled consent. [757]
One by one they stepped forward, confessing secret kindnesses, petty cruelties, and the exact moments when their lives had tilted without anybody else noticing. [781]
Kenji listened, heavier with every truth, until the loneliness shifted from singular to shared. [795]</story>
