<story>The sea beat a slow pulse against the lighthouse as Elias set down his easel in the forgotten library. [19]
Once the most sought-after portrait artist in the city, he now felt like a smudge someone had tried and failed to erase. [41]
The daylight that slipped through the narrow windows was thin and salt-stained, but it still painted the dust with a luminescent ache. [63]
The library was where he came when the walls closed in, when faces on his canvases threatened to step out and accuse him of seeing them too clearly. [91]
On the central table lay the broken tarot card box he had found washed up on the rocks below, its lid warped, its hinges twisted like something that had drowned and tried to remember its shape. [127]
The cards themselves were scattered between philosophy tomes and tide charts, their images scalloped with rust-colored mildew. [144]
He had been rearranging them for days, hoping their fractured symbols would explain why his reality felt so fragmented, as if each hour had slipped into a different deck. [173]
Was it the accident that took his lover, or the commissions that turned every grief-stricken client into a mirror, or the quiet knowledge that he painted people better than he ever touched them, he wondered, though he knew no one would answer such questions? [217]
Why did he keep asking rhetorical questions, he asked himself, when even the sea had grown tired of replying in waves? [238]
Sometimes the circular walls of the lighthouse seemed to tilt, shelves sliding a few inches to the left while the lantern room above shuddered, and he would blink, certain that reality had spun on a hidden pivot. [275]
It was not madness, he told himself, but a fragmented reality, pieces misfiled like books left under the wrong letter, every misplacement a silent emergency. [300]
He had come here today with a resolve sharper than any charcoal stick, driven by an urge to descend into necessary darkness instead of always painting around its edges. [329]
If light could not mend him, perhaps he could redesign himself by studying what the shadows erased. [346]
He believed, in the obstinate way only the broken do, that somewhere in these stacks lay a method for doing so by untangling threads others had knotted into fate and history. [377]
He rummaged among worm-eaten atlases until he found an unmarked volume whose spine glowed faintly, and inside he discovered diagrams of constellations stitched to portraits with inked lines like trailing threads. [408]
In the margin, a hand long dead had noted that the self can be redrawn when images are rearranged in the order of the tides, and he thought of the broken tarot card box waiting like a cracked heart on the table. [450]
He carried the scattered cards back, laying them out as if composing a group portrait of everyone he had ever failed. [471]
Here was the Tower, waterlogged and peeling, here the Lovers with one face washed blank, here Death with a lighthouse sketched where the scythe should have been. [498]
What if these were not fortunes but borrowed faces, he wondered, and what if every portrait he had painted had only been another card in a deck he did not understand? [529]
A tremor slid through the stone, gentle at first, then tightening, and the round room felt smaller, as though the walls truly were closing in to hear his thoughts. [558]
He saw, briefly, the face of his lost lover reflected in the window glass, not as he had died but as Elias had once painted him, all kind eyes and careful shadows, and threads seemed to run from that reflection to every card on the table. [604]
He realized the deck had been broken not by the sea but by time, and that its redesign depended on him willing to reassign each image. [630]
So he worked by untangling threads between memory and ink, pairing the Tower with the hospital room, the Lovers with an empty bed, Death with his own blank canvas. [659]
As the spread shifted, the air thickened, and the fragmented reality that had gnawed at him began to align, shards sliding together with an audible hush. [685]
He dimmed the single bulb above the table until the room was almost dark, keeping only the lantern stairwell lit, because to finish he would have to descend into necessary darkness and trust his hands. [720]
Down the spiral he went, each step echoing like a brushstroke, and as he descended the library above seemed to loosen, its shelves sighing, its windows widening to admit a deeper blue. [752]
At the base, where old oil drums and forgotten lenses slept, he understood that the portraits he would paint next were not of clients but of possible selves, each one a card returning to its box. [788]
Would it hurt less, he wondered, to live divided yet shining. [799]</story>
