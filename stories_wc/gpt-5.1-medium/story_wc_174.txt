<story>The dome had been silent for years before we turned it into a school for troubling stories. [17]
Once it tracked approaching bombers, a decommissioned radar dome crouched now like a blind eye above the town. [35]
I arrived as the resident calligrapher, supposedly urbane enough to teach elegance to whatever ghosts signed up. [52]
On the night everything shifted, it was in the hush left behind by a heated argument about truth. [70]
The documentary students had shouted themselves hoarse over whether you could ever film suffering without secretly feeding on it. [89]
I had watched from the mezzanine walkway, uncommonly serene, because ink dries fastest when people below are on fire. [108]
Mostly I was there to explore ethical storytelling, to see whether letters and lines could lean away from harm. [127]
For that night I carried the campfire story stick, a carved length of ash that marked whoever must speak next. [147]
We passed it around during seminars instead of microphones, a rustic scepter that forced wandering monologues to arrive somewhere. [166]
Now the dome hummed with quiet like meteor hush, the kind of stillness that follows when trajectories barely miss. [185]
By day I led workshops on negative space, but my real curriculum happened off campus, through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars. [207]
There the locals drank cheap beer while paper silhouettes acted out revised newsreels of our town, every omission made painfully visible. [228]
A few students had discovered my side practice and accused me of manipulation, of turning real people into shadows for applause. [249]
Their anger had lit the earlier argument, which burned hot and sudden, then left everyone blinking at the smoke of their certainties. [271]
When the shouting ended, half-lit epiphanies hovered over the group, glow worms of insight that refused to land on anyone. [291]
Everyone drifted out except Lily and Marcus, whose unanswered questions scratched at the room like branches against a window. [310]
Lily filmed protests; Marcus wrote grants; both believed stories should march in straight lines toward justice, never sideways. [328]
They stood below me on the concrete floor, watching as I set the campfire story stick across the safety rail. [348]
You think you can stay clean up there, Lily said, voice ragged, while your puppets do the dirty work. [367]
I think clean is a myth, I answered, keeping my breathing slow, matching the patient rotation of the dormant radar dish above. [389]
Stories stain, yes, but we can choose what patterns the stain reveals. [401]
Marcus rubbed his forehead as if smearing away someone else's fingerprints. [412]
If harm is inevitable, he asked, why not quit, why not lock the dome and let silence tell itself? [431]
Because silence is the cruelest author I know, I said. [441]
It keeps every power structure exactly as it is, and then lies about having taken no position. [458]
The dome groaned softly as night wind found its seams, a retired sentinel remembering how it once tracked incoming fire. [478]
Maybe the dish still listened, I thought, hoping it might catch our words and reverse their worst trajectories. [496]
I had not told the students that my puppet shows were built from my own failures, each shadow a reversed confession. [517]
Years ago I filmed a grieving family for a prizewinning short, then watched their private sorrow become festival wallpaper. [536]
The applause felt like rain on someone else's drought. [545]
So I began performing in bars where no one cared about prestige, letting cardboard stand in for whoever I had once exploited. [567]
There I could test whether a story could expose its own cruelty as it unfolded, whether laughter could be a kind of warning siren. [591]
I lifted the campfire story stick and held it over the mezzanine like a lightning rod that had forgotten thunder. [611]
Tonight, I said, we practice another way. [618]
You will tell the story of our argument from my perspective, and I will tell it from yours. [636]
Whoever misrepresents the other loses, but the only judge is the feeling in your own stomach. [652]
Meteor hush thickened; the world outside the dome fell away until only our shifting outlines moved across the curved walls. [672]
Lily took the stick first; her voice shook, but she rebuilt me with a care that made my throat ache. [692]
In her telling I was not detached but scared, holding myself apart so I would not contaminate my own principles. [712]
Marcus followed, drawing himself as arrogant, me as hungry for purity, both of us too proud to admit we needed one another's doubt. [735]
When my turn came, I let the stick rest on my palms until it grew heavy with the warmth of their attempts. [757]
I spoke of my arrogance, of their righteousness, of the half-lit epiphanies that now, finally, dared to land among us. [777]
Outside, the retired radar dome listened, and for once our stories chose not to escape but to orbit together. [796]</story>
