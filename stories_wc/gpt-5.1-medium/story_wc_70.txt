<story>The evening after the citywide blackout tasted like nectar dusk, thick and slow over the abandoned toll bridge. [18]
Marla, the candid toll keeper who was involuntarily truthful, sat alone in her glass booth. [33]
Beyond the railings the city crouched in darkness, its towers blind, its drone beehives silent above the rooftops. [51]
Only the distant lightning collection tower still flickered, drinking storm charge into its ribs like a lonely lighthouse. [69]
In her lap rested the lacquer box from the lost-and-found drawer, its black surface catching the last orange light. [88]
She had kept it for years, she told herself, to preserve wonder in routine, to keep boredom from calcifying. [107]
Because she was cursed with honesty, even her excuses arrived naked and small, shivering under the fluorescent buzz. [125]
The bridge had been closed after the blackout, but Marla could not make herself leave her post. [142]
Here, where strangers once rolled up with their coins and secrets, her truth felt useful, almost medicinal. [159]
Now only the wind visited, carrying rumors of drone beehive failure, of misfired charges and cascading code that had gutted the grid. [181]
The official notice claimed a temporary fault, but the words itched her tongue; they were not the truth. [199]
She saw the boy before she heard his steps, a thin silhouette climbing the bridge from the dark city side. [219]
He carried a matchbox between his fingers as if afraid it might burn him even unopened. [235]
"Are you the truth woman?" he asked, stopping just outside the cone of her booth's failing light. [252]
"I am a toll keeper," she said automatically, and then the rest tumbled out, "and I am involuntarily truthful." [271]
The boy nodded as though this confirmed a calculation. [280]
"Then this is for you," he said, holding up the matchbox containing a cryptic riddle scrawled in tiny blue letters. [300]
"Granddad said somebody like you would have to read it, somebody who cannot hide the answer when it hurts." [319]
Marla's fingers trembled as she slid the matchbox open, the tiny rasp loud as a spark in the hollow night. [339]
Inside, instead of matches, lay a tightly folded strip of receipt paper, warm from his palm, ink already smudging. [358]
Marla unfolded it and read aloud, because she could not help herself: "What hums like a hive, drinks the sky like rain, and forgets that fire was once a story?" [388]
The boy watched her lips, not the words, and whispered, "Do you know what it means?" [404]
She felt the answer slide up her throat, unstoppable, a tide of images: the lightning collection tower, the drone beehives, the blackout. [426]
"It is the city," she said, the words falling like coins in a steel tray, "our machines that hum like bees, drink lightning from clouds, and call it ordinary until it devours us." [459]
The boy swallowed and nodded, as if he had feared a different answer, and said, "Granddad built the first tower to catch lightning." [482]
"He turned drones into bees to feed steel flowers, but he said everyone forgot to be amazed, so he broke the hive." [504]
Marla stared past him to the darkened skyline and understood: the drone beehive failure was not an accident but a lesson. [525]
Duty prickled at her, the old reflex to report, to categorize, yet another voice rose, quieter, wanting to preserve wonder in routine. [547]
"What do you need from me?" she asked, though the question already stung with the shape of its truthful answer. [567]
"Granddad is up in the tower," the boy said, pointing to the pulse on the horizon, "and he wired things so the city wakes only if somebody like you says out loud that it is worth waking." [604]
Her throat tightened; involuntary truth could not be postponed, only shaped, and for the first time she envied liars their delay. [625]
She thought of morning commuters sharing quiet thermoses, of children counting bolts in the railing, of old women tossing crumbs to data-cleaning pigeons that no longer came. [652]
"The city is worth waking," she said, feeling each word strike the air with the careful sweetness of poured nectar dusk, "but only if it remembers to be astonished by its own thunder." [685]
Somewhere across the river the lightning collection tower flared white, then settled into a steady glow, and above them the dormant drones rose like cautious fireflies. [711]
The boy smiled in the new half-light as sirens and laughter drifted faintly back, while Marla slipped the emptied matchbox and its riddle into the lacquer box, a small secret toll she would keep collecting every evening the bridge opened again. [752]</story>
