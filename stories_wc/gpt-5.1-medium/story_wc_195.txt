<story>The knight arrived at midnight, long after the last bells had fallen silent. [13]
He moved with the careful hush of someone used to armor, yet wearing none. [27]
With his cloak pulled high, he seemed not heroic but a withdrawn knight exiled from legend. [43]
Before him rose the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night, its glass veins breathing frost. [59]
Lanterns inside glowed like bottled comets, their light unable to reach the moonless sky. [73]
He had come, he told himself, to take inventory of abandoned experiments and forgotten fruit. [88]
In truth, he had come to capture the shape of possibility before it slipped forever. [103]
The caretaker awaited him at the threshold, a woman whose eyes held constellations as small, steady wounds. [120]
Her name was Mira, and every movement she made felt factually mystical, like proof disguised as rumor. [137]
You are late, Sir Calder, she said, her breath rising pale in the warm darkness. [152]
Time moves strangely here, he answered, and I preferred to arrive as reality shifts. [166]
Mira regarded him as though measuring which parts of him still belonged to gravity. [180]
Then she placed something brittle and folded into his gauntleted hand. [191]
It was an abandoned marionette theater program, its paper yellowed, its ink bruised into violet dusk. [207]
On the cover, a tiny knight of string bowed before an orchard made of stars. [222]
Calder traced the illustration, feeling the tug of threads that no longer existed. [235]
We used to stage the cosmos here, Mira said, puppets mapping what the sky refused to say. [252]
Children came, nobles came, outlaws came, and for an hour their beliefs were jointed wood. [267]
Why give this to me, Calder asked, folding the program until the knight seemed to unsnap into fragments. [285]
Because you no longer know who pulls your strings, Mira replied. [296]
And because the orchard remembers what your kingdom has ordered you to forget. [309]
They entered the greenhouse, doors sighing shut behind them like lips parting after a long vow. [325]
Inside, rows of metal trees rose from vats of silver soil, bearing fruit that glowed with internal dawns. [343]
Glass apples hummed softly, pear-shaped flasks whispered, and clusters of gears blossomed where leaves should be. [359]
It was an orchard of experiments, each fruit an equation the kingdom had deemed too dangerous to harvest. [377]
Your king fears possibilities, Mira said, moving between branches that chimed when her sleeves brushed them. [393]
So he sends a withdrawn knight to catalog what he secretly wishes to taste. [407]
Calder bristled, then stilled, feeling his old vows like rust beneath his skin. [420]
My duty is to the realm, he said, though the words felt like someone elses lines. [436]
Mira stopped beside a tree whose branches held masks carved from fogged crystal. [449]
Here, she whispered, is where your duty ends and your choice begins. [461]
She lifted one mask, and its interior shimmered with scenes like trapped possibilities. [474]
He saw himself casting down his sword, or crowning himself traitor king, or walking nameless into exile. [491]
To capture the shape of possibility, you must first admit your life has more than one outline, Mira said. [510]
That is not treason, Calder replied, but confusion. [518]
Treason comes later, when confusion hardens into a murmured allegiance you dare not speak aloud. [533]
The greenhouse lights dimmed, and a wind rose from nowhere, smelling of rain that had never fallen. [550]
Across the orchard, fruits began to spin slowly, tracing invisible diagrams in the air. [564]
The metal trunks rang like iron chimes, and Calder felt the world tilt, as reality shifts around a question. [583]
He thought of the king, of battlefields slick with certainty, of villages erased to prove a point. [600]
He thought of the marionette knight bowing to an orchard of stars, strings vanishing into dark. [616]
What happens, he asked, if I choose none of these masks. [627]
Mira smiled, and in that smile was shivering bliss, like someone stepping barefoot onto new snow. [643]
Then you become the first thing this orchard has ever grown that cannot be predicted, she said. [660]
But unpredictability demands a price. [665]
The lights flickered again, and Calder realized the price was already written across his life. [680]
Every command obeyed, every fear swallowed, every quiet moment when he had longed to step aside. [696]
They were not loyalty, he saw now, but a choreography, carried out through forgotten patterns he had mistaken for virtue. [716]
His allegiance had never truly belonged to the king but to the idea of being needed. [732]
He looked at Mira, at the orchard, at the theater program still trembling in his gauntlet. [748]
I will stay, he said finally, voice barely more than breath, but I will not serve. [764]
Mira bowed, not as subject to knight, but as gardener to the seed that has chosen its own cracking. [783]
Outside, the kingdom slept, unaware that in an endless night the future had just unsnapped its strings. [800]</story>
