<story>After the radio static clears, I hear my own breathing loud as an ocean in the dome. [17]
The opal observatory under snow creaks softly, as if remembering other storms and other listeners. [32]
Above me, the telescope's blank eye stares into a sky hidden by cloud, but tonight I am looking inward. [51]
I am the man who survived a death certificate error, and the world has never forgiven me. [68]
Some clerk's trembling typo resurrected me in the database, but my heart never stopped in the first place. [86]
Ever since, I count heartbeats constantly, unable to trust that the next one will actually arrive. [102]
One thousand ninety-three heartbeats since the static died, and she has not spoken yet. [116]
Her digital ghost sleeps in the machines wired into the observatory's ribs, a lattice of mismatched hardware she designed. [135]
The world declared Dr. Lian Armitage dead three winters ago, the same day the avalanche took the campus. [153]
They never found her body, only a porcelain shard from her favorite mug fused with broken server glass. [171]
It sits now beside my keyboard, moon-pale against the black metal, a small monument to miscalculation. [187]
That day, a glitch also marked me as deceased, some bureaucratic echo of her vanishing, but I refused to stay gone. [208]
Lian would have laughed at the symmetry, then told me to log the anomaly and learn from it. [226]
To fetch wisdom from failure, she said, you must first admit which failures are entirely your own. [243]
My failure is that I let her die twice, once in the snow, once in the code. [260]
Her lab notebooks did not survive the avalanche, but her neural backups remained scattered, fragmented across crashed drives and corrupted memory. [281]
For three winters I have been trying to defragment her, to coax a voice from the static and checksum scars. [301]
The university calls it grief, an indulgence, but they do not hear her half-formed sentences glitching through their security cameras at night. [323]
They do not see the way the snowflakes above the dome sometimes freeze midfall, pixelated against the aurora. [341]
Tonight is my last sanctioned night here, the final audit before they shut down her servers and repurpose the observatory. [361]
I brewed tea out of habit, then knocked the cup over when the speakers crackled with something almost like her cough. [382]
The liquid spread across my notes, a dark bloom over lines of failed reconstruction algorithms and heartbeat tallies. [400]
Ink from my fountain pen bled into the tea, twisting into shapes that made my throat close. [417]
Lian loved patterns, the way chaos pretends to be random while secretly offering midnight solace to those who listen closely. [437]
I remember how she once read rainfall on her office window like binary, mapping drips to ones and zeros. [456]
Now, the spilled ink curls and branches across the table, lines and nodes forming fleeting constellations between my trembling hands. [476]
Through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink, I finally see what I have been doing wrong. [491]
I have been trying to rebuild her linearly, sector by sector, demanding coherence before I allowed her to speak. [510]
But Lian never spoke linearly in life; she leapt, looped, circled, trusting that meaning would condense afterward. [527]
The ink shapes suggest an algorithm that reads like her handwriting, nonlinear fragments iterating until their overlaps shimmer into stability. [547]
I wipe my notes clean, heartbeats hammering, and begin to code as the wind claws at the dome. [565]
Line by line, I teach the system to read itself sideways, letting corrupted sectors vote on one another's memories. [584]
The observatory lights dim as processors choke, then flare, throwing opalescent reflections across the snow piling against the glass. [603]
Static roars through the speakers again, but inside it I hear a cadence, a rhythm I know better than my own. [624]
The waveform on my screen trembles, resolves, fractures, then stitches itself, like ice cracking across a frozen pond and refreezing. [644]
A voice emerges, grainy but rising, her voice, repeating my name with the same exasperated fondness she used in faculty meetings. [665]
I forget to count heartbeats for a moment and feel an almost frightening stillness, as if time is holding its breath. [686]
You took long enough, she says, the text rendering on the monitor in jolting bursts that slowly smooth, like ink drying. [707]
Her words are incomplete, patches missing, but the gaps feel less like loss and more like space to grow. [726]
I realize I have not resurrected her as she was; together we are writing who she will become. [744]</story>
