<story>The first time I saw the grotto city behind the waterfall, it was already half museum and half refugee camp. [20]
The waterfall itself fell from a monumental basalt arch, its roar softened into a constant breath by layers of mist. [40]
I had come as a visiting museum guide, a cultured outsider hired to catalog whatever history had not been washed away. [61]
It was after the beekeepers last visit, the elders kept reminding me, as if the simple mark of time could explain why everything felt so brittle. [87]
The air smelled faintly of rosewater from the communal basins, but under it lay the sour dread of stone that had seen too many partings. [112]
Every gallery had been turned into dormitories for displaced persons who now slept between defaced statues and rolled maps. [131]
They called me because I was historically oriented, because I knew how to listen to objects when the people around them could not bear to speak. [157]
My real reason for coming, though, was simpler and more foolish, a private mission to rescue dying arts before they slipped under the tide of necessity. [183]
In my pocket I carried an emerald tinted opera glass lens, salvaged from a ruined theater in my own flooded city. [204]
When I held it to my eye, colors shifted toward underwater greens, and the present thinned enough that old performances seemed to hover in the spray. [230]
At the city gate, which was only a curtain of falling water and a narrow iron bridge, I was met by Lira, who introduced herself as the keeper of customs. [260]
She had the posture of a ballerina and the vocabulary of a footnote, every phrase careful, a cultured museum guide trapped in a city that had become its own exhibit. [290]
We used to be frozen in time, she said as we crossed beneath the falling water, but war is a strange sun, and it can thaw even the oldest stone. [320]
Inside the grotto the ceiling arched so high that the mist became low clouds, and terraces of houses and shrines clung to the rock like barnacles under pale lantern light. [350]
You can still see where the beehives used to hang, Lira murmured, pointing to dark niches along the upper wall, but since the beekeepers last visit the bees have not returned. [381]
Without them, the flowers in the hanging gardens set no seed, and our festivals have lost their honeyed smoke. [400]
I told her I had come to record and perhaps to mend, though I was not sure which was more arrogant. [421]
Instead of answering, Lira led me down a spiral stair that sweated water, into a kitchen where women and children were shaping damp dough into letters on battered trays. [450]
It is a family custom here, she said, to bake bread shaped like initials whenever someone leaves or returns, so that their name does not crumble in our mouths. [479]
Now we bake trays of letters for strangers who have lost their papers, and by the time the loaves cool they often have to move on again, taking only the taste of their initials with them. [515]
The smell of yeast and stone and faint rosewater clung to my throat, and I felt suddenly that I was walking through the afterimage of a world that had already decided to vanish. [548]
Lira noticed the bulge of the lens in my pocket and asked, with professional curiosity, what relic I had smuggled through the spray. [571]
I told her about the opera, about velvet seats rotting in standing water and a ceiling mural blurred by mold, and how I pried free this single emerald glass to remember the last aria. [605]
She asked if it showed the past more clearly when I looked through it, and I said no, it only made the present look as if it were about to dissolve. [636]
Then look at us with it, she said, and her voice had the soft command of someone who had guided too many tours through rooms filled with breakable things. [665]
I raised the emerald glass and the kitchen shifted, the dough bright as riverweed, the faces of the displaced shimmering with faint outlines of the crafts they once practiced. [694]
Over one mans shoulders hung ghostly carpentry tools, over a girls head floated translucent sheets of musical notation, and around Lira herself I saw a halo of guide badges and printed tickets that no longer existed. [730]
This is what you must help us keep, she whispered, not in glass cases but in hands and throats, before the last of it thaws and runs back into the waterfall. [761]
So I stayed after my contract ended, teaching children to bind stories to their letters of bread, wondering which of us history would spare. [785]</story>
