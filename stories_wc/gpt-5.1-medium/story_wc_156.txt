<story>The first time I heard the walls breathe, I was scraping soot from a drowned sun. [16]
By trade I am a mural restorer, but the city calls me vivid. [29]
They say I paint like colors remember their dreams. [38]
That night I was working in the sound wave garden under the old viaduct. [52]
Stone ribs arched over the path, tuned cavities that caught passing noise and gave it back. [68]
In the pause between question and reply, between footstep and echo, the garden listened. [82]
On its longest wall sprawled the mural I had been hired to wake. [95]
Beneath sixty years of grime, figures slept inside figures, a whole city of nested awakenings. [110]
Every arch framed another doorway, every face contained another smaller, staring back from the pupils. [125]
The patron wanted the mural restored to its original clarity; I had agreed for another reason. [141]
I wanted to exchange certainty for curiosity, beginning with my own. [152]
Certainty had ossified in me, a crust like the soot I peeled from the wall. [167]
So I worked methodically playful, following strict grids while letting my wrist improvise along the cracks. [183]
In my pocket I carried a single hobo nickel, its carved face all questions and no name. [200]
A tramp had pressed it into my palm years ago, saying only, Keep this when walls start talking. [218]
Tonight, with the ribs of stone humming faintly, I thought I finally understood. [231]
I set down my scraper, clapped once, and listened to sound climb the arches. [245]
It bounced from cavity to cavity, shedding edges, returning as a soft, questioning chord around me. [261]
Through that reflected sound I felt the garden begin to bewitch the mural and, unavoidably, me. [277]
The world held its breath in the small silence after the fading note and before the distant traffic answered. [296]
One painted eye on the wall flinched, as if waking from a long, gritty sleep. [311]
I stepped closer, heartbeat keeping time with the quiet shiver running through the plaster. [325]
The figure was a woman painted in lapis and tarnished gold, her robe crowded with smaller faces. [342]
Within her pupils another tiny woman stirred, and within that one, a child reached toward the surface. [359]
The stone ribs caught my quickened breath and folded it back as a low, coaxing murmur. [375]
Speak, the mural whispered, though no paint moved, the words slipping between beats of my heart. [391]
What do you know for sure, restorer? [398]
The question hung there, perfectly suspended in the pause between question and reply that seemed to stretch for miles. [417]
All my neat opinions about pigment composition, historical context, and solvent ratios stood up like soldiers, then sat down again. [437]
In their place came an image of the tramp, his eyes laughing and sad as he offered the coin. [456]
I took out the hobo nickel and held it up so the reflected murmur of the garden washed over it. [476]
A bearded profile stared back, hat brim carved into ripples like tiny sound waves frozen midflight. [492]
My reply rose, then hesitated, diverted by the weight of that small, wandering currency of uncertainty. [508]
I know less than I thought, I said at last, and I wish to know less still. [525]
The wall exhaled, and the echo of my words returned changed, like a question wearing my voice. [542]
Through that reflected sound the garden finished its work, bewitching not my will but my arrangements of knowing. [560]
Inside my thoughts, smaller thoughts woke, each containing an even smaller doubt that smiled as it opened its eyes. [579]
On the wall, the woman in lapis lifted her painted hand toward the ribbed ceiling. [594]
Thank you, she said, not aloud but in the rhythm of drip and echo, for unsealing our curiosity. [612]
In return, we keep yours. [617]
As she spoke, the grime loosened in flakes like old convictions, revealing colors that did not match any historic record. [637]
I abandoned the restoration plan and instead followed the hues where they wanted to go, methodically playful still, but now answering to wonder. [660]
The sound wave garden responded, reshaping every cough of traffic and distant siren into chords that rose and fell like breathing. [681]
Soon the whole viaduct district seemed caught in that same pause, humming questions instead of engines. [697]
The hobo nickel grew warm in my palm, its carved traveler forever stepping toward the next unanswered doorway. [715]
I understood then that awakenings were not a ladder but a hall of mirrors, each reflection waking another behind it. [735]
And in the ever-renewing pause between question and reply, I walked on, newly unsure, companioned by their endless, vivid echoes. [755]</story>
