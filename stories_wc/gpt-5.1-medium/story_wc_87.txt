<story>The morning I finally admitted that my life had no north, the tide was already turning at the kayak launch. [20]
Fog clung to the small coastal town like wet wool, and gulls stitched ragged circles above the dark water. [39]
I stood on the cracked concrete ramp, a broken navigator with a plastic paddle, watching expectations collapse like channels on a failing GPS. [62]
The sign behind me said COASTAL KAYAK LAUNCH in cheerful peeling blue, as if enthusiasm could waterproof regret. [80]
Hung around my neck, where other people wore phones or faith, swung my grandfather's astronomical compass in a cloudy brass case. [101]
Its glass was spiderwebbed, its declination ring stiff, but it still outweighed my sense of direction. [117]
Once, I had been paid to find paths, mapping cell tower routes across the state, navigating by utility poles more than by stars. [140]
Every pole had a number and a purpose; every detour had a justification; every missed birthday could be filed under necessary overload. [162]
Utility poles do not remember your promises, but people do, and their silence eventually formed a grid I could not climb. [183]
The backlash of regrets had been slow, then sudden, like a spring tide you think you can outrun until your feet leave the sand. [207]
That morning, my phone buzzed with one last text from Lena, the only person who still bothered to translate my silences. [228]
We are done navigating around you, it read; the kids and I have to gravitate to someone who actually shows up. [249]
The words should have capsized me, but instead I felt weirdly buoyant, merrily melancholic, as if the floor of my life had dropped away and revealed a hidden tidepool. [278]
When expectations collapse, something else has to hold you up, or you learn how far you can fall before it kills you. [300]
I slipped the phone into my dry bag, stepped into the red rental kayak, and let the hull wobble until it found its narrow balance. [325]
The plan, such as it was, involved paddling along the power-company right-of-way that crossed the bay, each pair of utility poles narrowing into a vanishing point ahead. [352]
Even on water, it seemed, I could not stop navigating by utility poles. [365]
I told myself this was efficient, that the straightest line across regret was still a surveyor's line, but the lie tasted like brine. [388]
The fog swallowed the shore quickly, turning houses into rumor and leaving only the faint hum of traffic somewhere beyond the gray. [410]
Out here the utility poles rose from the shallow bay on concrete feet, carrying wires like muted constellations. [428]
I drifted between two pylons, lifted the astronomical compass, and tried to align its stubborn needle with a sky I could not see. [451]
The disk jerked, stuck, and finally settled on a bearing that pointed straight through my chest, as if accusing the heart of magnetic fraud. [475]
Granddad used to say a compass does not care who you meant to be, only where you actually are. [494]
He had died on a survey trip, heart stopping between one steel tower and the next, tape measure still looped at his belt. [517]
My mother called it poetic; my grandmother called it foolish; I had called it inevitable, because men in my family were always more precise with maps than apologies. [545]
Now, bobbing alone in the bay, I felt that inherited inevitability like a current under the hull, tugging me toward the same blank horizon. [569]
I had come out here for one honest thing: to align heart and action at least once, even if the choice was cowardly. [592]
Paddle out until you cannot see shore, then let the water decide, the late-night thought had whispered, sounding suspiciously like surrender dressed as wisdom. [616]
But as the kayak nosed past another pair of poles, I noticed how the barnacles climbed them in crowded spirals, each shell angled slightly toward the faintest light. [644]
Life in the tidal zone, Granddad had said once, survives by knowing that the water both feeds and drowns you, and refusing to pick only one truth. [671]
Maybe flickering faith was still faith; maybe wanting to vanish and wanting to be forgiven could occupy the same body without canceling it. [694]
The backlash of regrets did not lessen, but it changed texture, from a crushing wave to a cold steady rain I could paddle through. [718]
I turned the kayak, awkwardly at first, setting the paddle too deep, letting the bow swing wide until the shore's shadow reappeared as a smudge in the fog. [746]
The astronomical compass thumped against my chest with each stroke, no longer an accusation but a metronome, keeping imperfect time with a heart still undecided. [771]
I did not know who would still be there ashore, but at least I was paddling toward them, not away. [791]</story>
