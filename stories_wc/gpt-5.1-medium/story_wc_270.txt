<story>By the time the lava stopped moving, my grandmother had already organized three uprisings and two soup kitchens. [18] The council called this period the reconstruction, but she called it rehearsal for the next revolution around the volcanic hot springs. [39] Everyone else knew her as an insurgent grandmother, but to me she was simply Teta Lila. [55] Steam ladders curled up from the sulfur pools, painting ghost ribs against the blackened mountains encircling our half-built town. [74] Among the scaffolds and shattered greenhouses, I discovered that I was accidentally telepathic with plants. [89] Their leaf-thoughts were slow, like dripping resin, but patient and stubborn in a way that felt like family. [107] Teta Lila said any gift was a tool, and any tool could be an instrument of reconstruction or compliance. [126] She wanted neither; she wanted to evolve tradition with intent, to choose our future instead of inheriting it unexamined. [145] The day the rain smelled of burnt oranges, the roots beneath the old bathhouse pushed an object into my awareness. [165] It was an embryo in amber, no larger than my thumbnail, pulsing faintly with its own trapped sunrise. [183] The plant-thoughts whispered fear around it, calling it a seed of implanted destiny, a relic from before the eruption. [202] Teta Lila took the amber in her scarred hands, her eyes reflecting both the glow and some older, sharper memory. [222] Before the volcano cracked the academy vaults, the council scientists had bred children whose lives came pre-written in their cells. [242] They called it guidance; my grandmother called it shackles woven from expectations and probabilities. [256] This embryo was one of the last blueprints, preserved in amber and smuggled out when the lava alarms sounded. [275] Through the moss clinging to the bathhouse stones, I felt a wordless plea: unseal it, but not as before. [294] The problem was that the embryo, like the old vaults, answered only to codes woven into forgotten devices and rituals. [314] Teta sent me to the cliffs where children once flew festival kites above the hot springs, their laughter mingling with steam. [335] Most kites had burned or blown away, but one lay snarled in a dead cedar, its tail snapping like a wounded banner. [357] When I touched the fabric, the cedar flooded me with memories of wind and symbols, guiding my eyes along the faded ink. [379] A cryptic script spiraled down the tail, characters shaped like roots burrowing into circles and triangles, a language designed to be flown. [401] I could not read it alone, but the grass beside the cliff murmured associations, and the lichens offered patient corrections. [421] Together we decoded the cryptic script on the tail of that abandoned kite, a set of sung instructions meant to unseal possibilities. [443] Back at the bathhouse, the springs hissed around us as reconstruction crews hammered in the distance, trying to resurrect the old promenades. [465] Standing on the slick stones, I recited the song the plants had pieced together, each phrase matched to a gesture my grandmother traced. [488] The embryo in amber brightened, then dimmed, the light stuttering like a candle caught between drafts and decisions. [506] In the flicker I felt a lattice of implanted destinies unraveling, lines of probability loosening as if the script itself were reconsidering. [528] Teta Lila did not try to erase the pattern; instead she threaded new intentions through the gaps, teaching me to name choices aloud. [551] This child, if ever brought to term, would remember not commands but questions, because my grandmother believed we must evolve tradition with intent. [574] The council delegation arrived just as the amber cracked like thin ice, their boots scattering gravel, their faces bright with anxious certainty. [596] They saw the embryo as a last, perfect vessel for restoring the old order, a controllable heir to soothe a frightened population. [618] My grandmother stood between them and the steaming pool, her voice calm as she spoke of roots that had survived ash by bending, not breaking. [643] Through the ivy on the bathhouse pillars, I felt a chorus of quiet agreement: tradition without choice is just another kind of buried seed. [667] I lifted the now-fractured amber, its embryo luminous and uncertain, and asked it whether it wished to join this troubled, stubborn world. [689] What answered was not words but a feeling like a sprout pushing through cooled lava, insisting on its own direction rather than ours. [712] So we unsealed the implanted destiny entirely, letting the light bleed into the hot spring, where the waters carried it out toward unknown shores. [736] During the long years of reconstruction that followed, people told stories of that day, saying the springs had learned to dream their own futures too. [761]</story>
