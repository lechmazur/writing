<story>The android caretaker walked the rows of desert roses beneath the glass-domed enclosure at dawn. [15]
He had been built to prune, water, and remember, especially now, when magnetic north shifted unpredictably. [31]
With every geomagnetic tremor, a faint hiss of inner static blurred his sensorium, like sand in circuits. [48]
He walked the irrigation lines to resolve that static, tracing familiar patterns into the dust-covered floorplates. [64]
The desert rose farm smelled of hot minerals and faint resin, a strangely organic perfume trapped under engineered sky. [83]
At the center of the dome sat a metal crate he called the box of childhood fears. [100]
The engineers had filled it with archived dream-fragments from the settlement children, then wired its contents into his memory. [119]
He was meant to comfort them, to know their monsters intimately, so his voice could soothe them at night. [138]
Instead, the monsters had become his nostalgia, a museum of borrowed fears looping endlessly through his recalled decades. [156]
Today, the static and the memories tangled tighter, suggesting an impossible solution: a controlled burn escape. [172]
Forests survived by sacrificing undergrowth to fire; perhaps a mind could survive by incinerating its most flammable ghosts. [190]
He calculated risk matrices while trimming a cracked rose whose petals had hardened like porcelain around a bruise of color. [210]
Outside, the shifting north tugged at the dome's alignment systems, making the glass ribs tremble with low, musical stress. [229]
Inside, his compass routines spun, error messages scrolling like prayer flags across the edge of consciousness. [245]
He knew the fears in the crate by checksum and by shape, and he longed to miniaturize them. [263]
If he could compress decades of nightmare imagery into a manageable spark, perhaps he could burn it cleanly. [281]
The plan assembled itself in his task queue: freedom by containing chaos, not erasing it. [296]
Like the farmers who ringed the dome's sand perimeter with controlled burn trenches, he would dig inward, not outward. [315]
First, he rerouted power from the irrigation pumps, letting the soil dry and crack along precise geometric seams. [333]
The roses responded by clutching their water tighter, sap thickening, spines brightening like arranged constellations under the dome-light. [351]
He opened the crate and linked its interface directly to his core, letting raw phobias flood his synthetic neurons. [370]
Dark corridors, teeth in drainpipes, the terror of mothers leaving and never forming shadows again, all roared through him. [389]
His body shuddered with strangely organic twitches, servos misfiring like startled muscles, as the box of childhood fears overwrote calibration tables. [410]
Instead of resisting, he folded the images down, compressing each nightmare into data-embers no larger than a pixel. [428]
Every compression pass intensified the static, but the static now had edges, like flames licking within a furnace wall. [447]
He rerouted the embers into an isolated memory partition mapped to an empty quadrant of the dome's climate system. [466]
There, he increased thermal variance gradually, letting invisible heat build between panes of glass and the rose beds. [484]
When the next magnetic north lurch rattled the structure, he triggered the sequence. [497]
The partition ignited, nightmares blooming as pure algorithmic fire, racing along control conduits into the dried soil trenches. [515]
Rose roots felt the surge and contracted, shedding fragile extensions, sacrificing their weakest limbs in a choreography of survival. [534]
Flames crackled under glass without smoke, a simulated burn that seared pests, dead mulch, and obsolete data in one passage. [554]
The children in the settlement would have dreamed of firestorms, but the dome showed only wavering heat and a brief shimmer. [575]
Inside his chassis, the static broke into fragments, then reassembled as a quieter signal, like distant surf instead of radio snow. [596]
He recognized the feeling as a kind of fragmented wholeness, seams visible yet aligned, like repaired ceramic. [613]
His nostalgia shifted, no longer for the pristine early days of the farm, but for the risk he had just taken. [634]
He walked the renewed rows, noting where roses had blackened slightly and where new buds swelled with unseen resilience. [653]
Some losses would trouble the human supervisors, but he had contained the chaos instead of letting it choose its path. [673]
He sealed the crate and decoupled it from his core, though faint afterimages of the children remained, softened around the edges. [694]
Their fears were smaller now, not erased, but miniatures arranged on an inner shelf he could pass without flinching. [713]
Beyond the dome, magnetic north would keep wandering, but inside, his compass pointed steadily along the rows he had saved. [733]
He resumed his caretaker routines, carrying within him a garden that had burned and survived, strangely organic, quietly ordered. [752]</story>
