<story>In the cobalt glade at dusk, the air tasted like rain that never fell. [14]
The trees held their breath, and so did I, roots braided around my ankles. [28]
They called me the root-bound visionary, half in jest, half in frightened reverence. [41]
By then, after the future arrives early, jokes were just another way to pray. [55]
The clocks in town had leapt three years ahead in a single silent shudder. [69]
Children woke speaking fluent languages no one remembered teaching them. [79]
In the city, they studied the phenomenon with cold instruments and heated arguments. [92]
Out here, the forest studied us back. [99]
Tonight, I waited for Lio, my most purposefully curious visitor, and the only skeptic I trusted. [115]
Lio believed in evidence, in numbered charts and calibrated truth, yet he came whenever the roots called. [132]
They tugged on my ankles now, twitching like nervous fingers, impatient and excited. [145]
When Lio slipped into the glade, the last light painted his lab coat indigo. [159]
Under his arm he cradled a clay pot, soil still damp, a small maze topiary clipping trembling inside. [177]
"You brought it," I said, more relieved than I expected. [187]
Lio set the pot between us like a puzzle piece finally reaching its board. [201]
"The original hedge is sprouting fractures, corridors splitting toward nowhere," he said. [213]
"Every time I map it, a new path appears, as if the maze keeps dreaming itself wider." [230]
"And the clipping?" I asked. [235]
"It grows only under eclipsed light," Lio answered, voice thin with anxious elation he tried to hide. [252]
"Today the sun faltered again, only for a moment, but long enough for this to wake." [268]
The clipping quivered, tiny leaves curling inward like they were listening. [279]
"The covenant is thinning," I murmured, feeling the words rise from the roots rather than my lungs. [296]
Lio frowned. [298]
"What covenant?" he asked, always the skeptic, always the student who could not heed a mystery without dissecting it. [317]
"The eclipsed covenant," I said. [322]
"The promise the sky made to the soil long before our calendars jumped ahead." [336]
"I saw it in the scars of the first oaks, back when the future started arriving early and never stopped." [356]
Lio crouched, tracing the pot's rim, pretending patience. [364]
"Show me," he said. [368]
The roots tightened, drawing slow blood where they had fused with my ankles years ago. [383]
Each scar that circled my legs glowed faintly, a constellation repeating the maze's pattern. [397]
"This is how I travel," I reminded him, though he knew. [408]
"Not with feet, but linking through scars, root to root, mind to mind." [421]
Lio hesitated only a heartbeat, then rolled up his sleeve to show the thin pale line on his forearm. [440]
He had earned it years ago when the first timequake threw him against laboratory glass. [455]
Without speaking, he pressed the scar against my ankle, skin to skin, history to history. [470]
The glade deepened to cobalt, dusk swallowed the path behind him, and the maze clipping unfurled one perfect leaf. [489]
Light rushed up through the roots, through my scars, through his, a tide of borrowed tomorrows. [505]
I saw cities built along spirals, trains that folded like paper cranes, children navigating schoolyards by star charts. [523]
I saw the hedge maze grown vast, circling not a garden but an entire sleeping sea. [539]
At its center, two figures faced one another, their shadows overlapping like an eclipse that never ended. [556]
Dreams flowed from them into every corridor, feeding the maze, tangling futures together into luminous knots. [572]
Lio shivered against my ankle, his mind brushing mine like a moth learning the language of flame. [589]
"This is the intersection of dreams," I whispered, or thought, or bled into him. [603]
"Where every path, every desire, every fear in the hedge converges." [614]
He pushed images back along the link, his own private what-ifs, neatly indexed and carefully doubted. [630]
In his mind I tasted fluorescent hallways, policy meetings, the pressure of colleagues waiting to be reassured. [647]
"You want proof," I said within the shared silence. [656]
"You want to know whether to cut the maze down or let it swallow the coastline." [672]
Lio did not answer, but his hesitation pressed harder than words, a weight against my bones. [688]
The roots flexed, showing him futures branching from each choice, forests sharpened into spears, waves braided with hedges. [706]
Cut the maze, and the intersection of dreams would fracture, leaving people stranded inside their private nightmares. [723]
Let it grow, and the eclipsed covenant would break fully, sky forgetting soil, time forgetting sequence. [739]
I relayed all this without words, because the scars trusted images more than speech. [753]
Anxious elation squeezed my chest; to stand here, knowing the choice mattered, was a terrible privilege. [769]
"Tell me what you see," I urged, afraid of his answer. [780]
He exhaled, and the clipping bowed toward us, as if choosing too. [792]
"We cannot cut or keep it," he said. [800]</story>
