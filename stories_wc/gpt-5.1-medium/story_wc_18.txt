<story>Upon the shimmer of twilight frost, Elias the mirror maker stepped into the ruined orchard district lost in centuries of thick fog. [22]
Ice filmed every blackened branch, turning the dead trees into glass mountains rising out of the vapor that hugged the broken cobbles. [44]
He was firmly grounded in the habit of noticing details, and tonight the fog seemed to breathe a little faster than usual. [66]
That was how runaway dreams behaved when they slipped their sleepers, he had learned, stirring the world as if it were a curtain. [89]
Elias carried, wrapped in wool, the astronomer's broken sextant he had found half buried in a gutter of frozen apple pulp. [110]
Its brass arc was split, the sighting arm bent like a snapped twig, yet the instrument still hummed softly against his palm. [132]
The astronomer, before vanishing into the fog years ago, had sworn the sextant could measure not stars but distances between waking and dream. [155]
Now it was cracked, and because of that crack the dream they once charted had escaped, idling somewhere in the orchards like northern light. [179]
Elias intended to capture that runaway dream, not with nets or cages, but by giving it a new surface in which to settle. [202]
He made mirrors, after all, and mirrors were the slowest, steadiest kind of trap he knew. [218]
At the district's heart he reached the oldest courtyard, where stone basins once fed irrigation channels, now choked with shards of decayed ladders and fruit presses. [244]
The fog pooled there, dense as milk, glittering where twilight frost crusted the edges of every rock and rotted root. [264]
Elias set the broken sextant atop a flat stone and unpacked his tools: sheets of cooled sand-glass, jars of silver dust, a shallow copper bowl. [289]
He had not come to repair the sextant, but to recreate the sky it had once mapped, this time on glass instead of air. [313]
Yet the work required a partner, for dreams resisted solitary hands, and the only ally available was the fog itself. [333]
He breathed out slowly, watching his warmth plume into the cold, and then listened as the orchard district answered with its own faint exhalation. [357]
Through synchronized breathing, he had discovered, the boundaries between body and weather could thin, just enough for intention to pass like a whisper. [380]
He inhaled with the fog's slow surge, exhaled with its retreat, until his chest rose and fell in time with the drifting banks. [403]
The district's silence deepened, as though even the dead trees were holding breath, and the frost on the stones brightened to a faint shimmer. [427]
When he and the fog were breathing as one, Elias lifted the sextant and aligned its broken arc with the dim glow along the horizon. [452]
No stars shone overhead, only the low ceiling of vapor, yet in the instrument's cracked lens tiny constellations began to skitter like trapped frost mites. [477]
They were fragments of the runaway dream, Elias realized, scattered across the air like teeth from a shattered smile. [496]
He laid the first sheet of glass over the copper bowl and breathed onto it; the fog, following his rhythm, breathed too, misting the surface evenly. [522]
With a fingertip dipped in silver dust, he traced each flicker he saw through the sextant onto the damp glass, mapping light to mineral. [546]
The more he worked, the less certain he was where his own reflection ended and the dream's beginning shone, for the mirror drank his features. [571]
His face went pale, then translucent, until only his eyes remained, steady and dark, like anchors dropped through a frozen sea. [592]
He worried, briefly, that he was losing himself, but remembered the feel of cobbles under his boots, the weight of tools on his belt. [616]
He was firmly grounded, he told the fog, not as boast but as promise, and the district seemed to accept this, its frost dimming back to normal. [643]
Slowly the mirror cleared, revealing not his face but a corridor of trees whose branches bent overhead like ribs of blown glass, endless and luminous. [668]
Somewhere down that corridor, a figure ran, leaving ripples in the air with every step, as if the world were water and solid ground only rumor. [694]
The runaway dream, sensing itself observed, turned toward him, and its face was an unfinished version of his own, edges still smudged, eyes wide with curiosity. [720]
Elias pressed his palm flat to the back of the mirror, feeling the chill seep into his bones, and matched his breathing once more to the fog. [747]
This time, as he inhaled, the figure stepped toward him; as he exhaled, it stepped into him, erasing boundaries between orchard and corridor, glass and flesh, dream and maker. [776]
For a heartbeat the ruined district flared like suns on glass mountains, then dimmed, the fog resuming its slow, even drift once more. [799]</story>
