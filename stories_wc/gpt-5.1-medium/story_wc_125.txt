<story>The night I met the drifting roadside poet, the sky above the dunes crackled with the new energy beings. [19]
They shimmered like torn auroras, hovering just beyond the atmosphere, watching as if the world were an experiment. [37]
Down on the old coastal highway, no cars moved; the arrival had short-circuited every engine, silencing the road. [55]
I walked, backpack biting my shoulders, following the cracked asphalt until the land opened into rust-colored hills. [72]
That was where I saw the grotto, a hollow of cooled clay, walls glowing like low embers under starlight. [91]
Moonlight slid over its lip, turning the terra-cotta grotto under starlight into something between a wound and a womb. [110]
Inside, the poet waited cross-legged, as if he had always belonged to that hollow more than to any town. [129]
His coat was the color of dead grass, pockets bulging with notebooks, his eyes busy tracing patterns in the dust. [149]
Beside him lay a frayed coil of rope, fibers silvered with age, smelling faintly of metal and old sweat. [168]
You are late, he said, voice almost cheerful, as though lateness were a small, ethically playful sin against time. [187]
The energy beings stalled the buses, I answered, sliding down the wall opposite him and feeling the clay cool my back. [208]
He nodded, as if that matched some private pattern he had already mapped across the sky. [224]
They always stop the easy roads, he said, so the hard ones stand out. [238]
Only then do we see the choices for what they are. [249]
I asked about the rope because it refused to be background; it glared like a sentence waiting for its verb. [269]
Souvenir, he said. [272]
From when I escaped prison to keep my promise to the stars. [287]
This frayed coil of rope dragged me over the wall while the sirens slept; since then, I owe every night a poem. [309]
I had heard rumors about him, the drifting roadside poet who traded verses for rides and rumors for breakfast. [328]
Some called him mad; others said the energy beings listened closest whenever his voice rose from the shoulder of a highway. [349]
What did the stars promise you in return, I asked. [359]
Not promise, he corrected softly; they posed a question. [368]
Would I rather live safely inside one small moment, or taste how all moments rub against each other? [386]
That is the texture of time, he added, fingers brushing the rope as though it were also part of the answer. [407]
I had come to the hills for the same reason without knowing it: to discover the texture of time after everything changed. [429]
When the energy beings arrived, clocks kept working, but meaning did not; minutes stretched, histories folded, and futures felt suddenly optional. [450]
I laughed, uneasy, and asked why a poet would escape prison rather than simply serve his time and then resume wandering. [471]
Because, he said, prison is not only walls; it is any life where your choices are easy enough to be automatic. [492]
They offered me a deal: inform on a friend and walk free, or keep silent and disappear deep inside a system built to forget me. [517]
Impossible choices, you might call them, but he smiled with that same ethically playful tilt, as though the word impossible were just another rhyme. [541]
I chose a third way: the rope, the wall, and a promise to answer their question in poems instead of testimonies. [562]
He leaned closer, voice lowering until it barely disturbed the dust between us. [575]
Now the experiment has changed; the energy beings are not wardens but witnesses, and they are waiting for us to notice the new rules. [599]
What rules, I asked, though part of me already felt them in the air, like static before lightning. [617]
That the way forward is not decided by answers but by uncovering layers, he replied, drawing circles in the dust with one finger. [640]
Each layer is a choice; peel one back and another waits, thinner, stranger, until you find the place where your fear and your desire share a root. [667]
Outside the grotto, the stalled world flickered in the dim of the energy beings, every city paused on the edge of decision. [689]
He told me they were listening not for prayers or apologies, but for patterns of courage whispered in small human rooms like this one. [713]
My own life unrolled before me then: the safe job waiting in the darkened city, the lover who wanted me unchanged, the secret scholarship to leave them both behind. [742]
For the first time, I understood that my choices were not between good and evil, but between shrinking and expanding the texture of my days. [767]
I asked the poet what he would do in my place, and he only laughed, the sound full of passionate subtlety, no louder than the rustle of the rope. [796]
The choice was mine alone. [798]</story>
