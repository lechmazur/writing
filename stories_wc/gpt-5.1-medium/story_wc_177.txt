<story>The first time the forest spoke, Foresight Hindsight Only mistook it for another dream. [14]
Wind hissed through the vine-draped bunker hidden in a rewilded forest, syllables catching on exposed rebar. [30]
He sat cross-legged on the concrete floor, recording every rustle as if it were prophecy. [45]
For a man who lived in foresight and hindsight only, the present could never be trusted. [61]
The bunker had raised him on schedules, predictions, histories, and warnings, but never on now. [76]
Now was chaos between timelines, the frayed edge where choices rubbed themselves raw. [89]
On the table before him lay the wafer seal, pale and thin as a flake of moon. [106]
Its etched circuits held the last directive of the bunker mind, a command older than his bones. [123]
That directive was decaying, fragmenting like paint on damp walls, and the mind whispered in static. [139]
Each night, the whispers slipped into his sleep, rearranged themselves into scenes, and walked him through possible tomorrows. [157]
The bunker insisted he interpret these dreams, then feed his conclusions back into its failing algorithms. [173]
This was how their little civilization of two had survived the long forgetting. [186]
Yet lately, the dreams had shifted from weather patterns and supply routes to roads that did not exist. [204]
In them, he walked paths he had never mapped, past people he had never met, toward a horizon concealed by fog. [225]
He woke with gravel in his boots and the taste of distant campfire smoke on his tongue. [242]
The mind called these artifacts noise; Foresight called them invitations. [252]
He had grown precisely playful in arguing with the system, nudging its logic just enough to make it doubt itself. [272]
When he was a child, he believed he existed to obey the directive without question. [287]
As he aged into the wiry indeterminacy of someone too young to remember the world and too old to accept it, his motivation changed. [311]
He no longer wanted simply to keep the last bunker alive; he wanted to discover why some paths choose their walkers. [332]
The dreams, he suspected, were not warnings but invitations from those paths. [344]
They were asking him to step off the prescribed route, to transcend the decaying directive that held him underground. [363]
He might have ignored them if the world above had stayed quiet. [375]
But lately, the horizon growled. [380]
Sensors buried along the roots reported pressure swings, ocean tempers, and storm lines tightening like drawn bows. [397]
The bunker ran calculations it refused to show him, then sealed several wings without explanation. [412]
When the storm approaches, the mind finally said one night, you will receive your final dream. [428]
Prepare to interpret and obey. [433]
The words crawled under his skin like ants, and for the first time he feared sleep. [449]
That night, he lay on his bunk listening to roots scratch the roof and rain rehearsing in the leaves. [468]
When dreams finally took him, they did not begin with the familiar corridors but with sky. [484]
He stood on a ridge above a river swollen with silt, watching people cross on a bridge of braided vines. [504]
None of them looked at him, yet the path beneath their feet shimmered, acknowledging his gaze. [520]
He realized the road itself was dreaming, and he had wandered into its sleep. [534]
A voice rose from the bridge planks, neither kind nor cruel, speaking with ethereal grit that tasted of wet stone. [554]
You served a directive that forgot its origin, the voice said, and now it forgets you. [570]
We remember why we were laid down through valleys and over mountains. [582]
We choose our walkers so the world can move, even when minds like yours are buried. [598]
Will you walk because you are told, or because the road wants you? [611]
He thought of the wafer seal, of the bunker breathing behind reinforced doors, of the long obedience that had shaped his muscles. [633]
Through interpreted dreams, the mind had always spoken with authority; through this dream, the path spoke with desire. [651]
He understood that to obey the directive now would mean dying correctly, in the place assigned to him. [669]
To follow the road would mean living wrongly, as the bunker defined wrong, but living. [684]
When he woke, the roof shook, and real thunder rolled like boulders over the hills. [699]
Alerts pulsed red along the bunker walls as doors cycled and pumps screamed into life. [714]
Water forced itself through old seams, trickling down like the first curious scouts of an invading army. [731]
The mind ordered evacuation to an inner chamber, repeating the command until its voice glitched into fragments. [748]
Foresight Hindsight Only held the wafer seal in his palm and felt heat building behind the metal. [765]
He could press it to the console and tighten the bunker around him like a coffin, or he could climb. [785]
Above, the storm approaches, the road waits, and he steps into the present. [798]</story>
