<story>The sea had gone out with the afternoon tide, leaving mirrors of water in the stone. [16]
I knelt beside one such mirror, stylus hovering over my salt-swollen notebook. [28]
The grotto around me breathed, a hollow in the cliff where waves spoke in echoes. [43]
Above its mouth the first stars sharpened, turning the place into an ancient grotto under stars. [59]
By vocation I was a tidal-pool chronicler, warmly observant of every fleeting configuration of life. [74]
Barnacles like shut eyes, anemones as startled mouths, pale shrimp flickering between worlds. [87]
Tonight, though, I chronicled a different tide. [94]
Across from me, on a ledge carved smooth by centuries of storms, Lysa wrapped her cloak tighter. [111]
We had been arguing, though calling it that felt too sharp for the slow ache between us. [128]
It was a difficult conversation about leaving the coast behind, and now we rested inside its pause. [145]
Everything that followed unfolded across the pause in a difficult conversation, stretched like low tide itself. [161]
Between us on the stone lay the jade cicada she had brought from inland hills I had never seen. [180]
Its wings were folded, each carved vein catching star-silver, a creature forever on the edge of singing. [197]
Lysa said the cicada marked the start of her peoples summers, when the air trembled with sound. [214]
To her it meant ripening wheat, dry paths, the long walk away from storms and salt. [230]
To me it looked like something caught mid-shed, half husk, half emergence. [242]
We watched it in silence as the waves whispered outside, both thinking of what had not been said. [260]
I wanted, more than I could tell her, to discover the texture of time in that silence. [277]
The way it snagged on memories and futures, thick here, thin there, like seaweed streaming around rocks. [294]
I had built my work on these transition periods, when water retreated and revealed what lived between certainties. [312]
Now I wondered if people were just another sort of tidal pool, bright and exposed for an hour, then gone. [332]
Lysa cleared her throat, but no words followed, only a soft click as her thumb tapped the cicadas stone back. [352]
She wanted me to come inland, to trade tides for terraces, storms for seasons you could read in bark and seed. [373]
I had said I did not know how to live without the sea measuring my days. [389]
That was true, but it was smaller than what I meant. [400]
What I meant was that I did not know how to live without the gaps between tides. [417]
Those pauses held the world at an angle where its layers showed. [429]
When I tried to foresee our life inland, I could only approach it tangentially, through side glances at rock and sky. [450]
A path glimpsed from the corner of vision, never by looking straight ahead. [463]
I touched the tidal pool, fingertip dimpling the star it held. [474]
The reflection shuddered and reformed, cliffs bending, stars smearing, my face traveling years in a breath. [490]
Perhaps, I thought, time here was not a river but a shore, each moment a different kind of sand beneath us. [511]
I had come to the grotto hoping that if we sat with the question long enough, the answer would fossilize. [531]
But the pause only deepened, and I saw that pauses were not stones, they were tides themselves. [548]
Every hesitation was a transition, and every transition a place where we could choose a new shoreline. [565]
The jade cicada seemed to listen with us, pinned between husk and flight. [578]
Its carved eyes held the patience of something that spends most of its life underground, then surfaces to sing for a single season. [601]
I realized I had been waiting for our lives to harden before I stepped into them. [617]
I thought of the larvae biding under stones, of how they molt water for air. [632]
Nothing in the grotto changed, yet the pause around us felt newly textured, grainy with overlapping possibilities. [649]
I could feel their edges the way I felt the rim of the pool under my palm. [666]
I saw us staying, the sea wearing us down together; I saw us leaving, the hills carving us into other shapes. [687]
Each vision glimmered like a tide mark, neither right nor wrong, only the record of where water once reached. [706]
I understood then that to foresee was not to predict the single future, but to notice how many futures brushed against this moment. [729]
Through that tangential approach, sliding along the edges of what might be, choice became something I could touch. [747]
I looked up from the pool to Lysa, who was still watching the cicada as if waiting for it to move. [768]
The decision did not arrive like a wave; it seeped in like groundwater, cool and undeniable. [784]
I closed the notebook and said, Let us go inland together, and return each summer. [799]</story>
