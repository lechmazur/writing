<story>The first snowmelt had just bled through the mountains when I descended to the bronze grotto under starlight. [18]
The rock shone like old coins, damp and bruised, as if the night itself had been hammered into its curves. [38]
I came there, as I always did after thaw, to collect the weights of different burdens. [54]
Some people gather stories or debts; I gather heaviness, the ache that makes spines curl and jaws clench. [72]
The grotto kept them for me in layers, one sorrow shingled over another, forming what I learned to call the shingled hush. [94]
It was no mere silence but a pressure, a roof of unsaid things overlapping like wet slate. [111]
In that submerged cathedral of bronze, my craft made sense, though the world above named it madness. [128]
They called me the fractal weaver, because the burdens I gathered never stayed singular, never obeyed their first shapes. [147]
Each one split and branched, repeating its pain in smaller echoes, until the grotto glittered with invisible geometry. [165]
To work these patterns I needed flame, but not the wide careless flame of bonfires; I needed a thread of fire I could braid. [189]
So I carried my great-grandmother's kerosene lamp burner, lacquer peeled, wick housing dented, its glass chimney lost decades ago. [208]
I had repaired it with ribs of whalebone washed up on the northern shoals, polished until they held moonlight even at noon. [230]
Everything about my days felt like whalebone reverie, a drifting through pale structures that once bore oceans but now only remembered weight. [252]
The grotto mouth narrowed behind me as I stepped over the threshold, and with that step I became boundary-lessly trapped. [272]
The paradox was the key: to be caught without boundary meant every direction might still be chosen, if I could only align myself. [295]
By orienting properly, I could move through confinements that would calcify another soul into a bitter fossil. [312]
I knelt at the central basin where rainwater collected, thin as breath, reflecting the constellations in trembling shards. [330]
The shingled hush pressed close, all the layered burdens waiting for the yearly tally, for rescue or for resignation. [349]
I lit the lamp burner with a twist of oiled rag, the flame a thin blue tongue tasting the grotto's metallic breath. [371]
Shadows rose from the bronze like old bruises surfacing through skin, and in that chiaroscuro the burdens began to show themselves. [392]
They were not objects but densities in the air, slight distortions, thicker folds in the shingled hush. [409]
A mother's unspoken fear for a fevered child sagged near the ceiling, heavy as unpoured rain. [425]
At the basin's edge lay a thin ribbon of sadness from a widower who smiled too often, its weight sharp, like gravel in marrow. [449]
I extended my hands, palms upward, and the lamp's flame climbed into patterns, fractal loops that beckoned the burdens inward. [469]
Each burden settled into the light, its heaviness translated into twist and branch, spinning into finer sequences that circled my wrists. [490]
I could feel their weights differently now, not as crushing stones but as distinct pulls, like various moons on a restless tide. [512]
One burden tried to calcify around my fingers, thickening into a rigid lattice of resentment, but I turned my wrists and the pattern broke. [536]
This was why I returned after every first snowmelt: not to hoard pain, but to understand the angles that let pain loosen. [558]
Above, the village staggered through seasons, boundary-lessly trapped in its own ways, never suspecting that weight could be steered instead of borne. [580]
They came to me sometimes with offerings, an heirloom ring, a cracked toy, thinking I was a common hedge-witch trading metal for blessings. [603]
I took the objects, yes, but only to catch the burdens that clung to them like barnacles, whispering them down to the grotto when snow began to rot. [631]
Tonight, though, a new weight lurked at the edge of the basin, heavier than any I had ever coaxed from the village. [653]
It was my own, the burden I had refused to name: the knowledge that someday the grotto's bronze bones would forget me, that my patterns would fade from their walls. [683]
For a moment it threatened to close around my chest, to calcify my breath into a permanent sigh. [701]
But I remembered the rule I had carved into whalebone long ago: burdens align or they devour. [718]
So I lifted the lamp burner higher, by orienting properly to the fear instead of from it, and watched my own heaviness join the fractal dance. [744]
It did not vanish, but its pull changed, becoming one more note in the grotto's shingled hush, a promise that even weight can learn to move. [770]
When I finally left the bronze grotto under starlight, the mountains still dripping with the first snowmelt, I carried no less burden, only a clearer way to bear it. [799]</story>
