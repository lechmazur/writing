<story>The night I first saw the transparent violin made of ice crystal, the sky refused to melt. [17]
Above the velvet observatory, midsummer stars clung like sequins to a dress that had outlived its dancer. [34]
I was there as a provenance researcher, not a believer in omens, yet the air tasted annotated. [51]
Each breath felt footnoted with someone elses regret. [59]
The curators had called me to authenticate the violin, claiming it had belonged to the first queen of the drowned empire. [80]
She had allegedly played it while her city sank, each note a bubble refusing to burst. [96]
They wanted provenance, a paper spine strong enough to hold up the weight of their exhibition banners. [113]
I wanted something harder to catalogue: to weigh a dream against an empire before the promise loses its glow. [132]
The observatory walls were padded in deep violet velvet, swallowing echoes, turning every sentence into a secret. [149]
Telescopes, dormant for the season, lounged like long dogs along the balustrade, their lenses capped against unnecessary revelation. [167]
In the center, on a stone plinth sweating with condensation, the ice violin waited without patience. [183]
It was as transparent as a lie repeated until nobody could see through it anymore. [198]
Strings of frozen river water stretched from peg to bridge, humming faintly in the humidity. [213]
When I stepped closer, the entire garden on the hill outside stepped into my skull. [228]
Every vine, every potted citrus, every stubborn weed in the cracks began whispering at once, and I realized the accident had not worn off. [252]
Last winter, a mismeasured infusion at a field dig had left me telepathic with plants, or with their gossip at least. [273]
Most days the gift was static, a green hiss under ordinary conversations, but tonight the volume hurt. [290]
He will not sign, the ivy on the western wall muttered, he will ask you to lie beautifully. [308]
I glanced toward the curator, Aurelio, who paced by the window with a contract folded like a paper guillotine in his hand. [330]
The plants were rarely wrong, though their metaphors could be florid. [341]
I needed clarity, not chlorophyll riddles, so I retreated to the small brass table by the service stair where a pot of coffee waited. [365]
I poured a cup, black as eclipse residue, and regarded the creamy porcelain saucer as if it were a second sky. [386]
Reading the future in coffee stains had begun as a joke at university, a way to pass the hours between auctions. [407]
But repetition is a kind of worship, and sometimes worship wakes things. [419]
The first drop fell where the emperor uses your signature, the second where the sea eats the map. [437]
By the third, the pattern was clear as cracked glass: my destiny, perforated and uncertain, ran right through the center. [457]
If I authenticated the violin, Aurelio would secure the imperial grant, and the observatory would propagate replicas across every capital. [477]
Children would grow up believing a myth with my name stapled discreetly to its footnote. [492]
If I refused, the violin would melt back into water, taking the drowned queens last song with it, and the empire would learn nothing except doubt. [518]
Aurelio approached, his shoes whispering against the velvet, the contract held out like a fragile accusation. [534]
You have seen enough, he said, his voice a practiced tenderness, the mulberry ache of a man who collects other peoples longing. [556]
Outside, the oleander hissed, Do not trade your holes for his crown. [568]
The violin flickered, a thin mist lifting from its bouts, and for a moment I heard it remember being river. [588]
Notes rose without bow or hand, sounds like footsteps hurrying down a flooded stairwell, refusing to choose between drowning and escape. [609]
I thought of the empire that had mapped the rivers into obedience, then drowned anyway, leaving only this impossible instrument. [629]
I thought of my own life, catalogued artifacts like pinned butterflies, neat labels hiding perforated destiny underneath. [646]
Somewhere between river and empire, between ivy warning and coffee stain certainty, a third path drummed like blood in my ears. [667]
I picked up the contract, uncapped the pen, and wrote in the margins instead of on the line they had drawn for me. [690]
Detailed doubts, alternate histories, the possibility that the violin was older than the empire and owed allegiance only to water. [710]
When I handed it back, Aurelio read the additions, his face tightening as if stitched with invisible thread. [728]
This is not authentication, he said. [734]
No, I answered, feeling the plants lean closer in a rustling hush, it is evidence that the truth will not stand still for your banners. [759]
The violin sighed, a hairline crack feathering along its side, and a single drop of water fell to the floor like a signature I refused to give. [786]</story>
