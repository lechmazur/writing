<story>By the time I reached the lost civilization archive, three years had passed since I went off the grid. [19]
Everyone in the cities remembered me only as the lending library arsonist, if they remembered me at all. [37]
Here, among dust and stone, my crimes were just another layer of ash on an already buried world. [55]
I told myself I had come only to catalog the ruins, but my real reason burned quieter and deeper. [74]
I was here to rescue a forgotten promise. [82]
The archive lay beneath a collapsed amphitheater, its entrance disguised as a rockslide, reachable only after a day of climbing. [102]
I found it because I am analytically intuitive, which means patterns feel like memories my body has not yet lived. [122]
The wind carved a low keening through the broken seating as I pried aside the stones and slipped underground. [141]
The air below was cool and tasted faintly of soot, as if some ancient fire still exhaled in secret. [160]
Rows of stone shelves radiated from a central well, lined not with books but with objects: cracked masks, clay tablets, shards of painted glass. [184]
At the bottom of the well hung a faded tapestry fragment, suspended by three bronze hooks like a patient heart. [204]
Someone had cut it from a greater whole; ragged threads trailed off into absence, suggesting a story violently interrupted. [223]
I recognized the embroidery style from a plate that used to hang in the lending library, before the night I set it alight. [246]
Back then, I had watched the flames portray a language of endings across the shelves, each book a small, unwilling torch. [267]
I told myself I was erasing a debt, honoring the promise I had made as a teenager to destroy the lies we lent to children. [292]
But the smoke did not carry the lies away; it carried the truth I had meant to protect. [310]
That truth had a name, once, though my memory reached it only as a sensation, a volcanic tenderness rising without face or word. [333]
In the archive, I followed the narrow passages, lantern swinging, until I saw the first painting. [349]
It was a fresco of a woman seated before an empty cradle, her eyes turned not to the child that was missing but to a door half open behind her. [379]
Red lines scratched across her face, fresh vandalism on ancient pigment, as if someone had tried to blind her. [398]
Under the lantern light, I saw that the scratches formed letters in a script I almost knew. [415]
I took out my notebook and copied them, my hand moving faster than my conscious understanding, trusting the analytic intuition that had led me here. [440]
The letters repeated in the next chamber, this time carved into a clay figurine of a sleeping animal, its flank deliberately chipped where the message ran. [466]
Object after object bore the same strange mutilations: a bowl with gouged patterns, a mosaic with missing tiles, a series of small self-portraits defaced beyond recognition. [492]
One self-portrait arrested me; the figure looked outward with my own angular jaw, my own asymmetrical eyebrows, though the culture was millennia dead. [515]
Across the eyes, someone had carved the same symbols, a vandalized self-portrait sending a message forward through time. [533]
I understood then that the violence against art was not destruction but emphasis, a trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message. [556]
The tapestry fragment in the well was the final piece. [566]
I lowered myself into the shaft, fingers scraping stone, until I hung level with the threadbare weave. [583]
Up close, the scene emerged: two figures facing each other across a river of fire, their hands almost touching above the flames. [605]
Between them, stitched in the same sharp script I had followed through the archive, ran a line of words whose sounds I had not heard in years. [632]
It was my forgotten promise, translated into an older tongue: I will not let stories die in silence. [650]
I had burned the lending library to keep a single banned book from being seized, believing fire would hide it, but instead I erased the only copy we knew. [679]
Whoever had marked this archive had survived a similar catastrophe and chosen a different path, turning every wound into script, every fracture into memory. [703]
Suspended there above the well, I felt my chest cleave open with remorse and awe, as if my ribs were doors the woman in the fresco had waited to see unlocked. [734]
I could not rewrite what I had burned, but I could begin another trail, one that portrayed not annihilation but ferocious care. [756]
So I stayed in the archive, still off the grid, stitching my days into translations and drawings, adding to the trail for whoever came next. [781]</story>
