<story>By the time we found the substitute body, the real problem was not death but doubt. [16]
I, Mara the village bone setter and forgiving skeptic, was the first to say the corpse was trying too hard. [36]
It lay on my table with limbs posed exactly right, scars arranged like careful handwriting, a counterfeit body in a world that preferred smudges. [60]
Everyone else wanted to believe it was him, our lost gardener Tomas, because belief is lighter to carry than a cleft in certainty. [83]
But Tomas had laughed in mismatched rhythms, and this still mouth was too well tuned. [98]
So the village elders nodded, signed their papers, and left me alone with the body and my questions, as if skepticism were housekeeping. [121]
After they went, I followed the map only Tomas and I knew, through the hedge maze whose paths he trimmed to shift with each season. [146]
The maze opened, as always, onto the secret garden hidden behind a hedge maze, his real masterpiece, where experiments grew beside rumors. [168]
Old tools rusted beside glass instruments he had blown himself, shrewdly innocent contraptions that looked like toys until they hummed with borrowed starlight. [191]
On the central bench lay the thing I had yearned and dreaded to find ever since Tomas vanished: a small tin box, breathing faintly. [215]
Inside, cushioned on scraps of moonlit cloth, rested a single changeling's baby tooth, pearly gray, still wet with an impossible warmth. [236]
I recognized it from the banned folios in the apothecary attic, the ones describing faerie substitutions and what they left behind as receipts. [259]
A changeling baby takes a human crib, the book had said, and somewhere a mirror child grows under alien skies, tethered to its discarded tooth. [284]
Tomas must have stolen such a tooth, not to gain power, but because he could not bear the idea of a child mislaid between worlds. [309]
He had always forgiven the universe its clumsy paperwork, while I forgave only people, and only if they learned from the smudges. [331]
Now, holding the tooth, I felt his old plan rustle awake inside the garden, a blueprint of nostalgic innovation drawn in the dirt. [354]
Tomas had wanted, absurdly and precisely, to turn mistakes into constellations, to stitch every misstep into a pattern we could navigate by. [376]
The garden was his sky, the hedge walls his horizon, the experiments his scattered stars waiting to be connected by someone still foolish enough to yearn. [402]
I set the tooth on my palm and felt it tug, not at my skin but at the empty space where my certainty had fractured. [427]
That cleft in certainty widened into a doorway, and through it I saw a boy lying on a stone, breathing shallowly under a violet sky. [452]
His bones were wrong from this world's angle, twisted as though he had grown in two gravities, and every instinct of bone setting flared in my hands. [479]
Tomas must have tried to bring him through and failed, leaving that meticulously prepared substitute body so the village would mourn the wrong shell. [503]
I, who mistrusted miracles, was the only one left to forgive the attempt and finish it. [519]
So I stepped through the aching doorway of air, the garden folding behind me like a closed book, and knelt beside the displaced boy. [543]
His eyes opened, shrewdly innocent, as if he already knew the cost of trust yet chose to give it on credit. [564]
Bone by bone I guided him into the physics of my world, feeling tendons realign like rearranged sentences, every correction a star on Tomas's imagined map. [590]
When we stepped back into the secret garden, dawn snagging on the hedge, the substitute body on my table had crumbled into soil, and doubt felt almost bearable. [618]</story>
