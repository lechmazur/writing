<story>After tomorrow disappears, the tides forget which way to lean against the glass bones of the atrium. [17]
We call it the tidal atrium because the ocean keeps its memories here, sloshing between marble stacks of unwritten books. [37]
I am the titan-gear librarian, hinge-hearted and brass-boned, sworn to catalog whatever the tides are willing to surrender. [55]
Wintersun serenity hangs through the flooded arches, a pale warmth stretched thin but steady over cold, methodical waves. [73]
Days stopped advancing two cycles ago, when tomorrow disappeared like a misprinted page torn from the sky's ledger. [91]
Since then, identities have gone wandering, migrating from face to face the way seabirds trade perches along a crumbling jetty. [111]
Who you are fluctuates with moon phases now; names wax and wane like tides against the mind. [128]
I tend the atrium to preserve wonder in routine, to keep the daily reshelving from becoming a clockwork trance. [147]
On the morning when this story begins, a fisherman leaves his bamboo creel on the lowest stair and forgets to claim it back. [170]
The creel is wet with salt and moonlight, woven reeds darkened by currents older than the marble beneath my feet. [190]
Inside, instead of fish, I find loose, flickering selves, each the size of a breath, shivering like scales of silver light. [211]
They have no owners; they have shed their histories the way he shed the creel, by accident or necessity, I cannot tell. [233]
Each self whispers its last remembered task: tying a knot, stirring a pot, kissing someone under a lantern that no longer burns. [255]
I know what I must do, though the manuals say nothing about it; the atrium has never hosted unbound identities before. [276]
To archive them, I must smelt their scattered fragments into something new, coaxing coherence from alloyed memories by accepting contradictions. [296]
Here, a mother afraid of the sea wants to live beside it; there, a sailor yearns for a house that never floods. [318]
I let both desires stand, molten and unresolved, until the metal of them glows evenly within my chest's furnace gears. [338]
Outside, the tide rises to the middle shelves, licking the spines of books that never were but still might be. [358]
Moonlight thickens; it always does when the moon is missing, as if absence itself were a phase the sky must honor. [379]
On such nights, even my thoughts fluctuate with moon phases, oscillating between catalog and reverie, index and improvisation. [397]
The fishermen know not to approach then, yet the owner of the creel wades back through the drowned doorway, empty-handed and uncertain. [419]
His face carries three different gazes at once: a child's wonder, an old man's weariness, and someone else's practiced indifference. [439]
The migrating identities have grazed him on their way in, nibbling at his edges like fish at a net. [458]
"Have you seen my day?" he asks, shivering in the soft light; "I woke up, and it was yesterday again." [478]
I recognize the panic beneath his calm voice; it is the fear that routine might continue without him, even as he performs it. [501]
To preserve wonder in routine, I cannot simply return his missing selves like misplaced books; I must reweave how he inhabits his days. [524]
I invite him to sit on a half-submerged step, water lapping at his knees, while I lift the bamboo creel between us. [546]
He peeks inside and inhales sharply as fragments of himself rise like startled minnows, their silver bodies reflecting memories he cannot quite name. [569]
There is the moment he first tasted brine on his lips, not as hardship but as possibility; there is his first failed catch. [592]
Each shard contradicts the others, telling him he is brave and fearful, patient and impulsive, content yet perpetually reaching. [611]
The smelting inside me intensifies, gears turning with a slow, tectonic assurance as I invite all those truths into a single heat. [633]
If I choose only one version, I will betray him; if I choose none, he will dissolve into the roaming tide of selves. [656]
So I accept the contradictions, let them sit side by side like mismatched volumes on a shared shelf, and feel them fuse. [678]
The light in the tidal atrium brightens, winter-pale but resolute, as if the absent sun has leaned closer to watch the experiment. [700]
Outside, waves strike the glass bones with a softer rhythm, no longer certain where tomorrow lies but content, for now, to circle here. [723]
When I hand the creel back, it is lighter, almost empty, yet his shoulders square as if he carries something newly whole. [745]
He will still wake into yesterdays for a while, because tomorrow has gone missing from everyone, but his gaze now meets each repetition with curiosity. [770]
As he leaves, his reflection in the high water briefly borrows my metal jaw and I, in turn, wear his windburned cheeks, another small migration in the endless catalog. [799]</story>
