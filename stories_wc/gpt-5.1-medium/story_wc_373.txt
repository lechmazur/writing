<story>By the time the tide slipped out from the pilings, Loretta had already mapped the pirate market hidden beneath the rotting pier. [22]
She moved with a curiously steadfast calm, as if the sagging boards and whispered barters were only another backwoods still to survey. [44]
The moonshine runner's daughter had spent her childhood carrying jars through pine dark and creek fog, learning where people hid what they were not ready to lose. [71]
Tonight, she had come for something she could not carry in glass, something her father insisted did not exist. [90]
Loretta had come to capture the sound of trust breaking. [100]
In the lantern dim, stalls folded out of shadows, their wares nailed to barn wood or laid on oilcloth: lockpicks, salt charms, teeth that remembered every bite. [127]
But Loretta walked past the glitter and menace until she found the old woman at the end of the pier, where the planks went soft underfoot. [153]
The woman sat before an empty table, nothing on it save an antique watch fob that seemed too refined for all this soggy barter. [177]
Its chain was silver rubbed thin, its face a circle of smoked glass that did not reflect the lanterns, only swallowed them. [199]
You brought coin, the woman asked, voice like rope pulling from water. [211]
Lor, Loretta said, nobody spends that much to hear what they already know. [224]
I am paying for what they try not to hear. [234]
The woman took the watch fob and rolled it once across her knuckles, a trick Loretta had seen card sharps use to soothe their nerves. [259]
This does not keep time, the woman said, and this does not keep you safe; it only plays back what you wish you had not heard. [285]
Loretta nodded, because desire and fear were two sides of the same jar, and she had learned long ago how to carry both at once. [310]
I need it before sunrise, she said, sliding a little leather purse across the table, its weight unmistakably honest. [329]
The woman tipped the coins into her palm, then into some pocket beneath her shawl, and for a moment the market around them drew farther away, like tide. [357]
Here, under this pier, there is a truce of hush, the woman whispered; no promises spoken aloud can bleed much, but they still bruise. [381]
You understand, girl, you will hear them bruise. [389]
That is the point, Loretta said, though her voice came out softer than she meant, as if already muffled by someone else's regret. [412]
Her father had taught her to move quiet so revenuers would not hear the slosh of jars; he never imagined she would grow hungry for the noises he hid. [441]
The woman pressed the watch fob into Loretta's palm, cold as creek rock, and closed Loretta's fingers around it, one by one. [463]
It will not work if you ask the wrong betrayal first, she said; it thwarts the greedy through false starts, until you finally listen proper. [488]
Loretta slipped the chain through her belt loop, the way her father wore his knife, and stepped back into the current of bodies. [511]
Everywhere, men and women traded what they dare not keep above water: forged deeds, stolen kisses, one boy's laughter changing hands for a pouch of bullets. [537]
Loretta thumbed the watch fob, thinking of her father asleep in their shack on the bluff, trusting her to sell a few jars and come home. [563]
She whispered his name into the glass, his real name that nobody on the route used, and then asked the question that had pressed against her ribs for years. [592]
When did you decide the liquor mattered more than Ma and me, she breathed, and the watch fob flickered once, then stayed dark and heavy as a stone. [620]
For a moment she thought the woman had cheated her, all those coins gone for nothing, but then another voice shuttered through the chain, a memory snagged from air. [649]
She heard the scrape of boots on their porch, the clink of jars dumped from a duffel, and her father's sigh as he chose which door to open first. [678]
The sound of trust breaking was not a shout, not even words, but the tiny pause before his knuckles tapped the duffel, not the bedroom where Ma waited. [706]
Loretta staggered, clutching the fob as if it burned, yet the pain came clean, like river water through a fresh cut. [727]
Around her, haggling rose and fell, but the sounds felt padded now, wrapped in cotton, as if the truce of hush had extended itself to protect her. [754]
She would stay here until sunrise, listening to every bruise of a promise, collecting them like jars on a shelf, not to drink, only to know. [780]
In the gentle rot of the pier, her unease settled beside her like company she had chosen. [797]</story>
