<story>The workshop creaked and whispered as it drifted over the acid sea, a gears-and-cogs cathedral of rusted miracles. [18]
Inside, an uncertain alchemist named Corin paced the grated floor, every step echoing like a question unanswered. [35]
Vats of smoking emerald acid gurgled below the slats, and the smell etched cauterized paths through his thoughts. [53]
Above, tangled pistons and dangling gears ticked in dire enchantment, measuring his doubt with mechanical, almost priestly precision. [71]
Corin had come here to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion, though he barely trusted his own hands. [90]
Time in the drifting workshop felt compressed, stretched between breaths held underwater, every pause a tiny drowning. [107]
Around his neck hung a key ring charm, its miniature brass keys clinking together like distant, insistent chimes. [125]
The charm was all he had kept from his master, who had vanished into the acid sea ten years before. [145]
That master had taught him that broken things could be mended with kintsugi intentions, seams of purpose shining through ruin. [165]
But Corin was no longer sure whether his intentions were gold or just another alloy of desperation. [182]
On the central worktable lay a centuries-old statue dredged from the acid, its stone skin cratered with pockmarks. [200]
Corin believed the pattern of corrosion was a script, a way to narrate the future by matching the pockmarks on a centuries-old statue. [223]
Each crater corresponded, he thought, to a star, a gear tooth, or a moment of his own unraveling. [241]
When he traced the hollows with his fingertips, his mind quilts memories together: his master laughing, the first hiss of acid, a childhood sky. [265]
At times he feared the pattern was only his fear reflected back, that he was inventing meaning where none existed. [285]
Yet outside the windows, the acid sea climbed higher each year, gnawing the workshop floats, demanding some answer from him. [305]
Tonight his experiment would risk everything: sinking the statue in a glass lung, then following it down between breaths held underwater. [326]
The lung was a cylinder of reinforced crystal, fitted with turning cogs that pumped neutralizing vapors into the seething green. [346]
Corin strapped himself beside the statue, hands shaking so fiercely he almost dropped the key ring charm into the acid. [366]
Instead he pressed the charm into a waiting socket in the cylinder, where the brass teeth aligned with hidden gears. [386]
The workshop shook as mechanisms awakened, and Corin felt the faintest click inside his chest, as if something locked in place. [407]
Slowly the glass lung descended through a trapdoor, lowering him and the statue into the churning acid with dire enchantment. [427]
The neutralizing vapors hissed around him; still, his skin prickled as though regret itself were trying to burn through. [446]
He held his breath as the cylinder dipped below, and the world narrowed to bubbles, stone, and the statue's ravaged face. [467]
Between breaths held underwater now, he forced himself to trace the pockmarks again, every touch a question he could not unsay. [488]
The acid outside pressed against the glass like a hungry cosmos, and for a moment he thought nothing would answer. [508]
Then the pockmarks flared with faint auric lines, forming a lattice that quilts memories together with possible tomorrows. [526]
He saw his master's departure, the future collapse of the floats, and a version of himself who never touched alchemy. [546]
In each image something cracked, yet the cracks glowed, filled with kintsugi intentions that asked not what could be saved, but how. [568]
He understood then that his task was not to prevent destruction, but to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion. [588]
The insight burned sweet and terrifying, because it offered no guarantee that he himself would survive to witness that meaning. [608]
A hairline fracture crawled across the cylinder wall, and cold dread seeped in alongside thin trails of acidic vapor. [627]
Corin exhaled, bubbles bursting against the statue, and began to narrate what he had seen, voice shredding in the thinning air. [648]
Each word etched itself into the glass as alchemical sigils, turning the fracture into a bright seam instead of a wound. [669]
The glass lung became a vessel of kintsugi intentions, its repaired crack mirroring the joined rings of the charm in the socket. [691]
Slowly, agonizingly, the cylinder rose, gears grinding, hauling him back toward the workshop and the corrosive sky beyond. [709]
When the trapdoor sealed above them, Corin collapsed on the metal floor, gasping, the statue dripping neutralized acid like old tears. [730]
He was still an uncertain alchemist, but the workshop no longer felt like a drifting tomb; it felt like a page mid-sentence. [752]
Between breaths, between failures, he would keep tracing cracks and pockmarks, quilting ruin into stories that might yet hold. [771]
Outside, the gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea groaned in sympathy, its rusted lungs filling with a different kind of breath. [793]</story>
