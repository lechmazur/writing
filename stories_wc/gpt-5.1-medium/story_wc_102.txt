<story>Mist pooled beneath the arches of the twilight viaduct in bloom, swallowing sound in violet hush. [16]
Arun, a camera obscura artist, set down the box and watched the fog crawl upward slowly. [32]
Every exhale from the river made the lanterns along the rail flicker, like ribs showing under wet skin. [50]
He had chosen this place because the boundary lines were thin here, or so the old monk said. [68]
And because after the past life memory surfaces, you go where the air already knows your name. [85]
Arun rubbed at the ache in his chest, which was not illness but overflow, or so he hoped. [103]
Unused love, the monk had called it, crowding the heart like birds trapped in a library. [119]
He had come tonight to find where unused love is stored, and if it could be released without burning. [138]
Spiritually curious since childhood, Arun had tried every tidy method of healing the books and blogs proposed. [155]
None of them had prepared him for waking from a dream of drowning as another mans wife and mother. [174]
The past life memory had come with a city of bells, a tidal wave, and a childs unfinished laugh. [193]
Since then, whenever he inhaled too sharply, he felt whole shorelines rush into his lungs. [208]
He began to notice that his breathing changed around certain people, as though they tugged tides inside him. [226]
The monk taught him to listen, revealing through breathing changes which memories belonged to this life and which did not. [246]
Tonight the old man had pressed a small wrapped parcel into his hand, warning that it magnified truth. [264]
Inside lay a clear, almond-shaped crystal, cool as river glass and faintly blue at its core. [280]
This is Kwan Yins Tear, the monk had whispered, a kindness so sharp it cuts disguises away. [297]
Under the violet sky, Arun lifted the crystal, and the viaducts climbing roses ghosted through it like smoke. [315]
He fitted the crystal into the rear aperture of his camera obscura, an experiment he had not dared before. [334]
The box became heavier, as though accepting an old and complicated debt. [346]
He pointed the lens toward the river mist, then toward his own chest, aligning breath with the slow click. [365]
Inside the box, light folded and refolded, becoming something more patient than a photograph, less forgiving than a mirror. [384]
When he opened the ground-glass hatch, the image that swam up was not his body but a corridor of lanterns. [404]
Each lantern contained a tiny figure seated in meditation, made of sparks, their faces blurred yet strangely familiar. [422]
He understood, without language, that every spark-person was someone he had once loved but never reached. [438]
The camera had turned him into a pilgrim of sparks, walking a procession of incomplete gestures and withheld confessions. [457]
Somewhere behind them all, the corridor bent toward a darkness thick as wool, pulsing like a covered wound. [475]
He felt his breathing hitch, tight and shallow, and the image clouded until he matched it with a deeper pull. [495]
Revealing through breathing changes, the Tear showed him that unused love was not stored in the heart at all. [514]
It lingered in the space between inhaling and exhaling, the pause where intention could still decide to reach outward. [533]
He saw himself as a boy, watching his father weep behind the shed, and choosing silence over touch. [551]
He saw the woman from his drowned life, her hand reaching through a window of water, waiting for his answer. [571]
Every withheld gesture became a lantern, every lantern a small sun burning quietly just beyond his skin. [588]
The weight in his chest was not grief but gravity, the pull of all those unspent orbits. [605]
If he could learn to exhale them, perhaps the world itself might heal in places he would never see. [624]
Arun turned the camera toward the railing where a teenager leaned, shoulders tense, phone clenched like a final argument. [643]
Through the ground glass he saw not the boys body but a dim swarm of sparks battering the inside of his ribs. [665]
His own lungs tightened in echo, and he knew the boy carried more unused love than his frame could bear. [685]
He approached slowly, words coming from the foggy lucidity inside him rather than any rehearsed kindness. [701]
Breathe with me a moment, he said, as if discussing the weather, and matched the boys rhythm inhale for inhale. [721]
Gradually their breaths slowed, the boys shoulders dropping, his eyes filling with something wetter and safer than anger. [739]
Arun felt a lantern loosen inside his own chest, float out through his open mouth, and hover between them. [758]
For a heartbeat it painted their faces with soft blue, like the glow of kwan yin's tear in a storm cellar. [779]
Then it rose, joined by others unseen, drifting up into the damp arches where the viaduct bloomed and waited. [798]</story>
