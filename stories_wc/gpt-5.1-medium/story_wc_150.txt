<story>Leila stepped off the rattling bus with a suitcase, a notebook, and inherited doubts. [14]
A diaspora returnee, she had come back to the valley only for a research grant. [29]
Officially she was here to document material religion; privately she wanted to restore lost faith. [44]
Her grandmother's village clung to the ridgeline above a catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones. [61]
Apple trunks rose from sunken graves, their bark twisting like cursive prayers written in wood. [76]
The air smelled of fermenting fruit, rainstone, and something older she could not yet name. [91]
Down among the trees, a team of local archaeologists had started across excavating a tomb. [106]
They had uncovered only fragments so far, a scatter of beads, cracked jars, and careful questions. [122]
The village council hoped for tourist money; the priest hoped the dead would forgive the disturbance. [138]
Leila, warmly curious despite her jetlag, walked down to introduce herself among the leaning stones. [153]
The lead archaeologist, Rafi, greeted her with dust on his face and suspicion in his eyes. [169]
Another outsider, he said; interrupted journeys were the only constant down here. [181]
She answered in accented village dialect, explaining her grandparents' names and the sound of their old songs. [198]
Something in Rafi's shoulders eased, though his voice kept the tone of cautious enchantment the place demanded. [215]
He warned her not to touch anything, then invited her to watch the afternoon's excavations from the shade. [233]
Over the next days, her field notes filled with sketches of roots curling around skulls like protective hands. [251]
She practiced moving among the graves through purposeful wandering, tracing old footpaths villagers had stopped using. [267]
People watched from porches, weighing whether this returnee would again vanish like so many promises. [282]
Leila listened to them after evening prayers, trading stories for tea and the names of forgotten saints. [299]
They told her of an old stone in the orchard that had once ordered the village's hours. [316]
It had been a sundial base, they said, toppled during a flood, its gnomon long rusted away. [333]
Since then, harvests and weddings and even funerals had drifted from their seasons like boats without moorings. [350]
The priest blamed climate, the mayor blamed politics, but the oldest women blamed the broken measure of time. [368]
Leila found the sundial base half buried at the edge of the dig, roots clasping it like fingers. [386]
Someone had scratched travelers' names into its rim, caravaners whose routes stopped here before vanishing into empire. [403]
She traced each letter, thinking of her own parents, who had died abroad without ever returning home. [420]
Their journey, too, had been interrupted, leaving her suspended between languages, between airports, between unfinished prayers. [436]
The villagers began to notice her devotion to the stone, how she brushed dirt away and mapped its cracks. [455]
Rafi pulled her aside, reminding her she was an observer, not a restorer, not a believer. [471]
Yet his own hands trembled slightly as he handled the bones, as if expecting reproach from below. [488]
One stormy afternoon, a trench wall collapsed, spilling soil, roots, and a cascade of small, shining stones. [505]
The excavation halted while they stabilized the earth, but the accident revealed a circular pattern around the sundial base. [524]
Ancient masons had set bones and seed pits in a ring, a calendar of fruit and mortality. [541]
Leila proposed they rebuild the arrangement aboveground, not as a shrine but as a teaching garden. [557]
The idea unsettled the priest until she showed him her notebook, pages woven with villagers' own memories and myths. [576]
He saw that the design honored the dead as storytellers, not relics, and finally gave his quiet blessing. [594]
Together, villagers and archaeologists lifted the sundial base, set it on a new stone plinth, and cleared a path. [613]
Children carried saplings to plant between marked graves, turning the catacomb orchard into a map of generations. [630]
Rafi muttered that archaeology was not landscaping, yet his voice held a reluctant wonder she recognized. [646]
On the day they finished, clouds shredded open and a thin sunbeam found the dial's new bronze pointer. [664]
Its shadow touched the first carved hour just as the distant church bell rang, the timing eerily precise. [682]
Old women crossed themselves; teenagers lifted their phones; Leila simply watched, breathing as if for the first time. [700]
The orchard seemed to lean closer, trunks and bones listening together for what would happen next. [716]
Journeys had been interrupted, graves opened, seasons broken, yet in that brief alignment she felt a fragile continuity return. [735]
Her faith did not roar back; it crept instead like a root seeking water, uncertain but unstoppable. [752]
Leila stayed through the season, guiding visitors between trees and stones, charting every new question the place asked. [770]
Her life ahead was still an interrupted journey, but now it traced a circle instead of a straight, severed line. [790]</story>
