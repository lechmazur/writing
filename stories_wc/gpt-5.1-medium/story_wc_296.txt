<story>The lake stopped pretending to be water the night the magic trick failed. [13]
Every ripple froze mid-curve, glassy and sharp as broken promises, and the orchard buried in its depths began to turn. [33]
From the shore, Arlen watched the swirling orchard vortex spin like a slow, deliberate storm beneath the ice. [51]
He had come as he always did, after the magic trick failed. [63]
Others called it a curse, but for a guarded druid who trusted nothing he could not taste in the soil, failure was merely an unfinished pattern. [89]
Arlen knelt, cloak stiff with frost, and laid his palm on the ice that had once been a receptive, rippling stage. [110]
Beneath him the frozen orchard revolved, rows of ghostly trees spiraling inward toward a dark, waiting hollow at its heart. [130]
This was where every misplaced ring, every dropped coin, every vanished keepsake in the valley eventually appeared, dangling from spectral branches like forgotten fruit. [154]
And this was where Arlen came to find the things lost long before they were ever owned. [171]
He was not gifted at illusions or charming crowds; his only gift was that the world, in its grudging way, admitted its misplacements to him. [196]
He could follow the faintest trail of absence, feel the shape of what was missing the way others felt the wind. [217]
Tonight, that trail had led him here, to the cursed lake that refused to stay liquid, to the orchard spinning under ice like a thought he could not quite complete. [247]
He was looking for something no one had admitted losing: to discover what mirrors do not show, the truth behind a confession that should have melted years ago but had instead frozen solid in his memory. [283]
The last time he had stood on this shore, the magician in red had asked for a volunteer, and Arlen's sister had raised her hand. [308]
She climbed into the mirrored box, laughed through her nerves, and disappeared when the lake behind the stage suddenly hardened into a sheet of murderous glass. [334]
The mirrors showed only emptiness, crisp and clean, and the magician's patter faltered into silence as the crowd gasped and then screamed. [356]
Later, when the village demanded answers, the magician whispered a confession to Arlen alone, three words clouding in the cold: 'I changed nothing.' [379]
Those words had frozen inside him, an icicle no fire could unbend. [391]
If the magic trick had not failed, the lie would have flowed away like spilled water, but failure left it suspended, glittering and intact, demanding proof. [417]
Arlen pressed harder on the ice until his breath came in slow, warlike serenity, each inhale a truce, each exhale a declaration of quiet siege against the lake itself. [446]
He would not break it with force; he would open it the way he opened all stubborn things, through expanding circles. [467]
He closed his eyes and sent his awareness outward in a small ring, brushing the roots of the nearest frozen reeds. [488]
Then farther, another circle, touching the sleeping fish suspended mid-flick, the drowned coins glinting like patient stars. [505]
Each circle widened his sense of the lost, the mislaid, the deliberately hidden, until at last he felt the orchard moving under the ice, a vast gear of bark and memory grinding against stillness. [539]
The trees held more than jewelry and toys; they held scenes, gestures, stray glances that people had dropped when they decided never to think of them again. [566]
Arlen felt for his sister there, searching not for her body but for the moment no mirror had ever shown: the instant between laughter and disappearance. [592]
What mirrors did not show, the orchard might have caught: the angle of a hand pulling a lever, the flinch in a magician's eye, the split-second where choice hardened into consequence. [623]
The vortex tightened in response to his attention, rows of trees twisting closer, branches raking at the underside of the ice as if eager to testify. [649]
One branch pressed up directly beneath his hand, and at its tip hung a seed like a black tear, so small he would have missed it if not for the way every circle of awareness pointed toward it. [687]
The flesh-eating plant seed pulsed against the ice, alive with a hunger so precise it made his skin crawl: it did not crave flesh in general, but confessions, the warm meat of spoken guilt. [721]
He understood then why the lake had hardened the night the trick failed, why the orchard had begun to spin; something beneath had been planted long ago, waiting for a moment of raw admission to feed upon. [758]
The magician's frozen confession had fallen into that hunger and been preserved instead of devoured, lodged like a bone in its throat. [780]
Arlen inhaled once more and whispered, 'I changed everything,' as the lost moment rose, cracking the ice. [797]</story>
