<story>The floating observatory dragged its shadow across the ruined desert like a question mark that never closed. [17]
Inside, while circuit breakers cool, I watch the feeds spill light across the glass like bleeding constellations. [34]
They still call me the drone strike wedding survivor, as if survival were anything but a slow detonation. [52]
Names are shrapnel that never works its way out. [61]
I keep a small geode crystal in my pocket, the last unbroken thing from that day. [77]
When the drones came, it sat in the center of the wedding table, an amethyst egg framed by cheap plastic flowers. [98]
The blast split it cleanly, revealing a cavity of violet teeth that somehow did not crumble. [114]
After the funerals, such as they were, I carried one half away and left the other buried in the rubble. [134]
Now the crystal hums faintly against my leg when the observatory engines shift, as if remembering gravity. [151]
The official mission of the orbital array is to predict disruptions in global stability using quantum market analytics. [169]
Unofficially, my mission is simpler and less forgivable: to find where unused potential pools. [183]
Potential for uprising, for genius, for collapse; the same charge, different conductors. [195]
We hunt not people but futures, mapping their likelihood like weather, deciding which storms to seed and which to starve. [215]
All of it is done through perturbation theory, that polite mathematics of nudging. [228]
Change one subsidy, one rumor, one satellite leak, and watch the probability clouds shimmer and tilt. [244]
Every perturbation is a small echo of the blast that took my wedding, carefully calculated instead of unannounced. [262]
I told myself I came here to stop such blasts ever happening again, but lies leave a taste, and mine went sour years ago. [286]
The truth is uglier and more precise: I wanted to stand at the center of the crosshairs. [303]
If action must fall somewhere, I wanted my hand on the tilt of its descent. [318]
Bleak exhilaration is the only honest phrase I have for the feeling when the data finally coheres. [335]
There is horror, yes, but also the bright, terrible joy of seeing the machinery of the world with no filter at all. [357]
An unfiltered awakening, every time the models spit out a new basin of possibility. [371]
We call those basins wells, as if the future were just waiting to be hauled up in buckets. [389]
On my console, the wells appear as faint vortices, intangibly tangible, like fingerprints left on fogged glass. [406]
The engineers joke that the system is haunted, because sometimes the vortices converge around places that no one has flagged, no resource, no conflict, just empty space. [433]
One of those convergences hangs now over the coordinates of my old village, where the rubble has long since cooled to anonymous stone. [456]
It has been there for weeks, a quiet whirl in the probability field, refusing to disperse. [472]
No commodity boom, no troop movement, no epidemic explains it; the algorithms keep circling, like vultures that cannot see a body but smell something underneath. [497]
While the circuit breakers cool from the last simulation surge, I stare at that whirl until the rest of the screens blur. [519]
The geode crystal heats against my thigh, an ache like a word trying to remember its own pronunciation. [537]
I think of the half I left buried, its teeth drinking whatever rain manages to fall there now. [555]
Unused potential, I realize, is not abstract; it is the girl who wanted to be a pilot, the uncle who baked bread like architecture, the boy who played the oud until the goats fell asleep. [590]
It is every path that ended in a crater; it is pooling there, under the stones, heavy and invisible. [609]
The vortex on my screen is not an error; it is the shape of all that suffocated momentum, curling inward because it was never allowed to arc outward. [637]
Bleak exhilaration hits me again, sharper than any earlier, because for once the system is not predicting what will be done to people, but what has already been stolen from them. [668]
My hands move before my conscience can interrupt, rerouting more processing power toward the anomaly, increasing resolution, deepening the model until the well sharpens around three coordinates like a triangle of absence. [700]
At each vertex the system marks a different kind of silence: no births registered, no transactions, no data pings from handhelds. [721]
There are people there, I know it, living in the blind spot, where the world forgets to measure. [739]
For the first time since I arrived in orbit, the hunt aims not outward, not down the barrel of probability toward some new target, but inward, toward the crater at my own center. [772]
I close my eyes, thumb on the geode, and nudge the model toward repair instead of ruin. [789]</story>
