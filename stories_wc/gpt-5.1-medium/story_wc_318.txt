<story>After the final grain slips through the hourglass, the tunnel under the old house wakes with a breath like a sighing furnace. [22]
In that echo chamber tunnel, every footstep arrives twice, once in sound and once in memory. [38]
Lysander, reluctant groundskeeper and leaf blower symphony conductor, descends the stairwell with his armful of machines held like mismatched violins. [58]
Their plastic casings knock together with a true haunting clatter that the dust understands better than the living upstairs. [77]
The household above has not laughed in three winters, not since Mara died in the bathtub and silence settled like limescale on every surface. [101]
Lysander has come here to restore lost laughter to a household that now whispers only in apologies and grocery lists. [121]
He is mournfully eager, carrying his grief like a tuning fork, prepared to strike it and listen to how the world rings wrong. [144]
Mara's last words were half a laugh, cut short, and the unspoken half still hangs here, raw as an unfinished chord. [165]
Lysander has spent months tending to the unspoken, rehearsing conversations they never had by sweeping leaves into sentences no one else could read. [188]
Tonight he has brought three leaf blowers, each with a different pitch, each waiting for his hand on the pull cord handle like a throat awaiting song. [215]
It is after the final grain slips through the hourglass of Mara's forgotten egg timer, the one still rusting on the windowsill above the sink. [240]
Lysander chose this moment because endings are the only honest beginnings, and because midnight muffles protest from neighbors who hate the sound of engines. [264]
He believes laughter can be coaxed back via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind that stumbles through the pipes and under bedroom doors. [288]
Down in the echo chamber tunnel, he lines the machines in a crescent, pointing their snouts toward the bare brick like brass at a theater's shell. [314]
He pulls each cord in turn, short gasps that flare into roars, then dials the throttles until the motors hover on the edge of stall. [339]
The tunnel catches the noise, macerates it against stone and moisture, and feeds it back as something almost musical, a bruised resonance shaking mildew from the ceiling. [366]
Lysander lifts his arms like a maestro at the end of the world, and the leaf blowers obey, rising in pitch, falling, weaving disharmonies. [390]
He half sings Mara's favorite lullaby, voice cracking, fusing with the engines so that the words come out grainy and frayed, like old film burning. [415]
Upstairs, the television flickers wordless colors in the living room where Mara's parents sit apart, pretending not to hear the subterranean storm. [437]
Spoons rattle in drawers; a hairbrush trembles off the bathroom shelf; the egg timer on the sill coughs once and shivers its rust. [460]
Deep between bricks, where mold has written unreadable stories, the unspoken things of the house begin to stir and press their faces toward the sound. [485]
Memories of Mara's skipped jokes, the punchlines she swallowed out of politeness, slide loose and drift downward like dandelion seeds seeking soil. [507]
Lysander changes tempo, jerking his wrist, and the leaf blowers surge, their combined roar splitting into pockets where those half-jokes catch and bloom as phantom laughter. [533]
It streams up through nail holes and mouse runs, threads the air vents, and enters the living room as a draft that smells faintly of cut grass and shampoo. [562]
Mara's father, who has not laughed since the funeral, feels the draft curl against his throat like fingers and suddenly hears his daughter failing to tell a joke. [590]
He exhales in a broken bark, half sob and half giggle, and her mother startles, then lets her own laugh escape, rusted but unmistakable, into the rattling room. [618]
The sound drops back down the stairwell like thrown light, reaches Lysander's ears as proof that something fragile has cracked open instead of sealing shut. [643]
He lets the engines die one by one, each silence booming, until only his breathing and the distant, uncertain chuckles remain to fill the tunnel. [668]
In the quiet, he understands that this work of tending to the unspoken will never be finished, because people keep swallowing their laughter to spare themselves. [694]
Still, in the echo chamber tunnel beneath the house, the pull cord handle hangs warm in his hand, and the air holds the shape of a smile. [721]</story>
