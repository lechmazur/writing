<story>The hush descended after the sharp crack, a sound like a car backfiring in the otherwise silent, reimagined ancient Persian palace. <words>20</words>  Karim, the weary undertaker of this strange place, barely flinched. <words>27</words> He was accustomed to sudden, jarring noises in the echoing stone halls, though none usually pierced the thick silence quite like that. <words>42</words>  He adjusted the worn leather straps of his satchel, the scent of embalming spices faint even to his own nose. <words>55</words>  His gaze drifted to the colossal astronomical clock dominating the central courtyard, its intricate gears frozen mid-cycle. <words>67</words>  It was a beautiful, useless thing, much like the tribal knowledge he clung to. <words>77</words>  This knowledge, passed down through generations of his family, was rarely practical in this modern age, yet it was all Karim had left of his heritage. <words>95</words>

He believed the clock held a secret, a way to imprison the encroaching darkness that threatened to consume even this opulent palace. <words>111</words>  His motivation was simple, desperate: to hold onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>122</words>  Not hope for salvation, but hope for endurance, for a flicker of light in the suffocating gloom. <words>135</words>  The tribal knowledge spoke of imprisoning spirits, of binding shadows by following sun paths. <words>147</words>  It was an ancient method, almost absurdly archaic, yet Karim felt a placid ferocity ignite within him as he considered it. <words>163</words>  He would use the sun paths, as dictated by the frozen astronomical clock, to imprison the despair that haunted him. <words>178</words>  The clock, though broken, still cast shadows, and these shadows, he believed, held the key. <words>191</words>

He began to trace the shadow of the clock’s gnomon across the courtyard stones, his fingers brushing the cool, smooth surface. <words>206</words>  The sun paths, even in this artificial light of the reimagined palace, were discernible, faint lines etched into the paving over centuries. <words>223</words>  Following them felt like stepping back in time, into a world where tribal knowledge held sway, where the sun’s journey dictated more than just the hours. <words>241</words>  He moved with a quiet intensity, his placid exterior masking the ferocity of his intent. <words>253</words>  Each step was deliberate, each tracing of the sun path a prayer, a defiance against the encroaching night. <words>267</words>  He wasn't sure what he was imprisoning, or if it would even work, this rarely practical magic. <words>281</words>  But in the hush after the car backfire, in the heart of the ancient palace, Karim, the weary undertaker, followed the sun paths, clinging to the faintest glimmer of hope. <words>304</words>  He would imprison the darkness, or at least, try to, with the only tools he possessed: tribal knowledge, a broken clock, and a placid, desperate ferocity. <words>327</words>  The silence of the street pressed in, but within the palace walls, Karim continued his ritual, a solitary figure against the encroaching night. <words>345</words> </story>
