The air inside the giant mushroom house hung thick and still, illuminated by a light that seemed both blurry and vividly intense, like a dream struggling to solidify. <words>25</words>  Dust motes danced in the strange luminescence, swirling around Jaxx, an edgy tradesman whose comfortingly pessimistic outlook was as worn as his leather apron. <words>42</words> He sat hunched over a workbench carved from the mushroom's own flesh, a torn corner of a flyer clutched in his calloused hand. <words>60</words> The flyer, faded and brittle, depicted a windmill, its sails frozen mid-rotation, a relic of a time when the world felt less like an endless void. <words>80</words>  Jaxx squinted at the flyer, the image triggering a cascade of distorted memories, half-formed impressions of a life he wasn't sure he'd even lived. <words>101</words>  He was tasked with vectorizing these fragments, pulling order from the chaos of his mind, a process he undertook with a weary sigh. <words>120</words> His method was peculiar, reliant on synchronized watches, each ticking in unison, a futile attempt to impose temporal structure on the fluid landscape of memory. <words>142</words>  He glanced at his watch, its hands aligned perfectly with the others scattered around the workbench, a silent countdown to the final rotation of a forgotten windmill, a metaphorical clock for his own fading existence. <words>169</words>  The windmill, he knew, wasn't just on the flyer; it was a symbol, a marker in the labyrinth of his mind, and its final rotation signaled something profound, something he both dreaded and anticipated. <words>195</words>  He needed to vectorize this memory, to capture its essence before it dissolved completely, leaving him adrift in the nothingness he so comfortably predicted. <words>215</words>  For Jaxx, this act of vectorizing wasn't about clarity, but about preservation, about carrying a flickering candle of recognition through an endless void of oblivion. <words>238</words>  Each precise line he traced from the tattered flyer, each synchronized tick of the watches, was a desperate grasp at something real, something tangible in the face of encroaching nothingness. <words>263</words>  He worked with a grim determination, his comfortingly pessimistic nature fueling his efforts, for if everything was destined to fade, then the act of remembering, however distorted, became all the more vital. <words>290</words>  The blurry vividness of the mushroom house interior seemed to mirror the state of his memories, sharp in fleeting moments, then dissolving into indistinct shadows. <words>311</words>  As the synchronized watches ticked on, mirroring the imagined final rotation of the forgotten windmill, Jaxx continued to vectorize, clinging to the torn flyer, a fragile anchor in the swirling currents of time and memory, determined to illuminate the void, however dimly. <words>346</words>
