The thin-lipped warlock, dressed in formally casual robes despite the dust, entered the forgotten library. <words>15</words>  It was located deep inside an abandoned mine, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying paper. <words>29</words>  He arrived as the final calendar page of the year was flipped, a time he believed held a unique confluence of energies. <words>46</words>  His motivation was simple: to gorge on the fruit of knowledge, even if it meant ignoring dire warnings whispered in hushed tones by cautious scholars. <words>66</words>  He sought to optimize his craft, not through accepted methods, but through rumored cures found only in discredited textbooks. <words>83</words>  Tonight, his focus was a lost artifact, a viking ship figurehead fragment rumored to be hidden within this library. <words>101</words>  He held a tattered, leather-bound book, its pages filled with unsettling diagrams and cryptic text, a discredited textbook promising forgotten power. <words>121</words>  He moved with a confusing certainty, his thin lips pressed together in concentration, convinced he was on the verge of a breakthrough. <words>139</words>  The library was a chaotic collection of shelves that leaned precariously, filled with volumes that seemed to breathe dust with every rustle of his robes. <words>159</words>  He ran a gloved hand along the spines, his eyes scanning for any clue, any hint of the fragment's location. <words>176</words>  The figurehead, according to the textbook, was not merely wood; it was a conduit, a key to amplifying arcane energies. <words>194</words>  He needed it to optimize a ritual, a dangerous undertaking even by his standards, but one he felt compelled to complete. <words>213</words>  The air grew colder as he delved deeper into the library, the silence broken only by the occasional drip of water and the frantic beating of his own heart. <words>235</words>  He found a section dedicated to Norse artifacts, shelves lined with replicas and faded photographs, but no fragment. <words>253</words>  Disappointment flickered across his face, quickly replaced by a renewed sense of confusing certainty. <words>270</words>  He knew it was here; the textbook had been explicit, even if its claims were considered outlandish by the academic circles he formally disregarded. <words>291</words>  He flipped through the pages again, his thin finger tracing a diagram of the figurehead, a stylized dragon with eyes that seemed to gleam even in the dim light. <words>314</words>  Then, he saw it, tucked away behind a stack of crumbling tomes: a wooden fragment, unmistakably the eye of a dragon figurehead. <words>335</words>  A smile, rare and unsettling, stretched his thin lips as he reached for the lost artifact, ready to optimize his magic and gorge on forbidden knowledge. <words>358</words>
