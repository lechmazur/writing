The abandoned waiting area hummed with the ghost of hurried footsteps, now replaced by the muted drone of virtual calls echoing from unseen apartments above. <words>23</words>  He sat amidst the peeling paint and dust-motes dancing in the weak sunlight, a subdued vigilante in a world that had moved its battles online. <words>40</words>  His weapon wasn't steel or fire, but observation, honed in the screaming silence of his own mind. <words>54</words>  He sought to master an ancient art, one whispered about in forgotten texts, an art of seeing truth in reflections. <words>69</words>  His training ground was a relic, an antique funhouse mirror salvaged from a forgotten carnival. <words>82</words>  It stood warped and shimmering, reflecting the desolate waiting area in grotesque angles. <words>95</words>  During the endless virtual calls that filled the city's days, he tracked distortions in its glass. <words>108</words>  Each ripple, each bend, was a clue, a whisper in the mirror's fractured language. <words>121</words>  He believed these distortions revealed the hidden currents of the price of war, the unseen costs paid in fractured souls and broken promises. <words>140</words>  In his artfully clumsy hands, he held a plain wooden bead, turning it over and over. <words>153</words>  The bead was a focus, a grounding point in the swirling chaos of the mirror's reflections. <words>167</words>  He was learning to flatter the mirror, not with words, but with attention, with unwavering focus. <words>180</words>  He would sit for hours, bead in hand, tracing the lines of distortion, seeking patterns, seeking meaning. <words>194</words>  The screaming silence of the waiting area amplified the whispers of the mirror. <words>205</words>  He saw faces flicker in the warped glass, faces contorted by grief, by fear, by the weight of choices made in distant conflicts. <words>225</words>  The plain wooden bead grew warm in his palm as he delved deeper into the mirror's secrets. <words>239</words>  He was clumsy, yes, often misinterpreting the subtle shifts, the fleeting images. <words>252</words>  But his clumsiness was artful, born of a relentless dedication, a willingness to stumble in the dark to find a sliver of light. <words>271</words>  He knew the price of war was etched in these distortions, a silent scream echoing through the generations. <words>287</words>  His motivation wasn't glory or vengeance, but understanding, a desperate need to comprehend the unseen toll. <words>304</words>  He wanted to master this ancient art to speak for those silenced by the conflict, to give voice to the screaming silence. <words>322</words>  The virtual calls droned on, oblivious to the subdued vigilante and his warped mirror, to his quiet struggle to decipher the price of war reflected in its depths. <words>347</words>  He continued to flatter the glass with his gaze, the plain wooden bead his only companion in the echoing emptiness. <words>362</words>  The artfully clumsy vigilante, lost in the distortions, sought to understand the unbearable weight of the unseen. <words>377</words>  And in the screaming silence of the abandoned waiting area, the mirror whispered its secrets. <words>390</words>  He listened, bead in hand, ready to pay the price of understanding. <words>401</words>
