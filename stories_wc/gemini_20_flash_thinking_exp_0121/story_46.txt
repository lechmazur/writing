The blank-faced performer sat at the piano in the orchard of giant ferns. <words>14</words> Waterfalls roared in the distance, a constant, rhythmic counterpoint to his scales. <words>24</words> He wore a plain plastic ring on his left index finger. <words>32</words> It was his uniquely typical mark, a subtle sign of his role. <words>42</words> He was the guardian of rumors in this strange, verdant place. <words>51</words> His piano practice was not just for music; it was a ritual. <words>61</words> He listened to the whispers carried on the wind, the echoes bouncing off the fern fronds. <words>74</words> These were the rumors, the secrets of the orchard, and he was their keeper. <words>84</words> To approve a rumor, to deem it worthy of passage, he tracked the moon paths. <words>95</words> The moonlight filtering through the ferns illuminated patterns on the damp earth. <words>105</words> These patterns, shifting with the lunar cycle, dictated his judgments. <words>114</words> He sought to learn the language of dreams, believing rumors were fragments of that ethereal tongue. <words>126</words> His madness was precise, a calculated detachment necessary for his task. <words>135</words> Each note he played, each scale he practiced, was a step deeper into the orchard's secrets. <words>147</words> The plastic ring felt cold against his skin, a constant reminder of his duty. <words>157</words> He paused his playing, listening intently. <words>162</words> A new rumor, faint as a breath, reached him. <words>170</words> It spoke of a hidden spring, deeper within the fern forest. <words>180</words> He consulted the moon path, its silver light painting the ground. <words>190</words> The pattern confirmed the rumor's truth. <words>196</words> He nodded, a barely perceptible movement of his blank face. <words>205</words> The rumor was approved, free to travel on the wind. <words>214</words> He resumed his piano practice, the waterfalls now a chorus to his acceptance. <words>224</words> The precise madness of his guardianship continued, note by note, moon by moon. <words>235</words> He was the silent judge, the blank-faced performer, forever bound to the orchard and its whispers. <words>248</words> The language of dreams remained elusive, yet he persisted, driven by an unseen force. <words>259</words> The plain plastic ring, a symbol of his ordinary yet extraordinary role, gleamed faintly in the moonlight. <words>273</words> He played on, a guardian in an orchard of secrets, under the watchful eyes of waterfalls and the moon. <words>287</words> His uniquely typical existence was a paradox, a quiet storm of precise madness in a world of whispers. <words>301</words> The piano notes echoed through the ferns, each one a question, each scale a step closer to understanding the dreams of the world. <words>318</words> He was the listener, the approver, the blank-faced performer in his moonlit domain. <words>329</words> The orchard held its breath, waiting for the next rumor, the next note, the next lunar judgment. <words>342</words>
