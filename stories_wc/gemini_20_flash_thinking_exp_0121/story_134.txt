Bartholomew Buttons, an understudy sorcerer of obnoxiously polite disposition, found himself in the salt crystal growing chamber, the rhythmic thumping of laundry cycles providing an unusual, yet somehow fitting, backdrop to his arcane pursuits. <words>31</words>  "Excuse me, crystals," he murmured to the shimmering formations lining the walls, "if you wouldn't mind terribly, I'm just going to set this down here." <words>47</words> He carefully placed a small cardboard box on a relatively flat cluster of amethystine salt. <words>60</words> Bartholomew's motivation was, to put it mildly, peculiar: he sought to track cultural evolution, not through dusty tomes or forgotten dialects, but by waking the unheard. <words>79</words>  His current method, acquired through questionable channels and whispered rumors, involved hindering a specific, nascent cultural shift by eavesdropping on the whispers of an ancient oak grove. <words>100</words>  The oak grove, it was said, held the very pulse of the unheard, the nascent ideas and emotions that hadn't yet solidified into the clamor of the heard. <words>120</words>  Bartholomew believed that by subtly manipulating these whispers, he could, in a manner most exquisitely polite, nudge cultural evolution in directions he deemed… preferable. <words>142</words>  Today, however, the whispers were proving stubbornly elusive, muffled perhaps by the insistent whirring of the washing machine and the low rumble of the dryer. <words>162</words>  He frowned, a delicate crease forming on his brow, and adjusted his spectacles, which perched precariously on his nose. <words>178</words> "Oh, bother," he sighed, his voice barely audible above the spin cycle, "this simply won't do at all." <words>194</words>  The playful dread, a sensation he often cultivated to enhance his focus, began to prickle at the edges of his awareness. <words>211</words>  He opened the small cardboard box, revealing a collection of intricately carved wooden listening devices, each shaped like a different woodland creature. <words>232</words>  "Perhaps," he mused, selecting a particularly charming squirrel-shaped amplifier, "a more… focused approach is required." <words>249</words>  He held the squirrel to his ear, its wooden tail tickling his cheek, and closed his eyes, attempting to filter out the mundane sounds of domesticity and tune into the ethereal whispers of the ancient oak grove, hoping to hinder whatever cultural evolution was currently brewing in the unheard. <words>286</words>  The salt crystals hummed faintly around him, mirroring the low thrum of the laundry machines, creating a strange, almost unsettling harmony. <words>305</words>  Bartholomew strained to listen, his obnoxiously polite demeanor momentarily forgotten in the face of the playful dread and the urgent need to wake the unheard, or rather, to subtly guide its slumbering trajectory. <words>334</words>  He felt a faint tremor in the squirrel amplifier, a whisper not of oaks, but of something else entirely, something… closer. <words>353</words>  The playful dread intensified, morphing into something less playful and more genuinely… dreadful. <words>368</words>  The unheard, it seemed, was waking, but not in the ancient oak grove, and certainly not in the way Bartholomew had intended. <words>386</words>  It was waking right here, in the salt crystal growing chamber, amid the laundry cycles, and it sounded suspiciously like the gurgling of a blocked drain. <words>407</words>  Perhaps, Bartholomew thought with a shudder, some cultural evolutions were best left unhindered, especially those involving plumbing. <words>424</words> He quickly closed the cardboard box, a newfound respect for the unheard, and the heard, dawning within him. <words>438</words>
