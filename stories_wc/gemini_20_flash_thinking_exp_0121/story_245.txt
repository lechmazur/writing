Jax, an irate smuggler even on his best days, pounded the cracked duracrete of the abandoned spaceport flight deck. <words>16</words>  His breath hitched in the thin, recycled air as he jogged, a futile attempt to outrun the ghosts of bad deals and betrayed partners. <words>31</words>  He wasn't really jogging for fitness; Jax was chasing whispers of hidden waterfalls, rumors of a place untouched by the grime of the galaxy, a place to cleanse his soul, if such a thing existed for a smuggler. <words>58</words>  The motivation was pure escapism, a desperate grasp at something clean in his morally bankrupt life. <words>71</words>  During his run, his worn boot nudged something metallic – a single chopstick, strangely elegant amidst the debris. <words>85</words>  He picked it up, turning the smooth, dark wood in his calloused fingers. <words>95</words>  What use was a single chopstick in this desolate place? <words>104</words>  Later, slumped against a rusted cargo container, Jax brewed synth-tea, the bitter liquid a familiar comfort. <words>119</words>  He stirred the tea with the found chopstick, the swirling leaves creating miniature storms in his chipped mug. <words>133</words>  As he stared into the murky depths, patterns began to emerge, abstractly physical shapes forming in the tea leaves. <words>148</words>  It was ridiculous, he knew, but in the swirling chaos, he saw faces, fleeting moments, echoes of the past he tried so hard to bury. <words>166</words>  This wasn't fortune-telling; it was something else, a strange form of memorializing, a way for his subconscious to surface the memories he kept locked away. <words>185</words>  The heart's revolt, he thought with biting sincerity, wasn't a grand explosion, but this quiet, persistent ache, this yearning for absolution that manifested in tea leaves on a forgotten flight deck. <words>209</words>  He saw the face of Lena, her trusting eyes before he’d run with the cargo and left her to the Syndicate’s wrath. <words>227</words>  The tea leaves shifted, now forming the jagged peaks he imagined surrounding the hidden waterfalls, a stark contrast to the flat, gray reality of his life. <words>247</words>  He was trapped, he realized, between the ghosts he couldn't outrun and the impossible purity he craved. <words>262</words>  The chopstick, a simple tool, had become an unlikely conduit, stirring not just tea, but the sediment of his soul. <words>279</words>  Each swirl, each pattern, was a painful, sincere reminder of the life he’d lived and the man he’d become, a man jogging in circles, chasing waterfalls that might not even exist, all while his heart staged its quiet, tea-leaf rebellion. <words>313</words>  The biting sincerity of it all was almost comical, this smuggler seeking solace in tea stains, using a chopstick to unlock the floodgates of regret on a forgotten spaceport. <words>337</words>  Yet, in the absurdity, there was a strange, fragile hope, a whisper that maybe, just maybe, even a heart as calloused as his could find its way to clean water. <words>364</words>  He took another sip of the bitter tea, the chopstick resting against the rim of the mug, a silent witness to his heart's abstractly physical revolt, memorialized in the delicate patterns of tea leaves. <words>392</words>  The waterfalls remained elusive, but in the tea, on this abandoned flight deck, Jax found a different kind of truth, a bitter, sincere truth, stirred with a single chopstick. <words>417</words>  And for an irate smuggler lost in the vast emptiness of space, that was something. <words>429</words>
