The shared dream recording studio hummed with the residual energy of a god’s passing, a low thrum that vibrated through the worn carpets and dusty consoles. <words>23</words>  A figure slumped in a velvet chair, Elara, the apathetic summoner, stared blankly at the swirling nebulae projected onto the studio walls. <words>40</words>  She was known for her potent magic, summoned with a sigh and dismissed with a shrug, a master of her craft despite her profound lack of enthusiasm. <words>61</words>  Now, even the cosmic spectacle failed to rouse her; the death of a god, apparently, was just another Tuesday. <words>77</words>  Yet, a flicker of something, perhaps not quite interest, but a lessening of boredom, sparked when she remembered the coral reefs. <words>95</words>  Before the god’s demise, they had pulsed with vibrant life, but now, whispers in the dream streams spoke of bleaching and decay. <words>113</words>  Elara, in her own languid way, felt a pang of something akin to responsibility; someone had to do something, and energetic people were so tiresome. <words>134</words>  Beside her chair sat a rustic coffee grinder, an antique she’d inexplicably acquired during a summoning gone slightly sideways. <words>153</words>  It was heavy, made of dark wood and iron, and felt strangely significant, though she couldn't quite place why. <words>170</words>  River wisdom, an ancient, almost forgotten magic, whispered in the back of her mind, a gentle current nudging her towards action. <words>188</words>  Elara was enthusiastically lazy, a paradox she embraced; she would expend great effort to avoid unnecessary exertion. <words>206</words>  This reef situation, however, seemed to warrant a minimal, strategically lazy approach. <words>220</words>  She rose, the coffee grinder heavy in her hands, and wandered into a deserted hall within the studio complex, a place most dream weavers avoided. <words>242</words>  Empty frames hung on the walls, remnants of forgotten dreamscapes, each one a portal to somewhere lost or unmade. <words>260</words>  Elara understood, with a sudden clarity that surprised even her, that the reefs would rebuild through matching these empty frames. <words>279</words>  The river wisdom flowed stronger now, guiding her, showing her the subtle shimmer around certain frames, the echoes of coral and current. <words>299</words>  She began to match them, not with frantic energy, but with a slow, deliberate pace, letting the grinder rest on the floor between each frame, conserving her energy. <words>323</words>  As she matched the frames, one by one, the hall began to shift, the air growing salty, the scent of the ocean filling the sterile studio. <words>345</words>  Each matched frame unfolded a piece of the reef, coral polyps blooming in vibrant hues within the dream, mirroring into reality. <words>365</words>  The gentle sharpness of river wisdom cut through her apathy, revealing a path of least resistance, a way to rebuild a world with minimal effort, maximum impact. <words>389</words>  Elara, the apathetic summoner, continued her work, the rustic coffee grinder a silent witness, the deserted hall echoing with the quiet unfolding of new life, born from laziness and river wisdom, after the last breath of a dying god. <words>426</words>
