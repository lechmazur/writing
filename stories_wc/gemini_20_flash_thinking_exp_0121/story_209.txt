<story>The seasoned woodsman, Silas, whistled a tune of despairing cheer as he navigated the radio wave garden. <words>14</words>  Rusting antennae sprouted like metallic weeds, humming with unseen energies, hissing static secrets into the wind. <words>26</words>  Silas wasn't there for secrets, though; he was mapping abandoned railways, a quixotic quest fueled by a loneliness as vast as the forgotten lines themselves. <words>44</words>  He needed to short-circuit the usual methods, to find a new way to listen to the land. <words>55</words>  His method involved an abandoned water tower at the garden's edge, its skeletal frame piercing the sky like a rusted needle. <words>69</words>  Inside, he planned to measure the echo, the way sound bounced off the tower's curved walls, to triangulate the buried paths of steel. <words>85</words>  He carried an antique hairbrush, its ivory handle worn smooth with age, tucked into his artfully messy beard. <words>99</words>  It wasn't for vanity; it was a tool, a resonator, he believed, for focusing the echoes. <words>111</words>  Silas climbed the water tower, the metal groaning under his weight, the wind whipping around him like a restless spirit. <words>125</words>  He reached the top just as, in his earbud, a pre-recorded sound played – the final, flat beep of a hospital monitor. <words>141</words>  A sound of endings, of finality, yet for Silas, it was a beginning. <words>151</words>  He swung the hairbrush, letting it tap against the rusted metal, listening intently to the returning sound. <words>165</words>  The echo was a language, he thought, a language of absence, of what was no longer there but still resonated. <words>180</words>  He repeated the process, moving around the tower's circumference, each tap, each echo, a point on his mental map. <words>196</words>  He was a cartographer of ghosts, charting routes of forgotten journeys. <words>205</words>  The despairing cheer wasn't just a facade; it was a shield against the crushing weight of all that lost potential, all those journeys untaken. <words>224</words>  He’d been lying to himself for years, pretending this railway mapping was about history, about preservation. <words>238</words>  But in the echoing silence of the water tower, during the imagined death knell of the monitor beep, honesty bloomed. <words>254</words>  It was about him. <words>257</words>  It was about finding his own path, even if it was through the ruins of others'. <words>269</words>  The antique hairbrush, a relic of a more ordered past, felt strangely comforting in his calloused hand. <words>284</words>  Its artfully messy bristles seemed to mirror his own life, a chaotic beauty born from years of wandering. <words>299</words>  He realized, with a jolt that resonated deeper than any echo, that he was freed by this honesty. <words>313</words>  Freed from the pretense, freed to simply be a man in a rusted tower, listening to echoes, mapping his own way forward with a strange, despairing cheer in his heart. <words>336</words>  The radio waves hummed around him, a silent chorus to his newfound truth. <words>347</words>  He was charting more than railways; he was charting himself. <words>356</words>  And in the heart of the radio wave garden, under the watchful gaze of the rusted water tower, Silas finally understood the map he was truly meant to follow. <words>379</words>
