Amid the echoing, surprisingly cheerful, playground sounds of the goblin city, Zarthus, a meek necromancer, sat hunched over a rough-hewn table. <words>23</words>  His brow furrowed in concentration as he held a fountain pen with a broken nib, its silver casing dull in the flickering torchlight. <words>40</words>  He wasn't writing spells or raising skeletons; Zarthus was trying to regain something far more elusive: understanding. <words>53</words>  His motivation was the universal riddle, a question whispered in the rustling leaves of forgotten forests and the silent hum of ancient stones. <words>71</words>  He believed the answer lay within the tangled tapestry of existence, a concept that both terrified and fascinated him. <words>86</words>  Zarthus was a peculiar necromancer, known not for raising armies of the undead, but for his peculiarly sincere desire to understand the universe's gentle secrets. <words>106</words>  He wasn't driven by power or conquest, but by a quiet, almost childlike wonder. <words>119</words>  The broken nib of his pen seemed symbolic of his own fractured understanding, yet he persisted. <words>133</words>  He had heard whispers among the goblin children, snippets of an old goblin rhyme that spoke of answers hidden in plain sight. <words>150</words>  The rhyme mentioned light reflecting off a dew drop, a seemingly simple image that Zarthus felt held profound meaning. <words>167</words>  He closed his eyes, trying to visualize a dew drop, its surface shimmering with captured light. <words>181</words>  The mystic simplicity of the image resonated with him, a stark contrast to the complex rituals and dark magic he usually associated with necromancy. <words>201</words>  Perhaps, he mused, the answer wasn't in grand pronouncements or arcane symbols, but in the quiet beauty of the mundane. <words>219</words>  He opened his eyes and looked at the broken pen again, a new thought forming in his mind. <words>233</words>  Could the brokenness itself be part of the tangled tapestry, a necessary imperfection in the grand design? <words>250</words>  The playground sounds outside his small chamber faded into a background hum as Zarthus began to see the world anew. <words>267</words>  The dew drop, the broken pen, the goblin city, all threads in the vast, intricate tapestry. <words>282</words>  He picked up the pen, not to write, but to simply hold it, feeling its weight, its flawed beauty. <words>299</words>  In that moment, amid the cheerful chaos of the underground city, Zarthus felt a flicker of understanding, a sense of regaining something lost. <words>319</words>  The universal riddle remained unsolved, but the path to its answer, illuminated by a dew drop's light, seemed a little clearer. <words>338</words>  And that, for the meek necromancer, was enough for now. <words>347</words>
