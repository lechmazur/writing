The screen flickered to life, the frozen cursor finally blinking at the instant the ancient server in the skyscraper’s belly coughed awake. <words>20</words>  Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through the orchard growing wild on the tilted floors above. <words>31</words>  Elias, a bluffing swindler whose energy was as lethargic as a hibernating sloth, watched it all with half-lidded eyes. <words>44</words> He was energetically lethargic, a paradox wrapped in worn linen and a perpetual sigh. <words>54</words>  His motivation, oddly potent for such a man, was to bare a truth no one dared to handle, a heavy secret festering in the recycled air. <words>70</words>

He needed a catalyst, a spark. <words>75</words>  Just then, a young woman hurried past, her arms laden with salvaged books, and a slim volume slipped from her grasp, tumbling to the makeshift wooden floor with a soft thud. <words>94</words>  A dropped book, a classic meet-cute, even in this toppled world. <words>102</words>  Elias, with a groan that seemed to emanate from the very foundations of the building, bent to retrieve it. <words>116</words>  "Clumsy of you," he murmured with gentle harshness, handing her the book, his voice raspy but not unkind. <words>130</words>  She blushed, her cheeks mirroring the apple blossoms blooming outside the shattered windows. <words>140</words>  "Thank you," she whispered, her eyes, wide and curious, lingering on his face. <words>150</words>

Elias felt a strange pull, a subtle magnetization towards this earnest soul. <words>159</words>  Perhaps she was the key, the unwitting accomplice in his grand, truth-telling scheme. <words>170</words>  He noticed a blank price tag dangling from his own threadbare coat pocket, a relic from a life before the Fall. <words>184</words>  He plucked it off, turning it over in his fingers, a sudden idea forming in his mind. <words>197</words>  "Tell me," he began, his voice gaining a sliver of uncharacteristic energy, "do you believe in invisible allies?" <words>211</words>  She blinked, surprised by the abrupt question. <words>217</words>  "Invisible allies?" she repeated, tilting her head. <words>223</words>

Elias pressed on, his bluffing instincts kicking in, despite his inherent weariness. <words>234</words>  "Yes," he said, his eyes gleaming with a deceptive intensity. <words>243</words>  "Forces unseen, guiding hands, the whispers of fate." <words>252</words>  He tapped the blank price tag against her hand. <words>259</words>  "This," he declared, "is the price of ignorance.  And the truth… the truth is priceless." <words>272</words>  He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. <words>280</words>  "And it's time someone paid the price to hear it." <words>289</words>  He felt the invisible allies, or perhaps just his own manipulative charm, beginning to magnetize her attention, drawing her into his web of carefully constructed lies and uncomfortable truths. <words>311</words>  The computer hummed softly, a mechanical heartbeat in the reclaimed wilderness, as Elias prepared to unleash the truth he claimed no one dared to handle, using this chance encounter, this dropped book, this blank price tag, and his energetically lethargic swindler's soul. <words>340</words>  He would bare it all, with gentle harshness, and let the chips fall where they may, guided by his invisible allies, real or imagined. <words>359</words>  The orchard air hung heavy with unspoken words and the promise of a truth about to be revealed in the heart of the toppled skyscraper. <words>378</words>  The restart was just the beginning. <words>383</words>  The blank price tag, a symbol of the value of truth, was ready to be filled. <words>395</words>  And Elias, the lethargic swindler, was finally ready to act. <words>404</words>  The gentle harshness of his truth was about to bloom, just like the orchard around them. <words>417</words>
