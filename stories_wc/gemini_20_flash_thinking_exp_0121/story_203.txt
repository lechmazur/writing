Elara, an exorcist, felt the familiar tremor of stage fright ripple through her as she approached the sterile toy assembly module. <words>18</words>  Orbital debris, like cosmic dandruff, drifted past the viewport, a silent, chaotic ballet against the manufactured cheer within. <words>30</words>  This case, like all her cases, was never usual. <words>35</words>  The possessed child, no older than seven, babbled about shadows and secrets, the inheritance of lies whispered down generations. <words>48</words>  Elara clutched the pressed wildflowers in her pocket, a fragile anchor to a less synthetic world, a gift from her grandmother, whose exorcisms were legendary, and terrifying. <words>66</words>  Her own voice, however, often deserted her when needed most, a cruel irony for someone battling demons. <words>78</words>  She had learned to channel her fear into a defiant hush, a quiet intensity that sometimes, just sometimes, worked. <words>92</words>  The method for initiating this particular exorcism was peculiar, dictated by the entity itself: by the sound of a key turning in a lock. <words>107</words>  Amid the whirring of robotic arms assembling plastic smiles, Elara prepared to submerge herself into the darkness clinging to the child. <words>121</words>  Her motivation wasn't glory, or even faith, but something more primal: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to rewrite destinies etched in deceit. <words>138</words>  She took a breath, the scent of dried petals faint against the metallic tang of the station air, and waited for the signal. <words>153</words>  The rhythmic click of a distant access panel, mimicking the sound of a key turning in a lock, echoed through the module. <words>167</words>  It was time. <words>169</words>  Elara stepped forward, her defiant hush a shield against the rising tide of dread, ready to confront the lies and the shadows they cast. <words>185</words>  The child’s eyes, too old for their face, fixed on her, and a voice, not the child’s, rasped, “You cannot undo what is.” <words>200</words>  Elara’s hand tightened around the wildflowers, their papery fragility a stark contrast to the steel of her resolve. <words>214</words>  “Never is just a word,” she whispered, her voice surprisingly steady, a defiant crack in the entity’s certainty. <words>228</words>  She would submerge herself in this darkness, in this inheritance of lies, and find a way to sculpt a different truth, a new possibility for the child, for herself. <words>247</words>  The scent of the pressed wildflowers, released by the warmth of her hand, filled the sterile air, a whisper of hope in the face of the never usual. <words>264</words>  The key turned again, this time in the lock of her own fear, and Elara began. <words>276</words>  Her voice, though hushed, resonated with a power that belied her stage fright, a defiant song against the orbital debris of despair and the manufactured smiles of lies. <words>296</words>  She would not be silenced, not by fear, not by fate, not by the inheritance of shadows. <words>309</words>  Amid the toy assembly, in the cold vacuum of space, Elara, the exorcist with stage fright, sculpted possibility, one defiant word at a time. <words>327</words>  The wildflowers, pressed flat but still fragrant, were her silent witnesses, blooming in the ashes of “never.” <words>341</words>
