The broken planetarium, now pulsing with neon and bass, was an unlikely place for quiet contemplation, but Jax, the underwater welder, found a strange solace there. <words>23</words> He was patiently impatient, a trait honed from years spent in the silent, crushing depths, now manifesting as a restless energy amidst the club's manufactured chaos. <words>44</words>  He’d come seeking something, though he couldn't name it, a feeling like the pressure before a hull breach, a moment of unraveling. <words>62</words>  Tonight, the club was especially strange, the air thick with a temporal distortion, a crossing where two timelines should never meet, or so the whispers claimed. <words>83</words>  He noticed a glint of light from a corner, reflecting off something metallic and old. <words>95</words> It was a vintage button box, tucked amongst the discarded velvet ropes and broken mirror shards that served as makeshift décor. <words>112</words>  Jax picked it up, the cool metal a stark contrast to the humid air. <words>123</words>  An inherited mystery clung to the box, a silent promise of secrets. <words>134</words> He felt drawn to it, a pull as strong as the ocean currents he usually battled. <words>147</words>  He wanted to wield improbable power, to understand the strange currents of this night, and maybe, the box held a key. <words>165</words>  He decided to pamper the box, to coax its secrets out. <words>175</words>  He wandered towards the club's vintage store mirror wall, a bizarre installation reflecting fragmented images of the dancing crowd. <words>193</words>  Via glimpses in these distorted reflections, he examined the button box, turning it slowly in his hands. <words>210</words>  Each button seemed to hum with a faint energy, each reflection a distorted window into a different possibility. <words>226</words>  He felt the unraveling begin, not of the club, but of something within himself, something connected to the box and this impossible night. <words>247</words> The planetarium’s dome, now a swirling vortex of light, seemed to amplify the feeling, pulling him deeper into the inherited mystery. <words>265</words>  He pressed a button, a small, mother-of-pearl one, and the club’s music stuttered, the lights flickered, and for a fleeting moment, he saw not the club, but stars through the broken dome, a glimpse of the planetarium's past, a moment where timelines blurred. <words>304</words>  This was it, the improbable power, not of control, but of seeing, of understanding the unraveling threads of time itself, all held within this vintage button box, in this broken, beautiful place. <words>334</words>
