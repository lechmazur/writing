The flooded opera house, lit by flickering lanterns that cast dancing shadows on the waterlogged velvet seats, was an unlikely place for cake baking. <words>22</words>  Yet, Professor Eldrin, a reticent scholar known more for dusty tomes than culinary pursuits, found himself amidst this bizarre scene. <words>40</words> He wasn't baking cake himself, of course; the aroma wafting from a makeshift kitchen in the orchestra pit was courtesy of unseen others. <words>60</words> Eldrin was preoccupied with an ancient clay tablet, its surface etched with cryptic runes, resting on a precarious stack of salvaged music stands. <words>80</words> He traced the runes with a gloved finger, his brow furrowed in concentration, trying to unlock the tablet's secrets. <words>97</words> His motivation wasn't academic curiosity alone; it was a desire to dethrone the complacency that had settled over his field of study. <words>117</words> He believed the tablet held the key to a 'gathering of echoes', a concept whispered in forgotten texts, hinting at a deeper, more resonant history. <words>138</words>  Eldrin, despite his scholarly demeanor, possessed a technically mischievous streak, a playful intellect that enjoyed puzzles and unexpected connections. <words>158</words>  His method for deciphering the runes was unconventional, born from this mischievous side: sketches hidden within the binding of a vintage dictionary he always carried. <words>181</words>  He flipped through the dictionary, not for definitions, but for the delicate pencil drawings tucked between its pages, each a visual key to a specific rune. <words>203</words>  Suddenly, a distinct 'knock' echoed through the cavernous space, not a physical sound, but a mental nudge, a subtle shift in his understanding. <words>224</words>  The runes seemed to rearrange themselves in his mind, the sketches aligning with the symbols on the tablet. <words>240</words> A pensive mirth touched his lips as he realized the 'knock' was the tablet itself, subtly revealing its secrets through the dictionary's hidden language. <words>263</words> The cake baking, the flooded opera house, the flickering lanterns â€“ it all seemed part of a grand, slightly absurd, and utterly fascinating puzzle. <words>285</words> He smiled, a rare and genuine smile, ready to delve deeper into the gathering of echoes, guided by the mischievous whispers of the ancient clay. <words>308</words> The aroma of cake grew stronger, a sweet counterpoint to the musty scent of the flooded theater, as Eldrin continued his work, the runes now beginning to yield their secrets. <words>333</words> He knew this was just the beginning, but the initial 'knock' had opened a door, and the echoes were starting to gather. <words>354</words> The pensive mirth deepened into anticipation, the complacency of his field about to be well and truly dethroned. <words>373</words>
