The lapsed priest, Father Michael, jogged through the labyrinth orchard. <words>10</words> Giant bean stalks, thick as cathedrals, clawed at a sky of dull radiance, their leafy canopies lost in the cloud-strewn heights. <words>26</words> He was unapologetically confused, his breath misting in the still air, each exhale a small white flag of surrender to the strangeness of it all. <words>45</words>  An abacus with missing beads rattled softly in his pocket, a useless tool in this impossible place, yet he carried it still. <words>62</words> The snow, a recent dusting, patterned the orchard floor in swirling drifts, and he followed these white whispers, his jogging path dictated by their silent language. <words>82</words> This was the hush of fate unraveling, he thought, a slow, deliberate undoing, and he was jogging not from something, but towards a vague notion of escape. <words>103</words> Escape from the complacency that had settled like dust in his soul, the complacency that had led him here, to this orchard of impossible scale. <words>122</words> He had been a priest of routine, of predictable prayers and expected answers, content in the well-worn grooves of faith, until the grooves wore smooth and offered no purchase. <words>145</words> Now, in this labyrinth, he understood the price of that complacency: a journey into the absurd, guided by snow patterns in a beanstalk forest, armed with a broken counting tool. <words>169</words>  His motivation was simple, primal: to step beyond fate's design, to disrupt the unraveling, even if he didn't understand what fate or design truly meant anymore. <words>190</words> The dull radiance offered no answers, only a muted, persistent light that illuminated the endless rows of stalks and the swirling snow at his feet. <words>210</words> He jogged on, unapologetically confused, the abacus a silent weight in his pocket, a reminder of calculations unfinished, of a life miscounted. <words>230</words> Each footfall was a small rebellion against the hush, against the unraveling, a desperate attempt to recalculate his path, bead by bead, even with half the beads missing. <words>254</words> The snow patterns shifted, leading him deeper into the labyrinth, and the dull radiance pressed down, heavy and expectant, as if waiting to see if a lapsed priest, jogging in a beanstalk orchard, could truly outrun fate. <words>283</words> He pushed onward, his breath ragged now, the abacus tapping a faint rhythm against his thigh, a counterpoint to the silence of the unraveling, a testament to the stubborn, confused, and perhaps ultimately futile, desire to step beyond the lines drawn for him. <words>318</words>  The price of complacency was steep, he knew, but the price of surrender, here in this strange, radiant labyrinth, was unthinkable. <words>337</words> He would jog on, into the hush, into the snow, into the heart of the unraveling, unapologetically, and with a dull, persistent hope. <words>356</words>
