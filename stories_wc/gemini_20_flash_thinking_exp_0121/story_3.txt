<story>The surly watchman, Silas, stood in the sailor's graveyard. <words>11</words>
It was the time between seasons, when the air hung heavy and still, pregnant with the shift from autumn's decay to winter's starkness. <words>30</words>
Silas wasn't guarding the graves in the traditional sense; he was watching, observing, seeking patterns. <words>42</words>
He held a short piece of yarn in his calloused hand, a tool of his craft. <words>53</words>
This craft, passed down from his grandfather, was a way to read the cosmic whispers in the mundane. <words>65</words>
Silas was serenely frantic in his pursuit, outwardly calm as stone, but inwardly a whirlwind of calculations and observations. <words>80</words>
He believed the universe spoke in riddles, and the sailor's graveyard, a place of endings and beginnings, was a potent place to listen. <words>97</words>
The market wisdom of the cosmos, his grandfather called it, the ebb and flow of fate mirrored in the tides and stars. <words>112</words>
Today, the riddle was particularly elusive. <words>117</words>
He cast the yarn onto a weathered headstone, its crimson thread a stark contrast against the grey stone. <words>132</words>
"What speaks without a tongue, yet guides the ships to shore?" Silas murmured, his voice raspy from years of sea wind and graveyard silence. <words>150</words>
He wasn't expecting an answer from the stones, but from the patterns the yarn would reveal. <words>163</words>
His grandfather had taught him to see the threads of destiny in the way the yarn fell, in its tangles and stretches, a language older than words. <words>181</words>
The dignified chaos of the graveyard, the wind whispering through broken masts used as grave markers, all contributed to the answer. <words>198</words>
He studied the yarn, his brow furrowed in concentration. <words>205</words>
The yarn formed a loop, then a straight line, then a knot. <words>214</words>
"The current," he declared finally, a slow smile spreading across his surly face. <words>225</words>
The current speaks through its effects, guiding ships without uttering a word. <words>236</words>
It was a simple answer, yet profound in its connection to the market wisdom he sought. <words>249</words>
The cosmic patterns were not grand pronouncements, but subtle whispers in the everyday, in the fall of yarn, in the pull of the tide, in the silent language of the sea. <words>272</words>
Silas gathered the yarn, feeling a flicker of understanding, a momentary glimpse into the vast, serenely frantic dance of the universe. <words>289</words>
He knew the riddles would continue, the patterns would shift, but in the quiet dignity of the graveyard, he would keep listening, keep watching, keep seeking the market wisdom woven into the fabric of existence. <words>317</words>
The yarn, a humble tool, connected him to his past, to his grandfather, and to the boundless cosmos he yearned to understand. <words>334</words>
And in this between-seasons stillness, Silas, the surly watchman, found a strange peace in the dignified chaos of his quest. <words>351</words>
