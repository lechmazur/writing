Elias, the vigilant orchardist, found himself volunteering at a paper airplane test facility, a bizarre attempt to outrun the grief that clung to him like orchard mist. <words>25</words>  He was never tardy, a trait honed by years of tending to his precisely timed harvests, and this punctuality extended to his volunteer shifts. <words>44</words>  The sterile white walls of the facility, usually echoing with the whoosh of paper projectiles, became his temporary orchard, albeit one devoid of life and laden with a strange, manufactured silence. <words>72</words>  Throughout his volunteering, Elias observed the tests with a detached curiosity, noticing patterns in the flight paths and landing zones, patterns that sparked a peculiar, sardonic glee within him. <words>102</words>  These patterns, he realized with a jolt of unexpected amusement, mirrored the intricate ocelli of a peacock's tail, a connection so absurd it almost made him laugh aloud in the hushed facility. <words>134</words>  He carried an antique letter seal in his pocket, a relic from his grandfather, its weight a comforting presence against the hollowness in his chest, and now, it became an unlikely tool in his burgeoning, peculiar investigation. <words>169</words>  Using the seal, he began to mark the landing spots on a hidden grid he’d sketched onto his clipboard, meticulously documenting the 'peacock patterns' emerging from the seemingly random paper airplane tests. <words>201</words>  The more he charted, the clearer it became: this wasn't random; it was a coded demonstration, a conspiracy unraveling itself in the arc of paper wings. <words>229</words>  He discovered the facility wasn't testing paper airplanes at all, but rather, subtly transmitting messages via their flight patterns, a clandestine operation hidden in plain sight. <words>259</words>  One afternoon, during a particularly dull briefing, Elias decided to demonstrate his findings, a sardonic grin spreading across his face as he stepped forward. <words>285</words>  "Gentlemen," he announced, his voice dripping with sardonic glee, "I believe your 'paper airplane tests' are far more… colorful than you let on," and with a flourish, he unfurled his clipboard, revealing the peacock patterns and the conspiracy they unveiled. <words>328</words> The room fell silent, the whoosh of paper airplanes replaced by the heavy thud of revelation, as Elias, the vigilant orchardist, found a strange, unexpected solace in unraveling conspiracies amidst the sterile absurdity of a paper airplane test facility, finally beginning to prune the clinging vines of his personal tragedy. <words>379</words>
