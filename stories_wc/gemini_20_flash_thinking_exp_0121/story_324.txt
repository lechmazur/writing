The fluorescent hum of the secret agent headquarters was a constant drone in the hush of a simmering future. <words>16</words>  Agent Miles, an advisor perpetually plagued by insecurity, felt it vibrate in his teeth. <words>27</words>  He navigated the sterile corridors, his polished shoes echoing softly, a counterpoint to the anxieties churning within him. <words>41</words>  The air itself felt thick with unspoken tensions, a fractured idyll masking the simmering conflicts just beyond the horizon. <words>55</words>  A rumor, whispered in hushed tones during a clandestine briefing, had taken root in Miles’s mind, a tendril of unease that refused to be ignored. <words>71</words>  It spoke of a 'dreamer's calling', a concept both alluring and unsettling, tied to something bizarre kept deep within the archives. <words>86</words>  Driven by a desperate need to prove his worth, to justify his place in this world of shadows and secrets, Miles decided to chase this rumor beyond all reason. <words>105</words>  He sought the abandoned sector, a forgotten wing of the headquarters where outdated tech and forgotten projects lay dormant, the echo of footsteps his only guide in the dimness. <words>124</words>  There, amidst the dust and decay, on a forgotten shelf, sat a brain in a jar. <words>137</words>  A label, stark and clinical, declared it: "duplicate." <words>143</words>  The ambiguity was clear, yet profoundly unsettling – a duplicate of what, or whom? <words>154</words>  Miles, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs, reached out a trembling hand. <words>166</words>  He felt an inexplicable urge, a strange compulsion rising from the depths of his fractured idyll, to interact with this unsettling object. <words>182</words>  Through the echo of imagined footsteps in this abandoned place, a phantom sound amplifying his solitude, Miles felt a strange connection to the jarred brain. <words>201</words>  He didn't understand it, this pull, this whisper of a dreamer's calling emanating from a clearly ambiguous specimen. <words>217</words>  Driven by a mixture of fear and morbid curiosity, he decided to act, to break the silence of this forgotten archive. <words>233</words>  With a sudden, sharp movement, fueled by his insecurity and the desperate need for answers, Miles jabbed a finger against the cold glass of the jar. <words>253</words>  The action was impulsive, almost violent in its abruptness, a physical manifestation of his internal turmoil. <words>267</words>  The silence that followed was thick, heavy, broken only by the persistent hum of the headquarters, a sound that now seemed to mock his desperate act. <words>284</words>  He stared at the brain, the 'duplicate', wondering if he had just made a terrible mistake, chasing a phantom rumor into the heart of something truly unknown. <words>304</words>  The dreamer's calling, whatever it was, remained elusive, shrouded in the clearly ambiguous nature of the brain and the fractured idyll of their simmering future. <words>325</words>  Miles, the insecure advisor, was left alone in the echoing silence, the weight of his impulsive jab settling heavily upon him in the abandoned place. <words>346</words>
