Sir Reginald, a jovial sellsword known for his booming laughter and even louder sword clashes, carried a secret heavier than any broadsword: a withering vow made in his impetuous youth. <words>30</words>  He was boldly reluctant to confront this vow, preferring the clang of steel to the quiet introspection it demanded. <words>47</words>  His true treasure, he knew, wasn't gold or jewels, but the dethroning of doubt that gnawed at his usually cheerful mind. <words>66</words>  To achieve this, Reginald found himself not on a battlefield, but in a witch's herb garden, a place of whispering leaves and potent aromas. <words>86</words>  This garden, rumored to shift and change with the moon, held an unexpected object amidst the rosemary and rue: an astronomical telescope, pointing towards the heavens. <words>108</words>  Throughout this strange transformation of setting and purpose, Reginald decided to employ a family tradition: the creation of a time capsule. <words>127</words>  His family, for generations, had used time capsules to bury not valuables, but burdens, sealing away regrets and anxieties in sturdy boxes. <words>147</words>  With a wry grin, Reginald began gathering items from the witch's garden – a feather dropped by a raven, a smooth river stone, a withered bloom – each representing a facet of his withering vow. <words>173</words>  He imagined the elegant mayhem that would ensue if anyone discovered a sellsword burying his woes in a witch's garden, using a telescope as a makeshift sundial to mark the capsule's burial time. <words>199</words>  The air hummed with the scent of herbs and the unspoken magic of the place as Reginald carefully placed each item into a sturdy wooden box he’d brought, a box meant to contain the ghosts of promises past. <words>227</words>  He chuckled, a sound less booming, more thoughtful, as he sealed the box, the withering vow symbolically entombed within. <words>247</words>  Burying it beneath the ancient apple tree in the garden's heart, Reginald felt a shift, a lightness replacing the familiar weight of doubt. <words>267</words>  The astronomical telescope, now casting long shadows in the afternoon sun, seemed to wink at him, a silent accomplice in his peculiar quest for inner peace. <words>289</words>  Perhaps, he mused, true treasure wasn't found in chests of gold, but in the quiet act of burying the burdens that kept one from seeing the stars. <words>311</words>  As he left the witch's herb garden, a genuine, unburdened laugh escaped him, echoing through the fragrant air, a testament to the elegant mayhem of his self-discovery and the dethroning of doubt from his mind. <words>344</words>  The jovial sellsword, still jovial, was now also lighter, freer, ready to face the world, his withering vow transformed into fertile ground for a brighter future. <words>369</words>
