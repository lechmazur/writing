The scent of frankincense hung heavy in the air of the ancient Sumerian palace, thick as the humid air rolling in from the river as the anchor lifted for the ship’s maiden voyage. <words>30</words>  Ur-Nammu, a shepherd not of sheep but of memories, a sentimental soul adrift in the stone halls, clutched an antique hairpin he’d found nestled amongst forgotten scrolls. <words>51</words>  It was tarnished silver, depicting a goddess weeping, and it sparked a familiar ache in his heart, a longing for a justice that always seemed to slip through mortal fingers like grains of sand. <words>81</words>  He was, by nature, habitually spontaneous, a trait that often led him into trouble but also, he believed, to unexpected wisdom. <words>102</words>  Today, as the city buzzed with the excitement of the departing vessel, a strange impulse seized him, a chaotic whisper urging him to act. <words>124</words>  He found himself near the dais where the city elders gathered, their voices booming pronouncements about trade routes and tributes. <words>144</words>  Driven by this sudden urge, Ur-Nammu, with a voice louder than he intended, began to boast. <words>160</words>  "I know the true price of justice!" he declared, his voice echoing in the vast hall, cutting through the elders' drone. <words>179</words>  A hush fell, all eyes turning to the unassuming shepherd standing near a pillar carved with cuneiform tales. <words>197</words>  He, emboldened by the silence and his own impulsive nature, continued, "And I know where it is bartered, in shadows deeper than these palace walls." <words>220</words>  He then, with a flourish that surprised even himself, recited a set of coordinates, seemingly plucked from thin air, "The weeping willow by the dried well, three paces north, beneath the seventh stone." <words>249</words>  These coordinates, he knew instinctively, led to a secret meeting place, a den of whispers and clandestine deals, where the scales of justice were tipped not by righteousness, but by power and coin. <words>279</words>  His motivation wasn't to expose them, not exactly; Ur-Nammu, in his chaotic humility, sought something more profound. <words>297</words>  He welcomed chaos as a teacher, believing that only by disrupting the stagnant waters of perceived order could true understanding emerge. <words>319</words>  The price of justice, he suspected, was not gold or favors, but the willingness to embrace the unpredictable, to stir the pot, even if it meant getting burned. <words>346</words>  As murmurs rippled through the hall, Ur-Nammu, the sentimental shepherd, stood quietly, the antique hairpin cool in his hand, ready to face whatever chaos his spontaneous boast had unleashed, for he knew, with a strange certainty, that the maiden voyage was not just for the ship leaving the harbor, but for him as well. <words>414</words>
