The soothsayer, Zeebo, squinted at the water rings staining the bar's surface, his brow furrowed in mild panic. <words>15</words>  Neon signs buzzed outside, casting a lurid glow across the desert maze of billboards that constituted this forgotten town. <words>28</words>  "Probably unlikely," he muttered, his voice dripping with molten sarcasm as he traced a damp circle with a trembling finger. <words>42</words>  This was how he magnified destiny, apparently: by reading the ghosts of spilled drinks on a battered wooden bar top. <words>57</words>  Between lost years, time itself felt sticky and unreliable, much like the grime clinging to his worn robes. <words>70</words>  He clutched the pocket puzzle box with 13 locks, its cold metal a small comfort against his sweaty palm. <words>85</words>  Each lock represented a choice, a path not taken, a chance to shape destiny with bare hands, or so he desperately hoped. <words>101</words>  But the water rings… they spoke of cracked earth and poisoned skies, a future choked by indifference. <words>115</words>  "Environmental stewardship," he scoffed, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. <words>126</words>  "A quaint notion for a world already drowning in its own filth." <words>137</words>  Yet, the rings also hinted at a flicker of hope, a stubborn weed pushing through concrete. <words>150</words>  Maybe unlikely, but not impossible. <words>156</words>  Zeebo’s motivation wasn't optimism; it was a furious, sarcastic defiance. <words>167</words>  He wouldn't let destiny, or whatever malevolent force was scribbling this grim future, have the last laugh. <words>182</words>  He had this puzzle box, this ridiculous method of divination, and a burning, sarcastic desire to prove the water rings wrong. <words>200</words>  The billboards outside flashed promises of paradise, of endless consumption, oblivious to the parched reality they masked. <words>216</words>  Zeebo saw through the neon lies, saw the desert encroaching, the resources dwindling, the air thickening with despair. <words>232</words>  His panic wasn't for himself, but for the silent, suffering world reflected in those damning water rings. <words>247</words>  He had to magnify something else, something stronger, something that could drown out the sarcastic despair and ignite a spark of change. <words>266</words>  He ran a finger over the first lock on the puzzle box, a tiny brass serpent coiled around a keyhole. <words>281</words>  "Let's see if we can rewrite this watery prophecy, shall we?" he muttered to the empty bar, his sarcasm now laced with a desperate resolve. <words>301</words>  The fate of this parched world, probably unlikely as it seemed, might just hinge on a mildly panicked soothsayer, a puzzle box, and the stubborn ghosts of spilled drinks. <words>328</words>  He took a deep breath, the desert air thick with the scent of ozone and regret, and began to work on the first lock. <words>348</words>
