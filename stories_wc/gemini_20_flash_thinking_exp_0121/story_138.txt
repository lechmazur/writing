Lord Auberon, a forgotten noble now relegated to the spontaneous combustion lab, felt the familiar sting of hollow recklessness. <words>16</words>  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light, illuminating rows of humming machinery and half-finished experiments. <words>28</words> Between text messages from creditors he ignored, Auberon tinkered with an artificial hummingbird drone. <words>39</words> Its metallic wings, delicate and impossibly fast, beat with a mysteriously obvious purpose he couldn't quite grasp. <words>52</words> He believed the drone held a key, a way to fortify himself against the illusions that had crumbled his life. <words>65</words> His method was peculiar: the reassembly of old ticket stubs. <words>73</words> Each faded scrap, pulled from a dusty box, represented a moment of fleeting joy, a concert, a play, a stolen afternoon – candor in small moments now weaponized. <words>93</words> He meticulously pieced together the stubs on the lab bench, the flimsy paper a stark contrast to the volatile chemicals surrounding him. <words>108</words>  The lab, a chaotic symphony of hissing pipes and sparking wires, was his sanctuary, a place to cut through illusions with the ghosts of past joys. <words>126</words>  Auberon traced the faded ink on a stub from a long-ago opera, a small, almost defiant smile playing on his lips. <words>141</words>  He wasn't sure what he was fortifying, perhaps just the memory of a life less burdened, a life before the fall. <words>157</words> The hummingbird drone whirred to life beside him, its tiny camera eye blinking, a silent witness to his strange ritual. <words>172</words>  He saw in its unblinking gaze a reflection of his own hollow recklessness, a desperate gamble on the power of memory. <words>187</words>  The ticket stubs, fragile and ephemeral, were becoming his bulwark, a testament to moments of truth amidst a world of deceit. <words>203</words>  He continued to assemble them, the lab’s hum a constant drone in the background, each piece a small act of defiance against the crushing weight of his forgotten nobility. <words>224</words>  Auberon knew it was madness, this fortifying of self with paper scraps in a spontaneous combustion lab, between the digital demands of a world that had moved on without him. <words>246</words>  But in the quiet focus of reassembly, in the candor of these small, remembered joys, he found a fleeting sense of purpose, a hollow but persistent flame of recklessness against the encroaching darkness. <words>271</words>  The drone hovered, a metallic sentinel, as Auberon, the forgotten noble, built his fragile fortress of ticket stubs, hoping to fortify himself against the ultimate illusion: oblivion. <words>291</words>  He pressed another stub into place, the glue sticky on his fingertips, the scent of old paper filling the air, a strangely comforting aroma in the volatile lab. <words>312</words>  In this bizarre sanctuary, surrounded by the potential for sudden, fiery destruction, Auberon found a strange, quiet strength in the reassembled fragments of his past, a desperate candor whispered between text messages and the hum of machines. <words>342</words> He was fortifying himself, not with stone or steel, but with the ephemeral echoes of joy, against a world determined to forget him. <words>357</words>
