Lord Auberon, a listless noble, drifted through the endless corn maze. <words>11</words> The stalks towered above him, their dry leaves whispering secrets on the haunted plain. <words>21</words> This plain, even before creatures developed sentience, held a palpable melancholy, a pre-echo of future sorrows. <words>33</words> Auberon, despite his naively sophisticated air, felt it keenly, a weight settling on his already weary spirit. <words>46</words> He clutched a faded scarf, once vibrant crimson, now muted by time and perhaps regret, a tangible link to a past he barely recalled. <words>63</words> It was a relic of shared laughter, a concept now as faded as the silk, a ghost of joy in his listless hands. <words>78</words> Then, an unexpected invitation arrived, not on parchment or paper, but woven into the very fabric of the corn itself, a shimmering thread of light leading deeper into the labyrinth. <words>98</words> It was an invitation to a spontaneous rendezvous, a gathering before gatherings, a meeting before meaning, in the heart of the maze. <words>113</words> The message promised an event, a nascent moment of creation, a chance to witness the very birth of intention, before want or will existed. <words>130</words>  A flicker of ironic awe sparked within Auberon, a feeling he hadn't experienced since childhood, a strange mix of wonder and detached amusement. <words>147</words>  He, a noble accustomed to elaborate pronouncements and weighty decrees, was summoned by a silent, shimmering invitation to a nameless event in a cornfield. <words>165</words>  This absurdity, this grand cosmic joke, resonated with his listless soul, offering a peculiar form of solace. <words>178</words> Perhaps, in this bizarre setting, he might finally discover the power of intention, not as a tool of governance or conquest, but as something fundamental, something… real. <words>197</words> The corn rustled around him, not with the wind, for there was none, but with a hushed expectancy, the maze itself holding its breath for this pre-sentient rendezvous. <words>215</words> Auberon, adjusting the faded scarf around his neck, a futile gesture against the non-existent chill, moved deeper into the green labyrinth, drawn by the promise of something, anything, beyond his listless existence. <words>239</words> He sought not joy, not purpose, but simply a flicker of understanding, a glimpse into the mechanics of being, in this strange, silent world before being truly began. <words>259</words> The rendezvous, the spontaneous event, the whispered promise of intention – it all coalesced into a single, compelling pull, a siren song of the absurd. <words>276</words> He walked on, the naively sophisticated noble, lost in ironic awe, seeking the power of intention in a haunted corn maze before time truly started. <words>295</words> The faded scarf, a splash of muted color in the green and brown, was his only companion in this silent, expectant world. <words>311</words> He wondered if shared laughter was even possible in a place so devoid of life, yet the invitation, in its very strangeness, hinted at a different kind of communion. <words>331</words>  And as he walked, a faint sound, like the echo of laughter from a time yet to come, drifted on the still air, a promise or perhaps another layer of irony in this pre-sentient world. <words>352</words>
