Rain lashed against the skeletal remains of the sky burial site, each drop a frantic drumbeat against bone and stone. <words>20</words>  Kael, a cyber-templar, stood amidst the downpour, his augmented eyes flickering, struggling to reconcile the digital scripture scrolling across his vision with the raw, visceral reality of the storm. <words>44</words> He was on a collision course, the ordered lines of code crashing against the chaotic symphony of nature. <words>61</words>  In his hand, he clutched a worn leather bridle, its cracked surface a stark contrast to the polished chrome of his cybernetic enhancements. <words>82</words> The bridle, a relic from a life he barely remembered, felt strangely grounding, a tangible anchor in the swirling digital sea of his mind. <words>104</words>  He was patiently frantic, a paradox of stillness and inner turmoil, waiting for the precise moment. <words>120</words>  The reading droned on, a monotonous chant lost to the wind, but Kael wasn't listening to the priest; he was listening to the storm. <words>142</words> He needed to prove something, not to the heavens, not to the priests, but to himself, about the nature of safety, a concept that felt increasingly like a mirage. <words>169</words>  He pulled a prism from his pouch, its facets catching the dim, storm-light, and held it aloft. <words>186</words>  This was his method: to prove the illusion of safety through the refraction of light, to bend the storm's fury back upon itself. <words>208</words>  The sky cracked open, a blinding flash of lightning illuminating the burial site, and Kael felt a surge of euphoric agitation. <words>229</words>  This was it. <words>232</words>  He angled the prism, his cybernetic fingers adjusting it with minute precision, attempting to reflect the raw power of the lightning back at the tempestuous clouds. <words>257</words>  He wanted to show them, to show himself, that even in the heart of chaos, control, or at least the illusion of it, was possible. <words>280</words>  The worn leather bridle slipped from his grasp, falling unnoticed onto the rain-soaked earth as he focused all his being on the prism, on the light, on the storm. <words>306</words>  He was a cyber-templar, yes, but beneath the chrome and code, he was just a man, desperately seeking a foothold in a reality that felt increasingly unstable, chasing the mirage of safety in a world determined to prove him wrong. <words>344</words>  The prism trembled in his hand, catching the next flash, and for a fleeting moment, in the euphoric agitation of the storm, Kael believed he could succeed. <words>370</words> He could bend light, he could bend reality, he could prove that safety, even if a mirage, could be momentarily grasped, reflected, and held against the storm. <words>395</words>  The wind howled, the rain intensified, and Kael, lost in his patiently frantic endeavor, stood defiant against the sky, a lone figure attempting to refract the storm's fury with a prism and a desperate, euphoric hope. <words>427</words>
