The frail guard coughed, the damp air of the tidal island clinging to his lungs like a shroud. <words>17</words>  He shifted his weight, the stone beneath his worn boots cold even through the thick leather. <words>29</words>  Throughout the sorting, a grim process of categorizing prisoners based on painted allegiances, he felt a familiar ache in his bones, a constant reminder of his predetermined fate. <words>48</words>  He was to remain here, a sentinel on this desolate rock, until his body finally gave way. <words>61</words>  But today, a different kind of ache pulsed within him, a resolutely wavering hope. <words>73</words>  He’d found it tucked beneath a loose stone near the gnarled, windswept trees: a sour-smelling alchemy phial. <words>87</words>  The glass was cloudy, the liquid within murky and unsettling, yet it sparked a flicker of defiance in his weary heart. <words>102</words>  Messages carved in tree bark had been appearing for weeks, whispers of escape, promises of a life beyond the island’s grey shores. <words>118</words>  He’d dismissed them at first, fear a stronger current than hope, but the phial, and the persistent carvings, chipped away at his resignation. <words>136</words>  The sorting continued, the harsh voices of the overseers echoing across the courtyard, each pronouncement sealing another prisoner’s destiny. <words>151</words>  He watched them, their faces etched with despair or false bravado, and saw reflections of his own trapped spirit. <words>165</words>  The sour smell from the phial seemed to intensify, a pungent reminder of the bitter taste of his own servitude. <words>179</words>  He clutched it tighter, the cool glass a strange comfort against his trembling hand. <words>191</words>  Suddenly, a commotion erupted near the main gate, a shout, then another, laced with panic. <words>203</words>  This was it, the opportunity hinted at in the bark messages, a chaotic distraction. <words>215</words>  His resolutely wavering hope solidified into a desperate resolve. <words>224</words>  He glanced around, his frail frame tensing, and with a surge of adrenaline, he moved. <words>236</words>  He yanked the heavy iron lever that controlled the seldom-used escape passage, hidden behind a tapestry depicting a long-dead king. <words>254</words>  Dust and rust rained down as the mechanism groaned, the hidden door grinding open just enough to squeeze through. <words>270</words>  He hesitated for a fleeting moment, the weight of his duty, his painted allegiance, pulling him back. <words>284</words>  But the sour scent of the alchemy phial, the promise of the carved messages, and the burning desire to escape his fate propelled him forward. <words>304</words>  He slipped through the opening, leaving behind the sorting, the island, and the life that was meant to be his, into the uncertain embrace of the hopeful melancholy that lay beyond. <words>332</words>
