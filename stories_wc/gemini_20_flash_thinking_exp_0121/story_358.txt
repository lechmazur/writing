The arctic research greenhouse hummed with a low, artificial sun, a stark contrast to the howling blizzard outside, unheard amid the shrieks of children at playground time. <words>25</words>  Old Man Hemlock, an old-fashioned mage in tweed and spectacles, sat amidst the exotic flora, clutching a fragment of a pharaohâ€™s coffin. <words>42</words>  He wasn't there for the botany; Hemlock was unraveling an unfolding riddle, a puzzle whispered on the winds of forgotten magic. <words>60</words> His movements were purposefully aimless, a wanderer in the labyrinth of arcane knowledge, yet his heart burned with the motivation to claim an uncharted frontier of understanding. <words>83</words>  The greenhouse mirrors, reflecting the playful chaos of children and the stoic stillness of the arctic landscape, became his conduits. <words>101</words> Through ephemeral encounters with these mirror reflections, the riddle began to yield its secrets, each glimpse a chilling whisper of the past. <words>121</words> A sanctified dread permeated the air, a sense of ancient power awakening in this sterile, modern space. <words>138</words> Hemlock felt it most keenly when he seemed to see his own reflection cuddle the coffin fragment in the glass, a bizarre, unsettling intimacy. <words>159</words> This was no ordinary puzzle; it was a gateway, and the frontier it promised was terrifyingly vast. <words>175</words> He knew the children outside, oblivious in their games, were unknowingly part of this unfolding mystery, their laughter echoing in the reflective surfaces, distorting into cryptic clues. <words>200</words> The fragment pulsed faintly in his hand, a cold, rhythmic beat against his palm, urging him deeper into the riddle's heart. <words>219</words>  He adjusted his spectacles, his gaze fixed on the swirling patterns in the polished glass, seeking the next ephemeral encounter, the next piece of the puzzle. <words>241</words> The sanctified dread intensified, a heavy cloak settling over the greenhouse, as the riddle deepened, promising revelations both wondrous and terrible. <words>262</words>  He felt a strange connection to the pharaoh, a ghostly hand reaching across millennia, guiding him through this labyrinth of reflections. <words>281</words>  The playground shouts faded into a distant hum, replaced by the whisper of ancient secrets, the rustling of unseen wings, the promise of a frontier beyond comprehension. <words>305</words> Hemlock, the purposefully aimless mage, embraced the unfolding riddle, ready to cuddle the terrifying truth it held, in this arctic greenhouse, amid the echoes of children's play. <words>332</words> The uncharted frontier was not a place, but a terrifying understanding, and he was on the verge of claiming it. <words>350</words>
