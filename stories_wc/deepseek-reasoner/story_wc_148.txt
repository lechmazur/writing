<story>My father’s lies were a ghost I could never exorcise, a legacy of false alarms that clung to my name like a stain. [27] I was sent to this lighthouse prison off a jagged reef to atone for his cries, to watch the sea and, more importantly, to hold my tongue. [52] The solitary warden, a man of granite silence, believed in the discipline of isolation, his only words the occasional grunt as he slid my meal through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades. [83] My cell was the lantern room, a glass cage where the great, dead eye of the lens watched me with dusty indifference. [103] I was not a prisoner of bars, but of water and sky, the endless, crashing monotony a judgment for a sin I did not commit. [126] My only motivation, a desperate need to thread a labyrinth with your own story, to replace his fiction with my truth before they find the bodies. [151]

The warden’s routine was absolute, but one evening, a storm of unnatural fury broke it. [167] A wave, a black mountain, struck the tower, and the old man did not come to secure the hatches. [186] The following silence was heavier than the storm’s roar, a deep and waiting void. [203] I pushed on my door, finding it yielded more than its usual inch; the impact had shaken it loose. [223] I descended the spiraling stairs into the heart of the stone tower, a place I had only ever heard from my cage above. [246] The air grew thick and cold, and a strange, dull glow began to rise from below, a metallic twilight that cast everything in a tone of copperlight repose. [274] It was a false peace, a quiet that sustains impossibilities, making the air hum with what should not be. [293]

In the base of the tower, I found the warden’s chapel, a small room with a single, ancient confessional of dark wood. [316] Its door was splintered, and from within seeped that coppery glow. [332] I pulled the broken door open and saw the source: the ornate lattice that had once divided penitent from priest was vibrating, emitting the light and a sound like a distant hum. [364] I pried the lattice free, its carved wood warm and buzzing in my hands, a tangible piece of secrecy itself. [385] And then I saw them. [389] In the corner, half-shrouded by a tarpaulin, were two shapes—the warden and, I presumed, his previous charge—their final repose a secret the sea had almost kept. [420] The storm had hidden their discovery, but for how long? [434]

A new sound began, not from the lattice but from the air around me—a soft, whispering rustle that yearned for silence. [458] I was chasing hush, the absolute quiet that follows a truth finally told, but this thing, this presence summoned by the lattice, was the opposite. [486] It was the echo of every lie my father ever told, every cry of "wolf" given form, and it began to hover in the center of the room, a shimmering, malevolent distortion in the air. [521] It fed on falsehoods, and this place was gorged with them. [536] The lattice in my hand grew hotter, its carvings glowing like embers. [551] I understood then; it was not a tool for listening, but for containing. [567] The warden hadn’t been a holy man, but a jailer for something far worse than men. [586]

The hovering thing pulsed, drinking the light from the room, and moved toward the stairs, toward the world. [606] I could not cry wolf; no one would believe the son of a liar. [622] But I could tell a different story. [628] I raised the glowing lattice and did not speak of monsters or ghosts. [644] I spoke my truth into the carved wood, the true story of a boy paying for his father’s fear, of the silence that is not peace but prison, of the two bodies and the jagged reef below. [681] I threaded the labyrinth of this horror with the only weapon I had: my own, honest story. [701] The words flowed from me, and as they did, the lattice flared, its light becoming pure and white. [722] The hovering thing recoiled, starved of the lies it needed to exist, and with a sound like a sigh, it unraveled into nothing. [748] The coppery glow vanished, leaving only the cold stone of the lighthouse. [765] Above, I heard the first shouts of the resupply boat, arriving before they find the bodies. [786] I clutched the lattice, my story now a part of its grain, and waited to tell my truth. [805]</story>
