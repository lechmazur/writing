<story>Elvan made the supply run to the remote lighthouse every fortnight, a man of few words delivering the things that kept the light burning. [25] His was a world of salt-spray and silence, of crates lowered onto a rain-slicked dock with a nod, not a conversation. [47] He was a man built for solitude, his reticence a second skin. [60] But this trip was different. [64] The lamp atop the tower was dark. [71] It had flickered out hours ago, according to the frantic mainland reports, and no keeper had answered the calls. [93] Elvan tied up his boat, his movements deliberate, and climbed the winding stone steps into a strange, heavy quiet. [115] The lantern room awaited him at the top, a place he’d only ever seen bustling with efficient life. [134] Now, it was haunted by absence. [139] The great lens was a cold, dead eye, and the wind moaned through the brass fittings with a voice that was not its own. [164] He expected to find the keeper slumped over his duty, but the room was empty. [183] On the central worktable, however, lay a single, perfect piece of sea glass, its edges worn smooth by a century of tides, its color a deep, luminous blue that seemed to hold its own light. [221] Next to it was a note, written in a shaky hand. [232] "He is gone. [234] The light is my charge now. [242] Watch for the stones." [247] It was not signed. [250] Elvan, a man not given to fancy, felt a chill that had nothing to do with the sea wind. [272] He was warmly observant by nature, missing little, and his eyes scanned the room’s periphery. [291] On the windowsill, facing the treacherous shore, was a small cairn—three flat stones stacked with impossible precision. [315] It was a message, a way of stacking stones he’d seen before on these shores, left by fishermen and hermits to signal safe passage or warn of danger. [348] This one pointed toward the cove. [356] A second note lay beneath the sea glass. [364] "I could not protect him from the storm. [372] I try to protect the others. [379] Read the letters. [382]" Elvan opened the small, weathered logbook beside the glass. [395] It was not a log, but a chain of anonymous letters, a conversation spanning decades. [414] The early entries were from a young lighthouse keeper, lonely and poetic, who had begun speaking to the empty room, confiding his fears and wonders to the air. [450] And the air, it seemed, had answered. [460] The replies appeared in a different ink, a different hand—elegant, old-fashioned script that spoke of watching the light for a century, of being bound to the lamp he had once tended. [500] They were a ghost and his living successor, finding companionship across the veil. [518] The last entry from the living keeper read: "The storm is fierce tonight. [532] I feel your anxiety in the glass. [539] Do not fret, old friend. [544] I will check the buoy lines." [550] He had never returned. [554] The subsequent entries were a solitary, desperate lament, a spectral hand trying to maintain the light alone, to atone for a failure that was not its fault. [587] The ghost’s motive was laid bare: a need to bottle the feeling of safety his light had once provided, to preserve it for every soul on the sea. [619] The final sentence, written just hours ago, held a luminescent ache, a sorrow that glowed in the dark: "The wick is spent. [640] I am fading with the light. [646] Forgive me." [649] Elvan understood. [651] The stone cairn on the sill was a warning he had missed. [666] He looked out at the churning black cove and saw it—the faint, ghostly suggestion of a new cairn on the distant headland, its message clear: danger, turn away. [701] A ship was due tonight. [707] The reticent skipper moved with a purpose he had never known. [721] He found the spare fuel, the new wicks. [729] His large, quiet hands, so used to solitary tasks, worked to rekindle the great lamp. [748] As the flame caught and grew, blazing through the pristine lens, the moaning wind settled into a sigh of profound relief. [774] The room felt less haunted, more hallowed. [781] Elvan placed the piece of sea glass on the windowsill and built a new cairn beside it, a message of safe passage, of protection renewed. [810] He would be the keeper of the light now, and the silent friend to the voice in the glass. [831]</story>
