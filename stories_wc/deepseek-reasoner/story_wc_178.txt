<story>Nebuchadnezzar’s palace existed in the fragile silence between regimes, a cavernous husk of power recently vacated. [17] Kalanu, a frugal astronomer whose robes were worn thin at the elbows, moved through its dusky harmony of long shadows and fading ochre light. [35] His motivation was not plunder but precision: to seal a covenant with the unknown forces that governed the stars. [54] He sought the legendary Tablet of Nergal, said to translate celestial patterns into terrestrial power. [70] In his hand he carried his own schematic representations of the night sky, carefully inked on vellum, a poor copy of the grandeur above. [91]

His lantern’s glow fell upon a bas-relief, and there, set within the stone, was the object of his search: a single clay tile inscribed with a perfect magic square. [116] Each number was a cuneiform wedge, a grid of encrypted devotion to the god of chaos and renewal. [133] Kalanu, a man of numbers and charts, felt a thrill that was empirically ironic; his life’s work of observing predictable patterns had led him to a artifact of pure, untamed arcana. [163] He pried the tile from the wall, its cool weight a promise in his palm. [178]

A whisper of movement echoed in the hall. [185] Kalanu froze, his frugal nature screaming that he had taken something that was not his, despite the palace’s abandonment. [205] From behind a massive pillar, a figure emerged—not a soldier, but a high priestess of the ousted regime, her eyes burning with fervent purpose. [233] "You seek to command what you do not comprehend, star-reader," she hissed. [247] "The covenant is not a transaction; it is a surrender." [258]

She began a low chant, and the air itself seemed to thicken. [270] The schematic representations in Kalanu’s satchel began to smolder, the precise lines of his star charts curling and blackening as if touched by an unseen fire. [297] This was magic that defied his empirical world, a force that consumed the representation to protect the reality. [318] Desperate, Kalanu looked at the magic square in his hand, its numbers seeming to swim in the flickering light. [340] He understood encryption, the language of codes and hidden meanings. [352] Perhaps devotion was not a plea, but a key. [362]

Instead of reciting a prayer, he began to calculate. [371] He traced the patterns of the square, finding the constants, the sums that defined its mystical boundaries. [389] He spoke not of gods, but of numbers, his voice a steady counter-rhythm to her incantation. [407] He was using the language he revered to approach the power she served. [422] The irony was not lost on him; he was employing logic to validate miracle. [437]

The priestess faltered, her chant breaking as she witnessed his method. [449] The magic square began to glow, its etched lines burning with a soft, blue light. [465] "You do not worship," she accused, but her voice held a note of shock. [480] "I am deciphering," Kalanu replied, his focus absolute. [491] The tile grew warm, then hot, and the numbers seemed to lift from the clay, hanging in the air between them. [513]

It was then he saw it—the true nature of the power within the tile. [527] The glowing numbers were not just symbols; they were a lattice, a cage for something formless and ancient. [547] His calculations had not summoned a god; they had mapped its prison. [561] To seal the covenant was to become its warden. [572] He understood the final step. [578]

He raised the blazing tile and spoke the sum of its opposite corners, a command of pure numerical symmetry. [597] The light erupted outwards, and then collapsed inwards, and for a single, silent moment, he saw it—the entity, a thing of swirling, dark energy, bound by the glowing lines of the square. [633] The action was not to summon, but to uncloak the divine machinery, to reveal the source of the mystery he had sought to control. [660] The vision lasted only a heartbeat before the light vanished, leaving the tile dark and cool once more. [682] The covenant was sealed. [687]

The priestess sank to her knees, not in defeat, but in awe. [699] The dusky harmony of the hall returned, deeper and more profound for having been disturbed. [717] Kalanu, the frugal astronomer, looked at the simple clay tile in his hand. [731] He had not gained power over the unknown; he had accepted a burden for it. [748] His devotion was encrypted in logic, his covenant a silent vow of guardianship made between regimes, in a palace that remembered old gods and awaited new ones. [777] He slipped the tile into his pouch, its weight now a solemn secret. [792]</story>
