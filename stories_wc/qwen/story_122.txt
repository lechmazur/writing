In the high, thin air of the sky burial site, the cyber-templar stood, his metallic limbs gleaming under the harsh sun. <words>21</words> The worn leather bridle in his hand, a relic from a time long past, was a symbol of his fractured past and the mirage of safety he once believed in. <words>46</words> He was patiently frantic, a paradox of calm and chaos, as he prepared to prove his theory through the refraction of light through a prism. <words>71</words> The storm clouds gathered, a dark, roiling mass that threatened to engulf the sky, and the templar's heart raced with euphoric agitation. <words>96</words> He had to reflect the lightning back at the storm, a desperate act to reclaim control over the forces that had long dictated his fate. <words>121</words> The prism, a small, clear crystal, was his only hope, a tool to bend the world to his will. <words>138</words> As he read the ancient texts, his fingers traced the worn leather bridle, a reminder of the bonds he had broken and the freedom he had sought. <words>164</words> The words on the page blurred as the storm grew closer, the wind howling like a chorus of lost souls. <words>182</words> He positioned the prism, aligning it with the approaching lightning, his breath coming in short, sharp bursts. <words>200</words> The first bolt struck, and the templar watched, transfixed, as the light refracted through the prism, splitting into a spectrum of colors. <words>225</words> The colors danced across the sky, a fleeting moment of beauty in the midst of chaos. <words>242</words> He felt a surge of power, a connection to the primal forces of nature, and for a moment, the mirage of safety seemed almost real. <words>268</words> But the storm was relentless, and the next bolt of lightning struck with a deafening crack, shattering the prism into a thousand pieces. <words>294</words> The templar fell to his knees, the worn leather bridle slipping from his grasp, but in that moment, he understood. <words>319</words> The mirage of safety was just thatâ€”a mirage, a fleeting illusion that could never truly protect him. <words>345</words> He rose, the storm still raging around him, and with a newfound resolve, he stepped forward, ready to face the reality that had always been waiting. <words>376</words> The sky burial site, once a place of peace, was now a battlefield, but the templar was no longer afraid. <words>400</words>
