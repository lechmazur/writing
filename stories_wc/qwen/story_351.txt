In the disused railway station, overgrown with ivy, the dreamy poet stood alone, his eyes fixed on the brass sundial that lay half-buried in the undergrowth. <words>25</words> The sundial, once a symbol of precision and order, now rusted and forgotten, seemed to mock the passage of time. <words>43</words> He had come here after the last riddle was solved, a series of cryptic shapes in the wax seal of an unopened letter compelling him to this place. <words>71</words> The letter, found in an old, dusty book, had been the final clue in a puzzle that had haunted him for years. <words>93</words> Each shape in the seal had led him to a different location, each more obscure than the last, until he stood here, where the tracks ended and the world seemed to pause. <words>125</words> The poet, formally rebellious, had always sought the forgotten and the unremembered, driven by a deep, quiet intensity that few understood. <words>156</words> He believed that in the margins of history, in the places where time had ceased to matter, lay the truest stories. <words>182</words> The brass sundial, with its intricate engravings and faded numbers, was a relic of a bygone era, a delicate undoing of the world he knew. <words>214</words> As he knelt to examine it, the poet felt a sense of connection to the past, a thread that linked him to those who had once walked these same tracks. <words>244</words> The cryptic shapes in the wax seal, now clear in his mind, were not just symbols but a call to stand by the unremembered, to give voice to the silent. <words>276</words> With a gentle touch, he traced the sundial's shadow, feeling the weight of the stories it held, the lives it had measured. <words>304</words> The poet knew that his journey was far from over; each riddle solved only led to more questions, more mysteries to unravel. <words>333</words> But he was content, for in the quiet intensity of this disused station, he had found a purpose, a reason to keep searching, to keep dreaming. <words>364</words> As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the overgrown tracks, the poet whispered a promise to the sundial, vowing to remember those who had been forgotten. <words>400</words>
