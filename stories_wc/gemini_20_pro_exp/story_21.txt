Ambassador Valerius, a diplomat known for his measured responses, even in the face of blatant provocation, stood in the forgotten city hall. <words>20</words> The air, thick with the faint scent of must detected through the shuttered children’s theater, hung heavy and still. <words>39</words> Outside, amid drum circles signifying a chaotic festival of the dispossessed, a different kind of tension pulsed. <words>55</words> Valerius fingered the organically synthetic fox tail tassel, a trophy taken from a bandit leader he'd brought to justice years ago. <words>75</words> It was a reminder, not of triumph, but of the price of revenge, a concept he now wrestled with daily. <words>93</words>

He had come to this desolate place, motivated to decode genetic patterns etched onto the tassel's surprisingly durable fibers. <words>110</words> The bandit, before his execution, had jested about a hidden lineage, a bloodline curse that would follow Valerius. <words>127</words> The diplomat, a man of science and reason, had initially dismissed it as the ramblings of a desperate man. <words>145</words> But the unsettling series of misfortunes that had plagued his family since then forced him to reconsider. <words>161</words> The abrasive calm he usually projected was fraying at the edges, revealing a raw fear beneath. <words>177</words>

He ran a gloved hand over the decaying mayoral desk, the wood warped and cracked. <words>191</words> The silence of the hall, broken only by the distant, rhythmic drumming, amplified the unsettling quiet within him. <words>208</words> He had pursued justice relentlessly, believing in the law's unwavering hand. <words>218</words> Now, he wondered if he had merely traded one form of chaos for another, a more personal, insidious kind. <words>237</words> The fox tail, a symbol of his victory, felt more like a shackle. <words>250</words>

Valerius set up his portable gene sequencer, its hum a stark contrast to the organic decay around him. <words>268</words> He carefully extracted a sample from the tassel, the synthetic material strangely resistant to age. <words>283</words> He had to know if the bandit's words held any truth, if his relentless pursuit of justice had unleashed something he couldn't control. <words>304</words> The price of revenge, he was beginning to understand, wasn't always paid in kind. <words>318</words> Sometimes, it was a slow, creeping erosion of everything you held dear. <words>330</words>

The sequencer beeped, displaying a complex string of genetic code. <words>340</words> Valerius leaned closer, his breath catching in his throat. <words>349</words> There, embedded within the bandit's DNA, was a marker – a rare genetic anomaly associated with heightened aggression and a predisposition to violence. <words>370</words> And, impossibly, a faint trace of the same marker was present in his own genetic profile, a legacy passed down through generations. <words>390</words> The jest had been a cruel truth, veiled in mockery. <words>400</words> The price of his revenge was the chilling realization of his own inherited darkness. <words>414</words>
