Elias, the prophet of Luna Mine Seven, wasn't sure if he *wanted* to be a prophet, a classic case of bashful arrogance. <words=20>
He felt the weight of prophecy, but also its thrilling, terrifying power, a sensation he described, with a shrug, as happily sad. <words=41>
Today, that ambivalence was focused on a cracked collection of marbles he'd found amidst discarded mining tools. <words=57>
Each swirl of color within the glass represented a soul on the cosmic scoreboard, a scoreboard he desperately wanted to scramble. <words=76>
He believed, with a certainty that surprised even him, that these marbles held the key to defragmenting the universe. <words=94>
Not in a destructive way, but in a *reordering* way, a reshuffling of fate itself. <words=109>
His method was unconventional, to say the least: a rummage sale box filled with jigsaw puzzle edges. <words=126>
He'd painstakingly collected them, believing their jagged, interlocking forms mirrored the fractured nature of reality. <words=142>
The lunar mining colony, with its sterile corridors and recycled air, felt like the perfect place for this cosmic surgery. <words=161>
Between heartbeats, in the fleeting sliver of time where possibilities coalesced, Elias worked. <words=174>
He matched the puzzle edges to the contours of the marbles, each click a tiny rebellion against destiny. <words=191>
He wasn't trying to *break* the universe, but to *remix* it, to give everyone a second, third, infinite chance. <words=209>
The final oath, whispered by generations of forgotten prophets, echoed in his mind: "Let chaos reign, so order may be reborn." <words=229>
It wasn't about destruction; it was about potential. <words=237>
He carefully placed a blue marble, representing a miner lost in a cave-in, onto a puzzle edge depicting a blooming flower. <words=257>
A new destiny, perhaps? <words=261>
A second chance at life, carved out of the detritus of a forgotten Earth. <words=275>
Elias felt a surge of power, a dizzying sense of responsibility and exhilaration. <words=288>
He was rewriting the rules, not with grand gestures, but with the quiet, meticulous act of connecting broken pieces. <words=307>
The happily sad feeling intensified, a bittersweet symphony of doubt and determination. <words=320>
He was a reluctant savior, a bashful revolutionary, armed with nothing but cracked marbles and discarded puzzle pieces. <words=338>
Yet, in that sterile, lunar environment, he felt a connection to something vast and unknowable. <words=353>
He was a conduit, a defragmenter of souls, a scrambler of the cosmic scoreboard. <words=367>
The final oath was not a curse, but a promise, a chance to reshape reality itself. <words=383>
He continued his work, between heartbeats, driven by a force he didn't fully understand, but wholeheartedly embraced. <words=400>
Each connection, each carefully placed marble, was a step towards a new, undefined future, a future born of chaos and hope. <words=421>
Elias, the ambivalent prophet, smiled, a bashfully arrogant expression that held the weight of a thousand shattered, and potentially, reborn worlds. <words=442>
He was ready for the consequences, whatever they may be, because he had finally taken the final oath, and changed everything. <words=462>
The cosmic scoreboard was scrambled, and the universe held its breath, waiting to see what would happen next. <words=480>
