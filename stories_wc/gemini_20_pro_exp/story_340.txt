Father Michael, a proud exorcist with a reputation preceding him like a fanfare, adjusted his collar, a smirk playing on his lips. <words>21</words> He surveyed Igarapé Encantado, a treehouse city nestled deep within the emerald embrace of the Amazon, its rope bridges swaying precariously. <words>41</words> The air hummed with a playful cynicism, a tone he found oddly comforting amidst the supernatural chaos he usually navigated. <words>59</words> He was here, at this impossible place, when the clock dares to skip a beat, to prove himself. <words>76</words> His motivation? <words>78</words> To outshine a looming shadow, the legacy of his predecessor, a legendary exorcist whose feats were whispered in awe. <words>96</words>

He clutched the wizard’s battered grimoire, its leather worn and pages filled with arcane symbols, a reluctant inheritance from the very man he sought to surpass. <words>120</words> The book felt heavy, a physical manifestation of the weight of responsibility he carried, a burden he both craved and resented. <words>140</words> He’d always secretly believed he was better, more capable, endearingly feisty in his approach to banishing demons, unlike the somber, overly-serious old man. <words>161</words> This mission, to cleanse Igarapé Encantado of a mischievous spirit, was his chance to finally prove it. <words>178</words>

He followed the usual path, a winding staircase built around a colossal kapok tree, expecting to reach the heart of the haunting. <words>199</words> But a sudden closure of a usual path, the staircase simply vanishing into thin air, stopped him in his tracks. <words>218</words> He scoffed, rolling his eyes. <words>223</words> "Typical," he muttered, "Always with the theatrics." <words>230</words> The grimoire pulsed faintly in his hand, a subtle guidance. <words>240</words> He flipped through the brittle pages, finding a spell, a risky one, that promised to youthify the spirit, rendering it harmless and easier to contain. <words>263</words>

It was a gamble, a deviation from his usual methods, but the playful cynicism of the city, the skipped beat of time, seemed to encourage such audacity. <words>289</words> He began the incantation, his voice echoing through the canopy, the words a strange blend of Latin and something older, something wilder. <words>310</words> The air crackled with energy. <words>315</words> A giggle, high-pitched and childlike, replaced the menacing whispers that had plagued the city. <words>329</words> He had succeeded, but a wave of dizziness washed over him. <words>340</words> He looked at his hands, now smaller, smoother. <words>348</words> The spell had backfired, youthifying him as well. <words>356</words>

He stared at his reflection in a puddle, a child staring back, the weight of responsibility now a crushing weight on his small shoulders. <words>378</words> He was trapped, a proud exorcist reduced to a boy, in a treehouse city where time played tricks, all because he wanted to be the best. <words>402</words> The grimoire slipped from his grasp, landing with a soft thud. <words>413</words> He was still endearingly feisty, but now, it was the feistiness of a child facing a world too large, a task too daunting. <words>435</words> He had outshone the shadow, perhaps, but at what cost? <words>445</words> The playful cynicism of Igarapé Encantado now felt like a mocking laughter, echoing his own folly. <words>460</words> He was stuck, at least until he could figure out how to reverse the spell, carrying a weight he wasn't ready for. <words>481</words>
