The cavernous, abandoned spaceport hangar echoed with the rustling of forgotten tarps and the decay of dreams. <words>16</words>
It was an unusually usual place for Elara, a professional cuddler, to find herself, especially during the hush before an acceptance speech began, broadcast faintly from a crackling radio somewhere in the vast space. <words>47</words>
She wasn't here for the speech; she was here because of a chance encounter at a farmer's market earlier that day. <words>67</words>
A weathered man, selling oddly luminous mushrooms, had pressed a phantom train ticket punch into her hand, whispering, "For the unspoken rules." <words>88</words>
Elara, despite her profession built on human connection, harbored a deep-seated prejudice against anything related to space travel, a fear born from a childhood spent under the shadow of this very hangar. <words>116</words>
The ticket punch, cold and strangely humming, felt like an ancient novelty, a relic of a future that never was. <words>135</words>
She’d always felt that the push for the stars ignored the needs of the earth, the decay of human connection right here. <words>156</words>
The unspoken rules of her profession – boundaries, consent, the careful dance of platonic intimacy – were her refuge. <words>173</words>
But the farmer's market encounter, the strange ticket punch, the echoing hangar… it all felt like a challenge. <words>190</words>
The acceptance speech droned on, a celebration of some new interstellar initiative, the very thing Elara resented. <words>206</words>
She looked at the punch, its intricate gears frozen in time, a symbol of journeys not taken, connections not made. <words>225</words>
The unspoken rules of the universe, she realized, were far more complex than the ones she clung to. <words>242</words>
Her prejudice stemmed from fear, a fear of the unknown, a fear of the vastness represented by this decaying hangar. <words>262</words>
The phantom ticket punch, an unusually usual object in this extraordinary setting, was a key, not to a train, but to her own locked-away empathy. <words>286</words>
She had to overcome her prejudice, not by embracing space travel itself, but by understanding the human drive behind it. <words>305</words>
The decay around her was a mirror of the decay within her own heart, the hardening against anything beyond her carefully constructed world. <words>326</words>
The hush before the speech ended; applause erupted from the radio, a distant, tinny sound in the immense space. <words>344</words>
Elara squeezed the ticket punch, its phantom mechanism clicking softly in her hand, a sound only she could hear. <words>362</words>
It was a sound of acceptance, not of the speech, but of the challenge to grow, to understand, to connect, even with the things she feared. <words>386</words>
The unspoken rules of compassion, she realized, extended far beyond the confines of her cuddling sessions, reaching even to the cold, dead stars. <words>408</words>
She took a deep breath, the stale air of the hangar filling her lungs, a strange baptism into a new, broader understanding of human connection and the ancient novelty of empathy. <words>437</words>
The ticket punch was a reminder that every journey, even the ones we don't take, shapes us, and that overcoming prejudice is the most important voyage of all. <words>463</words>
Elara finally understood the farmer's cryptic message; the ticket was for herself. <words>475</words>
