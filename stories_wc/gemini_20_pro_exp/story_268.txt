The abandoned waiting area hummed with the screaming silence of forgotten departures, dust motes dancing in the weak light filtering through grimy windows. <words>21</words>
He, a subdued vigilante known only as Silas, sat amidst the peeling paint and cracked vinyl, a single, plain wooden bead held loosely between his thumb and forefinger. <words>47</words>
His focus wasn't on the bead itself, but on the warped reflections dancing within an antique funhouse mirror propped precariously against a far wall. <words>69</words>
Silas was attempting to master an ancient art, a form of combat that relied on predicting an opponent's movements by tracking distortions in their reflection. <words>91</words>
It was artfully clumsy, this method, relying on intuition and split-second interpretations of the mirror's chaotic imagery. <words>106</words>
He was practicing during virtual calls, the only time his targets, war profiteers shielded by layers of digital security, lowered their guard even slightly. <words>128</words>
Each flicker, each unnatural stretch or compression in the reflected image on his screen, mirrored in the funhouse glass, was a tell. <words>148</words>
Silas believed that understanding the price of war wasn't about grand pronouncements or political maneuvering; it was about seeing the subtle tremors of fear in a man's reflected eye. <words>175</words>
He’d learned this the hard way, losing everything to men who treated conflict like a balance sheet. <words>191</words>
Tonight, his target was General Petrov, a man who’d grown fat on the misery of others, a man Silas intended to flatter with a visit. <words>213</words>
Not to praise him, of course, but to deliver a very personal message about accountability. <words>228</words>
The bead was a focus, a grounding point in the swirling chaos of the mirror and the digital world. <words>246</words>
It was a reminder of his past, a tangible link to the village razed by Petrov's orders, a village where such beads were carved as tokens of peace. <words>272</words>
The irony was a bitter pill Silas swallowed daily. <words>281</words>
He watched Petrov's reflection in the funhouse mirror, the general’s face distorted, almost monstrous, during the virtual call. <words>297</words>
The general was boasting about a new weapons contract, his voice a smug drone in Silas's ears. <words>313</words>
Silas saw the tell, a minute twitch in Petrov's reflected left eye, a distortion amplified by the funhouse mirror's curve. <words>332</words>
It was the same twitch Silas had seen in countless others, the unconscious betrayal of a man about to make a fatal mistake. <words>353</words>
He knew Petrov's security protocols, his routines, even the brand of whiskey he favored, all gleaned from hours spent observing these distorted reflections. <words>374</words>
The artfully clumsy method was about to become brutally efficient. <words>384</words>
Silas rose, the wooden bead dropping silently onto the dusty floor, a tiny, insignificant offering to the screaming silence of the waiting room. <words>406</words>
He had a promise to keep, a price to collect, a reflection to shatter. <words>420</words>
The price of war, Silas knew, was always paid in full, one way or another. <words>435</words>
And tonight, General Petrov was about to receive his invoice. <words>445</words>
The funhouse mirror stood silent, reflecting only the empty room, waiting for the next dance of shadows and deceit. <words>464</words>
