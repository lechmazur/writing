Kaito, his face etched with the exhaustion only a policy enforcer in the Harmonious Concord could achieve, stared out at the swaying kelp forest. <words>22</words>
The observation post, usually a sanctuary of calm, hummed with an unnatural energy. <words>35</words>
He clutched a rustic bread box, its wood smooth and worn, a genuinely fake antique gifted by his predecessor. <words>52</words>
It was supposed to be a joke, a symbol of the manufactured serenity of their utopia. <words>68</words>
But tonight, at the exact second a promise was sworn between two lovers in the kelp forest below, the box began to vibrate. <words>89</words>
Kaito knew, with a certainty that chilled him, that he was facing the supernatural, something the Concord vehemently denied existed. <words>108</words>
His training, years of enforcing social harmony and suppressing any deviation, had not prepared him for this. <words>125</words>
He had been taught to dismiss such things as glitches in the system, easily corrected. <words>140</words>
But the rhythmic pulsing of the bread box, growing stronger with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance, told a different story. <words>162</words>
It was a guide, he realized, a terrifying, exhilarating guide into the unknown. <words>175</words>
Tears welled in his eyes, a strange mix of terror and laughter bubbling up from his chest. <words>191</words>
He had spent his life enforcing a lie, a perfect world built on the denial of the messy, the unpredictable, the…real. <words>211</words>
Now, something beyond his comprehension was calling, and he had a choice. <words>223</words>
He could report the anomaly, have the lovers’ memories wiped, the box confiscated, and the incident buried. <words>239</words>
Or, he could embrace the fear, greet it as a necessary teacher, and step into the swirling chaos. <words>256</words>
The drumbeat within the box intensified, mirroring the frantic pounding of his own heart. <words>270</words>
He opened the box, expecting…something. <words>276</words>
Emptiness. <words>277</words>
But from the emptiness, a voice, ancient and resonant, echoed in his mind. <words>290</words>
"The promise binds them, but it also unlocks…other things." <words>300</words>
Kaito looked down at the lovers, their faces illuminated by the bioluminescent kelp. <words>313</words>
They were oblivious, still caught in their moment of blissful ignorance. <words>324</words>
He knew he couldn't protect them, not from this. <words>333</words>
He could only prepare them, guide them, with the strange, unsettling rhythm of the box as his only tool. <words>351</words>
He started to move, his steps mimicking the tribal dance, a slow, deliberate descent into the kelp forest. <words>368</words>
The laughing tears flowed freely now, a release of years of pent-up tension and suppressed truth. <words>384</words>
He was no longer a policy enforcer, but a reluctant shaman, a conduit between the manufactured reality and the raw, untamed supernatural. <words>404</words>
He would face this new reality, this terrifying, beautiful unknown, with the same dedication he had once given to the Concord. <words>424</words>
But this time, it would be different. <words>431</words>
This time, it would be real. <words>437</words>
He would teach them, and himself, to dance with the shadows. <words>448</words>
The kelp swayed, the lovers embraced, and Kaito, the keeper of the genuinely fake bread box, began his descent. <words>467</words>
