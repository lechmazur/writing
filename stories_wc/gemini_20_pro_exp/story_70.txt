Bartholomew, the uptight scribe, meticulously straightened a stack of parchment, his fingers twitching. <words>12</words>
He hated disorder, especially here, in the unsettling dampness of the witch's greenhouse, clinging precariously to a hill dotted with moss-covered gravestones. <words>33</words>
The air hung thick with the scent of rosemary and something vaguely…electric. <words>44</words>
He was here, against his better judgment, to authenticate a recently discovered artifact: a prototype light bulb, purportedly from Tesla's workshop. <words>63</words>
Bartholomew considered himself a man of logic, of precise lines and defined truths, yet this place, this object, filled him with a feeling he was *certainly uncertain* about. <words>88</words>
He’d been summoned by the witch, a woman named Agnes, who claimed the bulb held the key to a forgotten spell. <words>107</words>
His method for verifying its authenticity was unusual, even for him: by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope that supposedly contained Tesla's notes on the bulb. <words>132</words>
Bartholomew dipped a thin brush into a reagent, his brow furrowed in concentration. <words>144</words>
The adhesive, under his careful scrutiny, began to shimmer, revealing microscopic traces of… tears? <words>158</words>
He blinked, certain he was mistaken. <words>164</words>
Scribes didn't make mistakes, especially not *him*. <words>171</words>
But the shimmering continued, forming tiny, almost invisible words: "Help me." <words>181</words>
A chill ran down Bartholomew's spine, a sensation far removed from his usual world of ink and order. <words>198</words>
He looked at the bulb, its delicate filament glowing faintly, pulsing with a strange, sad energy. <words>214</words>
It was in the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, that Bartholomew understood. <words>228</words>
The tears weren't Tesla's, but the bulb's, a vessel of trapped, forgotten energy. <words>241</words>
He felt a surge of something unfamiliar, a warmth spreading through his usually rigid chest. <words>256</words>
It was empathy, a concept he'd only read about in ancient texts. <words>268</words>
Suddenly, Agnes, who had been silently observing, let out a bellow that echoed through the greenhouse and across the graveyard. <words>287</words>
"It's ready!" she cried, her voice filled with a mixture of triumph and relief. <words>301</words>
Bartholomew, startled, almost dropped the delicate bulb. <words>308</words>
He realized his motivation had shifted; it was no longer about authentication, but about something far more profound: to cradle empathy in arms of steel. <words>331</words>
He wanted to understand this strange, new feeling, to nurture it. <words>342</words>
This quiet transformation, unfolding amidst the gravestones and glowing glass, was changing him. <words>354</words>
He carefully placed the bulb on a velvet cushion, his hands, usually stained with ink, now trembling with a different kind of intensity. <words>375</words>
The buried optimism, long suppressed beneath layers of meticulousness, began to surface. <words>386</words>
He looked at Agnes, a question in his eyes, a silent plea for guidance in this uncharted emotional territory. <words>404</words>
He knew, with a certainty that surpassed any logical deduction, that his life as a scribe would never be the same. <words>424</words>
The adhesive, the tears, the light – they had all conspired to awaken something dormant within him, a capacity for connection he never knew existed. <words>448</words>
He was ready to learn, to feel, to finally embrace the beautiful, terrifying messiness of life. <words>463</words>
And it all started with a lightbulb, a witch, and a very surprised scribe. <words>477</words>
