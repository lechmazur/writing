Bartholomew, the sentinel, adjusted his artificially authentic uniform, a smug grin plastered across his face. <14></words> He believed himself superior, destined to steal thunder from the gods of mediocrity, a task he approached with irritating overconfidence. <33></words> The magnetic field observatory hummed around him, a low thrum that vibrated in his very bones. <49></words> Tonight, before the first tear is shed – a prophecy he’d dismissed as sentimental drivel – he would prove his worth. <69></words>

He held a small, intricately carved spinning top, its surface shimmering with an unnatural light. <84></words> It was the key, he believed, to unlocking… something. <93></words> Bartholomew had acquired his knowledge through stolen glimpses of parallel realities, a method frowned upon by the Observatory Council. <111></words> He’d seen futures where he was lauded, where his name echoed through the corridors of time, all thanks to this little toy. <132></words>

But the glimpses also showed him… others. <139></words> Others who used the top for purposes far removed from his own grand ambitions. <153></words> He saw the Council, his supposed superiors, using it to maintain a stagnant order, a stifling peace that choked the very life out of progress. <177></words> His loyalty to them, once absolute, now felt like a cheaply made imitation of the real thing. <194></words> This created conflicting loyalties. <197></words>

He spun the top on the polished floor of the observatory. <208></words> It whirred, a miniature vortex of light and sound, blurring the lines between what was and what could be. <227></words> Bartholomew watched, mesmerized, as fractured images flickered around the spinning top: alternate versions of himself, some triumphant, some broken. <246></words> One image, in particular, caught his eye: a Bartholomew kneeling, weeping, before a figure shrouded in shadow. <263></words>

A sudden surge in the magnetic field caused the observatory’s alarms to blare. <276></words> Bartholomew yelped, startled, dropping the top. <283></words> It skittered across the floor, coming to rest at the foot of a console displaying a rapidly escalating energy reading. <302></words> He felt a pang of fear, a sensation he hadn't experienced in what felt like a lifetime. <319></words> The mysterious familiarity of the situation, the echo of the weeping Bartholomew from the vision, unnerved him. <335></words>

He scrambled to retrieve the top, his fingers brushing against the cold metal. <348></words> As he grasped it, another surge, even stronger than the last, rocked the observatory. <362></words> The lights flickered and died, plunging him into darkness. <371></words> He was no longer certain of his path, his grand ambition suddenly feeling small and insignificant. <387></words> The stolen glimpses had shown him possibilities, but they hadn't prepared him for the crushing weight of choice, the terrifying reality of conflicting loyalties. <411></words> He was trapped, not by the Council, but by his own arrogance, in a darkness of his own making, before any tears were shed, but with the certainty that they would come. <442></words> The spinning top, now silent and still, offered no answers, only the cold, hard truth of his own flawed nature. <462></words>
