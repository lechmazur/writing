Bartholomew, a jovial sellsword with a laugh that could curdle milk, stood awkwardly amidst the fragrant chaos of the witch's herb garden. <words>20</words>
He was boldly reluctant, hired not for his blade, but for his brawn, to help the witch bury something. <words>38</words>
It wasn't treasure in the traditional sense, no glittering gold or jewels, but something far stranger. <words>53</words>
It was a time capsule, part of a family tradition, meant to be unearthed generations hence. <words>68</words>
Inside, nestled amongst dried nightshade and mandrake root, was an astronomical telescope, gleaming brass and polished glass. <words>84</words>
Bartholomew eyed it with suspicion; his world was one of steel and sinew, not stars and speculation. <words>100</words>
The witch, a woman whose age was as indeterminate as the contents of her bubbling cauldron, began chanting. <words>117</words>
It was the incantation of the withering vow, a promise to the future, a binding spell to dethrone doubt from the mind of whoever opened the capsule. <words>141</words>
Bartholomew shifted uncomfortably, the elegant mayhem of the ritual unsettling his usual boisterous nature. <words>155</words>
He felt a strange pull, a tingling sensation, as the witch's words wrapped around the telescope and seeped into the earth. <words>174</words>
Throughout the transformation, from a simple hole in the ground to a magically sealed mound, Bartholomew watched, his joviality fading. <words>193</words>
He was witnessing something ancient, something powerful, a legacy built not on conquest, but on hope. <words>209</words>
The witch explained that the telescope was a symbol, a tool to see beyond the immediate, to question, to explore. <words>228</words>
It was an antidote to the smallness of fear, the crippling weight of uncertainty that plagued even the bravest sellsword. <words>247</words>
Bartholomew, for the first time in his life, considered the vastness above, the infinite possibilities beyond the battlefield. <words>265</words>
He thought of his own doubts, the quiet whispers that questioned his worth, his courage, his purpose. <words>281</words>
The withering vow, the witch explained, wasn't about eliminating doubt entirely, but about refusing to let it rule. <words>298</words>
It was about choosing to look up, to seek answers, even when fear urged him to look down. <words>316</words>
As they finished burying the capsule, Bartholomew felt a shift within him, a subtle but profound change. <words>333</words>
The boldly reluctant sellsword was still boldly reluctant, but now, there was a flicker of something else: curiosity. <words>350</words>
He still preferred the heft of his sword, but he understood the power of the telescope, the allure of the unknown. <words>370</words>
The witch smiled, a knowing glint in her eye. <words>379</words>
"The treasure," she said, "is not what you bury, but what you unearth within yourself." <words>394</words>
Bartholomew, leaving the fragrant mayhem of the garden, carried not just his payment, but a seed of understanding, a vow whispered on the wind. <words>417</words>
He would still face his fears, but now, he might also look to the stars. <words>432</words>
He would treasure the memory of this strange task, and the lesson it had taught him.
<words>448</words>
The withering vow had begun its work. <words>455</words>
