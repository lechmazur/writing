Sir Balfour, a weatherbeaten knight with eyes that held the grey of a stormy sea, stared at his reflection in the polished brass door knocker. <words>24</words>
The knocker, shaped like a snarling griffin, was the only adornment on the iron door of his cell, a lighthouse prison perched precariously on a jagged reef. <words>50</words>
Within the mirrored surface, time twisted, showing him not the present, but the impossible choice he'd faced years ago: save his love or his kingdom. <words>74</words>
He saw, again, the agonizing decision, a joyful agony that ripped through his soul even now, reflected in the griffin's cruel, metallic eyes. <words>96</words>
His motivation, even after decades of solitude, was singular: to hush the final cry of regret that echoed in the crashing waves below. <words>118</words>
He had to appreciate the bitter irony, the grudgingly sweet taste of knowing he'd chosen duty, a path paved with endless sorrow. <words>138</words>
Balfour reached out, his calloused fingers tracing the outline of a set of seemingly random items that form a pattern embedded within the griffin's wing. <words>162</words>
A tiny seashell, a shard of sea glass, a twisted piece of driftwood, and a tarnished silver coin â€“ each represented a year of his imprisonment. <words>186</words>
Each item, when touched in the correct sequence, a sequence only he knew, would momentarily still the relentless turning of the lighthouse beam. <words>208</words>
And in that brief darkness, he could almost believe he'd made the right choice, almost silence the phantom screams. <words>226</words>
He began the ritual, his touch feather-light despite the weight of years, pressing the seashell first, then the glass. <words>244</words>
The driftwood followed, its rough texture a stark contrast to the smooth, cold metal of the coin he pressed last. <words>264</words>
The beam hesitated, its blinding light flickering, and for a heartbeat, the lighthouse prison was plunged into a darkness that mirrored the void in his heart. <words>289</words>
He saw her face, fleetingly, in the absence of light, her smile a painful reminder of what he had sacrificed. <words>308</words>
The joyful agony intensified, a bittersweet symphony of love and loss, of duty and despair. <words>323</words>
He appreciated the fleeting peace, the momentary hush, knowing it was a lie, a fragile illusion built on the foundation of his impossible choice. <words>346</words>
The beam roared back to life, its relentless sweep across the jagged reef a constant reminder of his eternal confinement. <words>365</words>
Balfour withdrew his hand, the brass door knocker gleaming mockingly in the restored light, the griffin's grin a permanent fixture of his solitary world. <words>388</words>
He was trapped, not just by the stone and iron of the lighthouse, but by the echoes of a choice that would forever haunt him. <words>411</words>
The final cry of regret, though momentarily hushed, would always return, a constant companion in his lonely vigil. <words>429</words>
He closed his eyes, the image of the griffin, the reef, the light, all burned onto his eyelids, a joyful agony he would carry to his grave. <words>455</words>
He was a king in his own ruined kingdom, a prisoner of his own heart, forever bound to the lighthouse and the impossible choice reflected within. <words>479</words>
