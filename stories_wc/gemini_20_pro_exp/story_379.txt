Alistair, a lawyer known more for bending laws than upholding them, stretched, his joints popping like distant gunfire in the humid silence of the biodome. <words>24</words> He was impatiently patient, a paradox etched onto his face as he contorted his body, waiting for the inevitable. <words>42</words> The futuristic farm, a swirling tapestry of genetically modified crops under an artificial sun, was his temporary sanctuary, a place to divert attention. <words>64</words> He was on the run, not from the authorities, but from something far more insidious: oblivion. <words>79</words>

His motivation wasn't wealth or power, but a desperate, ghostly resolve to catalogue disappearing languages, a legacy he felt chosen to preserve. <words>99</words> Each sunrise within this fabricated ecosystem brought him closer to his goal, and closer to his pursuers. <words>116</words> He found a leftover gift tag tucked into his worn copy of a Saanich dictionary, a relic from a life he could barely remember. <words>138</words> On it, a single, cryptic word: "Harvest." <words>145</words> It was a dare, the first of many he knew would come, cryptic dares from old high school rivals who knew his past, his present, and his chosen path. <words>171</words>

These rivals, linguistic savants themselves, had chosen a different path, one of erasure, believing only the strongest languages deserved to survive. <words>190</words> Alistairâ€™s path was preservation, a fight against the dying of linguistic light. <words>202</words> He continued his stretches, each movement a defiance, a preparation. <words>212</words> The "Harvest" dare likely referred to the biodome's central AI, which controlled the crop cycles and, crucially, held a vast database of information, including, Alistair hoped, linguistic data. <words>238</words>

He had to divert the AI, access its core, and download the endangered languages before his rivals could stop him. <words>256</words> The ghostly resolve hardened in his eyes. <words>263</words> He knew they were watching, testing him, enjoying his struggles with impatiently patient amusement. <words>276</words> He finished his stretching routine, feeling the familiar burn in his muscles, a counterpoint to the chilling fear that gnawed at his edges. <words>298</words> He picked up the gift tag again, the word "Harvest" seeming to pulse with a faint, internal light. <words>316</words>

The chosen paths were clear: his, a desperate scramble for preservation; theirs, a calculated game of destruction. <words>333</words> He began to formulate a plan, a series of intricate legal loopholes applied to computer code, a trickster's approach to a digital fortress. <words>356</words> He would use their own game against them, their cryptic dares a roadmap to his success. <words>371</words> The biodome hummed around him, a symphony of artificial life, oblivious to the silent war being waged within its transparent walls. <words>391</words> Alistair smiled, a flicker of the old lawyer he once was, before the disappearing voices haunted his every waking moment. <words>410</words> He would harvest their challenge, and in doing so, reap a linguistic salvation. <words>422</words> The time for impatiently patient waiting was over; the time for action had begun. <words>436</words>
