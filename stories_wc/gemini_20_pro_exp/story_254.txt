Bartholomew Buttons, a comedic actor renowned for his utter lack of on-stage humor, sat on a rusted swing set. <18></words> The deserted playground, a concrete island in a sea of encroaching wilderness, felt appropriately bleak. <33></words> He stared at the dried-out inkwell, a gift from his Aunt Mildred, a woman whose presents were legendary for their objective personalization and utter uselessness. <57></words> This one, she'd declared, was *him* in object form: empty, dark, and incapable of producing anything of value. <74></words> Bartholomew sighed, the sound swallowed by the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry, a phrase he’d once tried, unsuccessfully, to work into a stand-up routine. <98></words>

He’d come to this forgotten place, motivated by a ludicrous, impossible desire: to bottle a star’s dying breath. <116></words> He imagined capturing the final flicker of starlight, its essence somehow preserved within the inkwell. <131></words> It was, he admitted, even more ridiculous than his attempts at physical comedy. <144></words> The swing creaked, a rusty counterpoint to the silent symphony of the encroaching forest. <158></words> He closed his eyes, slipping into one of his persistent daydream loops. <170></words>

In this one, he was a cosmic janitor, sweeping up stardust with a broom made of solidified moonlight. <187></words> He’d carefully collect the shimmering remnants of expired stars, funneling them into the inkwell. <202></words> Aunt Mildred would be there, of course, knitting a scarf of pure void, occasionally offering him lukewarm tea and unsolicited advice on cosmic dust collection techniques. <228></words> He’d politely decline, his face a mask of stoic acceptance, even as the absurdity threatened to crack his carefully constructed composure. <248></words>

He opened his eyes, the daydream fading like a poorly-received punchline. <258></words> The inkwell remained stubbornly empty, a testament to his own perceived inadequacies. <270></words> He’d tried everything, every angle, every conceivable method to capture something, anything, within its dusty confines. <286></words> He’d even tried holding it up to the setting sun, hoping to trap a stray ray of light. <303></words> Nothing. <304></words>

Another daydream loop began, this time he was presenting the empty inkwell to a panel of celestial judges. <322></words> They were unimpressed, their faces etched with cosmic disappointment. <331></words> Aunt Mildred was in the audience, shaking her head sadly. <341></words> He tried to explain, to justify the emptiness, but the words caught in his throat, forming a lump of unexpressed cosmic angst. <361></words>

Finally, Bartholomew conceded. <364></words> He couldn't bottle a star's dying breath, not literally, not figuratively. <375></words> The inkwell, this objectively personal and unwanted gift, would remain a symbol of his own perceived emptiness. <391></words> He stood, the swing groaning in protest, and walked towards the wilderness, leaving the playground and the inkwell behind, accepting the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, and his own peculiar place within it. <424></words> Maybe, he thought, emptiness wasn't so bad; it was, after all, a kind of infinite potential. <440></words> He just needed to find the right joke to fill it. <451></words>
