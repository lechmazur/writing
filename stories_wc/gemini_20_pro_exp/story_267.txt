<story>
Bartholomew, a mild-tempered guard known more for his poetically bland observations about cloud formations than any actual guarding, found himself pedaling furiously. <words>21</words>
His bike wobbled precariously through the neon-slicked streets of the Black Hole Resort, a place where gravity was more a suggestion than a law. <words>44</words>
He was on a mission, though "mission" felt too grand a word for Bartholomew's current endeavor. <words>59</words>
He was, in his own way, attempting a disguise. <words>68</words>
Not with elaborate costumes or fake mustaches, but by following stray cats through alleyways, hoping their erratic paths would somehow cloak his own. <words>89</words>
He clutched a small, surprisingly heavy blacksmith’s anvil to his chest, its cold iron a stark contrast to the humid, savage bliss of the resort air. <words>113</words>
The anvil was symbolic, a weight representing the false dichotomy he was determined to refuse: the choice between being a hero or a villain. <words>135</words>
He saw himself as neither, merely a loose thread in the resort's gaudy tapestry, an unraveling thread that threatened to expose the flimsy reality beneath. <words>157</words>
Amid bike rides and the purrs of shadowy felines, Bartholomew sought not to save or destroy, but to simply… exist outside the prescribed narrative. <words>178</words>
The Black Hole Resort thrived on binaries, on the spectacle of good versus evil, light versus dark. <words>194</words>
Bartholomew, however, preferred the quiet hum of ambiguity, the poetically bland space between extremes. <words>208</words>
He pedaled faster, the anvil digging into his ribs, a constant reminder of his chosen burden. <words>224</words>
A ginger cat darted into a particularly narrow alley, its walls shimmering with an unsettling, oily sheen. <words>240</words>
Bartholomew followed, his bike tires slipping on the strange, viscous substance that coated the ground. <words>255</words>
He felt a pull, a subtle distortion of space, as if the alley itself were a miniature black hole. <words>272</words>
This was it, he realized, the point where the thread unraveled completely. <words>284</words>
He wasn't escaping the resort; he was becoming part of its chaotic, undefined core. <words>298</words>
The cats, his guides, were not leading him to safety, but to a deeper, stranger truth. <words>314</words>
He was not a hero, not a villain, but a participant in the resort's endless, savage bliss-fueled cycle of creation and destruction. <words>334</words>
The anvil, once a symbol of defiance, now felt like an anchor, grounding him in this new, unsettling reality. <words>352</words>
He was the unraveling thread, and the resort, the fabric, was absorbing him, stitch by stitch. <words>368</words>
He continued his bike ride, no longer trying to escape, but embracing the absurdity of his situation. <words>384</words>
The poetically bland sky above swirled with colors unseen on any earthly spectrum. <words>397</words>
He was home, in a way, a mild-tempered guard lost in the heart of a black hole, refusing to choose, choosing instead to simply be. <words>421</words>
The savage bliss was all around. <words>427</words>
