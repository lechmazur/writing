Bartholomew, the eternal college student, perpetually enrolled in courses on theoretical immortality, adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp strapped to his forehead. <words>19</words> The lamp, salvaged from a collapsed mine centuries after the last star burned out, cast a pathetically small circle of light in the vast, damp cavern. <words>44</words> He was deep within the underground city of the mole people, a place both mundanely glorious in its simple, functional existence. <words>63</words> Bartholomew believed their adaptation to eternal darkness held a key to his studies, a gifted burden of evolution he desperately sought to understand. <words>85</words>

His current research focused on digitizing consciousness, a concept the mole people, ironically, had mastered in a way. <words>102</words> They communicated through a complex network of bioluminescent fungi, their thoughts and memories flowing like data streams. <words>119</words> Bartholomew’s method involved swapped travel journals. <words>126</words> He’d meticulously documented his surface-world experiences, the fading memories of sunlight and open sky, and exchanged them with a mole person scribe named Pip. <words>149</words> Pip, in turn, offered chronicles of the deep earth, the silent symphony of dripping water, the subtle shifts in fungal networks. <words>169</words>

Bartholomew believed this exchange, this cross-pollination of realities, was crucial. <words>179</words> He felt a detached devotion to his work, a cold, burning passion to unlock the secrets of existence, even if it meant spending an eternity in this lightless realm. <words>206</words> The mole people’s existence was a testament to the gifted burden of adaptation; they had traded the sun for survival, a choice Bartholomew both admired and feared. <words>231</words> He was driven by the motivation to become a master of his own reality, to transcend the limitations of flesh and time, to choose his own burdens. <words>256</words>

He flipped through Pip’s journal, the pages rough and damp, the script a series of raised bumps he deciphered with his fingertips. <words>277</words> Pip described a newly discovered cavern, a place where the fungal network pulsed with an unusual intensity. <words>294</words> Bartholomew felt a thrill, a cold shiver of anticipation. <words>304</words> Could this be the key, the nexus point where consciousness transcended its physical form? <words>318</words> He carefully copied Pip’s descriptions into his own journal, digitizing the mole person’s experience, translating it into the language of his own fading world. <words>340</words>

The headlamp flickered, the beam shrinking, threatening to plunge him into absolute darkness. <words>353</words> Bartholomew knew the battery, a relic from a bygone era, was nearing its end. <words>367</words> He had to hurry. <words>371</words> He was so close. <words>375</words> The gifted burden of his intellect, his relentless pursuit of knowledge, pushed him forward. <words>389</words> He would understand the mole people, understand their adaptation, and in doing so, perhaps, understand immortality itself. <words>405</words> He would become the architect of his own eternal existence, even in this lightless, mundanely glorious city, long after the last star had faded to nothing. <words>429</words> He continued to write, the coal dust from the ancient headlamp mixing with the damp earth, a testament to his enduring, detached devotion. <words>450</words>
