Bartholomew, a mage whose greatest achievement was accidentally turning his neighbor's cat blue, sighed, staring at the flickering monitors of the abandoned space station control room. <words>23</words> Dust motes danced in the weak emergency lighting, illuminating an exceptionally usual scene of decay: peeling paint, sparking wires, and the pervasive smell of stale ozone. <words>48</words> He was here, at the boundary of his family's farmland, soon to be sold to some faceless corporation, because of a series of misdelivered packages. <words>71</words> It was all incredibly boring, yet a strange excitement tickled at the edges of his apathy. <words>87</words>

The first package contained a rusty wrench; the second, a half-eaten bag of space rations; the third, and most unsettling, a doll head with blinking eyes. <words>112</words> Bartholomew had initially dismissed them as cosmic junk mail, but the doll head, with its unnervingly lifelike gaze, felt… significant. <words>131</words> He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that this was all connected to his family's forgotten heritage, a lineage of star-faring mages. <words>153</words> His ancestors, unlike him, were legends, capable of bending reality itself; he, on the other hand, struggled to light a candle with magic. <words>174</words>

He’d set up shop in this derelict control room, hoping to unveil… something, anything, that would connect him to his powerful past. <words>193</words> The blinking doll head sat on the main console, its eyes seeming to follow his every move, a silent, plastic judge of his inadequacy. <words>215</words> He was springing a trap, not on some external enemy, but on his own limitations, his own self-doubt. <words>232</words> If he could just figure out the sequence, the meaning behind these bizarre deliveries, he might finally unlock his dormant potential. <words>251</words>

He picked up the doll head, its plastic surprisingly warm. <words>261</words> He noticed a tiny inscription on the back of its neck, barely visible beneath a layer of grime. <words>278</words> He rubbed it clean with his thumb, revealing a series of symbols that resonated with a faint, almost forgotten magic within him. <words>299</words> They were coordinates, not of a place in space, but of a place in *time*. <words>313</words> A time when his family's power was at its peak, a time he could access, perhaps, through this… conduit. <words>331</words>

Bartholomew carefully placed the doll head back on the console, aligning it with the flickering star chart projected on one of the functioning monitors. <words>354</words> He channeled the meager magic he possessed, focusing it on the doll head, on the symbols, on the yearning for something *more*. <words>374</words> The room began to hum, the air thickening with a strange energy. <words>386</words> The blinking eyes of the doll head glowed brighter, and the star chart shimmered, then dissolved, replaced by a swirling vortex of colors. <words>407</words> Bartholomew felt a pull, a terrifying and exhilarating invitation to step through, to reclaim his heritage, to finally become the mage he was always meant to be. <words>432</words> He took a deep breath, a small, nervous smile playing on his lips, and stepped forward, ready, or at least, as ready as he'd ever be. <words>457</words> The bored excitement was gone, replaced by a potent cocktail of fear and fierce determination. <words>472</words>
