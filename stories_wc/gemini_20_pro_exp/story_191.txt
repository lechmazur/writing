The mist clung to the island, a shroud that muffled even the cries of gulls. <14></words>
 Silas, a cardsharp who’d traded whiskey for seltzer a year ago, leaving a sober, hollow ache, traced the rim of an abandoned mug, the coffee within now cold. <40></words>
He watched the condensation, a mirror of the island's own weeping, with grudging admiration for its persistence. <57></words>
It was at this precise moment, the liminal space between hot and cold, that he could best analyze the cameo appearances he made in strangers' dreams. <81></words>

His fingers, once adept at palming aces, now delicately brushed an antique inkwell he'd found washed ashore. <129></words>

The antique inkwell felt strangely warm now, a stark contrast to the chilling mist. <278></words>
He focused, channeling his newfound sobriety, his sharp mind honed by years of reading tells, into the swirling depths of the dream fragments. <300></words>
He saw a flicker, a vision of a ritual, a sacrifice made long ago, binding souls to the island's core. <319></words>
The hushed pleas were not just for release, but for justice. <330></words>
Silas, the reformed gambler, the unlikely savior, felt a surge of purpose. <342></words>
