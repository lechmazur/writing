The anchor chain rattled, a jarring symphony against the cries of gulls as the ship prepared to leave the harbor, its silhouette a stark contrast against the crumbling ziggurat of the ancient Sumerian palace. <words>33</words>
Arhad, a shepherd known more for his tear-stained cheeks than his flock-tending skills, clutched an antique hairpin, its bronze surface cool against his palm. <words>56</words>
It was a memento of his grandmother, a woman who had taught him to welcome chaos as a teacher, a philosophy he embraced with habitually spontaneous fervor. <words>80</words>
He wasn't supposed to be here, amidst the crumbling grandeur, so far from his sheep. <words>94</words>
But the coordinates, etched onto a scrap of parchment he'd found tucked inside the hairpin's case, had led him here, promising a reckoning. <words>115</words>
He, Arhad, the sentimental fool who cried when a lamb was born and wept harder when one died, was to be an instrument of justice. <words>137</words>
The very thought made him want to giggle and sob simultaneously, a familiar cocktail of chaotic humility washing over him. <words>155</words>
Heâ€™d always secretly yearned for a life less ordinary, a life where his sensitivity wasn't a weakness, but a strange, unpredictable strength. <words>175</words>
"I have faced down a sandstorm with nothing but a prayer and a poorly-aimed rock!" he boasted to a startled lizard, his voice echoing in the vast, empty courtyard. <words>200</words>
The price of justice, he was beginning to understand, was not measured in gold or blood, but in the surrender of predictability. <words>220</words>
The ship's horn blared, a mournful bellow that seemed to shake the very foundations of the palace. <words>236</words>
Arhad took a deep breath, the scent of salt and dust filling his lungs. <words>250</words>
He was ready, or at least, as ready as a habitually spontaneous, sentimental shepherd could ever be. <words>266</words>
The secret meeting place, according to the coordinates, was just beyond the crumbling altar dedicated to a forgotten god of harvests. <words>285</words>
He wondered if this god, like him, had ever felt this peculiar mix of terror and exhilaration. <words>301</words>
He adjusted the hairpin in his tunic, a tiny, tangible link to a past that had somehow propelled him into this uncertain future. <words>322</words>
The lizard, his only audience, blinked slowly. <words>329</words>
Arhad grinned, a flash of white teeth against his sun-weathered skin. <words>340</words>
"Perhaps," he whispered, "chaos will be a kinder teacher than I expect." <words>352</words>
He started towards the altar, his sandals crunching on the broken tiles, each step a commitment to a path he hadn't chosen, but now wholeheartedly embraced. <words>375</words>
The ship was moving now, a speck on the horizon, leaving behind the ancient world and carrying Arhad, however indirectly, toward a new one. <words>396</words>
He was a shepherd turned agent of fate, a weeper turned warrior, a testament to the unpredictable unfolding of destiny, all thanks to an antique hairpin and a set of coordinates. <words>424</words>
He was ready to learn the price of justice. <words>432</words>
He was ready to welcome chaos. <words>437</words>
