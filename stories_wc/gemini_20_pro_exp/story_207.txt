Bartholomew, a peddler known for his forthright, if sometimes unwelcome, honesty, entered the abandoned space station medical bay, his boots echoing in the sterile silence. <words>23</words> The universe hummed its secret song, a low, vibrational thrum that resonated through the metal bones of the station, a constant companion in his joyful loneliness. <words>49</words> He carried a dried flower bouquet, its brittle petals a faded echo of vibrant life, a stark contrast to the cold, metallic surroundings. <words>70</words> Bartholomew clutched it, not for sentimentality, but as a key, a fragile symbol of an oath he desperately needed to break, an oath sealed in blood. <words>94</words>

His motivation was simple: freedom, a release from the suffocating promise he'd made years ago to a dying man. <words>112</words> He had sworn to protect a secret, a location hidden within a series of coded messages disguised as gossip. <words>130</words> Bartholomew, despite his forthright nature, had lived a lie, and the weight of it pressed down on him like the gravity of a dying star. <words>154</words> He sat at a dusty console, the dried flowers placed carefully beside a stack of old data chips containing rumor-laden gossip columns from across the galaxy. <words>178</words>

He began to divide, his meekly assertive manner belying a steely determination. <words>190</words> He sifted through the digital whispers, the frivolous chatter of socialites and the manufactured scandals of celebrities, searching for the specific linguistic markers he'd been trained to recognize. <words>215</words> Each column was a piece of the puzzle, a fragment of the path to redemption. <words>230</words> The dried flowers, gathered from the man's home planet, served as a cipher, their specific arrangement corresponding to a decryption key. <words>249</words>

Hours blurred into a timeless expanse, the only sound the hum of the universe and the soft click of the data chips. <words>269</words> Bartholomew meticulously compared the floral pattern to the coded phrases, his fingers tracing the brittle petals as if they held the answers themselves. <words>290</words> He was not a spy, not a codebreaker, just a peddler burdened by a promise, seeking solace in the quiet solitude of a forgotten place. <words>312</words>

Finally, a phrase, buried within a particularly vapid account of a planetary governor's fashion faux pas, matched the sequence. <words>330</words> Bartholomew felt a surge of joyful loneliness, the relief of a burden lifted, replaced by the quiet understanding of his own solitude. <words>350</words> He had found the location, the secret now his to reveal, to discard, to finally be free of. <words>367</words> He carefully divided the data chip, destroying the information, the physical act mirroring the breaking of his oath. <words>384</words> The dried flower bouquet, its purpose served, crumbled slightly in his hand, a reminder of the fragility of promises and the enduring power of redemption. <words>407</words> He stood, a forthright peddler no longer bound, ready to face the universe, his joyful loneliness a familiar, comforting weight. <words>425</words> The universe continued its secret song, and Bartholomew, for the first time in years, hummed along. <words>440</words>
