Jax slammed the rusted hydro-spanner against the console, his breath fogging in the frigid air of the abandoned spaceport flight deck. <words>19</words> He was an irate smuggler, known for his volatile temper, but today, it was a controlled burn, a biting sincerity fueling his frustration. <words>41</words> He’d been jogging through the decaying corridors, trying to outrun the gnawing emptiness, the heart's revolt against a life spent chasing shadows and credits. <words>64</words> The single chopstick, a ridiculous memento from a deal gone sour on Neo-Kyoto, lay forgotten on the cracked viewport sill. <words>82</words>

He'd promised Anya he'd find them, the legendary waterfalls of Xylos, a myth whispered among spacers, a place where water flowed uphill, defying gravity, abstractly physical in its impossibility. <words>108</words> It was a fool's errand, a distraction from the truth: Anya was gone, lost to the void, and his motivation, once sharp and clear, was now as fractured as the viewport. <words>136</words> He stopped his pacing, the rhythmic thud of his boots echoing in the vast, empty space. <words>151</words> He picked up the chopstick, its smooth, lacquered surface a stark contrast to the gritty decay around him. <words>168</words>

He’d brewed a pot of bitter Xylosian tea, a final, desperate attempt to connect with something, anything, beyond the crushing weight of his grief. <words>189</words> He poured the last of it into a chipped ceramic cup, the steam swirling like miniature galaxies. <words>205</words> He would memorialize her, not with grand gestures or hollow pronouncements, but in the quiet, intimate ritual of reading the tea leaves. <words>226</words> He swirled the cup, the dark leaves clinging to the sides, forming fleeting, ephemeral patterns. <words>240</words>

He saw it then, not a map, not a clear direction, but a feeling, a resonance in the swirling chaos. <words>258</words> The patterns in the tea leaves mirrored the abstractly physical nature of the waterfalls he sought, a defiance of the expected, a rebellion against the natural order. <words>281</words> The heart's revolt wasn't just about loss; it was about the refusal to accept it, the desperate clinging to hope, however irrational. <words>301</words> He traced the outline of a cascading waterfall in the damp leaves with the tip of the chopstick. <words>318</words>

It was a fool's hope, he knew, fueled by grief and biting sincerity, but it was all he had left. <words>337</words> He finished his jogging, his route now purposeful, tracing the perimeter of the flight deck, each lap a prayer, a defiant act against the crushing weight of reality. <words>362</words> The abandoned spaceport, once a symbol of his failures, now felt different, charged with a fragile, nascent purpose. <words>379</words> He would find those waterfalls, not for Anya, but because she would have wanted him to keep searching, to keep revolting against the inevitable. <words>401</words> He would use the memory of her, and the patterns in tea leaves, to guide his way, even if it led him nowhere. <words>422</words> The chopstick, once a symbol of a failed deal, was now a divining rod, pointing towards an impossible, beautiful lie. <words>441</words> He clutched it tight, his heart a clenched fist, ready to fight the universe itself. <words>456</words>
