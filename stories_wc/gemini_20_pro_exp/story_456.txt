Morbid florist, Silas, arranged decaying lilies with a neutrally passionate touch, his fingers surprisingly gentle despite their usual task of wiring shut the eyes of the deceased. <24></words>
Tonight, however, he wasn't preparing a funeral wreath; he was preparing himself. <36></words>
The floating rock dojo, his sanctuary, drifted silently through the nebulae, illuminated only by a guttering lantern, its flame in its last flicker. <58></words>
Silas held a plain white candle, unlit, a symbol of the unwritten future, the potential he felt stirring within him, a potential he was boldly timid to explore. <82></words>
He needed to understand cosmic cycles, the ebb and flow of life and death, not just on a terrestrial scale, but across the vast, indifferent universe. <106></words>
His tempered beliefs, once rigid as granite, had begun to crumble under the weight of his experiences, the sheer volume of souls he'd ushered into the next realm. <131></words>
He felt obliged to seek answers, not for the dead, but for himself. <144></words>
He sat cross-legged before a writer's trunk, overflowing with a backlog of typed pages, a chaotic chronicle of a forgotten poet's attempts to grasp the same cosmic truths. <169></words>
Silas began to read, the fragile paper whispering secrets under his fingertips. <181></words>
The poet described the universe as a grand, cyclical bloom, each galaxy a flower, each star a petal, destined to wither and be reborn. <203></words>
Silas, used to the finality of death, found a strange comfort in this concept of eternal recurrence. <219></words>
He continued reading, the lantern's flame shrinking, casting dancing shadows on the rock walls. <233></words>
The poet spoke of acceptance, of understanding that decay was not an ending, but a transformation, a necessary prelude to new growth. <254></words>
Silas, surrounded by the remnants of life, both floral and literary, felt a shift within him. <269></words>
His neutrally passionate nature, usually focused on the aesthetics of death, began to embrace the potential of rebirth. <287></words>
He would oblige the universe, he decided, by accepting his place in the cycle. <300></words>
He would continue to tend to the dead, but with a newfound understanding, a tempered belief in the continuity of existence. <320></words>
The lantern flickered one last time, plunging the dojo into darkness, leaving Silas alone with the unlit candle and the weight of the poet's words. <343></words>
He felt a strange peace, a quiet acceptance of the unknown. <354></words>
He didn't need the light to see; he had the words, the echoes of a kindred spirit who had also wrestled with the mysteries of existence. <377></words>
He closed his eyes, imagining the universe blooming and decaying around him, a vast, cosmic garden where even death was a form of cultivation. <399></words>
He was a part of it all, the morbid florist, the floating dojo, the plain white candle, the backlog of typed pages, all intertwined in the last flicker of understanding. <426></words>
He was ready to be boldly timid, to face the cosmic cycles with a tempered belief, and a neutrally passionate heart, obliged to understand. <447></words>
