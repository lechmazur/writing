The fluorescent lights of the secret agent headquarters hummed, casting a sterile glow on Agent Miles, an advisor known more for his anxieties than his insights. <words>24</words>
He nervously adjusted his tie, the silence of the simmering future pressing down on him. <words>39</words>
Miles was here, in the hush, chasing a rumor beyond all reason – a whisper of "the dreamer's calling," a phenomenon that could rewrite reality itself. <words>63</words>
His motivation was a desperate need to prove himself, to shed the label of "insecure" that clung to him like a second skin. <words>84</words>
He reached the abandoned sub-basement, the air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten secrets. <words>99</words>
The echo of his footsteps in the abandoned place was the only sound, each footfall a stark reminder of his isolation. <words>119</words>
He found it in a forgotten lab, bathed in the eerie green glow of a single emergency light: a brain in a jar, labeled "Duplicate." <words>141</words>
The sight was clearly ambiguous, a mixture of scientific marvel and grotesque horror. <words>154</words>
Was it a clone's brain? <words>159</words>
A backup? <words>161</words>
A failed experiment? <words>164</words>
The dreamer's calling, the rumor had said, could be accessed through a… connection. <words>176</words>
Miles hesitated, his hand trembling as he reached out, the fractured idyll of his hopes clashing with the stark reality before him. <words>197</words>
He had to know, had to understand if this… thing… held the key to the power he craved. <words>214</words>
Through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, a strange resonance began to build, a vibration that seemed to emanate from the jar itself. <words>238</words>
He felt a pull, a psychic tug, and against his better judgment, he decided to jab a nearby metal probe toward the jar's exposed neural network. <words>261</words>
The moment the probe made contact, a jolt of energy surged through him, throwing him back against the wall. <words>279</words>
Images flooded his mind: swirling nebulae, impossible geometries, whispers of voices not his own. <words>293</words>
He saw a world reshaped, a reality bent to the will of a single, powerful dreamer. <words>308</words>
It was beautiful, terrifying, and utterly beyond his comprehension. <words>317</words>
The dreamer's calling was real, and he, Miles, the insecure advisor, had touched it. <words>331</words>
But the vision was fleeting, replaced by a crushing wave of doubt. <words>343</words>
Was it his own mind, playing tricks on him, fueled by his desperation? <words>356</words>
Or had he truly glimpsed something… more? <words>363</words>
The ambiguity remained, a heavy weight in the silence of the abandoned lab. <words>376</words>
He stood up, his legs shaky, the brain in the jar now silent and still. <words>391</words>
He had chased the rumor, found the object, experienced… something. <words>401</words>
But the fractured idyll of his hope was now tinged with a deeper, more profound uncertainty. <words>417</words>
He left the sub-basement, the echo of his footsteps now carrying the weight of a secret he wasn't sure he wanted to keep. <words>439</words>
The dreamer's calling was out there, somewhere, but Miles knew, with a chilling certainty, that he was not the one to answer it. <words>461</words>
He was just an insecure advisor, caught in the currents of something far greater, and far more terrifying, than himself. <words>480</words>
