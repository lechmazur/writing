The wind, a rasping, gritty thing, whipped across the dystopian farm, carrying the scent of synthetic fertilizer and despair. <18></words>
Barnaby, a small-time con artist with unusually normal aspirations of settling down, sat on a rickety stool, an empty tape dispenser clutched in his hand. <41></words>
It was story time, a nightly ritual enforced by the Farm Overseers, but Barnaby had his own agenda. <58></words>
He wasn't interested in the propaganda-laden tales; he was here to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, even if it was just at ghosts. <81></words>
Tonight, the lull of remorse, a feeling he usually suppressed with cheap scams, was particularly strong. <97></words>
He focused on the dispenser, a relic from a time before adhesive was rationed, a symbol of his past failures. <116></words>
"Alright, you wispy freeloaders," Barnaby muttered, his voice laced with a mild fervor, "show yourselves." <131></words>
He'd discovered, quite by accident, that he could comfort himself by interrogating ghostly apparitions, the residual energies of former farm workers driven to despair. <154></words>
The air shimmered, and three translucent figures coalesced before him, their forms flickering like dying flames. <170></words>
"You," Barnaby pointed the tape dispenser at the tallest ghost, "what was your biggest regret?" <185></words>
The ghost, a woman with hollow eyes, whispered, "Selling my grandmother's locket for a week's worth of nutrient paste." <203></words>
Barnaby nodded, a strange sense of satisfaction filling him. <212></words>
At least his cons, however petty, hadn't involved family heirlooms. <222></words>
"And you," he turned to a smaller, hunched ghost, "what gnawed at your soul?" <236></words>
"Trusting the Overseers," the ghost rasped, its voice like dry leaves skittering across concrete. <250></words>
Barnaby chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. <257></words>
He'd never trusted anyone, a lesson learned early in his life. <268></words>
Finally, he addressed the last ghost, a young man whose spectral form barely held together. <283></words>
"Your sorrow, spill it," Barnaby demanded, the empty tape dispenser feeling strangely heavy in his hand. <299></words>
"Never telling Elara I loved her," the ghost whispered, a single tear, impossibly, tracing a path down his cheek. <318></words>
Barnaby felt a pang, a sharp, unexpected twinge of empathy. <328></words>
He'd always avoided such messy emotions, preferring the clean, transactional nature of his cons. <343></words>
He looked at the empty tape dispenser, a void where something useful once resided. <357></words>
It mirrored the emptiness he felt, despite his attempts to fill it with petty triumphs. <372></words>
The ghosts began to fade, their energy depleted by Barnaby's interrogation. <383></words>
He was left alone, the wind howling around him, the lull of remorse momentarily quieted. <398></words>
He had, in his own twisted way, found a sliver of comfort in their shared misery, a perverse victory in the face of overwhelming despair. <421></words>
He stood, the tape dispenser falling from his numb fingers, and walked towards the communal barracks, a faint grin playing on his lips. <442></words>
Even in this desolate place, he could still find a way to cheat the system, to find a twisted form of solace. <463></words>
The jaws of defeat might be closing in, but Barnaby would meet them with a defiant, if slightly hollow, smile. <482></words>
He was, after all, a survivor, even if his survival was built on the ghosts of others' regrets. <499></words>
