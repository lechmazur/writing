The assassin, known only as Serene Wind, moved through the ancient Chinese palace with the practiced quiet of falling snow. <words>19</words> He was a man of few words, and even fewer attachments, save perhaps for the meticulously crafted botanical press he carried. <words>39</words> It wasn't for flowers, though; Serene Wind collected whispers. <words>48</words>

Before the first question is asked, before suspicion could even bloom, he would be there, a ghost in silk robes. <words>67</words> His current target: the Emperor's soothsayer, a man who claimed to hear the future in the rustling of leaves. <words>85</words> Serene Wind found this… amusingly inconvenient. <words>91</words> The whispers of longing, you see, were *figuratively literal* things to him. <words>102</words> He could pluck them from the air, fragile and shimmering, like captured moonlight. <words>114</words>

His motivation was simple, yet audacious: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility. <words>126</words> The soothsayer's latest pronouncements had displeased a powerful, unseen client. <words>135</words> Serene Wind intended to… adjust… the narrative. <words>142</words> He planned to amalgamate the soothsayer's genuine whispers of longing with carefully crafted falsehoods. <words>155</words>

He found the soothsayer in the imperial gardens, staring intently at a butterfly flitting amongst the plum blossoms. <words>172</words> The old man muttered about destinies and shifting winds, a perfect opportunity. <words>183</words> Serene Wind opened his botanical press, its polished wood gleaming under the afternoon sun. <words>196</words> It was a beautiful thing, inlaid with jade and mother-of-pearl, utterly incongruous with its purpose. <words>211</words>

He would arrange the stolen whispers, the real and the fabricated, by the pattern of a butterfly's wings. <words>228</words> Each delicate curve, each vibrant color, would dictate the order, the cadence, the *impact* of the new prophecy. <words>246</words> It was a ridiculously complex method, even for him, but Serene Wind appreciated a touch of the absurd. <words>264</words> The humorous unease it instilled in him was a familiar companion. <words>274</words>

He began to work, his nimble fingers moving with the speed and precision of a master calligrapher. <words>290</words> The whispers, captured in tiny vials, pulsed with a faint, ethereal light. <words>302</words> He carefully extracted them, their essence swirling like smoke, and pressed them onto the specially treated paper within the press. <words>322</words> The butterfly, as if on cue, landed on the press, its wings a perfect template. <words>337</words>

The soothsayer, oblivious, continued his rambling pronouncements. <words>344</words> Serene Wind smiled, a rare and unsettling sight. <words>352</words> The new prophecy was taking shape, a tapestry of truth and lies, woven together with the precision of a spider's web and the randomness of a butterfly's flight. <words>378</words> He closed the press, the soft click echoing in the tranquil garden. <words>389</words> The deed was done. <words>393</words> The future, or at least a version of it, was now pressed and preserved, ready to be delivered. <words>410</words> And all it took was a little bit of longing, a botanical press, and a very cooperative butterfly. <words>427</words> The absurdity of it all was almost enough to make him laugh. <words>439</words> Almost. <words>440</words>
