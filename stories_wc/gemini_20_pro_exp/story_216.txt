Bartholomew Buttons, professional scapegoat, stared at the swirling clouds outside his window, a metal washer resting heavy in his palm. <18></words>
The cloud city of Aethelburg was always breathtaking, a robustly delicate metropolis floating amongst the heavens, especially now, after the last library card had been returned to the desk, plunging the city into a hushed, anticipatory quiet. <50></words>
His occupation was unique: he took the blame, absorbed the guilt, for a hefty price, allowing the truly culpable to walk free. <70></words>
Tonight, however, Bartholomew wasn't waiting for a client's confession; he was waiting for a cryptic phone call. <87></words>
It always came at midnight, a disembodied voice rasping instructions, leading him on a bizarre scavenger hunt. <103></words>
The voice, he suspected, belonged to someone who had abandoned identity, shedding their past like a worn-out cloak. <120></words>
Bartholomew’s own past was a blur, a deliberate erasure to better serve his clients, but this… this felt different. <138></words>
This felt personal. <141></words>
The phone rang, shattering the silence, the shrill sound echoing through his minimalist apartment. <154></words>
"The washer," the voice crackled, "is a key." <162></words>
Bartholomew examined the seemingly ordinary washer, its metallic surface reflecting the city's ethereal glow. <175></words>
He had been collecting these objects for months, each one delivered after a midnight call, each one seemingly mundane, yet imbued with a strange significance. <197></words>
His motivation wasn't money, not this time; it was an obsessive calm need to decode sacred symbols etched onto these objects, symbols he felt he should recognize. <221></words>
He was driven by a nagging feeling that these symbols held the key to his own lost past. <238></words>
Tonight's instructions were particularly cryptic: "Refashion the circle of consequence into the square of understanding." <253></words>
Bartholomew knew this wasn't about physically altering the washer; it was about understanding its symbolic meaning. <269></words>
He had to refashion his perception, his understanding of the object, and, perhaps, of himself. <284></words>
He spent hours poring over ancient texts, his apartment illuminated only by the soft glow of his datapad. <301></words>
The symbols, he realized, were not just sacred; they were alchemical, representing the transformation of the self. <317></words>
The washer, a perfect circle, represented the endless cycle of blame and guilt he perpetuated. <332></words>
The "square of understanding" was a call to break free, to find stability and truth within himself. <349></words>
He had to find a way to stop being a receptacle for others' sins and start living his own life, whatever that might be. <371></words>
The cryptic phone calls, the abandoned identity of the caller, the robustly delicate city itself – it all pointed to a single, terrifying truth. <392></words>
He was being guided, manipulated, perhaps even tested, by a version of himself he no longer remembered. <409></words>
The final piece of the puzzle clicked into place: he was his own client, seeking to escape the prison of his own making. <430></words>
He needed to refashion not just the washer's meaning, but his entire existence. <443></words>
With a newfound resolve, Bartholomew picked up the phone, ready to confront the voice, ready to confront himself. <461></words>
He would decode the final symbol, the symbol of his own rebirth, even if it meant shattering the only life he knew. <482></words>
The obsessive calm remained, but now, it was fueled by hope, not fear. <495></words>
