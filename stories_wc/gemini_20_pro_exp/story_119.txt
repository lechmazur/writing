Elara, heart hammering, felt the familiar tingle of separation as her astral form slipped free of her body. <17></words>
It was *sometimes always* like this; a sudden, involuntary ejection into the spectral plane. <30></words>
This time, the catalyst was the antique brass key she'd found nestled in the warped floorboards of the abandoned carnival. <49></words>
The revelation hit her like a physical blow: the key unlocked not a door, but a memory, a terrifying glimpse of her past life, a life she had to flee. <76></words>
Her corporeal self, slumped against a rusted support beam of the derelict roller coaster track, was vulnerable. <92></words>
Panic threatened to overwhelm her, but years of practiced spontaneity kicked in. <104></words>
She had to get back, to protect the fragile shell that housed her increasingly fragmented consciousness, to preserve survival skills honed over centuries. <125></words>
The abandoned carnival, a swirling vortex of faded colors and decaying laughter, offered no solace. <139></words>
Only the stark, skeletal remains of the roller coaster, a monument to forgotten thrills, provided a strange, twisted comfort. <157></words>
Elara focused, her astral eyes tracking sun shadows that stretched and warped across the twisted metal like living things. <175></words>
This was her method, her lifeline, a way to navigate the ethereal currents and return to her body. <191></words>
Each fleeting second felt like an eternity, the timeframe expanding and contracting with the erratic rhythm of her fear. <209></words>
The key, still clutched in her physical hand, pulsed with a faint, cold energy, a constant reminder of the life she desperately needed to outrun. <232></words>
Unyielding compassion, not for others, but for her own fractured self, fueled her desperate flight. <247></words>
She had to survive, to piece together the shattered fragments of her identity, to understand why she was perpetually running. <266></words>
The shadows shifted, the sun a cruel clock ticking down her precious moments of astral freedom. <281></words>
She followed their dance, a desperate waltz across the decaying landscape, her spirit a fragile butterfly caught in a hurricane. <300></words>
The roller coaster track loomed above her, a twisted metal serpent against the fading light. <315></words>
Elara pushed forward, driven by an instinct older than time, an unyielding will to exist. <330></words>
She saw her body, pale and still, a beacon in the gathering gloom. <342></words>
The shadows pointed the way, a path woven from light and darkness, leading her back to the fragile vessel she inhabited. <362></words>
With a final surge of will, she plunged back into her physical form, the impact jarring, the world snapping back into sharp, painful focus. <384></words>
The antique brass key felt heavy in her hand, a tangible link to the intangible horrors she carried within. <402></words>
She gasped, lungs burning, the taste of rust and fear thick on her tongue. <416></words>
Elara knew, with chilling certainty, that this was just the beginning. <427></words>
The fleeing would continue, *sometimes always*, until she could unlock the secrets of her past and finally find peace. <446></words>
She stood, unsteady but resolute, the abandoned carnival her silent, watchful witness. <458></words>
