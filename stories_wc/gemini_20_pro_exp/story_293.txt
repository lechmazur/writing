Bartholomew, a minstrel known more for his clammy hands than captivating melodies, clutched a crumpled photograph. <words>16</words>
It showed a younger, less anxious version of himself, grinning beside a woman whose face was now blurred by time and regret. <words>36</words>
He was rarely sincere, preferring irony and deflection, but the photo stirred a genuine ache for something lost, something… different. <words>55</words>
Tonight, Bartholomew was escaping the ordinary, a concept he usually mocked with a nervous twitch of his lute strings. <words>73</words>
The bacteria-powered city of Gleamhaven pulsed around him, its bioluminescent towers shimmering with an almost unsettling vibrancy. <words>89</words>
He had a plan, a foolish, desperate plan, and a timeframe dictated by a single, lonely candle flame flickering in his makeshift attic room. <words>111</words>
Before it guttered out, he needed to deploy his escape. <words>121</words>
His motivation wasn't fame, nor fortune, but a desperate clawing to find purpose in a world of uncertainty, a world that felt increasingly alien. <words>144</words>
He traced the lines on the photograph, a map not of roads, but of constellations. <words>159</words>
Bartholomew's method was unconventional, to say the least: escaping by following star patterns. <words>171</words>
He believed, with a fervor bordering on madness, that the stars held the key to a different life, a life hinted at in the faded image. <words>195</words>
The air hummed with the low thrum of the city's organic energy, a counterpoint to the frantic beat of his heart. <words>214</words>
He adjusted his worn leather cap, a gesture of cautious revelry, a tiny rebellion against the suffocating predictability of his existence. <words>234</words>
He looked up, the city's glow partially obscuring the celestial canvas, but he knew the patterns, memorized them from countless nights spent staring out his window. <words>258</words>
The candle flame danced, casting elongated shadows that mimicked his own trembling form. <words>271</words>
He took a deep breath, the scent of recycled air and something vaguely floral filling his lungs. <words>287</words>
This was it. <words>290</words>
The moment of truth, or perhaps, the moment of utter, spectacular failure. <words>302</words>
He began to play, his music hesitant at first, then gaining a strange, almost frantic confidence. <words>317</words>
The melody was a map, each note corresponding to a star, a sequence designed to unlock… something. <words>333</words>
He wasn't sure what, but the uncertainty was almost exhilarating. <words>342</words>
The candle flickered violently, threatening to extinguish. <words>349</words>
Bartholomew closed his eyes, his fingers flying across the strings, his voice rising in a shaky, but determined, crescendo. <words>367</words>
He poured all his fear, his longing, his rarely sincere hope into the music, a desperate plea to the cosmos. <words>386</words>
The photograph slipped from his grasp, falling to the dusty floor, unnoticed. <words>398</words>
The final note hung in the air, vibrating with an almost palpable energy, just as the candle flame finally succumbed to the darkness. <words>420</words>
Bartholomew stood in the sudden silence, bathed in the eerie glow of the bacteria-powered city, waiting. <words>436</words>
He didn't know what he was waiting for, but for the first time in a long time, he felt… hopeful. <words>455</words>
Maybe, just maybe, he had found his escape. <words>463</words>
