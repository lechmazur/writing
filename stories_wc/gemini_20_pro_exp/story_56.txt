<story>
Bartholomew, a swindler of some renown but little success, surveyed the reclaimed orchard farmland flourishing inside the toppled skyscraper. <words>17</words>
Sunlight streamed through shattered glass, illuminating apple trees heavy with fruit, a bizarre oasis amidst urban decay. <words>34</words>
He was energetically lethargic, a paradox he embodied with practiced ease, moving with a slow, deliberate grace that somehow suggested boundless, untapped energy. <words>56</words>
His eyes, however, darted about, assessing every potential mark, every escape route. <words>68</words>
Today's con involved a blank price tag and a carefully cultivated air of mystique. <words>82</words>
He planned to sell these "invisible apples," claiming they granted wishes, relying on his invisible allies â€“ the desperation and gullibility of others. <words>103</words>
Suddenly, a young woman, her arms overflowing with books, tripped near a gnarled apple tree. <words>118</words>
One book tumbled free, landing at Bartholomew's feet. <words>127</words>
He bent, with theatrical slowness, to retrieve it, their fingers brushing. <words>138</words>
It was a meet-cute orchestrated by gravity and his own proximity to a potential victim. <words>153</words>
"Oh, I'm so sorry," she said, her cheeks flushed, a stark contrast to the gentle harshness of the decaying world around them. <words>173</words>
Bartholomew smiled, a practiced, charming curve of his lips. <words>183</words>
"No harm done," he murmured, his voice a silken whisper. <words>194</words>
He felt a strange pull, an unfamiliar urge to abandon his charade. <words>206</words>
He wanted to magnetize her attention, not with lies, but with something real. <words>219</words>
The frozen computer in the makeshift market stall chose that precise instant to restart, its ancient fan whirring back to life. <words>239</words>
The screen flickered, displaying a news report from years ago, a truth Bartholomew had buried deep. <words>255</words>
It detailed his past, his real name, his accidental role in the skyscraper's collapse, a truth no one dares to handle, especially himself. <words>276</words>
He'd been running ever since, hiding behind fabricated personas and petty scams. <words>288</words>
The woman's eyes widened, not at the screen, but at him. <words>299</words>
"You're him," she whispered, not with accusation, but with a strange understanding. <words>311</words>
He'd been prepared for outrage, for fear, but not for this quiet recognition. <words>324</words>
His motivation, long suppressed, surged to the surface: to bare a truth no one dares to handle, starting with his own. <words>344</words>
He looked at the blank price tag in his hand, a symbol of his empty promises. <words>360</words>
He crumpled it, letting it fall to the fertile earth. <words>371</words>
"Yes," he admitted, his voice raw, stripped of its usual artifice. <words>382</words>
"I am." <words>384</words>
He braced himself, expecting rejection, but she simply nodded. <words>394</words>
"I know," she said, picking up a real apple, its skin glowing red in the sunlight. <words>410</words>
"The invisible ones are interesting, but sometimes, the truth is more nourishing." <words>422</words>
She offered him the apple. <words>427</words>
He took it, the weight of it surprisingly comforting. <words>437</words>
Maybe, just maybe, his invisible allies weren't needed anymore. <words>447</words>
Maybe honesty, however harsh, could be a kind of gentle reclamation. <words>459</words>
He took a bite. <words>463</words>
It was the sweetest apple he had ever tasted. <words>472</words>
