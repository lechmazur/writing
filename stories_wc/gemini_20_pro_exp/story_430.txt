The reaver, Kael, sat on a bench in Kaleidoscope Park, its stained-glass trees shimmering in hues unseen anywhere else. <17></words> He was closed-off, not by choice, but by the design of his ancestors, a generational pattern he couldn't seem to break. <36></words> The world hadn't yet known deceit; this was before the first lie is told, a time of raw, untainted truth. <54></words> Kael unfolded a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, a charmingly grotesque depiction of a many-eyed beast reaching for a sky full of swirling, edible-looking stars. <78></words>

He’d found it fluttering near the carousel, its horses frozen mid-gallop, their painted eyes wide and knowing. <94></words> Kael traced the crayon lines, a strange tenderness blooming in his chest, a place usually reserved for the cold calculation needed for his… profession. <117></words> He was a reaver of memories, not a thief, but a… repurposer. <128></words> His motivation, however, was far from practical; he longed to taste the stars in a single kiss, to experience the universe's sweetness concentrated on a lover's lips. <153></words>

A giggle echoed, and a young girl, no older than five, approached him, her eyes the same shade of violet as the park's central fountain. <175></words> She pointed at the drawing. <180></words> "That's Grungle," she declared, "He wants the sparkly snacks." <190></words> Kael, despite his hardened exterior, found himself smiling, a rare and unsettling event. <203></words> He’d been trying to *nag* his own heart into opening, to break the cycle of solitude his lineage demanded. <221></words>

His method was unusual, even for him: via scrawled poems in margins of ancient texts, verses filled with mocking affection for a love he hadn't yet found. <246></words> He’d fill the edges of star charts with pleas and taunts, hoping to somehow conjure a connection. <262></words> He looked at the girl, then back at the drawing. <272></words> Grungle, with his many eyes, seemed to wink. <280></words>

"He does look hungry," Kael admitted, his voice rough but lacking its usual edge. <294></words> The girl beamed. <297></words> "He eats wishes," she confided, leaning closer. <305></words> "But only the good ones." <310></words> Kael felt a pang, a longing for a wish pure enough for Grungle's consumption. <324></words> He wondered if his desire, to taste starlight on a lover's breath, qualified. <337></words>

He tucked the drawing into his coat, a reminder of a world before cynicism, before the inherited burden of his family. <357></words> The generational pattern felt a little less… inevitable. <366></words> He stood, the kaleidoscope light catching the silver threads woven into his dark cloak. <380></words> "Thank you," he said to the girl, the words feeling strangely unfamiliar, yet right. <394></words> He walked away, leaving the carousel and its frozen horses behind, a crumpled drawing and a flicker of hope warming his usually icy heart. <417></words> Maybe, just maybe, he could rewrite the poems in his soul. <428></words> Maybe he could find a love bright enough to break the pattern, a love that tasted of stardust and whispered promises. <448></words> A love that wouldn't nag, but nurture. <455></words>
