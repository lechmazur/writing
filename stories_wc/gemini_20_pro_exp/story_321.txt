The infernal kitchen shimmered, heat rising in visible waves from the obsidian stovetop. <words>13</words>
A distracted guard, Belphegor, leaned against a counter made of polished bone, idly fiddling with a partial spool of crimson ribbon. <words>33</words>
He was supposed to be watching the simmering souls, but his gaze kept drifting to an hourglass on a nearby shelf, filled not with sand, but with swirling, dreamlike colors. <words>61</words>
It represented the space where an apology waits unspoken, a purgatory of potential reconciliation. <words>74</words>
Belphegorâ€™s own transgression hung heavy in that space, an almost radical act of defiance against the celestial order, a refusal to accept divine decree without question. <words>98</words>
He longed to displace the suffocating guilt, to find some measure of peace. <words>111</words>
The price of forgiveness, he knew, was steep in this realm, often requiring a complete surrender of self. <words>128</words>
He wasn't sure he was ready for that. <words>136</words>
His motivation wasn't repentance, not exactly; it was to outmaneuver cosmic silence, the deafening absence of any response to his unspoken plea. <words>157</words>
He wanted an answer, a judgment, anything but this agonizing limbo. <words>168</words>
The abrasive calm of the kitchen, the rhythmic bubbling of the soul-stew, only amplified the turmoil within him. <words>185</words>
He picked at the ribbon, its texture strangely comforting against his calloused fingers. <words>198</words>
He decided he would find a way, his method, by clarifying the swirling patterns inside a dreamlike hourglass. <words>215</words>
He would force the issue. <words>220</words>
Belphegor focused his will, attempting to impose order on the chaotic colors within the hourglass. <words>235</words>
He imagined each swirl as a thread of his memory, a fragment of the event that had led to his current predicament. <words>255</words>
He would untangle them, lay them bare, force the universe to acknowledge his existence, his pain, his demand for resolution. <words>274</words>
The ribbon slipped from his grasp, falling onto the floor, a splash of crimson against the black stone. <words>291</words>
He didn't notice. <words>294</words>
His entire being was concentrated on the hourglass, on the swirling colors that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. <words>315</words>
He would dissect the dream, analyze the patterns, and extract the truth, even if it shattered him. <words>331</words>
This was his act of defiance, his twisted form of prayer. <words>342</words>
He would not be ignored. <words>347</words>
The colors began to shift, responding to his focused intent, forming fleeting images, whispers of forgotten moments. <words>363</words>
A face, contorted in anger, then sorrow. <words>370</words>
A hand, reaching out, then withdrawing. <words>376</words>
A word, unspoken, hanging in the air like a shroud. <words>386</words>
Belphegor pushed harder, demanding clarity, demanding judgment. <words>394</words>
The hourglass trembled, the colors swirling faster, threatening to explode. <words>404</words>
He was close, he could feel it, to breaking through the cosmic silence, to forcing a confrontation with the forces that held him captive. <words>426</words>
The price might be oblivion, but even that was preferable to this endless, unspoken apology. <words>441</words>
The kitchen held its breath, the simmering souls momentarily forgotten, as Belphegor stared into the heart of his own fractured past. <words>461</words>
He was ready to pay, whatever the cost.
