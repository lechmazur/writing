Bartholomew "Barty" Buttercup, a meteorologist whose career was as systematically chaotic as the weather patterns he failed to predict, felt a pull towards the cosmos that bordered on obsession. <words>26</words> He clutched a mariner's sextant, an archaic tool in this age, but one that felt strangely right in his hand, a tangible link to the stars. <words>51</words> Tonight, however, his celestial gaze was directed downwards, towards the rumored entrance of an underground city, home to the lizard people. <words>71</words> Barty, driven by a bitter honey tone that colored his every interaction, was not interested in the lizards themselves. <words>89</words> His motivation was purely botanical; he wanted to study plant behaviors in a subterranean environment, hoping to find some rare, light-deprived flora. <words>109</words>

He took a shortcut through a disused maintenance tunnel, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something reptilian. <words>128</words> This unexpected encounter happened between colliding interests: his scientific curiosity and the lizard people's fiercely guarded privacy. <words>144</words> A hulking, scaled figure emerged from the shadows, its eyes glowing with an unsettling luminescence. <words>158</words> "Speak your truth," the lizard hissed, its voice a dry rustle, the core concept of their society laid bare. <words>175</words> Barty, never one for eloquence, stammered, "I… I study plants." <words>185</words> The lizard tilted its head, a gesture surprisingly bird-like. <words>194</words> "Plants?" it repeated, the word dripping with suspicion. <words>202</words>

"Yes," Barty confirmed, holding up the sextant as if it were some kind of botanical identification tool. <words>219</words> "I use this… to measure… their growth… towards… celestial bodies, even underground." <words>231</words> The lizard, clearly unimpressed, unsheathed a claw that resembled a polished obsidian dagger. <words>244</words> "We spar," it declared, the action a challenge, a test of Barty's spoken truth. <words>258</words> Barty, who had never sparred with anything more threatening than a particularly stubborn weather balloon, gulped. <words>274</words> He raised the sextant defensively, the brass glinting in the dim light. <words>286</words>

The lizard lunged, its movements swift and precise, a stark contrast to Barty's clumsy attempts to parry with the navigational instrument. <words>306</words> He managed to deflect a few blows, the sextant surprisingly sturdy, but he knew he was outmatched. <words>323</words> "They… they photosynthesize… differently… down here," Barty gasped, trying to distract the lizard with botanical jargon, another spoken truth, though a desperate one. <words>344</words> The lizard paused, its claw hovering inches from Barty's face. <words>354</words> "Differently?" it questioned, a flicker of genuine curiosity in its reptilian eyes. <words>366</words>

Barty, seizing the opportunity, launched into a rambling explanation of chlorophyll adaptation and bioluminescent fungi, his words a torrent of half-baked theories and desperate pleas. <words>390</words> The lizard, surprisingly, listened, its aggressive posture softening. <words>399</words> Perhaps, Barty thought with a flicker of bitter honey hope, his unlucky streak was finally turning, all thanks to an archaic tool, a hidden city, and the power of spoken, albeit slightly panicked, truths about plants. <words>432</words> He might even get to see those light-deprived flowers after all. <words>443</words>
