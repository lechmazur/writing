The underwater welder, Lira, adjusted her dive mask in the neon haze of the broken planetarium, now a nightclub called *The Celestial Fracture*. <words>16</words>
She’d spent years repairing pipelines beneath the ocean’s surface, her hands patiently impatient—steady enough to solder joints, yet twitching to move faster, to *unravel* something. <words>33</words>
Tonight, she sought not metal but power, the kind that glimmered in the cracks of a fractured timeline. <words>18</words>
At the club’s heart stood a vintage button box, its glass dome cracked, filled with antique buttons that hummed when touched. <words>23</words>
Lira’s fingers hovered over it, recalling her grandfather’s tales of “moments of unraveling,” when time bled into itself. <words>21</words>
She’d learned to wield improbable power by studying such fissures, but tonight, she needed more than theory. <words>19</words>
The bartender, a woman with a mirrored pendant, slid her a drink. “Pamper yourself,” she said, nodding to the mirrors lining the walls. “They show glimpses of what’s to come… or what’s already been.” <words>34</words>
Lira sipped the bitter concoction, her gaze catching her reflection in a warped mirror. For a heartbeat, she saw herself not in a club, but submerged in a rusted submarine, the button box floating nearby. <words>32</words>
Another mirror showed her grandfather, alive, pressing a button into her palm. “Inherit this mystery,” he’d whispered. She’d thought it metaphorical. <words>26</words>
The club’s patrons danced obliviously, their laughter echoing like distant sonar pings. Lira’s impatience sharpened; the timelines were converging here, at the crossing where they should never meet. <words>30</words>
She opened the button box, its hum crescendoing. A button, jade-green and etched with constellations, glowed. <words>20</words>
When she pressed it, the mirrors flickered. Images collided: her welding underwater, the planetarium intact, her grandfather’s hand vanishing into light. <words>24</words>
The bartender grinned. “You’re unraveling the seam.” <words>8</words>
Lira’s patience fractured. She grabbed the jade button, its edges biting her palm. The club shuddered; the mirrors showed only her now, alone in a void. <words>27</words>
“Power isn’t seized,” her grandfather’s voice echoed. “It’s inherited… through moments of letting go.” <words>18</words>
She released the button. The void shattered into a thousand reflections, each a timeline: her as a welder, a club owner, a ghost. <words>23</words>
The button box snapped shut. The club’s lights steadied. The bartender was gone. <words>15</words>
Lira’s hands stopped twitching. She understood: the power wasn’t in the button, but in the unraveling itself—the patient impatience to exist in the cracks. <words>28</words>
She left the club, the jade button warm in her pocket. Outside, the planetarium’s dome, still broken, gleamed like a starmap. <words>25</words>
Somewhere, two timelines sighed in relief, their crossing unnoticed by all but her. <words>16</words>
