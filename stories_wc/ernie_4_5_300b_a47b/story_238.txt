The abandoned carnival ticket booth creaked in the wind, its peeling paint a mosaic of faded yellow and rust. <words>13</words>
Elias, the gloomy barkeep, leaned against the booth’s splintered frame, thumb tracing the frayed edges of a worn wallet in his pocket—a relic from his last shift, stuffed with receipts and a faded photo of a woman he’d forgotten. <words>37</words>
Midnight had stolen the light here, leaving only the hum of a drone circling above, its red eye blinking like a bloodshot moon. <words>56</words>
He’d come to listen, as he always did, to the overheard confessions at the broken payphone booth across the lot, its handset dangling by a frayed cord. <words>79</words>
Voices seeped through the cracks: a teen’s muffled sobs about a stolen kiss, a man’s gruff admission of guilt, a woman’s whisper about a child left behind. <words>101</words>
Elias’s abrasively charming smile flickered—a tool honed in dimly lit bars, now used to coax secrets from the static. <words>122</words>
“You think the carnival’s dead?” he muttered, more to himself than the drone, which dipped lower, its rotors slicing the air. <words>140</words>
The wallet in his pocket grew heavier, its contents a map of transient realities: a lottery ticket (losing), a business card (outdated), a napkin with a phone number (smeared). <words>163</words>
He’d found it under the counter at his bar, left by a patron who’d vanished into the night, like so many before. <words>185</words>
Now, he clutched it as if it held the key to reclaiming the light stolen by midnight—a light he’d once known, before the carnival’s collapse, before the truce between hope and despair. <words>213</words>
The drone hovered, its camera trained on him. Elias didn’t flinch. <words>227</words>
“Go ahead,” he said, “record this. The barkeep who listens to ghosts.” <words>244</words>
A laugh escaped him, abrasive and familiar, like the clink of glasses at closing time. <words>261</words>
The payphone booth emitted a crackle. A new voice: a child’s, trembling. “I didn’t mean to break it.” <words>280</words>
Elias’s breath hitched. The wallet’s photo fluttered free—a woman holding a child’s hand, their smiles brighter than the booth’s faded paint. <words>302</words>
He pressed his palm to the booth’s glass, as if to steady the ghost. “It’s okay,” he said, though no one asked. <words>322</words>
The drone pivoted, its light sweeping the lot, illuminating a path through the debris. <words>339</words>
Elias followed, the wallet clutched to his chest, its contents a chorus of lost and found. <words>357</words>
At the hush when a truce forms without words, he understood: the carnival wasn’t dead. It was waiting, like him, for the light to return. <words>383</words>
The drone buzzed once, a nod, before vanishing into the dark. <words>398</words>
Elias slipped the wallet back into his pocket, its photo a compass pointing home. <words>415</words>
Somewhere, a Ferris wheel groaned to life, its lights flickering like a heartbeat. <words>433</words>
He smiled, abrasively charming, and waited for the next confession. <words>440</words>
