The mildly panicked soothsayer, Zara, pressed her palm against the pocket puzzle box’s thirteenth lock, its brass gears grinding like a rusted conscience. <words>20</words>
Between lost years—when time curdled into a soup of forgotten birthdays and erased appointments—she’d wandered the maze of billboards in the neon-lit desert, their holographic faces flickering like dying stars. <words>40</words>
“Environmental stewardship,” she muttered, magnifying the bar top’s water rings with a cracked monocle, “probably the least likely prophecy to sell here.” <words>30</words>
The bar, a relic named *The Ozone Hole*, leaned against a billboard advertising “Eternal Sunsets™” for $99.99 a pop. <words>23</words>
Zara’s motivation was a paradox: to shape destiny with bare hands while her fingers trembled over the puzzle box’s locks, each one a microcosm of ecological collapse. <words>31</words>
She’d stolen the box from a corporate shrine to “Progress,” its 13 locks symbolizing the 13 apocalypses humanity had narrowly avoided (so far). <words>27</words>
Now, by reading the water rings—stains left by spilled whiskey and the tears of failed futurists—she divined the next crisis: a drought so severe it would turn the desert’s neon into a funeral pyre. <words>36</words>
“Molten sarcasm won’t save the planet,” she told her reflection in the bar’s tarnished mirror, “but neither will your precious algorithms, corporate drones.” <words>28</words>
The puzzle box’s locks clicked in sequence, a Rube Goldberg machine of doom, as she traced the rings’ concentric circles. <words>23</words>
Each ring represented a year of environmental neglect, the innermost one a hairline crack where the future bled through. <words>22</words>
Zara’s hands shook. She’d always been a midwife to catastrophes, delivering bad news in iambic pentameter. <words>21</words>
But tonight, between the lost years, she vowed to rewrite the script. <words>13</words>
She slammed the puzzle box onto the bar, its locks rattling like a skeleton’s ribs. <words>14</words>
“Magnify this,” she hissed, pouring a shot of absinthe into the water rings. <words>13</words>
The liquid swirled, projecting a hologram of a thriving oasis—a mirage, probably, but a mirage with roots. <words>20</words>
The billboards outside shrieked with ads for “Carbon-Neutral Lava Lamps,” their light bleeding through the dust-choked windows. <words>22</words>
Zara laughed, a sound like gravel in a blender. “Unlikely? Sure. But so was your birth, dear planet.” <words>20</words>
She twisted the puzzle box’s final lock, and the bar’s neon sign fizzled, casting the room in emerald green. <words>21</words>
The water rings glowed, revealing a map to a hidden aquifer beneath the billboard maze. <words>16</words>
“Destiny,” she said, tucking the box into her coat, “is just a puzzle with 13 locks and a sense of humor.” <words>18</words>
Outside, the desert wind howled, carrying the scent of ozone and rebellion. <words>14</words>
Zara stepped into the neon glare, her shadow stretching into a dozen billboards, each one whispering, *“Buy salvation.”* <words>20</words>
She flipped them the bird, her pocket puzzle box humming like a tuning fork. <words>13</words>
Between lost years, she’d plant a garden. <words>8</words>
