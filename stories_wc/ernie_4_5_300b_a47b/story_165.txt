At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, the underground city of the dwarves shuddered, its tunnels humming with a tension as ancient as the stone. <words>22</words>
Elias, a gentle conjurer with hands that trembled like moth wings, knelt beside the fractured earth, where a single stained glass butterfly—its wings a mosaic of blues and golds—had been unearthed by the tremor. <words>47</words>
The dwarves believed the butterfly was a relic of the Forgotten Garden, a place where justice once bloomed before the earth swallowed it whole. <words>31</words>
“To rebuild it,” Elias whispered, his voice both a prayer and a promise, “we must reassemble what was lost.” <words>24</words>
The dwarves scoffed; their world was built on secrets, not revelations. <words>12</words>
Yet Elias knew the truth was inscrutably obvious: the garden’s ruin had been woven into the city’s foundations, its justice buried in reversed messages only a conjurer could decipher. <words>35</words>
He carried the butterfly to the heart of the city, where the Council of Stones argued in grunts and hammered fists. <words>23</words>
“The garden’s roots are here,” Elias insisted, placing the butterfly on the central dais. <words>15</words>
“Lies,” growled the eldest dwarf, his beard coiled like a serpent. <words>12</words>
Elias closed his eyes, tracing the butterfly’s cracks with his fingertips. <words>11</words>
The glass grew warm, and the air thrummed with a sound like wind through leaves. <words>14</words>
“Listen,” Elias urged. <words>3</words>
The dwarves fell silent, straining to hear. <words>5</words>
At first, nothing. Then—a whisper, reversed, as if the world itself had spoken backward. <words>14</words>
*“Justice is not a blade,”* the message echoed, *“but a seed. Plant it where the light cannot reach.”* <words>19</words>
The dwarves recoiled, but Elias smiled. The truth had always been there, inscrutably obvious in the butterfly’s design. <words>20</words>
He began to reassemble the fragments, each piece clicking into place as if drawn by memory. <words>17</words>
As the butterfly took flight, its wings cast prismatic light onto the walls, revealing hidden carvings: maps, riddles, the names of those who’d stolen the garden’s heart. <words>30</words>
“The thieves are among us,” Elias declared, pointing to the carvings. <words>10</words>
The dwarves gasped. The Council’s eldest, it turned out, had been one of them. <words>15</words>
Justice, Elias realized, was not a reckoning but a rebirth. <words>10</words>
He led the dwarves through the tunnels, following the butterfly’s glow to a chamber where the garden’s last seed lay dormant, its potential choked by lies. <words>23</words>
With a chant, Elias reversed the spells that bound the seed, his voice steady despite the joyful terror in his chest. <words>20</words>
The seed sprouted, its tendrils piercing the stone, and the air filled with the scent of petals and fresh earth. <words>19</words>
The dwarves wept, their hardened hearts softening. <words>9</words>
Elias placed the reassembled butterfly atop the seedling, its light now steady, eternal. <words>15</words>
“The garden is rebuilt,” he said, “not in stone, but in truth.” <words>13</words>
The dwarves nodded, their grudges dissolving like morning mist. <words>12</words>
And in the silent forest above, a brittle branch snapped—not in fear, but in celebration. <words>14</words>
