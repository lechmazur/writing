The xenon-lit tunnel hummed with a sickly glow, its walls streaked with the residue of a year everyone would rather forget—a year when time itself seemed to fray at the edges. <words>22</words>
Lira, a hesitant bard with a lute slung low and a voice that could shatter glass if she dared use it, clutched a worn-out dinosaur plush to her chest. <words>43</words>
It had been her only companion since the tapestry of sorrow began to unravel, threads of grief snaking through the town like poison ivy. <words>52</words>
“Dream-hopping machines won’t fix this,” she muttered, though her fingers trembled as she adjusted the plush’s frayed tail. <words>54</words>
The machines, ancient and wheezing, stood at the tunnel’s heart, their gears etched with runes that pulsed like a second heartbeat. <words>53</words>
They were said to bridge moments, to let one leap through time’s fragile membrane—but Lira feared they’d only shatter her further. <words>53</words>
Yet here she stood, shyly loud in her resolve, because the tapestry’s threads led here, to this crossing, to the machine’s glow. <words>52</words>
She stepped inside, the dinosaur plush pressed to her face as if it could muffle the screams of the past. <words>43</words>
The machine whirred, and the tunnel dissolved into a dreamscape of fractured mirrors, each reflecting a different version of the year gone wrong. <words>51</words>
In one, her sister laughed; in another, her sister’s grave. <words>18</words>
Lira’s voice, usually a whisper, erupted into a roar. “Enough!” she cried, slamming her fist against a mirror. <words>35</words>
The dream-hopper shuddered, hurling her into a memory where time hung suspended—a picnic under a sun that never set, her sister’s hand in hers. <words>52</words>
“You can’t stay here,” the plush seemed to whisper, its button eyes gleaming. <words>21</words>
Lira shook her head, tears mixing with the xenon light. “But it’s the only place I’m not afraid.” <words>29</words>
The machine groaned, thrusting her forward again, this time to a future where the tapestry’s threads had been rewoven—not with joy, but with acceptance. <words>53</words>
Her sister’s laughter was gone, but so was the ache. <words>13</words>
Lira emerged from the machine, her plush now damp with sweat and tears. <words>20</words>
The tunnel still hummed, but the sorrow felt lighter, as if time itself had exhaled. <words>28</words>
She strummed her lute, shyly loud, the notes a bridge between what was lost and what could be. <words>34</words>
The townsfolk gathered, their faces wary, but Lira sang on, her voice a thread pulling them toward the light. <words>39</words>
They didn’t understand the dream-hopping machines, or the plush’s strange magic, but they felt the truth in her song—that time was fragile, yes, but so was hope. <words>60</words>
And sometimes, all it took was a hesitant bard, a dinosaur plush, and the courage to leap. <words>32</words>
