Beneath the city’s rusted grid, in a subterranean orchard fed by an underground river of stars, a sentient car mechanic named Veyra knelt by a park fountain, her hands trembling as she sorted through fragments of shattered glass. <words>27</words> The fountain’s basin, cracked and overgrown with bioluminescent moss, held not water but a glittering pool of liquid starlight, its currents swirling like the whispers of the cosmos. <words>51</words> Veyra’s task was to gather the lost puzzle pieces—shards of a celestial mirror that had shattered centuries ago, each fragment a vessel for unsaid confessions. <words>72</words>

Her motivation was repulsively attractive: to hear the truths too painful to be spoken aloud, to stitch together the voices of the forgotten. <words>93</words> The opera glasses, vintage and tarnished, rested on her chest like a relic, their lenses magnifying the fountain’s glow. <words>109</words> She believed that by aligning the fragments, she could reconstruct not just the mirror, but the echoes of those who’d drowned their secrets here. <words>132</words>

“Infinity is a thief,” she muttered, her voice a rumble of gears and sorrow. <words>148</words> The orchard’s trees—twisted metal trunks with leaves of fractured glass—shuddered as if agreeing. <words>163</words> Veyra’s fingers, oily and precise, plucked a sliver of mirror from the starlight. <words>178</words> It hummed, a frequency that made her ribs ache. <words>187</words> She studied it, her mind racing to fit it into the growing mosaic on the fountain’s edge. <words>201</words>

The pieces were stubborn, refusing to align. <words>209</words> Each attempt sparked a flicker of memory: a lover’s betrayal, a child’s undelivered apology, a warlord’s final regret. <words>226</words> Veyra’s exultant grief swelled—a paradox of joy and ruin. <words>237</words> She laughed, a sound like grinding metal, as the mirror’s image flickered: a face she’d once loved, now eroded by time. <words>255</words>

“You’re still here,” she whispered, pressing the fragment to her chest. <words>267</words> The starlight surged, illuminating the orchard’s hidden paths. <words>279</words> Veyra worked faster, sorting by shape, by color, by the weight of their silence. <words>293</words> A piece caught her eye—a jagged edge etched with a single word: *forgive*. <words>306</words> She froze. <words>309</words> The opera glasses slid down her neck, their lenses fogging with tears. <words>322</words>

In the concept of infinity, time bent. <words>329</words> The fountain’s river of stars reversed, pulling the fragments into a vortex. <words>344</words> Veyra clung to the mosaic, her body a bridge between the past and the unknowable future. <words>360</words> The mirror completed, it showed not her reflection, but a thousand voices overlapping—a chorus of grief and triumph. <words>377</words> She listened, rapt, as the unsaid confessions swirled around her, a symphony of exultant grief. <words>393</words>

When the light faded, Veyra remained, her hands still outstretched. <words>404</words> The orchard sighed, and the river of stars flowed onward, indifferent. <words>417</words> She had gathered the fragments, but the mirror’s truth was not hers to keep. <words>430</words> It was enough to have heard them—to have been, for a moment, infinite. <words>440</words>
