Sir Cedric floated in the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor clinking faintly as he drifted, a dejected knight whose boots no longer touched the earth. <words>17</words> The hall’s mirrored walls reflected his hollow gaze, each surface warping his form into a dozen fractured selves, as if the very architecture mocked his fractured purpose. <words>35</words> He clutched a trident prong from a sunken realm—a relic plucked from the ocean’s depths where his order had once sworn to guard forgotten thresholds. <words>51</words> Now, the prong’s jagged edges bit into his palm, a reminder of promises unkept. <words>62</words>

When the old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour—not midnight, nor dawn, but a dissonant chime that seemed to ripple through the fabric of the hall—the air hummed. <words>80</words> Sir Cedric’s breath fogged the glass of his helmet, his voice muffled as he whispered, *“I will honor the vow.”* The words, silent for centuries, echoed in the static between atoms. <words>98</words>

The hall’s gravity shifted, not upward nor downward, but *sideways*, a sensation that made his stomach lurch. <words>110</words> Normally abnormal phenomena coiled around him: shadows that moved against the light, music that played in reverse, and the trident prong glowing faintly, as if awakening. <words>127</words> He knew this was the moment to quicken his resolve, to act before the hall’s sacred disorder consumed him. <words>138</words>

Through forgotten paths—a term his order had used for portals to realms where time folded—he propelled himself toward a flickering portal near the ceiling. <words>154</words> The prong’s tip scraped against the frame, igniting a cascade of light that revealed not a door, but a *horizon*, deepening endlessly like a throat swallowing the sky. <words>169</words> His armor, once a burden, now felt weightless, his movements fluid as he dove into the glow. <words>179</words>

The dance hall dissolved into a void where stars spun like dervishes, and the trident prong pulsed in time with his heartbeat. <words>191</words> Here, the silent vow he’d carried since childhood—to protect the sunken realm’s secrets, even as his order crumbled—found its voice. <words>204</words> The prong’s magic quickened his blood, urging him to *move*, to *reach*, to *claim*. <words>214</words>

He spun, arms outstretched, as if conducting the chaos. The forgotten paths bent to his will, weaving a lattice of light that anchored him to the void. <words>229</words> The watchtower’s chime reverberated again, sharper now, a blade severing the thread of doubt. <words>240</words> Sir Cedric laughed, a sound raw and unfamiliar, as the horizon before him split, revealing a realm where the sunken and the airborne coexisted. <words>255</words>

In that moment, he understood: the trident prong was not a weapon, but a key. <words>263</words> The zero-gravity hall, the sacred disorder, the unexpected hour—all were threads in a tapestry woven by vows older than time. <words>276</words> His dejection fell away like scales, and he surged forward, not as a knight of broken orders, but as a pilgrim of deepening horizons. <words>290</words>

The portal swallowed him whole. <words>294</words>
