The naive gambler, Elias, had always bet on luck—until the night he met the unhinged professor at the tidal power monitoring station. <words>17</words>

Each candlelit dinner in the station’s cramped mess hall was punctuated by the hum of turbines and the professor’s rebellious midnight lectures, delivered in a voice that crackled like static. <words>35</words>

“Oblivion isn’t a destination,” the professor would say, slamming a rustic candle mold onto the table, its waxy residue glistening. “It’s a *bargain*—one we make with silence.” <words>35</words>

Elias, whose pockets were lined with losing tickets and half-baked schemes, laughed through his tears. The professor’s rants were rarely predictable, veering from quantum physics to the poetry of drowning men. <words>38</words>

The station, perched on a dock where the sea gnawed at concrete pilings, monitored tides that ebbed and flowed like the professor’s sanity. Elias had come to bet on the power grid’s fluctuations, but found himself wagering on words instead. <words>44</words>

“You think you’re here to gamble?” the professor sneered, lighting a candle from the mold’s drippings. “No. You’re here to *capture*—one last spark before the dark takes it.” <words>34</words>

Elias’s motivation had always been vague, a hunger for something unnamed. Now, as the professor droned on about unspoken bargains and the inevitability of entropy, he felt a reckless clarity. <words>35</words>

During one dinner, as the tide roared outside and the candle’s flame danced, Elias slammed his fist on the table. “I’ll bet you,” he said, voice trembling, “that I can outrun oblivion.” <words>34</words>

The professor’s laugh was a blade. “Oblivion isn’t a race. It’s a *lecture*.” He gestured to the mold. “Wax melts. Words linger. Choose your medium.” <words>32</words>

Elias, whose life had been a series of ill-advised bets, grabbed the mold. Its weight felt like a promise. “I’ll pour a candle,” he said, “that outshines your damn turbines.” <words>31</words>

The professor’s eyes gleamed. “And if you lose?” <words>7</words>

“You get my soul.” Elias grinned, though his hands shook. <words>10</words>

The station’s dock became their stage. Each midnight, as the tide swelled, Elias poured wax into the mold, shaping it with trembling fingers. The professor lectured, his voice a tide itself, eroding Elias’s certainty. <words>40</words>

“You’re chasing a spark,” the professor said one night, “but sparks don’t care if you catch them.” <words>20</words>

Elias, laughing tears streaming, replied, “Neither do I.” <words>9</words>

On the final night, as the candle burned bright and the turbines whined, Elias realized the professor’s lectures were the real wager. The mold, the wax, the flickering light—all were distractions. <words>37</words>

The unspoken bargain was this: to face oblivion, you must first admit you’re afraid of it. <words>17</words>

Elias lost the bet. The professor took his soul—or so it seemed. But as the candle guttered out, Elias smiled. He’d captured the spark after all, not in wax, but in the memory of a madman’s laughter. <words>37</words>

The dock remained. The turbines spun. And somewhere, a rustic candle mold held the ghost of a gamble worth losing. <words>25</words>
