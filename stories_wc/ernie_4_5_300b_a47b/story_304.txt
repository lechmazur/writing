The baroque asteroid spun lazily, its obsidian spires twisting like frozen smoke under borrowed starlight. <words>14</words>
A lurking assassin named Veyra pressed herself into the shadow of a spire, her breath fogging the air as she watched the bus driver’s final route through a paint-splattered camera lens. <words>32</words>
The lens, a relic from a dead world, had been her only companion for three cycles—its splatters mapping constellations only she could decipher. <words>26</words>
When the bus driver completed the final route, the asteroid’s gravity would shift, collapsing the tunnels beneath her feet. <words>20</words>
Veyra’s motivation pulsed like a second heart: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, to steal the light before it died. <words>20</words>
She laughed, a sound like shattered glass, at the thought of her target—a senator who’d sold his soul to the void. <words>22</words>
The laugh echoed via the pattern of a spider’s web after rain, fractal and deliberate, as she calculated the angle of the approaching shuttle’s descent. <words>25</words>
Superficially profound, the asteroid’s architecture mimicked divine geometry, but Veyra knew its secrets: the spires were hollow, the courtyards filled with traps. <words>27</words>
She adjusted the lens, focusing on the senator’s limousine, its windows tinted with the same hue as the paint on her camera. <words>21</words>
The bus driver’s route was a loop of lies, each stop a pretense of civilization. <words>14</words>
Veyra’s hands trembled, not from fear, but anticipation—the dawn was a fragile thing, and she would not let it slip away. <words>22</words>
She moved via the pattern of a spider’s web, her boots silent on the asteroid’s fractured surface, her coat blending with the shadows. <words>23</words>
The senator emerged, his smile superficially profound, a mask for the greed that had hollowed him. <words>17</words>
Veyra raised the camera, framing his face through the splatters, each mark a reminder of the worlds she’d watched burn. <words>20</words>
The bus driver’s final route ended with a hiss of hydraulics, the shuttle doors opening like a wound. <words>19</words>
Veyra’s laugh erupted again, sharper this time, as she stepped into the light. <words>13</words>
The senator froze, his guards reaching for weapons that melted in their hands—the asteroid’s atmosphere, thin and venomous, had already done its work. <words>24</words>
Veyra cradled the dawn in trembling hands, the camera capturing the moment the senator’s eyes widened, the moment his lies dissolved into stardust. <words>23</words>
The unforgiving road had led her here, to this baroque asteroid, to this final act of theft. <words>17</words>
She lowered the camera, its lens now clean, the paint washed away by the senator’s tears. <words>16</words>
The bus driver’s shuttle departed, leaving only the echo of Veyra’s laugh, a sound that would linger until the asteroid’s next revolution. <words>22</words>
She walked away, her coat still black, her hands still trembling, the dawn now hers to keep. <words>18</words>
The unforgiving road had demanded a price, but Veyra had paid it in spider silk and starlight. <words>19</words>
