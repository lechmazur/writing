The cavern cathedral’s phosphorescent flora pulsed like a fractured heart, their bioluminescent glow casting jagged shadows on the hermit’s frayed robe. <words>17</words> Marlowe, the astute hermit, had not spoken aloud in seven years, not since the water systems failed and the city above abandoned this subterranean sanctum. <words>34</words> His only companion was a blunt scissor, its handles wrapped in duct tape, which he used to trim the overgrown vines choking the ancient pipes. <words>52</words> Strangely effective, the tool had become an extension of his resolve—a symbol of stubborn hope in a world that had forgotten him. <words>69</words>

At the moment the elevator arrived to the empty floor, its metallic groan echoed through the cavern like a death rattle. <words>83</words> Marlowe froze, the scissor hovering above a patch of iridescent moss. <words>90</words> No one had ridden that elevator since the quarantine. <words>97</words> Yet here it was, creaking open to reveal… nothing. <words>103</words> A draft of stale air carried the faint scent of fresh-baked bread. <words>110</words> Marlowe’s nose twitched. <words>112</words> Impossible. <words>114</words> The last bakery had shuttered decades ago. <words>119</words>

He descended the spiral staircase to the elevator shaft, clutching the scissor like a talisman. <words>131</words> The scent grew stronger, a golden thread weaving through the cavern’s damp chill. <words>140</words> Despairing humor curdled in his throat—*Of course*, he thought, *the apocalypse sends a ghost with croissants*. <words>153</words> But when he reached the lobby, the bread’s aroma led him not to a specter, but to a rusted control panel. <words>164</words> The scent emanated from a crack in the wall, where a single loaf, still warm, sat atop a mound of soil. <words>174</words>

Marlowe pried open the panel with his scissor, revealing a network of corroded valves. <words>183</words> The water systems’ failure had been deliberate, he realized—a slow suicide by neglect. <words>191</words> He laughed, a sound like gravel in a tin can. <words>197</words> *Amplify this*, he thought, jamming the scissor into a valve. <words>204</words> The scent of bread sharpened, a trigger. <words>209</words> He hacked at the vines choking the pipes, each snip releasing a surge of pressure. <words>217</words> The cavern’s flora flared brighter, their light reflecting off the scissor’s dull blade. <words>226</words>

By dawn, water gushed from the pipes, hissing through the cavern like a choir of ghosts. <words>236</words> The bread’s scent faded, but Marlowe kept the loaf on his workbench, a reminder. <words>245</words> Isolation had sharpened his mind, but the bread—*strangely effective*—had amplified his will. <words>255</words> He smiled, a rare thing, as the elevator whirred to life again. <words>262</words> This time, he didn’t flinch. <words>266</words> Let them come. <words>269</words> He had a city to drown in light. <words>274</words>
