The mountain weather station clung to the cliff like a steel barnacle, its windows rattling as the wind combed through the pines. [27] Lirael, the fault-tolerant oracle, adjusted her spectacles and traced the edge of a botanical illustration pinned to the wall—a delicate watercolor of *Arctostaphylos uva-ursi*, its berries bleeding faintly into the paper. [51] After the fever broke, her certainties had begun to sway, as if the storm outside had seeped into her bones. [75] She was peripherally aware of the station’s crew muttering about “equipment glitches” and “static in the readings,” but her focus remained on the illustration, its margins frayed where she’d smudged graphite trying to annotate the plant’s supposed resilience. [113]

The oracle’s role was to predict, to map probabilities into neat grids. [124] But since the fever, her algorithms frayed at the edges. [135] She’d started occupying margins—literal and metaphorical—scribbling notes in the white space of reports, pressing her palm to the cold glass to feel the storm’s tremor. [159] The station’s director, a man with a mustache like frost, had frowned. “Oracles don’t *feel* the weather,” he’d said. “They quantify it.” [178] Lirael knew he was right. She also knew he’d never tasted the metallic tang of a swallowed truth. [194]

That truth had arrived three nights prior, when the fever’s haze lifted. [205] She’d dreamed of the illustration’s bearberry, its roots twisting through soil and stone, and woken gasping, certain she’d forgotten something vital. [225] Now she paced the station’s narrow halls, her boots echoing, the botanical print tucked under her arm. [237] The crew avoided her; they’d always found her eerily precise, but lately her gaze lingered too long on cracks in the walls, on the way the wind’s howl dipped and rose like a question. [263]

At midnight, she crept into the observation deck. [270] The aurora rippled above, green and violet, a celestial shroud. [280] Lirael unrolled the illustration on a workbench, her fingers smudging the ink as she traced the plant’s veins. [295] *Fault-tolerant*, she thought. The term meant she could endure errors, compensate for gaps. [309] But what if the error was *her*? What if the truth she’d swallowed—a lie about the station’s stability, a cover-up of seismic data—had rooted itself in her, growing heavier each day? [337]

She pressed her forehead to the cold glass. [342] The mountain’s shadow stretched across the valley, a jagged tear in the aurora’s glow. [355] Peripherally, she noticed the director’s office door ajar, light spilling onto the floor. [367] Inside, she found his desk littered with maps, their edges curled from humidity. [378] A folder labeled “QUARANTINE” sat open, its contents a blur of redacted paragraphs. [390] Her hands trembled as she flipped through: mentions of “structural fatigue,” “evacuation protocols,” dates circled in ink. [409] The truth had a weight now, a density that pulled at her ribs. [421]

Back in the observation deck, she smudged the illustration again, this time with a charcoal pencil. [434] She drew the bearberry’s roots deeper, thicker, until they clawed into the paper’s fibers. [446] *Occupying margins*, she realized. That’s what she’d been doing—not just with the drawing, but with her life. [460] The oracle’s logic demanded certainty, but certainty was a lie here. The mountain was crumbling. The station was a lie. And she… she was the lie’s keeper. [483]

The aurora flickered, as if the sky itself were wincing. [490] Lirael rolled the illustration into a tube and tucked it under her coat. [502] Down in the village, she’d find someone who remembered how to listen to the land, not just measure it. [517] The director would call it irrational. She called it survival. [528]

As she descended the winding road, the wind carried a scent of damp earth and pine. [541] The botanical print pressed against her side, its smudged edges a map of her own fractures. [555] She’d carry the truth now, let it root in her until it broke her open or set her free. [572] The aurora dimmed, but its sorrow lingered, a reminder that even oracles could bleed. [588]

By dawn, she reached the village. [593] An old herbalist with hands like tree bark accepted the illustration, nodding as she pointed to the bearberry. [611] “*Arctostaphylos*,” the woman said. “It grows where the soil’s thin. Where the world shows its cracks.” [630] Lirael smiled, her first real smile in weeks. [639] The weight of the truth had not crushed her. It had anchored her. [653]

Back at the station, the director would rage. The crew would whisper. But Lirael no longer cared. [672] She’d learned to sway. To let the margins occupy her. [685] And in the auroral sorrow of that mountain morning, she finally felt whole. [700]
