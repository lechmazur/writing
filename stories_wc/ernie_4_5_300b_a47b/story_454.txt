The funhouse entrance loomed like a skeletal grin, its peeling paint cracking under the moon’s cold gaze. <words>15</words> Jax, a reckless smuggler with a reputation for dodging both bullets and consequences, leaned against the rusted gate, his breath fogging the air. <words>32</words> In his palm rested a pressed four-leaf clover encased in glass—a relic from his sister’s pocket, the only thing she’d left him before vanishing into the Wastes. <words>51</words>  

He’d agreed to meet the *Ghost Runners*, an outsider group that dealt in secrets and survival, at this haunted relic. <words>66</words> Their condition: prove his loyalty by navigating the funhouse’s labyrinth, a place where maps tore at the threshold, dividing the known from the unknown. <words>87</words> Jax’s motivation was simple—acceptance. The Runners had resources he needed to find his sister, and he’d dramatize any risk to earn their trust. <words>107</words>  

A synchronized beep erupted from his watch and the device strapped to his thigh—a signal from Mara, the Runners’ enigmatic leader. <words>124</words> *“Time to dance,”* she’d said. Jax grinned, rationally emotional; he calculated odds but let hope seep in. <words>138</words> The funhouse’s entrance creaked open, revealing a hallway of distorted mirrors. His reflection splintered into a dozen versions of himself, each one wilder, more desperate. <words>158</words>  

He pressed the clover to his chest, its glass cold against his racing heart. <words>171</words> The map in his pocket tore precisely here, as promised. Beyond lay chaos: a carousel of broken horses, a hall of doors that led nowhere, and whispers that slithered like snakes. <words>193</words> Jax’s watch beeped again. Mara’s voice crackled: *“Follow the light. But don’t trust it.”* <words>209</words>  

He stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of decay and cotton candy. <words>222</words> A laugh track echoed, jarring and artificial. Jax’s rational mind noted escape routes; his emotional core clung to the clover. <words>241</words> Distant companionship—that’s what Mara had offered. Not friendship, but a pact forged in shared desperation. <words>258</words>  

The funhouse shifted. Walls breathed, floors tilted. Jax’s boots slipped on a slick patch of fake snow. <words>272</words> He caught himself, the clover digging into his skin. *“Almost there,”* Mara’s voice buzzed. <words>286</words> The light flickered ahead—a neon sign spelling *EXIT* in blood-red letters. <words>299</words>  

Jax laughed, a sound edged with jubilant despair. He’d survived worse, but this? This was a game. <words>314</words> He slammed his palm against the exit door. It swung open to reveal Mara, her face illuminated by a single bulb. <words>330</words> She held a matching clover. “You kept it,” she said, not a question. <words>343</words>  

“Distant companionship requires tokens,” Jax replied, tossing her the glass case. <words>357</words> She caught it, her smile sharp. The watch alarms beeped in unison, a dirge for the unknown they’d just conquered. <words>375</words>
