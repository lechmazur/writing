Marla Voss, the vigilant orchardist who’d never missed a dawn harvest in thirty years, traded her pruning shears for a lab coat at the Holloway Paper Airplane Test Facility, her sardonic glee masking the void left by her daughter’s unsolved disappearance. <words>33</words>
Each Tuesday, she arrived precisely at 7:00 a.m.—never tardy, not even when the facility’s flickering neon sign buzzed like a trapped wasp—to volunteer as a “trajectory analyst,” a title that amused her more than it should. <words>59</words>
Her task: catalog the flight patterns of experimental paper planes, but Marla’s true work began when she noticed the *patterns* in the data—spirals, zigzags, and loops that mirrored the iridescent eyespots of a peacock’s tail, a motif she’d once etched into her orchard’s fence to ward off crows. <words>84</words>
“You’re overthinking it,” Dr. Renner, the facility’s lead engineer, would say, adjusting his spectacles. But Marla knew better. The peacock’s tail wasn’t random; it was a code, a language of survival. If nature could hide messages in feathers, why not in paper airplanes? <words>74</words>
One rain-lashed Thursday, she found it: a sequence of failed launches that, when plotted on graph paper, formed a perfect Fibonacci spiral—the same ratio governing peacock plumage. Her hands trembled as she reached into her pocket for the antique letter seal, its brass surface engraved with a peacock, a relic from her daughter’s childhood. <words>81</words>
“This isn’t aerodynamics,” she muttered, slapping the seal onto a report. “It’s a conspiracy.” The staff laughed, but Marla pressed on, demonstrating how the seal’s impression—a series of concentric circles—matched the spiral’s golden ratio. “Someone’s testing *us*,” she insisted, her voice sharp with sardonic glee. “Not just planes.” <words>76</words>
Over weeks, she cross-referenced launch times with facility maintenance logs, employee schedules, even the cafeteria’s rotating menu. The peacock’s tail became her compass: when planes veered left, a new janitor started; when they nosedived, the security cameras malfunctioned. Coincidence? Marla didn’t believe in them. <words>67</words>
Her breakthrough came during a midnight shift. A plane labeled “Project Icarus” soared 200 feet—triple the usual distance—before vanishing into a storm cloud. Marla checked the seal’s date: her daughter’s birthday. The cafeteria had served peach cobbler that day, her favorite. <words>53</words>
“You’re paranoid,” Renner said, but Marla’s demonstration left him pale. She’d mapped the conspiracy’s heartbeat: a shadowy group using the facility to test surveillance drones disguised as paper planes, their flight paths encoding data for unknown recipients. The peacock’s tail was their signature. <words>60</words>
When the FBI raided Holloway, Marla stood beside agents, her orchardist’s hands steady as she explained the seal’s role—a “calling card” left by the conspirators. Renner was arrested, muttering about “artistic licenses.” Marla smiled. Justice, like a peacock’s plumage, was best revealed in layers. <words>61</words>
Later, she planted a peacock-feather amulet beside her daughter’s grave. “I found your pattern,” she whispered, her sardonic glee softening into something like peace. The orchardist had become a detective, and the world, for once, made a strange, beautiful sense. <words>48</words>
