The exiled fortress floated above the scorching deserts like a tarnished silver coin, its spires clawing at a bruise-colored sky. <words>18</words>
In the final minute before the library shut its doors, Kael, a sorrowful apothecary with ink-stained hands and a heart like a shriveled herb, knelt before a shelf of family recipes bound in cracked leather. <words>38</words>
His mother’s spidery script filled the pages—recipes for potions to soothe fevered minds, to mend broken bones, to coax silent tongues into speech. <words>30</words>
But the last recipe was a riddle: *“Bifurcate the dream catcher’s weave, decode its threads, and the oracle shall drink.”* <words>26</words>
Kael’s fingers trembled as he withdrew a plastic spoon from his apron pocket, its handle roughly refined from desert sandstone, its bowl polished by years of stirring hope into bitter brews. <words>37</words>
The library’s guardian, a withered woman with eyes like smoldering coals, hissed, *“You have one minute. The sands fall.”* <words>24</words>
Kael’s throat tightened. The oracle—a creature of smoke and static—had not spoken since the fortress’s exile, its voice silenced by the weight of unspoken prophecies. <words>30</words>
He needed to tempt it. To make it *choose* to speak again. <words>13</words>
The dream catchers hung above the recipe shelf, their hoops woven from thorns, their webs spun from the hair of dead seers. <words>23</words>
Kael’s mother had once said, *“Dreams are the language of the earth. Catch them, and you catch truth.”* <words>20</words>
He gripped the plastic spoon, its edge sharp enough to split a thread. <words>13</words>
With a flick, he bifurcated the nearest dream catcher’s weave, the threads snapping like dry bones. <words>19</words>
A shimmering fragment of dream fell into the spoon—a memory of his mother laughing, her hands dusted with cinnamon. <words>23</words>
*“Painful joy,”* he whispered, the tone of his voice a knife twisting in his chest. <words>16</words>
He added the dream fragment to a vial of amber liquid, stirring it with the spoon until the mixture glowed like molten gold. <words>24</words>
The library’s lights flickered. The guardian muttered, *“Thirty seconds.”* <words>13</words>
Kael hurried to the oracle’s chamber, its door ajar, the air thick with the scent of ozone and regret. <words>21</words>
The oracle hovered in the center of the room, a shifting silhouette against the desert’s red glare. <words>19</words>
*“Drink,”* Kael said, offering the vial. <words>8</words>
The oracle’s form flickered. *“Why?”* <words>6</words>
*“Because you once sang of a world not yet drowned in ash. Because… I miss her.”* <words>19</words>
The oracle’s smoke coiled, then solidified into a hand. It took the vial, drank. <words>16</words>
For a heartbeat, the chamber filled with light—a vision of green fields, of laughter, of a mother’s embrace. <words>21</words>
Then the oracle spoke, its voice a crackling whisper: *“The fortress falls at dawn. But you… you carry the recipe for rebirth.”* <words>30</words>
Kael’s eyes stung. The vision faded. The oracle dissolved into smoke. <words>15</words>
The library’s doors slammed shut. The sands stopped falling. <words>12</words>
Outside, the desert howled. Inside, Kael clutched the plastic spoon, its bowl still glistening with potion. <words>20</words>
He smiled, a painful, joyful thing. The recipes were not just instructions—they were bridges. <words>17</words>
And he, the sorrowful apothecary, had just built one. <words>11</words>
