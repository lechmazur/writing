The jaded locksmith, Elias Voss, stood in the labyrinth orchard atop the colonial town’s highest rooftop, his fingers tracing the rusted iron gates that barred entry to the unclaimed throne room—a relic of a forgotten dynasty. <words>27</words>
Sunlight filtered through the orchard’s twisted apple trees, casting dappled shadows on the moss-eaten stone walls, as Elias adjusted his embroidered gloves, their silver threads glinting like hidden threats. <words>52</words>
He’d come here during painting hours, when the town’s artists flocked to the rooftops to capture the orchard’s eerie beauty, unaware of the throne’s existence—or the locksmith’s true purpose. <words>67</words>
“You permeate this place like a shadow,” a voice purred behind him. Elias turned to find a woman with clay-streaked hands, her eyes sharp beneath a smudged smock. She’d been in his pottery class, though he’d never spoken to her. <words>86</words>
“And you,” he replied, “seem delightfully menacing for someone shaping vases.” Her lips curled. She stepped closer, her boots crunching fallen apples. <words>63</words>
“The throne’s lock isn’t just a puzzle,” she said, nodding at the iron gates. “It’s a test. Open it, and you’ll find the methods to preserve hunting—not of beasts, but of secrets.” Elias’s jaw tightened. She knew. <words>78</words>
He’d spent years mastering locks, not just to fix them, but to protect the old ways: the whispered codes, the blood-rituals, the hunts that kept the town’s elite in power. The throne was the key to it all. <words>69</words>
“Why tell me?” he asked, voice demure but audacious, a challenge masked in civility. She smiled, revealing a row of teeth filed to points. <words>51</words>
“Because you’re the only one jaded enough to try,” she said, producing a clay key from her pocket. “But be warned—the throne demands a price. A memory, a skill, a piece of your soul.” Elias hesitated. <words>68</words>
The orchard’s air thickened with the scent of wet earth and old iron. He thought of his father, a hunter who’d taught him to pick locks by moonlight, to listen for the faint click of a tumbler falling into place. <words>63</words>
“I’ll pay it,” Elias said, taking the key. As he inserted it into the lock, the gates shuddered, and the orchard seemed to hold its breath. The throne room beyond was dim, lit by flickering torches, its walls lined with hunting trophies—antlers, furs, and a single, jagged crown. <words>81</words>
The woman stepped inside, her silhouette merging with the shadows. “Choose wisely,” she said. “The throne’s power isn’t to rule, but to remember. And remembering is the deadliest hunt of all.” Elias sat, the crown cold against his brow. <words>69</words>
Outside, the painters continued their work, unaware that the locksmith had just claimed a throne—not to rule, but to guard the hunt’s dark legacy, his embroidered gloves now stained with the weight of centuries. <words>57</words>
