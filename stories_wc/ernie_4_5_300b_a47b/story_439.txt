Snow hissed against the opera house’s shattered windows, swirling through the derelict lobby like a ghostly chorus. <words>16</words> The mute courier, Lira, tightened her frayed scarf and pressed her palm against the pocket guide to interdimensional travel tucked inside her coat—a relic she’d stolen from a dying scholar’s trunk. <words>34</words> Its leather cover, etched with constellations, hummed faintly, as if reacting to the storm’s fury outside. <words>16</words>  

She’d come to the harbor’s forgotten theater not for shelter, but for answers. <words>12</words> The guide’s margins were scribbled with notes in a language only her mind could decipher, hinting at hidden meanings in chaos. <words>18</words> Tonight, the comet *Veyra’s Tear* would arc overhead, its tail a silver thread binding dimensions. <words>17</words> Lira intended to follow it—not by foot, but by thought. <words>11</words>  

The auditorium reeked of mildew and forgotten dreams. <words>10</words> Snowdrifts piled across red velvet seats, their gold filigree rusted to a sickly green. <words>15</words> Lira climbed the crumbling stage, her boots echoing. <words>8</words> Unassumingly bold, she opened the guide, its pages glowing faintly as the comet breached the clouds. <words>16</words>  

“Generate,” she mouthed silently, tracing a rune for *escape*. <words>10</words> The air thickened, snowflakes suspending mid-fall. <words>9</words> Visions flickered: a library where books screamed, a desert of glass, a ocean of liquid light. <words>17</words> The guide’s words burned in her skull: *To find meaning, one must first unravel the self*. <words>16</words>  

A low hum vibrated through the floorboards. <words>8</words> The comet’s light seeped through the roof, pooling on the stage like liquid mercury. <words>16</words> Lira stepped into it, her body dissolving into stardust. <words>11</words> Cautious enchantment prickled her skin as the opera house vanished, replaced by a corridor of mirrors. <words>17</words> Each reflection showed a different Lira—a thief, a lover, a killer, a saint. <words>14</words>  

“Which is real?” she wondered, though she knew the answer: none. <words>11</words> The guide had warned her—the mind’s escape was not freedom, but a labyrinth of truths. <words>17</words> Yet she pressed on, driven by the scholar’s final scrawl: *Meaning lies in the cracks between worlds*. <words>17</words>  

The corridor ended at a door marked *NOW*. <words>9</words> Behind it, the harbor reappeared, but altered: the storm raged in reverse, snow rising to the sky. <words>17</words> Lira’s throat tightened. <words>4</words> She’d returned, but the guide’s pages now bore her own handwriting: *To escape is to confront*. <words>15</words>  

The comet faded. <words>4</words> Dawn tinged the horizon, gilding the opera house’s ruins. <words>11</words> Lira clutched the guide, its weight a comfort. <words>9</words> She’d found no answers, only more questions—but for the first time, she welcomed them. <words>16</words>  

As she trudged through the snow, the harbor’s lighthouse blinked once, a silent nod to her unassumingly bold leap. <words>19</words> The mind’s escape, she realized, was not a destination, but a compass. <words>13</words> And somewhere, the comet waited to guide her again. <words>12</words>
