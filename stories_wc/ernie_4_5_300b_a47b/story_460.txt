King Elion, an unassuming monarch with a crown of rusted iron, trudged through the acid rain forest, his boots sinking into spongy moss that hissed where droplets burned. <words>22</words> His kingdom had crumbled centuries ago, leaving only him and the whispering trees, their leaves blackened by time and toxins. <words>39</words> Lethargically energetic, he moved with the sluggish urgency of a man who’d forgotten how to rest, his body a map of scars and stories. <words>59</words>  

In his calloused hands, he carried a box of mismatched puzzle pieces, each edge jagged and warped, as if the world itself had been shattered and reassembled wrong. <words>77</words> The box was his compass, his bible, his only claim to legacy—a relic from the Before, when civilization still believed in order. <words>94</words> Now, it was just noise, but he clung to it, to the ember of choice buried in its chaos: *assemble the pieces, or let them remain broken?* <words>113</words>  

He paused, tilting his head as a feather drifted down from a skeletal branch above. <words>126</words> The acid rain had eaten its quills to frayed threads, but its texture intrigued him—rough, yet delicate, a contradiction that made his fingers twitch. <words>143</words> He reached out, letting it settle in his palm, and through the gritty touch, he *perceived* something: a flicker of memory, a fragment of a song his mother had sung before the Collapse. <words>168</words>  

The forest seemed to hold its breath. <words>174</words> Elion’s lethargy sharpened into focus. He knelt, opening the box, and sifted through the pieces, their colors muted by grime. <words>191</words> One fit another, not perfectly, but close enough to suggest a shape—a bird, maybe, or a crown. <words>208</words> He worked methodically, his rough hands trembling as he pressed edges together, the acid rain sizzling on his shoulders. <words>226</words>  

The puzzle wasn’t a map. It wasn’t a answer. It was a *question*: *What do you choose to see?* <words>242</words> Elion laughed, a sound like gravel shifting, and the forest echoed back, prickly with wonder. <words>257</words> He’d always assumed wisdom was something to be cradled, polished, guarded. <words>272</words> But here, in the ruins, it was a feather’s texture, a puzzle’s lie, a choice to keep trying. <words>290</words>  

When the final piece clicked (or didn’t—he couldn’t tell), he stood, the box empty but for dust. <words>306</words> The acid rain fell harder, etching patterns into his skin. <words>319</words> He walked on, not toward anything, just *on*, because to stop was to let the world decide its shape for him. <words>338</words>  

Later, he’d find another feather. Another piece. Another choice. <words>352</words> The forest would burn his hands, his heart, his hope. <words>365</words> But he’d keep perceiving, keep assembling, because the ember wasn’t in the puzzle. <words>382</words> It was in his hands, rough and calloused, cradling the weight of *maybe*. <words>397</words>  

And that, he thought, was enough. <words>404</words>
