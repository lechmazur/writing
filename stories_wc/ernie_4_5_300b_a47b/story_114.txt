The shared dream recording studio hummed with the ghostly echo of a dying god’s last breath, its walls lined with empty frames that pulsed like dormant hearts. <words>22</words> Kael, an apathetic summoner with a knack for enthusiastically lazy gestures, slouched against a rustic coffee grinder he’d dragged into the studio, its wooden gears creaking as if groaning at his presence. <words>47</words> “River wisdom,” he muttered, flicking a pebble at one of the frames. “They said it’s here. But how?” <words>59</words>

The studio’s air shimmered, a remnant of the god’s final exhale, weaving threads of memory into the empty frames. <words>71</words> Kael’s apathy didn’t stir—until he noticed the grinder’s handle matched the grooves of the frames, their edges aligning like puzzle pieces. <words>87</words> “Huh,” he said, dragging himself upright. “Lazy genius strikes again.” <words>97</words>

He spun the grinder’s crank, its rhythm syncing with the frames’ pulse. <words>107</words> Light seeped from the cracks, projecting visions of coral reefs crumbling into silt. <words>118</words> A voice, sharp as riverbed stones, echoed: *“To rebuild, you must first unmake.”* <words>130</words> Kael rolled his eyes but kept grinding, the frames unfolding scenes of his past failures—summoning creatures too weak to mend the reefs, his apathy a wall against hope. <words>150</words>

“Fine,” he sighed, slumping against the grinder. “But I’m not doing the heavy lifting.” <words>162</words> The frames flickered, now showing a path: align the grinder’s shadow with the studio’s central beam, let the god’s residual energy flow through. <words>180</words> Kael yawned, adjusting his position until the shadow snapped into place. <words>192</words> The studio trembled, the river’s wisdom flooding in—a tide of clarity that sharpened his laziness into focus. <words>208</words>

“Coral needs structure,” the voice insisted. “Like these frames. Like your grinder.” <words>220</words> Kael grunted, tossing a handful of ground coffee into the air. The particles hung, forming a map of reef fractures. <words>236</words> “Lazy,” he admitted, “but not stupid.” <words>244</words>

He summoned a spectral eel, its body woven from the studio’s lingering energy, and guided it toward the map. <words>258</words> The eel dissolved into liquid light, seeping into the cracks. <words>269</words> The frames brightened, their emptiness now filled with thriving coral. <words>281</words> Kael leaned back, grinning. “See? Efficiency.” <words>290</words>

The studio sighed, the god’s breath fading into a gentle breeze. <words>302</words> Kael patted the grinder. “Thanks, old girl. You’re… useful.” <words>314</words> The frames dimmed, their purpose fulfilled, but the river’s wisdom lingered—a quiet promise that even apathy could be a catalyst. <words>334</words>

He left the studio, the grinder tucked under his arm, its gears still humming. <words>346</words> Somewhere, coral grew. Somewhere, a lazy summoner smiled. <words>360</words>
