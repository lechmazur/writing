In the velvet observatory at midsummer, where the air hummed with the heat of a thousand unspoken secrets, Lira Veyra adjusted her spectacles and traced the rim of her teacup. [40] As a provenance researcher, she’d spent years piecing together histories from the faintest echoes of objects—a letter’s ink, a photograph’s curl—but today, her focus was on the future. [90] Before the promise loses its glow, she reminded herself, though the words tasted like ash. [115]

Across the room, the transparent violin made of ice crystal rested on a pedestal, its strings shimmering as if threaded with liquid moonlight. [170] Lira had discovered it in the archives of the forgotten, a relic from a time when music could fracture reality. [210] Its provenance was a labyrinth: a composer’s last breath, a storm’s fury, a child’s laugh frozen mid-giggle. [255] Now, it pulsed with a perforated destiny, holes in its fate where choices bled into chaos. [290]

Lira’s hands trembled as she poured fresh coffee into her cup, the dark liquid swirling like a tiny galaxy. [330] She’d always been accidentally telepathic with plants—a quirk that made her office overgrown with ferns and vines—but lately, the gift had spilled into inanimate things. [385] The violin, she sensed, was restless, its ice crystal thirsty for meaning. [415]

“Propagate,” she whispered, dipping her finger into the coffee. [430] The stain bloomed across the porcelain, a Rorschach test of possibility. [450] She leaned in, her mind fusing with the patterns, and saw: a throne room, a crown, a shadow with her face. [485] The empire’s heart, beating in time with her own. [505]

The observatory’s velvet curtains stirred, though no breeze dared enter. [530] Lira’s plants whispered warnings, their leaves curling like fists. [550] She knew the weight of dreams—how they could crush or carry, depending on the angle of the light. [590] This one, though, was a supernova: to usurp the throne, to rewrite the empire’s creed, to let the violin’s music unravel the seams of reality. [645]

But the cost? She glanced at the ice crystal, now glowing faintly violet. [670] Perforated destiny meant holes in her own future, gaps where love or loss might slip through unnoticed. [715] The mulberry ache in her chest deepened, a bruise that refused to fade. [740]

Outside, the midsummer sun blazed, indifferent to her dilemma. [760] Lira’s fingers drifted to the violin’s strings, her touch melting the ice just enough to hum. [795] The sound was a thousand years old, a lullaby for a world that never was. [820]

“Propagate,” she repeated, this time to the plants. [840] They responded, vines creeping up the pedestal, roots burrowing into the observatory’s foundation. [875] The coffee stain shifted, revealing a second path: a garden, a child, a life unburdened by crowns. [910]

Lira laughed, a sound brittle as ice. [925] To weigh a dream against an empire was to stand on a knife’s edge, blindfolded. [955] Yet here she was, coffee-stained hands trembling, heart split between two futures. [985]

The violin’s strings snapped, one by one, each break a note of resolution. [1010] Lira caught the falling ice shards, letting them melt into her palms. [1030] The observatory’s velvet walls seemed to exhale, releasing the tension of a thousand unmade choices. [1065]

She stood, coffee cup abandoned, and walked to the window. [1085] Below, the empire sprawled, ignorant of the woman who held its fate in her hands. [1115] Lira closed her eyes, letting the plants’ whispers wash over her. [1135]

“Propagate,” she said one last time, not to the future, but to herself. [1160] And then she began to dismantle the dream, piece by piece, until only the ache remained—a mulberry stain on the fabric of the world. [1200]

The violin, now silent, waited. [1210] Somewhere, a child laughed, and the ice crystal shattered into stardust. [1235]
