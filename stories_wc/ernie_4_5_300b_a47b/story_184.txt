Jeb, the scrappy tavern-hand with a knack for mopping up spills and spilled secrets, found himself scrubbing the same floorboard for the third time that hour—predictably unpredictable, like the patrons who sloshed ale on it. <words>27</words>
Outside, the world was a vacuum chamber garden, glass domes humming with artificial sunlight and soil that never felt the touch of rain, but Jeb’s mind wandered to the dried-up riverbed beyond town, where fossilized footprints crisscrossed like ancient code. <words>56</words>
He’d always believed those footprints held the key to something, though he couldn’t say what—until the day he pocketed a broken collection of seashells from the tavern’s “curiosities” shelf, their jagged edges sharp enough to draw blood, and decided to randomize his fate. <words>70</words>
“Time’s a river,” the old bartender had once muttered, “but sometimes it dries up.” Jeb figured if he followed the fossilized prints backward, while the sands of time flowed backward (a trick he’d heard whispers of in the garden’s shadowed corners), he might catapult his imagination beyond known realms. <words>89</words>
The vacuum chamber garden’s air tasted sterile, like regret, but Jeb pressed his palm against the glass dome until it fogged, then traced the fossilized prints in reverse—a method as absurd as it was desperate. <words>57</words>
The shells in his pocket clicked like a countdown. He’d read once that seashells held the echo of oceans, and broken ones, maybe the echo of something shattered but not lost. <words>43</words>
As he walked, the garden’s synthetic birds began to sing in reverse, their melodies fraying at the edges. Jeb grinned—flippant solemnity was his specialty. “You’re predictably unpredictable,” he’d told the bartender last week, after spilling a tray of drinks. Now he meant it as a mantra. <words>64</words>
The dried riverbed appeared suddenly, a crack in the earth where the garden’s illusion faltered. The fossilized footprints led deeper, and Jeb followed, each step a rebellion against the garden’s carefully curated order. <words>44</words>
He knelt, pressing a shell to the print. The sand beneath him shuddered, and for a moment, he felt the pull of something inescapable—a calling as undeniable as gravity, as fickle as the wind. <words>46</words>
The shells grew warm, then hot, their broken edges glowing like embers. Jeb laughed, a sound sharp and bright, and hurled them into the air. They exploded into a shower of light, each fragment a fleeting image: a shipwreck, a storm, a hand reaching from the depths. <words>60</words>
When the light faded, the riverbed was gone. In its place stood a door, weathered and ancient, leaning against the vacuum chamber’s glass. Jeb pushed it open without hesitation. <words>37</words>
Beyond lay not the garden, nor the tavern, but a place where time pooled in puddles and the air tasted of salt and possibility. The shells, now whole again, rested in his palm. <words>38</words>
“Predictably unpredictable,” Jeb murmured, stepping through. The door vanished behind him, but he didn’t look back. Some callings, he thought, were meant to be answered. <words>35</words>
