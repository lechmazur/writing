The abandoned spaceport customs office reeked of rust and regret, its server rooms humming like the ghosts of forgotten transactions. <words>20</words> Kael Veyra, a cheerless duelist with a reputation for breaking bones instead of hearts, paced the flickering corridor, his boots clacking against cracked tiles. <words>38</words> His mission—to learn the power of forgiveness—felt absurd here, amid the skeletal remains of bureaucracy. <words>53</words> Yet he clung to it, driven by a single, maggoty wooden chest that rattled ominously in his grip, its contents a secret even he feared to name. <words>76</words>

The chest had been his father’s, a relic from a time when the Veyra family cooked “miracle” dishes said to elasticize the soul. <words>92</words> But their recipes, mutated through generations of pride and secrecy, had twisted into something darker. <words>108</words> Kael’s fatal flaw was his precision: he’d spent years refining the recipes, unaware that each adjustment had warped the magic into a weapon. <words>128</words> Now, the chest’s rattling wasn’t just wood—it was the sound of his family’s curse, a living thing straining to escape. <words>145</words>

Amid the server rooms’ electronic hum, Kael pried open the chest. <words>156</words> Inside lay a crumbling cookbook, its pages scrawled with notes in his father’s jagged hand. <words>168</words> “*Elasticize through unexpected mutations*,” he read, the words bittersweet. <words>178</words> His father had tried to innovate, to bend the recipes into something forgiving, but the mutations had backfired, trapping the family’s sins in the chest. <words>197</words> Kael’s hands trembled as he flipped to a recipe titled “*Heart’s Mercy Stew*.” The ingredients list included “a tear of regret” and “a pinch of humility”—things the Veyras had never stocked. <words>221</words>

He gathered rusted pots from the customs office’s derelict kitchen, their surfaces etched with the logos of long-dead corporations. <words>238</words> As he chopped moldy space-cabbage (a close cousin to humility, he decided), the servers behind him pulsed like a mechanical heartbeat. <words>257</words> The stew bubbled, its aroma shifting from putrid to strangely sweet. <words>269</words> Kael hesitated, then added his own tear, salt and shame mingling in the broth. <words>282</words>

The chest rattled violently now, its wood splintering. <words>291</words> Kael braced himself as the stew’s steam coiled into a shape—his father, translucent and trembling. <words>304</words> “You elasticized the curse,” the ghost whispered, “but forgiveness isn’t a recipe. It’s… letting go.” <words>321</words> The chest burst open, releasing a swarm of glowing motes that dissolved the office’s grime, revealing faded murals of travelers embracing. <words>340</words>

Kael’s precise mind rebelled. Forgiveness wasn’t a variable he could measure. <words>354</words> Yet as the motes swirled, he felt the stew’s warmth seep into his bones, loosening the rigid edges of his soul. <words>371</words> The ghost faded, leaving only the cookbook and a single, unmarked page. <words>384</words> Kael smiled, a first for him, as he scribbled a new recipe: “*Bittersweet Reckoning Soup—serve hot, with an open hand.*” <words>403</words>

The server rooms kept humming, but now their rhythm matched his heartbeat. <words>417</words> The chest, empty and still, became a seat. Kael sat, not as a duelist, but as a man learning to cook again—this time, with ingredients that couldn’t be quantified. <words>440</words>
