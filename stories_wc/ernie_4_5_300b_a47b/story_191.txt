The mist clung to the island like a second skin, swallowing footsteps and whispers alike. <words>11</words> Elias Voss, a sober cardsharp whose hands had never trembled at a bet, stood beneath a gnarled oak, the antique ink well cradled in his left palm. <words>28</words> Its brass surface was etched with symbols only the dead could read, and it pulsed faintly, as if breathing. <words>41</words> He’d found it in the hull of a sunken ship, along with a journal that claimed the well could “see through the veil” by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers’ dreams. <words>62</words>  

At the moment coffee cooled in an abandoned mug left on a moss-crusted rock, Elias’s resolve hardened. <words>77</words> He’d come to this place to dare the unimaginable: to prove that fate wasn’t a river but a puzzle he could solve. <words>91</words> The ink well’s power required hushed pleas, uttered in tones so boisterously quiet they bordered on silence. <words>105</words> He’d practiced for weeks, muttering into the dark, “Show me the thread.”  

A gust of wind ripped through the mist, carrying the scent of salt and decay. <words>120</words> Elias dipped a finger into the well’s inky depths, and the liquid began to swirl, projecting visions onto the fog. <words>132</words> He saw a woman’s face—a stranger—twice: once in a dream where she drowned, once in a dream where she flew. <words>145</words> The journal had said such doubles were “echoes of choice,” fragments of lives unlived. <words>155</words>  

“Hasten,” he hissed, though the word felt like a betrayal. <words>162</words> The well’s visions accelerated, showing him islands that weren’t there, storms that hadn’t happened, and a hand reaching for his own through the mist. <words>177</words> Grudging admiration welled in his chest—for the well’s cruel precision, for the way it refused to coddle. <words>190</words> This was no parlor trick; it was a mirror held to chaos.  

A low hum vibrated in his bones. The ink well grew hot, searing his palm. <words>205</words> Elias didn’t drop it. Instead, he leaned closer, as if daring the artifact to burn him alive. <words>217</words> The visions sharpened: the woman again, now old, her eyes meeting his across time. <words>228</words> She mouthed a word he couldn’t hear, but her expression—a mix of pity and triumph—was unmistakable.  

The coffee mug shattered on the rocks below. Elias jerked back, the ink well cooling instantly. <words>247</words> The mist parted briefly, revealing a path he hadn’t noticed before, winding toward a cliff where the ocean roared. <words>259</words> He knew, without knowing how, that the well’s final test awaited there. <words>269</words>  

“You want me to jump?” he muttered, the plea hushed but fierce. <words>278</words> The well didn’t answer. It never did. But the air thrummed, and Elias smiled, a rare, genuine thing. <words>291</words> Daring the unimaginable meant trusting the unknowable. He tucked the well into his coat and began to hasten toward the cliff, his steps steady, his heart a drum. <words>310</words>  

The mist swallowed him whole. Somewhere, a stranger dreamed of flying. <words>322</words>
