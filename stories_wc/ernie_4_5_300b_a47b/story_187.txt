The witch’s familiar training ground lay silent at dusk, its moss-choked stones humming with latent power. <words>14</words> Kael, a stoic wanderer with eyes like frost-bitten iron, knelt where the final formula had just been wiped from the dirt by a teacher’s trembling hand. <words>32</words> His motive was simple: to archive ritual practices the world had forgotten, to bind them in a tome that would outlive empires. <words>48</words> But the teacher, a woman whose voice could unravel minds, had erased the incantation too swiftly. <words>61</words>  

Kael’s fingers brushed the ground, and he felt it—a thread of dread, a trail of nightmares left by the teacher’s guilt. <words>77</words> He rose, his cloak swallowing the twilight, and began to impose his will on the shadows. <words>90</words> The path led him to an abandoned cabin, its roof caved in, its floorboards rotting into the earth. <words>104</words> One board, though, lay apart—mesmerizingly bland, its grain so uniform it seemed a lie. <words>117</words>  

He pried it free, the wood splitting with a sigh. <words>125</words> Beneath, etched in charcoal so old it crumbled at his touch, was the formula the teacher had scrubbed away. <words>137</words> A necessary lie, Kael realized: the teacher had hidden the ritual to protect her students from its corruption. <words>150</words> But Kael’s archive demanded truth, even if it burned. <words>159</words>  

The teacher found him there, her familiar—a raven with eyes like molten silver—perched on her shoulder. <words>172</words> “You think you understand sacrifice,” she hissed, her voice a blade wrapped in silk. <words>184</words> Kael met her gaze, his voice brash yet tender. “I understand that some truths must be preserved, even if they hurt.” <words>201</words>  

She lunged, but Kael was already moving, the floorboard clutched to his chest. <words>211</words> The raven screeched, and the ground shuddered as the training ground’s wards flared. <words>223</words> Kael fled, following the nightmare trail deeper into the woods, the formula burning in his mind like a second heartbeat. <words>237</words>  

By dawn, he stood in a clearing, the floorboard laid bare before him. <words>247</words> He traced the etchings, his fingers steady, and began to transcribe. <words>257</words> The teacher’s lie had been a shield; his archive would be a mirror. <words>269</words>  

When the first rays of sunlight pierced the trees, the formula was complete. <words>280</words> Kael tucked the board into his pack, its blandness now a mask for the chaos it contained. <words>294</words> The teacher’s voice echoed in his mind, a warning he refused to heed. <words>306</words>  

He walked on, the wanderer’s path never straight, never kind. <words>316</words> The archive would grow, and with it, the weight of necessary lies. <words>328</words> But Kael’s resolve was unyielding, his tenderness a blade honed against the world’s brutality. <words>343</words>  

Somewhere behind him, the raven laughed, and the woods held their breath. <words>357</words>
