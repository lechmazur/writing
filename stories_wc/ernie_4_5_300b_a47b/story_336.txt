The weary undertaker stood in the shadowed courtyard of the ancient Persian palace, its marble columns carved with celestial maps, as the hush after a car backfire in a silent street settled over the city. <words>26</words> He had buried kings and paupers alike, but tonight, he carried a different weight: the astronomical clock, its gears whirring like a trapped heart, had revealed a truth he could not unsee. <words>52</words> Tribal knowledge, etched into the clock’s bronze face by forgotten astronomers, spoke of a time when the sun’s path would align with the palace’s hidden chambers, sealing them forever. <words>73</words> The undertaker, whose hands had grown calloused from digging graves, rarely found practical use for such lore—until now. <words>90</words>

He had learned the method by following sun paths, tracing the arc of dawn across the palace’s domes, noting how light pooled in certain corridors at precise hours. <words>113</words> The clock’s hands, now frozen at midnight, had once moved in tandem with the sun, a dance of light and shadow that guarded the palace’s deepest secrets. <words>135</words> But the undertaker’s motivation was not greed or curiosity; it was hope—a desperate, placid ferocity to hold onto light in the absolute dark. <words>156</words>

The car’s backfire had been a sign, a crack in the silence that mirrored the fissure in his soul. <words>172</words> He moved through the palace like a ghost, his lantern casting elongated shadows on walls adorned with murals of constellations. <words>191</words> In the chamber of the clock, he lit incense, its smoke curling toward the ceiling as if answering the stars. <words>208</words> The gears, oiled with centuries of neglect, groaned as he wound them, each turn a prayer. <words>223</words>

When the sun’s first rays pierced the high windows, the clock sprang to life, its chimes echoing through the halls like a funeral dirge turned triumphant. <words>244</words> The undertaker followed the light, his footsteps echoing in the empty corridors, until he reached a door sealed by time. <words>260</words> The sun’s path had revealed the key: a beam of light struck a hidden mechanism, and the door swung open. <words>276</words>

Inside, he found not treasure, but a single scroll, its parchment yellowed but intact. <words>290</words> The tribal knowledge it held was rarely practical—a map of constellations, a poem about the cycle of life and death, a reminder that even in darkness, stars endure. <words>312</words> He rolled the scroll into his coat, its weight a comfort. <words>322</words>

The undertaker knew the palace would soon imprison itself again, the sun’s path shifting, the door sealing shut until the next alignment. <words>340</words> But he had what he needed: hope, not as a fleeting illusion, but as a choice, a act of placid ferocity. <words>356</words>

As he stepped outside, the city stirred, the car’s backfire a distant memory. <words>368</words> The undertaker walked home, the scroll safe in his pocket, the clock’s chimes still ringing in his ears. <words>384</words> In the absolute dark, he would light a candle, read the poem, and remember that even the rarest knowledge, rarely practical, could be a lantern in the storm. <words>405</words>
