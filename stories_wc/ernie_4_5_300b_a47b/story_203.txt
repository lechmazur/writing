The exorcist’s fingers trembled as she pressed wildflowers into a leather-bound journal, their petals crumbling like the lies she’d inherited. <words>17</words> Amid the clutter of half-assembled toys—a spaceship, a robot, a dollhouse missing its roof—she waited for the sound that would force her to act. <words>32</words> Orbital debris glittered outside the station’s viewport, fragments of dead satellites and shattered dreams, a metaphor she refused to voice. <words>48</words>  

Her stage fright wasn’t the usual kind; it was a visceral terror of being unmasked, of revealing that her family’s legacy of banishing spirits was built on a foundation of deceit. <words>67</words> The pressed flowers, a gift from her grandmother, were the only truth she owned—delicate, mortal, and real. <words>80</words> She’d inherited more than rituals and incantations; she’d inherited the weight of “never”—*never* question the ancestors, *never* admit doubt, *never* let the world see you falter. <words>102</words>  

Tonight, she would submerge herself in the ritual, not by choice, but by the sound of a key turning in the lock. <words>116</words> The station’s airlock hissed open, and her client stepped inside, a politician whose guilt manifested as a spectral hound. <words>128</words> The man’s eyes flicked to the toys, then to the journal. “You’re younger than I expected,” he said, his voice slick with disdain. <words>142</words>  

She didn’t reply. Defiance lived in her silence, a hush that dared the universe to challenge her. <words>155</words> The hound materialized behind him, its jaws dripping with lies she recognized as her own—*never good enough*, *never strong enough*, *never worthy*. <words>172</words>  

“Begin,” the politician snapped.  

She knelt, placing the journal beneath the dollhouse. The toys weren’t props; they were her method, a child’s faith reshaped into armor. <words>193</words> As she chanted, the station shuddered, debris colliding outside like a chorus of ghosts. <words>203</words> The hound lunged, but she caught its jaw in her hands, pressing her forehead to its snout. “I inherit your lies,” she whispered, “but I sculpt possibility from your ashes.” <words>228</words>  

The creature dissolved into smoke, and the politician screamed. She didn’t flinch. <words>238</words>  

Afterward, she submerged the journal in a basin of water, watching the ink bleed. The flowers floated, unbroken. <words>253</words> The politician fled, but she stayed, assembling the dollhouse’s roof. Never usual, she thought. Never again a prisoner of “never.” <words>271</words>  

When the key turned in the lock again, she didn’t startle. Another client, another ghost. She smiled, picking up the robot. Its joints clicked like a countdown. <words>292</words>  

The debris outside glowed, a constellation of rebirth. She’d learned to dance in the hush between exorcism and creation, her stage fright a compass, not a cage. <words>313</words> The lies were gone. What remained was hers—wild, fragile, and unyielding. <words>326</words>  

By dawn, the toys were complete. The spaceship, the robot, the dollhouse: each a vessel for the possibilities she’d carved from the dark. <words>344</words> She pressed another flower into the journal, its petals gleaming with dew. The orbital debris drifted on, indifferent, eternal. <words>363</words>  

She whispered, “I am the inheritance.” The lock clicked. The next client waited. <words>376</words>  

And in the defiant hush, she began again. <words>383</words>
