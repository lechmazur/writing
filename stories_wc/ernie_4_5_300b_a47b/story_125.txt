The abandoned space station control room smelled of rust and regret, its flickering lights casting shadows over stacks of misdelivered packages. <words>16</words>
Lira, an underachieving mage with a penchant for "exceptionally usual" magic, slouched in a pilot’s chair, kicking her boots onto a console. <words>27</words>
Her heritage—a lineage of star-weaving sorcerers—felt like a joke she’d never bothered to learn the punchline to. <words>28</words>
But today, she’d vowed to spring a trap on her own limitations, even if it meant sifting through decades of cosmic junk mail. <words>33</words>
A package labeled *URGENT: GRANDMASTER’S EYES ONLY* caught her eye. <words>16</words>
It wasn’t addressed to her, but "misdelivered" was her middle name. <words>14</words>
Inside lay a doll head with blinking eyes, its porcelain skin cracked like a dried riverbed. <words>21</words>
The eyes, however, glowed faintly violet—a color reserved for her family’s magic. <words>19</words>
"Bored excitement," she muttered, propping the head on a control panel. <words>16</words>
As she chanted a half-remembered incantation, the eyes flickered faster, projecting a hologram of a star map. <words>25</words>
The map pointed to a boundary marker on the farmland outside, where her family’s old estate once stood. <words>25</words>
The land was being sold tomorrow, erasing the last physical tie to her ancestors. <words>21</words>
Lira’s chest tightened. She’d always dismissed her heritage as "exceptionally usual"—a cop-out for her laziness. <words>27</words>
But the doll head’s map wasn’t just a relic; it was a challenge. <words>16</words>
Unveiling her family’s secrets meant confronting the trap she’d set for herself: apathy. <words>20</words>
She grabbed the head and sprinted through the station’s corroding corridors, her boots clanging like a countdown. <words>24</words>
Outside, the farmland stretched under a twilight sky, the boundary marker a rusted iron post. <words>22</words>
The doll head’s eyes blinked in rhythm with her pulse as she pressed it against the post. <words>22</words>
A surge of violet light erupted, weaving constellations into the air. <words>16</words>
The ground trembled, revealing a hidden chamber filled with star charts and spellbooks. <words>20</words>
Her ancestors hadn’t been showy; their magic was subtle, woven into the land itself. <words>19</words>
"Exceptionally usual," Lira whispered, tears mixing with laughter. <words>13</words>
The trap had worked. By embracing the misdelivered package, she’d unveiled not just her heritage, but her potential. <words>24</words>
Tomorrow, the farmland would be sold, but the magic remained—hers to reclaim. <words>19</words>
She tucked the doll head under her arm, its eyes now closed in peaceful sleep. <words>19</words>
Bored excitement had turned to fierce resolve. <words>10</words>
The control room’s lights died behind her, but Lira walked onward, her shadow stretching long and proud against the stars. <words>26</words>
