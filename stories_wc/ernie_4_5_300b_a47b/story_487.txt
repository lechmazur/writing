The docile bruiser, Lira, cradled the conductor’s baton like a prayer stick, its ivory surface scratched with symbols only she believed were a language. <words>19</words> Amid the drum solos thundering through the greenhouse labyrinth—a maze of glass and thorns where man-eating plants yawned at the rhythm—she knelt, piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards. <words>42</words> The map’s edges were frayed, but the center held: a cryptic X near a fountain of blackened roses. <words>17</words> “To mold a myth from the mud of reality,” she muttered, her voice disturbingly calm, as if dissecting a dandelion’s stem. <words>30</words>  

The plants stirred, their jaws dripping sap. Lira, a wall of muscle with a poet’s heart, had always been gentler than her reputation suggested. <words>23</words> But the baton’s rumor—*raise the dead*—had lured her here, past the labyrinth’s iron gates, where drummers pounded war rhythms to keep the flora docile. <words>31</words> Or so the locals claimed. She didn’t trust them. Language barriers had turned her quest into a game of charades, her gestures misread as threats. <words>29</words>  

“You’ll die,” hissed a gardener, his words slurred by a tongue split into serpentine forks. Lira smiled, her twist of a grin softening her jagged features. <words>24</words> “Death’s just another language,” she said, tucking the map into her belt. The baton glowed faintly, as if sensing her intent. <words>25</words>  

The labyrinth twisted, corridors shifting like a living tongue. Lira followed the map’s fragments, her boots crunching on glass shards. <words>22</words> A Venus flytrap snapped at her wrist; she fed it a leaf from her pocket, its surface etched with the same symbols as the baton. <words>27</words> The plant recoiled, its maw sealing shut. *Interesting*, she thought. The drum solos grew frantic, a frantic heartbeat beneath her feet. <words>28</words>  

At the map’s X, she found the fountain—a spire of obsidian roses, their petals sharp as knives. <words>16</words> The water smelled of rust and old bones. Lira raised the baton, its tip humming. “*Resurrect*,” she whispered, the word foreign even to her. <words>22</words>  

The ground shuddered. The roses writhed, their stems twisting into skeletal hands. <words>15</words> A figure emerged—a conductor, his suit tattered, baton in hand. He opened his mouth, but no sound came. <words>21</words> Lira frowned. The language barrier held. Yet, as the drummer’s solo peaked, the conductor’s baton began to conduct… the air itself. <words>24</words>  

The plants froze. The drums stopped. Silence fell, thick as syrup. <words>13</words> Lira’s calm cracked, just a hair. She’d expected ghosts, not this… *absence*. <words>17</words>  

“You didn’t raise the dead,” said a voice behind her. The serpent-tongued gardener stood in the shadows, holding the last map fragment. <words>22</words> “You raised the *silence*.” Lira turned, her bruiser’s frame tensing. But the gardener tossed her the fragment—a sketch of the baton, labeled *“Voice of the Void”*. <words>19</words>  

She laughed, brash and tender, the sound echoing through the glass corridors. The myth was muddier now, but mud could be molded. <words>20</words> The drummer started again, slower, softer. Lira walked on, baton in hand, ready to translate the next language. <words>23</words>
