<story>
The ethereal plains stretched endless under a bruised sky, where the last resource war had scorched the earth and left only ash-kissed soil. <words>17</words>
Elias, an apocalyptic farmer with calloused hands and a mind sharper than his scythe, knelt in the dirt, tending to a patch of seeds no one believed could grow. <words>32</words>
His motive was simple: to escape a life dictated by the Council’s rations, their lies, their control over what remained of humanity. <words>27</words>
But tonight, he jabbered to himself, a typically atypical habit born from years of isolation, as he unwrapped a magician’s deck of trick cards left behind by a wanderer years ago. <words>35</words>
The cards were worn, their edges frayed, but when he fanned them out, they shimmered like captured starlight—a reminder of a world before boundaries. <words>28</words>
He’d heard whispers of the song of boundaries, an ancient melody that could dissolve the invisible walls keeping survivors trapped in their ruins. <words>27</words>
But how to find it? The answer came through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea, which sometimes washed onto the plains’ edge, their glass necks clogged with salt and secrets. <words>33</words>
Elias had collected them for years, each note a fragment of hope or despair, but one bottle held a map sketched in charcoal, its edges singed. <words>28</words>
The map led to a crater where the song was said to originate, a place where the earth itself hummed with forgotten magic. <words>23</words>
He packed his seeds, the deck of cards, and a waterskin, then set out across the plains, his boots crunching over crystalline shards left by the war. <words>28</words>
At night, he jabbered to the stars, reciting the messages he’d read, as if the words could ward off the loneliness. <words>23</words>
The plains shifted underfoot, sometimes solid, sometimes liquid, as if the land itself were debating whether to let him pass. <words>23</words>
On the third day, he found the crater—a gaping wound in the earth, its rim lined with glowing moss. <words>20</words>
Inside, the air thrummed, and the song of boundaries pulsed like a heartbeat, low and resonant. <words>19</words>
Elias played the magician’s cards, their tricks manifesting as illusions of fertile fields and laughing children, the images dissolving into the song’s rhythm. <words>26</words>
He scattered his new seeds into the crater, their husks splitting as they absorbed the song’s power, roots digging deep into the moss. <words>24</words>
By dawn, the plains had changed—soft and green, the boundaries between survival and hope erased. <words>20</words>
The Council’s rations no longer mattered; Elias had found raw solace in growing what was forbidden, in jabbering to the wind without fear. <words>24</words>
He returned to his farm, the deck of cards tucked in his belt, the messages in bottles now empty but no longer needed. <words>23</words>
The song of boundaries had not just dissolved walls—it had given him a life of his own making. <words>19</words>
And when he jabbered now, it was with laughter, his voice blending with the plains’ new chorus. <words>19</words>
