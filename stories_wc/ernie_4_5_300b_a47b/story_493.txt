Sir Cedric of Thalassa adjusted his chainmail as he crossed the threshold of the reimagined Minoan palace, its labyrinthine halls aglow with flickering oil lamps. <words>22</words> The evening commute had begun, though here, “commute” meant traversing corridors lined with frescoes of bull-leaping and sea gods, the air thick with the scent of aged stone and myrrh. <words>40</words> He was no ordinary knight—prudent to a fault, his every step calculated, his mind perpetually weighing risks. <words>53</words> Yet tonight, his usual solemnity was tempered by a mysteriously cheerful lilt, a paradox that made his squire, Lira, eye him warily. <words>69</words>

His quest was personal: to trace an unknown ancestry, a lineage buried beneath centuries of myth and erasure. <words>83</words> The key, he believed, lay in the palace’s archives, a chamber of secondhand letters and parchments salvaged from shipwrecks and forgotten tombs. <words>99</words> Tonight, he carried a loose binder ring, its metal cold and unadorned, a tool to clip together fragments of truth. <words>113</words>

In the archive’s dim light, Cedric pored over a stack of letters, their ink faded but legible. <words>125</words> The first was a merchant’s account of a storm off Crete; the second, a lover’s plea scrawled on the back of a tax ledger. <words>138</words> Patterns emerged—cryptic symbols, repeated phrases, a code hidden in plain sight. <words>151</words> Lira hovered, impatient. “How will this lead to your ancestors?” she asked. <words>163</words>

Cedric smiled, that same unsettling cheer. “Secrets guard themselves through chaos. To understand, one must find the order beneath.” <words>180</words> He pointed to a margin note: *“The bull’s eye sees all, but only the moon’s child reads the truth.”* <words>196</words> Across the room, a fresco depicted a priestess holding a crescent moon, her gaze fixed on a labyrinth. <words>209</words>

Hours passed. The palace settled into silence, save for the scrape of Cedric’s quill. <words>221</words> He clipped three letters together with the binder ring, their edges aligned to form a star map. <words>234</words> “Here,” he murmured. “The merchant’s storm, the lover’s plea, and a priestess’s hymn—all dated the same night. A convergence.” <words>252</words>

Lira leaned in. “But what does it mean?” <words>259</words>

“That my ancestors were not just survivors,” Cedric said, “but architects of silence. They buried their names to protect something greater.” <words>280</words> He traced the fresco’s labyrinth. “The Minoans guarded secrets in their art, their rituals. My family did the same in letters.” <words>298</words>

The revelation hung in the air, familiar yet unknown. <words>306</words> Cedric’s cheer made sense now—not ignorance, but the joy of finally *understanding*. <words>320</words> He stood, the binder ring clinking in his hand. “Come. The archives sleep, but the palace whispers.” <words>334</words>

As they exited, the moon cast silver through a high window, illuminating a path forward. <words>347</words> Cedric’s steps were lighter, his prudence undimmed but now paired with purpose. <words>360</words> The past was no longer a shadow—it was a map, and he had learned to read it. <words>374</words>
