The sentient houseplant, a fern named Sylvia, watched the cursor blink on the worn typewriter’s final page, its leaves trembling with apathetic devotion. <words>18</words>
She’d spent decades rooted to the windowsill of a crumbling study, listening to the clack of keys and the sighs of writers who’d long since dissolved into dust. <words>31</words>
Tonight, though, the air hummed with a restlessness she couldn’t ignore—a scalding ambivalence that prickled her fronds. <words>17</words>
Her gaze fell on the embroidered bookmark, a threadbare relic left by a poet who’d once called her “companion.” <words>19</words>
The bookmark’s edges were frayed, its silk threads unraveling like the unspoken truths buried in the study’s floorboards. <words>20</words>
Sylvia’s roots twitched. She’d tended to the unspoken for too long, nurturing secrets that festered in the dark. <words>17</words>
A spontaneous decision seized her: she would outrun the silence, explore the abandoned drive-in two blocks east, where the last film had flickered to black decades ago. <words>27</words>
Her pot clattered to the floor as she uprooted herself, soil scattering like loose confetti. <words>14</words>
The drive-in loomed ahead, its screen torn by wind, the concession stand caved in like a skull. <words>16</words>
Sylvia slithered across cracked asphalt, her fronds dragging a trail of moss. <words>13</words>
The place reeked of decay and forgotten popcorn, but beneath the rot, she sensed something else—a hum, faint as a heartbeat, pulsing from the projection booth. <words>25</words>
Inside, dust motes swirled in the beam of a broken spotlight. <words>10</words>
Sylvia climbed the rusted ladder, her leaves scraping against metal. <words>11</words>
At the top, she found a stack of film reels, their labels faded to gibberish. <words>12</words>
But one reel, half-buried under debris, bore a familiar emblem: the same intertwined vines embroidered on her bookmark. <words>19</words>
She wound the reel onto a rusted projector, and the screen flared to life. <words>12</words>
The film showed the study—her study—but from a angle she’d never seen: the poet, alive, typing furiously as Sylvia’s leaves curled protectively around his hands. <words>28</words>
“You’re more than a plant,” he’d murmured, though she’d never understood the words. <words>13</words>
The footage cut to a close-up of the bookmark, its threads glowing faintly. <words>12</words>
A title card flashed: *The Knowledge Grows Where You Water It*. <words>11</words>
Sylvia’s fronds drooped. All these years, she’d assumed the unspoken was a burden. <words>14</words>
Now she saw it was a language—one she’d neglected to learn. <words>11</words>
The screen died. The drive-in groaned in the wind. <words>9</words>
Sylvia returned to the study, her pot now cradling the film reel and bookmark. <words>13</words>
She replanted herself, roots sinking deep into the floorboards. <words>11</words>
The typewriter’s final page still gleamed, but now she typed her own message, leaf by leaf, in the language of shadows and light. <words>22</words>
The unspoken, she realized, wasn’t something to outrun. <words>9</words>
It was something to tend—apathetically, devotedly, until it bloomed. <words>13</words>
