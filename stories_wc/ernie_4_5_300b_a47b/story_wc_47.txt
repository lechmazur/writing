Lila adjusted her amber pendant, its glow warming the damp air of the abandoned data center turned moss garden. [19] She’d spent years transforming the skeletal remains of servers into a labyrinth of ferns and ivy, but tonight, the space felt heavier—a honeyed hush settled over the vines, thick as syrup. [42] After her confession about the accident that killed her brother went viral, strangers flooded her inbox with hollow condolences. [63] Now, she waited for the one person who might understand: Elias, the quietly proactive botanist who’d taught her to graft orchids onto tree bark. [87]

The garden’s heart was a chamber where rusted server racks cradled terrariums of bioluminescent moss. [102] Lila traced the pattern left by drip of thawing icicles on the concrete floor—a jagged map of stains that spiraled toward the center. [123] She’d noticed it weeks ago, how the drips etched a rhythm into the stone, and had begun arranging stones along the lines, turning chaos into art. [147] Tonight, she’d proffer the pattern to Elias as a metaphor: even fractured things could grow deliberate. [168]

Footsteps echoed outside. Elias appeared in the doorway, his coat dusted with snow, a single white orchid in hand. [186] “You kept the servers,” he said, nodding at the racks now draped in moss. [199] His voice was a low hum, matching the garden’s quiet. [207]

“They’re anchors,” Lila replied. “Without them, the place would float away.” [223] She gestured to the pendant. “My brother gave me this before… before the accident. It’s fossilized resin. Trapped time.” [247]

Elias stepped closer, the orchid’s petals brushing his palm. “You’ve been proactive about grief,” he said. “Not many are.” [266]

She flushed. “Or reactive? I don’t know.” [277] The confession’s aftermath had left her raw. Strangers dissected her pain online, but Elias had never asked for explanations. [298]

He knelt by the drip pattern, placing the orchid at its center. “This isn’t random,” he said. “The icicles melt in sequence—east to west, based on the sun’s angle. You’ve mapped the building’s heartbeat.” [331]

Lila sat beside him. “I wanted to graft new meaning onto old wounds. Like you do with plants.” [350]

Elias smiled faintly. “Grafting requires vulnerability. You expose the inner layers, hope they fuse.” [371] He touched the amber pendant. “This holds your brother’s essence. What if you let it merge with something new?” [392]

She hesitated, then unclasped the pendant. Inside, a sliver of obsidian—a shard from the accident site—gleamed against the resin. [413] “I’ve been afraid to lose him twice,” she admitted. [422]

“But you’re not losing him,” Elias said. “You’re expanding his story.” He plucked a moss sprig and pressed it into the pendant’s setting. “See? The resin’s still there. The obsidian, too. Now there’s life growing around them.” [458]

The honeyed hush deepened. Lila realized the garden’s silence wasn’t emptiness but a container—protected vulnerability. [477] She’d spent years hiding behind servers and moss, but Elias saw her clearly. [494]

“Stay,” she said suddenly. “Help me tend this place.” [505]

He studied her, then nodded. “Only if you let me bring more orchids.” [520]

She laughed, the sound startling in the stillness. “Deal.” [528]

As they worked, arranging stones along the drip pattern, Lila felt the weight of the pendant lighten. [547] The garden’s hum became a language, and she understood: healing wasn’t about erasing the past but letting it breathe. [572]

Later, Elias left to fetch more plants. Lila stayed, tracing the icicle stains. [587] She wondered if the pattern would shift by spring, if new drips would redraw the lines. [606] But for now, the stones held, and the moss glowed. [618]

When Elias returned, he carried a sapling in a pot. “For the center,” he said. [633] Together, they planted it, their hands brushing in the soil. [642]

“It’ll outgrow this place someday,” Lila said. [651]

“Then we’ll move it,” Elias replied. “Grafting isn’t permanent. It’s a conversation.” [668]

The amber pendant swung between them, catching the mosslight. [677] Lila thought of her brother, of the accident, of the viral confession. [690] All those wounds, now threaded with orchid roots and server hum. [703]

“Thank you,” she said softly. [709]

Elias squeezed her hand. “You did the hard part. I just brought the plants.” [728]

Outside, snow fell, but the garden held its heat. [737]
