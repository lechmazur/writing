In the benthic city of Veyra, where sunlight never pierced the abyssal gloom, Lirael taught navigation by the faint, cold glimmer of alien constellations. [34] She was a navigation instructor, her classroom a dome of reinforced glass that looked out on the city’s spired silhouettes, their edges softened by the black water. [54] Since the discovery of the aliens—gentle, bioluminescent beings who left trails of light in their wake—the old maps had become obsolete, and Lirael’s job was to help others learn to read the new, unfolded horizons. [92]

Her students were balancedly curious, neither too eager to rush into danger nor too fearful to explore. [111] They gathered around her each morning, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of the city’s energy crystals, and listened as she spoke of edge geometry—the way angles and lines could be used to chart a course through the dark. [150] “The stars are not just points of light,” she would say, tracing patterns in the air with her gloved fingers. “They are edges, boundaries, the geometry of the unknown.” [180]

One evening, after a particularly difficult lesson, Lirael found herself alone in the navigation chamber. [198] She reached into her pocket and pulled out a boat anchor chain link, rusted and heavy, a relic from the surface world. [222] It had been given to her by an old sailor who had once visited Veyra, long before the aliens were discovered. [244] “Hold this,” he had said, pressing it into her hand. “It’ll keep you grounded when the horizons shift.” [266]

She turned the chain link over in her hands, its rough edges biting into her palms. [282] The aliens had expanded her understanding of the world, but sometimes, in the quiet moments, she felt adrift. [304] She wanted to learn to navigate by starlight, not just for her students, but for herself. [324] She wanted to feel the pull of something greater, to find her place in the unfolded horizons. [344]

The next day, she took her class to the edge of the city, where the water grew colder and the pressure more intense. [364] They floated in a cluster, their suits glowing faintly, and looked up at the alien constellations. [380] “Today,” Lirael said, “we will expand our understanding of edge geometry.” [396] She held up the chain link, its metallic surface reflecting the faint light. [412] “This is not just a tool for holding a boat in place. It is a reminder that even the heaviest things can be part of something greater.” [446]

She began to explain how the angles of the chain link could be used to calculate distance and direction, how the edges of its links could be aligned with the stars. [476] Her students listened intently, their curiosity balanced by a healthy respect for the unknown. [496] As she spoke, Lirael felt a somber marvel wash over her—a sense of awe at the vastness of the universe and the smallness of her place within it. [528]

One student, a young woman named Tarel, raised her hand. [542] “Instructor Lirael,” she said, “how do you know the aliens’ light patterns will stay the same? What if they change?” [566]

Lirael smiled, her eyes reflecting the faint glow of the stars. [580] “That is the beauty of edge geometry,” she said. “It is not about rigid rules, but about adapting to the unfolded horizons. The aliens’ light may shift, but the principles remain the same.” [618]

Tarel nodded, her expression thoughtful. [628] The others murmured among themselves, their curiosity piqued. [640] Lirael continued, her voice steady and calm. [650] “We must learn to navigate not just by what we see, but by what we feel. The stars, the water, the pressure—all of it is part of the edge geometry.” [680]

As they floated there, surrounded by the cold, dark water, Lirael felt a sense of purpose settle over her. [700] She was not just teaching navigation; she was teaching her students to embrace the unknown, to find beauty in the unfolded horizons. [720] And in doing so, she was learning to navigate by starlight herself. [734]
