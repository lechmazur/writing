The orchestra’s tuning crescendoed like a storm beneath the underground orchard, its bio-luminescent fungus casting jagged shadows over rows of gnarled fruit trees. <words>26</words>
Lira Voss, ghostwriter for politicians too afraid to speak their truths, adjusted her spectacles and traced the rim of her worn leather sandals—a relic from a life she’d buried. <words>56</words>
Her clients’ secrets festered in her mind, but her own secret identity as a poetically rational anarchist festered deeper, a paradox she’d nurtured for years. <words>72</words>
Tonight, she’d corrode the barriers between truth and lies, not with speeches, but through coded stanzas hidden in shipwrecked journals she’d salvaged from the orchard’s hidden archives. <words>93</words>
The fungus pulsed, its light syncing with the orchestra’s dissonant hum, as if the earth itself were tuning to her rebellion. <words>110</words>
She knelt, sandals sinking into damp soil, and unfolded a journal, its pages brittle and salt-stained. <words>125</words>
The first stanza, etched in fading ink, read: *“The politician’s mask is a tomb / where words rot and truths are exhumed.”* <words>145</words>
Lira’s lips curled. Her clients paid her to craft lies that sounded like virtues, but these stanzas—*these* were the weapons she’d forged in secret. <words>163</words>
She’d plant them in speeches, let them fester in the public consciousness until the lies collapsed under their own weight. <words>180</words>
A violin screeched overhead, a note out of place, and the orchard’s fungi flared crimson. <words>193</words>
She pressed on, decoding the next stanza: *“Control is a tide that drowns the bold / but the moon’s pull is written in code.”* <words>213</words>
Her motivation crystallized—to gain control of her destiny, she’d first unravel theirs. <words>225</words>
The sandals, now caked with mud, anchored her to the earth as she scribbled notes in the margin, translating poetry into policy. <words>242</words>
A cello groaned, and the fungi dimmed, as if the orchard itself held its breath. <words>254</words>
Lira’s hands trembled. This was no mere ghostwriting; it was alchemy, turning decay into revolution. <words>270</words>
The final stanza glared up at her: *“The orchard grows where the shipwreck sleeps / its roots drink lies, its fruit weeps truth.”* <words>290</words>
She laughed, a sound sharp as broken glass. The chaotic organization of her plan—poetry as corrosion, truth as a slow-acting poison—felt right. <words>308</words>
The orchestra’s tuning peaked, a cacophony of anticipation, and the fungi blazed gold. <words>320</words>
Lira stood, sandals slipping in the mud, and clutched the journal to her chest. <words>330</words>
Tonight, she’d feed the politicians’ speeches with these stanzas, let the lies corrode from within. <words>344</words>
The orchard’s air hummed with possibility, and for the first time in years, she felt the pull of her own destiny—not as a ghost, but as the architect of its collapse. <words>366</words>
She stepped forward, sandals leaving prints like punctuation marks in the soil, and whispered, *“Let the fruit weep.”* <words>383</words>
The orchestra struck its first chord, and the fungi erupted in a symphony of light. <words>395</words>
