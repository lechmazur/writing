Lira clung to the rustic spinning wheel, its wooden spokes trembling beneath her fingers as she stood on the floating island’s cloud gazing platform. <words>18</words> The platform, a mosaic of glass and moss, hovered above a void where stars bled into mist, and the final step of the worn flight of stairs yawned behind her like a mouth. <words>39</words> She had followed the sun trails—golden threads of light that pierced the clouds each dawn—to this edge, believing they would unravel the lie that bound her here. <words>59</words>  

As a fervent caretaker of the island’s forgotten archives, Lira had always sensed the truth humming beneath the surface, a discordant note in the lullabies sung by the island’s oddly faithful guardians. <words>79</words> They claimed the spinning wheel was a relic of peace, a tool to weave dreams into the fabric of reality. <words>92</words> But Lira knew better. Its grooves were etched with symbols that mirrored the constellations of a world she’d glimpsed in fragments—a parallel dimension where her sister still breathed. <words>114</words>  

“You’ll mangle the threads,” hissed Elder Veyra, her voice a rustle of dead leaves. <words>123</words> The guardian stood at the top of the stairs, her silhouette fraying at the edges as if the void were already consuming her. <words>135</words> “The wheel is not for *unmasking*. It is for *preserving*.” <words>144</words>  

Lira’s grip tightened. Fragile ferocity pulsed in her veins. “Preserving lies,” she spat. <words>153</words> The sun trails flared, casting her shadow forward like a blade. <words>160</words> She had memorized their path: east to west, seven steps down, then a leap into the light. <words>170</words> The final step’s wood was splintered, worn smooth by centuries of caretakers who’d chosen obedience over truth. <words>182</words>  

“You’ll die,” Veyra warned, but Lira was already moving. <words>189</words> She spun the wheel, its crank groaning as the sun trails coiled around her arms like chains. <words>199</words> The platform shuddered, and the void below roared. <words>206</words> For a heartbeat, Lira saw it—the parallel dimension, a mirror of this island but broken, its guardians gnawed by shadows. <words>220</words> Her sister’s face flickered there, a ghost in the machine. <words>228</words>  

“Now!” Lira screamed. The wheel’s spindle pierced the sun trails, and light exploded. <words>237</words> Veyra’s scream merged with the sound of rending fabric. <words>244</words> Lira’s body mangle, her bones snapping as the dimensions collided. <words>252</words> But she clung to the wheel, its threads now fraying into raw possibility. <words>261</words>  

The final step crumbled beneath her. For a breathless moment, she hung between worlds, the wheel’s hum a dirge and a hymn. <words>276</words> Then gravity claimed her. She fell, not into the void, but into the arms of her sister, alive and real, on a platform that no longer floated but rooted itself in soil. <words>295</words>  

The spinning wheel lay shattered beside them, its purpose fulfilled. <words>303</words> Above, the island dissolved into starlight, its guardians’ faith unraveling like old yarn. <words>314</words> Lira smiled, blood on her teeth. The truth had cost her everything, and nothing. <words>325</words>  

“You’re late,” her sister said, wiping Lira’s brow. <words>332</words>  

“I had to follow the sun,” Lira replied. <words>340</words>  

Around them, the world reknit itself, flawed and free. <words>349</words>
