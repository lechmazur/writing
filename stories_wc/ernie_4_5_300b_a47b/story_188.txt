The former lawman knelt in the shadow of the ancient Japanese castle, his hands trembling as he brushed soil from a cracked stone tile. <words>15</words> Spring’s first breath had awakened the gardens, but Haru’s mind lingered on the past—a cycle of violence he’d sworn to break. <words>30</words> His fingers closed around a pair of vintage spectacles, their brass frames rusted, lenses spiderwebbed with cracks. <words>46</words> They’d belonged to his father, a man who’d died wearing them, his face frozen in a rictus of fear. <words>61</words>  

Haru stirred the soil, planting seeds with ritualistic care, though the act felt probably improbable—a lawman’s hands, calloused from gunmetal, now coaxing life from earth. <words>85</words> The castle’s stones, lichen-choked and cold, seemed to whisper of forgotten blood. <words>96</words> He’d come here to escape, to bury his demons in the quiet rhythm of tilling and planting. <words>112</words> But the spectacles, discovered beneath a floorboard in the abandoned east wing, unsettled him. <words>126</words>  

A letter slipped from the spectacles’ case, its paper yellowed, ink faded. <words>137</words> It was addressed to a woman named Yumi, a name Haru recognized—the last survivor of a clan he’d once hunted. <words>151</words> The address was wrong, misplaced by time or design, yet it found its way to him, as if fate itself had intervened. <words>168</words>  

“*Gather the broken pieces*,” the letter read, its words a corroded rapture. <words>180</words> “*The spectacles see what others miss. The castle holds secrets. Come.*” <words>194</words> Haru’s throat tightened. Yumi had vanished decades ago, rumored to have fled the violence he’d helped perpetuate. <words>209</words> Now, this letter—a ghost’s plea—demanded he confront the ghosts he’d buried. <words>222</words>  

He climbed the castle’s central tower, the spectacles perched on his nose. <words>233</words> Through the fractured lenses, the world warped: shadows lengthened into blades, and the garden’s new shoots resembled skeletal fingers. <words>248</words> A hidden door creaked open beneath his touch, revealing a chamber lined with shattered urns and dried ink. <words>263</words>  

Yumi stood there, alive, her face a map of scars and sorrow. <words>274</words> “You thought escaping meant forgetting,” she said, her voice like gravel. <words>285</words> “But the cycle doesn’t end until we gather the broken pieces.” <words>297</words> She pointed to a mural on the wall—a battle scene, its figures fractured, their faces Haru’s own. <words>310</words>  

He removed the spectacles, but the vision lingered. <words>319</words> The seeds he’d planted were not just for crops; they were for atonement. <words>331</words> Yumi handed him a shard of pottery, its edge sharp. <words>339</words> “Break the cycle,” she said. “Or become its next victim.” <words>352</words>  

Haru hesitated, then smashed the mural with the shard. <words>361</words> The castle shuddered, and the air thickened with the scent of wet earth and old blood. <words>375</words> When the dust settled, the chamber was empty save for a single seedling pushing through the rubble. <words>390</words>  

He left the castle at dawn, the spectacles tucked into his belt. <words>401</words> The letter, now crumpled, weighed nothing in his pocket. <words>412</words> In the garden, he knelt again, stirring the soil with renewed purpose. <words>424</words> The cycle of violence wasn’t broken—not yet—but he’d gathered its pieces. <words>437</words> And in the corroded rapture of dawn, that was enough. <words>447</words>
