The sunken orchard greenhouse, its glass panels fogged and cracked, stood ringed by shipwrecks like skeletal guardians, their rusted hulls half-buried in the soil. <words>22</words> Inside, the air hummed with damp rot and the faint, metallic tang of old iron, as if the wrecks themselves had seeped into the earth. <words>42</words> Remy, a remorseful conjurer with a penchant for yard sales, knelt by an antique microscope, its brass body etched with symbols only he recognized. <words>63</words> His fingers traced the swirl of fingerprints left by previous owners, each groove a map of forgotten hands. <words>82</words>  

He’d come here, throughout the season’s yard sales, to hunt for relics that might reignite the wild frontier of his mind—a place he’d silenced after a spell gone wrong. <words>105</words> The greenhouse, abandoned for decades, had been his latest find: a place where time pooled like stagnant water. <words>123</words> In his pocket, a single knitting needle jangled, its wooden surface smoothed by years of restless handling. <words>140</words> It wasn’t for stitching, though; it was a tool, a key to dampen the chaos in his skull. <words>159</words>  

“Shared wisdom,” he muttered, indifferent enthusiasm coloring his voice. <words>172</words> The phrase was a mantra, a reminder that knowledge wasn’t his alone to wield. <words>186</words> He pressed his palm to the microscope’s base, matching the swirl of fingerprints there to the ones on his own skin. <words>206</words> The glass eyepiece clouded, then cleared, revealing not slides but a vision: a younger self, reckless and hungry, casting a fire that consumed a village. <words>228</words>  

Remy flinched but didn’t look away. The knitting needle slipped into his grip, its tip glowing faintly, as if absorbing the heat of his shame. <words>247</words> He began to knit—not yarn, but the air itself, weaving threads of memory into a lattice that dampened the vision’s intensity. <words>266</words> The greenhouse shuddered, the shipwrecks outside groaning as if waking. <words>279</words>  

“You’re obviously mysterious,” he said to the microscope, as if it were a confidant. <words>294</words> The device didn’t answer, but its lens flickered, projecting another scene: a child, wide-eyed, watching him practice levitation in this very greenhouse, decades ago. <words>314</words> Remy’s throat tightened. He’d forgotten that witness, that shared moment of awe. <words>329</words>  

By dawn, the yard sale crowds would arrive, drawn by the greenhouse’s eerie allure. <words>344</words> Remy would leave, knitting needle in hand, his mind quieter, the wild frontier tamed but not extinguished. <words>363</words> The shipwrecks, he knew, would keep their secrets, as would he. <words>377</words> But the microscope, and the fingerprints, and the child’s ghost—they’d linger, a reminder that wisdom isn’t hoarded but passed, like a needle through fabric, stitching the past to the present. <words>399</words>  

He stood, brushing dust from his coat, and stepped outside. The shipwrecks loomed, their silhouettes jagged against the pale sky. <words>414</words> Somewhere, a bell jingled—a yard sale beginning. Remy smiled, indifferent yet eager, and walked on. <words>430</words>
