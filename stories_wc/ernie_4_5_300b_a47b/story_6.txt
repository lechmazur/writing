The skeptical minstrel, Jynx, leaned against a rusted pipe in the heart of the disappearing ink factory, humming a tune that made the shadows flinch. <words>19</words> At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, the factory’s silence was louder than any crowd—a silence that hummed with the ghost of secrets. <words>37</words> Jynx’s fingers drummed a rhythm on the dragon-scale armor scrap she’d stolen from a pawnshop, its iridescent surface catching the light like a dare. <words>57</words> “Impossibly plausible,” she muttered, the phrase her mantra since learning the scrap’s origin: a shard from the armor of the immortal trickster, Vex, who’d once ruled this factory with schemes as thick as the ink fumes. <words>84</words>

Vex had vanished decades ago, but his legacy lingered in the factory’s labyrinthine vents, which hissed like ancient dragons. <words>100</words> Jynx’s motivation was simple: out-scheme the trickster. If Vex could vanish, she’d make him reappear—and then outwit him. <words>118</words> The plan hinged on reckless generosity: she’d trade the scrap for a “favor” from Vex, knowing he’d never honor it, but also knowing he’d be too curious to resist. <words>142</words>

She climbed a rickety ladder to a catwalk overlooking a pit of half-dried ink, its surface cracked like a parched earth. <words>160</words> Below, a steam vent groaned, its hiss echoing through the factory like a challenge. <words>176</words> Jynx grinned. “Via the hiss of an ancient steam vent,” she said, “you’ll come.” She fitted the scrap into a slingshot, its leather pouch stretched taut. <words>198</words>

The first shot arced toward the vent, but the scrap bounced off the metal, clattering to the floor. <words>216</words> “Improvise,” Jynx muttered, kicking a rusted bucket. It rolled into the vent, triggering a hiss so loud it shook the pipes. <words>238</words> A figure materialized in the steam—Vex, his form flickering like a mirage, eyes gleaming with mischief. <words>256</words>

“You dare summon me with a *scrap*?” His voice was a rasp of gravel and honey. <words>272</words> Jynx bowed, irreverent awe in her tone. “Only the best for an immortal. I offer reckless generosity: take the scrap, owe me a favor.” <words>298</words> Vex laughed, the sound a cascade of shattered glass. “You think a favor binds me? I am Vex. I out-scheme schemers.” <words>320</words>

“Exactly,” Jynx said, slingshot aimed at a nearby valve. “But if you don’t honor it, I’ll flood this factory with ink. Your playground becomes your prison.” <words>344</words> Vex’s smirk faltered. The hiss of the vent grew louder, as if the factory itself held its breath. <words>362</words>

“Impossibly plausible,” Vex conceded, snatching the scrap. “Name your favor.” <words>378</words> Jynx grinned. “Teach me to vanish like you.” <words>390</words> Vex’s laugh boomed. “Granted. But vanish you will—*permanently*.” <words>406</words>

Before he could act, Jynx fired the slingshot again, this time aiming for the vent’s control panel. <words>424</words> The factory shuddered, ink erupting in a geyser that swallowed Vex’s form. <words>440</words> When the ink settled, he was gone—but so was the scrap. <words>454</words>

Jynx whistled, tuning her lute. “Reckless generosity,” she said, “beats immortal tricks.” The factory’s silence seemed to agree. <words>478</words>
