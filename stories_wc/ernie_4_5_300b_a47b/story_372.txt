The neon-lit slums of New Karakorum pulsed like a broken circuit, their holographic billboards flickering as I crouched in the shadow of a rusted air duct, my gloved fingers tracing the edge of an unused sticky label I’d found in a derelict data hub. <words>34</words> It read “PROPERTY OF THE ARCHIVE” in fading glyphs, but I’d already repurposed it—stuck it to my wrist as a talisman, a joke against the chaos. <words>53</words>  

I was a spy, once. Now I was just a ghost chasing whispers, my heart a hollowed-out reactor. <words>68</words> The city’s underbelly thrived on secrets, and I’d traded mine for a false sense of purpose. <words>83</words> Tonight, though, I wasn’t here to spy. I’d come to gloat. <words>93</words>  

Across the alley, a figure emerged from the steam rising off a grid of sewer vents—a woman in a patchwork trench coat, her face obscured by a respirator. <words>113</words> We’d never met, but we shared a language: urban exploration. <words>125</words> She carried a datapad glowing with maps of forgotten tunnels, and I carried a vial of synth-spice, the city’s latest culinary obsession. <words>143</words>  

“You’re late,” she said, her voice muffled but sharp. <words>150</words>  
“Timing’s overrated,” I replied, curiously indifferent to her scowl. <words>163</words> The avalanche was coming—not of snow, but of data, of memories, of the past clawing its way into the present. <words>178</words> We both knew it. That’s why we were here. <words>185</words>  

She nodded at the vial. “Taste it.” <words>191</words>  
I uncorked it, the aroma of burnt circuitry and artificial citrus filling the air. <words>204</words> At the instant the liquid touched my tongue, the city shuddered. <words>215</words> Unfamiliar reflections rippled across every surface—holograms of people I’d never been, places I’d never seen. <words>231</words> My own face flickered in a puddle, aged, smiling, *free*. <words>240</words>  

“Destiny’s a rambling thing,” I muttered, the label on my wrist peeling at the edges. <words>254</words> She didn’t laugh. <words>259</words>  

“The avalanche starts in 12 minutes,” she said, tapping her datapad. <words>271</words> “We need to reach the Archive before it buries everything.” <words>283</words>  
“Why?” I asked, though I already knew. <words>290</words>  
“To outrun it,” she said, as if it were obvious. <words>299</words>  

We moved through the slums, our path lit by the erratic glow of street lamps. <words>312</words> The city’s heartbeat synced with my own—erratic, desperate, alive. <words>324</words> At the Archive’s entrance, a door sealed with biometric locks, she handed me a tool. <words>336</words> “You’re better at this,” she said. <words>342</words>  

I glared at her. “Why trust me?” <words>349</words>  
She shrugged. “You’re here. That’s enough.” <words>359</words>  

The lock clicked. Inside, the avalanche roared—a wall of data, a tidal wave of truth. <words>372</words> I grinned, the label now a crumpled ball in my pocket. <words>382</words> “Let’s gloat,” I said, and we ran. <words>389</words>  

The Archive’s halls were a labyrinth of servers and forgotten dreams. <words>399</words> We didn’t look back. The avalanche wouldn’t care. <words>409</words> But for now, we were alive, and the city’s rambling destiny was ours to outrun. <words>423</words>
