Sir Alaric, a hopeful knight with a heart too large for his chainmail, pressed his palm against the ivy-choked wall of the hedge maze, whispering, “Show me the orchard.” The maze shuddered, its thorns retreating like timid creatures, revealing a path glowing with bioluminescent moss. <words>31</words>  

He stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and ozone. The mystic orchard garden bloomed before him—apple trees with silver bark, roses that hummed, and a single stray jigsaw edge embedded in the soil near a fountain. It pulsed faintly, as if waiting. <words>55</words>  

Alaric knelt, his cleverly naive mind racing. The jigsaw edge, he realized, was a fragment of the machine that cycled regrets—a colossal contraption hidden beneath the city, feeding on sorrow to fuel its gears. To sabotage it, he needed to sync its cryptic frequencies with the garden’s ancient harmonies. <words>73</words>  

The streetlamps outside began to flicker out, their hush descending like a curtain. Alaric placed his hand on the jigsaw edge. It vibrated, projecting a hologram of the machine: a labyrinth of copper coils and whirring blades, each cycle devouring a memory of loss. “Not tonight,” he murmured. <words>66</words>  

He closed his eyes, humming a tune his mother had sung—a lullaby of forgotten springs. The garden responded. The roses’ hum deepened, the fountain’s water stilled, and the jigsaw edge levitated, spinning like a compass needle. Alaric’s cleverness told him to match the machine’s frequency; his naivety believed he could outsing its despair. <words>71</words>  

Agonizing bliss twisted in his chest. The machine’s frequency clashed with his melody, sharp as shattered glass. Yet Alaric persisted, his voice cracking, until the jigsaw edge glowed gold. It shot into the sky, piercing the veil between worlds. The machine screeched, its cycles stuttering. <words>60</words>  

Regrets surged—a flood of grief, guilt, longing. Alaric’s naive hope wavered; he’d never anticipated the weight of what people clung to. But the garden’s magic surged through him, a tide of light. He sang louder, syncing the machine’s frequencies to the orchard’s rhythm, neutralizing its hunger. <words>62</words>  

The machine shuddered, its gears grinding to a halt. The jigsaw edge returned, now whole, fitting seamlessly into the fountain’s base. The garden exhaled, petals unfurling in relief. Alaric collapsed, sweating, his throat raw. Yet he smiled. The machine’s silence was a fragile thing, but for now, regrets stayed buried. <words>60</words>  

As dawn approached, the hedge maze sealed itself, erasing his path. Alaric stumbled home, the jigsaw’s victory warm in his pocket. He’d reclaim more lost things, he vowed—not with steel, but with song. The world was full of machines that devoured hope, but so too were there gardens that sang it back. <words>62</words>
