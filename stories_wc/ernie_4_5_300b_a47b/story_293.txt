The bacteria-powered city thrummed beneath a sickly green haze, its spires glowing with bioluminescent sludge that pulsed like a thousand restless hearts. <words>19</words> Alaric, a nervous minstrel with trembling fingers and a lute strung with cobweb-thin synth-fibers, clutched a crumpled photograph in his pocket—a faded image of a woman whose smile he’d memorized but whose name he’d forgotten. <words>43</words> He rarely sincere in his performances, had learned to mask his fear with jokes and off-key trills, but tonight, before a lonely candle flame gutters out in his rented algae-pod, he vowed to escape the ordinary. <words>70</words>  

The photograph, a relic from a life he’d abandoned, showed a starry sky above a field of glowing fungi. <words>17</words> He’d found it in a thrift shop’s “free” bin, its edges frayed, but the stars burned like promises. <words>15</words> If he could deploy that same pattern—follow the constellations etched into the city’s sludge-stained maps—maybe he’d find a path beyond the humdrum cycles of bacteria-fueled labor and hollow laughter. <words>34</words>  

Alaric slipped into the streets, his boots squelching on the viscous ground. <words>13</words> The air smelled of rot and ambition, a mix that made his throat tighten. <words>12</words> He paused beneath a flickering streetlamp, its light fed by methane-eating microbes, and unfolded the photo. <words>20</words> The stars matched the city’s grid, if you tilted your head just right. <words>11</words> A reckless grin tugged his lips—cautious revelry, the only kind he allowed himself. <words>14</words>  

He moved, tracing the constellations with shaky fingers, each step a rebellion against the certainty of decay. <words>19</words> The bacteria-powered engines roared overhead, their glow painting his shadow in sickly gold. <words>14</words> A guard drone buzzed past, its sensors glitching in the electromagnetic hum of the city. <words>16</words> Alaric froze, holding his breath until it passed, then sprinted toward the edge of the grid, where the stars grew brighter, untamed. <words>26</words>  

At the city’s border, he found a tunnel choked with bioluminescent vines. <words>13</words> The photograph’s edges glowed in his palm—a compass, a map, a prayer. <words>13</words> He pushed through, the vines recoiling as if repelled by his resolve. <words>11</words> On the other side lay a field of glowing fungi, just as the photo had promised, and above, a sky unpolluted by sludge-light. <words>22</words>  

Alaric fell to his knees, laughing breathlessly. <words>8</words> The candle flame in his pod might’ve guttered out hours ago, but here, in this moment, he felt purpose bloom—a fragile, radiant thing. <words>21</words> He strummed his lute, the notes wild and unpracticed, and for the first time in years, he meant every chord. <words>20</words> The bacteria-powered city faded behind him, its glow a distant memory. <words>13</words> He’d escaped the ordinary, not by running, but by finally seeing the truth: the stars had been there all along, waiting for him to look up. <words>28</words>
