The haunted amusement park’s prize booth stood skeletal under a crescent moon, its glass case littered with dusty trinkets and a single, ornate vintage pencil box. <words>22</words> Elias, a cynic cursed to speak only truth, leaned against the booth’s peeling paint, observing a sparrow hopping through the rubble. <words>42</words> Birdwatching was his ritual here—a pretense to avoid humanity, though tonight, the booth’s proprietor, a wraithlike woman named Marla, had insisted he “choose a prize” before leaving. <words>68</words>  

“The pencil box suits your… *austerity*,” Marla purred, her voice like rustling leaves. <words>81</words> Elias scoffed. “It’s a relic of lies. Pencils erase. Truth doesn’t.” But his fingers brushed the box’s brass latch, and a vision flared: a tapestry of fate, threads fraying and reweaving under lunar light. <words>108</words>  

Marla’s smile sharpened. “You see the weave? Good. You’ll need it.” She gestured to the moon, now waxing gibbous. “Tonight, your curse evolves. Speak three truths, and someone petrifies—body and mind—until the next phase.” <words>138</words>  

Elias’s throat tightened. Polite vindictiveness had always been his armor, but this… this was a blade. <words>153</words> A group of teenagers stumbled into the booth’s orbit, giggling about “ghost hunts.” The tallest, a boy named Jared, pointed at the pencil box. “That’s sick! Bet it’s haunted.” <words>176</words>  

Elias’s curse itched. “It’s not haunted,” he said flatly. “It’s a prison. Open it, and your fears manifest.” Jared laughed, but Marla’s eyes glinted. “He speaks true. Open it, and the moon will judge.” <words>205</words>  

Jared, goaded by peers, flipped the latch. Inside lay a shimmering thread, pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>220</words> “What’s this?” he sneered. “A hair from a dead witch?” Elias’s voice dropped, layered tranquility masking steel. “It’s the thread of your stagnation. You’ll never leave this park until you cut it.” <words>247</words>  

The moon climbed. Jared’s smirk faltered as the thread coiled around his wrist. “Cut it,” Elias urged. “Or become a monument to your own cowardice.” The boy panicked, snipping the thread with a borrowed pocketknife. <words>274</words>  

Light erupted. Jared froze, mid-scream, his body turning to stone. His friends fled. <words>290</words> Marla clapped. “Beautiful! A stagnant mind provoked into evolution.” Elias stared at the statue, nausea churning. “This is evolution? Turning people into statues?” <words>315</words>  

“No,” Marla corrected. “*You* are. Your curse forced him to confront his truth. Now, so must you.” She pointed to the pencil box. “The tapestry’s weaver awaits. Use the phases to refine your gift.” <words>342</words>  

Elias clutched the box, its threads now humming in his grip. The moon peaked full, and he whispered, “I choose to evolve.” Somewhere, a stone statue cracked. <words>365</words>
