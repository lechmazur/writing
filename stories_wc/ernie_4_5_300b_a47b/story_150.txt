The steampunk observatory dome hummed with the whir of brass gears and the hiss of pressure valves, its glass panels casting fractured sunlight across the rehearsal space. <words>20</words> Jedediah “Slick” Malone, an outlaw cowboy poet with a penchant for rhyming heists, leaned against a rusted telescope, his worn runic bone dice clutched in a gloved hand. <words>40</words> The dice, carved with symbols from a forgotten tongue, had been his companion since he’d stolen them from a traveling fortune-teller’s wagon—a theft he’d later immortalized in a ballad titled *The Bone-Whisperer’s Lament*. <words>73</words>  

Tonight was the final rehearsal for *The Celestial Revue*, a variety show blending poetry, pneumatic puppetry, and astrological spectacle. <words>95</words> Slick’s role was to recite a verse about constellations, but his mind kept drifting to the dice’s promise: *intertwined destinies*, etched into their surface like a dare. <words>121</words> He’d always believed fate was a lie told by the desperate, but the dice hummed in his pocket, virtually peculiar in their heat, as if alive. <words>147</words>  

To spark his unstoppable curiosity, he’d taken to reading the coffee shop walls adjacent to the observatory. <words>170</words> The walls, plastered with chalkboards that changed text hourly via a network of clockwork spiders, displayed cryptic messages: *“The third star west is a liar”* or *“Beware the man who speaks in riddles.”* <words>203</words> Slick scoffed at first—poetic nonsense—but then the messages began to *misalign* with his own thoughts. <words>225</words> A line about a “broken hourglass” appeared as he rolled the dice, landing on a rune meaning *time*. <words>243</words> A warning about “shadows that walk upright” coincided with his poetic metaphor for greed. <words>262</words>  

“You’re late,” hissed Lila Voss, the show’s director, a woman with a monocle and a voice like grinding cogs. <words>280</words> She gestured to the stage, where a pneumatic puppet of Orion the Hunter twitched anxiously. <words>296</words> Slick shrugged, tossing the dice. They clattered to a stop, showing runes for *truth* and *illusion*. <words>315</words> “Just calibratin’ my muse,” he drawled, though his gut churned. The walls had mentioned a “rehearsal that unravels” earlier. <words>338</words>  

As the show began, Slick’s verse about constellations morphed mid-performance. <words>354</words> Instead of *“Orion’s belt holds the key,”* he blurted, *“Orion’s belt is a noose.”* The audience gasped; Lila’s monocle fogged with rage. <words>376</words> The dice grew hotter, their runes glowing faintly. Slick fled to the coffee shop, where the walls now read: *“You are the misalignment.”* <words>398</words>  

He stared at the dice. Their intertwined destinies weren’t his alone—they were a map, and he’d been following it blind. <words>419</words> The observatory’s gears groaned overhead, as if the building itself were holding its breath. <words>436</words> Slick rolled the dice one last time. They showed *freedom* and *chains*. <words>450</words>  

“Curiosity’s a double-edged star,” he muttered, returning to the stage. <words>465</words> The show collapsed into chaos, puppets tangled in wires, poets screaming off-key. <words>482</words> But Slick smiled, the dice burning in his palm. He’d sparked something unstoppable, all right—a revolution of questions. <words>500</words>
