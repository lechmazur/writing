Marla, the reincarnated goldfish caretaker, had spent seven lifetimes scrubbing algae off tanks in the forgotten recipe library—a labyrinth of cobwebbed shelves where culinary secrets went to rot. <words>27</words> Her current form, a wiry woman with gills faintly visible beneath her collar, nursed a toy soldier with a missing arm, a relic from a childhood she barely remembered. <words>52</words> The soldier’s chipped paint mirrored her own guilt: she’d let her last goldfish die by forgetting to feed it, a sin that echoed through each rebirth. <words>70</words>  

Today, the library’s air hummed with static. A storm brewed outside, its thunder a growl against the glass. <words>88</words> Marla traced the soldier’s stump where its arm should be, muttering, “I should’ve fought harder.” Her voice carried the playful cynicism of someone who’d seen time loop back on itself. <words>114</words>  

The weather broke suddenly—a clap of lightning, then a hush. <words>128</words> Through the rain-streaked window, a figure stumbled into view: a chef in a soaked apron, clutching a dripping recipe book. <words>148</words> “Help!” he shouted, battering the door. <words>155</words> Marla hesitated, then shoved the door open, her tentatively fierce stance belying her trembling hands. <words>171</words>  

“Your library’s haunted,” the chef gasped, “but my restaurant’s failing. I need… something new.” His eyes landed on the soldier. <words>189</words> Marla thrust it into his palm. “Take it. It’s missing a piece, like your menu.” <words>205</words>  

He frowned. “This is your treasure?” <words>213</words>  

“Guilt’s a lousy chef,” she said. “But maybe… disruption’s the seasoning we need.” <words>231</words>  

The chef’s laugh was brittle. “Disrupt what? Tradition?” <words>243</words>  

“Stagnation,” Marla corrected. She gestured to the shelves. “These recipes? They’re ghost stories. No one tastes them anymore.” <words>262</words>  

Outside, the rain softened to a drizzle. The chef opened the book to a page marked by a goldfish-shaped bookmark. <words>280</words> “‘Moonlit Algae Stew’,” he read aloud. “Sounds… vile.” <words>292</words>  

“Exactly.” Marla grinned. “Let’s cook it.” <words>299</words>  

As they gathered ingredients—kelp, star anise, a pinch of regret—the soldier sat between them, its missing arm a silent challenge. <words>317</words> The chef’s knife chopped fiercely, as if to exorcise decades of boredom. <words>330</words> Marla stirred the pot, her gills flaring. “Guilt’s haunting echo,” she mused, “but so is hope.” <words>347</words>  

The stew bubbled, its aroma sharp and unfamiliar. The chef took a bite, then another. “It’s… alive,” he whispered. <words>365</words>  

Marla nodded. “So are we.”  

Before the doctor’s chart could confirm her next turning point, she’d already rewritten the recipe. <words>387</words> The soldier, now propped on the chef’s counter, bore a new accessory: a tiny spoon for its stump. <words>403</words>  

Guilt, Marla realized, wasn’t a cage—just a dish best served with a sudden change of weather. <words>421</words>
