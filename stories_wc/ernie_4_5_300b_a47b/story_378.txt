Mayor Hector Grumblefoot, the lovably grumpy accidental mayor of Mudhaven, scowled as he trudged through the polluted swamp orchard, his boots sinking into the muck. <words>23</words> The carnival had just packed up under the first rays of dawn, leaving behind confetti and the stench of fried dough that clung to the humid air like a bad omen. <words>45</words> Hector had never asked to be mayor—he’d tripped into the role after the previous leader fled, leaving behind a town drowning in its own waste and a clockwork beetle that supposedly held “water wisdom.” <words>71</words>  

The beetle, a tarnished brass relic with gears whirring like a disgruntled heartbeat, had been found in the orchard’s oldest tree, a place the reclusive monks tended with obsessive secrecy. <words>97</words> Hector had dismissed it as junk until last night, when he’d overheard two monks in a crowded cafe whisper about “metamorphosis” and “the tide turning.” <words>121</words> Their voices had been low, but Hector’s ears perked—grudgingly, as always—at the mention of fate, a word he’d come to despise since inheriting this mess. <words>145</words>  

Now, as he waded through the orchard’s murky waters, the beetle buzzed in his pocket, its gears clicking a rhythm that made his teeth ache. <words>168</words> The monks emerged from the fog, their robes dripping with algae, eyes wild as they chanted in a language that sounded like drowning. <words>190</words> “The waters rise,” one hissed, “but wisdom drowns unless you *change*.” Hector scoffed. “Change what? This sludge?” He gestured at the orchard, where sickly fruit hung like tumors. <words>219</words>  

The beetle suddenly sprang from his pocket, landing on a moss-covered branch. <words>232</words> Its gears spun faster, emitting a hum that vibrated through Hector’s bones. <words>247</words> The monks fell silent. The swamp’s stench faded, replaced by the faint scent of rain. <words>263</words> Hector’s grumble softened—*reluctant awe* creeping in as the beetle’s brass wings unfolded, revealing tiny engravings: *“Water remembers. Teach it to forget.”* <words>290</words>  

Memories surfaced—the cafe conversation, the monks’ talk of metamorphosis. <words>305</words> Hector realized the beetle wasn’t a tool but a *mirror*, reflecting the town’s rot… and his own. <words>323</words> “You want me to… what? Dive in?” he muttered. The monks nodded. <words>338</words> With a sigh, he plunged his hands into the swamp. The water stung, but as he stirred it, the murk cleared, revealing sunken gears and rusted pipes—the source of the pollution. <words>364</words>  

The beetle zipped into the air, its hum now a song. <words>374</words> Hector, grumbling but moving, rallied the townsfolk to dismantle the pipes. <words>389</words> By noon, the orchard’s waters sparkled, and the monks presented him with a crown of lily pads. <words>407</words> “You’ve metamorphosed,” they said. Hector scowled. “Don’t get used to it.” But as he walked home, he let the beetle perch on his shoulder, its gears ticking a tune that almost sounded like hope. <words>442</words>  

Fate, he thought, wasn’t a river to drown in—but a swamp to drain, one grumble at a time. <words>460</words>
