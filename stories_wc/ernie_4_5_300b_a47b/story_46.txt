The blank-faced performer sat cross-legged in the orchard of giant ferns, their expressionless visage reflecting the fractured light filtering through waterfalls that overshadowed the grove. <words>23</words>  
Each fern frond towered like a cathedral spire, their green canopies humming with the static of unspoken secrets. <words>41</words>  
The performer’s fingers danced over a plain plastic ring, its surface etched with faint, glowing lines that shifted like constellations. <words>60</words>  
This ring, uniquely typical in its unadorned simplicity, was the key to their role as guardian of rumors—a title they’d inherited from a mentor who vanished into the moon’s reflection. <words>92</words>  
During piano practice, the performer’s true work began: deciphering the language of dreams, which manifested as whispers in the fern roots and echoes in the waterfall’s spray. <words>126</words>  
To approve a rumor’s validity, they tracked moon paths across the sky, mapping their arc against the ring’s etchings. <words>153</words>  
Tonight, the moon hung low, its light slicing through the ferns to illuminate a cluster of mushrooms pulsing with bioluminescent blue. <words>182</words>  
The performer tilted the ring toward the light, and the etchings flared, projecting a hologram of a woman’s face mid-scream. <words>208</words>  
“She claims the waterfalls are melting,” the performer muttered, their voice flat yet tinged with the precise madness of someone who converses with shadows. <words>235</words>  
The rumor was old, its edges frayed by repetition, but the ring’s glow intensified—a sign to investigate. <words>259</words>  
They stood, the plastic ring cold in their palm, and followed the moon’s path to the base of the tallest waterfall. <words>283</words>  
There, the cascading water shimmered with an oily sheen, and the ferns below drooped, their fronds curled like burnt paper. <words>308</words>  
The performer knelt, pressing the ring to the soil. It vibrated, humming a tune that mirrored the piano practice echoing in their memory. <words>334</words>  
“Approved,” they declared, the word sharp as a knife. The ring’s lines snapped into a new pattern, sealing the rumor into reality. <words>359</words>  
The waterfalls began to steam, their roar softening to a lullaby. The ferns unfurled, drinking in the dream-language seeping from the ground. <words>384</words>  
The performer returned to their seat, the ring now dull but heavy with purpose. They resumed their piano practice, each note a thread stitching the world’s fragile fabric. <words>412</words>  
By dawn, the orchard would forget the rumor’s approval, but the performer would not. Their role was to guard the line between truth and myth, using the uniquely typical ring to navigate the chaos. <words>441</words>  
The blank face remained impassive, a mask for the frenzy of their mind, where logic and lunacy danced in equal measure. <words>467</words>  
And in the silence between piano keys, the ferns whispered their gratitude, their leaves trembling with the weight of stories yet to unfold. <words>499</words>
