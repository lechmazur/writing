The ancient Chinese palace hummed with whispers of longing, each syllable a fragile moth brushing against silk screens. <words>15</words>  
In the courtyard, a calm assassin named Li Wei knelt beside a botanical press, its iron plates clamping a single crimson peony. <words>29</words>  
“They say prophecies are spun from silence,” he murmured, adjusting the flower’s petals with surgical precision. <words>22</words>  
His task was to amalgamate the emperor’s fears into a tangible thing—a task made easier by the pattern of a butterfly’s wings, which he’d traced in ink on the press’s underside. <words>35</words>  
The wings, of course, were figuratively literal: their veins mapped the fates of courtiers, their colors the hues of betrayal. <words>24</words>  
Li Wei had never believed in omens, but the emperor did, and that was enough. <words>16</words>  
Before the first question was asked—*“Will the northern tribes invade?”*—Li Wei would press the peony into parchment, its essence seeping into the fibers like a confession. <words>30</words>  
The courtiers called him the *Silent Weaver*, though his methods were less poetic. <words>14</words>  
He’d stolen the botanical press from a apothecary who’d claimed it could “preserve the soul of a season.” <words>20</words>  
Now, it preserved lies. <words>5</words>  
A servant scurried past, clutching a scroll. Li Wei smirked. The man’s shadow flickered like a crippled crane—a bad omen, if one believed in such things. <words>25</words>  
“The emperor grows impatient,” the servant hissed, though Li Wei hadn’t asked. <words>14</words>  
“Patience is a knife,” Li Wei replied, “and all knives must be sharpened.” <words>14</words>  
He pressed harder. The peony’s scent sharpened, sweet and metallic, like blood diluted by rain. <words>19</words>  
The butterfly’s wings, now imprinted on the parchment, seemed to flutter. <words>11</words>  
Li Wei had always found humor in the absurdity of his work—a killer who dealt in half-truths, a prophet who carried a dagger. <words>22</words>  
Yet here he was, amalgamating whispers into a prophecy that would unravel like silk in a storm. <words>19</words>  
The emperor would read the parchment and see a vision: peonies blooming in winter, a sign of victory. <words>20</words>  
In reality, the flowers would wither by dawn, their petals curling into fists. <words>16</words>  
But raw possibility was a malleable thing. <words>8</words>  
Li Wei stood, brushing petal dust from his sleeves. The courtyard’s whispers swelled, hungry and restless. <words>18</words>  
Somewhere, a door creaked. Footsteps echoed. <words>8</words>  
The first question hovered, unspoken, in the air. <words>9</words>  
Li Wei tucked the parchment into his robe. The botanical press, now empty, gleamed dully in the moonlight. <words>19</words>  
He’d spin the prophecy tonight, weaving longing into a tapestry of doubt. <words>15</words>  
After all, what was an empire but a collection of fears, pressed flat and labeled *destiny*? <words>18</words>  
The assassin’s smile was a thin, cold thing. <words>8</words>  
By dawn, the emperor would believe in peonies. <words>9</words>  
And Li Wei would believe in nothing at all. <words>10</words>
