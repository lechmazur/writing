Sir Cedric knelt in the dust between two crumbling arches of the ruined aqueduct, his armor clinking like distant bells in the arid silence. <words>16</words> The desert stretched endless, its heat a physical weight, yet he clutched an astronomical map rolled tight in his gauntleted hand—a relic from a forgotten scholar, its edges frayed but constellations still sharp. <words>36</words> His quest, he’d been told, was to “spark flames in a land of ice,” a riddle that had gnawed at him since leaving the mountain passes behind. <words>53</words>  

The greenhouse stood ahead, its glass panes warped and cracked, a skeletal husk clinging to the aqueduct’s skeleton. <words>67</words> Cedric had found it by chance, or perhaps by some unknowingly familiar pull, as if the place had waited for him. <words>80</words> Inside, the air tasted of rust and old soil. He traced his fingers over the roof’s tears, where sunlight speared through in jagged beams. <words>97</words>  

He unrolled the map, its parchment brittle. The scholar’s notes spoke of celestial patterns mirrored in earthly fractures—a theory Cedric had dismissed as madness. <words>116</words> Yet here, as he aligned the map’s cracks with the greenhouse’s gaps, the sun’s angle split the dust into golden threads. <words>130</words> A pattern emerged: the tears formed a constellation, one not of stars but of light. <words>139</words>  

Memory flickered. As a child, he’d watched his mother mend a broken vase, her hands tracing the cracks to guide the gold. “Beauty lives in the repair,” she’d said. <words>157</words> The map’s logic suddenly clicked. The greenhouse’s tears, the aqueduct’s ruin, the desert’s barrenness—all were fragments of a larger canvas, waiting to be remade. <words>173</words>  

He triggered the mechanism by adjusting the map’s angle, catching the light like a lens. The beams converged on a rusted pedal at the greenhouse’s base. <words>189</words> With a creak, gears whirred to life, pumping water from deep below the aqueduct. <words>197</words> A trickle became a stream, pooling in the parched soil. <words>204</words>  

Outside, the desert shimmered. Where the water touched, ice began to melt—not into slush, but into steam that rose in wispy clouds. <words>218</words> The land of ice, he realized, wasn’t a place but a state: dormant hope waiting for a spark. <words>230</words>  

Cedric’s chest tightened with crisp nostalgia. His mother’s vase, the scholar’s map, the greenhouse’s hidden gears—all pieces of a puzzle he’d carried unknowingly. <words>247</words> The canvas of life, he thought, wasn’t blank but fractured, and修复 (repair) required seeing the cracks as guides, not blemishes. <words>262</words>  

By dusk, the aqueduct’s flow had revived a patch of green. Cedric rolled the map, its purpose fulfilled yet its journey unfinished. <words>277</words> Somewhere beyond the mountains, other ruins waited, other tears to map. <words>286</words> He smiled, the weight of his quest lighter now. To spark flames, one need only redirect the light. <words>298</words>  

The desert breeze carried a whisper of his mother’s voice: *“Even broken things hold the sky.”* <words>309</words> Cedric mounted his horse, the astronomical map secure at his side, and rode onward. <words>320</words> The arid expanse ahead no longer felt endless. It was a canvas, and he had a brush. <words>332</words>
