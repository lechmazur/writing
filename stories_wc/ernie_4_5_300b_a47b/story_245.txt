The abandoned spaceport’s flight deck hummed with the ghostly whir of dead engines as Kael Voss, an irate smuggler with a scarred jaw and a chip on his shoulder, jogged through the rust-streaked corridors. <words>25</words> His boots clanged against the metal grating, each step a rebellion against the silence that had swallowed this place since the war. <words>42</words> He’d come here not for nostalgia, but for a map—a rumor of hidden waterfalls on a derelict planet, water so pure it could cleanse even his blackened soul. <words>67</words>  

But today, his focus splintered. In his pocket, a single chopstick—a relic from a dead lover’s last meal—pressed into his thigh, its wood splintering his skin like a dare. <words>87</words> *Memorialize*, she’d whispered before the blast, her voice fraying at the edges. Now, he jogged faster, as if speed could outrun the ache. <words>105</words>  

The flight deck’s observation lounge was littered with shattered glass and the skeletal remains of tea-dispensing droids. <words>122</words> Kael slammed his palm against a rusted console, and a cloud of dust erupted. <words>133</words> From the debris, he salvaged a chipped teacup, its surface etched with patterns only a desperate man would see as prophecy. <words>148</words>  

He filled it with lukewarm recycled water, swirled it violently, and watched the leaves cling to the sides like drowning creatures. <words>162</words> The patterns emerged—a jagged line, a spiral, a fracture. *Abstractly physical*, he thought, grinning without humor. <words>177</words> His heart’s revolt wasn’t metaphorical; it was a muscle straining against the cage of his ribs, demanding to be seen. <words>192</words>  

The leaves settled. A waterfall, he decided. Not in the leaves, but in the way the light fractured through the cup’s cracks. <words>207</words> He’d memorialize her by finding it, by proving that even in decay, beauty could be coaxed from chaos. <words>222</words>  

Jogging resumed, fiercer now. The deck’s curvature bent the horizon, and Kael imagined the waterfall’s roar drowning his thoughts. <words>239</words> He slipped twice on oil slicks, once landing hard enough to jar the chopstick deeper into his flesh. <words>254</words> *Pain is a pattern*, he told himself, *a language the heart writes in blood*. <words>268</words>  

By dusk, he reached the hangar bay’s edge. Below, a valley shimmered—not with water, but with bioluminescent fungi. <words>283</words> The waterfall was a lie, or a metaphor, or both. He laughed, a sound like grating metal, and hurled the teacup into the void. <words>302</words>  

But in his hand, the chopstick remained. He pressed it into the soil of a potted fern (the only greenery left), its wood absorbing the planet’s thin, bitter air. <words>319</words> *Memorialize*, he thought again. Not through tea leaves or waterfalls, but through the act of planting—of rooting oneself in the rubble. <words>334</words>  

The jogging had slowed to a walk. His heart still revolted, but now it beat in time with the fern’s slow unfurling, a rhythm both fragile and unyielding. <words>353</words>  

Kael Voss, irate smuggler, turned toward the horizon. The chopstick stood straight, a single defiant line in the dust. <words>368</words>
