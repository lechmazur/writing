The forgotten noble, Lord Elric Veyra, stood in the spontaneous combustion lab, his gloved hands trembling as he stared at the artificial hummingbird drone perched on a workbench. <words>20</words> Between text messages from his sister—*“Still at the gallery. Where are you?”*—he had slipped into this derelict wing of the estate, where his father’s failed experiments once roared. <words>40</words> The air smelled of burnt ozone and regret, a fitting atmosphere for a man whose lineage had been reduced to ash. <words>54</words>

He needed candor, not the hollow courtesies that had suffocated his family for generations. <words>66</words> The drone, its iridescent wings glinting mysteriously obvious in the flickering lab light, was his only ally. <words>79</words> Its purpose? To fortify his resolve, to cut through the illusions of nobility that had blinded him. <words>93</words> But how? The answer lay in the reassembly of old ticket stubs—crumpled relics of operas, duels, and funerals—scattered across the bench. <words>112</words>

Elric’s fingers moved with hollow recklessness, piecing together fragments of his past. <words>124</words> A stub from his mother’s final performance, another from the night his father’s lab exploded. <words>137</words> Each piece fit like a puzzle, revealing a truth he’d buried: his family’s “nobility” was a lie, a charade maintained by fear and silence. <words>154</words>

The drone buzzed, its wings whirring to life. <words>160</words> It hovered above the stubs, projecting holograms of Elric’s ancestors—their smiles fake, their eyes dead. <words>175</words> “You see?” the drone seemed to say. “You’re not like them. You can choose.” <words>187</words>

A text alert flashed: *“Father’s lawyer is here. Answer me.”* Elric ignored it. <words>199</words> He reached for the final stub, a ticket to his own engagement ball, never used. <words>212</words> The drone’s light intensified, illuminating the lab’s flaws—cracked glassware, scorched walls, the truth. <words>226</words>

With a deep breath, Elric activated the lab’s combustion array. <words>237</words> The stubs flared, their ashes swirling into the drone’s intake. <words>247</words> It transformed, wings sharpening into blades, body elongating into a key. <words>257</words> “Fortify,” Elric whispered, slotting the key into a hidden panel. <words>267</words>

The lab shuddered. Machines roared to life, not in destruction, but in revelation. <words>279</words> Blueprints for the drone’s design appeared on a dusty monitor—a gift from his mother, meant to expose the family’s corruption. <words>296</words> Elric laughed, a sound hollow and free. <words>304</words>

Another text: *“I’m coming in.”* He didn’t care. <words>312</words> The drone zipped to his shoulder, its weight a promise. <words>322</words> Candor, at last. No more illusions. <words>330</words>

As his sister’s footsteps echoed in the hall, Elric smashed the lab’s control panel. <words>341</words> Fire licked the walls, but he stood unflinching. <words>349</words> The nobleman was gone. In his place, a man unafraid to burn. <words>361</words>
