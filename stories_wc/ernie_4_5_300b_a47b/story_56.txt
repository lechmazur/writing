The reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper hummed with the gentle harshness of a world reborn from rubble, its steel bones now draped in apple blossoms and ivy. <words>22</words> At the instant a frozen computer finally restarted—its screen flickering to life like a timid firefly—Lira, a bluffing swindler with a penchant for magnetizing trust she hadn’t earned, adjusted her frayed cufflinks and muttered, “Time to plant another lie.” <words>50</words> Her target was the orchard’s new caretaker, a man rumored to hoard secrets in his pockets, but her real motive was to bare a truth no one dares to handle: that the skyscraper’s “reclamation” was a sham, a facade to sell scrap metal to the highest bidder. <words>87</words>  

She’d slapped a blank price tag on a rusted gear, labeling it “Antique Orchard Relic,” and planned to auction it off as proof of the land’s “historical value.” <words>31</words> But as she leaned against a crumbling concrete wall, energetically lethargic from weeks of scheming, a dropped book thudded at her feet—a leather-bound journal filled with sketches of invisible allies, figures drawn in charcoal so faint they seemed to dissolve into the page. <words>52</words>  

“You shouldn’t touch that,” said a voice, gruff yet tinged with curiosity. The caretaker, Elias, stood in the orchard’s dappled light, his hands calloused from tending soil and secrets. <words>31</words> Lira, ever the bluffer, smirked. “Why? Afraid I’ll steal your… *allies*?” She waved the book, its pages fluttering like moth wings. <words>28</words>  

Elias’s gaze hardened. “Those aren’t mine. They’re the skyscraper’s. When the building fell, it… *magnetized* something. People started seeing things. Hearing voices. The orchard’s just a cover. The real work’s underground.” <words>46</words>  

Lira’s pulse quickened. This was better than any lie. “Show me,” she said, the blank price tag still clutched in her hand. <words>17</words>  

He led her through a fissure in the skyscraper’s spine, down to a chamber where roots coiled around servers, their hum a low, persistent song. “The computer froze because it couldn’t process the truth,” Elias said. “But now… it’s restarting. And so are we.” <words>44</words>  

Lira stared at the blank price tag, suddenly heavy with meaning. She’d come here to swindle, to bare a truth for profit. But Elias’s invisible allies—the ghosts of the skyscraper’s past, the whispers of its future—were already rewriting her script. <words>44</words>  

“The orchard’s a lie,” she admitted, the words bitter on her tongue. “But so am I. Maybe we can… *magnetize* something real together.” <words>26</words>  

Elias smiled, a rare, sunlit thing. “Let’s start with this.” He plucked the blank price tag from her hand and pressed it into the soil. A seedling sprouted instantly, its leaves shimmering like liquid silver. <words>35</words>  

Above them, the computer’s screen displayed a single word: *GROW*. <words>13</words>
