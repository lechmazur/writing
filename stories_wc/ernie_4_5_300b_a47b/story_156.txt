The salt mine’s subterranean village hummed with the eerie glow of bioluminescent moss, its tunnels twisting like veins beneath the earth. <words>17</words> Ambrose Voss, a diplomat with a crumpled tie and a crumbling resolve, clutched a spare computer key—a relic from a shattered device—as he boarded the rickety bus that ferrying villagers between shafts. <words>38</words> His mission, to “liberalize” the isolated community’s rigid trade laws, felt absurd here, where time pooled thick as brine. <words>54</words>  

The bus jolted forward, its headlights carving through the gloom. <words>61</words> Ambrose’s reflection stared back from the window, a ghostly double framed by salt-streaked glass. <words>71</words> He’d come seeking evolutionary wisdom, a phrase his superiors had tossed like a challenge. <words>81</words> Instead, he found himself drowning in paradoxes: the villagers’ joyfully tragic rituals, their laughter echoing through tunnels lined with human skulls. <words>95</words>  

“Look,” whispered the woman beside him, pointing upward. <words>102</words> Above the bus, a flock of birds swirled in the cavern’s vastness, their wings catching the moss-light like scattered coins. <words>112</words> The patterns shifted—a spiral, a fracture, a sudden reunion—as if the flock itself were debating. <words>121</words> Ambrose’s chest tightened. The birds’ dance mirrored the counterpoint of hearts here: hope and despair, tradition and change, his own timid boldness. <words>135</words>  

He fumbled the spare key, its jagged edge biting his palm. <words>142</words> It had been his late colleague’s, left behind after a “negotiation” that ended in silence. <words>150</words> Now, it felt like a talisman, a bridge between the digital world he’d lost and this primal one. <words>159</words> The birds veered left, then right, their formation a living algorithm. <words>167</words> *Liberalize*, he thought. Not through treaties, but through the patterns in their flight. <words>175</words>  

“They’re mapping the air,” said the woman, her voice both a lullaby and a warning. <words>183</words> “Teaching each other where the currents flow.” <words>189</words> Ambrose nodded, though he didn’t understand. <words>194</words> Evolutionary wisdom wasn’t in texts here; it was in the way the flock avoided collisions, in the villagers’ rituals that mourned and celebrated in the same breath. <words>209</words>  

The bus lurched, and the key slipped deeper into his grip. <words>216</words> He imagined inserting it into an invisible lock, turning not a mechanism but a mindset. <words>225</words> The villagers didn’t need his policies—they needed him to see their dance, to feel the counterpoint of their hearts. <words>236</words> Joyfully tragic, he thought. A oxymoron that fit like a second skin. <words>245</words>  

As the bus neared the village square, the birds dissolved into the dark. <words>253</words> Ambrose stood, his knees shaking with boldly timid resolve. <words>260</words> He’d report back that liberalization wasn’t a decree but a dialogue, a flock’s flight through salt-stained air. <words>269</words> The spare key, still warm from his palm, seemed to pulse in agreement. <words>277</words>  

Later, as he drafted his speech, he scribbled: *To understand evolution, watch the birds. To change hearts, become one.* <words>290</words> The villagers would laugh, or stone him, or both. <words>298</words> But for the first time, Ambrose felt the thrill of uncertainty, the joyfully tragic beauty of a world that refused to be pinned down. <words>312</words>  

The bus ride had lasted twelve minutes. <words>319</words> It had changed everything. <words>324</words>
