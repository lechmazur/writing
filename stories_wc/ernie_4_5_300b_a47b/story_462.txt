The town-weary traveler paused at the edge of the abandoned carnival, where the house of mirrors stood like a decaying crown. <words>18</words>
Its glass panels, once bright, now sagged under the weight of salt-stained air, each shard a fragment of laughter turned to silence. <words>31</words>
He’d come seeking the cradle of sparks—a legend whispered in coastal taverns, a place where intention and accident coiled like vines. <words>41</words>
Inside, the air hummed with the ghosts of distorted echoes, and he traced a finger along a wall, finding a stained glass panel half-buried in grime. <words>53</words>
It depicted a storm at sea, waves frozen mid-crash, their edges blurred as if painted by a hand that feared clarity. <words>29</words>
He knelt, noticing how the glass’s cracks formed a map—a labyrinth leading to a tiny, perfect circle at its center. <words>31</words>
*Intentionally accidental*, he thought, recalling the old fisherman’s riddle: *To fertilize the void, one must first break what’s whole*. <words>32</words>
Outside, the metal sign above the carnival’s gate swung in the coastal wind, its clang a dull, rhythmic heartbeat. <words>27</words>
He positioned the panel so the sign’s tapping struck its cracks, each *thud* sending vibrations through the glass. <words>25</words>
The hush before someone finally says, “I love you”—that’s what the silence felt like, thick and charged. <words>24</words>
He waited, breath held, until the glass began to shudder, not break, but *unfold*, its cracks widening into veins of light. <words>30</words>
A spark leapt from the center, hot and blue, and landed on the dust-choked floor, where it grew into a flickering seedling. <words>30</words>
The traveler smiled, his mind’s cage creaking open. This was it—the fertilization of emptiness, via motion’s accidental grace. <words>30</words>
He pressed his palm to the glass, feeling its warmth seep into his bones, a counterpoint to the hammered repose of his soul. <words>31</words>
The seedling sprouted tendrils, weaving through the mirrors, their surfaces now reflecting not distortions, but possibilities. <words>27</words>
He realized the house wasn’t abandoned at all—just waiting for the right kind of accident to wake it. <words>23</words>
The sign kept tapping, its rhythm a lullaby, and he let himself drift, not toward sleep, but toward the crackling edge of *enough*. <words>30</words>
When the first “I love you” finally came—not from another’s lips, but his own, whispered to the glass—the sparks erupted into a storm. <words>32</words>
The carnival shuddered, then bloomed, its mirrors shedding years of neglect like old skin. <words>20</words>
The traveler stood, the stained glass panel now a shield against the quiet that had once suffocated him. <words>26</words>
He walked out, not weary anymore, but lit from within, the cradle of sparks cradled in his chest. <words>25</words>
The coastal wind carried the sign’s song behind him, a tune of tapping metal and salt-kissed redemption. <words>25</words>
