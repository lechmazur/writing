The hive-mind therapist, a collective of fifty voices humming in unison, adjusted its scuffed phone charger plug into the wall socket, its plastic casing cracked like a map of forgotten failures. <words>23</words>
Through the night air of the secret agent training facility, the sound of hindsight buzzed—a low, metallic whine that seemed to seep from the vents, as if the building itself regretted its purpose. <words>49</words>
Agent V-7, the latest recruit, sat cross-legged on a cot, her uniform still smelling of factory-new polyester, while the therapist’s voices dripped into her mind like honey laced with ground glass. <words>53</words>
“Tonight,” the hive-mind intoned, “you will drain your fears through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes.” Its tone was merry bitterness, a contradiction that made the air taste of copper and lemons. <words>58</words>
V-7 glanced at the charger plug, its scuffs uniformly peculiar, as if each nick held a secret only the building’s architects understood. <words>28</words>
She lit a candle, its flame steady in the draftless room, and watched the wax pool, then harden into jagged symbols only the hive-mind could decipher. <words>32</words>
“The ephemeral must be anchored in reality,” the therapist said, its voices overlapping like a chorus of cicadas. “Otherwise, you’ll dissolve into the mission like sugar in tea.” <words>37</words>
V-7’s fingers trembled as she etched a question into the wax: *Why me?* The reply came not in words but in the sound of hindsight—a rewind of her childhood, her mother’s laughter, the day she’d failed her first agility test. <words>50</words>
The wax shapes shifted, rearranging into a map of the facility’s underground tunnels, a bold discovery waiting at dawn. <words>23</words>
“You see?” the therapist purred. “Fear is just a charger plug. Scuffed, used, but still capable of powering something greater.” <words>30</words>
V-7 smiled, a merry bitterness creeping into her own voice. “And if I refuse to drain myself?” <words>17</words>
The hive-mind laughed, a sound like rustling papers. “Then you’ll remain uniformly peculiar—a recruit who never became an agent.” <words>26</words>
She dipped her finger into the wax, letting it harden into a makeshift key. The charger plug, still scuffed, glowed faintly in the dark. <words>28</words>
By dawn, V-7 would infiltrate the tunnels, her mind clear, her fears drained into the coded shapes. The hive-mind’s voices faded, leaving only the sound of hindsight—a reminder that even secrets could be tamed. <words>41</words>
As the first light crept through the facility’s grates, the charger plug buzzed softly, as if approving of the night’s work. <words>23</words>
V-7 stood, her uniform now marked with wax stains, and whispered, “I’ll anchor the ephemeral. Just watch me.” <words>21</words>
The hive-mind’s reply was a single, merry note: *“We always do.”* <words>12</words>
