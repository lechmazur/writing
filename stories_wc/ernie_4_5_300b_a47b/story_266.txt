The bleak clown arrived at the floating rock yoga studio when the day’s earliest train departed at dawn, his boots crunching gravel that shimmered like fractured ice. <words>25</words> Inside, the studio hovered above a mist-choked valley, its walls woven from translucent moss that hummed with the weight of unspoken vows. <words>43</words> He carried a clock hand that wouldn’t stop spinning, its tick a metallic whine that pierced the silence like a drill. <words>60</words>  

“Drifting promises,” he muttered, adjusting his polka-dot cravat. The phrase was his mantra, etched into his skin beneath layers of greasepaint. <words>77</words> The studio’s patrons—a collection of limber hermits and star-map enthusiasts—ignored him, their focus fixed on contorting into shapes that defied gravity and logic. <words>97</words> Technically absurd, he thought, grinning. Their poses mimicked constellations, but their hearts were anchored to the earth. <words>114</words>  

He climbed onto a lichen-crusted platform, the clock hand clutched in his gloved hand. <words>125</words> “Today,” he announced, voice rasping like sandpaper, “we dismantle illusions.” The hermits froze, their joints popping. <words>140</words> From his pocket, he produced a tattered notebook filled with private poetry, its pages scrawled in ink that glowed faintly blue. <words>157</words>  

The clown began to recite, his words slicing through the humid air. “*The northern lights are just a trick of the light,*” he intoned, “*but my grin is a supernova.*” With each line, he twisted the clock hand, its motion accelerating until it blurred into a silver disc. <words>187</words> The hermits’ poses wavered; their illusions of serenity frayed. <words>198</words>  

He was a master of this method—using poetry to unravel the threads of pretense. <words>210</words> The studio’s moss walls trembled, shedding spores that swirled like confetti. <words>221</words> “*You think yoga bends time?*” he sneered, “*But time bends only for those who dare to laugh at its face.*” The clock hand spun faster, its whine now a deafening shriek. <words>245</words>  

A hermit screamed, collapsing into a fetal position. The others followed, their discipline shattered. <words>259</words> The clown’s grin widened, revealing teeth filed to points. Jagged generosity, he called it—the act of destroying others’ delusions to fuel his own. <words>280</words>  

Outside, the northern lights flickered, their neon hues dimming. The clown raised his arms, the clock hand still spinning. “*Behold!*” he roared. “*I outshine the aurora with a grin!*” The studio’s floatation engines sputtered, rocking violently. <words>309</words>  

But the hermits were gone, fled into the mist. The clown laughed, a sound like shattering glass. <words>322</words> He tossed the clock hand into the air; it vanished, its spin echoing in the void. <words>334</words>  

Alone, he opened his notebook to a fresh page. “*Drifting promises,*” he wrote, “*are the only currency that matters.*” Then he added, “*P.S. The northern lights are jealous.*” <words>360</words>  

As dawn broke, the studio drifted lower, its moss walls darkening. The clown descended the gravel path, his grin a crescent moon in the gray light. Somewhere, a train whistled. He didn’t look back. <words>388</words>
