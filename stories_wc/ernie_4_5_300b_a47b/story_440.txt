The futuristic city recycling center hummed with drones sorting waste, but Kael stood apart, his boots crunching glass shards underfoot. <words>18</words>
A detached swordsman with a blade sheathed at his hip, he’d come here not for scrap metal, but for the street artist’s bin—a relic of the old world’s chaos. <words>32</words>
After the last swipe of paint completed a mural across the street, Kael had waited until the artist left, her vibrant scraps of canvas and paper abandoned. <words>33</words>
Now he knelt, sifting through the bin, his fingers brushing a jagged piece of sea pottery—a shard blue as the ocean that once drowned this coast. <words>35</words>
The Secret Weavers, a myth whispered in the city’s underbelly, claimed such fragments held memories of vows unbroken. <words>28</words>
Kael’s vow was impossible: to love without binding, to protect without claiming. <words>17</words>
He’d learned long ago that attachment led to ruin, yet here he was, meddling in the artist’s castoffs, seeking a way to consecrate his paradox. <words>32</words>
The center’s AI chirped, *“Waste reclamation in progress. Please vacate.”* Kael ignored it, arranging scraps into a collage—a faceless figure holding a sword, a shattered heart, and the sea pottery at its core. <words>39</words>
Playful seriousness colored his movements; he’d never been one for art, but the Weavers’ lore insisted collage could weave secrets into reality. <words>29</words>
As he glued the pottery shard to the canvas, a memory surfaced: a woman’s laugh, a duel fought under a neon moon, her final words—*“Love me lovingly detached.”* <words>36</words>
He’d failed her then, clinging too tightly. Now, he aimed to reassemble not just scraps, but his own fractured resolve. <words>28</words>
The AI screeched, *“Contaminant detected!”* as a drone swerved toward him. Kael slashed the air with his blade, not to harm, but to slice a path to the mural wall. <words>33</words>
He pressed the collage against the wet paint, its edges bleeding into the artwork—a fusion of street art and ancient ritual. <words>25</words>
The pottery shard glowed, and for a heartbeat, Kael felt the impossible vow take root: to guard the city’s heart while letting go of his own. <words>32</words>
The drones froze, their sensors overloaded by the collage’s sudden aura. Kael sheathed his blade, smiling faintly. <words>24</words>
He’d meddled just enough, by reassembling what others discarded, to turn a street artist’s bin into a shrine. <words>23</words>
As he walked away, the mural shifted—the faceless figure now wore his scar, the shattered heart mended with saltwater stitches. <words>28</words>
The Secret Weavers, wherever they were, would approve. <words>10</words>
And Kael, the lovingly detached swordsman, finally understood: to consecrate a vow, one must first become the collage—a mosaic of loss, hope, and the quiet courage to let go. <words>36</words>
