The uptight scribe, Elric, hunched over his ledger in the witch’s greenhouse, its glass walls clinging to a hill of gravestones like a second skin. <words>21</words>
Outside, the wind bellowed through the iron gates, rattling the bones of forgotten saints, but Elric’s quill scratched on, meticulous, unyielding—until he noticed the envelope. <words>40</words>
It lay beside the prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop, a gift from the witch herself, its filament glowing faintly, as if holding its breath. <words>49</words>
The bulb had arrived sealed, its waxy adhesive now flaking, and Elric, certainly uncertain of his place here, began analyzing the residue with a magnifying glass. <words>56</words>
The witch had said the bulb could “illuminate truths,” but Elric, whose steel-trap mind cradled empathy in arms of steel, saw only a puzzle. <words>57</words>
He scraped a sliver of adhesive, pressed it to his tongue—a habit from cataloging rare inks—and tasted the faintest hint of lavender, the witch’s signature. <words>53</words>
In the moment when the puzzle piece finally fits, he realized the adhesive wasn’t glue at all, but a potion to preserve secrets, to bind silence. <words>54</words>
The bulb flickered, casting elongated shadows that danced like restless spirits, and Elric’s stern facade cracked. <words>27</words>
He remembered the witch’s words: “Some truths are too bright to bear whole.” <words>18</words>
The greenhouse, once a tomb of silence, hummed with buried optimism, the plants swaying as if nodding in agreement. <words>31</words>
Elric’s fingers trembled as he touched the bulb’s glass, its warmth seeping into his skin, loosening the knots in his shoulders. <words>34</words>
He had come here to document the witch’s experiments, to reduce her magic to numbers, but now he saw the adhesive’s true purpose: not to seal, but to *hold*. <words>43</words>
To hold grief, to hold hope, to hold the quiet transformation between. <words>19</words>
The wind bellowed again, but this time, Elric smiled, his steel arms now cradling the bulb like a fragile heartbeat. <words>31</words>
He wrote in his ledger: *“The adhesive binds not what is lost, but what is found.”* <words>22</words>
The witch appeared in the doorway, her silhouette framed by the gravestones, and Elric, for the first time, did not lower his gaze. <words>33</words>
“You’ve figured it out,” she said, not a question. <words>11</words>
“Certainly uncertain,” he replied, “but… illuminated.” <words>16</words>
The bulb brightened, casting his shadow against the glass, a silhouette no longer hunched, but tall, resolved. <words>30</words>
Outside, the graves seemed less ominous, the wind less a threat. <words>15</words>
Elric’s quill hovered over the page, then dipped into the ink, not to record, but to *ask*. <words>21</words>
The witch nodded, and for the first time, Elric felt the greenhouse breathe with him, its buried optimism rising like steam from a kettle. <words>39</words>
He had come to cradle empathy in arms of steel, but now he understood: steel could bend, could hold, could *grow*. <words>35</words>
The bulb glowed steady, a beacon in the twilight, and Elric, the uptight scribe, let himself believe. <words>27</words>
