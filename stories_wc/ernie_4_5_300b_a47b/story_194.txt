The spirited lumberjack, Finn, pedaled his rust-speckled bike through the cobblestone alleys of Blackroot Hollow, the wind tousling his auburn beard. <words>21</words> His destination: the ossuary-turned-gourmet restaurant *The Bone Marrow*, where ancient stone arches framed tables adorned with linen and candlelight. <words>40</words> Finn’s motive was personal—to learn the village’s forgotten healing traditions, whispered to hold power over both body and shadow. <words>55</words>  

He’d first noticed the coded letter from a future war tucked inside a hollowed-out oak log during a dawn chop. <words>66</words> The parchment, stamped with a cryptic emblem, spoke of “reawakenings” and “hidden agendas,” its edges singed as if burned by time. <words>81</words> Finn, gracefully awkward in his flannel shirt and suspenders, had spent nights deciphering it by lamplight, his calloused fingers tracing symbols that shifted like smoke. <words>101</words>  

The letter’s warnings coiled around his thoughts during bike rides, each journey a ritual to shake loose the nightmares it rekindled—visions of ash-choked skies and a war that devoured the past to fuel the future. <words>128</words> Tonight, he’d confront the ossuary’s owner, Madame Veyra, a chef rumored to blend ancestral remedies into her dishes. <words>144</words>  

Inside, the restaurant hummed with the clink of crystal and the murmur of patrons unaware of the bones beneath their feet. <words>162</words> Madame Veyra, her silver hair coiled like a serpent, greeted Finn with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. <words>177</words> “You’ve come to *revamp* your palate, I assume?” she purred, sliding a menu across the table. <words>190</words>  

Finn slid the coded letter beside her plate. “I think you’ve already started,” he said, the harsh tenderness in his voice a blade wrapped in velvet. <words>208</words> Her knuckles whitened as she read, her composure cracking like porcelain. <words>220</words>  

“How?” she hissed. The letter’s symbols glowed faintly, reacting to her touch. <words>232</words>  

“Through reawakened nightmares,” Finn replied. “You’ve been using the ossuary’s energy to fuel… something. A war machine?” His awkwardness dissolved into resolve. <words>253</words>  

Madame Veyra laughed, a sound like grinding bone. “Healing and destruction are twins, boy. The traditions you seek? They’re a key—to save *or* to ruin.” <words>276</words>  

Finn’s bike rides had taught him to read the land’s secrets, and now he saw the truth: the restaurant’s “gourmet” dishes were laced with substances to induce visions, harvesting fear to power a future weapon. <words>299</words>  

“I’ll stop you,” Finn said, standing. His chair scraped the floor, a discordant note in the ossuary’s hush. <words>314</words>  

Madame Veyra’s eyes narrowed. “And who will heal *you* when the nightmares consume you?” <words>330</words>  

Finn left the letter on the table. “Maybe I’ll learn,” he said, the harsh tenderness lingering like a promise. <words>347</words>  

Outside, he mounted his bike, the ossuary’s shadows clinging to his boots. The coded letter’s final line echoed: *“The past is a knife—choose which end to hold.”* <words>372</words>  

Finn pedaled harder, the wind a balm against his skin. The war hadn’t won yet. Neither had he. <words>390</words>
