The sky reflection pool shimmered like liquid mercury, its surface mirroring the fractured sunset after the invention of time travel had unraveled chronology itself. <words>23</words> Lira Veyra, a femme fatale heartbreak counselor who’d traded empathy for enigmas, stood at the pool’s edge, her amber earrings catching the light like twin suns. <words>45</words> She’d come here to track cloud trails—a method she’d devised to map the gravity of desires, those invisible forces that pulled people through time and ruin. <words>67</words>  

Her restlessly curious nature had led her here, to this liminal space where the past and future pooled like water. <words>83</words> Clients often accused her of coldness, but Lira knew the truth: she sought freedom in a cage of illusions, the same cage she’d helped others escape. <words>104</words> Today, she’d zip her leather jacket tight against the chill, her fingers brushing the earrings—a gift from a lover who’d vanished into a timeline she’d erased. <words>123</words>  

The pool’s surface rippled as she tossed a pebble, its splash distorting the clouds above. <words>138</words> By tracking their trails, she could divine where desire would strike next, like a storm predicting its own path. <words>153</words> A client’s ex-husband had time-jumped to avoid alimony; a teenager’s crush had materialized in 1942. <words>169</words> Lira’s job was to untangle the knots, but lately, she’d begun to wonder: was she the puppet or the puppeteer? <words>186</words>  

She knelt, dipping a hand into the pool. The water stung, cold and alive, as if the pool itself resisted her touch. <words>203</words> A cloud trail curved overhead, sharp and sudden. She followed it with her gaze, then zipped her jacket’s collar higher, a gesture of cautious impulsiveness. <words>222</words> The trail led to a figure standing on the far side—a woman with Lira’s eyes, wearing the same earrings. <words>238</words>  

“You’re late,” the woman said, her voice echoing across the pool. <words>247</words> Lira’s breath hitched. This was the illusion she’d built: a version of herself unburdened by guilt, unshackled by time. <words>264</words> “I’ve been tracking you,” Lira replied, her tone sharper than she intended. <words>277</words> The woman smiled, a mirror of Lira’s own smirk. “And I’ve been waiting. The gravity of your desires is strong enough to collapse dimensions.” <words>298</words>  

Lira stepped back, the pool’s edge crumbling beneath her heel. <words>307</words> She’d always known her methods were dangerous, but this—this was a cage she’d built for herself. <words>323</words> The amber earrings burned against her skin, a reminder of the lover she’d erased, the clients she’d failed. <words>339</words> “Free me,” she whispered, not to the woman, but to the pool. <words>350</words> The water stilled, then erupted in a geyser, hurling Lira into the sky. <words>362</words>  

As she fell, the cloud trails coiled around her like serpents, and for the first time, she didn’t fight them. <words>378</words> The gravity of her desires had finally found its anchor: not in time, but in the truth she’d avoided. <words>394</words> She zipped her jacket one last time, a silent vow to embrace the chaos. <words>409</words> The pool below reflected not a cage, but a door—one she’d walk through, unafraid. <words>425</words>
