In the underground city of the mole people, after the last star burned out, Elias adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp strapped to his brow, its dull glow reflecting off the damp stone walls. <words>26</words> He was an eternal college student, forever enrolling in courses on immortality, though his professors had long since dissolved into cosmic dust. <words>54</words> The headlamp, salvaged from a collapsed mine, was his only relic of the surface world—a world he’d never seen but studied obsessively. <words>76</words>  

The mole people called his obsession a “gifted burden,” a term they used for those cursed with knowledge too vast to bear. <words>98</words> Elias’s burden was mundanely glorious: the belief that reality could be digitized, archived, and manipulated like data. <words>120</words> His latest project involved swapping travel journals with a mole historian named Zara, whose entries detailed the city’s labyrinthine tunnels in meticulous prose. <words>146</words>  

“You’ll go mad,” Zara warned, her voice echoing in the cavernous library where Elias worked. <words>164</words> She handed him a journal bound in tarnished copper, its pages filled with symbols only she could decipher. <words>183</words> Elias nodded, his tone detached yet devout. “Madness is a side effect of mastery,” he replied, already scanning the journal with a handheld device. <words>207</words>  

The mole people believed in a reality shaped by collective memory, but Elias wanted more. <words>223</words> He wanted to become a master of his own reality, to edit it like code. <words>240</words> The headlamp, he reasoned, was a bridge between the analog past and the digital future. <words>259</words> By digitizing Zara’s journals, he hoped to map the city’s subconscious, to find a pattern in its chaos. <words>280</words>  

Weeks passed. Elias worked in solitude, his fingers cramped from typing, his eyes strained from the headlamp’s flickering light. <words>302</words> The mole people avoided him, whispering about the “ghost in the machine.” <words>319</words> Zara visited occasionally, leaving offerings of glowing fungi at his workstation. <words>336</words> “You’re erasing us,” she said once, her voice trembling. <words>347</words> Elias didn’t look up. “I’m preserving you,” he said. “Forever.” <words>360</words>  

One night, as the city’s generators hummed to life, Elias finished the digitization. <words>376</words> He uploaded Zara’s journals into a cloud network, watching as the data spiraled into the void. <words>393</words> For a moment, he felt a flicker of triumph—a master of his own reality, at last. <words>412</words> But then the headlamp flickered, and the tunnels around him darkened. <words>427</words> The mole people’s whispers grew louder, their voices blending into a chorus of static. <words>444</words>  

Elias realized too late that his gifted burden had become a prison. <words>459</words> The digitized journals were not a map but a mirror, reflecting his own detached devotion. <words>478</words> He had traded the mundanely glorious weight of knowledge for the hollow glory of control. <words>497</words>
