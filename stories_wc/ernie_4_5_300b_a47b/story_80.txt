The daring pathfinder, Lira Vey, knelt on the rusted rails of an abandoned roller coaster, her fingers brushing the antique doorknob clutched in her palm—a relic she’d pried from the jaws of a crumbling inn’s basement. <words>25</words> Amid the creak of settling metal and the whisper of wind through fractured wood, she muttered, “The last fragment… but of what?” <words>43</words> Her ingeniously clueless approach had led her here: a woman who solved riddles by tripping over their solutions, yet whose intuition hummed like a compass needle. <words>67</words>  

The doorknob’s brass surface was etched with symbols that shifted under moonlight, a riddle older than time itself. <words>81</words> Lira’s motivation burned fiercer with each failed attempt to decode it—a need to prove that chaos could be tamed, even if her methods resembled a toddler’s finger-painting. <words>104</words> She’d eroded her sanity by investigating bizarre housekeeping logs in haunted inns, scribbling notes in margins of tattered ledgers: *“Guest 3B complained of a door that opened to nowhere. Next morning, their shoes were filled with sand.”* <words>132</words>  

Now, perched on the coaster’s skeletal spine, she flipped open a journal, its pages yellowed and stuck together. <words>148</words> Amid page turns, the air thickened with the scent of mildew and something sharper—a static charge that made her hair stand on end. <words>166</words> The logs had mentioned this place: *“The Silver Scream’s final drop… doors appear at midnight.”* Lira grinned, her quiet mania flaring. <words>185</words> “So the track’s the key,” she mused, tracing the rails. “But how?”  

She pressed the doorknob against the nearest support beam. It clicked, locking into place. <words>203</words> The ground shuddered. Rails groaned as vines erupted from the concrete, twisting into a spiral staircase that vanished into the clouds. <words>218</words> “Ingenious,” she breathed, though she hadn’t intended the pun. <words>227</words>  

Climbing, she passed rooms suspended mid-air—a library with books that screamed when opened, a nursery where dolls wept black tears. <words>243</words> Each held fragments of the riddle, but the doorknob’s symbols remained stubbornly silent. <words>257</words>  

At the summit, she found a door made of shattered mirrors. <words>266</words> The doorknob fit perfectly. As she turned it, the mirrors reflected not her face, but a thousand versions of herself—each holding a different fragment. <words>283</words> “The last fragment isn’t an object,” she realized, her voice trembling. “It’s a choice.”  

The housekeeping logs had hinted at this: *“To erase the riddle, one must become the answer.”* <words>303</words> Lira’s ingeniously clueless nature had always been her strength—she saw patterns where others saw chaos. <words>318</words>  

She let go of the doorknob. The mirrors shattered, raining glass that dissolved into stardust. <words>331</words> The roller coaster collapsed behind her, but Lira stood on solid ground, the doorknob now a simple, tarnished knob in her hand. <words>347</words>  

The riddle was solved. The last fragment had been her willingness to erode her own certainty, to investigate until the absurd became inevitable. <words>364</words>  

As dawn broke, she walked away, the knob cold in her pocket. <words>373</words> Somewhere, a door creaked open, and Lira smiled. The next riddle awaited. <words>384</words>  

Her quiet mania had carried her this far. What came next? She didn’t know—and that, she decided, was perfect. <words>400</words>
