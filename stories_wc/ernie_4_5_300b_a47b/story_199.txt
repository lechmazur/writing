After the last human dream is dreamt, the urban orchard on the repurposed highway overpass becomes a labyrinth of flickering shadows, where the overzealous park ranger, Marlowe, patrols with a plain notebook clutched to his chest. <words>29</words> His boots crunch gravel that once bore the weight of engines, now nurturing apple trees and blackberry vines. <words>44</words> Marlowe’s motivation is singular: to catch the echo of a goddess, a myth whispered by his grandmother before she vanished into the static of forgotten frequencies. <words>66</words>  

The orchard’s air hums with a familiarly unknown tension—branches sway like restless limbs, and fruit glows faintly, as if lit from within. <words>85</words> Marlowe’s notebook, its pages filled with scribbled coordinates and fragmented equations, is his compass. <words>99</words> He believes the goddess’s echo hides here, a remnant of the dreamless void, and that his grandmother’s secrets are the key to capturing it. <words>118</words>  

His method is through chance encounters. <words>122</words> Each day, he interrogates the orchard’s lone visitors: a street artist painting murals of drowned cities, a homeless poet reciting verses about time loops, a botanist who insists the plants communicate in Morse code. <words>147</words> Marlowe records their words, certain they fluctuate between truth and delusion, like the orchard’s shifting light. <words>164</words>  

One evening, as dusk bleeds into the concrete, Marlowe spots a woman perched on a rusted guardrail, her silhouette merging with the vines. <words>183</words> She wears a dress stitched from orchard leaves, and her eyes reflect the glow of the fruit. <words>195</words> “You’re looking for the wrong thing,” she says, her voice a crackle of static. <words>206</words> “The goddess isn’t here. She’s in the margins of your notebook.” <words>220</words>  

Marlowe scoffs but flips open the notebook. <words>225</words> The pages, once blank, now swarm with his grandmother’s handwriting—a language he’s never seen, yet recognizes. <words>240</words> The woman vanishes, leaving only a single apple, its skin etched with the same symbols. <words>254</words>  

That night, Marlowe dreams of the overpass before it was an orchard: a highway choked with cars, his grandmother standing in the median, waving a notebook like a flag. <words>275</words> When he wakes, the apple is gone, but the notebook’s pages now hold a map of the orchard, its paths diverging into impossible angles. <words>294</words>  

He spends days tracing the map, his zeal bordering on mania. <words>302</words> The orchard’s layout fluctuates—a grove of pear trees becomes a thicket of thorns, then reverts. <words>317</words> Visitors report seeing Marlowe argue with empty air, his notebook open, scribbling furiously. <words>331</words>  

In the end, he finds the goddess’s echo not in a person, but in the chaos itself—the orchard’s refusal to stay still, the way his grandmother’s secrets bloom and fade like seasons. <words>356</words> The notebook, once a tool for control, becomes a mirror of his own fractured pursuit. <words>371</words> Marlowe keeps patrolling, still overzealous, still chasing ghosts, but now he understands: the echo isn’t something to catch. It’s the reason he keeps looking. <words>397</words>
