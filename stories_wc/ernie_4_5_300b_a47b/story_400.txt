<story>
The glacial orchard, suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, had not heard a human voice since the last one set foot on Earth centuries ago. <words>22</words>
Lirael, a guarded druid with bark-like skin and eyes like storm clouds, stood beneath a frost-encrusted apple tree, clutching a dull safety pin—her only relic of a vanished world. <words>33</words>
She had come to gather ingredients for a special family meal prepared only on birthdays, though she’d long since forgotten whose. <words>23</words>
The meal was a ritual to break the silence, a tradition her ancestors had clung to even after humanity’s extinction, but Lirael’s fiercely ambivalent heart resisted its pull. <words>30</words>
Why bother? The orchard’s only audience was the wind, which howled through the crevasse like a ghostly chorus. <words>19</words>
Yet here she was, plucking ice-shimmered berries and scraping lichen from stone, her movements precise, her silence a fortress. <words>22</words>
The safety pin, dull and rusted, had once pinned a child’s drawing to a refrigerator—a fact she’d gleaned from half-remembered tales. <words>21</words>
Now it weighed in her pocket like a dare: *Speak. Risk.* <words>9</words>
As she worked, dour amusement curled in her chest. The orchard’s “fruits” were bitter, the lichen tasteless, yet she prepared them with ritualistic care, stirring them into a broth that steamed in the cold air. <words>31</words>
Her motivation was a crippling fear—not of the dark, or the ice, but of the void left by humanity’s absence. <words>20</words>
What if the silence was all that remained? What if she, too, faded into it? <words>15</words>
The broth simmered, and Lirael hesitated, safety pin in hand. Then, with a flick of her wrist, she dropped it into the pot. <words>20</words>
A metallic clang echoed, shattering the stillness. The orchard seemed to inhale. <words>14</words>
For a heartbeat, she froze, expecting retribution. Instead, the wind carried a faint, familiar scent—apples, earth, and something like hope. <words>20</words>
Lirael laughed, a sound as sharp as the crevasse below. The meal tasted of ash and memory, but she ate it anyway, spoon scraping the bowl. <words>22</words>
Breaking the silence hadn’t cured her fear. It had simply proven she could endure it. <words>16</words>
As she packed the empty bowl, the orchard shuddered, a low groan rising from the ice. <words>15</words>
Lirael smiled, dour amusement softening into something warmer. Tomorrow, she’d gather again. <words>15</words>
And maybe, just maybe, she’d speak the safety pin’s story aloud. <words>11</words>
The crevasse yawned below, indifferent. Above, the frost-laden branches gleamed, as if waiting. <words>15</words>
Lirael walked home, her footsteps crunching, the silence no longer a prison but a companion. <words>16</words>
After all, even a guarded druid could learn to break the ice—one rusted pin at a time. <words>16</words>
