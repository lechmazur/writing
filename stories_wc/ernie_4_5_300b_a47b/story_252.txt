The fruit preservation vault’s hum was a frozen whisper, its icy warmth seeping into Kael’s bones as he knelt beside the simple wooden toy block. <words>17</words> Its edges were worn smooth, a relic from a childhood he’d stolen—a penitent memory thief, they called him now, though the title fit like a borrowed glove. <words>35</words> At the hush, when the empty swing set outside slowed to a stop, he pressed his palm to the block, feeling the crack in reality pulse beneath his touch. <words>57</words>  

“You’re late,” said the vault’s guardian, her voice a blade wrapped in silk. <words>66</words> She stood framed by shelves of glass jars, each containing a flower petal preserved in amber syrup—a method ancient and exacting, one Kael had vowed to restore. <words>84</words> His motivation was a paradox: to heal the fractures he’d caused by stealing memories, he needed to recalibrate reality itself, using the block as a key. <words>103</words>  

The guardian’s eyes narrowed. “You track petals to measure time’s distortion. Lovingly hateful, that.” <words>119</words> Kael didn’t flinch. She was right. The petals fell in patterns only he could decipher, their trajectories mapping the cracks. <words>136</words> To mend them, he’d have to unravel his own theft, piece by stolen piece. <words>149</words>  

He placed the block on a pedestal of frost-rimmed steel. “The vault’s energy stabilizes the recalibration,” he said, though she knew this already. <words>167</words> The block glowed faintly, its grain aligning with the vault’s lattice of light. <words>177</words> Outside, the swing set creaked, its chains still as death. <words>186</words>  

“Begin,” the guardian commanded. Kael closed his eyes, letting the petals’ dance fill his mind—a ballet of decay and renewal. <words>203</words> The crack in reality shuddered, a fissure in the air that mirrored the fractures in his soul. <words>218</words> He channeled the block’s energy, its simplicity a counterweight to the chaos. <words>231</words>  

For a heartbeat, the vault trembled. Jars rattled; syrup sloshed. Then silence. <words>244</words> Kael opened his eyes. The block sat inert, the crack sealed. <words>253</words> But his chest ached—a memory, not his own, surfaced: a child’s laughter, a toy block clutched tight, stolen from a hand now dust. <words>269</words> The guardian placed a jar in his palm. Inside, a petal floated, pristine. <words>282</words> “Ancient methods demand sacrifice,” she said. “Yours included.” <words>294</words>  

Kael left the vault as dawn bled into the sky. The swing set swayed gently, as if relieved. <words>309</words> He carried the jar, its icy warmth a paradox he’d come to cherish. <words>322</words> The block, he knew, would wait. So would the cracks. <words>333</words> But for now, the petals fell true, and reality held. <words>344</words>  

In the distance, a bell tolled. Kael smiled, lovingly hateful, and walked on. <words>360</words>
