The steampunk submarine’s observation deck hummed with the groan of rusted gears, its portholes streaked with salt and regret. <words>17</words> Lira Vey, a wayward apothecary with vials of iridescent tonics strapped to her belt, leaned against a brass railing, her gaze fixed on the churning black waters. <words>34</words> Between broken treaties, the world above had forgotten the migratory butterflies that once painted the skies—but Lira hadn’t. <words>48</words> She’d built this vessel, *The Icarus*, to track their phantom flights, though the crew muttered she was chasing ghosts. <words>62</words>

Her only companion was the dry highlighter pen clutched in her left hand, its plastic casing cracked but still clinging to a faint yellow hue. <words>79</words> It wasn’t for marking maps—not anymore. <words>83</words> When the captain had discovered her “unconventional methods,” he’d called her “unjustly fair,” a jab at her refusal to poison rivals like other apothecaries. <words>104</words> “You infect loyalty with your damnable morality,” he’d spat, before storming off to drown his fury in gin. <words>118</words>

Lira smiled thinly. Let him think her mad. <words>124</words> The highlighter’s tip clicked rhythmically against the deck’s metal plating, tapping out Morse code signals only the butterflies could decipher. <words>138</words> She’d reverse-engineered their migratory patterns by infecting their larvae with a harmless bioluminescent fungus, its spores glowing like starlight in the dark. <words>156</words> The code was her language to them, a plea: *Stay. Let the world see what it’s lost.* <words>168</words>

The deck shuddered as *The Icarus* dove deeper, pressure squeezing the portholes until they bowed inward. <words>182</words> Lira’s breath fogged the glass. Somewhere above, the treaties lay shattered, nations arming for wars over dwindling resources. <words>196</words> But here, in the battered marvel of this submarine, she clung to hope. <words>205</words> The highlighter’s clicks grew urgent, a frantic heartbeat. <words>212</words> A response flickered in her mind—not words, but a surge of warmth, a promise. <words>222</words>

“You feel it too,” she whispered, though the air was silent. <words>229</words> The fungus wasn’t just a tracker; it carried her essence, a subtle alchemy that bound her to the butterflies. <words>243</words> Unconventional love, the captain would say. But Lira knew better. <words>253</words> Love wasn’t a cage—it was an infection, a wildfire that refused to die. <words>264</words>

A alarm blared. The deck tilted, throwing her against the railing. <words>274</words> “Depth charge!” a crewman shouted. <words>278</words> Lira’s grip tightened on the highlighter. The butterflies’ signal cut off abruptly, replaced by static. <words>290</words> *No*, she thought. *Not now.* <words>295</words>

The submarine lurched, metal screaming. <words>299</words> Through the porthole, a swarm of glowing wings erupted from the dark, their light piercing the abyss. <words>312</words> The crew froze, awe softening their fear. <words>318</words> Lira’s chest ached. They’d come, not for her, but for the promise in the code. <words>330</words>

“See?” she murmured, tears mixing with salt spray. “They remember.” <words>339</words> The captain stared, his face unreadable. <words>345</words> Maybe, for once, he saw the truth: justice wasn’t fairness. It was the courage to love what the world deemed lost. <words>362</words>

As the butterflies dissolved into the void, Lira resumed tapping, her message unbroken. <words>374</words> The highlighter’s clicks echoed, a beacon in the dark. <words>382</words> Somewhere, beyond broken treaties and rusted metal, a fragile, fierce hope took flight. <words>396</words>
