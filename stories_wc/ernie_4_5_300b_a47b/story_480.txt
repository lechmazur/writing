The final chord of the abandoned music hall’s ghost echo faded, leaving only the hum of neon signs bleeding through broken windows. <words>20</words>
Jessa, a social media exorcist by trade, slid her phone into her coat pocket, its screen still glowing with the hashtag #GhostlyGrooves. <words>42</words>
She’d come to purge the hall’s digital afterlife—unwanted likes, viral hauntings, the kind of clutter that clung to places long after their purpose died. <words>67</words>
But tonight, curiosity gnawed. She’d traced a rumor to this mess hall two blocks over, where “familiar strangers” gathered to trade secrets. <words>91</words>
The receipt in her hand—crumpled, ink-faded, dated 2003—had been tucked into a library book she’d “exorcised” last week. <words>115</words>
*Eggs, milk, aspirin*, it read. Nothing special. Yet the margins were scribbled with coordinates and a time: *midnight, after the music dies*. <words>139</words>
Jessa’s indifferent enthusiasm flickered. She’d always fed on life’s raw edge, the chaos beneath the algorithm. <words>161</words>
The mess hall’s door hung crooked, its paint peeling like old skin. Inside, shadows pooled on linoleum floors, cracked and sticky with spilled soda. <words>187</words>
A group huddled in the corner, their faces illuminated by phone screens—*quietly loud*, the kind of silence that thrummed with unspoken codes. <words>212</words>
“You’re late,” said a woman with a nose ring, her voice slicing through the dark. “The receipt’s your key.” <words>234</words>
Jessa unfolded it. The woman nodded. “Follow the hum.” <words>246</words>
The alley behind the hall was a labyrinth of graffiti and rusted fire escapes. Jessa climbed, each step echoing like a heartbeat. <words>270</words>
At the top, a door marked *The Echo Chamber* waited. She knocked. A slot slid open, revealing a single eye. “Password?” <words>293</words>
“*Reignite*,” Jessa said, recalling the receipt’s faint scribble. The door clicked. <words>309</words>
Inside, the club thrummed with basslines and the clink of glasses. Strangers danced, their faces half-hidden by masks, yet their movements mirrored each other—*familiar strangers*. <words>334</words>
A bartender slid her a drink. “You’re the exorcist?” he asked. “We’ve been expecting you.” <words>353</words>
Jessa shrugged. “I don’t exorcise people.” <words>363</words>
He grinned. “No. But you *collect* them. The unseen threads.” He gestured to the crowd. “We’re all here because of something we lost. Or found.” <words>392</words>
She sipped her drink. It tasted like burnt sugar and regret. “And the receipt?” <words>408</words>
“A map,” he said. “To the places where the digital and the real… *reignite*.” <words>430</words>
Jessa pulled out her phone, its screen now dark. For once, she didn’t miss the glow. <words>450</words>
Outside, the music hall’s ghost chord seemed to shiver, as if acknowledging her choice. She tucked the receipt back into her pocket. <words>473</words>
The alley stretched before her, endless and alive. Jessa walked on, indifferent enthusiasm fueling her steps. The night was just beginning. <words>500</words>
