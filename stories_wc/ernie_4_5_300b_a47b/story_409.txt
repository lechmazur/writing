The bruised fighter’s knuckles ached as he climbed the creaking ladder into the dusty attic, each step stirring memories of a life he’d vowed to abandon. <words>19</words>
Clockwork animals lined the walls, their gears whirring like phantom breaths in the stillness, their painted eyes fixed on him as if they knew his secret. <words>36</words>
At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble below—a sound he felt in his bones—he spotted the clay pot shard half-buried in cobwebs, its inscription glowing faintly. <words>42</words>
*“Stand where the shadow bends,”* it read, a phrase that had haunted his dreams for weeks, though he’d dismissed them as forgotten echoes. <words>30</words>
He’d always been skillfully incompetent: a boxer who’d mastered the art of losing just enough to survive, a man who’d let others define his limits. <words>32</words>
But tonight, the shard’s pull was undeniable—a compulsion to abduct himself from the life he’d settled for, to confront the self-deception that had kept him caged. <words>36</words>
The clockwork fox near the window twitched its tail, its gears grinding as if warning him, but he pressed on, clutching the shard. <words>29</words>
Through forgotten dreams, the method whispered to him: not a physical kidnapping, but a reclamation of the self he’d buried beneath excuses. <words>30</words>
The sculptor’s chisel rang again, sharper now, and the attic’s air thickened, as if the room itself held its breath. <words>25</words>
He remembered the first time he’d let a opponent’s punch land—not out of fear, but to prove he could take it, a lie he’d repeated until he believed it. <words>36</words>
The shard’s inscription burned his palm, its edges sharp enough to draw blood, a reminder that standing for something meant embracing the pain. <words>30</words>
The clockwork owl hooted, its voice a metallic screech, and the fighter froze, certain the machines were alive, judging him. <words>29</words>
But then he laughed—a raw, bitter sound—because if ghosts of gears could judge, so could he. <words>22</words>
He’d extinguish the last vestige of self-deception by choosing, finally, to fight not for survival, but for meaning. <words>27</words>
The sculptor’s chisel struck a final, decisive blow, and the marble split, revealing a flawless form beneath—a mirror to the fighter’s own potential. <words>32</words>
In the attic, the clockwork animals fell silent, their gears stilling as if in respect. <words>17</words>
The fighter descended the ladder, the shard clutched to his chest, its inscription now etched into his soul. <words>23</words>
Downstairs, the sculptor admired his work, unaware of the battle waged above, or the man who’d just learned to stand. <words>26</words>
The fighter walked into the night, his steps unsteady but purposeful, the weight of the shard a promise he’d keep. <words>25</words>
He’d been skillfully incompetent long enough; tonight, he’d choose to be unapologetically, gloriously alive. <words>24</words>
