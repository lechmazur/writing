The ephemeral art gallery, a labyrinth of glass and ice, hummed with the quiet tension of snow days. <words>16</words>  
Elias, a hardheaded traveler with a coat frayed at the cuffs, pressed his palm against a frosted window, watching snowflakes dissolve into the street below. <words>34</words>  
He’d come here seeking solace in nature’s embrace, though the gallery’s sterile white walls mocked his intent. <words>25</words>  
In the corner, beneath a sculpture of twisted vines, he spotted a bookshelf—a relic in this transient space. <words>24</words>  
Among the volumes, one stood out: a leather-bound tome with a hollowed spine, a secret book safe. <words>21</words>  
Inside lay scraps of prophecy, their edges singed, as if torn from a fire’s maw. <words>18</words>  
Elias’s fingers trembled as he pieced together the fragments. <words>12</words>  
*“The price of power is a heart wholeheartedly broken,”* one scrap read. <words>15</words>  
He scoffed. Demure audacity curled in his chest—how could a few words dictate his fate? <words>19</words>  
Yet he lingered, struggling to reconcile his skepticism with the gallery’s eerie stillness. <words>20</words>  
Outside, the snow fell thicker, blurring the line between earth and sky. <words>15</words>  
A guard approached, his breath visible in the cold. “The gallery closes soon,” he warned. <words>18</words>  
Elias nodded, tucking the scraps into his coat. They clung to him like a second skin. <words>20</words>  
Back at his inn, he lit a candle and spread the prophecies on the desk. <words>17</words>  
*“To wield the storm, one must first become the storm.”* <words>13</words>  
He thought of his journey—the storms he’d weathered, the bridges burned. <words>15</words>  
Was this the cost? To surrender his wholeness for a fleeting grasp of control? <words>19</words>  
The candle flickered, casting shadows that danced like ghosts. <words>13</words>  
In the gallery’s corner, the book safe had felt like a confession. <words>16</words>  
Here, amid the quiet, it felt like a verdict. <words>11</words>  
Elias traced the edge of a scrap. *“Solace is not found in embrace, but in release.”* <words>20</words>  
He laughed, a sound brittle as ice. Nature’s embrace had led him here, to this puzzle. <words>21</words>  
Yet the words gnawed at him, relentless. <words>8</words>  
The snow outside had stopped. Moonlight pooled on the sill. <words>13</words>  
He stood, pacing, the scraps crumpling in his grip. <words>12</words>  
To become the storm… to shed the fragments of himself he clung to like armor. <words>23</words>  
The price was steep, but the alternative—a life half-lived—felt heavier. <words>19</words>  
In the gallery’s corner, he’d felt wholeheartedly broken, yet alive. <words>17</words>  
Here, with the prophecies as his compass, he chose to struggle forward. <words>18</words>  
The candle guttered. Elias blew it out, plunging the room into darkness. <words>17</words>  
Somewhere, the storm waited. And he, finally, was ready to meet it. <words>16</words>
