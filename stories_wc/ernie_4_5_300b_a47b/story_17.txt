The witch’s incantation chamber smelled of aged parchment and iron filings, its cobwebbed rafters casting fractured light over a chipped bowl perched on a moss-eaten altar. <words>22</words> Mara, a guilt-ridden black market genealogist, traced the bowl’s cracks with her thumb—a relic her client had insisted was “atypically typical” of their family’s cursed lineage. <words>44</words> She’d smuggled it here at dawn, amid morning walks through the graveyard, her boots crunching frost as she rehearsed eulogies in her head. <words>63</words>  

Her trade was excavating secrets, but lately, the skeletons she unearthed felt heavier. <words>74</words> Last month, she’d exposed a nobleman’s bastard child, ruining his political career and indirectly causing his suicide. <words>91</words> Now, she sought renewal—not through spells, but by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, decoding the lies families told to bury their shame. <words>113</words> The chipped bowl, she believed, held a key.  

“Zoom in on the cracks,” she muttered, activating a holographic projector. <words>125</words> The bowl’s surface flickered, revealing micro-engravings: a genealogical tree etched in reverse, names spiraling downward like a drain. <words>139</words> Among them, *Elias Veyra*—a name she’d seen in a eulogy for a drowned sailor, eulogized as a hero but rumored to have murdered his crew. <words>158</words>  

Mara’s breath hitched. The sailor’s widow had hired her to “prove his innocence,” but Mara’s research confirmed the rumors. <words>174</words> She’d handed the widow a forged document instead, a brazen act of modesty to spare her grief. <words>189</words> Now, the bowl’s engravings suggested Elias’s guilt was hereditary, a curse passed through bloodlines. <words>204</words>  

“You’re not just a thief,” Mara whispered to the bowl. “You’re a mirror.” <words>216</words> She pulled up the sailor’s eulogy, zooming in on phrases like *“lost to the sea’s mercy”* and *“his heart, though flawed, beat true.”* <words>235</words> The subtext screamed contradiction: a man both villain and victim, his legacy fragmented like the bowl. <words>250</words>  

Outside, the chamber’s stained-glass windows rattled as wind howled through the graveyard. <words>262</words> Mara’s client would arrive soon, expecting answers. <words>271</words> Instead, she’d give them the bowl and a confession: *“I’ve been selling lies. But here’s the truth—we’re all cracked, all trying to hold water.”* <words>293</words>  

The bowl’s reflection warped in the projector’s light, showing not a family tree, but a labyrinth. <words>306</words> Mara smiled, brazen in her modesty. <words>312</words> Renewal wasn’t about erasing the past, but carrying its weight with honesty. <words>325</words> She’d start by returning the nobleman’s money, then apologize to the widow. <words>338</words> The chipped bowl, she realized, wasn’t a curse—it was a compass. <words>347</words>  

As sunlight pierced the chamber, Mara placed the bowl back on the altar. <words>358</words> Its cracks gleamed, atypically typical, a map to forgiveness. <words>369</words> She stepped outside, the graveyard’s silence amplifying her resolve. <words>380</words> The morning walks had led her here, to the brink of renewal, where guilt could finally dissolve into grace. <words>398</words>
