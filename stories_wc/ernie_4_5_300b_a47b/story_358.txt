The arctic research greenhouse stood as a crystalline oasis amid the frostbitten tundra, its glass walls humming with geothermal warmth. <words>20</words> Old-fashioned mage Thaddeus Blackthorn drifted through the aisles of bioluminescent algae, his woolen robes trailing like a shadow too ancient for the fluorescent lights. <words>41</words> He carried a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin—a jagged slab of obsidian-black stone etched with hieroglyphs that shifted when unobserved—tucked under his arm like a misplaced relic. <words>63</words> Amid the clamor of playground time (children’s laughter echoed from the adjacent recreation dome), he paused to cuddle a stray polar fox kit, its fur matted with frost. <words>86</words> The animal’s warmth seeped into his bones, a fleeting comfort against the sanctified dread that coiled in his chest. <words>102</words>

Thaddeus had come to the greenhouse not for the plants, but to claim an uncharted frontier: the liminal space between mirrors. <words>118</words> The facility’s security system relied on reflective panels to monitor blind spots, creating a labyrinth of ephemeral encounters. <words>135</words> By positioning himself at precise angles, he could interact with his own reflection—a version of himself unburdened by time’s weight—to unravel the coffin fragment’s riddle. <words>156</words> “*Purposefully aimless*,” he muttered, tracing the stone’s glyphs with a gnarled finger. <words>168</words> The phrase echoed the mage’s own existence; he wandered not for discovery, but to outpace the void gnawing at his soul. <words>185</words>

A child’s shriek pierced the air. Thaddeus turned, catching his reflection in a convex mirror. The image winked, then *moved*. <words>201</words> His doppelgänger stepped through the glass, its robes billowing with stardust. “You cling to fragments,” it chided, “yet fear the whole.” <words>220</words> Thaddeus recoiled, but the reflection cuddled the fox kit, its touch melting the ice from its paws. <words>236</words> “The pharaoh’s curse is not death,” it whispered, “but the illusion of control.” <words>252</words>

The greenhouse lights flickered. Thaddeus’s reflection dissolved, leaving only the coffin fragment glowing faintly. <words>267</words> He realized the riddle’s answer: the stone was not a key, but a mirror. <words>280</words> To claim the frontier, he must surrender his aimless wandering—accept that some mysteries are not meant to be solved, but endured. <words>299</words>

Outside, the aurora borealis rippled like a celestial sigh. Thaddeus placed the fragment on a pedestal of lichen-crusted rock, its glyphs now still. <words>318</words> The fox kit nuzzled his hand, and for the first time in centuries, he smiled. <words>331</words> The greenhouse’s mirrors, he noted, no longer showed his reflection—only the faint outline of a man who had finally learned to stand still. <words>352</words>

As playground time ended, Thaddeus exited into the arctic night, the coffin fragment’s purpose fulfilled. <words>370</words> He walked not with dread, but a quiet resolve: the frontier was not a place, but a state of being. <words>388</words> And he, old-fashioned mage though he was, would meet it on its own terms—through cuddles, riddles, and the fragile magic of mirrors. <words>407</words>
