The subterranean waterfall’s roar filled the cavern, its spray painting the air with a silver mist that clung to Lira’s skin like a second veil. <words>18</words> She stood on a narrow ledge, her fingers brushing the damp stone, as the ice sculpture above her groaned—a towering figure carved from glacial blue ice, its surface crackling with frost. <words>37</words> In the final second before it collapsed, Lira, the court’s poison taster with a death wish, pressed a simple cloth bookmark into the fissure where the sculpture’s base met the rock. <words>61</words> The fabric, frayed at the edges and stitched with a threadbare symbol, was her only link to the hidden societies that pulsed beneath the city’s surface. <words>83</words>  

The bookmark’s purpose was not to mark pages but to bind—to channel the energy flows that surged through the earth, invisible to most but visceral to her. <words>104</words> Lira had spent years interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, those desperate voices pleading for guidance from the “other side,” to map the patterns of this energy. <words>128</words> The psychics, she’d realized, were unwitting conduits, their ramblings echoing the vibrations of the hidden societies that manipulated the world above. <words>151</words>  

Now, as the ice sculpture trembled, Lira closed her eyes, letting the roar of the waterfall merge with the memory of a caller’s voice: *“The ground’s alive! It’s… humming!”* The bookmark trembled in her grip, its threads glowing faintly, as if absorbing the sculpture’s impending demise. <words>183</words> She had always sought death, but not like this—not as a participant in something stranger, more compelling than oblivion. <words>201</words>  

The cavern shuddered. The ice sculpture let out a final, thunderous crack, and Lira’s bookmark flared white-hot. <words>217</words> In that serene upheaval, she felt the energy surge—a river of force flowing from the collapsing ice into the stone, into the bookmark, into her. <words>237</words> The hidden societies had wanted this: a catalyst, a sacrifice, a map. <words>250</words>  

Lira laughed, a sound swallowed by the waterfall’s fury. She’d always known her death wish would be repurposed. <words>267</words> The bookmark, now smoking, fused to the rock, its symbol etched deeper, a permanent mark. <words>280</words> Above, the ice sculpture crumbled into a thousand shards, each glinting like a star fallen to earth. <words>296</words>  

When the dust settled, the cavern was silent, save for the waterfall’s steady pulse. <words>311</words> Lira stepped back, her hands steady, her mind clearer than it had been in years. <words>324</words> The hidden societies had their map. She had her answer: death was not an end, but a language, and she’d finally learned to speak it. <words>347</words>  

The bookmark remained, a simple thing made strangely compelling by the energy it now held. <words>362</words> Lira turned, walking away from the ledge, her death wish replaced by something older, wilder—a need to trace the lines of power that connected the world above to the one below. <words>388</words> The waterfall sang behind her, a hymn to the unseen, as the cavern’s shadows stretched long and deep. <words>406</words>
