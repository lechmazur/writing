Between flights, the somnambulist scout always returned to the sunken laboratory, her family’s ancestral home buried deep in the woods. <words>19</words> Each year, she descended its moss-choked steps, lantern in hand, to map the spiritual wisdom etched into its crumbling walls. <words>33</words> Tonight, though, her focus was split: the laboratory’s secrets hummed in the air, but so did the flicker of her bottled lightning bug collection, glowing faintly in her satchel. <words>52</words>  

The scout was unapologetically humble, her reputation built not on grand proclamations but on the quiet precision of her work. <words>67</words> She moved through the lab’s corridors like a ghost, tracing symbols carved into stone by ancestors who’d studied the woodland’s pulse. <words>83</words> Tonight, the symbols felt… restless. As if the forest itself was awake, watching. <words>93</words>  

Her pilgrimage was ritualistic: cataloging shifts in the lab’s energy, noting how the roots of ancient trees had begun to fracture its foundation. <words>109</words> But this year, the lightning bugs pulsed in time with her heartbeat, their light casting shadows that danced like forgotten dances. <words>124</words> She paused, bottling another specimen—its glow sharper, almost *alive*—and tucked it beside the others. <words>136</words>  

The lab’s heart was a chamber flooded with murky water, where a single beam of moonlight pierced the ceiling. <words>149</words> Here, the scout knelt, her fingers brushing the surface. The water rippled, revealing a map of constellations only visible to those who dreamed while awake. <words>164</words> Her ancestors had called it *the Veil*, a threshold between worlds. She’d always suspected the lightning bugs were keys to it. <words>177</words>  

A low hum vibrated through the floor. The bugs’ glow intensified, illuminating a path she’d never seen before—a tunnel leading deeper into the earth. <words>192</words> Loaded curiosity prickled her neck. She followed, her boots squelching in mud, until the tunnel opened into a cavern filled with bioluminescent fungi. <words>207</words> The air tasted of copper and old magic. <words>213</words>  

At the cavern’s center stood a pedestal, its surface etched with the same symbols from the lab. <words>224</words> The scout placed her lantern down, and the lightning bugs swarmed the pedestal, their light merging into a single, blinding beam. <words>237</words> When it faded, a holographic projection hovered above: her grandmother, alive and smiling, reciting a chant to “bind the forest’s tongue.” <words>252</words>  

The scout’s breath hitched. This was the spiritual wisdom she’d sought—not in stones, but in blood and light. <words>264</words> The bugs’ glow dimmed, as if spent, but the pedestal held a new carving: a date, a decade from now. <words>277</words> A warning? A promise? She didn’t know. But she bottled the last fading bug, its light now the faintest blue. <words>290</words>  

As she climbed back to the surface, dawn tinged the sky. Her flight would leave in hours, but the weight of the bottle felt different now—like a pact. <words>305</words> The woods whispered behind her, their secrets no longer silent, but *waiting*. <words>315</words> She’d return next year, humble as ever, to listen. <words>322</words>
