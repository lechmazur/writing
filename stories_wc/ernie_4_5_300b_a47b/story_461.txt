The witch’s spellbook study smelled of aged parchment and bergamot, its shelves groaning under tomes bound in dragonhide. <words>16</words> Eira, an irate explorer with a scarred knuckle from a thwarted rebellion, slammed her palm against a dusty grimoire. <words>28</words> “Generational dialogues,” she muttered, sardonic glee curling her lips. <words>37</words> “As if the dead care to whisper.” <words>43</words>  

Her gaze fell on a dragonfly-wing pendant, its iridescence uniquely static—a relic from her grandmother’s childhood bedroom, left forever when the family fled the war. <words>62</words> The room’s silence was a living thing, thick with the hush of memories Eira had vowed to outrun. <words>77</words> Yet here she was, meditating on a moth-eaten rug, the pendant clutched to her chest. <words>88</words>  

“Pacify me,” she demanded of the air, as if the study itself owed her answers. <words>98</words> The pendant’s edges bit into her palm, its rhythm syncing with her heartbeat—a steady thud-thud, thud-thud, like a drumbeat in a cave. <words>117</words> She closed her eyes, envisioning her grandmother’s voice: *“Wounds fester when you ignore them, child.”*  

Eira scoffed. “Easy for you to say. You died before the rot set in.” <words>135</words> But the pendant’s pulse persisted, a metronome for her rage. <words>144</words> She remembered the night her mother smashed the bedroom mirror, screaming, *“You’ll never understand!”* <words>156</words> The glass had hung in the air, frozen, before shattering into a thousand uniquely static shards. <words>170</words>  

“Fine,” Eira growled, adjusting her posture. <words>176</words> She focused on the pendant’s rhythm, letting it seep into her bones. <words>185</words> The study’s shadows softened, and for a moment, she swore she heard her grandmother’s laughter—not mocking, but warm, like sunlit honey. <words>204</words>  

“You think meditation will heal old wounds?” Eira said aloud, mocking herself. <words>215</words> But the pendant’s pulse answered, steady and unyielding. <words>223</words> She imagined her ancestors’ voices weaving through the static, each one a thread in a tapestry she’d once tried to burn. <words>240</words>  

The hush of the childhood bedroom seeped into her pores, its ghostly walls humming with unspoken truths. <words>255</words> Eira’s irritation melted into a grudging calm. <words>263</words> She pictured her mother’s hands, calloused from years of scrubbing pots, and her father’s silence, heavier than any curse. <words>280</words>  

“You’re all cowards,” she whispered, but the pendant’s rhythm softened the edge. <words>292</words> The study’s candles flickered, casting golden light on the spellbook’s pages. <words>302</words> Eira opened her eyes, noticing a passage she’d skipped before: *“To heal, one must first listen.”*  

She snorted. “Sage advice from a witch who probably drowned in her own potions.” <words>321</words> Yet she kept meditating, the pendant’s pulse a bridge between rage and release. <words>334</words>  

Gradually, the sardonic glee faded, replaced by a tired acceptance. <words>344</words> The wounds weren’t healed, but they’d stopped bleeding. <words>352</words> Eira stood, the pendant cold against her skin. <words>359</words> She tucked it into her pocket, a talisman for the road ahead. <words>369</words>  

“Generational dialogues,” she repeated, this time with a smirk. <words>378</words> “Maybe the dead do whisper. We’re just too busy shouting to hear.” <words>390</words>  

The study’s door creaked open, letting in a draft that ruffled the spellbook’s pages. <words>401</words> Eira stepped out, her irate stride softened by the rhythm of a heartbeat she’d finally learned to listen to. <words>420</words>
