After the waves recede from a deserted shore, the caravan repair station stands silent, its rusted gears and sun-bleached tarps humming with the ghosts of travelers. <words>22</words> Kael, the fading caretaker, lingers in the shadow of a half-collapsed archway, methodically random in his movements—one moment polishing a gear’s teeth, the next humming a tuneless hymn. <words>41</words> His pockets bulge with a dried lavender bundle, its petals crumbling like forgotten promises, yet he clutches it as if it were a key to the stars. <words>60</words>  

The allure of the forbidden thrums in his veins, a fever he’s nursed since the archives called to him. <words>72</words> Last night, by the flicker of a gas lamp, he’d hacked into the station’s ancient databases, fingers dancing across keys like a pianist possessed. <words>89</words> The screens spat forth fragmented lore: a forgotten caravan route, a vault buried beneath the dunes, and a warning scrawled in dead tongues—*“Cradle the unknown, and it will gorge on your soul.”* <words>113</words>  

“Cradle it,” Kael mutters, enthusiastic apathy coloring his voice. <words>122</words> Why not? The station’s owners abandoned it decades ago, leaving him to stitch its wounds like a surgeon of scrap. <words>137</words> He’s already outlived his purpose; what’s one more gamble? <words>148</words>  

The lavender bundle trembles in his grip as he navigates the station’s bowels, past cogs frozen mid-turn and engines still whispering of past voyages. <words>166</words> His methodical randomness guides him—left at a corroded junction, right past a shattered map, until he finds the hatch hidden beneath a floor grate. <words>184</words> It opens with a groan, revealing a tunnel choked with sand and the faint scent of ozone. <words>197</words>  

Inside, the archives loom: towering servers wrapped in vines, their data streams glowing like sickly veins. <words>212</words> Kael plugs in his jury-rigged decoder, and the walls shudder, projecting holograms of caravans that sailed the sands like ghost ships. <words>230</words> “There,” he breathes, as a schematic flickers—a vault door, its lock a labyrinth of shifting symbols. <words>245</words>  

He feeds the lavender into a slot (why?), and the symbols rearrange into a pattern he recognizes from his mother’s lullabies. <words>262</words> The door hisses open, revealing a chamber where time itself seems to liquefy. <words>274</words> At its center floats the unknown: a swirling mass of light and shadow, pulsating like a newborn galaxy. <words>290</words>  

Kael reaches out, not with fear but a greedy tenderness. <words>299</words> “I’ll cradle you,” he vows, and the thing surges forward, devouring his hand in a gorge of light. <words>314</words> Pain? Pleasure? He can’t tell. <words>321</words> The lavender bundle disintegrates, its essence fueling the vortex. <words>332</words>  

When it recedes, Kael slumps against the wall, his arm now translucent, flickering like a dying star. <words>347</words> Yet he smiles. <words>350</words> The unknown thrums inside him, a wild, chaotic symphony. <words>360</words> He’s no longer fading—he’s *unraveling*, and it’s glorious. <words>371</words>  

Back in the station, the gears resume their slow, mournful turn. <words>382</words> Somewhere, a door creaks open, and sand begins to pour in. <words>393</words> Kael doesn’t notice. <words>398</words> He’s too busy humming, methodically random, as the galaxy in his chest prepares to gorge on the world. <words>414</words>
