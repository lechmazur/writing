The sneering envoy stepped through the domed vineyard’s crumbling archway, his boots crunching on glass-strewn gravel, the barren alien plain stretching endlessly beyond. <words>23</words> Across the hush of a possibility just born, he felt the weight of his mission: to cup starlight in mortal palms, to prove that even here, life could be twisted into submission. <words>48</words> His furiously tranquil demeanor masked the storm beneath—a man who sifted through chaos with the precision of a scalpel, yet whose hands trembled with hunger. <words>69</words>

The greenhouse at the vineyard’s heart was a relic, its domed glass fogged with neglect, vines clawing at the frames like skeletal fingers. <words>86</words> Inside, the air hummed with the scent of decay and something sharper, metallic, as if the soil itself resisted his presence. <words>103</words> He knelt, ignoring the prick of thorns, and began to sift through the swirling leaves, their edges curled and brown, the motion stirring dust into golden eddies. <words>127</words>

A folded note, brittle as insect wings, fluttered from the debris. <words>138</words> He caught it, his sneer softening for a heartbeat. The paper trail here was fragile, a map of secrets etched in faint ink. <words>154</words> *“They drink the light,”* it read, the script uneven, as if written by a hand shaking with fear or fervor. <words>168</words> *“The vines are not vines. The soil is not soil. You will not survive the harvest.”* <words>183</words>

The envoy’s lips curled. Rambling destiny, he thought, crushing the note. Let the warnings come. His purpose was clearer than the dome’s fractured sky: to bend this place to his will, to harvest not grapes but power. <words>210</words> Yet as he stood, the leaves swirled anew, and he froze. Beneath the rot, something pulsed—a faint, violet glow, seeping from the cracks in the earth. <words>230</words>

He sifted again, deeper this time, his fingers brushing a root that shuddered at his touch. <words>244</words> The glow intensified, casting his shadow tall and jagged against the glass. <words>256</words> This was no ordinary vineyard. The paper trail had led him here, but the truth was stranger, hungrier. <words>271</words>

The envoy laughed, a sound like shattered glass. Let the galaxy tremble. He would cup the starlight, drink its essence, and reshape destiny itself. <words>293</words> The leaves danced around him, wild and mocking, as he pressed his palm to the soil. <words>305</words> The vines recoiled, then surged, their tendrils wrapping his wrists, pulling him closer. <words>317</words>

Furiously tranquil, he did not resist. The note’s warning echoed, but so did his ambition. <words>330</words> Across the hush of this newborn possibility, he understood: the paper trails were not warnings. They were invitations. <words>347</words> And he, the sneering envoy, had always been destined to answer. <words>360</words>
