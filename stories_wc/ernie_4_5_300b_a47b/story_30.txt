The navigation room of the *Void Dancer* hummed with static electricity, its walls plastered with star charts and the fragment of a medieval tapestry showing dragons—a relic Kael had stolen from a museum on Mars. <words>27</words> He rolled telekinetically levitated dice across the console, their faces glowing with latent flame as he calculated hyperspace coordinates amid whispered secrets about the ship’s next heist. <words>57</words> His reputation as a high-stakes gambler was built on luck, but his real power lay in bending probability, a skill he’d honed since childhood. <words>81</words>  

“You’re risking the crew’s lives again,” muttered Jara, the ship’s engineer, her voice edged with philosophically practical skepticism. <words>102</words> She adjusted a dial, the room’s sacred disorder of wires and holograms flickering. <words>116</words> Kael didn’t look up. “Farming methods die if we don’t adapt,” he said, referencing the family tradition of planting a tree for each new member—a ritual his mother had insisted on, even in the void. <words>146</words>  

The dice clattered to a stop, showing a double six. Kael grinned. “See? The dragons approve.” He gestured to the tapestry, its threads weaving a lost language only he could decipher. <words>178</words> Years ago, he’d discovered that the symbols matched sonic frequencies capable of igniting plasma. <words>193</words> Now, he used them to fuel the ship’s engines, a blasphemous fusion of ancient art and modern tech. <words>212</words>  

Jara slammed a wrench down. “Your ‘traditions’ nearly got us killed last time.” <words>227</words> Kael’s smile faded. He’d planted a tree for his late sister in the hydroponic bay, a sapling now thriving despite the crew’s doubts. <words>250</words> “Preserving farming methods isn’t just about soil,” he said, tapping the tapestry. “It’s about remembering where we came from.” <words>272</words>  

A klaxon blared. The ship lurched as pirates boarded. Kael’s dice flared, their flame engulfing the console. <words>291</words> “Time to gamble,” he murmured, channeling the tapestry’s lost language into a sonic burst. <words>308</words> The navigation room erupted in chaos, but the dragons’ image held, its threads glowing like embers. <words>325</words>  

Jara grabbed his arm. “This isn’t a game!” <words>334</words> “Isn’t it?” Kael replied, hurling the dice into the fray. They exploded, scattering intruders like ash. <words>353</words>  

Later, as the crew mopped up, Kael watered the sapling. Its leaves shimmered, a silent testament to survival. <words>375</words> Jara joined him, handing him a seed. “For the next tree,” she said, grudgingly. <words>390</words> He nodded, tucking it into the soil. The tapestry’s dragons watched, their lost language a bridge between past and present. <words>412</words>  

In the sacred disorder of the navigation room, Kael rolled the dice again. This time, they showed a single, steady flame. <words>431</words>
