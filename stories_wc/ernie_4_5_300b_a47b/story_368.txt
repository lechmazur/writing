The lost orchard temple clung to the hillside like a secret, its fruit-laden vines draping stone walls that hummed with forgotten hymns. <words>18</words> Jessa, a streetwise orphan with calloused hands and eyes sharp as flint, slipped through the iron gates at dawn, her boots crunching gravel that glittered with mica. <words>38</words> She’d tracked rumors here—a relic said to “harvest hope from darkness”—but the temple’s silence felt less like sanctuary and more like a held breath. <words>59</words>  

Inside, the air thickened with the scent of overripe peaches and decay. <words>71</words> Vines twisted into shapes theoretically random yet eerily deliberate, their thorns snagging her threadbare coat. <words>89</words> Jessa’s fingers brushed a stone pedestal, and the cursed cameo brooch there shuddered, its porcelain face flickering between a woman’s serene smile and a skull’s grin. <words>112</words> A distant echo resounded—not sound, but a *feeling*, like a memory trying to claw free from her ribs. <words>129</words>  

She’d stolen the brooch weeks ago, lured by whispers of its power, but now it pulsed in her palm, hot and alive. <words>147</words> The temple’s shadows stretched, reversing patterns: light seeped into cracks, while darkness pooled where sunlight should’ve fallen. <words>164</words> Jessa grinned, her confidence fraying at the edges. <words>173</words> “Contrast,” she muttered, recalling the old beggar’s riddle—*through reversed patterns, truth is found*. <words>188</words>  

The brooch’s echo grew louder, a chorus of voices pleading, *“Take it. Break it. Choose.”* <words>203</words> Jessa’s throat tightened. <words>207</words> She’d survived by stealing, lying, vanishing—but this? This felt like a test. <words>223</words> The orchard’s fruit glowed faintly, as if charged by her doubt. <words>234</words>  

Time blurred. <words>238</words> Across an unwritten calendar, seasons might’ve passed, but Jessa’s mind raced. <words>252</words> The brooch’s curse wasn’t malice—it was a mirror. <words>261</words> She saw her life: a mosaic of stolen moments, each shard sharp enough to draw blood. <words>277</words> The echo wasn’t distant anymore. <words>285</words> It was her own voice, years ago, whispering, *“I won’t end up like them.”* <words>299</words>  

Reversed patterns. <words>304</words> Hope from darkness. <words>309</words> Jessa pressed the brooch to the pedestal, its edges biting her skin. <words>322</words> The temple shuddered; vines retracted, revealing a path. <words>335</words> Sunlight spilled in, ordinary and bright, and the echo faded into a sigh. <words>350</words>  

She left the brooch behind. <words>356</words> The orchard’s fruit tasted sweeter now, juices running down her chin. <words>370</words> Jessa laughed, a sound raw and unfamiliar. <words>379</words> The temple hadn’t given her answers—it had given her a choice. <words>393</words>  

Confident uncertainty. <words>398</words> She walked away, not looking back. <words>407</words> The brooch’s curse remained, but so did she: unbroken, unchained, a girl who’d finally learned to harvest her own light. <words>431</words>  

Years later, travelers would swear the temple’s vines bore a new pattern—a spiral, tight and unyielding, like a fist holding a star. <words>456</words> Jessa never confirmed it. <words>462</words> She had better things to do: steal bread, mend coats, and whisper to lost kids, *“Echoes are just promises waiting to be rewritten.”* <words>494</words>
