Beneath the glass-domed ceiling of the underwater city planning office, where bioluminescent algae painted the walls in shifting blues, I, the meek blacksmith, hunched over my desk. <words>21</words> My hammer lay dormant beside a softcover dictionary, its pages dog-eared from decades of use—a relic from the surface world I’d traded my first anvil for. <words>40</words> The unfinished bargain hung between us, a pact forged in saltwater and silence: *I would ignite the city’s heart if I could harness heartbreak as fuel*. <words>62</words>

The office hummed with the openly hidden ache of progress. Engineers designed coral-reinforced arches while architects debated tidal-proof foundations, all unaware that the city’s core—a crystalline reactor—had stalled. <words>88</words> Its failure meant dissolution, the city unraveling into the abyss. My role was to restart it, but the reactor demanded a paradox: fuel forged from sorrow, a substance I’d spent years gathering through stories. <words>116</words>

Hitchhikers drifted through the office, their tales half-baked and desperate. A mermaid mourned a lover lost to a current; a human diver recounted a sunken ship’s ghostly crew. <words>137</words> I listened, verifying their pain by cross-referencing their words with the dictionary’s definitions, as if language itself could quantify grief. <words>153</words> Each verified story became a thread, woven into a tapestry of luminous regret that pulsed in my chest. <words>169</words>

Across the hush of time’s final ripple, the reactor’s light dimmed. The city’s inhabitants began to forget their own names, their memories dissolving like sugar in tea. <words>192</words> I worked faster, igniting threads of heartbreak into fuel, the dictionary’s pages glowing as if dipped in starlight. Yet the bargain remained unfinished—the reactor needed more, a critical mass of sorrow I couldn’t reach alone. <words>220</words>

One night, a hitchhiker arrived with a story so raw it bled ink. A surface-dweller who’d lost her child to the tides, her words crumbled the dictionary’s spine. <words>243</words> As I verified her grief, the reactor flared, its core swallowing the pain like a black hole. The city shuddered, then stabilized, its arches gleaming anew. <words>264</words>

But the cost was clear: the reactor’s hunger was insatiable. To sustain it, I’d have to become a keeper of heartbreak, a role that would drown me in others’ sorrow. <words>288</words> The meek blacksmith, once content to forge nails and hinges, now wielded stories as fuel. The dictionary, now a tomb of verified tragedies, lay heavy in my hands. <words>310</words>

In the end, the city thrived, its light a mosaic of shared grief. I remained in the planning office, listening, verifying, igniting. The unfinished bargain was complete, yet the price lingered—a luminous regret that outshone the reactor’s glow. <words>344</words> And somewhere in the depths, the dictionary whispered back, its pages a testament to the fuel of broken hearts. <words>360</words>
