The thin-lipped warlock, Alaric, stood before the rusted iron gates of the abandoned mine, his formally casual attire—a crisp waistcoat over a frayed shirt—contrasting with the grime of the entrance. <words>27</words>
When the final calendar page of the year flipped at midnight, the air hummed with a charge only he could feel, a signal that the forgotten library deep within the mine would reveal itself. <words>54</words>
He’d spent decades chasing lost artifacts, but this—a fragment of a viking ship figurehead rumored to grant its wielder dominion over storms—was the key to optimizing his power, a way to bypass the fragile limits of his mortal shell. <words>76</words>
The mine’s tunnels twisted like a labyrinth, but Alaric followed the faint glow of discredited textbooks he’d hoarded, their pages scribbled with cures for ailments even death couldn’t claim. <words>57</words>
Confusing certainty pulsed in his veins; the texts insisted the fragment lay here, though scholars had dismissed them as madman’s ravings. <words>31</words>
At last, he stumbled into a cavernous chamber, its walls lined with tomes so ancient their spines crumbled at his touch. <words>28</words>
In the center, half-buried in debris, stood the figurehead fragment—a carved wolf’s head, its eyes hollowed by time, yet radiating a cold, blue light. <words>34</words>
Alaric’s thin lips curled into a smile as he pried it loose, ignoring the whispers in the dark that warned of hubris. <words>28</words>
He’d gorged on the fruit of knowledge before, devouring forbidden grimoires to fuel his magic, and each time, the warnings had proven hollow. <words>35</words>
But as he clutched the fragment, the library’s air thickened, and the discredited textbooks began to rattle, their pages flipping wildly to passages he’d never noticed. <words>37</words>
The cures, he realized with a jolt, weren’t for the body—they were for the artifact itself, a ritual to “optimize” its power by sacrificing the user’s humanity. <words>33</words>
Alaric hesitated, his formally casual demeanor faltering. <words>10</words>
Yet the fragment’s light intensified, beckoning him with the promise of omnipotence. <words>14</words>
He recited the incantation from memory, his voice steady despite the confusion certainty now warring in his chest. <words>23</words>
The mine trembled, and the figurehead fragment dissolved into a swirling mist that seeped into his pores. <words>23</words>
For a moment, he felt invincible—then the ground gave way, and he plunged into darkness, the library’s shelves collapsing behind him. <words>28</words>
When dawn broke, the mine was silent, the fragment gone. <words>12</words>
Somewhere, a storm raged, its fury unnatural, its origin a thin-lipped warlock who’d traded his soul for a taste of the divine. <words>25</words>
