The found object museum’s dusty starlight filtered through cracked skylights, casting elongated shadows over displays of rusted tools and broken porcelain. <words>21</words> Amid the clatter of skateboarding wheels outside, Elara Voss adjusted her gloves, her fingers brushing the elegant rapier with a cracked hilt strapped to her thigh—a relic she’d “authenticated” from the museum’s vault last week. <words>45</words> She called herself a careful poisoner, but her true art was in the *innocently guilty* act of leaving trails no one would trace to her. <words>60</words>  

Today’s hunt began with a scavenger clue tucked beneath a display of 19th-century mousetraps: *“Gravity bends where the skater’s wheel meets the fractured hilt.”* Elara smiled. <words>77</words> The code of instinct told her to follow the skateboarders’ path, their reckless arcs a metaphor for her own experiments with fate. <words>92</words> She slipped the rapier into a display case beside a gear-laden contraption labeled *“Test the Edges of Gravity, 1893”*—a machine designed to hurl objects into the air, measuring their descent. <words>116</words>  

Outside, the skateboarders carved figure-eights around the museum’s obsidian fountain. <words>128</words> Elara watched from a window, her reflection merging with the glass’s grime. <words>136</words> She’d hidden the next clue inside a broken skateboard wheel, its axle taped to the fountain’s base. <words>148</words> *“To authenticate truth, let the cracked hilt dance where the wheel spins,”* read the note. <words>160</words> The skateboarders, unaware, kicked their boards into the air, their laughter echoing like wind chimes. <words>173</words>  

Elara retrieved the rapier, its hilt cracking further as she pressed it into the fountain’s mossy groove. <words>186</words> The water rippled, reflecting the starlight into fractured beams. <words>194</words> She’d engineered this: when the next skateboarder’s wheel struck the fountain’s edge, the rapier would pivot, its blade slicing a thread tied to a hidden lever. <words>212</words> The lever would release a drawer in the museum’s clock tower, revealing her final clue—and proof of her “innocence.” <words>226</words>  

The plan hinged on the skateboarders’ instinct to push limits. <words>233</words> As a boy named Jaxol landed a jump, his wheel struck the fountain. <words>241</words> The rapier spun, the thread snapped, and the clock tower’s drawer creaked open. <words>251</words> Inside lay a forged manifesto, its pages filled with cryptic equations about gravity and betrayal. <words>264</words> The museum’s curator would find it, assume a disgruntled physicist was to blame, and never suspect Elara. <words>277</words>  

She lingered in the dusty starlight, the rapier’s hilt now split in two. <words>286</words> The code of instinct had guided her: to test gravity’s edges was to test morality’s. <words>297</words> By framing her actions as a scavenger hunt, she’d authenticated her innocence while poisoning the truth. <words>309</words> The skateboarders rode on, unaware they’d been pawns in her game. <words>318</words>  

Elara exited through a side door, the rapier’s pieces tucked into her coat. <words>327</words> The museum’s security cameras would show nothing but a blur of motion—a skateboarder’s shadow, a flicker of starlight. <words>340</words> She’d already planted the next clue in a rival’s lab, ensuring the hunt would continue. <words>351</words> After all, a careful poisoner never lets the game end. <words>359</words>
