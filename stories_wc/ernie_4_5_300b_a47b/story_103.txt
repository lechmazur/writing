The weatherbeaten knight, Sir Alaric, stood before the brass door knocker shaped like a crab, its pincers open as if to snatch his resolve. <words>16</words>
He’d been imprisoned in the lighthouse for a decade, its tower a skeletal sentinel atop jagged reefs that devoured ships and souls alike. <words>28</words>
Tonight, the storm’s fury mirrored the tempest in his chest—a final cry of regret clawing at his throat. <words>21</words>
He’d been tasked with an impossible choice: silence the prisoner’s last scream or let it echo into eternity, dooming the realm. <words>25</words>
The knocker’s surface gleamed dully, a relic from a forgotten king, its brass warped by salt and time. <words>19</words>
Sir Alaric’s gauntleted hand hovered, trembling. Grudgingly sweet memories surfaced—his daughter’s laughter, her small fingers tracing the knocker’s curves years ago. <words>24</words>
He’d sworn to protect her, yet here he stood, a guardian of nothing but shadows. <words>14</words>
The door behind the knocker led to a cell where the prisoner, a sorcerer, awaited execution. <words>16</words>
But the sorcerer’s crime wasn’t murder—it was love, a forbidden bond with a mortal that had unraveled the fabric of reality. <words>21</words>
Sir Alaric’s duty was clear, yet the sorcerer’s final words haunted him: *“You’ll choose regret, too, one day.”* <words>20</words>
He glanced at the cell’s barred window. The storm’s reflection warped in the glass, showing not his face, but a set of seemingly random items: a rusted lantern, a frayed rope, a shattered hourglass. <words>30</words>
Patterns emerged in the chaos—the lantern’s flame flickering like a heartbeat, the rope coiled like a noose, the hourglass’s sand frozen mid-fall. <words>22</words>
Time itself had stalled, trapped within the mirrored reflection. <words>11</words>
Sir Alaric’s breath hitched. The items weren’t random. They were a map—a guide to defy fate. <words>17</words>
The lantern’s light could pierce the dark, the rope could bind the sorcerer’s magic, the hourglass could reset the moment. <words>21</words>
But using them meant betraying his oath, consigning the realm to ruin. <words>14</words>
He slammed his fist against the knocker. The crab’s pincers snapped shut, a sound like a coffin lid closing. <words>20</words>
“I appreciate the irony,” he muttered, grudgingly sweet as he recalled the sorcerer’s parting gift: a single brass key, hidden in the knocker’s mouth. <words>26</words>
The key fit the cell’s lock. Inside, the sorcerer smiled, his eyes reflecting the storm. <words>17</words>
“You’ve chosen,” the sorcerer said. “Now hush the final cry.” <words>14</words>
Sir Alaric hesitated, then acted. The lantern’s flame seared the sorcerer’s chains, the rope bound his wrists, the hourglass shattered—and time lurched forward. <words>26</words>
The sorcerer vanished, leaving only a whisper: *“Joyful agony.”* <words>13</words>
Sir Alaric collapsed, the weight of his choice crushing him. Yet in the mirror’s reflection, he saw his daughter’s face, her smile untouched by sorrow. <words>25</words>
He’d silenced the cry, but the cost? Immeasurable. <words>10</words>
The lighthouse door creaked open, revealing not the storm, but a sunrise painting the reefs gold. <words>19</words>
Sir Alaric stepped outside, the brass key cold in his palm. Some choices, he realized, were impossible to live with—yet impossible to regret. <words>24</words>
