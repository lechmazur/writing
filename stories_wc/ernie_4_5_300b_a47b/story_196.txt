The tired swordsman slumped against the stone wall of the floating rock monastery’s quiet breakroom, his plain cloth bag slung carelessly at his side. <words>19</words> Dust motes drifted in the slanting sunlight, settling on his worn armor like a silent reproach. <words>31</words> He’d come here to rest, not to think—yet the memory of his lieutenant’s resignation earlier that day lingered, sharp as a blade. <words>50</words>  
“You’re still here,” a voice rasped. The abbot, ancient and frail, leaned in the doorway, his eyes crinkling with knowing naivety. <words>65</words> The swordsman didn’t bother to look up. Fiercely apathetic, he’d long since mastered the art of ignoring what didn’t serve him. <words>81</words> But the abbot’s next words prickled his resolve. “The meteor showers begin tonight. They say the sky here… *speaks*.”  
The swordsman scoffed. Meteor showers were for poets, not men who’d buried three friends in the last moon cycle. <words>107</words> Yet his bag shifted, its contents—a crumpled map, a dried flower, a rusted locket—stirring like a conscience. <words>123</words> He’d promised himself, years ago, to find the “spark” the abbot once mentioned. A promise made in blood and shame, now buried under layers of exhaustion. <words>141</words>  
That night, he found himself on the monastery’s edge, staring at the void. Stars streaked like silver threads, weaving patterns only the desperate would interpret. <words>163</words> The abbot joined him, handing over a thermos of bitter tea. “You think defiance is a flame,” he said. “But sometimes, it’s just… *looking*.”  
The swordsman’s fist tightened. The locket in his bag—a relic from the war—suddenly burned against his thigh. <words>189</words> He’d carried it as a reminder of failure, not hope. Yet here, among the floating rocks and indifferent cosmos, something shifted. <words>207</words>  
When a meteor flared, brighter than the rest, he stood. “I’m leaving,” he said, not bothering to hide the defiance in his voice. <words>225</words> The abbot nodded, as if he’d expected this. “The showers point west. Follow them.”  
The journey was a blur of ache and resolve. The cloth bag grew heavier, its contents a mosaic of guilt and purpose. <words>249</words> By dawn, he reached a valley where the stars seemed to touch the earth. There, buried beneath a cairn, he found it: a stone etched with his name, left by his younger self. <words>276</words>  
The spark wasn’t a flame. It was the quiet choice to keep moving, to honor the promise even when apathy whispered it was pointless. <words>298</words> He smiled, a rare, tired thing, and turned toward the horizon. The monastery, the abbot, the war—all faded. Only the path remained, lit by stars and the ghost of a man who’d refused to surrender. <words>326</words>  
In the breakroom, the abbot sipped his tea, listening to the wind. Somewhere, a swordsman walked on, his bag lighter, his heart… *less heavy*. <words>348</words> The meteor showers had done their work. So had the quiet, stubborn spark of defiance. <words>365</words>
