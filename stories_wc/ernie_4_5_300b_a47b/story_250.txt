The forgotten library inside the deserted temple smelled of dust and forgotten oaths, its shelves sagging under the weight of centuries. <words>16</words> Jax, the blunt heretic, stood at the center, clutching a worn-out teddy bear—a relic from a childhood promise to “always find the truth.” <words>30</words> His fingers trembled as he stared at the outdated stock ticker mounted on the wall, its jumbled codes flickering like a fever dream. <words>45</words>  

At the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappeared—a single, cryptic symbol etched into a moss-covered stone—Jax knew the omniscient mind he’d sought for years had finally revealed itself. <words>63</words> “You’re here,” he muttered, enthusiasm warring with caution. <words>70</words> The teddy bear’s frayed ear brushed his wrist, a reminder of old promises: *find the answers, no matter the cost*. <words>84</words>  

The stock ticker’s numbers shifted, rearranging into coordinates that pointed to a hidden chamber. <words>94</words> Jax moved enthusiastically cautious, each step measured, as if the floor might collapse beneath him. <words>105</words> The temple’s silence amplified his heartbeat, a frantic drumbeat matching the anxiety in his chest. <words>116</words>  

In the chamber, a holographic figure materialized—the omniscient mind, a shimmering entity that spoke in riddles. <words>127</words> “You dare challenge me?” it intoned, voice echoing like a thousand whispers. <words>136</words> Jax gripped the teddy bear tighter. “I dare,” he said, bluntness cutting through the tension. <words>147</words>  

The battle began through the jumbled codes. The stock ticker spat out equations, logic puzzles, and historical references, each a weapon in the omniscient mind’s arsenal. <words>162</words> Jax decoded them furiously, his mind racing. <words>168</words> Sweat dripped down his temple, but he smiled—anxious elation fueling him. <words>177</words>  

“You think a child’s toy will save you?” the entity taunted, projecting images of Jax’s past failures. <words>188</words> He ignored it, focusing on the codes. <words>194</words> The teddy bear’s presence steadied him; it was a talisman, a vow kept. <words>203</words>  

As the final code clicked into place, the omniscient mind screamed, its form dissolving into static. <words>214</words> Jax collapsed, gasping, the teddy bear still clutched to his chest. <words>222</words> The chamber’s walls shuddered, revealing a pedestal with a single, glowing tome. <words>231</words>  

He approached, trembling. The tome’s pages flipped open, revealing truths he’d never dared imagine. <words>241</words> But as he reached for it, the temple began to crumble. <words>248</words> Jax hesitated—old promises or survival?—then grabbed the tome and ran. <words>257</words>  

Outside, dawn broke over the deserted temple. <words>263</words> Jax sat against a crumbling wall, the tome open in his lap. <words>270</words> The omniscient mind was gone, but its knowledge remained. <words>277</words> He traced the teddy bear’s stitching, smiling. <words>283</words>  

“Always find the truth,” he whispered, the anxious elation fading into quiet resolve. <words>293</words> The battle was won, but the journey—the real promise—had just begun. <words>302</words>
