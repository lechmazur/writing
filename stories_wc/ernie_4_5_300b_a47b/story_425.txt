The morose paladin, Sir Alaric, leaned against the solar flare observatory’s cold stone wall, his armor clinking like a funeral bell. <words>14</words> After the last star was named—a ceremony he’d skipped to brood here—the observatory’s lavishly austere halls echoed with the weight of his failure. <words>27</words> He’d sworn to restore ancient systems, a vow that now felt as hollow as the observatory’s shadowed domes. <words>38</words>  

A city-wide blackout plunged the building into darkness, erasing even the faint glow of emergency lights. <words>49</words> Sir Alaric’s hand instinctively went to his sword hilt, but his fingers brushed a dull sewing needle tucked into his belt—a relic from his mother, used to mend his cloak before battles. <words>66</words> “Pathetic,” he muttered, the word sharp in the silence. <words>71</words>  

A chance encounter changed that. A voice, trembling but defiant, cut through the dark: “You there! Help me confine this!” A young astronomer, Dr. Elara, shoved a rusted metal grate against a fissure in the observatory’s basement wall. <words>91</words> Solar flares had destabilized the structure, and the fissure pulsed with eerie, visible changes—a crack that grew wider by the second. <words>103</words>  

Sir Alaric hesitated. His duty was to protect, not repair. But the astronomer’s urgency sparked a bored excitement in him, a flicker of purpose. <words>117</words> “Why confine it?” he asked, gripping the grate. <words>121</words>  

“The ancient systems below are collapsing!” Elara shoved a toolkit at him. “If we don’t seal this, the observatory’s core will implode!” <words>133</words>  

Sir Alaric’s gaze fell on the sewing needle. Its dull point glinted faintly in the dark. <words>140</words> “Use this,” he said, handing it to her. “It’s… precise.” <words>146</words>  

Elara stared. “A *needle*?” <words>149</words>  

“A tool is a tool,” he said, shrugging. “And I’m out of holy symbols.” <words>158</words>  

Together, they worked. Elara used the needle to weave wire through the grate’s gaps, while Sir Alaric braced it with his gauntleted hands. <words>171</words> The fissure’s glow intensified, visible changes warping the air like heat haze. <words>180</words> His boredom melted into focus, his morose demeanor sharpening into resolve. <words>188</words>  

“Almost…” Elara grunted. The needle snapped. <words>193</words>  

Sir Alaric cursed, but Elara laughed—a bright, unexpected sound. “No matter! We’ve bought time!” <words>203</words>  

The blackout lifted. Lights flickered on, revealing the fissure sealed, the ancient systems humming safely below. <words>215</words> Sir Alaric stared at his hands, still trembling from the effort. <words>222</words>  

“You’re not what I expected,” Elara said, wiping grime from her face. <words>229</words>  

“And you’re not what I deserved,” he replied, the corner of his mouth twitching. <words>237</words>  

Later, he found the needle’s broken half in his pocket. He kept it, a reminder that even dull tools could mend what was broken. <words>250</words> The observatory’s lavishly austere halls still echoed, but now with the sound of his footsteps, lighter. <words>260</words>  

He’d restore the ancient systems, yes. But first, he’d learn to sew. <words>267</words>
