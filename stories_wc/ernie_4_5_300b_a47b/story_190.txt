The drought prediction center hummed with the sterile efficiency of a place that measured time in millimeters of rainfall, but Jax, a cautious smuggler with a knack for slipping through cracks in systems, lingered in the shadows of its observation deck. <words>30</words>
He clutched a pressed butterfly in his coat pocket, its wings a mosaic of iridescent blues—a relic from a job gone wrong, now a talisman. <words>52</words>
Tonight, he’d infiltrated the center not for data, but for a painter named Lira, whose delirious confessions under anesthesia had become the talk of the underground: she claimed to *predict* droughts through musical memories, humming melodies that mapped future aridity. <words>102</words>
Jax, meticulously impulsive, had spent weeks decoding her ramblings, convinced her art held the key to becoming a master of empathy—a skill he needed to outmaneuver rivals who valued bullets over understanding. <words>142</words>

The center’s director, Dr. Voss, paced behind a one-way mirror, muttering about “anomalous humidity patterns.” Jax smirked. *Enthusiastic apathy* was his default mode: he cared enough to scheme but detached enough to survive. <words>184</words>
Lira lay strapped to a gurney in the adjacent room, her face pale but eyes fierce. A nurse adjusted her IV, and Lira began to sing—a fragmented lullaby about rivers that “remembered their beds.” Jax’s pulse quickened. The butterfly’s wings trembled in his pocket. <words>226</words>

“She’s not just delirious,” Jax whispered to himself. “She’s *translating*.” He’d risked exposure to hear this: Lira’s music wasn’t random. It was a cipher, a bridge between her subconscious and the atmosphere. If he could decode it, he’d see droughts coming before they scarred the land—and sell that power to the highest bidder. <words>280</words>

But empathy? That was the real prize. Lira’s songs weren’t just predictions; they were *feelings*—grief for parched earth, hope for rain. Jax, who’d spent years numbing himself to survive, craved that clarity. To master empathy was to outthink, outmaneuver, out *live* everyone else. <words>322</words>

Dr. Voss burst into the observation deck. “Her vitals are spiking! The anesthesia’s wearing off—” Jax froze. If Lira woke, she’d clam up. He had minutes, maybe seconds, to extract the melody’s secret. <words>356</words>

He slipped into the room, pressing the butterfly into Lira’s palm. “Keep singing,” he urged. “For the rivers. For the memories.” Her eyes fluttered open, and she laughed—a sound like wind through dead leaves. “You think you can *steal* empathy?” she slurred. “It’s not a thing. It’s a *choice*.” <words>398</words>

Jax recoiled. But then Lira’s voice softened. “The droughts… they’re not just weather. They’re the land’s way of saying, *‘Feel this. Learn.’*” She hummed again, and this time, Jax felt it—a prickle behind his eyes, a hollow in his chest. For the first time in years, he *hurt*. And it was exhilarating. <words>444</words>

The alarm blared. Guards stormed in. Jax fled, the butterfly’s wings crumbling in his grip. He didn’t need Lira’s melodies anymore. He’d felt the drought’s pain—and in that moment, he understood: empathy wasn’t a master’s tool. It was the reason to master anything at all. <words>488</words>
