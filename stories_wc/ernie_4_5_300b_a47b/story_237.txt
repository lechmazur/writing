The psychic genealogist, Mara Voss, knelt in the space pirate ship’s brig, her fingers tracing the chipped edge of a single die. <words>14</words> Dawn bled through the porthole, staining the metal walls the color of old bruises—the last star fading into morning light. <words>27</words> Her mission was to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak, a task as cryptic as the diaries she’d salvaged from abandoned bullet trains, their pages yellowed and ink-smudged. <words>50</words>  

“Destiny’s a puzzle,” she muttered, proudly humble in her certainty that fate could be outwitted. <words>62</words> The other die lay lost, its twin’s chip a map to some hidden truth. <words>72</words> She’d found the pair in a pirate captain’s locker, nestled beside a journal that spoke of “the roll that broke the galaxy.” <words>89</words> The diaries, scattered across derelict trains, had lengthened her search, each entry a clue etched in grief or greed. <words>107</words>  

A guard snorted, his boots clanging against the grating. “Still at it, ghost-reader? Those dice won’t buy your freedom.” <words>124</words> Mara didn’t look up. The diaries had taught her to read between lines—a mother’s last entry, a smuggler’s confession, a lover’s farewell. <words>142</words> Each story wound through her like a thread, stitching together the tapestry of why she’d been imprisoned: her gift had exposed the captain’s lie about a “cursed treasure.” <words>164</words>  

She rolled the chipped die. It spun, clattered, settled on four. <words>173</words> “Four,” she said aloud, “means the diary of a soldier who traded his soul for a star map.” <words>188</words> The guard shifted, uneasy. Mara’s tone was grave playfulness, a paradox that unsettled pirates. <words>203</words> She opened the captain’s journal, its pages fluttering like wings. “Here,” she said, pointing to a sketch of a constellation. “This matches the soldier’s map. The treasure’s a lie—but the *truth*… that’s what breaks hearts.” <words>232</words>  

The ship shuddered, engines groaning. Mara’s mind raced. The diaries had lengthened her understanding: destiny wasn’t a cage but a labyrinth, each turn a choice. <words>253</words> She’d used the trains’ diaries to trace the dice’s origin—a gambler who’d bet his life on a roll, then vanished. <words>270</words> The chip was no flaw; it was a signature, a clue left by a man who’d known too much. <words>285</words>  

“The captain’s afraid,” Mara said, standing. “Afraid the dice will reveal his theft of the soldier’s map.” <words>299</words> The guard palmed his blaster. “And?” <words>305</words> She smiled, proudly humble. “And I’m going to roll again. This time, for keeps.” <words>321</words> The die tumbled, landed on two. “Two,” she said, “is the diary of a thief who stole a kiss from fate.” <words>339</words>  

The alarm bells shrieked. Mara pressed the die into the guard’s hand. “Tell your captain: the puzzle’s solved. The treasure’s a myth, but the map… it leads to a place where heartbreak can be undone.” <words>370</words> He frowned, but she’d already slipped the journal into her coat. The last star was gone; morning light flooded the brig. <words>389</words>  

As she was dragged away, Mara whispered, “Destiny’s a gamble, but even chipped dice can roll a seven.” <words>406</words> The guard stared at the die in his palm. Somewhere, a bullet train’s ghost smiled. <words>420</words>
