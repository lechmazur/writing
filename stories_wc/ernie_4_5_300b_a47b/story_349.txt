The drone pilot’s fingers trembled as he adjusted the cracked visor of his VR headset, the abandoned observatory’s dusty dome humming like a dyspneic beast above him. <words>19</words>  
He’d crash-landed here three days ago, his tech flickering between worlds, and now the cliff’s edge seemed to mock his cynically hopeful creed: *Horizons of mercy exist only where you carve them.* <words>37</words>  
A dried herb bundle, its lavender and sage still clinging to the scent of a realm he’d once called home, lay crumpled in his pocket—a relic from a lover who’d said, *“Smoke this when the void feels too close.”* <words>63</words>  
The hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down pressed in, a silence so thick it tasted of iron and regret. <words>78</words>  
He’d come to the observatory’s speed dating event (a absurdity, given the lack of drones or Wi-Fi) to disseminate lies, to trade hollow smiles for fragments of connection. <words>100</words>  
But when the door creaked open, revealing a woman in a moth-eaten cloak clutching a star chart, his cynicism faltered. <words>118</words>  
“You’re late,” she said, her voice like wind through a fractured flute. “The trees begin their fall at midnight.” <words>134</words>  
He lit the herb bundle, its smoke curling into the observatory’s fractured lenses, and told her of horizons that bent like light through prism glass. <words>155</words>  
She laughed, a sound like shattered porcelain. “You think mercy’s a compass? It’s a knife. We carve it into the dark.” <words>177</words>  
Her fingers brushed his wrist, and for a moment, the charred serenity of the room softened—a horizon where despair might yet bloom. <words>198</words>  
“The orchard’s owner believes cutting the trees will purge the realm of ‘weakness,’” she said. “But I’ve seen the roots. They grip the cliff like veins.” <words>220</words>  
He hesitated, then offered the herb bundle. “Smoke this. Let the smoke be your mercy.” <words>235</words>  
She inhaled, and her eyes widened. “It… tastes of home.” <words>245</words>  
“Mine too,” he admitted. “Before the drones. Before the worlds bled together.” <words>260</words>  
The observatory’s clocks chimed, a discordant symphony. Midnight. <words>271</words>  
Outside, axes glinted in the moonlight. The trees shuddered, their leaves whispering a language he almost understood. <words>289</words>  
“We have to stop them,” he said, not cynically, not hopeful—just *determined*. <words>303</words>  
She nodded, gripping his hand. “Then we’ll carve our mercy into the axe blades.” <words>318</words>  
They ran, the herb bundle’s smoke trailing behind them like a ghostly banner, its scent a bridge between worlds. <words>336</words>  
The orchard’s owner sneered as they approached. “You’ll die with the trees, fools.” <words>351</words>  
The pilot smiled, a cynically hopeful curve. “Not today.” <words>362</words>  
He disseminated the herb smoke into the air, its tendrils wrapping the axes, slowing the blades. <words>379</words>  
The woman chanted, her voice merging with the trees’ whispers, and the cliff held. <words>393</words>  
In the end, the axes fell silent. The orchard remained, its roots a testament to horizons carved not by steel, but by mercy. <words>415</words>  
The pilot kept the herb bundle, its ashes a reminder: even in the hush before destruction, possibility could be lured from the brink. <words>437</words>
