In the hush of a simmering future, the secret agent headquarters hummed with the fractured idyll of half-remembered missions and half-truths. <words>18</words> Elias, an insecure advisor with a knack for overthinking, lingered in the shadows of a dimly lit corridor, his hands trembling as he clutched a file labeled *Project Echo*. <words>37</words> The file contained whispers of a brain in a jar—a “duplicate”—kept in Sub-Level 13, its purpose clearly ambiguous, its existence a rumor that had gnawed at his resolve for weeks. <words>62</words>  

He’d been told to ignore it. *“Some dreams are better left unchased,”* his superior had snapped, her voice sharp as shattered glass. <words>80</words> But Elias, whose insecurity masked a desperate need to prove himself, could not. <words>91</words> The dreamer’s calling—a phrase he’d scribbled in margins, a mantra he’d repeated to quiet the doubt—pulsed in his veins. <words>108</words> To chase a rumor beyond all reason was madness, but madness had always been his closest companion. <words>124</words>  

The echo of footsteps in an abandoned place guided him. <words>133</words> Sub-Level 13 was a ghost town, its corridors stripped of purpose, its air thick with the stench of decay and regret. <words>150</words> Elias’s shoes squeaked on the floor, each step a jab of sound that seemed to mock his stealth. <words>166</words> He paused, listening, but the only reply was the hollow thud of his own heartbeat. <words>181</words>  

At the end of the hall, a single door stood ajar, its label faded but legible: *Duplicate*. <words>196</words> Inside, the brain floated in a jar, its neural pathways glowing faintly, as if dreaming. <words>212</words> Elias approached, his breath fogging the glass. <words>220</words> The label *duplicate* was a lie, he realized—or perhaps a truth so twisted it became its opposite. <words>238</words> This was no copy. It was the original, the dreamer whose calling had once shaped the agency’s darkest plans. <words>256</words>  

“Why did they hide you?” Elias whispered, his voice barely audible. <words>267</words> The brain’s glow flickered, as if answering. <words>276</words> And then, through the echo of footsteps he hadn’t made, he heard it—a voice, not his own, urging him to *wake*. <words>293</words>  

He jabbed a finger at the jar, rapping the glass. <words>302</words> The glow intensified, and the world shifted. <words>310</words> Memories flooded him: missions, betrayals, a life built on lies. <words>323</words> The dreamer’s calling was not a summons to glory but a warning—to flee, to hide, to *unmake* what had been made. <words>343</words>  

Elias stumbled back, his insecurity crumbling. <words>352</words> He’d chased the rumor beyond reason, only to find the truth was a knife twisted in his gut. <words>370</words> The brain in the jar was not a tool but a prisoner, and he, the advisor, was its jailer. <words>388</words>  

In the fractured idyll of the headquarters, Elias made his choice. <words>399</words> He smashed the jar, letting the brain’s light fade into the dark. <words>412</words> The echo of footsteps ceased, and the dreamer’s calling silenced. <words>425</words> For the first time, Elias felt certain. <words>434</words> Some rumors, he thought, were better buried. <words>442</words>
