Between innings of the meteor shower’s peak, the shooting star tracking station hummed with anticipation, its domed ceiling flickering with constellations projected by an outdated overhead projector. <words>28</words>
In the center of the control room stood Lysander, an unruly alchemist with ink-stained fingers and a lab coat buttoned haphazardly, his boots scuffing the floor as he paced. <words>53</words>
He clutched a magnifying glass with a cracked lens, its jagged edge catching the projector’s light like a spiderweb of fractured rainbows. <words>44</words>
“The sky isn’t just a ceiling,” he declared, his voice hauntingly cheerful, as if the very idea of cosmic indifference amused him. <words>45</words>
The station’s crew—skeptical astronomers in crisp uniforms—rolled their eyes, their cynicism as thick as the dust on the projector’s carousel. <words>41</words>
Lysander grinned, adjusting the projector’s focus until the constellations warped into whimsical shapes: a teapot pouring stardust, a rabbit chasing its own tail. <words>44</words>
“Behold,” he said, holding the magnifying glass to the lens, “the *touched sky*—where logic frays and wonder clings.” <words>37</words>
The projector whirred, its hum vibrating through the room like a lullaby, and the cracked glass distorted the stars into a kaleidoscope of gold and violet. <words>45</words>
A junior astronomer, Clara, leaned forward, her usual scowl softening. “That’s… not how light works.” <words>26</words>
“Exactly!” Lysander crowed, twirling the magnifying glass. “Science is a language, but wonder’s the accent we forget to use.” <words>38</words>
He pointed to a smudge on the dome where the projector’s beam met the ceiling. “See that? A shooting star’s ghost. It’s been looping here since 1987.” <words>42</words>
The crew murmured, their skepticism wavering. The projector’s hum deepened, resonating in their chests like a second heartbeat. <words>33</words>
Lysander pressed the magnifying glass to Clara’s palm. “Hold this. Tell me what you feel.” <words>23</words>
She hesitated, then peered through the crack. The stars swirled, and for a moment, she swore she heard a faint, melodic chime—a sound no instrument could replicate. <words>42</words>
“Infinite caution,” Lysander whispered, as if reading her mind. “The sky’s a fragile thing. Treat it gently, and it’ll impress you back.” <words>39</words>
The projector’s light dimmed, and the real meteor shower began, streaks of silver piercing the dark. <words>25</words>
Clara gasped. One star split into three, its tail flickering like a conductor’s baton. <words>21</words>
The crew laughed, their cynicism dissolving into gasps and applause. Lysander bowed, his lab coat flapping. <words>25</words>
“Disarmed,” he said, “by playful wonder.” <words>13</words>
As the innning ended, the projector’s hum faded, but the magnifying glass remained on Clara’s desk, its crack gleaming like a secret. <words>34</words>
Later, she’d swear the stars moved differently—not with cold precision, but with the shy, staggered grace of something alive. <words>33</words>
Lysander, meanwhile, was already tinkering with the projector, humming a tuneless melody. The sky, he knew, was a stage, and he’d spend every intermission coaching it to shine. <words>47</words>
