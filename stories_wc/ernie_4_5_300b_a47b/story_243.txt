The jumpy necromancer, Zib, twitched at every shadow in the pixelated alleys of Vexel City, a retro video game world where neon signs flickered like dying stars. <words>23</words> While the old gods slumbered in their digital slumber, Zib’s skeletal hands trembled around a fishhook that glowed faintly in the moonlight—a relic rumored to pierce lies. <words>45</words> The hook’s glow pulsed in time with the echoing footsteps that haunted Zib, footsteps that multiplied with each corner turned, as if the city itself were alive. <words>67</words>  

Zib’s mission was typically bizarre: to unmask the revered icon, the Pixel Sage, whose holographic sermons had united the fractured citizenry. <words>85</words> But Zib suspected the Sage’s wisdom was a glitch, a lie perpetuated by the system. <words>97</words> The necromancer’s faltering resolve stemmed from analyzing the paint drips on a hidden protest mural behind the arcade’s broken *Galactic Invaders* machine. <words>119</words> The drips formed a pattern—a code—that hinted the Sage’s “divine” visions were stolen from a forgotten subroutine. <words>134</words>  

“The footsteps… they’re not following,” Zib muttered, sweat dripping onto the fishhook. <words>147</words> The echoes grew louder, but their rhythm fractured, as if the city’s code was corrupting. <words>160</words> Zib’s jumpsuit, patched with glowing runes, flared as the hook’s light intensified, casting jagged shadows on the mural. <words>176</words> The paint drips revealed coordinates to the Sage’s server core, hidden beneath the neon-lit temple. <words>190</words>  

As Zib crept toward the temple, the footsteps synchronized into a single, thunderous beat. <words>204</words> The necromancer’s knees buckled; the hook’s glow revealed fissures in the pavement—cracks in reality. <words>220</words> “The Sage isn’t just a program… it’s a *virus*,” Zib hissed, recalling the mural’s warning: *“Truth decays where pixels pray.”* <words>239</words>  

Inside the temple, the Sage’s hologram flickered, its voice a static-laced hum. <words>252</words> Zib raised the fishhook, and the room erupted in a cascade of glitching light. <words>265</words> The echoing footsteps peaked, then silenced as the Sage’s form dissolved into a swarm of pixelated moths. <words>283</words> The hook’s glow faded, revealing a single line of code etched into the altar: *“UNMASKING REQUIRES SACRIFICE.”* <words>300</words>  

Zib’s hands shook. The necromancer had expected a battle, not a revelation. <words>314</words> The mural’s drips had been a map, but the true test was interpreting them—a puzzle only a jumpy, analytically paranoid mind could solve. <words>334</words> As the old gods stirred in their slumber, Zib realized the Sage’s unmasking wasn’t an end, but a beginning. <words>350</words> The city’s echoes returned, softer now, as if the system itself exhaled. <words>364</words>  

The necromancer exited the temple, the fishhook now dull, its purpose fulfilled. <words>378</words> Vexel City’s alleys still twitched with shadows, but Zib walked steadier, the echoes a comforting rhythm. <words>395</words> The Sage was gone, but the code remained—a labyrinth for another day. <words>410</words> And somewhere, a new mural dripped, waiting for the next jumpy soul to decode its secrets. <words>428</words>  

Zib smiled, a rare, calm expression. The retro world was still bizarre, still broken, but now, at least, it was *real*. <words>446</words> The necromancer pocketed the hook, its glow a faint memory, and vanished into the pixelated night, footsteps echoing long after the doors closed. <words>468</words>
