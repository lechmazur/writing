In the emergency time machine garage beneath the town’s crumbling clocktower, Elara, the small-town baker, pressed a withered flower into her ledger, its petals crumbling like old secrets. <words>21</words> The garage hummed with the scent of ozone and rust, its walls lined with clocks stopped at midnight—the hour shadows learn to speak. <words>42</words> Elara’s hands, flour-dusted and steady, traced the moon’s phase through a cracked skylight; tonight, it waxed gibbous, a sign her calculations were precise. <words>65</words>  

“You’ll exceed the tyrant’s expectations,” she muttered, her voice cynically gentle, as if coaxing a stubborn dough to rise. <words>82</words> The tyrant, Mayor Voss, had outlawed pressed flowers, claiming their “unnatural beauty” corrupted the town’s “purity.” <words>98</words> But Elara knew better: the flowers carried seeds of contagion, not of disease, but of rebellion. <words>114</words>  

She adjusted the time machine’s dials, its gears groaning like a beast awakening. <words>127</words> The method was lunar—by tracking moon patterns, she’d pinpointed the moment shadows gained voice, a mystical reality only she understood. <words>147</words> Tonight, the shadows would whisper coordinates to the past, where Voss’s rise began. <words>162</words>  

Elara’s motivation simmered like her ovens: to dethrone Voss by planting doubt in his younger self. <words>178</words> She slid the pressed flower into the machine’s chamber, its pollen glowing faintly. <words>192</words> “Contagion requires a host,” she said, recalling Voss’s first edict against her bakery. <words>206</words> He’d called her bread “a vector for dissent.” She’d laughed then, but now, her laughter was a quiet storm. <words>223</words>  

The machine whirred to life, casting elongated shadows that twisted into glyphs. <words>236</words> Elara stepped inside, her apron still smudged with raspberry jam. <words>249</words> As the world dissolved into streaks of silver, she wondered if the past’s Voss would feel the seeds take root—a prickle in his throat, a flicker of doubt. <words>270</words>  

She materialized in a cobblestone square, the air thick with the scent of wet hay. <words>283</words> Young Voss stood atop a haycart, rallying a crowd with fiery rhetoric. <words>297</words> Elara approached, offering a loaf of bread. “Try this,” she said, pressing the flower into his palm. <words>312</words> He frowned but bit into the bread. <words>318</words> The seeds activated; his speech faltered as shadows behind him murmured, *“Liar.”* <words>330</words>  

Back in the garage, Elara emerged, the machine’s lights dimming. <words>341</words> She checked her ledger: the flower’s entry now bore a tiny crown, crossed out. <words>355</words> Outside, the town’s bells chimed, their sound clearer, freer. <words>366</words> Shadows no longer spoke in riddles but in whispers of hope. <words>379</words> Elara smiled, cynically gentle. The tyrant’s reign, like her bread, had risen one last time—before collapsing under its own weight. <words>398</words>  

She returned to her bakery, the oven’s heat a comfort. <words>407</words> Tomorrow, she’d bake again, pressing flowers into every loaf. <words>420</words> Contagion, she thought, was best spread sweetly. <words>430</words>
