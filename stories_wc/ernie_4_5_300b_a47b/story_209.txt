The seasoned woodsman, Elias Voss, stood in the heart of the radio wave garden—a derelict field where static hummed like ghosts in the air—clutching an antique hairbrush engraved with his mother’s initials. <words>22</words> Its bristles, artfully messy with decades of grime, had once belonged to the woman who’d taught him to read the land’s secrets. <words>37</words> Now, as the final beep of a hospital monitor echoed in his memory (the one that silenced her voice forever), he vowed to map the abandoned railways crisscrossing these forgotten woods, not for glory, but for redemption. <words>67</words>  

He’d short-circuited the garden’s eerie tranquility by measuring the echo in an abandoned water tower, a method he’d devised after years of tracking signals through wilderness. <words>84</words> The tower’s iron ribs amplified his voice, bouncing phrases like *“How far does the pain travel?”* into the sky until the sound frayed into static. <words>104</words> Tonight, he’d use the hairbrush as a makeshift antenna, its wooden handle conducting the frequencies he needed to triangulate the railways’ hidden paths. <words>123</words>  

“Despair’s a liar,” he muttered, though his tone wavered between despairing cheer—a grim laughter that cracked like dry leaves. <words>140</words> The brush’s tines caught on a rusted wire as he climbed the tower’s ladder, and for a moment, he froze, imagining his mother’s voice: *“Honesty’s the only compass that doesn’t lie.”* She’d said that the day he’d lied about stealing apples, and her disappointment had cut deeper than any belt. <words>171</words>  

At the top, he pressed the brush against the tower’s metal wall and shouted, *“Echo, show me the way!”* The sound ricocheted, a delayed *thud-thud-thud* that he timed with a pocket watch. <words>192</words> The calculations were crude, but the pattern emerged: a railway buried beneath the garden’s overgrowth, its tracks still humming with the ghost of locomotives. <words>211</words>  

But as he scribbled the coordinates into a tattered notebook, the brush slipped from his grip, clattering to the ground below. <words>225</words> He scrambled down, heart racing, and found it nestled in a patch of ferns, its bristles now slick with dew. <words>238</words> Kneeling, he realized the truth—the railways weren’t just lines on a map; they were confessions. <words>251</words> The government had abandoned them to hide the towns they’d erased, the people they’d silenced. <words>264</words>  

Elias laughed, a sound that startled a nearby crow. <words>270</words> He’d spent years chasing ghosts, only to find the answer in a hairbrush and a lie half-remembered. <words>284</words> Honesty hadn’t freed him from the past—it had shown him the path forward. <words>297</words>  

As dawn bled into the sky, he walked the railway’s ghostly route, the brush tucked in his belt. <words>311</words> The garden’s static faded, replaced by the rhythmic clack of imaginary trains. <words>324</words> Despairing cheer, he thought, was just honesty wearing a smile. <words>337</words> And somewhere, beneath the weeds, a truth waited to be unearthed. <words>350</words>
