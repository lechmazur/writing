The disenchanted queen stood at the edge of her balcony, the cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise beneath her feet. [33] She had dismissed her attendants hours ago, their softly commanding voices now a distant hum. [44] Her fingers traced the cold stone railing, its surface slick with condensation from the mist that clung to the ridge. [58] She had come here after the final warning, the one delivered by the court seer whose eyes had flickered like dying embers when he spoke of the bleeding starlight. [82]

Her recurring dreams had begun three nights prior, each more vivid than the last. [93] In them, she climbed the ridge to the ember grotto, a place she had never seen but knew intimately. [109] The starlight there bled from the rocks, pooling in her palms like liquid silver. [123] When she woke, her sheets were damp with sweat, and the taste of iron lingered on her tongue. [139]

Tonight, she would unravel the mystery. [146] She pulled her cloak tighter, the fabric whispering against her skin as she stepped onto the narrow path. [162] The air smelled of ozone and something older, sharper—a lacy menace that made her breath hitch. [179] The ridge was steep, the stones slick, but she climbed without hesitation, her boots finding purchase in the cracks. [198]

Halfway up, she paused, leaning against a moss-covered boulder. [208] Below, the kingdom slept, its lights a smattering of gold against the dark. [222] Above, the sky was a tapestry of indigo, the stars sharp as pins. [236] She waited, her chest rising and falling in a rhythm that matched the distant pulse of the grotto. [254]

Then, a shared exhale—hers and the night’s—as the first fireflies of summer flickered to life. [271] They drifted upward, their glow soft and erratic, guiding her like tiny lanterns. [287] She smiled, a rare, genuine thing, and resumed her climb. [301]

The ember grotto emerged from the mist like a wound, its entrance framed by jagged rocks that glowed faintly, as if lit from within. [325] The queen’s pulse quickened. [330] She stepped inside, her boots crunching on gravel that sparked like crushed glass. [346]

The chamber was vast, its ceiling lost in shadow. [354] But the walls—ah, the walls—they pulsed with a light that was neither day nor night, a bleeding starlight that seeped from the stone in rivulets. [378] It pooled at her feet, warm and viscous, and she knelt, dipping her fingers into the glow. [397]

A voice echoed, not in her ears but in her bones. [406] *“You’ve come,”* it said, a rumble like distant thunder. [415] The queen looked up, her gaze meeting a figure carved from the very light—a being of shifting hues, its form neither male nor female, but both. [439]

*“I have,”* she replied, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. [452]

*“Why?”* the figure asked, its tone softly commanding, a question and a challenge. [470]

The queen stood, wiping her hands on her skirt. [479] *“Because the dreams won’t stop. Because I need to know why the starlight bleeds. Because I am tired of being a queen who feels nothing.”* [512]

The figure tilted its head, and the grotto shuddered. [521] *“You feel plenty,”* it said. *“You feel the weight of crowns, the ache of loneliness, the fear of irrelevance. You feel, and that is why you are here.”* [554]

The queen bristled. *“I am here to end the dreams, not to be lectured.”* [570]

The figure laughed, a sound like wind chimes in a storm. [582] *“The dreams are not the problem, child. They are the solution. The bleeding starlight is a mirror. It shows you what you refuse to see.”* [615]

The queen’s throat tightened. *“And what is that?”* [626]

*“That you are not disenchanted. You are afraid. Afraid to rule, afraid to love, afraid to fail. The starlight bleeds because you bleed. It is the same light, the same pain.”* [668]

The queen stepped back, her heel catching on a loose stone. [679] *“That’s… that’s nonsense.”* [688]

*“Is it?”* the figure asked, its form flickering. *“Look around you. This place is not just a grotto. It is a wound. A place where the sky and the earth collide, where light and darkness struggle. You are here because you are that struggle. You are the queen who must decide: will you let the bleeding stop, or will you let it consume you?”* [743]

The queen fell silent, the weight of the words pressing down. [756] She looked at her hands, still glistening with starlight, and understood. [771]

She turned, her cloak billowing behind her, and began the climb down. [780]
