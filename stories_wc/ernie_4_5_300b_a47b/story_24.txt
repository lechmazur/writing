The labyrinthine bookstore spiraled through the mountain’s heart, its shelves carved into stone like veins of forgotten knowledge. <words>17</words> I, a meandering bard with a lute strung with mismatched strings, wandered its aisles, my boots sinking into moss that glowed faintly in the dim light. <words>34</words> The air smelled of aged paper and iron, and somewhere deep in the stacks, a clock ticked backward. <words>47</words>  

Rumors swirled here like dust devils: a set of dentures, carved from moonstone, lay hidden in a volume of *The Collected Lies of Saints*. <words>64</words> They were said to have belonged to a revolutionary bard who’d once sung fire into frozen crowds. <words>75</words> I sought them not for glory, but for their warmth—a radiating heat that could thaw even the coldest soul. <words>89</words>  

My motivation was simple: to stir hearts grown cold. <words>96</words> The world had become a place of fractured idylls, where joy frayed at the edges like a worn tapestry. <words>108</words> I’d take the dentures and sow their warmth through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars, where the disillusioned gathered to drown their sorrows. <words>126</words>  

The bookstore’s owner, a wizened woman with eyes like tarnished silver, watched me from her nest of tomes. <words>138</words> “You’re looking for the extraordinary in the ordinary,” she said, her voice a rustle of dead leaves. <words>150</words> I nodded, though I knew the truth was reversed: the dentures were ordinarily extraordinary, their power hidden in plain sight. <words>166</words>  

She handed me a map drawn on parchment made of human hair. <words>175</words> “The lull before the storm,” she murmured, referring to the apologetic text I’d soon send to a lover I’d wronged. <words>189</words> “But first, the mountain’s heart.” <words>195</words>  

I followed the map through corridors that shifted like living things, until I found the volume—a leather-bound tome titled *How to Mourn a Sunrise*. <words>211</words> Inside, nestled in a velvet case, were the dentures. <words>219</words> They pulsed with a heat that made my fingertips tingle, as if I’d plunged them into a bath of liquid starlight. <words>233</words>  

That night, in a bar stinking of spilled ale and regret, I set up my puppet stage. <words>244</words> The audience, a motley crew of thieves and dreamers, jeered until I placed the dentures in the mouth of my wooden bard. <words>258</words> The puppet’s song—a lullaby about forgiveness—radiated warmth, melting the frost from the patrons’ eyes. <words>271</words>  

A woman with a scarred face wept openly. <words>277</words> A man who’d not spoken in years laughed, a sound like breaking chains. <words>289</words> The dentures, I realized, weren’t just relics—they were a catalyst, a spark to ignite the dormant embers in us all. <words>303</words>  

By dawn, I’d sent the apologetic text, my words trembling with honesty. <words>314</words> The reply came swiftly: *“I’m already packing.”* <words>322</words>  

I left the bookstore, the dentures humming in my pocket. <words>330</words> The mountain’s shadow stretched long and thin, but I carried its warmth within me. <words>342</words> Somewhere, in another seedy bar, another puppet show would begin. <words>354</words>  

The world, I thought, was a labyrinth of cold hearts. <words>363</words> But even the meandering bard could sow a little fire. <words>375</words>  

And in the lull before the storm, that was enough. <words>386</words>
