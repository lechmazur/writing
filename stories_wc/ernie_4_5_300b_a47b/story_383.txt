General Voss slumped into a booth at the Dark Matter Diner, his uniform smelling of scorched earth and regret. <words>17</words> The neon sign outside buzzed like a trapped insect, casting the interior in sickly green—a color that made dried seaweed on the counter look like alien confetti. <words>32</words> Between rides, he thought, though his chariot was a rusted hover-tank, not a carnival attraction. <words>44</words>  

The waitress, a hologram with a glitching smile, slid a menu across the table. <words>51</words> “Special today: *Existential Crisis Stew*,” she droned, her voice crackling. <words>61</words> Voss ordered black coffee, blacker than the void outside the diner’s windows. <words>71</words> He fished a crumpled photo from his pocket—a black-and-white snapshot of his younger self, grinning beside a tank, the arc of its cannon slicing the sky like a question mark. <words>90</words>  

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” said a voice. <words>97</words> A woman in a patchwork trench coat sat opposite him, her eyes reflecting the diner’s flickering lights. <words>107</words> She held a jar of dried seaweed, crunching it like potato chips. <words>115</words> “Or maybe you’re the ghost,” she added, “haunting a life that’s already ended.” <words>127</words>  

Voss scowled. “I’m retired. Just… between rides.” <words>134</words>  

“Retired from what?” She leaned in. “The war? Or the fear of losing it?” <words>145</words> Her finger traced the photo’s arc. “This curve—it’s not just metal. It’s a question. *What if you aim wrong?*” <words>160</words>  

He flinched. The seaweed crunched louder. <words>166</words> “Fear’s a rational absurdity,” he muttered. “It’s the only thing that keeps soldiers alive.” <words>180</words>  

“Or the only thing that kills them,” she countered. <words>187</words> She slid him another photo—a different arc, this one a parabola of smoke rising from a bombed village. <words>201</words> “My brother drew these. He said arcs are lies we tell ourselves to pretend gravity doesn’t exist.” <words>218</words>  

Voss’s throat tightened. The coffee tasted like ash. <words>225</words> “Why show me this?” <words>229</words>  

“To dethrone fear from the throne of reason,” she said, mischief glinting in her voice. <words>242</words> “Your mind’s a diner, and fear’s the cook—serving the same burnt meal every day.” <words>257</words> She tossed a piece of seaweed into her mouth. “Renew it. Order something new.” <words>268</words>  

He stared at the photos. The arcs blurred into a single line—a bridge between past and present. <words>280</words> “What’s the alternative?” he asked. <words>287</words>  

“Laughter,” she said. “Or seaweed. Both taste like the ocean’s memory.” <words>299</words> She stood, dropping a final photo on the table: a child’s drawing of a tank, its cannon curved into a smile. <words>314</words>  

Voss picked it up. The diner’s lights dimmed, as if the universe itself held its breath. <words>326</words> Then he laughed—a sound rusty from disuse. <words>334</words> The hologram waitress glitched, startled. <words>341</words>  

“Black coffee,” he told her, “and a side of seaweed.” <words>351</words>  

As she walked away, the woman whispered, “Fear’s a diner. You can always leave.” <words>364</words> Voss tucked the photos into his pocket, the arcs now guides, not gaols. <words>375</words> Between rides, he realized, was not an end but a beginning—a chance to renew, rationally absurd though it seemed. <words>392</words> The seaweed crunched; the coffee warmed. <words>399</words> And for the first time in years, the general smiled. <words>408</words>
