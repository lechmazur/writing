Father Elias jogged through the labyrinth orchard, his boots crunching snow beneath a canopy of giant bean stalks that clawed at the clouds. <words>20</words> He hadn’t been a priest in years, but the habit of seeking answers in motion clung to him like a second skin. <words>37</words> His hands trembled around the abacus with missing beads—a relic from his old confessional, now a compass for this strange pilgrimage. <words>57</words> The orchard’s paths twisted like a mind unraveling, and he followed the snow’s patterns: melted here, drifted there, as if the ground itself whispered directions. <words>80</words>  

He’d come here to step beyond fate’s design, though he couldn’t articulate why. <words>93</words> The dull radiance of the scene—pale sunlight filtering through icy stalks, snow glittering like scattered salt—mirrored his unapologetically confused state. <words>117</words> Once, he’d believed in divine order, but complacency had rotted his faith like woodworm in a pew. <words>135</words> Now, he jogged because stillness felt like surrender.  

The abacus rattled in his grip. Each missing bead was a life unaccounted for, a sin he’d failed to absolve. <words>159</words> He’d traded prayer for pragmatism, then traded that for emptiness. <words>173</words> The orchard’s silence was not peace but a hush, as if fate itself held its breath, waiting to see if he’d notice the threads fraying.  

Ahead, the snow formed an arrow, pointing deeper into the maze. <words>194</words> He followed, lungs burning, until he reached a clearing where the stalks parted to reveal a mirror-like pond. <words>212</words> His reflection stared back, aged and frayed, the abacus’s beads clicking like a metronome counting down his complacency.  

“You think running changes anything?” The voice was his own, but deeper, resonant with the weight of unspoken truths. <words>240</words> The pond’s surface rippled, distorting his face into a stranger’s. <words>254</words>  

He stopped jogging. Knees aching, he knelt and traced the abacus’s missing beads. Each gap was a choice he’d deferred, a question he’d silenced. <words>278</words> The price of complacency wasn’t stagnation—it was erasure. <words>291</words>  

The snow began to fall again, heavy and deliberate. <words>303</words> He stood, abacus in hand, and walked toward the pond’s edge. <words>316</words> The water didn’t ripple when he stepped in; it accepted him, cold and clear. <words>330</words> As he sank, the bean stalks above him bent, their shadows merging into a single, inescapable truth: fate wasn’t a design to outrun but a mirror to shatter. <words>357</words>  

He emerged on the opposite bank, drenched but lighter. The abacus now held all its beads, each one glowing faintly. <words>375</words> The orchard’s paths lay straight before him, no longer a labyrinth but a road. <words>389</words> He began to jog again, not to escape, but to meet what came next—unapologetically, confusedly, awake. <words>408</words>  

The dull radiance of the world sharpened, and for the first time in years, Father Elias smiled. <words>425</words>
