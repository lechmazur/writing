Sir Cedric of the Iron Gauntlet, a straight-laced knight whose armor gleamed like polished moonlight, stood in the luminous swamp, his breath fogging the air. <words>19</words> The championship match’s scoreboard had reset hours ago, its digital hum fading into the croak of frogs and the hiss of will-o’-wisps. <words>34</words> He’d come here not for glory, but to verify an urban legend: a fossilized snail shell said to grant its holder “converging destinies.” <words>51</words> Cedric, academically rebellious despite his rigid reputation, scoffed at superstition—yet here he was, wading through knee-deep muck. <words>68</words>  

The swamp’s glow pulsed like a living heart, casting long shadows over the moss-caked shelves of a crumbling apothecary. <words>83</words> Cedric’s gauntlet brushed a cobwebbed jar labeled *Elixir of Forgotten Paths* as he spotted it—the shell, perched on the top shelf, its spiral etched with ancient runes. <words>103</words> He reached, but so did another hand: slender, ink-stained, and trembling. <words>112</words>  

They collided. The shelf shuddered, bottles clattering like discordant bells. <words>122</words> “Pardon,” muttered Cedric, stepping back to reveal a girl in a patched lab coat, her eyes wild behind spectacles. <words>132</words> “Lila,” she said, clutching a tattered notebook. “I’ve been tracking this shell for years. It’s… it’s a key.” <words>145</words>  

Cedric arched a brow. “A key to what?” <words>151</words>  

“Converging destinies,” she said, as if reciting a mantra. “The shell’s runes map parallel timelines. Whoever holds it can… merge paths.” <words>168</words> Her voice quickened. “I’m a physicist—or was, before the academy expelled me for ‘dangerous theories.’” <words>180</words>  

Cedric’s laconic exuberance flared. He’d been expelled too, for debating strategy during a tournament. <words>191</words> “Rebels, then,” he said, grinning beneath his helmet. “But why trust me?” <words>199</words>  

Lila shrugged. “You’re here. That’s enough.” <words>207</words>  

They split the shell, its fossilized halves fitting like a jigsaw puzzle. <words>215</words> The swamp’s glow intensified, and Cedric felt it—a tug, as if his past and future were threads being woven. <words>228</words> Images flashed: his knightly orders disbanding, Lila’s theories vindicated, a world where science and swordcraft coexisted. <words>241</words>  

“See?” Lila said. “Destinies converge when rebels dare to verify the impossible.” <words>254</words>  

Cedric laughed, a sound like clanging armor. “Next time, let’s bump into a tavern instead.” <words>266</words>  

They trudged back through the swamp, the shell’s halves glowing in their pockets. <words>276</words> Behind them, the apothecary’s shelves rearranged, bottles shifting into new patterns. <words>286</words>  

“Hey,” Lila said. “You ever wonder what’s next?” <words>294</words>  

Cedric shrugged. “Probably another legend. Or a fight.” <words>303</words>  

“Same,” she said. “But now, we’ll have backup.” <words>311</words>  

The swamp’s light dimmed, but Cedric’s steps grew lighter. <words>319</words> For the first time in years, he didn’t mind the unknown. <words>328</words>  

Rebels, after all, thrived in the in-between. <words>336</words>
