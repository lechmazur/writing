Amid the farmers market bustle, where stalls overflowed with autumn squash and honeycomb, Lira Voss clutched a baseball signed by a time traveler—her only proof that forbidden knowledge existed. <words>25</words>
She’d been separated from her twin, Kael, at birth, their fates diverging until a cryptic letter arrived: *“Meet me at the mountain’s crown. Bring the ball. We’ll outlive the prophecy.”* <words>35</words>
Lira’s hands trembled. The baseball, its leather cracked and ink faded, bore a signature: *“Z. Quicksilver, 2147.”* Kael claimed it held the key to surviving the apocalypse—a cataclysm foretold by their grandmother’s visions. <words>52</words>
To find him, Lira hired actors from the market: a street magician to distract guards, a mime to mimic her movements, and a poet to forge documents. Each was paid in whispers of the truth. <words>50</words>
The mountain peak loomed, shrouded in mist, its slopes littered with relics of past seekers. Lira’s group ascended in silence, the air sharp with pine and the metallic tang of fear. <words>42</words>
At the summit, a hidden cave yawned, its entrance veiled by ivy. Inside, crystal shadows danced on walls etched with equations only a madman—or a genius—could decipher. Kael stood at the center, his face a mirror of hers. <words>53</words>
“You brought it,” he said, not a question. The baseball glowed faintly, as if alive. “Z. Quicksilver was our ancestor. He time-jumped to warn us.” <words>38</words>
Lira’s throat tightened. “Warn us about what?” <words>8</words>
Kael gestured to the cave’s heart: a machine humming with alien energy. “The prophecy isn’t a disaster. It’s a *choice*. Stay, and the world ends. Leave, and we reset time.” <words>42</words>
The actors froze. The magician’s hat slipped, revealing a hidden blade. “You’re mad,” he hissed. <words>17</words>
Kael smiled, typically unique in its coldness. “Madness is the price of forbidden knowledge.” He tossed the baseball into the machine. Light erupted, swallowing the cave. <words>37</words>
Lira lunged to subdue him, but the ground vanished. She fell, not into darkness, but into a memory: her twin, age seven, whispering, *“The mountain knows.”* <words>34</words>
When she opened her eyes, the market lay below, unchanged. The actors were gone. Only Kael remained, holding the baseball. “It worked,” he said. “We’re alive. But the machine’s gone. So is the prophecy.” <words>46</words>
Lira stared. “How?” <words>2</words>
“By making the knowledge forbidden again.” Kael’s gaze met hers. “Some truths are too heavy to carry. Let them stay buried.” <words>30</words>
As they descended, the mountain’s shadows lengthened, crystal and sharp. Lira wondered if Kael was right—or if he’d simply traded one apocalypse for another. <words>35</words>
But in her pocket, the baseball remained, cool and ordinary. A reminder that some mysteries, like twins, are better left unseparated. <words>29</words>
