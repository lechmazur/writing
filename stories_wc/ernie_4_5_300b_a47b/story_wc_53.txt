The kinetic lagoon above the clouds pulsed with a restless energy, its waters churning in hues of bruised violet and electric gold. [29] A resolute scavenger named Veyra knelt at the lagoon’s edge, her calloused fingers sifting through the froth for debris left behind after the carousel halts—a colossal, skeletal ride that once spun visitors through the stratosphere but now lay dormant, its gears rusted into silence. [76] She’d memorized the lagoon’s rhythms: the way the water sloshed westward at dawn, the way it hissed when the wind carried secrets from the sunken cities below. [108] Today, her prize was a disposable camera wheel, its plastic spokes warped but intact, a relic from a tourist who’d photographed the lagoon’s beauty before the carousel’s final spin. [143]

Veyra’s ambitions had eroded like the lagoon’s shores, eaten away by years of scavenging. [162] She’d once dreamed of repairing the carousel, of reigniting its music to lure back the crowds. [182] Now, she collected fragments—a rusted bolt, a frayed rope, the camera wheel—to barter with her own ghost, a specter that materialized at dusk to whisper of failures. [217] “You’re chronologically confused,” the ghost would say, its voice a echo of her younger self. [231] “You think time moves backward here.” [241]

The lagoon’s fractured stillness amplified her confusion. [253] Days bled into nights without transition; the sun hung like a stuck coin in the sky. [273] Veyra’s mind mirrored this chaos. She remembered planting a seed in the lagoon’s soil a decade ago, only to find it still a seed yesterday. [301] She remembered her mother’s laughter, sharp and sudden, though her mother had drowned here before the carousel stopped. [323]

To negotiate with her ghost, Veyra gathered stories. [332] She eavesdropped on fishermen who claimed the lagoon’s waters could heal, on lovers who swore it amplified whispers. [357] She pieced together fragments: a child’s tale of a mermaid with a camera for a heart, a poet’s verse about a carousel that devoured time. [387] The camera wheel, she decided, was the key. Its lens, though cracked, might capture the lagoon’s true nature—or her ghost’s face. [417]

At dusk, the ghost appeared, its form flickering like a faulty hologram. [430] “You’ve brought me trinkets,” it said, gesturing to the pile of debris. [444] “But where’s the courage to let go?” [454]

Veyra held up the camera wheel. “This was someone’s memory. Maybe it’s mine too.” [474] The ghost laughed, a sound like grinding gears. “You cling to fragments. The lagoon doesn’t care.” [495]

“Then why do you haunt me?” she snapped. [503]

The ghost’s expression softened, a rare crack in its mirrored surface. “Because you haven’t forgiven yourself.” [523]

Regret coiled in Veyra’s chest, hot and familiar. She’d blamed herself for the carousel’s halt, for her mother’s death, for the erosion of her dreams. [548] The lagoon’s waters stirred, as if sensing her turmoil. [559] She dropped the camera wheel into the froth. It sank, vanishing into the violet depths. [577]

“I’m tired,” Veyra said. [583]

The ghost nodded. “Then rest.” [589]

For the first time since the carousel stopped, Veyra slept without dreaming. [603] When she woke, the lagoon was calm, its surface reflecting a sky unmarred by storms. [620] The camera wheel was gone, but in its place floated a single, perfect rose—its petals the same bruised violet as the water. [644]

Veyra smiled, though she didn’t know why. She waded into the lagoon, letting the current carry her toward the horizon. [664] The ghost lingered at the shore, watching until she became a speck against the gold. [681]

Days later, fishermen found the rose preserved in a jar of lagoon water, its stem wrapped in a note: *For the girl who collects stories.* [713] They debated its origin, but Veyra never returned to claim it. [730] Some said she’d drowned. Others insisted she’d finally outrun time. [749]

The lagoon, however, knew the truth. It had always known. [750]
