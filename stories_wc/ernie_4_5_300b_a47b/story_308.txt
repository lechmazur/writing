The floating yoga studio drifted lazily on the harbor’s calm waters, its bamboo decks swaying like a cradle amid festival preparations. <words>21</words> Lira, the bashful executioner of the city’s ceremonial axe, stood at the studio’s edge, her fingers tracing the cheap keychain dangling from her wrist—a trinket from a market stall, its plastic dolphin charm chipped but sincerely rare, a gift from her late grandmother. <words>50</words> Tomorrow, the city would celebrate the Tide’s Return, a milestone marking the soothing tides’ annual ascent, when the ocean’s rhythm synced with the heartbeat of the land. <words>72</words>  

Lira’s family had a unique way of honoring the festival: each member preserved a dance movement, passed down through generations, to perform at dawn. <words>93</words> Her mother’s spin, her father’s leap, her brother’s stomp—all etched into memory like seals on wax. <words>108</words> But Lira, tasked with ending lives in cold stone halls, had never dared to dance. <words>122</words>  

“You’ll flinch,” her brother had teased years ago, mimicking her stiffness. <words>133</words> The word lodged in her like a splinter. Now, amid the studio’s incense and the murmur of instructors, she vowed to prove him wrong. <words>150</words>  

The instructor, a woman with sea-gray hair, guided her onto a mat. “Let the tides move you,” she said, nodding to the horizon where the sun dipped, gilding the waves. <words>170</words> Lira’s palms sweated. The keychain dug into her wrist. She closed her eyes, imagining the ocean’s pull—gentle, inevitable. <words>187</words>  

Her first step was a stumble. The studio rocked; someone gasped. Heat flooded her cheeks. <words>202</words> But then she remembered the keychain’s dolphin, leaping forever in plastic waves. She lifted her foot again, slower, letting her hips sway like the studio’s gentle tilt. <words>223</words>  

“There,” the instructor murmured. “Feel the rhythm.” <words>231</words>  

Lira’s movements grew bolder, her arms carving arcs in the air. The soothing tides seemed to rise beneath her, their benign ferocity guiding her limbs. <words>252</words> She spun, and for a moment, the studio’s drift mirrored the dance’s flow—a harmony of chaos and calm. <words>270</words>  

When she opened her eyes, the class was silent. Then, applause rippled, soft as lapping waves. <words>285</words> The instructor smiled. “You’ve preserved something rare today.” <words>296</words>  

Lira touched the keychain, its edges warm from her grip. She hadn’t flinched. Not once. <words>310</words>  

Later, as she helped string lanterns for the festival, her brother approached. “Since when do you dance?” he asked, eyebrow raised. <words>330</words>  

She grinned, a rare thing. “Since I stopped fearing the tide.” <words>343</words>  

That night, under a moonlit sky, the family performed their dance on the docks. Lira’s movement, fluid and fierce, stole the show. <words>364</words> The crowd cheered, but she heard only the ocean’s whisper, a reminder that even executioners could ride the current. <words>385</words>  

By dawn, the Tide’s Return festival blazed with fireworks. Lira stood at the water’s edge, the keychain glinting. She’d preserve this dance, too—not in memory, but in muscle, in bone, in the quiet courage to sway when the world expected her to stand still. <words>419</words>  

The bashful executioner had found her rhythm. And the tides, it seemed, approved. <words>435</words>
