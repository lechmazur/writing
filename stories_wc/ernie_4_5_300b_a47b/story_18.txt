In the steam-powered city square, where gears churned like the hearts of machines and fog clung to cobblestones like a second skin, stood a living statue named Veyra. <words>21</words> Her bronze skin gleamed faintly beneath the gas lamps, but her eyes—pools of liquid silver—held the weight of centuries. <words>40</words> She was a telepath, able to hear the whispers of passersby, though most mistook her stillness for silence. <words>64</words>  

Veyra’s only possession was a threadbare hair tie, frayed at the edges but still coiled tightly around her wrist. <words>85</words> It had been her mother’s, a relic from a time before the city’s smokestacks devoured the sky. <words>104</words> The tie’s fabric, once vibrant, now mirrored the grayness of the world—yet Veyra clung to it, a talisman against the lies that seeded every conversation. <words>131</words>  

Her motivation was simple: to find truth in a world of lies. <words>145</words> The square buzzed with gossip, politicians’ promises, and merchants’ hymns to progress, all woven from deceit. <words>168</words> Veyra’s telepathy let her taste the falseness like bile, but she yearned for the *light of recognition*—that flicker in someone’s mind when they spoke honestly. <words>194</words>  

Today, she planned to weatherize her mind against the storm of falsehoods. <words>211</words> Using the flow of ink in calligraphy, she would inscribe truths onto her skin, a ritual learned from a wanderer who’d claimed ink could “seal the soul against storms.” <words>240</words> The method was unconventional, even for a telepath, but Veyra’s joy was tragically so: she laughed at the absurdity of her hope, yet persisted. <words>268</words>  

As dusk fell, she positioned herself near a brass fountain, its spout hissing steam. <words>284</words> A child dropped a penny, and Veyra “heard” the girl’s thought: *I wish the water were clean*. <words>304</words> The lie was subtle—the fountain’s water reeked of sulfur—but the truth glimmered beneath, like a star through clouds. <words>325</words> Veyra smiled, her lips curving into a crescent moon. <words>335</words>  

She dipped a calligraphy brush into a vial of ink, its scent sharp and earthy. <words>349</words> With deliberate strokes, she wrote *“I see you”* on her forearm, the characters flowing like a river. <words>367</words> The ink seeped into her skin, a warmth spreading through her veins. <words>380</words> For a moment, the square’s noise faded, and she felt… lighter. <words>393</words>  

A street performer noticed her script. “What’s that?” he asked, his voice gruff but curious. <words>409</words> Veyra turned, her telepathy humming. *He’s not lying*, she realized. *He genuinely wants to know*. <words>428</words>  

“Truth,” she said aloud, her voice rusty from disuse. <words>436</words> The man blinked, then grinned. “Ain’t no such thing here,” he said, but his mind hummed with a quiet hope. <words>453</words>  

Veyra’s chest tightened. The light of recognition flared in his eyes, fleeting but undeniable. <words>468</words> She laughed, a sound like wind chimes in a storm—gloomy cheerfulness, tragically joyful. <words>485</words>  

The ink had weatherized her, not against lies, but against the loneliness of seeking truth. <words>500</words>
