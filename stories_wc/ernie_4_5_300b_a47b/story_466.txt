The smoke signal tower loomed above the supermarket parking lot, its iron skeleton puffing gray plumes that dissolved into a sky the color of spoiled milk. <words>21</words> Clara Voss, a connoisseur of forgotten things, paused mid-cart-push, her fingers tightening on a crinkled plastic bag. <words>35</words> Amid the fluorescent hum of grocery shopping, the tower’s shadow fell across her like a dare. <words>47</words> She’d always had a sudden urge to explore paths not taken—a compulsion that made her morally ambiguous reputation both curse and compass. <words>64</words>  

Inside her tote bag, three vintage seed packets rustled, their yellowed edges stamped with names like *Moonflower of the Unseen Glade* and *Whisperroot*. <words>81</words> She’d xerographed them that morning at the library, tracing the faded botanical illustrations with a finger, decoding symbols etched in the margins: a crescent moon, a spiral, a keyhole. <words>101</words> The connoisseur’s mind raced—these weren’t just seeds. They were a language, a map, a *why* left behind by someone who’d vanished decades ago. <words>119</words>  

Clara abandoned her cart, the half-filled basket of quinoa and kale forgotten. <words>130</words> The tower’s ladder creaked under her boots as she climbed, each rung a step closer to cornering an elusive destiny. <words>143</words> At the summit, the air smelled of burnt sage and rust. <words>151</words> A ledge held a stack of xeroxed pages, their edges charred, pinned beneath a rusted teapot. <words>163</words> She recognized the handwriting—same as the seed packets. The first page read: *“The tower knows. Feed it light.”* <words>177</words>  

Gentle chaos unspooled around her. Wind snatched at the pages; a pigeon cooed like a disapproving librarian. <words>191</words> Clara placed a seed packet on the ledge, angling it toward the sun. The xeroxed illustration flared, projecting a hologram of a forest path. <words>207</words> Her breath hitched. The path wasn’t on any map—it was a *memory*, a route only the seeds could unlock. <words>222</words>  

But unlocking it meant planting the seeds, letting them grow into something that might uproot her life. <words>236</words> She hesitated, morally ambiguous to her core. What if the destiny she cornered wasn’t hers to claim? <words>250</words> The tower shuddered, as if impatient. A seed packet slipped, scattering seeds into the wind. <words>264</words> They glowed faintly, swirling like embers, before vanishing into the smoke. <words>275</words>  

Clara laughed—a sound like wind chimes in a storm. She’d spent years decoding the forgotten, only to realize some secrets demanded *action*, not analysis. <words>293</words> She xerographed the remaining pages, tucking them into her coat, and descended the ladder. <words>307</words> The grocery cart was gone, but she didn’t care. The path not taken had become the one she’d forge. <words>322</words>  

Later, she’d plant the seeds in her garden, watch them grow into vines that twisted into glyphs. <words>336</words> The tower’s smoke would fade, but the gentle chaos of possibility remained—a reminder that destiny, like a xeroxed map, is never static. <words>355</words>  

Clara Voss, connoisseur of the half-seen, smiled. Her elusive destiny wasn’t a place. It was a verb. <words>370</words>
