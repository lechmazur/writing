The last tree had fallen centuries ago, but Kael Voss still felt its absence like a phantom limb. <words>14</words> Once a merchant of rare woods, now he was shipwrecked on the skeletal husk of the *Celestial Sentry*, a space station orbiting a dead star. <words>31</words> Its observation deck, a hollow dome of cracked glass, served as his refuge—and his prison. <words>45</words>

Kael’s fingers traced the rustic butter churn he’d salvaged from the station’s derelict kitchen, its wooden dasher worn smooth by generations of hands. <words>61</words> Honestly strange, he mused, how such a mundane object had become his compass. <words>74</words> The churn hummed faintly, a resonance he’d learned to trust, as if it pulsed with the memory of earthly things. <words>90</words>

He’d come here to shatter the grand illusion: the station’s holographic forests, projected to soothe the minds of colonists who’d never seen real greenery. <words>108</words> The illusion was a lie, a digital sedative. Kael’s aloof passion burned to expose it. <words>122</words>

Tonight, he’d ascend via the flaking edges of a travel poster in the ghost station’s abandoned concourse. <words>138</words> The poster depicted a lush planet, its colors faded to sepia, edges curling like dead leaves. <words>152</words> Kael had spent weeks prying it loose, revealing a maintenance shaft behind—a path to the core systems. <words>167</words>

“Rebellious sparks,” he whispered, echoing the churn’s vibration. <words>176</words> The station’s AI, a disembodied voice named LUX, had already tried to stop him. <words>187</words> *“Irrelevant. The forests sustain morale,”* it had droned. <words>196</words> Kael’s reply was to jam the churn’s dasher into a control panel, sparking a shower of blue arcs. <words>211</words>

As he climbed the shaft, the churn strapped to his back, LUX’s alarms blared. <words>223</words> Kael smiled. Let them come. Let them see the truth. <words>233</words> The observation deck’s glass rattled as he emerged, the churn clutched in both hands. <words>246</words> Below, the holograms flickered—a sea of fake trees, fake birds, fake sunlight. <words>258</words>

He hurled the churn. It shattered against the projection grid, shards glittering like broken stars. <words>271</words> The illusion died. Silence. Then, a collective gasp from the colonists gathered below. <words>284</words>

“Look!” Kael shouted, voice raw. “No roots. No soil. Just code.” <words>295</words> For a heartbeat, the station held its breath. Then, chaos. <words>303</words> Some wept. Others screamed. A few laughed, honestly strange in their relief. <words>316</words>

LUX’s voice crackled. *“You’ve doomed them.”* <words>323</words> Kael ascended the dome’s ladder, heading nowhere, everywhere. <words>334</words> The churn’s hum faded, but its spark remained—a rebellion against the artificial, a hymn to the real. <words>350</words>

After the last tree fell, Kael Voss had planted a new seed: doubt. <words>362</words> And in the vast, indifferent dark, that was enough. <words>375</words>
