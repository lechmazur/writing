In the abandoned medical bay of the *Starlight’s Cradle*, where the universe hummed its secret song through fractured vents, a forthright peddler named Jessa knelt beside a rusted supply cabinet. <words>23</words> Her meekly assertive hands trembled as she unwrapped a dried flower bouquet, its petals brittle but still clinging to hints of violet. <words>40</words> She’d traded three ration packs for it on the black market, believing its fragility mirrored her own fractured vow. <words>62</words>  

The station’s corridors echoed with the ghosts of patients who’d once clung to life here, their screams now replaced by the whir of cosmic static. <words>85</words> Jessa’s oath—sealed in blood years ago with a smuggler king—had cursed her to wander, peddling trinkets to forget. <words>108</words> But tonight, while the universe hummed a lullaby of distant supernovas, she aimed to break it. <words>126</words>  

Her method was unconventional: sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns projected onto a cracked holoscreen. <words>146</words> The columns buzzed with whispers of a redemption ritual hidden in the station’s bowels, a way to “divide” one’s sins from their soul. <words>169</words> Jessa’s fingers danced across the screen, filtering lies from truth, her meekness sharpening into resolve. <words>187</words>  

The bouquet’s stems rattled as she placed it atop a decaying medical scanner. “Divide,” she murmured, recalling the smuggler’s words: *“To atone, you must split what’s whole.”* The scanner beeped, its lights flickering like a heartbeat. <words>217</words> She’d assumed this meant severing a physical object, but the gossip columns hinted at something deeper—a metaphorical divide between guilt and grace. <words>240</words>  

A hologram of a priestess materialized, her voice tinny. “Redemption’s path is paved with joyful loneliness,” she intoned. “You must carry your sins alone, yet find light in the void.” Jessa scoffed, but the words lodged in her chest. <words>272</words> She’d always equated redemption with grand gestures, not the quiet persistence of surviving. <words>291</words>  

The scanner’s needle pricked her finger. A drop of blood fell onto the bouquet, and the flowers shuddered. <words>307</words> As if sifted by an invisible hand, the petals separated—half rising like ash into the air, half crumbling to dust. <words>326</words> Jessa gasped. The gossip columns had been right: the divide wasn’t external, but a shedding of layers, a reckoning with what she’d chosen to keep. <words>350</words>  

She laughed, a sound both bitter and free, as the station’s hum swelled into a chorus. <words>364</words> The oath’s weight lifted, not erased, but transformed. Jessa tucked the remaining flowers into her coat, their fragility now a badge of courage. <words>386</words>  

As she left the medical bay, the gossip columns faded behind her, their rumors no longer chains but stepping stones. <words>404</words> The universe’s song grew clearer, a melody of second chances. Jessa, the forthright peddler, walked onward, meekly assertive in her newfound truth: redemption wasn’t a destination, but a path walked alone, yet humming all the same. <words>438</words>
