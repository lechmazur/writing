The druid’s fingers drummed the dented lunch tin, its surface scratched with decades of forgotten meals, as they slouched in the hologram repair shop’s lobby. <words>20</words> Outside, the library’s clock tower chimed, marking the start of hours when the world pretended order existed. <words>33</words> They’d come here because the shop’s owner, a wiry technician named Jessa, owed them a favor—a debt as uniquely common as the druid’s own restless spirit. <words>52</words>  

“You’re late,” Jessa muttered, not looking up from a flickering hologram of a dancing peacock. <words>63</words> The druid shrugged, the motion rustling their frayed cloak. <words>70</words> “Libraries tire me,” they said, though the truth was they’d wandered through back-alley theater auditions all morning, humming half-remembered chants to calm actors’ nerves. <words>90</words>  

Jessa slammed a tool down. <words>95</words> “Your *obligations* are a黑洞,” she said, using the ancient word for “black hole.” <words>107</words> The druid winced. <words>112</words> They’d promised to fix her holograms if she’d let them “borrow” the shop’s back room during library hours. <words>128</words> A fair trade, they’d argued—beauty for anarchy. <words>139</words>  

The tin rattled as they stood, its noise echoing in the shop’s cluttered aisles. <words>150</words> Jessa’s holograms littered the space: a phoenix with a broken wing, a river that flowed backward, a child’s laughter trapped in a loop. <words>167</words> The druid trailed a hand over them, murmuring, “Chaos is just beauty’s first draft.” <words>181</words>  

They wandered to the back room, where a single spotlight illuminated a rusted audition stage. <words>195</words> Actors had left behind scripts, costumes, and a single rose, its petals wilted but still red. <words>209</words> The druid placed the tin beside a stack of sheet music. <words>219</words> “Today,” they declared to the empty room, “we’ll forge a symphony from silence.” <words>232</words>  

Hours passed in a haze of soldering irons and half-baked spells. <words>243</words> The druid’s excitement was lethargic, a slow burn that matched the shop’s flickering lights. <words>258</words> They mended the phoenix’s wing with copper wire, humming a ballad about stars that refused to set. <words>274</words> Jessa watched from the doorway, arms crossed. <words>283</words> “You’re still terrible at this,” she said. <words>290</words>  

“But I’m getting better,” the druid replied, not looking up. <words>300</words>  

When the library closed, the holograms shimmered to life. <words>311</words> The phoenix soared, its feathers now iridescent; the river flowed forward, carrying petals like tiny boats. <words>328</words> The druid’s chest swelled with a pride as uniquely common as their doubt. <words>342</words>  

Jessa stepped forward, holding the dented tin. <words>350</words> “Take it,” she said. <words>355</words> “And next time, bring better snacks.” <words>365</words>  

The druid laughed, a sound as worn as the tin but just as vital. <words>377</words> They wandered out, the shop’s door clicking shut behind them, the ties of obligation humming in their veins like a second heartbeat. <words>397</words>
