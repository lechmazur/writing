In the witch’s crumbling herb garden, where moonflowers bloomed black and the air hummed with forgotten spells, a jovial sellsword named Corin leaned against an oak barrel, polishing his brass astronomical telescope. <words>25</words> The instrument, a relic from his grandfather’s pirate days, gleamed under the twilight as he muttered, “A vow’s a vow, even if it’s withering at the roots.” <words>43</words>  

Corin had never been one for solemnity, but the “withering vow”—a pact forged in his family’s blood to guard a treasure until the garden’s last thorn withered—had gnawed at him since childhood. <words>62</words> His boldly reluctant nature made him bristle at duty, yet here he stood, armed with a telescope to map the stars and a shovel to dig where no shovel should go. <words>80</words>  

“Doubt’s a thief,” he said aloud, adjusting the telescope’s lens to spy a constellation shaped like a lock. <words>92</words> The garden’s transformation had begun at dawn: vines coiling like serpents, soil shifting like sand, and the air thickening with the scent of time itself. <words>107</words> Corin’s task was to dethrone that doubt, to prove the vow’s worth by unearthing the treasure before the garden’s metamorphosis completed. <words>123</words>  

He grinned, a spark of mischief in his eyes. “Time for elegant mayhem,” he declared, slinging the telescope over his shoulder and grabbing a rusted spade. <words>137</words> The family tradition demanded a time capsule buried beneath the garden’s heart, a ritual passed through generations like a curse. <words>151</words> But Corin had never dug one up—only planted them, filled with trinkets and lies to placate the garden’s wrath. <words>165</words>  

As he struck the earth, the ground shuddered. Roots writhed, and a low hum vibrated in his bones. <words>177</words> “Steady,” he muttered, sweat beading on his brow. The transformation accelerated: flowers shed petals like ash, and the telescope’s lens flickered with ghostly light. <words>193</words> Corin’s boldness faltered. What if the treasure was a lie? What if the vow was a fool’s errand? <words>205</words>  

Then he remembered his grandfather’s last words: *“The treasure’s not gold, lad. It’s the truth you bury.”* <words>217</words> With a roar, Corin dug deeper, the spade clanging against something metallic. <words>227</words> He unearthed a tarnished chest, its lock shaped like the constellation he’d mapped. <words>237</words> Inside lay not jewels, but a single scroll: *“The vow withers when doubt dies. You’ve dethroned it. Now rebuild.”* <words>252</words>  

The garden stilled. The vines retreated, and the air cleared. Corin sat back, laughing breathlessly. <words>264</words> The telescope slipped from his shoulder, rolling into the chest. He picked it up, its lens now steady, and aimed it at the stars. <words>276</words>  

“Elegant mayhem,” he whispered, “works every time.” <words>285</words>  

As the first stars winked through the twilight, Corin vowed to plant a new time capsule—one filled not with lies, but with laughter, a sellsword’s promise, and the telescope’s gleaming truth. <words>305</words>  

The garden, it seemed, approved. <words>309</words>
