The groggy brewer stumbled through the iron gates of the haunted mansion graveyard, clutching a sack of hops and a flask of bitter ale. <words>21</words> He’d left the protest early, its chants muffled by the encroaching darkness that pooled in the cemetery’s cracks like spilled ink. <words>41</words> His motivation was simple: to become a living embodiment of his values—crafting beer that nourished both body and soul, not just lined corporate pockets. <words>60</words> But tonight, the protest’s lull had left him restless, and the mansion’s silhouette, uniquely generic in its decay, beckoned with a flippant solemnity. <words>80</words>  

He mounted the dusty spiral staircase inside, each step creaking a dirge. <words>90</words> Halfway up, a slight discoloration—a faint yellowish tint—caught his eye. <words>101</words> Kneeling, he brushed away cobwebs, revealing a shard of broken mirror embedded in the wood. <words>114</words> The glass reflected not his face, but a swirling void, as if the mansion itself were exhaling shadows. <words>127</words>  

“Initiate what?” he muttered, tilting the flask to his lips. <words>136</words> The ale tasted flat, like dishwater. <words>143</words> Below, the protest’s voices surged again, a tide of anger and hope. <words>153</words> He’d joined to fight apathy, to prove that even a groggy brewer could matter. <words>164</words> But here, in the mansion’s throat, his values felt abstract, diluted. <words>175</words>  

The mirror shard trembled. <words>181</words> A cold draft seeped through the staircase, carrying whispers in languages he didn’t recognize. <words>193</words> He gripped the glass tighter, its edges biting his palm. <words>202</words> “Show me,” he said, not sure if he meant the mirror or himself. <words>211</words>  

The discoloration spread, a sickly hue creeping up the banister. <words>221</words> The darkness thickened, and for a moment, he saw through it—not to the other side, but to the *absence* of sides, a place where values dissolved into static. <words>237</words> He laughed, a barking sound, and hurled the shard down the stairs. <words>247</words> It shattered, echoing like a gunshot. <words>254</words>  

The protest’s roar faded. <words>260</words> In the silence, he realized the mansion wasn’t haunted by ghosts, but by the fear of becoming generic, of letting the world’s noise erase what made him unique. <words>279</words> His ale, his protests, his stubbornness—they were all shards of the same mirror. <words>290</words>  

He descended, stepping over the glass. <words>298</words> The graveyard’s air smelled of wet earth and iron. <words>307</words> The protest’s voices swelled again, clearer now, as if the mansion had lent him its silence to listen. <words>320</words> He’d return tomorrow, kegs in hand, to share his beer and his story. <words>331</words> Let the darkness encroach; he’d brew light. <words>340</words>  

As he exited, the staircase’s discoloration vanished, leaving only dust and the faintest scent of hops. <words>356</words> The mansion grinned, its secret safe for now. <words>364</words>
