In Kaleidoscope Park, before the first lie was told, the reaver known as Vex stood beneath a willow tree, its branches weaving fractal shadows over his closed-off heart. <words>22</words> His boots crunched gravel as he paced, muttering to himself, “Stars taste of iron and old wine, but you’ll never know.” <words>40</words> A crumpled child’s drawing fluttered at his feet—a stick-figure family, the mother’s head a sunburst, the father’s a crescent moon, both grinning charmingly grotesque, their limbs askew. <words>67</words> Vex kicked it, but the paper unfolded, revealing scrawled poems in the margins: *“Daddy says the sky’s a lie, but Mama’s kiss is true.”* <words>88</words>  

He snorted. “Pathetic.” Yet he pocketed the drawing, its edges sharp as regret. <words>102</words> Generational patterns, he thought—his father had scoffed at poetry, his mother at love, and here he was, a reaver who’d never tasted a kiss not laced with spite. <words>126</words> The park’s carousel played a tune like fractured glass, its horses painted in hues that shifted under the sun. <words>143</words> A girl in a polka-dot dress approached, her voice syrup-sweet. “Mister, you dropped something!” She held up the drawing, her fingers smudged with charcoal. <words>165</words>  

Vex glared. “Keep it.” But she pressed it into his palm, her grin a mimicry of the drawing’s sunburst. <words>182</words> “My mama says poems are for people who’re scared to say things straight,” she chirped. <words>198</words> He felt a nagging in his chest, familiar as a rusted knife. “And what do *you* say, brat?” <words>214</words>  

She tilted her head. “I say you’re lonely.” Then she skipped away, her laughter a silver bell. <words>231</words> Vex stared at the drawing. The father’s crescent-moon face had a tear drawn beneath it, the ink blotted like a wound. <words>248</words> He scribbled in the margin: *“The sky lies, but your kiss—ah, your kiss might be the truth I choke on.”* <words>270</words>  

The park’s light began to warp, colors bleeding into one another as dusk approached. <words>287</words> Vex’s motivation crystallized: to taste the stars in a single kiss, to break the cycle of his family’s grotesque charm. <words>309</words> He found the girl again, her mother humming beside a fountain. <words>322</words> “Teach me,” he growled, shoving the drawing at her. “Teach me to lie like your poems.” <words>340</words>  

She giggled. “You’re bad at lying, mister. Your eyes say *please*.” <words>357</words> He flinched. The mother glanced up, her gaze sharp. “You want stars? Climb the Ferris wheel at midnight. But kisses…” She trailed off, smiling mockingly affectionate. “Those are for fools who still believe the sky’s worth the fall.” <words>390</words>  

Vex’s fist clenched. The drawing crinkled in his grip. *Generational patterns*, he thought. *Break them.* <words>408</words> At midnight, he rode the Ferris wheel alone, the stars sharp as splinters. <words>423</words> When the girl appeared in the seat behind him, he didn’t flinch. “You nag like your poems,” he muttered. <words>440</words> She leaned forward, her breath warm. “Kiss me, and I’ll stop.” <words>453</words>  

He did. It tasted of iron and old wine, but also of something sweeter—a lie he almost believed. <words>470</words> The drawing fluttered from his pocket, its poems glowing faintly in the dark. <words>485</words>
