The insomniac poet, Elias, kept a haunted attic as his sanctuary, where moth-eaten couches and cobwebbed lamps clashed with the meticulously messy piles of botanical samples he’d collected from graveyards and abandoned gardens. <words>32</words> Each jar, labeled in frayed script, held petals or roots that hummed with secrets he could almost hear. <words>45</words> Between subway stops—those liminal minutes when the world blurred—he’d scribble verses about the “warnings in whispers” he swore the samples emitted, their fragility a language of survival. <words>72</words>  

Tonight, the attic reeked of whiskey and decay. Elias had dragged three strangers upstairs after a poetry reading, their laughter shaky as they slumped on his threadbare couch. <words>96</words> “You want truth?” he slurred, sloshing bourbon into a chipped teacup. “These plants… they know how to *eliminate* threats without violence. Just… listen.” <words>123</words> He gestured to a jar of wilted nightshade, its berries shriveled like tiny fists. “They whisper methods. Subtle. Poisonous, but not to the soul.” <words>147</words>  

The guests exchanged glances. One, a woman with a tattooed collarbone, leaned in. “Whispers? Dude, you’re wasted.” <words>163</words> Elias’s grin sharpened. “Wasted on *clarity*,” he hissed, unscrewing the jar. “The nightshade says: *root yourself in stillness. Let predators wither from boredom*.” <words>189</words> He tossed back the bourbon, throat burning. The attic’s shadows seemed to pulse, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath. <words>208</words>  

“You’re insane,” muttered the man beside him, but Elias kept talking, voice fraying. “The dandelion seeds—they *scream* when you blow them. *Scatter! Hide!* But the roots… they stay. Patient. Unyielding.” <words>241</words> He slammed the jar down, spilling liquid onto a stack of notebooks. The woman laughed, high and nervous. “So your ‘power of non-violence’ is… waiting?” <words>265</words>  

Elias stood, swaying. “Yes! To *eliminate* harm, you must first… *contain* it. Let it rage in a jar. Let it whisper itself hoarse.” <words>291</words> The guests rose, murmuring excuses. As they fled, Elias collapsed onto the couch, clutching a jar of dried lavender. Its scent was faint, almost gone. <words>316</words>  

In the silence, he realized the attic’s emptiness felt heavier now—a hollow abundance. The botanical samples, once vibrant with imagined warnings, seemed suddenly inert. <words>342</words> Had he drunk too much, or had the plants finally fallen silent? He didn’t know. But as the subway rumble faded beneath the floorboards, Elias smiled. <words>367</words> Maybe non-violence wasn’t about power at all. Maybe it was just… listening. Waiting. Letting the world’s chaos dissolve into the quiet of a jar. <words>392</words>  

He drifted off, the attic’s ghosts humming lullabies. Somewhere between stations, the nightshade whispered again. This time, Elias didn’t flinch. <words>416</words>
