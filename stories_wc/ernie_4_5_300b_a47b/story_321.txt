The infernal kitchen’s ovens roared like wounded beasts, their flames licking the ceiling with sulfuric tongues. <words>13</words>  
Distracted guard Veyra paced between the cauldrons, her boots scuffing the obsidian floor, while a partial spool of crimson ribbon—all that remained of a forgotten sacrifice—tumbled in her pocket. <words>30</words>  
She had been tasked with monitoring the “apology ovens,” where sins were baked into ash, but her mind drifted to the cosmic silence that had swallowed her brother’s last words. <words>40</words>  
Forgiveness, the kitchen’s overseer had hissed, required almost radical action: not just confession, but displacement of the guilt itself. <words>28</words>  
Veyra’s fingers found the ribbon, its frayed edge catching on her calluses. <words>10</words>  
In the space where an apology waited unspoken, she’d learned to read the swirling patterns inside the dreamlike hourglass perched on the central stove—a relic that showed not time, but the weight of unatoned sins. <words>38</words>  
“Move faster,” growled the overseer, his voice a grater against her nerves. <words>13</words>  
Veyra’s reply was abrasive calm. “I’m clarifying the hourglass. The patterns are… stuck.” <words>16</words>  
He sneered but didn’t challenge her; the kitchen’s rules demanded obedience to those who manipulated its tools. <words>17</words>  
She tilted the hourglass, watching the sand shift—a storm of black and gold. <words>12</words>  
Her brother’s face flickered in the chaos, his final scream muted by the void. <words>14</words>  
To outmaneuver cosmic silence, she’d need to displace the guilt lodged in her chest. <words>14</words>  
The ribbon, she realized, was the key. <words>6</words>  
She unraveled it, thread by thread, letting the strands slip into the hourglass. <words>13</words>  
The sand reacted instantly, whirling into a vortex that pulled her breath away. <words>14</words>  
“What are you doing?!” the overseer barked, lunging toward her. <words>11</words>  
Veyra didn’t flinch. “Forgiveness isn’t a transaction,” she said, her voice steady. “It’s a rebellion.” <words>16</words>  
The hourglass shattered, its glass embedding in her palms like stigmata. <words>12</words>  
But the sand, now free, surged upward, forming a bridge of light across the kitchen. <words>14</words>  
The ovens dimmed. The air thickened with the scent of burnt regret. <words>13</words>  
Veyra’s brother stood at the bridge’s end, his form flickering like a candle flame. <words>14</words>  
“You didn’t listen,” he said, not accusingly, but wearily. <words>10</words>  
“I’m listening now,” she replied, stepping forward. <words>8</words>  
The cosmic silence trembled, then fractured. <words>7</words>  
Her apology, unspoken for decades, dissolved into the light. <words>11</words>  
The overseer howled, but his rage was drowned by the hourglass’s final whisper: *Enough*. <words>15</words>  
Veyra walked the bridge, the ribbon’s remnants trailing behind her like a banner. <words>14</words>  
The price of forgiveness, she understood now, wasn’t penance or pain. <words>13</words>  
It was the courage to displace the old world, to clarify the chaos into something new. <words>17</words>  
At the bridge’s end, her brother smiled, and the infernal kitchen faded to ash. <words>15</words>
