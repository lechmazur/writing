The hanging orchard in the ravine, battered by autumn storms, sagged under the weight of apples like bruised lanterns. <words>16</words> Elias, a conscientious objector soldier with a rusty nail tucked in his boot for “luck,” paced the orchard’s edge, bored valiantly by the craft fairs that had overrun the neighborhood. <words>35</words> Each weekend, vendors sold honeyed cider and woven baskets, their stalls flanked by signs for the “Xenial Neighborhood Watch”—a euphemism for the town’s vigilante patrols. <words>53</words> Elias’s father had founded the watch decades ago, a tradition tied to Samhain, the holiday when the veil between worlds thinned and migrants were said to vanish. <words>69</words>  

“You’re late,” muttered Mrs. Greer, the watch’s matron, her coy malevolence hidden behind a smile. <words>21</words> She handed him a flashlight, its beam slicing through the orchard’s mist. <words>14</words> Elias’s task was to map migration routes, a duty his father had drilled into him: *“The ravine’s a funnel. Know the paths, know the threats.”* But Elias saw no threats—only a family legacy of paranoia. <words>43</words>  

He wandered deeper, the rusty nail biting into his heel. <words>13</words> The orchard’s trees creaked, their branches knitting a canopy that filtered the craft fair’s distant music into a dissonant hum. <words>26</words> At the ravine’s heart, he found a cluster of tents—migrants, he assumed, seeking shelter. <words>20</words> Their campfires flickered like defiant stars. <words>8</words>  

“Xenial greetings,” a voice called. <words>6</words> A man emerged, holding a lantern. <words>6</words> His accent was thick, his smile wary. <words>7</words> Elias froze. The watch’s rules were clear: *“Offer help, but never linger.”* Yet the man’s daughter, clutching a doll, reminded him of his sister. <words>28</words>  

“We’re lost,” the man said. <words>5</words> “The storms… they took the trails.” <words>8</words> Elias glanced at the rusty nail. <words>6</words> His father would’ve reported them. <words>6</words> Instead, he pulled a crumpled map from his pocket—a family heirloom, its edges frayed from generations of use. <words>24</words> “This way,” he said, pointing. <words>6</words> “But hurry. The watch…” He trailed off, the coy malevolence in his tone betraying his unease. <words>21</words>  

As they walked, the man spoke of journeys, of borders that shifted like sand. <words>15</words> Elias listened, the nail’s presence a silent rebuke to his father’s ghost. <words>17</words> At the ravine’s exit, the man pressed a small apple into his hand. <words>15</words> “For luck,” he said. <words>4</words>  

Back at the craft fair, Mrs. Greer eyed the apple. <words>9</words> “You smell of strangers,” she hissed. <words>8</words> Elias shrugged, the nail’s rust flaking onto his boot. <words>12</words> That night, he added a new route to the map—a detour through the orchard, marked with a tiny nail. <words>22</words>  

The watch would never notice. <words>6</words> They were too busy valiantly guarding ghosts. <words>10</words>
