The grumpy crypt caretaker, Alaric, hunched over the witch’s crystal scrying room, his boots crunching gravel beneath a vaulted ceiling etched with constellations. <words>22</words> Each night, he stargazed through the room’s fractured stained glass, seeking patterns to quell the uprising within—a restlessness born of centuries guarding the unquiet dead. <words>45</words> Tonight, he clutched an unmarked cardboard tube, its weight unfamiliar in his gnarled hands, a relic left by a novice who’d fled weeks prior. <words>67</words>

“Multiply singular,” he muttered, the witch’s last cryptic advice echoing. <words>75</words> The tube’s purpose gnawed at him; it hummed faintly, as if resonating with the sand mandala sprawled before him, a temporary altar of colored grains swirling into fractal beauty. <words>98</words> Alaric had always dismissed such rituals as folly, but tonight, desperation loosened his scorn. <words>112</words>

He jiggled the tube, its contents rattling like dry bones. <words>121</words> The sand shifted, responding to the vibration, morphing into a spiral that mirrored the night sky’s shifting stars. <words>138</words> A memory surfaced: a child, centuries dead, whose laughter had once filled these halls before a plague silenced it. <words>156</words> The trauma of that loss, buried beneath layers of duty, throbbed anew. <words>171</words>

“Show me,” Alaric growled, jiggling the tube harder. <words>179</words> The mandala’s patterns quickened, forming a map of his own psyche—a labyrinth of grief, rage, and guilt. <words>196</words> Each grain multiplied, singular sorrows amplifying into a chorus. <words>209</words> He saw the novice’s fear, the witch’s detachment, his own hardened heart. <words>223</words>

The tube’s hum crescendoed, and the mandala erupted into a storm of light. <words>237</words> Alaric flinched, but the room held, the crystals amplifying the spectacle. <words>251</words> In the chaos, he glimpsed the truth: his trauma was not a cage but a compass. <words>268</words> The uprising within was not rebellion but a call to remember, to feel. <words>284</words>

He stopped jiggling the tube. The sand settled, revealing a path through the labyrinth. <words>298</words> Alaric’s breath hitched. For the first time in centuries, he wept—not for the dead, but for the living man he’d become. <words>317</words> The witch’s grandiose subtlety had worked: trauma, when multiplied and examined, became a bridge, not a barrier. <words>338</words>

As dawn approached, the mandala dissolved, its grains scattering like stardust. <words>352</words> Alaric placed the tube beside the scrying pool, its mystery unraveled. <words>366</words> The uprising within had quieted, replaced by a fragile peace. <words>379</words> He left the room, his steps lighter, the constellations above whispering approval. <words>395</words>

In the crypt below, the dead shifted in their sleep, sensing the caretaker’s transformed spirit. <words>412</words> Alaric smiled, a rare gesture. Trauma, he realized, was not a singular wound but a tapestry—complex, painful, and, when woven with courage, beautiful. <words>436</words>
