The antique brass key burned in Mara’s palm as she crouched on the rusted rails of the abandoned carnival’s roller coaster, its jagged teeth biting into her skin like a warning. <words>20</words> She’d stolen it from the cryptkeeper’s desk minutes ago, during her latest astral projection—a skill she’d honed for years, slipping between worlds to scavenge survival tools. <words>42</words> But now, in the flesh, the key’s weight felt different, heavier, as if it knew her secret: she wasn’t just a thief. <words>58</words> She was a fugitive from a reality where compassion was a liability.  

The revelation hit her in the seconds after she’d unlocked the crypt’s hidden door. <words>72</words> Inside, instead of treasure, she’d found a ledger detailing the carnival’s true purpose: a training ground for soul-harvesters, beings who fed on fear. <words>90</words> Her astral projections had been observed. They were coming for her.  

“Sometimes always,” she muttered, a mantra from her mentor, a rogue projector who’d taught her to blend practice with chaos. <words>114</words> The phrase meant survival wasn’t about perfection—it was about adapting, *sometimes* following rules, *always* trusting instinct. <words>130</words> Now, instinct screamed: *flee*.  

She tracked the sun’s shadow across the coaster’s tracks, its angle sharpening as the hour neared noon. <words>150</words> The shadows pointed west, toward the old funhouse, where a tunnel emerged into the woods. <words>165</words> If she could reach it before the harvesters materialized, she’d vanish into the astral plane, untraceable.  

But the key—why had she taken it? Compassion, unyielding as the rails beneath her. <words>187</words> The cryptkeeper had been kind to strays, leaving bread by the gate. Mara couldn’t let him die for her mistake.  

A low hum vibrated through the air. The harvesters.  

She ran, boots clanging, the key clutched to her chest. <words>211</words> The funhouse loomed, its painted face cracked like a grin. Inside, the tunnel’s mouth yawned, dark and promising. <words>228</words> She slipped in, the key’s brass cold against her racing heart.  

The hum grew louder.  

In the tunnel’s center, she pressed the key into a rusted lock hidden beneath a floorboard. <words>252</words> The board sprang open, revealing a map of astral seams—escape routes only a projector could see. <words>268</words> *Preserve survival skills*, her mentor’s voice echoed. *Share them wisely*.  

Mara hesitated. The harvesters were seconds away. But the cryptkeeper’s face flashed in her mind—his quiet smiles, the way he’d never asked for anything. <words>292</words> She tore the map into thirds, stuffing two pieces into her pockets and leaving one on the floor. <words>308</words> Let the harvesters chase ghosts.  

The first tendril of darkness coiled at the tunnel’s entrance. Mara closed her eyes, focusing on the sun’s shadow, now a blade slicing east. <words>330</words> She projected, her body dissolving into stardust, the key’s weight fading to nothing.  

When she rematerialized in the woods, the map’s thirds burned holes in her pockets. <words>352</words> The cryptkeeper would live. The harvesters would hunt her forever. But sometimes always, compassion meant choosing others first. <words>373</words> She smiled, a practiced, spontaneous thing, and vanished into the trees.
