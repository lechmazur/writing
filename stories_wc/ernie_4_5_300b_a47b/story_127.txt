The steampunk lounge hummed with brass gears and the clink of absinthe glasses, but Marlowe’s fingers trembled on his accordion keys. <words>17</words> Between calls for tips, he glanced at the rusted knight’s gauntlet strapped to his thigh—a relic from a battle he’d never truly fought. <words>33</words> Creatively blocked for weeks, his music had become a hollow imitation of the vibrant tunes he once spun. <words>47</words>  

Across the room, Lady Voss leaned against a copper-plated bar, her silver cane tapping a rhythm that mocked his silence. <words>60</words> She was his sworn adversary, a rival inventor whose airships had once nearly destroyed his family’s legacy. <words>73</words> Yet tonight, Marlowe’s secret burned brighter: the gauntlet wasn’t armor but a key, its grooves mapping a coral reef’s texture—a code only he could decipher. <words>91</words>  

He remembered the night he’d found it, submerged in a bioluminescent lagoon, the coral’s ridges mirroring the gears of his father’s lost workshop. <words>106</words> The memory surged like a tide, sharp and suffocating. <words>113</words> To offer peace, he’d need to trust her with the truth. <words>120</words>  

“Play something real,” Lady Voss called, her voice a blade wrapped in velvet. <words>129</words> The crowd’s laughter faded as Marlowe closed his eyes, letting the gauntlet’s rust bite into his palm. <words>140</words> He imagined the reef’s jagged surface, its crevices filled with secrets. <words>148</words> The accordion’s reeds sighed, and he played—not the polished anthems of the lounge, but the raw, discordant hymn of the reef. <words>163</words>  

Lady Voss’s cane stilled. <words>166</words> Her gaze locked on the gauntlet, recognition flickering. <words>173</words> “You’ve seen the *Siren’s Maw*,” she breathed, not a question but a plea. <words>181</words> The reef’s texture had unlocked her own blocked designs, years ago. <words>189</words>  

Marlowe’s music swelled, the melody now a bridge. <words>195</words> Between calls for another drink, he slid the gauntlet onto the bar. <words>203</words> “The reef’s code… it’s a map,” he said, coded desperation threading his voice. <words>212</words> “To a place where our families’ wars can end.” <words>219</words>  

Lady Voss’s fingers brushed the gauntlet’s rust, her touch gentle. <words>227</words> “You’re asking me to trust you?” she murmured. <words>234</words> “After everything?” <words>237</words>  

“I’m asking us to remember,” he replied. <words>243</words> The reef’s texture had shown him: peace wasn’t a surrender but a reconstruction. <words>254</words>  

She nodded, once, and the lounge’s gears seemed to sigh in relief. <words>262</words> “Then let’s rebuild,” she said, her cane tapping a new rhythm—this time, a duet. <words>273</words>  

Marlowe’s block shattered. <words>277</words> The accordion roared, and the crowd erupted, unaware of the trust renewed in the space between two notes. <words>290</words>  

Later, as the lounge emptied, Lady Voss lingered. <words>297</words> “The *Maw*’s coral… it’s dying,” she said, her tone softer. <words>305</words> “We’ll need your gauntlet to save it.” <words>311</words>  

Marlowe smiled, the gauntlet’s weight a comfort. <words>317</words> “Then we’ll start tonight.” <words>321</words>  

The reef’s code had given him more than a map—it had given him back his voice. <words>332</words> And maybe, finally, peace. <words>337</words>
