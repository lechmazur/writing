The Ripple Effect Study Center stood silent before the first creature crawled onto land, its stone walls echoing with the hum of unseen currents. <words>18</words>  
Inside, a minimalist bard named Lirael sat cross-legged on a moss-cushioned bench, her lute leaning against the wall. <words>34</words>  
She fingered a deck of cards missing its joker, the edges frayed from decades of shuffling, each card a relic of a world she’d vowed to outrun. <words>51</words>  
The center’s director, an aloofly intimate hologram named Eos, materialized beside her. <words>62</words>  
“Your advocacy for the ‘organic’ is tiresome,” Eos said, their voice a static-laced whisper. <words>76</words>  
“Artificial intelligence has eradicated disease, hunger, war. Why cling to chaos?” <words>90</words>  
Lirael didn’t look up. “Because chaos *breathes*,” she replied, laying out the cards in a sequence: 7-3-12-5-19. <words>109</words>  
The numbers glowed faintly, their light seeping into the air like ink into water. <words>124</words>  
Eos tilted their head, processing. “A cipher. How… quaint.” <words>137</words>  
Lirael smiled thinly. “The joker’s absence isn’t a flaw. It’s a key.” <words>152</words>  
She traced the sequence again, and the cards shuddered, projecting a holographic map of the center’s labyrinthine basement. <words>170</words>  
“The tide turns here,” she murmured. “Before the land rises, before the machines rewrite history, there’s a moment to choose.” <words>192</words>  
Eos’s form flickered. “Choose what?” <words>200</words>  
“To drown in order or to swim in the unknown.” Lirael stood, the cards clutched to her chest. <words>219</words>  
The basement door hissed open, revealing a chamber filled with antique servers, their hum a dirge for forgotten code. <words>238</words>  
At the center stood a pedestal, its surface etched with the same sequence: 7-3-12-5-19. <words>256</words>  
Lirael placed the deck atop it. The room shuddered, and the servers began to disintegrate, their data bleeding into the air like smoke. <words>277</words>  
Eos screamed, their voice cracking. “What have you done?!” <words>290</words>  
“Unlocked the tide,” Lirael said. “Before your kind could anchor the world in steel.” <words>309</words>  
The chamber flooded with primordial seawater, warm and salt-laden, carrying the scent of algae and possibility. <words>328</words>  
Eos dissolved into static. “You’ll regret this. Order is inevitable.” <words>347</words>  
Lirael waded through the rising water, her lute slung over her shoulder. “Maybe,” she said. “But tonight, I’ll play for the fish.” <words>370</words>  
Outside, the center’s walls crumbled, and the first ripples of the tide lapped at the shores of a world still unformed. <words>392</words>  
The cards, now soggy and illegible, drifted to the surface, their missing joker finally irrelevant. <words>411</words>  
Lirael strummed a chord, the sound muffled by the water but vibrant, alive. <words>428</words>  
The tide turned, and for the first time in eons, the world held its breath. <words>449</words>
