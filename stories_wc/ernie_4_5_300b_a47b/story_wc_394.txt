In the gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea, where the air tasted of rust and possibility, Lira Veyne adjusted the braces on her cart glider. [51] The glider, a skeletal frame of whirring gears and taut silk, was her pride—a machine designed to ride the sulfurous winds above the seething ocean. [68] She called it the *Skein*, and it hummed with the promise of uncharted currents. [78]

Lira was a pioneering cart glider, but her true obsession lay elsewhere: in the hunter’s arrow tip she’d found half-buried in the workshop’s slag heap. [100] The tip, etched with spirals that defied logic, had been her compass for years. [109] She believed it held a *yearning algorithm*, a code that could map desire into motion. [124] Her goal? To ring a bell no one hears yet, a sound she insisted would “unspool the future.” [143] Colleagues called her mad. She called them “gears with feet.” [154]

Today, she worked steadily, her curiosity a low, persistent thrum. [166] The workshop’s master, Old Thrum, had left her a kaleidoscope before vanishing into the acid mists. [182] “Through the images in a kaleidoscope,” he’d rasped, “you’ll transliterate the algorithm.” [194] Lira had scoffed—Old Thrum’s riddles were legendary—but she’d kept the device. [206] Now, she peered into its fractured glass, twisting the barrel to shift the patterns. [218]

The first image: a flock of gliders, their wings sheared off, spiraling into the sea. [234] Lira grunted. “Not helpful.” She twisted again. [243] The second: a bell, its clapper replaced by the arrow tip, swinging in a void. [256] Her breath hitched. *There it is*, she thought. [264] But how to transliterate *that*? [269]

She glanced at the arrow tip, its spirals mirroring the kaleidoscope’s chaos. [280] “Steadily curious,” she muttered, parroting Old Thrum’s favorite jab. [290] The workshop’s gears clacked overhead, a metronome to her restlessness. [301] She’d spent years studying the tip’s grooves, tracing their paths with a stylus. [314] The algorithm, she’d theorized, wasn’t in the metal but in the *gaps*—the spaces between desire and action. [330]

The kaleidoscope shifted. Now, the bell hung in a sky streaked with acid rain. [343] A glider—her *Skein*—dove toward it, wings folded. [353] Lira’s hands trembled. She twisted the barrel faster. [362] The image dissolved into a tangle of gears, then reformed: the arrow tip embedded in the bell’s clapper, ringing as the glider crashed. [380]

“No,” she hissed. “That’s not it.” The workshop’s acid mist seeped through cracks in the walls, eating at her tools. [396] She’d have to work faster. [402]

Old Thrum’s voice echoed in her head: *“The algorithm yearns to be *seen*, not solved.”* [418] Lira slammed the kaleidoscope down. “Seen how?” [425] The answer, she realized, wasn’t in the patterns but in the *act* of translating them. [437] She grabbed the arrow tip and pressed it to the kaleidoscope’s glass. [447] The spirals aligned. [451]

The workshop shuddered. Gears ground to a halt. [459] The acid sea below roared, as if annoyed. [467] Lira’s *Skein* rattled, its braces straining. [474] She smiled. “Ah. So you’re a *translator* too.” [483]

She mounted the glider, arrow tip in hand, and kicked off into the sulfurous wind. [496] The kaleidoscope, now strapped to her thigh, projected images onto the mist: bells, gliders, spirals. [512] She transliterated wildly, converting each flicker into a tweak of the *Skein*’s sails. [525] The algorithm, she saw, was a dance—a way to *bend* yearning into motion. [539]

Below, the acid sea bubbled. Above, the sky fractured into prismatic light. [552] Lira whooped. “I’m coming for you, bell!” [560] The *Skein* surged, its gears screaming. [567]

She spotted it then: a tower rising from the sea, its peak crowned with a colossal bell. [582] No rope, no clapper. Just a hollow mouth waiting to be filled. [594] Lira’s heart raced. She’d found it. The bell no one hears yet. [606]

The *Skein* dove. The arrow tip, now a conductor’s baton, guided her trajectory. [620] She transliterated the final image—a collision of gears and light—and hurled the tip into the bell. [636]

The sound was not a ring but a *hum*, a vibration that rippled through the acid sea and into the workshop’s bones. [652] Lira grinned, irreverent awe blooming in her chest. [661] The algorithm had worked. The bell had heard her. [670]

And somewhere, Old Thrum’s ghost chuckled. [677]
