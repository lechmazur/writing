Lieutenant Corwin Voss clutched the ship’s rail, bile rising as the *HMS Luminous* pitched through storm-lashed waves. <words>12</words> For three centuries, his family had served the Crown, yet here he was, seasick and clinging to a mission no one believed in: to find the crystal fortress at the end of Rainbow Canyon, where the moon’s phases allegedly revealed traded secrets. <words>35</words> The crew muttered about ghosts and curses, but Corwin’s motive burned brighter—he needed to confront the mirror before it lied again, as it had to his ancestor in 1642, when a reflection’s whisper doomed a fleet. <words>64</words>

The canyon’s entrance shimmered like a prism, its walls carved from quartz that hummed with ancient light. <words>75</words> Corwin stumbled ashore, clutching a translucent ghost orchid bulb—a relic from the ship’s hold, its petals glowing faintly, as if aware of its role. <words>92</words> The fortress loomed ahead, its spires fracturing the sunlight into rainbows that danced across his face, awkwardly charming in their fleeting beauty. <words>109</words> He’d always been clumsy with words, but here, in this place of echoes, he felt the weight of time pressing down. <words>125</words>

Inside, the air tasted of ozone and memory. <words>133</words> Walls of living crystal pulsed with lunar cycles, their glow shifting from silver to indigo as the moon rose. <words>147</words> Corwin placed the orchid bulb on a pedestal, and the room shuddered. <words>157</words> A holographic mirror materialized, its surface rippling like water. <words>164</words> “You’ve come to trade secrets,” it intoned, voice layered with centuries of disdain. <words>174</words>

“I’ve come to end the lies,” Corwin shot back, nostalgic defiance sharpening his tone. <words>184</words> He’d studied the moon’s phases, tracked their influence on the orchid’s growth—a method passed down through generations, half-forgotten and misunderstood. <words>199</words> The bulb began to dissolve, its essence seeping into the crystal floor. <words>209</words> “Transform,” the mirror hissed, “or repeat the past.” <words>218</words>

Corwin closed his eyes, recalling his grandfather’s tales of sailors who’d vanished here, their secrets devoured by the fortress. <words>232</words> When he opened them, the room had shifted. <words>239</words> The mirror now showed not his reflection, but a fleet of ships—his ancestor’s command—sinking beneath a storm conjured by a reflected lie. <words>256</words> “You see?” the mirror taunted. “Your family’s curse is eternal.” <words>267</words>

But Corwin grinned, awkwardly charming in his triumph. <words>274</words> “No,” he said, “it ends here.” He slammed his palm against the pedestal, triggering a lunar alignment. <words>288</words> The orchid’s light flared, and the fortress trembled. <words>296</words> The mirror cracked, its lies spilling out as shards of glass. <words>305</words>

In the quiet longing of centuries, Corwin had transformed the fortress—and himself. <words>316</words> The canyon’s rainbows faded, but he carried the truth now, a weight lighter than guilt. <words>328</words> As he sailed away, the ghost orchid’s glow lingered in his mind, a reminder that some secrets, once traded, could set you free. <words>347</words>
