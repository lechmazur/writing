In the cradle of a whispered minute, where time curled like smoke, the oracle Lirael adjusted her brass compass, its needle trembling between dimensions. <words>23</words> She was fact-minded, her mind a library of coordinates, yet her hands shook—a desperation she masked with a desperately casual shrug. <words>44</words> “Forgotten places,” she muttered, the compass humming as if agreeing. <words>54</words>  

The dimension around her frayed at the edges, reality a tapestry unraveling. Lirael had spent lifetimes charting its instabilities, but today, her compass spun wildly, drawn not to geography, but to emotion. <words>76</words> A vision struck: a lover’s face, contorted in grief, their heartbreak a seismic wave rippling through dimensions. <words>90</words> Lirael gasped, clutching the compass. “Empathy,” she realized, “is the path.”  

She’d always dismissed empathy as chaotic, a variable too messy for her equations. <words>111</words> But the vision lingered—a man named Kael, his world shattered by loss, his sorrow a beacon. <words>124</words> To find forgotten places, she needed to *recompose* her logic, to let heartbreak’s raw energy guide her. <words>140</words>  

“Optimism is a compass too,” she told herself, though her voice wavered. <words>152</words> She stepped through a tear in reality, landing in Kael’s crumbling study. <words>164</words> Books floated midair, ink bleeding from frayed pages. Kael knelt amid the chaos, clutching a locket. <words>178</words> Lirael’s fact-minded heart recoiled at the mess, but her compass pulsed, urging her closer. <words>192</words>  

“You’re real,” Kael said, not looking up. His voice was sandpaper. <words>204</words> “I’m here to help you remember,” Lirael replied, her tone desperately casual to hide the tremor in her chest. <words>220</words> She knelt, placing the compass between them. Its needle spun, then stilled, pointing not north, but *inward*. <words>236</words>  

Kael’s grief flooded her—a visceral, aching empathy. She saw his lost love, felt his regret, and in that shared pain, the dimension stabilized. <words>255</words> Forgotten places emerged: a garden where time slowed, a library of unspoken words, a bridge between hearts. <words>271</words> Lirael’s compass now glowed, its brass warmed by collective sorrow. <words>284</words>  

“Empathy isn’t weakness,” Kael whispered, finally meeting her gaze. “It’s the map.” <words>298</words> Lirael nodded, tears pricking her eyes. She’d found her purpose: to navigate not just space, but the human heart. <words>314</words>  

As the dimension solidified, Lirael recomposed her approach. Facts were still her anchor, but now, heartbreak-induced visions were her compass. <words>333</words> She smiled, a gesture so rare it felt foreign. “Next stop,” she said, “the cradle of another whispered minute.” <words>353</words>  

The compass spun, and she followed, optimistic in her desperation, her path forever altered by the weight of another’s sorrow. <words>374</words>  

In the end, the oracle learned that to find forgotten places, one must first lose themselves—in empathy. <words>390</words>
