Marshal Elinor Voss had never believed in omens—until the fortune cookie slip fluttered into her lap during lunch at the Floating Island Cloud Spa’s rooftop café. <words>19</words> “Unexpected alliances bloom where duty fears to tread,” it read, crinkled and ink-smudged. <words>33</words> She crumpled it, but not before noticing the spa’s resident botanist, Jaxon, eyeing her from across the mist-shrouded garden. <words>49</words> Her duty was clear: recover the stolen rare manuscripts hidden somewhere in the spa’s labyrinthine cloud gardens before the festival’s end. <words>67</words> But Jaxon, a consciously rebellious gardener who’d once defied orders to save a dying orchid, tilted his head—a gesture that made her pulse quicken. <words>87</words>  

Throughout the afternoon, as she patrolled the spa’s hanging terraces, Elinor’s mind replayed the slip. <words>101</words> The festival’s bass-heavy music thrummed below, vibrating through the cloud-mist like a heartbeat. <words>113</words> Jaxon appeared again, offering a sprig of lavender. “You’re here for the books,” he said, not a question. <words>126</words> She tensed, but he grinned. “I know where they are. But we’ll need to tilt the system.” <words>140</words>  

By dusk, they’d infiltrated the spa’s forbidden greenhouse, its glass walls steamed with humidity. <words>155</words> Jaxon’s rebellion wasn’t reckless; it was calculated. <words>164</words> He’d mapped the security grids, exploiting gaps during the festival’s light shows. <words>176</words> “They’re in the mist vents,” he whispered, adjusting a vent cover. <words>186</words> Elinor hesitated—alliances with civilians were forbidden. <words>194</words> But the manuscripts’ worth, both cultural and monetary, outweighed protocol. <words>205</words>  

As they crawled through the vents, the festival’s music swelled, a forgotten dance rhythm that made her want to move. <words>219</words> Jaxon hummed along, his voice rough but steady. “You’re not what I expected,” he said. <words>231</words> “Neither are you,” she replied, spotting a glint of parchment ahead. <words>241</words>  

The manuscripts were there, nestled in a nest of vines. <words>250</words> But as Elinor reached for them, alarms blared. <words>258</words> Jaxon cursed. “They’ve rigged the vents!” He shoved her toward a service ladder. <words>270</words> “Go! I’ll distract them.” <words>277</words>  

She didn’t leave. Instead, she tilted the ladder, using its momentum to swing into a maintenance shaft. <words>290</words> Jaxon followed, grinning. “Not bad for a marshal.” <words>299</words> Together, they evaded guards, the manuscripts secured in her jacket. <words>311</words>  

At dawn, as the festival’s final act erupted in fireworks, Elinor handed the books to her superiors. <words>325</words> Jaxon stood beside her, unapologetic. “Told you alliances work.” <words>335</words> She didn’t argue. The slip had been right: duty and rebellion could dance, if you tilted the rhythm just right. <words>352</words>  

Later, she found another fortune cookie on her desk. “The dance continues,” it said. <words>366</words> She smiled, pocketing it. The spa’s gardens, she realized, had always been a place for forgotten steps—and unexpected partners. <words>385</words>
