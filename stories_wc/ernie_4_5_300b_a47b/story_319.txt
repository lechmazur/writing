The frail guard, Kael, stood at the edge of the tidal island’s lone watchtower, his knuckles whitening around the sour-smelling alchemy phial clutched in his palm. <words>21</words>
Throughout the morning’s sorting—a ritual where prisoners were divided into those who’d serve the crown and those who’d vanish into the sea—he’d memorized the carved messages in the ancient oak’s bark, each groove a plea: *“Break the chains painted on your skin.”* <words>52</words>
His allegiance, stitched into his uniform’s faded crest, felt like a lie. The phial’s contents, a bitter elixir meant to erase memory, pulsed against his thigh, a reminder of the fate predetermined for him: to forget his sister’s face, his mother’s lullabies, and become a hollow enforcer of the king’s cruelty. <words>67</words>
But the carvings whispered of rebellion. They spoke of a tide pool hidden beneath the cliffs, where the island’s true map lay submerged, its currents a language only the resolutely wavering could decipher. <words>54</words>
Kael’s resolve wavered as he glanced at the prisoners below—gaunt figures shuffling like shadows, their painted allegiances (crimson for loyalty, ash for dissent) flaking under the salt-laden wind. He’d been one of them once, before the phial’s promise of power had corrupted him. <words>60</words>
Now, the phial burned. To drink it was to surrender to the king’s will; to hurl it into the sea was to risk everything. Yet the carvings urged him on: *“Yank the threads of fate. The tide favors the bold.”* <words>53</words>
As the sorting bell tolled, Kael stumbled down the tower’s spiral stairs, the phial’s stench clinging to his coat. Outside, the prisoners’ wails mingled with the gulls’ cries, a dissonant hymn to despair. He pressed his palm against the oak, tracing the newest carving—a crude arrow pointing west. <words>58</words>
The tide pool lay just beyond the dunes, its waters black and still. Kael waded in, the cold seeping through his boots, and plunged the phial beneath the surface. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Then the water shimmered, revealing a reflection not of his face, but of a ship anchored in the mist, its sails emblazoned with a crest he’d never seen—a phoenix rising from waves. <words>73</words>
Hope surged, bitter and bright. The carvings had been right: the painted allegiances were a cage, but the tide could dissolve them. Kael waded deeper, the phial slipping from his grip as the current tugged his coat. Somewhere beyond the island, freedom waited, fragile and real. <words>57</words>
He didn’t look back. The sorting was over. The king’s agents would hunt him, but for now, the sea carried his name, unwritten, unclaimed. And in the oak’s bark, a new message appeared: *“The wavering heart is the sharpest blade.”* <words>49</words>
