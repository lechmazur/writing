The aerial gondola creaked as it ascended the jagged peaks, its iron cables humming like a tuning fork. <words>16</words> Brother Elric, a stubborn monk with a scarred left hand, clutched a creased shipping label in his palm—the only trace of his master’s last, unanswered letter. <words>32</words> In the heartbeat after a dream returns, where memories dissolve like mist, he’d vowed to harvest the past, to pry truth from the soil of forgotten things. <words>50</words>  

The gondola’s windows framed a world of stone and snow, but Elric’s gaze fixed on the antique flute in his lap. <words>20</words> Its ivory surface was pitted and yellowed, visually unappealing yet radiating a faint, resonant warmth. <words>25</words> He’d found it in the monastery’s attic, hidden beneath a floorboard, its mouthpiece etched with faint tooth marks. <words>28</words> Master Li had never mentioned the flute, but his final dream—a vision of Elric’s own shadow, smiling as it devoured the moon—had left a hook in his mind. <words>41</words>  

“You think analyzing this relic will outsmart your reflection?” The gondola’s pilot, a wiry woman with a voice like grinding gears, glanced back. <words>28</words> Her name was Veyra, and she’d insisted the flute was cursed. <words>13</words> Elric ignored her, running his thumb over the tooth marks. <words>11</words> They weren’t random; the grooves formed a pattern, a cipher. <words>13</words>  

He’d spent nights cross-referencing the marks with monastic texts, but the answer had come in the dream’s aftermath. <words>20</words> The flute wasn’t a musical instrument—it was a key. <words>11</words> The tooth marks were a ledger, each groove representing a soul consumed by the shadow, a dark reflection of Elric’s own hunger for vengeance. <words>31</words>  

Veyra’s gondola lurched as it crossed a thermal updraft. <words>11</words> Elric’s grip tightened on the flute. <words>7</words> “My master’s shadow took him,” he muttered. <words>9</words> “I won’t let mine do the same.” <words>9</words> The shipping label fluttered, revealing a partial address: *Mountain’s Throat Monastery, Sector 7*. <words>17</words> The same sector where Master Li had vanished. <words>9</words>  

As the gondola neared the peak, Elric pressed the flute to his lips. <words>13</words> The first note was discordant, a shriek that made Veyra wince. <words>13</words> But the second note harmonized with the wind, and the third with the gondola’s groans. <words>20</words> The tooth marks glowed faintly, projecting a hologram of a shadowy figure—Elric’s double, gnawing on a soul. <words>24</words>  

“Avenge him,” the shadow hissed, its voice a mirror of Elric’s own. <words>13</words> “But first, you must become me.” <words>10</words>  

Elric spat the flute aside. <words>7</words> “No.” <words>1</words> He crumpled the shipping label, its ink smearing into a map. <words>12</words> “I’ll harvest the past, but I won’t let it feed me.” <words>13</words>  

The gondola descended into a valley where the air tasted of copper and old stone. <words>17</words> Veyra nodded, her eyes reflecting Elric’s resolve. <words>11</words> “Cautious enchantment,” she said. “That’s how you survive the mountains.” <words>16</words>  

Elric smiled, the flute’s lesson clear. <words>8</words> To outsmart his shadow, he’d need neither vengeance nor relics—only the stubbornness to let go. <words>19</words>
