The calligraphy master’s courtyard lay silent between breaths, its stone tiles still damp from dawn’s mist. <words>15</words> Kael, an arrogant swordsman with a blade that gleamed like spite, stood beneath a gnarled cherry tree, its blossoms trembling as if aware of his fury. <words>32</words> In his fist clenched a faded tapestry fragment—a relic of his family’s glory, now frayed at the edges, its threads unraveling like his patience. <words>50</words>  

“Authorize the ceremony,” he demanded, thrusting the cloth toward the master, who knelt at a lacquered desk, ink brush poised. <words>63</words> The old man’s eyes flicked to the tapestry, then to Kael’s scarred knuckles. “Your doubtfully confident tone betrays you,” he said, dipping the brush into vermilion pigment. “Shackled potential hums louder than pride.” <words>92</words>  

Kael’s jaw tightened. The tapestry depicted his ancestors wielding swords forged in celestial fire, their legacy a beacon. Yet here he stood, sword sheathed, forced to beg a calligrapher for help. <words>118</words> “My family’s light is extinguished,” he growled. “I need a spark where all lights have gone out.” <words>135</words>  

The master set the brush down. “Then sing the song.” <words>143</words>  

“*What* song?” <words>145</words>  

“The traditional ballad sung at every family wedding. The one your father hummed as he forged your blade.” The master’s voice softened, a rare crack in his stern facade. “It holds the key to unshackling what you fear to lose.” <words>180</words>  

Kael scoffed. “I am no minstrel.” <words>187</words>  

“Yet you carry their blood.” The master nodded at the tapestry. “Sing, and the threads will mend.” <words>202</words>  

Reluctantly, Kael began, his voice grating at first, then smoothing as the melody rose—a dirge turned lullaby, words of love and loss intertwining like the tapestry’s design. <words>231</words> The courtyard seemed to hold its breath, the cherry blossoms pausing mid-fall. <words>244</words>  

As the final note faded, the tapestry fragment glowed. The frayed edges stitched themselves back, colors blazing anew: crimson, gold, and silver, alive with light. <words>268</words> Kael stared, his arrogance crumbling. “How…?” <words>273</words>  

“Potential is not lost,” the master said, “merely dormant. You sought to authorize your path with a blade, but the song—*your* song—was the key.” He gestured to the tapestry. “It shows not what was, but what *could* be.” <words>315</words>  

Kael’s hand trembled as he touched the restored cloth. The figures now moved, their swords slicing through shadows, their faces his own. <words>331</words> “I thought strength was forged in silence,” he murmured. <words>339</words>  

“No,” the master replied. “In harmony.” <words>343</words>  

Harsh tenderness filled the courtyard. Kael sheathed his sword, its metal no longer his sole tongue. <words>357</words> He would learn the song’s deeper verses, let the tapestry guide his hands, and perhaps—*between breaths*—ignite a flame no storm could douse. <words>380</words>  

The master smiled, resuming his calligraphy. “Begin with the first stanza,” he said. “And mind your pitch.” <words>395</words>  

Kael grinned, a rare, genuine thing. “I’ll practice.” <words>403</words>  

The cherry blossoms drifted down, settling on the tapestry like a promise. <words>415</words>
