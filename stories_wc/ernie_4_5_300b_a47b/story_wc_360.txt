The Topaz Workshop sat cradled in a valley where the stars bled into the horizon, their light thinned by the hour between vanishing constellations. [34] Inside, the air smelled of burnt sapphire and iron filings, and the only illumination came from a halo fragment suspended in a glass case—a shard of celestial metal that pulsed like a half-remembered heartbeat. [62] Elias, the cryptic letterpress operator, adjusted his brass goggles and traced a finger along the fragment’s jagged edge, his mind racing with equations he couldn’t solve. [88] He’d always believed emotions were just variables in a grand, unseen formula, and tonight, he intended to test his theory. [107]

Elias habitually borrowed personalities like others borrowed books, slipping into the cadence of a stranger’s voice or the posture of a passing merchant. [133] It wasn’t pretense; it was method. By mirroring others, he hoped to isolate the mathematical patterns beneath their feelings—the sine waves of joy, the fractals of grief. [163] But the halo fragment, salvaged from a cratered moon where angels were said to have fought, resisted his calculations. [182] Its light flickered when he approached, as if sensing his intent. [195]

“You’re late,” a voice rasped. [199] The workshop’s owner, a withered alchemist named Veyra, emerged from the shadows, her eyes reflecting the fragment’s glow. [220] She’d warned him against meddling with the artifact, but Elias had dismissed her caution as superstition. [240] “It’s not a tool,” she’d said. “It’s a mirror.” He’d laughed. Mirrors didn’t solve equations. [261]

Now, he positioned his letterpress—a hulking machine of gears and inkwells—beside the fragment. [280] His plan was to transpose empathy onto paper, using the fragment’s energy to imprint emotional wavelengths onto ink. [304] But first, he needed to disorient the artifact’s defenses. [317] Deliberate ambiguity, he decided, was the key. If the fragment perceived no clear threat, it might lower its guard. [340]

He began by reciting a poem in a language he’d invented, its syntax looping like a Möbius strip. [360] The fragment’s light dimmed, then brightened, as if confused. [373] Elias smiled. Good. Confusion was a solvent for certainty. [389] Next, he fed the press a blank sheet and adjusted the dials to random intervals, ensuring no two letters aligned. [412] The machine clacked to life, spitting out a page of gibberish: *“The sorrow of a sunset is a comma in the dark.”* [431]

Veyra watched, unimpressed. “You’re just making noise.” [439] Elias ignored her. He placed the page beneath the fragment, and the air hummed. [458] A warmth spread through his chest, not unlike the feeling of solving a difficult proof—but sharper, more alive. [480] Suddenly, he wasn’t just observing emotions; he was *inhabiting* them. [493]

The fragment’s light flared, and Elias’s vision blurred. [501] He saw through Veyra’s eyes—her loneliness, her fear of being forgotten—and felt his own detachment crumble. [524] The workshop dissolved into a kaleidoscope of memories: his mother’s laughter, a friend’s betrayal, the cold thrill of a breakthrough. [547] Emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires, consuming everything in their path. [564]

“Stop!” Veyra shouted, but Elias couldn’t. The fragment had transposed their empathy, merging his analytical mind with her raw heart. [587] He stumbled, knocking over ink jars, and the press whirred out of control, stamping fragments of poetry onto the walls. [610] The halo fragment hovered above him, its light now a chaotic symphony of hues. [626]

In that lucid turbulence, Elias understood. The mathematics of emotion weren’t equations to be solved but rhythms to be felt. [649] He reached for the fragment, and it settled into his palm, cool and obedient. [662] The workshop steadied, the stars reappeared, and Veyra’s scowl softened. [678] “You finally see,” she said. [682] Elias nodded, his goggles fogged with tears. [690] For the first time, he didn’t need to borrow anyone’s personality. [700]
