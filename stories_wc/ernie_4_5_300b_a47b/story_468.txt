When the night yielded to golden embers, Elias Voss, the mortuary’s overly curious mortician, slipped into the mangrove labyrinth, his pockets stuffed with dream journals stolen from the deceased. <words>25</words> The air hummed with the singing spirits, their voices weaving through the salt-stained branches like liquid moonlight. <words>41</words> He’d come for the bracelet—a tarnished silver band he’d glimpsed in a widow’s final vision, said to hold the “rustle of revelation.” <words>60</words>  

Elias adjusted his spectacles, his manner loudly serene despite the mangrove’s prickling whispers. <words>72</words> “I mean no harm,” he called, imitating the spirits’ lilting cadence, though his voice cracked like a teenager’s. <words>91</words> The labyrinth shifted, roots curling like fingers, but he pressed on, tracing footprints that vanished after a single heartbeat, leaving only damp sand and the faint scent of jasmine. <words>122</words>  

A spirit materialized—a woman with eyes like opals, her gown woven from seafoam. <words>139</words> “Why chase ghosts, little embalmer?” she sang, her tone a blend of amusement and warning. <words>159</words> Elias bowed, a polished gesture from years of funerals. “To collect truths,” he said, patting his journals. “Dreams are the only honest eulogies.” <words>188</words>  

The spirit laughed, a sound like wind chimes. “Then follow the bracelet’s song.” She dissolved, her form unraveling into a flock of silver moths. <words>214</words> Elias froze. The moths swarmed toward a gnarled mangrove, its trunk etched with symbols that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>236</words> There, half-buried in roots, lay the bracelet, its silver dulled but still radiating a faint, eerie glow. <words>255</words>  

As he reached for it, the ground trembled. Footprints reappeared, not his own, but those of a hundred souls, each step fading as if erased by invisible hands. <words>281</words> “The rustle,” he murmured, clutching the bracelet. Instantly, visions flooded his mind: a lover’s betrayal, a child’s first lie, a confession whispered to the dark. <words>309</words> The spirits’ songs swelled, harmonizing with his racing pulse. <words>323</words>  

“You see now?” the opal-eyed woman reappeared, her form flickering. “Truth is a thief. It takes, but never gives back.” <words>347</words> Elias smiled, polite anarchy in his gaze. “Then I’ll barter.” He opened a journal, reading aloud a widow’s dream of forgiveness. <words>372</words> The spirits fell silent, then erupted into a chorus so pure it shook the mangroves. <words>390</words>  

When dawn tinged the horizon, Elias emerged, the bracelet secure in his pocket and the journals lighter. <words>411</words> The labyrinth had gifted him its rustle—not in silver, but in the weight of stories carried. <words>432</words> He paused, imitating the spirits’ final note, a sound that hovered between laughter and tears. <words>453</words>  

Back in his mortuary, he hung the bracelet above his desk, its tarnish now a map of constellations. <words>474</words> Some nights, when the world slept, he swore he heard the mangrove’s whispers, footprints materializing just long enough to remind him: curiosity, like death, is a kind of beginning. <words>500</words>
