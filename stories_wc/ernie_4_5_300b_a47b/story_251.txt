The ambivalent prophet, Kael, stood in the dust-choked airlock of Lunar Colony Zeta-9, clutching a cracked collection of marbles that hummed like a broken hymn. <words>20</words> Between heartbeats—the colony’s timeframe, measured in the flicker of solar lamps and the tremor of drill engines—he’d vowed to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, a task that demanded both defragmenting reality and swallowing his own doubt. <words>43</words>  

“You’re mad,” muttered Jyn, the colony’s chief engineer, her voice muffled by her respirator. <words>14</words> Kael merely shrugged, his bashful arrogance manifesting as a smirk. <words>11</words> “Madness is just truth defragmented,” he said, rolling a marble across the airlock’s grated floor. <words>14</words> It left a trail of iridescent dust, a residue of the marbles’ former glory. <words>13</words>  

The marbles were relics of a pre-collapse Earth, each one a fragment of a shattered omniscience orb. <words>15</words> Cracked by the same cataclysm that had birthed the lunar mines, they now served as Kael’s method: through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box, he’d pieced together a ritual to rewrite fate. <words>30</words> The box, unearthed from a derelict storage unit, contained edges of puzzles depicting forgotten constellations—a cosmic map waiting to be repurposed. <words>22</words>  

“The final oath isn’t spoken,” Kael said, his voice happily sad, a contradiction that made Jyn wince. <words>16</words> “It’s *unspoken*. A defragmentation of intent.” He gestured to the marbles, now arranged in a loose circle. <words>19</words> “Each crack is a variable. The puzzles… they’re the algorithm.” <words>13</words>  

Jyn crossed her arms. “And if you fail?” <words>8</words>  

Kael’s smirk widened. “Then I’ll be the universe’s joke. A prophet who couldn’t prophesy his own doom.” <words>17</words> He knelt, pressing a puzzle edge into the dust. It clicked against a marble’s crack, emitting a low, resonant tone. <words>20</words> The colony’s drills faltered, their rhythm syncing with the sound. <words>11</words>  

“You’re tampering with causality,” Jyn warned, though she didn’t step away. <words>12</words>  

“Causality’s a puzzle,” Kael said, fitting another piece. “And I’m the one who lost the box.” <words>15</words> The marbles began to glow, their cracks weaving light into the puzzle’s gaps. <words>14</words> A holographic scoreboard materialized above them, displaying stars as points and planets as players. <words>16</words>  

“Scramble it,” Kael whispered. The scoreboard flickered, names and numbers dissolving into static. <words>14</words>  

Jyn grabbed his shoulder. “This could erase us!” <words>9</words>  

Kael didn’t look up. “Better to be erased than erased *by*,” he said, bashful arrogance sharpening his tone. <words>16</words> The final puzzle piece snapped into place. The marbles shattered, their light engulfing the colony. <words>16</words>  

When the glow faded, the scoreboard was gone. So were the marbles. <words>11</words> Kael stood alone in the airlock, dust swirling around him like ash. <words>13</words>  

“Did it work?” Jyn asked, her voice trembling. <words>8</words>  

Kael picked up a shard of marble. “Depends on what ‘work’ means.” He grinned, happily sad. “The scoreboard’s gone. But so is the game.” <words>20</words>  

Outside, the drills roared to life, unburdened by cosmic stakes. <words>11</words> Kael walked away, his ambivalence intact, the rummage sale box empty but for a single puzzle piece—a memento of the oath unspoken. <words>22</words>
