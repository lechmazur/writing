In the hush of the unremembered future, an abandoned schoolhouse stood sentinel over a ghost town, its windows cracked like laughter frozen mid-chortle. <words>21</words> Inside, dust motes pirouetted in the amber glow of a single flickering bulb, illuminating a circle of seven figures—former friends, now strangers bound by a pact to defy the gravity of hopelessness. <words>47</words> At the center sat Lucky, a gambler whose name was a cruel joke; his fortune came not from cards but from a botanical diary, its pages filled with sketches of flowers that bloomed only in the shadows of decay. <words>74</words>  

“Spin the bottle,” he declared, slapping a rusted flask onto the floor. Typically never one for games, Lucky had proposed this ritual to extract truths too heavy for daylight. <words>93</words> The bottle spun, its glass mouth clinking against the floorboards, and pointed to Mara, a former teacher whose eyes gleamed like shattered glass. <words>113</words> “I duplicated the town’s water supply,” she confessed, her voice bright as a carnival barker’s. “Poisoned it with lilies from Lucky’s diary. They say hope is a weed, but I made it a plague.” <words>144</words>  

The group laughed, a sound like rustling leaves, as the bottle spun again. This time, it landed on Jax, a mechanic who’d once fixed Lucky’s broken watch. “I duplicated the diary,” he admitted, holding up a leather-bound twin. “Sold the copies to the highest bidders. Power’s sweeter when you’re not the only one holding the key.” <words>184</words>  

Lucky’s grin faltered. The diary’s power—its ability to twist nature into tools of control—had always been his secret. Now, it was a currency. <words>204</words> “Why share this?” he asked, though he knew the answer. The bottle’s confessions were mirrors, reflecting the rot beneath their cheerful despair. <words>224</words>  

“Because we’re already ghosts,” said Elara, a botanist who’d studied the diary’s flora. Her bottle spin revealed she’d duplicated the flowers themselves, planting them in the schoolhouse’s crumbling walls. “They grow faster when fed on regret.” <words>254</words>  

One by one, the truths piled up: duplications of secrets, lies, and desires. Each confession was a brick in a tower of corruption, built to outrun the void. <words>276</words> Lucky realized too late that the diary’s power wasn’t in its pages but in the hunger it awakened. He’d traded hope for control, and now control had devoured them all. <words>301</words>  

When the bottle pointed to him, Lucky hesitated. Then he smiled, sharp and brittle. “I duplicated the town,” he said. “Every soul here is a copy, a gamble against oblivion. We’re all just echoes of a world that forgot us.” <words>335</words>  

The group cheered, clinking flasks as if at a wedding. Outside, the ghost town’s wind howled, but inside, the air thrummed with a perverse joy. They were corrupt, doomed, and utterly alive. <words>362</words> In the unremembered future, hopelessness was a game—and they were determined to win.
