The wry caretaker, Jax, leaned against a rusted crate in the space pirate ship’s cargo hold, tracing the cracks in the bulkhead with a piece of chalk. <words>17</words> His warmly aloof demeanor masked a mind perpetually chasing the nature of time—how it bent, how it lied, how it left him stranded in moments that felt both eternal and fleeting. <words>35</words> The hold’s dim light flickered, casting his shadow like a ghost trapped between past and future. <words>49</words>  

An outdated phone on the crate buzzed, its dial tone humming like a drowning insect. <words>59</words> Jax’s fingers tightened around the chalk. The tone cut out abruptly, leaving silence so thick it throbbed. <words>73</words> He’d known this moment would come; the ship’s captain had warned him: *“When that relic dies, the hold’s ghosts wake.”* <words>89</words> Jax didn’t believe in ghosts, but he believed in *what ifs*—the endless, corrosive questions that gnawed at his resolve. <words>105</words>  

He stood, chalk in hand, and stepped toward the nearest porthole. <words>114</words> Outside, the void stretched, dotted with stars that seemed to wink in mockery. <words>127</words> Jax had always tracked cloud paths to vanish—not physically, but mentally. <words>138</words> On his homeworld, clouds had been his compass, their shapes a language that explained the unexplainable. <words>153</words> Here, in the hold, he’d adapted: tracing their phantom trails on metal, mapping time’s flow through scratches. <words>169</words>  

The phone’s corpse lay silent. Jax knelt, chalk poised. <words>178</words> The *what ifs* surged—*What if I’d stayed home? What if I’d fought back? What if time could be rewritten?*—a siren song that drowned reason. <words>196</words> He drew a cloud on the crate, its edges soft, its form ephemeral. <words>207</words> Then another, and another, until the metal bloomed with a sky that didn’t exist. <words>221</words>  

“Enough,” he muttered, the word carrying a gentle harshness, like a blade wrapped in velvet. <words>234</words> He pressed the chalk hard, snapping it. The shard clattered to the floor. <words>245</words> Time, he realized, wasn’t a river or a wheel—it was a thief, stealing certainty while leaving doubt. <words>260</words> The hold’s air hummed, as if the ship itself held its breath. <words>271</words>  

Jax stood, brushing chalk dust from his knees. <words>279</words> The broken phone’s screen reflected his face—a man caught between caretaking and surrender. <words>293</words> He walked to the hold’s center, where gravity pulled at odd angles, and closed his eyes. <words>306</words> By tracking cloud paths, he’d learned to vanish not from places, but from the tyranny of regret. <words>322</words> The *what ifs* faded, their voices dissolving into the hum of the ship’s engines. <words>336</words>  

When he opened his eyes, the chalk drawings remained, but their power was gone. <words>347</words> Jax smiled, a rare, true thing. <words>353</words> Time, he thought, was a liar, but he’d learned to lie back—to exist in the now, however fragile. <words>367</words> The hold’s lights brightened, as if the ship approved. <words>376</words> He tossed the chalk’s remains into a vent, where they’d drift like stardust. <words>389</words>  

Outside, the void waited, indifferent. Inside, Jax breathed. <words>399</words> The phone stayed dead. The *what ifs* stayed silent. <words>410</words> And for the first time in years, he felt… free. <words>420</words>
