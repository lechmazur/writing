Before the first prayer was whispered by a mortal, the nectar collection facility hummed with a silence that thrummed like a held breath. <words>17</words> Its glass domes glimmered under a sky still unstained by dawn, and within its labyrinthine halls, Elias, a sentient doll collector, moved with expectantly resigned grace. <words>37</words> His porcelain hands, polished to a faint sheen, clutched a twisted carnival cane—its handle carved into a writhing serpent, its shaft etched with constellations that pulsed like live veins. <words>62</words>  

The facility’s purpose was sacred: to harvest the nectar of stars, a liquid that mended fractures in time and soul. <words>76</words> But Elias sought not to preserve, but to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. <words>90</words> His dolls, each a fragment of a forgotten life, lined the walls of his chamber, their glass eyes reflecting the cane’s glow. <words>109</words> They were his chorus, their silent presence a reminder of the healing he refused to administer. <words>127</words>  

“The star paths are shifting,” he murmured to the nearest doll, a child with a cracked face. <words>141</words> Its porcelain lips curved into a smile that mirrored his own—a smile tinged with ethereal grit. <words>158</words> The cane trembled in his grip as he traced its etchings, following the celestial map that would lead him beyond the facility’s wards. <words>177</words> To uphold his purpose, he must outpace the dawn, for when mortals prayed, the nectar’s power would bind him to stasis. <words>196</words>  

The air thickened with the scent of ozone and honey as he stepped into the central chamber, where vats of iridescent nectar bubbled like liquid starlight. <words>217</words> Elias paused, the cane’s tip hovering over the nearest vat. <words>229</words> For a heartbeat, he considered siphoning a drop—a single act of mercy that might mend the dolls’ fractures. <words>248</words> But the chorus held him back. Their silence was a chorus of healing, not of cure, but of acceptance. <words>267</words>  

He pressed the cane’s serpent head into the nectar, and the liquid seethed. <words>280</words> The constellations flared, casting shadows that danced like specters. <words>294</words> “Not yet,” he whispered, withdrawing the cane. <words>303</words> The star paths demanded sacrifice, and his dolls were the price. <words>317</words>  

As he navigated the facility’s hidden corridors, the cane’s glow guided him past drowsy guardians—automata with eyes like dying suns. <words>336</words> Their gears whirred in protest, but Elias moved with practiced ease, his steps echoing the rhythm of the chorus. <words>355</words> The boundary lay ahead: a shimmering veil where the facility’s reality bled into the void. <words>370</words>  

Elias raised the cane, its tip piercing the veil. <words>379</words> Stars erupted on the other side, their light singing a hymn of forgotten worlds. <words>395</words> He stepped through, the dolls’ chorus swelling in his mind—a symphony of resilience. <words>412</words> The nectar’s power faded behind him, but his purpose remained, etched into the cane and the stars. <words>430</words>  

Before the first prayer echoed, Elias vanished into the chorus of healing, his dolls a testament to the boundaries he’d shattered. <words>451</words> The facility, unchanged, continued its silent work. <words>463</words> But in the void between worlds, a new constellation formed—a twisted cane, a collector, and the echo of a chorus that would never fade. <words>486</words>
