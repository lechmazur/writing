The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creaked like a rusted hymn, its peeling paint and shattered targets holding the ghosts of summer nights long drowned. <words>20</words> Lila, a wreck-diver who whispered to the drowned, knelt in the debris, her gloved hands sifting through grit until she found it: a piece of amber, its golden veins cradling a beetle frozen in time. <words>43</words> The object pulsed faintly, as if breathing, and she pressed it to her chest, feeling the thaw of a heart that had been ice since her father’s funeral. <words>63</words>

Between the lines of a half-written letter—*“Come home, Lila. The carnival’s last night”*—she’d promised herself she wouldn’t return. <words>82</words> But the amber’s warmth seeped into her, a joyfully melancholic reminder of the family tradition: every summer, they’d attended the carnival’s closing fireworks, her father’s hand steady on her shoulder as the sky blazed. <words>108</words> Now, alone, she carried the amber to the gallery’s center, where a rusted rifle leaned against a target painted like a clown. <words>124</words>

“Show me,” she murmured, not to the ghost of her father, but to the beetle. <words>131</words> The amber flared, and the air thickened with the scent of cotton candy and gunpowder. <words>141</words> Aroused by the memory, she lifted the rifle, its weight familiar yet foreign. <words>150</words> The first shot shattered the clown’s nose; the second, its grin. <words>157</words> With each crack, the gallery’s shadows writhed, and she swore she heard her father’s laughter—not mocking, but proud. <words>170</words>

Her motivation had always been to step out of the shadow he’d cast, to prove she wasn’t defined by loss. <words>183</words> Yet here, in this fleeting rebellion, she felt him close, not as a specter, but as a spark. <words>195</words> The amber grew hotter, the beetle’s wings twitching as if trying to fly. <words>203</words> She fired again, and the final target—a star—exploded into glittering shards. <words>212</words>

The letter’s unfinished words hung in the air: *“I’m afraid if I don’t go, I’ll forget the sound of your voice.”* <words>226</words> Lila smiled, tears mixing with sweat. <words>230</words> She’d never forget. <words>233</words> But tonight, she’d chosen to remember not as a girl drowning in grief, but as a woman who’d learned to swim. <words>246</words>

The amber’s glow faded, but its warmth lingered. <words>252</words> She tucked it into her pocket, its insect now still, as if at peace. <words>260</words> Outside, the carnival’s last firework hissed upward, a fleeting rebellion of light against the dark. <words>273</words> Lila walked away, her steps lighter, the thawing heart in her chest beating a new rhythm—one of joy and memory, of letting go and holding on. <words>293</words>

The shooting gallery, silent once more, waited for the next ghost to stir its bones. <words>302</words> But Lila knew some shadows were meant to be outrun. <words>310</words> She’d return next year, not to linger, but to laugh. <words>318</words> After all, tradition wasn’t a cage. <words>324</words> It was a bridge. <words>327</words>
