In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, Kael adjusted the lenses of his sensory map maker’s visor, the device humming as it translated the echoes of a thousand universes into light. [37] The abandoned spaceport repair bay loomed around him, its skeletal gantries rusting under the dim glow of emergency lights. [62] Dust motes swirled in the air, each one catching faint hues from the visor’s projections—a mosaic of colors only he could see. [105] His fingers brushed the green glass shard tucked into his belt, its edges sharp enough to draw blood if he wasn’t careful. [141] He’d found it weeks ago in a crater on a dead moon, its surface etched with symbols that shifted when he looked away. [179] 

The shard’s pull was cyclically spontaneous, a compulsion that came in waves. [204] Today, it throbbed like a second heartbeat, urging him toward the bay’s central platform. [233] Kael had always weaved between worlds, his maps guiding ships through the fractures of reality. [262] But this—this was different. The shard wasn’t a tool; it was a key. [289] And the truth it withheld? He’d felt its weight in his bones since childhood, when his mother vanished during a jump, leaving only a hologram of her last words: *“Some doors shouldn’t be opened.”* [352] 

He climbed the platform, his boots clanging against the metal grid. [371] The visor flickered, overlaying the bay with a lattice of glowing lines—portals, each leading to a parallel universe. [409] Kael’s breath hitched. Normally, he plotted jumps methodically, calculating angles and energy signatures. [447] But the shard’s pull was redirecting him, overriding his caution. [472] He gripped it tighter, its cool surface warming against his palm. [493] 

“Show me,” he whispered. [499] 

The bay shuddered. [503] The air thickened, ripe with the scent of ozone and something older, sharper—the tang of a world where time bled sideways. [547] The visor’s lines shifted, coalescing into a single, pulsing portal. [572] Kael stepped forward, his boots sinking into the platform as if it were quicksand. [600] The shard flared, casting emerald light across his face. [621] 

He fell. [624] 

Gravity reversed. Colors inverted. The bay dissolved into a vortex of fractured light, and Kael’s scream was swallowed by the roar of colliding realities. [672] When he opened his eyes, he lay on the same platform, but the bay was different. [700] The rust was gone, replaced by gleaming alloy. [719] A ship hovered above, its hull emblazoned with a symbol he recognized—the same one etched on the shard. [757] 

“You’re late,” a voice said. [764] 

A woman stood at the edge of the platform, her uniform marked with the insignia of the Interstellar Cartography Guild. [799] Kael’s chest tightened. She had his mother’s eyes. [818] 

“Mom?” he breathed. [823] 

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Not exactly. But I’ve been waiting for you.” [855] 

The shard vibrated in his hand. [863] Kael’s mind raced. This was a parallel universe, a world where his mother hadn’t disappeared. [898] Where she’d lived, aged, and become someone else. [917] The weight of the withheld truth crashed over him—she’d known about the shard. She’d used it. [952] 

“Why?” he asked. [956] 

The woman stepped closer. “Because some doors need to stay closed. The shard isn’t just a key. It’s a choice.” [998] 

Kael’s grip loosened. The shard’s pull faded, replaced by a hollow ache. [1029] He’d spent years chasing answers, only to find that the truth was a knife that cut both ways. [1067] 

“What happens now?” he asked. [1076] 

The woman shrugged. “You redirect. Again.” [1093] 

Before he could respond, the bay shuddered. The portal reopened, its edges fraying like thread. [1128] Kael looked at the shard, then at the woman. [1147] She nodded, a silent permission. [1160] 

He hurled the shard into the portal. [1173] 

The light exploded. [1180] 

When Kael woke, he was back in his own bay, the shard gone. [1205] The visor’s projections were stable, the portals quiet. [1224] But his hands trembled, and he could still smell the ozone of that other world. [1253] 

He stood, his legs unsteady. The bay was silent, the dust settling. [1278] For the first time, he understood. The truth wasn’t a thing to be found—it was a thread, weaving through every choice, every jump. [1316] And he’d finally learned to let it go. [1335] 

Kael removed his visor, letting the bay’s dim light wash over his face. [1360] The murmur of half-remembered dreams faded, replaced by the quiet hum of possibility. [1392] He smiled, cyclically spontaneous, and walked away. [1411] 

The weight was gone. [1420] 

And for the first time, that felt like enough. [1438]
