The abandoned carnival prize booth smelled of rust and forgotten laughter, its peeling paint a mosaic of faded reds and yellows. <words>16</words> Clara, a bookbinder with telekinetic powers she’d never fully mastered, leaned against the counter, her fingers tracing the grooves of a single chopstick wrapper left behind by some long-gone patron. <words>37</words> She’d come here seeking answers, not prizes—answers to why knowledge always demanded a price, and why she felt compelled to pay it. <words>55</words>

The booth’s shelves still held dusty trinkets: a cracked porcelain doll, a frayed stuffed bear, a deck of cards missing the ace of spades. <words>71</words> Clara’s telekinesis hummed in her veins, restless, as if the booth itself were a dormant spell waiting to be unraveled. <words>89</words> She’d always been strictly casual about her powers, using them to mend torn pages or lift heavy tomes, never daring to probe their depths. <words>108</words> But today, she needed more. She needed to *revive* something—a memory, a truth, a fragment of the past that might explain her restless hunger for transformation. <words>129</words>

A gust of wind rattled the booth’s shutters, and a tinny melody echoed—a fragment of a carnival tune, half-buried in time. <words>144</words> The sound triggered a sudden flashback: her grandmother’s voice, sharp with warning, as she stitched a leather-bound grimoire. *“Knowledge isn’t free,”* she’d said, *“it’s a currency. The more you spend, the less you keep.”* <words>168</words> Clara’s breath hitched. The chopstick wrapper trembled in her grip, its paper thin as a memory. <words>182</words>

Another sound bite—a child’s laughter, distant, disembodied—and another flashback: a young Clara, hiding in the attic, watching her grandmother perform a ritual with a similar wrapper, its surface scrawled with symbols. *“Transformation requires sacrifice,”* her grandmother had whispered, *“not of blood, but of self.”* <words>217</words> The booth’s air thickened, as if the past were pressing in, demanding to be acknowledged. <words>233</words>

Clara’s telekinesis flared. The wrapper levitated, its edges glowing faintly. <words>244</words> Across the tapestry of lost legends, she sensed the threads pulling taut—the price of knowledge wasn’t just loss, but *change*. <words>262</words> To know was to shed old skins, to become something new, something stranger. <words>276</words> The wrapper dissolved into ash, and in its place hung a vision: her grandmother, young again, laughing as she bound a book whose pages wrote themselves. <words>297</words>

*“You see?”* her grandmother’s voice echoed, not from memory, but from the air itself. *“The power isn’t in the binding. It’s in the letting go.”* <words>316</words> The booth shuddered, and the trinkets on the shelves began to glow, their forms shifting—the doll mended itself, the bear stood upright, the cards reassembled. <words>334</words> Transformation wasn’t destruction. It was the price of admission to a grander, subtler truth. <words>348</words>

Clara smiled, her powers singing now, not with restraint, but with purpose. <words>361</words> She stepped outside, the carnival’s ghosts fading behind her, and knew: the price of knowledge was never static. It was a dance, a give and take, a chopstick wrapper burning to ash so something newer, wilder, could rise. <words>390</words>
