Every spring, when the soil softened and the air hummed with renewal, Lira ventured into the city’s labyrinthine streets, her faux turban perched atop her head, her crystal ball dusted with glitter. <words>24</words> She called herself a fortune teller, but her visions were real—flashes of the past, fragments of futures, sharp as shattered glass. <words>46</words> Today, though, she carried a bone flute tucked in her satchel, unearthed from a crypt beneath the old cathedral, its surface etched with symbols from a language no one spoke. <words>105</words>  

The archive of extinct tongues stood at the city’s edge, a crumbling limestone fortress filled with scrolls and stone tablets. <words>144</words> Lira went there seldom, only when the urge to study sacred development—the way rituals shaped civilizations—overpowered her fear of the archivists’ disdain. <words>194</words> She’d heard rumors of a hidden chamber, its walls inscribed with prayers in a tongue lost to time. <words>224</words>  

Planting season had begun, the streets slick with mud, the sky a pallid gray. <words>246</words> Lira wandered, as she regularly did, letting chance guide her. <words>267</words> She turned down an alley she’d never noticed, its cobblestones slick with moss, and found a door carved with the same symbols as the flute. <words>305</words> It creaked open to reveal a staircase spiraling into darkness. <words>324</words>  

Down she went, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and old parchment. <words>349</words> The chamber at the bottom was small, its walls lined with shelves of brittle manuscripts. <words>376</words> In the center stood a pedestal, atop it a stone tablet depicting a figure playing the bone flute. <words>405</words> Lira’s hands trembled as she lifted the flute to her lips. <words>421</words> The first note pierced the silence, a sound like wind through bones, and the visions came—not of the future, but of the past: a priestess playing the flute in a temple, her followers chanting in the extinct tongue, their voices weaving a spell to bind the earth’s spirit. <words>481</words>  

Anger flared in Lira’s chest, peaceful as a dormant volcano. <words>498</words> The archivists had dismissed her theories, called her a charlatan. <words>517</words> But here, in this hidden room, the truth was etched in stone. <words>536</words> She played the flute again, louder, the notes echoing through the archive, a rebellion against the silence of forgotten voices. <words>566</words>  

When she emerged, the city was bathed in golden light, the soil below her feet humming with life. <words>591</words> Lira smiled, her faux fortune teller’s smile, but this time, it was real. <words>610</words> She’d taken a chance, gotten lost, and found a gem not of gold, but of truth. <words>633</words> The bone flute, still warm in her hands, was proof that some secrets, if you listened hard enough, would sing themselves to you. <words>664</words>
