The steampunk observation deck shuddered as thunder rattled its brass rivets, and Elias, the nostalgic tailor, adjusted his spectacles to peer through the rain-streaked glass. <words>21</words> His fingers brushed the dusty mirror propped against the wall—a relic from the deck’s forgotten days as a merchant’s lounge—its surface clouded with decades of neglect. <words>41</words> He’d brought it here after the last code was broken, a cipher etched into the deck’s gears by a long-dead inventor who’d claimed the mirror revealed *parallel lives*. <words>64</words>  

Elias had always believed the inventor’s tales were madness, but tonight, as lightning split the sky, the mirror’s glass flickered. <words>79</words> A reflection stared back that wasn’t his: a version of himself in a crisper suit, stitching a coat of living thread that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>96</words> “You see it too,” Elias whispered, not to the mirror, but to the storm itself, as if the tempest were a confidant. <words>111</words>  

The deck’s gears groaned, and the mirror’s image shifted again. This time, the other Elias stood in a tower of spinning cogs, his hands glowing with arcane energy. <words>132</words> *Subtly menacing*, Elias thought, noting how the parallel version’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. <words>146</words> Yet he leaned closer, driven by a hopeful desperation to ascend beyond mortal limits—to shed the fragility of flesh and thread. <words>165</words>  

“I’ve stitched souls into suits,” Elias confessed to the mirror, voice trembling. “But I fear what comes after the needle pricks the skin.” <words>185</words> The storm howled, and the mirror’s image spoke, its voice a chorus of wind and gears: *“You fear becoming me.”* <words>201</words>  

Elias recoiled but steadied himself. The deck’s lights flickered, casting his shadow into a grotesque parody of the mirror’s figure. <words>219</words> “No,” he said, “I fear *not* becoming you.” The admission hung in the air, raw and improbable, yet the storm seemed to still, as if listening. <words>239</words>  

The mirror’s glass shimmered, and the parallel Elias raised a hand, offering a spool of iridescent thread. *“Take it,”* the image urged. *“Stitch your fate into something grander.”* <words>260</words> Elias hesitated, then reached out. His fingertips brushed the glass, and for a heartbeat, the boundary between worlds thinned. <words>277</words>  

But the storm surged, and the deck’s alarms blared. The mirror’s image dissolved into static, leaving only Elias’s reflection—weary, human, alive. <words>296</words> He stepped back, clutching the dusty frame. The gears below him whirred, a reminder that time, like thread, frayed at the edges. <words>312</words>  

“I’ll reassure myself,” he muttered, “that some limits are meant to be kept.” Yet as he descended the deck’s spiral staircase, the mirror’s whisper lingered: *“You’ll return.”* <words>336</words>  

Elias smiled faintly. Maybe the inventor hadn’t been mad. Maybe parallel lives were just storms in waiting—and he, the tailor, would always be there to stitch the seams. <words>360</words>
