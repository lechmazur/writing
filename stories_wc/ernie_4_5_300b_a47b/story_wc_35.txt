The desert fortress stood as a relic of some forgotten king, its sandstone walls cracked yet unyielding, the air thick with the scent of wet stone after the first rain in a decade. [36] Chefs in the fortress kitchen rarely left their domed chambers, but Nessar, whose tongue could taste memories, wandered the damp corridors, licking the condensation from the walls to sample the echoes of those who’d passed. [67] Tonight, he felt drawn to the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes—a place even the oldest guards spoke of in hushed tones, as if the structure itself were a confession. [102]

He’d discovered the pavilion years ago, its spires glinting like frozen seafoam beneath the shifting sands. [114] The door, etched with tidal patterns, yielded only to those who pressed their palms against it, a ritual Nessar now performed without hesitation. [137] Inside, the air was arctic, the walls lined with shelves holding vials of liquid memory, each labeled with names long erased from the fortress’s ledgers. [165] But tonight, he sought not the vials but the pavilion’s heart: a pool of brackish water, its surface etched with tidal formations that shifted like living ink. [192]

Stored remorse, he knew, pooled here. The fortress’s founders had built the pavilion to contain their regrets, locking them away in coral and salt. [219] But remorse, like water, found cracks. Nessar had tasted it in the rain-soaked walls, in the way the guards avoided his gaze, in the silence that hung over the fortress like a shroud. [251] His motivation was simple: to sandpaper rough memories, to blunt their edges until they no longer cut. [274] He’d learned long ago that memories, like spices, could be tempered. But remorse was a bitter herb, and he’d yet to find the right recipe. [301]

The pavilion’s pool reflected his face—a man of middle years, his skin weathered by heat and salt, his eyes the color of storm clouds. [324] He knelt, dipping his fingers into the water. The tidal formations pulsed, their patterns mirroring the ebb and flow of his own guilt. [347] Analyzing them was his method, a way to decode the emotions trapped here. [360] He’d once believed that if he could understand the shapes, he could unravel the remorse. Now he wondered if he was simply becoming entangled in it. [387]

A guard’s bootsteps echoed in the corridor outside. Nessar froze. The pavilion was forbidden, its secrets meant to stay buried. But the guard didn’t enter. Instead, he paused, then retreated, his footsteps fading like a tide receding. [428] Nessar exhaled. The pavilion’s emotionally contagious nature worked both ways; those who lingered too long risked becoming vessels for the very regrets they sought to contain. [459]

He submerged his hands deeper, the water numbing his fingers. The tidal formations shifted, resolving into a familiar shape: a man, kneeling in the rain, his hands buried in the sand. [490] Nessar tasted the memory—salt and iron, the sting of tears, the weight of a decision made in haste. [513] It was the founder’s remorse, the one who’d ordered the fortress built, the one who’d buried his doubts beneath stone. [536]

The memory surged, its emotionally contagious touch seeping into Nessar’s skin. He gasped, the founder’s guilt becoming his own. [559] For a moment, he was the man in the rain, the weight of the fortress on his shoulders, the knowledge that his choices had doomed generations. [586] Then, as suddenly as it came, the memory fractured. Nessar shook his head, his vision clearing. The pool’s surface went still, the tidal formations erased. [613]

He stood, his legs unsteady. The pavilion’s air felt lighter, the remorse less sharp. [630] He’d subsumed the founder’s guilt, not to keep it, but to dilute it, to spread the burden until it was no longer a knife but a grain of sand. [657] The chef wiped his hands on his apron, the fabric stiff with salt. His tongue tingled, the taste of memory fading. [674]

Outside, the rain had stopped. The desert moon hung low, casting the fortress in silver. Nessar walked back to the kitchen, his steps sure. [697] The guards nodded as he passed, their expressions softer, as if a weight had lifted from them too. [714] He didn’t know if the pavilion’s remorse was truly gone, or if he’d simply learned to carry it differently. But for now, the fortress felt sturdier, its brittleness tempered by the rain. [749]

At the close of an unspoken dream, Nessar began to cook. He chopped onions, their sharpness mellowed by the memory of laughter. He simmered broth, its bitterness softened by the ghost of forgiveness. [776] The meal wouldn’t erase the past, but it would nourish the present. And sometimes, he thought, that was enough. [793]
