The edgy tradesman, Jax, leaned against a pulsating fungal wall inside the giant mushroom house, his boots sinking into the spongy floor. <words>20</words>
He clutched a torn corner of a flyer, its edges frayed like the edges of his patience, advertising a long-forgotten circus. <words>40</words>
Memory, he’d learned, was a liquid thing—always shifting, never still, like the way the mushroom’s cap shimmered in the dim light. <words>60</words>
Jax was comfortingly pessimistic; he expected nothing, and thus was rarely disappointed, though the void outside gnawed at him. <words>85</words>
His motivation was simple: to carry a flickering candle through an endless void, because someone had to, and no one else would. <words>110</words>
The final rotation of the forgotten windmill outside ground its gears like a skeletal clock, sending tremors through the house. <words>135</words>
He pulled out two synchronized watches, both stopped at 3:33 AM, a relic from a job where time had been a commodity he’d traded away. <words>160</words>
“Time’s a loop,” he muttered, pressing a button on one watch; the other vibrated in his pocket, a ghostly echo. <words>185</words>
Jax had come here to vectorize the chaos—to map the void’s edges using only the flyer’s corner and his own skewed recollections. <words>210</words>
The mushroom house breathed, its spores drifting like forgotten thoughts, clinging to his coat like regret. <words>235</words>
He remembered a woman’s laugh, once bright, now distorted into something sharp and metallic, like the windmill’s blades. <words>260</words>
The flyer’s corner showed a trapeze artist mid-flip, but Jax saw only the way her legs had twisted when she fell. <words>285</words>
“You can’t trust memory,” he said aloud, the words muffled by the thick air, “it’s just a story you tell yourself.” <words>310</words>
He lit the candle, its flame small but steady, casting long shadows that danced like old ghosts. <words>330</words>
The void outside pressed against the walls, hungry and ancient, but Jax stood his ground, watches in hand. <words>350</words>
He began to vectorize—tracing lines in the air with his fingers, guided by the flyer’s fragment and the watches’ sync. <words>375</words>
The mushroom house shuddered, its cap glowing brighter, as if responding to his efforts to pin down the unpinnable. <words>400</words>
Jax smiled, a rare thing, comforted by the pessimism that told him this, too, would fade, but for now, it was enough. <words>425</words>
The final rotation of the windmill slowed, its gears grinding to a halt, and the void seemed to sigh, momentarily still. <words>450</words>
He tucked the flyer’s corner into his coat, next to the watches, and walked deeper into the mushroom house, candle in hand. <words>475</words>
The blurry vividness of the moment lingered—a snapshot of distortion, memory, and the quiet hope that maybe, just maybe, he could outrun the void. <words>500</words>
