The abandoned spaceport hangar hummed with a silence that pressed like static, its skeletal ribs of steel and glass framing the hush before an acceptance speech—a speech Lira, a professional cuddler by trade, had been hired to attend as a gesture of “emotional solidarity.” <words>35</words>  
She adjusted her lavender sweater, its yarn frayed at the cuffs, and glanced at the antique phantom train ticket punch in her pocket, its brass gears whirring faintly. The object had been her grandfather’s, a relic from a time when interstellar rail lines crisscrossed the galaxy, and she carried it as a talisman against the decay of human connection. <words>84</words>  
The hangar’s floor, cracked and weedy, seemed to exhale dust as she wandered, her boots crunching. Unspoken rules governed such events: don’t speak unless spoken to, don’t touch the podium, don’t ask about the speaker’s past. But Lira’s profession had taught her that rules were often just walls waiting to be leaned against. <words>132</words>  
A chance encounter at the farmer’s market three days prior had planted the seed of defiance. An elderly vendor, selling glow-mushrooms, had whispered, “They say the hangar’s haunted by ghosts of passengers who missed their trains.” Lira had laughed, but the vendor’s eyes—unusually usual, a shade of storm-gray she’d never seen—had held her gaze. “Some rules,” he’d said, “are meant to be unspoken because they’re too painful to say aloud.” <words>194</words>  
Now, as the speech’s start time neared, Lira spotted a figure hunched near a corroded control panel. The woman, her suit frayed at the seams, clutched a holographic briefcase. Lira recognized her: the keynote speaker, Dr. Elara Voss, a xenobiologist once celebrated for her work on terraforming, now disgraced by a scandal involving “unethical symbiosis experiments.” <words>245</words>  
Dr. Voss’s hands trembled as she fumbled with the briefcase latch. Lira approached, the ticket punch warm in her palm. “May I?” she asked, nodding at the case. Dr. Voss stiffened but nodded. The punch’s gears clicked as Lira pressed it against the lock, a trick her grandfather had taught her—phantom tickets could bypass any security if you listened to the metal’s “song.” <words>297</words>  
The case popped open, revealing a single vial of iridescent liquid. “Decay,” Dr. Voss muttered. “It’s what they accused me of… accelerating. But it’s not destruction. It’s transformation.” Her voice cracked. “I just wanted to prove we could evolve faster, skip the pain.” <words>343</words>  
Lira understood. Her own prejudice against “scientists” had rooted in childhood, when a lab accident had killed her pet robot-dog. But here, in the hangar’s ancient novelty, she saw the truth: fear of decay made people cling to rules, even harmful ones. She placed the ticket punch in Dr. Voss’s hand. “Let’s rewrite the unspoken ones,” she said. <words>393</words>  
The speech began moments later, Dr. Voss’s voice steady as she spoke of “ethical acceleration.” Lira, seated in the back, smiled. The hangar’s decay had become a stage for rebirth, and the phantom ticket punch—a tool of ghosts—had punched a hole in the silence. <words>430</words>
