The naive summoner, Lira, pressed her palm against the vault’s cold stone, her breath fogging in the peculiarly virtual glow of ancient runes. <words>17</words> Between commercials of a flickering hologram show, she’d slipped into the secret society’s treasure vault, lured by whispers of a relic that could “elevate” her voice to fate itself. <words>37</words> Her goal? To hum a lullaby loud enough to pierce the veil of chance—a childish hope, but one she clung to like a talisman. <words>54</words>

The vault hummed with secrets, shelves crammed with artifacts that pulsed with half-life energy. <words>18</words> Lira’s fingers brushed a shard of obsidian—a piece of a broken statue, its edges sharp enough to draw blood. <words>26</words> The society’s elders had warned against touching it, but rumor-charged midnight gatherings had spun tales of its power: *“It remembers what was lost,”* they’d said, *“and what might be found.”* <words>45</words>

She lifted the shard, its weight strange, as if it existed in both hands and not at all. <words>18</words> The virtual light warped around it, casting shadows that danced like forgotten memories. <words>20</words> Lira hummed, a tune her mother had sung before vanishing into the static of some otherworldly broadcast. <words>24</words> The vault’s air thickened, the runes flaring as if answering her. <words>14</words>

“You think a lullaby can change fate?” A voice echoed from the darkness—a society scribe, her face hidden by a hood. <words>24</words> “Rumors are just noise,” she added, though her tone held a distant warmth, like a teacher scolding a student she secretly admired. <words>29</words>

Lira’s grip tightened. “Noise can be shaped,” she said, recalling how the elders had used gossip to manipulate events. <words>20</words> “This shard… it’s a seed. Seeds need soil. Rumors are the soil.” <words>19</words> The scribe stepped closer, her eyes reflecting the vault’s eerie light. <words>13</words> “And your lullaby?” <words>6</words>

“The water.” Lira smiled. “Seeds of understanding need time to grow. Between commercials, when the world pauses…” She trailed off, humming louder. <words>30</words> The shard vibrated, its edges softening, as if melting into the air. <words>14</words> The vault’s runes blazed, and for a moment, Lira felt fate itself lean in to listen. <words>20</words>

The scribe removed her hood, revealing a face lined with years of guarding secrets. <words>17</words> “You’re naive,” she said, but her hand rested gently on Lira’s shoulder. <words>15</words> “But maybe… naivety is the soil we’ve been missing.” <words>14</words>

Outside, the hologram show resumed, its bright colors washing over the vault’s entrance. <words>17</words> Lira’s lullaby faded, but the shard’s glow lingered, a quiet promise. <words>15</words> She didn’t know if fate had heard her, but for the first time, she felt the weight of possibility—not as a burden, but as a seed. <words>28</words>
