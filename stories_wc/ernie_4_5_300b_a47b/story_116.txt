The black velvet sky-lounge floated above an endless city, its glass floor shimmering with constellations no star-chart had ever named. <words>22</words> Elias, a dismayed minstrel with a lute slung like a burden, stared at the broken watch band coiled in his palm—its cracked leather a map of time’s failures. <words>45</words> “Boundaries,” he muttered, subjectively rational in his obsession: if he could excavate the city’s hidden edges, he’d finally draw a map of the endless night that had swallowed his songs. <words>71</words>  

Amid garden secrets—whispering vines that bloomed only when unobserved, fountains that sang in reverse—he’d begun his ritual. <words>91</words> Each dawn, he studied old Polaroid photographs stacked in a rusted tin: a lover’s smile frozen mid-laugh, a alleyway’s shadow stretching like a question, a cat’s eye reflecting a skyline now buried beneath neon. <words>130</words> The photos were relics of a world where time had direction, where love hadn’t dissolved into static. <words>148</words>  

“Excavation requires patience,” he told the room’s lone potted fern, its leaves curling as if bored. <words>168</words> The sky-lounge’s owners, a pair of siblings who traded memories like currency, had warned him: *“The city’s boundaries are drawn in smoke and regret. You’ll choke before you see them.”* But Elias’s rationality was a blade—sharpened by loss, honed by the certainty that art demanded borders. <words>210</words>  

He spread the Polaroids across the velvet, their edges curling like dried leaves. <words>226</words> In one, a bridge arched over a river that no longer existed; in another, a clock tower’s hands spun backward, its face cracked. <words>247</words> Elias traced the fissures with his fingertip, imagining the watch band’s break as a clue: *What if boundaries weren’t lines but scars?* <words>272</words>  

The garden below hummed with secrets. Vines slithered up the sky-lounge’s legs, their thorns scraping the glass. <words>293</words> Elias pressed his palm to the floor, feeling the city’s heartbeat—a rhythm erratic as his own. <words>312</words> He laughed, a sound laconic and exuberant, like a candle flickering in a storm. <words>330</words> *“You’re a fool,”* the fern seemed to sigh. <words>339</words>  

By midnight, he’d pieced the Polaroids into a mosaic: the bridge, the clock, the lover’s smile. <words>356</words> A boundary emerged—not a wall, but a fold in reality, a place where the city’s endless sprawl hiccuped into repetition. <words>377</words> The broken watch band, when laid across the mosaic, aligned with a fissure in the clock tower’s face. <words>396</words>  

“There,” Elias whispered, his voice trembling with laconic triumph. <words>408</words> He’d drawn the map not with ink, but with absence—the space between what was and what couldn’t be. <words>427</words> The sky-lounge shuddered as the vines below recoiled, as if the city itself resisted being charted. <words>446</words>  

But Elias didn’t care. He strummed his lute, a chord bright and brittle, and sang of boundaries that weren’t chains but bridges. <words>470</words> The song hung in the air, a Polaroid of sound, its edges fraying but still, somehow, whole. <words>493</words>
