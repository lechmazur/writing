The high-altitude tea house perched on the edge of the Andean plateau hummed with the clatter of porcelain and the murmur of patrons during intermission. <words>20</words> Dr. Hector Vrynn, a mad botanist with a penchant for carnivorous flora, adjusted his spectacles and traced the frayed edge of his worn-out leather belt—a relic from his grandfather’s expedition. <words>42</words> The belt’s buckle, etched with a faint compass rose, had once pointed to uncharted valleys, but now it merely sagged, a testament to Hector’s increasingly erratic experiments. <words>65</words>

“Ionize the atmosphere,” he muttered to himself, comically serious as he unspooled a black-and-white film reel from his coat. <words>83</words> The reel, hidden in a false compartment of his satchel, contained footage of a 1930s botanical expedition—or so he claimed. <words>100</words> Its true purpose, he insisted, was to reveal ancient pathways through “subharmonic light frequencies,” a theory that had earned him sidelong glances from the tea house’s staff. <words>126</words>

Hector’s motivation was twofold: to locate a rumored network of pre-Incan tunnels and to cultivate a carnivorous orchid that could thrive in ionized air. <words>148</words> The orchid, named *Vrynn’s Folly* by his detractors, had already devoured three lab assistants’ ties and a stray tabby cat. <words>166</words> Tonight, he planned to project the film onto the tea house’s fogged windows, using the intermission’s dim light to “align the reel’s hidden sections” with the belt’s compass. <words>191</words>

“Madness,” whispered the barista, a woman with a fickle loyalty to Hector’s eccentricities—she’d once helped him smuggle a Venus flytrap past customs. <words>212</words> “But if anyone can ionize a tea house,” she added, “it’s you.” <words>224</words>

Hector ignored her, threading the film through a makeshift projector fashioned from a teapot and a magnifying glass. <words>240</words> As the reel spun, static crackled, and the images warped: jungles dissolved into geometric patterns, and a figure in a pith helmet seemed to point directly at Hector’s belt. <words>265</words> Suddenly, the air tingled. The orchid in his satchel shuddered, its jaws snapping open. <words>281</words>

“It’s working!” Hector crowed, adjusting the projector’s focus. <words>291</words> The belt vibrated, its compass needle spinning wildly before locking onto a spot near the tea house’s fireplace. <words>308</words> A low hum filled the room, and the patrons fell silent, their teacups suspended mid-air. <words>324</words>

Then, as abruptly as it began, the phenomenon ceased. <words>334</words> The film reel snapped, and the belt clattered to the floor. <words>344</words> Hector stared at the fireplace, where a faint outline of a tunnel mouth now yawned in the bricks. <words>360</words>

“Ancient pathways,” he breathed, grinning like a man who’d just proven the earth was flat. <words>376</words> The barista rolled her eyes but handed him a fresh cup of tea. <words>388</words> “For the road,” she said, her loyalty flickering like a candle in a storm. <words>401</words>

Hector patted his satchel, where the orchid had gone dormant, its jaws now closed. <words>415</words> “To the tunnels,” he declared, strapping on his belt. <words>425</words> “And perhaps… a side trip to the patent office.” <words>439</words>

As he descended the tea house’s rickety stairs, the patrons resumed their chatter, unaware that the line between genius and madness had just been ionized—along with their afternoon tea. <words>470</words>
