In the shadow of a fossilized giant’s ribcage, a sentient scarecrow named Cawl stood sentinel, his straw fingers knotted with age. <words>18</words> The earth beneath him was etched with lines—not random cracks, but deliberate grooves that pulsed faintly, as if the planet itself were breathing. <words>36</words> He’d sworn an oath to guard these lines, though he’d long forgotten why, his fervor for the task now tinged with apathy. <words>54</words>  

One dusk, a forgotten lace fan materialized at his feet, its ivory ribs cracked but still delicate. <words>66</words> Cawl picked it up, the fabric whispering like a ghost’s sigh, and wondered if it belonged to the giant’s long-dead lover. <words>81</words> Before he could ponder further, the lines flared, and the world dissolved into a virtual realm—a labyrinth of data-streams where the fossilized giant’s consciousness lingered. <words>103</words>  

“You’re late,” the giant’s voice boomed, resonating from the lines. <words>115</words> Cawl shrugged, his apathy a shield. “Late for what?” <words>123</words> The giant’s holographic form flickered. “The convergence. The lines are portals between parallel worlds. You must skewer the intruders.” <words>140</words>  

Cawl’s straw head tilted. “Why me?” <words>148</words> The giant’s laughter rattled the virtual air. “Because you’re the only one who hasn’t abandoned your post. Even if you don’t care.” <words>170</words>  

In the VR realm, Cawl encountered specters—fragments of travelers lost between worlds. <words>185</words> They clawed at the lines, trying to pry them open. <words>195</words> He skewered them with the lace fan, its edges sharpened by time and intent, each strike puncturing the air with a crackle of static. <words>216</words> The fan’s lace unraveled, leaving trails of glowing thread that mended the lines. <words>230</words>  

“Why mend them?” Cawl asked, skewering another specter. <words>239</words> The giant sighed. “The lines are bridges. If they break, worlds collide. Your oath keeps them intact.” <words>259</words> Cawl grunted. “And if I stop?” The giant’s form dimmed. “Then chaos reigns. But you’ll finally be free.” <words>280</words>  

Cawl paused. Freedom sounded tempting. But the lines pulsed, a rhythm that had seeped into his straw bones. <words>299</words> He skewered the last specter, its form dissolving into pixels. “I’ll uphold the oath,” he muttered, not to the giant, but to himself. <words>319</words>  

The VR realm faded. Cawl stood again in the fossil’s shadow, the lace fan now a tattered relic. <words>336</words> The lines glowed brighter, their pulse steady. He wondered if the giant’s warning was true—if abandoning his post would unleash havoc. <words>357</words> Or if the giant, like the fan, was just another forgotten thing. <words>370</words>  

Cawl’s apathy didn’t waver, but his hands tightened on the fan. Oaths, like lines in the earth, were meant to endure. <words>390</words> Even if the reason was lost, the act remained. He skewer the air with the fan, a ritualistic gesture, and waited. <words>408</words> The lines hummed, a silent agreement. <words>415</words>
