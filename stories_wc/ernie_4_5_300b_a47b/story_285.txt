The frigid tundra orchard shuddered under a sky streaked with violet auroras, its geothermal vents hissing steam that melted the ice into fragile lace. <words>21</words> Kael, a hesitant swordsman with a blade sheathed at his hip, stood at the orchard’s edge, clutching a blank postcard that hummed faintly in his grip. <words>42</words> He’d been summoned here when the final piece of evidence—a rusted key etched with forgotten runes—was filed away in the Council’s archives, a gesture that signaled the collapse of the old world’s defenses. <words>70</words>  

His naturally awkward posture betrayed him: one hand fidgeted with the postcard’s corner while the other hovered near his sword hilt, as if bracing for a fight that might never come. <words>97</words> The orchard’s trees, gnarled and leafless, bore fruit that glowed like embers, their light flickering in time with the hermit crabs scuttling across the frost. <words>121</words> These crabs, Kael had learned, carried shells that shifted color and texture as they moved, a biological metaphor for the bridging of worlds he’d been tasked to achieve. <words>149</words>  

“You’re late,” rasped a voice from the shadows. An old hermit emerged, his face craggy as the tundra, eyes sharp as the vents’ steam. <words>170</words> “The vents are quieting. The crabs sense it too.” Kael nodded, though his throat tightened. He’d never been good with words, only with the ephemeral rancor of his blade’s edge. <words>193</words>  

The hermit pressed a small vial into Kael’s palm. “Drink this. It’ll let you see the crabs’ path.” Kael hesitated, then drank. The world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of shifting hues, the vents pulsing like veins beneath the ice. <words>222</words> The crabs’ shells now glowed with symbols—a language of the in-between. <words>233</words>  

“They move from shell to shell,” the hermit said, “but their true home is the space between. You must emerge there too, swordsman. Not with steel, but with… what’s in your hand.” Kael looked at the postcard. Blank, yet heavy with potential. <words>261</words>  

He knelt, placing the card on the ice. The crabs swarmed it, their shells’ patterns bleeding into the paper until it shimmered with a map of thresholds. <words>280</words> Kael’s breath fogged the air. To restore traditional systems, he had to become the bridge—awkward, hesitant, but unyielding. <words>299</words>  

The hermit vanished. Kael unsheathed his sword, not to strike, but to carve a single rune into the ice beside the postcard. The ground trembled. The vents roared. The crabs’ shells aligned into a portal, their collective hum a chorus of ancient harmonies. <words>328</words>  

Kael stepped through. On the other side lay a world where tradition wasn’t a relic but a living thing, where the orchard’s geothermal heat nurtured life instead of merely surviving it. <words>352</words> He turned back. The portal wavered. The postcard, now filled with scribbled coordinates, fluttered into his hand. <words>369</words>  

The hermit reappeared, smiling faintly. “You emerged.” Kael nodded, still awkward, but his grip on the postcard was firm. The crabs, their task done, scattered into the tundra, shells fading to ordinary gray. <words>395</words>  

Somewhere, a vent hissed. Somewhere, a blade remained sheathed. And somewhere, two worlds breathed as one. <words>414</words>
