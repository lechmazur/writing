The rusted outpost groaned under Elias's weight as he shifted in the weathered armchair, his gaze fixated on the patterns forming on the windowpane. [17] The atlas editor noted how condensation collected in ways that defied natural laws, arranging itself into symbols he'd only seen once before—after the falcon returned with its message-tied leg. [35] Elias, a man whose dry wit had become as legendary as his eye for cartographical anomalies, traced the droplets with his finger, their cold seeping into his skin. [56] The frozen lake beyond the glass mirrored his thoughts: serene on the surface, turbulent beneath. [70] 

Three days had passed since the falcon's arrival, bringing with it the polyglot's phrasebook that now lay open on his desk. [89] Its pages, yellowed with age and travel, smelled of distant places and forgotten tongues. [105] The dog-ear on page 147 marked the phrase "Sindhu-mahā-sāgara-sangam" in Hindi, Sanskrit, and Tibetan—a triad of translations that nagged at his scholarly mind. [133] Elias knew, with the subtle confidence that had earned him both respect and rivalry at the institute, that this was no mythological reference but something tangible. [167] 

The worrying tranquility of the outpost had increased since dawn, when he'd first noticed it: the condensation patterns weren't random. [191] They were coordinates converging, forming singular convergence points that shifted like whispers each time he looked away and back again. [220] The atlas editor opened his laptop, cross-referencing the condensation formations with satellite imagery, his fingers flying across keys whose clicks echoed like tiny heralds of revelation. [255] 

"Of course," he murmured to the empty room, the phrase falling dry as dust, "it would have to be the one place no one looks." [277] The polyglot's book had been sent by his mentor before disappearing, its dog-ear a breadcrumb he'd followed to this godforsaken outpost by the frozen lake. [304] The falcon's return had been the signal, the herald his mentor promised would come when conditions aligned. [326] 

Elias stood, his tall frame casting long shadows across maps scattered like fallen leaves. [339] The condensation on the windowpane now showed a clear pattern: three concentric circles meeting at a single point, their intersection forming a spiral that reminded him of river systems viewed from above. [374] "Where the rivers begin," he whispered, understanding flooding him with the force of a breaking dam. [392] 

The phrasebook's dog-ear marked text that, when combined with his knowledge of hydrological systems, revealed the truth. [414] Rivers didn't just begin at mountain springs; they began where underground waterways converged, where geological faults created pressure points that forced water to the surface. [447] Singular convergence—this wasn't just a phenomenon but a principle. [463] 

As evening fell, casting purple shadows across the frozen lake, Elias packed his equipment with methodical precision. [486] The worrying tranquility had transformed into something else: the calm before discovery. [506] His quest to find where the rivers begin had led him here, to this rusted outpost, after the falcon returned with the key—phrasebook pages speaking in three tongues of a place only water could know. [546] 

The condensation patterns began fading as temperature dropped, their ephemeral nature a reminder of how knowledge surfaces briefly before diving deep again. [576] Elias, with the subtlety of his confidence and the precision of his wit, knew he would be the first to chart these hidden convergence points. [608] Tomorrow, when the lake's ice reflected dawn's light, he would begin the journey inland following coordinates whispered by water itself. [642] 

The atlas editor returned to his weathered chair, pulling out his notebook to sketch the convergence points one last time before they vanished completely. [670] Somewhere beyond this outpost, beyond the frozen expanse, rivers were waiting to reveal their true origins to someone patient enough to understand their language. [705] And Elias, with his dog-eared phrasebook and patterns traced on glass, was finally ready to hear their stories. [734]
