Orion adjusted his pack, the straps fraying like his patience, as he stepped onto the disused railway platform overgrown with ivy. [14] The air smelled of damp earth and rust, a place time had forgotten, which was precisely why he’d chosen it. [28] Orion was an elusive disaster-relief logistician, a man who specialized in vanishing before the "thank you" speeches began. [47] His current disaster, however, was entirely internal and chronic: a loneliness so profound it felt like a vacuum in his chest. [70] He smiled tightly at a curling tendril of ivy, a desperate jocular mask he wore as deftly as any field uniform. [89] "Morning, green fella," he muttered, his voice echoing slightly in the cavernous station. [100] He wasn't here by accident; he was here because of a rumor, a ridiculous, improbable chain of whispers that had led him to this specific spot. [123] The rumor was about a cure, and Orion was bound by reciprocity to chase it down. [141] He had saved so many people, orchestrated relief for countless strangers, yet no one had ever seemed to know how to save him back. [166] This cure, he decided, was the universe finally settling a debt. [178] He scanned the platform, his eyes landing on a wiry old woman meticulously polishing a brass plaque. [197] She was the final link in the rumor chain, the one who supposedly held the key. [213] He approached with his signature polite anarchy, a blend of deference and chaotic energy that disarmed most people. [236] "Lovely day for antiquing, isn't it?" he said, gesturing to the station. [248] The woman squinted at him, her own smile a impossible riddle. [258] "Depends on what you're looking for, Mr. Orion," she replied, and he felt the familiar jolt of being seen. [276] He pulled the object from his pocket: a fragment of moon rock, smooth and dark, a sample from a past life in geology. [300] The rumor suggested it was part of the exchange. [310] He held it out. "They said you could catalyze a change with this. That's the word they used. Catalyze." [330] The woman took the rock, her fingers surprisingly steady. [339] "Loneliness isn't a disease, dear. It's a lack of connection," she said, her voice gentle but firm. [359] He felt his jocular facade twitch. "And you're the connection?" [371] She laughed, a sound like dry leaves skittering across concrete. [381] "Me? Heavens no. I just swap the waypoints." [391] She pointed to a rusted ladder leading up to a glass-domed cupola on the station roof. [410] "Your reciprocal payment, your moon dust, is for the next Seeker who comes along." [426] "And my cure is up there?" Orion asked, a sliver of genuine hope piercing his cynicism. [447] She just smiled again, her work on the plaque finished, revealing a single, shining word: 'Listen'. [466] Ascending the ladder was like climbing out of a tomb. [477] Inside the cupola, the world was a symphony of sounds he'd been tuning out for years. [495] The rustle of the ivy on the walls, the distant city hum, the frantic beating of his own heart. [515] He realized then what the point of the entire elaborate, improbable journey was. [532] The cure for loneliness wasn't an object or a person. [543] It was this moment, when the story he’d been forcing himself through finally changed from an external quest to an internal one. [567] The logistician, the master of moving supplies and people, had to learn how to stay still and listen. [587] He had bartered a piece of the moon, a symbol of sterile, empty space, for this small, resonant world of sound. [610] A laugh escaped him, but this time it wasn't jocular or desperate; it was just a laugh, small and real. [630] The loneliness hadn't vanished, but for the first time, it felt like a visitor, not a resident. [649] He had come looking for a cure, a tit-for-tat exchange, and found only the beginning of a conversation. [672] That, he decided, was a reciprocal agreement worth honoring. [687] </story>
