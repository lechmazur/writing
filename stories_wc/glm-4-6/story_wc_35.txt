Chef Kael stood at the ramparts of the desert fortress, the rain-slickened stones still weeping moisture under the pale moonlight. [13] His peculiar gift allowed him to taste memories in every ingredient he handled, but tonight, his own flavors were too bitter to consume. [29] Kael's hands trembled as he gripped the parapet, knowing his touch could transfer emotions to others like a contagion—another burden of his inherited sensitivity. [48] The fortress had withstood countless sieges, yet its sturdy exterior was betrayed by brittle fractures spreading through its ancient mortar, much like his own facade. [69] 

He dreamed nightly of the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes, a place where remorse collected like seafoam, preserved in frozen crystalline formations. [94] The desert sands had once been ocean floor, and the pavilion remained as testament to that forgotten shoreline, accessible only when rain fell and the desert transformed. [123] At the close of his unspoken dream each night, Kael would wake with salt on his tongue, yearning to reach the delicate architecture that housed the world's accumulated regrets. [152] 

His motivation drove him relentlessly—the desperate need to sandpaper rough memories with coarser ones, to dull specific pains through overwhelming sorrow. [178] Kael believed that by subsuming the stored remorse from the pavilion, he might finally taste his own food without the bitterness of what he had done. [209] 

Descending from the fortress, he moved toward the newly formed tidal pools that littered the valley floor, each a perfect mirror reflecting stars above and secrets below. [241] The method for finding the pavilion's entrance had been passed down through generations of chefs with his gift: analyze the tidal pool formations and follow those whose ripples didn't match the wind's direction. [283] 

Kael knelt beside the largest pool, his reflection wavering in the water that shouldn't exist in a desert. [304] His dark eyes searched for the tell-tale signs—anomalies in the wave patterns that indicated the pavilion's presence beneath the sand. [334] When he spotted it, the perfect hexagonal ripple that defied physics, his heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird. [362] 

The desert breeze seemed to hold its breath as Kael plunged his hands into the water, knowing his emotional contagion might alert those searching for him. [392] The sand gave way beneath his knees as he followed the strange current downward, through layers of earth and time, toward the coral structure below. [426] 

The icebound pavilion glittered in the bioluminescent darkness, its coral skeletons wrapped in frost that never melted despite the desert sun above. [458] Columns of regret reached toward the cavern ceiling, each harboring memories so painful they had crystallized into physical form. [486] 

Kael approached the central altar where remorse pooled like liquid mercury, the most potent collection preserved for those brave enough to subsume it. [518] He needed only touch it, to absorb the accumulated sorrows of generations into himself. [540] 

His fingers brushed against the cold surface, and the histories of hundreds flooded his senses—lives lost, love unspoken, opportunities squandered. [571] The stored remorse of the pavilion merged with his own guilt, each memory sandpapered down until nothing remained but a dull ache of general human suffering. [610] 

When Kael returned to the fortress above, dawn was breaking over rain-washed sands. [628] His gift remained, but now he could slice vegetables without tasting the moment his father fell from the cliff's edge. [654] He could knead bread without feeling his mother's death whispers in his palms. [673] The emotional contagion in his touch had lessened, now merely tinged with shared humanity rather than specific agony. [701] 

The fortress baked in the returning desert heat, its sturdy exterior once again masking its brittleness—just like Kael, who would now cook for others without serving his own pain as secret ingredients. [740]
