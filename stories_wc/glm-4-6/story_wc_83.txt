<story>The humming of the observatory failed for the seventh time that day, and Elias counted the seconds until the emergency generators would kick in, while circuit breakers cooled their relay-sensitive hearts. [23] He ran his thumb over the geode crystal in his pocket, its rough exterior a stark contrast to the amethyst formations within—just as his appearance masked the wreckage of the man who once stood smiling beside his bride in a Afghanistan courtyard. [58] The floating observatory drifted in the thermosphere above Earth, its research purpose abandoned after the corporation folded, its new inhabitants those seeking refuge from gravity—in every sense. [97] Elias had arrived nine months ago, drawn by the isolation and the one thing on which the equipment still worked: the Potential Resonance Mapper, a device that could detect what might have been, what could be, and where all the unused moments pooled beneath the surface of reality. [156] As the lights flickered back on, bathing the circular room in a cool blue glow, Elias approached the main console where mathematics and metaphysics merged into something approaching truth. [195] "Other worlds exist within our world," he whispered to the empty chamber, intangibly tangible realities branching from every choice, every possibility not realized. [221] His fingers danced across the controls, initiating his hunt through perturbation theory, analyzing how small alterations in the timeline of his own ill-fated wedding day had created cascading effects that rippled through the fabric of what could have been. [271] The monitor displayed calculated realities where the drone had malfunctioned, where the wedding had moved indoors, where Elias had never returned from his tour—each a perfect world budding from a different choice point. [307] His bride's laughter echoed in these simulated timelines, haunting and beautiful, until the algorithm identified them: concentrations of potential energy where possibilities remained unspent. [340] These were places where someone's life had been cut short, where dreams died early, where promises remained unfulfilled—potential crystallizing into something that could almost be measured, almost held. [379] Elias felt the familiar cocktail of bleak exhilaration rise in his chest as he discovered the pattern: these pools formed strongest at sites of sudden tragedy, at moments when futures evaporated in an instant. [420] He pulled out the geode crystal, its interior glowing with patterns that mirrored the screens before him—the hexagonal formations repeating like mathematical proofs of alternate lives. [455] The unfiltered awakening had come to him in fragments during his recovery, but here suspended between Earth and sky, it crystallized: potential was not lost but transformed, remaining accessible to those who understood physics and grief in equal measure. [502] The wedding had been a moment orthogonal to the vector of his expected life, the drone strike a perturbation that sent him spinning into this new trajectory where potential could be mapped and perhaps even harvested. [543] As the observatory's systems stabilized, Elias entered new coordinates, beginning the real hunt—not for closure, not for meaning, but for the energy that pulsed in the spaces between lived and unlived lives. [583] He would become a cartographer of what never was, a theologian of the potential realm, assembling a physics of possibility from the fragments of other people's futures, his own included. [625] The geode crystal vibrated against his palm, resonating with the first signature he would investigate: a classroom in a country town where teachers with unwritten lessons sat waiting on a Tuesday morning that would never arrive. [674] Elias prepared for the descent, the circuit breakers humming their approval, his body thrumming with the anticipatory horror and ecstasy of touching something that should not exist but did—intangibly, tangibly, waiting for him in the space between heartbeats. [728] He was no longer just a drone strike wedding survivor but a hunter of the richest resource in all of existence: the infinite repository of what might have been, pooling somewhere beneath the surface of everything.
