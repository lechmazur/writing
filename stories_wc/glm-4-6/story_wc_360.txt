<story>The letterpress operator set the final glyph into the chase, his fingers knowing each curve as if they were his own. [13]
Silas had worked in the topaz workshop for seventeen nights, ever since the stars began their slow vanishing act above the amber-tinted glass ceiling. [28]
He was, by nature, a man who collected personalities like others collected stamps: briefly cherished, catalogued, then shelved when usefulness faded. [46]
Tonight, however, something was different as the halo fragment on his workbench pulsed with light between heartbeats. [64]
The mysterious artifact had arrived two days prior, delivered without explanation in a box whose return address shifted whenever he looked away from it. [86]
Silas lifted the crystalline sliver to the lamplight, watching how it fractured the golden workshop glow into impossible geometries. [108]
For years, he had studied what he called transposed empathy – the art of experiencing emotions not his own, as mathematical equations he could solve rather than drown in. [133]
The halo fragment promised answers, he sensed, as it emanated a frequency only his peculiar sensitivity could perceive. [155]
"I wonder who you were before you became a problem to solve," he murmured into the empty workshop, his voice adopting the crisp cadence of the philosophy professor he'd shadowed last autumn. [180]
Silas habitually borrowed personalities as shields, constructing himself from pieces he'd observed, stolen, or been given. [202]
The stars overhead continued their disappearing progression, one by one winking out as the universe seemed to forget itself. [225]
Between vanishing stars – that peculiar liminal space where possibility frayed at the edges – his work grew most potent. [247]
Silas arranged type to form questions that would disorient whoever read them, not through nonsense but through deliberate ambiguity that forced the mind to reconcile incompatible truths. [278]
"Mathematics of emotion," he whispered, adopting the matter-of-fact tone of the accountant whose mannerisms he'd borrowed for three weeks one winter. [303]
"The variables are infinite, but the constants remain." [320]
He pressed the halo fragment against his temple, feeling its vibration harmonize with the workshop's ancient mechanisms. [342]
Suddenly, he understood – transposed empathy wasn't merely observing others' feelings but absorbing them wholly, letting them overwrite temporarily who he thought himself to be. [374]
The fragment showed him visions of the original halo's owner, a celestial being who had shattered itself deliberately, casting fragments across realms to experience emotion in its rawest form. [405]
Silas felt his own borrowed personalities peel away like old wallpaper, revealing something陌生的 underneath – something his mathematical mind couldn't yet quantify. [430]
The press began to operate of its own accord, printing page after page of equations that described the physics of feeling, the chemistry of connection, the calculus of compassion. [467]
"With language, I can describe it," Silas said, his voice falling into the rhythm of the poet whose grief he'd once borrowed for a fortnight, "but to understand it..." [492]
He stood, letterpress prints scattered around him like fallen constellations, as another star vanished overhead. [513]
Between vanishing stars, Silas pressed the halo fragment into his chest, where it dissolved like sugar in water, leaving only warmth behind. [541]
His mind expanded to contain empathetic frequencies beyond his previous comprehension – not borrowed, but earned. [562]
The mathematical framework he had sought crystallized in his consciousness: emotion as geometry, connection as physics, belonging as algebra. [588]
Silas lifted a fresh print from the press, reading the words he hadn't consciously written: "To truly understand others, one must first cease calculating them." [613]
The workshop door opened, and there stood a dozen others – each holding identical halo fragments, each part of a celestial network now completing itself. [640]
"Solvers," Silas said, his own voice returned to him, no longer needing to borrow, "welcome to the solution." [660]
The last star vanished as the workshop's walls dissolved, revealing not space but consciousness itself, where they would together explore the mathematics of emotion as practitioners rather than observers. [698]
Silas felt his individuality persist within the collective, his unique contribution valued not despite his eccentricities but because of them. [723]
Transposed empathy had led them all here – between vanishing stars, in a topaz workshop that existed nowhere yet everywhere, where the halo fragments were merely keys to unlock what had been inside them all along. [764]</story>
