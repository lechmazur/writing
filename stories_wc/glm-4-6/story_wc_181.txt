Margaret Holloway, bewildered curator of esoteric artifacts, stared at the pistachio shell cameo blank that had appeared on her desk that morning. [19] The artifact was simply complicated—a perfect oval of iridescent shell carved with nothing yet somehow containing everything. [28] She had inherited it from her predecessor, or rather, she would inherit it next Tuesday, or perhaps had inherited it last year; the nonlinear nature of the inheritance made her head ache. [47] Margaret needed to inquire about its origins, about why her predecessor's note simply read "Between the first and last page." [62]

Determined to pursue the forbidden knowledge it clearly represented, Margaret took the cameo to the museum's restricted wing. [78] As she held it, the shell warmed against her palm, and suddenly she stood in an astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid, the branches heavy with crystalline fruits. [102] The disquiet of her situation brightened as she realized each piece of fruit contained a stolen moment from someone else's life—experiences not yet lived, memories not yet formed. [126]

Returning to her office without understanding how she'd left, Margaret decided to take a break in the staff restroom. [140] While washing her hands, she had a philosophical breakthrough in the bathroom: the cameo wasn't showing the future but allowing her to inherit experiences out of sequence. [165] The nonlinear inheritance wasn't about time but about consciousness—she was receiving knowledge meant for other versions of herself in other timelines. [185]

That night, Margaret took the cameo home, compelled to understand the orchard better. [197] Sleep offered little escape, as she found herself back among the blossoming trees, now noticing visitors—other curators, other inheriters wandering through the same space. [219] Each visitor held a similar pistachio shell, their faces illuminated by the simply complicated glow of forbidden knowledge they shouldn't possess. [242]

Back in reality, Margaret began having more frequent philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms during her workdays. [256] Each revelation brought her closer to understanding: the astral orchard existed between the first and last page of reality itself, a repository of experiences that had fallen through narrative gaps. [283] Her bewilderment transformed into brightened disquiet as she realized the orchard wasn't on an asteroid at all—it was within the cameo shell's inner curvature, accessible only to those willing to pursue knowledge that broke the boundaries of linear existence. [318]

Margaret started documenting her visits to the orchard, though the notes would rewrite themselves when she wasn't looking. [336] The simply complicated nature of her inheritance made precise recording impossible—she might describe a tree that hadn't bloomed yet, or fruit that would only exist next decade. [358] Each time she tried to inquire about the orchard's purpose, her own handwriting would change, answering questions she hadn't formulated with responses she couldn't comprehend. [383]

One particularly vivid bathroom breakthrough revealed the truth: the curator position wasn't a job but a responsibility inherited across lifetimes and realities. [406] Each bewilderied curator before her had passed down not just artifacts but the accumulated knowledge of an infinite number of their alternate selves. [425] The pistachio shell cameo blank was simply complicated because it was a key—that which unlocks by being unlocked, a door that becomes a hallway once passed through. [449]

Weeks blurred between museum visits and orchard wanderings until Margaret could no longer distinguish which version of herself was writing the catalogue entries. [470] She came to accept the brightened disquiet as her natural state, the space between understanding and confusion where real knowledge resided. [492] The lonely asteroid orchard felt less foreign than her own reflection, the crystalline fruits more nourishing than food. [512]

On the day she understood she would need to find her successor, Margaret prepared a simple note: "Between the first and last page—don't try to make sense, simply inherit." [537] She placed the pistachio shell cameo blank on her desk, not with dread but with the strange joy of someone who had learned to love the spaces between moments. [563] As she walked away, Margaret wondered which version of herself would next inherit the orchard, and whether they too would find themselves having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms while pursuing knowledge that shouldn't exist but inevitably did. [598]

In the end, the bewildered curator realized that nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or a gift but simply complicated existence itself—full of beauty, terror, and lonely asteroids blossoming with impossible fruit. [627] The astral orchard would continue growing between the first and last page, awaiting the next curious soul willing to inquire beyond the boundaries of what should be known. [656] The cameo shell would remain both empty and full, its simply complicated surface reflecting every version of the curator who had dared to pursue forbidden knowledge while finding brightened disquiet in the bathroom revelations that changed everything and nothing at all.
