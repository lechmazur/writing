Elias stood before the narrow door, his breath held tight in his chest as he prepared to perpetuate the family curse. [15] He was the son of the boy who cried wolf, and despite his lifelong efforts to speak only truth, no one ever believed his warnings came genuine. [27] Now, in the light of a copper sunset that bathed the lighthouse prison in melancholic repose, time was running short—before they find the bodies, he needed to escape. [46] The prison, erected decades ago on this jagged reef, had once been a monastery, which explained the confessional lattice that now adorned his cell door like a grim reminder of prayers unanswered. [70] His father's legacy had followed him here, where every shouted alarm he'd raised about the warden's midnight activities had been dismissed as more familial fiction. [92] Tonight, however, he would chase hush not with warning shouts but with the silence of disappearance, threading this labyrinth with his own story for once. [114]

Elias approached the narrow door left ajar for decades, its weathered surface bearing scuffs that told tales of countless prisoners who had traced the same path to nowhere. [140] Through those scuffed patterns, he knew, lay the only way out—a passage that sustained impossibilities by existing where no passage should. [164] The convicts whispered that this threshold could hover between worlds if one knew how to pass through it properly. [183] Elias placed his palm against the cool wood, remembering how the warden had installed the repurposed confessional lattice after discovering prisoners were plotting through the walls. [208] "Let them talk to God instead of traitors," he had proclaimed, and God, Elias suspected, was the only one who might listen to the son of the boy who cried wolf. [230]

As the copperlight deepened to bruised purple, Elias examined the method of passage he'd spent months deciphering from the scratches on the narrow door. [256] Former inmates had encoded their knowledge there, creating a map that only became visible when viewed through the tiny holes of the confessional lattice at just the right angle. [288] Elias knelt, positioning the lattice panel he had carefully unscrewed from his cell door, its wooden bars worn smooth by countless penitent hands. [315] Through those holes, the scuffs rearranged themselves into instructions, a labyrinth of directions that he had memorized in the secrecy of countless nights. [342] He needed to hover at the threshold of faith and disbelief, to sustain the impossibility of walking through a solid stone wall. [367]

The reef crashed below as wind howled through the lighthouse tower, carrying the scent of salt and regret. [385] Elias traced the pattern with his finger, tasting the metallic tang of air as he prepared to chase hush across this final barrier. [407] If his father had taught him one thing, it was that lies could become truth if told enough times; perhaps then, a solid wall could become a doorway if you believed it so. [432] He lifted the confessional lattice, peering through its intricate wooden pattern as the wall beyond began to shimmer like heat on metal. [455] Copperlight repose enveloped him as he tentatively placed one foot forward, hovering between worlds, between the certainty of his cell and the impossibility of freedom. [480]

The wall yielded without resistance—no crumble, no give, just a gradual permeation as if Elias himself were becoming nothing more than story and air. [508] He emerged on the outer walkway of the lighthouse prison, the jagged reef stretching toward the horizon like broken teeth. [529] Behind him, through the narrow door left ajar for decades, he could hear the warden's footsteps approaching to check on his most troublesome inmate. [553] But Elias was already threading the final stretch of his labyrinth, climbing the lighthouse steps toward the beacon that sustained impossibilities every night, cutting through darkness with light the way he was cutting through his own destiny. [587]

When dawn broke and the authorities finally arrived to investigate the reports Elias had been making for months, they would find the bodies of three prisoners the warden had executed and concealed in the tower's lower chamber. [619] They would discover Elias's cell empty, the confessional lattice removed and leaning against the wall as if in final confession. [642] By then, he would be miles away, no longer the son of the boy who cried wolf but a man who had learned to chase hush with the truth, threading labyrinths of disbelief with stories that could finally be believed, because this time, they were real.
