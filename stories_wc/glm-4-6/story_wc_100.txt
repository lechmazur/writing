<story>The undertaker's fingers trembled as he unwrapped the package that arrived three days after Mrs. Hargrove's final ceremony. [13] Marcus had been in this profession for twenty-seven years, and never had a client's posthumous delivery contained more than insurance paperwork and mementos for relatives. [29] Inside the aged leather box lay a shattered lighthouse lens, its once-brilliant prisms now fractured like frozen lightning against velvet. [42] The accompanying note read only: "They need you to send them home." [51] 

Mrs. Hargrove had been the lighthouse keeper's widow, a woman who insisted her husband still walked the beaches after his death, searching for something he'd lost. [71] As a weary undertaker who'd seen more spirits than he'd cared to discuss, Marcus understood the importance of giving rest a permanent address rather than allowing souls to wander eternally. [89] This broken lens, he somehow knew, was meant to send distress signals—not to save living sailors, but to guide the lost dead. [108] 

For three nights, Marcus worked in his basement, his inadvertent stubbornness manifesting as an obsessive refusal to accept the lens as beyond repair. [128] The fractures wouldn't respond to any conventional method of restoration, each time he attempted to fuse them, they separated further. [144] "Impossible," he muttered at 3:17 AM, knowing the word only challenged him more. [156] 

His research led to forgotten texts about underwater libraries, structures submerged when coastlines shifted centuries ago, preserving knowledge in pressure-controlled vaults. [177] The city of Mirrormere, drowned in 1889, supposedly contained the only written accounts of revitalizing crystalline objects through occupying impossible spaces. [197] 

Six weeks and three life-threatening diving expeditions later, Marcus stood inside the underwater city library, its dome-shaped reading rooms remarkably intact despite the crushing depths. [219] The walls were lined with waterproof manuscripts preserved in gelatinous cases, while fish darted between bookshelves like curious librarians. [238] 

The text he sought described a dangerous technique: one must occupy simultaneously existing spaces—becoming present in multiple realities at once—to properly realign crystalline structures. [259] The process required the practitioner to exist both inside and outside the material, in life and death simultaneously. [277] 

Marcus closed his eyes in the circular chamber, focusing on the shattered lens he'd risked everything to bring here. [292] The underwater environment muffled all sound, creating a profound stillness that kept eluding him no matter how deeply he sought it. [310] 

When he finally found the method of occupying impossible spaces, the sensation was like being torn apart and reassembled molecule by molecule. [329] In this liminal state, he could feel the lens's history: the lighthouse keeper signaling his wife even after death, the desperate attempts to communicate across veils. [349] 

His hands moved in the strange space-between-spaces, pieces of lens reorienting themselves not through physical force but through resonance with his own divided existence. [370] The undertaker who routinely buried others now understood why some spirits refused to settle—permanent rest required an acceptance he himself had never achieved. [388] 

As the lens reformed with internal light, Marcus felt the weight of countless unquiet souls pressing in, their distress signals seeking release. [405] The revitalized lens projected across the water, upward through the ocean ceiling, into a darkness beyond physical reality. [423] 

Messages traveled as light waves carrying not words but comprehension—directions to peace for those who'd endlessly searched shorelines and empty rooms. [442] The lens functioned as both beacon and receiver, acknowledging the lost while offering them permanent addresses in the afterlife. [461] 

Back on surface days later, Marcus watched from his seaside workshop as the repaired lens rotated atop the old lighthouse, now functioning without electricity or fuel. [483] Distress signals emanated nightly, soft golden pulses visible only to those with one foot already in another world. [500] 

The weary undertaker felt moments of chased stillness approaching—a quiet that seemed within reach before slipping away like dissolving seafoam. [518] Mrs. Hargrove's spirit appeared beside him one evening, transparent in the moonlight, her face peaceful for the first time. [534] 

"He received your signal," she whispered. "The coast is finally clear." [543] 

Marcus nodded, his inadvertent stubbornness now serving others rather than driving him to exhaustion. [556] The broken lens had revitalized not just its structure but its purpose, transforming from simple glass to a portal between worlds. [573] 

The underwater library returned to silence, its impossible spaces once again undisturbed. [584] The weary undertaker continued his work, burying the dead while sending them onward, perpetually seeking his own permanent address in a stillness that kept chasing him. [604] 

Some nights, when the lens signals reached their peak, Marcus could almost taste the rest he offered others—until dawn broke, and the chase began anew. [624]</story>
