Elian tightened the leather tool belt around their waist, the metal tools clinking softly in the early morning hush of the labyrinth corridors. [16] As the labyrinth's maintenance worker, their days followed patterns as intricate as the maze itself, cleaning forgotten passages and repairing worn stones that had withstood centuries of wandering souls. [33] Yet something extraordinary lurked beneath Elian's ordinary duties, a miracle as mundane as clockwork that began with the discovery of an astronomer's broken sextant tucked behind a loose stone in corridor K-17. [59] The sextant, its bronze frame still gleaming despite age, didn't measure celestial bodies when Elian accidentally aligned its arms—it quantified sorrow instead, transforming unspoken grief into measurable columns of liquid light that pooled in its chambers. [88]

Elian learned the sextant's purpose gradually, first watching as it absorbed the lingering despair of visitors who had lost their way physically and spiritually in the labyrinth's twisting passages. [116] The device healed in moonlight, its fractures visibly mending when bathed in the silver glow that filtered through skylights, restoring its ability to transform intangible emotions into something tangible. [145] Elian's true motivation, the secret they never shared with the labyrinth's administrators, was to discover what trees witnessed after generations of standing sentinel over human sorrows and joys. [176] They had observed how trees at the labyrinth's edges seemed to shift position imperceptibly, as if they carried memories of all who had passed beneath their branches. [201]

The next step in Elian's quiet research came when they realized they could deconstruct the pillars of quantified sorrow collected by the sextant. [225] The method proved peculiar yet effective: by mapping scattered dreams that materialized as misty apparitions throughout the labyrinth during quiet hours, Elian could break down the sorrow into its constituent parts. [257] Each dream mapped revealed fragments of the trees' collected memories—bits of conversations kissed on benches beneath ancient oaks, lullabies hummed to sleeping children during midnight walks, whispered confessions pressed against bark during desperate moments. [302] Elian documented these findings in a worn notebook, their maintenance schedule stretched thin as they balanced practical repairs with midnight dream-mapping sessions. [333]

The breakthrough came during a stormlit evening when Elian carried the repaired sextant to the highest tower of the labyrinth, where the oldest tree in the region could be seen silhouetted against the sky. [370] Rain lashed against the tower's stone walls while lightning intermittently illuminated the astronomer's tool that now served as a conduit between human consciousness and botanical witness. [404] At the moment a pin was heard in a silent corridor below—a sound Elian recognized as the weighted release mechanism they had repaired weeks earlier—the sextant began to pulse with ethereal light. [438] The tower's stormlit atmosphere transformed as moonlight broke through the clouds, bathing the scene in an otherworldly glow that made the quantified sorrow visible as golden threads connecting the tower to the distant tree. [477]

As Elian adjusted the sextant's angle, the scattered dreams they had been mapping for months suddenly merged into a coherent sequence of images flowing from the tree to the device. [511] What trees witnessed, Elian now understood, was neither judgment nor indifference but absorption—the trees took in human emotions as they did sunlight and rain, converting our quantified sorrow into growth rings, leaf patterns, and root systems. [550] The sextant hummed with this revelation, its broken pieces fully healed in the moonlight, while the storm outside softened to rain. [576] Elian lowered the instrument, their hands trembling slightly as they recorded the final observation in their notebook, knowing the mundane miracle they had uncovered would forever change how they maintained not just the labyrinth's passages but its living memories. [621]

The next morning, Elian resumed their usual duties, tools clinking as they swept a corridor no different from the one where they'd first found the broken sextant. [648] The labyrinth's visitors rushed past, unaware that the trees surrounding them held catalogs of human experience, that quantified sorrow had been measured and understood, that dreams could be mapped like constellations. [683] Elian smiled at the ordinary miracle of this knowledge—that the maintenance of places also required the maintenance of their invisible histories, that keeping paths clear meant preserving the trees' quiet witnessing.
