The walnut-ink archivist stood at the edge of the blooming jetty at twilight, watching as luminous flowers that had sprung from the weathered wooden planks swayed in the evening breeze. [16] Elias had maintained this peculiar stretch of pier for decades, since the day it had first begun to bloom with the impossible flora that marked it as a place where worlds touched. [32] His fingers, stained permanently from years of working with walnut-ink, trace the outline of the locket photo he always wore, its silver warm against his skin. [52] The image inside was of her, Melina, her smile captured in the split second before she had slipped into the waters twenty years ago, just as the jetty was beginning its first bloom. [80] Elias believed her disappearance had somehow sparked the regeneration of the covenant between his world and whatever lay beneath these waters, a pact that required gentle maintenance. [107] "Today marks the day when context changes," he whispered to himself, feeling the familiar bittersweet rise of haunted euphoria that always accompanied this annual ritual. [130] Each year on the anniversary of her vanishing, the archivist would steep himself in the memories, allowing them to wash over him like the evening tide. [155] This was his method: working through proximate causes to understand not just what had happened, but the chain of events that had led to each moment worth preserving. [184] Elias began his journey back to the small conservatory he had built on the shore, his steps slow and deliberate on the wooden path. [206] Inside, jars filled with walnut-ink lined shelves stretching to the ceiling, their dark contents holding the essence of hundreds of small moments he had documented over the years. [238] The regenerated covenant required that he preserve not just grand events, but the weight of small moments that might otherwise be lost to time. [267] Tonight, however, was different from all other nights; tonight, he would finally document the proximate causes that had led to Melina's disappearance. [295] His approach had always been gently thorough, so he began not with the moment she fell, but weeks earlier, when she had first mentioned the strange dreams of underwater cities. [329] As the archivist worked, dipping his brush into the walnut-ink, he steeped himself deeper into the memory, reliving each conversation with a clarity that time should have eroded. [360] The blooming jetty outside cast an ethereal glow through his windows, twilight deepening as evening progressed. [379] Elias didn't need to look at the locket photo to recall her face; it was etched into his mind as clearly as the ink he used. [405] Through his years of investigation into proximate causes, he had discovered that others had vanished here too, always during the jetty's peak bloom. [433] The regenerated covenant had been ancient, renewed with each sacrifice made to whatever entity lay beneath the waters. [458] He had sworn an oath to preserve these moments gently, thoroughly documenting not just the loss but the beauty of what remained. [483] The haunted euphoria that washed over Elias was familiar now – the joy of purpose mixed with the ache of absence. [507] As he worked, deep into the night, the archivist began to understand the full scope of what he was preserving. [530] The locket photo was not just a memento of loss but proof of connection, a physical manifestation of love strong enough to bridge worlds. [563] When finally he put down his brush, the document was complete: a record of every small moment that had led to the covenant's renewal. [593] Elias returned to the blooming jetty, now bathed in moonlight, where a single luminous flower, larger and brighter than all the others, had grown at the precise spot where Melina had last stood. [632] The archivist knew it was time. [636] Removing the locket photo from his neck, he placed it on the bloom and stepped back, watching as the flower slowly folded around the silver, closing like a gentle fist. [672] The regenerated covenant was not just about taking but about giving back, preserving not only memories but the very moments that had birthed them. [705] As the jetty began to recede beneath the waves, Elias felt the familiar rise of haunted euphoria, mingled this time with acceptance. [736] His work was done – the weight of small moments preserved through walnut-ink, through proximate causes, through the gently thorough documentation of a love that transcended worlds. [778]
