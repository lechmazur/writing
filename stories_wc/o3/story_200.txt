The last roadside vendor tied his canvas and vanished into the violet mist, leaving the streets emptied of barter. <words>19</words>
That fading clatter was the cue Nerin, a hesitant saboteur, had rehearsed in feverish secrecy. <words>34</words>
He slipped from the portico and followed the avenue toward the citadel's harmonic resonance chamber, heart drumming uneven warnings. <words>53</words>
On his palm lay a compass that always points to home, its needle quivering like a caged finch. <words>71</words>
Such instruments were functionally rare, forged only for monarchs afraid of forgetting their own doorways. <words>86</words>
Nerin had stolen it to judge distances not by north or south but by regret. <words>101</words>
Every streetlamp he passed flickered, offering subtle signs that his tampering with fate was already noticed. <words>117</words>
Yet a savage serenity settled over him, the violent calm of someone who has decided to break gently. <words>135</words>
His mission was not destruction but assembly, to piece together a mosaic from shattered hopes the regime had scattered. <words>154</words>
Within the chamber, sound itself ruled, each wall tuned to magnify whispers into tidal waves. <words>169</words>
Reaching its arched threshold, he stilled and tapped his boots, letting the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones speak first. <words>188</words>
The floor echoed back coordinates, revealing hidden seams where splintered dreams had been entombed as acoustic bric-a-brac. <words>205</words>
Guided by those pulses, he loosened the marble tiles, collecting shards: a lullaby lost in conscription, a vow drowned in taxes, a child's query smothered by curfew. <words>232</words>
Each fragment glimmered when near the compass, as if homesick for promises never kept. <words>246</words>
But the central tessera, the piece shaped like tomorrow, was lodged inside the royal amplifier humming above. <words>263</words>
To reach it, Nerin would have to climb the lattice of resonant strings and risk awakening the city with a single wrong note. <words>286</words>
He inhaled the chamber's metallic hush, then stepped, counting six-beat intervals, weaving silence between vibrations like a thief knitting shadow. <words>306</words>
The amplifier thrummed approval, misreading his cadence as loyal devotion, a subtle sign that even tyrannical machines crave praise. <words>325</words>
He pried out the tessera, and at once the compass screamed, its needle spinning before snapping back toward an origin deeper than blood. <words>348</words>
Harmonies collapsed; pillars shook like tuning forks beaten against bone, yet Nerin remained wrapped in savage serenity. <words>365</words>
He let the ruins conduct their dying chord, then walked out, carrying the mosaic unassembled but alive. <words>382</words>
Outside, the city listened to the quiet after thunder, unsure whether dawn or dread would arrive next. <words>399</words>
Nerin felt the compass tug him homeward, not to a place, but to the people whose hopes he now carried, eager for judging daylight to reassemble them. <words>426</words>
