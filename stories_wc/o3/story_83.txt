The leaves skittered across the cracked linoleum like gossiping ghosts, reminding me that my cover story involved diligent groundskeeping. <words>19</words>
Officially I was the new custodian, raking the courtyard oaks, but secretly I was a cryptid researcher working undercover. <words>38</words>
I pushed the last heap of bronze leaves against the door, slipped inside the abandoned research lab, and faced its notorious labyrinth of broken mirrors. <words>63</words>
Every cracked pane reflected a sliver of me and a rumor of something else, as though reality itself preferred rumors. <words>83</words>
My employer believed a shy cryptid nested here, lured by reflective mazes the way moths seek flame. <words>100</words>
To find the creature I had to excel where previous hunters failed, and my mischievous wisdom whispered that luck loves preparation. <words>121</words>
So I carried nothing noisy, only a battered plastic tray cradling a single blackened candle. <words>136</words>
By tracing the burn pattern in a blackened candle wick, cryptozoologists can read spoor the way botanists read rings in cedar. <words>157</words>
Each charred curve records fateful encounters between wax and air, hinting where shy beings disturb invisible currents. <words>174</words>
Tonight the wick curled toward corridor eight, a direction the floor plan refused to admit existed. <words>190</words>
I turned, trusting the candle like a suspiciously trusting gambler trusts a loaded die, half sure of trickery, half craving it. <words>211</words>
Glass shards under my boots jingled softly, telling the empty corridors that another story had entered their echo. <words>229</words>
Corridor eight revealed itself as a service shaft stuffed with research posters about photosynthetic marsupials, each torn or watermarked by negligence. <words>250</words>
I paused during leaf raking only long enough to read one slogan: 'Observe gently, intervene only to sow seeds of a better tomorrow'. <words>273</words>
Those words matched my own motivation, though the budget office had rephrased it into colder metrics. <words>289</words>
Suddenly a reflection rippled beside me, not in glass but in midair, as though the mirror had decided to detach from its frame. <words>312</words>
The ripple resolved into a small creature, fur like burnt silver, eyes like wet bark, holding an impossibly intact maple leaf. <words>333</words>
I knelt, placed the battered plastic tray on the tiles, and offered the candle's warm halo instead of a net. <words>353</words>
The cryptid sniffed the smoke, nodded with grave mischief, and arranged the maple leaf on the tray like a treaty. <words>373</words>
When it touched the leaf, veins glowed, and every broken mirror hummed, stitching its fragments into an unbroken corridor of dawn. <words>394</words>
I realized that fateful encounters are not accidents but invitations, and I had RSVP'd by tracing a candle instead of cocking a rifle. <words>417</words>
The creature vanished, the mirrors healed, and outside the leaves finally settled, as if the world itself had finished raking. <words>437</words>
Carrying the glowing maple leaf as evidence, I stepped back into my custodian disguise, already curious about the next corridor luck would whisper. <words>460</words>
