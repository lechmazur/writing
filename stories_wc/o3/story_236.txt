The meek blacksmith Thalen pressed his calloused fingers against the glassy dome window. <words>13</words>
Outside, ink-blue seahorses drifted past the underwater city planning office like lost commas. <words>26</words>
He was no architect, yet hammers echoed in his memory, urging new shapes. <words>39</words>
The department kept him as a clerk because steel hearts scare blueprints into obedience. <words>53</words>
Still, Thalen remained openly hidden, moving softly, signing permits nobody read. <words>64</words>
In his desk drawer slept a battered softcover dictionary he forged from discarded kelp-pulp. <words>78</words>
Every noon he unlocked it, breathing definitions like sparks over unlit coal. <words>90</words>
Those sparks belonged to the unfinished bargain he once struck with the tide. <words>103</words>
He had promised to craft a word capable of mending his lover's shattered gills. <words>117</words>
But the lover drowned before language cooled, leaving his promise half forged, half ash. <words>131</words>
Since then he labored to harness heartbreak as fuel, though guilt burned brighter. <words>144</words>
Regulations forbade fires here, yet luminous regret demands its own loopholes. <words>155</words>
So Thalen sought ignition through stories instead of flame. <words>164</words>
Random hitchhikers drifted through coral corridors, exchanging rumors for stamps upon transit ledgers. <words>177</words>
Thalen listened, verifying half-baked stories from random hitchhikers to see which ones glowed. <words>190</words>
A tale properly tested could ignite the dormant syllable he owed the sea. <words>203</words>
Today, an urchin-coated traveler whispered of a clocktower stranded across the hush of time’s final ripple. <words>219</words>
The image pierced Thalen's lungs like sunrise through rust. <words>228</words>
He recognized the distant tower where his lover’s laughter once measured tides. <words>240</words>
That confirmation meant the bargain still breathed somewhere beyond bureaucratic silt. <words>251</words>
Thalen closed the ledger, heart ringing like anvil struck by memory. <words>262</words>
He signed himself an exit permit addressed simply, 'Clocktower, Past-Future Trench'. <words>273</words>
The planning chief, a stern jellyfish, drifted near, tentacles forming reluctant approval stamps. <words>286</words>
Even authority felt lighter beneath the pull of unfinished vows. <words>296</words>
Carrying the softcover dictionary like a shield, Thalen stepped into the transit current. <words>309</words>
Pages fluttered, each definition leaking phosphorescence that mapped his path through duskwater tunnels. <words>322</words>
Yet every glow reminded him of what was lost, and therefore powered him. <words>335</words>
He emerged before the clocktower, its gears stalled, its bell an unwept tear. <words>348</words>
Thalen opened the dictionary to the blank page he had always feared. <words>360</words>
The page was openly hidden, visible only when regret shone bright enough. <words>372</words>
With trembling tongue he spoke the tested story into that emptiness. <words>383</words>
Letters ignited, swirling like molten horseshoes, fusing sorrow and hope into a single word. <words>397</words>
The clocktower inhaled the word, gears lurching, bell releasing a chord of luminous regret. <words>411</words>
From the chord poured water, not drowning but healing, shaping gills from broken skin. <words>425</words>
Within the spray stood his lover, eyes reflecting both forgiveness and the hush of time’s final ripple. <words>442</words>
Thalen knelt as heartbreak transformed into glowing iron, at last completing the bargain. <words>455</words>
Together they returned to the city, carrying a word bright enough to rebuild worlds. <words>469</words>
