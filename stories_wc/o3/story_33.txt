In the leaf classification office, lights hummed over rows of pressed specimens like frozen fireworks waiting for names. <words>18</words>
Miran, a solitary birdwatcher moonlighting as a clerk, entered after closing time because silence sorted foliage better than chatter. <words>37</words>
His posture seemed anxiously relaxed, shoulders tight yet breath slow, as though worry and meditation braided bitterness inside his ribcage. <words>57</words>
On the central table lay a mask made from shattered porcelain shards, edges silvered with glue like razor‑brief smiles. <words>76</words>
He had crafted it from teacups dropped by arguing botanists, refusing to sweep away their violence, choosing instead to rearrange it. <words>97</words>
Tonight, during a cosmic blink when galaxies paused between frames, he intended to wear the mask and tilt the universe back to kilter. <words>120</words>
Kilter, to him, meant neither balance nor peace but the audible click of destiny admitting chaos as rightful heir. <words>139</words>
Yet he vowed to reach that thunderous click through the power of nonviolence, letting broken things teach wholeness without fresh fractures. <words>160</words>
He switched off the overhead lamps, allowing only the moonlit lobby to stream through the doorway and spread across the polished marble floor. <words>183</words>
In that gleam, leaf specimens cast ghostlike reflections on the polished marble floor, their chlorophyll memories shimmering like distant nebulae. <words>203</words>
Miran knew the mask would speak to him only through ghostlike reflections on a polished marble floor, never by straightforward sight. <words>224</words>
So he set it upright, porcelain cheeks jagged, and waited until its mirrored silhouette began to quiver like a trapped kestrel. <words>245</words>
The vision unfurled: commuters arguing in subway cars, seeds sprouting through asphalt, meteors brushing satellite hulls, all inside one infinitely compressed instant. <words>267</words>
In that instant—the cosmic blink—order and ruin braided so tightly that neither could be teased apart without unmaking the loom. <words>287</words>
The mask’s porcelain shards turned translucent, revealing avian constellations he had cataloged alone on cliffs, each bird tracing loops of patient rebellion. <words>309</words>
They whispered that wings endure turbulence not by striking air but by shaping it, an argument for nonviolence etched in aerodynamics. <words>330</words>
Miran slipped the mask over his face, shards pressing lightly, and the reflections synchronized, showing him stomping bureaucrats suddenly bowing to unsorted leaves. <words>353</words>
No violence occurred; only roles inverted, like migratory routes reversed, while a hush of awe replaced policy manuals’ rustling. <words>372</words>
He removed the mask, and reality resettled, but a single supervisor approached, declaring the classification system officially off‑kilter until further revelations. <words>393</words>
Miran smiled, feeling the anxiously relaxed ache of someone who has asserted cosmic chaos as a birthright without lifting a fist. <words>414</words>
Around him, leaves fluttered in unexplained drafts, rustling gratitude, while distant galaxies resumed their motion, slightly askew yet undeniably more alive. <words>435</words>
The office lights flickered back on, and Miran quietly logged every species under one new category: Evidence That Gentleness Alters Stars. <words>456</words>
