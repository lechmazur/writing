The rain came thin and metallic over the mossy stones of the ancient Japanese castle. <words>15</words>
Hideki Toranosuke, once a relentless frontier lawman in Hokkaido, had arrived alone and unarmed. <words>29</words>
Retirement, he knew, was supposed to be quiet, but quiet refused to live inside him. <words>44</words>
So he sought corroded rapture in places history forgot to finish cleaning. <words>56</words>
Farmers in the valley below knelt to plant rice seeds, trusting the season more than swords. <words>72</words>
Their rhythm echoed through wet terraces and stirred something brittle inside him. <words>84</words>
He had come to gather broken pieces of himself the way they gathered seedlings into rows. <words>100</words>
On the second evening, a crow dropped a wax-sealed envelope onto his window ledge. <words>114</words>
The address named a shogun dead two centuries, the corridor empty, the delivery probably improbable. <words>129</words>
Yet the name below the salutation was unquestionably his, written in a handwriting he once taught. <words>145</words>
Years ago he had schooled a starving orphan to sign court depositions, then lost her to gunfire. <words>162</words>
The letter, it seemed, had wandered to the wrong address but the right person. <words>176</words>
His vintage spectacles, inherited from an American missionary, trembled in his hand as he unfolded the paper. <words>193</words>
Ink bled into rainspots, yet he read the plea: 'Find me before planting ends, or violence begins anew.' <words>211</words>
The signature was Masa, the orphan grown to womanhood. <words>220</words>
Hideki felt the cycle draw its familiar blade across memory, threatening harvest with revenge. <words>234</words>
He descended spiral stairs where torchlight could not stir the deeper shadows. <words>246</words>
In a ruined antechamber he discovered shattered armor plates, each etched with poems about mercy. <words>261</words>
Gathering broken pieces became literal as he pocketed them, believing Masa had left clues not accusations. <words>277</words>
Outside, frogs croaked counting beats the farmers matched with their hoes, urging him to hurry. <words>292</words>
A hidden courtyard revealed her beneath a torn parasol, eyes bright as rice-field water under moon. <words>308</words>
'I wrote everywhere, hoping chance would guide the letter,' Masa whispered, voice shaking like bamboo. <words>323</words>
Hired killers, she said, stalked her after she broke clan contracts with forgiveness. <words>336</words>
Hideki laid the armor fragments at her feet, each poem a shield forged from ancient regret. <words>352</words>
He slid on his missionary spectacles and recited the verses aloud, their cadence older than gunfire. <words>368</words>
The words stirred the courtyard air like incense, and assassins waiting on the walls lowered their blades. <words>385</words>
Masa stepped forward, pressed rice seeds into the cracked flagstones, and the men knelt instead of killing. <words>402</words>
In that kneeling nothing, Hideki felt the cycle shatter like a lacquer bowl on stone. <words>417</words>
Broken pieces were gathered by hands not swords, and improbable peace stirred within their silence. <words>432</words>
Tomorrow the farmers would wake to new seedlings and rumors of a lawman who finally retired. <words>448</words>
