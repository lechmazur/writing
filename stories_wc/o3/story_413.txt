Long before the first creature even dreamed of sentience, the plains already trembled under an endless corn maze.<words>18</words>
The husks whispered with ironic awe, rustling rumors no mind could yet understand, yet somehow everyone would eventually remember.<words>37</words>
Into this verdant labyrinth wandered Ser Orlon of House Vayne, a listless noble whose pedigree weighed heavier than his boots.<words>57</words>
He wore a faded scarf, once the heraldic standard of his line, now little more than twilight stitched into fabric.<words>77</words>
Despite the primordial era, Orlon maintained a naively sophisticated demeanor, tipping a nonexistent hat to every hollow stalk he passed.<words>97</words>
His motivation, vague yet urgent, was to discover the power of intention before intention itself acquired vocabulary.<words>114</words>
The maze, sensing his quest, bent moonlit corridors into impossible loops, hoping the noble would consent to being lost forever.<words>134</words>
Instead, an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event fluttered from the sky like a disoriented crow and landed at his feet.<words>155</words>
Written on brittle maize leaf, the message read, 'Midnight rendezvous at the maze's heart—bring nothing but questions and humor'.<words>174</words>
Orlon chuckled, a sound nobody had invented yet, feeling the delicious rebellion of laughing before language decreed its shapes.<words>193</words>
Each laughter ripple soaked into the corn, and the rows responded with tassel tassel giggles, creating the first instance of shared laughter.<words>215</words>
Guided by this echoing mirth, he followed glowing kernels that popped open like lanterns, marking a path that never repeated twice.<words>236</words>
At the maze's pulsing center stood three figures carved from wind and gloom, wearing identical faded scarves, their faces unfinished possibilities.<words>257</words>
They bowed in naively sophisticated unison and said—or seemed to say—'We are your intentions before you intend them'.<words>275</words>
Surprised into deeper irony, Orlon offered his own scarf, asking which thread inside it had decided to fade first and why.<words>296</words>
The wind-statues unravelled the cloth, releasing memories of banquet halls, duels at dawn, and yawns he had never suppressed.<words>315</words>
From each memory burst a miniature Orlon, performing choices he might still make, until the air glittered with potential like spilled champagne.<words>337</words>
The noble realized intention was less command than celebration, a joke reality told itself to stay amused in its own darkness.<words>358</words>
He burst out laughing again, and the statues joined, and the corn shook, and the haunted plain felt oddly comforted.<words>378</words>
With every peal of shared laughter the maze shortened, rows folding like gracious hosts, until the horizon appeared for the first time.<words>400</words>
Orlon stepped beyond the final stalk, no longer listless, carrying only echoing laughter as proof of his rendezvous with intention.<words>420</words>
The plain, newly confident, allowed dawn to consider forming, while somewhere far ahead the concept of sentience cleared its throat.<words>440</words>
Yet for now there was just corn, wind, and a fading scarf fluttering like punctuation at the end of cosmic laughter.<words>461</words>
