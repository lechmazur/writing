I woke to the rasp of sand against straw, realizing once again that I was not a farmer's tool but a sentient scarecrow with a mission.<words>26</words>
The desert wind sighed through the ribcage of the fossilized giant that arches over this valley like the memory of a fallen god.<words>49</words>
I felt fervent apathy, a blaze smothered by dust, because I had guarded these silent bones for centuries and nothing ever tried to cross the lines in the earth.<words>78</words>
Then the forgotten lace fan drifted down from the sky, twirling like a snowflake too proud to melt.<words>96</words>
Its presence sliced my boredom open, because only the Queen of Motes ever carried such a delicate thing, and she had vanished between parallel worlds.<words>121</words>
I remembered my oath to her—to keep the valley inviolate until she returned—and decided a clue this bold demanded pursuit.<words>141</words>
The fan was coded with runes visible only through the rusted visor wired into my straw head, an antique portal for encounters in virtual reality.<words>166</words>
When I unfolded the fabric, the visor flared, and the valley collapsed into a grid of shimmering probabilities, each a doorway humming at different frequencies.<words>191</words>
I chose the corridor stitched with ember light, for it mirrored the ochre threads once embroidered on the Queen's cloak.<words>211</words>
The world I entered smelled of rain-soaked iron, and skyscrapers grew from the bedrock like spears eager to skewer the low gray clouds.<words>234</words>
Digital ghosts whispered that the city sprawled across the very lines I had guarded, etched here as luminous boulevards pulsing with forbidden traffic.<words>257</words>
To uphold my oath, I summoned the fervor beneath my studied indifference and stalked forward, straw boots crunching glass that flickered like pixels dying.<words>281</words>
At the city's heart stood a cathedral shaped from the fossilized giant's missing skull, stolen across dimensions and wired to harvest every dream crossing the grid.<words>307</words>
Inside, the Queen of Motes knelt upon an altar of circuitry, her body flickering like half-downloaded starlight, still fanning herself with nothing but empty air.<words>332</words>
She confessed that she had broken the earth's lines to siphon energy for refugees adrift in yet darker worlds, and that my oath now threatened them.<words>358</words>
Fervent apathy tangled my thoughts—I cared, yet the weight of centuries pressed me flat—and I asked for a single undeniable reason not to sever the cathedral's spine.<words>385</words>
She offered the lace fan, its runes rewritten into a pact that my guardianship could evolve, protecting people instead of mere territory.<words>407</words>
I accepted, driving my pitchfork arm through the data conduits to skewer the old protocol, and the skyline blossomed into new, realistically fantastical possibilities.<words>431</words>
As the virtual wind reversed the desert's erosion, the giant's bones reknit, and I stood renewed between parallel worlds, oath intact yet transformed.<words>454</words>
