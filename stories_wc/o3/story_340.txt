The clock in Arborópolis, our rickety treehouse city suspended above the Amazon mist, dared to skip a beat just as I arrived for my latest job. <words>26</words>
Time hiccuped, vines shivered, and I, Isadora Caldeira, proud exorcist and endearingly feisty custodian of cursed secrets, knew mischief had clocked in early. <words>49</words>
My motive was simple: outshine the looming shadow gnawing at this canopy metropolis before it swallowed the dawn. <words>67</words>
The mayor, a panicky capuchin shaman, thrust a wizard’s battered grimoire into my hands as though it were a snake about to molt. <words>90</words>
Its leather was so charred that the title read more like smoke than ink, yet the pages pulsed with adolescent mischief hungry to youthify whatever they touched. <words>117</words>
Unfortunately, that included the shadow, which had recently learned to weaponize puberty. <words>129</words>
Picture a darkness cracking voice, sprouting chaotic possibilities, and refusing bedtime; that's what stalked the upper branches tonight. <words>147</words>
I traced the usual rope bridge toward the central plaza, but it slammed shut like a venomous blossom—the sudden closure of a usual path that made my boots skid splinters. <words>177</words>
With a curse tastier than jungle cacao, I rerouted through a sap-slick ladder, sarcasm my compass. <words>193</words>
Playful cynicism keeps terror from seating itself too comfortably in the skull, and right then I needed every wobble of levity. <words>214</words>
Halfway up, the grimoire’s latch clicked open, spitting a ribbon of teal light that wrapped around me like an overeager boa. <words>235</words>
My knuckles shrank, freckles brightened, and my voice squeaked: the book had youthified me into a teenager at the worst tempo imaginable. <words>257</words>
Responsibility suddenly weighed twice as heavy on half-sized shoulders, an ironic physics lesson about heroism. <words>272</words>
Still, acne or not, a looming shadow hates being upstaged, so I pushed on, limbs buzzing with overdue hormones and duty. <words>293</words>
At the council trunk I found the shadow chewing holes in memory, making elders forget the medicine songs that anchor our houses to the bark. <words>318</words>
It loomed like a thundercloud wearing training wheels, deliriously powerful yet unstable. <words>330</words>
I flipped the grimoire to a page annotated in snide margins by some long-dead wizard who evidently enjoyed sarcastic doodles of skulls. <words>352</words>
The incantation read: 'Age is a stage; yank the curtains when the ego bows.' <words>366</words>
With a crack of vocal cords trying to decide their octave, I shouted the line, directing it at the shadow. <words>386</words>
The teal ribbon darted forward, reversing the shadow’s juvenile surge and returning my own adulthood like a snapped rubber band. <words>406</words>
Before the townsfolk’s eyes, the darkness wrinkled into a harmless puff of dusk, tired and too mature for malice. <words>425</words>
I tucked the grimoire under my arm, its cover now marginally less battered, as though grateful for sensible supervision. <words>444</words>
Arborópolis’ citizens cheered, the clock resumed proper ticking, and I bowed with theatrical pride before stalking off to scold a certain capuchin about loan policies. <words>469</words>
After all, even a playful cynic feels the weight of responsibility, especially when the next shadow already sharpens its teeth in the second between beats. <words>494</words>
