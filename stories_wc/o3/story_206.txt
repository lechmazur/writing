Tarquin Mellifer molded sugar shards into roses beneath the crooked awnings of the forgotten market.<words>15</words>
He was a candy sculptor with a vendetta older than the rebellion itself.<words>28</words>
His meticulously tempered sweetness masked ardent scorn for the generals who razed his hometown to rubble.<words>44</words>
Tarquin’s objective, however, was not mere revenge but discovery of a hidden continent whispered about in sailor songs.<words>62</words>
Legend claimed the map lay encoded inside a forgotten locket once worn by the rebel admiral's daughter.<words>79</words>
To reach it, Tarquin planned a precisely creative counterattack, one that would weaponize candied beauty against military pride.<words>97</words>
He sculpted shimmering birds, filled their hollow centers with seditious pamphlets, and gifted them across the city free of charge.<words>117</words>
The populace tasted rebellion between lemon wings and strawberry beaks, never knowing whose anonymous kindness emboldened their midnight marches.<words>136</words>
Soon patrols swarmed the forgotten market, confiscating sugar and smashing molds, but Tarquin's fury had already crystallized.<words>153</words>
He left behind a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory shared only by the admiral's daughter.<words>171</words>
Each sepia print showed the admiral, younger, kinder, trading sweets with a barefoot boy at seaside dusk.<words>188</words>
The barefoot boy was Tarquin, and the juxtaposition of innocence and tyranny cut sharper than broken sugar glass.<words>206</words>
When the daughter followed the photographs to Tarquin's shuttered stall, she found the locket nestled in crystallized roses.<words>224</words>
Inside, instead of a portrait, spun sugar script revealed coordinates beyond any charted meridian, promising the hidden continent.<words>242</words>
She realized Tarquin sought exploration, not her father's blood, and guilt blossomed hotter than rebellion's torches.<words>258</words>
Together they brokered a clandestine passage through blockaded waters, bartering candy birds for fuel and silence.<words>274</words>
Rumor of their escape enraged the generals, who launched ironclad gunboats in ruthless counterattack.<words>288</words>
Tarquin answered with fireworks of molten sugar, blinding searchlights and coating decks in adhesive caramel that seized gears.<words>306</words>
The rebellion cheered from jagged rooftops as the ironclads drifted helpless, their cannons gummed shut by sweetness.<words>323</words>
Yet Tarquin’s heart, still pulsing with ardent scorn, softened when the daughter clasped his wrist in quiet gratitude.<words>341</words>
Her anonymous kindness decades prior, offering him candy after soldiers burned his village, had unknowingly saved his will to dream.<words>361</words>
Remembering, Tarquin redirected his vendetta toward horizons instead of throats, vowing that discovery, not destruction, would honor that sacred sweetness.<words>381</words>
As dawn ignited the sea, their patched schooner slipped past smoking hulks, following the locket's coordinates toward mists where gulls circled like impatient cartographers.<words>405</words>
Behind them the forgotten market stirred, vendors sweeping glass and sugar into piles that glittered like tiny revolutions under morning light.<words>426</words>
People whispered that the candy sculptor had sailed to paint continents with sweetness, proving that even ardent scorn could ferment into wonder.<words>448</words>
