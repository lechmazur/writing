Across the hush of memory’s corridors, the pragmatic soothsayer Viellin returned to her birthplace.<words>14</words>
The gnarled forest village perched in twisted branches still breathed, though storms had gnawed at its roots.<words>31</words>
She walked beneath woven footbridges that creaked like contrite spirits, feeling dreadful hope press against her ribs.<words>48</words>
Viellin wore a lavishly humble cloak of moss-thread and ember silks, refusing both tatters and royalty.<words>64</words>
She sought the abandoned smithy, shattered in war, where her father once swung a blacksmith’s hammer.<words>80</words>
In that iron graveyard she intended to manufacture the last of her manufactured miracles.<words>94</words>
The miracle’s purpose was simple: to become a force of nature that no monarch could leash.<words>110</words>
Yet simplicity kills unless tempered, and Viellin was nothing if not tempered.<words>122</words>
She laid shards of anvils in a ring, each splinter humming with failures of earlier ages.<words>138</words>
Then she dragged breath through cracked lips and spoke by the echo of a long-forgotten song.<words>154</words>
The melody was older than bark yet younger than despair, a scale she had mapped upon her spine.<words>172</words>
Air thickened, nails whirled, and the blacksmith’s hammer rose from ash like a starling of iron.<words>188</words>
It hovered before her, waiting for the decree only a pragmatic soothsayer would dare utter.<words>203</words>
Viellin named the winds, the rivers, and the quaking hearts of men as its destined hosts.<words>219</words>
At each name, the hammer chimed, forging unseen alloys inside the air’s trembling lattice.<words>233</words>
Outside, villagers gathered, drawn by rumors that miracles were being built rather than begged.<words>247</words>
They remembered Viellin as the child who predicted frost yet planted fig seeds so none starved.<words>263</words>
Their trust, brittle and glowing, seeped through the smithy’s broken walls like winter sun through glass.<words>279</words>
Trust was the final alloy, and it braided with iron until the hammer pulsed, no longer a tool.<words>297</words>
Lightning entered the room without thunder, smelling of salt marsh and newborn leaves.<words>310</words>
The hammer struck itself against nothing, and every cracked beam healed, sprouting fresh bark.<words>324</words>
Huts lifted, merging with living trunks, turning the village into a cathedral of rooted constellations.<words>339</words>
Still, Viellin’s dreadful hope cautioned her: miracles manufactured are debts, and nature collects interest.<words>353</words>
She knelt and whispered that she would pay by guiding the storm instead of resisting it.<words>369</words>
The hammer answered, embedding itself in her sternum, branding her with veins of molten ore.<words>384</words>
Power coursed, lavishly humble in its honesty, monstrous in its breadth, and utterly hers.<words>398</words>
She stepped outside, and storms bowed like apprentices awaiting instruction.<words>408</words>
With a raised palm she guided rain to cracked wells, wind to empty sails, fire to silent hearths.<words>426</words>
The villagers exhaled, unsure whether to kneel or flee, caught between gratitude and primordial terror.<words>441</words>
Viellin smiled, feeling the horizon bend within her chest, and promised to be storm, shelter, and story.<words>458</words>
