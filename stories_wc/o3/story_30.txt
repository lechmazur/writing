The navigation room of the star-galleon Kraken’s Debt pulsed with holographic starlines and the smell of ionized metal. <words>18</words>
At its cluttered chart table sat Rix Calder, high‑stakes gambler whose telekinetic dice hovered like obedient moons above his knuckles. <words>38</words>
Around him, amid whispered secrets, other pirates murmured star-routes and mutinous wagers while the reactor lights flickered in uneasy reverence. <words>58</words>
Rix unrolled a palm-sized fragment of a medieval tapestry stitched with coiling dragons, its threads sparking faintly like dying constellations. <words>78</words>
Hidden in the weft were glyphs of lost languages that described sustainable soil enchantments from vanished valley kingdoms. <words>96</words>
Rix’s motivation, strange for a pirate, was to preserve farming methods before corporate terraforming scorched the outer colonies barren. <words>115</words>
He claimed to be philosophically practical: grow food first, gamble later, survive longest. <words>128</words>
He let a stolen wax match flame, sealing the tapestry edges against fray while casting red halos over his calculating eyes. <words>149</words>
Each symbol he studied reminded him of the family tradition of planting a tree for each new member back on Dustroot. <words>170</words>
The orchard there, watered by improbable hope, now sprouted alone under blockade, and he vowed those saplings would not be orphaned. <words>191</words>
But Captain Vorga demanded the tapestry as payment for Rix’s debts, intending to auction its dragons to antiquarians on Mercury. <words>211</words>
Ahead, the ship dropped from warp beside a silent moon, hull groaning like a cathedral flirting with collapse, embracing sacred disorder. <words>232</words>
In that hush, Rix rolled his telekinetic dice, their ivory pips orbiting midair, spelling coordinates only he could interpret. <words>251</words>
The numbers pointed to an uncharted green world where tapestry glyphs promised fertile volcanic loam and rain disciplined by ancient runes. <words>272</words>
Rix proposed a gamble to Vorga: reach that planet, he’d clear his debts and yield the tapestry, or lose everything on snake‑eyes. <words>294</words>
The captain, greedy and superstitious, accepted, the bridge crew leaning in like parishioners awaiting a dubious miracle. <words>311</words>
With a subtle twitch of thought, Rix made the dice tumble; they settled midair showing twin draconic sixes, impossible by normal physics. <words>333</words>
The crew exhaled as thrusters fired, and the Kraken’s Debt banked toward the emerald coordinates, dice still glowing like embers of destiny. <words>355</words>
Upon arrival, vast forests unfurled below, and Rix felt the old Dustroot soil under phantom fingernails, urging him to plant the future. <words>377</words>
He pledged the first sapling to the pirates who would become farmers, letting sacred disorder root itself in ordered rows across a new horizon. <words>401</words>
