Dim mosslight seeped through the polypore windows of the giant mushroom house, painting spores in drifting halos. <words>17</words>
Here, Vorgo the edgy tradesman hunched over his dented toolbox, muttering price lists to shadows. <words>32</words>
A comfortingly pessimistic grin tugged his scarred cheek whenever he remembered what he kept forgetting. <words>47</words>
Memory, to Vorgo, was a warped ledger whose ink bled farther each time he opened it. <words>63</words>
Tonight, during the final rotation of a forgotten windmill beyond the bog, the ledger would settle accounts. <words>80</words>
He unfolded the torn corner of a flyer he had traded for three rusted nails and half a secret. <words>99</words>
On its mildew-specked surface writhed a map so faint it looked like bruised skin over parchment. <words>115</words>
He needed to vectorize that spectral ink, convert cloudy curves into coordinates he could sell or escape by. <words>133</words>
So he tapped two synchronized watches strapped to his wrists, each ticking a different remembered future. <words>149</words>
When their hands aligned, the house groaned, and spores drew lines of light between ceiling and floor. <words>166</words>
Those lines etched themselves onto the torn flyer, turning smudged symbols into crisp vectors of destination. <words>182</words>
Yet with every clarified angle, a part of Vorgo's past dissolved like sugar in acid rain. <words>198</words>
Faces of barter partners blurred, and deals once shouted across markets shrank to echoes behind the groaning windmill. <words>216</words>
He felt the distortion of memory like a draft sneaking under a locked door, equal parts mercy and theft. <words>235</words>
Still, the motivation that anchored him was simple: to carry a flickering candle through an endless void. <words>252</words>
Somewhere beyond the mapped coordinates, the void waited, hushing all trades except the barter of breath for hope. <words>270</words>
Vorgo, comfortingly pessimistic, assumed the candle would die, but he vowed to reach the dark before it did. <words>288</words>
The synchronized watches chimed a final note, resonating with the last creak of the unseen windmill outside. <words>305</words>
Floorboards unfurled into a narrow corridor of spores, a hallway that shouldn't fit inside any fungus-grown dwelling. <words>322</words>
Vorgo lit the candle, its flame stuttering like a drunk remembering vows, and stepped into the corridor. <words>339</words>
Behind him, the mushroom interior curled shut, sealing off the comfort of pessimism he had cultivated. <words>355</words>
Ahead, the passage stretched in blurry vividness, details sharp at the edges yet smeared at the center like tears. <words>374</words>
Every step vectorized a new slice of forgotten life, trading certainty for distance, until only the candle and void remained. <words>394</words>
When the flame finally guttered, Vorgo smiled, certain the darkness would remember him more clearly. <words>409</words>
