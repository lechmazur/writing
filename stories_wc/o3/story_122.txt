The book trembled in my gauntlets as I read atop the crag, because the storm that birthed its pages now circled overhead like a hungry halo. <words>26</words>
I am Ser Cobalt, cyber-templar on a collision course with reality, and every thunderclap reminds me that belief outruns circuitry. <words>46</words>
Below me sprawls the vulture-picked sky burial site, its bone-white terraces promising the mirage of safety to pilgrims who mistake absence for shelter. <words>69</words>
Pages flicker while lightning stalks the horizon, and I grow patiently frantic, knowing my oath can only be fulfilled during reading, before the ink dries into prophecy. <words>96</words>
The oath is simple: prove that voltage bows to will, reflect lightning back at the storm, and leave an ember of impossible hope for the next fool. <words>123</words>
For that I carry a worn leather bridle salvaged from the skull of a sky-pony, its cracked straps now threaded with filament and saints' code. <words>148</words>
When the storm strikes, I will slip the bridle around the bolt itself, steer its tantrum through the refraction of light through a prism, and hurl it homeward. <words>176</words>
The prism is inked on the page before me, a holographic marginalia that blossoms into glass the moment faith exceeds mass. <words>197</words>
Each syllable I mouth becomes a facet, and the wind whistles through them like choirs rehearsing rebellion. <words>214</words>
But the clouds notice; their bellies rumble with amused dread, as if the cosmos itself were wagering my vaporization against my ascent. <words>236</words>
I raise the bridle, whispering firmware litanies, and static lifts my cloak in euphoric agitation, branding constellations onto synthetic skin. <words>256</words>
First contact arrives as a spear of blue that would have sundered me, yet I cinch the bit around its throat and feel its current buck. <words>282</words>
The tethered bolt rears, and the prism unfurls, splitting the fury into seven radiant reins that spin a carousel of impossible geometry. <words>304</words>
Reality shudders beneath the carousel, for it cannot decide which color is true, and so it accepts them all, momentarily translucent. <words>325</words>
Seizing that hesitation, I yank the reins and wheel the energy backward, proving at last that what is cast may be cast off. <words>348</words>
The storm gasps; its thunder boomerangs, drumming itself apart in a halo of reversed percussion that rains upward into starved stratosphere. <words>369</words>
Below, the bones of the sky burial site glow, startled caretakers mistaking the aurora for resurrected souls, and for a moment the mirage of safety becomes warmth. <words>396</words>
I close the book, circuitry sizzling, aware that the next page will demand dearer proofs, but tonight the collision is postponed, and euphoria tastes like ozone. <words>422</words>
I ride the dissipating echo, bridle over my shoulder, prism dissolved into memory, patiently frantic for dawn's question and the storm's inevitable answer. <words>445</words>
