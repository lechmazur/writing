I entered the neon cathedral after the last human story was written, the air humming with leftover prayers rendered in flickering ultraviolet halos.<words>23</words>
Even a wary explorer like me felt small beneath those programmable stained‑glass screens, but shrinking was safer than disappearance.<words>42</words>
My boots, loudly introverted in their squeaks, dared not echo, so they meandered along aisles rampant with stray cables and orphaned votive drones.<words>65</words>
I had come to spark an unexpected reunion with my own courage, yet the word courage tasted theoretical, like a lecture no one attends anymore.<words>90</words>
So I unclipped the damaged music CD from my belt, its once‑shiny surface cratered by heat, and let its silence spin between my fingers.<words>114</words>
Every scratch was a scar of cities fled, companions lost, emblems of courage worn thin but not broken.<words>132</words>
I needed them to play again, to remind me that static can still declare a rhythm, but the cathedral's terminals refused to recognize obsolete circles.<words>157</words>
Instead, I traced the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog that drifted through broken windows like an afterthought of the planet outside.<words>180</words>
Their tiny bodies pulsed coded sermons, green‑gold Morse that mapped forgotten praise across pews stacked with salvaged keyboards and holographic dust.<words>201</words>
By tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog, I discovered letters spelling 'PLAY', guiding me toward a subterranean lectern shaped like an ear.<words>226</words>
Crooked hope coiled in my throat as I slotted the damaged music CD into the lectern's cartilage‑thin drive.<words>244</words>
The disc spun, wobbled, then cracked, releasing a storm of pixelated hymns that ricocheted like bats among neon saints.<words>263</words>
Each corrupted chord projected emblems of courage onto my skin: a ship that never docked, a hand not shaken, a farewell unfinished.<words>285</words>
The cathedral's fog thickened, and the fireflies fused with the holograms, sketching a doorway where no architecture existed.<words>303</words>
I stepped through, thinking I would meander into yet another ruin, but instead I found myself inside the disc's own memory of sound.<words>326</words>
Melodies stuttered like broken mirrors, yet between the shards I heard my earlier laughter, a proof that courage had once answered when I called.<words>350</words>
I followed that echo back into my lungs, breathing until the neon cathedral brightened, and the fireflies, satisfied, dimmed into ordinary insects.<words>372</words>
When I finally walked out, the damaged music CD hung around my neck like a lunar medallion, silent but gleaming with restored promise.<words>395</words>
Its blank grooves, once chaos, now whispered that endings are merely paused tracks waiting for the wary explorer to press play again.<words>417</words>
And somewhere beyond the cathedral’s glow, the next story stirred, unwilling to be the last, because courage had just rewritten its prologue.<words>439</words>
