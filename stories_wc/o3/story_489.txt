At the instant a dancer’s foot first touches the stage, the haunted lighthouse watch room groans like an awakened beast.<words>20</words>
No audience hears the sound except me, the unseen observer stationed behind a salt-crusted porthole.<words>35</words>
I breathe brazen calm, an aggressively kind resolve simmering beneath my stillness.<words>47</words>
Tonight my mission is to rescue ancient traditions before the ocean swallows their last whispered syllable.<words>63</words>
The lighthouse once stood as a ceremonial drum, guiding fishermen who sang in forgotten modes to lull the tides.<words>82</words>
Those songs, born of the undercurrent of wisdom, now survive only as barnacle-muffled echoes.<words>96</words>
I clutch a basic plastic whistle, cheap as carnival prizes yet tuned to memory rather than pitch.<words>113</words>
Elders entrusted it to me with instructions carved in wind: 'Fling it when the whale calls.'<words>129</words>
For nights I waited, counting phantom footsteps spiraling the iron staircase behind me.<words>142</words>
Tonight, the dancer below, unaware of this storm-wrapped tower, marks my signal moment.<words>155</words>
Her choreography revives a coastal rite once performed to beckon leviathans toward safe harbor.<words>169</words>
When her sole brushes the oak boards, the ocean answers.<words>179</words>
A subterranean bellow surges through fog, stirred by the call of a whale from the deep.<words>195</words>
Windows rattle; lantern flames lengthen into ghosts.<words>202</words>
My cue arrives crystal and enormous, vibrating inside bone rather than ear.<words>214</words>
I fling the whistle through the cracked window, letting it spin like a silver seed toward the moonlit sea.<words>233</words>
Air howls around the plastic as if upgrading its worth, carrying it precisely onto the whale‑brightened swells.<words>250</words>
The whistle lands, floats, and suddenly splits into prisms of song, each shard a syllable the elders feared lost.<words>269</words>
Downstage, the dancer pivots, sensing music where none should exist, her eyes flooding with seawall memories.<words>285</words>
She folds the new melody into her routine, feet hammering rhythms older than script, younger than sunrise.<words>302</words>
Below my perch, villagers who wandered toward the theater feel their hearts hitch to forgotten cadences, weeping without shame.<words>321</words>
In the watch room, spectral keepers nod, chains unclinking as the lighthouse sheds its curse like shed skin.<words>339</words>
They had guarded the undercurrent of wisdom for centuries, waiting for one aggressively kind enough to break protocol.<words>357</words>
I remain unseen, yet I feel their gratitude radiate through foghorn timbres and rust‑sweet air.<words>372</words>
The whale’s call subsides, replaced by layered chants spiraling from sea to stage to sky.<words>387</words>
Tradition breathes again, not archived but alive, saliva on tongues and salt on skin.<words>401</words>
