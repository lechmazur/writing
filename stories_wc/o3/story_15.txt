Between breakfast's fading warmth and the uncertain promise of supper, the gracious widow Alina strolled alone.<words>16</words>
She wandered the ruined orchard district, a maze of skeletal apple trees and collapsed stone presses submerged in centuries of thick fog.<words>38</words>
The fog tasted like bruised fruit and old promises, but Alina inhaled it as if it were clean morning air.<words>58</words>
Hope tethered her steps the way invisible strings guide a child’s kite against contrary winds.<words>73</words>
Ever since the gods sank her village for daring to harvest moonlit apples, she had resolved to walk above their drowning.<words>94</words>
She would defy them not with swords or sermons but with nurture, coaxing life from the orchard’s husks.<words>112</words>
Yet seeds and soil alone were insufficient, so she visited the abandoned blacksmith’s forge crouched beside the cracked irrigation canal.<words>132</words>
Inside, rusted tongs and curled horseshoes formed solemnly absurd sculptures that chimed whenever the wind worried through broken shutters.<words>151</words>
Alina repurposed the chiming scrap into root cradles, reasoning that melody might lure sap upward the way dawn lures sleepers.<words>171</words>
What she lacked was guidance, and that arrived through mysterious postcards slipped beneath her door between meals.<words>188</words>
Each card bore damp ink drawings of orchards neither wholly alive nor wholly dead, along with a single command in silver script.<words>210</words>
Follow the breath of stones, they said, as if stones could sigh secrets.<words>223</words>
Obedient in her rebellion, Alina laid her ear to the forge’s anvil and heard faint subterranean heartbeats.<words>240</words>
She hammered the anvil’s echo into thin resonant plates, planting them around saplings like shields against divine thunder.<words>258</words>
Days slipped past like wet leaves, measured only by the widow’s midday broth and her evening crusts.<words>275</words>
Between those sparse meals, she wrote replies on the postcards’ blank backs, thanking the unknown mentor and asking for tougher riddles.<words>296</words>
The next delivery instructed her to weave fog itself into grafting tape by whispering lullabies in forgotten dialects.<words>314</words>
She obeyed, and pale ribbons condensed around her fingers, remarkably solid yet trembling like newborn fawns.<words>330</words>
With ribbons, plates, and melodic cradles, the orchard began to pulse with secret sap, green flickers beneath bark ash.<words>349</words>
Storm clouds gathered, delivering the gods’ verdict as spear-thick rain accompanied by booming accusations.<words>363</words>
Alina stood among her saplings, tethered by hope yet loose of fear, her face lifted in serious playfulness.<words>381</words>
When lightning struck, the resonant plates sang, the root cradles rang, and the fog-woven tapes fluttered like defiant banners.<words>400</words>
The storm recoiled, confused by harmony where ruin was ordained, and the orchard’s saplings stretched taller in the hush.<words>419</words>
Drizzle softened into mist, then merged with the abiding fog, accepting conscription into Alina’s absurd militia of life.<words>437</words>
At twilight, a final postcard appeared, its silver script reading only, 'Well played—now teach the gods to grow'.<words>455</words>
Alina smiled, pocketed the card, and stepped deeper into the fog, already plotting her next impossible lesson.<words>472</words>
