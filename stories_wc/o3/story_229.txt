Moonlight dripped across the sailing ship graveyard like quicksilver, outlining shattered masts in spectral halos. <words>15</words>
Here wandered Elowen Briar, a mildly curious inventor whose questions outnumbered the barnacles. <words>28</words>
She had come carrying a pearl-encrusted ring box no larger than a gull's heart. <words>42</words>
Inside glimmered cogs and threads of memory she meant to wind back into being. <words>56</words>
Her friend Lysander waited among toppled figureheads, whispering a secret that vibrated the salted air. <words>71</words>
"If you listen when the clouds break, the hulls will resonate," he murmured, voice trembling with tide. <words>88</words>
That moment of shared breath, that whispered confession, was the hinge on which their impossible promise turned. <words>105</words>
Years earlier, Lysander's brother had gone down with the flagship Infinity and never surfaced. <words>119</words>
Lysander vowed to resurrect not the body but the story, and Elowen believed mechanisms could oblige. <words>135</words>
Yet oceans erase ink, and time forgets timbers, so they sought a philosophically absurd technique. <words>150</words>
They would reconstruct the past by following rain patterns, mapping droplets that remembered deck-boards. <words>164</words>
Storm after storm, they charted where fresh water struck salt-bleached oak and sang its wet syllables. <words>180</words>
Tonight the charts converged, pointing to this moon-ruined cove as if the sky kept appointments. <words>195</words>
Elowen knelt on an upturned hull, opened the ring box, and wound the miniature crank. <words>210</words>
Pearls glittered like condensed constellations, and a faint hum spread outward, touching keel, rib, and reef. <words>226</words>
The graveyard answered with creaks that resembled violins tuning at the edge of oblivion. <words>240</words>
Planks shifted; water sloshed syllables; half-buried compasses spun until north forgot itself. <words>252</words>
Rain began, sparse as pepper, following the trajectories their diagrams had prophesied. <words>264</words>
Each drop struck wood and glowed, momentarily sketching silhouettes of sailors hauling ghostly ropes. <words>278</words>
Past and present cohabited, overlapping like transparencies in a lantern show for the cosmos. <words>292</words>
Lysander watched, tears mixing with rainfall, as his brother's outline saluted from the phantom deck. <words>307</words>
He whispered again, softer: "You kept the promise the sea called impossible." <words>319</words>
Elowen answered with silence, feeling the universe lean nearer, intimate and immeasurably vast. <words>332</words>
The ring box clicked shut, and the spectral fleet steadied, history rerecorded in resonant timber. <words>347</words>
Wind carried the rain elsewhere, erasing luminous silhouettes so gently it resembled a benediction. <words>361</words>
Still, the cove kept a tremor, like a heartbeat beneath wreckage, affirming their nocturnal engineering. <words>376</words>
Lysander and Elowen departed before dawn, trusting the rain to remember directions if futures unraveled. <words>391</words>
Behind them, waves folded the moment away, but promise and past remained, eternally intertwined and gently resonating. <words>408</words>
