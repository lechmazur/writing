Such theatrics amused my innocent cynicism, a defense against visions that never fully belonged to me.<words>45</words>
I am the nondescript seer nobody notices until the verdict arrives late and heavy.<words>59</words>

Years ago, the fragrance of a forged manifesto saved a township, but cost me a lover.<words>144</words>

The scent indicated four encryption layers, each tied to a memory of rain.<words>263</words>
First layer: childhood drizzle, simple salt and sidewalk chalk.<words>272</words>
