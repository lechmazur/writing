Neon rain drummed against the skylight of the hypermall as Ithar Vale, aloof cartographer of forgotten oceans, drifted through holographic aisles.<words>21</words>
His official survey had ended hours ago, yet an eager resignation fluttered in his chest, begging him to stay.<words>40</words>
He sought, tonight, to learn the language of the soul, a dialect maps never dared to chart.<words>57</words>
At the mall's pulsating nexus, where two levitating corridors crossed, architectural signage proclaimed the hour: the crossroads where two destinies exchange places.<words>79</words>
There Ithar noticed a display floor mosaic, one ceramic tile cracked amid perfect circuitry, its fracture inconspicuously blatant like a whispered scream.<words>101</words>
Instinct suggested forgotten fault data, but the cartographer's deeper sensors registered ties of memory radiating from the break.<words>119</words>
When he knelt, a mirrored panel unfolded, projecting a river at dawn where kayaks skimmed silver water beneath real birds.<words>139</words>
A second figure glided beside him, her badge identifying her as Mall Renewal Engineer Lyre Anouk, and her eyes held the same reflected river.<words>163</words>
They had met once, years ahead in a timeline not yet built, united by a shared love for kayaking along the ices of Europa.<words>187</words>
Now destiny recoiled, offering them a chance to expand that fleeting camaraderie into something cartographic and visceral.<words>204</words>
Lyre touched the cracked tile, and memories streamed: her childhood fear of drowning, his compass tattoo, their laughter echoing across black water.<words>226</words>
The hypermall faded until only riverlight remained, looping around them like a quiet palindrome.<words>240</words>
Ithar realized the map he longed to draw was not of space, but of converging pasts speaking through broken surfaces.<words>260</words>
Yet his aloofness clung to him, armor against the tidal intimacy washing over cracked enamel and skin alike.<words>278</words>
Lyre, sensing retreat, lifted a miniature holo-paddle, its shaft etched with glyphs meaning listen before you measure.<words>295</words>
Teach me your symbols, she said, and I will teach you my silences.<words>308</words>
The proposition felt inconspicuously blatant, as though the universe itself had posted a neon sign disguised as mist.<words>326</words>
With a breath that smelled of recycled citrus, Ithar set his stylus upon the air and traced her offer into coordinates.<words>347</words>
Lines blossomed, intersecting the river hologram, translating kayak wakes into phonemes, sorrow into longitudes, hope into gentle latitudes.<words>365</words>
Lyre answered by sliding two tiles together, sealing the crack, and the mall's arteries thundered with newborn current.<words>383</words>
In that thunder, their destinies exchanged places; he felt suddenly present, she became the wanderer mapping tomorrow.<words>400</words>
The skylight cleared, revealing stars arranged like patient letters, spelling the first sentence of the soul they had begun to decipher.<words>421</words>
Together they stepped onto the glowing raft of aisle-light, paddles raised, ready to chart what only memory remembers.<words>439</words>
