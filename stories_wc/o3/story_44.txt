I first met Lyra, the feisty stablehand with an intellectually playful grin, during a bumper-to-bumper twilight car ride. <words>18</words>
Horses were scarce in low-orbit colonies, yet she kept imaginary ones trotting through her anecdotes, reins flicking in the air vents. <words>39</words>
Between honking shuttles, she whispered that abandoned satellites could be tamed like colts and turned into a space debris art studio. <words>60</words>
Her dream, she claimed, was to preserve ancient methods of craftsmanship by welding yesterday's orbiting trash into tomorrow's cosmic frescos. <words>80</words>
I was only the cab driver, but her quietly bold vision lodged inside my dashboard reflections like static sparks. <words>99</words>
The next ride, she lugged an antique oil lamp swaddled in bubble wrap, insisting it held the blueprint of redemption. <words>119</words>
She flicked its wick, and a hologram of galloping constellations leapt up, morphing silhouettes with every pothole the hovercar kissed. <words>139</words>
Each shape, she said, represented a wrong she hoped to right through redemptive acts of artful salvage. <words>156</words>
But the lamp would only guide her if fed half-torn tickets from a forgotten carnival booth rumored to orbit near the scrapyard belt. <words>179</words>
That revelation tickled her intellect; puzzles, she chirped, were sugar cubes for the mind's horse. <words>194</words>
So we detoured, our car rides stretching into comet-lit marathons while she scoured pawnships for the elusive carnival stubs. <words>213</words>
Days blurred through windshield nebulae before she found a crumpled roll of pink, numbers wiped away by vacuum frost. <words>232</words>
She tore the roll, fed the lamp, and watched flame morph into a compass arrow pointing toward Graveyard Station Twelve. <words>252</words>
I parked beside the drifting hulk, and inside we found galleries of shattered solar panels waiting like blank canvases. <words>271</words>
Lyra's tools were simple--leather reins repurposed as wire, hoof picks dulled into chisels--but her intent glowed fierce. <words>288</words>
She welded hull shards into sweeping equine arcs, each spark a quietly bold promise that broken things could gallop again. <words>308</words>
When the sculpture finished, the lamp dimmed, and the studio lights from distant cities reflected off its chrome mane like dawn. <words>329</words>
She pressed the last ticket into my palm, telling me every act of care is admission to the next miracle. <words>349</words>
As I drove her back through meteor showers, the sculpture transmitted hoofbeat vibrations along the chassis, steadying traffic like a lullaby. <words>370</words>
Somewhere between toll satellites, I realized that amid endless car rides I, too, was morphing toward redemption, preserving ancient methods of hope. <words>392</words>
Lyra just winked, her playful intellect already planning the next orbiting rescue in secret. <words>406</words>
