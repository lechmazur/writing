I arrived at the nanobotanical garden just after the last human law was broken, carrying my ledger of regrets and the glimmer of an almost sincere smile.<words>27</words>
Being the city's only licensed professional apologizer, I felt obliged to compose a public contrition for the lawless dawn, even though no statute remained to enforce honesty.<words>54</words>
The air was fragrant with engineered lilac drones, yet it hummed with echoes of authenticity, the phenomenon I had been hunting like a tired zoologist chasing an extinct bird.<words>83</words>
My motivation, quietly taped inside my coat, was a weathered map where I intended to plot seasonal changes that no longer obeyed calendars, only moods.<words>108</words>
To gather data I had to unlock city folklore on bar napkins, each inked anecdote describing storms that sang or summers that refused to blush, and I paid with apologies instead of coins.<words>141</words>
Tonight's napkin story spoke of a shattered record whose music could restart the planet's conscience, so I followed the rumor through midnight passages of ivy made from self-wiring silver filaments.<words>171</words>
I found only a single piece of a broken vinyl record glittering beneath a carnivorous orchid that whispered licensed melodies every time a drone-brushed breeze passed its serrated petals.<words>200</words>
The fragment sang backwards, syllables warped, and I had to nuance my apology to the orchid, to the record, and to myself until the hiss aligned into a coherent confession.<words>230</words>
Only then did the wildly reserved curator appear, her lab coat buttoned like armor but her eyes glowing with sleepless delight, the very embodiment of elated fatigue.<words>257</words>
She accepted my refined remorse as payment and inserted the vinyl shard into a slot at the heart of the garden, where billions of pollen-sized robots waited like expectant seeds.<words>287</words>
A tremor rippled outward, repainting leaves with autumn, then winter, then spring, spinning the seasons in seconds so that my blank map began to glow with impossible gradients.<words>315</words>
We laughed, exhausted, because the data was perfect and useless at once: no law compelled nature anymore, but nature still adored a well-crafted apology.<words>339</words>
In that rolling kaleidoscope of weather, I felt every prior apology I'd delivered echo back through me, stripped of performance, resonating with a sudden authenticity I could neither bill nor deny.<words>370</words>
The curator pressed a blank napkin into my trembling hand and told me to write the new folklore myself, mapping each microseason as it bloomed and died within the span of a breath.<words>403</words>
So I sat on a bench of living lichen, inked in future myths between yawns, and listened as the garden repeated my words aloud, already preparing its next apology to the wind.<words>435</words>
