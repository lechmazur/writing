When the band finally stopped playing at the corner bar, Clarence switched frequencies.<words>13</words>
The stoic pirate radio operator treasured Silence as his most scandalous broadcast.<words>25</words>
Tonight, however, a crumpled wallet lay beside the mixing console, fluttering with accusation.<words>38</words>
Clarence had found it under a barstool during the saxophone solo no one heard.<words>52</words>
Obligation, that unwelcome melody, compelled him across town to the address on the license.<words>66</words>
The address led through dew‑silvered orchards to a beekeeper's sanctuary humming with devotion.<words>79</words>
Hives rose like gilded speakers, and each bee droned a bassline of survival.<words>92</words>
There, amid honeyed dusk, he met Aurelia, the sanctuary's ironically earnest caretaker.<words>104</words>
She thanked him for the wallet with a nod that felt like a manifesto.<words>118</words>
Clarence, trained to mask emotion behind deadpan static, felt a surprising gasp escape.<words>131</words>
Aurelia pretended not to notice, exhibiting pompous humility practiced among those who speak for bees.<words>146</words>
She unfolded a small table, poured tea the colour of sunlight, and demanded his story.<words>161</words>
Words, usually obedient to Clarence, now swarmed like her hives, stinging with untamed sincerity.<words>175</words>
He confessed broadcasting secret sea‑ballads, pirated from ships too lonely to dock.<words>187</words>
Each transmission sought, he admitted, to navigate uncharted emotional depths he could not name.<words>201</words>
Aurelia listened, her veil catching twilight, as though tuned to frequencies beyond human sorrow.<words>215</words>
From her pocket she produced a folded paper plane inked with geometric honeycomb patterns.<words>229</words>
She said the plane carried a question only someone broadcasting silence could answer.<words>242</words>
Clarence launched it across the apiary; bees parted, respecting its fragile aerodynamics.<words>254</words>
The plane landed on a hive roof, unfolding mid‑air to reveal coordinates scribbled in pollen.<words>269</words>
Those numbers aligned with an empty frequency gap, a silent longitude known to few.<words>283</words>
Aurelia proposed a collaboration: his transmitter, her bees, and sincerity that refused domestication.<words>296</words>
Together they would broadcast humming hymns, mapping hearts the way bees map orchards.<words>309</words>
Clarence, startled by the grandeur of the humble, bowed with theatrical restraint.<words>321</words>
His voice, once iceberg cool, now vibrated like glassware before a train, yet remained measured.<words>336</words>
He accepted, promising to let sincerity roar, even if cloaked in aristocratic detachment.<words>349</words>
Their pact sealed, the bees crescendoed, sounding like cymbals announcing an empire of feeling.<words>363</words>
When Clarence walked back toward town, Aurelia at his side, the hives still rang behind.<words>378</words>
Inside the silent bar, the band packed up; yet across radio waves, new music brewed.<words>393</words>
Listeners far offshore would soon gasp, tasting honey between the notes of a wordless confession.<words>408</words>
