The museum floated above a seamless ocean of mist, casting a dull radiance upon the clouded dusk.<words>17</words>
Inside, I, curator of jungles suspended in glass domes, catalogued vines that hummed like captive rainstorms.<words>33</words>
Yet each catalog entry felt hollow, for guilt roared louder than the artificial thunder I programmed.<words>49</words>
I had harvested real seedlings from a forbidden delta, stripping a living rainforest to garnish my exhibit.<words>66</words>
To hush that roaring memory, I resolved to repopulate the ravaged ground with seeds bred in skybound captivity.<words>84</words>
But the council of trustees dismissed restoration as fiscally illogical, though their logic was, to me, logically illogical.<words>102</words>
I stole the archive drone, stuffed it with germinated pods, and escaped during a maintenance blackout.<words>118</words>
An unforeseen meteor shower shredded the drone's ion sails, forcing an unexpected road trip across the lower tropospheric trade lanes.<words>138</words>
I docked at a reimagined ancient Mesopotamian temple perched on storm pillars, its ziggurat terraces transformed into landing platforms.<words>157</words>
Pilgrims wandered the echoing halls, seeking the touch of wonder promised by holographic cuneiform that glimmered like wet clay.<words>176</words>
Among them stood a shrine to tomorrow, silent as an overture yet to breathe its first chord.<words>193</words>
There, preserved at absolute zero, waited a transparent violin made of ice crystal, rumored to play only futures.<words>211</words>
Temple caretakers believed the instrument thawed each dawn, releasing melodies that rewrote fates before refreezing.<words>226</words>
I bargained my drone for a single nocturne on the violin, intent on coaxing a blueprint for renewal.<words>244</words>
When my bow touched the cold strings, sound blossomed not as notes but as vines of pale light.<words>262</words>
The luminous creepers unfurled through the sanctuary, dangling seeds that pulsed with memories of monsoon soil.<words>278</words>
Pilgrims gasped, their awe blanketing my guilt, yet the roar within only quieted, never vanished.<words>293</words>
I gathered the glowing seeds, knowing dawn would refreeze the violin and lock away its mercy.<words>309</words>
My journey back to the wounded delta wound through hurricane alleys, every mile a hymn of hesitant hope.<words>327</words>
When I landed, the rainforest lay like a peeled scar, silent where howler choirs once rioted.<words>343</words>
I planted the crystal seeds beneath the ashen soil, their light seeping downward like moonlit water.<words>359</words>
Through the silent overture of tomorrow, sprouts surfaced, each leaf chiming the faint echo of violin harmonics.<words>376</words>
Birds returned first, tracing logically illogical migration loops as though led by unseen staves on the sky.<words>393</words>
Then jaguars padded back, their footfalls matching the heartbeat I once denied them.<words>406</words>
As canopy choruses swelled, the dull radiance of my airborne museum felt distant, a faded lantern to a forgiven night.<words>426</words>
The roar inside me dwindled to a hush, replaced by the living hush of forests that never needed my curatorship.<words>446</words>
