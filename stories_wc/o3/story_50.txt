The glass desert sang beneath a bleached noon, its dunes shimmering like shattered mirrors spread across eternity. <words>17</words>
Brother Elias trudged alone, an unconvinced missionary whose boots crunched crystal shards instead of familiar sand. <words>33</words>
He had come seeking God’s last whisper during the migration of the last monarch butterfly, hoping to become a conduit for magic, but doubt gnawed. <words>58</words>
Each orange wing that drifted overhead felt more like a farewell letter than divine assurance. <words>73</words>
Clutched in his satchel lay a tarnished silver fork, the sole relic of an abandoned communion set. <words>90</words>
Its prongs caught light inconsistently, capriciously consistent with the way faith sometimes glimmers then recedes. <words>105</words>
Elias hoped the fork might still conduct grace, yet he mostly used it to scratch doubt into dust. <words>123</words>
Nightfall arrived soundless, and a forgotten saloon shell offered shade, its roof collapsed around a rusted piano. <words>140</words>
He pressed keys; the strings were slack, producing hollow booms that swirled against glass dunes like ghosts. <words>157</words>
Yet patterns trembled within the noise, and Elias began decoding the untuned echoes the way mystics read fire. <words>175</words>
Low C, cracked G, silence, high E—he mapped them upon the desert floor like cryptic constellations. <words>191</words>
The scatter resembled butterfly wings, convincing him the instrument concealed instructions left by a capriciously consistent deity. <words>208</words>
Following the shape, he buried the tarnished fork beneath a ridge of translucent sand, an act of concealment. <words>226</words>
If the fork truly channeled holiness, hiding it might force heaven to search, revealing whether heaven cared at all. <words>245</words>
Hours slipped like melting glass, and monarchs fluttered westward, their dwindling column glowing ember-bright against the dusk. <words>262</words>
Elias waited inside the saloon ruin, heartbeat syncing to the erratic metronome of wind through broken strings. <words>279</words>
A single butterfly veered from the swarm and perched on middle C, its wings closing like stained-glass shutters. <words>297</words>
The piano resonated softly, harmonizing dissonance into one clear note that pointed, unmistakably, to the buried fork. <words>314</words>
Elias retrieved it, and the metal, though tarnished, felt suddenly warm, pulsing as though remembering being silver lightning. <words>332</words>
His faith, long tested, flexed like a cracked but living branch daring spring to return. <words>347</words>
The butterfly rose, circled his head, then dissolved into glitter that sank through Elias’s skin like rain through loam. <words>366</words>
Within the hush he felt currents of unseen syllables, and realized he had become the conduit for magic sought. <words>385</words>
Still, the revelation arrived not as triumph but as alone intimacy, a quiet hand pressing his own heartbeat. <words>403</words>
He understood that capriciously consistent divinity preferred whispers, requiring seekers to decode echoes rather than shout creeds at sky. <words>422</words>
So Elias stayed among glass dunes until dawn, practicing silence, his fork drawn like a tuning rod for wonder. <words>441</words>
When the sun rose, the monarchs were gone, the desert dimmed, but music trembled within his pulse forever. <words>459</words>
