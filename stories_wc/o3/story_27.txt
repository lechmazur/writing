The herons wheeled overhead while Sawyer Vance raised his binoculars above the crumbling ferris wheel. <words>15</words>
He insisted the outing was mere bird watching, yet the abandoned amusement park whistled with other winged memories. <words>33</words>
Under the striped awning of the long-defunct prize booth, Ira Mallory waited, fingertips drumming a vintage pencil box. <words>51</words>
Ira was a cynic cursed to speak only truth, every syllable landing like sober thunder on soft soil. <words>69</words>
Years ago a carny's vengeful whisper had bound him politely vindictive, unable to lie yet eager to needle. <words>87</words>
Tonight his target was Sawyer, whose mind, Ira believed, had stagnated like pond water beneath broken swan boats. <words>105</words>
To provoke evolution in that still pool, Ira had woven a quiet scheme following the phases of the moon. <words>124</words>
At each waxing crescent he mailed cryptic postcards; at every waning gibbous he sent cassette tapes of owls. <words>142</words>
Now, under the full hunter's moon, the final thread of his tapestry of fate was ready for tightening. <words>160</words>
Sawyer approached the booth, binoculars banging against his chest like guilty medals. <words>172</words>
"You promised rare rails here," he said, voice feathered with hope he could barely admit existed. <words>188</words>
Ira slid the pencil box across the counter, its lacquer catching moonlight and dust alike. <words>203</words>
"Open it and know," Ira murmured, the truth curse bending his tone into velvet menace. <words>218</words>
Inside Sawyer found a folded map, charcoal sketches of birds transforming into stone silhouettes over successive lunar icons. <words>236</words>
Reading the legend, he understood: if he remained unchanged by dawn, he would petrify along with his obsessions. <words>254</words>
Sawyer laughed, a brittle sound scattered quickly by the nocturnal breeze animating empty cotton-candy bags. <words>269</words>
"Another of your melodramatic truths, friend," he scoffed, yet some glacier under his ribs began the subtlest calving. <words>287</words>
Ira gestured toward the carousel, where stone pigeons already ringed the platform like solemn cherubs. <words>302</words>
Their feathers, once real, had stiffened with each previous crescent, a gallery of warnings Sawyer had misidentified as props. <words>321</words>
Layered tranquility settled over the midway, as if the night itself wished conversation to proceed at museum volume. <words>339</words>
"Why me?" Sawyer whispered, binoculars lowering like surrendered arms. <words>348</words>
"Because fossils make poor students," Ira answered, politely vindictive yet undeniably serene. <words>360</words>
Something in the wording sliced Sawyer free of complacency, and his pulse began tracing unfamiliar constellations behind his eyes. <words>379</words>
He unfolded the map again, noting a path that led from the booth through funhouse shadows toward sunrise. <words>397</words>
Every step marked by a bird species he'd long ignored, each annotated with a question only personal metamorphosis could answer. <words>417</words>
Sawyer straightened, closing the pencil box as though sealing a contract with whatever silent deity curated this moonlit syllabus. <words>436</words>
"Walk with me then," he said, and Ira, bound to truth yet craving change, followed under the herons returning east. <words>456</words>
Behind them the carousel creaked, pigeons flexing ever so slightly, as if flesh reconsidered its agreement with stone. <words>474</words>
