In the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise, Simeon Finch stood like a calm doomsayer among brass gears.<words>20</words>
His steampunk workshop below breathed quiet steam through copper lungs, yet the air felt older than the soot‑smudged rafters.<words>39</words>
He listened, waiting to resume his impossible sermon through the sound of a distant train whistle far down the valley.<words>59</words>
The whistle arrived, thin and yearning, and every cog on his bench seemed to twitch with placid ferocity.<words>77</words>
Only then did he lower a battered old skateboard covered in stickers from its hook, brushing dust off memories etched under peeling vinyl.<words>100</words>
Once, that board had rattled over city sidewalks where children believed tomorrow was endless and engines were merely toys.<words>119</words>
Now, innocence lay dented like the tail of the deck, surrendered to the iron doctrine of steam and consequence.<words>138</words>
Simeon’s eyes, faithfully odd in their mismatched hues, reflected both mourning and resolve as sunlight leaked through knotholes.<words>156</words>
He whispered that progress, unchecked, became a velvet‑gloved tyrant, and that his task was to slam a door on the gods of stagnation.<words>179</words>
Downstairs, miniature locomotives waited in rows, pistons frozen like prayers unanswered.<words>190</words>
He would unfreeze them, not to worship motion, but to reveal where movement must stop before it devoured every quiet morning.<words>211</words>
Balancing the skateboard on an anvil, he welded a clockwork metronome to its underside, sparks hissing like restrained applause.<words>230</words>
Each tick would echo the whistle, reminding riders that time itself rides with them, not behind them.<words>247</words>
When the device cooled, he rolled the board to the loft’s edge and gazed at the blue aura lifting over wheat fields.<words>269</words>
Childhood had smelled like those fields; adulthood smelled like oil, yet both fragrances mingled on the rising breeze.<words>287</words>
He stepped onto the skateboard, letting gears underfoot pulse to life, and pushed forward until the loft’s old door stood before him.<words>309</words>
With one calm breath he kicked, wheels screaming a brass chord, and the door flew outward, slamming destiny’s aperture shut.<words>329</words>
Below, the waiting locomotives jolted alive, halted, then exhaled a collective sigh as though refusing to budge without permission once more.<words>350</words>
Simeon smiled, hearing the distant train whistle fade, replaced by barn swallows rejoicing in brief, unscheduled silence.<words>367</words>
In that pivot of noise and hush, he felt the loss of innocence settle like dew, neither curse nor blessing, simply proof of having awakened.<words>392</words>
And through his faithfully odd heart coursed a newfound certainty that endings can be built, not merely awaited.<words>410</words>
