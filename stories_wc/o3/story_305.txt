Steam from vanilla batter curled through the marble corridors like a prelude of sweetness and memory. <words>16</words>
I, a reticent scholar fleeing library politics, stirred the rising mixture with distracted devotion. <words>30</words>
The caretaker’s message had summoned me to the flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns. <words>45</words>
Rain-swollen canals had burst, submerging velvet seats, yet song still whispered along soaked balconies. <words>59</words>
Such ruin might discourage others, but complacency was the tyrant I had vowed to dethrone. <words>74</words>
The caretaker, technically mischievous despite his grey beard, had promised an object worth any risk. <words>89</words>
He greeted me atop the soggy stage with a conspiratorial knock against the warped proscenium. <words>104</words>
Wood echoed hollowly, and water rippled, as though applauding unseen performers in perpetual encore. <words>118</words>
This, he whispered, was a gathering of echoes, an acoustical séance no critic could predict. <words>133</words>
From his coat he produced an ancient clay tablet with runes glimmering like wet basalt. <words>148</words>
Legend claimed the runes resonated with any hall where silence had once worn silk. <words>162</words>
To unlock them, instructions arrived via sketches hidden in the binding of a vintage dictionary. <words>177</words>
The caretaker had sliced open the spine between brittle definitions of 'capriccio' and 'cascade'. <words>191</words>
We followed the penciled diagrams, planting lanterns at harmonic nodes where drowned chandeliers still swung. <words>206</words>
Meanwhile my cake batter rested backstage beside the generator, its warmth perfuming sheet music. <words>220</words>
Time was measured not by clocks but by how high the batter sighed in the bowl. <words>236</words>
When the lantern grid shimmered correctly, I pressed the tablet to the stage’s hollow heartwood. <words>251</words>
Runes flared, and the flooded orchestra pit began to vibrate, tuning itself like a colossal cello. <words>267</words>
Ripples organized into concentric staves, upon which droplets danced as notes composed in real time. <words>282</words>
The opera house itself was writing music, each echo layering wit over wistfulness. <words>295</words>
I laughed softly, tasting pensive mirth on my tongue like icing yet to set. <words>309</words>
In that moment I saw how scholarship can become prank, and prank become philosophy. <words>323</words>
The caretaker bowed, satisfied that complacency had been knocked from its velvet throne of hush. <words>338</words>
Alarm bells somewhere above suggested the city noticed our rogue symphony, but we remained ankle‑deep in wonder. <words>355</words>
I retrieved the bowl, poured batter into a dented pan, and set it atop a lantern. <words>371</words>
As melodies evaporated into dawn, the cake rose, capturing in its crumb the brief uprising of sound. <words>388</words>
We sliced it later, and every bite tasted like wet velvet remembering thunderous applause. <words>402</words>
Satisfied, I archived the tablet inside my satchel, already plotting the next echo to liberate. <words>417</words>
