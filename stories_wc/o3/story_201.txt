Drifting drums echoed across the ruined fortress perched over a roaring waterfall as Mylo, an impulsive performer, arrived. <words>18</words>
He carried only a tattered satchel and a forgotten music sheet rumored to unlock the fortress’s haunted silence. <words>36</words>
Through the lingering shadows of dusk, violet scars painted fractured stone, and waterfalls sprayed cold mist like impatient applause. <words>55</words>
Restless harmony filled the air, a contradiction Mylo found familiar and thrilling. <words>67</words>
His family claimed he inherited their melodies, yet he felt something weightier: an emotional inheritance of unfinished grief. <words>85</words>
Centuries earlier, his ancestor, the court composer Lyren, had performed here before being falsely accused of treasonous cacophony. <words>103</words>
Lyren died unheard, and the fortress collapsed into myth; Mylo had come to right that historical wrong. <words>120</words>
But Mylo was consistently whimsical, so his plan relied on starlight rather than sober strategy. <words>135</words>
He would track shooting stars until one appeared directly above the collapsed stage, guiding where to place each note. <words>154</words>
Ancient legends insisted falling fire marked truth’s trajectory, and truth was the rhythm Lyren never finished. <words>170</words>
Mylo spread the brittle sheet on a shattered marble slab, its faded ink pulsing whenever thunder rumbled. <words>187</words>
Yet entire measures were missing, ripped away by rain or guilt. <words>198</words>
To restore them, he balanced on the slippery battlement and watched the sky’s bruised belly for the first comet. <words>217</words>
When silver flame streaked westward, he tackled uncertainty the way he always tackled applause—headlong, limbs flailing, heart awake. <words>235</words>
He slammed a palm onto the sheet, and new bars blossomed like constellations marrying ink to inspiration. <words>252</words>
One by one, meteors lit his orchestra of ghosts, every flash revealing spectral violins seated amid rubble. <words>269</words>
They watched him with hollow yet hopeful sockets, as if deciding whether the inheritance had chosen wisely. <words>286</words>
Mylo played the recalled melody on wind-whittled pipes, letting waterfall thunder serve as percussion and dusk as stage lights. <words>305</words>
With each measure, the fortress stones vibrated, realigning into arches the way vertebrae straighten under a mending song. <words>323</words>
Suddenly, the largest star fragmented, and a spear of light pierced the sheet, burning Lyren’s signature into completion. <words>341</words>
The ghosts bowed, the waterfall quieted imperceptibly, and Mylo felt centuries of blame tumble into the chasm below. <words>359</words>
Restless harmony finally resolved, not into silence, but into possibility, and the performer left humming a future no judge could condemn. <words>380</words>
He paused on the threshold where crumbling bridge met forest and tucked the completed sheet beside his ribs, pulses echoing its newfound rhythm. <words>403</words>
Moonrise replaced the last smear of dusk, and every bird awakened early, rehearsing fragments of Lyren’s resurrected theme. <words>421</words>
Mylo laughed, embracing their offbeat choir, knowing whimsy had proved the sharpest compass when guided by shooting stars. <words>439</words>
Some legacies descend like chains, but his now glimmered like distant meteor tails, forever reminding him to tackle darkness with melody. <words>460</words>
