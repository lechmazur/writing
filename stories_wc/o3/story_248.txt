I stalked the abandoned space freighter docking bay with the stagger of an unsteady sentinel on rusted knees. <words>18</words>
Lights failed overhead, yet a strange automaton bird fluttered through shadows, its brass feathers clicking cryptic rhythms. <words>35</words>
The creature was my only ally inside this tomb rocking subtly between worlds colliding outside the portholes. <words>52</words>
I felt cheerless ecstasy, a paradox humming in my chest like coolant pipes singing dirges to lost crews. <words>70</words>
Each step echoed the ambush of fate I had evaded but not escaped. <words>83</words>
Prophecy said the sentinel would die here, mistaken, accused of betrayal, and I marched to clear that fog. <words>101</words>
The bird swooped, dropped a parcel of shredded letters that smelled of ozone and ancient guilt. <words>117</words>
I knelt, hands shaking, and began reassembling shredded letters, obeying the method recommended by the freighter's forgotten log. <words>135</words>
Answers would come only by reassembling shredded letters, the ship's manual insisted in glitchy neon script. <words>151</words>
Lines emerged: 'Engage thrusters when oracles sleep; trust the sentinel; spare the heart of the machine.' <words>167</words>
I realized the misguided prophecy originated from letters deliberately torn by mutineers to mislead rescue teams. <words>183</words>
Outside, gravitational alarms wailed; two rogue planets lurched closer, calculating minutes until hulls shrieked like rending parchment. <words>200</words>
Timeframe shrank, a liminal gasp between worlds colliding, and decisions sharpened with catastrophic clarity. <words>214</words>
The automaton bird tilted its head coyly furious, as though offended by my hesitation to embrace truth revealed. <words>232</words>
Its glass eyes flickered a recommendation—no, a command—to vent the bay and jettison the false scriptures. <words>248</words>
I whispered, 'I recommend mercy,' and tossed the reassembled stack into a recycle furnace yawning like a red dwarf. <words>267</words>
Flames devoured the dogma, releasing data bursts the ship interpreted as authorization to reroute remaining power to shields. <words>285</words>
Bulkheads groaned, then realigned; the sentinel's wobble steadied as artificial gravity rebalanced with improbable grace. <words>300</words>
Cheerless ecstasy peaked within me, for survival meant testifying against ghosts I once served. <words>314</words>
The ambush of fate thus inverted, swallowed by choices forged in welding arcs and resurrected text. <words>330</words>
Sirens silenced; external monitors showed the colliding worlds skimming past in a tidal kiss instead of annihilation. <words>347</words>
The freighter shuddered, but held, suspended in a corridor of starlight like a survivor refusing medical leave. <words>364</words>
In the fragrant smoke the automaton bird perched on my shoulder, its gears settling into a patient lullaby. <words>382</words>
I, once an unsteady sentinel, saluted the empty bay, no longer wobbling but waiting for overdue vindication. <words>399</words>
Somewhere beyond the bulkheads the prophecy's authors screamed at their miscalculation, yet destiny recorded my steadied stance. <words>416</words>
Between worlds colliding, I guarded tomorrow, coyly furious at the past, exhilarated by sorrow, and perfectly alive. <words>433</words>
