After the last breath of a dying god drifted away, the world exhaled in stunned, echoing hush. <words>17</words>
Inside a shared dream recording studio, Lucent, an apathetic summoner, watched plaster dust glitter in blue monitor light. <words>35</words>
He was enthusiastically lazy, greeting each urgent astral request with a yawn bright enough to startle metronomes. <words>52</words>
Yet today a river of whispered wisdom seeped through the mixing board, nudging even his slack conscience awake. <words>70</words>
The river wisdom spoke of bleaching reefs cracked like porcelain, of seahorses adrift where polyps once sang. <words>87</words>
It promised guidance if Lucent abandoned apathy and anchored purpose in salt and sunlight. <words>101</words>
Lucent sighed, swung his chair, and stared at the rustic coffee grinder perched on the console like an artifact. <words>120</words>
During breaks he ground beans, letting their scent impersonate motivation, though caffeine never breached his cultivated disengagement. <words>137</words>
Now the grinder rattled without touch, its handle turning as if the river itself sought a physical throat. <words>155</words>
A thin stream of grounds spilled, forming miniature deltas that unfold into topographic maps of damaged coral kingdoms. <words>173</words>
Lucent understood the summoning: rebuild coral reefs or watch dreams themselves bleach into silence. <words>187</words>
But every portal still had to be opened through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall, a procedure he dreaded. <words>208</words>
He remembered the deserted hall beneath the studio where forgotten album covers once promoted futures now obsolete. <words>225</words>
Down he drifted, mug of coffee in hand, wearing gentle sharpness like a pressed but comfortable suit. <words>242</words>
He found matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall, twin rows facing each other like doorways embarrassed by vacancy. <words>262</words>
Lucent placed the coffee grinder between the first pair and murmured a chord that tasted of brine and hesitancy. <words>281</words>
The frames shimmered, glass replacing glass, corridor within corridor, until a liquid horizon appeared, rolling turquoise beneath bruised clouds. <words>300</words>
He stepped through, each stride leaving a footprint of steaming coffee that instantly cooled into seedlings of stony coral. <words>319</words>
The river wisdom flowed overhead now, an airborne current singing logistics, oxygen ratios, and the mathematics of restoration. <words>337</words>
Enthusiastically lazy by habit, Lucent allowed the current to carry him, yet his heart, startled, began drafting blueprints. <words>355</words>
He let diagrams unfold into the sea, and nanoscopic polyps printed themselves from dreamstuff, settling where coffee grains guided them. <words>375</words>
Days might have passed or merely inhalations, but coral spires soon radiated prism light, echoing the chord he had murmured. <words>395</words>
Exhausted yet awake, Lucent returned through the matching empty frames, leaving the grinder to pulse like a heartbeat in paradise. <words>415</words>
Back in the studio, he recorded the river's lullaby, knowing listeners would sleep inside reefs that now could never drown. <words>435</words>
