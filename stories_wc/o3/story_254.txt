Jeremiah Slate, once lauded as television's funniest man, now stood stone-faced in a deserted playground at the edge of a wilderness, rehearsing lines no audience would ever hear. <words>28</words>
His reputation as a humorless comedic actor was the cruelest punchline he never delivered. <words>42</words>
Agents sent him piles of novelty props, each an unwanted gift reminding him of jokes that refused to live. <words>61</words>
Today he clutched the newest arrival--an antique inkwell, dried out and useless, black mouth gaping like an exhausted fish. <words>80</words>
Across the cracked seesaw, wind-borne sand skated circles, sketching diagrams only the absent children could decode. <words>96</words>
He let his mind slip, as always, through persistent daydream loops where laughter obeyed his command. <words>112</words>
In each loop he bottled applause like starlight, believing the jar might glow long enough to warm him. <words>130</words>
But applause faded, and the imagined jar cracked, releasing only the cold motive that truly drove him—to bottle a star's dying breath for real. <words>154</words>
He believed such essence, captured, could ignite his silence with cosmic humor no critic could dismiss. <words>170</words>
Yet the universe kept gifting him emptiness—objectively personal insults wrapped in bright packaging. <words>183</words>
He wanted a telescope, received clown shoes; begged for a spectrograph, got this fossil of ink. <words>199</words>
Jeremiah knelt beside the swing set, its chains whining like distant gulls through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry. <words>218</words>
He pried the inkwell open, hoping some residue remained, but conceded that hope was another rubber chicken. <words>235</words>
Still, the wind carried a brittle smell, as if scorched parchment whispered from the bottle's throat. <words>251</words>
Daydream loop again: night sky shattering, one star tumbling, exhaling its last luminous sigh into his waiting palm. <words>269</words>
He uncorks the imaginary jar, tips the sigh into the inkwell, and the fish-mouth drinks celestial ink. <words>286</words>
On the page formed in his head, jokes bloom like nebulae, vast, terrible, beautiful, finally funny. <words>302</words>
He snaps awake; the playground is darker, the wilderness humming with secret currents. <words>315</words>
A single meteor scratches the horizon, its tail a silver surrender. <words>326</words>
Jeremiah thrusts the dried inkwell toward the falling light, conceding, pleading, daring timing to misbehave. <words>341</words>
The meteor snuffs before the ink can taste it, but something soundless crashes into the bottle anyway. <words>358</words>
Violet vapor swirls inside, illuminating his gaunt face with a punchline older than gravity. <words>372</words>
No laughter erupts; instead, a calm certainty arrives—humor is merely the echo of dying stars. <words>387</words>
He finally smiles, a small concession to the cosmos, and sets the glowing inkwell on the sandbox, an objectively personal gift he will never open again. <words>413</words>
