The careless pilot drifted his battered biplane below storm clouds, chasing a deliberately dreamy sense of purpose.<words>17</words>
He longed to land within the twisted orchard labyrinth in an enchanted oak grove murmured about in weathered flight logs.<words>37</words>
A jagged rumble faded overhead, marking the lull between echoing thunder and fresh rain he always trusted as omen.<words>56</words>
Touching down on a clearing of slick moss, he pocketed one worn-out glove, leaving its mate atop the throttle.<words>75</words>
The grove breathed petrichor and woodsmoke, a perfume of resigned exuberance he inhaled with contrite lungs.<words>91</words>
His mission, absurd yet holy, was to archive natural patterns before the coming century flattened them into algorithms.<words>109</words>
But his own memories had frayed, so he flew on borrowed memories scavenged from strangers' dreams and misfiled meteorology reports.<words>129</words>
Those secondhand recollections insisted that the orchard's impossible geometry recorded windpaths the way bark records seasons.<words>145</words>
To emancipate the patterns from obscurity, he would map them with ink and return them to the clouds.<words>163</words>
Guidance, according to rumor, could be found by investigating sinister doodles on used postcards pinned to the orchard gates.<words>182</words>
He followed warped pickets until a wooden arch appeared, plastered with damp postcards portraying beaches, cathedrals, and silent crashes.<words>201</words>
Each card bore the same spiraling glyph, a black seed splitting into forked lightning and knotted roots.<words>218</words>
He touched the glyph with his bare hand; the borrowed memories inside him shivered like reeds in backwash.<words>236</words>
Visions blossomed of orchard walkways rearranging whenever travelers lied, and of gloves forever searching for their partners.<words>253</words>
Through the gauzy revelation he noticed a faint path lined with oak roots twisted into arrows pointing inward.<words>271</words>
He trailed it deeper, counting heartbeats to keep from drifting, until thunder's echo became memory instead of sound.<words>289</words>
Within a secluded clearing stood a towering index cabinet grown from living trunks, drawers humming like beehives.<words>306</words>
He slid the single worn-out glove into an empty slot labeled 'Prevailing Breezes, Unclaimed,' and the cabinet unlocked itself.<words>325</words>
Drawers opened outward, releasing streams of translucent leaves that whirled upward, sketching isobars across the moonlit drizzle.<words>342</words>
He realized the orchard archived its own patterns, and his task was merely to witness their emancipation.<words>359</words>
With resigned exuberance, he saluted the storm, accepting that careless pilots sometimes served as custodians of wiser roots.<words>377</words>
As fresh rain finally arrived, the borrowed memories returned to the sky, and he, lightened, taxied toward the tangled exit.<words>397</words>
Behind him, the cabinet whispered thanks in languages shaped like shifting weather fronts.<words>410</words>
