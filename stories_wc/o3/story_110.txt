Between chapters of his own unfinished autobiography, Marlo the quietly flamboyant clocksmith unlocked the shop at dawn. <words>17</words>
The Water Clock Repair Shop stood on a canal that coughed fog like a forgetful dragon. <words>33</words>
Inside, pendulums dripped minutes into copper cups, a jury of gears deliberating over time's slippages. <words>48</words>
To visitors Marlo appeared harmless, though his topaz-tipped cane concealed the tools of a hidden assassin. <words>64</words>
He adored silence the way gardeners adore rain, except his garden was an archive of interrupted heartbeats. <words>81</words>
Clients arrived with domestic mysteries disguised as malfunctioning clocks. <words>90</words>
A wife requested her water clock adjusted because it wept louder than her husband ever had. <words>106</words>
Marlo listened, nodding with despairing humor, already scripting the bleak eulogies that would reveal tonight's hidden truths. <words>123</words>
His motivation sang like a broken music box: transmute pain into a masterpiece no critic could survive. <words>140</words>
Each case became pigment, each confession a brushstroke across the canvases he kept rolled behind leaking barrels. <words>157</words>
Tonight, the moss-covered lantern suspended above the counter flickered, signaling the arrival of his real employer. <words>173</words>
The Duchess of Spilled Tea glided in, wearing grief like perfume and money like a rash. <words>189</words>
She whispered that her heirloom clock now drummed a second, secret heartbeat; she needed it silenced discreetly. <words>206</words>
Marlo accepted the commission, knowing the target was the Duchess herself, woven into gears by blackmail. <words>222</words>
He would murder her legend, not her body, by repairing the clock so perfectly it revealed her sins. <words>240</words>
At midnight he wrote the eulogy, a comedic dirge comparing spilled tea to spilled blood, laughter curdling. <words>257</words>
Lines hinted that the Duchess adored poisoners the way poets adore moons, naming dates, boats, and witnesses. <words>274</words>
He slid the parchment into the clock's reservoir where water would dilute ink exactly at sunrise, unveiling paragraphs. <words>292</words>
Satisfied, Marlo polished the innocent moss on the lantern, disguising fingerprints beneath emerald fuzz. <words>306</words>
Soon the city would awake, hear the water clock sob out accusations, and rush to court. <words>322</words>
He pictured jurors drowning in polite scandal, their verdict a spur for his next, darker masterpiece. <words>338</words>
Between chapters again, he locked the shop, his flamboyant cape tucked under drab overalls, anonymity shrugging. <words>354</words>
The canal dragon of fog exhaled approval, or maybe warning, as he vanished across the iron bridge. <words>371</words>
Somewhere a rooster mispronounced dawn and Marlo laughed, despairing and amused, because mispronunciations were simply murders of language. <words>389</words>
He vowed the next obituary would rhyme, turning sorrow into music so catchy even corpses would tap toe bones. <words>408</words>
Until then, the quiet lantern, the water clocks, and the canal kept their shared secret: they adored him. <words>426</words>
