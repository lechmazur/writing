Foam hissed against ultraviolet sand as Edwina, a selectively mute ventriloquist, stepped onto the parallel universe beach. <words>17</words>
Her wooden puppet, Larkspur, bobbed under her arm, its painted smile stuck in hopelessly optimistic certainty. <words>33</words>
Edwina had promised to speak only through Larkspur after the last call at the diner on the corner. <words>51</words>
That call, accidentally overheard, revealed that distant storms were writing coded love letters across dimensions. <words>66</words>
Ever since, archiving weather patterns felt less like science and more like decoding family gossip leaking through thunder. <words>84</words>
Edwina unfolded a solar notebook, pages flickering with holographic barometers, intent on capturing the surf’s atmospheric tantrum. <words>101</words>
Larkspur’s chin clicked, and through him she addressed the horizon with a ventriloquial voice flavoured like sea-salt static. <words>119</words>
“Speak back, cousins of cloud,” the puppet cried, vibrating with euphoric agitation that jittered Edwina’s own silent ribs. <words>137</words>
A cardboard coffee sleeve, washed ashore like a tiny crown, landed at her feet, still warm with quantum espresso. <words>156</words>
She slid it onto Larkspur’s neck, knighting him as Ambassador of Recycled Royalty. <words>169</words>
The sleeve’s barista scribble read, “Family discounts apply,” and the phrase buzzed like prophecy. <words>183</words>
Patronizing gulls scoffed overhead, their laughter a brittle judgment of shorebound humanoid rituals. <words>196</words>
Edwina ignored them, hopelessly optimistic that even sarcasm could become data in her weather archives. <words>211</words>
She planted microphones disguised as seashells, each tuned to frequencies where barometric pressure bled into whispered confessions. <words>228</words>
From one shell, a voice identical to her own mother’s emerged: “Stormfront Beta just wants a hug.” <words>245</words>
Edwina’s heart pounded because her mother had vanished years ago during a monsoon, pronounced lost at sea and memory. <words>264</words>
The beach shimmered, grains rearranging into a family table where cumulonimbus place settings waited for conversation. <words>280</words>
Larkspur, wearing the sleeve, sat at the head, clearing his wooden throat to mediate reconciliation between human and weather. <words>299</words>
Through him, Edwina asked the clouds why they stole voices and parents. <words>311</words>
A reply gusted, carrying salt, sorrow, and giddy relief: “We record emotions, but we forget to return them.” <words>329</words>
Lightning flickered like camera flashes, photographing the collective heartbeat of tide, wind, and woman. <words>343</words>
In that strobe, Edwina realized she could redefine family as any system that archived each other faithfully. <words>360</words>
The storm, the sleeve, the puppet, and her own pulse formed a makeshift genealogy chart scribbled across the horizon. <words>379</words>
She pledged, through Larkspur’s grin, to catalogue not only pressure readings but also every stray joke, lullaby, and seagull insult. <words>399</words>
Because someday, when another accidental phone call crackled across universes, someone would need proof that weather once loved them back. <words>419</words>
