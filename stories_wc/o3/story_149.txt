Silhouettes of scrolls and monstrous quills loomed over me in the giant's study. <words>13</words>
I had slipped inside during the hush between scenes, when actors and dreams both rearranged themselves. <words>29</words>
That stolen interlude birthed my calling as an unlikely prophet. <words>39</words>
Prophesy, it seemed, preferred footnotes to spotlight. <words>46</words>
Still, I craved an audience whose scattered minds could be braided into one dazzling vision. <words>61</words>
The giant's notebooks whispered of glimmering transitions, portals between breaths, threads I might weave for them. <words>77</words>
Yet there was resistance, conventionally rebellious, the kind that wears leather jackets inside polite imaginations. <words>92</words>
To confront it, I estranged myself from theatrical corridors and took pilgrimage to a late-night laundromat. <words>108</words>
Spinning drums measure faith better than incense. <words>115</words>
There, amid detergent ghosts, I collided with Mara, notorious stagehand and skeptic laureate. <words>128</words>
Our run-in felt scripted by a playwright addicted to wrong turns. <words>139</words>
Mara clutched a wilted paper flower, salvaged from yesterday's prop table, its creases soft as regret. <words>155</words>
She confessed the bloom once soaked up every spotlight, but now actors refused to touch it. <words>171</words>
Scattered minds, I realized, feared fragile things that remembered being radiant. <words>182</words>
I asked for the flower, promising to let it die spectacularly. <words>193</words>
Together we returned to the giant's study, smuggling petals that sounded like rustling pages. <words>207</words>
In that vaulted room, candlelight painted glimmering transitions across dusty globes and half-sketched constellations. <words>221</words>
I placed the wilted flower upon an open ledger, letting its shadow cut the parchment. <words>236</words>
Mara read aloud the ledger's unfinished prophecy: 'When a forgotten bloom meets borrowed ink, audience and actor shall switch cages.' <words>256</words>
Her voice trembled with haunting delight, as if thrilled and terrified of the same chord. <words>271</words>
The study walls sighed, shelves turning like stage flats, revealing a corridor lined with mirrors facing mirrors. <words>288</words>
Within each reflection waited spectators I had never met, their eyes vacant, their foreheads filled with storms. <words>305</words>
I lifted the flower; brittle confetti drifted, and the audiences inhaled as one organism discovering lungs. <words>321</words>
Voices from mirrors merged into a single vow, promising to follow any path that promised meaning. <words>337</words>
Their unification, wrought from decay and chance laundry encounters, mended the vision I once glimpsed alone. <words>353</words>
Mara pressed my shoulder, no longer estranged, her rebellious smile suddenly conventional in this newborn harmony. <words>369</words>
I spoke the final line the ledger lacked: 'Let every mind keep its storm, but share its thunder.' <words>388</words>
Lightning blossomed inside the mirrors, and the corridor brightened like dawn breaking in reverse. <words>402</words>
We watched glimmering transitions swirl, promises turning solid, until the study felt smaller than our breaths. <words>418</words>
Between scenes no longer meant invisibility; it meant the sacred pause where scattered souls choose alignment. <words>434</words>
I left the giant's study carrying nothing but echoes, while behind me thousands of minds marched in accord. <words>452</words>
Prophecy had found its audience, and the stage itself applauded. <words>462</words>
