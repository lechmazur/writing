I, Quillam the understudy sorcerer, slid into the salt crystal growing chamber during the rinse cycle. <words>16</words>
Machines hummed with sudsy thunder, yet their rhythm disguised my true orchestra of intentions. <words>30</words>
I had come, obnoxiously polite as always, to hinder my master by stealing his next revelation. <words>46</words>
He believed only clanging cauldrons raised secrets, but I sought quieter tools. <words>58</words>
That is why I carried the small cardboard box tucked under my robe like contraband sugar. <words>74</words>
Inside rattled shards of salt that remembered every conversation ever washed through the chamber drains. <words>89</words>
Their memories would map cultural evolution of apprentices, detergents, and disappointments across centuries. <words>102</words>
Yet to awaken such unheard residue, one must listen elsewhere first. <words>113</words>
So I pressed my ear to the ventilation root that tunneled from an ancient oak grove far above. <words>131</words>
Through that wooden conduit trickled mesquite‑warm whispers, hushed footnotes of leaves discussing shoe styles and revolutions. <words>147</words>
By eavesdropping on the whispers of an ancient oak grove, I could align salt voices with forest gossip. <words>165</words>
Alignment mattered; a wrong pairing would wake the unheard into screeching pandemonium rather than discoursing academics. <words>181</words>
Laundry timers chirped, granting me exactly eight minutes before the dryers disgorged witnesses. <words>194</words>
I uncorked the box, poured the gritty memories onto the glowing salt pillars, and whispered borrowed leaf‑phrases. <words>211</words>
The crystals brightened, forming holographic silhouettes of long‑dead launderers debating sleeve lengths during imperial eclipses. <words>226</words>
Their arguments bled into oak murmurs about bark fashion, weaving a cross‑temporal etiquette symposium. <words>240</words>
I noted how self‑consciousness sprouted simultaneously in cloth and cambium, a branching proof of convergent protocol evolution. <words>257</words>
But the symposium began critiquing my posture, demanding I introduce myself and apologize for spying. <words>272</words>
Obnoxiously polite instincts activated, I bowed so low my hat kissed suds, repeatedly saying 'Terribly sorry for the inconvenience.' <words>291</words>
My contrition somehow pleased both salts and sap, and they resumed trading anecdotes about textile rebellions and acorn unions. <words>310</words>
From their chatter I distilled chronologies, tracing cultural evolution by the cadence of jokes rather than the dates mentioned. <words>329</words>
Suddenly a spin cycle ended, and the chamber lights flickered like startled fireflies. <words>342</words>
My master’s shadow loomed in the doorway, his silhouette sharp as a hanger and twice as judgmental. <words>359</words>
I sealed the box, but not before a crystal voice giggled, alerting him to unheard awakenings now fully awake. <words>378</words>
He strode forward, yet the salt holograms blocked his path, eager to hinder any noisy experimentation with shivering courtesy. <words>397</words>
Amid the tumbling towels, I slipped away, carrying centuries of polite insurgency. <words>409</words>
