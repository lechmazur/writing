The cathedral above roared with a final bell, then silence folded downward like dust.<words>14</words>
Between that echo and the next toll, Hadrik the blacksmith descended the spiral stone throat.<words>29</words>
Indifference glazed his eyes; he had forged blades for crusaders yet felt for none.<words>43</words>
Still, a summons far stranger than war had whispered through the grates of his furnace.<words>58</words>
It promised covenant, unknown and wordless, if he carried certain relics beneath the altar.<words>72</words>
So he hauled a rough satchel, not to pray, but to haw and barter with whatever answered.<words>89</words>
The catacombs coiled like some uniquely natural root system carved by haunted masons.<words>102</words>
Torchlight shimmered upon walls where saints were chiseled rising from rubble toward unreachable dawns.<words>116</words>
Hadrik felt nothing except mild irritation at dampness seeping through his boots.<words>128</words>
He reached a crypt whose door had been replaced by a honeycomb of shelves.<words>142</words>
Upon each niche rested one piece from his collection, objects that told the story demanded by the whisper.<words>160</words>
There was the cracked horseshoe of a deserter, a thimble hammered from siege coin, and a faded ribbon once binding a martyr's hair.<words>183</words>
He laid them in sequence, letting metal and cloth speak where his tongue would not.<words>198</words>
The air responded with a low inhalation, as though the corridor itself considered the offering.<words>213</words>
Stone slabs groaned, and from cracks sifted powdered bones, rising like pale smoke.<words>226</words>
Form coalesced: a faceless figure sculpted from rubble and memory, taller than his forge chimney.<words>241</words>
Hadrik did not bow; he merely awaited appraisal, arms slack, eyes dull.<words>253</words>
The figure stretched a limb that was not a limb and touched the faded ribbon.<words>268</words>
Memories not his flooded the chamber—sunlit processions, orchards alive, children haw brittle candies to passing monks.<words>284</words>
With each vision, the ribbon brightened, and the rubble figure steadied, as if gaining spine.<words>299</words>
Yet the blacksmith remained unmoved, his role only to temper what emerged.<words>311</words>
A bell far above tongued once, warning of time’s narrow hinge.<words>322</words>
Between bells, covenants must close, the whisper had said.<words>331</words>
The figure bowed instead of him, and dust rained like applause.<words>342</words>
From its collapsing torso rolled a pebble shaped as an uncut gem, glowing softly.<words>356</words>
Hadrik pocketed the pebble with the same shrug he offered every coin at market.<words>370</words>
The ribbon, now crimson, drifted upward, threading itself into cracks, sealing passage behind him.<words>384</words>
The rubble settled, the faceless voice quiet, and the satchel felt curiously lighter.<words>397</words>
Knowing the covenant complete, he turned back toward the spiral, rising from rubble without triumph or regret.<words>414</words>
The next bell pealed, swallowing his footsteps, and the catacombs resumed their patient dark.<words>428</words>
