Red dust drummed against the crystal panes of the biodome on Mars as Idris, a restless tailor, stitched by flickering grow lamps. <words>22</words>
His clientele were phantom shoppers who wandered the dome's abandoned bookshop aisles amid bookshop mysteries, craving stories they could no longer read but could still wear. <words>48</words>
These spectral patrons arrived through ephemeral cameo appearances, shimmering like page edges caught in sunrise before vanishing with a polite nod. <words>69</words>
Idris listened to their unfinished sentences echo, and let their half‑remembered plots reverberate in his head while his needle danced. <words>89</words>
He was earnestly deceptive, selling garments stitched from torn library bindings yet promising that each coat contained the vanished chapters it lacked. <words>111</words>
The lie soothed the ghosts, but it also fed Idris's secret motivation: to sculpt a new tomorrow from ruin, thread by rescued thread. <words>134</words>
Each night he prowled the shuttered stacks for salvage, guided only by a forgotten lantern whose cracked lens cast lunar crescents on dusty spines. <words>158</words>
Though its wick was almost ash, the lantern's stubborn glow mirrored the grit of endurance that Mars demanded from every survivor. <words>179</words>
Outside the dome, storms raged like libraries aflame, shredding the terraformed horizon, reminding Idris that stories and habitats could both collapse overnight. <words>201</words>
Inside, cautious abandon guided him; he dared to dream audacious patches while fearing every snapped thread might unravel the airlock seals. <words>222</words>
One dawn, a new phantom appeared—a child in a cracked helmet clutching a melted bookmark—and asked for a cloak that could breathe. <words>244</words>
Idris realized the apparition was the dome itself, or what remained of its innocence, pleading for a skin to hold oxygen where glass failed. <words>268</words>
Moved, he cut panels from the last unread atlases, mapping rivers that never existed onto fabric destined to protect real lungs. <words>289</words>
As he sewed, every hammered stitch sounded like a turning page, and the echoes persuaded the storms to pause, if only to listen. <words>312</words>
When the cloak was done, he draped it over the biodome's pressure scar, and the garment pulsed, inflating with communal breath exhaled by the ghosts. <words>337</words>
Their cameo silhouettes brightened, no longer ephemeral, and in gratitude they left within Idris’s workshop a sealed crate of unopened seed volumes. <words>359</words>
Inside each volume sprouted micro‑text genetically encoded to grow into crops when planted in Martian soil, literature quite literally becoming sustenance. <words>380</words>
With lantern raised, Idris stepped to the airlock, heart hammering, ready to stitch fields onto the planet’s blank canvas and author the horizon. <words>403</words>
