During the hush after a car backfires in a silent street, I taste dust from centuries away. <words>17</words>
The blast's echo settles into my bones as I, a weary undertaker, unlock the museum's side door. <words>34</words>
Tonight the exhibits change shape, for the curators have asked me to escort one relic through dreaming hours. <words>52</words>
They fear it, yet they dare not admit fear in daylight. <words>63</words>
I roll the draped cart down corridors until the city lights die behind stained glass, revealing the reimagined palace. <words>82</words>
Marble lions borrowed from Persepolis guard halls painted with neon constellations that pulse like heartbeats under emergency lamps. <words>100</words>
Here, an astronomical clock the size of a tyrant's throne waits inside its crate, hands frozen at midnight. <words>118</words>
The mechanism once crowned an ancient Persian palace, mapping solstice shadows across alabaster floors. <words>132</words>
Court astronomers could imprison hours themselves simply by following sun paths through its gilded gears. <words>147</words>
That tribal knowledge, secretly passed from mason to mason, was rarely practical yet always coveted by monarchs fearing eclipse. <words>166</words>
Now the monarchy is long ash, and I am tasked to bury their clock where no broker can barter it. <words>186</words>
But I open the crate instead, because hope hides wherever gears pretend to be stars. <words>201</words>
I set the clock upright, and its obsidian face drinks the flashlight’s beam with placid ferocity. <words>217</words>
To test its heart, I rotate the outer ring until Virgo meets Orion, and something clicks like distant hooves. <words>236</words>
Gears whirl; simulated dawn spills across painted walls, showing hidden passages curling beneath the museum’s foundations. <words>252</words>
Legends said the palace tunneled toward the horizon so rulers could escape nightfall, yet never found courage to flee. <words>271</words>
I descend alone, lantern swinging, because undertakers walk where others refuse, gathering what hope survives oblivion. <words>287</words>
The tunnel air smells of copper coins and old roses, as though mourning still pays its taxes here. <words>305</words>
At the terminus I find a chamber whose ceiling mirrors the astronomical clock, constellations etched in lapis lazuli. <words>323</words>
A pedestal waits, carved with commands to imprison despair itself inside the clock when darkness feels absolute. <words>340</words>
I remember the car’s backfire aboveground, how sudden noise can masquerade as ending, yet leave silence softer afterwards. <words>358</words>
So I wind the main spring fully, whispering names of every mourner I have guided, each syllable a star. <words>377</words>
The clock drinks the litany and begins to glow, scattering midnight like sand through invisible fountains. <words>393</words>
I feel the chamber tilt toward dawn that has not yet happened, yet already promises to arrive. <words>410</words>
Carrying placid ferocity inside my ribcage, I guide the released light back upstairs, determined to hold onto hope. <words>428</words>
Above, the street still rests, its silence no longer hollow but breathing with all the constellations we choose to remember. <words>448</words>
