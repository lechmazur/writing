In the gleaming atrium of the extraterrestrial embassy, Valerius the secretive conjurer lingered behind silvery banners and orchid sconces quietly.<words>20</words>
Trumpets rehearsed upstairs, for the first dance had not begun, granting him covert minutes to rehearse calculated dreams once more.<words>40</words>
Hidden within his sleeve lay a threadbare washcloth, frayed but embroidered with planetary sigils that only he understood in secret.<words>60</words>
The cloth would veil the wild elementals he meant to tame, once their raw currents bent toward his whispered glyphs.<words>80</words>
Yet motivation alone was insufficient; he needed a catalyst, and so he unclasped his mother's meteorite brooch, its shimmering opal center.<words>101</words>
The heirloom piece of jewelry sparked a story whenever touched, projecting holographic memories of coastal storms and verdant thunderfields aloft.<words>121</words>
Ambassadors from seven galaxies paused to watch the lightplay, their philosophically shallow commentaries skating across its depths like mayflies briefly.<words>141</words>
Valerius noted which layered reflections left them wordless, for silence revealed compassion in strata thicker than ceremonial speeches this night.<words>161</words>
He mapped those layers of compassion onto a mental lattice, each kindly pause becoming a knot of potential energy there.<words>181</words>
When the lunar conductor announced five minutes until the music, pressure tightened, like gravity uninvited to an airless ballroom suddenly.<words>201</words>
Valerius exhaled, draping the washcloth over the brooch, merging relic and rag into a paradox of humble grandeur for everyone.<words>221</words>
From that junction seeped verdigris vapor that corkscrewed above delegates' heads, forming translucent stallions rearing beyond the chandeliers of quartz.<words>241</words>
The elementals, half-wild music of ozone and mist, awaited the gesture that would tame them into a planetary anthem tonight.<words>261</words>
But Valerius hesitated, remembering his tutor's warning that controlling nature without empathy doomed every spell to brittle tyranny and collapse.<words>281</words>
So he peeled back the mental lattice, exposing softer glimmersâ€”the childhood lullaby of an Andromedan envoy, a Martian steward's tear.<words>301</words>
Each memory folded over the next like petals, layering compassion upon compassion until the vapor stallions bent their crystal necks.<words>321</words>
They nuzzled ambassadors' palms, offering static kisses that tasted of rain, and the gallery inhaled a collective, astonished breath together.<words>341</words>
In that hush, Valerius redirected the storm-song toward the embassy's biosphere domes, willing seeds to sprout in seconds right there.<words>361</words>
Emerald vines unfurled along marble pillars, weaving living entrances through which the orchestra would soon march, awestruck and grateful inside.<words>381</words>
As the conductor lifted his baton at last, Valerius slipped into shadow, satisfied that nature's power had been honored, not possessed.<words>402</words>
