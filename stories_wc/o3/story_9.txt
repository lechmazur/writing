Between the lost years and whatever comes next, I staggered into the neon-lit desert where billboards crowded the horizon like quarrelsome prophets. <words>22</words>
Their flickering ads promised salvation through soda, surgery, or subscription, but I, a mildly panicked soothsayer, knew brighter lies when I smelled ozone. <words>45</words>
My motivation, whispered by sand scorpions, was to shape destiny with bare hands before someone with cleaner gloves did the shaping. <words>66</words>
That probably unlikely ambition clanged inside my ribs like an off-key wind chime. <words>79</words>
Still, destiny felt lockable, so I carried a pocket puzzle box with thirteen crimson locks across its brass face, each one thirsting for a true moment. <words>105</words>
The box rattled, hinting that moments, like water, evaporate unless squeezed. <words>116</words>
To locate that moment, I entered the only bar still serving humidity, its sign a gargantuan billboard shaped like a tilting martini glass. <words>139</words>
Inside, the wooden bar top was battered enough to remember better centuries, and it sweated little rings that spread like concentric rumors. <words>161</words>
I could magnify those rings into planetary orbits by reading the water they held, a parlor trick my grandmother said would someday bill me for interest. <words>187</words>
Leaning closer, I watched dunes, breached pipelines, and garish plastic reefs swirl within the rings, a cautionary slideshow of environmental stewardship abandoned at intermission. <words>211</words>
Sarcasm molten enough to fry eggs rose in my throat: 'Lovely, the planet sends postcards, and humanity leaves them unread on the fridge.' <words>234</words>
The rings tightened into the shape of the puzzle box, then cracked apart, revealing thirteen faint pathways spiraling through the maze of billboards outside. <words>258</words>
I understood: each path aligned with a lock, and only environmental penance would loosen its mechanism. <words>274</words>
Cue more sarcasm—saving deserts one billboard at a time sounded about as plausible as training cacti to juggle rainclouds. <words>293</words>
Yet prophecy is stubborn, and so was I, so I dragged the bar's half-broken neon 'OPEN' sign into the night and followed the first glowing corridor. <words>319</words>
Every billboard I passed hummed advertisements until I rewired its solar panel to feed the desert's dormant seedlings instead, an act that clicked one lock open. <words>345</words>
Twelve locks remained, and my water-ring vision showed storms massing above each, promising enough rain to drown regret if I persisted. <words>366</words>
Lightning flashed across a billboard for luxury umbrellas, illuminating the timeframe in which I labored—somewhere between lost years and the dawn nobody had scheduled. <words>390</words>
I laughed, a sound gritty with sand and sarcasm, because destiny, like umbrellas, only opens under pressure. <words>407</words>
Clutching the lighter puzzle box, now warm as embered hope, I stepped deeper into the billboard labyrinth, ready to unlock the storm door of tomorrow. <words>432</words>
