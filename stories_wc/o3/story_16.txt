Steam coiled around bronze pistons while Jessa Rill slipped into the airship's engine room. <words>14</words>
The wedding above decks had ended, and silence hung like leftover confetti. <words>26</words>
She specialized in freelancing everything: cartography, cake-cutting, clandestine espionage, whatever coins permitted. <words>38</words>
Tonight, her commission was stranger: record the airship's dying heartbeat for a tome of elder wisdom. <words>54</words>
Captains believed old engines remembered, and memory made futures safer. <words>64</words>
Jessa adjusted an amber ring that glowed like bottled dusk on her thumb. <words>77</words>
The artifact supposedly trapped the last good intention ever forged aboard the vessel. <words>90</words>
Its warmth was inadvertently profound, stirring tender regrets she had never owned. <words>102</words>
Recording devices clicked, but valves jangled discordantly, threatening to drown the murmured mechanical lore. <words>116</words>
She needed to outwit the noise, the way poets outpace thunder. <words>127</words>
Remembering seaside childhood, she matched her breathing with the rhythm of waves against a cliff. <words>142</words>
The clanks softened, syncing to her pulse, creating scattered harmony within iron lungs. <words>155</words>
Now whispers seeped from boilers—stories of rusted oaths, salvaged screwdrivers, and forgiven mutinies. <words>168</words>
She scribbled everything, careful to keep sentences short, like elders conserving breath. <words>180</words>
Footsteps echoed outside; the groom, drunken and jealous, had followed her disappearances. <words>192</words>
He believed the ring was contraband treasure stolen from his new bride's dowry. <words>205</words>
Bursting in, he demanded surrender, startling gauges back into chaotic clangor. <words>216</words>
Jessa remembered her motivation: to chronicle elder wisdom, not to duel drunken novices. <words>229</words>
Still, survival helps any chronicle continue. <words>235</words>
She invited him to listen, pressing the ring to a riveted wall. <words>247</words>
Vibrations sang of commitment, sacrifice, and the fragile orchestra marriage attempts to conduct. <words>260</words>
The groom wept, realizing his suspicion had shattered the reception's lingering glow. <words>272</words>
That tearful pause became the engine's quietest instant, and Jessa captured it. <words>284</words>
She promised the humbled groom a footnote in the tome, a caution beneath poetry. <words>298</words>
Together they ascended to mourning moonlight, wedding sparklers long extinguished. <words>308</words>
Below, the engine resumed ordinary rattle, satisfied its last good intention had been heard. <words>322</words>
Hours later, Jessa poured ink over parchment in her rented gondola cabin. <words>334</words>
She wrote that wisdom sometimes masquerades as boiler hum waiting for brave translators. <words>347</words>
She noted how scattered harmony could realign broken promises, given attentive rhythm. <words>359</words>
She described her method—breathing with the rhythm of waves against a cliff—so others might hear. <words>374</words>
Finally, she credited the amber ring for teaching her to outwit impatience through empathy. <words>388</words>
The sky brightened, tinting clouds with brass, and her pages dried in gentle propeller breeze. <words>403</words>
Somewhere a new wedding would soon begin, ignorant of engines still echoing her inadvertently profound lullaby. <words>419</words>
Jessa smiled, knowing the chronicles were lighter because one more intention had found harbor. <words>433</words>
