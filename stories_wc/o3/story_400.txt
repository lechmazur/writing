The glacial orchard hung like a frozen chandelier above the endless crevasse of blue ice, groaning with every frigid breeze.<words>20</words>
Here, after the last human had set foot on earth, the guarded druid named Aelwyn kept reluctant watch.<words>38</words>
She was fiercely ambivalent toward the orchard, loving its silverleaf apples yet resenting the duty chaining her to emptiness.<words>57</words>
Though silence blanketed the sky like frost, tonight she intended to break it.<words>70</words>
Aelwyn's motivation was simple: overcome the crippling fear that speaking aloud would awaken ghosts of vanished cities.<words>87</words>
Tradition offered her a loophole, a ritual meal her family once prepared only on birthdays, a celebration that required conversation.<words>107</words>
If she could gather the ingredients and speak the blessing, perhaps no thunderbolt would strike, and fear would melt.<words>126</words>
So she climbed the crystalline ladders between branches, pockets clinking with a single dull safety pin—her last inheritance.<words>144</words>
The pin once fastened her mother's cloak; now it served as charm, clasp, and silent witness to solitary years.<words>163</words>
Silverleaf apples were easy, but birthday stew demanded thawfern leaves that sprouted only where ice sighed warm dreams.<words>181</words>
She traced a thermal fissure along the crevasse, hands trembling, voice still imprisoned behind her teeth.<words>197</words>
Steam plumed, and thawfern shimmered like tiny emerald sails; she plucked them while murmuring syllables too quiet to count.<words>216</words>
Back among the branches, she set a copper pan over a shardfire lamp and added snowmelt, fruit, and leaves.<words>235</words>
Sour fragrance drifted outward, tugging at memories of crowded tables, childish quarrels, and joking uncles with dour amusement in their eyes.<words>256</words>
Ambivalence pricked her; she missed them terribly yet relished the hush they left behind.<words>270</words>
When the stew finally simmered, she pinned her cloak with the dull safety pin and stood atop a frostbitten bough.<words>290</words>
The orchard creaked approval, or warning, she could not tell.<words>300</words>
Aelwyn inhaled the stew’s bittersweet steam, lifted her chin to the star-flecked void, and spoke the ancestral greeting.<words>318</words>
The first word sounded like cracking icicles; the second fluttered away like paper; the third, unexpectedly, laughed at her.<words>337</words>
She answered its laughter with her own, a dry rasp that felt stolen from someone braver.<words>353</words>
Nothing shattered, no ghosts rose, only the stew bubbled and the orchard swayed, oddly content.<words>368</words>
She served herself, whispering each ingredient’s name—apple, thawfern, snow, memory—until the silence around her felt companionable, domesticated.<words>385</words>
Fear shrank to a speck drifting over the crevasse, and the guarded druid let it fall.<words>401</words>
