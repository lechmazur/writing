Sparks danced like captive fireflies as Bramwell Forge, the jovial blacksmith of Grindleton, climbed the spiral ladder into Professor Loombe's attic. <words>21</words>
He whistled a tune whose notes leaped with precariously confident swagger, echoing among cobwebbed gears and half-finished contraptions. <words>39</words>
Outside, a departing train exhaled steam, and a gloved hand waved goodbye from its last sunlit window, marking the moment Bramwell had chosen. <words>62</words>
That wave reminded him time was a furnace that never cooled for anyone determined to prove darkness can be tamed. <words>82</words>
Professor Loombe, hunched over a brass metronome fixed to a clockwork heart, barely nodded, embodying fervent indifference to Bramwell's arrival. <words>102</words>
"One earring, sir," Bramwell said, producing a single earring forged from night-iron, black as coal yet shimmering with captive starlight. <words>122</words>
He claimed it would reverse shadows if wound, by the motion of a metronome, against the pulse of human fear. <words>142</words>
Loombe scoffed, his spectacles flashing like miniature moons, yet he allowed Bramwell to slot the earring onto the metronome's spindle. <words>162</words>
With each tick, the attic lamps flickered, and black rivulets of shadow flowed backward, climbing walls as though seeking lost masters. <words>183</words>
Bramwell endured the chilling spectacle, fingers blistering from earlier work, yet eyes bright as if attending his own wedding. <words>202</words>
He muttered that the human condition was little more than wresting melody from anvils, but today he would hammer silence itself. <words>223</words>
The train whistle shrieked through the skylight, its final wave fading, and Bramwell knew the demonstration's rhythm must match that shrinking distance. <words>245</words>
He set his own heartbeat to the ticking, letting precarious confidence steady his muscle and bone like tempered steel. <words>264</words>
Suddenly the earring hummed, casting inverted light that painted glowing silhouettes where darkness had stood, as though hope were negative film. <words>285</words>
Loombe's fervent indifference cracked; he lunged to snatch the device, but shadows snagged his coat, pleading like children for bedtime tales. <words>306</words>
Bramwell laughed, the jovial sound bobbing on the attic dust motes, yet his eyes measured every twitch in the metronome's hand. <words>327</words>
If the tempo faltered, darkness would surge, so he endured the blistering hum, forging resolve hotter than any smithy furnace. <words>347</words>
Tick by tick, the attic brightened until ordinary daylight seemed pale, and outside the train became a toy swallowed by horizon. <words>368</words>
Then, with a final confident clang of unseen hammer against fate, Bramwell removed the earring, pocketed it, and silence returned. <words>388</words>
Shadows behaved, coiled politely beneath tables, as though reminded of old chains, while Loombe caught his breath amid defeated instruments. <words>408</words>
Bramwell descended toward the street, sparks still in his beard, knowing light and darkness were both metals, and he had found their temper. <words>431</words>
