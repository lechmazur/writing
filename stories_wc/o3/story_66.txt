Galen Drift, a quiet deserter from the Ministry of Propaganda, arrived unnoticed at the greenhouse.<words>15</words>
The university listed it as a plant communication study, yet the vines whispered like guilty archivists.<words>31</words>
He sought refuge among their photosynthetic gossip, motivation flickering: to find a place where he truly belongs, even if nowhere.<words>51</words>
Noble foolishness buoyed him, as though exile could sprout roots in stolen soil.<words>64</words>
Professor Mycelius, dizzyingly grounded despite her vertigo, supervised experiments with cracked mirror panels reflecting leaves' electrical murmurs.<words>81</words>
She believed light refracted through damage let plants read human regret.<words>92</words>
Galen volunteered to clean shards, obliged to silence by habit and by allegiance severed.<words>106</words>
Each fragment caught his face in impossible angles, reminding him of the fractured orders he fled.<words>122</words>
While gathering pieces, he discovered porcelain masks shattered inside a dusty chest labelled 'Discarded Results'.<words>137</words>
Mycelius confessed they once mapped emotions onto glaze, watching plants react to every crack of identity.<words>153</words>
Funding ran dry, so hopes, like masks, were broken and quietly stored away.<words>166</words>
Galen felt kinship with those porcelain visages; both were deserters from their own narratives.<words>180</words>
That night he reconstructed stories from shattered porcelain masks, arranging them like constellations across the greenhouse table.<words>197</words>
Every mask received a whispered biography, coauthored by the vines that twined through glass vents.<words>212</words>
He documented each tale onto jigsaw puzzles, sliding pieces into frames so time itself felt interlocking.<words>228</words>
Throughout jigsaw puzzles, the masks' memories coaxed the plants into pulsing rhythms of empathy.<words>242</words>
Oscilloscope leaves displayed heartlike spikes whenever Galen spoke of avoidance and belonging.<words>254</words>
Mycelius measured the data, declaring the deserter a better transmitter than any electrode.<words>267</words>
Yet the Ministry tracked carbon signatures, and his flight risk burned brighter than chlorophyll.<words>281</words>
To sever surveillance, Galen planned to carbonize his military ID within the greenhouse kiln.<words>295</words>
The kiln, once used for ceramic sensors, now roared like a dragon craving treason.<words>309</words>
He fed the documents, then added one porcelain mask that still mirrored his hesitation.<words>323</words>
Flames licked glaze, cracks fusing into obsidian scars, cycle of obedience breaking in molten silence.<words>338</words>
The plants emitted a sudden burst of oxygen, as if applauding carbon's liberation.<words>351</words>
Mirrors fogged, and Galen watched his reflection vanish behind chlorophyll mist, dizzyingly grounded in invisibility.<words>366</words>
He realized belonging might be motion itself, a puzzle eternally rearranged, never complete.<words>379</words>
Carrying only the kiln's blackened shards, he stepped into night, vines telegraphing farewell through crackling leaves.<words>395</words>
Somewhere beyond pursuit, he would keep reconstructing stories, breaking new cycles before they hardened.<words>409</words>
