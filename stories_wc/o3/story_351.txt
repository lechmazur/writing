Moonlight sieved through broken rafters as I stepped onto the platform of the disused railway station overgrown with ivy. <words>19</words>
The air tasted like stories that had missed their trains. <words>29</words>
I, a dreamy poet with a formally rebellious heart, carried a brass sundial wrapped in velvet. <words>45</words>
The sundial's gnomon quivered like a compass needle searching for lost noon. <words>57</words>
I had come after the last riddle was solved, drawn by the promise hidden in an unopened letter. <words>75</words>
Its crimson wax seal bore cryptic shapes that seemed to compel my footsteps more fiercely than hunger. <words>92</words>
Triangles nested inside spirals, circles broken by lines, a grammar of silence spelling my name. <words>107</words>
The platform clock, forever stalled at 3:11, ticked in my imagination only, urging haste. <words>121</words>
I laid the sundial on a mossy bench and felt night condense into a single shadow pointing north. <words>139</words>
Somewhere beneath the ivy, rails whispered of passengers whose names the world no longer bothered to pronounce. <words>156</words>
They were the unremembered, and I had vowed to stand by them even if no monument would. <words>173</words>
Opening the letter would be the delicate undoing of their erasure, the untying of a knot built from forgetting. <words>192</words>
Still, I hesitated, hearing the doctrine of rebellion my tutors had stitched into my cuffs. <words>207</words>
Rules can cage tenderness, they warned, but also preserve it from reckless touch. <words>220</words>
I breathed, and the sundial answered with a tremor that scattered moonlight like mercury. <words>234</words>
Its shadow now pointed toward a waiting-room door swollen shut by decades of rain. <words>248</words>
I pressed the letter against the warped wood, aligning the wax shapes with ancient graffiti carved by a brakeman. <words>267</words>
A hush fell, broken only when the door sighed open, surrendering a gust that smelled of coal and lilacs. <words>286</words>
Inside, forgotten suitcases formed cryptic constellations upon the floor, each tagged with initials nobody claimed. <words>301</words>
I placed the sundial at the room's center, letting its brass skin drink the ghostly draught. <words>317</words>
Numbers flared along its rim, not hours but years, and the gnomon cast thirteen overlapping shadows. <words>333</words>
The suitcases clicked open in answer, exhaling letters, diaries, and tarnished medals onto the dusty tiles. <words>349</words>
Every artifact murmured a name, and the platform outside began to ripple like paper touched by ink. <words>366</words>
I felt the letter heat in my palm, its seal melting without fracture, releasing no sheet but a breath of gratitude. <words>387</words>
That breath entered me, and suddenly the unremembered stood around, transparent yet adorned with color memory had stolen. <words>405</words>
They compelled no pledge, only smiled as if my presence finished a stanza they had waited decades to hear. <words>424</words>
The delicate undoing was complete: erasure unraveled, rebellion formalized into care, and night itself paused to witness. <words>441</words>
I closed the door behind me, leaving the sundial to keep their hours, and walked away before dawn asked questions. <words>461</words>
