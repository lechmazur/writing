Denton Crick specialized in being someone else’s body on fire, yet panicked at candlelight. <words>14</words>
A phobia-ridden stunt double, he hid behind rubber masks while dreading the touch of latex. <words>29</words>
All his weekends vanished throughout garage sales where he searched for talismans to fend off new terrors. <words>46</words>
One blistering July, he opened a basic envelope bought for a nickel and found coordinates in faded ink. <words>64</words>
The numbers lured him to an abandoned pyramid sunk beneath Nevada sand, rumored to house a forgotten library. <words>82</words>
Numb fascination replaced fear, and he felt mundanely spiritual, like reciting tax codes as incantations. <words>97</words>
Inside, dusty papyrus shelves formed aisles echoing in the dark, each rustle suggesting applause for unseen athletes. <words>114</words>
Denton imagined stunts he had never dared, performed by ghosts whose bones still remembered impact. <words>129</words>
Motivated to dance on the edge of madness, he ventured deeper, trailing lantern light like a lifeline. <words>146</words>
At the pyramid’s heart hung a centuries‑old fisherman’s net, impossibly draped over a stone lectern. <words>161</words>
Every knot glistened with tar and hieroglyphs, binding scrolls tighter than any stunt harness he’d worn. <words>177</words>
Training kicked in: unraveling knots was like loosening wires before a high fall, only older, holier. <words>193</words>
He worked hours, fingers blistering, hearing distant echoes in the dark grow louder with each loosened twist. <words>210</words>
When the final knot slipped, the net collapsed, and the library exhaled a gust that extinguished his lantern. <words>228</words>
Total blackness should have triggered every phobia, yet Denton stood calm, listening to the newly freed silence. <words>245</words>
Then whispers, soft but rising, merged into one resonant wordless triumph reverberating through marrow and sandstone alike. <words>262</words>
The echoes in the dark were no longer memory but invitation, choreographing steps he had never studied. <words>279</words>
He danced, fingers smeared with tar, feet sliding on scroll fragments that mapped impossible stunt sequences. <words>295</words>
Each movement dissolved another lifelong fear, trading it for a meticulous emptiness, a professionally measured void. <words>311</words>
Outside the pyramid, dawn arrived and receded, yet inside time folded like a stunt pad cushioning eternity. <words>328</words>
How long he danced he never knew; he stopped only when dust settled back onto his shoulders. <words>345</words>
In the lectern’s hollow lay a single page bearing his own stunt résumé written centuries before his birth. <words>363</words>
The handwriting matched the envelope’s, suggesting whoever mailed it trusted his capacity for sacramental recklessness. <words>378</words>
With numb fascination he folded the page, slipped it into his jacket, and ascended toward the desert glare. <words>396</words>
Garage sales awaited again, but now he would browse tables as a man who had practiced eternity. <words>413</words>
Fear might return, yet he carried the dark’s echoes inside him, neatly coiled like retired safety ropes. <words>430</words>
And when needed, he would unravel them, knot by knot, until the mundane world surrendered its gravity. <words>447</words>
