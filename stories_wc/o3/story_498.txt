Frost breathed against the boarded windows of Ardent Alley, sealing the xenophobic enclave in brittle silence.<words>16</words>
Inside an abandoned conservatory, Dorian Quell, a nervous kingpin with shaking fingertips, rechecked his meager empire.<words>32</words>
He had trafficked nothing harsher than hope, siphoning seeds and stories between neighborhoods that refused to touch.<words>49</words>
Tonight the hope felt thin, almost brittle enough to shatter with the cold.<words>62</words>
A collection of dried seed pods rattled in his satchel like skeletal maracas, daring him to keep moving.<words>80</words>
They were destined for the covert communal gardens sprouting beneath storm drains, lanterned by stolen bulbs.<words>96</words>
If the enclave learned about the greenery, their fear of outsiders would scorch every root.<words>111</words>
So Dorian moved with fragile ferocity, a glass blade swung by an earthquake.<words>124</words>
Out on the frostbitten boulevard, he saw a rusted government sign pointing twelve kilometers to Lantern Cliff.<words>141</words>
The landmark meant nothing to his route, yet an unlikely probable strategy flickered in his mind.<words>157</words>
A detour to visit a landmark seen on a sign could unsettle any patrol tracing predictable footsteps.<words>174</words>
He veered north, boots crunching, clutching the satchel as though the pods were newborns.<words>188</words>
Wind tunneled through alleys like whispered interrogations, asking why one man fought national apathy alone.<words>203</words>
"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference," he muttered, repeating the oath carved behind his eyelids.<words>221</words>
The words steadied him more than the pistol frosting inside his coat.<words>233</words>
Snow thickened into needles, sewing a white shroud over abandoned kiosks and rumor-stained billboards.<words>247</words>
By dawn-grey, Lantern Cliff emerged, a basalt tower craning above frozen surf, its summit crowned with a dead beacon.<words>266</words>
No guards waited; the enclave feared the ocean's yawning otherness too much to post sentries here.<words>282</words>
Inside the beacon's iron ribs, Dorian buried the seed pods in a basin of thawing gull guano.<words>299</words>
Salt and nutrients would wake them when the vernal sun returned, broadcasting color toward the enclave below.<words>316</words>
He imagined neighbors seeing the cliff bloom scarlet and gold, forced to question who had gifted such defiance.<words>334</words>
Perhaps curiosity, that cousin of mercy, would sprout next.<words>343</words>
The thought warmed him more than the threadbare scarf strangling his breaths.<words>355</words>
He left the beacon and traced a new circle back toward Ardent Alley, footsteps light despite the cold.<words>373</words>
Somewhere behind him, gulls shrieked, and he liked to pretend they were cheering.<words>386</words>
Through the restless hush of midwinter he carried the echo, a fragile ferocity that refused to break.<words>403</words>
