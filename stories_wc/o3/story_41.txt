Grease still clung to Orion Vega's factory overalls, yet galaxies pulsed beneath his fingernails like restless sparks.<words>17</words>
He had hidden those cosmic powers for years, compressing supernovas into silence between stamping machines.<words>32</words>
Tonight, everything would change at the end of a corridor no one dares walk.<words>46</words>
The corridor terminated in a gargoyle-guarded terrace over a bottomless abyss, humming with disciplined chaos.<words>61</words>
Orion liked that contradiction, an emblem of the ordered disarray ruling his entire bloodline.<words>75</words>
Each equinox, his family performed a unique ritual there, binding generations with questions and starlight.<words>90</words>
They called it the Review, because elders and infants alike examined their lives as scholars examine theses.<words>107</words>
Academically wild, the process rewarded brave hypotheses, punished plagiarized destinies, and applauded revisions written in nebulae.<words>123</words>
Participants wore a plain cameo brooch carved from meteorite dust, symbolizing humility before cosmic possibility.<words>138</words>
Tonight, that modest pin weighed on Orion like a small planet, reminding him of cramped expectations.<words>154</words>
Management wanted the obedient press-operator, not the living constellation who might abandon quotas for quasars.<words>169</words>
Even relatives whispered that safety followed the conveyor belt and danger followed dreams.<words>182</words>
Orion stepped onto the terrace, gargoyles glaring as if sculpted from suppressed ambitions.<words>195</words>
He pinned the cameo to his chest, its gray cameo profile reflecting unfamiliar constellations swirling inside him.<words>212</words>
Elders formed a semicircle, their brooches dull yet demanded honesty sharper than broken gears.<words>226</words>
First question, croaked Grandmother Lyra, was simple: Why do you wish to break free tonight?<words>241</words>
Orion inhaled furnace air and answered, To disregard the footprints left by doubt across my sky.<words>257</words>
The gargoyles shifted, stones grinding approval, as the abyss below exhaled a distant comet's tail.<words>272</words>
Next, the ritual demanded proof, so Orion extended his grease-stained hands above the void.<words>286</words>
Stars erupted from his palms, arranging themselves into assembly-line diagrams that then rearranged into soaring spirals.<words>302</words>
He showed them how a bolt could become a meteor, how a schedule could become a sunrise.<words>319</words>
The elders, academically wild at heart despite brittle knees, murmured equations no textbook had printed.<words>334</words>
Grandmother tapped her brooch, converting it into a tiny orbiting ring, a sign of acceptance.<words>349</words>
Yet the final clause of the Review required Orion to choose: remain employed or explore infinity.<words>365</words>
He stared back toward the unlit corridor, smelling oil, hearing doubts marching like steel boots.<words>380</words>
Then he faced the abyss and stepped forward, footprints of doubt dissolving behind him into stardust.<words>396</words>
Gargoyles bowed, elders cheered, and Orion Vega finally exceeded the blueprints others had drafted for him.<words>412</words>
Somewhere far below, the factory alarms rang, but their timbre sounded like fading lullabies to stars.<words>428</words>
From that moment, the family ritual gained a new stanza about grease, gargoyles, and unshackled galaxies.<words>444</words>
And every equinox after, apprentices approached the terrace eager to review possibility rather than production quotas.<words>460</words>
They wore plain cameo brooches, yes, but their eyes glittered with the limitless order of disarray.<words>476</words>
