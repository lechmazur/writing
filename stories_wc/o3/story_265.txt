<story>
The service bay of Saint Boniface was a lush orchard spanning the rafters of an abandoned cathedral. <words>17</words>
Cherry branches threaded between hydraulic lifts where engines dripped warm hymns. <words>28</words>
Deputy Mara Quinn stood impassive beneath them, personally impersonal even to the sap that glossed her badge. <words>45</words>
She claimed the nightly shift during oil changes, recording plate numbers while the mechanics prayed to torque wrenches. <words>63</words>
Yet her true vigil was to witness a moment of pure grace blooming amid machinery. <words>78</words>
The cathedral's feral bees escorted that possibility, humming with the secret language of bees. <words>92</words>
Mara kept a twisted twist tie folded around her finger like a question mark. <words>106</words>
It was all that remained from evidence locker eleven, where a vanished choirboy's hymnbook once rattled. <words>122</words>
Whenever she touched the metal coil, uncharted echoes lurched through the nave like whales under cracked ice. <words>139</words>
Tonight, head mechanic Luis signaled that an ancient pickup was ready to stretch its tired oil sinews. <words>156</words>
As the crank spun, the orchard trembled, cherries quivering like censers tilting before invisible saints. <words>171</words>
Bees formed a moving spiral, scripting warnings in air that only Mara's guarded heart deciphered. <words>186</words>
With cautious bravery she stepped onto the lift, rising toward the rafters where the orchard turned wild. <words>203</words>
Up there, oil mist and pollen mingled into a dusk, and the choirboy's voice surfaced inside the uncharted echoes. <words>222</words>
He did not accuse; he simply sang one perfect note that made every cherry pit hum in sympathy. <words>240</words>
The bees translated the note into light, each wing a flickering glyph spelling forgive. <words>254</words>
Mara felt the twisted twist tie unknot, metal softening as though the song annealed it to blossom. <words>271</words>
She answered not with words but by lowering her pistol, letting it hang like a wilted fruit. <words>288</words>
That stillness, balanced between gasoline and nectar, was the moment of pure grace she had awaited. <words>304</words>
Slowly the note faded, and the rafters released a sigh like tires settling onto pavement. <words>319</words>
Below, Luis whistled for her logs, unaware of the choir in the orchard or her small revolt. <words>336</words>
She descended, personally impersonal again, but a single bee rode her shoulder like a living badge. <words>352</words>
She slid the now-straight wire into her notebook, evidence of what cannot be filed or denied. <words>368</words>
Engines roared, lifts lowered, and cherries dusted the floor like tiny lanterns extinguished at matins. <words>383</words>
Though the day would file reports and receipts, the night had filed her spirit under fulfilled, not lost. <words>401</words>
