It was after the last drop of oil was extracted when Yuan-Li crossed the cracked moat to the reimagined ancient Chinese palace carved from recycled freighters.<words>26</words>
He was famed as a chameleon stage actor, yet tonight even his skin palettes flickered with anxious serenity.<words>44</words>
The solar lamps failed, so slanted shards of sunlight through debris in the collapsed roof painted nervous lattices across the jade floor.<words>66</words>
Yuan-Li came not to perform but to investigate the palace archives, because to reproduce theatre itself depended on reviving forgotten truths.<words>87</words>
His method, rationally impulsive, was to solve cold-case mysteries hidden in stage props, and weave their answers into the illusions he would later project.<words>111</words>
Tonight a neglected wing held the evidence he sought: a tattered doll’s dress folded beside a rusted mirror framed with phoenix feathers.<words>133</words>
Palace legends claimed the dress belonged to Princess Yaoguang’s secret daughter, whose disappearance extinguished the dynasty’s final torch centuries before petrochemical collapse.<words>155</words>
If Yuan-Li could uncover the child’s fate, he would restore emotional honesty to tomorrow’s illusions and justify his restless gift of mimicry.<words>177</words>
He pressed the dress to his cheek and, in the mirror, pigments on his skin shifted into the hue of antique brocade, guiding his intuition.<words>202</words>
The reflection blurred, revealing schematics of palace tunnels, so he sprinted down corridors where rat skeletons glinted like ivory actors awaiting cues.<words>224</words>
Under the throne room he found a stone door sealed by lacquer and sorrow, which yielded when he recited the princess’s favorite rehearsal warm‑up.<words>248</words>
Inside lay scrolls documenting a coup that blamed the child for an eclipse, ordering her silencing and scattering servants like splinters of abandoned scenery.<words>272</words>
The scrolls also recorded a survivor troupe that smuggled the girl west, vowing that their lineage would reproduce palace rites until truth resurfaced.<words>295</words>
Realizing he might be their descendant, Yuan-Li felt history coil inside him like a spring, ready to release on the stage’s next breath.<words>318</words>
Yet anxious serenity settled, for rational impulse warned that unveiling the secret could ignite factions now powering the empire’s last solar grids.<words>340</words>
He decided to encode the revelation within tomorrow’s performance, letting audiences solve the mystery themselves, the way sunlight through debris writes patterns only open eyes can read.<words>367</words>
Carrying the tattered doll’s dress as both evidence and costume, he climbed back toward the marble stage, rehearsing tones that would imitate a mother’s lullaby and a judge’s gavel in the same trembling breath.<words>401</words>
He knew the palace, now powered by waning sunlight, would hush when he spoke, and within that hush the lost child’s spirit might finally reproduce hope.<words>427</words>
Yuan-Li stepped into the beams, skin shifting from jade to violet to ghost-white, and the audience gasped, feeling the fragile honesty he had vowed to weave into illusion.<words>455</words>
Somewhere beneath the applause, a hidden door clicked open, proving the story already worked, and Yuan-Li smiled with anxious serenity as the next mystery beckoned.<words>480</words>
