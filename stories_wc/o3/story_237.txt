When the last star faded into morning light, Dr. Helix Quill, proudly humble psychic genealogist, awoke shackled in the brig of the space pirate dreadnought Grin-of-Gravity. <words>26</words>
His mind, still echoing with ancestral whispers, sensed destiny rattling like a pair of dice, one chipped from ages of secret rolls. <words>48</words>
The pirates wanted him to predict which future solar caravans they should raid, but Helix had boarded their ship for a deeper reason. <words>71</words>
He sought to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak haunting Captain Salvara, whose laughter hid the crack of a collapsed romance. <words>92</words>
Unless that wound healed, the captain would continue carving the galaxy for loot instead of mercy. <words>108</words>
Helix’s plan depended on lengthening her lineage, revealing forgotten bonds that could tame her grief. <words>123</words>
He had researched her bloodline via diaries left on abandoned bullet trains that once rocketed refugees across asteroid archipelagos. <words>142</words>
Those diaries whispered of a living descendant—Mirel, an itinerant poet—orbiting the same nebula their ship now skirted. <words>159</words>
If Salvara learned her heartbreak was shared, not solitary, perhaps she would trade plunder for reunion. <words>175</words>
But first, Helix needed to escape the brig and reach the comms array before the pirates’ breakfast mutiny concluded. <words>194</words>
He closed his eyes and followed psychic threads backward through Salvara’s ancestry until they converged on a childhood memory of board games. <words>216</words>
With grave playfulness, he projected that memory into the guard’s mind: a kitchen table, cocoa steam, and the jingle of dice. <words>237</words>
The guard, suddenly nostalgic, unlocked the cell so Helix could join the imagined family supper he believed was real. <words>256</words>
Helix slipped past, palm closing around the chipped die he had earlier planted near the doorway as a mnemonic omen. <words>276</words>
He rolled it down the corridor; each bounce guided him, the psychic vibrations mapping probabilities faster than star charts. <words>295</words>
At the comms panel, he spliced in the diaries’ coordinates and broadcast a poem only Mirel would recognize: 'Row of bullets, row of blooms.' <words>319</words>
Across the nebula, Mirel’s skiff answered, a soft chime that pulsed through the ship like hope wearing mischief’s grin. <words>338</words>
Salvara stormed onto the bridge to silence unauthorized transmissions, but Helix met her with the dice cupped between steady hands. <words>358</words>
'Captain,' he said, 'your destiny is no raid—it’s a riddle longing for its other half,' and he opened his palms to reveal one chipped die and one whole. <words>386</words>
The puzzle of destiny clicked inside her like gears finding grease, and the brig lights flickered from red to soft amber. <words>407</words>
In that tinted glow, Salvara ordered the pirates to chart a rendezvous with Mirel instead of plundering the caravans, exchanging certainty for possibility. <words>430</words>
Helix smiled, proudly humble, as the chipped die settled showing two ones—snake eyes that, paradoxically, promised a pair no longer alone. <words>451</words>
Somewhere beyond the viewport, the last star truly faded, yet morning light now lengthened aboard the pirate ship, filling every shadow with new ancestry. <words>475</words>
