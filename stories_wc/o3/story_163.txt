<story>
Marisol Vance, the lost heiress of a vanished orbital dynasty, arrived unannounced.<words>12</words>
She stepped onto the glass ramp of the remote xenobiology research station.<words>24</words>
The station floated above desert plateaus where colossal organisms migrated like restless continents.<words>37</words>
Clouds too migrated, layer upon layer, casting drifting cities of shadow below.<words>49</words>
It was said the clouds murmured algebra at twilight; Marisol meant to listen.<words>62</words>
Her motivation, whispered to no one, was to push the limits of possibility.<words>75</words>
She carried a single keepsake: an old parking stub faded to pale indigo.<words>88</words>
Its timestamp marked the moment her family limousine disappeared with everything she loved.<words>101</words>
Holding it, she felt the world flicker, a fragmented reality stitched with aching seams.<words>115</words>
Marisol was bitterly optimistic, convinced despair could be retooled into aerodynamic ambition.<words>127</words>
Dr. Kesh, chief exobiologist, watched her sign the visitor ledger with reckless precision.<words>140</words>
He asked why an heiress sought beasts that secreted weather instead of milk.<words>153</words>
She answered, "Because your beasts rearrange horizons, and I need a new one."<words>166</words>
Permission granted, she joined a survey team studying the annual cloud migration phenomenon.<words>179</words>
They departed at dawn, but a traffic jam of crawler tractors clogged the service road.<words>194</words>
Marisol suggested a detour to avoid traffic, leading them up an uncharted escarpment.<words>207</words>
The trail terminated at a scenic overlook where sky and desert blurred deliciously.<words>220</words>
There, gravitational eddies twisted light, and every second image of Marisol lagged behind.<words>233</words>
Reality had fragmented further, shards spinning like butterflies that forgot their bodies.<words>245</words>
The team panicked, instruments warping, but she felt the parking stub hum warmly.<words>258</words>
Ink on the paper rearranged into coordinates and a single imperative: unify.<words>270</words>
Marisol realized the stub preserved the last coherent timestamp of her personal timeline.<words>283</words>
If she matched station chronometers to that timestamp, realities might quilt themselves whole.<words>296</words>
Dr. Kesh screamed about protocol, yet her bitter optimism cut through his caution.<words>309</words>
With reckless precision she recalibrated the portable time-lidar, locking onto the stub's frequency.<words>322</words>
Clouds overhead paused mid-migration, their bellies glowing as if backlit by newborn suns.<words>335</words>
Desert creatures chorused, and the lagging images of her body snapped into alignment.<words>348</words>
The overlook became a hinge; horizons swung shut, sealing the fractures with thunder.<words>361</words>
Where chaos had reigned, a single, clarified vista now stretched, serene and terrifying.<words>374</words>
Marisol exhaled, tasting electricity, knowing her reckless detour had literally unified worlds.<words>386</words>
Yet possibility still beckoned, so she slid the parking stub back into her pocket.<words>400</words>
Someday, she promised, this ticket would punch open even broader corridors of becoming.<words>413</words>
For an heiress once lost, the universe had just become payable on demand.<words>426</words>
