Illuminated by a flickering candle, I clambered onto the dusty plank that served as the lowest shelf of the giant's bookshelf, my boots smaller than the nail heads beside me. <words>30</words>
I, the itinerant obituary-writer who inscribes futures before they harden into pasts, had come seeking the mask rumored to contain the last breath of true performance. <words>56</words>
Whispers of revolution rattled through the wood grain, turning every creak of the colossal shelves into a potential battle drum. <words>76</words>
But rebellious always, I refused to wait for history; I intended to manifest legend myself. <words>91</words>
The theater mask lay three stories above, its marble surface said to change expression whenever a destiny tilted. <words>109</words>
Only a labyrinth of choices, carved like marginalia between towering tomes, guarded the climb. <words>123</words>
Each fork--paper bridge or rope ladder, riddle door or echo tunnel--promised either rising insight or fatal slip. <words>140</words>
I wrote provisional obituaries for myself at every junction, testing which death paragraph felt prematurely hollow. <words>156</words>
The hollower the script, the truer the path; that was one trick I learned interviewing the living about their endings. <words>176</words>
Midway, I discovered a hidden pipe organ chamber tucked into the spine of a dictionary so massive it defined worlds. <words>196</words>
The keys were fashioned from bleached bookmarks, and when I pressed them, a humming resonance swirled through the hollow shelves like warm wind in a cathedral. <words>222</words>
Guided by instinct and rebellion, I played a chord forbidden by the old conservatories, letting the notes manifest a staircase of vibrating light. <words>245</words>
Each shimmer solidified beneath my feet, answering the labyrinth with music rather than caution. <words>259</words>
At the summit shelf, the mask awaited, its face shifting from tragedy to mischief as if trying on motives. <words>278</words>
I addressed it like an unruly actor: 'I need your talent to restore the vanished art of living theater before revolt replaces dialogue with gunpowder.' <words>303</words>
The mask flexed, empathy blooming across its cheeks, then hardened into a rebellious grin mirroring my own. <words>320</words>
A final thunderous chord thundered-echoing rebellion through the organ pipes-and the rumors outside condensed into a roar of marching feet. <words>340</words>
Yet the resonance also birthed silence, a calm pocket in which the giant himself paused mid-page-turn, listening like a mountain that secretly loves birdsong. <words>364</words>
In that hush, the mask slid over my face, cool as snow and hot as applause, and I felt centuries of playwrights breathe through me. <words>389</words>
My rebellion ceased being personal; it became technique, a restored craft manifesting through every pore, ready to redirect the revolution toward creative crescendo rather than collapse. <words>415</words>
So I descended the luminous staircase, obituary pages fluttering behind me like liberated doves, prepared to perform life itself before the crowd sharpened by unrest. <words>440</words>
On the first plank, where the candle still trembled, I took my opening bow, and the giant's vast library inhaled, audience and stage at once. <words>465</words>
The revolution, hearing art stir through timber and heart, hesitated long enough for possibility to breathe. <words>481</words>
That single breath, strange and melodic, was the obituary I never had to finish. <words>495</words>
