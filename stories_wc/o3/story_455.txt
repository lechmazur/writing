<story>
Thorn Mallory, a disgruntled wishing‑well attendant, closed the fairground stall for the night and pocketed his broom‑worn gloves.<words>18</words>
The carnival lights dimmed, revealing a doorway hidden behind the well, rumored to be a secret agent escape route.<words>37</words>
Thorn exhaled slowly, his posture paradoxically intensely relaxed despite the crackling resentment that usually kinked his shoulders.<words>54</words>
Tonight he felt summoned toward that door by a hush older than the fairground, an inherited mystery whispering promised replies.<words>74</words>
He carried with him a velvet pouch, his secret collection of foreign coins thrown all year by tourists into the well.<words>95</words>
Each coin bore scratches, dents, tiny planets of pain; Thorn believed their pitted surfaces understood the weight of scars.<words>114</words>
He wanted to trade that weight for answers, to out‑face the silent judgments of old ghosts swirling beneath his memories.<words>134</words>
Stepping through the doorway, he entered a narrow corridor where phosphorescent arrows only became visible by following shadow patterns on the wall.<words>156</words>
The arrows curved, merging like tributaries, until they formed a crossroad at the crossing of two unwritten paths.<words>174</words>
There, a brass lectern awaited, inscribed with instructions Thorn barely deciphered from spy‑craft manuals he once stole to warm cold winters.<words>195</words>
The lectern demanded he corroborate his purpose by offering proof no government could forge: a story only his scars could tell.<words>216</words>
He poured the foreign coins onto the lectern, their clinks echoing like distant Morse, each clang a chapter of displaced sorrow.<words>237</words>
Shadows rearranged themselves, corroborating his testimony; walls slid aside, revealing an iron bridge suspended over a shaft of revolving constellations.<words>257</words>
As Thorn crossed, he felt the bridge vibrate with the restless tally of every wish he ever failed to grant.<words>277</words>
Halfway across, a gust rose from the chasm, spelling accusations in grit, voices of children and lovers whose coins he had pocketed.<words>299</words>
He stood, intensely relaxed again, not in indifference but in surrender, letting the wind read every welt on his conscience.<words>319</words>
When the gale calmed, a single doorway flickered ahead, and his pouch lay empty, the coins now orbiting like lanterns behind him.<words>341</words>
He realized the route was never for spies but for penitent keepers, people whose lives hinged on other people's tossed hopes.<words>362</words>
Under the doorway's arch, Thorn whispered an oath to guard wishes instead of stealing them, a vow heavy yet strangely feathered.<words>383</words>
Behind him, the shadows closed, sealing the escape route, and the ghosts receded, having witnessed a man finally carrying his scars upright.<words>405</words>
