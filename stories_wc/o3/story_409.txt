Dust drifted like sleepy snowflakes around the bruised fighter as he climbed the ladder into the attic where the clockwork animals ticked in perpetual twilight.<words>25</words>
Each brass beast paused, gears catching the afternoon silence, acknowledging his arrival as if sensing that history pivoted on an unseen hinge.<words>47</words>
He carried nothing but a clay pot shard with an inscription rubbed raw by years of pocketed penance.<words>65</words>
The fragment read, 'Stand, or all falls,' words that had once belonged to a temple now buried beneath market stalls and excuses.<words>87</words>
He was skillfully incompetent: every punch sloppy yet lucky, every gamble reckless yet strangely guided—as though fate enjoyed his crooked form.<words>108</words>
Tonight, that paradox would earn him passage through forgotten dreams.<words>118</words>
He knelt beside a fox fashioned from copper springs, pressed the shard against its winding key, and let his eyelids close.<words>139</words>
At the exact moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble—somewhere far below—his pulse synchronized with a thunderous internal gong.<words>158</words>
The attic blurred, reassembling as a corridor of night-smudged mirrors where earlier versions of himself paced in cages of shifting light.<words>179</words>
From behind each mirror, a hand reached, begging to be abducted from complacency.<words>192</words>
He understood the ransom: extinguish the last vestige of self-deception or forever fracture into reflections with no original.<words>210</words>
The fighter raised the shard like a judge’s gavel and shattered the nearest pane, glass shrinking into salt between his knuckles.<words>231</words>
A clockwork wolf sprang through the breach, jaws clacking metronome rhythms that matched his heartbeat, guarding him from the swirl of false faces.<words>254</words>
Together they marched, mirror by mirror, freeing the imprisoned selves only to watch them dissolve into smoke once their lies were named aloud.<words>277</words>
When the corridor ended, a single door remained, carved from marble still echoing the sculptor’s first strike, its surface whimpering with half-born possibility.<words>300</words>
He knew his hardest opponent waited inside: the version that could rationalize surrender with scholarly footnotes and parental sighs.<words>319</words>
Opening the door felt like peeling off scabs with violin strings, yet he stepped through, wolf at heel, shard raised.<words>339</words>
The chamber held a throne of dust and certificates, and atop it lounged his smug twin, skin unbruised, voice rehearsed.<words>359</words>
'You stand for nothing,' the twin purred, 'so kneel and rest,' but the fighter pressed the shard to his own chest instead, carving the inscription into living flesh.<words>387</words>
Pain rang like bells, and the twin evaporated, unable to survive the proof of conviction etched in blood.<words>405</words>
The corridor, the wolf, and the mirrors folded into the shard, leaving him back in the dusty attic, kneeling among still statues.<words>427</words>
Gears resumed their chatter, but now they beat the tempo of a heart that finally stood for something, even if bruised beyond repair.<words>450</words>
