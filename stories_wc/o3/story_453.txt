<story>
The snow globe township glitters beneath a hollow glass sky too small for storms.<words>14</words>
Yet the residents insist the cosmos exists elsewhere, and tonight, amid star gazing, they prove it.<words>30</words>
They forward the telescope crank until constellations sweep like clock hands across the inner dome.<words>45</words>
Into this ritual wanders Ifras, the foolhardy ranger with pine sap in his hair.<words>59</words>
He has returned from the outer ring forests bearing a cracked plastic cup lid like treasure.<words>75</words>
The lid is wider than any snowflake and gleams with forbidden, monstrous scale.<words>88</words>
Ifras, steadily creative despite perpetual scrapes, claims it fell from a sky we cannot perceive.<words>103</words>
He seeks to interpret the object's ridges as phonetic runes, the first lesson of wind speech.<words>119</words>
Because his motivation, repeated like prayer, is to learn the language of the wind and the waves.<words>136</words>
The township council listens from the parapet of a porcelain lighthouse embedded near the globe's equator.<words>152</words>
Their chairwoman, whose breath forever fogs in winter, issues a decree recorded on brittle acetate rolls.<words>168</words>
She forbids Ifras from scaling the spiral snowbanks again, fearing he will crack the world.<words>183</words>
Her ruling arrives to us through unreleased confessional tapes smuggled out by the chapel projectionist.<words>198</words>
Hear her voice, detached devotion, telling microphones she loves the ranger more than stasis.<words>212</words>
Yet she obeys the doctrine that seasonal changes are the only permitted form of transformation here.<words>228</words>
Spring rattles the globe with pastel confetti, summer floods it with firefly motes, autumn dims nothing.<words>244</words>
Only winter, eternal, restores the familiar glitter we are sculpted to endure.<words>256</words>
Ifras argues that speaking with winds could guide smoother transitions, sparing seedlings from shock.<words>270</words>
He slices the plastic lid into crescent sigils, lays them on the observatory deck like tiles.<words>286</words>
Each fragment whistles when the night wind funnels through ventilation cracks we thought decorative.<words>300</words>
The notes rise, converge, and suddenly the snow globe hums with distant shoreline cadence.<words>314</words>
We hear surf we have never seen, as though shells press against our miniature ears.<words>329</words>
The council convenes again, shaken, playing the confessional tapes backward for guidance.<words>341</words>
Reversed, the chairwoman's decree becomes plea: 'If he must go, let the globe go with him.'<words>357</words>
At dawn, the ranger ascends the lighthouse, pocket compass sputtering from magnetic snow.<words>370</words>
He gathers seasonal confetti into the lid fragments, snaps them together, forging a swirling disc.<words>385</words>
When he hurls the disc skyward, it cracks the ceiling like thin ice under skates.<words>400</words>
Starlight floods in, not painted, not prearranged, but raw galaxies roaring like unveiled organs.<words>414</words>
The globe tilts; seas long latent pour from hidden chambers, meeting wind syllables midair.<words>428</words>
We cling to porcelain rooftops while the ranger listens, translating bursts of foam into vows.<words>443</words>
His eyes glow, neither joyous nor afraid, only devoted, steadily distant from ordinary feeling.<words>457</words>
He announces the first sentence ever whispered between wind and wave: 'Carry them, and be carried.'<words>473</words>
The tide lifts the township like a seedpod, sailing us through the fractured glass into night.<words>489</words>
Behind, the lighthouse bulb blinks farewell onto unspooled tape.<words>498</words>
