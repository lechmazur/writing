In the abandoned laboratory filled with experiments, a morbid juggler named Varek rehearsed beneath flickering sodium lights. <words>17</words>
Every toss of scalpels, vials, and a single bent ruler traced arcs of glittering danger around his gloved hands. <words>36</words>
He practiced not for applause but to laugh last at the cosmic punchline he felt vibrating in the dust. <words>55</words>
That punchline, he believed, hid somewhere between science's abandoned certainties and the universe's consistently strange improvisations. <words>71</words>
Yet the cracked floor trembled when an unexpected visitor entered, guided via the scent of rare spices drifting through corridors. <words>91</words>
She was Myrren, a culinary alchemist who twisted traditions until flavor became prophecy, her pockets rattling with cinnamon grenades. <words>110</words>
Between them passed a single, startled, conspiratorial grinâ€”the entire encounter unfolding within the span of a shared smile. <words>128</words>
Varek bowed, juggling high, while Myrren uncapped a flask, releasing cardamom vapors that clamped memory and hesitation alike. <words>146</words>
The vapors formed invisible shackles on the machinery, freezing whirring centrifuges so the room hummed like a muted organ. <words>165</words>
In that hush, Varek's bent ruler sliced the air, measuring trajectories for jokes nobody else could perceive. <words>182</words>
He confided his scheme to Myrren: clamp the audience of stars themselves by hijacking abandoned telescopic transmitters below the lab. <words>202</words>
Once rigged with aromatic algorithms, the transmitters would waft punchline-laced cumin across the vacuum, making galaxies choke on laughter. <words>221</words>
Myrren agreed, seeing in Varek's defiant compassion a mirror of her own battle against flavorless fatalism. <words>237</words>
Together they stirred reagents from dusty shelves, spiking them with mace, saffron, and star-anise to program the cosmic gag. <words>256</words>
Varek juggled beakers mid-boil, his face a skull-painted lantern, while Myrren calibrated volumes with the warped edge of the ruler. <words>276</words>
Steam rose like ghostly jesters, and each bubble popped with a syllable of the joke only black holes could echo. <words>296</words>
When the mixture glowed ultraviolet, they poured it into the transmitter core, then clasped hands, sharing another swift, serrated smile. <words>316</words>
Binary constellations blinked on the control panel, acknowledging receipt of comedy beyond symmetry, and the lab walls sighed in relief. <words>336</words>
Across the telescopes of distant observers, sudden fragrant waves crashed, causing physicists to double over, chalk snapping in their fists. <words>356</words>
Some called it sacrilege, others divination, yet the morbid juggler simply caught his final blade, bowed, and whispered, 'Timing'. <words>375</words>
Myrren sprinkled a last dusting of nutmeg over the control lever, her grin warm enough to reseed dying suns. <words>394</words>
Together, they waited for the echo-laughter to return and prove existence still had absurd mercy. <words>409</words>
