I, Lord Peverell Staunton, spent my Saturday weeding the south lawn when the clandestine beeper hidden beneath the azalea buzzed.<words>20</words>
Despite my aristocratic pedigree, I hurried indoors like a chastised footman, for obedience had always come easier than swagger.<words>39</words>
The passage behind the grandfather clock slid open, revealing the secret agent workshop I financed but never dared to command.<words>59</words>
Tools glittered like constellations, yet one item—an embarrassingly dull letter opener—waited for me on the central bench.<words>76</words>
It was the workshop's quiet joke, because no aristocrat should be trusted with sharper steel.<words>91</words>
Still, the handle pulsed faintly, signaling that tonight's mission concerned neither mail nor manners.<words>105</words>
I placed the opener against the granite safe, and microfilament sensors read my prints before jets activated to liquify the lock.<words>126</words>
Steam curled like gossip, and the door swung, revealing a single audio file labeled 'Echo Chambers — DO NOT EDIT'.<words>146</words>
My unusually perceptive ear discerned two overlapping heartbeats recorded within, fluttery as sparrow wings trapped in crystal.<words>163</words>
Though the speakers remained mute, silent empathy filled the room, urging me to rescue whatever creature beat so frantically.<words>182</words>
But first, motivation required information, and information loved being overheard.<words>192</words>
So I donned the acoustic loop helmet, slipped into the ventilation shaft, and let unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers map my next steps.<words>215</words>
Above the workshop, gardeners continued trimming topiaries, their clippers providing a respectable alibi for any metallic clang I produced.<words>234</words>
Through ductwork I overheard Agent Czerny brag that the heartbeat belonged to a genetically miniaturized gryphon, engineered for reconnaissance then scheduled for dissection.<words>257</words>
His tone glittered cruelly, like ice deciding its glassware, and my ribs tightened around my tentative courage.<words>274</words>
Protect the vulnerable creature, whispered the opener’s pulsing hilt, half-taunt, half-command.<words>285</words>
Earnest flippancy is the only armor left to the obedient, I reminded myself, sliding from the shaft and greeting Czerny with a courtly bow.<words>309</words>
“Marvelous workshop, old sport,” I chirped, flicking the sad opener like a baton while noting door codes reflected in his monocle.<words>330</words>
He sneered; my smile widened, a paper parasol against a storm, until he tired of confusion and stalked toward the tea dispenser.<words>352</words>
I used that retreat to unlock the vivarium, where the pocket‑sized gryphon lay trembling under a heat lamp no larger than a ring box.<words>376</words>
Its bronze feathers quivered, and its kitten face stared up with an accusation so gentle it melted my ceremonial posture.<words>396</words>
Cradling it inside my waistcoat, I fled through the maintenance tunnel, the gardeners’ rhythmic clipping masking every footfall like polite applause for treason.<words>419</words>
Somewhere behind, Czerny shouted, but the echo chambers gave him only his own threats back, a punishment custom‑built for bullies.<words>439</words>
Outside, amid yard work and falling leaves, the gryphon exhaled a soot‑scented chirp, and I understood without words that our contract of silent empathy was signed.<words>465</words>
