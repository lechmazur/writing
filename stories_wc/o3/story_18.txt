Steam hissed from brass vents as dawn bled tarnished rose across the city square. <words>14</words>
In that mechanical sunrise stood Carven, a living statue with telepathy, granite brows beaded by dew. <words>30</words>
He listened to iron thoughts clanking from passersby, searching for one uncorroded note of honesty. <words>45</words>
His motive, endlessly recited in the silent corridors of his mind, was to find truth in a world of lies. <words>65</words>
Yet gloom and cheerfulness waltzed within his marble chest, forming a tragically joyful rhythm that matched the cobbled heartbeat beneath. <words>85</words>
Throughout planning for the day, he fingered a threadbare hair tie looped around his wrist like a relic of softness. <words>105</words>
The hair tie once bound the raven locks of Mira, the scribe who had sculpted him with the flow of ink in calligraphy. <words>128</words>
She disappeared after whispering, through their shared thoughts, that the mayor's ledgers hid the light of recognition. <words>145</words>
Since then the square's colossal clockwork cranes had tried to weatherize every surface, erasing stain, memory, and dissent. <words>163</words>
But Carven, porous as carved sandstone, stored rebellion in the microfractures of his frame. <words>177</words>
He waited now for Lemuel, a lamplighter who pretended incompetence so officials ignored his perpetual wanderings. <words>193</words>
Lemuel arrived riding a geared unicycle, laughter leaking like steam despite soot smearing his cheeks. <words>208</words>
"Show me the ledger," Carven projected, his voice a vibration beneath every cobblestone. <words>221</words>
Lemuel produced a scroll sealed with wax gears, but the writing was invisible to ordinary sight. <words>237</words>
Carven untied Mira's gift, placed the threadbare loop over the parchment, and the light of recognition shimmered through the frayed fibers. <words>258</words>
Words in phosphorescent calligraphy surged like tidal rivers, outlining bribery, silenced witnesses, and broken safety valves in the steamworks. <words>277</words>
Gloom thickened, but their joy was equally sharp, tragically joyful, because truth however bleak still sang. <words>293</words>
Throughout planning, they had rehearsed one reckless strategy: project the ledger's glow into every mind in the square. <words>311</words>
Carven knelt, palms flat, and allowed ink-like energy to pour from his thoughts into the cobbles, channeling with the flow of ink in calligraphy he remembered from Mira. <words>339</words>
Symbols raced along pipes, climbed lampposts, and fluttered across steam clouds, imprinting themselves upon the consciousness of workers, children, and even pigeons. <words>361</words>
The mayor, approaching in his polished automaton carriage, froze as the populace turned toward him with sudden, unified clarity. <words>380</words>
In their eyes burned a mirrored light of recognition, and he knew every hidden screw of his deception was exposed. <words>400</words>
