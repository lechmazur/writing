I strutted into the ancient roman marketplace, cloak frayed yet pride intact, feeling the crowd's scornful whistles bounce off marble columns. <words>21</words>
Their jeers were music to a determined outlaw who measured success by how many respectable noses wrinkled in his wake. <words>41</words>
I had come, wistfully pragmatic despite my swagger, to browse the stalls for rumors heavier than amphorae of spoiled wine. <words>61</words>
Whispers said a hidden power source slept beneath the Forum, humming like a caged thunderbird eager to scorch imperial laurels. <words>81</words>
My first clue glittered briefly—a merchant’s canvas smeared with gilded pigment that pulsed in the sun with the shimmer of possibility. <words>102</words>
The painter, an old fraud selling victory portraits to vanquished generals, scoffed when I asked where the gold glow began. <words>122</words>
"Search your own tarnished soul," he sneered, unaware that earnest mockery is my mother tongue and insults merely butter my bread. <words>143</words>
I left him gaping and studied the abandoned canvases stacked like forgotten gods behind his stall, each blot a cryptic constellation. <words>164</words>
By matching paint smudges left on disused canvases, I traced a map the painter hadn't meant to paint, arrows birthed by accidents. <words>186</words>
Each accidental arrow pointed beneath the basilica’s mosaic floor, where priests preached virtue while hiding wires to eternity. <words>204</words>
Night slipped over Rome like discounted velvet, and I crept into the basilica carrying only a simple cloth pouch for treasures. <words>225</words>
Its emptiness felt loud, a promise I intended to fill before dawn applause or the headsman's trumpet could interrupt. <words>244</words>
Under the altar, mosaic tiles pried loose revealed a stairwell lit by a glow bluer than Neptune’s envy. <words>262</words>
I descended, heart pounding a legion's march, certain I stood at the threshold of discovery and potential doom. <words>280</words>
In a chamber tiled with forgotten formulas, crystal coils spiraled around a copper core that sizzled like commandments on fresh stone. <words>301</words>
I laughed—soft, reverent, defiant—because Rome feared rebels with ideas more than rebels with swords, and this idea glowed. <words>319</words>
But earnest mockery cut both ways, and the chamber mirrored my grin with statues of past thieves fossilized in electrostatic glass. <words>340</words>
I steadied myself with wistfully pragmatic resolve: liberation demanded risk, and risk demanded speed no elegy could catch. <words>358</words>
Using bronze tongs, I fed the core a sliver of stolen lightning—yes, from Jupiter’s own tower during last year’s storm—and the coils blossomed. <words>381</words>
Energy surged into the pouch, cloth smoking but intact, and the chamber dimmed as though sighing relief at being unburdened. <words>401</words>
I escaped before alarms learned to cry, clutching a future empire in burlap as dawn painted Rome with naive gold. <words>421</words>
Above the rooftops, the shimmer of possibility trailed me like a comet, promising that even outlaws can rewrite constellations. <words>440</words>
