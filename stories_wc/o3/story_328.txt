Riggs, the assertively meek small-town bartender, blinked at the shimmering horizon where the highway vanished.<words>15</words>
Heat painted a mirage oasis ahead, palm fronds wagging like patrons who hadn't tipped yet.<words>30</words>
He'd left the bar's neon sanctuary carrying nothing but a blank greeting card and unreasonable hope.<words>46</words>
On its ivory face he meant to write the exit directions no algorithm had returned.<words>61</words>
Because technology kept mapping circles, Riggs suspected the labyrinth wanted handwriting, not GPS.<words>74</words>
Each step forward fried his shoes, yet desperate optimism bubbled louder than the asphalt's sizzle.<words>89</words>
The fireworks festival behind town cracked the sky; one ember arced, fizzled, and left smoke.<words>104</words>
In the instant a firework fizzles and leaves smoke, time yawns wide enough for reinvention.<words>119</words>
Riggs slipped through that opening like a coin dropped between floorboards.<words>130</words>
Suddenly he stood within the mirage oasis, only now the water was real and glowing.<words>145</words>
Strangers lounged on carpets, their faces pixelating then reforming, as if uncertain which resolution matched their memories.<words>162</words>
To xenialize them, Riggs raised an imaginary tray and poured jokes about craft beer into their cups.<words>179</words>
His hospitality stitched connection via embedded threads of gold in a battered tapestry hanging between palm trunks.<words>196</words>
Whenever laughter rippled, new pathways illuminated across the woven scene, corridors bright as dawn.<words>210</words>
He realized the tapestry was the labyrinth's blueprint, and stories were the keys.<words>223</words>
A woman whose outlines glitched like bad reception offered him an antique stylus of humming quartz.<words>239</words>
Write your escape, she whispered, because code listens to ink it cannot predict.<words>252</words>
Riggs pressed the blank greeting card against his knee and scribbled a single sentence: 'I bartend tomorrow'.<words>269</words>
Gold threads snapped, unleashing a cyclone of pixels that rearranged themselves into the familiar bar doorway.<words>285</words>
He stepped through, smelling brew and sawdust, but the air hummed with circuits newly mindful of humans.<words>302</words>
Technology had tasted hospitality and now redesigned itself to serve, not trap.<words>314</words>
Though still meek, Riggs felt assertively aligned with whatever future walked in for a drink.<words>329</words>
Outside, fireworks roared forward again, closing the temporal crevice, leaving only smoke shaped like a winding puzzle.<words>346</words>
He tucked the card beneath the cash register, a quiet map for the next lost soul.<words>362</words>
Yet he suspected the labyrinth lingered, encoded in every touchscreen menu he wiped nightly.<words>376</words>
So he polished glasses like mirrors, watching reflections for corridors trying to curl back around him.<words>392</words>
And whenever a stranger entered, Riggs xenialized again, adding fresh gold to the evolving tapestry.<words>407</words>
