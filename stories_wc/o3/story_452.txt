After the end of storytelling, the neon towers of Cerulean Precinct hummed like muted euphoria around the cyberpunk city police station where I awaited my final assignment. <words>27</words>
Everyone there called me the softhearted champion because I arrested killers with apologies and bandaged thieves before cuffing them. <words>46</words>
Yet tonight Captain Sable slid a plain brown belt buckle across the cracked desk, saying its origin could unravel fate itself if mishandled. <words>69</words>
He ordered me to stabilize the evidence vault, but I felt the buckle vibrate with a consistently organic pulse that no polymer scanner registered. <words>93</words>
That pulse matched the secret rhythm I had monitored during my clandestine midnight visits to a shuttered planetarium on the river's edge. <words>115</words>
Inside the domed ruin, forgotten projectors had mapped invisible constellations, each flicker burning coordinates onto my retinas like pleas from unborn galaxies. <words>137</words>
Those coordinates pointed back here, to this buckle, to me, and to a possibility: etch a new cosmic signature so the universe could correct its drift. <words>163</words>
I pocketed the talisman under Sable's glare, promised routine paperwork, then slipped through rain streaked alleys toward the planetarium, heart thudding with muted euphoria. <words>187</words>
City drones tracked curfew, but my badge spoofed their optics, and the buckle's pulse guided me like sonar through fogged holographic billboards. <words>209</words>
Within the planetarium, I mounted the buckle onto the antique star table, aligning its worn prongs with the phantom constellation engraved behind the cracked lens. <words>234</words>
Projectors awoke, spilling dim azure, and spectra cascaded across my palms, branding coordinates that rethreaded the sky's tangled yarn. <words>253</words>
I felt centuries compress, battles un-fought, romances rekindled, extinction events paused, as if the cosmos were rearranging files in some celestial police archive. <words>276</words>
But the adjustment stalled, flickering at one remaining knot: a memory of Captain Sable executing a suspect I once spared. <words>296</words>
Realizing the universe demanded symmetry, I overlaid my badge beside the buckle, offering my career as counterweight. <words>313</words>
A hush deeper than silence filled the dome, then starlight poured through the shattered ceiling and grained into the badge, forging an auroral sigil. <words>337</words>
The buckle cooled, the sky stabilized, and a new constellation, an open palm holding a belt circle, blinked into permanence. <words>357</words>
Muted euphoria washed through me, softer than religion, harder than alloy, as my police database ID dissolved from every server. <words>377</words>
I was no longer officer or champion, only a wandering signature etched into space, consistently organic and forever at work unraveling fate before it frayed again. <words>403</words>
