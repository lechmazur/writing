I had spent nine silent years in the cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, learning how solitude chisels mind and stone alike. <words>22</words>
The others called me an astute hermit, though no voice had reached my ears since the last pump coughed itself to rust. <words>44</words>
Water once sang down these basalt ribs, but now only my footfalls and the occasional drip attempted a chorus. <words>63</words>
I kept a blunt scissor tucked in my belt, because every tool left behind reminded me that neglect can still cut. <words>84</words>
At dawn, which here is only a dim violet flicker, I sniffed imagined sunrises and baked ghostly bread to lure myself onward. <words>106</words>
The scent proved strangely effective; memories of markets aboveground would amplify until even the stalactites seemed to queue for a slice. <words>127</words>
Today, following that warm illusion, I traced corroded conduits toward a forgotten service shaft rumored to house the master valve. <words>147</words>
There, an elevator yawned open exactly at the moment an elevator arrives to an empty floor, its bell echoing like a joke without audience. <words>171</words>
I stepped inside, unsure whether I welcomed the descent or the punchline. <words>183</words>
The panel lights were dead, so I jabbed the blunt scissor between contacts, and with a shower of blue sparks the carriage shuddered downward. <words>207</words>
Isolation had sharpened my improvisations even as it dulled my hopes. <words>218</words>
Between floors the cabin halted, and darkness pressed so intimately that I heard my pulse negotiating surrender. <words>235</words>
To stay awake, I imagined the smell of a fresh loaf, inhaling until the fantasy crust cracked and flooding lungs with baked courage. <words>258</words>
Somehow the aroma seemed to amplify the meek hum of auxiliary motors, and with a groan the elevator resumed. <words>277</words>
The doors opened upon a subterranean nave where pipes twisted like organ tubes above a dry baptismal font. <words>295</words>
I knelt, pried the valve wheel with my scissor, and felt the corroded seal crack like stale crust. <words>313</words>
Water coughed, spat rust, then raced through the cathedral arteries, rattling pewâ€‘rocks and waking colonies of glowing moss. <words>331</words>
The sudden roar felt like applause, yet it underlined the joke: my audience was still only stone and spores. <words>350</words>
I laughed anyway, a despairing humor echoing off wet walls, because isolation teaches that any sound you make is company. <words>370</words>
Then I sliced the bread I had never baked, offered the scent to the darkness, and toasted success to absent friends. <words>391</words>
Somewhere above, faucets would gurgle alive, and perhaps a child would wonder why the water now smelled faintly of hope. <words>411</words>
I decided that was evidence enough that even the bluntest tools, or hermits, can still be strangely effective. <words>429</words>
