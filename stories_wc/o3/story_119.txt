In the seconds following a sudden revelation, I landed back inside my body, gasping on the abandoned carnival roller coaster track. <words>21</words>
Moments earlier, my secret astral projector self had hovered above the rusting loops, spying truths I was never meant to glimpse. <words>42</words>
The truth had whispered that survival skills are perishable, like candy floss left out in rain. <words>58</words>
That whisper jolted me into mission, practiced spontaneity guiding each twitch of muscle. <words>71</words>
I clutched the antique brass key I sometimes always carry on a chain beneath my shirt. <words>87</words>
Its engravings glittered between the skeletal struts, reflecting ragged rectangles of late afternoon light. <words>101</words>
The key was not for doors but for direction, a compass guiding me by tracking sun shadows across warped rails. <words>121</words>
If the shadow fell north of the third rivet, I would flee; if south, I would stand and heal. <words>140</words>
Now it pointed irrevocably north, black and thin and urgent. <words>150</words>
I sprinted along splintered planks where children's laughter had once looped like the cars above. <words>165</words>
My lungs burned, but unyielding compassion kept me moving, because others would need the knowledge I carried. <words>182</words>
Preserving my own survival skills meant preserving theirs; training must endure even when mentors do not. <words>198</words>
So each step etched a mnemonic into muscle memory, every breath counting car lengths as future lessons. <words>215</words>
Behind me, the revelation's echo roared like an invisible carousel, promising oblivion to whoever hesitated. <words>230</words>
I remembered Alina, the runaway who once called me coward for hiding my gift, and I forgave her anew. <words>249</words>
Compassion, after all, is strongest when thrust toward those who scarred us. <words>261</words>
She had vanished on this very track, swallowed by its last midnight drop, and I still searched between dimensions. <words>280</words>
Tonight my astral scouting had spotted her outline curled beneath the ticket booth rubble, alive yet fading. <words>297</words>
Northward flight would lead me to the booth before the sun's rim sank and the key lost guidance. <words>315</words>
Still running, I lifted the key, letting its metal tongue sip gold from the horizon, aligning shadow to gravel. <words>334</words>
The shadow narrowed into an arrow, and I veered right through a gap in the safety fence. <words>351</words>
As wheels of forgotten cars creaked above in phantom momentum, I found Alina, pulse flickering like midway bulbs. <words>369</words>
She opened blurred eyes, and fear rushed in, but I answered with the same unyielding compassion that fueled my flight. <words>389</words>
We could not rebuild the carnival, yet we could preserve the skill of escaping ruin, so I whispered lessons while the sun died. <words>412</words>
Tomorrow, when her strength returned, we would flee together, shadows as map, key as promise, compassion as perpetual engine. <words>431</words>
