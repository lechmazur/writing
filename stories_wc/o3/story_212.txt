<story>
The sky over the ethereal plains still shimmered radioactive violet after the last resource war.<words>15</words>
Silas Gray, an apocalyptic farmer breeding new seeds from ash and stubborn hope, trudged furrows that glowed faintly in the dusk.<words>36</words>
In his coat pocket nestled a magician’s deck of trick cards, relic of a vanished carnival, shuffling itself whenever the wind moaned.<words>58</words>
Each night Silas cut the irradiated stalks and listened for the song of boundaries— a hush that told him which slopes life still permitted.<words>82</words>
The song rose from dirt like raw solace, vibrating his teeth and steering his shovel away from dead zones.<words>101</words>
He was typically atypical among survivors, speaking softly to seeds yet roaring at ghosts of generals who had dictated his boyhood.<words>122</words>
Their orders had chained his family to compulsory orchards, and his only motivation now was to escape any life dictated by another ever again.<words>146</words>
So Silas would jabber at the moon, at the soil, at the cards, letting nonsense scatter as mulch for clearer intentions.<words>167</words>
On the seventh sunset of frost, the trick deck spat out the queen of spades, its black face etched with new silver coastlines.<words>190</words>
Taking it as omen, Silas stuffed bottles with crude maps and clipped seeds, then cast them toward distant breakers where poisoned oceans still breathed.<words>214</words>
He trusted the currents, because messages in a bottle carried by the sea had once ferried him his grandmother’s laughter after the first salvo.<words>238</words>
That memory still hummed beside the song of boundaries, telling him the world could deliver tenderness through wreckage.<words>256</words>
Weeks later, a bottle returned, barnacled yet bright, containing a single joker from his deck and a note of three words: 'Shoreline seedsong await'.<words>280</words>
Heart drumming raw solace against his ribs, Silas saddled an old solar skiff and followed the phosphorescent tide toward dawn.<words>300</words>
The ethereal plains thinned into glassy shallows where mist pillars stood like abandoned cathedrals, singing counterpoint to the song of boundaries.<words>321</words>
Beyond them waited a community of rebels who had deciphered his jabber in the bottle, calling themselves the Cartomancers of Coast.<words>342</words>
They grew food according to the shuffled oracle of trick cards, trusting probability more than politics, and needed Silas to teach seeds how to survive salt.<words>368</words>
In exchange they offered no orders, only shared horizons, which was the precise freedom he had pursued since the orchards burned.<words>389</words>
Under a sky slowly healing to cobalt, Silas planted his toughest kernels while the Cartomancers strummed driftwood harps and the song of boundaries shifted key.<words>414</words>
He realized the hush was not a limit but a chord awaiting harmony, and he, typically atypical, had finally found voices to complete it.<words>438</words>
