Theo plucked his weatherworn guitar outside the automated postal sorting facility, serenading conveyor belts instead of commuters.<words>17</words>
He called the echoing loading dock his cathedral of joyful despair, because fluorescent angels flickered like broken stained glass.<words>36</words>
Tonight, courier drones hummed a drab hymn, and Theo improvised comic riffs between their metallic verses.<words>52</words>
He performed for one listener: a vintage fountain pen balanced upright on an outbound crate, nib glinting expectantly.<words>70</words>
The pen, absurdly regal among barcode stickers, reminded him of a promise he had never inked to paper.<words>88</words>
Regrets surged like static, a backlash so strong it distorted chord shapes into knotty, complexly deceptive progressions.<words>105</words>
Each sour note was a mislabeled parcel addressed to the past.<words>116</words>
Desperate to rewind, Theo searched memory the way scanners chase faded ink, looking for forgotten patterns in the jam.<words>135</words>
He pictured the suitcase he left on a midnight platform, bulging with jokes meant for someone who stopped laughing.<words>154</words>
It had closed with the hush of curtains falling, and he feared it might never reopen to applause.<words>172</words>
The pen seemed a key, so he pocketed it, ignoring the posted warning against removing smart inventory.<words>189</words>
Sensors flared; conveyor belts froze mid-clatter, as if the facility itself wanted to hear his explanation.<words>205</words>
Theo strummed a punchline about cosmic absurdity, admitting he stole only what had already belonged to his silence.<words>223</words>
Laser readers blinked like amused audiences, and power resumed with a theatrical whirr.<words>236</words>
Yet the pen leaked glimmering ink across his palm, scripting arabesques that mapped a route through the chutes.<words>254</words>
He followed, sidestepping robots sorting postcards of sunsets he had never visited.<words>266</words>
The trail ended at an unscanned package addressed to 'Future Forwarder,' sealed moments earlier by invisible scheduling software.<words>284</words>
Theo tucked the fountain pen under the twine, realizing he must mail away his unplayed encore before regrets circled back.<words>304</words>
He kissed the label, hummed a risible requiem, and pressed dispatch, surrendering choice to conveyors that understand only movement.<words>323</words>
As the package disappeared, laughter and tears harmonized inside him, notes colliding like playful meteors in a dark carnival sky.<words>343</words>
The facility lights dimmed to lavender, signaling shift's end, and Theo stepped outside where dawn rehearsed on horizon strings.<words>362</words>
He reopened his guitar case—a suitcase always willing—and found it empty of coins yet brimming with suddenly lighter heartbeats.<words>381</words>
Though the closed suitcase of the past might never reopen, he had mailed a punchline to meet it halfway.<words>400</words>
His music resumed, threading joyful despair into the morning rush, every chord a stamp canceling yesterday's overdue postage.<words>418</words>
