The cybernetic veterinarian stepped onto a reef of kaleidoscopic coral, his servo-limbs humming like caged cicadas.<words>16</words>
All around him swirled raucous silence, a paradoxical hush crackling with colors too loud for ordinary ears.<words>33</words>
He had arrived here in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo, when time itself seemed to hold its breath.<words>54</words>
Inside his chest, circuits pulsed with one forbidden craving: to devour a sacred taboo and discover why it tasted like fear.<words>75</words>
Years of healing wounded beasts had tempered his empathy, yet curiosity still sought to distort the edges of his oaths.<words>95</words>
So he sought wisdom by rummaging in abandoned motels that punctuated the drowned coast beyond the reef.<words>112</words>
There, amid peeling wallpaper and rusted keys, he uncovered a blacksmith's bucket stained with mythic soot.<words>128</words>
Legend whispered that any substance boiled inside the bucket would shed its identity, becoming whatever the wielder hungered for most.<words>148</words>
The veterinarian believed the vessel might be uniquely effective at cooking the intangibleâ€”ideas, taboos, and even memories.<words>165</words>
Yet to test it he needed an ingredient that challenged perceptions so violently it could tear through tradition's stitched lips.<words>185</words>
He remembered the reef's singing oysters, rumored to distill forbidden melodies into luminous pearls.<words>199</words>
Harvesting one required listening until the song burrowed under skin and threatened to replace the listener's heartbeat.<words>216</words>
He knelt, tuned his auditory implants, and caught a note so sharp it seemed to split the reef's chromatic pillars.<words>236</words>
Blood tasted coppery in his throat, but the oyster opened, surrendering a pearl that flickered like a censorious eye.<words>255</words>
He dropped it into the blacksmith's bucket, added seawater, and ignited his palm-mounted arc torch beneath the iron belly.<words>274</words>
Steam rose, twisting into phantom animals whose limbs elongated, then distorted into letters spelling out names he had euthanized.<words>293</words>
Each vaporous syllable tasted of guilt, but also of promise, urging him onward toward the forbidden feast.<words>310</words>
When the brew thickened, he dipped a scalpel and lifted a single drop, iridescent and trembling like an exposed nerve.<words>330</words>
Swallowing it, he felt taboos unravel inside him, rewriting synapses, challenging perceptions with revelations that made sanity limp.<words>348</words>
The reef's colors rearranged into corridors, and he walked through them as if through motel hallways painted by thunder.<words>367</words>
Doors opened onto every animal he had healed or lost, each offering forgiveness in exchange for a shred of his newfound hunger.<words>389</words>
He bartered gladly, feeding pieces of the sacred taboo to their memories until the corridor collapsed into surf.<words>407</words>
At last the raucous silence returned, not oppressive now but sheltering, as though the reef itself had stitched shut its volume.<words>428</words>
The cybernetic veterinarian realized his hunger was sated, not by consumption, but by transformation, and the bucket cooled like a heart at peace.<words>451</words>
Some taboos, he knew, were meant to be devoured so the world could taste their absence and grow stranger and kinder.<words>472</words>
