The zeppelin Ascension drifted over lavender clouds, its floating library creaking softly while rare tomes jostled in their brass cages. <words>20</words>
Among the aisles stalked Ira Greaves, a renegade matchmaker whose job used to be hearts, but whose mission now was galaxies. <words>41</words>
He carried inside his waistcoat a colorless plastic button that pulsed like a mute star whenever certain pages were turned. <words>61</words>
The button was his only clue to an interstellar secret buried in the margins of books never checked out, the untold stories whispering between channels of reality. <words>88</words>
To others the mystery seemed complicatedly simple, like a child’s riddle; to Ira it was the map of his exile. <words>108</words>
He had fled the Bureau of Harmonies after refusing to pair two tyrants, pausing to lament that some unions only breed silence. <words>130</words>
Now his sharp gentleness sliced through shelves as he searched for the volume that would unlock the button’s hush. <words>149</words>
Outside, the library’s pennant snapped with the ripple of a flag in the wind, a code Ira had learned to read. <words>170</words>
Dots of fabric movement corresponded to shelf numbers, and shelf numbers corresponded to letters, and letters, he believed, corresponded to the stars. <words>192</words>
Following the flutter, he reached a locked cabinet labelled 'Romances Misfiled by Probability,' pried it open, and found a diary bound in meteorite dust. <words>216</words>
The diary belonged to Celestine Dyad, the Bureau’s first mathematician of affection, who vanished after claiming equations could sing. <words>235</words>
Ira thumbed its pages, and the button flickered, projecting a spectrum only he could not see, because it remained obstinately colorless. <words>256</words>
He realized then that invisibility was the spectrum; the untold stories were written in absences, in skipped lines, in courteous erasures. <words>277</words>
If he matched each erasure to a silence he had orchestrated during his years of matchmaking, the diary’s gaps might reveal the secret route between suns. <words>303</words>
He took a pen and began annotating, his handwriting looping like tether lines, each word both apology and hypothesis. <words>322</words>
Hours blurred; the zeppelin crossed weather seams, that hush of space sailors called 'between channels,' where compasses hesitated and thoughts echoed. <words>343</words>
In that lull the flags outside lay flat, the code complete, and the button finally clicked, a small mechanical sigh. <words>363</words>
A holographic map blossomed from the diary, tracing lovers long separated by light-years, showing how reunion would align seven rogue planets into a corridor of propulsion. <words>389</words>
Ira understood that the universe yearned to pair itself, and that deciphering this design would require him to mend every pairing he had once refused. <words>414</words>
He closed the diary, pinned the colorless plastic button over his heart, and stepped toward the observation deck, already rehearsing gentle lacerations of truth for tomorrow’s voyage. <words>441</words>
Behind him, books reshelved themselves with the ripple of a flag in the wind, saluting a matchmaker who had finally found someone to love: the void itself. <words>468</words>
