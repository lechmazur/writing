In the breath after a child’s question is left unanswered, the corridor hushes like sheltered dusk.<words>16</words>
Beyond a stone arch, an overgrown library hidden in catacombs of lost knowledge exhales dusty pollen.<words>32</words>
Gideon Hale, a torn visionary with inked palms, slips through vines that clutch marble shelves.<words>47</words>
His stubbornly optimistic grin flickers like candlelight fighting gale.<words>56</words>
He has come to track solar cycles carved into forgotten margins of codices.<words>69</words>
Each spiral etching promises one more missing piece to the pattern haunting his sleepless calculations.<words>84</words>
From his satchel he withdraws a cellphone from 1920, brass‑framed and humming with anachronistic sparks.<words>99</words>
The device receives only signals bounced off sunspots, translating flares into Morse fluorescence across its cracked screen.<words>116</words>
Gideon listens, notebook ready, while ivy creeps like slow lightning over encyclopedic tombs.<words>129</words>
He writes latitudes in charcoal, yet nagging gaps remain, numbers refusing to yield.<words>142</words>
Frustration mounts until footsteps echo, delicate but certain, through the feral stacks.<words>154</words>
Dr. Mara Ilori emerges, her eyes bright with careful wildness, carrying a tattered novel.<words>168</words>
She and Gideon once decoded constellations over midnight coffee, a shared love for a certain book binding them.<words>186</words>
Now she seeks him, because the child's unanswered question had been hers: 'Where does the daylight go?'<words>203</words>
Together they spread maps over a fallen globe coated in spiderwort blossoms.<words>215</words>
Mara compares Gideon’s solar arithmetic with legends hidden in the novel’s margins, inked by unknown custodians.<words>231</words>
Pages mention a subterranean observatory whose ceiling of mirrors was dismantled, its shards scattered like missing pieces.<words>248</words>
If reassembled, the mirrors would focus noonlight onto a single glyph that unlocks final coordinates.<words>263</words>
Optimism outweighs logic, and the two scholars begin rummaging among toppled armoires, chasing reflections like playful ghosts.<words>280</words>
They uncover splintered plates of silvered glass nested in archives of banned heliography.<words>293</words>
Mara steadies one fragment while Gideon aligns another, their fingertips smudged with chlorophyll and ancient ink.<words>309</words>
Slowly, a prism of resurrected daylight climbs the walls, illuminating the brass cellphone from 1920.<words>324</words>
Its screen blooms with coordinates that perfectly complete Gideon’s table; the pattern breathes whole at last.<words>340</words>
Gideon wants to race skyward, yet he pauses, recalling why vision once tore him apart.<words>355</words>
He had abandoned collaborators before, chasing eclipses alone, and every orbit left friendships as orbital debris.<words>371</words>
Now he meets Mara’s gaze and chooses to yield to partnership, not obsession.<words>384</words>
They vow to ascend together when dawn returns, guided by mirrors, Morse light, and mutual wonder.<words>400</words>
Until then, they sit among blooming ferns, rereading the certain book aloud, fortifying their hope for tomorrow.<words>417</words>
