Within the realm of the subconscious, the abandoned carnival ring toss game stood beneath a spotlight that had no source, whirring gently despite the absence of wind.<words>27</words>
Only the deflated oracle remained to tend it, his once booming prophecies now escaping as faint sighs that smelled of dust.<words>48</words>
He guarded an empty perfume bottle, the last relic of the midway's forgotten glamour, cradling it like a lung that could still draw breath.<words>72</words>
Every night, melancholic glee shimmered around him as dreamlike invitations drifted from the bottle's mouth, written in invisible ink that only sleepers could read.<words>96</words>
Those letters summoned the independently dependent—souls unable to live alone yet unwilling to submit—to gather at the ring toss for an impossible rehearsal.<words>119</words>
Tonight, I was one of them, pulled through velvet sleep toward creaking booths and crescent moons painted on sagging plywood.<words>139</words>
The oracle greeted me with a nod that released a flutter of confetti made from obsolete calendars, each scrap whispering mistakes that begged to be corrected.<words>165</words>
He told me that history was an order of rings already thrown, yet some had never landed where they were meant.<words>186</words>
To enact a new trajectory, we would have to succeed by reconfiguring the braids of a centuries old ceremonial rope coiled like a sleeping serpent beneath the counter.<words>214</words>
Each braid represented a hinge moment, and loosening one would slacken a tyrant’s oath, tighten another would cradle an unborn poem, choose poorly and memories would unravel.<words>241</words>
We began, my fingers moving in tandem with the oracle’s limp but certain hands, his deflation offset by the helium of my hope.<words>264</words>
Strand by strand we rewove causality, feeling the rope pulse like a rewound heart as carnival lights flickered back into colors the world had never seen.<words>290</words>
With every knot corrected, the ring toss posts straightened, and phantom rings clinked onto them, scoring points for lives that once failed.<words>312</words>
Somewhere far away, a child woke laughing instead of weeping, while a city wall cracked kindly to let refugees in before the cannons arrived.<words>336</words>
The oracle smiled, air returning to his cheeks like slow balloons, yet the melancholic glee deepened in his eyes because he knew what payment would be.<words>362</words>
To rewrite history we had torn pages from the future, and now our own tomorrows dangled threadbare where certainty used to hang.<words>384</words>
He handed me the empty perfume bottle, instructing that I fill it with the scent of decisions I would never make, sealing it as collateral against the universe’s audit.<words>413</words>
I accepted, independently dependent on his fading wisdom, knowing that by dawn I would forget him yet breathe whatever fragrance stayed imprisoned inside the glass.<words>438</words>
As the carnival dissolved back into mind mist, the rope’s new braids hummed a lullaby of corrected timelines, and distant lovers felt suddenly on time for each other.<words>466</words>
The oracle exhaled one last calendar, blank and bright, and we both understood it was meant for us to write a quieter song across its days.<words>492</words>
