Carlo thumbed the scar across his knuckles, the gesture of every apologetic thug rehearsing repentance. <words>15</words>
Tonight he walked toward the city's static electricity garden, where humming Tesla coils mimicked late‑summer cicadas. <words>31</words>
The air sparked blue at his boots, as though conscience itself crackled, urging him forward. <words>46</words>
Carlo carried only a plain wooden crate slat, scavenged earlier from the dockside of forgotten deals. <words>62</words>
The splintered board felt like a broken sentence he still owed the world. <words>75</words>
He had a plan as rationally subjective as quantum fortune, balanced between logic and battered faith. <words>91</words>
If he could outlast his reputation, he might finally decipher resilience instead of merely surviving it. <words>107</words>
The method he chose was strange yet delicate: staging accidental meetings in museums with those he wronged. <words>124</words>
Inside marble halls, whispers disguised reconciliations, and guards mistook tears for allergies stirred by ancient dust. <words>140</words>
Tonight, however, no museum walls surrounded him, only the sizzling hedges of conductive vines. <words>154</words>
He waited because Mara, last name he had carved in fear, loved evening experiments here. <words>169</words>
Their meeting must seem coincidental, timed in the second a new silhouette appears on the horizon. <words>185</words>
That fragile instant, he believed, could reboot narratives the way a thunderclap resets the restless sky. <words>201</words>
Light stuttered along wire‑laced rosebushes, and Carlo rehearsed his line: “I kept this slat as proof I’m done breaking things.” <words>221</words>
He hoped the apology would strike exactly between copper petals and her heart, neither grounding nor burning. <words>238</words>
Footsteps crackled over gravel, and a silhouette gathered substance against the neon dusk. <words>251</words>
Yet the shape was unfamiliar, taller, carrying not forgiveness but a pistol wrapped in newspaper. <words>266</words>
Carlo’s stomach tightened; the past resented eviction and had sent another collector. <words>278</words>
Mara might still arrive, and danger could shatter the fragile curriculum of resilience he sought. <words>293</words>
He lifted the crate slat, palms up, as if offering both weapon and surrender in one plank. <words>310</words>
Static crawled along the wood, illuminating grain like river maps, and the stranger hesitated. <words>324</words>
Carlo spoke softly, the tone quietly intense he’d practiced before cracked mirrors: “I’m done adding scars.” <words>340</words>
The stranger’s gaze flicked to the glowing hedges, perhaps calculating how lightning chooses its victims. <words>355</words>
Rationally subjective fear met rationally subjective hope, and for a breath neither conquered. <words>368</words>
Then the pistol lowered, as though the garden itself had argued jurisprudence, and the silhouette vanished toward night markets. <words>387</words>
Moments later, Mara emerged, carrying damaged circuitry for research, her eyebrows raised at Carlo’s trembling relief. <words>403</words>
He handed her the slat, edges still radiant, and said, “I outlasted what tried to outlast me.” <words>420</words>
In the sparked stillness they understood resilience was less a wall than a doorway left stubbornly open. <words>437</words>
Somewhere overhead, coils hissed approval, and dawn teased the horizon with yet another silhouette to test them. <words>454</words>
