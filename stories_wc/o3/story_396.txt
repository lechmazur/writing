Aloïs, a charmingly forgetful urban forager, arrived late to the avant‑garde science fair held in the abandoned champagne vault beneath Paris.<words>21</words>
He carried in his coat pocket a jagged fragment of a stained‑glass window, scavenged from a ruined chapel overlooking the périphérique.<words>42</words>
To Aloïs, the shimmering shard was a fragile wonder whose colors seemed to hum with secret instructions.<words>59</words>
He had come to the fair only to shield it from collectors rumored to negotiate ruthlessly for relics of lost Paris.<words>80</words>
Yet his disinterested passion for the city’s forgotten treasures made him appear more bored than vigilant.<words>96</words>
While drones buzzed overhead projecting holographic molecules, a string quartet rehearsed for the final performance scheduled to crown the evening.<words>116</words>
Their tuning filled the stone corridors throughout the final performance, weaving music with echo like uncorked ghosts.<words>133</words>
Aloïs, half‑listening, traced the shard’s lead seams, trying to remember why a particular hue of cobalt felt perilous.<words>151</words>
That was when Siham, a Tunisian materials engineer, collided with him beside a vat of experimental yeast cultures.<words>169</words>
Glass slivered light between them, and the chance encounter at a science fair became a crossroads of cultures.<words>187</words>
Siham’s research aimed to bio‑reinforce architectural fragments, extending heritage into the future; Aloïs aimed simply to hide his.<words>205</words>
Their goals clashed like mismatched dialects, yet her curiosity and his disinterested passion sparked a tentative dialogue.<words>222</words>
She proposed they negotiate a shared guardianship: she would study the shard’s microfractures on condition it never leave the city’s soil.<words>243</words>
Aloïs sighed, pretending indifference, but his fingers tightened around the shard as if remembering the cobalt warning.<words>260</words>
He had once seen that same hue spill from riot police shields during protests against museum privatization, a vivid emblem of cultural clash.<words>283</words>
Reluctance wrestled with responsibility, and his charmingly forgetful mind tried to catalog every consequence before promptly misplacing them.<words>301</words>
In the vault above, applause burst, signaling the quartet’s entrance and the official start of the final performance.<words>319</words>
Music trickled down the spiral stairs, each note reminding Aloïs that wonder survives only when audiences are listening.<words>337</words>
He offered the shard to Siham during a cello swell, his voice flat yet aflame: “Guard it publicly, but let its secrets stay underground.”<words>361</words>
She nodded with equal restraint, promising to mount the fragment in a mobile lab hidden behind the champagne racks, open to scholars yet rooted in stone.<words>387</words>
Together they sealed the pact by sliding the shard into a velvet case, its colors quiet as the corked bottles surrounding them.<words>409</words>
Throughout the final performance, they stood apart like mismatched notes, tolerantly indifferent yet fiercely protective, listening to music neither claimed to enjoy.<words>431</words>
And when the last chord resolved, the vault lights dimmed, leaving only a cobalt glint, proof that disinterested passion can still shelter splendor.<words>454</words>
