I was comparing aubergines in the fluorescent hush of Kingswell Market when a sudden urge to explore a path not taken gripped me. <words>23</words>
The tug felt like silk wrapped around a hook, promising that amid ordinary grocery shopping I might corner an elusive destiny hiding in plain aisles. <words>48</words>
I followed the magnetic whisper out the back exit, baskets abandoned, and found the aged smoke signal tower brooding behind the loading dock. <words>71</words>
Once a frontier communication spire, it now leaked curling gray fumes from a rusted chimney, as if still exhaling forgotten conversations into the gusty afternoon. <words>96</words>
The air smelled of soot and thyme, an unlikely herbal duet that only a cunning connoisseur like myself could recognise as an invitation. <words>119</words>
I climbed the narrow spiral stairs, shoes squeaking a nervous rhythm, until I reached a cluttered chamber wallpapered in xerographs of antique botany catalogues. <words>143</words>
There, on a brass lectern, rested vintage seed packets sealed with crimson wax, each envelope inked with ciphers that shimmered when the smoke light stroked them. <words>169</words>
Decoding the forgotten has always been my private sport, a morally ambiguous indulgence I justify by telling myself history sighs with relief when unlocked. <words>193</words>
I pried open one packet and poured its dust-fine seeds onto my palm, discovering micro-lettering etched upon each husk like prayers to a silent soil. <words>218</words>
The letters rearranged beneath my gaze, forming coordinates that spiralled downward to a hatch I had first dismissed as a coal hole. <words>240</words>
I lifted the iron lid and descended into a subcellar throbbing with projector fans, every wall alive with looping xerographs of lost harvest festivals. <words>264</words>
In that gentle chaos of flickering images, a voice crackled from an intercom, asking whether I intended cultivation or exploitation. <words>284</words>
My reply, equal parts truth and performance, professed a desire to cultivate yet corner destiny, because sometimes the rarest bloom is opportunity itself. <words>307</words>
The intercom sighed open a pneumatic drawer holding a single seed made of polished obsidian, reflecting me as both gardener and grave robber. <words>330</words>
Instinct told me this kernel contained a memory the world had mislaid, and that planting it would xerograph the forgotten directly onto tomorrowâ€™s landscape. <words>354</words>
Yet stealing it meant abandoning the produce aisle forever, because destinies, once cornered, demand all exit doors be bolted behind you. <words>375</words>
I pocketed the obsidian seed, climbed back up, and strolled past bewildered cashiers, paying for nothing but carrying everything, smoke still threading my hair. <words>399</words>
Outside, I planted the seed beside the trolley corral, and the asphalt cracked, sprouting a tower of black petals signalling the world to remember. <words>423</words>
