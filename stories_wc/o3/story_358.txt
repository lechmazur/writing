The blizzard gnawed at the research station, yet inside its arctic greenhouse the air shimmered with humid life and unsettling expectation. <words>21</words>
It was playground time for the scientists’ bundled children, whose laughter ricocheted among tomato vines like bells in a crypt. <words>41</words>
Into this incongruous Eden stepped Master Ellory, an old‑fashioned mage wearing silk gloves yellowed by centuries of occult chalk. <words>60</words>
His reputation was purposefully aimless, for he roamed without map so the cosmos itself would reveal roads no chart had earned. <words>81</words>
Cradled against his chest, as though he might cuddle a feverish infant, lay a walnut‑sized fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin. <words>101</words>
Splinters of gold leaf still clung to hieroglyphs spelling only the first clue of an unfolding riddle too holy to pronounce aloud. <words>123</words>
Ellory sought the next verse not in papyrus but in reflections, believing every mirror a thin ice sheet above buried worlds. <words>144</words>
So he passed among panes of monitoring glass, greeting each spectral copy of himself with a nod, then listening to its hush. <words>166</words>
The children paused in their play, sensing the sanctified dread that trailed him like frankincense smoke curling around unspoken commandments. <words>186</words>
A curious girl offered him a cracked plastic mirror from the dress‑up box, mistaking his quest for a game of make‑believe. <words>207</words>
He accepted, and the reflection inside the toy unfurled snow‑white corridors leading beyond the greenhouse, beyond the Pole, toward an uncharted frontier of mind. <words>231</words>
Yet the corridor was barred by a question: Which heart would prove lighter than frost when weighed against ancient desert sun? <words>252</words>
Ellory knew the riddle demanded a sacrifice of certainty, the single thing his purposefully aimless life had none to spare. <words>272</words>
He turned to the children, whose innocent routine of slides and snow‑boots amid tomato stalks embodied motion without destination. <words>291</words>
As their mirrored doubles danced in the condensation‑fogged plexiglass, he realized transient play was the answer: directionless yet brimming with wonder. <words>312</words>
He pressed the coffin fragment to the toy mirror, and every child, reflection, and vine leaned inward as if preparing to cuddle dawn. <words>335</words>
The glass melted into liquid light, admitting a breeze carrying simultaneous scents of lotus and polar ozone, and the mage stepped through. <words>357</words>
Behind him the portal sealed, but a single seed from the greenhouse fluttered after, snagging in his cloak like a stowaway compass. <words>379</words>
Its dormant life promised that wherever Ellory arrived, the frontier would bloom, and history would trace back to a moment of playful mercy. <words>402</words>
In the greenhouse, the children resumed their games, carrying faint echoes of lotus wind in their laughter, never knowing they had rewritten destiny. <words>425</words>
