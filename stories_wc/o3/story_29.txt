<story>
Sir Riallan, a hopeful knight with cleverly naive faith in impossible turnabouts, crept through the sleeping city toward the hedge‑walled Royal Orchard.<words>22</words>
Only during the hush of a streetlamp flickering out did the maze‑gate shimmer open, revealing the mystic orchard garden concealed within.<words>43</words>
Fruit glowed with moonlike bruises, and branches whispered regrets they had absorbed from nighttime wanderers.<words>58</words>
At the garden’s twisted heart stood the Machine that Cycles Regrets, a copper leviathan whose gears ground memory into perpetual remorse.<words>79</words>
Riallan had come to sabotage it and thus reclaim the lost hopes of his kingdom.<words>94</words>
Yet no sword could wound gears forged from confessions, so he carried instead a single stray jigsaw edge stolen from the castle nursery.<words>117</words>
The puzzle piece resonated with every incomplete story in the realm, vibrating like a homesick tooth in his pocket.<words>136</words>
Legend claimed that any absence, if given the right contour, could neutralize its mirrored excess.<words>151</words>
To wield absence against regrets, Riallan had to act by syncing with cryptic frequencies thrumming beneath the orchard soil.<words>170</words>
Guided by cleverly naive optimism, he pressed the jigsaw edge to his breastbone and listened for the orchard’s clandestine chord.<words>190</words>
A shrill trio of notes—grief, yearning, jubilation—pierced him, aligning his heartbeat with their ragged tempo.<words>205</words>
Agonizing bliss flooded his veins, each throb both hurting and healing, as if regret itself apologized while twisting the knife.<words>225</words>
Now attuned, he stepped beneath the Machine, where condensations of lament dripped like oily dew.<words>240</words>
He slid the stray jigsaw edge between two singing cogs, its crooked teeth matching the absence left in the mechanic choir.<words>261</words>
Instantly, the gears chirred, then stalled, because the puzzle demanded the missing picture rather than perpetual rotation.<words>278</words>
Steam howled through copper lungs, projecting archived regrets into orchard air like torn banners burning in sunrise.<words>295</words>
Faces of lost children, squandered summers, and betrayed oaths wafted upward, dissolving against leaves that now glowed gentle gold.<words>314</words>
When the last specter popped like a soap bubble, silence settled, thicker than honey yet strangely breathable.<words>331</words>
Riallan expected triumph, but emptiness yawned where his lifelong regret had once kept him company.<words>346</words>
Remembering the orchard’s whispered promise, he knelt and planted the jigsaw edge like a seed, gifting the garden its first absence to grow.<words>369</words>
Roots of unimagined stories sprouted instantly, weaving through his armor, anchoring him as guardian of reclaimed hopes.<words>386</words>
He smiled, cleverly naive still, yet wiser, because reclaiming the lost sometimes meant surrendering the vacancy inside oneself.<words>404</words>
Beyond the maze, a new streetlamp flared alive, and the city exhaled, unaware that its regrets had already begun to forget returning.<words>426</words>
