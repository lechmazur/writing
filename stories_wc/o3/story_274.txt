After the final page is typed on a worn typewriter, the abandoned drive-in flickers back to half-life beneath a wheezing projector.<words>21</words>
I, a sentient houseplant rooted in a cracked popcorn cup, sense the stale air vibrating with stories nobody claims.<words>40</words>
My leaves droop with scalding ambivalence, apathetically devoted to photosynthesis yet starving for something brighter than the lot's neon ghosts.<words>60</words>
Tonight, a spontaneous decision to explore a new neighborhood rustles through my chlorophyll like wind in backstage curtains.<words>78</words>
I lever my pot onto an old speaker and outrun the moth-beaten shadows, rolling toward the silent concession stand.<words>97</words>
There, an embroidered bookmark protrudes from a sodden ledger, its scarlet thread glinting like a tongue daring someone to listen.<words>117</words>
I tug it free, and ink bleeds onto felt, forming letters that curl into hushed questions about tending to the unspoken.<words>138</words>
Hidden knowledge, it hints, grows where forgotten people once parked, their engines idling with secrets never ticketed by time's ushers.<words>158</words>
So I wheel myself between rusted speaker poles like a pilgrim, my soil sloshing, my purpose sprouting thorny impatience.<words>177</words>
The screen, peeled and sagging, becomes a lunar page onto which the bookmark projects shifting constellations of footnotes no author signed.<words>198</words>
I decipher the luminous marginalia, learning that silence is a library and every vacancy a shelf.<words>214</words>
Yet the revelations taste like dust, and my ambivalence hisses, unwilling to choose between root and rumor.<words>231</words>
Still, even apathetic devotion demands service, so I gather spilled soda syrup into my saucer, mixing it with projector light.<words>251</words>
I paint the bookmark's underside, sealing the inked questions like seeds inside a candy shell no rain can dissolve.<words>270</words>
Then I plant it upright in the concession stand's cracked tile, a flag for knowledge reluctant to declare war.<words>289</words>
Neon ghosts circle, reading the stitched patterns, and their murmurs condense into dew on my broadest leaf.<words>306</words>
Each droplet whispers a title, a plot, a confession, until my veins pulse with libraries I can never shelve.<words>325</words>
Ambivalence scalds hotter, for knowledge once hidden now clutters my photosynthetic circuits, crowding out the simple rhythm of light and water.<words>346</words>
I consider fleeing, but outrun is meaningless here; the bookmark's roots are my roots, sewn through the asphalt like capillaries.<words>366</words>
So I settle into reluctant stewardship, promising to tend to the unspoken, to leaf through every hush until daylight edits me away.<words>388</words>
Perhaps tomorrow, another wanderer will make a spontaneous decision to explore this dead neighborhood, and I will offer them dew-thin pages of everything their hearts misplace.<words>414</words>
Until then, I bask beneath the projector's ghost light, apathetically devoted, lovingly indifferent, a houseplant librarian blooming where no applause remains.<words>435</words>
