Dust spiraled in lazy halos as I began cleaning Uncle Vernon's garage on the afternoon gravity went wrong. <words>18</words>
The tools floated just inches above the pegboard, bobbing like timid fish, while nails clinked in softly audible chimes. <words>37</words>
A plaque by the door named the phenomenon a 'localized gravitational anomaly' and advised visitors not to panic. <words>55</words>
At seventeen I was the aloof orphan assigned to weekend chores, speaking mainly to dust motes and my own shadow. <words>75</words>
Panic, however, was my specialty since the orphanage fire, so I decided adaptation might replace it. <words>91</words>
Adapt or perish, that slogan from the psychology pamphlet, hummed through my head like a low voltage wire. <words>109</words>
Somewhere beneath the levitating rakes lay my collection of smooth stones, talismans I had carried from foster home to foster home. <words>130</words>
They reminded me that edges could be worn gentle, given time and motion. <words>143</words>
I reached, but the stones drifted upward, as though the air had loosened its grip on them. <words>160</words>
Loosen, I thought, is also what fear must do if courage is ever to take root. <words>176</words>
While shifting cardboard crates, my hand brushed a crumpled lottery ticket wedged behind a can of warped screws. <words>194</words>
Across its faded numbers, someone had scrawled a cryptic message: 'Stones map the fall when up becomes down.' <words>212</words>
The handwriting matched Uncle Vernon's spare capitals, but he had disappeared years ago during a similar cosmic hiccup. <words>230</words>
Affectionate detachment washed over me; I loved him for leaving clues, resented him for leaving me. <words>246</words>
I read the message again, then studied the orbiting stones, noticing their arrangement traced a loose spiral toward the ceiling vent. <words>267</words>
If the vent now functioned like a sinkhole of reversed gravity, perhaps escape lay in following the spiral. <words>285</words>
I stacked milk crates beneath the swirl, each crate hovering just long enough for me to step safely. <words>303</words>
The softly audible click of my stones colliding above urged me upward like distant applause. <words>318</words>
When my fingers reached the vent, I felt a draft pulling outward into a calm, star-salted night. <words>335</words>
The garage roof had somehow thinned into sky, physics loosening its bureaucratic hold for anyone brave enough to notice. <words>354</words>
I gathered the stones, now orbiting my wrist like patient moons, and stepped through the vent into weightless midnight. <words>373</words>
Fear fluttered but did not crash; it adapted, becoming a quiet engine pushing me toward whatever awaited beyond the anomaly. <words>393</words>
Somewhere below, the garage continued cleaning itself, objects rearranging in a softly audible ballet that promised future order. <words>411</words>
I let affectionate detachment widen my view, understanding at last that an orphan may loosen loneliness by orbiting something larger. <words>431</words>
Stones, tickets, gravity, and fear were only instructions: adapt or perish, love or drift, rise or rust among forgotten tools. <words>451</words>
With pockets full of smooth hope, I sailed onward, the softly audible world below still teaching as it receded. <words>470</words>
