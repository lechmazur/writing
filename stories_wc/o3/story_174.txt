Mist hung around the roaring cataract, veiling the entrance only wanderers with regrets perceived. <words>14</words>
Among them stepped Ari, a theoretically creative fireworks designer, whose career ranged wider than constellations. <words>29</words>
He traveled light, bearing a tin case holding his cherished collection of pressed leaves. <words>43</words>
Each leaf remembered a town where his spectacles once painted the sky, then fizzled into silence. <words>59</words>
The silence was his regret: a failed shell that dimmed a festival and a lover's smile. <words>75</words>
He had come to the hidden library in a waterfall to rewrite that night. <words>89</words>
Books glimmered behind curtains of spray, spines scintillating like damp scales of forgotten river gods. <words>104</words>
Ari flipped a brass lever, and the cascade parted, admitting him with the hush of conspiracy. <words>120</words>
Inside, shelves curved in spirals, forming subtle paths unfolding deeper than geometry acknowledged. <words>133</words>
He read these paths as if solving a familiar puzzle his hands already remembered. <words>147</words>
Yet instructions remained incomplete, whispering they could only be finished through the patterns in frost on a car window. <words>166</words>
The library's keeper, an eyeless heron carved from water, guided him to an overgrown garage upstream. <words>182</words>
There, winter's breath crystalized instantly, turning every pane into a secret manuscript of ice. <words>196</words>
Ari exhaled, letting his guilt mingle with vapors, and glyphs quickened across the windshield. <words>210</words>
Lines branched like fireworks mid-bloom, each node pointing toward reagents that would augment brilliance without devouring oxygen. <words>227</words>
He pressed his leaves onto the glass, tracing veins to match the icy constellations. <words>241</words>
Chlorophyll ghosts awakened, releasing scents of summers that had slipped within the ephemeral nature of time. <words>257</words>
The windshield glowed emerald, and the frost rearranged into a map of river, festival square, and forgiven heart. <words>275</words>
He memorized it, then pocketed the now translucently blank leaves, lighter than when collected. <words>289</words>
Night fell as he returned to the waterfall, stars echoing the design pulsing behind his eyes. <words>305</words>
Upon the cliffs he assembled mortars, powders, and a thimbleful of river mist for luck. <words>320</words>
The launch was silent, but the sky blossomed into leaf-shaped auroras mirroring every town he'd visited. <words>336</words>
Crowds miles away lifted faces, feeling remembered warmth though winter still clasped their coats. <words>350</words>
Among them, the lover whose smile had dimmed felt her regret dissolve into harmless sparks. <words>365</words>
Ari sensed the change like a click inside the familiar puzzle of his heart. <words>379</words>
The cascade shuddered open again, inviting him to shelve the frost-map as completed lore. <words>393</words>
He entered, but left the tin case outside, empty, so future paths might remain subtle. <words>408</words>
Water closed, cloaking the library, and dawn whispered promises he no longer needed to chase. <words>423</words>
Within the corridors of spray, ink rearranged itself, recording that even regrets can be redesigned. <words>438</words>
Outside, frost melted from the windshield, releasing the last spark into undefinable, forgiving air. <words>452</words>
