<story>
The floating island cloud gazing platform drifted above a cobalt abyss, trembling with fragile ferocity.<words>15</words>
On its misty edge stood Jora, the fervent caretaker of abandoned worlds, oddly faithful to every secret they whispered.<words>34</words>
Jora clutched a rustic spinning wheel rescued from a collapsing barn of timelines, fingers raw yet determined.<words>51</words>
The wheel, older than gravity, hummed whenever lies hovered nearby.<words>61</words>
Today its drone had become a wail, warning that the island itself was woven from deception.<words>77</words>
Jora's motive was clear: unmasking the truth and escaping the parallel dimension that had caged her devotion.<words>94</words>
Legends claimed a rupture could be found at the final step down a worn flight of stairs hidden beneath the clouds.<words>115</words>
To reach it, one must navigate the suspended terraces by following sun trails, beams that bent like golden rails at dusk.<words>136</words>
Jora waited until the horizon fired vermilion arrows, then stepped onto the first luminous ribbon.<words>151</words>
Each stride made the spinning wheel spin of its own accord, carding wind into coarse yarn that pointed forward.<words>170</words>
She realized the yarn was mapping the lies she needed to mangle before the exit would reveal itself.<words>188</words>
First came the illusion that the platform floated; in reality, titanic chains of memory anchored it to regret.<words>206</words>
Jora swung the wheel like a torch, and the forged yarn sliced the chains with a sighing spark.<words>224</words>
Next lingered the rumor that she served the island willingly; that thread strangled her ankles with velvet insistence.<words>242</words>
With fragile ferocity, she bit the yarn, bled belief, and spat defiance until the binding unraveled.<words>258</words>
The sun trails flickered, acknowledging each conquered falsehood, and guided her to a staircase carved from fading rainbows.<words>276</words>
She descended, counting her breaths against the wheel's pulse, a heartbeat echoing promises of elsewhere.<words>291</words>
Near the bottom, spectral wardens materialized, oddly faithful guardians of the constructed lie, their smiles stitched shut.<words>308</words>
They demanded she surrender the wheel, but surrender meant staying.<words>318</words>
Jora let memory of every orphaned realm flood her voice, and the wardens cracked like porcelain, truth seeping through.<words>337</words>
Shards fell away to reveal hollow costumes clutching dust; no real jailer remained.<words>350</words>
At the final step down a worn flight of stairs, the air folded, becoming a mirror made of dawn.<words>369</words>
Within it glimmered a portal trembling like freshly spun silk, but only if the next truth was spoken aloud.<words>388</words>
Jora whispered, 'I was caretaker, yet I, too, needed care,' and the mirror rippled, accepting her confession.<words>405</words>
The spinning wheel unraveled into light, weaving a bridge that stretched toward an unstained horizon.<words>420</words>
Jora stepped across, her fervent heart finally free to mend itself in a home where truth would not need disguises.<words>440</words>
Behind her, the floating island sighed and crumbled, its deception mangled beyond repair, scattering like chaff into the yawning sky.<words>460</words>
Only the sun trails remained, gleaming witnesses to a caretaker's oddly faithful journey toward unmasked dawns.<words>476</words>
