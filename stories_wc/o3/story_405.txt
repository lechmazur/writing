Keller Crane shuffled through the humid aisles of the underground mushroom farm, pretending the fluorescent spores were casino lights. <words>19</words>
He was a skeptical gambler by habit, yet tonight the stakes felt measured in grief rather than chips. <words>37</words>
Around his neck hung a sachet containing his prized collection of dried petals, crunchy echoes of lost gardens. <words>55</words>
Each brittle color reminded him of wagers he should never have placed and apologies never redeemed. <words>71</words>
He paced because a fresh delivery of spores was late, delaying the recipe testing scheduled for dawn. <words>88</words>
Testing mattered; the chefs aboveground needed mushroom textures that mimicked meat for stranded refugees craving familiar stews. <words>105</words>
Guiding those lost travelers to safety—and to nourishment—was the only wager Keller still felt honorable. <words>120</words>
Yet rumor said authorities planned to impound the entire crop, citing contamination nobody could actually verify. <words>136</words>
Keller needed information, and he sought it by interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats left by couriers. <words>153</words>
The scrawls formed riddles that shifted with station grime, but tonight they spelled a single directive: 'Lie truthfully.' <words>171</words>
Nobody understood the paradox better than Keller, whose poker face was sculpted from candor disguised as deceit. <words>188</words>
If inspectors came, he decided he would confess every violation, but number them backward, hiding reality inside arithmetic. <words>206</words>
That scheme calmed him, delivering a frantic peace like the hush before dice collide with felt. <words>222</words>
Suddenly a teenage apprentice burst between shelves, her boots splashing nutrient runoff. <words>234</words>
'Travelers are already descending the maintenance tunnel,' she gasped, 'but the city patrol follows—they smell rebellion.' <words>250</words>
Uncharted grief fluttered inside Keller like the petals when first plucked—an ache with no familiar map. <words>266</words>
He handed the apprentice his sachet, instructing her to scatter petals along junctions so refugees could follow scent. <words>284</words>
Their papery fragrance, he believed, would mask fungal odors and mislead patrol dogs clockwise instead of downwards. <words>301</words>
Meanwhile Keller marched to the freight elevator where inspectors idled, clipboard halos reflecting sterile flashlight beams. <words>317</words>
He greeted them with open ledgers and clearer conscience, ready to truthfully lie about every curve of commerce. <words>335</words>
His confession blossomed: he reported nonexistent shipments, recited reversed dates, and cited phantom almanacs detailing permissible spore decay. <words>353</words>
Baffled, the officials copied his statements verbatim, certain bureaucratic truth resided wherever paperwork felt most incomprehensible. <words>369</words>
While they debated, refugees traced the perfumed trail through chambers of violet caps and ivory stems toward daylight. <words>387</words>
Keller listened to distant footsteps rise like winning coins, and the farm, for a heartbeat, felt uncaged. <words>404</words>
He exhaled spores and secrets together, wagering that frantic peace is enough until the next reckless hand. <words>421</words>
