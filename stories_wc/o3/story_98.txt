Amid evening dog walking down the fog-smeared alleys of Greyminster, Halden, a fainthearted sentinel sworn to guard secrets he barely understood, felt the leash tug him toward the abandoned cathedral. <words>30</words>
It was there, beneath gargoyled spires, that he would attend the secret society initiation chamber hidden below the crypt, even while the collie sniffed gravestones with oblivious enthusiasm. <words>58</words>
The council allowed him to bring the dog as cover, asserting a pedestrian normalcy that clung to him like an ill-fitting cloak, an intimately distant reassurance. <words>84</words>
Still, his heart thudded louder than the dog's panting, aware that the chamber's promises of protection might be only the most ornate illusion of security yet woven. <words>111</words>
Halden descended a spiral stair lit by candles whose wax dripped like stalled minutes, each step measured with a plain plastic ruler pressed anxiously against his palm. <words>138</words>
The novices believed the ruler's centimarked certainty could verify safe distances between sigils, but Halden suspected the tool only comforted them, another shard in the mosaic of false assurances. <words>167</words>
Inside the subterranean hall, velvet banners muffled echoes, and a vast woven tapestry dominated the wall, its crimson and midnight threads coiling into labyrinthine shapes that seemed to drift when torches flickered. <words>199</words>
Elders claimed that by tracing passages through the patterns in a woven tapestry, acolytes could reach the repository of ancient writings hidden beyond ordinary sight. <words>224</words>
Halden’s motivation to learn these writings dwarfed his fears, because he believed the scrolls might reveal why a sentinel was posted at all if no real gates existed. <words>252</words>
Kneeling, he guided the dog's paw to the tapestry's lower edge, letting nose and instinct choose a path, an improvisation that felt both reckless and rightly guided. <words>279</words>
Thread by thread, they followed curling arcs depicting moons, crumbled towers, and watchmen without eyes; with each symbol passed, Halden’s sense of self seemed to drift into the woven night. <words>309</words>
Suddenly the tapestry billowed open like a curtain, revealing a narrow vestibule lined with mirrored script that rearranged its reflections to match the questions pounding inside his skull. <words>337</words>
He realized the writings could only be read while moving, letters stabilizing just long enough for meaning to emerge before sliding away, rendering knowledge intimately distant yet seductively near. <words>366</words>
As he and the dog paced the vestibule's length, sentences surfaced: 'Guardians are stationed not to secure thresholds, but to remind wanderers that thresholds are stories, and stories the truest locks.' <words>397</words>
Halden laughed, a sound fragile yet freeing, understanding at last that his faintheartedness had been the society's final test, and that the leash in his hand now led him outward, not back. <words>429</words>
