The meandering bard arrived at the foothills at dusk, eyes tracing the twisting staircases carved into the mountain-sized bookstore.<words>19</words>
Inside, aisles spiraled like ammonite shells, whispering paper corridors that folded reality with the delicacy of origami illusions.<words>37</words>
He searched not for tomes but for a tiny velvet box kept between sagas about kings who never existed.<words>56</words>
Within lay dentures rumored to belong to a famous figure, the long-deceased revolutionary humorist Faye Martello.<words>72</words>
The ivory arcs radiated warmth the way forgotten campfires glow in travelers’ memories, though no natural heat pulsed.<words>90</words>
That impossible sensation reminded the bard of why he wandered: to stir hearts grown cold, including his own.<words>108</words>
Yet the warmth felt fractured, an idyll cracked by regret lodged in his pocketed phone, unsent apology blinking.<words>126</words>
He had ghosted the florist of Port Remus after promising moonlit ballads; now silence gnawed heavier than loneliness.<words>144</words>
During the lull before that apologetic text is sent, the bard decided he must first earn the right.<words>162</words>
He would sow newfound empathy across the neighboring valleys using the only method authorities never censored.<words>178</words>
So he packed the legendary dentures, whose odd charisma made them ordinarily extraordinary, and descended toward seedy bars.<words>196</words>
There, beneath flickering neon, he staged subversive puppet shows starring a toothless marionette gifted with Martello’s biting satire.<words>214</words>
Whenever the puppet snapped the dentures, patrons felt invisible sparks dance between their ribs, thawing sorrows pickled in cheap gin.<words>234</words>
Laborers wept, gamblers hugged, and the bartender phoned her estranged sister, each act another seed in winter soil.<words>252</words>
News of the acts drifted back to the mountain bookstore like pollen, germinating legends among dust-coated scholars.<words>269</words>
Still, every closing curtain left the bard remembering the florist’s laugh, fragile as pressed petals.<words>284</words>
One rainy midnight, after a performance that emptied three bottles of regret from the room, he paused.<words>301</words>
The dentures, perched on the puppet’s jaw, seemed to mumble, 'Radiate outward, not inward,' in Martello’s absent lisp.<words>319</words>
Accepting the counsel, he climbed the silent alley stairs, lit only by guttering signage, and unlocked his phone.<words>337</words>
With thumbs trembling like novice lyre strings, he composed the overdue apology, each letter a puppet bowing toward forgiveness.<words>356</words>
Before pressing send, he tucked the dentures back into velvet, promising to return them to the mountain.<words>373</words>
He understood at last that stories, like teeth, must bite the world only to share sustenance, never to wound.<words>392</words>
Send was tapped, and warmth bloomed beyond him, echoing uphill through labyrinths of unwritten tomorrows.<words>407</words>
