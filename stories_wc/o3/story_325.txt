Steam curled above cloud-level verandas as the High Lamp Tea House prepared its vintage projector for tonight's peculiar feature. <words>19</words>
Dr. Calyx Mortimer, a mad botanist whose carnivorous plants often snacked on napkins, strode in, comically serious. <words>36</words>
The audience, mountaineers and monks alike, trusted him only until their tea cooled—such was the fickle loyalty aloft. <words>54</words>
Around his waist dangled a worn-out leather belt, its cracked surface etched with vine-shaped runes he refused to explain. <words>73</words>
Mortimer claimed the belt once cinched the robe of a gatekeeper who walked ancient pathways long before any map. <words>92</words>
Tonight, he whispered, the unexplained phenomena captured on celluloid would reveal where those pathways now hid among glaciers. <words>110</words>
The lights dimmed, bells chimed, and the reel whirred while snow hammered the paper walls like impatient fingers. <words>128</words>
Mortimer slipped behind the projector during intermission, timing his mischief between slurps of oolong and gossiping altitude sickness. <words>146</words>
He unspooled a hidden section in the black-and-white film reel, its frames coated with powdered chlorophyll and static electricity. <words>165</words>
When the projector resumed, the altered images ionized the air, turning the screen into a crackling green portal. <words>183</words>
Hisses rose from Mortimer's travel satchel as two carnivorous plants unfurled like umbrellas, their teeth reflecting the emerald glow. <words>202</words>
They swayed approvingly, yet everyone remembered yesterday when the same flora devoured the ticket stub boy's mittens. <words>219</words>
Mortimer addressed the room with academic gravity that bordered on slapstick, bowing so deeply his spectacles clinked the floorboards. <words>238</words>
"Observe," he announced, "the gate appears only to those wearing genuine doubt—remove certainty as you would muddy boots." <words>256</words>
The monks chuckled, the mountaineers scoffed, and loyalty shuffled seats as quickly as chairs scraped the cedar planks. <words>274</words>
Only Mei, an apprentice tea server, noticed the portal dimming whenever skepticism surged, brightening when wonder returned. <words>291</words>
Guided by instinct and a tray of unclaimed cups, she stepped forward, her boots squeaking like anxious field mice. <words>310</words>
Mortimer looped his cracked belt around the nearest plant's stalk, forming a living lasso, and offered the other end to Mei. <words>331</words>
His tone suggested filial devotion, yet his eyes measured whether she'd make decent fertilizer should alliances pivot mid-journey. <words>349</words>
Mei accepted, because ancient pathways promised escape from tray carrying, even if reached by dubious photosynthetic chaperones. <words>366</words>
Together they stepped through the ionized curtain, sparks tasting like lemon on their tongues, snow gusts instantly muting behind. <words>385</words>
Outside lay a staircase of suspended ice slabs, each slab stamped with cinematographic frames of forgotten civilizations. <words>402</words>
Mortimer's plants led the climb, gnawing footholds, while Mei balanced tea cups as offerings to whatever doors awaited. <words>420</words>
Behind them, loyalty rewound like film, and the tea house patrons debated which story to believe once the projector sputtered. <words>440</words>
