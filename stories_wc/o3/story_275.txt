Ashen mist clung to the ghostly orchard as a burning comet smeared scarlet across the twilight. <words>16</words>
Within the pallid rows drifted a mysterious hermit, theoretically rebellious yet quiet as root-rot, backpack creaking. <words>32</words>
He journeyed throughout moving from tree to tree, gauging the lifeless soil with patient toes. <words>47</words>
His motivation, fiercer than the comet’s blaze, was to coax life from barren ground that villagers had abandoned. <words>65</words>
Under one crooked apple skeleton, he unwrapped a pressed flower album bound in cracked green leather. <words>81</words>
Each paper page carried blossoms the color of sunrise, catalogued with symbols only he could translate. <words>97</words>
The symbols were decisions, sketches of mindful choices made by extinct gardeners who once shaped this land. <words>114</words>
To resurrect their intent, the hermit needed the orchard itself to speak in that forgotten dialect. <words>130</words>
He set a rusted tripod at the hill’s center and mounted a half-bent weathervane salvaged from a roof. <words>148</words>
Then he waited until the comet’s tail aligned via the exact angle of a half-bent weathervane. <words>164</words>
At that intersection of falling fire and iron pointer, dried petals rustled like turning pages. <words>179</words>
The orchard breathed, exhaling phosphorescent dust that circled the album as though eager to be read. <words>195</words>
Kneeling, the hermit whispered the first glyph, translating it into sound by striking a pruning hook against stone. <words>213</words>
A nearby trunk sprouted translucent leaves, fragile but quivering with nascent chlorophyll. <words>225</words>
Mindful choices, he recalled, were never loud; each act must ring deliberate wilderness rather than manic cultivation. <words>242</words>
The second glyph required sacrifice, so he sliced his thumb and let a single drop darken the drought-cracked earth. <words>261</words>
Roots followed the blood like thirsty worms, knitting soil that had been powder hours earlier. <words>276</words>
Throughout moving constellations of dust, the comet pulsed brighter, as if applauding rebellion achieved through patience. <words>292</words>
Yet the hermit’s theoretically rebellious heart measured victory not in spectacle but in seeds he could now press for future albums. <words>313</words>
He harvested only thirteen buds, an odd prime to honor the math of uncertainty, and sealed them under waxed parchment. <words>333</words>
Before dawn, villagers drawn by the comet ventured back and found saplings shimmering where rot had ruled. <words>350</words>
They saw no hermit, only a pressed flower album resting against the tripod, its pages blank and waiting. <words>368</words>
Inside the cover, an inscription glowed: 'Choose carefully, translate kindly, grow deliberately,' letters forming as dew condensed. <words>385</words>
The hesitant villagers debated burning the witchcraft, but mindful choices stirred in them like sap, and fear receded. <words>403</words>
Led by a child who touched the blank page and smelled spring, they planted the thirteen buds along the orchard’s edge. <words>424</words>
Silver morning mist rose, weaving with comet smoke, and new leaves mirrored both skyfire and soilshadow in deliberate wilderness harmony. <words>444</words>
Far beyond, the hermit walked on, translating wind direction into future gardens, guided always via the exact angle of a half-bent weathervane. <words>466</words>
