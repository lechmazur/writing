Rain fizzed like static over the neon gutters of the futuristic city slums, rewriting puddles into restless mirrors. <words>18</words>
Through them I watched unfamiliar reflections drift past, never aligning with the faces they supposedly belonged to, including my own. <words>38</words>
I, Kestrel, a lovelorn spy, had come here chasing both a ghost and a girl. <words>53</words>
She called herself Pepper, wore a curiously indifferent smile, and preferred rooftops to restaurants. <words>67</words>
Our dossiers claimed her recipe codes could crash satellites, yet our shared interest in urban exploration kept me hopeful. <words>86</words>
Hope, unfortunately, is the thinnest armor when headquarters orders you to outrun the unstoppable avalanche called Revelation. <words>103</words>
Revelation was the leak that would expose every covert romantic message I ever folded between purchase orders. <words>120</words>
So I trekked the gutter labyrinth with one safeguard: an unused sticky label bearing Pepper's retinal encryption. <words>137</words>
If attached to any surface, it would rewrite surveillance feeds for exactly fifty heartbeats, a temporary amnesty. <words>154</words>
Pepper waited beneath a magnetic bridge where vending drones discharged spicy steam into the midnight air. <words>170</words>
She balanced a saucepan on a cracked battery pack, mumbling measurements like prayer while I approached. <words>186</words>
Her new recipe, she whispered, would taste exactly like the memory of missing someone before you've met. <words>203</words>
I laughed too loudly, then felt the avalanche rumbling through my earpieceâ€”headquarters gloating about imminent data ruptures. <words>220</words>
Their gloat cracked the night like distant thunder, reminding me my seconds with her were numbered in single digits. <words>239</words>
Pepper, curiously indifferent, handed me a single tasting spoon before the saucepan even simmered. <words>253</words>
She said destiny was rambling, not linear, and flavors should arrive early to teach patience. <words>268</words>
At the instant a new recipe is finally tasted, she promised, time itself becomes edible. <words>283</words>
I swallowed, discovering saffron, static, and the ache of faces reflected where no person stood. <words>298</words>
Unfamiliar reflections bloomed around us, showing two possibilities: one where we ran together, another where only I escaped. <words>316</words>
Choosing felt like holding both snow and fire, yet the avalanche hissed closer, carrying dossiers like tumbling ice. <words>334</words>
I slapped the unused sticky label onto the saucepan, and the bridge cameras smeared into harmless static. <words>351</words>
Pepper grabbed my hand and jumped, laughing that spies talk too much about avalanches and never enough about rooftops. <words>370</words>
As we landed on corrugated tin, the reflections chose for us, collapsing into a single trail of bright footprints leading away. <words>391</words>
We followed, tasting aftershocks of her recipe on our tongues, certain destiny would ramble but never again lose our scent. <words>411</words>
Behind us, the avalanche struck the bridge, yet the city heard only the hum of two hearts recalibrating. <words>429</words>
