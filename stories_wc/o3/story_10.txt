<story>
Dust-shrouded crates lined the corridors of the abandoned spaceport customs office, like tombstones awaiting inscription.<words>15</words>
In that silent maze, a cheerless duelist named Merek Grey carried a maggoty wooden chest that rattles.<words>32</words>
Its hinges oozed larvae that pulsed to rhythms only regret could hear.<words>44</words>
Merek sought a hacker-priest rumored to live amid the hum of server rooms beneath the docking bay.<words>61</words>
The priest alone, legends claimed, could elasticize memories locked inside the cursed chest.<words>74</words>
Merek hoped those memories might reveal how to learn the power of forgiveness before his own blade found him.<words>93</words>
For every opponent fallen to his flawless footwork, a mirror in his mind recorded fatal flaws he refused to face.<words>113</words>
The corridor lights flickered, casting codes of shadow across antique passport scanners like confessionals without priests.<words>129</words>
He pressed onward, his steps precisely innovative, each shift of weight calculated to silence creaking floorplates.<words>145</words>
Fighting had taught him geometry; remorse had taught him that angles alone could not chart a heart.<words>162</words>
Behind a cracked security door, processors thrummed like distant seas, and incense of burned coolant stung his nostrils.<words>180</words>
The hacker-priest emerged, robes sewn from ethernet cables, eyes phosphorescent with sleepless code.<words>193</words>
Without greeting, the priest gestured to a biometric altar fashioned from retired turnstiles and asked for the chest.<words>211</words>
Merek surrendered it, feeling grub larvae writhe against his palms like unfinished apologies.<words>224</words>
The priest cracked the lid, whispered algorithms, and steam of rotting cedar filled the room with ancestral kitchens.<words>242</words>
Recipes scrolled across the air—soups, stews, confections—yet every flavor profile had mutated in impossible directions.<words>257</words>
The priest explained that the duelist's lineage experimented through unexpected mutations of family recipes, turning comfort food into weapons.<words>276</words>
Each dish encoded a stance, each garnish a parry, until forgiveness starved among salt and steel.<words>292</words>
To redeem himself, Merek must taste the corrupted broth and survive its hallucinated duel against his younger self.<words>310</words>
He drank; spices became specters, ladles spun into sabers, and the server-room hum blended with his pounding pulse.<words>328</words>
The vision showed him slashing at friends who had begged him to stay, their tears seasoning the arena floor.<words>347</words>
Kneeling beside their echoes, he at last whispered apologies and felt their outlines elasticize, stretching into forgiving light.<words>365</words>
When the vision faded, the chest lay still, its maggots cocooned into quiet moths of cedar scent.<words>382</words>
The hacker-priest bowed, acknowledging a bittersweet reckoning accomplished without swords.<words>392</words>
Merek, unburdened, offered his blade to the turnstile altar, leaving the office lighter than departing refugees.<words>408</words>
Outside, dawn leaked through shattered skylights, and while the spaceport remained dead, possibility rustled like wings learning to fly.<words>427</words>
