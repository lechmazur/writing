Moonlit fog clung to the abandoned carnival ship drifting in a foggy bay, groaning like rusted calliope pipes.<words>18</words>
Among warped carousels slept Orrin, a sleepy stablehand from inland farms, furloughed after horses vanished.<words>33</words>
He had come seeking fierce repose, not adventure, but dreams in the ruins nibbled his eyelids.<words>49</words>
Each night he opened crates of censored books once used to amuse prohibitionist tourists.<words>63</words>
Refusing sequential order, he chose random lines, letting the ship lamps flicker redacted paragraphs into stuttering constellations.<words>80</words>
Whenever a forbidden phrase glimmered, the air would warp like heated glass, revealing corridors never charted.<words>96</words>
Orrin's shyly unstoppable curiosity pulled him through these apertures, brass magnifier clenched like a monocular shield.<words>112</words>
He inspected peeling murals of acrobats, and every scratch widened into a memory of forgotten laughter.<words>128</words>
One corridor opened onto the half-flooded cinema where traveling film clubs had once screened newsreels for sailors.<words>145</words>
Projectors stood silent, yet Orrin could feel reels spinning throughout film clubs engraved in the damp walls.<words>162</words>
He read a random caption—'Beauty hides behind boarded windows'—and the theater seats blossomed into velvet orchids.<words>178</words>
A hush, both fierce and gentle, settled on him; he had found beauty in an unexpected place.<words>195</words>
The orchids exhaled golden spores that mapped a path toward the aft funhouse, shimmering like a promise.<words>212</words>
Following it, he stepped over collapsed mirrors reflecting versions of himself still napping in stables miles away.<words>229</words>
Each reflection whispered, 'Sleep, servant,' yet his motive, to find beauty in unexpected places, steeled his spine.<words>246</words>
Inside the funhouse, censored books hung from strings like lanterns, pages fluttering with encoded wind.<words>261</words>
He read another stray line: 'Ruins remember who listens,' and the ship groaned an eager, answering chord.<words>278</words>
Deck plates lifted, revealing a spiral staircase descending beneath the bay's gray skin.<words>291</words>
Orrin descended, the brass magnifier now glowing like a miniature lighthouse in his calloused palm.<words>306</words>
At the bottom lay a submerged stable, horses sculpted of barnacles pawing at invisible ground, waiting for care.<words>324</words>
The sleepy stablehand within him stirred fully awake, touched by impossible loyalty of sea-born beasts.<words>339</words>
He raised the magnifier, and its lens focused moonlight down through water, turning brine into gentle straw.<words>356</words>
Barnacle horses munched; their eyes brightened, and the staircase quivered like a contented flank.<words>370</words>
In that click of hooves, Orrin sensed the shyly unstoppable power of tending forgotten wonder.<words>385</words>
The magnifier pulsed, and the carnival ship began rising, shedding fog as curtains unveil dawn.<words>400</words>
Ruins rearranged into glimmering arcades; dreams in the ruins had become architecture for the waking world.<words>416</words>
Above deck, retired projectors illuminated clouds, screening silent epics to gulls who flapped like applauding patrons.<words>432</words>
Throughout film clubs of future harbors, storytellers would recall the night a sleepy stablehand warped despair into spectacle.<words>450</words>
And whenever longing pitched its tent in any abandoned heart, his tale would offer fierce repose.<words>466</words>
