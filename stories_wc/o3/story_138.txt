In the spontaneous combustion lab hid Lysandra Vane, a forgotten noble whose title had evaporated like the experimental fuels she once sponsored.<words>22</words>
Now she spent her nights listening for the dangerous hiss of misfires and the even quieter crackle of her own hollow recklessness.<words>44</words>
Between text messages from debt collectors, she drafted a plan to fortify her name against oblivion.<words>60</words>
The scheme began with an artificial hummingbird drone salvaged from the palace aviary auction and still wearing flecks of gilt.<words>80</words>
Its wings fluttered in a rhythm so precisely mechanical that their beauty became mysteriously obvious, like an admission whispered loudly.<words>100</words>
Candor in small moments, Lysandra believed, could slice deeper than grand confessions, so she programmed the drone to carry slivers of truth.<words>122</words>
Those slivers would be forged through the reassembly of old ticket stubs collected from every gala that had once applauded her lineage.<words>144</words>
She sorted the brittle paper by torchlight, reading fading ink that bragged of coronations, ballets, and scientific fetes now erased from memory.<words>166</words>
Each stub became a feather, lacquered with conductive resin, until the drone's body gleamed like a confession stitched from her past.<words>187</words>
When the hummingbird finally rose, it sang not with music but with projected holograms of those catalogued evenings, exposing illusions of nobility.<words>209</words>
Guests who saw the spectacle gasped, believing a ghostly archivist hovered above them, unmasking their complicity in Lysandra's erasure.<words>228</words>
Yet she watched remotely, pausing only when her phone buzzed another threat, the momentary interval between text messages giving her courage.<words>249</words>
The drone's recordings streamed back to the lab, revealing powerful faces collapsing at the sight of their youthful signatures fluttering in digital fire.<words>272</words>
With every clip, Lysandra fortified her archive, layering undeniable evidence that titles and fortunes were flammable myths kindled by collective pretense.<words>293</words>
Still, she felt the hollowness of victory; the recklessness remained, echoing in the hiss of nearby test chambers waiting to ignite.<words>314</words>
To temper that emptiness, she opened the lab's blast door and invited riotous wind, letting ashes of burnt experiments swirl among resurrected memories.<words>337</words>
In the maelstrom the drone perched on her shoulder, its optics reflecting flames and ticket numbers, a mysteriously obvious herald of unvarnished history.<words>360</words>
Lysandra spoke aloud, trusting the lab microphones to scatter her words across unsecure channels.<words>374</words>
Let the kingdom remember me, she declared, not as heir, but as ember carving patterns of truth.<words>391</words>
Some illusions require polite silence; mine required fireflies of data, and I bred them here.<words>406</words>
