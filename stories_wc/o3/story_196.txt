The breakroom smelled of burnt tea and resignation, even though Brother Kesh had quit only minutes earlier.<words>17</words>
I slumped on the lacquered bench, a tired swordsman more ragged than the brooms propped in corners.<words>34</words>
My fiercely apathetic eyes traced the drifting chalk dust, pretending the motes were stars I once chased.<words>51</words>
Across the table waited a plain cloth bag that should have looked ordinary but glowed with memories.<words>68</words>
Inside lay the shard of meteor glass I harvested during the Perseid vigil atop the southern skystone.<words>85</words>
Master Ojen once told me the monastery itself floated because our hearts anchored elsewhere.<words>99</words>
Yet her resignation letter, still curling in the incense heat, proved even anchors choose to drift.<words>115</words>
She had begged me to leave too, claiming the Order would dull my edge beyond honing.<words>131</words>
I answered with a shrug, the spark of defiance flickering behind layers of practiced boredom.<words>146</words>
For years that spark had survived famine sieges and philosophical sermons, hidden from everyone, especially myself.<words>162</words>
Its fuel was a promise whispered into sword steel the night meteors first painted the sky.<words>178</words>
I would protect wonder wherever it fell, even if wonder eventually wore my face.<words>192</words>
But fatigue settles like rust, and today I felt more scabbard than blade.<words>205</words>
The ceiling gong chimed end‑of‑shift, echoing against sheer air outside the monastery’s hovering verandas.<words>219</words>
I lifted the cloth bag, its weight politely impossible, reminder that miracles demand to be carried.<words>235</words>
Brother Venn poked his head in, asking if I'd seen the deserter; I answered with practiced indifference.<words>252</words>
He left, satisfied, never noticing the meteor shard twinkle through the bag’s thin weave.<words>266</words>
Opportunity drifted behind him like a door left modestly ajar.<words>276</words>
I remembered Master Ojen’s mantra: overcome, not by striking harder, but by following meteor showers.<words>291</words>
To follow meant leaving before inertia realized I was moving.<words>301</words>
I cinched my scabbard, hid the bag under my cloak, and stepped onto the western balcony.<words>317</words>
Night had climbed unnoticed, strewing velvet over the ragged heap of clouds below the rocks.<words>332</words>
First streak, then second, then a cascade of silver nails scratched the heavens open.<words>346</words>
The Perseids were early, or perhaps my longing warped the calendar.<words>357</words>
Either way, their trajectory pointed north, toward the valley where children rumored a fallen star healed curses.<words>374</words>
I had no curses, only promise, but promise can sting like any ailment if ignored.<words>389</words>
So I stepped off the balcony edge and let the wind grab my coat like a reluctant kite.<words>407</words>
The monastery bells tolled alarm, but sound thinned with distance, and soon only meteor song accompanied me downward.<words>425</words>
I was still tired, still apathetic on the surface, yet the spark inside burned with knowing naivety.<words>442</words>
It trusted impossible physics, fragile rocks, and a promise no resignation letter could ever countermand.<words>457</words>
Below, the valley lights widened like welcoming eyes, and I gripped the cloth bag, ready to land and protect wonder again.<words>478</words>
