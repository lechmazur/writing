Marigold Finch, a ruthless flower arranger known for pruning bouquets with a surgeon’s impatience, agreed to coach me on art theory only if I chauffeured her to a mysterious stone circle at dusk. <words>33</words>
She claimed the granite glyphs there murmured melodies inaudible to anyone who had never trimmed a rose until it bled, and that tonight we would hear them in the pause between a singer’s verses. <words>67</words>
Our vehicle was a dented hatchback strewn with petals, notebooks, and a scuffed plastic comb Marigold used like a conductor’s baton whenever her ideas became too intellectually spontaneous to stay inside her skull. <words>100</words>
We traveled south on empty highways, distinguishing mirages from genuine silhouettes of cattle through spontaneous road trip conversations that zigzagged from ancient pigments to floral ligatures to whether silence itself can bruise. <words>132</words>
Marigold insisted that the watcher’s burden is learning to distinguish which visions demand arrangement and which must rot untouched, a doctrine she said I would grasp once the stones confronted me. <words>163</words>
When we arrived, twilight draped the ring like lavender chiffon, and a busker practising nearby lent us his speaker so a looping ballad could time our investigation. <words>190</words>
Each time the singer inhaled for the next lyric, the music fell silent, and in that thin hush Marigold thrust my fingers toward the petroglyphs, commanding me to feel rather than see. <words>222</words>
Cold ridges pulsed like heartbeats, and somewhere above the clouds I sensed bouquets being clipped, as if eternity itself were her private arrangement table. <words>246</words>
Still, the glyphs refused to translate until the busker’s chorus fractured; in that pause Marigold snapped the comb’s teeth against the stone, producing a staccato clatter of polite anarchy. <words>275</words>
Echo danced between pillars, and suddenly I could distinguish spirals of ochre as coordinates, dots as star dates, lines as a map of migrations that matched the cattle silhouettes we’d debated on the road. <words>309</words>
The revelation hit me with the watcher’s burden—the knowledge that to know is to guard, prune, and sometimes sacrifice the bloom of wonder so others may someday inhale it unharmed. <words>339</words>
Marigold, satisfied, pocketed the scuffed plastic comb like a bloodied scalpel and whispered that my apprenticeship was complete once I could arrange silence around a truth without clipping its petals. <words>369</words>
She scattered leftover lilies across the circle, each bloom falling precisely on a coordinate I’d decoded, transforming the archaeological grid into the world’s most transient bouquet. <words>395</words>
Then, before the singer resumed his verse, we left in quiet conspiracy, our headlights carving tunnels in the dark as Marigold planned which ancient mystery to prune next. <words>423</words>
