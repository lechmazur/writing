Pablo Mendez, a jaded locksmith, always scheduled his rooftop rounds during painting hour, when the colonial town below was distracted by sunset murals.<words>23</words>
Tonight he carried a pair of embroidered gloves whose scarlet vines concealed lockpicks finer than threads of silk.<words>41</words>
The gloves were a gift from the late Queen Alcira, whose unclaimed throne had left the entire realm tasting betrayal like copper.<words>63</words>
Pablo never forgot that her last command, murmured while palace keys jingled in his palm, was to preserve hunting methods older than gunpowder.<words>86</words>
The labyrinth orchard built across the tiled roofs was his secret archive, its apple trees grafted into walls like living manuals of stealth and pursuit.<words>111</words>
He slipped among branches and chimneys with delightfully menacing grace, scent of green apples meant to permeate the alleys and mask his passage.<words>134</words>
Yet tonight's real test would not be metal or fruit but clay, for he had agreed to meet his only rival at a pottery class.<words>159</words>
Nieves Duarte, painter of official banners, claimed that whoever molded the royal seal from the orchard's soil could claim the empty crown.<words>181</words>
Pablo's demure audacity forced him to smile politely while planning silent sabotage.<words>193</words>
Under lamplight, wheels spun and wet clay hissed, and the locksmith pretended his gloved fingers were harmless artisans rather than tools of inheritance.<words>216</words>
Nieves shaped a coiling serpent symbolizing the ancestral hunt, unaware that Pablo had laced the water basin with seeds from the orchard's fasting apples.<words>240</words>
When the clay cooled, the seeds would split and devour moisture, cracking the serpent and any claim to rule.<words>259</words>
Meanwhile, Pablo molded a modest apple blossom, its petals framing a hidden map of locks that could open every hunting lodge in the kingdom.<words>283</words>
The instructor praised his restraint, mistaking his quiet for humility instead of the taut wire between loyalty and treason.<words>302</words>
As night drummed on the terracotta shingles, the pottery was set to dry upon the highest pergola of the orchard.<words>322</words>
Pablo lingered, letting moonlight silver the embroidered gloves while he activated their hidden picks to unlock the pergola's iron gate.<words>342</words>
He switched the drying plaques, leaving his blossom to be judged royal and hiding the fractured serpent inside a thorny branch where only sparrowhawks roosted.<words>367</words>
The scent of fasting apples began to permeate the pergola, promising a shatter that would echo like musket fire at dawn.<words>388</words>
By the time Nieves returned, whatever throne she imagined would be dust, and the locksmith's antiquated chase would survive another generation.<words>409</words>
Below, townsfolk cheered fresh murals, never suspecting that up among the branches a delightfully menacing blossom now waited to crown a hunter, not a king.<words>434</words>
