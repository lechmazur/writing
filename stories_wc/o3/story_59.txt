Moonlight seeped through cracked skylights, silvering the government's forgotten echo chamber testing site. <words>13</words>
Lysander, a mournful troubadour with calloused fingers and hollow eyes, stepped inside alone. <words>26</words>
His only adornment was the embroidered collar his vanished lover once stitched in dusk. <words>40</words>
Threaded roses grazed his throat like questions left unanswered. <words>49</words>
He had journeyed here amid silent struggles the world never noticed or applauded. <words>62</words>
Rumor claimed the chamber could record even memories, then play them back as breathable echoes. <words>77</words>
Lysander's purpose was clear: to discover the heartbeat of nothingness before dawn erased it. <words>91</words>
Intimate detachment steadied him, a practiced distance learned from serenading funeral processions without weeping. <words>105</words>
Yet the corridor's hush felt strangely predictable, as though fate repeated a verse already sung. <words>120</words>
Fluorescent arrows on peeling walls glowed like artificial constellations, urging him deeper underground. <words>133</words>
He decided to navigate not by them but by following star trails remembered from desert tours. <words>149</words>
Above the roof, real Orion drifted, invisible to the facility yet mapped inside his skull. <words>164</words>
Each bend he took matched a celestial angle, demystifying the labyrinth through astronomy's quiet arithmetic. <words>179</words>
Soon he reached the primary chamber, a spherical vault lined with microphones like metallic lilies. <words>194</words>
The door closed of its own accord, and his pulse reverberated, multiplied into ghostly choirs. <words>209</words>
Lysander strummed his lute softly, offering the room a minor progression he once wrote for her. <words>225</words>
The sound returned layered with whispers: childhood laughter, tavern applause, a sob the night she disappeared. <words>241</words>
Confronting the past was never his plan, yet the chamber insisted on full recollection. <words>255</words>
He listened until remorse dulled, then sang the lullaby she taught--notes drifting like pale feathers. <words>270</words>
Microphones captured the melody and responded with a hush so deep it seemed solid. <words>284</words>
Within that hush pulsed a faint rhythm, the elusive heartbeat of nothingness he had pursued. <words>299</words>
It throbbed between syllables, equal parts presence and void, persuading him to remove the collar. <words>314</words>
He laid the embroidered collar upon the cold floor, hoping the fabric might answer the silence. <words>330</words>
The room absorbed the gesture, then projected a final echo: her voice saying, 'Forgive the leaving'. <words>346</words>
Tears threatened, but his intimate detachment returned, oddly tender, letting sorrow flow without drowning him. <words>361</words>
The strangely predictable corridor lights blinked twice, signaling it was time to exit into unfinished night. <words>377</words>
Lysander reclaimed the collar, now weightless, and left the chamber, carrying the demystified rhythm inside. <words>392</words>
Outside, dawn diluted the stars, yet an inaudible cadence guided him forward, forgiving, unafraid. <words>406</words>
His quest to demystify grief felt lighter now, like a melody minus its ache. <words>420</words>
