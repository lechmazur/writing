Neon drizzle hissed over the rooftop garden, turning every leaf into a circuit‑flecked mirror.<words>14</words>
Among the bioluminescent apple trees stood Orrin, the solemn orchardist nobody in the megablock remembered.<words>29</words>
His gloved hand cradled a plain key that gleamed only when the skyline blinked.<words>43</words>
Each blink felt like the hush between two heartbeats, as if time stuttered just for him.<words>59</words>
He waited for someone, though protocol warned that waiting was inefficient bandwidth.<words>71</words>
Below, elevator shafts pulsed with courier drones and gossiping adverts, yet the garden remained a whisper.<words>87</words>
The whisper belonged to Kira, an overlooked child whose scrapyard laughter could override any firewall.<words>102</words>
She arrived late, her boots too big and her questions endearingly irritating to every adult except Orrin.<words>119</words>
Kira tossed him a glitchy smile and produced a paper ledger, the kind the city tried to x‑out.<words>137</words>
On its margin she had drawn crossing lines, mapping how rooftop water lines fed alley mushrooms which fed market noodles: her proof that lives were interconnected.<words>163</words>
Orrin saw himself sketched as a small trunk, unnoticed but supporting luminous fruit nodes.<words>177</words>
He felt the excited restraint of a sapling about to split concrete.<words>189</words>
Still, he only nodded, because grownups in Kira’s world often talked the bloom off possibilities.<words>204</words>
Instead he offered the plain key.<words>210</words>
Kira’s eyes widened like freshly rebooted lenses.<words>217</words>
He whispered that it opened the irrigation mainframe hidden beneath the oldest apple trunk.<words>231</words>
With it, she could reroute water to seedlings in abandoned terraces, nurturing children who planted them.<words>247</words>
Connection, he murmured, grows where circuits cannot.<words>254</words>
Kira hugged him with the sudden ferocity of a download, then pulled back, embarrassed by her own enthusiasm.<words>272</words>
Her endearingly irritating habit of tapping every surface resumed as she calculated flow rates aloud.<words>287</words>
Orrin chuckled, a sound so rare it startled a perch of synthetic sparrows into flight.<words>302</words>
For an instant the hush between two heartbeats returned, and in it they understood their pact.<words>318</words>
Tomorrow the city would still misplace children, still compress emotions into emojis, still x‑out paper, but water would remember their signatures.<words>339</words>
Orrin watched Kira sprint toward the access hatch, ledger under arm, key clutched like a seed.<words>355</words>
He tidied fallen petals, x‑ing out rot before it spread, the way guardians erase loneliness.<words>370</words>
Rain intensified, drumming encrypted rhythms onto the polyglass, yet his orchard felt uncharacteristically online.<words>384</words>
Via interconnected lives, a simple turning of a key had upgraded hope’s network latency.<words>398</words>
Orrin exhaled, letting the neon drizzle pollinate his silent smile.<words>408</words>
