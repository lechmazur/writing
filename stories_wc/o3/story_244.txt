The final petal dropped from the old rosebush outside, and Rika knew the appointed evening had arrived. <words>17</words>
She locked the fading garden behind her and slipped into the alley toward Yun's Neon Revival, the only repair shop still buzzing this late. <words>41</words>
Inside, coils of glass tube glowed like captive auroras, washing the cluttered space in blues and violent pinks. <words>59</words>
The mellow blaze steadied her pulse, though guilt still clung to her sword arm like invisible iron. <words>76</words>
Two moons ago she had cut down her own mentor in a duel over forbidden cartography, and every breath since tasted of rust. <words>99</words>
Now she pursued redemption, reservedly bold, willing to speak only when words served the blade of purpose. <words>116</words>
Behind the counter sat three halfâ€‘truth historians, itinerant scholars who bartered rumors for spare bulbs and sodium gas. <words>134</words>
Rika had traced them across provinces, gleaning secrets from their fragmentary tales the way a jeweler pans for specks of gold. <words>155</words>
Tonight she carried her final bargaining chip: a tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings, rumored to map the hinges of the door of release. <words>178</words>
Its wooden planes twisted under the neon glow, so that corridors seemed to open and collapse within each shadowed groove. <words>198</words>
The eldest historian, a woman named Miren, adjusted cracked goggles and whispered that beyond the mask stood choices that could not be unchosen. <words>221</words>
Rika replied that some doors must open anyway, because closed corridors only echo regret. <words>235</words>
Satisfied, the trio unpacked a brittle parchment, half legend, half circuit diagram, sketching how the mask aligned with a hidden latch behind the shop's signyard wall. <words>261</words>
But the mechanism would awaken only after the rosebush's last sigh, which, they noted, had already passed outside her garden gate. <words>282</words>
Hope and dread braided within her as she followed them through a corridor lined by inert neon dragons awaiting repair. <words>302</words>
They stopped before a rusted steel panel, its screws arranged like compass points around a dim letter R. <words>320</words>
Rika fitted the tribal mask over the panel, the carvings snapping onto the screws as though remembering an old embrace. <words>340</words>
Light seeped through the wooden labyrinth, tracing miniature paths that converged at the mouth of the letter, which yawned open with a hiss like severed bamboo. <words>366</words>
Beyond stretched a stairwell of soft darkness punctuated by distant wind chimes no hand had struck. <words>382</words>
Her sword tremored against her hip, reminding her of the blood it had tasted, reminding her why she must keep walking. <words>403</words>
Miren offered a lantern, but Rika declined, embracing the reserved boldness that lives in quiet hearts yet burns hotter than any tube of noble gas. <words>428</words>
She stepped through, feeling the mellow intensity of the shop give way to something vaster, an abyss humming with possibility instead of accusation. <words>451</words>
The door of release sighed shut behind her, sealing guilt on one side and uncharted mornings on the other. <words>470</words>
