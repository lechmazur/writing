After the last human dream was dreamt, Ranger Tamsin patrolled the urban orchard crowning Interstate 9.<words>16</words>
She was overzealous by policy and by pulse, cataloging every blossom as if it might rebel.<words>32</words>
The cracked concrete still shimmered with faded lane paint, yet apples now replaced exhaust in the repurposed overpass air.<words>51</words>
In her plain notebook she logged sap density, bird gossip, and any tremor the city failed to hear.<words>69</words>
But her secret motivation, scratched in invisible ink between data rows, was to catch the echo of a goddess.<words>88</words>
Tamsin’s grandmother, dead before dreams ended, had murmured of that echo while darning socks with familiarly unknown symbols.<words>106</words>
The symbols resembled orchard branches fluctuating between winter starkness and summer lushness, as though time itself could fluctuate alongside sap.<words>126</words>
Since then, Ranger Tamsin searched the trees waiting for chance encounters that might unlock her grandmother’s secrets.<words>143</words>
Orderly chaos was her preferred strategy, a chaotic organization of patrol routes that looped wildly yet covered every leaf.<words>162</words>
One dusk, reverberations brushed her inner ear, a tone like moonlight ringing inside a rusted guardrail.<words>178</words>
Tamsin halted mid-step; apples dropped behind her in odd syncopation, as if percussion cued by someone unseen.<words>195</words>
She flipped open the notebook, pages packed with columns, yet the handwriting now fluctuated, rearranging itself into a spiral.<words>214</words>
The spiral hummed, declaring directions northward toward a quince tree that had never existed on yesterday’s survey.<words>231</words>
Trusting grandmaternal mathematics, she navigated between traffic-light rootstocks and benches carved from crash barriers.<words>245</words>
There she found a child, translucently real, juggling fallen petals that neither drifted up nor down but stayed suspended.<words>264</words>
The child spoke with a voice familiarly unknown, the cadence of her grandmother but the pitch of distant thunderstorms.<words>283</words>
‘The goddess echoes only where maps forget,’ the apparition said, and the quince trunk split like theater curtains.<words>301</words>
Inside, a corridor of phosphorescent vines showed mural scenes of every dream humanity had ever released, preserved like fossils.<words>320</words>
Now, after the last human dream lay at the corridor’s dead end, a single blank alcove remained.<words>337</words>
Tamsin understood: the goddess was silence itself, and her echo could exist only if someone dared inscribe new noise.<words>356</words>
With shaking gloves she tore the plain notebook free from its binding, scattering analytical pages like startled pigeons.<words>374</words>
On the final scrap she wrote a fresh dream, not about orchards or highways but about sleeping oceans.<words>392</words>
The corridor brightened, vines tightened and relaxed, and a resonant whisper—half lullaby, half siren—fluctuated through the orchard above.<words>410</words>
Somewhere beyond concrete and cloud, the goddess caught her own echo, and Ranger Tamsin finally closed her patrol.<words>428</words>
