Snow hissed like kettle-steam around the frozen orchard that fed off hidden geothermal veins beneath cracked ice. <words>17</words>
It was after the last wish was granted, and silence hung heavier than the frost-laden branches. <words>33</words>
A ghostly caretaker drifted between apple skeletons, his demeanor solemnly silly, like a clown wearing mourning veils. <words>50</words>
He hummed a nursery rhyme backward, weaving through fate as if stitching melodies into the orchard's aching air. <words>68</words>
The caretaker's motivation was simple yet cosmic: to communicate with animals who whispered from burrows warmed by steam. <words>86</words>
But mortal tongues had failed him, so he sought guidance through forbidden expedition logs buried beneath the snowdrifts. <words>104</words>
The logs, penned by reckless botanists, described a plastic straw said to pierce reality's membrane when properly repurposed. <words>122</words>
Finding the straw frozen inside a syrupy block of sap, he knew he must perforate the viscous prison. <words>140</words>
With an icicle mallet he tapped rhythmic knocks, each strike loosening threads of possibility like buttons on fate's coat. <words>159</words>
The sap cracked, exhaling warm perfume, and the straw shot upward like a freed reed of neon prophecy. <words>177</words>
Solemnly silly, he placed the straw to his translucent lips and blew bubbles that sounded suspiciously like squirrel chatter. <words>196</words>
The orchard erupted into gentle chaos as foxes, hares, and even frost-bitten crows crowded around the spectral maestro. <words>214</words>
Their eyes glowed turquoise, reflecting geothermal vents that pulsed beneath roots, and they waited for the caretaker's first true sentence. <words>234</words>
Through the straw he exhaled one elongated tone, weaving through fate to translate his longing into universal mammal grammar. <words>253</words>
Snowflakes spun upward instead of down, rearranged by the vibration, forming luminous runes only animal eyes could parse. <words>271</words>
The fox spoke first, its voice traveling through the runes like wind through chimes: a promise of collaboration. <words>289</words>
Hares proposed patrol schedules to protect saplings, while crows volunteered aerial mapping, all negotiated in bubble-tones and rune-shadows. <words>307</words>
The caretaker bowed, his form flickering like candlewax, pleased that communion had been reached without a single spoken word. <words>326</words>
Yet destiny, once perforated, continues leaking, and the straw began to suck memories from the orchard's ancient soil. <words>344</words>
Visions of earlier wishes—lovers united, wars postponed, moons painted gold—spiraled upward, threatening to drown the new covenant. <words>361</words>
In gentle chaos he acted, guiding animals to grab the straw together, weaving their intentions into a final knot. <words>380</words>
The knot sealed the leak, and fate rewove itself, accepting the animals as legitimate stitchers beside the caretaker. <words>398</words>
Snow settled, warm sap resumed flowing, and the orchard thrummed with multilingual silence, proof that wishes mature beyond granting. <words>417</words>
