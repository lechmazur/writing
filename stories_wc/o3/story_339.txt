Silas Mare, once the circus's star mime, now wandered the prismatic lake with a face painted stiffly blank. <words>18</words>
He was a joyless performer who still bowed by habit, even though no applause rippled across the kaleidoscopic water. <words>37</words>
Behind him, gaudy scaffolds rattled amid construction of an amphitheater that promised to replace wandering artists with programmable holograms. <words>56</words>
Silas carried a velvet pouch holding only a simple drawer knob, the last prop from his demolished dressing wagon. <words>75</words>
Though modestly extravagant in his heyday, he now possessed nothing more theatrical than that small brass circle of memory. <words>94</words>
It was enough, he believed, to organize his remaining thoughts and perhaps hush the dissonance of old guilt. <words>112</words>
The guilt sprouted from two competing truths that tore him nightly: he had betrayed his friend, yet also saved him. <words>132</words>
He had cut the rope of a collapsing tent, freeing the acrobat but crashing the show, bankrupting everyone else. <words>151</words>
Now he lived torn between truths, a limb in each impossible direction, while the lake shimmered like splintered stained glass. <words>171</words>
The construction foreman allowed Silas to stay only because he agreed to test the new sound system every twilight. <words>190</words>
Silas's method was peculiar: he calibrated echoes via the squeaking seesaw in an empty playground bordering the site. <words>208</words>
Each dusk, he nudged the weathered plank and listened, cautious abandon guiding his ear as squeals ricocheted across scaffold and water. <words>229</words>
When the resonance felt right, he whispered jokes the way he once threw invisible ropes, and imagined laughter returning. <words>248</words>
But the lake answered with prismatic ripples that rearranged moonlight into accusatory masks, reminding him that forgiveness was not choreography. <words>268</words>
On the night before the amphitheater's grand opening, the foreman demanded a final check and thrust a clipboard of rigid timings. <words>289</words>
Silas felt the schedule squeeze around his heart like a closing curtain, and the two truths clawed louder inside his skull. <words>310</words>
If he perfected the acoustics, the hologram show would thrive and erase the human circus forever; if he failed, investors would flee again. <words>333</words>
Torn between truths, he walked to the playground, the drawer knob heavy as a planet in his pocket. <words>351</words>
He fastened the knob to the seesaw's rusted pivot, making a modestly extravagant gesture that only he understood. <words>369</words>
Then he pushed the plank, and the new axis screeched a chord neither pure nor dissonant, but eerily human. <words>388</words>
Sound spiraled across the prismatic lake, struck the scaffolds, rebounded, and shattered several decorative hologram projectors in fountains of sparks. <words>408</words>
The foreman cursed, alarms rang, and Silas bowed with cautious abandon as real workers, not virtual ghosts, rushed to protect the site. <words>430</words>
Within the chaos, he felt the two truths settle like balancing weights: he had again broken a show, yet preserved living voices. <words>452</words>
The drawer knob still glimmered on the seesaw, ordinary and heroic, whispering that guilt can be organized but never erased. <words>472</words>
Silas walked along the shimmering shore, no longer joyless, though neither joyous, simply breathing the echo that would remain uniquely his. <words>493</words>
