My name is Elowen Vale, an unapologetically humble somnambulist scout who wanders while asleep yet remembers everything upon waking.<words>19</words>
Tonight, between flights that shuttle researchers across the archipelago, I drifted into sanctioned slumber aboard a humming layover dirigible.<words>38</words>
My task was simple—scout the forbidden lowlands for woodland secrets and sketch their patterns before the next propellers spun dawnward.<words>58</words>
Layered beneath moss and mist, the ground once cradled a brilliant laboratory that sank when the marsh refused its weight.<words>78</words>
Glass domes now lie sideways like half-buried moons, their cracked panes exhaling sighs of algae and faint electricity.<words>96</words>
I carried my grandmother’s bottled lightning bug collection, each tiny jar a lantern to coax dormant circuits into brief memorial glow.<words>117</words>
Grandmother began this pilgrimage seventy years ago, claiming insects remembered maps of spirit the way metal recalls magnetism.<words>135</words>
Our family returns yearly to refresh the jars, reroute their flickers, and chart whatever wisdom spirals from the green silence.<words>155</words>
Loaded curiosity, not profit, fuels us; we publish no guidebooks, only hand-stitched constellations of luminous ink passed mouth to mouth.<words>175</words>
As I stepped through a fissured skylight, sleep still veiled my eyes, yet instincts lined each movement with careful reverence.<words>195</words>
The submerged hall pulsed when I uncorked the first jar, and amber insects drifted upward, illuminating rusted terminals like floating prayer beads.<words>217</words>
Screens long thought dead flickered alive, projecting topographic veins that pulsed in rhythm with my heartbeat.<words>233</words>
I realized the land was dreaming through me, uploading its memories while I myself wandered in somnambulant half-light.<words>251</words>
To honor the exchange, I traced the glowing paths onto vellum, mapping spiritual wisdom the way cartographers once measured trade winds.<words>272</words>
While copying, I felt cold water lick my boots, a reminder that the laboratory’s foundation kept sinking, jealous of surface breath.<words>293</words>
I whispered thanks, recaptured the bugs, and climbed skyward before the tide of mud sealed the aperture behind me.<words>312</words>
Back on the dirigible, dawn bleeding coral across propeller blades, I woke fully and secured the vellum inside a cedar tube.<words>333</words>
My fellow passengers, sandwiched between flights to corporate summits, barely noticed the silt on my cuffs or the firefly hum in my pocket.<words>356</words>
I stayed humble, murmuring that I sleepwalk, because the truth—that I negotiate with forests and sunken machines—would scorch conversation.<words>375</words>
Next year, when migrations crest again, I will return, jar lights refreshed, to deepen the map until wisdom and soil carry the same pulse.<words>399</words>
Listen.<words>400</words>
