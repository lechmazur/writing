The hush of the soundless sanctuary clung to brick and candle as rehearsals lurched awake.<words>15</words>
Ezra, the cathedral's dutiful ward, swept chalk dust from pews like a stage manager expecting ghosts.<words>31</words>
He was eagerly jaded, nineteen seasons into this endless audition for a choir no one heard.<words>47</words>
Today, however, a tremor in routine promised the thrill of reframing the familiar.<words>60</words>
Beneath the altar cloth he discovered a single worn leather glove, stitched with fading initials.<words>75</words>
Tucked inside the glove was an ancient phone, vibrating like a trapped moth against the reliquary oak.<words>92</words>
Ezra pocketed both, feeling his heartbeat mimic the device's coded shivers.<words>103</words>
During warm‑ups the sopranos mouthed hymns, but Ezra listened to cryptic voice notes whispering through stolen phones.<words>120</words>
The anonymous speaker, breath hitching, described riddles only solvable within the sanctuary's echoing geometry.<words>134</words>
Solve them, the voice urged, and give death a punchline it cannot rehearse.<words>147</words>
Ezra, orphaned by plague and therefore acquainted with mortality's blunt drafts, accepted the peculiar audition.<words>162</words>
Between bell cues he mapped the riddles on sheet music, replacing notes with coordinates.<words>176</words>
A balcony gargoyle's chipped fang, a broken organ pipe, and the baptismal font formed a triangle.<words>192</words>
At its center lay a trapdoor long ignored, sealed with wax from centuries of Easter vigils.<words>208</words>
Ezra pried it open while altos practiced crescendos that never reached the ear's horizon.<words>222</words>
A ladder descended into a crypt painted with graffiti quotations from failed comedians.<words>235</words>
Their jokes, half erased, promised graceless beauty in every scrawled mispunch.<words>246</words>
Another phone waited on a pedestal of skulls, replaying the same smoker's cadence.<words>259</words>
You are the punchline, it crackled; deliver us a final fearless laugh, then shut the curtain.<words>275</words>
Ezra understood: each audition upstairs measured vocal pitch, but this secret one measured courage against silence.<words>291</words>
He returned, sliding the worn leather glove over his dominant hand like a relic‑wrapped microphone.<words>306</words>
When his cue arrived, he did not sing; instead, he told the congregation a joke about coffins with skylights.<words>325</words>
Laughter burst, startled and joyous, ricocheting through naves that had forgotten resonance could be playful.<words>340</words>
In that vibration, Ezra felt the sanctuary itself reframe the familiar hush into living applause.<words>355</words>
The phones simultaneously beeped, shredding their stored voice notes into digital confetti that drifted like incense.<words>371</words>
Ezra, still eagerly jaded yet shining, bowed to the crypt's hidden audience he now sensed above and below.<words>389</words>
He sealed the trapdoor, returned the glove to its hiding place, and walked outside whistling mortality's new melody.<words>407</words>
Behind him, the sanctuary settled, neither silent nor loud, but forever rehearsing that victorious grin against the void.<words>425</words>
