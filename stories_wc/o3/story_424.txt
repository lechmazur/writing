The wind dragged hay-scented dust across the brass doors of the strange attractor laboratory. <words>14</words>
Inside, Ephrem Lark, an oddly typical yet mild zealot, polished beakers with reverent care. <words>28</words>
He had come during the uneasy lull between shifting powers that rattled the frontier province. <words>43</words>
The laboratory promised answers his chapel never dared to utter aloud. <words>54</words>
Upon the central oak table rested his treasured collection of foreign paper money, pressed beneath blown glass. <words>71</words>
Every faded bill bore a signature, a stain, or a burn, scars of legacy he could almost read. <words>89</words>
He wished to visualize their journeys, to trace sweat, barter, and betrayal through forgotten wishes still clinging to the ink. <words>109</words>
Yet the bills remained mute unless coaxed by the device Dr. Crespin had hidden beneath burlap. <words>125</words>
Crespin, exiled for heresies of mathematics, claimed the contraption could spin memory from currency like wool. <words>141</words>
Ephrem believed him, for belief was his trade, though tempered to mildness by weary sermons. <words>156</words>
Tonight, alone, he would test both machine and faith to learn the true meaning of sacrifice. <words>172</words>
He fed a blue Rupee from Zanzibar into the humming cage of copper coils. <words>186</words>
The lamps dimmed, throwing rustic refinement across cracked plaster and brass instruments. <words>198</words>
Phantom wind rustled the remaining bills as if they remembered being wages in distant storms. <words>213</words>
Within the coil, mist gathered and formed a caravan trudging salt flats under merciless sun. <words>228</words>
Ephrem saw porters collapse, coins spilling from split purses, and he quivered at the cost of bread. <words>245</words>
The vision scalded away any comfort that sacrifice was noble simply because scriptures said so. <words>260</words>
Still, he pressed a crimson Peso, smudged with seawater and embargo ink, into the slot. <words>275</words>
The laboratory groaned like a barn door in winter, and tidal spray surged across the walls. <words>291</words>
He watched sailors toss crates of grain overboard to lighten a listing republic, their faces gaunt with doubt. <words>309</words>
In that spray, Ephrem finally understood sacrifice as subtraction, the brutal arithmetic of surviving tomorrow. <words>324</words>
Yet understanding alone cut no scars of legacy into one's own flesh. <words>336</words>
He reached for the last note, a polymer Yuan printed for a dynasty that never materialized. <words>352</words>
It gleamed with rainbows, tempting him to keep it whole, oddly typical of human reluctance to bleed. <words>369</words>
But the machine demanded offering, and the shifting powers outside the province would soon storm the valley. <words>386</words>
Ephrem slid the note in, whispering prayers that tasted of straw and tarnished pewter. <words>400</words>
The coils flared, and a mirror image of himself trudged a road of ash, coins sewn into skin. <words>418</words>
He saw the weight tear muscle, yet the reflection walked onward, carrying tomorrow's bread for unseen mouths. <words>435</words>
Salted tears streaked Ephrem's cheeks as he realized the vision asked him to leave the laboratory and the money behind. <words>455</words>
He opened the brass doors to the night, clutching only the lesson, ready to be scarred properly. <words>472</words>
Behind him, the strange attractor laboratory pulsed once, sealed itself, and kept the forgotten wishes safe for another pilgrim. <words>491</words>
