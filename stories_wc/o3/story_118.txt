Mirth clung to the concrete corridors of Caldwell Station, the secret agent training facility, even while resentment hummed beneath every fluorescent lamp. <words>22</words>
It was through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery that this strange music reached its loudest pitch. <words>43</words>
The cadets, uniforms crisp yet uniformly peculiar, shuffled toward the psychological wing for their mandatory debrief. <words>59</words>
Waiting inside was the hive-mind therapist known as Dr. Chorus, a coalition of synced consciousnesses speaking through one calm mouth. <words>79</words>
Every cadet feared that mouth, because it never forgot and made each confession echo with the sound of hindsight. <words>98</words>
Tonight Chorus required a peculiar offering: their phones. <words>106</words>
One recruit, Liora Blaze, reluctantly surrendered hers, the scuffed phone charger plug dangling like a guilty keychain. <words>123</words>
Chorus placed the plug upon an iron pedestal beside a flickering candle whose wax dripped in measured dots onto vellum. <words>143</words>
Each slow drip formed coded shapes, an antique cipher translating raw emotion into actionable intelligence. <words>158</words>
Through this method, secrets would drain from the cadets without a single scream, and the facility could stay jolly yet brutal. <words>179</words>
Liora forced a grin, tasting merry bitterness on her tongue as the candle wax spelled out her hidden agenda. <words>198</words>
She wanted, above all, to anchor the ephemeral in reality: to prove that a fleeting thought could become law. <words>217</words>
The coming discovery, rumored to rewrite geopolitics, might evaporate into propaganda unless she fixed it with irrefutable memory. <words>235</words>
So she had volunteered for this psychological harvest, gambling that Chorus would preserve her truth rather than the agency's spin. <words>255</words>
The hive-voices murmured, surrounding her mind like warm static, then unified into a verdict only she could hear. <words>273</words>
Keep the plug, they advised, for history sometimes charges itself on damaged prongs. <words>286</words>
Liora pocketed the charger, feeling its metal teeth bite her palm, and the wax shifted to carve coordinates of a hidden vault. <words>308</words>
Chorus broadcast the coordinates into the shared consciousness of every cadet present, stitching their loyalties together with digital thread. <words>327</words>
Yet the echo that followed was not obedience but the resonant clang of hindsight, warning them of futures already misspent. <words>347</words>
A tremor rattled the facility as if the building itself regretted its training curriculum. <words>361</words>
Sprinkler mist caught the emergency lights, and the night became a glittering confession none could retract. <words>377</words>
Seizing the moment, Liora sprinted toward the vault, the shared minds buzzing behind her like amused hornets losing their queen. <words>397</words>
She felt their merry bitterness flung after her, half blessing, half curse, wholly proof that therapy had become rebellion. <words>416</words>
Beyond the reinforced door waited evidence of the discovery, still unannounced, ready to be anchored in the real by an unlikely plug. <words>438</words>
And as the coded wax cooled into silence, the facility listened to the fading sound of hindsight and finally understood its own diagnosis. <words>461</words>
