Steam coiled like translucent serpents around the catwalks of the vapor collection facility, making every metal railing sweat holy mist. <words>20</words>
Ezra Mahl, professional dream interpreter and reluctant engineer, walked its flickering corridors with a peculiar faith humming in his chest. <words>40</words>
He had been hired to diagnose machinery faults by reading the operators' nightmares during baking cycles when the ovens purified trace fog. <words>62</words>
Yet the assignment hid another purpose: to rewrite laws carved in stone, statutes older than the Republic's first furnace. <words>81</words>
Those immovable codes governed dream ownership, and Ezra aimed to loosen them the only way still legalâ€”by impersonating a missing person. <words>102</words>
The absent identity he borrowed belonged to Mara Quist, a baker who vanished after discovering the facility's quiet pulse beneath its louder machines. <words>125</words>
Mara had left behind only a crumpled invitation to some forbidden symposium on steam ethics, its ink blistered by heat. <words>145</words>
Ezra kept that relic pressed in his pocket, letting the papery bruise remind him why his deception must succeed. <words>164</words>
During baking today, the ovens coughed rhythmically; the pattern sounded like an occasionally frequent heartbeat, irregular yet insistent. <words>182</words>
Ezra recognized the code Mara had once described in her journalized dreams, a stutter the facility produced when its statutes began to calcify. <words>205</words>
Calcification, she claimed, hardened regulations into mineral truth, impossible to amend unless addressed while the pulse still whispered. <words>223</words>
So Ezra slipped into the central kiln control, scanning his badge vouching he was Mara, voice-matching her archived laughter to pass guards. <words>245</words>
Inside, valves glimmered, and vapor columns rose like mute congregations awaiting liturgy. <words>257</words>
He tuned the gauges until their sibilant singing aligned with the quiet pulse, then spoke aloud the rewritten clauses he dreamed last night. <words>280</words>
Each clause unraveled a stone-carved paragraph, converting it into pliant vapor that coiled toward the rafters like liberated scripture. <words>299</words>
Alarms would have howled, but the ovens were mid-bake, their heat shrouding anomalies beneath the sanctioned roar of production. <words>318</words>
Ezra felt time dilate, moments thinning like bubbles in rising dough, until the new laws settled, warm and malleable. <words>337</words>
Then the intercom crackled; supervisors searched for the missing Mara because sensor logs showed her badge active. <words>354</words>
With peculiar faith unbroken, Ezra stepped onto a conveyer of cooling trays, drifting among loaves as if another wisp of steam. <words>375</words>
He carried the crumpled invitation like scripture, sure that one day someone would smooth it flat and read the amended dream of their nation. <words>399</words>
Outside, the sunrise hissed across the wet pipes. <words>407</words>
