Felix Lorne adjusted the boom microphone as if tuning strings that stretched behind the skin of reality. <words>17</words>
He was the city's clandestine sound engineer, clumsily dexterous, forever bumping elbows yet never missing a frequency. <words>34</words>
Tonight, a stained glass fragment he carried in his vest pocket glittered like a censored curse. <words>50</words>
Its slivered saint, once part of a cathedral window shattered by riot stones, whispered with prismatic menace. <words>67</words>
Felix needed that menace for silent retribution. <words>74</words>
An unstoppable crowd had promised to swallow Parliament Square at dawn, their chants already echoing like advancing surf. <words>92</words>
The mayor hired Felix to hush that roar without tear gas or bullets. <words>105</words>
He accepted, not for coin, but to critique the mob's cruelty for burning the music school where he'd grown up. <words>125</words>
Yet words were useless; he would speak by removing sound itself. <words>136</words>
So he descended the spiral stair into a witch's cauldron room repurposed as his studio of practical illusion. <words>154</words>
The hearth still smelled of nettle and bone, but cables now coiled among the soot-black kettles. <words>170</words>
Felix placed the stained glass fragment before a condenser microphone and clapped; the shard stored the clap like a jealous echo. <words>191</words>
He rewound the recording backward, splicing milliseconds until silence itself became a sculptable waveform. <words>205</words>
At the hush of a freshly erased chalkboard, he pressed play, and the room imploded into velvet quiet. <words>223</words>
Even the bubbling memories inside the cauldron jars shivered, then settled like students cowed by an unseen teacher. <words>241</words>
Now he had a portable vacuum of sound, a negative hymn to drape over the square. <words>257</words>
But delivery required confession, for crowds trust mimes more than magicians. <words>268</words>
At dawn he mounted the plinth where statues once stood, face white with chalk, gloves exaggeratedly loose. <words>285</words>
Without a word, he began pantomime confessions in the public square, miming his own clumsy guilt for failing to prevent the school's fire. <words>308</words>
The mob, already thrumming, paused to judge the silent critique performed by a crooked-limbed maestro. <words>323</words>
Felix bowed, produced the stained glass fragment, and shattered it against the plinth like a cymbal. <words>339</words>
Sound rushed out--then reversed--sucking every shout, drumbeat, and footfall into the nonexistent bell of the microphone he'd hidden below. <words>358</words>
Mouths still moved, fists still pumped, but the air was a library sealed in snow. <words>373</words>
Felix felt the hush bloom, exacting his silent retribution while preventing slaughter. <words>385</words>
He tipped an imaginary hat, his clumsily dexterous fingers knocking chalk dust off the brim. <words>400</words>
In the new stillness, even reality leaned closer, eager for his next mixdown. <words>413</words>
