I brace against the chrome irrigation rail, holding a calf stretch while the sunrise lamps flicker on inside Eden‑Dome Three's futuristic farm.<words>22</words>
Stretching buys me seconds to think, and fugitives trade in seconds the way farmers trade in seeds.<words>39</words>
I am Hale Keswick, once the galaxy's most celebrated trickster lawyer, now a rumor sprinting through biodomes.<words>56</words>
The court wants my head for disbarment sorcery; the corporations want my mind for nondisclosure breaches; I want quiet tongues for my archive.<words>79</words>
Disappearing languages are not preserved by patient scribes anymore, so I, impatiently patient, record them while sprinting.<words>96</words>
Every detour I take follows a chosen path inscribed in code on a leftover gift tag dangling from my wrist like a condemned festival bracelet.<words>121</words>
High school rivals mailed me a stack of these tags four months ago, each a cryptic dare that dared me to divert course and gather new words before they vanished.<words>151</words>
Clumsy nostalgia could not explain their devotion; mutual guilt over pranks we never apologized for could.<words>167</words>
By obeying each dare, I earn forgiveness one dialect at a time.<words>179</words>
Today’s stretch occurs beside protein kale towers, because Tag Seventeen commanded, 'Breathe where vines impersonate constellations, record the speech that lingers in runoff.'<words>202</words>
So I inhaled the scent of photosynthetic electricity and tuned my earpiece to the ghostly resolve of the dying dialect called Awa‑Nusa.<words>224</words>
Only three orchardists still spoke it, old women whose tattoos of weather codes crawled when they laughed.<words>241</words>
They approached while I stretched, thinking I was merely loosening ligaments before litigating their wages.<words>256</words>
Instead I greeted them in fractured Awa‑Nusa, and time itself bent, the greenhouse misters sounding like surf on childhood chromium beaches.<words>277</words>
They gifted me verbs for wind that can bruise metal, nouns for silence that can heal bone.<words>294</words>
I sketched phonemes across the gift tag with ultraviolet ink, letting consonants sparkle like dew on polymer leaves.<words>312</words>
Then alarms howled—a magistrate drone had sniffed my legal DNA through the humidity.<words>325</words>
Flight demanded swiftness, yet I remained rooted, the impatiently patient scholar waiting for one final idiom.<words>341</words>
The eldest orchardist pressed her knuckles to my temple and whispered a proverb meaning 'chosen paths outgrow their walkers'.<words>360</words>
Those words completed the set, and the dare's ink on my tag dissolved like a contract fulfilled.<words>377</words>
I vaulted into a ventilation shaft, diverting the drone toward looping cattle corridors where methane perfect storms muddled its sensors.<words>397</words>
While crawling, I stretched again, catalog in teeth, lungs burning, yet filled with ghostly resolve steady as chlorophyll.<words>415</words>
I felt the proverb's truth; my chosen path now belonged to the words themselves, and I was merely their footnote in motion.<words>437</words>
When the tunnel spat me into a citrus quadrant, I slipped the ultraviolet tag under a seed tray for my rivals to find, invitation glowing like afterlife.<words>464</words>
Somewhere behind, the drone cursed in legal jargon I once weaponized, proving even languages of power can dwindle when misused.<words>484</words>
I exhaled, resumed my stretch, and stepped forward, another dare already itching beneath unused skin.<words>499</words>
