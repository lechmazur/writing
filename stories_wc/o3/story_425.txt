After the last star is named, the solar flare observatory over Halcyon City stood silent, draped in lavishly austere banners of scorched silk. <words>23</words>
The morose paladin Sir Vogrin arrived alone, armored in tarnished chrome that mirrored his mood and the burnt sky. <words>42</words>
He had come to restore ancient systems forgotten beneath the observatory’s cracked floors, though duty tasted like ash upon his tongue. <words>63</words>
A sudden city-wide blackout swallowed the horizon, yet within the darkness Vogrin felt a flicker of bored excitement ignite. <words>82</words>
A chance encounter during a city-wide blackout threw a maintenance apprentice named Elira into him, clutching a toolbox and a dull sewing needle. <words>105</words>
Her calm irritation matched his solemnity, and together they decided the needle would do until finer instruments could be found. <words>125</words>
As they descended the spiral shaft, visible changes in the stone, gleaming veins awakening under unseen currents, guided their hesitant steps. <words>146</words>
At the core, they found a bronze sarcophagus designed not to bury, but to confine a star-sized capacitor drained centuries ago. <words>167</words>
Symbols on its lid matched Vogrin’s paladin codex: a vow that no light should perish unloved. <words>183</words>
The chamber, though lavishly austere, offered only stripped-gold columns, shattered mosaics, and a single console waiting for a pulse. <words>202</words>
Elira explained that the ancient systems responded to creative surges, not brute force, and pricked her thumb with the sewing needle. <words>223</words>
A drop of blood spattered onto the console, sizzling like comet foam, and hidden gears began to stir. <words>241</words>
In reflex, Vogrin laid his gauntlet beside her sacrifice, letting the rune-etched metal channel their combined intent into the machine. <words>261</words>
Visible changes rippled outward: pillars brightened, dust reassembled into constellations, and the sarcophagus hummed with embryonic dawn. <words>278</words>
Yet power demands were greater than their tiny offering, threatening to collapse the core or ignite the city above. <words>297</words>
Understanding, Vogrin removed his helm, revealing eyes duller than the needle, and whispered the creed that had once confined his joy. <words>318</words>
The system drank his words like current, rewriting them into code, and Elira watched in bored excitement, realizing legends were simply well-documented instructions. <words>341</words>
Light burst upward through the shaft, painting the blackout with prismatic rivers; turbines ancient even before naming of stars rotated anew. <words>362</words>
Vogrin felt the morose crust around his spirit crack, yet he remained, choosing to confine himself as guardian of the rekindled heart. <words>384</words>
Outside, children would soon notice the visible changes, and recordkeepers would add a footnote: after the last star is named, another was reborn underground. <words>408</words>
