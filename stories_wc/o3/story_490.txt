After the waves recede from the deserted shore, the caravan repair station smells of rust and salted ghosts. <words>18</words>
Inside, a fading caretaker blotches oil on his sleeves like bruises nobody will ever bother to name. <words>35</words>
He practices enthusiastic apathy, waving hello to corroded hulls and goodbye to departing gulls with identical indifference. <words>52</words>
Yet the emptiness vibrates with the allure of the forbidden, and he can never quite mute the hum. <words>70</words>
The forbidden hum whispers that purpose still exists somewhere beyond scheduled maintenance and brittle memories. <words>85</words>
Tonight, alone between chassis, he unrolls a dried lavender bundle he keeps hidden beneath the parts catalog. <words>102</words>
Its scent is dusty starlight, an aroma unauthorized by any manual, making the air feel temporarily infinite. <words>119</words>
He gorges on breaths, stuffing his lungs until they swell like patched tires desperate for the next mile. <words>137</words>
Memory and curiosity crank inside him, methodically random, a geartrain meshing order with chaotic longing. <words>152</words>
He wants, impossibly, to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy, however briefly his trembling arms allow. <words>169</words>
Rumor claims that beyond the shore’s horizon sleeps such an unknown, cached in encrypted tidal archives. <words>185</words>
So the caretaker decides to hack the ancient archives the sea once kept, repurposing spare antennae as prying fingers. <words>204</words>
He drags a weather-beaten console onto the sanded concrete pad, the station’s cables slithering like patient eels. <words>221</words>
Monitors flicker teal and bruise-purple, displaying strings of barnacle-encrusted code no engineer is allowed to interpret. <words>237</words>
The system resists like a stubborn tide, but his keystrokes tap a lullaby older than compliance. <words>253</words>
Bit by bit, rusted permissions peel away, revealing coordinates that shimmer then fade, as if ashamed of their own existence. <words>273</words>
He records them on the parchment wrapper of his lavender, ink bleeding into petals already brittle with destiny. <words>291</words>
Outside, seagulls ignore him, embodying his enthusiastic apathy better than he ever could. <words>304</words>
Still, their indifference gifts privacy, and he feels almost grateful to nothing in particular. <words>318</words>
Night rolls over the station like primer paint, sealing the world in matte potential. <words>332</words>
The caretaker clutches the lavender bundle, climbs onto a half-repaired rover, and programs it for the unveiled coordinates. <words>350</words>
The engine coughs, then sings, and he steers toward the moonlit flats where seabed cracks like unread parchment. <words>368</words>
He laughs with measured neutrality, telling himself that discovery is overrated even while his pulse beats cathedral drums. <words>386</words>
In that contradiction he feels alive, neither guardian nor deserter, simply a vessel built to be emptied. <words>403</words>
Behind him, the caravan repair station dims, its lights bowing like elders who understand the necessity of disobedience. <words>421</words>
Ahead, the coordinates promise a gorge of starlight waiting to be scooped into fragile human hands. <words>437</words>
He accelerates, lavender aroma swirling with ozone, eager to cradle that impossible baby universe before his own pulse tapers. <words>456</words>
Somewhere beyond the monitors’ glow, the forbidden hum smiles, finally pacified by someone willing to listen hard enough. <words>474</words>
