Softly, under vaulted basalt arches, a meek necromancer named Ildra shuffled past phosphorescent stalactites. <words>14</words>
She had never raised a corpse without apologizing first, her voice peculiarly sincere even to empty bones. <words>31</words>
Tonight the underground city of the goblins stirred with rumors that the elders would unveil the tangled tapestry. <words>49</words>
Legend claimed the woven labyrinth hid a universal riddle whose solution granted dominion over silence, memory, and stars. <words>67</words>
Ildra wanted to decode a universal riddle not for power but to regain a childhood lullaby she had forgotten. <words>86</words>
Amid playground sounds drifting down ventilation shafts—goblin hatchlings squealing on rusted swings—she approached the plaza where the tapestry hovered. <words>105</words>
She carried only a fountain pen with a broken nib, its ink long dried to brittle midnight flakes. <words>123</words>
The goblin elders chanted, and strands of moonless color writhed across the tapestry like nerves remembering ancient pains. <words>141</words>
Each observer saw a different path, yet stepped away convinced the pattern was unsolvable except by violence or greed. <words>160</words>
Ildra waited until the murmurs thinned, then knelt, holding the pen like a prayer rather than a tool. <words>178</words>
She recalled her mentor saying that death is merely ink spilled from time, awaiting a writer brave enough to listen. <words>198</words>
But tonight she listened not to bones but to light, seeking guidance through the way light reflects off a dew drop. <words>219</words>
A single droplet trembled on a stalactite above, catching lantern glimmers and scattering them into prismatic syllables across the weave. <words>239</words>
By tilting the broken nib so it mirrored that shimmer, she traced invisible lines in the air before the tapestry. <words>259</words>
The cloth responded like calm water, revealing hidden threads that formed the lullaby’s first measure, soft as breath on embers. <words>279</words>
Goblins gasped, suspecting sorcery, yet the meek necromancer merely hummed along, letting the melody guide her trembling wrist. <words>297</words>
Sentence by silent sentence, the riddle unraveled as simple questions a child might ask the moon about being alone. <words>316</words>
Answering them required no dominion, only courage to admit that every life is a knot yearning to touch another strand. <words>336</words>
When she whispered this truth, the tapestry dissolved into motes that settled on listening faces like forgiving dust. <words>354</words>
In that hush, playground sounds drifted again, not as echoes but as living laughter threading corridors long starved of dawn. <words>374</words>
Ildra felt the lullaby return, braided from those voices, and with it her own name before sorrow had weighed it down. <words>395</words>
She placed the broken pen on the cobblestones, knowing another seeker might one day need its quiet mirror more than ink. <words>416</words>
Then, amid new sunlight conjured by hundreds of small torches, the meek necromancer walked away, smiling at her regained simplicity. <words>436</words>
