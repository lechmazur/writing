I uncapped my stifled voice in the gloomy cellar of Morwenna, the witch, while her owls blinked indifferently. <words>18</words>
They knew me only as the underground poet, passing through like damp smoke. <words>31</words>
Morwenna had hired me to recite meter that soothed the talons in her familiar menagerie upstairs. <words>47</words>
I pretended disinterest, yet passion seeped between syllables the way tea leaks from a cracked pot. <words>63</words>
During blanket crocheting sessions in the corner, I composed lines inside my head rather than watch the yarn. <words>81</words>
It was then I found the antique map with a tear poking from a dusty embroidery basket. <words>98</words>
Lines of faded ink sketched a route through cellars toward something marked simply as the brimming cup. <words>115</words>
The phrase tickled me, statically unique among the usual occult hieroglyphs she scattered like breadcrumbs. <words>130</words>
I decided to seize whatever waited there, not for gold, but to surprise fate with an unplanned encore. <words>148</words>
Encore to what, I was unsure; maybe to the single reading that once got me banned from daylight stages. <words>167</words>
Through volunteer stints in odd places, I had memorized the geography beneath towns, from plague tunnels to wine crypts. <words>186</words>
So after the owls dozed and the witch nodded over her pattern, I slipped under the floorboards. <words>203</words>
The map's tear aligned with a splintered beam, revealing a breeze that smelled of thyme and ink. <words>220</words>
I crawled through, brushing cobwebs that whispered edits to my poems. <words>231</words>
Stairs descended against geometry's wishes, spiraling like rhetorical questions until I reached a vault of mirrored bowls. <words>248</words>
At the chamber center stood the brimming cup itself, yet what overflowed was not liquid but unspoken words. <words>266</words>
Each syllable rose as vapor, condensed, shimmered, and vanished, repeating a cadence of endless almosts. <words>281</words>
I recognized verses I never dared recite, waiting for breath. <words>291</words>
With disinterested passion, I lowered my notebook toward the rim and felt my pages absorb the vapor. <words>308</words>
New stanzas scripted themselves in ink older than ink, promising neither fame nor peace, only continuation. <words>324</words>
I seized the cup, expecting weight, but it clanged hollow, a bell without a tongue. <words>339</words>
Its echo stirred the menagerie above; claws rattled cages, and Morwenna's crochet needle froze midloop. <words>354</words>
Footsteps descended, slow, deliberate, statically unique in rhythm, as if carved by mathematicians of dread. <words>369</words>
I understood the encore required an audience, even an unwilling one, so I began to read aloud. <words>386</words>
The vapor words swirled into shapes of her restless ferrets and toads, now listening with reluctant hearts. <words>403</words>
Morwenna arrived, but the poem seized her will more firmly than any spell she'd brewed. <words>418</words>
When the final line leapt from my tongue, the cup emptied, and the map's tear stitched itself. <words>435</words>
Silence followed, neither triumph nor ruin, just blank yarn dangling where her crochet had paused. <words>450</words>
Satisfied, I climbed back to the cellar, hidden verses humming like low voltage, ready for the next accidental stage. <words>469</words>
Fate, undoubtedly startled, waited somewhere above to applaud or condemn whenever I surfaced. <words>482</words>
