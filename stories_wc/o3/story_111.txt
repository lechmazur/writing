Steam spiraled from copper alembics while the deserted alchemist listened to the bubbling wort.<words>14</words>
It was during brewing in the secret dog park hidden beneath the city plaza that he worked alone.<words>32</words>
The benches above rattled with oblivious commuters, but below, kettles and kennels shared fragrant air.<words>47</words>
Dogs padded circles, guarding formulas etched in chalk like sacred routes of escape.<words>60</words>
He chased no customers now; abandonment had rendered him theoretically intuitive, conversing only with evaporation.<words>75</words>
Yet motive persisted: to wrestle a dream from oblivion before its last vapors vanished.<words>89</words>
The alchemist believed his lost apprentice still slept somewhere in memory, awaiting aromatic summons.<words>103</words>
For guidance he carried a golden typewriter ribbon coiled around his wrist like metallic scripture.<words>118</words>
Once it printed their shared theories of recombining essences; now it whispered through its mute shine.<words>134</words>
He faced the dilemma of faith: could chemistry distill prayer, or must belief leap without solvent?<words>150</words>
To decide, he performed the old reading, the method learned beside forest ponds.<words>163</words>
He drew a smooth stone from the mash tun, stepped to a rain-fed basin where dogs lapped.<words>180</words>
With reverent flick, he cast the pebble, and concentric mirrors rippled beneath fluorescent pipes.<words>194</words>
He read answers through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown.<words>211</words>
First ring promised resilience, second ring remembered laughter, third ring broke, and grief exultant surged upward.<words>227</words>
Savor the fracture, the water urged, for only cracked surface lets moonlight ferment.<words>240</words>
Tears salted the wort as he returned to kettles, translating ripples into recipes of return.<words>255</words>
By lamplight he unwound the golden typewriter ribbon and threaded it through an improvised press.<words>270</words>
Each key struck parchment soaked in hop oils, imprinting formulas equal parts absinthe, absence, and absolution.<words>286</words>
Dogs howled, harmonizing like organ pipes, as vapor curled into silhouettes of the missing apprentice.<words>301</words>
The alchemist felt her fingers guide his across invisible glyphs, completing sentences the ribbon began.<words>316</words>
Faith, theoretically intuitive, manifested as duet: matter meeting memory in foaming communion.<words>328</words>
He bottled the brew, sealing inside the vaporous outline, uncertain whether he had resurrected or merely recorded.<words>345</words>
Nevertheless exultant grief thrummed through him like bass beneath cathedral stones, and the dogs quieted.<words>360</words>
Above, oblivious footsteps crossed the plaza mosaic; below, new ale cooled within moonlit barrels.<words>374</words>
He sat, clutching the bottled dream, and waited for dawn to taste what faith had wrought.<words>390</words>
When first light slipped through the grates, he raised the glass and dared to savor the impossible.<words>407</words>
It tasted of bitter hops, petrichor, and a voice saying, 'I am awake,' echoing against silent paws.<words>424</words>
The deserted alchemist, no longer deserted, laughed and wept, his faith both question and answer effervescing together.<words>441</words>
Somewhere within the park, a single dog barked amen.<words>450</words>
