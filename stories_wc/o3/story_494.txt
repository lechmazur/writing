Ink drifted like storm-born snowflakes across the calligraphy master's courtyard, settling on lanterns long since extinguished. <words>16</words>
Into this hush swaggered Yorisho, an arrogant swordsman whose boots scraped arrogance onto every flagstone they kissed. <words>33</words>
Yet beneath the flick of his ponytail lingered a doubtfully confident tremor, a secret he disguised with louder boasts. <words>52</words>
He carried a faded tapestry fragment, its colors drowned yet its weave whispering of shackled potential knotted inside him. <words>71</words>
The master, stooped like a quill pressed flat, looked up only between breaths, measuring Yorisho's impatience by silhouettes of dust. <words>91</words>
I seek to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out, Yorisho declared, voice sharp as untempered steel. <words>110</words>
Authorize my passage to the mountain shrine, and the darkness will fear my blade. <words>124</words>
The master answered with harsh tenderness, stroking the broken reed he used instead of a brush. <words>140</words>
Your blade is already feared, boy; it is your silence that lies imprisoned. <words>153</words>
He gestured to the courtyard stones, each engraved with a stanza of a traditional song sung at every family wedding. <words>173</words>
Those lyrics, chipped by rain, traced lost vows and births, enough history to humble dynasties. <words>188</words>
Yorisho scoffed, but the fragment in his satchel pulsed, threads yearning to rejoin the courtyard's carved refrain. <words>205</words>
The master motioned again, slower, so that time seemed to pause between heartbeats and then between breaths. <words>222</words>
Sing, he ordered, let the cloth remember what your tongue denies. <words>233</words>
Doubt coiled around Yorisho's ribs, yet a melody surfaced, the very song that once ushered his sister to marriage. <words>252</words>
He began low, voice cracking like ice on spring rivers, but each note authorized breath to follow breath. <words>270</words>
The courtyard answered: etched stanzas glowed, lanterns relit, and the tapestry fragment lifted from its bindings, threads dancing. <words>288</words>
Within the woven scene a tiny figure, once gray, burst into color and unsheathed a crimson miniature sword. <words>306</words>
Yorisho saw himself mirrored, not as conqueror but as guardian, forged to kindle, not to dazzle. <words>322</words>
The harshness of realization struck, yet within it bloomed tenderness for lives he had scorched by vanity. <words>339</words>
Tears guttered down the edge of his smirk, extinguishing it as rain tames sparks before they wander. <words>356</words>
The master nodded, eyes reflecting rekindled lanterns, and spoke one syllable that weighed more than scrolls: Go. <words>373</words>
Authorization granted, Yorisho bound the tapestry fragment around his scabbard like a vow made visible. <words>388</words>
As he stepped beyond the gate, the song lingered behind him, singing itself now, promising that potential need never remain shackled. <words>409</words>
Night bowed, and for the first time the arrogant swordsman walked in darkness confident enough to doubt, bright enough to listen. <words>430</words>
