Steam curled over the porcelain tub as I stepped inside the thought experiment chamber our institute reserves for nocturnal contemplations.<words>20</words>
Bubble baths have always coaxed equations from me, yet tonight I rehearsed choreography instead, ankles slicing water like metronomes.<words>39</words>
The faculty call me a sharp‑witted dancer, but they forget wit knots when tongues unravel; I am linguistically inept.<words>58</words>
Words fail, so I mimic their meanings with hips, wrists, and the quick semaphore of dripping fingertips.<words>75</words>
Tonight the institute’s custodian delivered an object that sliced my concentration wider than any pirouette: a charred patch from a crashed spaceship mission.<words>98</words>
Its threads showed our family crest, confirming the rumor Mother whispered every year right before the camera shutter captured our reluctant smiles.<words>120</words>
That yearly family photo, a tradition dull as lukewarm soap, supposedly stored coordinates to fulfill a final prophecy with a twist.<words>141</words>
The twist, Mother insisted, lay in accepting that none of us wanted destiny, yet denying it would double its gravitational pull.<words>162</words>
I felt the weight of denial compress my ribs harder than the tub’s porcelain whenever I pretended the prophecy was folklore.<words>183</words>
Now the crash‑blackened patch glared like proof, so I slid underwater, letting bubbles muffle panic while the chamber computed scenario branches overhead.<words>205</words>
Holographic equations sprayed neon, predicting my dance would someday cue a fleet of orphaned escape pods to land in our orchard.<words>226</words>
Ambivalence saturated me; triumph and dread tasted identical, like soap bubbles that sparkle yet pop against the tongue.<words>244</words>
I rose dripping, performing the mimic sequence the prophecy encoded, each splash translating verbs my stubborn mouth never could.<words>263</words>
Sensors hurled vectors across the walls, proving the gestures unlocked the patch’s telemetry: coordinates straight into the crater where the craft had died.<words>286</words>
Mother always scheduled the photo during bubble baths because steam hid our eyes; she feared the lens would expose her secret longing for escape.<words>310</words>
Seeing the patch, I understood she was the pilot who crashed, marooning herself in domesticity to quarantine alien data inside tradition.<words>331</words>
Her denial weighed generations, compressing us into smiling silhouettes every year, each photograph another chain link disguised as nostalgia.<words>350</words>
I pinned the patch to my wet scarf, the emblem bleeding colors that the chamber’s lights captured like a dawn impossible to ignore.<words>373</words>
Then I set the timer for a final family photo, summoning Mother, siblings, and our ghosts to witness the prophecy’s revised overture.<words>395</words>
When the flash ignited, I danced the escape‑pod code, shattering porcelain, unveiling stars, and proving that acceptance, not denial, completes the orbit.<words>417</words>
