I stand sentinel in the lunar greenhouse perched on the crater's frigid edge, my shoulders locked like sprung steel.<words>19</words>
They call me the tense bodyguard, but tension is merely the hum of a wire ready to sing.<words>37</words>
Tonight serenity cloaks that hum in slow anger, because I have decided to sever the leash Senator Halvorsen loops around my mind.<words>59</words>
His orders keep me here guarding seedlings of imported cedar meant for wealthy Earth parks I will never visit.<words>78</words>
Yet amid park visits memorialized in my childhood, I once learned freedom smells like wet grass and dangerless dusk.<words>97</words>
That memory lives inside a faded photograph I stole from Halvorsen's cabinet, its colors bleached but its promise unbowed.<words>116</words>
The promise is of a timely rebirth, and I mean to ratify it tonight.<words>130</words>
I have no manifesto, only the serendipitously stubborn habit of listening to gossip drifting through ductwork.<words>146</words>
For months I pieced a map of escape by collecting fragments of overheard stories from engineers, gardeners, and smugglers unloading water ice.<words>168</words>
Their whispered routes snake beneath the crater rim to a forgotten maglev tunnel leading far from Halvorsen's jurisdiction.<words>186</words>
At 0200 lunar standard, the irrigation misters hiss like surf and mask my departure.<words>200</words>
I brush pollen from my visor, salute the cedars destined for ornamental captivity, and turn toward the maintenance hatch.<words>219</words>
Beyond it, the tunnel yawns, breathing stale oxygen flavored with rumors I once cataloged.<words>233</words>
I am alone until footsteps echo, and Halvorsen's junior aide, Mara, appears with a lantern and a tremor in her jaw.<words>254</words>
She admits she has followed the same murmured breadcrumbs, craving her own emancipation from the Senator's algorithmic schedules.<words>272</words>
In her palm she carries seeds coded to bloom only under unfiltered sunlight, contraband I could confiscate but will instead protect.<words>293</words>
Together we stride through the black-lace tunnel, serenity steady in our chests, anger simmering like coals we refuse to extinguish.<words>313</words>
Ahead waits the maglev carriage, its cabin windows reflecting our silhouettes--two stubborn guardians poised for rebirth in the parks of Earth.<words>334</words>
Mara asks what anchors my defiance, and I hand her the faded photograph, the meadow scene barely clinging to the paper.<words>355</words>
She traces the bleached horizon and nods, ratifying silently that some images outlive the chains meant to frame them.<words>374</words>
We board, seal the hatch, and key the antique controls the smugglers described in fragments I once puzzled over like scripture.<words>395</words>
Magnetic coils groan alive, granting the greenhouse behind us the brief calm of midnight before alarms bloom.<words>412</words>
Red strobes chase across domed glass, but the carriage already hurtles into shadow, and lunar dust feathers upward like surrendered ghosts.<words>433</words>
My pulse slows, muscles unclench, yet the serene anger remains, a guiding star reminding me never again to guard what must be free.<words>456</words>
