The antique airship Driftling hovered above the hush of an empty playground at twilight, sails creaking like tired accordions. <words>19</words>  
Within its brasswork gondola loitered Lysander, a mellow bard of elegantly disheveled curls and sunburned velvet. <words>35</words>  
He tuned a patchwork lute while reciting a creed he called learned patience, each note held until silence felt fuller than sound. <words>57</words>  
Tonight his mission was to resuscitate wonder in jaded eyes, starting with the town children who had abandoned this very playground for glowing screens. <words>81</words>  
He believed an airborne feast, a traditional holiday meal, would lure them upward like moths toward starlight. <words>98</words>  
The long galley table, bolted along the rail, steamed with cinnamon stew and comet-shaped pastries, scents drifting down the mooring lines. <words>119</words>  
Yet Lysander placed beside every plate his worn wooden ruler, a humble artifact meant to measure the width of wonder in arriving hearts. <words>142</words>  
Wind-chimes rang; unexpected guests emerged, not children, but dusty teachers whose cynicism had overloaded their souls until delight tripped the breakers. <words>163</words>  
They shuffled aboard in fearful awe, eyes darting over gears as though every rivet might burst with joyful terror. <words>182</words>  
Lysander strummed a chord so soft it sounded like dust remembering rain, and conversation paused mid-breath. <words>198</words>  
He invited them to sit, warning that the ship would rise with each story they shared, for heaviness only anchors dreams. <words>219</words>  
At first the teachers scoffed, blades of sarcasm ready, but the pastries melted against their tongues like remembered recess bells, and sarcasm slipped. <words>242</words>  
One elderly math master clutched the worn ruler, measuring steam, then measuring his pulse, laughing when he found the numbers mismatched. <words>263</words>  
Lysander explained that the ruler had survived shipwrecks because it refused to pretend precision where mystery reigned, and the lesson settled like snow. <words>286</words>  
Gradually talk kindled, each confession of burnt hopes exhaling ballast, and the Driftling lifted above the playground's rusted swing sets. <words>306</words>  
Below, children finally emerged, pointing up with open mouths, their devices forgotten as twilight purpled into indigo. <words>323</words>  
The sudden overload of pure astonishment jolted the airship's lanterns brighter, and gasps echoed like fireworks inside tin cans. <words>342</words>  
Lysander, steady in his learned patience, coaxed order from the chaos by slow strums, letting terror dance with joy but never lead. <words>364</words>  
The teachers began to sing, rusty voices oiling themselves on melody, until the children's climbing ropes shimmered like harp strings between earth and sky. <words>388</words>  
Wonder returned, first timid, then roaring, a zephyr that filled every lung and sail. <words>402</words>  
When the feast ended, Lysander marked a single scratch upon the ruler to remember the night cynicism surrendered, then bowed to his guests. <words>425</words>  
The airship descended, kissing ground so softly no sand was stirred, and the playground lights flickered awake as though applauding. <words>445</words>  
Teachers and children disembarked alike, carrying leftover pastries and a tingling, joyful terror that promised to keep their eyes unjaded. <words>465</words>  
Alone again, Lysander tucked his ruler, brushed wind from his elegantly disheveled hair, and whispered thanks to twilight for learning patience in return. <words>488</words>
