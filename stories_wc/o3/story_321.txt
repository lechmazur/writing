The infernal kitchen hissed like a volcano throttled by ladles, yet a curious, abrasive calm settled over its blistered countertops. <words>20</words>
Malthus, the distracted guard assigned to watch the simmering cauldron of regrets, kept stirring air instead of stew. <words>38</words>
His helmet radio crackled with unfinished apologies, each one pausing in static exactly in the space where an apology waits unspoken. <words>59</words>
Above the stove hung a partial spool of ribbon, crimson threads dangling like severed promises that might yet bind wounds if remembered. <words>81</words>
Malthus was almost radical in his neglect, convinced that if he allowed chaos enough room, order would negotiate itself. <words>100</words>
But the cauldron began to displace heat into the walls, blistering glyphs of silence that threatened to crack the realm’s marrow. <words>121</words>
To outmaneuver cosmic silence, the head chef—an eyeless oracle named Salt—ordered the guard to purchase forgiveness at any cost. <words>140</words>
Salt pressed the dreamlike hourglass into Malthus’s glove, its swirling patterns of pepper smoke demanding interpretation instead of brute obedience. <words>160</words>
The method was clear: salvation would arrive by clarifying the swirling patterns inside a dreamlike hourglass, not from the cauldron’s maw. <words>181</words>
Malthus tilted the glass, and pepper swirls formed an image of the ribbon weaving itself around the cauldron, sealing its scream. <words>202</words>
Yet the vision demanded payment: every knot in that ribbon would cost one secret sorrow, freshly confessed, and Malthus owned thousands. <words>223</words>
Abruptly the radio spat his own voice, replaying the apology he had never dared offer the living world he once deserted. <words>244</words>
In abrasive calm, he sliced the air with that unsaid word, each syllable a ribbon-fiber that leapt toward the hanging spool. <words>265</words>
The partial spool shuddered, accepting the additions, and began unraveling itself like a serpent seeking its own tail of culpability. <words>285</words>
One end dove into the cauldron, another circled the hourglass, tethering regret and time in a knot only humility could release. <words>306</words>
Heat ceased displacing outward; the kitchen’s walls cooled, whistles lowered, and the realm’s marrow sighed like iron easing in oil. <words>326</words>
But Salt reminded him that the price of forgiveness is never paid once; it renews interest each moment silence is tempted. <words>347</words>
Therefore Malthus tied the final knot around his own wrist, pledging to guard not the cauldron, but every apology unborn. <words>367</words>
Cosmic silence retreated, yet hovered like a creditor, and the infernal kitchen resumed its chores under the faintest steam of mercy. <words>388</words>
Malthus, still distracted but now listening, kept stirring the ribboned knot in the cauldron, rehearsing every future sorry within its broth. <words>409</words>
