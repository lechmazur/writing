<story>
The hush of a grocery store at midnight is a brittle bubble where frothy despair can hear itself think.<words>19</words>
I patrol its fluorescent aisles as the kindly guard, loyally disloyal to the corporate quiet I am paid to preserve.<words>39</words>
Some nights the cereal boxes whisper of skylines, and my heart answers, aching to seize the horizon's hidden promise.<words>58</words>
Tonight the whisper becomes a doorway, its edges soft as the soft edges of time itself, and I step through.<words>78</words>
Suddenly I sit in the Floating Island Cloud Cafe, chairs dangling above vapor, silver trays skating on currents of mist.<words>98</words>
A waitress shaped from cumulonimbus places before me a basic measuring spoon that gleams like a miniature moon.<words>116</words>
She says the spoon can stir the minutes until they foam, freeing me from schedules that curdle the soul.<words>135</words>
But to earn it, she commands me to worship the unseen barista who percolates destiny, speaking with the rhythm of a typewriter's keys.<words>158</words>
The clack and ding of invisible letters strike my chest, each syllable hammering permission to abandon the ground-bound world.<words>177</words>
In that mechanical chant, I glimpse shelf after shelf collapsing back in the store, gaps opening like bleached coral caves.<words>197</words>
I remember the promised raise that never arrived, the cameras that watched me soothe crying children yet flagged me for overtime theft.<words>219</words>
Loyally disloyal, I decide the store deserves its empty aisles, and I deserve the spoon that ladles dawn from clouds.<words>239</words>
So I lift the utensil, swirl it through the vaporous cappuccino of time, and taste minutes stretched into velvet eternity.<words>259</words>
The horizon tilts closer, a citrus ribbon that puckers my lips with hope, and the floating cafe drifts toward it like foam.<words>281</words>
Yet frothy despair clings to my uniform, fizzing that I may crash back through the doorway and clock in before dawn.<words>302</words>
The waitress nods toward the spoon, reminding me that every bubble must burst somewhere, so better in sky than linoleum.<words>322</words>
I relinquish my badge, let it tumble through the clouds like a dull coin, and the cafe patrons cheer in clattering Morse.<words>344</words>
Their applause sounds exactly like groceries scanning, a final beep that seals the register of my previous life shut.<words>363</words>
Ahead, the horizon's hidden promise unfurls, not gold or glory, but infinite seconds to spend guarding nothing except my own unfolding self.<words>385</words>
I sip them slowly, each swallow a tiny act of worship for the soft edges of time that finally blur into mercy.<words>407</words>
