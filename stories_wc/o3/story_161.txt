I arrived at the municipal paper airplane test facility precisely at dawn, because a vigilant orchardist who is never tardy refuses to let tragedy dictate the clock.<words>27</words>
The jagged scent of folded cardstock was a poor substitute for my burnt apple groves, yet throughout volunteering here I cultivated determination like new rootstock.<words>52</words>
Management paid me in leftover staplers and sardonic glee, unaware I also harvested rumors drifting through the hangar like pests I used to trap among blossoms.<words>78</words>
Conspiracies, I’d learned, ripen in shade, and the facility’s peculiar accidents hinted at worms munching the budgetary core.<words>96</words>
To unravel them I needed an unlikely microscope, so I carried my grandmother’s antique letter seal, its brass face engraved with a peacock forever fanning luxuriant eyes.<words>123</words>
By pressing the seal into wax dripped on each prototype’s nose cone, I created colorful talons of evidence nobody noticed.<words>143</words>
Later, during calibration flights, the heated air revealed micro–turbulence patterns mirroring the peacock's tail; every missing feather corresponded to a vanished line item.<words>166</words>
I invited the accountants to watch me demonstrate, pretending the discovery merely improved glide ratios.<words>181</words>
They chuckled like beetles until I projected the tail diagram beside expense reports and the room went orchard-quiet.<words>199</words>
Each iridescent swirl, I explained with sugar‑coated malice, matched invoices for bolts never purchased, balsa unpaid, and payroll ghosts haunting the ledger.<words>221</words>
They asked how an orchardist knew aeronautical fraud, and I reminded them fruit trees gossip when wind tunnels whine nearby.<words>241</words>
Also, I added, losing my parents to arson had sharpened my nose for smoke, no matter the medium.<words>259</words>
The auditors arrived, smelling political fertilizer, and I guided them with punctual farmer's precision through records I’d already cross‑pollinated with annotations.<words>280</words>
Exposure germinated panic; executives scattered like startled starlings, while I watched from the catwalk, tasting vindication as tart as unripe crabapple.<words>301</words>
Yet triumph alone cannot heal barren acreage, so I bartered my whistleblower reward for saplings and irrigation lines.<words>319</words>
The facility, desperate for rebranding, agreed to host community orchards beside the runways, claiming corporate greening while I reclaimed my heritage.<words>340</words>
Every Saturday I still volunteer, never tardy, pruning young branches as paper jets swoop overhead, their shadows striped like a peacock’s prophecy come true.<words>364</words>
Children from the nearby school launch prototypes, and I teach them to read airflow the way I once read bark, reminding them that patterns speak even when authorities mumble.<words>393</words>
One inquisitive girl asks why I smile when exposing liars.<words>403</words>
Because, I reply, rot deserves sunlight, and sunlight is free if you arrive on time.<words>418</words>
