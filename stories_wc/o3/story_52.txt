Granite dust drifted in lazy spirals within the colossal hourglass that cradled the time-worn marketplace. <words>15</words>
Stalls sagged like resigned grandparents, yet commerce clung on with the stubborn cheer of weeds. <words>30</words>
Among the shuffle of bargain hunters prowled Nix, a hopeful pickpocket who despised despair almost as much as poverty. <words>49</words>
He fingered a broken pencil sharpener pilfered moments earlier, its mangled blade glinting like a crooked smile. <words>66</words>
The trinket was worthless, yet he kept it, believing every damaged thing awaited someone's faith. <words>81</words>
That afternoon, when chalk lines on the sidewalk fade away under soft foot traffic, faith arrived wearing red suede boots. <words>101</words>
She was Miri, a street singer of tastefully offensive ballads that made grandmothers tut and teenagers howl. <words>118</words>
Her voice rang at once sunlit and rusted, and something in its wobble promised the depths of devotion. <words>136</words>
Nix followed the melody through leaning stalls until he bumped elbows with her beside a crate of withered figs. <words>155</words>
Their apology overlapped, words colliding like marbles, and somehow a spontaneous karaoke duet materialized from the chaos. <words>172</words>
Vendors tapped crates as makeshift drums, sand sifted from the hourglass ceiling like gleaming confetti, and shoppers laughed. <words>190</words>
The tune told of clocks that swallowed lovers, and everyone cheered because tragedy felt safer when rhymed. <words>207</words>
When the last chorus dissolved, Nix slipped the broken pencil sharpener into Miri's palm instead of her pocket. <words>225</words>
She studied the jagged metal, eyebrows arching like sails adjusting to sudden wind. <words>238</words>
Why gift trash, she asked, half amused, half wary. <words>247</words>
Because it knows what it was meant to do but canâ€™t, like me, he replied, tasting rusted honesty. <words>265</words>
His voice kept a blithe discontent, joking about destiny while bleeding fear between syllables. <words>279</words>
Miri recognized the sound; singers hear secrets the way fishermen read clouds. <words>291</words>
She led him to an alcove where obsolete sundials were sold as souvenirs. <words>304</words>
There she demanded the story that scorched his tongue. <words>313</words>
Nix confessed he once lifted a ring from a dying courier and thereby erased a final vow meant for Miri. <words>333</words>
He had pawned it, bought bread, survived, but the guilt metastasized brighter than hunger. <words>347</words>
The secret seared his soul, yet until this fading-chalk afternoon he had no one to share it with. <words>365</words>
Miri's lashes fluttered like torn pages, but she listened, tasting the grief he brewed. <words>379</words>
Then she laughed, not cruelly, but with the daring mercy of someone climbing out of their own coffin. <words>397</words>
Devotion, she said, pressing the ruined sharpener to his chest, is fixing what you broke, not vanishing from it. <words>416</words>
Together they returned to the stage of dusty stalls, announcing they would trade any song for news of a lost ring. <words>437</words>
Under cascading grains of sand, their karaoke duet rose again, hopeful, tastefully offensive, and utterly devoted to repair. <words>455</words>
