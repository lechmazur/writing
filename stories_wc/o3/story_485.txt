<story>
I piloted my rusted skimmer downward through collapsing pillars of coral, toward the forgotten underwater city laboratory. <words>17</words>
Even in shivering darkness, its fractured grace glittered like a cracked pearl begging to be remembered. <words>33</words>
I, Marrow the brazen raider, had come not to plunder but to protect. <words>46</words>
Above, surface nations rioted; amid such social upheaval, geniuses burned out like matchheads in hurricane winds. <words>62</words>
Down here flickered the last ideas of Dr. Lyre, my once‑teacher, now a faltering genius secluded by guilt. <words>80</words>
Rumor said she tested weapons that sang through water, and the echoes of betrayal drowned her conscience. <words>97</words>
I carried my warning like contraband light. <words>104</words>
Yet I was impulsively thoughtful, pausing to recall childish myths before every irreversible door. <words>118</words>
Superstition said you spoke a lock's true name with charcoal to mute lurking spirits. <words>132</words>
So instead of plasma cutters, I drew letters across the alloy hatch using a soot‑blackened piece of charcoal. <words>150</words>
Metal sighed, and the door unlatched as if remembering more courteous centuries. <words>162</words>
Inside, glass globes clung to vines of tubing, glowing faintly like ghosts trapped by their own equations. <words>179</words>
I found Lyre hunched over a sputtering burner, shielding its blue kernel with trembling gloves. <words>194</words>
Her eyes, once charts of confident constellations, were now sea‑storm hollows. <words>205</words>
She startled when she saw my raider armor, mistaking me for yet another creditor of revolution. <words>221</words>
I knelt, laid the charcoal before her like a treaty, and told her why I had descended. <words>238</words>
Assassins tracked her formulae, I said, intent on twisting them into tidal bombs; I came to warn. <words>255</words>
The word shivered between us, stirring sediment and memories. <words>264</words>
Years ago she had betrayed my cohort to secure funding, and my scars still hummed with saltwater pain. <words>282</words>
Yet somehow I recalled her gentleness when teaching simple buoyancy by floating paper lanterns over a moonlit pool. <words>300</words>
That memory, an anemone of soft light, guided my impulsively thoughtful heart more than vengeance did. <words>316</words>
Lyre listened, then reached for the charcoal, smearing formulas into protective sigils across the burner’s rim. <words>332</words>
By revisiting those youthful superstitions, she steadied herself, as though belief itself could seal cracks in destiny. <words>349</words>
Together we transformed the lab into a refuge, booby‑trapping corridors with collapsing pressure riffs only we could navigate. <words>367</words>
Outside, sonar echoes announced pursuers, muffled by distance yet swollen with the certainty of betrayal renewed. <words>383</words>
We extinguished all lights except the burner’s thin flame, the fragile intellect we conspired to shelter. <words>399</words>
Its glow breathed like a living code, promising new sciences that could heal instead of drown. <words>415</words>
As footsteps reverberated through the flooded colonnades, I gripped my spear and grinned with reckless reverence. <words>431</words>
Let them come, I thought; the city still remembered how to swallow traitors, and tonight it fought for us. <words>450</words>
