Garnet Rill, an uncertain alchemist with burn‑stained gloves, hovered over the floating marketplace tethered to hot air balloons.<words>18</words>
The entire bazaar creaked like a ship, yet its merchants discussed tinctures as casually as bread, radiating mundane miracles.<words>37</words>
Garnet came bearing a cracked scale from a mythical beast, wrapped in oilcloth and doubt.<words>52</words>
She believed it could distill a draught of endless years, but feared the price of immortality hidden inside its ridged translucence.<words>73</words>
Her commission, absurdly, was to map forest trails rumored to rearrange themselves each solstice, a task demanding decades no mortal possessed.<words>94</words>
So she sought the draught, not for glory, but to finish a cartographer’s promise to her late mentor.<words>112</words>
Yet the scale's fissures whispered of curses no recipe could neutralize.<words>123</words>
To safeguard her own soul, she needed verification from Argos the Floorwright, a technically wild savant who read histories from scratches.<words>144</words>
Argos kept court beneath the central canopy, where tiles of centuries‑old marble had been repurposed as cargo ballast.<words>162</words>
Legends said the coded scuffs on that floor described every bargain the marketplace had ever witnessed, if one knew the syntax of wear.<words>185</words>
Garnet arrived exactly at the hush before the judge reads the verdict in Argos’s ongoing dispute with gravity.<words>203</words>
Merchants gripped ropes, bags, and breath as the platform tilted, awaiting the sentence that would determine whether more sandbags must be cut loose.<words>226</words>
In that silence, Argos traced a toe along the marble, reading the scuffs like braille, then gestured for Garnet to come forward.<words>248</words>
He pressed the cracked scale against the floor, aligning its jagged vein to a particular groove, and murmured, "Payment recorded."<words>268</words>
The scuffs flared silver, revealing a tale of a queen who bought immortality, only to wander endlessly because kingdoms finished before she did.<words>291</words>
Argos's eyes softened: "Your map would never end, same as her march."<words>303</words>
Garnet felt the board beneath her boots tilt further, a reminder that even skyborne stalls obey old weights.<words>321</words>
She pictured endless seasons alone in shifting woods, her charts forever unfinished, immortality purchasing only perpetual incompletion.<words>338</words>
With trembling resolve, she broke the scale fully, letting its powder drift off the platform like dull snow.<words>356</words>
The marketplace sighed, the verdict bell chimed acquittal, and gravity released its grip; balloons steadied as if honoring her choice.<words>376</words>
Argos tucked a chalk fragment into her palm, whispering directions only partially found on earthbound maps.<words>392</words>
"Trace forests while you breathe," he said, "then rest, and let younger feet finish the wandering."<words>408</words>
Garnet smiled, not immortal yet somehow endless, because ordinary lifespan felt, in that lifted hush, like the most practical miracle.<words>428</words>
