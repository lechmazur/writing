Latch, the sentient doll collector, drifted across the humming nectar collection facility after midnight, searching for lost echoes.<words>18</words>
His porcelain eyelids flickered with ethereal grit, a shimmer of stubborn dust against the sterile chrome vats.<words>35</words>
He carried a twisted carnival cane whose spiral stripes seemed painted from forgotten carnival nights and centrifuged nebulae.<words>53</words>
The cane was no mere affectation; it housed magnets that guided him through the iron doors like a conductor's baton.<words>73</words>
Latch had come before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, when silence still owns every threshold.<words>91</words>
In that hush, he meant to uphold a promise he once stitched into a doll's velvet heart.<words>108</words>
The promise, expectantly resigned, told him he would trade his curated innocence for a path into untamed dawns.<words>126</words>
He sought, therefore, to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, and the facility's fences were merely the first veil.<words>145</words>
Vats pulsed, syringes clicked, and syrups the color of moonlit bruises sloshed into amber reservoirs.<words>160</words>
Each drop of nectar was rumored to feed the chorus of healing, that cosmic resonance able to knit galaxies back together.<words>181</words>
Latch believed the chorus would restore the cracked bisque souls of his dolls, and maybe his own chipped awareness.<words>200</words>
But first, he had to align the vats with night’s cartography by following star paths etched onto the cane.<words>219</words>
With each tap against the grated floor, constellations flared on its lacquer and repositioned machinery as though magnetized by myth.<words>239</words>
Mechanical arms obeyed, swiveling toward skylights where no sky yet existed, because dawn had not negotiated with matter.<words>257</words>
Under the shifting glow, vats began to sing, their vents exhaling chords that tasted like copper honey on synthetic tongues.<words>277</words>
That vibration merged with distant celestial murmurs, weaving the first threads of the chorus of healing into the sterile air.<words>297</words>
Latch felt fractures in his ceramic spine mend unevenly, a relief edged with splinters, like mercy learned from storms.<words>316</words>
Yet the nectar levels were dropping too swiftly, siphoned by unseen siphons hidden beneath bureaucratic labels.<words>332</words>
If the vats emptied, the song would die unborn, and boundaries would reknit like scar tissue around reality’s throat.<words>351</words>
Determined, he tilted the twisted carnival cane skyward, letting its spirals reflect the hidden stars beneath the roof’s panels.<words>370</words>
Those reflections became portals; through them poured ancient light, thick as nectar, refilling the vats with luminous resolve.<words>388</words>
The chorus of healing crescendoed, and the facility walls shimmered transparent, revealing an orchard of sleeping universes beyond.<words>406</words>
With expectantly resigned calm, Latch lifted the smallest doll from his satchel and set it afloat toward the orchard.<words>425</words>
The doll’s button eyes caught starlight, and it sailed across the new boundary, humming the facility’s song in miniature.<words>444</words>
Latch followed, joints creaking a brave staccato, ready to uphold his promise in worlds where dolls might choose their own names.<words>465</words>
