I stepped through the flickering airlock into the abandoned space station control room, feeling equal currents of dust and bored excitement swirl around my boots. <words>25</words>
Not bad for someone everyone called the most underachieving mage in the agricultural quadrant. <words>39</words>
Great-grandmother's bloodline once steered orbiting irrigation satellites, and I had arrived to reclaim that heritage before the surrounding farmland was auctioned away. <words>61</words>
The station, however, had locked itself behind rituals I had never properly mastered, a concrete reminder of my exceptionally usual talent level. <words>83</words>
Then the first misdelivered package arrived at my bunk hut at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, addressed to a mage far worthier than I. <words>110</words>
Inside rested a porcelain doll head whose blinking eyes clicked like minute-hands, a creepy metronome that nevertheless whispered possibilities. <words>129</words>
More packages followed, each containing spell components I had flunked during academy tolerances, all forwarded by some lazy courier drunk on planetshine. <words>151</words>
I sensed a pattern, so I taped the shipping labels into constellations across my workbench until an activation rune unveiled itself to me. <words>174</words>
The rune demanded four things: the doll head, the control room, a signature in star-ink, and a willingness to spring a trap on my own limitations. <words>200</words>
So I packed the blinking head and trudged back to orbit in a derelict cargo shuttle that rattled like a scarecrow's bones. <words>222</words>
Inside the control room, I placed the head on the cracked console where holographic crop graphs once glowed. <words>240</words>
Its eyelids clicked thrice, projecting green light that crawled over dormant panels and gutted wiring. <words>255</words>
The mislabeled components simmered within my satchel like nervous frogs, begging to be thrown into the spell. <words>272</words>
With the indifference of someone used to failure, I sprinkled them across the console in the order the labels had suggested. <words>293</words>
A hush, exceptionally usual for empty stations, settled before every screen burst alive, each showing ghostly recordings of my ancestors irrigating continents from this very chair. <words>319</words>
Their mastery wasn't taunting; it was invitation. <words>326</words>
I pressed my palm upon the doll head and felt the trap snap, not on me, but around the doubt gnawing my ribs since graduation. <words>351</words>
Energy that once slipped like irrigation runoff now pooled, coherent, heavy, waiting for command. <words>365</words>
The station lights climbed through spectrums, and the farmland below lit up in neat blue rectangles spelling my family name across fallow soil. <words>388</words>
Buyers would see that signal and think twice, because heritage, once unveiled, negotiates harder than any auctioneer. <words>405</words>
I laughed, a sound both bored and excited, as orbital sprinklers reactivated and hissed applause against the hull. <words>423</words>
Underachievement had been a costume mailed to me by mistake; I'd finally returned it to sender. <words>439</words>
Outside, tractors paused, their operators raising visors to witness a sky rewritten by an exceptionally usual mage embracing the extraordinary. <words>459</words>
Limitations, I realized, are just packages waiting to be redirected. <words>469</words>
