Static snow danced across the ragged screen while the old projector flickers in an abandoned movie house, its sprockets coughing like aging wolves.<words>23</words>
Jasper, who considered himself merely a passing backpacker, did not know he was an unknowing heir to any kingdom but his own pockets.<words>46</words>
The theater clung to Magnetic Mountain, its iron veins humming faintly beneath floorboards, coaxing compass needles to spin like giddy ballerinas.<words>67</words>
This invisible waltz seeded in him the quiet hunger for secrets salted between dust motes and broken reels.<words>85</words>
He rummaged under the seats and produced a tarnished silver spoon, its bowl dented yet reflecting the screen's monochrome ghosts.<words>105</words>
A trivially monumental thrill rushed through him, absurdly large for such a small object, like finding thunder trapped inside a thimble.<words>126</words>
Compelled, he scraped the spoon along a flaking wall, and paint began to churn off in curling ribbons.<words>144</words>
Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, a procession of crowned coyotes emerged, each bearing lanterns that glowed with magnetic dew.<words>167</words>
Their leader, painted in impossible perspective, extended a paw toward the spoon as though inviting Jasper into celluloid royalty.<words>186</words>
The projector coughed again, and the mural seemed to ripple, syncing frames with frescos until reality hiccupped.<words>203</words>
For a heartbeat, Jasper saw himself seated upon Magnetic Mountain's summit, crowned not by gold but by static light, drafting treaties with whirlwinds.<words>226</words>
The vision shimmered with frolicsome regret, as though destiny apologized for arriving late yet still bringing party confetti.<words>244</words>
He realized, absurdly, that the coyotes waited for him to choose whether to co-author a future with chaos or keep scribbling on postcards.<words>267</words>
The quiet hunger growled louder, not of stomach but of possibility, and the spoon warmed like a sly contract in his palm.<words>289</words>
He tapped its handle against the mural's horizon line, and the coyotes' lanterns flared, scattering sparks that smelled of rewound summers.<words>310</words>
A door behind the screen creaked, revealing a stairway spiraling upward where magnetic veins glowed like midnight streetlights.<words>328</words>
Jasper pocketed the spoon, straightened his frayed jacket, and stepped into the climb, each plank thrumming yes, yes, yes.<words>347</words>
Below, the projector sputtered its final frame, dissolving the coyotes into drifting motes that spelled good luck in Morse before vanishing.<words>368</words>
Somewhere between popcorn scent memories and the iron heartbeat of the mountain, an heir ascended, half-laughing at how easily history peels.<words>389</words>
Chaos, he suspected, made an excellent co-author precisely because it never erased, only scribbled additional exclamation points on the margins.<words>409</words>
