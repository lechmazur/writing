<story>
The abandoned waiting area at the derelict station pulsed with screaming silence. <words>12</words>
Shards of moonlight painted crooked stripes across plastic chairs once bright with numbered tickets. <words>26</words>
In that hush, Callen, a subdued vigilante, whispered apologies to forgotten echoes. <words>38</words>
His mission demanded stealth, yet destiny had cursed him with artfully clumsy hands. <words>51</words>
Every footfall sounded like porcelain shattering, despite his careful breathing and wrapped boots. <words>64</words>
Tonight he hunted wisdom, not criminals, eager to master an ancient art. <words>76</words>
The art—long hidden—supposedly unlocked by tracking distortions in an antique funhouse mirror. <words>88</words>
That mirror leaned against cracked tile, reflecting mutilated fragments of the room and of him. <words>103</words>
War had once raged here when factions fought over transit lines, and Callen still paid the price. <words>120</words>
Shrapnel memories burned inside his ribs, reminding him that the price of war is never past. <words>136</words>
Seeking redemption, he used the mirror during virtual calls with unseen mentors across ruined cities. <words>151</words>
Bandwidth ghosts crackled, coaches chose soft compliments to flatter his fragile perseverance. <words>163</words>
Callen bowed before the glass, holding a plain wooden bead between index and thumb. <words>177</words>
The bead, salvaged from a child's bracelet found beneath rubble, served as his compass. <words>191</words>
When the mirror's warped corridors aligned, the bead supposedly would glow with borrowed starlight. <words>205</words>
Instead it remained dull, reminding him again of his awkward nature. <words>216</words>
Determined, he traced faint scratches on the mirror, mapping distortions as mentors instructed. <words>229</words>
Every time his palm brushed the surface, reflections rippled like wounded water. <words>241</words>
Out of those ripples, phantom silhouettes of soldiers emerged, mouths moving in mute agony. <words>255</words>
Screaming silence thickened, and Callen understood the mirror demanded tribute before teaching. <words>267</words>
He pressed the bead against the glass and spoke names of friends lost to shellfire. <words>282</words>
The wooden sphere warmed, veins of flame threading its humble grain. <words>293</words>
Distortions twisted, rearranging chairs into towering gateways no architect could blueprint. <words>304</words>
Past those spectral arches, he glimpsed a battlefield rewound into blossom-filled terraces. <words>316</words>
The vision offered hope: learn the art, reshape trauma, purchase peace with memory. <words>329</words>
Yet payment required giving up anonymity, stepping from subdued vigilante to guiding architect. <words>342</words>
The bead pulsed again, urging decision before moonlight died. <words>351</words>
Callen's mentors murmured encouragement through the call, unaware cameras showed only flickering static. <words>364</words>
He realized they were projections of the mirror, crafted to flatter and challenge simultaneously. <words>378</words>
Accepting the test, he straightened with deliberate poise, transforming his artfully clumsy stance into ceremony. <words>393</words>
He whispered an oath to repay every scream of silence with gardens of quiet forgiveness. <words>408</words>
The waiting area brightened, not with sound, but with the hush of wounds knitting. <words>422</words>
Outside, distant sirens faded; inside, the plain wooden bead shone like dawn over ashes. <words>436</words>
For the first time, Callen smiled, aware that mastering the art meant ending the war within. <words>452</words>
The mirror dulled, accepting its fee, and the vigilante walked into newborn silence unafraid. <words>466</words>
