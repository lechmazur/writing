In the short pause following a newborn’s first cry, the dandelion field exhaled misty gold.<words>15</words>
Far beyond the birthing cottage, a feral ranger knelt among the blooms, steady yet shaking.<words>30</words>
His name was Niven, a man raised by storms and guided by unfiltered perception alone.<words>45</words>
Every scent, sound, and shimmer arrived raw, before judgment, like dew on untrodden leaves.<words>59</words>
Tonight that awareness hummed louder than the crickets.<words>67</words>
He waited for a coded message he knew would flutter his ribs.<words>79</words>
Across the field, midwives burned afterbirth on iron, smoke curling toward the night like prayer.<words>94</words>
From the fumes drifted ash petals that settled on his weathered brass balance scale.<words>108</words>
He carried the relic to weigh promises against risk, a ritual both useless and sacred.<words>123</words>
The newborn’s lull between sobs timed the opening of possibility, precisely random yet wholly fated.<words>138</words>
During that hush, Niven’s arms tingled, and the scale’s pans began to quiver.<words>151</words>
Tiny paper slips whisked across the grass, invoices from the village store blown free of bins.<words>167</words>
Their ink seemed commonplace, yet Niven had learned to read futures through code words in receipts.<words>183</words>
He caught one labeled 'Return—Tomorrow—Unknown' and placed it on the left pan.<words>195</words>
Another slip bore only the spiral symbol the midwives stitched inside newborn blankets.<words>208</words>
He set that on the right, then watched the beam tilt, searching for direction.<words>222</words>
The heavier side would mark his path, his motive, his next breath.<words>234</words>
It settled level, impossibly balanced, inviting him to embrace the unknown with open arms.<words>248</words>
Hope swelled, yet sorrow lingered like dusk that refuses to finish dying.<words>260</words>
He sensed the child would live, but not here, and that departure would bruise many hearts.<words>276</words>
Accepting the bittersweet weight, he raised the slips to his lips and breathed.<words>289</words>
Ash scattered skyward, forming fleeting constellations that traced a road beyond the orchard’s edge.<words>303</words>
Niven stood, knees crackling like thawing ice, and faced that invisible highway.<words>315</words>
Around him, dandelion clocks released seeds, each orb a tiny compass trembling with possibility.<words>329</words>
He gathered a fistful, pockets soon brimming with fragile parachutes.<words>339</words>
The field whispered, urging haste before the newborn’s next wail shattered the membrane of time.<words>354</words>
With one last look toward the cottage, he let the scale hang at his belt.<words>369</words>
Its brass glimmer echoed both grief and gladness, as if mourning could illuminate.<words>382</words>
He stepped forward, seeds swirling around him like a silent retinue, and the night accepted.<words>397</words>
Somewhere behind, the child inhaled and cried again, sealing the ranger’s choice with fragile thunder.<words>412</words>
Niven vanished into the darkness, hopeful melancholy draped over his shoulders like a half-remembered lullaby.<words>427</words>
