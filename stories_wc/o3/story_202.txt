Dust powdered the moonlit rafters of the Found Object Museum, letting dusty starlight settle over forgotten curios.<words>17</words>
Jem Kestrel, reputed as a careful poisoner yet somehow innocently guilty in every courtroom, rolled silently through the aisles on a battered skateboard.<words>40</words>
The security guards found skateboarding a harmless eccentricity, unaware that Jem rode to test the edges of gravity and the patience of alarms.<words>63</words>
Tonight he chased a scavenger hunt mapped only in his mind, a trail of cryptic clues he had hidden months before.<words>84</words>
Each clue would authenticate the next, verifying that the code of instinct guiding him remained unbroken.<words>100</words>
First waypoint: an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt, displayed between typewriter keys and a melted trumpet.<words>117</words>
He coasted, spinning the board, and let inertia slide him to the weapon's pedestal.<words>131</words>
On the glass case lay a speck of dried violet syrup—his own venom recipe—proof that no curator had tampered.<words>150</words>
He inhaled, satisfied, because poison was conversation to him, and silence meant the dialogue was intact.<words>166</words>
Second waypoint awaited behind the assemblage of broken clocks: a brass yo‑yo etched with spirals, balancing time and toyhood.<words>185</words>
He ollied over a pile of cracked globes, feeling gravity tug like a stern parent and then let go.<words>204</words>
The yo‑yo's half shells contained a rolled vellum strip bearing a single charcoal arrow pointing toward the attic stairs.<words>223</words>
Jem kicked, wheels rasping, and soared up the plank ramp the night janitors had abandoned, almost horizontal against emptiness.<words>242</words>
In that brief tilt the world felt like a coin spinning on nothing, its edges whispering secrets about risk and control.<words>263</words>
The attic smelled of wood dust and meteorite filings, as though the ceiling filtered space itself into powder.<words>281</words>
There, beneath collapsed mannequins, rested the final waypoint: a tarnished metal bottle shaped like a sigh.<words>297</words>
He unscrewed the cap and found, floating in stale air, a tiny card that read, 'Instinct affirmed—now drink.'<words>315</words>
Jem laughed, a quiet sound sharper than shattering glass, because he recognised his own handwriting and the dare it contained.<words>335</words>
He poured a grey droplet on the rapier's cracked hilt downstairs, letting the metal hiss, then licked the residue.<words>354</words>
Not lethal, merely dizzying—a poison measured like poetry, intended for its author alone.<words>367</words>
Vertigo blossomed; the museum tilted, rails bending like reeds, and wheels spun though the board stood still.<words>384</words>
He had wanted to test the edges of gravity, and now gravity examined him back, an impartial examiner.<words>402</words>
Through wobbling vision he saw the guards rush, their flashlights carving cones through dusty starlight, but none could decode his smile.<words>423</words>
They would label him thief, vandal, maybe mad, yet he felt innocently guilty, as if the verdict predated the crime.<words>443</words>
The code of instinct had been authenticated by nausea and wonder, sealing the night like wax over a royal decree.<words>463</words>
When they lifted him onto the gurney, wheels squeaking like baby comets, he whispered the scavenger hunt's last clue into the dark: 'fall upward.'<words>487</words>
