Karis Halstrom, the most overworked policy enforcer in our oceanic utopia, had not slept for three tidal cycles when the emergency klaxon wailed. <words>23</words>
She sprinted along bioluminescent corridors toward the kelp forest observation post, clutching the rustic bread box assigned as her inexplicable evidence kit. <words>45</words>
Its cedar slats smelled of earth, absurdly nostalgic amid towers grown from coral algorithms. <words>59</words>
Director Ilya met her with laughing tears, the kind that glimmer when disbelief wrestles duty. <words>74</words>
"Your shift extends," he joked, then pointed at the panoramic glass where shapes like translucent antlers drifted among kelp fronds. <words>94</words>
Policy dictated that no entity enter the sanctuary unlogged, yet these apparitions tripped no sensors, broke no laws, respected no utopian rubric. <words>116</words>
Karis had trained to guide citizens, not ghosts, but her mandate was absolute compliance, even with phenomena the manuals politely ignored. <words>137</words>
She opened the bread box, discovering a drum carved from hollow kelp, its membrane shimmering like a bubble of moonlit brine. <words>158</words>
A note inside, printed on seashell fibre, read: GENUINELY FAKE-USE ONLY WHEN REALITY MISBEHAVES. <words>172</words>
Director Ilya, voice trembling between mirth and dread, said the promise ceremony for newborn Reef-Cycle Twenty-Six began in thirty seconds, exactitude compulsory. <words>194</words>
At the exact second a promise is sworn, legends warned, the membrane between worlds thins like surf pulled from stone. <words>214</words>
Karis realized the antlered phantoms were punctual guests, arriving to witness that sacred vow, perhaps to grade it. <words>232</words>
Fear rose like cold silt, yet she remembered her meditation mantra: greet fear as a necessary teacher. <words>249</words>
Smiling until tears escaped, she beat the kelp drum with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance, heart syncing to its primal pulse. <words>274</words>
The observation post's walls dissolved into swirling aquamarine tunnels, and the phantoms merged into a single towering figure wearing a crown of bioluminescent barnacles. <words>298</words>
It bowed to Karis, echoing her drumbeat, and through its translucence she saw every policy she had ever enforced flutter past like jellyfish scrolls. <words>322</words>
The figure guided her hand to stamp APPROVED across the newborn promise, then faded, leaving only the genuinely fake drum humming with continuing laughter. <words>346</words>
Exhaustion lifted; Karis felt oddly rested, as if the supernatural audit had balanced her overloaded ledgers with cosmic humor. <words>365</words>
Ilya, still crying and laughing, whispered that the utopia was safe for another cycle, thanks to her unorthodox compliance. <words>384</words>
Karis tucked the drum inside the bread box, promising to open it whenever fear knocked, and she laughed until tears salted the sea around her. <words>409</words>
