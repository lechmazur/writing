In the abandoned spaceport waiting area, I sit on a cracked plastic bench, palms dusty with history, pretending calm while revolution hums like faulty fluorescents above my head. <words>28</words>
I am Karn the underdog magician, failed stage hopeful, unwelcome conjurer of offworld bazaars, yet chosen by broken dreams to start what others only whisper about. <words>54</words>
The subtle uprising, they call it, not loud banners or plasma rifles, but tiny tilts of perception that slip past scanners and lodge inside the quiet corners of sleep. <words>83</words>
My motive, my curse, is to decode dream symbols for the scattered colonists, because every forbidden sign revealed becomes another unsounded drumbeat of defiance. <words>107</words>
I stare through a battered brass microscope pilfered from the port infirmary, adjusting its cracked lens ring until nebular dust motes bloom into alphabetic galaxies. <words>132</words>

I adopt rebellious placidity, smoothing my robe, and saunter toward the officer as if performing a casual trick for tips in some thriving promenade. <words>296</words>
He demands credentials; I offer the microscope, invite him to witness the miniature storm of colors swirling inside, then whisper a syllable that turns curiosity into narcotic awe. <words>324</words>
While his pupils dilate like eclipses, I slip past, etching a fresh symbol with chalk on the departure board, synchronizing it to the stalled countdown's pulse. <words>350</words>
Soon hundreds of dreamers will pass this glyph in their slumber, and the uprising will spread not through riots but through the soft conviction that reality can be rewritten. <words>379</words>
I gather my deck of bent cards, the only stage left to me, and vanish into access tunnel thirteen, carrying the quiet thunder of possibility in my pocket. <words>407</words>
