<story>
Petal, a nomadic dreamer whose manners were ferociously polite, arrived in the village flower‑pressing workshop just before dusk.<words>18</words>
The hush after a coin toss decides fate hung in the air, though no one could recall flipping anything.<words>37</words>
Inside, presses clamped rose, fern, and larkspur between blotting pages that smelled of rain‑washed parchment and unresolved promises.<words>55</words>
Petal fingered the brass mariner’s wheel dangling from their satchel, the only remnant of oceans crossed in restless sleep.<words>74</words>
Its spokes spun whenever Petal whispered latitude, as if charting a route through dreams rather than saltwater.<words>91</words>
Tonight, the wheel trembled, signaling the moment to intervene.<words>100</words>
A select group in candlelit aprons waited, each bearing scars shaped like petals—a secret mission had been entrusted to them.<words>120</words>
Their leader, Elder Bloom, bowed with cutting courtesy that felt almost like a duel, such was his masked intention.<words>139</words>
He requested Petal’s help to calm the roots under the village, which had begun writhing against stone foundations.<words>157</words>
If nature’s hurt grew louder, the valley would burst into blossom and ruin at once, a paradox of anguished joy.<words>177</words>
Petal agreed, but only if harmony replaced mere quiet; suppression felt like pruning wings off migrating swans.<words>194</words>
Elder Bloom smiled ferociously polite, teeth bright as shears, and produced a coin crafted from pressed petals and sap.<words>213</words>
He flipped it; the room froze in that hush after a coin toss decides fate, listening for destiny’s landing.<words>232</words>
The coin never struck table; instead it dissolved into pollen that drifted downward, settling on the mariner’s wheel.<words>250</words>
Spokes whirred, casting rings of dim green light, and a map bloomed across the workshop floor, depicting subterranean rivers.<words>269</words>
Petal stepped onto the glowing lines, feeling every heartbeat of root and water as sorrow and hope entwined.<words>287</words>
With voice softened by distance traveled, they sang lullabies taught by coastal winds, asking earth to breathe with gentler cadence.<words>307</words>
Roots listened; presses unclamped themselves, releasing petals that rose like colored sighs and drifted into cracks, soothing tension.<words>325</words>
Elder Bloom’s eyes glossed with defeat and wonder, his masked intentions peeled back to reveal genuine awe.<words>342</words>
He had hoped for dominion; instead harmony unfolded, and the revelation hurt him sweetly, an anguished joy none envied.<words>361</words>
Petal, trembling yet serene, offered the wheel to the gathered apprentices, entrusting navigation of dreams to their newly humbled hands.<words>381</words>
The apprentices bowed ferociously polite, promising to wander, listen, and intervene only when balance trembled near breaking.<words>398</words>
Outside, moonlight found every released petal and pressed it gently against the sky, preserving this night forever.<words>415</words>
