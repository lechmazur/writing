Within the folds of spacetime, the mechanical bird sanctuary shimmered like a chrome aviary suspended between yesterdays and tomorrows. <words>19</words>
Its begrudging guardian, Sela Morcant, always wore a scowl beneath oil-smeared goggles, yet her eyes flickered with a dangerously friendly glint. <words>40</words>
At night, she would illustrate ticking sparrows on scrap metal panels while analyzing dreamlike postcards from an unknown island that arrived without stamps or explanation. <words>65</words>
Each postcard depicted bread baked in suns that rose sideways, always served on a rustic bread paddle carved with spirals that seemed to pulse under her touch. <words>92</words>
The images whispered of flavors forgotten by a society that kept everyone full yet starved of taste, a society whose grip she felt tightening daily. <words>117</words>
She guarded the iron birds because rules demanded it, not because she loved them, and that knowledge salted her dreams with joyful sorrow. <words>140</words>
One dusk, a gear-feathered albatross malfunctioned, opening a hole in the sanctuary wall large enough to taste the universe beyond. <words>160</words>
Through the breach drifted the newest postcard, still wet with mist that smelled like citrus and thunder. <words>177</words>
Its message was not ink but motion: an illustrated arrow that curved away from a chain, inviting her to follow and break free. <words>200</words>
Sela realized the postcards were plans, diagrams of liberation disguised as holiday greetings, and the island was no place but a possibility. <words>222</words>
To reach it, she must ride the sanctuary itself, letting the mechanical flock stitch a corridor through the folds of spacetime. <words>243</words>
She fed the gears sweet oil, released the cages, and the birds erupted, carrying walls, rafters, and finally her, like a cathedral learning to migrate. <words>268</words>
Citizens below pointed and cheered, mistaking the rebellion for a parade, their dangerously friendly smiles proving how thoroughly society had declawed real wonder. <words>291</words>
Higher, the flock rearranged into the arrow's shape, matching the postcard's illustration, and the corridor of light yawned open like a door painted on air. <words>316</words>
Inside the corridor, time loosened; she saw her younger self laughing at warm bread, her older self gifting loaves to strangers, and understood her motivation was always to rediscover lost joy. <words>347</words>
Sela lifted the rustic bread paddle she had smuggled from the workshop and held it aloft like a scepter, declaring herself guide rather than guardian. <words>372</words>
The chrome birds adjusted course, heading toward a horizon woven from postcard hues, and she felt society's grip crumble behind her like stale crusts swept from a table. <words>400</words>
Joyful sorrow washed over her, for she mourned what was lost even as she gleefully carved a new world with every wingbeat. <words>422</words>
And somewhere in spacetime's perfumed folds, an unseen island prepared fresh dough, certain that its estranged guardian was at last on her way home. <words>446</words>
