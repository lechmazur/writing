Amid bird songs that somehow echoed through waterlogged corridors, a lucid frenzy gripped the last garden of the forgotten underwater city.<words>21</words>
In the glimmering kelp arches walked Koji, a graceful swordsman whose every step parted silt like a quiet poem.<words>40</words>
He had descended from the surface to escape a world where individuality is suppressed, carrying only memory and restless hope.<words>60</words>
The garden’s crystal lilies glowed fluorescent blue, nourished by ancient sunlamps that misfired like stuttering lighthouses, yet birdsong recordings looped overhead, mocking their absence.<words>84</words>
At the plaza’s drowned observatory, an astronomy telescope lay corroded, its brass ribs bent like a broken crown.<words>102</words>
Koji’s thoughts were mindfully scattered, not lost, each drifting fragment tethered to purpose as seaweed anchors shattered statues.<words>120</words>
He chose to innovate by scavenging for cosmic signals in broken TVs discarded by tourists long washed away.<words>138</words>
With circuit shards and the telescope’s cracked lens, he assembled a hybrid device that drank static and exhaled star-maps.<words>157</words>
When powered by bioluminescent eels, the contraption projected swirling constellations across stone walls like migrating spirits.<words>173</words>
Within the patterns, Koji deciphered coordinates to hidden vents promising ascent beyond the press of generic minds above.<words>191</words>
Yet unforeseen consequences unfurled as the telescope scraped deeper spectra: the garden’s soil trembled and coral statues opened their eyes.<words>211</words>
These animate relics mistook the star-maps for omens and began uprooting lilies, steering luminous petals toward Koji like pleading hands.<words>231</words>
Bird songs quickened to frantic tempo, their synthetic chirps ricocheting through domes, weaving panic into the water itself.<words>249</words>
Surrounded, the graceful swordsman unsheathed his bladewhip, its ribbon steel dancing through currents, slicing falling columns while harming nothing living.<words>269</words>
Still, every parry magnified the device’s broadcast, and Koji understood the paradox he had birthed.<words>284</words>
To protect the garden and preserve his path, he severed the power eel, darkening constellations as statues froze mid-gesture.<words>303</words>
The silence that followed was cavernous, but a single column shifted aside, revealing the vent corridor the signals had named.<words>323</words>
Koji bowed to the immobilized garden, then swam upward through the throat of the city, guided by fading bird songs that now sounded like real sky.<words>349</words>
He emerged beneath dawn, the weight of suppressed souls washing from his lungs as the ocean exhaled novae of pink light.<words>370</words>
Though alone, he finally felt undeniably specific, an asterisk against the bland manuscript of empire.<words>385</words>
Behind him, the broken TVs drifted from the vent like jellyfish lanterns, still catching fragments of cosmic chatter to remind him of debt unpaid.<words>409</words>
He vowed to return when the empire’s hush grew loud again, bringing full dawn to those statues and the lilies they once guarded.<words>432</words>
Until that hour, each breath would carry the taste of unforeseen consequences, a flavor equal parts terror, salt, and sparkling possibility.<words>453</words>
Koji tightened his grip on the bladewhip and walked toward sunrise, innovating futures with every deliberate, mindfully scattered footprint on the shifting shore.<words>476</words>
Far below, the forgotten underwater city garden settled into hush, as though grateful for reclaimed selfhood.<words>492</words>
