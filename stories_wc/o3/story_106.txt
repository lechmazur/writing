<story>
Garrick, a sullen farmer from the drought‑stricken uplands, descended in a rusted bathysphere seeking impossible relief. <words>16</words>
Below the waves glimmered the forgotten underwater city power station, its glass turbines spinning lazy halos of algae‑flecked light. <words>35</words>
He carried only two things: a collection of used postage stamps and his father's patchwork quilt. <words>51</words>
The stamps, limp and salt‑speckled, recorded every harvest tax he had ever mailed yet never escaped. <words>67</words>
The quilt was worse, stitched through mismatched patches on a passed‑down quilt whose stories threatened to unravel. <words>84</words>
Yet Garrick believed both heirlooms mapped hidden exits, if only he read them with sufficient zest. <words>100</words>
His motivation was simple, almost holy: to walk away from a dead end blazing behind him. <words>116</words>
The drought, the debts, the pitying looks of objectively biased neighbors had fossilized his fields into tombstones. <words>133</words>
Borrowed valor fueled each step as he waded through the shattered atrium, pretending courage belonged naturally to him. <words>151</words>
A sudden hiss of escaping air announced a breach, and seawater lapped the control consoles like curious dogs. <words>169</words>
During a moment of pure inspiration, Garrick spread the quilt across the humming reactor floor. <words>184</words>
Each patch glowed faintly as brine met thread, revealing cartographic ridges that looked suspiciously like city limits. <words>201</words>
Erasing boundaries, the pattern shifted, roads dissolving while rivers connected until a single arrow pointed toward an auxiliary shaft. <words>220</words>
Garrick pressed the soggy stamps onto the arrow, and electricity arced through their faded monarchs and canceled inks. <words>238</words>
Instantly the shaft door creaked open, spewing bubbles that whispered promises of surface rain and unclaimed horizon. <words>255</words>
But the control room lights flared red, accusing him of theft from a civilization that already drowned. <words>272</words>
Garrick hesitated, weighed by generational guilt stitched into every thread he carried. <words>284</words>
Then he remembered the skewed judgments of objectively biased juries back home, and the hesitation burned away. <words>301</words>
With borrowed valor renewed, he seized the quilt corners and wore them as a cape of dripping lineage. <words>319</words>
Zest coursed through him like fresh irrigation as he stepped into the shaft, stamps fluttering against his chest. <words>337</words>
The mechanism lifted, scraping barnacles, and the quilt’s shifting map redrew itself, aligning corridor lights into beckoning constellations. <words>355</words>
He understood the design now: each stamp a passport, each patch a border rubbed thin, guiding him skyward. <words>373</words>
Erasing boundaries was never about lines on land but about refusing the limits grief draws inside the chest. <words>391</words>
Around him the power station groaned, surrendering to tides, while he ascended surrounded by hiss, hope, and imploding dark. <words>410</words>
He surfaced at dawn, quilt steaming in sunlight, stamps dissolved into salt, yet his pockets brimmed with untarnished horizon. <words>429</words>
