I arrived at the abandoned carnival shooting gallery just after dusk, guided by the hush of the tide and the promises of the drowned. <words>24</words>
That night the breeze smelt of brine and burnt sugar, a joyfully melancholic perfume that stitched past and present together. <words>44</words>
I, Mara Velez, wreck‑diver and reluctant ghost whisperer, had come to arouse voices even silence pretended not to hear. <words>63</words>
They said my ancestor shot the star targets here a century ago, beginning our family tradition of attending the carnival's closing night together. <words>86</words>
Each generation returned, even after rust replaced laughter, because the emptied booths echoed better than any chapel. <words>103</words>
Yet I attended alone, longing to step out of the shadow my lineage cast across the sea floor and the sky alike. <words>125</words>
From my diving pouch I withdrew the piece of amber with an insect inside, warm as a small captured sun. <words>145</words>
The fossilized fly had followed me from the shipwreck of the Ambrosia, glowing whenever unquiet spirits drifted near. <words>163</words>
Tonight its radiance pulsed between the lines of a half‑written letter I carried, words my mother never finished addressing to me. <words>184</words>
Ink blots formed constellations of regret, but I traced them like navigation marks toward the thawing heart I believed was buried here. <words>206</words>
Ghosts stirred when I loaded a dented rifle with air and memory, aiming at paper ducks that no longer moved. <words>226</words>
The first shot collapsed a dangling bulb, releasing a pop whose echo called shipwrecked souls up through the carnival's warped floorboards. <words>247</words>
They surrounded me, translucent sailors, carnival workers, even a child clutching an invisible cotton candy swirl, their murmurs as salt‑soft as lullabies. <words>269</words>
I held up the amber and their whispers funneled into it, arousing the imprisoned fly, whose wings flickered like clock springs restarting. <words>291</words>
In that tremor I heard my mother's unfinished sentence: 'Live, Mara, beyond the depths I chose,' and my own blood answered. <words>312</words>
The gallery lights flared, frost on the metal targets liquefied, and a faint warmth dripped down their painted smiles, the carnival's heart thawing. <words>335</words>
For one breath the place glimmered as it had before storms and gossip sank it, a fleeting rebellion against decay that felt earned. <words>358</words>
I released the amber into the ticket chute, gifting the spirits an exit, and the gallery settled like a tide withdrawing, sated. <words>380</words>
Outside, dawn freckled the horizon, and I folded the half‑written letter into my dive log, its blanks finally filled by echo and gunpowder. <words>403</words>
My footsteps left the midway without looking back, no longer haunted but humming, because stepping away was also a way of standing taller. <words>426</words>
