Between games of a forgotten ritual sport, I raced along the misted lanes of Craigh na Dath, the ancient Celtic village reimagined in chrome and ivy.<words>26</words>
Jubilant despair crackled in the air like sparks from torched heather, for the scoreboard of life glittered while our spirits smoldered.<words>47</words>
I, a frazzled courier branded strongly weak by gossiping bards, had volunteered to map the strands of courage lacing the settlement.<words>68</words>
Council elders insisted that tracking social changes could only be done by tracking urban legends, because statistics made their beards itch.<words>89</words>
So I carried a battered parchment, a vintage ink pot, and a quill tinged with neon goose feathers.<words>107</words>
Each legend I uncovered, I recorded, the ink swirling like storm clouds desperate to levitate from the page.<words>125</words>
The first tale spoke of children who whistled open the barrow mounds and swapped teeth for prophecies.<words>142</words>
I found the whistlers between rounds of hurling, their pockets jangling with molars and hope.<words>157</words>
They confessed the trade had begun after village wages were converted to riddles rather than coins.<words>173</words>
I penned that shift, noting a raise in clever smiles but a drop in chewing.<words>188</words>
The ink pot vibrated, absorbing their courage like black lightning, and I felt my own spine uncurl.<words>205</words>
Yet the pot was always half empty, mirroring my strongly weak resolve.<words>217</words>
The second legend claimed that widowed stones sang hymns whenever new lovers argued beside the well.<words>233</words>
Investigating, I caught granite notes trembling between games of knucklebones, harmonizing with cutting remarks about chores and destiny.<words>251</words>
I wrote the observation, and the ink pot glowed, its darkness suddenly lighter than my heartbeat.<words>267</words>
The strands of courage twined tighter, visible now as silver filaments looping over rooftops like festive garlands of risk.<words>286</words>
Elders demanded results, so I presented the levitating ink pot, swirling with communal bravery and personal exhaustion.<words>303</words>
They scoffed, declaring legends unfit for policy, but the pot burst, scattering midnight droplets that clung to every beard.<words>322</words>
Instantly each elder saw the recorded shifts, felt children's daring toothlessness and lovers' melodic quarrels reverberate inside their sternums.<words>341</words>
Their knees buckled, but their eyes widened, for jubilant despair demanded both collapse and celebration.<words>356</words>
They authorized a festival of revision, rewriting village laws with fresh ink distilled from those released droplets.<words>373</words>
Between games, I watched rooftops shimmer as the strands of courage knitted safety nets for risks yet to come.<words>392</words>
I remained strongly weak, exhausted but hovering on hope, buoyed by legends now proven truer than any ledger.<words>410</words>
My final entry stated simply: we rise when our stories do, and the ink has finally learned to fly.<words>429</words>
