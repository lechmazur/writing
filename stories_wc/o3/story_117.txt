At the last soft whisper of winter's bite, Jariel arrived at Marrowgate Manor. <words>13</words>
He was a relaxed pathfinder, wisely foolish enough to tread where cartographers feared scribbling. <words>27</words>
His ribs rattled with earnest absurdity, like windchimes hung inside an encyclopedia. <words>39</words>
The caretaker, a translucent grouch, pointed downstairs and growled about noises rearranging the furniture. <words>53</words>
Jariel tipped an imaginary hat and slipped into the haunted mansion cellar. <words>65</words>
The staircase breathed, boards exhaling gusts of dust that sounded suspiciously like giggles. <words>78</words>
On the earthen floor twinkled a trail of musical notes, luminous as escaping fireflies. <words>92</words>
Each note hovered, humming one pitch of a sentence no throat could pronounce. <words>105</words>
He followed, trusting music more than maps because melodies rarely lied about direction. <words>118</words>
Midway, he used his cracked magnifying lens to inspect a particularly tremulous quarter rest. <words>132</words>
The glass fracture refracted the glyph into five overlapping silhouettes, like mosaic realities negotiating alignment. <words>147</words>
Jariel chuckled, realizing every world demanded its own peculiar punctuation. <words>157</words>
He pocketed the thought for later, alongside string, raisins, and improbable optimism. <words>169</words>
The trail ended at a wooden door scribbled with claw marks and half notes. <words>183</words>
When he pushed, the cellar wall pivoted, revealing a circular chamber of discordant echoes. <words>197</words>
In its center floated a harp missing strings, yet radiating the perfume of silent thunder. <words>212</words>
Music, apparently, could naturalize even ghosts, if one listened with sufficiently untethered sincerity. <words>225</words>
Jariel inhaled, exhaled, and spoke the rhythm he imagined the harp longed to hear. <words>239</words>
Words dissolved; only vowel-shaped gusts wafted from his mouth, glowing teal beneath cobweb chandeliers. <words>253</words>
The harp vibrated, releasing the hidden melody the notes had promised. <words>264</words>
Walls turned transparent, displaying overlapping scenes: deserts raining fish, libraries orbiting moons, seas computing dreams. <words>279</words>
Jariel understood these mosaic realities were facets of himself, scattered through politely illogical possibilities. <words>293</words>
The cracked magnifying lens warmed, fusing, as if wholeness respected epiphanies. <words>304</words>
He recognized the power of self-expression lay in accepting that every fracture could project light. <words>319</words>
Laughing softly, he plucked the invisible strings, weaving echoes that painted the cellar with dawn. <words>334</words>
Spectral furniture bowed, now naturalized citizens of a kingdom conducted by shameless creativity. <words>347</words>
He ascended the stairs, the harp's melody folding behind him like a pocket universe. <words>361</words>
Outside, winter's last sigh kissed his cheeks, yet he carried spring in his throat. <words>375</words>
The caretaker blinked, finding the cellar suddenly drafted with lilac-scented sunlight. <words>386</words>
Jariel offered him the mended lens, saying, 'Try seeing complaints through miracles instead'. <words>399</words>
The ghostly grouch smiled, the mansion exhaling gratitude in three-part harmony. <words>410</words>
