Between elevator shafts and echoing corridors, I fix pulleys for a living but converse with the dead for survival.<words>19</words>
My colleagues call me elegantly clumsy because my tools twirl like ballet dancers before tightening a bolt.<words>36</words>
They never notice the ghosts guiding my wrists.<words>44</words>
Still, I was restless, hearing the dissonance of silence vibrate louder than any snapped cable.<words>59</words>
The quieter a spirit grew, the harsher its unheard resentment cracked inside my skull.<words>73</words>
So, amid lunch breaks, I began staking out local ghost tours, clipboard hidden behind a thermos of soup.<words>91</words>
Pretending to time elevators for tourists, I mapped where the murmurs thickened.<words>103</words>
Every route converged on the municipal sand castle preservation lab beside the windy shoreline museum.<words>118</words>
Inside, scientists spritzed miniature fortresses with desalinated mist, while granules glittered like fragile kingdoms.<words>132</words>
The place felt paradoxically arid, each hiss of vapor sealing a louder hush.<words>145</words>
That hush matched the voiceless screaming bruising my ears, and I knew a stubborn ghost nested there.<words>162</words>
To lure it, I carried my grandmother's dried flower crown, the only relic that ever soothed unfinished lullabies.<words>180</words>
Petals cracked softly like old bones, promising release.<words>188</words>
During the next break, I pretended to examine the freight lift while arranging the brittle circlet atop a model turret.<words>208</words>
The air rippled, and a pale boy in Victorian overalls drifted forward, his silence so jagged it rang.<words>226</words>
He pointed to the turret, mouthing nothing, begging everything.<words>235</words>
I understood he had built sand kingdoms no one preserved, and he could not forgive time for the tide.<words>254</words>
My hands, elegantly clumsy, unscrewed the turret's glass case with the grace of tripping feathers.<words>269</words>
Then I began to dissect the castle, grain by grain, scattering its guarded ramparts onto the linoleum floor like hourglass snow.<words>290</words>
Each collapse sounded wordless, yet the room grew deafening with relieved sighs.<words>302</words>
The boy's outline thinned as if the very notion of form was an unnecessary apology.<words>317</words>
He saluted with dusty fingers, touched the flower crown, and dissolved into a murmurless breeze that carried salt away.<words>336</words>
The dissonance of silence mellowed into true quiet.<words>344</words>
I swept the scattered sand and petals together, letting them cascade through my palms until no shape remained.<words>362</words>
Liberation, I learned, is not in preserving castles but in allowing oceans to imagine new ones.<words>378</words>
When the lunch whistle blew, supervisors entered, puzzled by the open case yet relieved the ambient pressure had vanished.<words>397</words>
I only shrugged, pocketed my tools, and rode the elevator down, alone yet accompanied by a serene absence.<words>415</words>
The car hummed, but inside me bloomed an unmistakable, uncomplicated peace.<words>426</words>
Complex simplicity at last rang truer than any ghostly chord.<words>436</words>
