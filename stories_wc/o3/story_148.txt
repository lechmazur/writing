Wind maps sprawled across my trailer table could not silence the mountains calling me. <words>14</words>
I, Rahim the desert storm chaser, packed layers instead of dust masks for once. <words>28</words>
A letter from Brother Adelmo in the alpine monastery promised thunder of a different kind. <words>43</words>
He wrote of a forgotten carousel on their snowy terrace, its music box lungs wheezing frost. <words>59</words>
If repaired, the whirling horses would draw villagers back and keep the cloister funded. <words>73</words>
I wanted storms, yet the plea cracked open a calmer hunger. <words>84</words>
So I drove north, towing my battered toolkit and a pair of blacksmith’s tongs inherited from my mother. <words>102</words>
She once forged lightning rods; I hoped her ghost would coach my unpracticed hands. <words>116</words>
Brother Adelmo ushered me inside during a lull between tasks, incense battling pine scented air. <words>131</words>
Monks chanted, their voices like distant weather I was still learning to read. <words>144</words>
The carousel leaned in a courtyard, paint peeled as if a sandstorm had traveled uphill. <words>159</words>
Its brass poles were cold lightning, daring me to kindle them. <words>170</words>
Yet every bolt I tightened seemed to exacerbate hidden fractures in the gears. <words>183</words>
Eagerly unwilling, I kept working, driven forward by doubt more than confidence. <words>195</words>
Brother Adelmo noticed my stalling wrestle and produced an ancient tapestry kept in the library. <words>210</words>
He believed its border encoded the original wiring sequence of the carousel’s melody cylinder. <words>224</words>
Frayed threads formed swirling isobars and galloping horses, almost meteorological in their precision. <words>237</words>
My storm maps trained my eyes; I began decoding the pattern during the silent hours. <words>252</words>
Thread by thread, the tapestry whispered where copper wires should cross and where springs must rest. <words>268</words>
Between tightening screws, I returned to the border, confirming each revelation with the tongs’ cold pinch. <words>284</words>
Inner strength, I learned, is a storm contained, released only through deliberate channels. <words>297</words>
The monks prayed for fair weather; I prayed for clean contact points. <words>309</words>
Snow fell, insulating the courtyard while our workshop glowed like an ember in white ash. <words>324</words>
At dawn on the solstice, we cranked the flywheel, and hesitant notes lifted into the alpine hush. <words>341</words>
Gears clicked true, horses reared, mirrors caught newborn light, and bells summoned children from snug chalets. <words>357</words>
Wind tousled their scarves like desert dust devils translated into snowbound dialect. <words>369</words>
Brother Adelmo thanked me, but I thanked the tapestry, my mother’s tongs, and the storm inside. <words>385</words>
On the drive home, clouds brewed above the dunes, yet I felt only carousel music humming in my ribs. <words>404</words>
