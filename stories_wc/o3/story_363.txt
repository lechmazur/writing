The hush settled over Gannet Square as the last parade float disappeared beyond the gaslamp corner. <words>16</words>
Inside an unmarked door beneath the cobblestones, a secret society meeting hall inhaled the sudden quiet. <words>32</words>
Niles Verhoeven, a coal‑streaked miner who still smelled of funeral lily, stood uncertain at the threshold. <words>48</words>
Grief weighed his posture, yet an ember of duty kept his boots from turning back toward daylight. <words>65</words>
He had come, passionately indifferent to personal salvation, to chronicle technological shifts for generations he would never meet. <words>83</words>
The Archivists awaited him, faces hidden behind lenses ground from obsolete telegraph glass, reflecting curious glints like wary fireflies. <words>102</words>
They beckoned without speech, and he followed, guided by the careful observations that had always mapped his tunnels. <words>120</words>
At the chamber’s center lay a tiny bell, silent, pinned beneath a crystal cloche like captured lightning. <words>137</words>
Each member claimed this relic once chimed whenever mankind rewrote its engines, but modern noise had stolen its voice. <words>156</words>
Their hope was that Niles could coax memory from metal the way miners tease diamonds from indifferent seams. <words>174</words>
He knelt, brushing soot across the bell’s dormant mouth, and nightmarish after‑images flickered behind his eyelids: collapsing shafts, shrieking winches. <words>194</words>
These persistent nightmares, once curses, now served as crude lantern slides, illuminating what progress extracts and what it buries. <words>213</words>
Through their ghostly sequence he glimpsed steam loosening bolts, wires replacing muscle, algorithms plotting seams no pick could feel. <words>232</words>
Every flicker etched a tone he alone could hear, a resonant absence where the bell once rang. <words>249</words>
He realized the bell now chimed inside nightmares, audible only in silence thick enough to taste. <words>265</words>
With miners’ resolve he leaned forward and whispered the names of tools rendered extinct since last year’s parade. <words>283</words>
Pickaxes, hammer‑drills, carbide lamps—each syllable fluttered like coal dust, settling on the bell’s cold lip. <words>298</words>
A tremor answered, not sound but the hint of it, the paused inhale before a newborn screams. <words>315</words>
Lens‑masked Archivists recorded the quiver in ledgers of living paper whose ink rearranged with every technological birth. <words>332</words>
They regarded Niles with passionately indifferent gratitude, tempered by poignant levity, as though emotion were a valve best left half‑open to breathe. <words>354</words>
Yet he smiled, tasting bittersweet victory; his wife’s echo, lost in the last collapse, felt near inside the hush. <words>373</words>
He knew the bell would remain outwardly mute, but every future dream would toll with data only the dead decode. <words>393</words>
That was enough; technology marches, but memory follows disguised as phantoms, and someone must take attendance. <words>409</words>
He rose, pocketed the silent bell, and stepped outside just as distant drums resumed, promising another parade someday. <words>427</words>
