Midway through the night, when the orchard dog finally stops barking at last, I break into the city's deserted dinosaur skeleton museum.<words>22</words>
The smell of old plaster greets me with brusque affection, like an aunt who slaps your cheek before kissing it.<words>42</words>
I am Rintaro, a gentle swordsman and confessed xenophile, enamored of every culture the cosmos might hide from provincial eyes.<words>62</words>
Tonight's heist is not about bones but about possibility, about late bloomers who refuse extinction.<words>77</words>
I seek the half-painted sundial rumored to hang behind the Tyrannosaurus ribcage, its coded angles whispering star-maps older than language.<words>97</words>
With those angles, I hope to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, guiding restless worlds toward gentler orbits.<words>116</words>
Yet prophecy requires tinder, and my pocket holds only an empty matchbox, rattling like a cracked maraca.<words>133</words>
Its last flame lit my vow to be faithfully unfaithful: loyal to wonder, disloyal to every chain that wonder outgrows.<words>153</words>
Security patrols stagger through shadowed dioramas, murmuring about budget cuts and phantom roars, but they know nothing of sundials or orchids.<words>174</words>
I climb the steel scaffolding, my scabbard tapping ribs that once sheltered thunderous hearts.<words>188</words>
The sundial waits, half gold, half primer-gray, a moon caught mid-eclipse.<words>199</words>
I rotate the gnomon twenty-seven degrees southwest, then forty-one northeast, the museum lights flickering as angles translate into coordinates.<words>218</words>
Somewhere overhead, constellations rearrange like courteous pickpockets, and the air tastes briefly of persimmons.<words>232</words>
But the mechanism jams, demanding fire I cannot provide.<words>241</words>
I shake the empty matchbox, feeling foolish until I remember the orchard dog's hush signaled not silence but a transfer of guardianship.<words>263</words>
Outside, that dog once barked at meteors; tonight it trusted me to bark for it.<words>278</words>
So I bark, loud and ridiculous amid the fossils, percussion for galaxies unborn, and the jammed sundial shudders open.<words>297</words>
Light pours out, not white but the color of letters that haven't been invented, wrapping the T. rex bones in shimmering verbs.<words>319</words>
Every socketed tooth becomes a lighthouse whose beam loops across the planet, awakening other late bloomers who believed dawn forgotten.<words>339</words>
I feel the universe tilt, nestling into my imaginary palm, lighter than the match that once was.<words>356</words>
Brusquely, I tell it not to get cocky, then stroke empty space with practiced affection.<words>371</words>
A hologrammatic scroll unfurls, chronicling my faithful betrayals, my unfaithful fidelities, and concludes with a single directive: keep blooming.<words>390</words>
The museum alarms finally wail, tardy chaperones to a dance already spun, and I sheathe my sword, smiling like a man outgrown by destiny.<words>414</words>
Outside, persimmon dawn peels the night away, and the orchard dog sleeps, confident that the bones are busy blooming.<words>433</words>
