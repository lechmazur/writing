Our host council funded nightly concerts of cascading water and organ recitals, believing harmony would draw minds open again.<words>61</words>
Yet their archives remained sealed, knowledge lost since empire fall, and fear thickened every echo under the vaulted lamps.<words>80</words>
I was sent to rescue that wisdom before history calcified, but my mission carried a righteously flawed arrogance inherited from distant stars.<words>102</words>

I compared its etched spiral against every cataloged design, yet nothing matched except an unrecorded symbol in celestial memory.<words>141</words>
The organist began rehearsing; loneliness rolled through brass pipes, setting the baths trembling with resonant subcurrents older than language.<words>160</words>
