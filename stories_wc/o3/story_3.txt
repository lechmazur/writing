Salted mist rolled across the sailor's graveyard, blurring weathered masts that jutted from the sand like cracked ribs.<words>18</words>
Garrick, the surly watchman assigned to guard the deserted inlet, patrolled with a lantern whose flame danced in dignified chaos.<words>38</words>
He served no living sailors; instead he kept watch over rumors, restless gulls, and the tides of half‑remembered stories.<words>57</words>
On this night, balanced precariously between seasons, a serenely frantic wind snatched at his coat and carried whispers from the breakers.<words>78</words>
One whisper coiled into a question, a riddle speaking through the surf: 'What thread binds the markets of stars to the bones of drowned men?'<words>103</words>
Garrick thought of the short piece of yarn knotted around his wrist, a keepsake given by Old Mother Veera, the retired sailmaker.<words>125</words>
She had taught him a traditional craft learned from an elder still older than she: reading twists of fiber the way seers read smoke.<words>149</words>
Each crimp, she claimed, recorded market wisdom traded by fishermen, merchants, even comets bartering light along unseen currents.<words>167</words>
If one listened, the yarn would reveal when goods, tides, or destinies should rise or fall, all patterned after richer, cosmic ledgers.<words>189</words>
Tonight, the yarn prickled, its knots tightening like muscles; Garrick realized the graveyard itself waited for his answer.<words>207</words>
He knelt amid shattered figureheads and held the strand to the moonlight, letting wind and salt turn it as Veera had instructed.<words>229</words>
The motion was serenely frantic, looping with purpose yet quivering with urgency, and within the loops he traced constellations gone missing from the sky.<words>253</words>
They formed a chart of vacancies, showing where stars would soon arrive like fresh cargo at a celestial bazaar.<words>272</words>
Market wisdom, he now grasped, was never mere bargaining but the art of aligning emptiness with forthcoming abundance.<words>290</words>
Answering the riddle, he spoke into the roaring night: 'Expectation is the thread; supply and rest belong to different breaths of the same loom.'<words>314</words>
The waves hushed, and the graveyard lanterns—ghostly fireflies trapped in bottles—aligned in a spiral that mirrored the yarn’s last twist.<words>334</words>
In their glow, Garrick perceived currents sweeping far beyond this shore, sketching routes through nebulae and economies alike.<words>352</words>
The cosmos, serenely frantic, conducted auctions of gravity, while mortal markets merely echoed its dignified chaos in miniature.<words>370</words>
Understanding flashed through him like sunrise in a bottle, and his habitual surliness cracked, replaced by awe as steady as the tide.<words>392</words>
Garrick tied the yarn to a split mast, entrusting the pattern to salt and time, and resumed his watch with eyes turned inward toward drifting constellations.<words>418</words>
The graveyard accepted the offering, and somewhere between seasons a new star flickered to life, bright as a coin tossed into commerce.<words>440</words>
Its light washed the shore, promising that those who guarded silence might yet trade it for understanding of larger, kinder patterns.<words>461</words>
And Garrick finally knew he had kept the vigil only to understand cosmic patterns, the grand commerce pulsing beneath every wave.<words>482</words>
