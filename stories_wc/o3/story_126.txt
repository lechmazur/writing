The observation deck of Orbital Ark Seven hovered where forests used to breathe beneath forgotten clouds. <words>16</words>
Now, after the last tree falls, I linger there, a shipwrecked merchant with nothing left to sell. <words>33</words>
Cargo once bound for green worlds lies drifting in scrap orbits, mocking every invoice in my ledger. <words>50</words>
The deck’s panoramic glass whispers, honestly strange, amplifying solitude like an antique gramophone. <words>63</words>
Yet rebellious sparks keep crackling in the power rails, refusing to accept the museum hush. <words>78</words>
Those sparks mirror the flicker in my own marrow, the need to shatter the grand illusion. <words>94</words>
That illusion says the markets still function, that people still trade, that living trees might return on schedule. <words>112</words>
I know better, because I watched the last seedship burn like a candle stub. <words>126</words>
My only companion is a rustic butter churn I scavenged from the galley of my ruined freighter. <words>143</words>
Its oak staves creak when station gravity hiccups, sounding absurdly pastoral in this chrome necropolis. <words>158</words>
I keep plunging the dasher, churning phantom cream, forging rhythm out of vacuum’s hum. <words>172</words>
Each stroke summons memories of market squares, where contracts smelled of cinnamon and sap. <words>186</words>
But memory alone cannot ascend a dying species. <words>194</words>
For that, I need a ladder made of lies peeled away, rung by splintered rung. <words>209</words>
I find the first rung via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station downstairs. <words>227</words>
The poster once promised Edenic Arcadia, all-inclusive, three moons, no import duties. <words>239</words>
Now its corners curl like burnt petals, revealing maintenance shafts hidden behind the holographic ink. <words>254</words>
I press my palm to the curling laminate, and rebellious sparks race up my sleeve in welcome. <words>271</words>
Following the static’s guidance, I crawl into the shaft, butter churn slung like a knight’s shield. <words>287</words>
Gravity dwindles as I ascend ladder after ladder, my merchant’s coat shedding invoices like dying leaves. <words>303</words>
The shaft ends at a sealed service iris etched with corporate sigils that once wrote planetary laws. <words>320</words>
I jam the butter churn’s handle between the petals, leverage rural stubbornness against imperial design. <words>335</words>
Metal screams, blossoms, and the observation deck’s upper vault yawns into a secret greenhouse of plastic dusk. <words>352</words>
Rows of holographic trees shimmer here, projected for tourist nostalgia, their roots dangling like unplugged cables. <words>368</words>
I stride among them with aloof passion, raising the churn high as a prophet lifts a relic. <words>385</words>
Then I smash the projector core, and rebellious sparks burst outward, igniting cloth-crafted leaves into truthful darkness. <words>402</words>
Tourist birds cease chirping; the illusion shatters like cheap glassware tossed from a freighter’s mess table. <words>418</words>
Through broken panels I see stars unfiltered, hard and honest, exactly as honestly strange as they should be. <words>436</words>
I let the butter churn drift, its oak catching starlight, testament that commerce birthed rebellion at last. <words>453</words>
Somewhere below, alarms wail, but I just watch the sparks ascend into vacuum, sowing futures no ledger can price. <words>472</words>
