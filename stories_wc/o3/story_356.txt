The cargo hold of the space-pirate schooner Misericorde smelled of ionized rust and stolen oranges when the outdated phone's dial tone finally cut out in a mournful hiccup.<words>28</words>
That was the signal Sister Kel, the wry caretaker with the warmly aloof smile, had been waiting for.<words>46</words>
She stepped between towering crates of confiscated comets, lifted a single, chalk-white sliver from her apron pocket, and considered how small a piece of chalk could steer eternity.<words>74</words>
Time, she recalled, was less a river than a nervous tremor that obeyed whoever dared to scribble a confident line across its shaking skin.<words>98</words>
So she knelt on the oil-slick floor and sketched an arrow that pointed nowhere, because nowhere was exactly where the captain needed the stolen hours to vanish.<words>125</words>
Each stroke glowed pallid blue, feeding on phosphor dust shaken from the artificial gravity vents overhead.<words>141</words>
Outside the rust-eaten portholes, cloud paths unspooled across the vacuum like white string, and Sister Kel's eyes tracked them the way monks once traced constellations on chapel ceilings.<words>169</words>
By tracking cloud paths she could tell when a minute split into thirds, when yesterday elbowed tomorrow, and when a guilty heart pressed rewind hoping mercy still answered.<words>197</words>
The cargo hold hummed with gentle harshness, metallic yet oddly maternal, as if the Misericorde herself approved the surgery being performed on her chronometers.<words>221</words>
Kel's motivation was simple: hush the endless "what if" siren song that had haunted her since the raid on Caldera Nine, when she turned left and comrades burned right.<words>250</words>
Every speculative echo clanged through her skull like loose cutlery, and only mastering the nature of time could mute the percussion.<words>271</words>
She finished the glyph, blew chalk dust into the stale air, and listened as the dial tone's ghost shuddered, shrank, and succumbed to silence.<words>295</words>
The moment the silence sealed, the stolen hours slid like marbles down her diagram and pooled beneath the crates where they could trouble no future.<words>320</words>
Behind her, the captain's hologram flickered, expecting fireworks, but all he saw was a caretaker brushing her palms, warmly aloof, as if cleaning pews after a quiet mass.<words>348</words>
His greed itched for grander spectacle, yet he sensed that asking might unravel whatever fragile spool now moored his loot to reality.<words>370</words>
Sister Kel tucked the spent piece of chalk behind her ear, whispered a benediction no microphone could capture, and walked away before the captain realized even regret had vanished.<words>399</words>
Somewhere in the starry aft, a single crate ticked once, then settled, confirming that what-ifs could sleep when chronology was sung a lullaby.<words>422</words>
