Brannick the fidgety mage-smith paced the edge of the lavender field tucked behind the rusted factory ruins. <words>17</words>
The dusk had faded until only one star remained in the dimming sky, trembling like an unwinked eye. <words>35</words>
Fearful joy fluttered in his chest, a moth caught between desire and dread. <words>48</words>
In his soot-blackened hand clinked a collection of keys on a ring, each forged from different forgotten storms. <words>66</words>
Tonight he needed the right key to unlock a thing no door could hold: the seeds of regrowth. <words>84</words>
Those seeds, bright as embers in memory, would remake the crumbling world and hold chaos at bay. <words>101</words>
Yet their pattern of awakening was lost, scrawled years ago across abandoned chalkboard notes buried in the factory office. <words>120</words>
Brannick, musically untalented, hummed off-key incantations anyway, fingers twitching like sparrows over the ring as if plucking harp strings. <words>139</words>
Sound mattered less than rhythm of will, his mentors said, yet his discordant crooning always summoned errant lightning. <words>157</words>
Lightning was helpful when forging storm-keys, but disastrous near fragile lavender meant to soothe a breaking realm. <words>174</words>
He breathed the perfume, steadying nerves, and opened the mildewed office door the fields had swallowed like moss. <words>192</words>
Inside, moon-dust pooled on warped desks, and chalk ghosts lingered on a wall of equations and staves. <words>209</words>
The staves reminded him why he'd failed every conservatory test, but also why silence safeguarded his sorcery. <words>226</words>
He brushed dust aside, revealing a spiraling diagram marrying star positions, key shapes, and germination chants. <words>242</words>
At its center glowed a chalk circle labeled, in shaky sigils, 'Sing without sound when the heavens are lone'. <words>261</words>
Outside, the sky now held that single star, so he knelt, struck the brass key of Dawn against stone. <words>280</words>
Sparks blossomed, drifting over furrowed lavender rows, then sank into earth like meteors turning to seed. <words>296</words>
Silence followed, thick and terrifying, until shoots of silver-green burst from the burned soil, exhaling violet pollen. <words>313</words>
The pollen swirled into a luminous veil that sketched new constellations across factory walls, transmuting rust to living bark. <words>332</words>
Brannick gasped, half-laughing, half-weeping, as gears sprouted leaves and conveyor belts unfurled into rivers channeling gentle thunder. <words>349</words>
He clutched the ring, feeling keys grow warm, sensing the world begin its remake exactly as the chalk had promised. <words>369</words>
Yet he knew the verdant surge would freeze if his restless mind wavered, so he anchored thoughts to the star. <words>389</words>
Holding chaos at bay required unending vigilance, but for one heartbeat he allowed himself to taste victorious, fearful joy. <words>408</words>
Lavender perfume mixed with ozone, and he realized the star was not retreating; it was germinating, multiplying like blossoms in space. <words>429</words>
Soon skylights of new constellations would flare, guiding every survivor to these fields and the mage-smith's trembling welcome. <words>447</words>
He tucked the ring into his coat, pressed soil over the sprouting keys, and whispered, tone deaf yet triumphant, 'Grow'. <words>467</words>
At the command, thunder hummed in perfect silence, and the first orchards of steel-leafed trees began to sing for him. <words>487</words>
