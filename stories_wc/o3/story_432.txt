Mara Silex had trained her tongue to anticipate every toxin, because she hoped one day the last sip would kill her. <words>21</words>
Yet the House of Umbral Tasters kept her alive, hiring her to explore flavors nobody else dared to swallow. <words>40</words>
Their latest assignment carried her beneath the city, where a subterranean waterfall veiled chambers whispered about only in fevered legends. <words>60</words>
Those chambers, the archivist claimed, housed hidden societies that circulated poisons as currencies and dreams as taxes. <words>77</words>
Mara found the rumor strangely compelling, for mapping the whorls of their toxic commerce promised the purest confrontation with mortality. <words>97</words>
She meant to sketch those flows, then hand the chart to the river and follow it into oblivion. <words>115</words>
But entry required a key more esoteric than passwords or coin: the ice sculpture aboveground that crowned the festival of Silence. <words>136</words>
Legend promised the sculpture would shatter at midnight, and within its final second an aperture would open below the falls. <words>156</words>
To measure that instant, Mara consulted no clock but instead interpreted frantic calls to talk-radio psychics who felt time ripple. <words>176</words>
Their panicked horoscopes formed coordinates she could bind into a cadence, guiding her steps through steam and echo. <words>194</words>
On the night of descent, she tucked a simple cloth bookmark between the pages of her poison ledger to mark goodbye. <words>215</words>
The bookmark had once belonged to her sister, lost to an uncharted draught; its weight steadied Mara's quivering certainty. <words>234</words>
Icicles rang like bells above as she reached the cavern lip, mist curling around her in serene upheaval. <words>252</words>
Behind the watery curtain, bioluminescent glyphs pulsed, each one a vortex in the grand map of energy flows she sought. <words>272</words>
She dipped her quill, not in ink but in diluted nightshade, so that every line risked becoming her final testament. <words>292</words>
Voices from the radio, still crackling in her earpiece, crescendoed with warnings about a cold swan losing its wings. <words>311</words>
Mara realized the metaphor described the ice sculpture aboveground, whose brittle feathers were shedding under floodlights even now. <words>329</words>
She raced her pen, tracing currents between glyphs, binding waterfall spray, psychic static, and poison memory into one symmetrical mandala. <words>349</words>
As her last stroke dried, a thunderclap above signaled the sculpture’s cracking; she had entered the final second without blinking. <words>369</words>
The cavern door inhaled, releasing a gust perfumed with hemlock and moonstone, and the hidden societies stepped from tunnels like silhouettes made of question marks. <words>394</words>
Their leader offered Mara a chalice, promising both membership and oblivion, dependent on the taster’s verdict. <words>410</words>
She drank, tasting starlight, rust, and a faint reminder of her sister’s perfume, and judged it beautifully lethal. <words>428</words>
Mapping complete, death welcomed her like water over stone, while the bookmark fluttered down to mark the invisible page of history. <words>449</words>
Behind her falling body, the mandala glowed, a serene upheaval promising the societies a path through poison into promise. <words>468</words>
