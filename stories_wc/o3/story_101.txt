In the quiet room design studio perched on the rim of unmeasured time, I awaited the landlord. <words>17</words>
He arrived with a smile big enough to fit alternate histories, the very image of a welcoming landlord. <words>35</words>
His eyes flashed manic clarity, as though lightning had decided conversation was easier than thunder. <words>50</words>
Behind him, framed upon the wall, glimmered a Napoleonic bee pin encased like a sovereign insect fossil. <words>67</words>
He said the pin listened, so our sentences had to be cryptically obvious—hidden in plain cadence. <words>83</words>
I nodded, because adapting to eccentricities is easier than pulling nails from weathered hearts. <words>97</words>
We were here, he reminded me, to reimagine the endings we fear before they calcify. <words>112</words>
Such work demanded a traveler, and I had arrived only after a detour caused by a parade of vanished possibilities. <words>132</words>
The parade, I explained, marched backward through memory, beating drums sculpted from unborn diaries. <words>146</words>
Its route blocked the direct road, so I followed side paths where words grew on vines. <words>162</words>
I harvested verbs, hoping to adapt them into furniture for this studio of undocumentable dawns. <words>177</words>
Now we surveyed the empty floor, measuring how each syllable might support a chair of rewritten fate. <words>194</words>
The landlord placed the bee pin over blueprints, its gold wings vibrating like a semaphore for the unspoken. <words>212</words>
Whenever it shimmered, entire tragedies dissolved, beads of sorrow evaporating before ever touching the page. <words>227</words>
Yet each erasure left a hollow, and hollow after hollow could fracture even the most weathered hearts. <words>244</words>
So we drafted endings that bled gently, allowing grief to drip into gardens where future mouths would sip wisdom. <words>263</words>
The landlord’s manic clarity snapped like a banner in cosmic wind as he dictated colors beyond pigment. <words>280</words>
I felt the studio tilt, walls peeling into horizons, yet furniture of verbs held firm. <words>295</words>
The bee pin lifted, framing itself against nothingness, and spoke in a buzz both cryptically obvious and utterly ancient. <words>314</words>
It told us, before sound was archived, rhythm alone guided survival, so we must craft endings that hum. <words>332</words>
This all unfolded before the first being learns to record its experiences, and still the air tingled with suspense. <words>351</words>
We obeyed, sanding every sentence until it vibrated like the landlord’s welcoming grin meeting possibility. <words>366</words>
Outside chronology, seasons fluttered past the window, each leaf a potential farewell we chose to redesign. <words>382</words>
When at last the landlord clasped my hand, the studio folded into a quiet room inside my pulse. <words>400</words>
He whispered that nothing would be written, yet everything was saved, because memory begins where ink fails. <words>417</words>
With that paradox we parted, our weathered hearts lighter, already adapting to the unwritten tomorrow. <words>432</words>
