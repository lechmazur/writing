Wind rattled the broken stained glass as Rua, a streetwise orphan, crept into the lost orchard temple with fruit-laden vines.<words>20</words>
Legends said the harvest there ripened across an unwritten calendar, invisible dates whispered by unpruned branches.<words>36</words>
Rua sought not fruit but a cursed cameo brooch rumored to sing if no one listened.<words>52</words>
It was payment promised by a fence for bread, blankets, and perhaps the map to tomorrow.<words>68</words>
Confident uncertainty steadied Rua’s pulse; doubt existed, yet certainty in surviving had always walked beside it.<words>84</words>
Torch in hand, Rua passed frescoes whose pigments contrasted ripe crimson peaches against skeletal winters to emphasize inevitable contrast.<words>103</words>
On the altar lay the brooch, glinting gold yet cold as river stones previously warmed by sun.<words>120</words>
Rua’s fingers closed, and a distant echo fluttered through vaulted branches like a bird trying to remember flight.<words>138</words>
The sound seemed theoretically random, notes skipping scales, but every skip repeated itself through reversed patterns.<words>154</words>
Rua realized the temple’s music encoded a path; what looked chaotic was a mirrored map.<words>169</words>
Following the echo, Rua stepped between vines heavy with night-colored pears that wept silver sap.<words>184</words>
Each footprint reversed direction of the last, forcing backward pivots and sideward slides, yet progress emerged forward paradoxically.<words>202</words>
Behind her, stone roots curled where she had stood, sealing exits, urging commitment.<words>215</words>
Rua understood the motivation binding architecture: to harvest hope from darkness, one must first remove retreat.<words>231</words>
At corridor’s end a courtyard opened, moons dangled like lanterns above trellised apples glowing jade.<words>246</words>
There, statues of forgotten gardeners held contrasting scythes—one obsidian, one ivory—balanced so precisely they trembled.<words>261</words>
The brooch pulsed, drawing Rua to place it upon a heart-shaped niche carved between the scythes.<words>277</words>
When metal kissed stone, vines bowed, fruits burst, and juice became ink splashing swirling calendars onto bare walls.<words>295</words>
Dates arranged themselves out of chronological order, yet Rua perceived them as footsteps of possibility rather than time.<words>313</words>
She placed her palm on the freshest stain, feeling seasons swirl backward, until hunger remembered wheat still unplanted.<words>331</words>
A corridor ripened into a sunlit alley of the city Rua once begged within, but now carts overflowed.<words>349</words>
Children grabbed loaves without coin, and bakers smiled, because scarcity itself had been redirected into soil behind them.<words>367</words>
Rua sensed the orchard temple echoing still, sustaining this plenty as long as her own contrasts endured.<words>384</words>
Street years had sharpened her, but kindness now had edges too, and together they formed a theoretically random shield.<words>403</words>
She walked from the alley, confident uncertainty guiding each step, carrying no brooch yet wearing its myth as armor.<words>422</words>
Behind her, somewhere in neglected quarters, a distant echo waited to be discovered by the next lost listener.<words>440</words>
