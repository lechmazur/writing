I rose in the hush of a hidden sunrise, cursing the orchard that insisted I tend its haunted rows.<words>19</words>
The city-sized greenhouse dome of HyperLumen Station glimmered overhead, a futuristic hub pretending to be countryside.<words>35</words>
Corporate botanists called me caretaker, but the orchard called me prisoner.<words>46</words>
Every night its slick black apples whispered riddles that fermented into nightmares if I ignored them.<words>62</words>
Still, an analytically playful itch kept me cataloguing each absurd clue, hoping to unravel the orchard’s origin.<words>79</words>
Yesterday, the apples showed me a map bitten into their flesh, directing me to a cave hidden under the nutrient tanks.<words>100</words>
There, among bioluminescent dripstones, I found a fossilized dragon tooth as long as my forearm.<words>115</words>
I felt an involuntary grip tighten on my conscience, as if invisible talons measured me for replacement.<words>132</words>
The tooth hummed, broadcasting coordinates toward a cluster of rotting farmhouses abandoned when HyperLumen automated terrestrial food.<words>149</words>
The orchard insisted I follow, promising gleeful sorrow for anyone who listened.<words>161</words>
I armed myself with a scanner, a smile too thin, and the dragon tooth tucked into my satchel.<words>179</words>
When I reached the farmhouses, their walls sagged like mouths yawning secrets, paint peeling in time with a subterranean heartbeat.<words>199</words>
Doorways opened without touch, lights flickering on circuits officially disconnected decades ago.<words>211</words>
I unlocked the first secret by letting the dragon tooth rest against a cracked console; the machine purred as though recognizing kin.<words>233</words>
Holograms erupted, revealing archived confessions of engineers who spliced orchard genomes with mythic reptile fossils to grow edible oracles.<words>252</words>
Their recorded voices begged any caretaker to become the voice of the unknown, translating fruit murmurs into warnings for humanity.<words>272</words>
A second farmhouse unlocked itself, floors littered with cracked apple cores that still mouthed syllables about solar flares and winged storms.<words>293</words>
I listened, analytically playful despite quivering dread, stitching their metaphors into equations the station’s AI could parse.<words>310</words>
The orchard’s curse, I learned, was simply urgency: ignore its prophecies and the crops rot, heed them and perhaps people live.<words>331</words>
Gleeful sorrow flooded me, a paradoxical harvest; I was relieved to know purpose, mournful that it required endless sleepless decoding.<words>351</words>
I returned to the orchard under violet dawn, broadcasting my findings to HyperLumen while the apples rustled like applauding ghosts.<words>371</words>
The station’s directors demanded proof, so I sliced an apple, and the exposed seeds flickered holographic maps of incoming meteors.<words>391</words>
Silence followed, the kind that grips a room before history pivots, and I realized the unknown finally had its reluctant voice.<words>412</words>
Yet the orchard whispered one last request: keep speaking, or the dragon will wake and eat the sun.<words>430</words>
So, with gleeful sorrow twined around my tongue, I answered, and the sunrise kept hiding just a little longer.<words>449</words>
