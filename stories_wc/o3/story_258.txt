Salt-stung mist curled around the orchard afloat on a circle of driftwood in the open seas. <words>16</words>
At its creaking gate stood Yeru, a nimble locksmith whose fingers flicked like pickpockets through existence itself. <words>33</words>
People called Yeru physically metaphysical, a contradiction he wore the way other men wore hats. <words>48</words>
His latest commission, however, was not a lock but a legacy: to preserve indigenous dances before they dissolved into foam. <words>68</words>
That impossible request drew him here, where trees bore apples etched with lost footwork in bruised reds and golds. <words>87</words>
Legend promised the choreography would bloom fully when the final leaf drops from the ancient oak hidden at the orchard's core. <words>108</words>
Yeru carried only a torn map corner, its ragged edge pointing like a compass needle toward that secretive oak. <words>127</words>
Ink on the scrap seemed fresh though the parchment crackled like a veteran sailor, another whisper of the orchard's temporal tricks. <words>148</words>
A storm of secrets brewed on the horizon, clouds stacked like locked cabinets begging for his deft intrusion. <words>166</words>
To outpace the thunder, Yeru pranced along floating root-paths, each step unlocking new notes of rhythm beneath his soles. <words>185</words>
Yet he lacked the dances themselves, their sequences scattered like autumn leaves inside memories he did not own. <words>203</words>
So he searched via dusty yearbooks with questionable annotations, volumes lashed to branches by barnacle-threaded ropes. <words>219</words>
Marginalia scrawled by forgotten students suggested that each apple's bruise corresponded to an ankle twist, a hip pivot, a breath. <words>239</words>
But the yearbooks warned in smudged ink that locks can guard culture as fiercely as they guard gold. <words>257</words>
If opened poorly, a dance might shatter into commodity; if opened well, it might breathe anew inside living bodies. <words>276</words>
The locksmith, jaded yet enamored, felt responsibility tighten like a belt across his ribs. <words>290</words>
He reached the oak moments before the first raindrop struck, noticing a single, stubborn leaf trembling overhead. <words>307</words>
Wind howled through apple bellies, producing percussive basslines that begged for choreography. <words>319</words>
Yeru set the torn map corner against the oak's bark like a missing puzzle, and a keyhole of light formed. <words>339</words>
Trusting instinct, he inserted his picking tools of bone and memory, spinning stories rather than tumblers. <words>355</words>
The lock released a cascade of spectral dancers who circled him, mirroring steps chronicled in the bruised fruit. <words>373</words>
They guided his feet, teaching without words, until his body itself became the orchard's choreography manifest. <words>389</words>
With every mastered motion, a leaf loosened, and thunder scrawled applause across the sky. <words>403</words>
At last the final leaf dropped, gliding into Yeru's palm like a certificate signed by wind and water. <words>421</words>
The spectral troupe bowed, sinking into the churning tides yet leaving rhythms anchored inside Yeru's heart. <words>437</words>
Now custodian, he vowed to share the dances carefully, unlocking them only for communities that remembered their roots. <words>455</words>
Behind him, the orchard drifted onward, its mysteries relocked, awaiting the next storm of secrets on some distant sea. <words>474</words>
