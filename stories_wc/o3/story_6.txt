I first met Claryon, the skeptical minstrel, beside the shuttered gates of the disappearing ink factory. <words>16</words>
His lute was pawned, his eyebrows arched, and his purpose, he swore, was nothing less than divine fraud. <words>34</words>
An immortal trickster named Posthumous had filched every tune he ever wrote and claimed royalties forever. <words>50</words>
Claryon aimed to out-scheme that eternal thief with a plan stitched from reckless generosity. <words>64</words>
He believed giving everything away at once would bankrupt Posthumous's endless appetite for stolen abundance. <words>79</words>
The scheme sounded impossibly plausible, like a lie too honest to distrust. <words>91</words>
Still, he needed a stage outrageous enough to broadcast charity as catastrophe. <words>103</words>
So we slipped through a side door, guided via the hiss of an ancient steam vent in an abandoned factory compound. <words>124</words>
Inside, vats once filled with vanishing pigments loomed like dormant leviathans under skylights clogged with soot. <words>140</words>
On a conveyor belt I found a scrap of dragon‑scale armor, glittering with the stubbornness of bygone battles. <words>158</words>
Claryon pocketed it, muttering that even scaly refuse can sing if struck against enough emptiness. <words>173</words>
He drafted his proclamation in disappearing ink, promising every listener the entire remaining treasury of his heart. <words>190</words>
At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, he stuffed copies into the whole neighborhood’s slots. <words>207</words>
Letters written to vanish would, he chuckled, leave only the rumor of largesse, not the burden. <words>223</words>
But Posthumous could smell rumor the way sharks sense blood, so we prepared our slingshot. <words>238</words>
The ammunition was the armor scrap, loaded with a ribbon of fading ink like a comet’s tail. <words>255</words>
When Posthumous shimmered through a skylight, wearing stolen melodies as scarves, Claryon strummed an imaginary chord. <words>271</words>
The nonexistent sound rang with irreverent awe, its silence louder than church bells. <words>284</words>
Distracted, the trickster failed to notice me yank the valve that reawakened the steam vent’s dragon breath. <words>301</words>
The hiss punched upward, a geyser of scalding whisper, and our slingshot’s band snapped greedily. <words>316</words>
The dragon-scale shard rocketed, ricocheting off girders, carving sparks that spelled Claryon’s forgotten refrains in midair. <words>332</words>
Each spark donated a tune to the empty factory, leaving Posthumous to scramble after flaming copyrights. <words>348</words>
But the tunes flickered out just as he touched them, victims of the ink’s vanishing philosophy. <words>364</words>
Reckless generosity, weaponized, had gifted him nothing he could hoard. <words>374</words>
Enraged, Posthumous lunged, yet Claryon only bowed, handing over the slingshot like a resignation letter. <words>389</words>
It, too, was smeared in disappearing ink, its elastic soon to dissolve, its secret flight path already spent. <words>407</words>
Posthumous grasped the useless thing while Claryon sang aloud the one melody he had never written: pure silence. <words>425</words>
Silence proved an impossible treasure to steal, indefinitely replicating yet always untouchable, impossibly plausible to the last note. <words>443</words>
As Posthumous faded, bankrupt of echo, the skeptical minstrel finally believed his own chorus of doubt. <words>459</words>
He left the factory whistling nothing, gifting the world everything it could never misplace again. <words>474</words>
