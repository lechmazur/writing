The bus rumbled into the gorge, ferrying me beneath brittle cliffs toward an eerie salt mine turned subterranean village.<words>19</words>
I, a confused diplomat on accidental leave from treaties, clutched my briefcase like a passport to sanity.<words>36</words>
The assignment that never appeared on any docket was simple: decipher the counterpoint of hearts echoing below.<words>53</words>
Officials claimed the village choir sang codes older than bones, each note tracing evolutionary wisdom in harmonic fossils.<words>71</words>
Yet they feared to listen, so they sent me, whose talent was merely negotiating silences between louder nations.<words>89</words>
During bus rides I studied a spare computer key I kept from my last summit, the mute symbol 'Esc'.<words>108</words>
Its promise of exit felt both joyfully tragic, a comedy of escape rehearsed inside a prisoner's heartbeat.<words>125</words>
Could diplomacy be reimagined as an escapable keyboard, where nations merely tapped out their longing to restart?<words>142</words>
The bus braked, sulphur lights blinking like embered halos, and miners greeted passengers with lanterns carved from salt.<words>160</words>
They spoke timidly bold—a dialect that stepped forward while leaning back—and guided us into the cavernous township.<words>177</words>
Stalactites glittered like inverted cathedrals, and somewhere deeper a choir tuned throat and pickaxe alike.<words>192</words>
Before negotiations could happen, tradition required watching the surface sky reflected on mirrors hauled underground by donkeys.<words>209</words>
We gathered in a pit where mirrors angled upward through shafts, revealing migrating swallows scribbling algebra across dusk.<words>227</words>
The elder mayor whispered that their laws liberalize through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight.<words>245</words>
Each bend of wing revised a statute, each sudden swirl amended taxes, each long glide ratified neighborly peace.<words>263</words>
My diplomatic cables had never prepared me for legislation drafted in the open air yet archived underground.<words>280</words>
Trying to appear competent, I raised the spare key toward the mirror sky, pretending it could translate avian punctuation.<words>299</words>
A child laughed, and the flock tilted, spelling a question whose resonance vibrated my sternum: 'What imprisons you?'<words>317</words>
The choir began, weaving subterranean echoes with aerial equations, and I finally heard the counterpoint of hearts they guarded.<words>336</words>
Mine beat urgently, theirs hummed patient, and between the rhythms lay a treaty no pen could sign.<words>353</words>
To understand evolutionary wisdom, the mayor explained, one must feel the oldest organ arguing itself into harmony.<words>370</words>
I realized my confusion was only the embryo of clarity, a boldly timid state where curiosity still shook.<words>388</words>
Removing 'Esc' from my pocket, I offered it to the child, surrendering diplomacy's fetish of departure for presence.<words>406</words>
The key gleamed against salt crystals, and above, the swallows banked into the shape of a doorway opening inward.<words>425</words>
In that moment I was no longer envoy but citizen, liberalized by birds, mirrors, and a subterranean choir.<words>443</words>
Joyfully tragic, I boarded the return bus, carrying not reports but a heartbeat tuned to communal air.<words>460</words>
Every mile afterward, echoes from the mine pulsed through the engine, and my fellow passengers thought it music.<words>478</words>
I let them wonder, knowing some songs negotiate better than words ever will.<words>491</words>
