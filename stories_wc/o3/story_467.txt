Waves rolled like hesitant wings above the forgotten underwater city library where I hawked curiosities to wandering divers <words>18</words>
They called me a traveling vendor, but in truth I pursued rumors more than coin <words>33</words>
One rumor spoke of waterlogged letters penned in vanished inks that revealed entrances to older dreams <words>49</words>
To decode those letters became my heartbeat, my motive, my map <words>60</words>
Still, I remained cautiously adventurous, testing currents before plunging into corridors lined by barnacled shelves <words>75</words>
It was there I found the bent umbrella spoke, snagged between folios like a metal finger pointing onward <words>93</words>
Salt had warped it into the shape of a question mark, and questions are what I trade <words>110</words>
I tucked the spoke beside vials of luminescent ink and surfaced through kelp curtains <words>124</words>
Fate, wearing a muddy leash, awaited me in the world above <words>135</words>
A serendipitous meeting at a dog park introduced me to Mara, linguist of lost alphabets and devoted dachshund walker <words>154</words>
Her small hound barked, shaking droplets off, while her eyes measured the ocean’s hush on my clothes <words>171</words>
We spoke of rainless clouds, and I glorified the mysteries sleeping beneath tides until she laughed <words>187</words>
The bent spoke emerged, glittering like a crooked comet in my palm, leaving lasting impressions on her curiosity <words>205</words>
In that single heartbeat, agreement blossomed: she would help decode the letters, I would ferry her down <words>222</words>
Together we returned, diving past sun-flecked strata until the drowned library loomed like a cathedral of silence <words>239</words>
Mara’s dachshund waited topside with a sitter, yet her heartbeat echoed in my ears as constant percussion <words>256</words>
We found the letters imprisoned in coral drawers, parchment frayed but characters eerily bright <words>270</words>
They resembled footpaths spiraling outward, and Mara traced them, mouth forming whistles a dolphin might envy <words>286</words>
The umbrella spoke, damp yet eager, fit exactly into a gap between glyphs, completing the alphabet like a missing rib <words>306</words>
Letters unlocked, revealing directions not to treasure but to memories pressed within water—the city’s own diary <words>322</words>
Each passage described ordinary lives: a baker’s burnt loaf, a child’s seashell hoard, a librarian’s misplaced sneeze <words>339</words>
Their smallness felt like earthbound flight, grounded yet soaring inside us, reminding that impressions endure beyond erosion <words>356</words>
Mara’s eyes welled, and bubbles carried her silent joy upward like seeds seeking unexpected gardens <words>371</words>
I, vendor of curiosities, realized I had never truly sold anything; I had only delivered lasting impressions <words>388</words>
We left the letters unopened to profit, instead shelving them reverently so the drowned could still feel remembered <words>406</words>
As we ascended, the library lights dimmed, curtain falling on pages now breathing again in darkness <words>422</words>
One heartbeat earlier I had sought decipherment; one heartbeat later I understood preservation <words>435</words>
The bent umbrella spoke clinked softly in my satchel, punctuation to a story still rewriting itself with every wave <words>454</words>
Somewhere above, a dachshund barked approval, and the sea, glorified by memory, answered with a hush <words>470</words>
