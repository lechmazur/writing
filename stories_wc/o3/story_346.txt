I, Tarloc the Thunderblade, announced my excellence even to the echoing larvae as I entered the wasp citadel. <words>18</words>
Their papery walls vibrated, and balloon pops somewhere above synchronized like erratic drums puncturing the sickly honeyed air. <words>36</words>
My quest was simple in phrasing: escape this fabricated reality conjured by venomous dreams before its stitching calcified. <words>54</words>
Yet simplicity breeds labyrinths when a mind, however boastful, teeters on the edge of precise madness. <words>70</words>
An undercurrent of clarity guided me, whispering beneath the buzzing thunder like cool water under molten crust. <words>87</words>
I followed that subtle pull through tunnels lacquered with resinous spit until I found the Architect Wasp's chamber. <words>105</words>
There, hanging in luminescent drool, floated hundreds of colorful balloons, each pop spawning another corridor of illusion. <words>122</words>
To rewire the nest and therefore my own warped senses, I needed the Architect’s code, spoken only to itself. <words>141</words>
I crouched behind a ribbed pillar, listening by overhearing unguarded soliloquies the insect rehearsed while shaping fresh combs. <words>159</words>
Its monologue was intimately impersonal, calling larvae units, calling drones variables, calling me statistical noise unworthy of sting. <words>177</words>
Insult accepted, I memorized the algorithmic hymn hidden between insults, syllables clicking like mandibles on crystal circuits. <words>194</words>
Then I reached into my cloak for a weapon, but retrieved only a lint-filled pocket torn from earlier combat. <words>213</words>
Mockery would arrive if witnesses existed, yet even my ego chuckled, recognizing improvisation as the sharper blade today. <words>231</words>
I stuffed the charged lint into resinous conduits, humming the Architect’s hymn backward to persuade circuits of my ownership. <words>250</words>
Immediately, walls flickered, and balloons ceased forming; leftover spheres popped in a staccato finale above my helm. <words>267</words>
The citadel’s geometry unraveled, revealing black scaffolds where hexagons had pretended to be horizons. <words>281</words>
Through that collapsing aperture I saw the truer world, rain-soaked and raw, waiting like an unsharpened promise. <words>298</words>
But the Architect shrieked, diving with a spike-tipped abdomen, unwilling to lose its sole spectator and statistic. <words>315</words>
I met the charge head-on, boasting loud enough to rupture any lingering mirage, weaponizing my arrogance as sonic armor. <words>334</words>
Confused by echoing claims of its futility, the beast hesitated; my lint-wired conduits sparked and sealed the exit behind me. <words>354</words>
I leapt through the breach, each balloon pop fading, each hum of undercurrent aligning my thoughts into sober vectors. <words>373</words>
Outside, amid open night, I realized the clarity was never beneath my frenzy but within it, an intimately impersonal compass stitched from lint and lies. <words>398</words>
I sheathed that paradox beside my heart, vowing to boast only when the world required a crack to breathe. <words>417</words>
