Dust turned in hesitant spirals above the carousel of the abandoned spaceport baggage claim as my flying library settled on whispering thrusters. <words>22</words>
I, its pilot, kept a spiritually secular vigil, because stories deserve faith without dogma. <words>36</words>
Tonight I sought a detached coat button rumored to have fastened the last uniform of the First Archivist. <words>54</words>
Legend insisted the tiny disc could anchor every drifting narrative, the way the bridge to unity binds scattered minds. <words>73</words>
But the button hid among unclaimed luggage, and my time was measured in the second a simple yes or no can change everything. <words>96</words>
Somewhere beyond the cracked viewports, political fleets warmed their cannons, ready to obliterate any heritage that refused allegiance. <words>114</words>
I meant to preserve a fading tradition, not through rifles, but through syllables that survived when walls fell. <words>132</words>
Yet even librarians need augury, so I unfolded a travel mug, spilled its cold grounds, and read the future in coffee stains. <words>154</words>
Fractal sorrow arranged itself in those irregular rings, repeating heartbreak at every scale until a single pattern pointed toward Carousel Arm Twelve. <words>176</words>
I jogged beneath fluorescent ghosts, suit creaking like a chapter desperately reedited. <words>188</words>
There, between a cracked viola case and an oxygen umbrella, the button gleamed, a brass punctuation of forgotten resolve. <words>207</words>
As my fingers closed, a proximity alarm chimed, announcing incoming destroyers whose commanders dismissed art as obsolete ballast. <words>225</words>
My ship could flee, but without the bridge to unity secured, the library's orbit of cultures would decay into rival orphans. <words>246</words>
So I whispered the decisive question to myself—Yes or No—and felt the universe pause inside that razor second. <words>264</words>
Yes meant confrontation, no meant flight, but the stains had shown a third contour, a looping compromise only librarians discern. <words>284</words>
I fitted the button into the carousel's control socket, an interface designed for jackets but willing to accept symbols. <words>303</words>
Belts rumbled, suitcases spun, and the circular motion broadcast a homing pulse that translated conflict into curiosity across hostile cockpits. <words>323</words>
Pilots listening on open channels heard refugee sonnets and recipes instead of target locks, each lap sewing another stitch in the bridge to unity. <words>347</words>
Their admirals, confused but human, ordered stand‑by rather than fire, granting me the minutes needed to launch. <words>364</words>
I guided the flying library upward, its wings papered with undammed voices, while below the baggage claim kept turning like a contemplative planet. <words>387</words>
The button now glowed at the hub, modest as punctuation yet mighty enough to hold essays and empires together. <words>406</words>
From the cockpit I tasted the last flecks of coffee, bitter, prophetic, and knew that sorrow fractals could recede if readers kept circling. <words>429</words>
We set course for distant stations, carrying the carousel's new anthem, before the opposing fleets remembered war. <words>446</words>
Tradition, preserved in a coat button, now piloted us, and I merely steered its orbit toward dawn. <words>463</words>
