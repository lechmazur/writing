<story>
The domed vineyard on a barren alien plain shimmered like a cracked emerald under twin suns, its glass ribs sighing with fermented dreams. <words>23</words>
Inside, I awaited the sneering envoy who had promised answers hidden beneath wine skins and paper trails gone brittle with cosmic dust. <words>45</words>
He arrived furiously tranquil, eyes blazing while his lips curved down, as though serenity itself needed fangs. <words>62</words>
Without greeting, he slid a folded note across a barrel table, its creases glowing faint blue from bioluminescent spores trapped in the parchment. <words>85</words>
The message offered a single imperative: sift the bones of history through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse. <words>104</words>
I tasted the words like vinegar, yet destiny was rambling tonight, and its voice echoed between the curved panes. <words>123</words>
Together we pushed past sagging vines, following a corridor where grape clusters hung shriveled as though saving their last sweetness for gods. <words>145</words>
The envoy spoke of our shared goal, to cup starlight in mortal palms before the plain outside curdled into night everlasting. <words>166</words>
Only the greenhouse, he claimed, still remembered the moment across the hush of a possibility just born, when sunlight first kissed the soil. <words>189</words>
We reached a spiral stairwell leading downward into roots unnaturally thick, pulsing with forgotten harvests. <words>204</words>
There, among brittle ledgers and corks dark as collapsed stars, the envoy revealed why he sneered: every lie left its scent, and he adored perfumes of treachery. <words>231</words>
He demanded I trace paper trails backward, not forward, so the future could be blackmailed by the past. <words>249</words>
Reluctantly, I sifted scrolls made of crushed petals, each release of dust painting constellations on the lantern light. <words>267</words>
Soon a pattern emerged like a vine curling around a throat: every generation had sought the same impossible harvest, and every envoy had failed. <words>291</words>
Realization cracked my chest; the vineyard itself was the folded note, message and messenger entwined, waiting for hands bold enough to unfold its light. <words>315</words>
I turned on the sneering envoy, furiously tranquil in my resolve, and told him the starlight would be cupped by no one's command. <words>338</words>
With a howl swallowed by glass, I climbed back to the vineyard floor and tore open the ceiling valves, letting the raw night spill torrents of silver. <words>365</words>
Moon shards poured onto desiccated vines, and each grape erupted into a miniature nebula, finally offering their stored dawn to the void. <words>387</words>
Across the hush of a possibility just born, I felt starlight gather in my wet palms, neither owned nor stolen, simply shared. <words>409</words>
Behind me, the envoy shriveled like a forgotten receipt, undone by the very glow he once schemed to chain. <words>428</words>
The vineyard hummed a rambling destiny, its song spiraling into the barren alien night, promising that tomorrow would ferment wonders no ledger could audit. <words>452</words>
