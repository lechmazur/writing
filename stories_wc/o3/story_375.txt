I studied the orphaned schematics of Zenith Gorge while the wind hissed through fractured antennas. <words>15</words>
The suspended city of radio towers dangled above the abyss like stubborn constellations refusing collapse. <words>30</words>
Its abandoned catwalks echoed with ghosts of broadcasts and the threat of unlearned lessons. <words>44</words>
I came as a smiling saboteur, notebook in pocket and anger distilled into tranquil focus. <words>59</words>
My motivation was not petty vandalism but to channel the wrath of a star. <words>73</words>
Somewhere in the cosmos, Betelgeuse roiled, and I intended to echo its red fury here. <words>88</words>
Progress would unfold imaginatively realistic, every step tested against structural equations and storybook daring alike. <words>103</words>
Throughout studying tower blueprints, I marked flaws with charcoal, embracing the beauty of imperfection. <words>117</words>
Cracks, corrosion, and asymmetry were not problems; they were verses in the poem of collapse. <words>132</words>
Night descended, gifting shadows to my intent, yet my scuffed flashlight kept reluctant vigil. <words>146</words>
Its battered lens scattered light like chipped stained glass, reminding me perfection cracks under meaning. <words>161</words>
Below a rusted stairwell waited an antique store once wedged between towers, mannequins still on display. <words>177</words>
Rumor claimed the mannequins spoke when no broadcast filled the air, trading frequencies for whispers. <words>192</words>
I descended, flashlight trembling, eager for their counsel on cracks, stars, and orchestrated ruin. <words>206</words>
The wooden door sighed open, exhaling dust that glittered like tiny galaxies trapped by gravity. <words>221</words>
Within, porcelain faces surveyed me, lips parted, paint peeling in delicate meteoric scars. <words>234</words>
Their imperfection felt sovereign, and I bowed, feeling Betelgeuse throb behind my sternum. <words>247</words>
A mannequin wearing a cracked aviator helmet spoke first, radio-static mixing with syllables. <words>260</words>
“Progress is imbalance,” it rasped, “tip the towers just enough and the gorge will sing.” <words>275</words>
Another mannequin, missing an arm, added that anger must pace itself like clock gears starved of oil. <words>292</words>
I listened, pen scratching equations onto my notebook margins, translating wrath into load distributions. <words>306</words>
Throughout studying their haunted engineering, I felt an angry peace settle, hot yet symmetrical. <words>320</words>
Just before dawn, I wired charges at nodes the mannequins blessed, each placed with reverent imprecision. <words>336</words>
The flashlight died, but darkness felt fitting; Betelgeuse required no filament to ignite faith. <words>350</words>
I retreated to the rim of the gorge and waited, notebook closed like a completed prayer. <words>366</words>
When the sun’s first glare met the towers, explosives hummed, shaping silence into thunderous bloom. <words>381</words>
Metal spires leaned, cracked, and cascaded, their collapse choreographed by imperfections I once underlined. <words>395</words>
Across the gorge, echoes resembled a stellar heartbeat, furious yet measured, and my smile finally faltered. <words>411</words>
I realized the wrath I borrowed had progressed into beauty, and imperfection had returned the favor. <words>427</words>
Among settling dust and murmuring mannequins, Zenith Gorge glittered with shattered glass, each shard a peaceful scream. <words>444</words>
