Rain patted plastic rooftops of the sprawling greenhouse city, drumming a doleful-cheer rhythm against cracked glass. <words>16</words>
Outside, the sky glowed toxic green, yet vines behind transparent walls breathed with statically dynamic vigor. <words>32</words>
Florian Pallas, a famously spineless cult leader, shuffled along a catwalk clutching a chipped ceramic owl figurine. <words>49</words>
He despised birds yet trusted this silent sentinel to amplify his influence among hothouse disciples. <words>64</words>
They followed because he promised purpose, but he followed because flowers might finally speak their private grammar. <words>81</words>
Tonight, amid rain showers, he approached the central dome where memory exhibitions shimmered inside misty aisles. <words>97</words>
The cult archived every citizen photograph, pinning them beside living orchids as devotional study material. <words>112</words>
Over decades, tears had dried upon those prints, leaving faint shimmers that blurred boundaries between ink and light. <words>130</words>
Florian believed the shimmer spoke, a spectral Morse that only the owl could transcribe into floral syntax. <words>147</words>
He placed the figurine before a wilted rose, whispering apologies for his chronic inability to command conviction. <words>164</words>
The owlâ€™s glazed eyes caught leaking roofwater and refracted it onto the photographs like resurrected tears. <words>180</words>
In that trembling sparkle, faces of the lost seemed to nod, granting him reluctant, sorrowful cheer. <words>196</words>
He addressed them, voice quivering like a seedling in exhaust fumes, begging instruction in the language of flowers. <words>214</words>
A hush, woven from dripping gutters and restless leaves, settled over the aisle. <words>227</words>
Then a lily unfurled prematurely, petals freckled with chemical rain yet perfuming the air with distant memory. <words>244</words>
Florian interpreted the scent as a verb meaning 'Listen,' and he obeyed with slavish relief. <words>259</words>
Memories bled from the photos, forming murmurs about roots seeking water beyond glass, about prisoners and gardeners being same. <words>278</words>
The boundaries between portrait and plant dissolved; orchids flashed childhood smiles, while monochrome toddlers sprouted thorny stems. <words>295</words>
Terrified yet elated, Florian realized influence required surrender, not control. <words>305</words>
He knelt, spine curving like an abandoned hose, and let greenhouse humidity soak his robe. <words>320</words>
Rain thundered harder, cracking the dome, inviting filthy atmosphere to mingle with cultivated oxygen. <words>334</words>
The owl figurine slipped from the puddled altar and shattered, releasing no spirit, only silence. <words>349</words>
Yet the lily kept opening, translating silence into fragrance that every disciple instantly understood. <words>363</words>
They began tearing down plastic partitions, letting rain poison and nurture simultaneously, accepting blurred boundaries as sacred law. <words>381</words>
Florian watched, useless yet fulfilled, as the greenhouse city became a statically dynamic ruin blooming with newfound speech. <words>399</words>
For the first time, he heard the flowers clearly, and their vocabulary wept gentle laughter through the toxic rain. <words>418</words>
