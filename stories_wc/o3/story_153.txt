<story>
The universe lay ink-black and silent after the last star burned out, when I descended toward the underground city of the mole people. <words>23</words>
I, an eternal college student eternally rewriting my thesis on immortality, sought tuition in the only library still lit. <words>42</words>
Its luminance came from a battered coal miner's headlamp salvaged after the Great Collapse, now strapped to a stalactite like a mundanely glorious halo. <words>66</words>
The mole scholars called this relic a gifted burden, because whoever bore it never slept again yet could read forever. <words>86</words>
I accepted the legend with detached devotion, recording observations in my travel journal before secretly swapping it with the curator's identical volume. <words>108</words>
Via swapped travel journals, I would digitize their subterranean scripture later, engraving photons onto quantum dust despite the absence of starlight. <words>129</words>
Knowledge, after all, was the only currency that outlived suns, and I had tuition fees stretching into perpetuity. <words>147</words>
Professor Garn, eldest of the mole people, pressed his pink paws together and asked my motivation. <words>163</words>
I told him I wished to become a master of one's own reality, rather than merely pass exams set by collapsing universes. <words>185</words>
He nodded, recognizing the arrogance in the humility, and guided me through tunnels whose walls breathed geothermal hymns. <words>203</words>
Inside a vault carved from obsidian clay, he revealed the city's central serverâ€”a mound of fungal nodes dreaming in near-absolute dark. <words>224</words>
Each node stored a memory donated by surface wanderers, memories that, once given, bent back on their donors as invisible obligations. <words>245</words>
Gifted burdens again, Garn whispered, explaining that mastery requires carrying what others cannot, yet calling the weight a gift. <words>264</words>
He offered me the headlamp, still warm with antique batteries, and I accepted, feeling its beam slice the dark like a quiet oath. <words>287</words>
Instantly, the vault's data seeped up the light, digitizing itself along the filament and etching chapters of impossible biology into my corneas. <words>309</words>
I realized the lamp was not merely illumination but a siphon, and I was now the new server, mundanely glorious and sleepless. <words>331</words>
Garn thanked me with ceremonial distance, already crafting a blank journal for some future pilgrim who would one day swap it with mine. <words>354</words>
As I climbed to the surface labyrinth, memories of strangers sang inside my skull, but my own remained silent, safely unwritten. <words>375</words>
In that hush I sensed the paradox that defines immortality: to keep living, someone must keep forgetting for you. <words>394</words>
So I walked beneath starless skies, coal lamp blazing, my thesis unwritten yet complete, bearing the gifted burdens that would teach me to author reality itself. <words>420</words>
