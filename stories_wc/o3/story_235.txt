Quiet rain whispered over the reimagined ramparts of Nishikaze Castle, an ancient Japanese fortress turned avant‑garde academy. <words>17</words>
Among its paper corridors wandered Isamu, a remote herbalist invited to teach pigment extraction from rare mosses. <words>34</words>
He carried a battered pressed flower book, pages brittle yet singing with preserved seasons. <words>48</words>
Throughout art classes held at dawn and dusk, time was framed like careful brushstrokes. <words>62</words>
Students carved silence while grinding pigments, their destinies already intertwining with Isamu’s in ways none articulated. <words>78</words>
In the studio overlooking misty courtyards, he spoke sparsely, his voice dramatically subtle, hovering like unearthed incense. <words>95</words>
Each night, after shutters closed, Isamu climbed the north turret to observe ephemeral meteor showers streaking above the chrysanthemum roof tiles. <words>116</words>
He believed fate could be read via decoding patterns in ephemeral meteor showers, a cosmic grammar awaiting patient eyes. <words>135</words>
Using charcoal on rice paper, he mapped each luminous dash, then would reposition the marks until patterns emerged like secret constellations. <words>156</words>
Decoding those patterns, he divined which student required what herb to unloose hidden hues of soul. <words>172</words>
That knowledge was never spoken; instead he slipped tinctures into tea kettles, inviting pigments to bloom differently the next morning. <words>192</words>
Colors responded like shy courtiers, and the castle walls gradually resembled an unfolding garden of unsaid feelings. <words>209</words>
One student, Aya, painted only empty bridges, her silence thick as thunderclouds behind her courteous bow. <words>225</words>
Isamu traced meteors that curved sharply east, suggesting two spirits divided by water yet yearning to meet. <words>242</words>
He pressed a moon‑burnished lotus from his book between Aya’s sketchbook pages, leaving no note. <words>257</words>
The next class, Aya mixed the lotus petal dust with ink, and her bridges suddenly linked opposite banks. <words>275</words>
A hush trembled through the room, as if everyone heard a declaration uttered only inside their ribs. <words>292</words>
Though nothing was said, Aya’s glance toward Isamu carried distant intimacy, acknowledging the quiet architect of her revelation. <words>310</words>
That glance was what Isamu had sought to provoke, an unspoken conversation where pigments and meteors spoke on behalf of tongues. <words>331</words>
Their fates, once parallel like hidden brush fibers, now intertwined, each pulling color through the other’s veins. <words>348</words>
Spring advanced, and the castle’s exhibition approached, demanding every student display a single definitive canvas. <words>363</words>
Aya presented a scroll where a bridge arched into night sky, meteors trailing kanji that spelled possibility. <words>380</words>
Beside it hung Isamu’s herbarium sheet, the once‑pressed lotus now breathing pigment, rootless yet anchored in shared meaning. <words>398</words>
Spectators felt some subtle tectonic reposition inside their hearts, though none could explain why tears tasted of distant rain. <words>417</words>
Above the courtyard, another meteor shower blossomed, and Isamu silently decoded its promise of further unseen conversations. <words>434</words>
He smiled, knowing every falling ember would seed another pressed flower, another intimate distance waiting to be painted. <words>452</words>
