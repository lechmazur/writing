I was convicted for stealing dreams on the very night the stars finally went silent.<words>15</words>
That verdict echoes still, even though no jury remains after the last human was born and gone.<words>32</words>
Now I haunt a forgotten library inside a treehouse whose branches claw the ash‑colored clouds.<words>47</words>
Books sag on mossy shelves, yet I keep cataloguing them with a quiet mania nobody hears.<words>63</words>
The catalog numbers never add up, because mathematics, like humanity, abandoned me to gibbering riddles.<words>78</words>
Being mathematically challenged is embarrassing for a librarian, even one sentenced only by ghosts.<words>92</words>
I leaf through a flimsy photo album to remember the faces I once lifted from sleepers.<words>108</words>
Each page crumbles like pastry, and the images fragment, mirroring the fractured chambers of my mind.<words>124</words>
I have become a gallery of mismatched selves, taped together where arithmetic should have supplied symmetry.<words>140</words>
To keep from snapping, I nurture one obsession: coaxing thunder from empty skies.<words>153</words>
Thunder once answered every stadium roar, our shared love for baseball knitting strangers into temporary constellations.<words>169</words>
If the heavens will clap again, maybe the crowd lodged inside my skull will align.<words>184</words>
So each night I climb the spiral ladder hacked into the trunk and plunge onto the roof.<words>201</words>
There I swing a cracked bat made of lightning‑struck cedar at phantom pitches only I can perceive.<words>218</words>
The impactless impacts rumble through branches, and the sky shudders, but no real thunder replies.<words>233</words>
Still, the ritual matters, like balancing an equation with variables nobody remembers.<words>245</words>
One dusk, a silver droplet of sound descends, soft as a seed, and lands atop my bat.<words>262</words>
It quivers, then splits, revealing a newborn dream shaped like a scorekeeper’s bell.<words>275</words>
I realize the skies are bankrupt, but forgotten libraries still accrue interest in longing.<words>289</words>
So I hurry downward, shelving the bell‑dream beside Euclid, hoping geometry can do what arithmetic could not.<words>306</words>
Pages rustle like bleachers filling, and the treehouse sways with phantom ticket stubs and cheers.<words>321</words>
A scoreboard flickers across the ceiling, chalking zero against zero, mirroring my fragmented self.<words>335</words>
Quiet mania surges; I swear if I can notch one run, thunder will be forced to applaud.<words>352</words>
I yank open the photo album, tear free a picture of a child catching a foul ball, and fold it into a paper sphere.<words>376</words>
Pitching to myself, I loft the memory toward the ceiling’s makeshift scoreboard and swing with everything left inside me.<words>395</words>
Contact exists only in imagination, yet the sphere bursts, scattering photons that sound exactly like distant drums.<words>412</words>
The scoreboard flips to one, and outside, a single thunderclap rolls, shy but unmistakable.<words>426</words>
Lightning does not follow, yet the library brightens, and for a breath I feel whole.<words>441</words>
I know the sky will empty again, but now it is my turn to keep the score.<words>458</words>
