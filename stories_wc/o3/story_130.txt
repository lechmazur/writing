I always hated fruit trees, which is why the interstellar orchard ship hired me as their pruning apprentice. <words>18</words>
They assumed disdain would ripen into devotion across the promise of changing winds, but instead it simply left me lost. <words>38</words>
So I wandered between hydroponic groves pretending to inventory nectar moons while secretly searching for traveler’s wisdom. <words>55</words>
Captain Pomona, all velvet glare and mocking affection, called me “pipsqueak philosopher” whenever I paused to smell antimatter blossoms. <words>74</words>
Yet her insults fertilized thought better than any manure drone. <words>84</words>
One rotational dusk a fallen bird’s nest clattered from the ventilation branches and landed in my bowl of star-peaches. <words>103</words>
Inside crouched a cracked hologram egg broadcasting static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone nobody remembered installing. <words>120</words>
Its looping monologue began, “We tried to reverse-engineer freedom and built cages shaped like ourselves.” <words>135</words>
The voice sounded like mine after too many recycled sunsets. <words>145</words>
Curiosity, privately open yet terrified, pried me wider than any airlock. <words>156</words>
I carried the nest to the ship’s chlorophyll library, where fruit flies sipped equations from sugar-coated pages. <words>173</words>
There the egg played other fragments: coordinates of distant orchards, recipes for silence, and a farewell recorded by the first apprentice. <words>194</words>
He had vanished years ago, rumor claimed, swallowed by dark matter mildew. <words>206</words>
But his final words—filtered through crackle—declared that self-acceptance was lighter than thrust and sharper than pruning shears. <words>223</words>
I realized the orchard ship itself was our cage, migrating between galaxies yet never letting roots touch soil. <words>241</words>
To unlock the gate I would need to prune my own apprenticeship. <words>253</words>
I pressed the egg to my ear and asked how. <words>263</words>
It answered with coordinates for an umbilical shuttle designed for sap deliveries, small enough to steal. <words>279</words>
Reverse-engineering the autopilot, I coded a destination the captain could not ridicule: wherever winds promised to change. <words>296</words>
When Pomona discovered the missing shuttle, she broadcast in that same teasing register, “Fly, pipsqueak, but remember who trimmed your wings.” <words>317</words>
Her taunt felt like a ribbon rather than a chain, and I laughed with mocking affection of my own. <words>336</words>
Across nebular dawns I piloted the shuttle, the bird’s nest nested beside the control seeds, whispering directions. <words>353</words>
Each confession crackled softer until silence remained, stripped of static and of the orchard’s expectations. <words>368</words>
In that hush I located freedom, not as coordinates but as quiet acceptance expanding like a private bloom. <words>386</words>
The winds indeed changed, and I let them carry both shuttle and soul toward whatever soil would welcome fallen nests. <words>406</words>
