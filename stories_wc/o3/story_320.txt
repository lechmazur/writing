Maris, a shy diviner who read destinies in ripples rather than cards, hated crowds but loved currents. <words>17</words>
That contradiction let her move through the forgotten underwater city market like a ghost nobody bothered. <words>33</words>
Barnacle coated stalls displayed relic fruits, jade squid ink, and bins of vintage photographs sealed in coral frames. <words>51</words>
Each gelatin silver portrait shimmered with the echo of regret, an aftertaste of someone else's missed tide. <words>68</words>
Maris collected these images, sure they stored the imbalance twisting through parallel timelines like a frayed anchor chain. <words>86</words>
She needed proof, and proof, in twenty first century surface culture, had to precipitate digitally. <words>101</words>
So she posted one photograph each dawn on a bland account, captions written in confusingly clear riddles about tides that never met. <words>123</words>
Followers multiplied, sharing the hypnotic salt-stained faces and wondering whose history they unwrapped. <words>136</words>
But the true audience was herself across other strands of when, versions of Maris drifting in alternate canals. <words>154</words>
Algorithms, unaware of magic, stitched the posts into a pattern only a diviner could decode, opening intertidal inboxes in myriad realities. <words>175</words>
From each inbox spilled questions, pleas, and apologies, a communal murmur of almosts seeking closure. <words>190</words>
Maris answered none, maintaining passionate disinterest the way some people maintain gardens, pruning empathy so it grew stronger by absence. <words>210</words>
Silence was her magnet; soon the photographs began to vibrate in their coral, humming with converging possibilities. <words>227</words>
One night the market roof, a quilt of broken domes, cracked, and currents from rival timelines bled through. <words>245</words>
The imbalance threatened to drown every version of tomorrow into yesterday's undertow. <words>257</words>
Maris stepped onto a crate of petrified seaweed and spoke, her voice a bubble nobody heard yet everyone felt. <words>276</words>
She named each regret swirling above, then named its opposite, letting the words precipitate into glimmering scales that sealed the cracks. <words>297</words>
Across the surface network, every post inverted, captions dissolving into calm blankness, followers forgetting why they ever cared. <words>315</words>
In alternate canals, other Marises felt a sudden rightness, the spine-deep click of worlds realigned. <words>330</words>
She watched the market settle, stalls gentling like anemones after storm, and allowed herself one soft heartbeat of triumph. <words>349</words>
Then her habitual disinterest resurfaced, passionate as ever in its refusal to linger, and she slipped back into anonymity. <words>368</words>
Only the vintage photographs now empty of sorrow marked that anything cosmic had shifted at all. <words>384</words>
She packed them into a kelp satchel, the gelatin faces smooth as sleep, and walked toward deeper ruins where no markets existed. <words>406</words>
Somewhere behind her, a single bubble carried the faintest echo of regret that even victory cannot erase, and that, she thought, was balance enough. <words>430</words>
