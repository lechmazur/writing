Silence draped the giant mushroom meeting hall like velvet mist during the hush of a dreamless night.<words>17</words>
At the center sat Ellory, a dry‑tongued bard whose jokes left lips parched and minds oddly quenched.<words>34</words>
He balanced a stained glass prism on his knee, letting shards of moonless lantern‑glow fracture across the domed gills overhead.<words>54</words>
The kaleidoscope light could not, however, pierce the cloak of doubt wrapped around his slender shoulders.<words>70</words>
Such doubt, gorgeously awkward, fit him like a too‑bright feather in a beggar’s hat.<words>84</words>
He had come to preserve a single impossible note, and thereby escape the prison of the self.<words>101</words>
But songs decayed faster than mushrooms bloom, leaving only their husks to haunt the ear.<words>116</words>
Ellory’s answer hid in the cellar of technology rather than the rafters of rhyme.<words>130</words>
Every jest, confession, and crooned refrain he once feared to utter now whispered back to him through forgotten voicemails.<words>149</words>
The messages played from a cracked shell‑phone hidden beneath a cap of luminous mycelium.<words>163</words>
Their metallic ghosts braided with the prism’s light, forming a trembling chord only he could taste.<words>179</words>
Each note licked his inner ear with desert dryness, a reminder of the tongue that birthed them.<words>196</words>
Yet within that aridity he sensed an oasis of possibility.<words>206</words>
If he could weave the voicemails into a single seamless ballad, perhaps the cloak would loosen.<words>222</words>
He set to work, fingertips sliding over mushroom stalks that served as living strings.<words>236</words>
Each pluck released a damp resonance that soaked into the prism, dyeing the echoes.<words>250</words>
Soon the hall hummed with crisp languor, a lazy precision that made stillness feel athletic.<words>265</words>
Outside, night kept its promise of no dreams, granting the performance a vault of undisturbed silence.<words>281</words>
Ellory inhaled, tasted mushroom spores and antique static, and exhaled a ribbon of sound stitched from memory’s debris.<words>299</words>
The cloak of doubt slid from his shoulders and pooled like shed shadow at his boots.<words>315</words>
He did not notice the audience arriving, because no creature entered save his reflected selves dancing in facet and echo.<words>335</words>
They applauded with voiceless hands, acknowledging the freedom born of recycled whispers.<words>347</words>
Ellory bowed, gorgeously awkward, as though his joints were learning courtesy for the first time.<words>362</words>
The stained glass prism dimmed, having preserved the music in fragile chromatic strata.<words>375</words>
Tomorrow, perhaps, he would shatter it and scatter the shards across daylight so others might overhear.<words>391</words>
Tonight, he simply slipped into the vacancy where doubt had lived and reclined there, lighter than breath.<words>408</words>
