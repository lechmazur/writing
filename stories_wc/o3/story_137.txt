At the hush after a cashier closes out the register, black night folded open like velvet around the floating stairway to the temple in the clouds. <words>26</words>
Milo, a subtly gifted yet subtle illusionist, climbed with casually intense composure, every footstep scattering faint sparks of doubt from the air. <words>48</words>
He had come not for spectacle but to learn the language of the heart, a dialect rumored to echo only above lost altars. <words>71</words>
An unmarked binder clip, cold and ordinary, pinched his jacket pocket shut, guarding the sole page he dared not lose. <words>91</words>
That page carried instructions woven into an antique lace pattern, knots and gaps spelling truths invisible to untrained eyes. <words>110</words>
If deciphered at dawn, they promised to rekindle the forgotten choir whose vowels fed sunrise itself. <words>126</words>
But midnight was early yet, and the temple corridors breathed a doleful cheer, like widows humming birthday songs. <words>144</words>
Marble clouds coiled around pillars carved to resemble trunks, hinting that the understory grows even where roots cannot anchor. <words>163</words>
Milo traced these carvings, palms reading grainless stone as though feeling pulse beneath bark, searching for syllables of that secret tongue. <words>184</words>
A sudden flicker of market fluorescents flashed in his memory—the shifting hour when the cashier had smiled and dimmed the lights below. <words>206</words>
That hush had rung like a starting bell, urging him upward before ordinary day could resume its static illusions. <words>225</words>
Now, alone, he unclipped the binder, freeing the lace-edged sheet that trembled as though remembering ballroom music. <words>242</words>
Threaded within floral loops, a diagram instructed him to breathe mist into each eye of the pattern, then listen. <words>261</words>
He exhaled hopes he had never voiced, and the lace fluttered, projecting soft silhouettes that rearranged the hallway's shadows. <words>280</words>
The silhouettes spoke in pulses, not phonemes, beating against his ribs until meaning bled through like sunlight under eyelids. <words>299</words>
They said the understory grows wherever longing falls as rain, and that illusion is simply canopy waiting to part. <words>318</words>
Understanding cracked him open; memories of every smile he had conjured for crowds poured back, revealing the loneliness staged inside applause. <words>339</words>
Tears—casually intense, like rain falling from a sunlit sky—streaked his cheeks, each droplet a syllable in the new lexicon. <words>358</words>
He gathered the lace, folded it over the page, and fastened both with the binder clip, sealing the heartbeat he had finally heard. <words>381</words>
Far below, the cashier would reopen the shop to dawn, unaware that a quiet miracle now trembled above the produce aisle. <words>402</words>
And Milo, refreshed yet wounded, stepped toward the stairway down, carrying a heart fluent enough to deceive no one, least of all himself. <words>425</words>
