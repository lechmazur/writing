<story>
I wandered into the nano-forest at dusk, craving the strange angry peace only miniature trees can whisper.<words>17</words>
Their leaves, smaller than fingernails, rattled like dissent muffled under velvet, and I listened cautiously.<words>32</words>
I am Ballad, a guarded minstrel who sings nothing unless every note has passed interrogation.<words>47</words>
Tonight my guitar slumbered, because I hunted knowledge, not applause.<words>57</words>
Rumor said forgotten artisans once stitched symphonies into bark here, crafts now extinct for lack of curious heirs.<words>75</words>
To relearn their handiwork is my rebellion against scripted commerce, my private grassroots movement.<words>89</words>
Yet movements birth spies alongside dreamers, so I trusted nothing except the plain plastic bookmark tucked in my breast pocket.<words>109</words>
It looks trivial, but its ridges encode ciphers older than my kingdom’s crown.<words>122</words>
I remain skeptically credulous: doubting every surface, believing every possibility.<words>132</words>
That paradox guides me like a hesitant compass.<words>140</words>
Deep among moss-pixels I discovered a marble lectern whose lid was welded shut by what looked like silence.<words>158</words>
The bookmark fit the seam, clicked, and the lid sighed open, revealing a hidden diary bound in dustlight.<words>176</words>
Its pages glowed, begging to be read when a last vow is written in a hidden diary, or so the legend warned.<words>198</words>
But no vow stained the parchment yet, which meant the prophecies were unfinished and still editable.<words>214</words>
I inhaled the angry peace again, then began decrypting wedding vows that never happened, etched faintly between the lines.<words>233</words>
Each decryption unfurled a pattern demonstrating how luthiers once carved resonant hollows using swarms of obedient termites.<words>250</words>
The extinct craft surfaced letter by letter, drone by drone.<words>260</words>
Ecstatic, I almost sang, but the next cipher accused me of betrayal.<words>272</words>
It declared that learning alone was theft unless I chose to disown the royal sponsors funding my wanderings.<words>290</words>
Their coin shackles songs just as iron cages phoenixes, the script scolded.<words>302</words>
An internal riot brewed, but I answered with controlled breath, refusing fury’s shout.<words>315</words>
I tore the royal crest from my cloak and laid it atop the diary like a surrendered shield.<words>333</words>
In that act I both upheld and abandoned my own legend, a harmony of angry peace.<words>349</words>
The nano-forest resonated, branches ringing soft chords that no larger wood could sustain.<words>362</words>
Grassroots movements begin exactly so, the diary remarked in fresh ink, sprouting from one disavowed coin and countless shared echoes.<words>382</words>
I accepted the mandate, skeptically credulous as ever, promising to teach termite-luthery to whomever would listen and question.<words>400</words>
Before leaving, I pressed the plain plastic bookmark between the diary’s last blank leaves, sealing the future’s vow inside silence.<words>420</words>
Behind me, the nano-forest hummed like a choir neither loyal nor rebellious, only infinitely awake.<words>435</words>
