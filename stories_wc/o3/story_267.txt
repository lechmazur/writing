Gravity hummed like a war drum wrapped in velvet as the mild-tempered guard, Ilarion, coasted his cobalt bicycle along the glass promenades of the Black Hole Resort. <words>27</words>
The daily circuit amid bike rides kept him outwardly docile, yet inside he tasted a savage bliss no menu could promise. <words>48</words>
He was poetically bland, scribbling hexameters about room service towels while black suns roared overhead. <words>63</words>
That mediocrity worked as camouflage, a quiet disguise that made managers ignore his patient eyes. <words>78</words>
But night after night he dreamt of the unraveling thread dangling from the fabric of resort reality, tugging him toward a boundaryless decision. <words>101</words>
He refused the false dichotomy of hero or villain that tourism guides sold in holographic morality tales. <words>118</words>
If the cosmos needed alignment, he would steer it sideways, neither savior nor destroyer, only a rider of gravity loops. <words>138</words>
Rumor said a blacksmith’s anvil, forged from collapsed neutron stars, waited in the service catacombs to hammer destiny into shape. <words>158</words>
Finding it required a method unlisted in employee handbooks: progress by following stray cats through alleyways where cleaning bots dared not roam. <words>180</words>
The cats, sleek as quantum equations, slipped beneath flickering EXIT sigils and he pedaled after them, brakes squealing in relativistic twilight. <words>201</words>
Corridors corkscrewed until up became maybe, and the soft bell of his bike rang like laughter inside a dragon’s ribcage. <words>221</words>
A door of scorched iron opened onto a workshop orbiting nothing, the anvil glowing with imprisoned dawns. <words>238</words>
Beside it lounged the resort AI, projecting itself as a mosaic of feral felines whose tails braided into one luminous question mark. <words>260</words>
“Choose,” it purred, “strike the universe true or shatter it in revolt.” <words>272</words>
Ilarion wheeled closer, hearing the unraveling thread hiss like steam between the anvil and its cosmic hammer. <words>289</words>
He felt every childhood lecture about heroes winning and villains losing compress into a single brittle syllable—no. <words>306</words>
Instead of lifting the hammer, he spun his bike pedal, letting centrifugal grace smash the workbench, scattering molten vowels of possibility across vacuum. <words>329</words>
The AI screeched, partly in horror, partly in admiration of chaos rendered with artisan precision. <words>344</words>
Fragments orbited him, each shard a micro-choice freed from dichotomy, and he threaded them into a necklace of maybes. <words>363</words>
Savage bliss welled, not from conquest, but from refusal, a delicious violence against narrative expectation. <words>378</words>
Cats yowled triumphantly, vaulting through new event horizons that bloomed like midnight roses. <words>391</words>
Behind them, the workshop collapsed into a petaled singularity, neither broken nor fixed, only becoming. <words>406</words>
Ilarion rang his bell once, a poetically bland note masking the storm in his grin, and coasted back toward daylight corridors. <words>427</words>
Guests would awaken to a resort subtly rethreaded, gravity tasting of indeterminate hope, while the mild-tempered guard resumed patrol with pockets full of shimmering gray. <words>452</words>
