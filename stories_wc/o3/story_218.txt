Rain stitched pale lines across the attic window of the forgotten clock tower.<words>13</words>
Inside, Milo Vex, reclusive board game designer, hunched over parchment, drafting labyrinthine tiles.<words>26</words>
Each stroke belonged to a ritual, because during drawing his world temporarily quieted.<words>39</words>
He designed not for players but to shadowbox with personal demons materializing between grids.<words>53</words>
Yet tonight, a gust spun the cracked gears overhead, and another presence arrived.<words>66</words>
A phantom carnival ticket fluttered onto the drafting table, its paper both metaphysically physical and weightless.<words>82</words>
Ink pooled into miniature mirrors, showing Ferris wheels whirling in black voids.<words>94</words>
Milo recognized the invitation: solve the ticket's puzzle, win the gift of belonging.<words>107</words>
Belonging was a prize he'd shelved beside outdated prototypes and unopened condolence letters.<words>120</words>
Still, he pocketed the ticket and descended the spiral stairs, abandoning sketches mid-breath.<words>133</words>
By chance, he encountered a sign for an improv show blinking beneath puddled lamplight.<words>147</words>
He bought entry with the phantom ticket, surprised when the usher stamped imaginary ink.<words>161</words>
The house lights dimmed; performers asked for a volunteer whose mind loved mazes.<words>174</words>
Crowd murmured, yet Milo felt a near distance, as though watching himself raise hand.<words>188</words>
Onstage, he was told to escape an invisible carnival before the bell tolled.<words>201</words>
The troupe mimed mirrors, ticket booths, and clocks, but Milo supplied the hidden corridors.<words>215</words>
He traced paths in air, the audience echoing steps, the stage becoming his board.<words>229</words>
With each improv pivot, a demon from his notebooks emerged, then dissolved under laughter.<words>243</words>
The bell rang when Milo offered the final square: a small booth labeled Home.<words>257</words>
He stepped through the mimed curtain and sensed gears realigning inside the tower miles away.<words>272</words>
Applause snapped lights brighter, revealing the theater empty except for him and the ticket.<words>286</words>
Its ink now bore coordinates and the single word: Belong.<words>296</words>
Heart hammering, he followed the numbers back through rain toward the clock tower.<words>309</words>
Inside, his abandoned drawings had rearranged, carving a seat amid the labyrinth.<words>321</words>
The seat looked metaphysically physical, shimmering yet solid like a possibility given mass.<words>334</words>
Milo sat, placing the carnival ticket at the maze's heart as a keystone.<words>347</words>
Clock gears chimed in warm accord, and shadows withdrew, leaving outlines of future friends.<words>361</words>
He understood belonging was not an exit but a room he could design together.<words>375</words>
Outside, dawn smeared pink onto wet roofs, and Milo finally opened the tower door.<words>389</words>
His escape, he realized, was a return bearing blueprints others might finish.<words>401</words>
