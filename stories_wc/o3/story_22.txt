Marigold Finch, the perfectly flawed librarian of Dustwick, found adventure wedged between overdue receipts and dust motes.<words>17</words>
It came disguised as a stolen museum artifact tag, thin as a bookmark and twice as disreputable.<words>34</words>
The tag whispered coordinates to a portal-strewn canyon riddled with ancient carvings, beckoning her cataloger's curiosity.<words>50</words>
Marigold practiced a smile of mocking sincerity, locked the library, and chased the rumor like a loose page on wind.<words>70</words>
Dustwick's gossiping elders, silent watchers through generations, pretended not to see her vanish beyond the abandoned rail tunnel.<words>88</words>
They had waited for someone willing to harvest grace from the canyon's impossible doors, and she looked gullible enough.<words>107</words>
Grace, in this sarcastic geology, ripened like fruit on invisible vines strung between portals, fragrant with consequence.<words>124</words>
Whoever gathered it could become a legend whispered through time, or merely mulch for cosmic compost.<words>140</words>
Marigold, who cataloged destinies like pamphlets, preferred the first option but kept her obituary in a back pocket just in case.<words>161</words>
She arrived at dusk to find the canyon humming, portals blinking open like bored eyelids, carvings laughing in basalt relief.<words>181</words>
A scent of peppery pumpkin stew slithered from one gateway, reminding her of the recipe she once shared with absent friends.<words>202</words>
Food, she realized, was the canyon's secret handshake, the method by which portals judged whether to spit or welcome travelers.<words>222</words>
She ladled memory into air, describing the stew's cinnamon bite with librarian precision until a doorway widened, drooling orange light.<words>242</words>
Inside, a marble orchard shimmered, each sphere containing a frozen act of kindness waiting for harvest.<words>258</words>
Marigold reached for one, but the tag in her pocket suddenly glowed, projecting curatorial crimes committed to acquire these spheres.<words>278</words>
The canyon demanded she dismantle that history, not repeat it.<words>288</words>
So she cataloged every wrongdoing aloud, indexing treachery with scholarly glee until the spheres cracked, releasing warm gusts of rebalanced grace.<words>309</words>
Grace flowed into her like library dawn light, imperfect and therefore perfectly suited to someone already perfectly flawed.<words>327</words>
Portals applauded by closing, carvings carved another grin, and Marigold tasted pumpkin on the wind, certain the legend had begun.<words>347</words>
Back in Dustwick, the elders marked her absence with theatrical shrugs, betting pastries on whether she would return breathing.<words>366</words>
Instead, evenings soon carried stories of a librarian who corrected cosmic footnotes and seasoned portals with pumpkin, told in hushed snickers.<words>387</words>
Children carved her name beside ancient runes, while scholars puzzled over footnote 42B that suddenly appeared in every dimension's index.<words>407</words>
The footnote read, with mocking sincerity, 'Grace is best served warm and annotated,' and the universe dutifully prepared its new edition.<words>428</words>
Somewhere beyond the last portal, Marigold filed herself under Legends, subcategory Whispered, savoring pumpkin stew while watching librarians yet unborn wander toward possibility.<words>451</words>
