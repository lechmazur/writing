Rolan, a grounded drone pilot who once mapped deserts from satellites, now stood inside an abandoned cliff-top observatory smelling of rust and wet limestone. <words>24</words>
A sorcerous malfunction had dragged him from his cockpit into this medieval realm three moons ago, and orientation still felt like chasing broken signal bars. <words>49</words>
Yet tonight, during the hush before the orchard's trees were to be cut down for war engines, he listened for opportunity instead of rescue beacons. <words>74</words>
His cynically hopeful heart believed despair could be rewired if he found the right frequency of kindness. <words>91</words>
The observatory's cracked dome opened like a charred eyelid, revealing violet stars stretched along what local monks called the Horizons of Mercy. <words>113</words>
Folklore claimed those stars judged intentions, but Rolan merely judged vectors and winds, so the myth felt comfortingly empirical. <words>132</words>
At the broken telescope's base sat a dried herb bundle wrapped with silver thread, its aroma like smoke that had chosen forgiveness. <words>154</words>
He pocketed it, recalling that herbs here were codes as much as medicine, ready to disseminate messages when burned. <words>173</words>
Before he could test the theory, footsteps echoed: twenty villagers hosting what they called a speed dating conclave among the echoes of ancient constellations. <words>197</words>
Tables fashioned from dismantled astrolabes were arranged in orbits, and participants had five breaths to offer their longing before rotating. <words>217</words>
The host, a one-eyed orchard keeper named Maelin, insisted Rolan join, because even outsiders must barter emotions before the axes swing. <words>238</words>
Rolan sat, engine nerves buzzing, while strangers recited laments about looming deforestation and the gods' silent ledgers. <words>255</words>
When the bell tolled, Maelin herself faced him, eyes like scorched plums, asking why his sorrow smelled of ozone. <words>274</words>
He told her of crashed drones, lost coordinates, and a cockpit screen that once declared, in bold system font, HORIZONS OF MERCY. <words>296</words>
Maelin nodded as if linking circuits, then revealed the orchard's elders planned to fell every tree to appease a famine god, extinguishing future shelter. <words>320</words>
She sought not romance but a stratagem to lure possibility from the brink of despair, and his outsider perspective was her last wildcard. <words>343</words>
Rolan produced the dried herb bundle, proposing they burn it inside the dome so its coded smoke would disseminate through the ruined lens and across villages. <words>369</words>
Each tendril of scent, he predicted, would display in the sky like auroral graffiti, spelling the plea, 'Spare the roots, spare yourselves.' <words>391</words>
Intrigued by charred serenity rather than frantic revolt, Maelin agreed, and together they ignited the bundle upon the cracked brass meridian. <words>412</words>
Green-gray smoke spiraled up, caught moonlight, and bled into constellations, transforming the Horizons of Mercy into scrolling sentences of living negotiation. <words>433</words>
Villagers gasped as the orchard's branches rustled, not with doom, but with migratory birds returning, a sign the famine god had revised its appetite. <words>457</words>
In that murmur of relieved wings, Rolan realized possibility had answered the smoke like a beacon, and he no longer felt lost, merely arriving. <words>481</words>
