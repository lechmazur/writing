Marin loitered on the swaying bridge toward the floating rock tea house, breathing deliberately. <words>14</words>
The morning existed in the hush of improbable beginnings, as though creation still negotiated details. <words>29</words>
His chest tightened; deep water was spacious, yet the narrow bridge planks seemed a coffin. <words>44</words>
Claustrophobia mocked the profession that had named him legendary underwater explorer throughout the archipelagos. <words>58</words>
Still, he came lightly heavyhearted, because research demanded he study human behaviors wherever they brewed. <words>73</words>
Inside, steam spiraled around polished driftwood tables nailed into the hovering basalt, smelling of cardamom. <words>88</words>
A pair of wire-rimmed glasses lay beside the teapot like a delicate compass to conversation. <words>103</words>
Hara, the proprietor, wore no spectacles, so Marin inferred they awaited a specific visitor. <words>117</words>
Her smile carried a quietly bold confidence that soothed his rattling ribs. <words>129</words>
She invited him to the tasting counter where porcelain spoons rested before jars of ancestral jam. <words>145</words>
Here, she explained, histories inflame upon the tongue, revealing motives sweeter than any confession. <words>159</words>
Marin produced his notebook, reminding himself that flavor could map behavior better than diagrams of skulls. <words>175</words>
Hara offered him a violet smear labeled 'Storm Cellar 1919,' and he tasted carefully. <words>189</words>
The jam struck him with childhood echoes—salt on lips, steel bulkheads, his mother humming in darkness. <words>205</words>
Tears surfaced, and the room seemed to tilt like an unpressurized submarine. <words>217</words>
Hara's hand touched his forearm with a warmth that traveled deeper than pressure suits. <words>231</words>
The healing touch steadied his breath and widened the corridor inside his mind. <words>244</words>
He saw then that the glasses were hers, deliberately removed so another could view through them. <words>260</words>
Perspective, she murmured, is contagious when shared. <words>267</words>
Marin asked why she pursued such intangible cartography. <words>275</words>
To study human behaviors, she replied, one must taste the preserves people spread to hide themselves. <words>291</words>
Jam becomes confession; confession becomes medicine; medicine becomes story, she said, polishing the spoon. <words>305</words>
His researcher’s instinct inflamed, but not with rivalry—with longing to contribute his own vessel of truth. <words>321</words>
From his satchel he withdrew a jar distilled from algae berries gathered three miles below continental light. <words>338</words>
Because the berries fermented under crushing silence, their flavor carried blue notes of isolation and courage. <words>354</words>
He unscrewed the lid, and claustrophobia fluttered but stayed outside like a gull repelled by incense. <words>370</words>
They tasted together, wordlessly calculating the subtle differences that charted depth of feeling. <words>383</words>
The jam’s brine harmonized with her cellar sweetness, composing a new chord neither had studied. <words>398</words>
It told of explorers who fear small spaces yet roam vast ones, and of hosts who heal strangers by flavor. <words>418</words>
In that blended note, Marin recognized a beginning wider than any ocean chamber. <words>431</words>
He placed the wire-rimmed glasses on his nose, discovering the room suddenly spacious with windows of possibility. <words>448</words>
Hara nodded, confirming the first lesson of this improbable day: vision can be tasted before it is seen. <words>466</words>
Outside, the sky shifted, and the floating rock tea house drifted quietly bold toward whatever stories waited. <words>483</words>
