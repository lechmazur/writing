Iris Coil kept her heartbeat low, because a cautious smuggler survives longer than a bold one.<words>16</words>
Yet every plan she hatched revealed her meticulously impulsive nature, a paradox she wore like mismatched cuffs.<words>33</words>
That morning she infiltrated the National Drought Prediction Center disguised as a visiting synoptic composer, humming forecasts.<words>50</words>
Her satchel held climate codes, counterfeit ID, and a pressed butterfly whose wings still remembered ultraviolet sun.<words>67</words>
The insect was her mnemonic talisman, storing musical memories of every border she had ever crossed.<words>83</words>
Whenever she fingered the brittle wings, smuggled symphonies rustled in her skull with enthusiastic apathy--bright tones she barely cared about.<words>103</words>
Security scanners bleated, but she predicted their rhythm the way drummers foresee cymbal crashes, stepping through exactly between pulses.<words>122</words>
Down in Lab Nine, a sedated painter was confessing deliriously under anesthesia, microphone petals around his mouth.<words>139</words>
Iris had bribed the anesthesiologist to loop her in during the painter's confession, because truth sings clearest through foggy tongues.<words>159</words>
She believed that harvesting raw agony from strangers would sculpt her into a master of empathy, the one art smugglers lack.<words>180</words>
The painter, unaware, mumbled pigments: 'Burnt sienna droughts, cerulean deluges, ochre cracks yawning across children's palms.'<words>196</words>
Each color hit Iris as a chord, and the pressed butterfly vibrated like a paper speaker, translating hue into melody.<words>216</words>
She recorded the synesthetic song on a covert chip hidden beneath a drought map, fingers steady, soul indifferent.<words>234</words>
Outside the booth, monitors flared scarlet: regional models suddenly predicted fifty months of dust, matching the painter's bleary vision.<words>253</words>
Technicians cheered with bureaucratic despair, anthems of enthusiastic apathy echoing along metallic corridors.<words>266</words>
Their celebration created distraction enough for Iris to slip into the archive vault where national thirst futures were kept.<words>285</words>
She replaced the official projection with her own audio file, certain that music, not models, would guide water policy tomorrow.<words>305</words>
That was her impulsive meticulousness: alter history gently, note by note, so no one could trace the tempo.<words>323</words>
Before leaving, she pinned the pressed butterfly on the painter's hospital gown, payment for the borrowed palette of pain.<words>342</words>
Its wings fluttered almost invisibly, spreading a soft quorum of hope that neither of them intended but both might need.<words>362</words>
Alarms began arguing again, predicting unauthorized data flow, yet Iris walked out whistling the drought's new lullaby.<words>379</words>
Her melody spiraled through fluorescent ducts, erasing graphs from hearts, installing empathy where numbers once clacked like empty cups.<words>398</words>
So a cautious smuggler transformed policy with musical memories, achieving mastery of empathy while pretending not to care at all.<words>418</words>
