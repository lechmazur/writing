Galen Thimble, the nostalgic tailor of Brasshaven, unlocked the wrought-iron hatch to the steampunk observation deck.<words>16</words>
Lightning flickered across the copper-studded skyline, drumming rain against the glass gears housed above the city.<words>32</words>
He arrived after the last code was broken, clutching a parchment still warm from secret mathematics.<words>48</words>
The deck's solitary ornament, a dusty mirror framed by whirring pistons, reflected two silhouettes where only one stood.<words>66</words>
Galen shivered, both comforted and haunted by that proof of parallel lives sharing his uncertain outline.<words>82</words>
He whispered measurements to himself, revisiting jackets he once stitched for lovers who chose different possibilities.<words>98</words>
Each recollection carried the subtly menacing undertone that time might rip those seams open again.<words>113</words>
Yet his hope refused to yield, tangled like silver thread he could never quite sever.<words>128</words>
Thunder growled, and with it the improbable confessions began, as they always did during storms.<words>143</words>
The mirror-double spoke first, voice identical yet distant, admitting he had burned the ascension blueprints in another world.<words>161</words>
Galen answered by confessing he had hidden the same blueprints inside a wedding gown no bride would claim.<words>179</words>
Across realities, their oppositions formed a pattern of failure and persistence, like alternating stitches locking cloth.<words>195</words>
The storm's roar grew, demanding payment for truth, and rivets rattled around the trembling deck.<words>210</words>
Galen reached toward the mirror to reassure his double, fingertips brushing cold glass as if stroking frightened fabric.<words>228</words>
"We can still ascend beyond mortal limits," he urged, voice unraveling like thread caught in gears.<words>244</words>
Behind him, steam valves hissed an anxious harmony, emphasizing both desperation and the fragile hope it sheltered.<words>261</words>
The double's eyes darkened with soot-colored certainty, yet he stretched a spectral tape measure across the glass divide.<words>279</words>
Together they read the length, forty inches, the span separating flesh from ether, agreeing a new garment must bridge it.<words>299</words>
Galen unrolled crimson fabric threaded with micro-cogs, material designed to resonate with impossible frequencies.<words>313</words>
Outside, lightning etched equations across clouds, supplying the power the broken codes had finally unlocked.<words>328</words>
He stitched while confessing every forgotten sin, each syllable a needle driving the layers of worlds nearer.<words>345</words>
Rain hammered approval, and the mirror began absorbing the coat's shimmering image, fusing pattern to reflection.<words>361</words>
When the final button engraved with a gear surrounding infinity clicked into place, the glass burst outward like dawn.<words>380</words>
Twin Galens stepped through the sparkling frame, wearing one coat across two shoulders, feeling their pulses synchronize.<words>397</words>
Below, Brasshaven gasped as the joined tailor floated above steam, magnetism, and weather, threads of realities knotting beneath his boots.<words>417</words>
Hope soared with him, desperate yet luminous, promising that carefully sewn mercy might outpace the menacing shadows still rising.<words>436</words>
And somewhere, thunder applauded the tailor who remembered every past but finally measured himself into tomorrow.<words>452</words>
