Dust spiraled like timid ghosts around the blunt heretic as he prised open the temple's iron doors. <words>17</words>
Beyond lay a forgotten library, its shelves sagging beneath scrolls that once inhaled incense and prophecy. <words>33</words>
He had come at the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears, heart drumming with anxious elation. <words>50</words>
Old promises, half-heard in childhood nightmares, pulled him forward more tightly than any dogma he renounced. <words>66</words>
He was enthusiastically cautious, grinning at danger yet cataloging every crack beneath his hurried footsteps. <words>81</words>
Under his arm nestled a worn-out teddy bear, its button eye dangling by a single stubborn thread. <words>98</words>
The bear had belonged to the sister who taught him first to argue with gods and accountants alike. <words>116</words>
Now it served as relic, compass, and reminder that the battle he sought was waged inside words. <words>133</words>
He approached the lectern where an outdated stock ticker sat amid cobwebs, its glass face clotted with grime. <words>151</words>
Instead of equities, the ribbon printed jumbled codes whose erratic pulses were rumored to form the mind’s autobiography. <words>169</words>
Somewhere beneath those staticy symbols, he believed, nested the omniscient intelligence that mocked every mortal calculation. <words>185</words>
To match wits with an omniscient mind, he had vowed to decode the stream or perish unremarked. <words>202</words>
He fed the ticker a strip of parchment scrawled with heretical algebra, each variable an insult to certainty. <words>220</words>
Gears chirred, and the machine spat back numerals slashed by crooked arrows, a broken language begging for answers. <words>238</words>
He aligned the strip beside the puzzle piece just discovered beneath the bear’s patched belly, comparing jagged edges. <words>256</words>
Fit proved perfect, and a low wind seemed to applaud through shattered stained glass overhead. <words>271</words>
Then letters on the shelves rearranged themselves, spines shuffling like soldiers changing formation after whistle. <words>286</words>
Sentences formed: 'KEEP YOUR PROMISES OR BURN IN FORGETFULNESS,' an ultimatum as intimate as a lullaby. <words>302</words>
The heretic laughed, a bark stripped of reverence, and whispered the counterspell sewn into his sister’s toy. <words>319</words>
Thread unraveled, revealing a second strip, and the ticker swallowed it greedily as thunder rolled beneath the floor. <words>337</words>
Glyphs flared sapphire, then softened into clear text describing a secret corridor toward the library’s beating heart. <words>354</words>
He advanced, every limb trembling with enthusiastically cautious hope, for now the battle was no longer metaphorical. <words>371</words>
Stone jaws slid aside, uncovering a chamber where quills wrote autonomously on endless parchment, mapping futures yet unborn. <words>389</words>
In the center hovered a mirror of liquid code, reflecting his doubts, triumphs, and the childhood promise he’d betrayed. <words>408</words>
Facing it, he felt the omniscient mind lean forward, curious, ready to gamble omnipotence against ragged humanity. <words>425</words>
The heretic raised the teddy bear like a banner, spoke his sister’s name, and stepped into the shimmering calculus. <words>444</words>
Anxious elation detonated into quiet certainty as the chamber sealed, commencing the duel that would rewrite both souls. <words>462</words>
