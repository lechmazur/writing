Mardin, the grumpy crypt caretaker, begrudgingly climbed the spiral stairs into the witch's crystal scrying room.<words>16</words>
He preferred damp marble to shimmering quartz, yet the stars demanded attendance tonight.<words>29</words>
Throughout stargazing, the witch insisted, their instruments heard whispers impossible at ground level.<words>42</words>
Mardin carried an unmarked cardboard tube under one arm, its anonymous brown somehow more secretive than ebony coffins.<words>60</words>
The tube contained a rolled sand mandala, created earlier that dusk by apprentice monks with trembling devotion.<words>77</words>
Granules of sapphire, carnelian, and bone ash still clung together in multiply singular constellations.<words>91</words>
Only Mardin knew the mandala's true purpose: to channel accumulated trauma into cosmic silence.<words>105</words>
The importance of trauma, he muttered, lies in what it can transmute, not what it forever scars.<words>122</words>
The witch appeared behind a curtain of dangling geodes, her voice a grandiose subtlety slipping between candle breaths.<words>140</words>
We must quell an uprising within, she said, pointing toward Mardin's chest rather than any distant kingdom.<words>157</words>
For years he had jiggled away feelings like dust shaken off a burial shroud, yet disquiet rumbled louder daily.<words>176</words>
Now the stars themselves threatened revolt unless his inner crypt unlocked and listened.<words>189</words>
They arranged the mandala upon the crystal floor, patterns of sand mirroring constellations glittering through the domed skylight.<words>207</words>
The witch instructed him to trace each loop with the cardboard tube, letting grains fall and multiply across emptiness.<words>226</words>
As he circled, memories broke open--mother's last cough, a comrade's scream, the echoing clank of gates locking behind refugees.<words>245</words>
Each recollection landed as colored sand, jarring the design yet completing a vaster image unseen at ground view.<words>263</words>
Through the patterns in a sand mandala, the witch reminded him, the universe writes commentary on our broken margins.<words>282</words>
Mardin felt the uprising within assemble, knights of regret lining ribcage battlements, banners woven from regrets he never voiced.<words>301</words>
Instead of defending, he bowed, and the armored memories jiggled their lances, surprised by surrender.<words>316</words>
Star-light struck the mandala, refracting through fallen tears into prismatic specters that drifted upward like freed prayers.<words>333</words>
The witch gathered the last swirling glow into the cardboard tube and sealed it with soft wax.<words>350</words>
Keep it close, she said, for trauma once faced becomes a torch, but once forgotten returns as wildfire.<words>368</words>
Mardin descended the spiral once more, yet each step sounded lighter, as though someone else carried his decades.<words>386</words>
He realized the crypts below would still be dark, but he no longer needed to multiply singular silence.<words>404</words>
Instead he would jiggle the rusty sconces awake, spill new brightness across tombstone names, and share the stories they hoarded.<words>424</words>
Above, the witch watched through her crystals, noting how even sand can teach the stars humility.<words>440</words>
Some nights demand fireworks, she whispered, but the grandest revolutions bloom in subtle spirals that no tyrant hears.<words>458</words>
