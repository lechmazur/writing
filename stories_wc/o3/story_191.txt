Kai Whitlock, a sober cardsharp with fingers like metronomes, arrived on the mist-covered island just as dawn dimmed. <words>18</words>
He carried only an antique ink well, corked and sloshing faintly, a relic he trusted more than pistols. <words>36</words>
Coffee cooled in an abandoned mug atop a jetty post, marking the island’s heartbeat like a ticking metronome. <words>54</words>
At that precise moment, Kai knew the timeframe for daring the unimaginable had commenced. <words>68</words>
His client’s hushed pleas drifted from the wireless radio he wore, urging him to hasten toward the island’s shrouded manor. <words>88</words>
Their tone was boisterously quiet, paradoxically roaring through static yet whispered enough to escape the surrounding gulls. <words>105</words>
Kai felt grudging admiration for voices brave enough to tremble. <words>115</words>
Still, admiration never shuffled the deck or placed chips; his method required colder arithmetic. <words>129</words>
For weeks at sea he had prepared by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers’ dreams, tracing silhouettes back to their secret motives. <words>150</words>
Every dream featured the same ink well, bleeding symbols onto velvet tables, insisting destiny would bet against loaded odds tonight. <words>170</words>
Now, as swirling mist swallowed rocky paths, he followed those symbols, letting them deal the route like invisible croupiers. <words>189</words>
The manor emerged, its windows blank as discarded cards, yet candlelight flickered behind curtains embroidered with broken spades. <words>207</words>
Inside, dreamers lay unconscious in dusty armchairs, each clutching a playing card soaked in ink and seawater. <words>224</words>
Their murmurs formed more hushed pleas, begging the ink to rewrite fates before the coffee outside chilled beyond redemption. <words>243</words>
Kai uncorked the antique ink well and dipped a knuckle, feeling currents of mathematics, probability, and raw dread swirl together. <words>263</words>
He began to mark fresh deals onto the oak floor, every stroke a counterbet against whatever nightmare held these people hostage. <words>284</words>
With each sigil, the sleepers exhaled, the boisterously quiet radio now silent, as though the cards themselves accepted surrender. <words>303</words>
Yet one voice remained, neither asleep nor awake: the island itself, groaning through beams and soil, demanding its impossible wager. <words>323</words>
Kai, compelled to dare the unimaginable, placed the mug of cooling coffee at the doorway, anteing time against land. <words>342</words>
Steam dwindled; simultaneously, the mansion’s foundations drew a breath, testing the bet as any seasoned gambler would. <words>359</words>
When silence finally held, the mist parted over moonlit surf, and Kai felt the island grant grudging admiration for his nerve. <words>380</words>
He pocketed the ink well, leaving freed dreamers and an emptied mug behind, and hastened toward whatever horizon still required dealing. <words>401</words>
