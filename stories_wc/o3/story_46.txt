Hush soaked the orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls, but the metronomic clack of keys announced that piano practice had begun.<words>22</words>
At the mossy bench sat the blank-faced performer, expressionless mask reflecting spray, fingers searching for melody with surgical, precise madness.<words>42</words>
No audience filled the fern aisles except a diminutive figure who called herself the guardian of rumors.<words>59</words>
She wore nothing remarkable beyond a plain plastic ring that winked like cheap starlight whenever the keys struck dissonance.<words>78</words>
Rumors, she whispered, ripened here as fruit, and she had come to approve which ones fell into waking ears.<words>97</words>
The performer's uniquely typical posture—a straight spine neither rigid nor lax—confused the ferns, which bowed as though to both royalty and scarecrow.<words>119</words>
He paused on a suspended chord, feeling that language of dreams vibrating behind the notes, yet lacking the syntax to unlock it.<words>141</words>
Teach me, his untouched face begged, though his lips never moved.<words>152</words>
The guardian answered not with speech but by tracking moon paths in the pools gathered among the fern roots.<words>171</words>
She dipped the plastic ring into the silver reflection, drawing circles that slid across the ripples like itinerant constellations.<words>190</words>
Each orbit corresponded to a rumor—some tender, some venomous—and her choreography steered them toward the performer’s waiting mind.<words>208</words>
He resumed playing, and the orchard shuddered with harmonies carrying whispered lies about distant kings and forgotten rebellions.<words>226</words>
Yet amid the swirl he sensed a single true dream, pulsing like a heart beneath counterfeit wings.<words>243</words>
He modulated to minor seventh intervals, hoping to isolate that pulse, but rumors kept interjecting, thieving resonance from intention.<words>262</words>
Frustrated, he slammed the final chord, and waterfalls gasped, exposing a hidden moon shard lodged in mossy stone.<words>280</words>
The guardian nodded; the performer understood: to learn the language of dreams, he must map not rumors but their shadows along moonlit vectors.<words>303</words>
He lifted the shard with careful madness, held it against the ring’s cheap circle, and saw that extravagant truths require embarrassingly humble frames.<words>326</words>
Breathless, the ferns straightened, waterfalls resumed their veil, and the guardian of rumors stepped back, satisfied that she had approved the proper silence.<words>349</words>
Now the performer played again, notes aligning with the shard’s glimmer, and every chord translated a new moon path into unspeakable clarity.<words>371</words>
Dreams, once inaudible, gathered like fireflies above the orchard, spelling wild alphabets the uniquely typical musician read without changing his unreadable face.<words>393</words>
When dawn threatened, the guardian vanished, the plastic ring sank into ripples, and rumors dispersed, but the language remained carved in flowing air.<words>416</words>
Under the final echo, the performer closed the piano lid, turned his blank canvas of a face to the sky, and silently thanked precise madness for its guidance.<words>444</words>
