Permit me, dear auditor, to recount the misadventure of Prandell Vex, traveling salesman of oddities and self‑styled cosmopolitan prophet. <words>19</words>
He arrived, of course, in the silent abyss, that tasteful vacancy between forgotten galaxies where echoes politely refuse to linger. <words>39</words>
His ship hung crooked, awaiting throughout repairs by sluggish nanites who whistled nothing, compelling him to seek provisional business. <words>58</words>
With rationally whimsical confidence, Prandell unpacked wares onto dark matter dust, polishing each label until it shone like forced humility. <words>78</words>
The centerpiece was a rustic water pitcher whose clay remembered rivers older than stars yet somehow leaked upward. <words>96</words>
Potential customers included luminous void‑fish, a remorseful comet, and three syllables of a dead language bargaining jointly. <words>113</words>
Yet Prandell's true aim, hidden beneath his satin grin, was to learn the true meaning of interconnectedness. <words>130</words>
He believed the secret resided in tracking how desire passed hand to tentacle to syntax, so he resolved to quantify it. <words>151</words>
Naturally, one quantifies cosmic longing with the rhythm of a pendulum, because spreadsheets would appear tragically literal. <words>168</words>
He suspended the rustic water pitcher from a gold filament, letting it tick yes‑no across imaginary coordinates of appetite. <words>187</words>
Each swing sloshed ancient river memory into weightless droplets, which spelled provisional prices in fluent irony before dissolving. <words>205</words>
The void‑fish declined, citing liquidity issues, while the comet haggled until its tail knotted itself out of embarrassment. <words>223</words>
Unexpectedly, the dead language whispered an offer composed of syllables previously extinct, purchasing not the pitcher but the act of measuring desires. <words>245</words>
Prandell, delighted with mocking sincerity, bowed so deeply that sarcasm itself cracked like thin ice on interstellar spring. <words>263</words>
Yet the moment the contract was uttered, the pitcher and pendulum froze, demonstrating the peril of commodifying vanishing arts. <words>282</words>
For vanishing arts, by definition, resent being located, let alone invoiced, and prefer to disappear mid‑signature. <words>298</words>
The abyss swallowed the measuring apparatus, the buyers, and even the nanites, whose repairs stopped exactly halfway, leaving half a hull. <words>319</words>
Only Prandell remained, floating beside unfinished panels, suddenly sensing threads connecting emptiness, contracts, and leaky clay in suggestive equilibrium. <words>338</words>
He realized interconnectedness was merely the moment before separation, the suspenseful inhale preceding every vanishing, every sale, every repair. <words>357</words>
So, with a merchant's shrug and philosopher's wink, he restarted his ledger at zero and hailed the next abyssal station. <words>377</words>
The half‑finished hull rang like a broken bell behind him, tolling hypothetical profits never to be itemized. <words>394</words>
He listened, laughed, and logged the melody under assets intangible. <words>404</words>
