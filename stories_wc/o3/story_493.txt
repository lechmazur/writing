Sir Galen, a prudent knight of no known line, rode the tramline that wound along the sea cliffs toward Knossos Renovata during the orange hush of the evening commute.<words>29</words>
Though plate armor clinked beneath a plain cloak, his gait was mysteriously cheerful, as if anticipating jokes only the obsidian dusk and ancient stones could tell.<words>55</words>
He had boarded with a single possession: a loose binder ring threaded through rolled, secondhand letters bought in shadowed stalls that lined the harbor concourse.<words>80</words>
Scholars dismissed the letters as sailors' gossip, but Galen suspected guarded secrets were etched into them, masked by salt stains and sentimental farewells.<words>103</words>
His motivation, fierce as a lighthouse flame, was to trace an unknown ancestry whispered by dying nuns who had raised him beyond the northern reefs.<words>128</words>
They'd told him that blood older than kingdoms pulsed in his wrists, and that understanding would arrive only through patterns most travelers ignored.<words>151</words>
So every bump of the tram, every advertisement flicker, every muttered complaint of clerks returning home, he measured against the looping ink of the letters.<words>176</words>
Via cryptic patterns in secondhand letters, he meant to understand where his mother had stepped inside the labyrinthine palace now repurposed as a corporate archive.<words>201</words>
Knossos Renovata rose ahead, columns lit with commuters' holo-ads, yet age seeped from its frescoed lions like forgotten incense twined with new electric hums.<words>225</words>
Galen disembarked and followed streaming suits through bronze doors, but paused at a cracked tile showing dolphins arranged in the same spiral as the binder ring.<words>251</words>
Sudden certainty, familiar yet unknown, told him the ring was never meant for paper but for a keyhole hidden where palace drains met sacrificial channels.<words>276</words>
He detached it, knelt, and fitted it between marble seams; gears rasped, commuters hurried past oblivious, and a lamplit stairwell unfurled downward like a metal scroll.<words>302</words>
Below, chambers glimmered with primordial circuitry fused to frescoes, and there he found walls carved with the same letters in older tongues, affirming kinship to architect-priests.<words>328</words>
The revelation did not roar; it settled with the quiet authority of dawn, and he laughed, mysteriously cheerful because the guarded secrets had allowed themselves to be heard.<words>356</words>
He ascended again before the final commuter bell, armor still shiny, knowledge blooming behind his eyes like torchlight, prepared to spend the rest of life lighting other corridors.<words>384</words>
Tracing his unknown ancestry had begun as a quest for a name, yet it ended birthing a purpose: to guard the palace even as it guarded him.<words>411</words>
On the returning tram, moonlight silvered the binder ring now hanging from his gauntlet, and each passenger felt, without understanding, that something ancient had taken a kindly seat among them.<words>441</words>
