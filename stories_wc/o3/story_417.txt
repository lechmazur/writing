Vines clutched the crumbling veranda as Professor Elowen Mull, an unhinged zealot of botanical theology, paced the Victorian parlor in a jungle during studying.<words>24</words>
Her students scribbled nervously, sensing that every quiver of her umbrella could uproot their lecture notes and perhaps their sanity.<words>44</words>
The absurdity felt earnest, like a theoretically playful sermon delivered by a thunderstorm that forgot it was meant to be menacing.<words>65</words>
On the mantelpiece, beside colonial taxidermy parrots, glimmered a plain metal bottle cap she worshipped more devoutly than any relic.<words>85</words>
It was the final remnant of an expedition crew whose unspoken agreements had kept them alive until the jungle swallowed their bodies.<words>107</words>
Elowen believed the cap held every promise never articulated, every vow too fragile for daylight, and therefore every ounce of human power.<words>129</words>
Yet power, she insisted, is strongest when trembling, and she arranged tonight’s lesson to find strength in vulnerability.<words>147</words>
First she extinguished the kerosene lamps, plunging the parlor into a dark room throbbing with cricket song and unseen orchids.<words>167</words>
Then, amid the hush, she offered a whispered confession in a dark room, though everyone stood beside her, eyes wide.<words>187</words>
She admitted she had never opened the cap, fearing its silence would rupture the mystical unspoken agreements she projected onto it.<words>208</words>
The students felt the confession wrap around them like humidity, sticky, unavoidable, and suddenly their private shames rustled louder than the jungle.<words>230</words>
Without being told, each slipped a secret into the air—tears, stammers, micro‑gestures—and the room brightened with invisible bonds.<words>248</words>
Those bonds were the actual curriculum, an unspoken syllabus impossible to grade yet impossible to forget.<words>264</words>
Elowen, trembling as promised, placed the cap between them like a coin at a séance, begging the jungle to witness their shared living.<words>287</words>
Outside, root systems groaned, and a strangler fig seemed to uproot itself slightly, leaning toward the veranda as though eager for seminar credit.<words>310</words>
Theoretically playful lightning flickered, painting Victorian wainscoting with jungle silhouettes, reminding everyone that sincerity can wear clown shoes without tripping.<words>330</words>
In that phosphorescent pause, the unhinged zealot smiled softly, because earnest absurdity had finally become both microscope and sanctuary.<words>349</words>
She lifted the cap, felt nothing explode, and realized vulnerability was not a void but an aperture, quietly shimmering with shared bravery.<words>371</words>
The jungle exhaled, the parrots nodded, and the students closed their notebooks, carrying out new unspoken agreements they would honor forever.<words>392</words>
Some objects are plain, some rooms are dark, but a single earnest moment can illuminate every root entwined beneath polite parlor floors.<words>414</words>
