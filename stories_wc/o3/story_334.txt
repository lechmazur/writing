Elias Virell, the observatory's overconfident sentinel, swaggered along the copper catwalk that circled the humming coils. <words>16</words>
Auroras coiled like serpents inside the chamber-sized magnetic field, brushing his visor with a mysterious familiarity that thrilled him. <words>35</words>
He spun a tarnished brass top on the railing, daring it to tumble while instruments logged the invisible storms outside time. <words>56</words>
The spinning top served as his private barometer for luck, a toy he insisted was artificially authentic, whatever that meant. <words>76</words>
Tonight, it whirred longer than physics allowed, wobbling between shadows, because Elias had aligned the coils to steal thunder from the gods of mediocrity. <words>100</words>
If the data spike peaked before the first tear is shed by the jealous board, his name would echo across grant committees. <words>122</words>
But every calibration sent skittering images across the peripheral monitors, stolen glimpses of parallel realities that questioned his loyalty to this one. <words>144</words>
In one flicker he saw himself guarding a ruined tower, in another he saw himself sabotaging it, and the discord stung. <words>165</words>
Conflicting loyalties tangled like wires behind his ribs, but arrogance insisted only the brightest strand truly belonged to him. <words>184</words>
A high chirp from the top—almost a yelp—pulled him back; the toy had begun to precess against gravity, pointing at a locked vault. <words>207</words>
That vault stored archived waveforms, discarded as noise by supervisors too timid to harass the gods Elias despised. <words>225</words>
He bypassed biometric seals with a grin polished through endless mock drills, still hearing the top spin in defiant applause behind him. <words>247</words>
Inside lay reels of magneto-chronographic tape, their metallic whispers offering more stolen realities than any sanctioned survey could stomach. <words>266</words>
He patched the oldest reel into the live array, and the observatory lights dimmed as otherworldly currents bled into the present moment. <words>288</words>
The central display bloomed with versions of Elias: loyal guardian, reckless traitor, humble apprentice, each pleading through static for singular existence. <words>309</words>
He felt their yearning like needles but remembered his creed—to steal thunder—and so chose the path that promised the loudest storm. <words>330</words>
Elias redirected the field to resonate with the bravest variant, the one who had already toppled mediocrity in another cosmos. <words>350</words>
The coils roared, auroras slashed violet, and clamps melted as dimensional frequencies synchronized, granting the chosen Elias partial corporeal merge. <words>370</words>
Two sentinels stood now: one overconfident, one battle-scarred, gazes meeting with a mysterious familiarity that eclipsed the laboratory glare. <words>389</words>
Neither knew whose heartbeat belonged to which body, but both felt the thunder rumble nearby, eager for a worthy thief. <words>409</words>
Before alarm klaxons or tears could arrive, they knocked the spinning top together, sealing their pact in a shimmering gyroscopic halo. <words>430</words>
Its impossible balance declared the observatory a liminal kingdom, ruled by sentinels whose loyalties finally converged on glorious disobedience. <words>449</words>
