Scoria Finn, the outlaw cowboy poet, lounged beneath the brass ribs of the steampunk observatory dome, scribbling verses against the hum of cogwork planets.<words>24</words>
He carried worn runic bone dice in his breast pocket, heirlooms that clicked like haunted metronomes whenever destiny inhaled.<words>43</words>
Such inhalations arrived hourly throughout rehearsals for the Astronomers' Sonata, the dome's civic pageant blending music, gears, and uncertain cosmology.<words>63</words>
Scoria's role was merely to recite an overture, yet his virtually peculiar cadence kept stretching measures until musicians misalign with themselves.<words>84</words>
Their complaints painted the conductor's mustache silver with stress, which delighted Scoria, because friction could spark unstoppable curiosity in any watching heart.<words>106</words>
He wanted that flash to leap across the city like wildfire, burning complacency while leaving bewildered wonder alive and green.<words>126</words>
But ignition required timing, so he consulted the coffee shop walls that keep changing text along the observatory's mezzanine.<words>145</words>
Steam-heated bricks rewrote themselves whenever one blinked, offering cryptic stage directions in looping cursive caffeine stains.<words>161</words>
Today the graffiti declared, 'Cast dice at midnight, follow the fracture, trust the orbit of intertwined destinies.'<words>178</words>
Scoria chuckled at the wall’s saturated ambivalence, equal parts omen and prank, and accepted the dare with a gambler’s nod.<words>198</words>
When the clockwork moon above the dome struck twelve, he rolled the runic bone dice across the brass stage floor.<words>218</words>
They rattled, sparked, and settled showing the stanza for chaos: an ancient rune meaning shift of scope, another meaning collide, another blank.<words>240</words>
At that exact beat, the ceiling gears misalign, jamming the planetarium’s orbit and unveiling a hidden aperture pointed at an unnamed star.<words>262</words>
The musicians froze, their instruments whining like confused owls, while spectators gasped, their curiosity crashing through them in electric tides.<words>282</words>
A beam from that alien jewel struck Scoria’s journal, igniting words he had not yet penned, verses spelling futures of everyone present.<words>304</words>
Each verse braided a life to another, proving the wall's prophecy that destinies hereafter would travel in pairs, trios, improbable constellations.<words>325</words>
Some found lovers they had loathed, some rivals they would soon rescue, some purposes they feared to desire; awe and dread cohabited.<words>347</words>
Witnessing the cascade, Scoria felt neither triumph nor regret, only the same saturated ambivalence that glittered upon the walls’ restless sentences.<words>368</words>
Curiosity, once sparked, could not be unlit, and he watched it spread like wildfire yet tasted the smoke of unintended consequence.<words>389</words>
Still he tipped his hat to the jammed machinery, recognizing that misalignment is merely music in a key we do not yet hum.<words>412</words>
He pocketed the dice, stepped into the newly opened aperture, and rode a ladder of starlight toward the next rehearsal beyond night.<words>434</words>
Below, the dome’s crowd erupted into overlapping songs, each voice testing its fresh fate, while the coffee shop walls revised the epilogue in steam.<words>458</words>
They wrote, 'Curiosity is a wildfire, but some wildfires reveal stars,' and then the letters dissolved, leaving only a smell of roasted questions.<words>481</words>
And so the outlaw cowboy poet kept riding, pursued by possibilities he had authored yet could never again contain.<words>500</words>
