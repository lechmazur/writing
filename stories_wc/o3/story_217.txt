Mallory slipped through the cracked gates of Hearthwick Carnival, where every breeze carried an almost melodic sigh of ghosts.<words>19</words>
She was the underestimated rebel of her small town, rumored to challenge curses for the thrill of disproving them.<words>38</words>
Tonight, however, her motive was softer: to prime a stagnant heart for wonder—specifically, her own.<words>53</words>
An ephemeral gloom hung over the midway, faint lights flickering like memories determined to be forgotten.<words>69</words>
From her pocket she drew her grandfather's pocket knife with multiple blades, each polished into a crescent of borrowed moonlight.<words>89</words>
He had taught her the art of adaptation, saying tools were just stories that learned to cut paths.<words>107</words>
She flipped the smallest blade open as she approached the Haunted House, its façade grinning with chipped paint and spite.<words>127</words>
The first ring of a call that changes fate erupted from her phone, vibrating against her ribs like a warning.<words>147</words>
Caller ID read simply 'Unknown Chef,' a contact she created months ago after a midnight argument about dumpling folding.<words>166</words>
Their shared love for Northern-style dumplings had once held her and Jonah together the way dough seals mystery meat.<words>185</words>
She let the phone ring again, every vibration seeming to intensify the sorrowful pulse inside the walls.<words>202</words>
Answering would mean abandoning her solo dare, yet missing it could slice the final thread between them.<words>219</words>
The door creaked open of its own accord, exhaling a cooler draft that smelled faintly of soy, garlic, and regret.<words>239</words>
Mallory laughed, a sadly joyful sound that startled even herself, and stepped inside the dim corridor of wobbling mirrors.<words>258</words>
Reflections split her into armies of rebels, every copy whispering doubts about loyalty, love, and the unpaid electric bill.<words>277</words>
She chose one reflection and spoke aloud, 'Adapt or haunt, that's the bargain,' then pocketed the knife before it could decide.<words>298</words>
A mannequin dressed as a ringmaster lurched forward, animatronic gears grinding like teeth, yet she merely bowed in return.<words>317</words>
Respect sometimes disarms even programmed hostility—a principle learned from dumpling diplomacy with Jonah's stubborn grandmother.<words>332</words>
The phone rang a third time, echoing through speakers now, as though the house itself demanded she answer.<words>350</words>
She pressed accept, and Jonah's voice, trembling yet hopeful, asked if she still believed dough could teach courage.<words>368</words>
Mallory walked deeper, speaking softly of wrappers that seal steam, of rebels that choose tenderness, of ghosts craving seasoning.<words>387</words>
With every whispered recipe they shared, the walls mellowed, lights warmed, and her heartbeat located a rhythm beyond fear.<words>406</words>
Somewhere between garlic and ginger, the stagnant heart she carried began to flutter, not unlike a carousel restarting.<words>424</words>
The mannequin ringmaster tipped its hat, releasing a confetti of ticket stubs that spelled in dust, 'GO HOME, BEGIN.'<words>443</words>
Mallory exited into the thinning night, sadly joyful yet undeniably altered, pocket knife resting quiet as a folded dumpling.<words>462</words>
The call ended without farewell, but the silence that followed felt like dough rising, endlessly adaptable to tomorrow.<words>480</words>
