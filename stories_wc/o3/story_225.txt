Rust peeled from the brass ribs of the observation deck, yet wonder lingered. <words>13</words>
A battered marvel indeed, the steampunk submarine Orpheline drifted beneath disputed seas. <words>25</words>
Between broken treaties overhead, captain and crew hid their flagless hull in silt clouds. <words>39</words>
Among them wandered Calliope Vane, wayward apothecary and reluctant stowaway. <words>49</words>
She had signed aboard only to track the migratory butterflies rumored below waves. <words>62</words>
These luminous insects, fluttering in pressurized domes, foretold currents of war and peace. <words>75</words>
Calliope’s instruments were delicate, but her most important tool was bizarrely humble. <words>87</words>
A dry highlighter pen, long drained of ink, served as her cipher stylus. <words>100</words>
With it she scored dents on copper pipes, tapping Morse code across corridors. <words>113</words>
The vibrations travelled like whale-song, carrying messages she preferred never to speak aloud. <words>126</words>
For Calliope wished to infect hearts, not lungs, with precisely brewed mischief. <words>138</words>
Her mixtures corrected injustice by tilting balances toward an unjustly fair equilibrium. <words>150</words>
Such alchemy unnerved the military patrons who once exiled her from surface labs. <words>163</words>
Deep under salt, she believed treaties might mend if butterflies found proper routes. <words>176</words>
One night, crimson sparks burst beyond the domes, silhouettes of iron frigates clashing. <words>189</words>
The deck shuddered, and brass periscopes snapped shut like offended swans. <words>200</words>
Amid alarm bells, Calliope spotted violet wings flickering against a viewport’s frost. <words>212</words>
A rare queen butterfly, messenger of ceasefire, was trapped by pressure differentials. <words>224</words>
Freeing it meant flooding the observation deck, a choice akin to mutiny. <words>236</words>
Yet something else fluttered in Calliope’s ribcage, an unconventional love for the vessel’s architect. <words>250</words>
Arjun Brass, stoic engineer, had welded poetry into every gear she touched. <words>262</words>
He stood now at the bulkhead, torn between mission orders and her glinting plea. <words>276</words>
Calliope tapped her dry pen twice, thrice, then seven times: SAVE THE QUEEN. <words>289</words>
Arjun understood; Morse had become their secret courtship, dangerous as collapsing rivets. <words>301</words>
He rerouted boilers, equalizing chambers until a hatch could open like a sigh. <words>314</words>
Water hissed in, cold and dazzling, carrying the queen butterfly to freedom. <words>326</words>
Immediately, diplomatic gunfire outside softened, as if commanders sensed the fragile envoy rise. <words>339</words>
But Orpheline now leaked hope and seawater in equal, perilous measure. <words>350</words>
Crewmen cursed, scrambling to patch plates while currents howled like iron wolves. <words>362</words>
Calliope offered vials of foam resin, concocted from coral ash and regret. <words>374</words>
Arjun smeared the mixture, marveling as fissures sealed with an unjustly fair glow. <words>387</words>
The submarine stabilized, though engines groaned like veterans recounting battles they never won. <words>400</words>
Exhausted, Calliope collapsed beside Arjun, their shoulders brushing in accidental confession. <words>411</words>
Outside, tracer flares spelled in halting Morse: PARLEY GRANTED, FOLLOW BUTTERFLIES NORTH. <words>423</words>
Unconventional love, it seemed, could infect whole navies through the wings of one insect. <words>437</words>
Calliope lifted her empty highlighter like a scepter, and Arjun bowed laughing. <words>449</words>
Between broken treaties, they had written a brighter accord on the ocean’s rusted parchment. <words>463</words>
