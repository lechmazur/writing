I set up my collapsible booth between broken cuckoo clocks, announcing in a half‑shrug that I repaired memories during yard sales.<words>21</words>
The customers never knew that the service was sorcery, and that I, Orpheus Finch, was a remorseful conjurer on probation from his own conscience.<words>45</words>
Each Saturday, coins clinked with an indifferent enthusiasm that matched my voice, as if commerce itself yawned yet kept clapping.<words>65</words>
But today the greenhouse behind the booth gurgled, because the orchard it sheltered had sunk after last month's tide, and the shipwrecks encircling it creaked like curious judges.<words>93</words>
In that waterlogged ruin I had hidden my last tool, a single knitting needle carved from lightning‑struck applewood.<words>111</words>
The needle served as a wand too humble to tempt me into grandiose spells, yet sharp enough to stitch regret into lace.<words>133</words>
I needed it now because a boy with seawater eyes had bargained for shared wisdom, offering only a cracked jar of orchard brine.<words>156</words>
His request was obviously mysterious, yet sounded routine: teach me, he said, to rediscover the wild frontier of your mind, not mine.<words>178</words>
I agreed, intending merely to dampen the ache in my skull by performing a minor mnemonic drizzle, nothing frontier‑sized.<words>197</words>
We waded into the greenhouse, past pears floating like lanterns and bees using periscopes of reed, until the needle hummed.<words>217</words>
To calibrate the spell, I retrieved an antique microscope rusting atop a drowned workbench and polished its eyepiece with orchid moss.<words>238</words>
The boy placed his fingertips on the slide, and I matched the swirl of fingerprints on the antique microscope with the grooves on the knitting needle.<words>264</words>
Pattern aligned with pattern, producing a soft chime that traveled through the orchard like rain taught to play glass bells.<words>284</words>
Memories leapt from both of us and hovered as translucent stallions, then merged into a single beast wearing two riders of light.<words>306</words>
I felt the frontier crack open, untamed and glittering, yet my remorse galloped faster, reminding me why I had promised never to guide another mind.<words>331</words>
If I left the boy astride that beast, his psyche would wander among whirlpools of wrecked sailors' dreams, mistaking them for meadows.<words>353</words>
So I steadied the needle, whispered the orchard's oldest root‑riddle, and split the stallion back into two foals of shimmering dust.<words>374</words>
The boy collapsed, blinking, holding more questions than answers, yet smiling because some invisible weight had lifted with the tide.<words>394</words>
I kept the cracked brine jar, payment enough for my minimal heroism, and felt the ache in my skull pleasantly raw, like windburn.<words>417</words>
Throughout the coming yard sales, I resolved to speak freer, neither hawking nor hiding, until the greenhouse rose again and the frontier inside me needed no map.<words>444</words>
