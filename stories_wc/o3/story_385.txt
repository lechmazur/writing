The quiet ward glowed faintly during the shift before sunrise, humming like a half-remembered lullaby. <words>15</words>
Nurse Maren, a pleasant meddler by reputation and openly manipulative by practice, drifted between beds. <words>30</words>
She smiled so warmly that patients mistook her schemes for kindness, which suited her secret agenda. <words>46</words>
Maren sought to decode ancient symbols stitched into the bandages of a comatose wanderer rescued from the shore. <words>64</words>
The symbols, inked in salt and blood, rearranged themselves whenever someone blinked, as if enjoying the attention. <words>81</words>
Lucid confusion filled Maren's mind; she understood nothing yet felt certain she nearly understood everything. <words>96</words>
She fetched her lucky object from the supply closet: a pair of rusted ice skates wrapped in gauze. <words>114</words>
Their blades, corroded into hieroglyphic serrations, once carved frozen rivers where pilgrims scattered seeds in spiral patterns. <words>131</words>
Maren believed those ancient seeds now sprouted inside the wanderer's dreams, guarding the code she craved. <words>147</words>
To reach them, she needed to weaken the dream’s soil, loosening roots until meanings slipped free. <words>163</words>
She laced the skates to the wanderer's feet, ignoring the monitors' protest beeps and the rust's metallic scent. <words>181</words>
Then she pressed his sole, tracing the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer that only she could see. <words>200</words>
Each invisible step echoed through the corridor like a sighing tide under fluorescent moons. <words>214</words>
Monitors flickered, projecting watery silhouettes against the obsidian skyscraper across the street where administration slept. <words>229</words>
In those dark panes, Maren watched herself become a black-clad cartographer mapping soundless coastlines. <words>243</words>
She whispered suggestions to unconscious patients, pleasantly meddling in their morphine dreams so they murmured lost consonants aloud. <words>261</words>
One syllable landed on the linoleum like a falling seed, sprouting a translucent vine up her ankle. <words>278</words>
She neither screamed nor ran; clarity and bewilderment braided together inside her throat, a rope of glass. <words>295</words>
The symbols on the bandage reorganized once more, now depicting skates gliding over water that refused to freeze. <words>313</words>
Maren understood the warning: continuing would melt every river the pilgrims had ever written upon. <words>328</words>
Yet ambition tasted sweeter than caution, and she was already skating on the patient's slow pulse. <words>344</words>
She coaxed another syllable, then another, until a phrase like breaking ice cascaded through the ward. <words>360</words>
Windows frosted, lights dimmed, and the skyscraper’s reflection shattered, revealing an endless beachfront at night. <words>375</words>
Footprints trailed away into starlit foam, always receding, always inviting, spelling the final cipher between their gaps. <words>392</words>
Maren stepped after them, the rusted blades screeching on tile that had become brittle sand. <words>407</words>
She felt everything weaken behind her, the monitors, the vines, even the distinction between ward and ocean. <words>424</words>
Still she advanced, pleasantly meddling with reality itself, until the footprints stopped and the symbols bloomed open. <words>441</words>
Within that bloom she saw neither prophecy nor reward, only scattered seeds awaiting another manipulative gardener. <words>457</words>
She laughed in lucid confusion, realizing she had decoded a cycle, not an answer. <words>471</words>
Behind her, dawn finally touched the ward, but Maren was already writing fresh enigmas with her rusted skates. <words>489</words>
