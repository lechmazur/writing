<story>
Dusk settled like dust over the abandoned repair bay, seeping through shattered skylights and silent rivets. <words>16</words>
Beyond its yawning doors, the theatre’s backstage glowed faintly; the cast had just taken their final bow. <words>33</words>
That was Jeremiah Flint’s signal to emerge from shadow, for he was the clandestine watchman. <words>48</words>
He guarded endings, ensuring no story closed more tightly than destiny allowed. <words>60</words>
Tonight, his quarry was the notion of curtains themselves, because Jeremiah intended to defy the laws of finality. <words>78</words>
To prepare, he laid an airship captain’s goggles upon a rusted tool bench, lenses glinting like dormant suns. <words>96</words>
The goggles once belonged to Captain Merrow, who taught him wilderness wisdom above the treeline of clouds. <words>113</words>
Merrow had claimed that sky and forest whispered identical riddles, provided the listener stayed analytically free. <words>129</words>
Jeremiah inhaled the metallic dust, noting it bit the lungs with prickly wonder instead of fear. <words>145</words>
From the catwalk above, applause echoed like collapsing drizzle, a reminder that narratives were expected to end. <words>162</words>
Jeremiah refused to acknowledge such expectation in the usual way. <words>172</words>
Instead, he approached a battered briefcase resting beneath the bench, its leather blistered with braille-like bumps. <words>188</words>
Each rise and pit recorded the blueprint of open possibilities, stories purposely left unfinished. <words>202</words>
He slid gloved fingers across them, reading through the braille-like bumps on a battered briefcase as another man might read scripture. <words>223</words>
Tonight’s passage instructed him to fuse stagecraft with skycraft, smashing curtain and horizon into a single seam. <words>240</words>
He lifted the goggles and fastened them over his eyes, their cracked glass refracting backstage lanterns into auroras. <words>258</words>
Circuits hidden in the strap hummed, projecting Merrow’s cartographic ghosts onto the repair bay walls. <words>273</words>
Forests of rigging sprouted leaves of velvet; rafters stretched until they resembled pines anchored by spotlight sap. <words>290</words>
Jeremiah walked the new woodland stage, every footfall erasing a clause of finality from the universe’s contract. <words>307</words>
Yet he sensed narrative gravity tugging, an invisible stagehand keen to drop black cloth across existence. <words>323</words>
He paused, listening the way Merrow had taught—letting wind, plank, and memory convene inside analytic freedom. <words>339</words>
The world whispered a compromise: endings may bend if watchers promise vigilance beyond the bow. <words>354</words>
Jeremiah nodded, acknowledging the bargain without speaking, for the briefcase bumps had foreseen this clause. <words>369</words>
He opened a maintenance hatch in the floor, revealing a shaft of starlight where engine guts once whirred. <words>387</words>
With goggles glimmering, he stepped through, carrying the briefcase like seed for whatever gardens waited between scenes. <words>404</words>
Behind him, the repair bay’s doors swung wide, neither shutting nor staying open, but breathing. <words>419</words>
Applause thinned into wind, blending with forest rustle and prop ropes, blurring stage and wilderness forever. <words>435</words>
Thus the clandestine watchman kept watch, not over endings, but over their miraculous refusal to arrive. <words>451</words>
