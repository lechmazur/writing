After the last star map was drawn, silence dripped over the city like unfinished ink. <words>15</words>
Inside a synthetic biology lab on the drowned waterfront, I awaited the arrival of the vague mystic everybody whispered about. <words>35</words>
They entered wearing a discreetly flamboyant coat stitched from iridescent kelp, smelling faintly of ozone. <words>50</words>
Without introduction, they placed an antique mariner’s compass on my cluttered workstation. <words>62</words>
Its needle spun, trying to override the stable electromagnetic hush generated by the gene printers. <words>77</words>
The mystic spoke in a voice rubbed thin by salt: “We travel tonight toward the next horizon.” <words>94</words>
Their certainty felt like a dare, and my hollow recklessness answered before my reason could object. <words>110</words>
I sealed the lab’s night doors, leaving the cultured embryos glowing unattended. <words>122</words>
Payment, they said, would arrive through polaroids hidden in attics my ancestors abandoned up‑coast. <words>136</words>
I wondered whether photographs could still survive the mold, yet curiosity gnawed harder than doubt. <words>151</words>
We descended through corridors where chimeric lotus roots breathed in glass vats. <words>163</words>
Generators failed behind us, plunging hallways into phosphorescent gloom that the compass devoured. <words>176</words>
Outside, waves hurled moon shards against the dock, as if urging haste. <words>188</words>
The mystic pressed my hands to the compass, whispering family names I had never confessed aloud. <words>204</words>
Each syllable sparked coordinates across its bronze rim, outlining destinations long submerged in myth. <words>218</words>
I realized our voyage aimed not at sky or sea but at memory itself. <words>232</words>
To chronicle family histories, the mystic planned to map bloodlines like archipelagos before erosion erased them. <words>248</words>
The synthetic lab’s forgotten back door coughed open, revealing a skiff inset with circuit veins. <words>263</words>
Bio‑lumens lined the hull, discreetly flamboyant like their owner, refusing yet to call attention. <words>277</words>
We pushed off, and the compass locked to the northwest, though no magnetic north remained after the pole melt. <words>296</words>
Water hissed as engineered plankton sizzled beneath the keel, rewriting our wake in transient green sentences. <words>312</words>
I looked back, expecting alarms, but the lab sank into a blackout as complete as remorse. <words>328</words>
The mystic laughed softly, a sound hollow yet propulsive, like air in emptied lungs. <words>342</words>
“Recklessness merely widens the archive,” they said, fastening silvered film to the mast to catch foggy memories. <words>359</words>
Soon the film shimmered with ghostly portraits: my grandmother mending nets, my cousin swinging a rusted lantern, myself unborn yet present. <words>380</words>
Every captured face tugged the compass toward another invisible shoal where story met flesh. <words>394</words>
I felt the pull override my fear, guiding us toward archives no star map had ever dared to chart. <words>413</words>
Behind us, the last printed constellations peeled from the sky like brittle decals, conceding the job to our uncertain voyage. <words>433</words>
Ahead, only the next horizon glimmered, an unlit page awaiting the ink of our reckless hearts. <words>449</words>
