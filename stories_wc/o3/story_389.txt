When the final calendar page of the year was flipped, the abandoned Ironsmoke Mine exhaled dust like memory.<words>18</words>
No one heard except a thin-lipped warlock who dressed with formally casual indifference, cufflinks glinting inside shattered lamplight.<words>36</words>
He descended the rusted cage elevator, driven by an unwholesome hunger to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite every posted warning.<words>58</words>
Legends said the mine's lowest shaft housed a forgotten library assembled from shipments hijacked during panic-stricken evacuations centuries ago.<words>77</words>
Books lay where ore once glittered, their spines cratered by mildew, yet each volume whispered of lost artifacts yearning to be found.<words>99</words>
Among toppled stacks protruded a charred viking ship figurehead fragment, its dragon maw still baring ebony teeth shaped for northern seas.<words>120</words>
The warlock's pupils constricted, for this splintered relic was rumored to optimize any spell it witnessed, channeling wind, fire, or fear.<words>141</words>
Yet the optimization allegedly occurred only through rumored cures in discredited textbooks shelved between lies about alchemy and homeopathy.<words>160</words>
Scoffing at modern reviewers, he sifted until dust filmed his eyelashes and located Volumen V, 'Therapeutic Misconstructions of Maritime Totems.'<words>180</words>
Its cracked index promised three steps: align fragment to ancestral latitude, bathe it in expired whale oil, speak a stanza from storms.<words>202</words>
He obeyed with methodical grace, balancing ceremony and insouciance, as though signing a contract during a picnic.<words>219</words>
Each action tightened the mine's shadows, yet clarity bloomed in his skull with confusing certainty, like fog backlit by dawn.<words>239</words>
He read the stanza, and the fragment vibrated, spilling green sparks that traced runes across books forbidding them from disintegrating.<words>259</words>
Shelves righted themselves, parchments healed, and indexes rearranged into iron filigree that pointed deeper into the cavernous archive.<words>277</words>
Instead of fleeing, he followed the metallic arrows, mouth twitching at the edges because more pages meant sweeter flesh for his intellect.<words>299</words>
Corridors contracted until he emerged inside a hexagonal vault where calendars from forgotten kingdoms circled a single chair of basalt.<words>319</words>
On that chair rested a mirror fashioned of overlapping library cards, each card naming an artifact humanity had misplaced.<words>338</words>
The warlock saw his reflection multiplying, every duplicate clutching a different treasure: lost crowns, orphaned constellations, unborn operas, and the last syllable ever unsaid.<words>362</words>
Knowledge beckoned like a feast so vast that even eternity would loosen its belt.<words>376</words>
He reached forward, but the figurehead fragment, still tucked under his arm, gnawed suddenly through his coat and embedded in his ribs.<words>398</words>
Pain flared; nevertheless he felt optimized, every nerve scraped clean for data, every doubt pressed flat beneath irreversible insight.<words>417</words>
Books in the vault fluttered their leaves like carnivorous plants, detecting the blood price that unlocked their forbidden paragraphs.<words>436</words>
With confusing certainty he understood the trap: to gorge on fruit eternal was to become fertilizer for further shelves.<words>455</words>
Still he sat upon the basalt throne, breath shallow, thin lips bleeding, muttering index numbers to accelerate the library's relentless bloom around him.<words>478</words>
Outside, the calendar above ground finished its final flip, and the mine mouth sealed itself with a whisper of satisfied pages.<words>499</words>
