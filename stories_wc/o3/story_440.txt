The mural finally gleamed under drone-lamps, the last swipe of pearlescent paint still trembling in the air. <words>17</words>
That was the signal for Jiro, the lovingly detached swordsman, to slip into the recycling center's labyrinth of hissing chutes. <words>37</words>
The place stank of ozone and hopeful failure, a perfect habitat for secret weavers like him. <words>53</words>
They meddle best among discarded dreams, he mused, unsheathing the carbonfold katana that rarely killed and always edited. <words>71</words>
Tonight his target was a shard of sea pottery the size of a thumb, turquoise as lullaby foam. <words>89</words>
It had drifted across centuries and algorithms to land in a street artist's bin beside the mural wall. <words>107</words>
If reassembled with the correct collage scraps, the fragment could consecrate an impossible vow etched in quantum salt. <words>125</words>
Such vows, whispered into material, changed timelines more gently than blades ever could. <words>138</words>
That gentle shift was Jiro's true contract, though the guild paid him only in recycled silence. <words>154</words>
Playfully serious, he bowed to a security camera as if to an impatient emperor, then sliced the feed cord. <words>173</words>
The lights flickered, granting him thirty seconds of titled twilight. <words>183</words>
He rummaged the artist's bin, lifting neon newspaper, foil feathers, and polymer lace left over from urban myths. <words>201</words>
Each scrap still hummed with paint-wet possibility, perfect for meddling. <words>211</words>
He arranged them around the sea pottery like petals around a stolen heart, the katana tip serving as tweezers. <words>230</words>
Outside, drones sprayed sealant over the finished mural, their rotors singing the countdown to full surveillance restoration. <words>247</words>
Within the collage circle, Jiro exhaled the vow he had sworn never to utter aloud: 'May the war forget itself.' <words>267</words>
The sea pottery brightened, absorbing the syllables like a tidal memory returning to shore. <words>281</words>
Scraps fused, forming a miniature window that showed tomorrow's headlines curling into question marks. <words>295</words>
Satisfied, Jiro snapped the window, shattering both glassless pane and prophecy into harmless glitter. <words>309</words>
The vow was now consecrated, impossible and untraceable, hidden in a spray of recyclable stars. <words>324</words>
He let the pieces fall back into the bin, meddled yet mundane, so no curator would ever suspect magic. <words>343</words>
The lights surged on, cameras rebooted, and Jiro sheathed his blade with ceremonious boredom. <words>357</words>
Security bots rolled past him, noting only a man admiring fresh public art. <words>370</words>
He returned the polite glitch of a smile, lovingly detached from praise or consequence. <words>384</words>
Above, the mural shimmered, its colors subtly reorganizing into pacifist geometry no algorithm could flag. <words>399</words>
Jiro walked away, promise kept, forgotten by everyone except tomorrow. <words>409</words>
