In the heartbeat after a dream returns, Brother Keiji opened his eyes to thin alpine dawn. <words>16</words>
The stubborn monk sat alone inside a swaying aerial gondola crossing mountains that glimmered like unfinished prayers. <words>33</words>
He tasted cautious enchantment on the cold steel rails as if the air withheld secrets. <words>48</words>
Keiji's purpose was perilously singular: to outsmart his own dark reflection before dusk claimed the sky. <words>64</words>
That reflection first haunted him in pond water, mimicking every prayer, yet curling its lips into mocking smirks. <words>82</words>
Now he carried the one clue it covetedâ€”a creased shipping label peeled from a crate of forgotten relics. <words>100</words>
The label was visually unappealing, smeared with resin and rain, but its smudged codes mapped yesterday's sins. <words>117</words>
Keiji believed the past could be harvested like tea leaves, brewed to reveal who had plucked them. <words>134</words>
Such harvesting of the past would arm him with knowledge sharp enough to avenge the world against mirrors. <words>152</words>
Yet answers clung to an antique flute nestled in his satchel, its wooden mouthpiece scarred by ancient teeth. <words>170</words>
The shipping label had once been tied to that flute when imperial couriers fled a burning archive. <words>187</words>
Somewhere along flight, somebody bit the instrument, marking time the way wolves notch bones. <words>201</words>
Keiji must read those tooth marks before his shadow self did, lest prophecy chew him instead. <words>217</words>
When the gondola lurched above a ravine, he withdrew the flute and magnifying lens polished with rice paper. <words>235</words>
Tiny crescents of missing wood formed a pattern matching constellations only visible during eclipses of the crimson moon. <words>253</words>
He cross-referenced those stars with monkish chronicles describing a forgotten fortress carved inside the highest peak ahead. <words>270</words>
There, the original biter, a tyrant historian, waited in exile, guarding mirrors that birthed dark doppelgangers. <words>286</words>
Keiji whispered a mantra, steadying his pulse so the gondola's cables would not echo trembling doubt. <words>302</words>
Cautious enchantment thickened as the dream that had returned each night now perched on the railing like fog. <words>320</words>
It showed him his reflection stretching grotesquely upon the gondola glass, eyes hollow, mouth eager to bite flute and monk. <words>340</words>
To outsmart it, Keiji angled the flute so moonlit teeth grooves aligned with the image, turning glass into star chart. <words>360</words>
The reflection staggered, forced to follow the celestial code it had unknowingly engraved centuries prior. <words>375</words>
In that obeying, it revealed the fortress coordinates, glowing upon the shipping label like embers remembering trees. <words>392</words>
Keiji seized the moment, slicing the label into sigils that resealed the mirror surface, imprisoning his dark twin. <words>410</words>
Though vengeance tasted bitter, it freed future pilgrims from reflections that gnaw resolve. <words>423</words>
As the gondola docked before the snow-clad fortress, dawn gilded the flute, and Keiji exhaled, ready to harvest deeper yesterdays. <words>443</words>
