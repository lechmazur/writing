Between commercials, Liora would sneak away from her flickering living room into the corridor of vanished doors.<words>17</words>
She believed the corridor led to a secret society treasure vault whispered about in cracked late-night forums.<words>34</words>
The forums themselves felt peculiarly virtual, as if coded by ghosts who never updated their own regrets.<words>51</words>
Liora, a naive summoner stumbling through adolescence, treated every post as an oracle etched in neon.<words>67</words>
One post insisted that broken marble carries echoing passwords, so she pocketed a piece of a broken statue.<words>85</words>
Its cold curve rested against her palm like the crescent of an unspoken moon.<words>99</words>
She thought the shard would elevate her status at the midnight gatherings where rumors sang louder than truth.<words>117</words>
These rumor-charged midnight gatherings unfolded in the vault's antechamber, lit only by candle stubs and laptop screens.<words>134</words>
Members wore velvet masks stitched with question marks, yet they greeted Liora with distant warmth bordering on mercy.<words>152</words>
They asked what she sought during commercial breaks, and she confessed her desire to hum a lullaby loud enough to be heard by fate.<words>176</words>
Fate, she believed, spoke only when jingles paused and the world inhaled between advertisements.<words>190</words>
The masked curator chuckled, explaining that lullabies sprout like seeds of understanding within stone if serenaded sincerely.<words>207</words>
He guided her to a pedestal where the remainder of the shattered statue waited like a patient ancestor.<words>225</words>
Dust glimmered above it, trembling in rhythms almost musical.<words>234</words>
Liora placed her fragment into the break, and unseen gears clicked as if the vault itself exhaled.<words>251</words>
Guided by trembling hope, she began to hum the lullaby her grandmother once sang to broken clocks.<words>268</words>
Her notes ricocheted against marble, against copper chests, against algorithms hovering like invisible moths.<words>282</words>
Each echo sounded older, wiser, and the vault lights rose as though elevation were a property of melody.<words>300</words>
Within the glowing dust, tiny glyphs sprouted, green and tender, unmistakably the seeds of understanding awakening.<words>316</words>
The curator whispered that once the seeds bloomed, the statue would speak directions to futures not yet downloaded.<words>334</words>
But a statue can only finish its sentence while the world is distracted by cereal jingles, he cautioned.<words>352</words>
So the society waited, ears pressed to silence, counting the seconds until the next glossy advertisement invaded living rooms.<words>371</words>
In that sliver of hush, the statue vibrated, and a single word surfaced: 'elevate.'<words>385</words>
The word flew into Liora’s chest like a warm comet, lifting her naïveté into something gently incandescent.<words>402</words>
When the commercials resumed, she walked home, humming softer now, knowing fate had already heard and nodded.<words>419</words>
