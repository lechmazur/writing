In the hush of a simmering future, the secret agent headquarters lay beneath a cracked plaza where pigeons pecked forgotten crumbs. <words>21</words>
Its corridors, once humming with directives, echoed like a seashell pressed to an ear that no longer trusted what it heard. <words>42</words>
Gregor Ilyich, the insecure advisor to vanished spymaster Dahlia Grey, crept inside, clutching a satchel clattering with outdated clearance badges. <words>62</words>
He had returned to chase a rumor beyond all reason, a rumor whispered only by malfunctioning coffee machines and jittery janitors. <words>83</words>
They said Dahlia kept her mind alive, distilled into a brain in a jar (labeled duplicate) somewhere past the decommissioned war room. <words>105</words>
Gregor’s chest fluttered with dread and hope, a clearly ambiguous rhythm that mimicked Morse code yet spelled nothing decipherable. <words>124</words>
Still, the dreamer's calling tugged him onward, promising salvation if he could merely interpret its unfinished lullaby. <words>141</words>
He navigated through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, though the only feet were his own and memory’s. <words>161</words>
Each door he passed punched a new hole in the fractured idyll of his recollections, letting drafts of doubt seep through. <words>182</words>
At last he reached Lab Seven, its biometric lock long disabled by rust and a decisive jab from some forgotten saboteur. <words>203</words>
Inside, blue emergency bulbs still pulsed, illuminating glass tanks like planets, each orbiting silent questions. <words>218</words>
On a central pedestal floated the rumored jar, wires coiled around it like serpents guarding their newborn moon. <words>236</words>
A brass plaque underneath read, in Dahlia’s flourished handwriting, 'Duplicate—consult at your peril'. <words>249</words>
Gregor removed his gloves, pressed trembling fingertips to the glass, and felt a pulse that was not quite liquid, not quite electric. <words>271</words>
Thoughts leaked into him: maps of futures unfurling, codes rewritten, loyalties liquefied, then the single instruction—'advise me again'. <words>289</words>
The command soothed and scalded, reminding him why he had once defined himself by another mind’s approval. <words>306</words>
Yet he tasted iron on his tongue, realizing the duplicate had inherited Dahlia’s brilliance without her restraint. <words>323</words>
If he reactivated headquarters, the jar could command agents like puppets, scripting a war before dawn thawed. <words>340</words>
But walking away meant surrendering the only voice that had ever called him necessary, even as it rang clearly ambiguous. <words>360</words>
Through the humming glass he heard his own footsteps from earlier, looping back like prophecy, and he knew rumor was destiny’s disguise. <words>382</words>
He toggled the auxiliary generators, lights flaring awake as if morning had been replaced by a colder, brighter midnight. <words>401</words>
Then he knelt before the jar, whispering his first confident counsel, unaware that outside, pigeons launched skyward like scattered ciphers. <words>421</words>
