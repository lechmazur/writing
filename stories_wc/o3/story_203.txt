Cramped inside the maintenance shell of orbital debris spiraling above a hollowed Earth, Sabine Queron rehearsed an exorcism she might never dare to perform aloud. <words>25</words>
Stage fright had stalked her since childhood, knotting every syllable the moment attention glanced her way, yet the ghosts of satellites cared nothing for tremors in a human voice. <words>54</words>
She floated amid toy assembly, miniature plastic rockets drifting like mocking mirrors of the colossal wreckage outside the viewport. <words>73</words>
Each kit awaited blessing for the refugee children below, but her real cargo was a pressed wildflowers album wrapped in lead foil against radiation. <words>97</words>
The blooms had once perfumed a garden that official history insisted never existed, a fragrant footnote in the inheritance of lies her family guarded. <words>121</words>
Sabine’s aunt, dying, bequeathed the forbidden petals with a whisper: keep them never usual, keep them alive where truth still germinates. <words>142</words>
That charge became Sabine’s motive—to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to let hope photosynthesize in vacuum. <words>160</words>
But possibility, like any spirit, demanded invitation, and invitations demanded voices stronger than terror. <words>174</words>
She closed her eyes, listening for courage by the sound of a key turning in a lock—the small station’s airlock cycling for delivery drones. <words>198</words>
The metallic click became metronome, drowning imagined applause, and she spoke a first clear syllable that tasted like sunrise. <words>217</words>
At that utterance, the pressed wildflowers shimmered, exhaling motes of color that submerge the cramped shell in luminous pollen. <words>236</words>
Pollen mapped constellations of forgotten orchards across the cracked monitors, rewriting orbital debris into drifting soil, rewriting Sabine into a vessel of refusal. <words>259</words>
She continued, voice now a defiant hush, naming each satellite by the ghost it carried—wars, monopolies, censored seasons—and releasing them with an amen of chlorophyll. <words>284</words>
Outside, husks of metal blossomed green, panels unfolding like leaves until the junkyard’s jagged halo softened into orbiting gardens. <words>303</words>
Sabine felt the stage beneath her chest steady, as though applause were unnecessary because the children’s new toys would soon arrive wrapped in living sky. <words>328</words>
Those toys would carry seeds tucked beside instruction booklets, and instruction booklets would carry her pronunciation, italicized, so that any trembling mouth could germinate futures. <words>353</words>
The inheritance of lies would find no vacuum to echo in, only soil to be contradicted. <words>369</words>
Sabine sealed the album, now half-empty, and guided the drone toward reentry, her heartbeat synchronized with distant locks releasing their own ghosts. <words>391</words>
Even if fear returned, she had learned the counterspell: recall the click, inhale distant petals, and speak until metal remembers it was once a root. <words>416</words>
Within that single sentence lay her inheritance of truth, passed forward not upon paper but upon orbits newly greened, waiting for the children to rename gravity. <words>442</words>
