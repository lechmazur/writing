Murk and torchlight breathed against the timbered ribs of the reimagined longhouse, where forgotten sagas slept through the hush of an overlooked era.<words>23</words>
Into this cavern of remembered splinters strode Verin the rogue fortune teller, cloak modestly flashy with stitched runes that refused to glow.<words>45</words>
His purpose tonight was not performance but the quiet labor to archive emotional patterns of warriors long turned to ash.<words>65</words>
For this he carried an amber inkwell whose fossil swirl trapped the silhouettes of ancient tears.<words>81</words>
Each tear would be translated into runic curves once the inkwell tasted fate upon his quill.<words>97</words>
Yet translation demanded an offering, and there hung in the mead thick air the unspoken offer that every guest could feel but none could name.<words>122</words>
Verin signaled the house thrall to pour dark elderberry wine, trusting that a shared love for wine tasting would coax secrets from the gatherers.<words>146</words>
Cup by cup, his questions zigzag between laughter, toasted shields, and sudden silences, mapping the pulse of every gaze.<words>165</words>
He noted how the chieftain clutched a splintered armring when tales of exile surfaced, and how the skald's smile faltered at mention of ocean mist.<words>190</words>
These tremors of memory dripped invisible into the amber ink, tinting it with private storms.<words>205</words>
Although Verin's cloak sparkled only when fire flickered, the modestly flashy gleam served as lodestone for curiosity, keeping the hall's eyes orbiting him.<words>228</words>
Attention was necessary, because awareness itself flavors emotion, and he sought the fiercest yet most reposeful truth these people carried.<words>248</words>
In that tension of revelry and hush, Verin felt the era no chronicler bothered to record stretch like dusk across the rafters.<words>270</words>
It was the hour between dragon prows and church bells, suspended between gods that were leaving and laws not yet born.<words>291</words>
Sensing culmination, Verin raised his quill, but instead of ink he drew the unspoken offer itself into the midair like a glowing thread.<words>314</words>
The hall quieted as the thread braided visions of every seated soul, showing a tapestry of griefs, triumphs, and half healed jealousies.<words>336</words>
None spoke, yet each understood that by merely witnessing they had accepted an exchange, gifting their hidden storms to history.<words>356</words>
Verin sealed the amber inkwell, now swirling like honey struck by lightning, and the torch shadows seemed to bow.<words>375</words>
With a courteous nod, he walked the length of the longhouse, his path a deliberate zigzag so each person felt the passing gravity.<words>398</words>
Outside, northern lights unfurled in fierce repose above the fjord, and Verin knew the patterns were safe, both from oblivion and from easy answers.<words>422</words>
