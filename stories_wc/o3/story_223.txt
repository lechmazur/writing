<story>
Spryte Halberd, an awkwardly charming yet perpetually seasick naval officer, saluted the impossible horizon beyond the quarterdeck. <words>17</words>
His orders, printed on cracked vellum, demanded he sail upriver until water hardened into prisms guarding a crystal fortress at the end of a rainbow canyon. <words>43</words>
Those same orders whispered of a translucent ghost orchid bulb hidden in the fortress heart, blooming only for a true listener. <words>64</words>
Spryte had no idea what that meant, but nausea and curiosity often made loyal companions. <words>79</words>
Each night he steadied his rolling guts by tracking moon phases across the rigging with a brass sextant inherited from his mutinous uncle. <words>102</words>
The lunar ledger he compiled contained more than angles; within its margins lingered traded secrets bartered for calm winds and quieter stomachs. <words>124</words>
Among them was the legend that time itself flowed differently inside the canyon, stretching across the quiet longing of centuries like a sigh in glass. <words>149</words>
When the river finally refracted into jeweled stairs, Spryte disembarked, legs wobbling, heart hammering nostalgic defiance against his own frailty. <words>169</words>
The fortress shimmered like frozen lightning, its gates reflecting every sailor who had ever feared drowning in sky. <words>187</words>
Inside, mirrored corridors echoed with saltwater footsteps until Spryte reached an atrium lit by veined chandeliers of moonstone. <words>205</words>
Suspended in the center hovered the ghost orchid bulb, translucent and quivering, as though the air kept remembering a bloom not yet born. <words>228</words>
A silver mirror stood opposite the bulb, its surface already rippling with deceptive futures. <words>242</words>
Spryte recalled his true mission—to confront the mirror before it lies again—and squared his queasy shoulders. <words>258</words>
He offered the mirror his ledger of moon phases, the traded secrets inked in uneasy midnight, and the glass flickered, assessing the tribute. <words>281</words>
It demanded more: a transformation. <words>286</words>
Spryte, feeling the deck he no longer stood on lurch within his stomach, grasped the orchid bulb as tides of light surged through him. <words>310</words>
Petals of translucent memory unfurled, showing childhood afternoons spent balancing model ships in bathtub storms and promising never to fear change. <words>331</words>
He felt his nausea pivot into buoyancy, and with it his awkwardly charming smile blossomed into calm command. <words>349</words>
The mirror, sensing no further falsehood could anchor here, cracked like dawn ice, and the fortress walls rang with liberated time. <words>370</words>
Histories trapped across the quiet longing of centuries streamed out in rainbow rivulets, weaving themselves into sails on an invisible wind. <words>391</words>
Spryte realized the fortress had never been a destination but a chrysalis, and he was the moth-turned-captain. <words>408</words>
He saluted the shattered mirror, not to seek truth but to thank it for finally refusing to lie. <words>426</words>
Then, guided by moon phases he now felt pulsing beneath his skin, he stepped outside, ready to steer the freed centuries toward horizons no chart had dared imagine. <words>454</words>
