Within a mirrored reflection cracked by sea spray, Sir Calder the weatherbeaten knight stared at his distorted face.<words>18</words>
The lantern of the lighthouse prison off the jagged reef moaned above him like a beast remembering daylight.<words>36</words>
Every surface echoed, yet silence reigned, promising joyful agony for those daring to listen too closely.<words>52</words>
Calder carried a brass door knocker scavenged from a drowned manor, its lion face greened but unbroken.<words>69</words>
He appreciated the weight, because metal remembered everything a man preferred to forget.<words>82</words>
Tonight, that memory would hush the final cry of regret haunting the spiral stairs.<words>96</words>
The warden, a grudgingly sweet monk named Brother Hollin, awaited him beside iron bars that smelled of storms.<words>114</words>
Hollin presented a tray of seemingly random items: seashell, quill, shard of stained glass, rusted key, wilted violet.<words>132</words>
Calder felt the pattern before he solved it, the way sailors sense tides long before mathematics agrees.<words>149</words>
Five objects, five flights, five locks between him and the prisoner whose whisper still raked the horizon.<words>166</words>
Impossible choices guarded each landing: save a drowning guard, extinguish the warning flame, or shatter windows guiding ships.<words>184</words>
If he chose wrongly, the reef would claim another crew; if rightly, the captive’s sorrow would thunder forever.<words>202</words>
Calder ascended, accepting joyful agony as his heart’s compass.<words>211</words>
At the first gate, the seashell replaced a missing gear, letting waves ring instead of gears grinding.<words>228</words>
He spared the guard, forfeiting time, and water gushed through the wall, echoing a lullaby of wreckage.<words>245</words>
Glass shard planted on the second landing refracted lantern light into a path, keeping distant vessels from doom.<words>263</words>
Yet Calder walked blind, eyelids salt-stung, trusting the brass door knocker’s weight to guide his next breath.<words>280</words>
At the third gate, the rusted key refused the lock until Hollin’s grudgingly sweet hymn smoothed its teeth.<words>298</words>
Fourth flight, violet crushed beneath Calder’s heel, releasing scent of spring so pure it tasted like punishment.<words>315</words>
Finally he reached the spherical cell where the prisoner—his own younger self—crouched, mirrored in the curving steel walls.<words>333</words>
The choices converged: strike with the knocker and erase the boy’s memory, or embrace him and let ships shatter.<words>352</words>
Calder whispered, 'Regret is louder than wreckage,' and raised the knocker with tears tasting of surf and iron.<words>370</words>
He struck the mirrored floor, fracturing reflection and self alike, releasing a hush vast enough to still oceans.<words>388</words>
Joyful agony blossomed as the lighthouse bell rang one final, mercifully quiet note over the jagged reef.<words>405</words>
Behind him, Brother Hollin wept and appreciated the silence, recognizing the pattern only broken hearts can solve.<words>422</words>
