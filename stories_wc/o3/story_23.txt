The wandering bard arrived at the orbital solar wind collection point riding a squeaky dirigible lute-case. <words>16</words>
Security drones attempted intimidation, but his grin rattled their firmware like skeletons telling jokes in a chapel. <words>33</words>
He greeted each with a pun so bad it briefly corrupted their timestamp routines, then tiptoed past. <words>50</words>
The place was built to siphon the sun’s breath, yet no one remembered the last comforting exhale. <words>67</words>
That, he mused, epitomized the cosmic lag making universes wheeze instead of sing. <words>80</words>
He had come during the precise moment when the orchard’s keeper finishes the day’s final chore down on Verdant Deck Seven. <words>101</words>
Between that broomstroke and the keeper’s sigh lay an unattended minute declared free territory by ancient fruit spirits. <words>119</words>
Only within that comic loophole could the bard attempt his traditionally creative quest to restore universal systems. <words>136</words>
He drew from his satchel a book of pressed leaves, each leaf a forgotten operating manual written in chlorophyll lines. <words>156</words>
When read aloud, the leaves could coax machinery to photosynthesize maintenance songs. <words>168</words>
But first he had to orient the pages by following wind patterns channeled through the collectors’ mirrored petals. <words>186</words>
He licked his finger, caught a swirl of solar breeze, and spun clockwise until his boots squealed. <words>203</words>
The squeal echoed, becoming a rattle that awakened dormant servos like startled maracas of light. <words>218</words>
Panels unfolded, audience style, casting prismatic ghost-shadows that applauded with silent jazz-hands. <words>230</words>
The bard bowed, then began chanting the first leaf, a limerick referencing reboot codes and overripe peaches. <words>247</words>
Holographic sap dripped from the ventilation grates, lubricating cosmic gears nobody had noticed were squeaking. <words>262</words>
Next he recited a sonnet about composting expired galaxies into nebular marmalade, and the turbines purred appreciatively. <words>279</words>
Spectral laughter drifted from the circuitry, a phantasmal humor that tasted like minty ozone and old punchlines. <words>296</words>
Finally he whispered the ode of rebooting dawns, invoking the age of renewal signed in chlorophyll and light. <words>314</words>
Every console blossomed with petals of code, and status lights turned into tiny sunrise simulations. <words>329</words>
System logs reported universal subsystems reconnected, uplinks pollinating dark sectors previously starved of updates. <words>343</words>
The bard closed the leaf-book and tucked it beneath his hat, now twice as green as before. <words>360</words>
He glanced at the chronometer and saw the orchard’s keeper begin walking home, broom tracing tired constellations on the path. <words>380</words>
Within seconds the free territory would collapse back into regulations, so he saluted the invisible fruit spirits and hurried toward his dirigible. <words>402</words>
Behind him the machinery hummed a newly learned folk tune, promising to keep time until the next cosmic harvest. <words>421</words>
The bard laughed, a sound both alive and echoing from the other side of midnight, and drifted away on the wind. <words>442</words>
