Low tide bared the causeway to Gannath's tidal island, exposing barnacled cobbles that glimmered like forgotten armor. <words>17</words>
On the rampart waited Erys, the frail guard whose breath rattled louder than his tin breastplate. <words>33</words>
Every dusk, duty demanded he paint allegiances upon the fortress doors, crimson suns for loyalists, black crescents for dissenters. <words>52</words>
The ritual decided which arrivals lived within the keep and which were shunted to the sea caves. <words>69</words>
Erys knew the sorting was a lie; all marks doomed eventually, himself included, once tides erased distinctions. <words>86</words>
His heart beat a resolutely wavering rhythm, as though courage and weakness argued inside one stuttering drum. <words>103</words>
Tonight, however, a slip of bark scratched with hidden words awaited him among the paint pots. <words>119</words>
Ilen, the prisoner-smith, had carved the message while gathering driftwood and passed it hand to hand. <words>135</words>
It read, 'Phial ready, yank stopper when moon crowns water, follow western scars, freedom waits beneath.' <words>151</words>
Erys's fingers trembled as he found the sour-smelling alchemy phial nestled inside the paint-stained satchel. <words>166</words>
Vapors leaked from its cloudy glass, promising something neither poison nor perfume but irrevocable change. <words>181</words>
Throughout sorting he daubed doors with indifferent strokes, yet secretly replaced black crescents with harmless charcoal smudges. <words>198</words>
The commanders, busy cataloging crates of saltfish, never noticed the soft rebellion drying at their backs. <words>214</words>
When night flooded the yard, Erys limped toward the western wall, painting a final crescent on his own helm. <words>233</words>
The mark glistened like spilled sorrow, yet it steadied him. <words>243</words>
Reaching the cliffside pines, he brushed moss aside and revealed further bark-etched instructions guiding him down a fissure. <words>261</words>
Below, the surf carved hidden halls where Ilen waited among corroded chains and unlit forges. <words>276</words>
'Drink,' she whispered, handing him the phial that stung her wrapped fingers, 'or the tide will drink us instead.' <words>295</words>
Erys yanked the stopper, and the cave filled with citrus rot, a smell like time decomposing its own verdict. <words>314</words>
He swallowed the swirling draught, tasting rusted sunlight and burnt lilies, then felt his sinews knit with sudden vigor. <words>333</words>
The frail guard straightened, bones humming like newly tuned wires, while his doubts slackened into purposeful silence. <words>350</words>
Together they followed the dripping corridor to a submarine arch where moonlit currents pulsed like silver lungs. <words>367</words>
Ilen lashed barrel staves into a raft, and Erys painted it with leftover crescents, disguising wood as shadow. <words>385</words>
They pushed off precisely as the tide returned, the surf swallowing their footprints before alarm bells rang above. <words>403</words>
Behind them, painted allegiances blurred in salt spray, rendering all verdicts equally illegible to those who hunted. <words>420</words>
Ahead, the moon traced a wavering path, and the rejuvenated guard rowed with resolute hope toward uncharted dawns. <words>438</words>
Though distance still yawned, both believed the sea preferred honest uncertainty to the castle's predetermined fate. <words>454</words>
