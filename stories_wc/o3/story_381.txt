Silver halogen lanterns flickered against quartz walls, sketching neon ghosts across the crystalline cave.<words>14</words>
In the hush stood Veyla, a necromancer who preferred whispers to chants.<words>26</words>
Her voice, scarcely abundant in volume, could still summon memories from marrow.<words>38</words>
Tonight her intent was not resurrection but cartography, for the university had hired her to map cave systems.<words>56</words>
Accompanying her between sets of acoustic experiments was Orren, a selenologist wearing a scuffed baseball cap.<words>72</words>
Their partnership had formed over a shared love for old movies projected onto battered lab sheets.<words>88</words>
Quoting Casablanca while calibrating sonar felt almost normal beside stalactites that glowed like theater chandeliers.<words>103</words>
Yet deeper chambers distorted sound, and they waited between sets for instruments to cool, listening.<words>118</words>
What they heard was not echo but the sound of resolve, a crystalline hum marching forward.<words>134</words>
Veyla recognized it as tectonic will, the cave desiring to speak its own geometry.<words>148</words>
She raised bone-tuned microphones, murmuring equations that coaxed the hum into visible waveforms.<words>161</words>
Phosphorescent lines ribboned through the air, drafting corridors unreachable by ordinary drill.<words>173</words>
Orren tipped his cap, awe eclipsing the dust on its brim.<words>184</words>
"If we follow those paths, we could dominate subterranean cartography for decades," he whispered.<words>198</words>
Veyla disliked the word dominate, tasting empire in its syllables, yet she needed funding to continue.<words>214</words>
The hum responded, growing louder, as if negotiating terms in some mineral parliament.<words>227</words>
She offered compromise: share the maps, protect the silence, honor the caves as coauthors.<words>241</words>
The waveform tightened into arrows pointing east, where quartz spires converged like cathedral pews.<words>255</words>
They packed light, resources scarcely abundant after weeks underground, but curiosity outweighed fatigue.<words>268</words>
Orren hummed the movie theme from Metropolis, metallically echoing the lanterns' clicks.<words>280</words>
Futuristic nostalgia sprayed across their thoughts, scenes of skylines that never existed yet felt remembered.<words>295</words>
Veyla realized old films had always been necromancy, raising futures from celluloid coffins.<words>308</words>
The cave seemed to agree, projecting silent montages of silver trains along the glittering walls.<words>323</words>
Soon they reached an underground amphitheater where crystals curved like seats awaiting an audience.<words>337</words>
Between sets of natural pillars, a yawning crevasse pulsed, its depths unreadable.<words>349</words>
Orren stepped forward, but the hum halted him, replaying Rick Blaine's farewell line as warning.<words>364</words>
Understanding, he offered the scuffed baseball cap to the void like a ticket stub.<words>378</words>
The crevasse softened into a ramp, accepting tribute and partnership alike.<words>389</words>
Veyla and Orren descended, recording the architecture of living stone that recorded them in return.<words>404</words>
Somewhere above, the world remained loud, but here the sound of resolve guided every step.<words>419</words>
And in that tempered quiet, the future they mapped would echo back to those willing to listen.<words>436</words>
