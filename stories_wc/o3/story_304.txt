Borrowed starlight glazed the baroque asteroid, its curled marble ridges glowing like cathedral ribs suspended in vacuum.<words>17</words>
In the shadow of those frozen arches paced Seraphel, a lurking assassin whose footsteps were softer than the drifting iron dust.<words>38</words>
Her target was not a person but a moment, scheduled to unfold when the bus driver completes the final route through the asteroid's interlinked tunnels.<words>63</words>
That route, nicknamed the unforgiving road, began at the mining barracks and ended beneath the unpressurized rose window of the observation deck.<words>85</words>
Only at that terminus would dawn, artificial yet miraculous, swell from the mirrors of the sunward arrays and spill into the cathedral hull.<words>108</words>
Seraphel longed to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, to feel something newborn before it was bought, sold, or quantified.<words>128</words>
Yet an obstacle glittered at her hip: a paint-splattered camera lens, relic of a journalist she had silenced on another pale rock.<words>150</words>
Its kaleidoscopic glass recorded every motion, replaying images across her ocular implant with superficially profound captions the dead reporter had preprogrammed.<words>171</words>
The looping phrases mocked her purpose until she could only laugh, a brittle echo swallowed by the vaulted vacuum.<words>190</words>
She advanced nevertheless, mapping her strike via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, an algorithmic lattice projected in silvery threads before her eyes.<words>215</words>
Each radial glint represented a guard, each droplet node a surveillance drone, and at the heart pulsed the oblivious driver steering his empty bus.<words>239</words>
Timing was cathedral music: she must cut one strand, let another tremble, and arrive the moment his final brakes sighed.<words>259</words>
She slipped into the terminal plaza, columns twisted like melted harpsichord pipes, and waited as the rumbling vehicle rolled in.<words>279</words>
Headphones on, the driver hummed off-key, unaware that Seraphel's lens now sampled the dawning light flaring behind him, choosing its final frame.<words>301</words>
She approached, but the camera projected one last caption across her retina: 'Beauty begins where forgiveness ends,' sounding wiser than it was.<words>323</words>
The phrase struck like a misfired bullet, and suddenly Seraphel saw herself reflected in the windshield, a pilgrim not an assassin, drenched in someone else's borrowed starlight.<words>350</words>
She lowered the knife, opened the bus door, and gestured for the driver to witness the sunburst spooling through the rose window above.<words>373</words>
Together they stepped upon the unforgiving road of light across the deck, its brilliance pooling in their shaking palms like molten hope.<words>395</words>
The assassin's mission dissolved, yet her longing was met, for she now cradled dawn in trembling hands, and no caption dared speak.<words>417</words>
