<story>
Bram Tiller became mayor of Groveknot purely by accident after drawing the shortest straw during a flood relief raffle.<words>19</words>
Everyone still called him the Accidental Mayor, a title he wore like a mud‐spattered sash, equal parts pride and irritation.<words>39</words>
Tonight he trudged through the polluted swamp orchard tended by reclusive monks who grafted pear branches onto ghostly cypress trunks.<words>59</words>
Rusted lanterns hissed over stagnant channels, painting sickly halos on mist that smelled of vinegar and wilted blossoms.<words>77</words>
Bram's lovably grumpy mumbling kept the leeches away better than any monkish chant.<words>90</words>
He was searching for Brother Quen, keeper of water wisdom, whose advice might change the course of fate itself.<words>109</words>
The monks claimed Quen had metamorphosed into something new after midnight, the hour when the carnival in town finally folded its tents.<words>131</words>
Bram doubted every holy rumor, yet reluctant awe tugged at him the way tidal weeds pull on a skiff's oar.<words>151</words>
He reached the heart tree, where a brass door set in bark clicked open, disgorging a small clockwork beetle whose gears dripped sap.<words>174</words>
The insect bowed and projected Quen's whispering voice through vibrating wings.<words>185</words>
Quen explained that he had overheard a conversation in a crowded cafe earlier, hidden inside this beetle’s thorax while winding its spring.<words>207</words>
Two carnival financiers plotted to divert the river tomorrow dawn and drown Groveknot, profiting from disaster bonds they secretly underwrote.<words>227</words>
Bram spat a curse that startled lily‑gnats into sparks.<words>236</words>
He had until sunrise, precisely when the carnival packs up under the first rays of dawn, to unspin their scheme.<words>256</words>
The beetle ticked once and unfolded map‑etched wings marking hidden sluice gates among orchard canals.<words>271</words>
With grudging gratitude Bram pocketed the device, its tiny gears syncing to his heartbeat like a courageous metronome.<words>289</words>
He rallied the monks, promising fresh rain barrels if they helped reroute the foul water back into purification ponds.<words>308</words>
They worked in silence, their orchard hooks flashing like silver minnows under lantern flare while Bram cursed rhythmically to keep tempo.<words>329</words>
When the first ferris‑wheel bolt glinted pink on the horizon, the monks swung the final lever, and the river's force reversed.<words>350</words>
Surplus water surged through the orchard trenches, scrubbing pesticide film from pears and hoisting carnival wagons onto harmless sandbars downstream.<words>370</words>
Bram watched, arms folded, as neon banners collapsed into damp laughter, and he felt reluctant awe blossom beneath his habitual scowl.<words>391</words>
The clockwork beetle clicked thrice, recording history, then flew skyward to metamorphose into tomorrow's warning for some other accidental mayor.<words>411</words>
