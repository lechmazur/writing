The scoreboard blinked zeros after the championship joust, and Sir Rigor Lys exhaled, mission commencing.<words>15</words>
Every reset meant fresh rumors, and he chased rumors like other knights chased wine.<words>29</words>
Tonight he hunted the luminous swamp legend of the fossilized snail shell that sang futures.<words>44</words>
Collecting urban legends was his unspoken creed, stricter than any chivalric oath.<words>56</words>
The moat-market bordering the swamp kept one scholarly supplier, an aisle lit by glowmoss.<words>70</words>
There he reached for the last guidebook on phosphorescent wetlands, colliding with another gloved hand.<words>85</words>
They bumped elbows, armor against leather, classic meet-cute by the shelf’s dying lantern.<words>98</words>
Mara Quill introduced herself, voice clipped yet sparkling: an academically rebellious archivist expelled thrice.<words>112</words>
Her thesis claimed folklore outranked textbooks, a stance that pricked Rigor’s disciplined nerves.<words>125</words>
Still, converging destinies hummed between them like twin fireflies.<words>134</words>
She needed the shell to verify her theory that stories fossilize themselves into matter.<words>148</words>
He needed it to archive the tale before braggarts warped it.<words>159</words>
A terse pact formed: share findings, split glory, argue later.<words>169</words>
Midnight fog parted as they waded into the swamp, torches sketching neon halos.<words>182</words>
Bioluminescent lilies popped like applause under their boots.<words>190</words>
Rigor’s straight-laced instincts mapped cautious, silent steps; Mara’s exuberance hacked shortcuts through brambles.<words>203</words>
He admired her recklessness in the same breath he scolded it.<words>214</words>
Cricket-score chirps echoed, reminding him of the arena scoreboard now resting blank behind them.<words>228</words>
Every legend, like every match, restarted at zero once retold.<words>238</words>
At the swamp’s heart a stone plinth rose, cradling the fossilized snail shell.<words>251</words>
Its spirals glowed faint green, pulsing to their synchronized heartbeats.<words>261</words>
Mara rushed forward; a reed snapped; quicksand yawned.<words>269</words>
Rigor lunged, plate mail screeching, hauling her onto the plinth beside the shell.<words>282</words>
Their combined weight pressed the pedestal, triggering a shimmer that projected countless intersecting life-paths.<words>296</words>
They saw themselves dueling, debating, parenting, and dying—threads knotting, severing, rejoining in luminous loops.<words>310</words>
Destiny wasn’t a road; it was rush-hour traffic, and they were carpools.<words>322</words>
Mara laughed first, laconic yet exuberant: “Coauthored futures—efficient.”<words>330</words>
Rigor simply nodded, but his visor hid a grin wild enough to scandalize the court.<words>345</words>
He sheathed the relic in oiled velvet, sealing their agreement with knightly precision.<words>358</words>
She jotted field notes on a damp map, already revising academic dogma one quip at a time.<words>375</words>
Together they started back, arguing bibliography formats while firefly lights recorded their silhouettes.<words>388</words>
Behind them the plinth sank, resetting like the arena scoreboard, awaiting the next seekers.<words>402</words>
