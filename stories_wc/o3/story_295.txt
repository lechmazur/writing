Moonlight spilled like quicksilver over the witch's herb garden, where Varro the jovial sellsword twirled his moustache and waited for impossible instructions.<words>22</words>
His employer, the reclusive astronomer-witch Ceryse, appeared bearing an antique astronomical telescope banded with runes that glowed like patient comets.<words>42</words>
She claimed the device could watch not stars but promises, and tonight it must witness the withering vow before dawn's first blush.<words>64</words>
Varro, boldly reluctant, laughed with sword-quick cheer, yet some corner of his mind rattled like a loose scabbard filled with doubt.<words>85</words>
He had come to treasure his breezy certainty, and Ceryse's commission aimed to dethrone doubt from the mind—specifically, his.<words>104</words>
She led him deeper among yarrow, wolfsbane, and night-blooming chamomile, each leaf trembling as though rehearsing for some orchestral storm.<words>124</words>
At the garden's heart stood a stone plinth engraved with generations of her bloodline's names—a ledger of a family tradition of making a time capsule.<words>149</words>
Each century, she explained, one promise was sealed beneath the plinth and observed through the telescope throughout the transformation of its keeper.<words>171</words>
Tonight Varro must inherit the secret and surrender the laughter he wore like armor, else the vow would wither unattended and unleash elegant mayhem upon the realm.<words>198</words>
Reluctance flashed again, bolder now; yet his own code, forged in tavern brawls and roadside duels, forbade fleeing before hearing a full tale.<words>221</words>
Ceryse placed the telescope to his eye, sighted not on the sky but on a small copper pod nestled among the basil roots.<words>244</words>
Through the lens he saw himself, aging in reverse, jests peeling away, grins blanching, until only a raw-faced boy knelt before looming possibilities.<words>267</words>
The image spoke without sound: surrender the joke, swear guardianship, and doubt will collapse like a punctured wineskin, nourishing courage where it once fermented hesitation.<words>292</words>
Varro's heart jackhammered, yet he found himself grinning broader, because mayhem was his native dialect and elegance simply improved the accent.<words>313</words>
He drew his sword, pricked his thumb, and signed the withering vow upon a sprig of sage, feeling the garden absorb the crimson ink.<words>337</words>
Instantly the pod cracked; aromatic steam billowed, carrying giggles, tears, arguments, and lullabies—the archived emotions of every guardian before him.<words>357</words>
They braided around his shoulders like invisible capes, and he realized his famed joviality had merely been rehearsal for this deeper, sturdier mirth.<words>380</words>
Turning the telescope upward at last, he watched dawn ignite the horizon, and in the eyepiece doubt shriveled to ash, dethroned and drifting like spent starlight.<words>406</words>
Ceryse bowed, the herbs bowed, even the stone plinth bowed, acknowledging a transformation still unfolding yet already irreversible.<words>424</words>
Varro sheathed his blade, laughed a quieter laughter, and carried the telescope as newly minted sceptre, prepared to patrol the world for promises in peril.<words>449</words>
