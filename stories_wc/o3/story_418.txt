The last wheeze of the old record player dissolved into static, leaving the wasteland orchard strangely expectant beneath a bruised pink sky. <words>22</words>
Headstrong mage Calla Flint brushed dust from her cloak and declared the concert officially finished, because promises should never linger after the music dies. <words>46</words>
She was tenuously certain that the orchard’s mutating apple trees listened, their leaves twitching like gossiping listeners denied applause. <words>65</words>
Color had fled this region years ago, and Calla’s motive sat on her tongue like unripe fruit: to bring color back to a gray world. <words>90</words>
She opened a stained glass box that glowed despite the dust, each pane depicting forgotten rainbows she was determined to resurrect. <words>111</words>
Inside lay the once-sparkling costume of her vanished lover, Arlen, now dull cloth draped in the residue of glitter like frost on ashes. <words>134</words>
Calla believed that by channeling that glitter she could feminize despair itself, forcing it into colors it stubbornly denied. <words>153</words>
The spell, however, required courage to confess a truth loud enough to stain the air. <words>168</words>
She inhaled radioactive dust, tasting metal and regret, then turned to the orchard where fruit glimmered like lead pearls. <words>187</words>
"Arlen," she began, voice bright with merry bitterness, "I loved you so much that I bottled the sky you painted in laughter, yet I never told you." <words>214</words>
Glitter drifted from the costume like winter pollen, swirling into sigils that hovered above the box and reflected fractured sunlight. <words>234</words>
The orchard shuddered, and crimson flooded the nearest apples as though remembering what blood once felt like. <words>251</words>
Dust storms gathered on the horizon, but their edges flickered turquoise, then lavender, then gold, as the confession rippled outward. <words>271</words>
Still, the spell demanded more, a final shard of honesty she had always dodged: she envied Arlen’s fearless softness. <words>290</words>
She whispered that envy, and the glitter answered by spiraling around her own body, tracing curves where angular certainty once stood. <words>311</words>
Calla felt herself feminize alongside the color, not as surrender, but as armor forged from pigments she had denied her heart. <words>332</words>
The transformation steadied her, and she was now more than headstrong; she was softstrong, an impossible coin whirling on both edges of will. <words>355</words>
With a laugh that scratched like the record player’s dying note, she raised the stained glass box high, scattering prisms onto the orchard floor. <words>379</words>
Storm winds slammed into the trees, yet blossoms bloomed neon beneath the assault, and the air tasted unexpectedly of candied thunder. <words>400</words>
Color, confessed at last, colonized everything, even the dust storms, and the wasteland orchard began to hum a new song no scratch could silence. <words>424</words>
Calla Flint closed her eyes, tenuously certain that tomorrow would taste like peaches instead of fallout, and she smiled into the kaleidoscopic wind. <words>447</words>
