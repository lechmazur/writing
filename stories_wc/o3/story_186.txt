The suspended palace hung like a chandelier, its marble balconies chained to glistening stalactites dripping with ancient frost. <words>18</words>
Within this airy labyrinth lived Quinby Flax, a whimsical tinkerer whose inventions fluttered between joke and miracle. <words>35</words>
Quinby carried a polished brass thermometer everywhere, claiming it was his compass for the planet's feverish moods. <words>52</words>
He had vowed to chronicle environmental changes before the palace's crystal moorings cracked and the kingdom plummeted into cloud. <words>71</words>
But data alone felt sterile, so he sought stories, and stories arrived through pop-up carnival fortune-tellers drifting dock to dock. <words>91</words>
Their tents unfolded like origami prophecy, and inside, oddly truthful automata whispered destinies as gears clicked behind velvet. <words>109</words>
From each mechanical seer, Quinby extracted a phrase about melting ice, sick forests, or seas climbing staircases of air. <words>128</words>
He sculpted those phrases into kinetic dioramas, brass leaves spinning around mercury suns, exhibiting them to courtiers who adored disasters made decorative. <words>150</words>
Yet midnight lingered like a question mark, reminding him that illusions, however practical, would not outlast the thermometer's cracked reflection. <words>170</words>
One dusk, a new booth blossomed beside the banner rail, painted with the exact hues of the moment a brush first kisses canvas. <words>193</words>
Inside waited an artist wearing a mirrored mask, claiming to measure not futures but the instant futures begin. <words>211</words>
The artist invited Quinby to hold the thermometer against a blank panel while she stroked pigment across it, trapping the palace's temperature in color. <words>235</words>
Reds boiled, greens wilted, whites thinned to glass, and Quinby felt the canvas breathe like lungs losing volume. <words>253</words>
A hush stitched through him: this was mortality, not only of people but of places that pretend to hover forever. <words>273</words>
He realized his sculptures merely delayed grief by turning it into clockwork ballet. <words>286</words>
Resolved, Quinby asked the mirrored artist how to catalog change without lying. <words>298</words>
She answered in the carnival's only unwound voice: 'Tell what melts, tell what remains, sculpt in sentences, and sign your name with silence'. <words>321</words>
The words were oddly truthful, falling heavier than mercury yet clearer than glass. <words>334</words>
Quinby dismantled his dioramas that night, salvaging gears for pens, leaves for pages, suns for periods. <words>350</words>
He began scripting a chronicle that would span only the brush's first contact with canvas, for beginnings reveal endings in miniature. <words>371</words>
Each paragraph recorded the palace's sighs, the stalactites' sweat, the carnival's migrating cloth, all measured against the brass thermometer's dwindling shine. <words>392</words>
When the mercury finally receded to a silver thread, he inked no conclusion, leaving the last line blank so readers could hear the drop. <words>416</words>
Above the mist, the suspended palace creaked like an easel, and Quinby waited, practical illusion spent, truth newly sculpted. <words>435</words>
