After the last glacier melts, the world shimmers with pristine chaos, half ruins, half newborn gardens. <words>16</words>
Beneath an emerald mist, a submerged palace lies entombed in the cursed lake once called Aurash. <words>32</words>
Here drifts Elion Voss, a daydreaming scholar whose thoughts are seldom regular and always reaching elsewhere. <words>48</words>
Elion's small submarine, cobbled from coral ribs and brass propellers, docks against shattered marble stairs. <words>63</words>
He seeks a rumored sliver of a crashed meteor-bound satellite, said to pulse with archived starlight. <words>79</words>
With it he hopes to create a masterpiece that inspires generations, rewriting despair into possibility. <words>94</words>
Hallways flooded waist-deep reflect chandeliers like liquid constellations, urging him deeper into catacombed ballrooms. <words>108</words>
He surfaces in the grand rink once reserved for swan-skate pageants, the water now mirror-slick. <words>123</words>
Above the glassy floor, he sees faint scuff marks curving like hieroglyphs, remnants of frantic escape. <words>139</words>
Recalling legends, Elion realises the palace archivists used these lines to promote compassion through coded scuff marks in this forgotten skating rink. <words>161</words>
He photographs the patterns, aligning them with constellation charts until an address materialises: beneath the throne room. <words>178</words>
Swimming down spiral stairs, he finds the satellite sliver wedged like a knife in coral-encrusted velvet. <words>194</words>
Its surface pulses, yet another scuff: an orbital etching of braided lines, literal threads of compassion beamed from space. <words>213</words>
Elion attaches the fragment to his wrist console, and holograms unfurl, depicting civilizations aiding one another after storms. <words>231</words>
Moved, he decides his masterpiece will not be a solitary treatise but a living school inside the palace. <words>249</words>
He will invite minds from drowned continents, letting coral corridors become libraries and seagrass amphitheaters echo with debate. <words>267</words>
To broadcast the call, he programs drones to skate across the rink, retracing the archivists' paths night after night. <words>286</words>
Each pass scuffs new grooves that shimmer bioluminescent, spelling invitations only dreamers could notice. <words>300</words>
Soon, kites of submarines descend, carrying painters, algorithmic poets, and gardeners of planktonic light. <words>314</words>
Their arrival turns silent halls into workshops where chisels hum alongside whale songs, forging sculptures that breathe water. <words>332</words>
Elion wanders among them, still daydreaming, yet guiding their experiments toward that singular weave of hope. <words>348</words>
The palace, once a relic of tyranny, becomes a loom where threads of compassion loop through every column. <words>366</words>
Even the cursed lake, sensing purpose, permits shafts of sunlight to pierce its gloom and feed blooming lantern kelp. <words>385</words>
Scholars will someday trace their inspiration to these shimmering scuff marks, the seldom regular whispers of a daydreamer who chose to promote boundless care. <words>409</words>
And in that ongoing masterpiece, after the last glacier's memory has faded, humanity will finally skate unafraid across pristine chaos. <words>429</words>
