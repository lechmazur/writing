Oriana Kneadwell, the small-town baker everyone underestimated, carried a cynically gentle smile.<words>12</words>
Customers tasted comfort in her loaves yet never noticed the blueprints sketched in flour beneath the counter.<words>29</words>
Those diagrams plotted how to exceed the limits of time itself.<words>40</words>
She hid them because Governor Vulk, tyrant of the valley, forbade invention not stamped with his crest.<words>57</words>
Vulk's rule began the season when shadows learn to speak, whispering betrayals into every doorway at dusk.<words>74</words>
Oriana listened, bitter dough under her nails, and heard the shadows beg for revolt.<words>88</words>
They told her of an emergency time machine garage buried beneath the abandoned observatory hill.<words>103</words>
There, moonlight pooled like mercury on rusted chassis, waiting for a pilot brave and precise.<words>118</words>
Oriana's cynically gentle humor masked a colder calculation: dethrone Vulk before contagion spread further.<words>132</words>
The seeds of contagion, sown by his chemical mills, already withered trees and lungs alike.<words>147</words>
Pressed flowers she once gifted to patrons now crumbled black, petals mapping the sickness across town.<words>163</words>
Therefore she lowered the bakery shutters at midnight and followed lunar silver to the hidden garage.<words>179</words>
Inside, a dented chronovan awaited, its dashboard carved with cryptic grooves resembling moon phases.<words>193</words>
An ancient manual proclaimed the engine only aligned by tracking moon patterns precisely through seventy-seven minutes.<words>209</words>
Oriana scribbled the current sky on parchment sprinkled with rye, then turned knobs to match crescents.<words>225</words>
Electric hush enveloped her as gears sighed awake, recognizing the baker's resolve.<words>237</words>
She set coordinates for one week earlier, the moment Vulk first ordered the mills ignited.<words>252</words>
If she could expose his plan then, popular fury would exceed his guards' loyalty.<words>266</words>
Time warped like dough under violent kneading, and the chronovan exhaled her into the earlier night.<words>282</words>
She hid behind barrels near the mill, clutching a bouquet of those blighted pressed flowers.<words>297</words>
When Vulk strutted in, she scattered petals at his boots; they puffed black spores into torchlight.<words>313</words>
Guards recoiled, seeing evidence of contagion birthed by the tyrant's own greed.<words>325</words>
Oriana stepped forward, voice steady, announcing that moon records predicted the plague's bloom under his schedule.<words>341</words>
She displayed charts from the bakery blueprint, proving correlation between waxing gibbous nights and toxic runoff.<words>357</words>
The crowd of laborers, once silent as dough, roared with awakened shadows voicing indictment.<words>371</words>
Vulk tried to command, but the spores clouded his throat, forcing him to cough confession.<words>386</words>
They chained him with conveyor belts while Oriana signaled the moonlit hour for revolution.<words>400</words>
