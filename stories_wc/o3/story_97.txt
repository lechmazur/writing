In the cradle of a whispered minute, the fact-minded oracle named Quillion stepped through a flickering arch into an unstable dimension hunting for data that maps silence. <words>27</words>
His brass compass quivered like a tuned heart, its needle circling wildly as if smelling histories long exiled from memory. <words>47</words>
Quillion’s motivation was simple but bottomless: to find forgotten places and prove that even oblivion keeps receipts. <words>64</words>
Yet optimism twitched inside him with the pulse of desperation, making his voice desperately casual whenever he cataloged a newly discovered ruin. <words>86</words>
The dimension around him breathed out landscapes like broken equations; mountains inverted, rivers paused midair, villages repeated themselves in jittering loops. <words>107</words>
Each distortion reminded Quillion that logic here was elastic, so he fenced his thoughts with numbered axioms to stay sane. <words>127</words>
Still, the unstable dimension had its own pedagogy, delivering lessons via heartbreak-induced visions that cracked open his methodical mind. <words>146</words>
One such vision flared when he touched a mirrored meadow where grass reflected stars instead of moons. <words>163</words>
He saw, in blinding empathy, a population that had loved too efficiently, optimizing affection until it vanished, leaving only tidy ledgers of regret. <words>186</words>
The vision struck like a subtraction, and he had to recompose his breathing to avoid dissolving into their arithmetic sorrow. <words>206</words>
When the meadow dimmed, his brass compass finally found north, but the needle pointed toward a corridor of impossible doorframes stacked inside one another. <words>230</words>
Quillion stepped through them sequentially, reciting facts aloud—orbital periods, mineral densities, lost census numbers—as protective charms against emotional overflow. <words>249</words>
With every door, the corridor shrank until he emerged on a ledge overlooking the Path to Empathy, a luminous road woven from shared sensations. <words>273</words>
The road beckoned like a question mark made of dawn, but he knew its curves could unknot starlight and unravel the skeleton of his certainty. <words>298</words>
Optimistic desperation found its crescendo as he pocketed the humming compass and stepped onto the radiant braid, promising himself to annotate every feeling with meticulous calm. <words>324</words>
Instantly the road channeled memories not his own—first kisses ending in tears, lullabies sung at funerals, jokes delivered beside imploding suns—and he staggered under the payload of tenderness. <words>352</words>
Facts blurred, but somewhere behind the dizziness he sensed coordinates for all the forgotten places, encoded in the emotional spectra flooding his nerves. <words>375</words>
He realized the equations would balance only if he carried the universe’s grief with a posture both humble and desperately casual, converting sorrow into cartography. <words>400</words>
So Quillion walked farther into the Path to Empathy, every footstep birthing a new coordinate, every tear recomposing hope, until the dimension itself began to steady. <words>426</words>
In that whispered minute’s cradle, he drafted a map of luminous remorse that could guide wanderers home, and for once the oracle trusted feelings more than figures. <words>453</words>
