The bone archways of the ancient ossuary now served truffle risotto, and I stacked cedar boards beside the bar. <words>19</words>
Patrons never guessed their polished tables were hewn by a spirited lumberjack who still smelled faintly of pine storms. <words>38</words>
I, Branko Stjepan, grew up splitting frozen trunks, yet city lights made me gracefully awkward in linen aprons. <words>56</words>
Doctor Amarant, the restaurant's skeletal sommelier, slid a cracked femur between our plates and whispered of a coded letter from a future war. <words>79</words>
When the bone opened like a scroll, its marrow grooves pulsed with runes predicting cities charred and throats needing balm. <words>99</words>
Someone who bore my surname begged me to revamp the restaurant into a sanctuary before the conflagration crossed time. <words>118</words>
Hidden agendas thickened the air more than simmering marrow broth. <words>128</words>
Every night after closing, I pedaled my dented touring bike along the river, the ossuary's shadows chasing me throughout bike rides like restless dogs. <words>152</words>
Wind rattled the letter in my satchel, and its pulses seeped upward, teaching me through reawakened nightmares I thought I'd buried under spruce stumps. <words>176</words>
Axes of black glass hacked screaming branches, lovers coughed gunpowder snow, and each dawn I woke tasting ash yet craving dawn again. <words>198</words>
Those scenes dripped with harsh tenderness, for the dream‑people pressed salves of moss and honey onto one another's wounds. <words>217</words>
I realized the letter wanted me to learn their healing traditions before their world bled backward into ours. <words>235</words>
So I studied apothecary manuals between chopping service wood, binding cut fingers with nettle poultices instead of gauze. <words>253</words>
Patrons whispered that the bruised glow in my eyes matched the candlelight, and reservations multiplied, unaware they were financing their own refuge. <words>275</words>
Amarant and I replaced the ossuary's floor with cedar capable of storing medicinal vapors, the scent of sap outwrestling death's perfume. <words>296</words>
Still, the nightmares intensified, showing columned smoke that looked exactly like the restaurant's bone chandeliers. <words>311</words>
I biked harder, thighs burning, and spoke aloud to the wind, bargaining with unseen strategists scripting this future war. <words>330</words>
Their only answer was silence that cut like blizzards against my beard, urging me to keep building haven rather than wielding axe. <words>352</words>
So I offered the restaurant's grand opening of the revamped crypt to the city's healers, inviting them to trade recipes beneath dangling skulls. <words>375</words>
They arrived—herbalists, midwives, burnt-out surgeons—and we feasted amid femurs while cataloging balms strong enough to outlast artillery. <words>392</words>
I felt the letter cool in my pocket, as if pleased that tenderness had been hammered through harsh oak. <words>411</words>
Perhaps wars travel backward only when forgotten hands refuse to heal forward. <words>423</words>
Under dim candlebones, I raised a cup of marrow wine, promising the unseen future that our refuge would stand, gracefully awkward yet unbreakable. <words>446</words>
Outside, my bicycle waited like a loyal timberwolf, ready to carry new cures through night streets before the first shells ever fell. <words>468</words>
