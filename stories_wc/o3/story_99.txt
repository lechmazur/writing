Across the tapestry of lost legends, Auden Vale drifted toward the abandoned carnival's prize booth. <words>15</words>
He was a bookbinder with discreet telekinetic powers, drawn here by whispers stitched between cracked spines. <words>31</words>
The booth's striped canvas flapped, producing wavering sound bites that struck his mind like flint on steel. <words>48</words>
Each snap of fabric ignited a flashback, reviving ghosted memories from carnivals never written but always known. <words>65</words>
Auden listened with strictly casual poise, though inner galaxies reeled behind his half‑lidded eyes. <words>79</words>
Knowledge here demanded tribute, and he had already paid in loneliness, sleeplessness, and silver‑flecked hair. <words>94</words>
Still, he sought the power of transformation promised by the rumor of a single chopstick wrapper. <words>110</words>
It was said the wrapper contained the last fortune penned by Madame Weizan, prophetess of imploding books. <words>127</words>
If read aloud, the fortune could turn wisdom into wind, bodies into stories, time into raw parchment. <words>144</words>
But legends murmured that such metamorphosis carried a concealed tariff, the steep price of knowledge itself. <words>160</words>
Auden exhaled, letting his telekinesis lift scattered plush toys, searching beneath faded bears and eyeless dolphins. <words>176</words>
Under a sagging shelf he found the prismatically folded wrapper, its paper humming like a muted violin string. <words>194</words>
The canvas snapped again, and a child's laugh, half‑recorded in the wind, triggered another flashback. <words>209</words>
He watched himself years earlier, refusing to revive a dying manuscript because the author feared change. <words>225</words>
That hesitation had cost a life and birthed his vow to never let pages stagnate again. <words>241</words>
He returned to the present, hands trembling with restrained gravity like moons orbiting invisible weight. <words>256</words>
Prying the wrapper open, he read the tiny ideograms, each syllable resonating as metallic carnival chimes. <words>272</words>
Air thickened; plush animals flattened into glyphs; the booth elongated until aisles of forgotten fairs spiraled outward. <words>289</words>
Knowledge poured through Auden like molten ink, etching galaxies on his nerves and shredding the notion of self. <words>307</words>
He sensed the tariff arrive: every memory of his mother, the first storyteller he had ever loved. <words>324</words>
Tears floated upward, guided by telekinetic reflex, but he released them, honoring the demanded exchange. <words>339</words>
With the sacrifice sealed, transformation blossomed; the booth recongealed as a towering library of silenced carnivals. <words>355</words>
Shelves spun like merry‑go‑rounds, and every ride horse became a tome bound in moonlit vellum. <words>370</words>
Auden stepped inside, strictly casual even now, though cosmos wheeled behind his shoulders like embroidered capes. <words>386</words>
He touched a newborn volume and felt it breathe, ready to revive any soul seeking metamorphosis. <words>402</words>
Thus the bookbinder paid, transformed, and began weaving new legends, ensuring the carnival of knowledge would never again decay. <words>421</words>
