Hollis Crane, a gentle brawler with knuckles scarred by causes not anger, guided his dented van along the desert highway at dusk.<words>22</words>
He drove with intense nonchalance, as though every trembling star overhead were merely another roadside motel light.<words>39</words>
The van's rear tire sighed, burst, and flattened, leaving him with a flat tire in the middle of nowhere.<words>58</words>
Hollis rolled to a stop beside a limestone cliff that locals called the Echo Chamber because every shout returned wearing new tones.<words>80</words>
The place felt peculiarly natural, like a throat grown from stone, waiting to confess.<words>94</words>
In the cargo bay, beneath boxing wraps and protest placards, he kept his grandmother's antique spice box.<words>111</words>
Each compartment still held motes of cumin, cinnamon, and asafoetida, scents that punched harder than any fist he ever threw.<words>131</words>
He cracked it open, wanting comfort, but the desert wind snatched the spices into the air like colored secrets.<words>150</words>
Clouds of aroma drifted into the Echo Chamber and, between verses of the wind’s howl, formed a voice only he could hear.<words>172</words>
It said the soul’s revelation is not thunderous but whispered, and someone must chronicle social changes before the echo forgets them.<words>193</words>
Hollis answered with a grin, improvising a pledge as casually as he once improvised uppercuts in underground rings.<words>211</words>
He would roam town to town, recording dialects, street art, and kitchen gossip, boxing only when the rent or a bully demanded blows.<words>234</words>
Yet first he needed the wheel fixed, and the nearest help lay fifty empty miles away.<words>250</words>
He unpacked the boxing wraps, braided them into a makeshift sling, and hoisted the van’s axle like a coach lifting a student.<words>272</words>
Sweat glazed his brow, but his movements remained fluid, a dancer who happened to bruise.<words>287</words>
The spice cloud still murmured, reminding him that gentleness can strike harder than iron if memory rides the blow.<words>306</words>
He tightened the spare, wiped his palms on the dust, and inhaled deeply, storing the scents as chapters yet unwritten.<words>326</words>
When the engine rumbled awake, he left the Echo Chamber behind, but its resonance followed, peculiarly natural, like a conscience that hums between verses.<words>350</words>
Truth, he realized, was an antique spice box: harmless until opened, then impossible to gather once scattered on the wind.<words>370</words>
With fierce calm he steered east, chasing the next unheard chorus of the people, prepared to fight softly for every note.<words>391</words>
Somewhere beyond the horizon, social changes were tuning their instruments, awaiting a chronicler who could box shadows into shape while whistling.<words>412</words>
