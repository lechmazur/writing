Permit me, with only the smallest fanfare, to introduce myself: Aurelen Vint, accredited soul-broker and itinerant real-estate agent of the interstitial beyond.<words>22</words>
I ply my gentle craft atop a floating tea platform that drifts between epochs like an unhurried saucer.<words>40</words>
Around me, porcelain cups remain weirdly static even while the planks hum with atmospheric currents.<words>55</words>
Such contradictory stillness provides the perfect showroom for parcels of afterlife property I present to roving spirits.<words>72</words>
My inventory ranges from hummingbird-sized cloud-cottages to baroque nebular palaces, each priced in whispers and regrets.<words>88</words>
Yet my true motive, spoken only to the steam, is to learn forgotten songs hidden in every wandering throat.<words>107</words>
Contracts merely finance the orchestra I am slowly assembling.<words>116</words>
To secure both deeds and melodies, I rely on the art of persuasion the way anchors trust gravity.<words>134</words>
Persuasion, however, must be choreographed, not improvised, or the delicate egos of specters may shatter like glass.<words>151</words>
My choreography begins by reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles collected from centuries of abandoned celebrations.<words>168</words>
Each inverted phrase suggests a cadence, a rhetorical sidestep, a gesture with which to tilt a doubtful halo.<words>186</words>
For example, 'Eniw Yggo Gnirps' guided yesterday's pirouette that convinced a melancholy knight to downsize his afterlife moat.<words>204</words>
Today, a single dusty wine bottle awaits, its burgundy sealed since the dawn of recycling.<words>219</words>
Throughout recycling, matter forgets forms yet remembers tunes, and I anticipate a chorus trapped within the sediment.<words>236</words>
I tilt the bottle, squint through the grime, and decipher the backward legend: 'Sgnos Rehto Naht Ssel.'<words>253</words>
Translated, it whispers, 'Songs Other Than Self,' a prompt both humble and grand, exactly my preferred register.<words>270</words>
Armed with that cue, I summon three clients: a librarian, a lighthouse, and a lullaby, each seeking new quarters.<words>289</words>
Their desires orbit the platform like teabags on invisible strings, so I begin my subtle dance.<words>305</words>
First, I pivot toward the lighthouse and offer a cliff-edge bungalow with windows that blink appreciation in Morse.<words>323</words>
While its beam nods, I spiral to the librarian, promising shelves grown from maple memories beside perpetual quietude.<words>341</words>
Finally, I bow before the lullaby, unveiling a cradle-shaped gazebo where night breezes rhyme themselves to rest.<words>358</words>
Each proposition lands softly, because the reversed label had already planted its refrain inside their listening silences.<words>375</words>
When the contracts swirl signed, the floating tea platform erupts in newly recalled harmonies, yet I merely sip and nod, collecting payment in notes rather than applause.<words>402</words>
