Marlow Quill, an overly curious mortician from the swamp-front town of Palmetto's Rest, loved daybreak autopsies.<words>16</words>
But dawn was perilously late today, and his hunger for answers tugged him toward the mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits.<words>37</words>
He carried a tarnished silver bracelet he'd pried from an unclaimed wrist, convinced it whispered directions only he could hear.<words>57</words>
Each note from the unseen choir flickered between lullaby and riot, crafting a mood of polite anarchy that thrilled him.<words>77</words>
Marlow stepped carefully, observing how his own footprints appeared luminescent then vanished after a single heartbeat.<words>93</words>
These fleeting impressions, he realized, were the spirits' chosen method of conversation, syllables spelled through footprints that vanish after a single heartbeat.<words>115</words>
To reply, he imitated their rhythm by tapping the bracelet against mangrove roots in loudly serene cadences.<words>132</words>
The roots responded, shaking loose mud that smelled of jasmine and ozone, the rustle of revelation humming inside every leaf.<words>152</words>
A corridor parted, forming like a living morgue drawer, and Marlow slipped in without hesitation.<words>167</words>
There, hung between arching branches, floated hundreds of journals bound with moonlight and kelp.<words>181</words>
He knew instantly they were the dream journals he had vowed to collect, mapping death's afterimages for the still-living.<words>200</words>
However, each glowing diary was guarded by a spirit whose song echoed the writer's final hope or fear.<words>218</words>
To claim them, Marlow would need to negotiate with melodies instead of mortuary paperwork.<words>232</words>
He raised the tarnished bracelet, letting dawn's first glimmer spark along its scars like a cautious match.<words>249</words>
The spirits hushed as if etiquette were briefly fashionable, granting him an audience.<words>262</words>
Marlow spoke in clicks of metal, promising he would archive every dream without censorship, then return the stories to their owners' descendants.<words>284</words>
That vow, both rebellious and respectful, tasted of the polite anarchy the swamp adored.<words>298</words>
One by one, the journals descended, ink dripping like condensate from forgotten prayers.<words>311</words>
Marlow opened the first volume and read of a sailor who learned to breathe brine the night before drowning.<words>330</words>
The page exhaled salt, and his curiosity bloomed wider than rigor mortis ever allowed.<words>344</words>
He cataloged the dream in brisk shorthand, noting the spirit's approval as his footprints flickered into place beneath him.<words>363</words>
Yet each notation cost a minute of mortal time, and the mangrove shadows warned that sunrise meant eviction.<words>381</words>
When the night yields to golden embers, the spirits sang, their archive must be sealed in silence again.<words>399</words>
Understanding the limit, Marlow packed as many journals as pockets and dignity allowed, his coat bulging like a respectable crime.<words>419</words>
Before departing, he left the tarnished silver bracelet hanging on a root, payment for the rustle of revelation they'd granted.<words>439</words>
The spirits, loudly serene once more, imitated his farewell by shaping footprints of light that vanished before he could blink.<words>459</words>
As he emerged from the labyrinth, dawn ignited the river like a cremation pyre, and Marlow smiled, pockets rustling with tomorrow's anatomy of dreams.<words>483</words>
