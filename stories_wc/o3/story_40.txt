Rainclouds popped like soap bubbles over Wrenbury just as I unlocked the dusty doors of the forgotten recipe library.<words>19</words>
I, an endlessly reincarnated goldfish caretaker now stranded in a human body, considered it fitting irony.<words>35</words>
Goldfish at least remember nothing, while I recall every past gill-flutter of failure.<words>48</words>
The library smelled of nutmeg, mildew, and guilt's haunting echo that trailed me since my last aquarium calamity.<words>66</words>
Today's mission was tentatively fierce: disrupt the town's stagnant tradition of bland stews by reviving forbidden flavors.<words>83</words>
Before the doctor's chart confirms a turning point in my fraying nerves, I planned culinary rebellion.<words>99</words>
I shelved my umbrella beside a toy soldier with a missing arm perched like a sentinel on the returns desk.<words>119</words>
Someone had swapped him for late fees, the clerk explained with playful cynicism that rivaled my own.<words>136</words>
Thunder cracked, the lights blinked, and a gust spiraled down the ventilation shafts, scattering index cards like albino snowflakes.<words>155</words>
That sudden change of weather led to a chance encounter when a stranger tumbled in, chasing the errant soldier.<words>174</words>
She wore a lab coat embroidered with sauce stains and introduced herself as Dr. Maribel Butterscotch, culinary therapist.<words>192</words>
Her smile was simultaneous apology and dare, promising to alleviate whatever ailed my recipe-obsessed soul.<words>207</words>
Lightning flickered, revealing books titled 'Soups for the Recently Undead' and 'Spices of Self-Sabotage'.<words>221</words>
We hunted for a lost broth said to erase remorse, or at least dilute it to a tolerable whisper.<words>240</words>
The clerk muttered odds on our survival, then resumed polishing the armless sentinel as though expecting promotion.<words>257</words>
Dr. Butterscotch kept glancing at my hands, perhaps sensing residual fins beneath the skin.<words>271</words>
I kept glancing at her pocket notebook where she sketched toy prosthetics for soldiers and caretakers alike.<words>288</words>
Guilt's haunting echo curled through the aisles, humming of fish bowls overturned by careless children I once served.<words>306</words>
Maribel proposed we steep the echo itself, infusing it into stock so pungent tradition would surrender or choke.<words>324</words>
I laughed, tentatively fierce yet buoyed, agreeing that nothing seasons revolution like evaporated sorrow.<words>338</words>
Together we followed a breadcrumb trail of paprika flecks to an iron cauldron hidden behind encyclopedias of etiquette.<words>356</words>
The recipe required a single plastic limb as stirring rod, and the armless sentinel volunteered by falling off the desk.<words>376</words>
When the limb dissolved, thunder ceased, and outside the rain reversed upward, reattaching to gray stitched clouds.<words>393</words>
Inside, aroma of impossible forgiveness rose, light enough to lift even my goldfish memories toward blankness.<words>409</words>
Maribel sealed a vial for lab verification, reminding me this was all preliminary data until the chart said otherwise.<words>428</words>
Yet before the doctor could jot his decisive squiggle, flavour and weather had conspired to reset my orbit.<words>446</words>
I left the library free of the echo, already plotting absurd soups to shock tomorrow's complacent palates.<words>463</words>
Outside, the toy soldier saluted me with his nonexistent arm, and I saluted back with my nonexistent fins.<words>481</words>
