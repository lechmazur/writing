The invitation arrived on thick vellum, perfumed enough to choke the courier dog I was walking for Mrs. Vellaccio. <words>19</words>
She is my latest ultra-rich client, yet her commands still smell of old coins and older hauntings. <words>36</words>
Tonight, when color bleeds from day into night, she wants her five Pomeranians exercised through Ravenhollow Manor. <words>53</words>
Payment includes dinner in the haunted mansion dining room, a place servants whisper about in a loud silence. <words>71</words>
I accept without speaking, because silent agreements grease the gears of luxury more efficiently than signed contracts. <words>88</words>
Yet my real motivation tonight is to stand where fear dares not tread and see why. <words>104</words>
The dogs, bows bobbing, lead me through gardens manicured to look carefully careless, as though storms had styled them. <words>123</words>
Among the hedges lies a glistening greenhouse protecting Mrs. Vellaccio's private botanical collectionâ€”orchids that drink moonlight like wine. <words>141</words>
I note syringes beneath one pot, reminders of last week's charity blood drive held on these grounds. <words>158</words>
There I had first encountered her, veins offered regally, explaining she never donates but always hosts, to justify her fortune's pulse. <words>179</words>
Now dusk bruises the sky, and the dogs freeze, hackles raised toward the dining room's open French doors. <words>197</words>
Candles gutter inside, light skating across a table set for six, though only shadows occupy the chairs. <words>214</words>
A butler made of dust gestures me forward, then dissolves when a dog barks, leaving ash footprints on the carpet. <words>234</words>
The loud silence thickens, and I feel every unspoken rule vibrate like cello strings under unseen bows. <words>251</words>
Mrs. Vellaccio materializes at the head seat, gown stitched from moth wings, orchids pinned to her throat. <words>268</words>
I notice each orchid's root snakes into her skin, sipping her instead of soil. <words>282</words>
She pats an empty chair, and the silent agreements between employer and walker cry for me to sit. <words>300</words>
I obey, careful yet appearing careless, my leash wrist loose enough for escape if courage fails. <words>316</words>
Plates rise by themselves, presenting slices of rare meat that still twitch, tasting of iron and confession. <words>333</words>
She orders me to justify my presence beyond animal care, voice so soft it rattles chandeliers. <words>349</words>
I answer that curiosity is a leash I put on the universe, tugging until truth heels beside me. <words>367</words>
She smiles, bleeding color from the room, and the dogs whimper but stay; they, too, want to stand where fear folds. <words>388</words>
A window groans open to twilight, and every orchid releases a single drop of scarlet onto the plates. <words>406</words>
The meat drinks the blood and calms, as though satisfied testimony has been taken. <words>420</words>
In the loud silence that follows, I realize the manor itself hosted the blood drive for its gardens, not for charity. <words>441</words>
Fear snarls at the threshold, but I remain seated, leash coiled like courage in my palm. <words>457</words>
Mrs. Vellaccio raises her glass of moonlight and offers a toast that uses no words, and I drink. <words>475</words>
Outside, the dogs howl approval, and the mansion, satisfied with the newest silent agreement, finally lets midnight in. <words>493</words>
