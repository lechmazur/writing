Steam curled in brittle spirals as I balanced my tin mug on the tilted parquet of the sunken pirate ship's ballroom.<words>21</words>
Morning coffee was a ritual I refused to surrender, even forty meters beneath the waves, even while tutoring a class of squabbling seabirds in navigation.<words>46</words>
I, Rilla Devane, wilderness guide of tundras, deserts, and now drowned ballrooms, had come here to master a challenging skill: breathing inside grief.<words>69</words>
The ocean echoed my intent with manic clarity, rattling chandeliers like metronomes marking each accelerating heartbeat.<words>85</words>
Yet what truly kept time was the ordinary metal ring circling my little finger, warm as guilt, bright as innocence, impossibly both.<words>107</words>
It had belonged to Vega, my ex-co-guide, whose last words 'equalize or die' still hummed through my ears like propeller blades.<words>128</words>
We separated on a ridge of ice after I misjudged a crevasse, leaving him guiltily innocent of blaming me, and me guiltily innocent of forgiving him.<words>154</words>
The dive was my apology letter, written not in ink but in lung pressure.<words>168</words>
Still, words needed paper, and paper needed survival, so I concealed my diaries inside the crocheted blanket I'd dragged from camp, encoding entries into its stubborn lumps.<words>195</words>
Every raised knot meant a consonant, every valley a vowel, the fabric fluttering like multilingual kelp around the broken banquet tables.<words>216</words>
I hoped Vega, wherever currents carried him, would someday read the blanket with his fingertips and understand the pattern: I am trying to equalize.<words>240</words>
To finish the message, however, I first had to equalize the wreck itself, pacify the trapped air, and open the ballroom doors that bellowed like angry lungs.<words>267</words>
So I sipped scorching coffee, exhaled in sevens, and descended the staircase, my fins clacking upon barnacled mahogany with ceremonial precision.<words>288</words>
The chandelier crashed, startled by my bubbles, and the ballroom tilted further until parquet became wall and the ceiling transformed into a shimmering floor.<words>312</words>
I wedged the ring between two iron gears of the ballast pumps, a sacrificial coin, and the mechanism sighed, stabilizing the wreck like a leveled tripod.<words>338</words>
Water and air reached detente, pressure gauges spun to green, and quiet spread, neither victory nor defeat, just an equal line between before and after.<words>363</words>
In that hush I finished crocheting, my fingers trembling with manic clarity as I knotted the final confession: forgive yourself, I already have.<words>386</words>
When I surfaced, sunrise bleeding gold across the waves, the blanket glowed like a lighthouse, and I felt the world inside my lungs at last equalized.<words>412</words>
