<story>
Galen steamed oat milk behind the greasy consoles of Dock 7, the only transmission repair berth that brewed espresso.<words>19</words>
He was a telepathic barista, catching the scattered thoughts of sailors as deftly as he caught falling portafilters.<words>37</words>
Their worries tasted like over‑extracted bitterness, yet he served smiles, stirring sugar into anxieties he never mentioned aloud.<words>55</words>
At the cusp of seasons, when autumn gasped its first cold breath across the harbor, Captain Mirelle hobbled in.<words>74</words>
She brandished a weather journal bound with kelp leather and closed by a tarnished vintage button hook.<words>91</words>
The entries, she confessed, mapped storms by the pattern of ice crystals in a glacier high above the strait.<words>110</words>
But the cipher eluded her, and without it, her fleet’s next voyage would founder beneath uncharted sleet.<words>127</words>
Galen tasted bright desperation in her mind and agreed, with noble foolishness, to help decode the frosted script.<words>145</words>
Success, he believed, needed redefining: not treasure hauled, but journeys safeguarded and coffees that recalled people to themselves.<words>163</words>
So he cloaked the cafe, dimming the filament bulbs and hanging an OUT OF BEANS sign to deter traffic.<words>182</words>
Efficiency mattered, yet Galen was efficiently inefficient, brewing experiment after experiment instead of simply consulting the port authority’s databanks.<words>201</words>
His method relied on sensory crossfire: smell the beans, taste the captain’s thoughts, watch the journal under lamplight, listen for coolant drips.<words>223</words>
Each element synced like gears in the transmissions surrounding them, until the dock itself hummed with speculative weather.<words>241</words>
Ice patterns formed fractal memories in Galen’s mind, tracing corridors where letters became barometric pressures and pauses marked wind‑shifts.<words>260</words>
He poured a latte, sketching the decoded route in foam swirls for Mirelle, steam rising like alpine mist.<words>278</words>
She gasped, understanding that the glacier’s silence prophesied a narrow window of calm tucked between two snarling blizzards.<words>296</words>
Her gratitude pulsed across their telepathic channel, and Galen nearly spilled espresso at the sudden warmth.<words>312</words>
Before departing, Mirelle asked what payment he required; he answered with a shrug and a joking demand for perpetual weather stories.<words>333</words>
Such barter, he declared, was the currency of redefined success, and she saluted him as though he were admiral of coffees.<words>354</words>
Long after her ship slipped into the equinox dusk, Galen cleaned portafilters, feeling both exhausted and strangely crowned.<words>372</words>
The dock’s machinery clanged, reminding him that tomorrow would bring new clutches of transmissions and nerves to soothe with crema.<words>392</words>
Yet he smiled, having proven that an efficiently inefficient barista at a transmission repair dock could steer nations from storms.<words>412</words>
In the hush before dawn, he whispered thanks to the glacier that had lent its icy grammar to coffee foam.<words>432</words>
Outside, the seasons finally traded cloaks, and a gentle snow began to fall, confirming his foolish, noble craft.<words>450</words>
