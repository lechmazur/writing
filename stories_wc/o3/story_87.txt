In the hush of a memory reclaimed, Alaric Quill drifted into the brass-paneled dining hall of steam and gears.<words>19</words>
Though patrons clanged forks like clock hammers, the patient librarian carried silence around him the way others wore coats.<words>38</words>
His hyperactively serene eyes traced vortices of engine-warmed tea rising from copper cups.<words>51</words>
He sought, tonight, not stories but surrender.<words>58</words>
Under one arm rustled a wrinkled sticker sheet, its childish stars dulled by decades of forgotten drawers.<words>75</words>
The sheet had once crowned spelling champions, yet one empty square now gaped like a missing tooth in a lie.<words>95</words>
Alaric meant to paste the final star upon a grave he kept in his heart, and thus bury an old hatred.<words>116</words>
Across the hall, atop a balcony of cogwheels, Maestro Rivet toasted another award, oblivious to the librarian's arrival.<words>134</words>
Years ago, Rivet had won the spelling bee only because he bribed judges with novelty songs recorded on homemade cassettes.<words>154</words>
Alaric discovered the cheat while archiving the school basement but never spoke, fearing his calm would throb into vengeance.<words>173</words>
Instead, he composed punishment through forgotten mixtapes, slipping them yearly into Rivet's mail like echoing ghosts of guilt.<words>191</words>
Yet the maestro only turned the tunes into encore melodies, parading hollow victory as though it were triumph.<words>209</words>
Tonight Alaric intended a finale with savage grace.<words>217</words>
He seated himself beneath the pneumatic chandelier, unfurled the sticker sheet, and set a phonograph upon the linen engine-table.<words>236</words>
Steam pistons hissed as the needle dropped onto the first mixtape loop, a childish song warped into lament.<words>254</words>
Rivet’s smile faltered, notes of shame flickering across his face like soot on porcelain.<words>268</words>
Every table watched the maestro shrink, their applause winding down as gear-driven fans slowed in sympathy.<words>284</words>
Alaric rose, walked the length of copper flooring, and pressed the last star onto Rivet’s lapel where his medals glittered.<words>304</words>
The sticker, dulled but insistent, covered a polished pin that spelled VICTOR in unapologetic brass.<words>319</words>
Rivet looked up, eyes watering steam-scented tears, and understood the ledger of wrongs had closed without applause.<words>336</words>
Around them, pressure valves sighed like old judges, releasing burdened air as if clearing a courtroom.<words>352</words>
Alaric felt no triumph, only the echoing emptiness that follows justice delayed too long.<words>366</words>
The hollow victory thrummed through the gears, matching the muted throb inside his chest.<words>380</words>
Yet serenity, hyperactive in its quiet, pushed his heartbeat outward until it dissolved among the mixtape’s fading static.<words>398</words>
He bowed to Rivet, gathered the phonograph, and walked past yawning boilers toward the night, mission ash-gray yet complete.<words>417</words>
Behind him, the dining hall resumed its ticking feast, but the librarian’s memory, reclaimed, closed like a well-oiled cover.<words>436</words>
