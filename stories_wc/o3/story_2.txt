I strode into the iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode, boots crunching on quartz shards that chimed like timid bells.<words>21</words>
Even for a skeptical spiritual medium, the scenery felt forged by an overeager deity showing off its color palette.<words>40</words>
Yet I refused to gasp, practicing brazen humility the way some people practice fake modesty.<words>55</words>
My motive was simple: to learn forgotten crafts whispered about in footnotes of grimoires no archivist had dared unseal.<words>74</words>
The guide, a fun‑house mirror of a man in sequined coveralls, delivered me here during the hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak.<words>99</words>
The park’s cacophony halted, and that suspended second felt like the universe inhaling, leaving only the peculiarly frequent drip of mineral water off stalactites.<words>123</words>
I unpacked the centaur horseshoe with runes scorched along its crescent, still warm from the forge of some mythic farrier.<words>143</words>
Legend said the horseshoe could strengthen any bridge between worlds if introduced to fresh curiosity.<words>158</words>
Freshness, according to my research, arrived most reliably by the scent of a new book, pages barely separated from their siblings.<words>179</words>
So I cracked a pristine volume titled 'Manual of Tomorrow’s Anachronisms' and let its printing‑ink perfume twine with the cavern’s cool breath.<words>201</words>
Mists of uncertainty seeped from the pages, swirling phosphorescent as if punctuation itself exhaled doubts into the air.<words>219</words>
They wrapped my ankles first, testing faith like cats brushing shins, then climbed to my throat with icy petitions.<words>238</words>
I addressed them aloud, announcing, 'I trust nothing, including you, but I am willing to audit your skills program.'<words>257</words>
The clouds parted, revealing silhouettes of artisans—obsidian‑eyed glassblowers, loom‑armed mathematicians, and a mason whose trowel dripped nebulae.<words>274</words>
Each vowed to mentor me if I could pronounce the runes without blinking, a test designed to puncture charlatans.<words>293</words>
My skepticism steadied my gaze while my humility—loud, yes, but never lied about its ambitions—kept arrogance from fogging the symbols.<words>313</words>
I enunciated the centaur script slowly, and the horseshoe rang like distant hooves striking marble corridors not yet built.<words>332</words>
Resonance rippled outward, dislodging quartz petals from the geode’s ceiling, but the vibration also tightened the spectral crowd into vivid authenticity.<words>353</words>
The artisans, now luminous as birthday candles in vacuum, began teaching: glassblower shaping time‑bubbles, mathematician weaving prime factors into scarves, mason stacking regrets into cathedrals.<words>378</words>
With every demonstration, the horseshoe throbbed, etching new runes that recorded technique faster than I could jot notes.<words>396</words>
I inhaled the book’s scent again, and the mists of uncertainty diluted into morning‑light clarity, as though curiosity itself had finished brewing.<words>418</words>
Still, I refused to claim victory; instead I thanked the spirits, tossed the guide my last ticket stub, and marched out before applause could echo.<words>443</words>
After all, humility is safest when worn brazenly, like armor no egotist dares counterfeit.<words>457</words>
