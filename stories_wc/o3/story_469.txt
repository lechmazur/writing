Echoes skittered like silver fish across the whispering gallery, and Riese Belen, the blameless smuggler, listened to them as though they were instructions from fate. <words>25</words>
He had come during the final countdown before the city locks sealed, hired to map forgotten tunnels beneath the basilica. <words>45</words>
That clandestine cartography was supposedly a victimless errand, yet his conscience, being logically emotional, cataloged dangers with geometrical precision. <words>64</words>
In his palm dangled a child’s skeleton key necklace, the only tool delicate enough to flirt with the antique locks ahead. <words>85</words>
He followed no map yet; instead he navigated by the scent of a garden at night that wafted impossibly through the marble vents, guiding him like a floral compass. <words>114</words>
Somewhere above, countdown klaxons tolled, their brassy booms diffusing into whispers that urged haste yet mocked overreach. <words>131</words>
Riese bowed to the echoing ceiling with grandiose modesty, murmuring an apology for the art of survival that required him to trespass. <words>153</words>
He pressed the skeleton key into the first iron throat and felt the lock sigh open as if relieved to surrender its story. <words>176</words>
A panel slid aside, breathing a plume of jasmine air that confirmed his aromatic compass was true. <words>193</words>
Beyond lay a corkscrew stair, inked with shadows that carried the softened gossip of centuries. <words>208</words>
As he descended, he mapped by touch and memory, tapping each stone and marking coordinates within a mnemonic litany. <words>227</words>
Every step down stitched another thread in the tapestry he would sell to rebels who dreamed of freedom in the underways. <words>248</words>
He told himself the exchange would spare lives, making his smuggling blameless, though the whispering gallery muttered a skeptical refrain. <words>268</words>
Halfway to the subterranean nave, a fresh fragrance—the green bite of crushed ivy—cut across the jasmine, warning him of another seeker. <words>289</words>
He halted, extinguished his lamp, and let the dark instruct him. <words>300</words>
Bootsteps clattered below; a municipal engineer had evidently overreached permission in the opposite direction, chasing the same rumor of tunnels. <words>320</words>
Riese inhaled the ivy note, plotted a detour, and etched it silently into his mental map, resolving that no duel would stain his blamelessness. <words>344</words>
He continued, guided by scents that shifted like celestial coordinates, until the stair debouched into a vaulted chamber where nightsoil rails converged. <words>366</words>
Here the countdown sirens were muffled to a heartbeat, telling him little time remained before the city’s doors clanged shut for a decade. <words>389</words>
Riese slipped the necklace over a bronze latch that none had touched since dynastic dawn, and the entire floor tilted, revealing a labyrinth older than law. <words>415</words>
His map, though unfinished, now possessed a royal artery, the sort of secret worth a thousand passports. <words>432</words>
Yet he closed the hatch behind him, erasing the scent trail, because survival, like art, was perfected only when unseen. <words>452</words>
Above, the final bell of the countdown struck zero, and the gallery exhaled a satisfied hush, sealing both city and secret in mutual silence. <words>476</words>
