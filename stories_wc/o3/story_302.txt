Goggles clinked against crystal goblets as the steampunk airship's dining room lurched through thunderous clouds. <words>15</words>
The passengers, corseted bohemians and brass-buttoned engineers alike, declaimed verses to the engine's syncopated wheeze. <words>30</words>
Into this cultured racket swaggered Lark Peridot, the ship's infamous tuneless bard. <words>42</words>
He carried no lute, only a stained manuscript tucked in an oilcloth satchel. <words>55</words>
Its pages, smeared with engine grease and dried meteor rain, reportedly mapped the mathematics of pandemonium. <words>71</words>
He was fiercely nonchalant, bowing with exaggerated politeness yet never removing the ash dangling from his cigarette. <words>88</words>
Captain Brassica invited him to read, expecting parody, perhaps a drunken limerick about overworked pistons. <words>103</words>
Instead, Lark produced a tinderbox, struck flint, and ignited the chandelier's wickery with theatrical sparks. <words>118</words>
Shadows jittered across brass gears, and murmured poems faltered like birds near a propeller. <words>132</words>
He opened the manuscript, revealing equations spiraling into half-legible stanzas that claimed chaos could be tamed through rhythm. <words>150</words>
The claim traveled among the tables via twisted word-of-mouth legends even before he began to speak. <words>166</words>
Some whispered he once quieted a riot by humming off key beside a collapsing zeppelin. <words>181</words>
Others swore the manuscript contained directions to the horizon of madness, a place the bard longed to kiss. <words>199</words>
Lark cleared his throat with brazen humility, as if apologizing in advance for detonating everyone's convictions. <words>215</words>
Then came a sound neither song nor speech, more like mismatched cogs grinding themselves into sudden harmony. <words>232</words>
The chandelier flames pulsed to his arrhythmic cadence, and diners felt their measured heartbeats lurch into fractal syncopation. <words>250</words>
Steam valves whistled accidental counterpoint while teacups rattled semaphore messages nobody consciously understood. <words>263</words>
Chaos arrived, but under his direction it bowed, pirouetted, and arranged itself like silverware before dessert. <words>279</words>
Captain Brassica, eyes wide behind monocles, recognized that discipline could sprout from dissonance the way orchids root in storm drains. <words>299</words>
Yet Lark offered no triumphal grin, only a shrug suggesting the universe deserved neither credit nor blame. <words>316</words>
He declared that taming chaos was merely housecleaning, and anyone with courage could sweep infinity's attic. <words>332</words>
Still, he coveted what came after order: the vertigo of leaning over reality's rail to kiss raw possibility. <words>350</words>
The airship listed slightly, aligning its bow with a bruised sunset trembling at the world's curvature. <words>366</words>
Lark snapped the manuscript shut, tucked it under his arm, and stepped onto the dining table. <words>382</words>
Wind roared through skylights as he kicked open a maintenance hatch and faced the smear of dying light. <words>400</words>
In fiercely nonchalant farewell, he bowed again, leapt, and vanished into the horizon, perhaps finally kissing madness itself. <words>418</words>
