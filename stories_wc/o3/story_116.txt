Blaze the dismayed minstrel slouched against a chrome banister in the black velvet sky-lounge floating above an endless city, tuning silence instead of strings.<words>24</words>
Patrons puffed nebular hookahs, and their laughter dripped like neon rain, yet Blaze felt time snagged on his broken watch band.<words>45</words>
He had come amid garden secrets whispered into his cab ride, rumors that a cartographer of darkness needed a song.<words>65</words>
The assignment, he was told, was to draw a map of an endless night before dawn remembered itself.<words>83</words>
Such cartography required him to excavate depths no lantern could reach, so Blaze adopted a method older than melody: learning by studying old polaroid photographs.<words>108</words>
Each faded square showed starlit terraces, lovers chalking drawn boundaries between petals and shadow.<words>122</words>
Blaze, ever subjectively rational, cataloged the angles of every chalk line, convinced emotion hid in geometry.<words>138</words>
Still, the watch band hung like a broken question mark around his wrist, ticking nothing but regret.<words>155</words>
He flipped another Polaroid and saw himself, younger, on that same balcony, laughing with a girl whose name he had erased.<words>176</words>
The realization struck like a muted chord: the endless city looped not below but inside him.<words>192</words>
To finish the map, he would chart his own omissions, turn secrets outward, let melody replace the chalk.<words>210</words>
With laconic exuberance he rose, uncasing a battered cittern whose body glimmered like spilled midnight.<words>225</words>
Notes fluttered across the lounge, persuading patrons to slide their hookahs aside and listen as if sky itself tuned in.<words>245</words>
He sang of terraces where roses drank moonlight and of a girl who measured silence with her smile.<words>263</words>
Lines of chalk lifted from the Polaroids, glowing, rearranging overhead into constellations that sketched streets, doors, memories, and the missing dawn.<words>284</words>
Blaze followed the aerial script, plucking chords that anchored each symbol until the map of an endless night hovered complete.<words>304</words>
At the center glowed a small circle labeled 'home'â€”the very banister where he first doubted himself.<words>320</words>
He understood then that boundaries were drawn not to confine but to remind wanderers which emptiness belonged to them.<words>339</words>
Music thinned, chalk faded, and the sky-lounge lights brightened like eyelids opening.<words>351</words>
Patrons exhaled, unknowing cartographers newly equipped, while Blaze fastened the broken watch band, accepting its silence as the final coordinate.<words>371</words>
He bowed, tucked the Polaroids into his coat, and stepped toward the elevator, carrying night like a portable horizon.<words>390</words>
Below, the endless city waited to be played, streetlamps ready to ring like tuning forks beneath his newly charted path.<words>410</words>
