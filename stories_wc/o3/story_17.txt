I, a guilt-ridden black market genealogist, had always traced bloodlines for desperate clients, but the last job left me smeared with more than ink. <words>24</words>
The infant I identified for a barren heiress turned out stolen, and guilt now clings like wet ash. <words>42</words>
So I quit the night alleys of the city and began taking notes amid morning walks along the river. <words>61</words>
Each dawn I carried a chipped bowl, pretending its jagged rim mirrored the fracture in my own lineage. <words>79</words>
That brazen modesty amused the crows, but it also reminded me that contrition need not grovel to be real. <words>98</words>
Still, I needed a methodology sharp enough to cut through regret and profitable enough to keep bread on the desk. <words>118</words>
That is when the witch of Lockwood Lane summoned me to her incantation chamber, murmuring she desired her heritage traced. <words>138</words>
Candles guttered, sigils glittered, and the air tasted like burnt thyme and courthouse dust. <words>152</words>
She offered no gold, only a stack of funeral eulogies from centuries of witches whose names history refused. <words>170</words>
She believed their secrets hid in plain lament, and she wanted me to zoom through time by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies. <words>193</words>
I recognized the commission as both sin and opportunity, the exact combination that always dragged me toward the brink of renewal. <words>214</words>
Besides, an atypically typical hunger for redemption gnawed louder than my caution. <words>226</words>
For weeks I parsed the parchment, sketching family constellations across the stone floor and letting candlewax drip like commas between names. <words>247</words>
Patterns emerged: stolen babies, swapped tombstones, destinies rewritten with deliberate misprints—stories frighteningly similar to my own darkest ledger. <words>265</words>
Each discovery echoed within the chipped bowl, where I dropped pebbles to mark milestones as though tallying sins. <words>283</words>
On the forty‑ninth pebble the witch proclaimed the lineage complete, yet I hesitated, sensing a missing name at the bowl’s bottom. <words>304</words>
That absent soul, I realized, was mine, slipped between records like a misfiled birth certificate nobody mourned. <words>321</words>
I told the witch I must inscribe myself as debtor and guardian, or the tree would topple. <words>338</words>
She laughed, a rasp that shook ceiling dust, yet agreed, for any spell built on omission rebounds. <words>355</words>
I etched my confession beside hers, dropped the final pebble, and the bowl cracked fully, releasing a blue curl of light. <words>376</words>
The chamber walls zoomed outward like lungs taking a first breath, and dawn flooded in, washing parchment clean. <words>394</words>
Standing on the threshold, I felt neither absolved nor condemned, but delicately balanced—an archivist on the brink of renewal. <words>413</words>
That was enough footing to begin my own lineage honestly, step by step, amid morning walks under unjaded sky. <words>432</words>
