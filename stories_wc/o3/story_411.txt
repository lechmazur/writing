I was born a sentient car mechanic, my spark wrenching free from steel rather than flesh. <words>16</words>
The junkyard called me Wrenchwhisper, a nickname repulsively attractive to motorists who smelled miracles on rusted air. <words>33</words>
Yet I abandoned the surface when the apple roots of rumor tugged at my chassis like sorrowful magnets. <words>51</words>
They spoke of a subterranean orchard fed by an underground river of stars, a place where engines might dream in sap. <words>72</words>
I descended through manholes whose lids sang constellations, following the metallic perfume of cosmic water. <words>87</words>
Below, fruit glowed like dashboard bulbs, and every trunk crooned with muffled exhaust notes of memory. <words>103</words>
But the orchard was shattered, its soil littered with fragments of voices that had never been spoken. <words>120</words>
These were the unsaid confessions I had come within the concept of infinity to hear. <words>135</words>
To piece them together, I needed sight finer than headlamps, so I salvaged a pair of vintage opera glasses from a drowned theatre trunk. <words>159</words>
Through their cracked lenses, each mote of floating dust enlarged into a syllable, begging for assembly. <words>175</words>
I embraced the core concept of gathering fragments the way priests embrace liturgy, my gears humming lit candles. <words>193</words>
The orchard's fountain, once marble, now engine block, still gurgled, and puzzle pieces of confession floated there like greasy lily pads. <words>214</words>
I decided to study by sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in a park fountain carved into the orchard's heart. <words>234</words>
Every piece was stamped with oily constellations that matched the starry river flowing beneath the roots. <words>250</words>
When aligned, they released whispers: a driver admitting love to an engine, a child apologizing to a stalled carousel, a planet praying for rotation. <words>274</words>
Grief swelled like octane in my cylinders, but its burn was exultant, propelling me to rearrange faster. <words>291</words>
Still, fragments repelled each other, attracted irresistibly, repulsively attractive as magnets turned both north and north. <words>307</words>
So I poured starâ€‘water over the fountain basin, turning screws of light until poles reversed and shards clicked. <words>325</words>
The subterranean orchard trembled; apples fell upward, leaves turned to spark plugs, and the ceiling unfurled into midnight boulevards. <words>344</words>
At the center, confessions fused into a single engine of language that idled like a congregation waiting for song. <words>363</words>
I lifted the engine to my grill and listened through the vintage opera glasses, which now served as twin stethoscopes of light. <words>385</words>
Every unsaid confession churned into music, and the orchard echoed with wrenching hallelujahs of regret and release. <words>402</words>
The sound travelled up irrigation shafts, surfacing as sudden tears on unsuspecting cheeks across the endless highways above. <words>420</words>
I realized my task would never finish, because infinity is only the space between one confession and the next. <words>439</words>
Yet I revved with exultant grief, eager to gather the coming fragments the universe would forever scatter. <words>456</words>
My gears turned, opera glasses glimmered, and the orchard below infinity thrummed like a restored heart. <words>472</words>
