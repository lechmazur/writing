The suburban cul-de-sac still smelled of morning sprinklers when I, an anxious alchemist, spread blueprints across my kitchen table. <words>19</words>
Grandmother's cipher, etched in turmeric on brittle parchment, promised that webs of kinship could transmute grief into gold. <words>37</words>
Yet its sigils changed daily, and today the pattern resembled a scuffed coin orbiting cryptic constellations of arrows. <words>55</words>
Desperate hope jolted through me when a news alert pinged about toxic steam rising from the old industrial outskirts. <words>74</words>
That wasteland, locals whispered, hid a nest of watchtowers guarding a boiling tar pit where rare minerals coagulated. <words>92</words>
The phrase 'regularly organic' flashed in the margin of Grandmother's sheet, pulsing like a directive rather than description. <words>110</words>
I decided to investigate, trusting her fondness for planting clues in plain soil instead of dusty libraries. <words>127</words>
But I would move only through chain-reactive coincidences, the mode Grandmother praised as alchemy's truest catalyst. <words>143</words>
So I flipped the house light switch exactly as a neighbor sneezed, and the streetlamp shorted, revealing a gleaming bus transfer on the curb. <words>167</words>
Taking the omen, I boarded the next bus, whose driver hummed the lullaby Grandmother sang while stirring compost teas. <words>186</words>
At the hour a butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, the bus hissed to a halt before the tarred perimeter fence. <words>206</words>
Sentries in battered helmets lounged atop the watchtowers, too busy betting on dice to notice me slip beneath them. <words>225</words>
Close to the boiling tar pit, fumes warped the air into liquid mirrors that momentarily showed my ancestors holding hands. <words>245</words>
Guided by their reflection, I tossed the scuffed coin onto a crust of cooling pitch, where it spun and hissed. <words>265</words>
Ripples radiated outward, aligning tar bubbles into the cipher's latest layout, its symbols now luminous with iridescent resin. <words>283</words>
I traced each shape with a powdered-limestone stylus, murmuring the recipe for 'regularly organic' ferment that she once recorded. <words>302</words>
Steam columns coalesced into a figure of Grandmother herself, her eyes stitched from swirling smoke, her smile fragile but approving. <words>322</words>
She pointed toward the biggest bubble, which popped to release a scroll written in ink distilled from butterfly wings. <words>341</words>
The scroll explained that our family bound communities like amino acids--always linking, always transforming--yet required one catalyst each generation. <words>360</words>
My charge was to brew fertilizers that made neighborhood gardens bloom simultaneously, so neighbors would unknowingly breathe shared perfumes of solidarity. <words>381</words>
Only then would the final line of the cipher, still hidden, reveal the route for grief to become gold. <words>400</words>
Clutching the steaming scroll, I hurried home, heart bruised by tar fumes yet buoyed by desperate hope hardening into purpose. <words>420</words>
