I found the inverted waterfall by accident, its rivers climbing skyward like frantic serpents fleeing gravity.<words>16</words>
The map had promised nothing there, yet an unplanned stop at a roadside attraction rerouted my pilgrimage.<words>33</words>
I, Galen the disappointed archer, traveled not to loose arrows but to chronicle social movements across provinces.<words>50</words>
Yet every march I documented concluded in betrayal, each manifesto folded into silence before reaching its crescendo.<words>67</words>
That history had bent my bowstring into a question mark I could no longer straighten.<words>82</words>
Mist rose upside-down around me, and the air tasted of reversed tears.<words>94</words>
Local legend insisted a bridge of regret spanned the waterfall's summit, visible only to those admitting defeat.<words>111</words>
I was anxiously calm, the way a lantern guttering in wind pretends steadiness while expecting dusk.<words>127</words>
So I climbed the spray-slick rocks, compelled less by faith than by the ache of unfinished annotations.<words>144</words>
At the pinnacle, instead of a bridge, I discovered a tarnished silver comb caught in a tuft of moss.<words>163</words>
The comb pulsed faintly, mirroring constellations above as the slow dance of celestial bodies began its nightly reel.<words>181</words>
Planets bowed, moons curtsied, and I felt my journals inside my pack shuffle like spectators seeking cheaper seats.<words>199</words>
Somewhere between Saturn's dip and Mars's flourish, the comb unfolded into silver threads, weaving the missing bridge before my eyes.<words>219</words>
I stepped onto it, each plank echoing interviews I had recorded, chants I had half-believed, promises I had swallowed.<words>238</words>
Halfway across, a silhouette formed from mistâ€”a movement made flesh, wearing banners stitched from yesterday's slogans.<words>254</words>
It spoke with voices of picket lines and petitions, accusing me of arching critique without releasing commitment.<words>271</words>
The allegation stung sharper than any broken arrowhead, because disinterest, however passionate, is still retreat.<words>286</words>
I answered by nocking the tarnished comb to my bow as if it were an impossible arrow.<words>303</words>
I confronted the effigy, releasing the makeshift shaft into its vaporous chest and watching threads of regret unravel skyward.<words>322</words>
The bridge shivered, then steadied, as though approval required a wound first.<words>334</words>
Around me the celestial choreography slowed further, granting a hush wide enough to shelter a resolve.<words>350</words>
I vowed to chronicle again, but this time to remain beyond the applause, to live inside the aftermath.<words>368</words>
The vow straightened my bow, and the bridge's silver planks rearranged into pages eager for ink.<words>384</words>
I stepped off on the far side, carrying both comb and commitment, as water kept racing upward behind me.<words>403</words>
Some journeys end downward; mine begins in ascent, traced by the handwriting of regret reversed into possibility.<words>420</words>
