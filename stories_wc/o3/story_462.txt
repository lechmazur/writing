Riven, a town-weary traveler, trudged along the salt-scarred boardwalk toward the abandoned carnival house of mirrors. <words>16</words>
He sought shelter as much as he sought a way to escape the confines of one's mind that clanged inside him. <words>37</words>
Night painted the glassy maze with hammered repose, dim starlight bruised by cloud like iron left cooling after the forge. <words>57</words>
A single stained glass panel, propped against a warped doorway, glimmered despite the dark, catching stray surf lightning. <words>75</words>
Its mosaics formed a cradle of sparks, tiny prisms birthing colors that fizzed like secret thoughts finding oxygen. <words>93</words>
Riven touched the warm glass and felt patterns pulse intentionally accidental, as if fate misfired on purpose to create freedom. <words>113</words>
The touch awakened a soft clang, not from within the funhouse, but via the tapping of a metal sign swinging in coastal wind. <words>136</words>
Each tap echoed through broken corridors, sounded again by mirrors that multiplied every noise into dissonant choir. <words>153</words>
Riven followed the reverberation, longing to be many versions of himself, so one might finally breathe without worry. <words>171</words>
Mirrors bent his reflection into spirals, but within each spiral flickered the stained glass cradle, raining chromatic embers over his silhouettes. <words>192</words>
He realized the mirage showed possible thoughts, and if he chose one, it might fertilize reality like a seed in thawing soil. <words>214</words>
Yet every choice required a promise, and promises frightened him more than monsters once rumored to haunt carnival nights. <words>233</words>
He paused in a narrow alcove where two mirrors faced each other, reflections cascading to impossible distance like postponed confessions. <words>253</words>
There, the coastal sign's persistent tapping slowed, synchronizing with his breath, and silence gathered in the hush before someone finally says, "I love you". <words>277</words>
In that pocket of stillness, he whispered the words himself, not to a lover but to the fractured chambers of his head. <words>299</words>
Glass and mirror shook; sparks from the stained cradle poured outward, knitting every reflection into one breathing figure that resembled hope. <words>320</words>
The figure looked at him with eyes made of kaleidoscope shards and said softly, You have been everywhere but here. <words>340</words>
Understanding landed like gulls on tidefoam, intentionally accidental yet fully present, and the traveler felt his skull-harbored carnival unlock. <words>359</words>
He stepped through the stained glass panel, which swung open like a painted gate, and the mirrors went dark behind him. <words>380</words>
Outside, the metal sign settled, the coastal wind exhaling its last verse, and the night felt uncluttered, almost newborn. <words>399</words>
Riven inhaled brine and distant carnival sugar, realizing he could wander further now that his mind no longer dragged chains. <words>419</words>
He headed east along the shore, carrying the cradle of sparks within his chest, a guiding interior lighthouse lit forever. <words>439</words>
