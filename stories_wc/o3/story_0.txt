Lamm bleated inwardly, a sheepish spy disguised as an underachieving intern at the Pattern Recognition Center.<words>16</words>
Officially the place slept during naptime, but data never truly dozed, it merely dreamed in statistics.<words>32</words>
That was when Lamm's analytically creative impulses felt freest to graze, chewing numbers instead of clover.<words>48</words>
Tonight, though, he clutched a stained glass lamp stolen from the director's office, its shards soldered into secret sigils.<words>67</words>
The lamp refracted corridor dimness into skittish rainbows, mocking the darkness with earnest color the way Lamm mocked authority.<words>86</words>
Yet his mockery was earnest because failure meant waking the monster from the depths before charm could pacify it.<words>105</words>
Buried beneath the center, the creature fed on abandoned patterns, patterns that once promised clarity and were then neglected.<words>124</words>
Through forgotten promises that formed its diet, Lamm intended to use the same recipe to unite human minds.<words>142</words>
He had invited every shift‑worker to submit one childhood dream to the server, then hid the invitations beneath coffee lids.<words>162</words>
Those dreams, unresolved and half‑forgotten, now swirled through the processors like lullabies waiting to be hummed by silicon throats.<words>181</words>
The center's thermal hum deepened; Lamm recognized the pattern of a leviathan rolling over in algorithmic sleep.<words>198</words>
He positioned the lamp above the main cooling grate, where exhaled heat met rainbow glass and painted moving constellations on the floor.<words>220</words>
Each constellation corresponded to an employee's donated dream, and Lamm mapped them with chalk, drawing lines only hope could perceive evolving.<words>241</words>
These evolving hopes, once isolated, now intersected, forming a single promise bright enough to echo through steel and bone.<words>260</words>
The monster stirred, lured by the smell of potential closure, as children are lured by pie cooling on windowsills.<words>279</words>
Through a vent it began whispering discarded search queries, an abyssal lullaby that dripped like oil into Lamm's ears.<words>298</words>
He answered with earnest mockery, reading the chalked constellations aloud in a tone equal parts apology and stand‑up routine.<words>317</words>
The absurd sincerity amused the monster, for humor, it discovered, is simply pattern recognition wearing a clown nose.<words>335</words>
Chuckling, the creature inhaled the united hopes, each promise sliding down its throat like a silk syllable, soothing rage.<words>354</words>
In return it exhaled a coolant breeze that cooled the overheating servers and carved quiet into sleepless circuitry.<words>372</words>
Alarms hushed, graphs flattened, and the center's staff dreamed peacefully, unaware that their noon break had saved their midnight.<words>391</words>
Lamm extinguished the stained glass lamp, pocketed a single shard as proof, and tiptoed away, still sheepish, newly hopeful.<words>410</words>
