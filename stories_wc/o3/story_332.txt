Jun Weaver, a solitary painter, floated on magnetic boots along the rim of the exo-atmospheric garden, seeking color in vacuum silence. <words>21</words>
The flowers engineered to burn with auroras swayed without wind, reminding him of canvases abandoned between borrowed books back on Earth. <words>42</words>
He opened his battered notepad, its pages crisped by cosmic rays, and traced ghosts of hues nobody else could witness. <words>62</words>
The act was fiercely gentle, as though each graphite whisper sought to resuscitate the very breath that space stole. <words>81</words>
Yet pigment refused to surface, locked behind an invisible membrane of doubt stronger than any pressure dome. <words>98</words>
In frustration, Jun drifted toward the abandoned amphitheater grafted among the vines of satellites, where forgotten performances once saluted multiple moons. <words>119</words>
Behind its dark stage curtains, micro-meteor tears formed constellations of secrecy. <words>130</words>
There he discovered parchment strips, hushed confessions scrawled behind stage curtains by actors who feared returning to daylight. <words>148</words>
Each confession opened a door to realms of surprise, tales of love sprouting in low gravity and grief crystallized inside helmet glass. <words>170</words>
Jun copied their inkless fonts into his notepad, letting the words ferment beside his sketches until the page shimmered with impossible contrast. <words>192</words>
The confessions spoke of intimate separation, the ache of watching horizons recede while still feeling fingerprints on the soul. <words>211</words>
Those phrases wrapped around his heart like thermal foil, amplifying a quiet heat he had denied since exile. <words>229</words>
He realized the amphitheater itself waited to be repainted, to have its silence tuned into chromatic echo. <words>246</words>
To dare a final leap of faith, Jun decided to paint directly with vacuum, letting loose powdered pigments that would never land. <words>268</words>
He punctured the pigment pods, and a nebula unfurled, swirling around the stone seats like resurrected applause. <words>285</words>
As colors orbited, he read one confession aloud: 'My heart stays here even when the shuttle departs'â€”and his voice vibrated the hollow boards. <words>308</words>
The vibration rippled through the garden, coaxing dormant sensors to play forgotten overtures that harmonized with the dust of ultramarine. <words>328</words>
Light, sound, and pigment braided, and the amphitheater's dome projected the resulting mural back toward Earthlike viewers who did not exist. <words>349</words>
In that absence, Jun finally felt accompanied, as though the realms of surprise had chosen him for their witness. <words>368</words>
His fears decompressed, he sealed the notepad inside a buoyant capsule and launched it on a solar tide, trusting strangers to finish the conversation. <words>392</words>
Then he turned off his boots and stepped from the garden's edge, letting the nebula carry him into untitled darkness, canvas at last. <words>415</words>
