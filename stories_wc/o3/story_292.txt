In the hush of midnight, Veris crept down the cracked stairwell toward the underground speakeasy. <words>15</words>
Though branded a hesitant raider, he still chose targets where stories clung like dust to bottles. <words>31</words>
Tonight, rumor promised a trove of narrative relics hidden behind the bar's velvet drape. <words>45</words>
Veris carried nothing but a simple mug, chipped yet polished, his talisman against greed's louder tools. <words>61</words>
He believed one could fill a vessel with tales, then drink them slowly to remember. <words>76</words>
That stubbornly open-minded creed let him enter the crowd of smugglers and poets without drawing steel. <words>92</words>
Smoke curled like half-told epics while a battered piano hammered syncopated confessions. <words>104</words>
Onstage, the proprietor announced the venue's diversion: an annual family talent show, disguised as cabaret. <words>119</words>
Families of fugitives performed to prove loyalty, each act wagering secrets instead of applause. <words>133</words>
Veris felt the room's restless trust, that fragile pact between watchful strangers daring to speak truthfully. <words>149</words>
He signed the performer ledger with a borrowed quill before his doubt could mitigate the impulse. <words>165</words>
His act, he wrote, would be 'Cartography of Broken Things'. <words>175</words>
When his turn arrived, he stepped beneath the single bulb and raised the simple mug like a lantern. <words>193</words>
He began practicing the art of storytelling the way elders once mapped rivers—by tracing memory's shoreline aloud. <words>210</words>
Every shard of the past became a coordinate: mother’s lullaby, father’s betrayal, sister’s laughter cracked by war. <words>227</words>
He tilted the mug, letting invisible liquid spill on the stage, sketching glistening lines only listeners could perceive. <words>245</words>
Gasps confirmed they saw the phantom map form, connecting private pain into shared geography. <words>259</words>
The proprietor, startled, recognized a route rumored to lead beyond the city’s quarantine walls. <words>273</words>
Murmured oaths rose as patrons realized he offered escape, not entertainment. <words>284</words>
Veris sensed danger but also possibility; the crowd’s faith could finally mitigate his own reluctance to lead. <words>301</words>
He promised them coordinates at dawn if they contributed their fragments to complete the map. <words>316</words>
One by one, performers poured memories into the mug—songs, confessions, profanity—each expanding the shimmering cartography. <words>331</words>
Veris shook, overwhelmed by the weight he had invited, yet stubbornly open-minded enough to accept it. <words>347</words>
In that dim hour he understood raiding was never about stealing objects but liberating untold routes within people. <words>365</words>
The speakeasy lights flickered, and outside, sirens wailed like critics displeased with an unfinished tale. <words>380</words>
Bracing, Veris tucked the mug under his coat, trusting the assembled storytellers would follow him into legend. <words>397</words>
Together they slipped through a secret hatch, when midnight finally exhaled its last breath. <words>411</words>
