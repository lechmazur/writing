I arrived at the wind‑swept bird rehabilitation sanctuary smelling of peppercorn and hope, the only market spice trader on the volunteer roster.<words>22</words>
Even among screeching kites and hissing gulls, my reputation for being blatantly secretive fluttered louder than broken wings.<words>40</words>
I wasn't there to mend feathers; I was hunting clues to lost technologies whispered about in salt‑spiced bazaars.<words>58</words>
Legend said a vanished engineer once coded aviation secrets into bird songs, then died before demonstrating the impossible contraptions.<words>77</words>
All that remained was a dried flower pressed in a book, hidden somewhere among the sanctuary’s dusty donated library.<words>96</words>
The head keeper, Mara, guided me between flight cages, her cinnamon gaze both inviting and barricaded, promising danger flavored with nostalgia.<words>117</words>
She had agreed to endorse my volunteer status only if I shared any relics I discovered, a pact scratched on receipt paper.<words>139</words>
But in the luminescent aviary, trust and treachery smelled identical—like cloves crushed under bootheels.<words>153</words>
Night fell, and we unlocked the annex holding the sanctuary’s oldest volumes, their spines warped by humid monsoon seasons.<words>172</words>
I fished out a gargantuan ledger whose leather looked reptilian, then slit its silence with a gasp: crayon doodles sprawled across the flyleaf.<words>195</words>
Bright parrots, gears, and spiral propellers cavorted in waxy neon, a child’s palette harnessing undying creativity while mocking age.<words>214</words>
Mara’s breath rose beside me, warm and questioning, as though each pigment were a confession she’d been waiting to hear.<words>234</words>
We turned pages, and the doodles became schematics, arrows leading toward a hollowed rectangle where the dried flower should rest.<words>254</words>
Its absence screamed louder than any cockatoo, implying someone else had followed the same breadcrumb scent of forgotten invention.<words>273</words>
Thunder rattled the roof, and emergency lights flashed crimson, bathing us inside a comic‑book apocalypse.<words>288</words>
Instinctively, we pressed foreheads, sharing a conspiratorial electricity in the second before a life‑changing kiss neither dared initiate.<words>306</words>
That suspended heartbeat birthed a code: her pulse tapped three times, mine answered two, mapping coordinates between cages seventeen and eighteen.<words>327</words>
We sprinted there, boots slapping puddles where injured swifts practiced ground‑level glides.<words>339</words>
Inside a mesh cube, a nest of shredded newspaper cradled the missing flower and a brass cylinder etched with vector equations.<words>360</words>
I tucked the relics into my spice satchel, yet Mara’s hand stayed mine, her eyes demanding a future clause.<words>379</words>
She would travel with me to decipher the cylinder, endorse our perilous pilgrimage, and sell saffron only when money moaned.<words>399</words>
I tasted thunder on her lips as we finally closed that earlier second, edgy nostalgia soldering us to undying creativity and uncharted skies.<words>422</words>
