<story>
As the bronze sun bled over the scorching deserts, an exiled fortress drifted alone, its roughly refined turrets humming against the gusts.<words>22</words>
Inside, a sorrowful apothecary named Eliah catalogued dusted phials while memorizing the taste of vanished family recipes he could no longer mix.<words>44</words>
The fortress served now as the final branch of the Celestial Library, and its doors were scheduled to seal at sunset each night.<words>67</words>
In the last minute before tonight’s closure, Eliah hurried through aisles of hovering codices, searching for one slim volume written in braided smoke.<words>90</words>
The book contained diagrams of ancient dream catchers his grandmother wove from desert thorns, each knot encrypting bifurcate pathways of prophetic thought.<words>112</words>
Legend whispered that decoding those webs could tempt the silent oracle chained beneath the archives to speak again, but only once.<words>133</words>
Eliah’s motive was selfish and holy: he yearned to ask the oracle for the missing ingredient that would resurrect his mother’s healing broth.<words>156</words>
Without it, every cure he brewed tasted of sand and regret, no matter how precisely he stirred with the plastic spoon he kept from childhood.<words>181</words>
He found the volume, its pages fluttering like moth wings, and started decoding the woven patterns recorded in spidery ink.<words>201</words>
Symbols forked and reunited, guiding his mind to bifurcate into waking focus and dreamlike recollection of his grandmother’s voice.<words>220</words>
Painful joy pulsed through him as forgotten aromas, cinnamon and prickly pear, flooded the sterile aisles.<words>236</words>
Lines of script coalesced into coordinates, pointing to a dream catcher left behind in the fortress chapel, its feathers singed but intact.<words>258</words>
He sprinted as the ceiling lamps dimmed to amber, knowing the library doors would lock in less than thirty breaths.<words>278</words>
The catcher dangled above a mosaic of glass scorpions; Eliah lifted it gently, reading each thread like musical notation.<words>297</words>
A final knot unraveled in his sight, releasing a whisper that echoed down the hollow halls and awakened the oracle’s caged mind.<words>319</words>
Stone shelves shivered; the oracle’s voice, cracked yet luminous, slithered from the floor vents and asked what flavor he needed returned to life.<words>342</words>
Eliah knelt, holding his plastic spoon like a relic, and spoke the name of the herb lost when exile tore his clan apart.<words>365</words>
The oracle sighed, exhaling a crystalline seed that drifted into the spoon, sizzling with promise and grief.<words>382</words>
In that instant, the library’s iron gates clanged shut, sealing him inside, but his tears were sweetened by the future he could now distill.<words>406</words>
Alone within the skyborne bastion, he prepared to brew the broth, certain that his family’s love would bifurcate sorrow into remedy and rejoice.<words>429</words>
