Mira moved like a shy flame, an introverted dancer trying not to scorch the silence around her.<words>17</words>  
Silence, however, was rare inside the cipher decoder's office, where brass typewriters rattled out secrets all night.<words>34</words>  
She had taken a clerical post there only during habit forming, hoping monotony might patch the frayed corners of her mind.<words>55</words>  
Instead she found patterns dancing inside every encoded dispatch, beckoning her with teasing, illogically logical steps.<words>71</words>  
To resist, she searched the dusty shelves and discovered a forgotten folio of astronomical charts abandoned by some star‑struck predecessor.<words>91</words>  
The precise constellations, pinned in ink, reminded her that above every code drifted a wider sky the war could not censor.<words>112</words>  
Each noon break she unrolled the charts beside intercepted ciphers and, with a battered knitting needle, traced parallels between stars and syllables.<words>134</words>  
Colleagues assumed she was trying to knit socks for soldiers, but the yarn never grew, only the riddles in her eyes.<words>155</words>  
Through forgotten echoes of lullabies her mother once sang, Mira aligned map and message until secret trajectories appeared like ghostly dance lines.<words>177</words>  
She realized the enemy's coded orders described not troop movements but coordinates of an escape route sketched across the heavens.<words>197</words>  
Beyond that stellar corridor waited a rumored sanctuary, far past the desolate wasteland that had swallowed her childhood village.<words>216</words>  
For the first time in years, purpose pirouetted within her, testing the mental fortitude she had cultivated like muscle memory.<words>236</words>  
To follow the path, Mira needed transportation, rations, and an alibi sturdy enough to fool the ever‑watchful decoding chief.<words>255</words>  
Her plan unfolded as delicately as a solo: she would request field duty to distribute freshly knitted morale pamphlets to border outposts.<words>277</words>  
The pamphlets, innocuous to anyone else, would conceal microfilm copies of the charts, guiding her step by step.<words>295</words>  
Night after night she practiced packing under fifteen seconds, breathing in four counts, out six, perfecting affectionate detachment from everything left behind.<words>317</words>  
The regimen felt like choreography for survival, each motion small yet irrevocable, each repetition braiding intention with calm.<words>335</words>  
When the request was approved, she slipped from the office at dawn, carrying a satchel that clicked softly with needles and star maps.<words>358</words>  
Typewriters clattered a goodbye sequence behind her, punctuation striking like castanets she chose not to answer.<words>374</words>  
Outside, the wasteland's horizon flickered with heat, yet the sky above remained cool, a vaulted promise she intended to climb.<words>394</words>  
She walked, knitting air with her arms to keep rhythm, the illogically logical gesture steadying her nerves.<words>411</words>  
Each mile echoed with memories she refused to own, yet through those forgotten echoes her resolve stayed clear as a constellation.<words>432</words>  
When night finally unfolded, Mira spread the charts beneath the bruised sky and began the long dance toward elsewhere.<words>451</words>
