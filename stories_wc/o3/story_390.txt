Lan Zhu crept along the lacquered corridor of the ancient Chinese palace, calmer than the moon pretending not to look at tides.<words>22</words>
He was the empire's calm assassin, a contradiction brandished like a silent gong.<words>35</words>
Tonight his target was not a beating heart but a prophecy rumored to wander the halls in loose syllables.<words>54</words>
Court scholars claimed the words floated as whispers of longing, able to bend futures the way bamboo bows to snow.<words>74</words>
Lan Zhu planned to spin that prophecy into raw possibility before the first question is asked at tomorrow’s coronation.<words>93</words>
His method, decreed by an extinct guild, required arranging words by the pattern of a butterfly's wings.<words>110</words>
Each syllable would mirror a vein, each pause a spot, until meaning and anatomy amalgamate.<words>125</words>
To steady his hands, he carried a botanical press; the palace gardeners would miss nothing but a few petals by dawn.<words>146</words>
Pressed flowers, he believed, listened better than priests.<words>154</words>
If the petals understood, surely the prophecy would stay politely between their fragrant pages.<words>168</words>
But humor kept tripping over unease, because the scroll he hunted was rumored to answer bad jokes with plagues.<words>187</words>
Lan Zhu, figuratively literal in every contract, had practiced apologizing to parchment in three dialects just in case.<words>205</words>
He entered the jade library, bowing to dusty shelves as though they were elderly relatives at a wedding he intended to rob.<words>227</words>
From between volumes on herbal poisons, a soft voice giggled, then rearranged itself into the prophecy’s opening stanza.<words>245</words>
Whispers of longing, it sighed, bloom where certainty wilts.<words>254</words>
The assassin answered, 'That is beautifully unhelpful,' and set the botanical press open like an eager courtroom.<words>271</words>
Petals awaited cross‑examination, the prophecy awaited arrest, and Lan Zhu awaited a reasonable fee.<words>285</words>
With comedic solemnity he began folding sentences along invisible veins, occasionally scolding a comma for loitering.<words>301</words>
Each alignment pressed future and flora together until the parchment smelled faintly of tomorrow’s anxieties.<words>316</words>
As the final syllable clicked into place, butterfly precise, the air shivered like a joke that knows it will be misunderstood.<words>337</words>
Lan Zhu heard a distant gasp from the throne room, evidence that possibility had just stubbed its toe on reality.<words>357</words>
He closed the press, nodded to the library, and whispered, 'I bill per miracle, my friend,' before gliding away.<words>376</words>
Behind him, petals rustled like assistants gathering laughter, while the prophecy hummed, newly tamed, waiting for the emperor to speak.<words>396</words>
And so, somewhere between bouquet and destiny, the calm assassin walked on, entirely guilty of gardening in the future.<words>415</words>
