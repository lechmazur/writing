<story>
Sable drifted between rusted cargo crates in the space pirate hideout on an asteroid, nursing a drowsy enthusiasm that refused entirely to wake.<words>23</words>
An introverted empath by nature, she tasted the crew's hungers like static on her tongue and kept silent.<words>41</words>
Tonight the captain demanded tribute from every scavenger, and fear, obviously hidden, rattled behind forced laughs.<words>57</words>
Sable fingered a palm‑sized dried starfish threaded on a copper wire around her neck, drawing comfort from its brittle symmetry.<words>77</words>
It had been pried years ago from a seabed perched atop a mountain, wisdom etched into its salt scars like runes.<words>98</words>
That paradox—ocean cresting sky—guided her mission to champion the outcasts of reason among these lawless stars.<words>114</words>
But first she had to marshal more than courage; she needed a plan pirates would misunderstand until too late.<words>133</words>
She opened her toolkit beside a broken puppet the deckhands had kicked apart for sport.<words>148</words>
Through reassembling fragments of a shattered marionette, she meant to build a distraction and a map simultaneously.<words>165</words>
Every splintered limb concealed microfilaments of copied navigation charts, winding like veins toward the smuggled refuge she’d prepared.<words>183</words>
When the puppet danced again, the charts would scatter into waiting pockets of stowaways who trusted nobody but empathy.<words>202</words>
Sable worked by lantern, gears ticking like rain, while the hideout's main hall rattled with songs of plundered moons.<words>221</words>
The closing page of a forgotten journal lay open beneath the marionette, its ink describing an alpine hermit confessing uncertainty between summit and sea.<words>245</words>
Those words bled into Sable’s thoughts, fusing with the starfish creed until mountain wisdom pulsed like low gravity in her chest.<words>266</words>
She felt the pirates’ doubts, small and sharp, as if each were a nail in the boards she refitted.<words>285</words>
By dawn‑cycle, the marionette stood, patched with mismatched wood, obviously hidden data humming inside its lacquered grin.<words>302</words>
Sable carried it to the mess hall where the crew drowsed over stale rum and neon fungi stew.<words>320</words>
With a languid sweep of her wrist, she pulled the control strings, and the puppet bowed, releasing paper petals of starlight charts.<words>342</words>
Gasps flickered like broken holograms, and the outcasts of reason—smugglers, cooks, children born between engines—pocketed routes toward better orbits.<words>361</words>
The captain lunged, but Sable used the sudden darkness to marshal every tremor of shared fear into collective flight.<words>380</words>
Alarms wailed, yet she moved like someone sleepwalking, drowsy enthusiasm guiding her toward the escape shafts.<words>396</words>
Behind her, the marionette collapsed in sparks, its mission complete, its fragments already memorized by those who would spread the tide‑high gospel of altitude.<words>420</words>
And somewhere between ocean and summit, asteroid and star, Sable felt the journal close, but the story breathe on.<words>439</words>
