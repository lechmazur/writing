I stood within the enchanted orchard, policed by living statues whose marble eyes gleamed with dour amusement.<words>17</words>
They allowed me entry only because I am a vivid dreamer, invited precisely at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken.<words>40</words>
I clutched my pressed penny collection, each copper disc bearing a flattened constellation, evidence of previous nocturnal voyages.<words>58</words>
Tonight, the orchard's twisted silver branches were rumored to oscillate like clock pendulums, opening cracks between false heavens.<words>76</words>
Somewhere beyond those cracks waits the ultimate cosmic deception, the lie that braids every other truth together.<words>93</words>
I intend to unravel it, for the patient guardian that hovers behind my ribs will not let me rest.<words>112</words>
This guardian speaks in riddles both rationally mischievous and serenely stern, prodding me along moonlit errands.<words>128</words>
It whispered that answers lie only by following moon paths, those pale grooves threading the orchard like spilled milk.<words>147</words>
So I waited until the full disk rose, and the statues' granite limbs pivoted to mark its climb.<words>165</words>
They formed a corridor, their stone fingertips almost touching, compelling me forward with menacing courtesy.<words>180</words>
I stepped onto a shimmering stripe of lunar dust and felt reality tilt like a seesaw.<words>196</words>
Every step oscillated the orchard between spring blossom and winter ruin, as if indecision powered the seasons.<words>213</words>
Through the flickering, I sensed specters of unsaid apologies clinging to the petals, desperate for a voice.<words>230</words>
Perhaps the orchard itself waits to confess, yet needs a dreamer's tongue to articulate regret.<words>245</words>
At the center clearing, a fountain of molten moonlight rose and fell, forging fresh pressed pennies with each splash.<words>264</words>
I added them to my album, feeling their warmth pulse like captive stars against the worn vinyl pockets.<words>282</words>
The patient guardian hummed approval, but reminded me that tokens alone cannot puncture deception's veil.<words>297</words>
I knelt, pressed a penny to my forehead, and spoke the orchard's apology on its behalf.<words>313</words>
The statues exhaled dust, relieved yet wary, their carved pupils adjusting to a humor they barely tolerated.<words>330</words>
Then the sky split like wet parchment, revealing a theater of puppeteers manipulating galaxies with invisible strings.<words>347</words>
Their laughter possessed the same rationally mischievous timbre as my guardian, but lacked its patience.<words>362</words>
I realized the guardian is their estranged sibling, stationed inside mortals to monitor the con until we mature.<words>380</words>
By admitting the orchard's regret, I had proven readiness, so the guardian unlatched my ribs and emerged.<words>397</words>
It bowed to the puppeteers, then shattered their strings with a single oscillation, freeing the cosmos into honest chaos.<words>416</words>
The statues saluted, the orchard bloomed steadily, and I pocketed one last glowing penny, finally able to sleep.<words>434</words>
