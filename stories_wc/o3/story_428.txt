Rajiv Malhotra, once the proud city planner of Pune, now scouted ruins as a secretive doomsday prepper searching for certainty. <words>20</words>
Dawn bathed the ancient Indian temple of Bhairav in leaking gold as he entered through a cracked lintel. <words>38</words>
Every footstep echoed like a reminder of the blueprints he had abandoned after bureaucracy debased his idealistic designs. <words>56</words>
He had vowed to banish doubt with unyielding will, yet doubt clung like humid dust to his throat. <words>74</words>
Under the main shrine flickered a small oil lamp beside an antique ink blotter, its brass edges greened by centuries of monsoon breath. <words>97</words>
Rajiv had stolen the blotter from the municipal archives, believing its forgotten owner had also sketched worlds but refused to chain them. <words>119</words>
On the temple floor he unrolled maps of night sky fragments he called 'broken constellations' and studied their fractures for strategy. <words>140</words>
Where others read omens, he read escape routes, convinced geometry of heaven could free him from self-imposed chains of failed civic ideals. <words>162</words>
Still, the astronomer's discipline felt rarely authentic in his anxious hands because he feared templates more than chaos. <words>180</words>
A soft cough behind a pillar announced Vijay Deshmukh, a land baron whose handshake with Rajiv would soon seal a hidden deal. <words>202</words>
Deshmukh wanted the temple complex converted into luxury bunkers, and he needed Rajiv's secret diagrams of subterranean aquifers. <words>220</words>
Rajiv craved the baron's stockpiled grain and lithium batteries; each man came to debase heritage for survival. <words>237</words>
At the second their palms touched, time felt soldered, and muffled thunder rolled across broken constellations sketched on the floor. <words>257</words>
Lightning poured through the collapsed roof, illuminating the blotter which now bled fresh ink as if awakened. <words>274</words>
Ink seeped along grooves, forming a map identical to the sky shards, pointing toward a tunnel etched beneath Nataraja's feet. <words>294</words>
Rajiv realized the temple itself had always offered the exodus he sought, but only to those willing to rewrite agreements. <words>314</words>
With daring caution he retracted his hand, leaving Deshmukh grasping emptiness, and stepped back onto the starlit floor plans. <words>333</words>
He spoke of a different contract, one between sky and stone, where resources were shared, not hoarded, and survival meant collective flight. <words>355</words>
The baron scoffed, calling him sentimental, but thunder cracked open more ceiling and constellations collapsed like judgment. <words>372</words>
Rajiv grabbed the glowing blotter, slid into the revealed tunnel, and whispered a vow to never again let false plans imprison truth. <words>394</words>
Behind him, stones sealed the passage, echoing like ink stamps finalizing the only authentic blueprint he would ever need. <words>413</words>
Below the temple, Rajiv followed the blotter's luminous script, escaping his self-imposed chains with each deliberate, star-aligned step into darkness. <words>433</words>
