The witch's greenhouse clung to the ragged hill of gravestones like a mossy barnacle, trembling in the twilight breeze.<words>19</words>
Inside, Percival Quill--the most uptight scribe the Royal Archive had ever regretted hiring--clutched his notebook with white knuckles.<words>37</words>
He had ventured here seeking a prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop, rumored to glow with truths unspoken.<words>55</words>
The witch demanded payment not in coins but in answers, and answers were Percival's stingiest currency.<words>71</words>
She had sealed her questions in an antique envelope, then ripped it open and burned the slip inside, leaving only stubborn flecks of adhesive.<words>95</words>
If Percival could read the residue, she promised, the bulb would be his.<words>108</words>
Certainly uncertain, he began his work, inspecting the sticky grains with a jeweler's loupe and a prayer he refused to admit was hope.<words>131</words>
By analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope, he reconstructed the question: 'How does one cradle empathy in arms of steel?'<words>153</words>
Percival tried to bellow the answer, because librarians are trained to be heard across echoing archives, yet the greenhouse swallowed his voice in damp leaves.<words>178</words>
So he whispered instead, allowing the words to sprout like seedlings: 'One writes margins wide enough for another's grief to breathe.'<words>199</words>
The witch smiled, a small crack in decades of marble sneer, and handed him the soot-smudged bulb.<words>216</words>
Its filament flickered, then steadied, reflecting gravestones through glass like runes preparing to turn the page of the earth.<words>235</words>
In the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, Percival felt his rigid spine loosen as if unscrewed by warm light.<words>256</words>
The quiet transformation began not with thunder but with the gentlest hum, buried optimism thawing beneath his ink-stained ribs.<words>275</words>
He realized the witch had never cared for his literal reading; she required someone disciplined enough to feel without drowning.<words>295</words>
Holding the glowing heirloom against his chest, he stepped outside, where moonlight smeared the hilltop stones like half-erased sentences.<words>314</words>
Each grave he passed seemed to inhale, soothed by the promise that even cataloguers can offer tribute beyond catalogues.<words>333</words>
Back at the archive, his colleagues would sneer at the dirt on his cuffs, but they would read the new annotations trembling between his lines.<words>358</words>
Those notes, lit by Tesla's impossible filament, would speak softly yet ring louder than any bellow, mapping sorrow beside hope like twin constellations.<words>381</words>
And somewhere on that ragged hill, the witch would prune her vines, certain only of uncertainty, while her greenhouse glowed with a scribe's steady resilience.<words>406</words>
