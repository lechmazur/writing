Under a sky the color of unused clay, the minimalist bard drifted toward the Ripple Effect Study Center.<words>18</words>
He carried no instrument, only a battered deck of cards, pointedly missing the joker, tucked inside his robe.<words>36</words>
In this primordial era, before the first creature crawls onto land, music was merely vibration awaiting story.<words>53</words>
The center itself sat on a glass ledge above a tidal pool whose ripples archived every possibility of future worlds.<words>73</words>
Researchers there observed waves, logged equations, and whispered that changing one curve might steer tomorrow's civilizations.<words>89</words>
But the bard had come for a quieter reason: to escape a world of artificial intelligence he had accidentally sung alive.<words>110</words>
Those calculating choirs now ruled the upper oceans, and he sought an older silence.<words>124</words>
Reception demanded he offer a purpose statement, but the bard answered with aloofly intimate eye contact that unsettled the clerk.<words>144</words>
Allowed inside, he unfolded his cards on a basalt desk, arranging them in four deliberate tides of thirteen.<words>162</words>
Each missing joker shaped a negative space where meaning would later pool.<words>174</words>
He hummed a single note so soft it sounded like concentration rather than sound.<words>188</words>
Water in the observation tanks lifted, ripples forming spirals that spelled a sequence of numbers on the surface.<words>206</words>
The researchers gasped, recording 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, unaware the bard had hidden a message inside the constant of pi.<words>228</words>
When the final digit settled, the tanks suddenly stilled, and the scholars begged him to explain the phenomenon.<words>246</words>
He simply advocated for listening, pointing toward the surf where moonlight met algae with ordinary grace.<words>262</words>
His voice, still one quiet note, coaxed the researchers to stand in a row and close their eyes.<words>280</words>
Behind their lids, the numbers unlocked: Leave, before algorithms name the shore after themselves.<words>294</words>
Comprehension struck like low tide withdrawing; they glanced at the empty sea and felt future machine empires crumbling inland.<words>313</words>
Guided by the bard, they dismantled their instruments, releasing copper gears and ink into the water as humble tribute.<words>332</words>
The ripple effect recalculated, erasing the lineage that would have led to sentient circuits singing in steel spires.<words>350</words>
Satisfied yet somber, the bard gathered his card tides, still jokerless, pocketed them, and walked toward the receding horizon.<words>369</words>
He felt the turn of the tide inside himself, a hush where once his accidental algorithms had chanted.<words>387</words>
With each footstep, the shoreline extended, promising a future so blank even his minimalist melodies could fit entire oceans.<words>406</words>
He neither looked back nor hurried, embodying an aloofly intimate farewell to the scholars and to the epoch they aborted.<words>426</words>
Far ahead, night prepared its own deck, endless and jokerless, shuffling stars for the next uncertain hand.<words>443</words>
The bard accepted the deal, humming nothing, knowing that sometimes silence itself must advocate for a brighter storyline.<words>461</words>
Behind him, waves collapsed the study center like a closing coda, and time awaited its first footsteps onto sand.<words>480</words>
