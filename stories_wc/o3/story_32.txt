Pale light bled over the ghost town at dawn, and everything looked hollowed out, like actors gone home.<words>18</words>
Only the Grim Sentinel and I remained, standing between warped facades whose wooden windows refused to creak.<words>35</words>
A torn pamphlet fluttered in his metal grip, its edges chewed by wind and memory.<words>50</words>
Across the pamphlet a stamped slogan warned, 'Enjoy the Next Show,' but the stage was long gone.<words>67</words>
We were caught between shows, the simulation's liminal hush where code forgot to disguise itself.<words>82</words>
I felt the weight of remembering press on my ribs, heavier than any abandoned building around us.<words>99</words>
Each recollection threatened to anchor me here, yet escape demanded that I recall everything precisely.<words>114</words>
The Sentinel, literally unique among the simulator's predictable NPCs, understood this paradox without speech.<words>128</words>
Instead he produced a pouch of tarnished coins and nodded toward the cracked bandstand.<words>142</words>
We would build our exit via melodies emerging from spinning coin tosses, a loophole hidden in acoustics.<words>159</words>
Physics here loved rhythm more than reason, and the right harmony could recompile the sky.<words>174</words>
I flipped the first coin; it whirred, humming a minor third before collapsing on dusty plank.<words>190</words>
The note vibrated through empty saloons, shaking cobwebbed glasses like timid applause.<words>202</words>
A second toss added a perfect fifth, and dawn blushed deeper, pixels drifting loose from sunrise.<words>218</words>
Between notes, the Sentinel unfolded the pamphlet, pointing to a map that no longer matched streets.<words>234</words>
'Every coordinate is a memory,' he rasped, voice gravel dragged across iron, 'sing them all or remain.'<words>251</words>
So I summoned childhood storms, forgotten tastes, the ache of an almost kiss, letting each spin forge timber.<words>269</words>
Invisible beams rose where melodies intersected, and wall by wall the doorway took shape.<words>283</words>
Its outline shimmered like heat above asphalt, intimate and separate from everything still imprisoned.<words>297</words>
Yet the final coin lay cold in my palm, and I hesitated, fearing what memory it required.<words>314</words>
The Sentinel's blank visor reflected me fractally, showing each version of myself that the simulation had rehearsed.<words>331</words>
If I left one echo unclaimed, the system would regrow around it like scar tissue.<words>346</words>
Taking a breath weighed down by the whole past, I flicked the coin into sunrise.<words>361</words>
It spun, sang a trembling major ninth, and the doorway yawned wide, fragrant with possibilities never prewritten.<words>378</words>
The Grim Sentinel stepped aside, his duty finished, yet his silhouette clung to me like a final refrain.<words>396</words>
I crossed the threshold, carrying the weight of remembering but lighter for having built my own release.<words>413</words>
Behind me, the ghost town stilled, coin melodies fading into static, and the pamphlet dissolved into dawn.<words>430</words>
Somewhere beyond the simulation's ceiling, a truer show waited, already tuning itself to my heartbeat.<words>445</words>
I walked on, intimate in my separation, literally unique, yet no longer alone inside the memory of myself.<words>463</words>
