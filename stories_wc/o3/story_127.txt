Cyan Bramble tuned the cracked brass gears of his one‑man calliope in the velveteen gloom of the Obsidian Lantern, a steampunk lounge tucked under Regent Bridge. <words>26</words>
Business was slow, and between calls for encores he juggled silence instead of knives. <words>40</words>
He was a street performer with a secret heavy enough to drown music. <words>53</words>
His pocket carried a rusted knight’s gauntlet, five dented fingers whispering of old wars and older regrets. <words>70</words>
Once he had stripped it from the hand of Lady Grisham, the imperial mime who now pledged to silence him forever. <words>91</words>
Tonight he wished to offer peace to his sworn adversary, but inspiration jammed like rust in his throat. <words>109</words>
He felt creatively blocked, every melody collapsing into coughs of steam. <words>120</words>
Cyan’s only remaining tool was remembrance, and he hunted memory the way pickpockets hunt watches. <words>135</words>
Closing his eyes, he ran his fingertips across the gauntlet, its pitted metal oddly akin to the texture of a coral reef he had explored as a child. <words>163</words>
Via the texture of a coral reef, he could remember brightness, salt, and forgiveness, and the blocked gates of his mind creaked. <words>185</words>
A new tune surfaced, coded desperation flowing through its minor valves, begging yet disguising the plea within. <words>202</words>
He wound the calliope and let the melody breathe between calls, threading through brass pipes like contrition through a confessional. <words>222</words>
From the velvet curtains emerged Lady Grisham, face painted porcelain white, movements sharp as semaphore. <words>237</words>
Cyan extended the gauntlet toward her, palm up like an unrusted promise, while his music laid bare a trust renewed. <words>257</words>
Her gloved hand hovered, trembling with the pull of vendetta and the ache of surrender. <words>272</words>
The patrons, clockwork monocles clicking, hushed to hear the unsung lyrics welded into the air. <words>287</words>
In the silence after the last note, Grisham touched the gauntlet, and gears somewhere deep within both hearts meshed. <words>306</words>
Her eyes widened, reading the coded desperation he had etched into cadence, and she nodded once, the gesture faint yet seismic. <words>327</words>
The truce was not spoken, but the Obsidian Lantern’s pressure gauges relaxed, and breath again seemed possible. <words>344</words>
Cyan exhaled steam and relief, feeling the weight beneath his ribs lighten like seawater lifting a shipwreck. <words>361</words>
Between new calls, he packed the now unburdened calliope, uncertain whether the peace would endure but certain he had played the only song that could. <words>386</words>
Outside, gaslights hissed in autumn rain, and the street performer with a secret stepped onto the slick cobbles, the gauntlet left behind on the stage as collateral for tomorrow. <words>415</words>
