Rusted solar sails creaked as the recycled spaceship drifted above the ghostly lattice of abandoned trade lanes.<words>17</words>
Inside, Rhys the selfless musician tuned silence itself, coaxing melody from absence with savage grace.<words>32</words>
He had bartered away applause centuries ago, accepting only passage and instruments made from other eras' refuse.<words>49</words>
The captain hired him to map migration patterns of star-whales whose routes spanned across centuries of longing.<words>66</words>
Musical echolocation, the captain claimed, could chart beasts no sensor dared pin.<words>78</words>
Rhys accepted because every note he released left an intangibly tangible imprint on the cosmos, the mark of trust.<words>97</words>
Only entities who felt that vibration would reveal their hidden paths willingly.<words>109</words>
Tonight, however, the hold rattled with a different music: the overlapping hum of mismatched wind chimes scavenged from ruined worlds.<words>129</words>
The chimes were not his; they belonged to Kestrel, a cartographer whose eyes measured betrayal in microns.<words>146</words>
Kestrel coveted Rhys's warped vinyl record, the last archive of extinct whale-songs pressed before oceans boiled.<words>162</words>
Within its grooves slept coordinates uncorrupted by time dilation, treasures worth coups.<words>174</words>
Rhys found Kestrel poised over his berth, gloves of magnetic filament reaching for the artifact.<words>189</words>
With savage grace he lunged, not to harm, but to shield the warped vinyl record beneath his ribs.<words>207</words>
The sudden clash sent the chimes into a frenzy, their overlapping hum phasing through bulkheads like liquid thunder.<words>225</words>
Star-whales, hundreds of kilometers away, answered the call with subsonic moans that warped navigation feeds.<words>240</words>
Alarms blossomed, but Rhys heard only opportunity.<words>247</words>
He offered Kestrel the needle of his portable gramophone, a pact sealed not on paper but on resonance.<words>265</words>
Play the record with me, he said, and let the whales write the map we both crave.<words>282</words>
She hesitated, palm hovering like an eclipse, then slid the needle into the scarred groove.<words>297</words>
The sound that spilled was intangibly tangible, a vibration you could swallow yet never hold.<words>312</words>
Data-glyphs bloomed across the bridge's viewports, tracing migration patterns through folded dimensions where instruments failed.<words>327</words>
Rhys felt the mark of trust settle between them, neither contract nor confession, just sound made flesh.<words>344</words>
Kestrel surrendered her charts, layering them beneath the whale-song so future travelers would inherit a living map.<words>361</words>
Together they steered the recycled spaceship along the newborn route, each note guiding a lunge through darkness toward light.<words>380</words>
Behind them, wind chimes quieted, satisfied, and the star-whales spiraled in luminous pods like guardians of forgiven desire.<words>398</words>
Across centuries of longing, their duet would echo, an anthem of savage grace charting the cosmos in trust.<words>416</words>
