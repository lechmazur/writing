In the last flicker of a guttering lantern, the floating rock dojo drifted across the violet stratosphere.<words>17</words>
Petals trailed in its wake like funerary confetti, arranged by Orrin, the morbid florist-in-residence.<words>31</words>
His neutrally passionate gaze surveyed the levitating courtyard where bonsai boulders practiced silent katas.<words>45</words>
Orrin’s craft had never been about beauty but about negotiating with decay.<words>57</words>
Tonight, however, Master Zhen summoned him for a purpose that obliged even his somber expertise.<words>72</words>
The old master believed the dojo’s orbit was slipping, mirroring cosmic cycles Orrin yearned to understand.<words>88</words>
Yet Orrin’s tempered beliefs warned him that knowledge often blooms only where mourning has taken root.<words>104</words>
He carried a plain white candle, unlit, its wax smelling faintly of cold chalk and promises deferred.<words>121</words>
Master Zhen bowed, boldly timid, as if brass spirit and porcelain doubt shared a single spine.<words>137</words>
“The ledger of our sky is clogged,” the master whispered, gesturing toward a trunk bristling with yellowing papers.<words>155</words>
Within lay the backlog of typed pages in a writer’s trunk—astral maintenance manuals penned by monks long dead.<words>173</words>
Orrin was to read, prune, and ignite understanding before the dojo drifted into oblivion.<words>187</words>
He obliged, fingers petal-soft yet grave, extracting sheets like stems ready for arrangement.<words>200</words>
Each page described planetary respirations, tides of stone, and intervals when lanterns must dim so galaxies might breathe.<words>218</words>
The instructions required a floral offering at the moment the dojo’s lantern surrendered its last glow.<words>234</words>
Orrin trimmed midnight orchids, their fragrance reminiscent of freshly turned earth, and placed them around the unlit candle.<words>252</words>
He then struck flint, but instead of lighting wax, he scorched the edges of a chosen page.<words>269</words>
Smoke spiraled upward, weaving with drifting petals, forming calligraphy that only sorrow could read.<words>283</words>
Master Zhen closed his eyes as the dojo shuddered, settling into a steadier orbit like a heart accepting loss.<words>302</words>
The guttering lantern emitted its final sigh; darkness perched on the rafters, attentive, respectful.<words>316</words>
In that hush, Orrin finally lit the plain white candle, letting its modest flame inherit the night.<words>333</words>
The wax pooled like clarified grief, revealing within its glow faint diagrams of celestial bloom and wilt.<words>350</words>
Orrin saw the cycles—not circles but petals opening and falling, reappearing upon wider spirals.<words>364</words>
His tempered beliefs adjusted, not shattered, as he realized decay was merely the cosmos practicing renewal.<words>380</words>
Neutrally passionate still, he vowed to tend both blossoms and ashes, guiding the dojo through future dusk and dawn.<words>399</words>
Somewhere beyond the violet clouds, a new lantern waited to gutter.<words>410</words>
