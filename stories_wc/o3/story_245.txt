I was jogging laps across the abandoned spaceport flight deck when Ravax the irate smuggler finally cornered me.<words>18</words>
His breath formed abstractly physical clouds, as though anger had granted steam a spine.<words>32</words>
In his gloved fist he clutched a single chopstick, painted black to match the dead runway lights.<words>49</words>
I slowed, because you do not sprint past a man who can smuggle plasma rifles with only a chopstick.<words>68</words>
He snarled that his cargo was gone, and that my fortune telling had led him to ruin.<words>85</words>
I tasted coppery night air and answered with biting sincerity, 'The leaves do not lie; they reveal revolt.'<words>103</words>
Ravax spat, demanding to see the heart's revolt he claimed pulsed behind my tranquil predictions.<words>118</words>
So we jogged together, hostile pacers, until sweat patterned the dust like hidden constellations between shattered shuttle hulls.<words>136</words>
Each lap I halted by my dented thermos, poured tea, and swirled leaves across the surface.<words>152</words>
The patterns were jagged rivers diverging toward dark valleys, always ending at a pair of slanted symbols.<words>169</words>
'Waterfalls,' I translated, putting sincerity where hope should have been.<words>179</words>
Water falling meant cargo falling, I explained, meaning someone had dumped his contraband into secret cataracts below the desert.<words>198</words>
The chopstick quivered between his fingers, more wand than utensil, and I felt the flight deck listening.<words>215</words>
I told him the waterfalls were why I jogged here nightly, mapping resonance under metal panels with my feet.<words>234</words>
'Your heart revolts against vacuum,' I said, 'so follow its tremor downward and reclaim what sinks.'<words>250</words>
He barked laughter, but sincerity has fangs, and the words bit deeper than threats.<words>264</words>
Ravax ordered me to memorialize my vision, swearing no bullet would detour prophecy.<words>277</words>
I knelt, tore a panel loose, and spread tea leaves in the exposed circuitry like graveside flowers.<words>294</words>
The leaves adhered to oily capacitors, arranging themselves into waterfalls plunging off schematic cliffs.<words>308</words>
Electricity hummed agreement, and a hidden hatch unclasped with a sigh older than orbit.<words>322</words>
Below, coolant cascaded like mist, and crates labeled 'LUNAR PEONIES' floated beside real, roaring water diverted from terraforming pipes.<words>341</words>
Ravax stared, the chopstick slipping from his grasp, its fall punctuated by distant thunder of liquid freedom.<words>358</words>
His anger drained, replaced by something raw and awkward, as if his veins finally rerouted toward the waterfalls.<words>376</words>
He whispered that smugglers never jog, yet he began running, chasing echoes instead of profits.<words>391</words>
I remained topside, listening to splashes and discarded curses, until the heart's revolt rang louder than engines ever had.<words>410</words>
Then I resumed my jogging, tracing orbit-sized circles on the deck, memorializing change with every pounding footfall.<words>427</words>
