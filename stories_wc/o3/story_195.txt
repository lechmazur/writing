<story>
Dust devils pirouetted around the nomad caravan as dawn pried open the desert like a reluctant eye. <words>17</words>
Among the canvas wagons trudged Ghalib, a forlorn roustabout whose smile had long ago unhitched itself. <words>33</words>
He carried a small spool of thread, palm-sweaty, as though it were a compass whispering northward secrets. <words>50</words>
The thread's origin, and destination, lay balanced on the edge of curiosity that gnawed at him nightly. <words>67</words>
Caravan elders, analytically unpredictable in their omens, had told him the spool awaited a masterwork stitch. <words>83</words>
Yet Ghalib suspected the stitch was not for cloth but for humanity, perhaps even his own unraveling life. <words>101</words>
A spring cleaning season swept the camp; rugs were beaten, pots scoured, memories shaken from brittle corners. <words>118</words>
Throughout spring cleaning, he volunteered to haul refuse, believing that discarded scraps mapped the heart’s dim alleys. <words>135</words>
Every twilight he would sprint beyond the circle of wagons, chasing silhouettes no one else acknowledged. <words>151</words>
He charted their vanishing arcs by tracking moon trails, thin silver smudges sliding over dune crests. <words>167</words>
Numbers, footfalls, and star angles accumulated inside his notebook like sand inside a burial jar. <words>182</words>
Patterns remained elusive, and that elusiveness tasted of joyful sorrow, as if yearning itself were sweet wine spilt. <words>200</words>
One midnight, the moon burned tangerine, and the silhouettes resolved into a child weaving ribbons of starlight. <words>217</words>
The child danced atop a dune, laughing with a voice older than caravans, younger than tomorrow. <words>233</words>
Ghalib approached, but his throat knotted; he raised the spool as offering, unsure whether to speak or bow. <words>251</words>
The luminous child touched the thread and it unspooled skyward, sewing constellations into a cradle above them. <words>268</words>
In the stitched cradle hung memories Ghalib had buried: chasing kites, splashing mud, pies stolen, lullabies forgiven. <words>285</words>
Tears blurred the dunes, and he felt the child within his hardened heart stir like a waking sparrow. <words>303</words>
Why show me this, he asked, voice cracked open. <words>312</words>
Because threads mend only what seeks mending, the child answered, analytically unpredictable in cadence yet undeniably tender. <words>329</words>
Ghalib realized the caravan’s rubbish, the moon trails, even the elders’ riddles had spiralled toward this single stitch. <words>347</words>
He threaded his memories through the spool, knotting them to the cradle until silence hummed with newborn wonder. <words>365</words>
When dawn returned, the child faded into daylight, leaving only a single gleaming footstep that pointed homeward. <words>382</words>
Ghalib walked back, carrying nothing but lightness, ready to teach the caravan how to stitch their dawns. <words>399</words>
The spool, now empty, gleamed like proof that joyful sorrow can finish sewing and still remain threadless. <words>416</words>
