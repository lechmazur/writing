The hush that follows the final siren drapes the Vanishing Point Gallery like a grimy stage curtain.<words>17</words>
Detective Mara Estrada, proudly underpaid and catastrophically overworked, stands center floor, pretending exhaustion is an aesthetic choice.<words>34</words>
Her eyes, confidently unsure, skim the chipped marble, as if clues might apologize for existing.<words>49</words>
They never do, but sarcasm is free, so she spends it like counterfeit confetti.<words>63</words>
Somewhere between the shattered skylight and the neon horizon, a single playing card leans against a pedestal, daring her to blink.<words>84</words>
The card is the Queen of Hearts, fittingly smug, because love always arrives late to its own crime scene.<words>103</words>
Mara pockets it, cataloging the gesture as evidence of future regret.<words>114</words>
She begins to rummage through toppled canvases, each painting a farewell letter disguised as modern art.<words>130</words>
Every brushstroke flicks another ember of memory against her skull, sparks from cases solved, partners lost, promises expired.<words>148</words>
The impact of memories, she muses, is like interest on emotional debt: compounded hourly, payable in sleeplessness.<words>165</words>
A half-damaged kaleidoscope rolls under her boot with a dying clink, its metal frame bent into a question mark.<words>184</words>
Out of habit she lifts it to her eye, letting the surviving prisms stutter shards of gallery light into fleeting images.<words>205</words>
The kaleidoscope becomes a projector of hallucinated surveillance footage: a thief in mirror-polished shoes, a velvet bag, a sudden hush.<words>225</words>
Mara rewinds the vision, noticing the thief drop the Queen of Hearts as though signing an autograph for fate.<words>244</words>
She smiles—molten sarcasm distilled into enamel—and thanks the kaleidoscope for its unsolicited rumor.<words>257</words>
But memories, even borrowed ones, are slippery accomplices, and she remains confidently unsure whether any of it was real.<words>276</words>
Still, inevitability tap-dances closer, and Mara intends to outdance it with information, not grace.<words>290</words>
She radios dispatch, her voice calm as a tossed grenade, requesting lockdown of every exit before the hush dissolves.<words>309</words>
Static answers, followed by bureaucratic yawns; apparently the apocalypse must wait for paperwork.<words>322</words>
Fine, she thinks, I'll write my own permission slip in footprints and fingerprints.<words>335</words>
Moving toward the exit corridor, she lets the kaleidoscope guide her, twisting the tube like a safe dial until the images align into arrows.<words>359</words>
Arrows lead to an air vent where glittering shoe polish smears mark a hurried climb.<words>374</words>
She swaps sarcasm for momentum, hoisting herself, joints protesting like rusted hinges at a requiem.<words>389</words>
In the duct she finds the velvet bag, empty except for the echo of disappearing art and the echo of her own future.<words>412</words>
She slips the Queen of Hearts inside, sealing memory to mystery, deciding that some inevitabilities can be tricked into new shapes.<words>433</words>
As distant sirens rouse for an encore, Detective Mara Estrada exits the vent, card in pocket, heart fractionally lighter.<words>452</words>
Tonight, at least, she has outdanced the next minute, and that is choreography enough.<words>466</words>
