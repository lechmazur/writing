I kicked open the dusty door to my sister's childhood bedroom, in the hush of a childhood bedroom left forever, a mausoleum of stuffed bears frozen mid-hug.<words>27</words>
Silence clung to the wallpaper like spider silk, uniquely static despite the howling storm outside.<words>42</words>
I had crossed deserts and grudges to reach this shriveled shrine, an irate explorer scouting an enemy that was already dead.<words>63</words>
Mother's witch's spellbook study lay behind the closet false wall, still lit by a sigil that refused to age.<words>82</words>
I entered with sardonic glee, laughing at the dust motes that fled as if they remembered her curses.<words>100</words>
On the lectern waited the dragonfly-wing pendant she always wore while scolding me for my 'perpetual expeditions into irresponsibility'.<words>119</words>
Its iridescence had dulled, but I felt its tiny engine pulse, a smug reminder that even jewelry outlived family.<words>138</words>
I came to pacify the house, to heal old wounds, yet my heartbeat hammered war drums.<words>154</words>
So I sat cross‑legged on the faded unicorn rug and tried to pacify myself with the rhythm of a heartbeat during meditation, Father’s trick for muting rage.<words>181</words>
Generational dialogues surfaced, not spoken but vibrated through the planks: Mother's incessant critique, Father's polite absences, my sister's soft surrender.<words>201</words>
Each voice scraped my skull, yet the counting of breaths filed the edges down to something almost affectionate.<words>219</words>
Sardonic glee curved into resigned amusement as I opened the spellbook to the page tagged with a burned ribbon.<words>238</words>
The ink diagram showed a childhood bedroom, this bedroom, annotated: 'For closure, reverse the room’s first lullaby'.<words>255</words>
I snorted, because the first lullaby here had been Mother's dissertation on inadequacy, sung nightly until my sister ensured silence by leaving forever.<words>278</words>
Still, the pendant heated, demanding action like an impatient monarch.<words>288</words>
I placed it on my sternum, felt wings buzz, and recited a lullaby of my own: 'I forgive your failures, so release mine'.<words>311</words>
The room inhaled; the walls exhaled; dust spiraled into constellations, then settled into a gentler arrangement of memories.<words>329</words>
Voices softened, knitting themselves into a single hum that matched my pulse, pacifying me and the ghosts in one cadence.<words>349</words>
When I opened my eyes, the pendant lay cold, the sigil dark, and the room wonderfully ordinary at last.<words>368</words>
I pocketed the inert trinket, saluted the emptiness with theatrical bravado, and strode out, an explorer no longer irate but quietly repaired.<words>390</words>
Behind me the door swung shut of its own accord, not in menace but as a courteous librarian shelving a finished chapter.<words>412</words>
