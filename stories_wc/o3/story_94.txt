After the invention of time travel, Lysandra opened her clandestine office beside the sky reflection pool.<words>16</words>
She was a femme fatale heartbreak counselor, restlessly curious about wounds ordinary therapists dared not diagnose.<words>32</words>
Clients arrived seeking solace, but left carrying signatures of her cautious impulsiveness etched beneath their ribs.<words>48</words>
Tonight, a trembling historian stepped from a humming chrono-suit, clutching dusty amber earrings like proof of sin.<words>65</words>
He claimed they once belonged to the queen he loved in an era mistakenly deleted by jealous pioneers.<words>83</words>
Now every timeline pulled him apart, the gravity of desires stretching his heart across centuries of silence.<words>100</words>
Lysandra listened, eyes reflecting cirrus spirals drifting overhead, equations whispering behind them by tracking cloud trails.<words>116</words>
That was her forbidden method: predict emotional trajectories the way meteorologists mapped storms, but with deeper thunder.<words>133</words>
She sketched vectors connecting the earrings, the queen, and the historian, then zipped the parchment inside her coat.<words>151</words>
The sound was soft, yet the historian flinched as though centuries had snapped shut around his throat.<words>168</words>
“You want release,” she murmured, “to proclaim yourself free in a cage of illusions you personally forged.”<words>185</words>
He nodded, tears orbiting his eyes like moons that knew every doomed tide.<words>198</words>
Lysandra removed one amber earring, dropped it into the pool, and ripples blossomed into mirrors of possible tomorrows.<words>216</words>
Each reflection showed the historian embracing lives where desire weighed less than memory, yet none glittered with genuine peace.<words>235</words>
“Mass cannot vanish,” she whispered, “so neither can longing; but it can be angled.”<words>249</words>
Using her stylus, she redrew his timeline as an ellipse, fastening apogee and perigee with droplets of starlight.<words>267</words>
The earrings served as foci, anchoring love to a manageable orbit that no paradox could sever.<words>283</words>
Air shimmered; decades slid into alignment like gears finally greased, and the historian straightened, suddenly lighter.<words>299</words>
Still, Lysandra felt turbulence in his smile, a residual sketch of cages she had only partially unlatched.<words>316</words>
She offered the remaining earring, warning that accepting it meant remembering her whenever gravity threatened to crush hope again.<words>335</words>
He pressed the gem against his pulse and saw, within its honeyed swirl, her silhouette walking away.<words>352</words>
Lysandra stepped to the water’s edge, studying clouds for new trajectories, restlessly curious where her own desires pointed next.<words>371</words>
Though she specialized in endings, she could never resist beginnings, so she activated her pocket chrono and vanished upstream.<words>390</words>
The pool held her reflection for a moment, then zipped shut like a sky-blue envelope guarding unsent confessions.<words>408</words>
Above, cloud trails rearranged themselves into an elegant ellipse, the universe quietly acknowledging her art and her aloneness.<words>426</words>
