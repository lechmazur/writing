Before the first lie is told, Kaleidoscope Park hums with prisms of dusk, and I, a closed‑off reaver named Quill, stand beneath a whirling ferris tower considering the taste of distant stars.<words>32</words>
Mocking affection drips from the carousel music, teasing me for craving a single stellar kiss I can never earn.<words>51</words>
Generational patterns, like chipped paint layers on the park benches, nag at my memory, each ancestor whispering that reavers devour, they never adore.<words>74</words>
I clutch a child’s drawing on crumpled paper that I looted this morning from the fairground trash, a charmingly grotesque scribble of a smiling monster eating constellations.<words>101</words>
The drawing shocks me because the monster resembles my own mirror, yet the stars in the crayon sky appear delicious, sugared, forgiving.<words>123</words>
To quiet the ancestral nagging, I beg the universe via scrawled poems in margins of the paper—jagged lines promising that a kiss can nourish better than blood.<words>150</words>
Ink bleeds over wax, and the carousel lights spin kaleidoscopic shards across my verses, as if the park itself edits my vow with luminous sarcasm.<words>175</words>
Children giggle nearby, unaware that before their mouths form any lie, their laughter is pure currency, able to purchase miracles from tired beasts like me.<words>200</words>
One small girl wanders over, her pockets rattling with glass marbles, and she demands with courtly seriousness to see the drawing I hide.<words>223</words>
Her bravery is charmingly grotesque, a tiny monarch confronting a weaponized hermit, and I laugh—mocking, affectionate, surprised it sounds almost human.<words>244</words>
I offer her the page and apologize for the ink wounds I’ve inflicted on the sky, yet she traces the monster’s teeth and says they look soft.<words>271</words>
Then she kisses the corner of the paper, anointing wax and ink alike, and tells me that stars taste like peppermint if you ask nicely.<words>296</words>
Something uncoils inside my mail‑clad chest, ancestral rust flaking away, and I realize the first lie would be to pretend I am still hungry.<words>320</words>
So, before any falsehood can hatch, I kneel, lift the girl onto my shoulder, and together we tilt back our heads toward the purple evening.<words>345</words>
The ferris tower sparks, the marbles in her pockets chime, and my old poems rise like smoke, carrying my vow into widening constellations above the park.<words>371</words>
In that mocking, affectionate illumination, I taste the stars in a single kiss—not on my lips, but in the echo of her peppermint laugh.<words>395</words>
Kaleidoscope Park records this small rebellion, engraving it among the shifting lights forever.<words>408</words>
