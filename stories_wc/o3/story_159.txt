<story>
No one remembered when the homeless philosopher-king first drifted into the sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns. <words>16</words>
He carried only a weather-beaten kaleidoscope whose fractured colors mirrored the maze's shifting walls. <words>30</words>
By night, he slept between brass shadows; by day, he lectured pigeons on sovereign ethics. <words>45</words>
The pigeons cooed approval, yet the king's real audience remained unseen scribes who transcribed every utterance during readings. <words>63</words>
Their scratchy quills guided floating lanterns overhead, spelling luminous questions he vowed to answer. <words>77</words>
He claimed his motive was to puzzle out a labyrinth once thought unsolvable, and the scribes believed him. <words>95</words>
Yet motive alone cannot open hidden corridors, so the king devised an earnestly frivolous experiment in betrayal. <words>112</words>
He would extend misleading maps to every pilgrim, testing whether deception could transform both deceiver and deceived. <words>129</words>
The transformation he sought was no mere trick but an alchemy of intent, a transformative betrayal. <words>145</words>
To circulate the maps, he traveled beyond the labyrinth's gate, gatekeepers distracted by lanterns spelling confounding riddles. <words>162</words>
He infiltrated city celebrations, slipping copies through confetti-coded proposals at random weddings. <words>174</words>
Newlyweds unfolded the parchment expecting blessings, yet found arrows pointing back toward the sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns. <words>192</words>
Curiosity conquered honeymoon plans, and crowds soon poured into the maze, each armed with contradictory directions. <words>208</words>
Passages once silent rang with laughter, argument, and the philosopher-king's impromptu lectures on the geometry of doubt. <words>225</words>
Amid the commotion, he kept turning his weather-beaten kaleidoscope, aligning fractured prisms with lantern light. <words>240</words>
Each twist reorganized colors into momentary maps, revealing doors that opened only when witnessed by the recently betrayed. <words>258</words>
Guiding a disoriented bride, he stepped through one such door and discovered a chamber lined with mirrors of sand. <words>277</words>
The mirrors refracted their reflections into countless monarchs and countless brides, all crowned yet barefoot, sovereign yet wandering. <words>295</words>
In that vision he recognized himself: a ruler defined not by possession but by perpetual homelessness. <words>311</words>
The bride gasped, realizing the labyrinth's lesson was never to escape but to extend consciousness beyond inherited vows. <words>329</words>
Outside, lanterns dipped lower, their flames flickering between statements and questions, crafting a tone of complex simplicity across the corridors. <words>349</words>
Pilgrims paused, gaining clarity exactly because their maps lied; betrayal had transformed confusion into collective authorship of the maze. <words>368</words>
The philosopher-king smiled, his experiment complete, yet the labyrinth still sprawled ahead, gleaming with unsolved promises. <words>384</words>
He lifted the kaleidoscope to the bride, gifting her sovereignty, then wandered on, lighter for having lost another throne. <words>403</words>
