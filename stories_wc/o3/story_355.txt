After the last balloon deflates in the empty hall, neon petals still drift across the psychedelic art installation like weary confetti. <words>21</words>
In that hush stands Liora, the aloof dancer whose pirouettes once lit the rave brighter than any strobe. <words>39</words>
Now she studies a cracked compass hanging from her ribboned wrist, its needle twitching as though scenting secrets spilled on the floor. <words>61</words>
She is harshly compassionate toward herself, critiquing every step yet refusing to bow to despair. <words>76</words>
Because grief must ease, she tells herself, and movement is the gentlest solvent she knows. <words>91</words>
Tonight her mission is to free unspoken truths trapped in the swirling murals before janitors bleach them away. <words>109</words>
She begins by mapping scattered dreams drawn in ultraviolet ink across the ceiling, each blob a memory guests were too frightened to voice. <words>132</words>
With pointed toes she traces an invisible chart, letting the compass guide her through constellations of abandoned laughter. <words>150</words>
Every rotation unravels a letter home that was never mailed, sentences formed from chalk dust and bass echoes. <words>168</words>
One speaks of a son dancing so his mother might imagine his heart still beating across the ocean; another admits love tasted stranger than the pills he offered. <words>196</words>
Liora pockets these spectral paragraphs, folding them into her lungs with each disciplined breath. <words>210</words>
Their weight straightens her spine and cools the burn where applause used to live. <words>224</words>
But the compass jerks south, toward a blacklit corridor painted to resemble the throat of a dragon swallowing dawn. <words>243</words>
Inside, balloons lie as crumpled moons, their latex skins exhaling the last perfume of forgotten revelry. <words>259</words>
Here the dancer confronts her own unopened letter, scrawled years ago when ambition eclipsed tenderness. <words>274</words>
She reads the plea to come home, to forgive a father who taught rhythm with slammed doors, and her knees buckle. <words>295</words>
In that collapse she finally allows mercy to pirouette through her stern critique. <words>308</words>
Tears bead then flick away in centrifugal arcs, landing on balloon shards like dew blessing wreckage. <words>324</words>
The hall seems to inhale, murals shimmering as the sentenced dreams rewrite themselves into calmer colors. <words>340</words>
Liora rises, steps lighter, knowing she has eased the haunt not by erasing memory but by letting it speak. <words>359</words>
She pins the cracked compass to the dragon wall where others can follow its shivering arrow toward confession. <words>377</words>
Then she walks out under emergency lights, composing silent choreography to deliver the collected letters home. <words>393</words>
Outside, dawn is pale, but the dancerâ€™s shadow is vivid, mapped with scattered dreams that have finally found direction. <words>412</words>
