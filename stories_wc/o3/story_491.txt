Mist clung to the greenhouse for extinct plants like memory refusing final breath.<words>13</words>
I waited there, feeling time balance on a needle, until the hush once a baby’s lullaby ends.<words>30</words>
That appointed silence announced the arrival of the serene fisher.<words>40</words>
She glided between shattered fronds of ghostly cycads, eyes calm as moonlit ponds.<words>53</words>
Despite her gentleness, everyone in the harbor town whispered myths about her impossible hunts.<words>67</words>
They said she could haul shadows out of water and sell them for dawn.<words>81</words>
I carried only my torn wristband, the last relic from nights studying the art of illusion under carnival tents.<words>100</words>
Its frayed clasp scratched my pulse, reminding me why I had come seeking her.<words>114</words>
Together we intended to find wisdom in ancient texts hidden somewhere among these resurrected ruins.<words>129</words>
Rumor promised that the words were sewn into a centuries‑old quilt draped over a cracked irrigation pipe.<words>146</words>
To unlock them, the stitches had to be unraveled exactly at this sacred minute.<words>160</words>
Logical perhaps in prophecy, the requirement felt logically absurd to anyone fond of clocks.<words>174</words>
Yet the fisher wore impossibility like another layer of skin, and I felt grudging admiration.<words>189</words>
She motioned me forward, fingers describing invisible nets across the humid amber air.<words>202</words>
Together we lifted the quilt, its fabric brittle as oak leaves pressed in forgotten bibles.<words>217</words>
I began unraveling the tight stitches, one careful tug at a time.<words>229</words>
Colored threads fluttered down like disoriented butterflies, revealing parchment panels glued to the backing.<words>243</words>
Ink shimmered, rearranging itself, practicing the art of illusion even while captive.<words>255</words>
Letters formed ripples, then sentences, until an ancient map surfaced across the textile.<words>268</words>
The map pointed not outward but inward, toward our own mingled heartbeats.<words>280</words>
I felt panic, yet the fisher simply nodded, harboring the revelation in wordless calm.<words>294</words>
She whispered that wisdom sometimes disguised itself as the listener’s breath, vanishing if pursued.<words>308</words>
Her explanation circled back to sea lore, claiming tides read minds of patient seekers.<words>322</words>
I answered by placing the torn wristband atop the map, a pledge of faith.<words>336</words>
The threads writhed, absorbing cotton and memories, until the wristband’s gap stitched shut.<words>349</words>
Suddenly the greenhouse doors swung open, admitting wind that smelled of forgotten oceans.<words>362</words>
Extinct ferns rustled as though applauding an unseen performance, and the map folded itself.<words>376</words>
Its creases aligned perfectly with the fisher’s palms, marking coordinates only she could decipher.<words>390</words>
She smiled a tide‑small smile and promised to cast nets where the mind breaks clean.<words>405</words>
My grudging admiration matured into alliance, forged not by reason but by shared wonder.<words>419</words>
When the hush lifted and distant babies cried anew, we left the greenhouse together.<words>433</words>
Outside, dawn waited like a blank page, and we held a pen of impossible water.<words>448</words>
