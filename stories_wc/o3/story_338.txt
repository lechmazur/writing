When time folded in on itself like rumpled linen, the zany artificer Orla descended into the abandoned subway labyrinth.<words>19</words>
She sought beauty in the mundane hum of forgotten rails, a quest that left her outwardly detached from people.<words>38</words>
Detachedness was armor, she insisted, not indifference.<words>45</words>
Yet stereotypes clung to her like tunnel grime, declaring that inventors should be grave, orderly, and male.<words>62</words>
Orla resolved to break them by turning decay into spectacle.<words>72</words>
She lugged a rotary phone whose cracked bakelite mouthpiece revealed a constellation of copper like dulled stars.<words>89</words>
Its incomplete call logs, etched on brittle paper disks, were her chosen medium to inform the sleeping city.<words>107</words>
Each log listed only half a number, inviting imagination to finish conversations that never began.<words>122</words>
She tucked the logs inside a cracked phone case she had scavenged from a surface thrift bin.<words>139</words>
The fracture spreading across the plastic resembled the tunnel map, a secret alignment only night-dwellers could decipher.<words>156</words>
Orla rehearsed her message while neon ghosts flickered from broken advertisement screens, casting empty abundance across wet concrete.<words>174</words>
People called the place desolate, but she heard symphonies in the drip patterns and rust harmonies.<words>190</words>
Her contraption would amplify those unnoticed melodies through the phone's bell, rewriting apathy into awe.<words>205</words>
First she wired the rotary to abandoned signal lights, borrowing electricity from looping temporal currents that flickered like tidewater.<words>224</words>
Whenever the folded instant repeated, energy surged anew, sparing her batteries she never carried.<words>238</words>
She set the phone on a cracked marble plinth beside a vending machine fossilized with candy from forgotten summers.<words>257</words>
Then she opened the case, slid a call log into the dial housing, and waited.<words>272</words>
Somewhere, time folded again, and the bell rang out half a phone number, echoing through vermillion darkness.<words>289</words>
Curiosity drew wanderers—graffiti poets, lost accountants, runaway children—who paused, listening to gaps that became possibilities.<words>304</words>
Orla informed them without speaking: beauty hides in the mundane crackle between digits, not in completed conversations.<words>321</words>
The phone case glimmered under sporadic sparks, its fracture guiding newcomers deeper, breaking every map they carried aboveground.<words>339</words>
Stereotypes eroded with each footstep, replaced by laughter at the absurdity of assigning templates to wonder.<words>355</words>
Still, Orla remained personally detached, observing reactions as if they were cogs turning inside a transparent clock.<words>372</words>
She noted which half-numbers made people smile and which moved them to tears, making mental schematics for future nights.<words>391</words>
Her heart, though barricaded, pulsed with the labyrinth, satisfied that emptiness could overflow when tuned just right.<words>408</words>
Above, the city buzzed uninformed, yet underground the stereotype of silence had been broken open like the case itself.<words>427</words>
Time folded once more, resetting footsteps, but the newfound perception lingered, indelible as copper stars on bakelite.<words>444</words>
Orla wound the dial backward, harvesting the echo, ready to begin again.<words>456</words>
