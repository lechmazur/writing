Ripley, a wide-eyed conjurer, arrived in the mysterious underwater city upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts. <words>20</words>
She carried nothing but a blacksmith's hammer with runic carvings, its head sealed in kelp to muffle even accidental echoes. <words>40</words>
Street wisdom, gathered from dockside drifters and barnacled philosophers, said voices rose fast here but debts rose faster. <words>58</words>
Ripley's plan was methodically chaotic: memorize every echoing corridor, then shatter predictions with stunts no oracle could tabulate. <words>76</words>
Yet the deepest corridor hosted a chain of algae-draped bulletin boards where the city's quarrels, trades, and prophecies hung like drying sails. <words>98</words>
To master the art of silence, she would resist the clamor by hijacking those public messages, turning the city's own whisper network against itself. <words>122</words>
Night-water glowed turquoise as she replaced loud proclamations about pearl lotteries with blank slates, each etched only with a single, quiet rune. <words>144</words>
The rune, patterned after the carvings on her hammer, meant listen, though most mistook it for absence. <words>161</words>
Fisher-kings quarreled, gamblers panicked, and rumor currents swirled, but no one could trace the thief of words whose footprints dissolved in brine. <words>183</words>
Ripley listened to the hush spread, an inhalation before thought, and felt a bittersweet reckoning settle in her chest. <words>202</words>
She knew mastery of silence was not merely absence of sound but the moment when everyone feared breaking it. <words>221</words>
Still, the city's warlords marshaled chorus-shell trumpets to flood corridors with commands, determined to drown the void she had conjured. <words>241</words>
When their brazen notes blasted, Ripley lifted the hammer and struck the marble floor once, releasing a pulse that canceled noise like collapsing surf. <words>265</words>
Runes along the haft flared, absorbing clatter into themselves the way midnight absorbs lanternlight. <words>279</words>
The warlords reeled, hearing the thunder of their own hearts louder than their armies. <words>293</words>
Ripley left them that gift of self-audible blood and walked on, erasing more bulletins, carving more invitations to listen. <words>312</words>
Soon taverns closed their shutters to hear seagrass creak, and gamblers began betting in gestures, not boasts. <words>329</words>
Even the barnacled philosophers fell silent, tasting sermons unsaid beneath their tongues like unhatched pearls. <words>344</words>
Alone beneath floating lanterns, Ripley felt the divide between her past clamor and this newborn hush narrow until it cut. <words>364</words>
Mastery, she realized, was not about wielding silence like a blade but letting it weigh so much that noise dared not budge it. <words>387</words>
With a final, gentle tap of the hammer, she silenced even her own footsteps and vanished, leaving the entire city listening for her absence. <words>411</words>
