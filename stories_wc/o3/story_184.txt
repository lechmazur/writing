Rill, the scrappy tavern‑hand, pinched the final candlewick and declared his shift officially exiled.<words>14</words>
He clutched a pouch containing his broken collection of seashells, prizes no patron ever tipped.<words>29</words>
Their jagged beauty kept whispering that drink‑soaked floors were never meant to be his shore.<words>44</words>
Yet such whispers felt like inescapable callings dressed in ale foam and mop water.<words>58</words>
Because Rill was predictably unpredictable, he trusted them the same way gamblers trust loaded dice.<words>73</words>
So, at closing, he slipped beyond the tavern door as the moon yawned open.<words>87</words>
Outside waited the university's forsaken vacuum chamber garden, eerily lit by lamps that hummed like fanfare.<words>103</words>
Engineers had once grown roses there to practice farming on airless asteroids, but funding evaporated faster than water.<words>121</words>
Now dust‑slick planters formed a maze, perfect for someone wishing to randomize destiny without witnesses.<words>136</words>
Rill scattered his broken seashells between the planters, arranging spirals that only half remembered the sea.<words>152</words>
Then he glanced at the center, where a dried‑up riverbed of nutrient gel cracked like parchment.<words>168</words>
Fossilized footprints of interns, professors, and one errant raccoon still marched across the hardened channel.<words>183</words>
Legend said the prints aligned with star maps, but nobody bothered to verify after the budget cuts.<words>200</words>
Rill kneeled, heart rattling like dice again, and poured the seashell shards into every ancient heel.<words>216</words>
Each footprint became a glittering wound bandaged by memory of tides.<words>227</words>
While the sands of time flow backward, announce where I belong, he whispered with flippant solemnity.<words>243</words>
The garden's vacuum pumps sighed, reversing direction as if obeying some petty stage cue.<words>257</words>
Dust rose, petals unfurled from fossils, and a soft roar filled the airless chamber paradoxically.<words>272</words>
Rill watched the dust swirl into hourglasses that emptied upward, clocking the backward flow he had invoked.<words>289</words>
Within each upward torrent shimmered vistas—coral skyscrapers, electric whales, taverns orbiting suns—realms only imagination previously skimmed.<words>305</words>
He felt poured through those windows, stretched like saltwater taffy across distances no map permitted.<words>320</words>
The inescapable callings grew louder, no longer whispers but orchestral queries demanding he choose a story to inhabit.<words>338</words>
Predictably unpredictable, he shrugged, flipped a seashell shard like a coin, and let randomness crown his fate.<words>355</words>
It landed in the raccoon's print, the smallest track, humble yet pointing toward a barely visible doorway.<words>372</words>
That doorway shimmered, labeled simply Randomize, as though the universe itself were offering a mischievous button.<words>388</words>
Rill laughed, pocketed the remaining shards, and stepped through, prepared to catapult imagination beyond known realms.<words>404</words>
Behind him the vacuum chamber garden sealed, the hourglasses reoriented, and time resumed its usual forward sulk.<words>421</words>
Only a single seashell sliver remained on the tavern counter, echoing waves where none had ever broken.<words>438</words>
