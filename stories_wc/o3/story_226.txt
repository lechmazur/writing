Dust sighed through the resonance testing facility, carrying a hush where past meets prophecy.<words>14</words>
In that wavering silence lingered Harlan Grieves, the gloomy orchardist turned illicit acoustician.<words>27</words>
His calloused fingers cradled a genuinely artificial luthier's hammer, polished to impossible, craftsman's pride.<words>41</words>
He had stolen it via black-market transactions from a museum that mislabeled sound as mere noise.<words>57</words>
Now he pursued a rarer contraband: to collect lost lullabies thought extinct since the Orchard Wars.<words>73</words>
Some said those melodies could calm orchards into bearing fruit even under starless drought.<words>87</words>
Harlan needed them to atone for groves he once let wither in bitterness.<words>100</words>
On a steel workbench waited the sun-bleached desert skull, its cavities threaded with copper strings.<words>115</words>
Smugglers swore the skull had contained the final breath of a sand-singer queen.<words>128</words>
If struck correctly, that captive exhalation would reveal lullabies etched within resonant bone.<words>141</words>
Harlan adjusted sensors, each calibrated to record whispers softer than regret.<words>152</words>
But the facility's ancient speakers demanded blood frequencies before they yielded archives.<words>164</words>
So he sliced his thumb and let droplets drum the skull's brow like rain overdue.<words>179</words>
A low chord rippled outward, haggard awe filling the chamber as rusted panels vibrated alive.<words>194</words>
Within the swell he heard orchards he had buried, branches crying for cradle songs.<words>208</words>
He pressed the hammer to the skull, tapping rhythms patterned on forgotten pruning cycles.<words>222</words>
Lullabies unfurled like silver leaves, each phrase containing seeds of forgiveness.<words>233</words>
Yet with every note, the sensors leaked data onto pirate channels monitoring the test.<words>247</words>
He realized the black-market that had supplied his tools now sought to harvest his harvest.<words>262</words>
If they contained the lullabies, they would auction solace to whichever tyrant bid highest.<words>276</words>
Harlan rerouted output through analog coils, erasing digital traces with each pulse of earnest sorrow.<words>291</words>
The facility lights flickered, past meeting prophecy in a surge of peach-blossom scent.<words>304</words>
From that fragrance rose apparitions of children he never fathered, singing the melodies louder.<words>318</words>
Their chorus struck his chest with craftsman's pride, reminding him creation surpasses possession.<words>331</words>
He smashed the hammer onto the skull, shattering bone into shimmering dust that swallowed sound.<words>346</words>
Silence closed like orchard loam after harvest, containing every liberated lullaby within itself.<words>359</words>
Outside, smugglers heard nothing and mistook the hush for failure, abandoning their interception rigs.<words>373</words>
Inside, Harlan breathed the quiet until it tasted of ripe pears never grown.<words>386</words>
He bottled that breath in amber vials, labeling each with a single orchard's name.<words>400</words>
These vials, not for sale, he hid among rootstock where only new saplings would listen.<words>415</words>
When the next prophecy dawned, those trees would hum the lullabies back into living soil.<words>430</words>
