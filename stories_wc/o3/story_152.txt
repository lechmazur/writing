A ragged circus cart drifted through the yawning void, its wheels scratching sparks against unseen cobblestones.<words>16</words>
Inside, Peregrin the frenzied juggler kept nine knives, seven oranges, and one crumpled love letter whirling about his wrists.<words>35</words>
He had promised to retire at the final moment of an abandoned summer, yet summer refused to end.<words>53</words>
Days, seasons, and applause had collapsed together into timeless dust, leaving only muted euphoria humming through his bones.<words>71</words>
To punch a hole back into chronology, Peregrin began interpreting tea leaves he brewed from flakes of constellations.<words>89</words>
Every swirling stalk revealed cities drowned beneath oceans of ink and shelves of sunken libraries begging to be lifted.<words>108</words>
That vision became his new motive: to salvage those libraries before memory itself cracked.<words>122</words>
Yet the tea also warned that knowledge, like knives, must sometimes be isolated or it cuts the hand that cups it.<words>143</words>
So Peregrin plotted a peculiarly functional scheme, juggling ideas as deftly as steel.<words>156</words>
He would build cultural bridges from floating planks of forgotten dialects, spanning the gulfs between drowned archives.<words>173</words>
Every plank required a fragment of story extracted from the tea’s whispered foam.<words>186</words>
When enough fragments balanced in his mind, the cart’s roof unfolded into a lattice of luminous sentences.<words>203</words>
The knives, oranges, and letter threaded that lattice, spinning faster until they formed a gate of trembling color.<words>221</words>
Peregrin kissed the crumpled love letter, remembering the librarian who had once passed it across a flooded aisle.<words>239</words>
Her ink had begged him to keep juggling, to keep bridges aloft, because she could not swim forever.<words>257</words>
The memory widened the gate, and the yawning void inhaled.<words>267</words>
Peregrin stepped through and found himself beneath black water lit by phosphorescent index cards.<words>281</words>
Shelves rose like coral reefs, volumes swollen but intact, waiting for rescue.<words>293</words>
He began juggling bubble globes of displaced air, slotting them under each shelf so books could breathe.<words>310</words>
With every successful lift, a muted cheer echoed across the abyss, and euphoria smoldered like low dawn.<words>327</words>
But hidden currents tugged at the cultural bridges he had left behind, threatening to snap their grammar.<words>344</words>
To steady them, he isolated one orange, peeled it in midwater, and read the spiral rind like fresh tea leaves.<words>364</words>
The omen instructed him to sacrifice the knives to the current, forging anchors from their hunger.<words>380</words>
He obeyed, and steel sank singing, tethering the bridges so stories could cross safely into tomorrow.<words>396</words>
At last, summer exhaled its last warm breath; time reassembled, and the juggler’s cart glided toward a dawning shore of rescued words.<words>418</words>
