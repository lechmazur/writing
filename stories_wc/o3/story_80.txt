I, Mara Finch, daring pathfinder of libraries and ruins alike, first heard the riddle older than time on a rain-bruised Tuesday.<words>21</words>
The librarian whispered that the answer hid where screams once looped above cotton candy shadows, an abandoned roller coaster track.<words>41</words>
Quiet mania tugged me forward, a humming thread between my ribs and the riddle’s impossible promise.<words>57</words>
Yet I remained ingeniously clueless about where to begin until I discovered a loose file of bizarre housekeeping logs from long-shuttered inns.<words>79</words>
Each entry documented missing soap, moaning floorboards, and guests claiming their memories had been pickpocketed by invisible custodians.<words>97</words>
Amid page turns, a symbol recurred—a sketch of an antique doorknob etched with a fractured spiral.<words>113</words>
The spiral’s break matched folklore about the last fragment of anything truly whole, a shard reality allegedly tries to forget.<words>133</words>
I guessed the track’s rusted loops once crowned a carnival hotel, so I packed rope, flashlight, and the logs, then bicycled toward its skeletal skyline.<words>158</words>
Fog eroded signage until letters drooled like tired bats, but the chain-link gate yawned wide, inviting me onto the splintered platform.<words>179</words>
Somewhere beneath the rails, a foyer of the vanished hotel still existed, according to a log describing ghostly towels folded with mechanical precision.<words>202</words>
I lowered myself through a maintenance hatch, heart ricocheting like a caged marble, muttering the riddle’s opening line to tame the air.<words>224</words>
Echoes answered in dusty chords, guiding me to a corridor wallpapered with ledgers listing turndown services for people who never checked in.<words>246</words>
There, screwed into a rotted door, gleamed the doorknob from the sketches, its spiral incomplete as though time had bitten a chunk away.<words>269</words>
I reached, but my ingeniously clueless nature forgot gloves, and the metal’s chill tunneled straight to memory, showing me tragedies like slides in a classroom.<words>294</words>
I saw builders erode the earth to sink pillars, heard children cheering, witnessed the hotel catch fire when a comet ash landed in its furnace.<words>319</words>
As smoke swallowed the carnival, one caretaker pocketed the last fragment of the hotel’s master key set—the very spiral piece missing from the knob.<words>343</words>
The vision crumbled, leaving only the corridor’s mildew tang and the certainty that the riddle wanted me to replace what had been stolen.<words>366</words>
I flipped through the housekeeping logs again, noticing each page’s margin contained numbers; assembling them created an address—an undertaker’s cottage beside the dried river.<words>390</words>
Tomorrow I will bike there, barter for the fragment, and return to this knob, unlocking whatever answer lies coiled inside forgotten rooms.<words>412</words>
Until then, I sit on the splintered platform, amid page turns and fog, quietly manic, yet patient as rust rewriting the night.<words>434</words>
