Brittle silence cracked in the forest as a branch broke, announcing an impossible dawn.<words>14</words>
That splintering note was the signal Lysander, a gentle conjurer, had long awaited.<words>27</words>
He whispered thanks to the shy thrushes and opened a hidden trapdoor of roots.<words>41</words>
Stairs of quartz descended into Umberforge, the underground city of the dwarves, glowing with emberlight.<words>56</words>
Joyful terror fluttered in his chest like an eager yet poisonous moth.<words>68</words>
Justice waited below, wrapped in legends and dust.<words>76</words>
Years ago, dwarven judges had shattered the sacred stained glass butterfly that governed their laws.<words>91</words>
Without its iridescent guidance their courts twisted into greed, exiling gardeners like Lysander's mother.<words>105</words>
He had returned not for revenge but to reassemble the broken wings and restore balance.<words>120</words>
Yet the fragments were hidden in vaults whose locks answered only to reversed messages.<words>134</words>
So Lysander had written affectionate letters to the mountain echoes, then read them backward.<words>148</words>
Each mirrored phrase opened stone like soap, revealing shards of cobalt, crimson, and sunlit gold.<words>163</words>
But nine shards remained, guarded by the High Smith whose smile was inscrutably obvious.<words>177</words>
Everyone saw menace in that grin, though he spoke only of harmony and profit.<words>191</words>
The conjurer approached him in the Hall of Anvils, the air ringing like bells.<words>205</words>
Lysander offered a single petal salvaged from his mother's forgotten garden as tribute.<words>218</words>
The High Smith laughed, amused that soft flowers presumed to bargain with iron.<words>231</words>
Still, he agreed to a contest of creation: metal versus magic, anvil versus petal.<words>245</words>
Joy surged with terror in Lysander, for loss meant the last shards would melt forever.<words>260</words>
They stood before the city, sparks dancing like wicked fireflies among the forges.<words>273</words>
The Smith hammered a helm that mirrored every fear a dwarf had ever hidden.<words>287</words>
Lysander bent the petal through gentle spells into a living memory of spring sunlight.<words>301</words>
Its fragrance reminded the watching crowd of open sky, something they had forgotten underground.<words>315</words>
Tears quenched furnaces; the helm cracked; the Smith yielded the nine hidden shards.<words>328</words>
Together, conjurer and miners carried all pieces of the stained glass butterfly to the forest.<words>343</words>
At the clearing where the branch had broken, Lysander began the reassembly beneath pale dawn.<words>358</words>
Reversed messages again guided him, each syllable spoken backward drawing wings toward their sockets.<words>372</words>
When the final click rang, the butterfly lifted itself, refracting sunrise into subterranean night.<words>386</words>
Colors poured down the tunnel mouths, painting soot-stained walls with orchards, rivers, and climbing roses.<words>401</words>
Justice, like daylight, became inscrutably obvious to every dwarf who stared at their own hands.<words>416</words>
Lysander asked only that they help rebuild his mother's forgotten garden on the surface.<words>430</words>
They agreed, forging trowels of silver and courage, and marching upward in singing columns.<words>444</words>
Thus began a season of joyful terror, for every seed carries the awe of possible ruin and impossible bloom.<words>463</words>
Above the restored butterfly glimmered, an ever-watchful promise that justice, once broken, could be reassembled.<words>478</words>
