In the hush of the unremembered future, I found the abandoned schoolhouse crouching like a rusted jack-in-the-box. <words>17</words>
The ghost town around it rang with broken windows chiming a scale of cheerful despair. <words>32</words>
I, Kellan Reeves, lucky gambler of a hundred improbable card tables, stepped inside seeking one last wager. <words>49</words>
My motivation was simple: to defy the gravity of hopelessness that tugged every future toward collapse. <words>65</words>
On a teacher's desk lay a botanical diary, its pages pressed with petals older than memory. <words>81</words>
Ink scrawls mapped which flowers thrived where governments withered, proof that roots ignore regimes drunk on power's corruption. <words>99</words>
I felt the dare flicker, bet against corruption itself, gamble that something alive could still outbluff decay. <words>116</words>
But fortune, typically never kind to second thoughts, whispered another game from the dusty auditorium. <words>131</words>
There, a cracked bottle rested on a circle of desks, a chalk message reading, 'Spin for truth or duplicate your sins.' <words>152</words>
I laughed, because even ghosts respect house rules. <words>160</words>
I spun the green-stained glass, and it wheezed around like a tired croupier keeping awful secrets. <words>176</words>
The bottle neck pointed to a toppled portrait of the principal, eyes peeled back in painted authority. <words>193</words>
Per rules unnamed, I had to confess, so I told the empty desks how many tyrants had bankrolled my streak. <words>213</words>
I admitted I'd traded luck for loyalty, turning kingdoms into casinos one dice roll at a time. <words>230</words>
When the last word echoed out, petals fluttered from the rafters and carpeted the linoleum like silent applause. <words>248</words>
Pages of the botanical diary flipped themselves, revealing identical text replicated again and again, an infinite duplicate warning. <words>266</words>
Power, it claimed, grows rings like a tree, thickening each season until the core rots from weight alone. <words>284</words>
I realized the confession game did more than tease secrets; it tilled soil for new possibilities to sprout. <words>302</words>
If I could persuade the town's forgotten seeds to bloom, maybe they'd overturn the ledgers of all my creditors. <words>321</words>
So I gathered desks into greenhouses of shattered glass, planting every petal like a coin on roulette felt. <words>339</words>
I spun the bottle after each sowing, and through spin-the-bottle confessions unveiled another layer of complicity while the diary recorded the odds. <words>361</words>
With every revolution, laughter and despair braided until the air smelled of both champagne and chalk dust. <words>378</words>
Sprouts rose overnight, cracking tiles, lifting desks, and their leaves spelled equations predicting jackpots of breathable hope. <words>395</words>
Yet each plant bore a twin stem twisted inwards, a reminder that winnings, when unchecked, strangle the table. <words>413</words>
I vowed to bet differently, to trim corruption before it flowered, and the schoolhouse sighed as though passing the dealer button to me. <words>436</words>
Outside, dawn the color of folded casino chips rose, and I walked into it clutching the diary like a rulebook for redemption. <words>458</words>
Luck, I knew, was typically never a savior, but perhaps, after tonight, it had learned to grow roots. <words>476</words>
