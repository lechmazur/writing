<story>
I, the ambivalent prophet of Mare Serenitatis, address you from the dust‑silver corridors of our lunar mining colony.<words>18</words>
Forgive the bashful arrogance in my voice; every oracle knows humility only by tasting its opposite.<words>34</words>
I have gathered a collection of marbles, cracked like frozen tears, on the observation deck where gravity forgets itself.<words>53</words>
Each splintered sphere once belonged to children who never left Earth, and that irony keeps me happily sad.<words>71</words>
I clutch them because the Board of Chronomancers insists that prophecy be delivered through tactile souvenirs.<words>87</words>
They think nostalgia slows time, widening the gap we call between heartbeats, the only moment when futures can be edited.<words>107</words>
My mission is to scramble the cosmic scoreboard before any god tallies up the final oath humanity swore to emptiness.<words>127</words>
The miners, unaware, simply want purer helium‑3 for the reactors lighting their tin can homes.<words>142</words>
In my bunk I attempt to defragment the fractured timelines their drills awaken, aligning shards the way a surgeon resets bone.<words>163</words>
Yet fragments resist, so I search the colony's forgotten corners for a better key.<words>177</words>
Yesterday, during oxygen rotation, I found one—a dusty cardboard treasure trunked behind the hydroponic kale.<words>192</words>
Inside rested jigsaw puzzle edges, warped but shimmering, remnants of a thousand‑piece panorama of obsolete stars.<words>208</words>
Rummage sale scribbles on the lid promised enlightenment, and desperation made me believe them.<words>222</words>
I slipped the cracked marbles into the puzzle's negative space, letting glass moons nestle among cardboard constellations.<words>239</words>
With every click, the colony lights flickered as if circuits felt the adjustment of destiny.<words>254</words>
Fragments fused, timelines shuffled, and my mind bloomed with a blueprint of chaos elegant enough to fool eternity.<words>272</words>
All I needed was an audience to witness the revised scoreboard before the referees refreshed the universe.<words>289</words>
Tonight, during the scheduled blackout, I invite the miners to the crater's rim, pretending to offer a marble‑dazzle magic show.<words>309</words>
They assemble, helmet visors up, hearts hammering like pneumatic pistons.<words>319</words>
I roll the cracked spheres across the regolith, and their imperfect faces refract Earthlight into glyphs only prophets or children can read.<words>341</words>
Gasps rise, and in that shared breath—the span between heartbeats—I whisper the scrambled scores to the lunar sky.<words>359</words>
The scoreboard accepts the update with a silent aurora, cancelling every debt, promise, and prophecy except my own.<words>377</words>
I feel triumph ripple outward, but simultaneously shame tiptoes in, reminding me I may have improved nothing at all.<words>396</words>
That is the cost of being happily sad, of wearing bashful arrogance like a cracked visor that lets in just enough starlight to blind.<words>420</words>
Still, I repeat the final oath alone—'May every scoreboard be broken'—and toss the last marble into the dark, where it becomes a new, unfinished puzzle edge.<words>446</words>
