As an anchor lifts for a ship’s maiden voyage, Naram, the sentimental shepherd, feels history quiver. <words>16</words>
He stands in the courtyard of an ancient Sumerian palace, smelling salt, sheep, and prophetic dust. <words>32</words>
Naram is habitually spontaneous, so he has arrived uninvited, clutching a cracked tablet of clay. <words>47</words>
Pressed into the tablet is a set of coordinates leading to a secret meeting place promised in dreams. <words>65</words>
The shepherd believes the palace corridors will align with the numbers, like constellations brought to earth. <words>81</words>
If they do, he hopes to buy justice with something dearer than silver: his own innocence. <words>97</words>
For Naram has witnessed a magistrate drown a debtor, and the river still whispers the price of justice. <words>115</words>
That price, he fears, will soon be paid by his flock if power stays unbalanced. <words>130</words>
A guard approaches, eyes like chipped obsidian, demanding proof of purpose. <words>141</words>
Naram boasts of royal friendship he has never earned, words tumbling louder than the drums of departure. <words>158</words>
The lie, wild and bright, crashes into silence, and chaotic humility steadies his voice. <words>172</words>
He admits truth: he has only an antique hairpin, inherited from a mother who sang to sheep. <words>189</words>
The guard, curious, turns the bronze pin between fingers, revealing tiny cuneiform that matches the tablet’s marks. <words>206</words>
Respect replaces suspicion; the corridor behind him yawns open like a waiting throat. <words>219</words>
Torches sputter, and smoke paints temporary constellations above goat‑carved pillars. <words>229</words>
Following the shifting stars of soot, Naram deciphers hallways until they mirror the coordinates exactly. <words>244</words>
He enters a chamber where aged scribes weigh complaints on scales made of lapis and bone. <words>260</words>
Here, justice is not blind; it charges interest. <words>268</words>
One scribe requests a gift before hearing any grievance, citing drought, war, and bureaucratic hunger. <words>283</words>
Naram offers the antique hairpin, yet insists it be recorded as collateral, not tribute. <words>297</words>
The scribes laugh at such daring, but their mirth sours when the pin’s cuneiform spells their own names. <words>315</words>
Realizing someone higher has anticipated extortion, they declare an emergency tribunal. <words>326</words>
Witnesses are summoned, including the shepherd, the guard, and the river’s ferryman who saw the debtor drown. <words>343</words>
Testimony swirls like stormwater, accusations colliding, truths bobbing, until the magistrate himself is dragged inside. <words>358</words>
Facing the very hairpin he once gifted a lover, the magistrate confesses with trembling pride and bitter tears. <words>376</words>
Judgment falls: restitution to every debtor’s family, and exile by sea on the same maiden voyage. <words>392</words>
As the anchor lifts again, Naram watches the ship claim its corrupt passenger, paying chaos forward. <words>408</words>
He feels no triumph, only the rough blessing of upheaval, and he thanks chaos as his stern teacher. <words>426</words>
The palace recedes, murmuring under torchlight, while sheep bells in the distance remind him of gentler debts. <words>443</words>
Carrying nothing but humility and empty hands, the sentimental shepherd disappears into dawn, already plotting another spontaneous pilgrimage. <words>461</words>
