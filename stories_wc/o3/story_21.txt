The drum circles throbbed outside the forgotten city hall, yet Varo Belen kept his voice at an abrasive calm.<words>19</words>
He was a measured diplomat drafted by rival clans to arbitrate blood feuds now spiraling into expensive, gene‑coded warfare.<words>38</words>
Varo's secret motive, however, was to decode genetic patterns hidden in the combatants' heirlooms before vengeance erased them forever.<words>57</words>
The council chamber smelled of dust drifting through the faint scent of must in a shuttered children’s theater repurposed as archives.<words>78</words>
That drifting odor was Varo's chosen method, a mnemonic key guiding him through memories like a chemist through flasks.<words>97</words>
Each clan leader presented tribute, but Varo's fingers lingered longest on a fox tail tassel taken from a flamboyant bandit.<words>117</words>
Its hairs felt organically synthetic, grown in nutrient vats then sewn to genuine hide to create an almost‑real trophy.<words>136</words>
The bandit had mocked both clans with a jest, waving the tassel during raids like a laughing banner against ancestral law.<words>157</words>
Now the relic lay between rivals, its silence demanding payment for the delirious laughter it once broadcast across canyons.<words>176</words>
Varo announced a pause in negotiations, citing neutrality, and carried the tassel into a side office clogged with obsolete ledgers.<words>196</words>
There he brushed the fur under a spectral scanner while the drum circles outside crescendoed, as though time itself drummed verdicts.<words>217</words>
Patterns emerged: mitochondrial codes from both clans braided with foreign sequences that spelled the bandit's real joke—he was their shared progenitor.<words>238</words>
Every murder committed in pursuit of him had been fratricide at cellular scale, an invoice of blood for ignorance.<words>257</words>
Varo weighed the price of revenge against the cost of revelation, feeling both balances scratch his conscience like twin daggers.<words>277</words>
If he exposed the data, the clans could never again hunt enemies without tasting their own marrow in the dust.<words>297</words>
If he concealed it, generations would keep paying interest on a debt to a dead prankster who once loved spectacle.<words>317</words>
The diplomat stepped back into the echoing hall, abrasive calm masking the tremor shivering beneath his robes of office.<words>336</words>
He returned the tassel to the long table and declared, with measured cadence, that vengeance had already been satisfied by revelation.<words>357</words>
As proof, he activated a holovid of overlapping genomes, their kaleidoscopic loops pulsing in rhythm with the distant drums.<words>376</words>
Some elders hissed, some wept, yet none could deny the tassel shimmered like a mirror, reflecting parents within enemies.<words>395</words>
Outside, the drum circles softened, and Varo finally allowed himself a single jestless breath, knowing peace was only postponement—still worth choosing.<words>416</words>
