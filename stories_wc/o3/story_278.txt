The midday sun drooped through the ragged skylights cut into the impact crater research base roof. <words>30</words>
Car washing had become his daily penance, a ritual disguise for darker, preciselier sculpted plans. <words>45</words>
He was a brooding sculptor forced to buff vehicles instead of marble, and resentment hardened. <words>60</words>
The station commander called it rehabilitation after the rebellion on Luna, but Caspian felt chained. <words>75</words>
Today, suds slid like lace around the vintage reading glasses he kept hanging from his collar. <words>91</words>
The lenses once belonged to his mentor, the only man who saw sculpture hidden in meteor shards. <words>108</words>
With every swipe of sponge, Caspian mapped invisible curves he longed to carve into freedom. <words>123</words>
Yet escape required webs of intrigue delicate as filigree, woven beneath ever‑watchful security drones. <words>137</words>
Caspian’s accomplice, Dr. Sura Tal, approached under pretense of inspecting soap viscosity. <words>149</words>
Her voice was theoretically spontaneous, always airy enough to dodge eavesdropping algorithms. <words>161</words>
“Your suds scatter curiously,” she murmured, tracing patterns that formed crude star charts on the hood. <words>177</words>
Caspian recognized the coordinates of an abandoned supply tunnel etched in bubble streaks. <words>190</words>
Tonight, dust would dance in a sunbeam thrown by the base’s western prism, their chosen signal. <words>206</words>
When that shimmered, he must disappear before lockup. <words>214</words>
The plan sounded poetic, yet the tenderness between conspirators remained murky, almost silted with caution. <words>229</words>

Night crawled across the crater wall, and talcum stars dusted the rent in the dome. <words>258</words>
Caspian polished the last wheel until it mirrored his hollow eyes, then pocketed the glasses. <words>273</words>
A gold shaft pierced the workshop, catching motes that spiraled like minuscule ballroom dancers. <words>287</words>
Dust performed the rehearsed ballet, and every worker’s shadow stretched toward break rooms except his. <words>302</words>
Slipping into the prism’s glow, Caspian let the dance of dust envelop his outline. <words>316</words>
To cameras, he blurred, flickered, then vanished like a smudge wiped from the sunbeam. <words>330</words>
Sura guided him through the supply tunnel where forgotten drill bits glittered like calcified constellations. <words>345</words>
Far above, alarms barked, but air vents carried only metallic echoes of their own confusion. <words>360</words>
Caspian’s pulse thudded against the fragile eyewear in his pocket, reminding him of another oath. <words>375</words>
He had promised his mentor to sculpt a statue embodying emancipation where any prisoner could touch hope. <words>392</words>
The abandoned tunnel widened into a cavern carved by ancient impact, its walls ripe for new art. <words>409</words>
Caspian unfolded a chisel fashioned from windshield shards, feeling the murk inside him thin to tenderness. <words>425</words>
Every blow he would strike promised to fracture servitude and refract it into luminous freedom. <words>440</words>
