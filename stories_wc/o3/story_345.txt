Through the hush of fate unraveling, Father Ambrose, a lapsed priest whose faith had frayed like old cassock threads, surveyed the orchard of giant beanstalks rising into ash‑gray skies.<words>29</words>
A dull radiance seeped from the stalks’ pores, neither daylight nor moonshine, tinting his skin the stale gold of coins forgotten behind altar candles.<words>53</words>
In his pocket jangled an abacus with missing beads, relic of confessional tallies he once kept, now a riddle of absences and unspoken debts.<words>77</words>
He was unapologetically confused, yet he accepted confusion as humble footing rather than shackle, for complacency, he had learned, charged interest in regret.<words>100</words>
The orchard formed a living labyrinth, rows knotting into spirals, and somewhere at its cloudy crown, legends swore, waited a gate that mocked destiny’s blueprint.<words>125</words>
Ambrose began to jog, breath misting, heart knocking like censers against stone, propelled not by certainty but by the wish to step beyond fate's design.<words>150</words>
He chose his path by following snow patterns that clung to leaves in cryptic swirls, reading them as scripture left by a colder, wiser evangelist.<words>175</words>
One fork glittered with unbroken snow, silent as polished marble, while another bore footprints that stopped abruptly, as if the walker had been erased mid‑breath.<words>200</words>
Remembering the price of complacency, Ambrose avoided the tempting certainty of the prints and veered into the pristine corridor, feeling the abacus knock like loose teeth.<words>226</words>
Beads slid, gaps clicking, tallying not sins but decisions, and the missing beads counted choices never attempted, each hollow space a sermon carved by silence.<words>251</words>
He passed beanstalks braided with frozen blossoms that chimed when the wind exhaled, and the dull radiance grew denser, thick enough to taste like tarnished honey.<words>277</words>
Soon the snow patterns twisted into the shape of an open eye, and behind its pupil lay a clearing encircled by stalks bent into arching ribs.<words>303</words>
In the center stood a mirror made of still air; step through, legends warned, and the labyrinth would collapse, freeing you or scattering you among possibilities.<words>329</words>
Ambrose's lungs burned, but he lifted the imperfect abacus, noting one row where a bead should be, and realized that emptiness awaited the next courage spent.<words>355</words>
Unapologetically confused yet resolute, he whispered a prayer without name, jogged forward, and when his foot shattered the mirror, the dull radiance flared into living thunder.<words>381</words>
The beanstalks around him folded like green origami, eyes of snow closed, and the abacus shook, a missing bead rolling into place as if payment had cleared.<words>408</words>
In the sudden void, Ambrose sensed no choir, no judgment, only an open road where footprints formed with each step he chose, unchained from patterns yet responsible for drawing them.<words>438</words>
Complacency had demanded its toll long ago, but accepting confusion as catalyst had bought him passage, and he walked on, bead and sky clicking a new arithmetic of self‑forged destiny.<words>468</words>
