Gritted moons of broken steel hung above the quantum beach, corroded rapture staining the tide. <words>15</words>
At the hush just before a condemned building was demolished inland, Eryx listened to the silence hiss. <words>32</words>
He was a solitary summoner who conjured possibilities rather than spirits. <words>43</words>
Tonight he intended to outshine his own reflection, the only rival he trusted. <words>56</words>
Wind prowled through scaffolds like a hungry cat, and he let his mind prowl with it. <words>72</words>
Years ago, his family celebrated Equinox by smashing clocks exactly at dawn, declaring linear time a rumor. <words>89</words>
That unique way the family celebrates the holiday had imprinted rebellion deep inside his marrow. <words>104</words>
Now he would honor the tradition by shattering the concept of place instead of hours. <words>119</words>
Between briny particles, the quantum beach offered coordinates that wriggled like fish when observed. <words>133</words>
Eryx unfolded a map drawn on a leaf, its veins marking uncertain continents. <words>146</words>
The artifact felt oddly authentic, as though the tree had penned autobiography in chlorophyll. <words>160</words>
He pressed it to the sand, whispering the fractal syllables that coaxed space to rearrange. <words>175</words>
The spark of invention crackled, not from metal, but from possibility itself, briefly illuminating rusted dunes. <words>191</words>
Phosphorescent grids blossomed, mapping realities where the condemned building already lay in forgotten ruins. <words>205</words>
In each reality, his reflection glimmered on shattered windows, always a fraction brighter than him. <words>220</words>
To eclipse that taunting sheen, he needed one final vector, hidden where water met warning tape. <words>236</words>
He stepped into surf that frothed with overlapping timelines, every wave a different version of tomorrow. <words>252</words>
The leaf-map absorbed salt and began to hum, edges curling into a MÃ¶bius horizon. <words>266</words>
Eryx climbed the loop, feeling gravity negotiate, sand grains reversing like rewound bullets. <words>279</words>
Above him, demolition charges ticked inside the black silhouette of the building, but time misfired. <words>294</words>
Every tick echoed backwards, giving him minutes snatched from an already crumbled future. <words>307</words>
He recited the final rune, a syllable his ancestors saved for resetting dawn. <words>320</words>
Light roared out, neither gentle nor cruel, bathing mirrors along the shore in unownable glare. <words>335</words>
When the surge receded, every reflection showed empty sand, his image erased, challenge defeated. <words>349</words>
Eryx blinked, unsure whether victory or extinction rippled through his pulse. <words>360</words>
The building finally detonated, bricks ascending like fireworks before dissolving into doves of red dust. <words>375</words>
Some doves perched on his shoulders, cooing with oddly authentic comfort amid the rubble-scented wind. <words>390</words>
He realized the universe had given him applause, not answer, and perhaps that was brighter. <words>405</words>
Slowly, he folded the leaf back into his coat, sparks guttering like satisfied stars. <words>419</words>
Then he prowled down the shining beach, alone again, but larger than his shadow. <words>433</words>
