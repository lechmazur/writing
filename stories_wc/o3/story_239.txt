The tree ring reading room smelled of cedar and withheld secrets when the lights died without warning. <words>17</words>
Night swallowed the scholarly diagrams, and a chorus of surprised scholars drifted outside, driven by the campus-wide blackout. <words>35</words>
Amid them, I, Vero the formally imperfect yet frenetic illusionist, clutched a battered metal lunchbox like contraband. <words>52</words>
Its dented walls held my newest experiment in radiant shifts, a light that could bend histories. <words>68</words>
The outage was luck, or maybe a warning whispered through rings of oak older than language. <words>84</words>
I slipped back inside while others searched the sky, my pulse beating like cards shuffled by thunder. <words>101</words>
Flashlight beams jittered across corridors, but none followed me into the archive basement where nocturnal quiet reigned. <words>118</words>
I unlocked the reading room with a skeleton key stolen from a custodian who loved riddles. <words>134</words>
Moonlight poured across concentric slices of sequoia mounted like planetary maps on mahogany walls. <words>148</words>
Each ring glimmered, seeming to murmur dates I had never lived yet somehow remembered. <words>162</words>
I set the lunchbox at the stump-shaped lectern and released its latch; a zephyr of luminescence spiraled upward. <words>180</words>
Color split like prisms quarrelling, then settled into a hovering doorway traced by overlapping decades. <words>195</words>
Radiant shifts, as theorized, stitch present volatility onto ancient echoes, letting stories walk across time. <words>210</words>
Yet every portal demands a storyteller willing to thread the labyrinth with their own story, or collapse ensues. <words>228</words>
I whispered defiant vows, promising to taint no memory, though secrecy already stained my intent. <words>243</words>
Stepping through, I found myself inside the same room, candlelit, populated by ring-counters wearing bark-fiber robes. <words>259</words>
They saw the breach in their chronology and assumed I was an omen disguised as man. <words>275</words>
Their leader, a stooped woman named Laurel, touched my sleeve and asked which season had birthed me. <words>292</words>
I answered honestly: the monsoon that never arrived, and my truth unsettled her enough to listen. <words>308</words>
Together we examined rings still growing on a sapling standing where the lectern should have been. <words>324</words>
Inside those tender circles glowed silhouettes of neighborhoods blacked out in my hour, urging collaboration across eras. <words>341</words>
Laurel offered her own battered lunchbox, wooden and inked with glyphs, proposing an exchange of containers and purposes. <words>359</words>
In secretive defiance of chronology, we switched boxes, pledging to return them only after our worlds healed. <words>376</words>
The moment metal touched Laurel's hands, luminous bark spread along the walls, and present-day alarms wailed beyond the portal. <words>395</words>
I fled back through the doorway, carrying her wooden box, as emergency sirens guided evacuees into the starlight. <words>413</words>
On the lawn, neighbors clustered, sharing candles, stories, and hope galvanized by the outage they thought accidental. <words>430</words>
I kept silent, feeling wind from both centuries tug at my coat like a warning and an invitation. <words>448</words>
Within the wooden lunchbox pulsed unfinished rings, urging me to guide these people toward the labyrinth awaiting dawn. <words>466</words>
The power would soon return, but my story had already threaded itself through time, and I intended to follow. <words>485</words>
