The drum solos rattled the fogged glass of the city’s abandoned conservatory. <words>12</words>
Inside, a docile bruiser named Huxley waited at the iron door, disturbingly calm. <words>25</words>
He listened to percussion echoes like distant heartbeats marking the tempo of courage. <words>38</words>
A crumpled backpack hung from his enormous shoulder, bumping a cracked lantern. <words>50</words>
Its glow revealed row upon row of glass corridors filled with carnivorous blossoms. <words>63</words>
Huxley’s mission was to mold a myth from the mud of reality. <words>75</words>
Stories said a conductor’s baton hidden here could raise the dead mid-crescendo. <words>87</words>
With it, legends promised, any silence could be bullied back into song. <words>99</words>
Yet legends spoke in languages Huxley barely understood, each dialect a slippery vine. <words>112</words>
Language barriers had haunted him since childhood, when fists substituted for grammar. <words>124</words>
Now, older, he practiced brash tenderness, letting words flower even in bruised throats. <words>137</words>
He removed warped floorboards in the tropical humidity and found a shredded treasure map. <words>151</words>
By piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards, he’d plotted tonight’s path. <words>165</words>
The taped parchment resembled a skein of veins feeding a monstrous heart. <words>177</words>
Every intersection promised either salvation or swallowing. <words>184</words>
He inhaled, then twisted the lantern knob, dimming it to minimal glow. <words>196</words>
That twist felt like tuning a drumskin before the downbeat of fate. <words>208</words>
Drums outside thundered again, masking the creak as he entered the labyrinth. <words>220</words>
Vines brushed his arms like wet tongues seeking salt. <words>229</words>
He murmured apologies in five imperfect languages, hoping hunger respected politeness. <words>240</words>
A bell-shaped chrysanthemum snapped at the air, missing his ear by centimeters. <words>252</words>
Huxley offered it the map’s blank corner; paper teeth savaged parchment instead of flesh. <words>266</words>
The distraction let him slip through an arched greenhouse door marked with faded clefs. <words>280</words>
Inside the chamber, a marble podium rose like an island above thorny leaves. <words>293</words>
Atop it lay the conductor’s baton, black wood veined with silver runes. <words>305</words>
The air smelled of ozone and old sheet music turned compost. <words>316</words>
He approached, every bootstep synced to the offbeat toms outside. <words>326</words>
A massive flytrap lunged, closing on his torso like a green iron maiden. <words>339</words>
The docile bruiser did not punch; instead he hugged the plant softly. <words>351</words>
His brash tenderness baffled the predator, petals shivering in confused lullaby. <words>362</words>
Slowly it reopened, releasing him to the podium like an apologetic usher. <words>374</words>
Huxley grasped the baton, and the drums outside immediately fell into disciplined silence. <words>387</words>
Green shadows gathered as if listening for their new maestro’s downbeat. <words>398</words>
He raised the baton, disturbingly calm, yet heart hammering paradiddles. <words>408</words>
In fractured Latin, he commanded, and roots writhed, spelling answers across the floor. <words>421</words>
The greenhouse replied in rhythm, a resurrected choir no language barrier could muzzle. <words>434</words>
Myth and mud twined like vines around him, twisting silence into immortal song. <words>447</words>
Outside, the city drums restarted, this time following his secret greenhouse tempo. <words>459</words>
