<story>
The forthright peddler docked his creaking skiff against the silence of Warden Station's abandoned medical bay.<words>16</words>
Dusty drips still hanging from saline lines greeted him like frozen applause, a fitting reception for someone who felt joyful loneliness more keenly than heat.<words>41</words>
He carried, as always, a dried flower bouquet wrapped in cracked foil, its brittle petals whispering of overlooked summers.<words>60</words>
Each bloom marked a pledge he owed to the dead villages behind him, and tonight he intended to start redemption's path.<words>81</words>
The oath had been sealed in blood when pirates forced his trembling hand to sign their manifest, branding him accomplice.<words>101</words>
Now, meekly assertive, he would divide allegiance from guilt, truth from tale, by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns still cached in the station's infirmary databanks.<words>126</words>
The columns, beamed daily across the spiral arms, catalogued who paid whom, which hull bore contraband, and where the pirates hid their surgeons.<words>149</words>
Somewhere in that venomous chatter he hoped to find proof that his signature had been forged, a loophole to snap the crimson contract.<words>172</words>
While the universe hums its secret song beyond the hull, the peddler began scrolling archaic screens, the bouquet perched nearby like a paper haiku.<words>196</words>
Line after line of scandal flickered: celebrity admirals, smuggled moons, bribes coded in lullabies.<words>210</words>
He cross-referenced birth dates, shipping manifests, and surgical logs until rumor surrendered a name--Dr. Virran Slate, the butcher who had guided the pirates' blades.<words>234</words>
A forgotten sub-note claimed Slate now hid in cryostasis within this very bay, abandoned when the authorities evacuated.<words>252</words>
The peddler's pulse quickened not with vengeance but with opportunity, for if Slate admitted the forgery, the oath would unravel like old gauze.<words>275</words>
He pried open a stasis coffin, sighing when rusted servos protested, then placed the dried flowers upon its lid as parley's flag.<words>297</words>
Slate thawed slowly, eyelids fluttering to the neon ghost-light, confused yet aware of the bouquet's fragranceless accusation.<words>314</words>
The peddler spoke with forthright calm, his voice a gentle comet, offering release not revenge.<words>329</words>
Confession for freedom, he proposed, and promised to ferry Slate to authorities where mercy might grow between bureaucratic cracks.<words>348</words>
Trembling, the surgeon agreed, admitting the pirates had forced his hand as well, forging every crewman's mark to divide blame among the innocent.<words>371</words>
Recorder active, the peddler captured the confession, feeling the blood-inked cords around his soul begin to loosen.<words>388</words>
Joy welled up, a solitary star inside him, bright yet distant, for redemption's path was walked alone however many witnesses it required.<words>410</words>
He sealed the coffin for safe transport, reclaimed the colorless bouquet, and listened to the universe hum its secret song through the cracked bulkheads.<words>434</words>
In that humming he heard forgiveness approaching, soft as dust, sprawling as space, and he smiled into the joyful loneliness that had carried him this far.<words>460</words>
