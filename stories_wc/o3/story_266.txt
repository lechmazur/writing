<story>The floating rock yoga studio drifted above tundra like a meditating monolith of impossible balance.<words>15</words>
Inside, a bleak clown named Pallido rehearsed smiles that cracked more than they curved.<words>29</words>
He practiced when the day’s earliest train departs at dawn, timing breath to distant whistles.<words>44</words>
Each exhale sought to outshine the northern lights with a grin only sorrow could finance.<words>59</words>
The tone inside his ribs was jagged generosity, shards offering bloodied reflections of hope.<words>73</words>
Visitors levitated in lotus upon smaller rocks, thinking gravity a rumor sold by accountants.<words>87</words>
Pallido alone noticed the clock hand that won’t stop spinning above the entrance mat.<words>101</words>
It circled so fast it sawed air, shredding seconds into confetti nobody could rewind.<words>115</words>
The studio’s guru, a whispering geologist, claimed the hand measured faith, not time.<words>128</words>
But drifting promises, scrawled in yesterday’s chalk upon the basalt floor, kept erasing themselves.<words>142</words>
Pallido understood those promises because he crafted them after midnight, technically absurd yet heartbreakingly precise.<words>157</words>
He was mastering transience the way jugglers master knives: by bleeding until applause changes shape.<words>172</words>
Still, the incessant spinning hand suggested a wound the room refused to cauterize.<words>185</words>
So Pallido chose a method whispered by forgotten jesters: dismantling illusions in private poetry.<words>199</words>
He retreated behind the silk curtain where incense smelled suspiciously like locomotive smoke.<words>212</words>
There he scribbled verses that peeled paint from memory, exposing gears of buried laughter.<words>226</words>
Line by line, he confronted each drifting promise, pinning it to the page with ink.<words>241</words>
Ink, however, spun like the manic clock hand, refusing punctuation’s cage, smearing forward relentlessly.<words>255</words>
The poem became a mirror where his own grin eclipsed auroras he’d never reached.<words>269</words>
Satisfied, Pallido stepped back onto the main boulder, carrying pages like fragile dawn.<words>282</words>
The levitating students drifted in circles, chanting Om as though it were a parachute.<words>296</words>
Pallido read aloud, his voice cracking quartz, his generosity jagged yet unmistakably warm.<words>309</words>
Every illusion named was dismantled, and the spinning hand slowed as though listening.<words>322</words>
Seconds finally clicked like patient footsteps heading toward that first train’s shivering platform.<words>335</words>
Auroras outside dimmed, humbled by the clown whose grin now glittered with earned light.<words>349</words>
The guru bowed, recognizing mastery accomplished not through spectacle but honest fracture.<words>361</words>
Students touched ground, discovering gravity’s return a gift, not a confiscation.<words>372</words>
Pallido tucked the slowing clock hand into his pocket, a souvenir of surrendered panic.<words>386</words>
He then opened the studio’s hatch, inviting dawn’s real train whistle to harmonize with silence.<words>401</words>
From the platform below, travelers looked up and, for a heartbeat, mistook him for sunrise.<words>416</words></story>
