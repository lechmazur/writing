The shaky mercenary stepped over fallen saints sculpted in dust, entering the collapsed cathedral turned street artist's haven like a penitent thief.<words>22</words>
Graffiti halos glimmered in torchlight, and each sprayed color rang like a mute bell during the slow fade of an echoing hour.<words>44</words>
He was here, as every rumor insisted, to barter for a palm-sized chunk of amber with a trapped spider older than the ruins.<words>67</words>
People said the fossilized arachnid whispered futures if warmed by blood, a claim relayed through improbable rumor chains that looped the continent like smoke.<words>91</words>
Yet the mercenary sought no prophecy; he hunted unknown answers that might let his shaking hands finally still.<words>109</words>
Years of jobs signed in gunpowder had left ghosts inside him, and making peace with the past became his only payable contract.<words>131</words>
To negotiate, he adopted a carefully reckless calm, smiling just enough to look unafraid while his knees quivered like tuning forks.<words>152</words>
Spray-painted cherubs guided him to the apse where a woman perched on a broken altar, soldering wires into a stained-glass drone.<words>173</words>
She claimed ownership of the amber, her voice echoing off fractured pillars as though the cathedral itself rehearsed the conversation.<words>193</words>
Payment, she said, required a memory, not money.<words>201</words>
With improbable longing, he recounted the day he spared a target because the man hummed the lullaby his mother once sang.<words>222</words>
The memory fluttered in the high ribbed vaults, and flakes of soot fell like black snow approving the confession.<words>241</words>
Satisfied, the woman produced the amber, still warm from her pocket, and demanded he finalize the trade by sealing it against his heart.<words>264</words>
He pressed the honeyed stone to his chest, and the spider within shimmered, legs twitching as if sensing newfound circulation.<words>284</words>
A hush folded over spray cans and broken organs, and for a heartbeat his tremor ceased.<words>300</words>
Inside that stillness he glimpsed the unknown he had searched for: not prophecy, but the slim possibility of forgiveness crawling out of ambered time.<words>324</words>
The spider's shadow cast enormous across the painted nave, weaving threads between bullet holes and haloed vandalism, stitching a fragile future.<words>345</words>
He exhaled the gunpowder taste lodged under his tongue and promised the woman no more contracts, only repairs.<words>363</words>
She nodded, releasing drones that carried his vow into nave shadows like votive lanterns set free.<words>379</words>
When he left, dawn had not yet arrived, but the echoing hour had finally expired, taking with it a portion of his violence.<words>402</words>
Outside, blank city walls awaited new saints in aerosol, and his once-shaky stride felt uncertainly steady.<words>418</words>
Somewhere behind him, the spider settled, entombed yet awake, a quiet compass pointing forever toward the peace he still had to earn.<words>440</words>
