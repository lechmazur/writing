The arboreal workshop hung like a curious nest suspended among giant mushrooms swelling in the damp dawn.<words>17</words>
Inside, an insomniac painter named Liora dabbed fresh pigment over a canvas still wet with restless nightmares.<words>34</words>
She had worked all night, her mind peacefully chaotic, chasing a smile she could never trust.<words>50</words>
Experience had taught her that behind the painted smiles lurked riddles sharper than broken glass.<words>65</words>
Still, the commission promised enough coin to buy new brushes and perhaps a single hour of sleep.<words>82</words>
Sleep, however, was the final obstacle she intended to outlast.<words>92</words>
To stay awake, she poured cold tea into saucers and gazed at them as though they were moonlit mirrors.<words>111</words>
She had learned long ago to divine restless colors by scrying in puddles after midnight.<words>126</words>
Tonight, the puddles revealed something stranger than pigment: a tapered wizard’s hat with a bullet hole smoking at its tip.<words>146</words>
The vision quivered like a prank wrapped in an epitaph, filling her with frolicsome regret.<words>161</words>
She chuckled, then winced, for she recognized the hat as belonging to Professor Argent, her mentor in vanished days.<words>180</words>
Argent had vanished during the hush of an empty classroom at first light, leaving only chalk dust and unfinished riddles.<words>200</words>
His disappearance was the reason Liora devoured paint instead of breakfast, chasing truth on her tongue.<words>216</words>
She believed the colors carried whispers he had hidden from mundane ears.<words>228</words>
Now, the puddle promised a reunion—if she dared follow the rippling map it offered.<words>242</words>
Gathering her portable easel, she stepped onto a bark walkway that swayed like an amused serpent.<words>258</words>
Glow spores drifted between the colossal caps, painting freckles of blue light upon her cheeks.<words>273</words>
Liora followed puddles that pooled in fungus hollows, each surface reflecting the bullet-scarred hat more vividly.<words>289</words>
At last she arrived at a clearing where the actual hat lay perched atop an overturned paint box.<words>307</words>
A single silver bullet rattled inside like a metronome counting down forgotten lessons.<words>320</words>
Beside it sat Argent, translucent as turpentine fumes, smiling the smile she had never trusted.<words>335</words>
Behind the painted smiles, he murmured, the real portrait always waits for the brave brush.<words>350</words>
Liora felt both giddy and sorrowful, the precise flavor of frolicsome regret she had mixed into her palette all night.<words>370</words>
She lifted the bullet, dipped it in vermilion, and pressed it to her canvas like a final punctuation.<words>388</words>
The ghost devoured the color, growing corporeal, while her own hands faded into glimmering outlines.<words>403</words>
Argent bowed, donning the hat, the bullet hole now sealed by fresh paint and dawn's newborn hush.<words>420</words>
Liora, half-visible, realized she had outlasted the final obstacle but at a playful, mournful cost.<words>435</words>
Between mushroom trunks, the new sun lit an empty easel, and behind its painted smiles another story waited.<words>453</words>
