In the hush of a half-lit corridor, I pressed my back against broom-scratched plaster, listening for propellers of rugs overhead. <words>20</words>
The witch's flying carpet garage lay beyond the next arch, a cavern of woven engines humming with forbidden physics. <words>39</words>
I, an outcast scholar barred from every respectable observatory, had crept here chasing a rumor more luminous than moonlight. <words>58</words>
They said a seashell with a strange symbol was kept among the spare tassels, mirroring the soul of whoever dared listen. <words>79</words>
If I could record its reflection, I would finally prove that midnight only lasts so long, that dawn is measurable. <words>99</words>
My heart thudded with frantic peace, a contradictory rhythm that steadied my shaking hands even as they sweated ink. <words>118</words>
One decisive jolt of courage sent me sprinting through the arch before I reconsidered centuries of cautions. <words>135</words>
Carpets hung like dormant dragons, their tassels twitching in scented draft, but none stirred to warn the night guard. <words>154</words>
On a workbench of ebony loom-wood, the seashell waited, ivory spirals etched with that strange symbol resembling two mirrored hearts. <words>174</words>
I lifted it, and the garage lights dimmed as though the shell inhaled current and exhaled low tide. <words>192</words>
Sound rushed into my ears: my own voice reciting thesis drafts, my childhood laughter, my future sighs not yet breathed. <words>212</words>
The shell was mirroring the soul, yes, but it mirrored forward and backward, revealing time as a reversible embroidery. <words>231</words>
I feared madness, yet the voices felt strangely trustworthy, guiding me toward an unseen window between hours. <words>248</words>
They instructed me to document every echo before it faded, so I withdrew the packet of ragged diaries from my coat. <words>269</words>
Pages were few, having been smuggled in portions via diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom downtown. <words>288</words>
Each page already carried faint salt stains, as though the sea had anticipated tonight's confession. <words>303</words>
I wrote, letting the pen move during every surge of echoed memory, transcribing melodies of dawn I had not yet survived. <words>324</words>
Soon the shell cooled, the garage lights brightened, and carpets rustled like waking starlings. <words>338</words>
Midnight was draining away, measured in regained wattage and shrinking shadows, exactly as I swore to prove. <words>355</words>
Yet footsteps thundered in the corridor, and a lantern beam slashed the arch, forcing me to choose between evidence and escape. <words>376</words>
Trust the jolt, the shell seemed to whisper, so I pocketed it and vaulted onto the nearest carpet. <words>394</words>
Fibers responded to my pulse, lifting me toward a skylight painted like night but peeling into almond dawn. <words>412</words>
As we burst free, diaries clasped to my chest, I realized I was already writing tomorrow's astronomy. <words>429</words>
Midnight only lasts so long, but its echo prints maps for anyone frantic enough to listen in peace. <words>447</words>
