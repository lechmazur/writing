Rust-scaled constellations flickered on the cracked dome as the broken planetarium, reborn as the Night Arc club, exhaled steam.<words>19</words>
Marin, a patiently impatient underwater welder turned bouncer, watched dancers orbit the shattered projector like rogue satellites.<words>36</words>
He felt them tug at his nerves, moments of unraveling stitched into the night’s bass, promising buried currents.<words>54</words>
Backstage, he kept a vintage button box salvaged from a sunken liner, each brass circle etched with impossible star maps.<words>74</words>
Touching them sparked salt-tasting arcs up his arm, reminding him why he served this strange venue—so he could wield improbable power.<words>95</words>
The owner, Velvet Cassiopeia, loved to pamper VIPs with asteroid cocktails and rumors, but tonight she offered Marin a rarer indulgence.<words>116</words>
She whispered of a crossing where two timelines should never meet, due in minutes behind the staff-only door.<words>134</words>
All she required was a guardian holding stars in his pocket.<words>145</words>
Marin agreed, curiosity ringing louder than the subwoofers.<words>153</words>
Velvet led him through hallways, guiding him via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, their silver peeling like moon skin.<words>172</words>
In passing reflections he caught flickers of himself welding deep-sea pylons that never existed, glimpses sliding across glass like fish.<words>192</words>
The door opened onto the ruined observatory floor, now the club’s silent heart, where the projector’s lens aligned with an unseen fissure.<words>214</words>
A wind smelling of brine and ozone spiraled upward, and the night seemed to pause, patiently impatient for collision.<words>233</words>
Velvet asked him to place three buttons on the cracked floor at equidistant points, just as the star maps depicted.<words>253</words>
When the third button touched stone, the mirrors in the hallway screamed light, each showing alternate yesterdays racing toward now.<words>273</words>
Marin felt threads inside him loosen, the same threads he learned to seal underwater, but here they came undone joyously.<words>293</words>
Through the fissure rose his other self, older, eyes phosphorus-green, carrying a welding torch that burned like compressed aurora.<words>312</words>
They were the timelines that must never meet, yet magnetism stronger than warnings drew them face to face.<words>330</words>
Velvet shouted for separation, but Marin only heard the ocean rushing inside his veins, calling promises of salvage and dominion.<words>350</words>
He clasped his counterpart’s gloved hand, and the three buttons erupted into miniature galaxies, sewing the two men into one impossible outline.<words>372</words>
The planetarium walls flickered, then crystallized into a living sea under starlight, while Velvet fell to her knees, awed, defeated, fulfilled.<words>393</words>
Marin felt tidal power hum behind his ribs, an inherited mystery now completely his, and he guided the newborn cosmos to dance.<words>415</words>
Outside, clubgoers watched auroras spill through skylights, unaware that a welder had mended eternity with a box of buttons and desire.<words>436</words>
And somewhere in the mirrors, the timelines rippled contentedly, pampered by paradox, wearing seams tough as welded coral.<words>454</words>
