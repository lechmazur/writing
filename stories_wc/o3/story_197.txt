Zephyra drifted on thermals to her office nestled among the crown of the yggdrasil‑like tree that speared the upper atmosphere.<words>20</words>
She was a high‑altitude con artist who sold impossible assurances to cloud‑spirits and thunderheads.<words>34</words>
Tonight, during the hush after a child’s last bedtime story, her clientele would be the dark itself.<words>51</words>
The contract demanded she compose a cosmic lullaby soothing the place where nightmares collide.<words>65</words>
Payment would be silence everlasting, a currency rarer than helium in her turbulent trade.<words>79</words>
To further this elegant heist of hush, Zephyra consulted the piece of fabric scrap fluttering from her wrist like a wounded flag.<words>101</words>
It was cut from a blanket once wrapped around the dreaming child, still warm with mundanely terrifying memories of closets ajar and toys whispering.<words>125</words>
Such ordinariness held power, because pristine chaos always begins with one crooked stitch.<words>138</words>
Her guidance system consisted of sticky notes pasted on bark, rearranged daily by mischievous squirrels serving as secretaries.<words>156</words>
Each neon square bore a scrambled lyric, and only by unscrambling a set of sticky notes rearranged daily could the lullaby reveal its true chord.<words>181</words>
Zephyra inhaled ozone, then coaxed the notes into alignment, letters sliding like glaciers across fluorescent seas.<words>197</words>
Consonants clacked, vowels rang, and the fabric scrap twitched as though remembering lullabies it never heard aloud.<words>214</words>
Suddenly the trunk hollow opened into a corridor of overlapping dreams, a junction where nightmares collide like commuters refusing eye contact.<words>235</words>
Zephyra stepped inside, her altitude con replaced by attitude calm, selling hush to horrors by humming the tentative melody.<words>254</words>
Each note unfurled threads from the scrap, weaving halls into soft constellations, and the mundanely terrifying shapes of bogeymen softened into plush silhouettes.<words>277</words>
Still, one sticky note remained blank, refusing order, demanding risk.<words>287</words>
To further her deception into art, she pressed the blank note over her heart, surrendered the last beat of grifter thrill, and sang the missing silence.<words>313</words>
The lullaby spilled outward, flowing up branches and down roots, echoing through meteor showers orbiting the treetop like lazy fireflies.<words>333</words>
Below, children shifted peacefully, unaware their safest dreams were being subcontracted by a woman who once hustled barometric readings for lunch.<words>354</words>
Above, the nightmares found no platforms to disembark upon, spiraling into a cradle of chords too gentle to hate.<words>373</words>
Pristine chaos settled like snow, delicate yet absolute, and every branch of the yggdrasil‑like tree rang with purposeful quiet.<words>392</words>
Zephyra exhaled, realizing that silence, once sold, could never be repossessed, even by the cleverest altitude grifter.<words>409</words>
She folded the fabric scrap into a paperless airplane and let it glide downward, a receipt no ledger could tally.<words>429</words>
Some night, she thought, the child would find it beneath the pillow and hear, in the weave, the moment nightmares surrendered.<words>450</words>
Until then, Zephyra climbed higher, seeking new buyers for hush, already fingering tomorrow’s scrambled notes within pockets of thinning air.<words>470</words>
