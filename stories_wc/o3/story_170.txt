After the last stone was set in the abandoned seawall, Mira inhaled saltwind like a prayer.<words>16</words>
She was the station's free-spirited herbalist, academically artistic enough to sketch algae cross-sections between tincture experiments.<words>32</words>
Yet the heart of doubt thrummed louder than the breakers against the reef she was sworn to heal.<words>50</words>
Every salvaged coral fragment reminded her of mistakes unspoken, of experiments that once bleached color from living stone.<words>68</words>
To hush the hollow echoes of shame, she opened her grandmother's vintage sewing kit each dusk beside the tanks.<words>87</words>
Threads originally meant for dresses now stitched tiny mesh cradles where new polyps could root in safety.<words>104</words>
Still, memory frayed like coral lace, and doubt kept catching on the barbed wire of her mind.<words>121</words>
Mira sought another remedy: she began to memorize the brittle, barnacled ledger of forgotten letters stored in the kit's false bottom.<words>142</words>
Ink had run into dreamy shapes, but she traced every curve, hearing voices of women who stitched futures from scraps.<words>162</words>
Their confessions bled longing, failure, and saltwater wonder, echoing her own.<words>173</words>
Through forgotten letters she learned that belonging isn't granted by flawless results, but by relentless mending of what breaks.<words>192</words>
The revelation arrived like bioluminescent bloom, soft, sudden, impossible to ignore.<words>203</words>
Next morning, under pink pre-dawn waves, she invited the skeptical engineers to witness her stitched cradles unfurl.<words>220</words>
They watched tentative coral buds sprout through mesh, petals of living limestone reaching toward filtered sun.<words>236</words>
A hush settled, not of shame but of reverent surprise, and Mira felt the breakers inside her chest calm.<words>255</words>
Still breathless with longing, she admitted the mesh might fail, the water might warm, the ledger might blur beyond reading.<words>275</words>
But she pledged to keep stitching, keep planting, keep listening, because doubt's heart could beat alongside hope, not against it.<words>295</words>
The engineers, moved, offered surplus ceramic tiles, and students volunteered to paint them with academically precise yet soulful diagrams.<words>314</words>
Mira orchestrated a mosaic reefscape, each tile a syllable in the language she had begun to memorize.<words>331</words>
When the afternoon sun struck the submerged wall of color, it shimmered like sewn silk, resurrecting the voices of the letters.<words>352</words>
Tourists aboard glass-bottom boats gasped, and their wonder carried across the lagoon, softer than gull cries, stronger than remorse.<words>371</words>
After sunset, Mira returned to the abandoned wall, pressed her ear against limestone, and heard only gentle tides, no hollow echoes.<words>392</words>
She whispered gratitude to the kit, the letters, the corals, and even to the heart of doubt that kept her hands moving.<words>414</words>
In darkness, phosphorescent larvae drifted like scattered stitches, promising that every repair, however uncertain, could fashion oceans into gowns of life.<words>435</words>
