I stood on the rim of the colossal soup bowl, tuning my lute while onion vapors swirled like timid ghosts.<words>20</words>
The giant who owned this dining room had stepped away to answer an iron doorbell that chimed louder than cathedral bells amid rush hour outside his mountain manor.<words>48</words>
I, a lingering minstrel, eyed the witch's gnarled wooden ladle balanced across the cauldron, gleaming with possibilities.<words>65</words>
My contract to entertain titans had become a gilded cage, and every plucked string lately tasted of stale bread.<words>84</words>
I longed to rejuvenate my spirit, to escape a mundane existence that echoed even in the vaulted ceiling.<words>102</words>
Rumor said the ladle could grant rebirth if one stirred the brew in perfect hush, the wish affirmed by silence.<words>122</words>
Propped against the salt shaker lay a black rock the size of a tortoise egg, its pitted crust unmistakably cosmic.<words>142</words>
I had stolen it from a skyfall market, believing it might free me someday, for the bardic manuals spoke of drawing wonder via the texture of a meteorite's surface.<words>171</words>
Now felt like that day.<words>176</words>
Heart drumming a politely frantic rhythm, I pressed the rock against the broth and heard it hiss like rain on hot tiles.<words>198</words>
Steam thick as memory curled upward, but I dared not sing a note; my petition had to be affirmed by silence.<words>219</words>
Slowly I stirred with the witch's gnarled wooden ladle, its crooked length dwarfing me like a mast on a paper ship.<words>240</words>
The soup cooled to a twilight shade, and the meteoric stone glowed from within as though remembering younger stars.<words>259</words>
In that glow, my openly private wish formed: to walk among ordinary folk again, unseen by colossi, yet singing freely.<words>279</words>
When the giant's footsteps reverberated back down the corridor, the cauldron shimmered and shrank, transforming into a modest teapot beside me.<words>300</words>
The walls contracted, furniture miniaturized, and within three heartbeats I stood in a dining room sized for humans, its grandeur folded into coziness.<words>323</words>
Outside the window, carts rattled and townsfolk hurried, genuine rush hour, yet the quiet indoors held me like new skin.<words>343</words>
My lute strings vibrated without touch, humming a song only I could hear, a melody openly private, finally mine.<words>362</words>
Gentle turmoil lingered, the sweet anxiety of beginnings, but I smiled, tasting the steam of ordinary tea instead of gigantine stew.<words>383</words>
The giant knocked on the now-tiny door, baffled by its size, and his confusion thundered through the hinges, yet he did not see me slip away.<words>409</words>
I carried the meteoric rock in one pocket and the ladle, shrunk to chopstick length, in another, keepsakes of my impossible noon.<words>431</words>
With each step into the bustling street, I felt myself rejuvenate, my freedom affirmed by silence louder than any cheer.<words>451</words>
