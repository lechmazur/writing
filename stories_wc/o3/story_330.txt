Vacant starlight spilled across the zero-gravity dance hall, but Sir Calder knelt where no music played.<words>16</words>
Once a bannered champion, the dejected knight now listened for promises louder than applause.<words>30</words>
His gloved fingers traced the jagged trident prong from a sunken realm that weighed less here than shame.<words>48</words>
Some said the relic could stir tides; he hoped it might quicken a stagnant oath instead.<words>64</words>
Around him, dancers cartwheeled through scented nebulae, bodies obeying a normally abnormal choreography of tumble and twirl.<words>81</words>
Their laughter drifted like confetti under water, each shred a reminder of distances he still feared.<words>97</words>
Deepening horizons, he whispered, were not measured by stars but by the courage to cross them.<words>113</words>
Yet courage decays when unspoken, so he had come to voice a silent vow echoing through ages.<words>130</words>
The watchtower clock, grafted absurdly to the ballroom's dome, suddenly chimed thirteen, an unexpected hour without alignment.<words>147</words>
Metallic echoes pried open hush, and every floating reveler froze mid‑pirouette, lantern eyes widening toward him.<words>163</words>
Time itself tilted, granting Calder the sacred disorder he needed to be heard.<words>176</words>
He rose, boots skimming nothing, and brandished the broken prong like a tuning fork for memory.<words>192</words>
Words failed his tongue, so he let the artifact sing, striking it against the brass ribs of the airlock arch.<words>212</words>
A blue tremor rippled outward, threading through forgotten paths of sound that old architects hid in the walls.<words>230</words>
Subtle doors unrevealed for centuries unlocked, exhaling dust shaped like ancestral silhouettes.<words>242</words>
They gathered about the knight, silent choirs whose faces mirrored his own hunger for redemption.<words>257</words>
Calder realized the vow was never solitary; it belonged to every seeker who drifted between failure and hope.<words>275</words>
He spoke at last, voice low yet rolling, promising to guard thresholds until forgotten paths became roads for all.<words>294</words>
The relic hummed agreement; dancers thawed, their motions now deliberate, charting spirals that mapped new pilgrim routes.<words>311</words>
Outside the dome’s glass, constellations rearranged like counsel, each star a waypoint for those who would follow.<words>328</words>
The clock resumed its ordinary count, yet everyone understood that ordinary here was normally abnormal by design.<words>345</words>
Laughter returned, but it sounded sacred now, aligned with the vow rather than above it.<words>360</words>
Calder lowered the prong, feeling its once crushing weight restored, for burdens are needed when purpose is born.<words>378</words>
He fastened it to his belt and drifted toward an open hatch, horizons deepening ahead like unfolding scripture.<words>396</words>
With one backward glance, he saw the dance hall blooming, as if gravity itself waited to waltz after him.<words>415</words>
Stepping through the hatch, he accepted the long vigil, certain that sacred disorder would quicken worlds yet unnamed.<words>433</words>
