The pause between raindrops stretched like a held breath over the City of Forgotten Fountains.<words>15</words>
Stone basins glimmered with memory while water dared not fall.<words>25</words>
Only one figure moved with purpose through the glazed hush, an unmasked vigilante named Corren.<words>40</words>
Corren was lazily ambitious, drifting between cafe chairs yet always arriving exactly where trouble idled.<words>55</words>
His newest trouble involved the art of resilience and a collection of games older than chess.<words>71</words>
For months he had tried to lure elusive owners of Go stones, Mancala pits, and nine‑men’s‑morris boards.<words>88</words>
He chose charm over threat, but charm required bait.<words>97</words>
So he carried an antique dentist’s drill, its silver handpiece gleaming with eerie promise.<words>111</words>
Collectors, he knew, equated unusual tools with rare moves, and curiosity would tug them closer.<words>126</words>
But discovering where the collectors practiced their quiet rituals required a subtler ear.<words>139</words>
Corren found that ear in the gossip floating around barbershop quartet rehearsals above Mulberry Arcade.<words>154</words>
Between jaunty chords, singers talked louder than trumpets about secret tournaments and legendary dice.<words>168</words>
By analyzing their harmonized rumors, Corren mapped the hidden salons of the city like constellations.<words>183</words>
Each dot promised a fountain long dried and a doorway still damp with play.<words>197</words>
At the precise pause between raindrops one lavender dusk, he set his drill on a marble rim.<words>214</words>
The metallic whirr echoed like a mischievous dentist fixing the weather.<words>225</words>
Soon footsteps approached, hesitant yet magnetized.<words>231</words>
First came Mrs. Varro with a sack of jacks polished to mirror sheen.<words>244</words>
Beside her strode Phelan, balancing a carved wooden yo‑yo that hummed with centrifugal pride.<words>258</words>
Others followed, each carrying a playground in miniature.<words>266</words>
Corren greeted them openly, no mask to hide his wide, rain‑speckled grin.<words>278</words>
He spoke of resilience: how every skipped stone, spun top, or folded paper swan survives through hands that remember.<words>297</words>
The collectors relaxed, hearing devotion instead of theft.<words>305</words>
Yet Corren’s ambition, though lazy in tempo, never napped.<words>314</words>
He proposed a grand exchange: lend him each game for a single season, and receive in return a fountain restored.<words>334</words>
The offer shimmered with impossible logic but irresistible whimsy.<words>343</words>
Mrs. Varro tapped her jacks like castanets, deciding.<words>351</words>
Phelan let his yo‑yo drop, then arrest the fall, then drop again, measuring trust.<words>365</words>
One by one they agreed, surrendering relics to his velvet rucksack.<words>376</words>
Raindrops finally resumed, soft applauding taps upon the marble.<words>385</words>
Water leapt from dormant mouths of stone lions, startled back to life by a pact.<words>400</words>
In the reflected puddles, Corren saw not his own face but the spinning mosaics of every game he would safeguard.<words>420</words>
He felt laziness yawn, yet ambition whispered that resilience also means letting play persist without him.<words>436</words>
So he vanished into the drizzle, drill tucked away, counting future fountains instead of past applause.<words>452</words>
