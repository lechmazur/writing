In Lysogenica, the sprawling bacteria-powered city that hummed like a petri dish, Evin the minstrel trembled backstage. <words>17</words>
He was hailed to sing the civic anthem, yet sincerity felt like someone else's borrowed cloak, itchy and ill-fitting. <words>36</words>
Evin's fingers worried a crumpled photograph of the night sky, a relic from childhood stargazing with his vanished sister. <words>55</words>
She had believed the constellations formed maps for those desperate to escape the ordinary, and he had half-believed her. <words>74</words>
Now, before the lonely candle flame at his dressing table guttered out, he felt her dare rekindling in the molten wax. <words>95</words>
Purpose, he decided, would not be found in another hollow chorus for officials measuring applause in laboratory beakers. <words>113</words>
Tonight he would deploy the only plan he trusted: follow her star patterns beyond the bioluminescent smog and vanish. <words>132</words>
With cautious revelry, he strummed a prelude whose notes shimmered like agar, luring the audience into microbe-lit rapture. <words>150</words>
While their eyes glittered, he slipped from the stage door, the candle extinguishing behind him as though sealing a tomb. <words>170</words>
Steam vents breathed sour warmth along alleyways where bio-engines swallowed refuse and exhaled electricity, painting everything an uneasy emerald. <words>189</words>
Evin's heart pounded arrhythmically, matching the city's bacterial pulses, yet his grin, though rarely sincere, flickered alive. <words>206</words>
He navigated rooftops by recalling the photograph, letting remembered constellations overlay the skyline like transparent sheet music. <words>223</words>
Orion's belt aligned with a smokestack, Cassiopeia crowned the water tower, and each matchlighted point urged him higher. <words>241</words>
Soon he reached the quarantine wall, a living barricade of engineered lichen that fluoresced warnings in shifting colors. <words>259</words>
He tuned his lute string to a frequency rumored to lull the lichen, and the glowing filaments sagged like sleepy eyelids. <words>280</words>
Evin squeezed through, tearing his sleeve but tasting the cold night beyond civilization's petri dish for the first time. <words>299</words>
Above, the authentic stars blazed, untainted by laboratory haze, and he felt the photograph inside his pocket grow lighter. <words>318</words>
Though applause still echoed dimly in his mind, another rhythm replaced itâ€”the quiet percussion of possibilities expanding. <words>335</words>
He whispered to his absent sister that he was finally rewriting the anthem, one silent footstep per constellation. <words>353</words>
Somewhere ahead awaited deserts, oceans, maybe entire choirs of wandering souls, but uncertainty no longer frightened him; it promised purpose. <words>373</words>
He strummed once, sending a single note gliding into the dark like a firefly, and stepped toward its echoing glow. <words>393</words>
Behind him, the bacteria-powered city kept singing without noticing its minstrel gone, while ahead the cosmos hummed a quieter, truer refrain. <words>414</words>
