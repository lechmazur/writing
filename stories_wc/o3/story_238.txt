The abandoned carnival ticket booth creaked like an old throat clearing secrets to the wind. <words>15</words>
Inside, Mercer, the gloomy barkeep, wiped dust from a cracked counter that could never reflect neon again. <words>32</words>
He should have been pouring nightcaps back at the Wharfside Bar, yet something abrasively charming pulled him here. <words>50</words>
In his worn wallet lay a torn photograph of a carousel blazing with impossible light, stolen the moment midnight struck last winter. <words>72</words>
Mercer believed the picture still glowed somewhere, and tonight he meant to reclaim that light. <words>87</words>
Rumor said realities became transient near forgotten funfairs, sliding over each other like wet cards. <words>102</words>
One could step between them at the hush when a truce forms without words, provided one listened closely. <words>120</words>
So Mercer waited, ears tuned to the broken payphone booth leaning beside the ticket window. <words>135</words>
The receiver dangled, spitting static that sometimes twisted into halfâ€“confessions of strangers who'd vanished between sights. <words>151</words>
Tonight the static gathered, wove a voice, and began to drone an apology for stealing luminance from the mortal hour. <words>171</words>
Mercer pressed his forehead to the glass, recognizing the apologizer as the Midnight itself, tired, guilty, and still magnificent. <words>190</words>
Midnight confessed it feared dawn's judgment and had hidden the carousel's glow inside a pocket of gray between minutes. <words>209</words>
It begged Mercer to retrieve the light before hopeful children awakened and found the world permanently dimmer. <words>226</words>
Understanding formed a silent treaty; neither man nor night would mention their loneliness, only what must be done. <words>244</words>
Mercer slipped through the ticket booth door, the hinges sighing as boundaries loosened like drunken arguments settling. <words>261</words>
Colors previously invisible seeped from puddles, coalescing into corridors of flickering booths, each selling fragments of lost evenings. <words>279</words>
Guided by the mournful drone that now served as compass, he navigated to a miniature horizon stitched beneath a tarp. <words>299</words>
There, the carousel stood still, horses frozen mid-rear, their jeweled eyes dark, their mirrors hungry for music. <words>316</words>
Mercer opened his wallet, placing the faded photo against the central column like a memory returning to its body. <words>335</words>
Light spilled out, first timid, then wildly kaleidoscopic, threading the horses with dawn-colors and striking Mercer blind with warmth. <words>354</words>
When his vision steadied, the carnival corridor evaporated, leaving him alone beside the payphone at the ordinary booth. <words>372</words>
The receiver now hummed a lullaby, no longer an accusation, and the sky to the east blushed ahead of schedule. <words>392</words>
Midnight, satisfied, retreated; Mercer felt its gratitude brush his collar like cool cologne in a quiet barroom. <words>409</words>
He pocketed the now-blank photograph, realized the bar's neon would shine brighter tonight, and almost smiled at the thought. <words>428</words>
The carnival booth behind him whispered shut, sealing the truce, while the morning star rehearsed its first note. <words>446</words>
