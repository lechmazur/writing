<story>
The acid rain forest hissed with corrosive drizzle long after the collapse of civilization. <words>14</words>
Within its blistered canopy walked an unassuming monarch, cloak ragged yet crown hidden beneath moss. <words>29</words>
He was lethargically energetic, moving in slow swings that somehow covered great distances between toxic ferns. <words>45</words>
Under one arm he carried a box of mismatched puzzle pieces scavenged from abandoned nurseries. <words>60</words>
His purpose, unfurled like a brittle banner, was to cradle wisdom in rough, calloused hands. <words>75</words>
Legend insisted the wisdom lay dormant somewhere in the ruined jungle, glowing as the ember of choice. <words>92</words>
To find it, the monarch believed, each puzzle shard must align with a secret texture only he could feel. <words>111</words>
He had learned to perceive via the texture of a feather, sliding one along bark to hear patterns. <words>129</words>
When the feather rasped smoothly, a piece belonged; when it snagged, he discarded the shard into the fizzing loam. <words>148</words>
Days dripped by like acid itself, carving holes in armor and patience alike. <words>161</words>
Yet prickly wonder kept the sovereign awake during storm-black nights, studying how lightning etched temporary constellations in vapor. <words>179</words>
He guessed the sky's sketches mirrored the missing image of his impossible puzzle. <words>192</words>
Each dawn, he assembled pieces on a flat basalt stump, only to see the picture collapse like the world had. <words>212</words>
Frustration bubbled, but the ember of choice whispered that surrender was a design too. <words>226</words>
So he chose to wander deeper, where rain burned holes through leaves, revealing silver veins in the wood. <words>244</words>
There, beneath a collapsed monorail, the monarch discovered a final puzzle piece shaped like a curled question mark. <words>262</words>
The feather slid over it with perfect silence, startling him more than any hiss of acid. <words>278</words>
He set the piece upon the stump, nudged others around it, and watched an image of rough hands lifting flame emerge. <words>299</words>
The puzzle now depicted himself, older, offering that flame to unseen heirs across a gulf of cinders. <words>316</words>
Understanding spread through him like cautious wildfire, painful yet cleansing. <words>326</words>
Wisdom was not a relic to pocket; it was the act of choosing amid ruins, then gifting the spark onward. <words>346</words>
He tipped the box, letting remaining pieces tumble into steaming puddles, accepting that incompletion itself could complete the tale. <words>365</words>
Carrying only the feather, the lethargically energetic monarch stepped toward distant children he imagined but had yet to meet. <words>384</words>
Acid rain needled his skin, yet he walked on, cradling unseen wisdom in those rough, calloused hands. <words>401</words>
