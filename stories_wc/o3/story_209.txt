The seasoned woodsman, Alder Finch, heard the final beep of the hospital monitor dissolve into hollow silence.<words>17</words>
That sound stitched despairing cheer into his chest, a paradox humming like trapped wind among old pines.<words>34</words>
Death had just taken his brother, the last cartographer of forgotten railways, and left him the unfinished maps.<words>52</words>
Alder vowed to complete them, to map abandoned railways threading the frontier like veins beneath scarred earth.<words>69</words>
But to begin, he needed the coordinates hidden inside one strange heirloom resting on the deathbed table.<words>86</words>
It was an antique hairbrush whose silver handle concealed micro-etchings only radio waves could faithfully reveal.<words>102</words>
So he traveled to the old transmission site rumored to have become a radio wave garden after abandonment.<words>120</words>
There, towers lay toppled, antennas sprouted like metallic lilies, and ghost broadcasts fluttered over the dusk-lit meadow.<words>137</words>
Alder set the hairbrush on a coil of copper and listened as static sketched outlines of hidden trails.<words>155</words>
The frequencies warbled, then sharpened, narrating longitude and loss in alternating bars of mournful Morse.<words>170</words>
Yet one coordinate refused to emerge, locked behind interference like grief behind stoic eyes.<words>184</words>
A derelict water tower rose nearby, its rusted shell rumored to resonate with past signals when properly sounded.<words>202</words>
Remembering his brother's note, Alder climbed and began measuring the echo in the abandoned water tower with steady knocks.<words>221</words>
Each hollow reply formed a digit, and soon the missing coordinate drummed itself into certainty.<words>236</words>
But the tower's corroded lighting panel sparked, threatening to short-circuit the fragile symphony of returning sound.<words>252</words>
Alder, artfully messy in both beard and spirit, ripped out the live wire and grounded it through his axe.<words>271</words>
Pain lanced his arm, but the echoes stabilized, gifting him the final station on the phantom line.<words>288</words>
Still, the price of knowledge felt unfinished, as though honesty itself remained withheld between him and the dead.<words>306</words>
He descended, placed the hairbrush against his chest, and whispered the confession he had hidden from everyone.<words>323</words>
He had guided their father to the rails years ago, knowing the trestle would collapse, craving inheritance and escape.<words>342</words>
The words slashed open the night, yet the radio garden brightened, its antennas flickering like forgiving fireflies.<words>359</words>
In that raw candor, the coordinate grid rearranged on the receiver, lines straightening as though freed by honesty.<words>377</words>
Alder realized the map now pointed not to iron tracks but to a hospice overlooking the dawn river.<words>395</words>
He smiled in despairing cheer, knowing his own path would end there, during the final beep awaiting him.<words>413</words>
Yet with every station charted and every lie released, he felt lighter than any timber he had felled.<words>431</words>
He gathered the maps, the hairbrush, and his battered axe, and walked into dawn humming with static benedictions.<words>449</words>
Somewhere far behind, the water tower sighed, short-circuit quiet at last, while the garden grew new songs.<words>466</words>
