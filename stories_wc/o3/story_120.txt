I have resuscitated the same child 999 times, and the novelty now feels like an itch of excited boredom I cannot scratch. <words>22</words>
Each loop begins in the humming throat of a quantum tunnel, its walls flickering like ambulance lights swallowed by migraine. <words>42</words>
I am the time‑looping paramedic who remembers every failure but must arrive fresh, privately public in my composure, unseen yet on display. <words>64</words>
The child lies beneath the cracked school bell, and the moment freezes at the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, a cue my mind knows by muscle. <words>91</words>
This time, before compressions, I produce a weathered fishing lure I found lodged in my own ribcage after the first iteration, a souvenir reality keeps rejecting. <words>117</words>
Its barbed shine concentrates the unhealed traumas of everyone I will fail today. <words>130</words>
I nest it inside the child's clenched fist, a tiny promise that pain can hold bait for future calm. <words>149</words>
Then I listen for guidance by the sound of a single raindrop striking the warped gym window, the universe's metronome. <words>169</words>
When it falls, seconds slow, and I press on his sternum in time with that solitary note, breaking ribs but not the loop. <words>192</words>
The child's eyes flutter open just long enough for him to hand the lure back and whisper, 'This belongs to the water, not to wounds.' <words>217</words>
His pulse fades, the bell groans, and the tunnel yawns, yet the statement lingers like adrenaline turned sentimental. <words>235</words>
I realize the mission is not to rescue his breath but to baptize your nightmares in acceptance, and 'your' includes me, my crew, and perhaps eternity itself. <words>262</words>
So, with excited boredom humming like a cracked speaker, I step backward through the tunnel instead of forward, dragging the lure toward distant thunderheads. <words>286</words>
Lightning splits possibilities, and I see thousands of classrooms where the child survives, each branching reality nesting within the next like translucent Russian dolls. <words>310</words>
I choose one and hurl the lure into its river, hearing the splash echo across timelines the way a single raindrop commands silence in a cathedral. <words>336</words>
The child inhales there, the bell applauds, and the tunnel seals behind me like sutured skin healing at last. <words>355</words>
Loop broken, I stand in ordinary rain beside an abandoned playground, privately public with tears, feeling the itch of boredom traded for the thrill of acceptance. <words>381</words>
Nightmares arrive like late parents, but I meet them at the gate, invite them to swing, and we laugh until the sirens finally stay silent. <words>406</words>
