The reclaimed orchard farmland thrived improbably inside the glassy ribs of the toppled skyscraper, where apples dangled beside dangling rebar. <words>20</words>
Marlo Skive, a bluffing swindler who survived by selling air as substance, wandered the rows with calculated innocence. <words>38</words>
He fiddled with a blank price tag, ready to stamp it with impossible value for whichever gullible foreman crossed his path. <words>59</words>
Above him, in the gutted executive loft, a solitary terminal had been spinning its hourglass for days, and tonight it finally restarted. <words>81</words>
The instant the frozen computer blinked alive, a subtle current seemed to magnetize every scrap of metal in the orchard floor. <words>102</words>
Marlo felt that tug and smiled, for his invisible allies always announced themselves through physics no witness could later describe. <words>122</words>
These unseen partners were energetically lethargic, stirring avalanches of change while appearing lazier than midday shadows. <words>138</words>
At that precise shimmer of magnetic whim, a tattered agronomy book slipped from an overhead catwalk and thudded near Marlo's boots. <words>159</words>
Darting to retrieve it, he collided with the orchard's data curator, Liora Quell, whose startled laugh tasted like unfermented cider. <words>179</words>
The meet‑cute, curated by gravity and an unseen committee of ghosts, left them both crouched over the fallen pages. <words>198</words>
Liora noticed the blank price tag twirling between his fingers, her freckled brow sharpening with gentle harshness that scolded yet invited confession. <words>220</words>
"What do you intend to charge for nothing at all?" she asked, voice soft as wool and serrated as pruning shears. <words>241</words>
Marlo, startled by her accuracy, exhaled and decided his long game—baring a truth no one dared to handle—could start now. <words>261</words>
"I sell air," he admitted, "but the air is full of allies who saved this farm; I only invoice their miracles so people notice." <words>285</words>
Liora glanced toward the freshly rebooted terminal blinking through vines above, where market numbers refreshed, erasing evidence of clandestine help. <words>305</words>
"Then let us magnetize attention differently," she murmured, sliding the dropped book toward him like a contract of compost and calculus. <words>326</words>
Together they penned on the blank price tag a single word—'Listen'—and hung it from the tallest apple that still smelled of circuitry. <words>348</words>
By dawn, workers arrived, puzzled by the silent fruit priced at nothing, yet magnetically drawn to pause, inhale, and hear whispers of unseen labor. <words>372</words>
Marlo and Liora leaned against a trellis of steel roots, tasting victory that felt both calmly abrasive and softly redemptive. <words>392</words>
Their energetically lethargic allies rested, rotating dust motes in sunbeams, while the unveiled truth fluttered like a banner no tyrant could fold again. <words>415</words>
