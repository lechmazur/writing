Quen, a curious tinkerer, waited until the city clocks struck the uncanny interval between the hours of remorse and forgiveness. <words>20</words>
He lived in Mechora, a nano-scale city sprawled across the inner surface of a hollow gear, unseen by giants. <words>39</words>
Even here, dust motes loomed like planets, and every screw-thread canyon echoed with lingering grudges. <words>54</words>
Quen nursed one such grudge with ruminative exasperation, aimed at Vhal, the guildsmith who had ruined his earliest automaton. <words>73</words>
Now, remorse gnawed at him like a misaligned cog, and he sought to make amends with his enemy before dusklight. <words>93</words>
The path opened through hopeful excavations beneath oxidized rivets where forgotten relics were said to sleep. <words>109</words>
Among the grit he uncovered a plague doctor’s beaked mask fashioned for an atom-sized healer during the Great Blight. <words>128</words>
Its glass lenses were cracked, but the silver snout still promised secrets of purification. <words>142</words>
Quen believed if he could reforge the mask and gift it to Vhal, their feud might evaporate like solvent vapor. <words>162</words>
Yet materials were scarce and time tighter than a wound spring. <words>173</words>
So he assembled a circle of luminescent wish-filaments, each thread carrying the whispered desire of a neighboring cog-dweller. <words>191</words>
The plan was suspiciously straightforward: tie the wishes together until they formed a forge-hot network, then let their combined yearning melt and reshape the relic. <words>216</words>
Spirals of neon hope writhed up the gearwalls, and the cracked mask floated like a crescent moon above the lattice. <words>236</words>
Interconnected wishes sang of lost siblings, repaired clocks, greener bearings, creating a heat no coal could mimic. <words>253</words>
Quen hammered with a photon mallet, shaping the glowing alloy while recalling every slight he had committed against Vhal. <words>272</words>
Guilt dripped from him, sizzling when it touched the radiance, and the mask healed, its lenses clearing like dawn-lit ice. <words>292</words>
At last the beak gleamed, inscribed with the names of every wish that had fueled its rebirth. <words>309</words>
Carrying it, Quen crossed capillary bridges toward Vhal’s workshop, his heartbeat ticking louder than the city’s master escapement. <words>327</words>
Vhal, hunched over shattered sprockets, looked up ready for argument, but the restored mask reflected both of their worn faces. <words>347</words>
Seeing himself in its mirrored lenses, Vhal understood the woven wishes, the remorse, and the offer, and he exhaled forgiveness that cooled the forge of their animosity. <words>374</words>
The nano-scale city seemed to expand, gears breathing easier as if mechanical tectonics had been oiled by reconciliation. <words>392</words>
Overhead, the wish-filaments dimmed gently, content that their interconnected yearning had finally found a purpose. <words>407</words>
Between remorse and forgiveness, two former foes now stood as co-custodians of a newly reforged future. <words>423</words>
