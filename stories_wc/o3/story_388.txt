Under the soft hush of a distant morning, I steered my battered van toward the northern hills.<words>17</words>
The sudden road trip, sparked by a half‑remembered map, felt inexplicably urgent.<words>29</words>
As a melodic sculptor, I normally hewed melodies from marble blocks, yet today stone hummed restlessly in my backpack.<words>48</words>
Local legends had whispered of a mysterious forest glade at dawn where inspiration roamed like wild deer.<words>65</words>
They promised that anyone peculiarly reliable in purpose could entreat the captive muse who haunted that clearing.<words>82</words>
I aimed to unchain her, for my chisel’s music had grown hoarse and the galleries had stopped listening.<words>100</words>
Ten miles from the rumored path, the van coughed, surrendered smoke, and died beside a roadside greenhouse.<words>117</words>
Inside, rows of botanical specimens shimmered under ultraviolet lamps, leaves twitching like tuning forks between notes.<words>133</words>
A caretaker emerged, her apron dusted with pollen that glowed faintly, as though charged by whispered chords.<words>150</words>
She studied the restless slab peeking from my backpack and declared herself the road’s unexpected meeting.<words>166</words>
"Stone should not vibrate alone," she said, handing me a vial of nocturnal orchid dew harvested only at false midnight.<words>186</words>
Its half‑liquid song calmed the slab’s tremors, and the van purred back to life as if grateful.<words>203</words>
The caretaker merely winked, warning that the muse admired those who persevere through detours not around them.<words>220</words>
I drove again, dawn bleeding pale fire over the treetops, until the forest swallowed the road in moss.<words>238</words>
Leaving the van, I followed birds that chirped like chisels tap‑tap‑tapping marble into breath.<words>252</words>
Their melody guided me to the glade where light stood still, thick as sculpture yet airy as refrain.<words>270</words>
Silence there felt like shouting silence, a paradox that pressed against eardrums until thought rang hollow.<words>286</words>
At the circle’s center, the muse appeared, shackled to an oak whose bark bore scores like staff lines.<words>304</words>
She looked more weary than wondrous, her wings stone‑grey, her throat raw from unsung hymns.<words>319</words>
I knelt, poured the orchid dew over the chain, and pressed the quivering slab against its links.<words>336</words>
Marble absorbed metal’s memory, then cracked apart, releasing notes that spiraled upward like liberated swallows.<words>351</words>
The shackles melted into morning mist, and the muse sighed a chord that stitched forest shadows together.<words>368</words>
In gratitude, she touched my forehead, transferring a stanza of living rhythm straight into bone.<words>383</words>
I felt my craft bloom anew, each future sculpture destined to sing of this dawn’s strange covenant.<words>400</words>
When I finally left, the forest glade closed behind me, its shouting silence now resting inside every beat of my heart.<words>421</words>
