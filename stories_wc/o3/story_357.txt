I arrived at the frost giant's lair clutching my travel crate of battered board games, nerves crackling like thin ice. <words>20</words>
As a focused collector of small experiences, I catalog even the temperature of door hinges. <words>35</words>
The lair, however, cataloged me first, its stalactites chiming greetings in a dialect of dripping crystal. <words>51</words>
A throne of hoar-frost leaned in the gloom, yet on it lounged Kura the giant hostess, wearing mittens embroidered with tiny suns. <words>73</words>
With earnest flippancy she tossed me a sealed envelope, the sudden invitation to a party I allegedly planned. <words>91</words>
I opened it because refusing giants is seldom odd, and usually fatal. <words>103</words>
Inside, on perfumed vellum, were three polite commands: 'Host games, embrace solitude, triumph over despair'. <words>118</words>
The frost giant's echoing chamber brightened as I unpacked dice, cards, and wooden meeples shaped like shivering goats. <words>136</words>
Kura shrank herself to human height, declaring smaller hands made strategy trickier. <words>148</words>
Throughout board game rounds, we played an invented title called 'Labyrinth of Possible Moods' where tokens represented feelings one could never quite name. <words>171</words>
Each time Kura's token neared a gloomy square, she grinned and asked me to narrate a memory until the shadow retreated. <words>192</words>
I spoke of the black rose pinned in a journal I keep, a relic plucked from my mother's funeral garden. <words>212</words>
That bloom never wilts, inked by grief yet preserved by will, and chronicling it taught me the art of embracing solitude. <words>233</words>
The confession made the ice walls shimmer, and I realized the lair itself listened like a sympathetic library. <words>251</words>
But midway through the fifth round, a specter shaped like a starved wolf loped from beneath the throne, introducing itself as Despair, alpha predator of inner spelunking. <words>278</words>
Rules stated that whoever it devoured would lose every pastime forever, including the privacy of thought. <words>294</words>
Kura froze, literal and metaphorical, while I felt cards in my palm unravel like frightened confetti. <words>310</words>
Remembering the invitation's third command, I flipped open my journal, detached the black rose, and set it on the central space of the board. <words>334</words>
Its petals blew apart into charcoal snow, spelling palindromic mantras--'seldom odd' among them--that looped Despair in a cage of mirrored language. <words>355</words>
The beast howled but each echo returned to chew its tail, until, embarrassed, it agreed to play rather than prey. <words>375</words>
We dealt it a token labeled 'Possible Joy', and it sulked into the scoring track like a reformed hooligan. <words>394</words>
By the final tally, Kura and I lost the game but won the evening, because triumph was never about points but about giving despair something to count besides us. <words>423</words>
