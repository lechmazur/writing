Before the brass clock struck again, Lio Wherrin lurked inside the haunted lighthouse engine room.<words>15</words>
He was a baffled pickpocket who had just discovered pockets can also steal back.<words>29</words>
Tonight, between appointments with oblivious tourists, he hunted for an explanation.<words>40</words>
Instead he found an eerie ventriloquist dummy propped against a rusted piston, grinning a varnished grin.<words>56</words>
Its mahogany mouth opened without hands, reciting verses in a voice confusingly lucid and scaldingly calm.<words>72</words>
The dummy declared that the engines below the beacon were turbines of identity, forever refining the art of transformation.<words>91</words>
Lio, who barely understood metaphysics, felt pocket after pocket on his coat squirm, as if carrying secrets longing to escape.<words>111</words>
He tried to flee, yet the lighthouse gears seized, forcing him to sustain attention the way a thief sustains breath while slicing thread.<words>134</words>
The dummy offered release through impromptu poetry sessions, promising they would unlock the pockets and the past.<words>151</words>
Lio scoffed, yet flaming curiosity licked his ribs.<words>159</words>
With scorching poise he straightened, snapped his fingers, and demanded the first line.<words>172</words>
The dummy intoned, 'Rust remembers after flesh forgets,' and an unseen wave rattled the bronze rivets overhead.<words>189</words>
Fearing he might drown in meaning, Lio responded, 'Yet memory pickpockets rust, pocketing the shimmer of its regret.'<words>207</words>
One pocket split open, spilling silver buttons engraved with dates he had never lived.<words>221</words>
Each button clinked down the grated floor and ignited spectral steam that swirled like auroras chained to iron.<words>239</words>
The dummy urged him to continue, for only sustained verse could temper the metamorphic engines.<words>254</words>
Lio inhaled brine and oil, then whispered, 'Transform not the shape but the hunger of the shape-shifter.'<words>271</words>
A second pocket tore, releasing a watch he had lifted that afternoon, its hands now spinning backward like a rewound threat.<words>292</words>
Time contracted, and the narrow window blinked with thunderstorms from decades yet unborn.<words>305</words>
Lio tasted electricity and knew the lighthouse had become both prison and palette.<words>318</words>
He realized the dummy was no mere wooden trick but the lighthouse's tongue, yearning to rewrite maritime law and moral law alike.<words>340</words>
By sustaining their duet, he could challenge the status quo and absolve himself of theft by stealing stagnation instead.<words>359</words>
So he chanted, 'Let gears dream of oceans, let pockets dream of openness, let dummies dream of skin.'<words>377</words>
All the remaining pockets burst like ripe pods, freeing coins, maps, and whispered apologies that whirled into the engine fires.<words>397</words>
The turbines glowed violet, slowed, then exhaled a calm beam that replaced the lighthouse's normal white flash.<words>414</words>
Sailors outside, seeing this reborn beacon, would question every chart, every harbor tax, every superstition.<words>429</words>
Inside, Lio stood empty-pocketed yet overflowing, the dummy now silent on his arm like a respectful scar.<words>446</words>
Between appointments no longer mattered; time itself had accepted a new schedule, written in impromptu stanzas of heat and mercy.<words>466</words>
And the baffled pickpocket, guided by scorching poise, walked upstairs to teach the keeper how to listen.<words>483</words>
