On the time dilation observation deck, Orin Vale—the most awkward champion the multiverse ever accidentally applauded—paced in anxious circles. <words>19</words>
He waited for dough to rise in a brass kiln, because throughout baking the minutes stretched like centuries and revealed secrets. <words>40</words>
Those centuries shimmered before the deck windows as translucent ribbons of alternate nows, each humming with decisions never made. <words>59</words>
Orin's goal, whispered only to the dough, was to birth an entirely new philosophy from those refracted timelines. <words>77</words>
He believed the flavor of enlightenment improved when kneaded with haunting delight rather than solemn dread. <words>93</words>
Still, his hands trembled, and flour drifted like startled ghosts across his spectacles. <words>106</words>
To calm himself, he uncorked a thunderstorm in a bottle and let miniature lightning pinprick the stale air. <words>124</words>
Raindrops pattered against the metal railing, playing rhythms only individually general minds could hear—personal yet universal, intimate yet cosmic. <words>143</words>
Orin listened for the staccato of quiet benedictions hidden within the storm’s cadence. <words>156</words>
Whenever a benediction surfaced, he captured it through cryptic doodles on concert tickets stuffed in his apron pocket. <words>174</words>
Swirls became verbs, lightning bolts became arguments, and torn edges served as punctuation for this unborn doctrine. <words>191</words>
Yet symbols alone could not fuse his insights into coherence; the bread itself had to rise as living proof. <words>210</words>
He returned to the kiln and felt the temporal field thicken, seconds layering like filo pastry around the glowing loaf. <words>230</words>
Inside those layers, he glimpsed futures where violence was considered clumsy etiquette, and wondered how his philosophy might avert them. <words>250</words>
The storm-in-a-bottle crackled louder, jealous of the kiln’s radiance, and the two energies threatened to split reality like wet clay. <words>270</words>
Thinking quickly, Orin opened both doors and let steam and thunder mingle, hoping contrast would harmonize rather than combust. <words>289</words>
The opposing vapors curled into a silver helix, and a low choir of gusts recited quiet benedictions in reverse. <words>308</words>
Orin annotated the reversal on another ticket, realizing that contradiction itself might be the yeast of worldview. <words>325</words>
As the loaf browned, letters formed in its crust, spelling a theorem only visible when light struck at an impossible angle. <words>346</words>
He rotated the bread, and each new angle delivered another clause, until a full manifesto sizzled across the surface. <words>365</words>
The manifesto argued that beings were simultaneously solitary and communal, individually general, as a chord is both note and harmony. <words>385</words>
Rich aroma flooded the deck, and observers from slower epochs drifted near, wearing curiosity like mismatched gloves. <words>402</words>
They tasted slices sprinkled with storm salt, and their widened eyes confirmed Orin had indeed baked a theology of haunting delight. <words>423</words>
Quiet benedictions fluttered around their tongues, settling as gentle thunder in their throats. <words>436</words>
Even the deck’s chronometers paused, savoring the moment before resuming their relentless tick toward divergent tomorrows. <words>452</words>
Orin bowled an awkward bow, scattering ash of spent lightning, and offered the last crust to the widening sky. <words>471</words>
Somewhere beyond the clouds, new storms gathered, already nibbling at his philosophy like eager apprentices preparing fresh dough. <words>489</words>
