I awoke in the haunted mansion graveyard, hungover from stout experiments and annoyed that the protest had paused just when slogans were peaking.<words>23</words>
A groggy brewer is not what legend demands of revolution, yet I shuffled past mossy headstones like a reluctant ghost host.<words>44</words>
The lull between chants made the air awkward, as if megaphones were clearing their throats behind crypt doors.<words>62</words>
I sought coffee but found instead a piece of a broken mirror glinting beside a toppled urn.<words>79</words>
Its shard reflected a sky sucking light, a reminder of the encroaching darkness rumored to initiate from this very estate.<words>99</words>
They said the doom began via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase inside the mansion, like rot tasting the air.<words>121</words>
Uniquely generic, that stain supposedly matched every bureaucrat's necktie, a cosmic joke whose punchline nobody laughs at twice.<words>139</words>
Still, my motive was clear as filtered ale: to become a living embodiment of one's values, not merely a brewer of agreeable suds.<words>162</words>
So I pocketed the mirror shard, hoping character could ferment in reflective surfaces the way malts release sugar.<words>180</words>
From the protest line beyond the iron fence, voices began to gather again, low at first, then swelling like kettle steam.<words>201</words>
Their rumble nudged me toward the mansion, because every revolution needs reconnaissance and maybe a surprise taproom.<words>218</words>
Passing the portico, I felt the temperature slip as though the house had exhaled cellar air seasoned with centuries of spilled confession.<words>240</words>
Inside, moonlight painted the dusty spiral staircase, and there it was—the discoloration, a bruise on time's ankle.<words>257</words>
Feeling half prophet, half bartender, I touched it with the mirror shard, expecting sparks or at least a coupon for enlightenment.<words>278</words>
Instead, the stair groaned and the entire mansion graveyard flickered, as if reality were a neon sign losing power.<words>297</words>
The encroaching darkness seeped through floorboards like stout through a cracked cask, but I refused to let it ferment unchecked.<words>317</words>
Recalling bardic recipes for light, I initiated a toast, raising the shard as though it were a crystal goblet.<words>336</words>
My voice, flippant yet solemn, rang: 'To clarity, comrades—may we remain sparkling, even when bottled by fear!'<words>353</words>
The protestors outside echoed the cheer, and the mansion's windows pulsed, accepting the communion like dusty throats swallowing hope.<words>372</words>
Light refracted from the shard, surged down the stairs, and bled into graves, sketching silhouettes of ideals too stubborn to die.<words>393</words>
Headstones sprouted slogans, vines spelled manifestos, and the encroaching darkness retreated as if allergic to articulated conviction.<words>410</words>
I grinned, finally upright in both posture and purpose, aware I had brewed something finer than any barrel could hold.<words>430</words>
Outside, the protest hit full volume, yet I heard harmony, the uniquely generic anthem of people who suddenly tasted themselves in history.<words>452</words>
In their roar and the mansion's hush, I felt my values standing, living, and slightly tipsy beside me, ready for another round.<words>474</words>
