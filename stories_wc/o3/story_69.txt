Dusty sunlight slid through rotating fan blades in Volio's hologram repair shop, painting stalled projections with sleepy rainbows. <words>18</words>
Volio, an uncertain druid who had traded oaken groves for circuitry, leaned on the counter nursing a dented lunch tin. <words>38</words>
His apprenticeship contract had expired, yet ties of obligation kept him open throughout library hours, matching municipal schedules he barely respected. <words>59</words>
Customers were rare; holograms today mended themselves, leaving Volio to wander mentally among the sparks of older memories. <words>77</words>
He desired, with lethargic excitement, to forge beauty from anarchy, but no stage invited him. <words>92</words>
Then a cracked projector coughed out a flyer made of light, advertising back‑alley theater auditions for an avant‑chaos revue. <words>111</words>
The flyer flickered, uniquely common amid glitches, as though destiny wore thrift‑store clothes. <words>124</words>
Volio packed micro‑solder tools into the lunch tin, locked the shop’s door, and followed the holographic crumbs outside. <words>142</words>
The city languished in summer haze, its alleys breathing reheated steam and half‑remembered music. <words>156</words>
At each rusted fire escape another luminous arrow pulsed, urging him to wander through back‑alley theater auditions like a pilgrim with stage fright. <words>179</words>
Inside a crumbling brick loft he found performers reciting code instead of lines, hacking props until narrative crashed into noise. <words>199</words>
The director, masked by kaleidoscopic pixels, sought someone who could repair illusions while letting them bleed. <words>215</words>
Volio’s hesitant reputation preceded him; rumor said an uncertain druid understands both growth and decay, silicon and sap. <words>233</words>
He opened the dented lunch tin, revealing a garden of miniature wires coiled like ivy around chips, uniquely common tools reborn as flora. <words>256</words>
With languid gestures he grafted broken hologram stems to rogue sound loops, coaxing flickers into petals of shimmering static. <words>275</words>
The rehearsal space settled into hush, a lethargic excitement humming like drowsy applause from a dreaming audience. <words>292</words>
Yet Volio felt the old ties of obligation tugging, reminding him the library downstairs would close soon, and patrons expected working holograms. <words>314</words>
He bargained with the director: let the troupe rehearse in the shop throughout library hours, and he'd weave chaos into readable myths nightly. <words>337</words>
The director agreed, sensing artistry in civic routine, anarchy tethered by timetable. <words>349</words>
So, every day, projectors, actors, and whispered code migrated to the hologram repair shop when the librarians unlocked the doors, and beauty sprouted amid humming servers. <words>375</words>
Volio mended overdue reference holograms while the cast rehearsed behind him, the two rhythms braiding like ivy around rusted steel. <words>395</words>
Patrons borrowed stories that now breathed, each checkout blooming with flickering flowers, and nobody noticed the revolutionary lull pressing through the aisles. <words>417</words>
Eventually city officials praised the strangely disciplined vibrancy, calling it uniquely common culture, never suspecting a tired druid had simply aligned obligation with wonder. <words>441</words>
He would smile, tap his dented lunch tin like a drum, and let the lethargic excitement continue wandering through anyone willing to look sideways. <words>465</words>
