The confident watchman Varro strode along the amber corridors of the giant beehive interior, lantern buzzing in sympathy with the resident drones’ wings.<words>23</words>
He kept his posture forcibly gentle, as though his muscles might bruise the wax walls if allowed full swagger.<words>42</words>
Yet beneath that controlled grace pulsed the echo of yearning, a chime only he could hear whenever honeyed shadows whispered of freedoms beyond duty.<words>66</words>
The queen’s artisans, seated on mushroom stools, invited him to oversee their coloring sessions, during which they painted hexagonal murals for newborn larvae.<words>89</words>
Supervising pigment jars felt trivial, but Varro welcomed the assignment because envy hissed loudest whenever he stood still.<words>107</words>
To hush the voice of envy, he had vowed to mobilize every sense, every minute muscle, and every captured sigh toward communal purpose.<words>130</words>
That morning, an apprentice shattered her measuring tool, leaving a cracked plastic ruler gleaming like broken ice beside the paint trays.<words>151</words>
The fragment’s jagged edges mirrored the splinter in Varro’s heart, and jubilation twined with remorse when he realized opportunity hid inside the fissure.<words>174</words>
Requesting privacy under the guise of safety inspection, he carried the ruler to his watchman’s alcove, where a brass microscope awaited clandestine experiments.<words>197</words>
Pressing the fractured ruler against a nectar‑sticky thumbprint, he studied the patterns in a fingerprint under a microscope, hunting coordinates whispered by forbidden legend.<words>221</words>
The swirling whorls aligned with the ruler’s cracks to sketch an exit route through forgotten tunnels, a map singing only for one who yearned without greed.<words>247</words>
Varro’s chest flooded with honey‑bright joy, then cooled into syrupy guilt, for abandoning post would betray the larvae he had sworn to protect.<words>270</words>
He paced the wax corridors, the droning choir around him swelling like applause and accusation, until a compromise blossomed in bittersweet light.<words>292</words>
If he guided the artisans safely to the outer gardens, letting them trade mural pigments for pollen rarities, both hive and heart might be nourished.<words>317</words>
Thus, throughout coloring sessions, he secretly rehearsed the route, training the apprentices to walk in silent zigzags that matched the fingerprint map’s hidden rhythm.<words>341</words>
His instruction remained forcibly gentle, a hushed dance of gestures and jokes so soft the drones mistook it for ordinary cheer.<words>362</words>
When the destined night arrived, Varro mobilized the small procession, ruler shards glinting as ceremonial badges, and led them toward the labyrinth’s dim threshold.<words>386</words>
Every step rang with jubilant remorse, each echo of yearning both propelling and restraining him, until the final wax wall melted into moonlit meadow.<words>410</words>
He watched the artisans scatter among tall flowers, gathering colors impossible inside the hive, and the envious whisper within him faded to a quiet hum.<words>435</words>
Varro turned back alone, ready to accept any punishment, confident that his trespass had preserved wonder rather than stolen it.<words>455</words>
