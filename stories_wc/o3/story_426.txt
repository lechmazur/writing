Midnight lightning flickered over the abandoned funfair as I slipped inside. <words>11</words>
Everyone calls me Lucien, the secretive pathfinder nobody remembers meeting twice. <words>22</words>
I was once the forgotten prodigy of cartography, mapping silence between stars. <words>34</words>
Now I chart haunted places for reasons even I pretend are unclear. <words>46</words>
The ghost train crouched at the park’s center, tracks sighing like tired bones. <words>59</words>
Under my coat clinked a cracked porcelain teapot filled with fennel seeds. <words>71</words>
Grandmother’s last batch of folk medicines depended on those seeds staying whole. <words>83</words>
The marathon I was training for ran tomorrow, but tonight mattered more. <words>95</words>
During long sunrise runs, I studied the ghost train’s perimeter, pacing my breath. <words>108</words>
I sensed the ride stored forgotten tracks, literal and musical, beneath rotten planks. <words>121</words>
So I hacked the park’s bizarre online playlists, decoding hidden coordinates in lyrics. <words>134</words>
Each secret chorus detailed where spirits hoarded stolen artifacts for petty eternity. <words>146</words>
Tonight the teapot must replace a cursed top hat controlling the locomotive. <words>158</words>
Otherwise the train would keep harvesting bones instead of herbal memories. <words>169</words>
I moved angrily peaceful, fury coursing inward yet footsteps quiet as prayer. <words>181</words>
My aloof passion frightened even the waiting ghosts, who parted like curtains. <words>193</words>
Inside the first carriage a child apparition sobbed, face smeared with nebula dust. <words>206</words>
He was Oliver, another forgotten prodigy, pianist of storms, now trapped in loops. <words>219</words>
I offered him a hug, and porcelain chattered like teeth between our chests. <words>232</words>
Warmth passed though neither of us had bodies capable of holding it. <words>244</words>
In exchange he whispered the last password controlling the ride’s phantom switchboard. <words>256</words>
I sprinted along the line, marathon legs grateful for midnight interval training. <words>268</words>
Rust coated the panel, but my fingers remembered code like muscle remembers hills. <words>281</words>
One keystroke swapped playlist channels, routing Oliver’s lullaby into the iron throat. <words>293</words>
The locomotive shivered, releasing trapped screams as steam scented with fennel. <words>304</words>
I poured the seeds through the smokestack, teapot glowing despite its cracks. <words>316</words>
Medicinal vapor drifted, weaving designs older than any fairground concession. <words>326</words>
Ghost passengers inhaled, their translucent veins pulsing green and gold like woodland infusions. <words>339</words>
The top hat melted, reshaping into harmless clay, while Oliver’s chains unhooked. <words>351</words>
Music shifted to clattering hooves, signaling the switchboard had accepted the new map. <words>364</words>
I remained aloof, yet passion flickered when Oliver started laughing instead of crying. <words>377</words>
He thanked me by embedding coordinates to lost herb gardens inside every surviving file. <words>391</words>
Tomorrow, during the marathon, runners would stream those tracks for motivation unknowingly. <words>403</words>
Their earbuds would disperse coded pollen across the city, reseeding medicine wherever sweat fell. <words>417</words>
My mission to preserve folk medicines would succeed through rhythm, breath, and forward motion. <words>431</words>
Behind me the ghost train exhaled gratitude, finally allowed to rest without hunger. <words>444</words>
I slipped away before dawn, angrily peaceful again, forgotten yet fulfilled. <words>455</words>
