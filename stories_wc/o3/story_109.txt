Silver fog pooled around the deserted intersection, swallowing streetlamps until only a hush remained.<words>14</words>
I waited there, heart synchronized with the traffic light's silent cycle, smelling rain and burnt brake pads.<words>31</words>
Officially, I am Sir Caelum, a cold-natured knight seconded to the national secret agent center.<words>46</words>
Unofficially, tonight I hunt whispered medicines for children who cough blood in remote valleys.<words>60</words>
Folk remedies are contraband, yet I uphold the crown by breaking such laws when conscience orders.<words>76</words>
That paradox is my lawfully rebellious creed.<words>83</words>
A coded text had directed me to recover a single clue: a child's lost mitten placed as ransom.<words>101</words>
When the traffic light blinked amber, the mitten appeared on the curb like a tiny red flag.<words>118</words>
I knelt, metal greaves clicking, and slid the wool into my gauntlet.<words>130</words>
Instant warmth pulsed through frozen veins, then visions spilled across the intersection's wet asphalt.<words>144</words>
I saw incomplete family altars--stone tables missing candles--standing in cottages where creativity had withered.<words>158</words>
The mitten was not ransom but key: each altar awaited a support to reignite ancestral songs.<words>174</words>
I understood then that my mission was broader than medicine; it demanded artistic awakening.<words>188</words>
Without songs, no remedy could root, and children would keep bleeding into snow.<words>201</words>
I rose and followed the secret tunnel that every intersection in this city conceals.<words>215</words>
It led straight beneath pavement to the fluorescent belly of the agent center.<words>228</words>
There, rows of monitors tracked dissidents, yet no screen showed the country's starving painters.<words>242</words>
My breath fogged my visor; I felt suddenly unbearably close to every unseen prisoner.<words>256</words>
I moved among the desks, dropping the mitten into an evidence tube labeled 'low priority'.<words>271</words>
Then I hacked the dispatch mainframe and rerouted all patrols toward empty warehouses.<words>284</words>
With cameras looped, I carried crates of confiscated altarpieces to my waiting horse in the loading bay.<words>301</words>
Each crate rattled like bones eager for skin.<words>309</words>
I galloped toward the highlands, guided by smoldering constellations and the soft map inside my chest.<words>325</words>
Before dawn I reached the first cottage, where a grandmother stirred licorice into goat milk.<words>340</words>
Her altar lacked the northern candle, so I set a carved cedar taper onto the stone.<words>356</words>
Flame blossomed, painting warm color across her weary face, and my own frost cracked.<words>370</words>
Music neither of us recognized drifted from the rafters, thick with dust and possibility.<words>384</words>
She pressed a vial of birch-sap syrup into my palm, murmuring that the forest approved.<words>399</words>
Riding onward, I felt the world thaw, and for the first time the knight dreamed in color.<words>416</words>
