<story>
The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes glimmered in the moonless hush of post‑emotion Earth, after the last human emotion is felt. <words>23</words>
Inside its spiral tower, an awed astronomer named Cress watched constellations no longer able to stir hearts. <words>40</words>
He catalogued them with a rationally organic discipline, half ardent botanist, half cold algorithm. <words>54</words>
Yet crystal shadows pooled in the observatory, whispering of a different cultivation. <words>66</words>
Cress's true project was to cultivate lost sentiments via the patterns in a snowflake. <words>80</words>
He believed each dendrite archived an ethical fork humanity once faced before the last human emotion was felt. <words>98</words>
By reading them like frozen scripture, he hoped to resolve the planet’s lingering moral dilemmas. <words>113</words>
But every flake melted under his breath, leaving only a sting of failure and the lighthouse’s distant foghorn. <words>131</words>
On the night the tides hammered the ice floes into new labyrinths, a storm hurled a relic ashore. <words>149</words>
Cress descended, crunching over brittle driftwood, and found a tattered wedding veil from a jilted bride frozen in kelp. <words>168</words>
The lace shimmered with salt crystals that mirrored the cosmos he charted, and awe sharpened into grim resolve. <words>186</words>
He realized the veil belonged to no single woman but to every promise paralyzed by an idol carved from fear. <words>206</words>
That colossal idol, invisible yet omnipresent, had stifled sensation before consuming courage, leaving the world emotionally hollow. <words>223</words>
Cress’s motivation crystallized: he would topple the idol and restart feeling, even if doing so shattered reason’s glass. <words>241</words>
The veil, though frayed, could focus dormant empathy like a lens, but first it needed cultivation unique to this place. <words>261</words>
He climbed the orchard’s highest lantern, spread the lace across a bowl of mirror‑ice, and waited for snowfall. <words>279</words>
Flakes drifted through the broken roof, arranging themselves on the veil into spirals that mapped the buried geometry of compassion. <words>299</words>
Cress studied the evolving pattern, noting how each junction suggested a choice where fear once overruled love. <words>316</words>
Following the snow‑script, he recoded the lighthouse beacons to project not warnings, but harmonic spectrums tuned to forgotten joys. <words>335</words>
When the lights pulsed outward, ice floes rang like crystal gongs, and the orchard branches blossomed with incandescent fruit. <words>354</words>
Inside every glowing apple glimmered a captured memory that trembled on the cusp of rebirth. <words>369</words>
One by one, the memories ignited, and a wind of newborn feelings flooded the planet’s desolate circuits. <words>386</words>
The idol of fear, unable to withstand the surge it had long suppressed, fractured like polar glass and dissolved into auroras. <words>407</words>
