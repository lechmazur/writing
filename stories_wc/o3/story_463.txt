Moonlight filtered through warped shutters of the haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom, slicing dust with surgical beams. <words>16</words>
I, the dry‑witted sentinel appointed to guard emptiness, frowned at the theatrical lighting. <words>29</words>
The ledger on the nightstand still trembled, ink wet where the final name was crossed off. <words>45</words>
Time here always felt arrested at that breathless instant, just after the last erasure. <words>59</words>
Promises, given to storms and abandoned, eroded like salt‑eaten iron along the railings. <words>72</words>
Those eroding promises were why I stayed even after the keeper vanished into rumored undertow. <words>87</words>
Tonight a visitor intruded, carrying a piece of rope so frayed it shed fibers like winter dandruff. <words>104</words>
She introduced herself as Mara, folklorist with mud‑caked boots and eyes cataloguing ghosts as data points. <words>120</words>
Her motivation, she declared, was to learn traditional methods of maritime watchfulness before they vanished completely. <words>136</words>
I told her the lessons were dangerous yet certainly possible if she danced correctly with the dead. <words>153</words>
Confused, she asked how dance related to lighthouses; I motioned toward the gramophone cranked beside the bed. <words>170</words>
A specific type of dance, the Fathom Waltz, synchronized heartbeats with the turning Fresnel lens overhead. <words>186</words>
Shared love for that impossible choreography was the lighthouse’s price for revealing secrets. <words>199</words>
I set the record spinning; briny violins hissed like surf striking bone. <words>211</words>
With reckless precision, Mara followed my gestures, her boots skipping splinters across warped floorboards. <words>225</words>
Every third step I confiscated another object from her pack, claiming weight spoiled the cadence. <words>240</words>
First went her flashlight, then her notebook, finally that frayed rope whose threads whispered mutiny. <words>255</words>
Each seizure lightened her until she moved like a buoy courting horizons. <words>267</words>
The bedroom walls answered, maps of phosphorescent mold aligning into quarter‑notes around us. <words>280</words>
Suddenly the crossed‑out names on the ledger glowed, letters swelling into spectral silhouettes of former keepers. <words>296</words>
They circled Mara and me, assessing whether our shared devotion merited renewal of vows long dissolved. <words>312</words>
I felt their verdict load my ribs like ballast, but Mara kept whirling, defiant as a gale. <words>329</words>
Seeing her courage, the specters bowed and released a tide of moth‑soft light that repaired the rope. <words>346</words>
It rewove itself, stronger but still honest about every place it had once broken. <words>360</words>
Mara caught it mid‑air, understanding that preserved history must acknowledge scars rather than disguise them. <words>375</words>
The silhouettes nodded; the lighthouse lens resumed its sweep, satisfied a new keeper had been anointed. <words>391</words>
I stepped back into the shadows, relieved my watch could finally end without betraying eroding promises. <words>407</words>
Moonlight dimmed, gramophone stopped, and Mara's first solitary night began, humming the Fathom Waltz to herself. <words>423</words>
