Lightning hiccupped across the mountaintop as the power failed, dimming every bulb except the stars. <words>15</words>
In that sudden hush, the weathered poet Ilan exhaled and tasted iron on the wind. <words>30</words>
Power outages were his secret muses, stripping the world to ink, breath, and the shuffle of pages. <words>47</words>
Tonight, however, he walked the blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests surrounding the summit tea house. <words>62</words>
Miniature maples arched over gravel corridors, their petal snow glowing eerie pink beneath slivered moonlight. <words>77</words>
Each twist felt like an artery of the mountain, and Ilan meant to map these sacred flows. <words>94</words>
His motivation was cartographic and devotional, but also a dare against the silence gathering behind him. <words>110</words>
He carried an unmarked makeup compact, its mirrored lid smudged with fingerprints from older nights of wandering. <words>127</words>
Whenever path and breath knotted, he flipped the compact open, catching constellations and bonsai silhouettes to orient himself. <words>145</words>
Yet the mirror also showed his face, ideally messy with drizzle, ink stains, and decades of half‑healed poems. <words>163</words>
Joy vibrated inside him like a struck bell, but dread coiled just beneath, whispering of wrong turns. <words>180</words>
At a fork of cedar and plum, he discovered a circle of extinguished lanterns and a stack of paper coffee cups. <words>201</words>
Rain had tattooed the sleeves with blurry ink, but confessions still breathed between watermarks. <words>215</words>
Ilan knelt, grasp each cup like a relic, decyphering the path by reading confessions on coffee cup sleeves. <words>233</words>
One sleeve said, 'Invitation to breathe: inhale thunder, exhale roots,' and the poet’s lungs obeyed before his mind protested. <words>252</words>
Another sleeve confessed, 'If you get lost, follow the power cut; darkness outlines the paths meant for you.' <words>270</words>
Shivering, Ilan realized someone else curated this labyrinth narrative, guiding wanderers precisely when the grid failed. <words>286</words>
The joyful dread surged, a twin tide urging him forward yet warning of undertows crafted from intimate ink. <words>304</words>
He continued, reading more sleeves until they formed a breathing map of verbs, arrows, and heartbeat doodles. <words>321</words>
Aligning the paper clues with bonsai alleys, he traced a spiral toward the mountain’s silent navel. <words>337</words>
There, electricity crackled faintly where a broken transformer hummed like a caged cicada, the only machine still alive. <words>355</words>
He opened the compact once more, angling mirror and moon to reflect a silver thread between copper coils. <words>373</words>
Mapping sacred flows suddenly meant re‑lighting them; his breath misted the glass, and he whispered the labyrinth’s invitation to breathe. <words>393</words>
With a decisive grasp, he pressed the mirror against the transformer, redirecting starlight into the copper like liquid dawn. <words>412</words>
Lanterns winked awake down every corridor, illuminating the ideally messy map his sleeves and heart had co‑authored. <words>429</words>
Joy outweighed dread at last, for the poet had woven darkness, confession, and bonsai bloom into breathing light. <words>447</words>
