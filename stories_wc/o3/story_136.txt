Before there were names for years, the root system mapping facility stood beneath a newborn continent. <words>16</words>
Its corridors glowed with fungus light, pulsing like the memory of tides still unrecorded. <words>30</words>
Inside lab nine, Liora the quiet matchmaker listened to tree roots gossip through bone‑conduction rods. <words>45</words>
Though her mouth seldom moved, her eyes flashed with silently talkative sparks that made apprentices step back. <words>62</words>
She sought to decode natural patterns, believing each tangled filament inscribed a secret about the cycle of rebirth. <words>80</words>
Mariners never reached this land, yet Liora treasured a salt‑stained mariner’s log book passed down by wanderers. <words>97</words>
Its brittle pages described stars mirrored in water, helping her translate dendritic maps into celestial drift. <words>113</words>
One page hinted that consciousness sailed shore to shore like a looped current, dying only to start again. <words>131</words>
That whisper became her guiding tide. <words>137</words>
Yet the Council of Anatomists demanded faster results, threatening to drain the fungal generators and repurpose the hall. <words>155</words>
Their impatience would jeopardize decades of living data tangled beneath the floors. <words>167</words>
Desperate, Liora rewired an outdated VR headset left by a mythic surveyor whose bones fertilized the archive garden. <words>185</words>
She threaded root tendrils into the visor’s cracked ports, creating a helm through which memories could bloom as light. <words>204</words>
When she donned it, pain lanced her skull, but joy answered, singing with the voices of countless germinations. <words>222</words>
Roots remembered being seeds, seeds remembered being ash, ash remembered dancing inside suns—each admission a pulse of rebirth. <words>240</words>
Through the headset, those pulses resolved into luminous equations the Council could finally read. <words>254</words>
But every revelation scorched a layer of Liora’s memory, trading her own cycles for the facility’s salvation. <words>271</words>
Silently, she paired root with star, fungus with tide, apprentice with question, matching each to its future echo. <words>289</words>
The Council watched, awed, forgetting their threats as the room filled with branching constellations of living code. <words>306</words>
When the final pattern closed upon itself, the headset shattered like a dried husk. <words>320</words>
Liora fell, smiling through tears the roots quickly drank. <words>329</words>
In their xylem, her memories germinated into faint electrical murmurs, promising new occasions for painful joy. <words>345</words>
The apprentices inherited the mariner’s log book and the broken helm, artifacts now humming in sympathetic cadence. <words>362</words>
They understood that to honor their mentor they must navigate recurring deaths with the grace of drifting spores. <words>380</words>
So the facility’s future agendas were etched not on clay tablets but on living bark, rewritten each season. <words>398</words>
Every spring, new matchmakers listened, silently talkative beneath the soil, eager to jeopardize certainty and begin again. <words>415</words>
