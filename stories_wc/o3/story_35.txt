At the Universal Translation Center, where holographic syntax bloomed like stained glass across the ceilings, a quiet gardener named Orrin arrived carrying only an embroidered purse.<words>26</words>
He tended rooftop orchids that nourished the algorithms, yet his improbable longing was not for plants but for speech itself.<words>46</words>
Years earlier, during a shared experience at a silent retreat amid bird calls, conversation had been forbidden, and something inside him had flickered awake.<words>70</words>
Fragments of forgotten dialogue now drifted through his mind with regularly random cadence, as though the retreat's hush still translated warbling wrens into half-remembered syllables.<words>95</words>
Orrin believed these recovered memories held the key to understanding the language of emotions the Center struggled to decode for diplomats, refugees, and starfarers.<words>119</words>
But administrators spoke only in crisp metrics, dismissing feelings as statistical outliers, so he whispered his theory to the orchids instead, watering them with confessions.<words>144</words>
One dawn, a diplomatic courier from the Avian Coalition arrived, her eyes painting sorrow no algorithm could chart, her hands clutched around the same embroidered purse Orrin carried.<words>172</words>
Identical stitches of cobalt thread formed a constellation that seemed to flicker whenever sunlight touched it, as if two purses remembered a night sky together.<words>197</words>
The coincidence cracked open Orrin’s reserve, and he invited the courier to the orchid loft, where ventilation hummed like distant gulls and no overseers prowled.<words>222</words>
There, amid real bird calls piped in to soothe alien visitors, they sat in silence, allowing memories to surface without spoken prompts.<words>244</words>
Orrin smelled wet soil and cedar benches from the retreat; the courier tasted salt tears she had never cried, and their breathing synchronized like planets aligning.<words>270</words>
Through that mutual hush, the orchids responded, petals opening and closing in regularly random pulses that the Center’s sensors misread as humidity variance.<words>293</words>
Orrin and the courier, however, understood the blooming as syntax: blush for grief, pale for hope, violet for courage none dared name.<words>315</words>
Each color echoed a recovered memory, and with every echo the constellation on the purses grew brighter, projecting silent sentences onto the glass walls.<words>339</words>
When the Center's chief linguist burst in, alarms strobing, he saw only two ordinary humans listening to flowers, but the walls already displayed a lexicon of feelings the machines could not reach.<words>371</words>
Understanding dawned on him like a belated sunrise: amid bird calls and improbable longing, quiet collaboration had translated the inexpressible, and emotion itself finally flickered into universal speech forever.<words>400</words>
