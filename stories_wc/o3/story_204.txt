Silas Vireo practiced the profession of professional cuddler with monasterial discipline. <words>11</words>
Clients described the experience as unusually usual, comfort wrapped so tightly it surprised them. <words>25</words>
Yet Silas himself felt untouched, sealed behind quiet unspoken rules inherited from a nameless guild. <words>40</words>
Those rules whispered that outer contact healed others but could never cleanse his own decay. <words>55</words>
He believed them until a chance encounter at a farmer's market fractured the doctrine. <words>69</words>
Among stalls perfumed by basil and neutron lotus, he bumped elbows with Yara Keshet. <words>83</words>
She clutched a translucent relic, a phantom train ticket punch rumored to mark destinies instead of paper. <words>100</words>
Its handle glimmered like technology so old it felt unborn, pure ancient novelty. <words>113</words>
Yara apologized for the collision, offering him a stamp from the punch as apology. <words>127</words>
The stamp left no ink, only a tingling lattice across his palm that spelled possibility. <words>142</words>
Before he could speak, event security hushed the crowd; an acceptance speech was moments away. <words>157</words>
Yara, nominated for restoring the abandoned spaceport hangar into a refugee observatory, was about to ascend the dais. <words>175</words>
Silas followed the hush toward the stage, inexplicably magnetized by the silent promise in his skin. <words>191</words>
He had never entered awards galas; the unspoken rules forbade celebration of intimate labor. <words>205</words>
But seeing Yara cradle the spectral punch, he sensed a kinship older than shame. <words>219</words>
The auditorium lights dimmed, and in that velvet pause he remembered his grandmother's prejudice against travelers from Station Kalpa. <words>238</words>
Grandmother claimed their bones rang hollow, unfit for honest closeness. <words>248</words>
Yara belonged to that wandering diaspora, yet her accidental touch had felt vividly solid. <words>262</words>
Determined to overcome the inherited bias, Silas approached the dais just before the microphone warmed. <words>277</words>
He offered his still tingling palm and whispered, invisible ink needs reading. <words>289</words>
Yara pressed the punch again, aligning its ghostly jaws with the first lattice. <words>302</words>
This time the pattern flared, projecting coordinates of the forgotten hangar onto the curtain. <words>316</words>
Gasps replaced silence; the officials froze, and the hush thickened into expectation. <words>328</words>
Silas addressed them, voice steady as a cradle swing. <words>337</words>
He explained that the coordinates revealed lingering structural decay threatening every refugee telescope inside. <words>351</words>
Repair crews, he said, must work tonight, guided by Yara's artifact and his own mapping touch. <words>367</words>
The assembly listened, hearts rocking in the cradle of his vocation. <words>378</words>
Applause broke the spell, but prejudice inside Silas shattered sooner, like amber freeing an ancestor. <words>393</words>
Yara invited him to the podium, and together they began the acceptance speech newly rewritten. <words>408</words>
They spoke of unspoken rules, of contact that heals both sides, and of ticket punches that measure courage, not passage. <words>428</words>
In the amber glow of the ancient novelty overhead, even the prejudice of the crowd decayed to dust. <words>446</words>
Silas finally felt touched. <words>450</words>
