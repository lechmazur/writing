Between innings, I paced the catwalk of the mountain shooting star tracking station, breathing starlight like cautious medicine.<words>18</words>
The station's only other occupant, an unruly alchemist named Lyric Murrow, skipped beside me humming interruptions.<words>34</words>
Her voice was hauntingly cheerful, yet every note trembled under infinite caution as though afraid of echoes.<words>51</words>
Lyric claimed she could impress the cosmos itself via the hum of an outdated overhead projector.<words>67</words>
I doubted her, steeped in the station's routine cynicism that measured beauty only by parallax calculations.<words>83</words>
She twirled a magnifying glass with a cracked lens, letting fractured moonbeams dance like broken promises across dashboards.<words>101</words>
That glass, she whispered, had once looked up so hard it grazed the touched sky and came back needing stitches.<words>121</words>
Her myth irritated me, yet the phrase 'touched sky' fluttered strangely inside my ribs, loosening dusty skepticism.<words>138</words>
Outside the press box window, meteors waited their cue, frozen punctuation marks between the innings of our watching.<words>156</words>
Lyric powered the ancient projector, its whirring belt stuttering like a moth that refused to admit death.<words>173</words>
She slid star charts beneath the lens and angled the cracked glass toward the ceiling's ventilation haze.<words>190</words>
The projected constellations wavered, each wobble accompanied by harmonic overtones the machine should not possess.<words>205</words>
That hum threaded through my chest cavity, re-tuning it from practical disbelief to uneasy anticipation.<words>220</words>
Lyric raised her arms like a ringmaster and commanded the magnified wounds in the lens to scatter light.<words>238</words>
Splinters of illumination ricocheted across the dome, tracing new mythologies on equipment lockers and half-drunk thermoses.<words>254</words>
Somehow the meteors outside answered, bursting into streaks that dove precisely where her wandering beams pointed.<words>270</words>
The scoreboard on the distant baseball field clicked, announcing players' return, yet the sky refused to resume ordinary motion.<words>289</words>
Above first base, a column of silver dust descended, coiling into letters only imagination could pronounce.<words>305</words>
I felt the roster of my doubts melt, replaced by playful wonder so bright it disarmed my cynicism.<words>323</words>
Lyric noticed and nodded, her grin both triumphant and apologetic, as if sorry for winning too easily.<words>340</words>
Infinite caution returned when the projector coughed, its bulb dimming, the hum slipping into arthritic silence.<words>356</words>
The meteors froze again, the dust letters unraveled, and stadium chatter drifted uphill like distant brass.<words>372</words>
She pocketed the cracked magnifying glass, its tired surface still warm, and sighed as if closing rehearsal curtains.<words>390</words>
You have seen the touched sky, she murmured, keep it with you when statistics try numbing the stars.<words>408</words>
As players trotted back onto the field, I rewound her words like fragile film, vowing to project wonder forward.<words>427</words>
