Pristine snow hissed upon steaming vents, nourishing a skeletal orchard that clung to the frigid tundra like a memory of warmth.<words>21</words>
Into this contradictory garden trudged Kairo, a naturally awkward and hesitant swordsman whose blade trembled louder than the wind.<words>40</words>
He carried no banner, only a blank postcard addressed to no one, its edges already curling with frost.<words>58</words>
The postcard was rumored to bridge worlds, provided the sender confessed a motive pure enough to survive the cold ink.<words>78</words>
Kairo’s motive— to restore traditional systems of clan justice abandoned after the meteor harvest— felt anything but pure inside his uneasy chest.<words>100</words>
Yet the postcard pulsed, as though acknowledging truth soaked in doubts, and so he stumbled deeper among the bent apple skeletons.<words>121</words>
Around each geothermal vent, hermit crabs migrated in slow circles, trading porous shells like merchants swapping keys at a border gate.<words>142</words>
From their ritual he sought guidance, believing the worlds would likewise emerge, chamber after chamber, by the life of hermit crabs moving shells.<words>165</words>
But steam etched mocking specters across his visor, and ephemeral rancor drifted through the branches like half‑remembered accusations.<words>183</words>
He recalled the inquiry chamber where the final piece of evidence was filed away, branding him incompetent for refusing to swing first.<words>205</words>
That humiliation had driven him north, chasing rumors of imaginary correspondence instead of dueling the committee that shamed him.<words>224</words>
Now, under fruitless boughs, he unsheathed the blade only to tap the icy trunks, practicing sentences he would never utter in court.<words>246</words>
A crab abandoned its shell beside his boot, staring with bead‑bright eyes that reflected the postcard’s blank horizon.<words>264</words>
Kairo knelt, feeling absurd kinship with the creature, both of them between homes, between proofs, between names.<words>281</words>
Guided by impulse, he placed the postcard over the vent, letting steam bead upon its surface like unwritten punctuation.<words>300</words>
Words formed in condensation: 'Tradition is a shell; pass it on.'<words>311</words>
Startled, he answered aloud that he lacked the courage to carry such weight, and the steam recoiled in quiet judgement.<words>331</words>
The hermit crab clicked, abandoning hesitation, and crawled onto his glove, its soft body trusting the trembling swordsman more than he trusted himself.<words>354</words>
Something inside Kairo emerged, not confidence but acceptance that tradition could move, could inhabit new armor without losing ancient shape.<words>374</words>
He warmed the postcard over the vent until ink bled from unseen pores, etching the crab’s silhouette beside a bridge of interlocked blades.<words>397</words>
Sensing completeness, the orchard shimmered, branches twisting into archways, and two auroras parted to reveal another valley where old councils still gathered.<words>419</words>
Kairo stepped forward, crab in pocket, blade steady, carrying a postcard no longer blank but breathing, intent on delivering his shell of tradition anew.<words>443</words>
