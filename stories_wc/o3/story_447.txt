Cricket Halsey, the only gossip columnist in the forgotten river town of Levee Bend, stirred tomato broth.<words>17</words>
Her cramped kitchen doubled as an amber prison where memories clung to walls like fossilized gnats.<words>33</words>
She cooked slow so she could report fast.<words>41</words>
While onions hissed, she practiced her clandestine craft of unraveling ephemeral news bulletins from the future.<words>57</words>
The bulletins arrived as curling wisps above the pot, letters forming in fragrant steam.<words>71</words>
Cricket inhaled them with abandoned caution, letting tomorrow's secrets season tonight's supper.<words>83</words>
Tonight they warned that the town's annual Founders Parade would deteriorate into shouting, egging, and broken banjos.<words>100</words>
The parade mattered, because Levee Bend had already cracked like overbaked cornbread after last month's flood.<words>116</words>
Families glared across sandbagged streets, trading blame, selling rumors in lieu of pumpkins.<words>129</words>
Cricket's weekly column, 'Porchlight Whispers,' was meant to mend that fracture, not widen it.<words>143</words>
Yet printing the future felt like gentle rebellion, and she was nothing if not dutifully defiant.<words>159</words>
She wiped sweat with a lonely stuffed toy ear she kept as potholder, the last remnant of childhood comfort.<words>178</words>
Its frayed plush reminded her what needed stitching.<words>186</words>
So while the stew simmered, she drafted a column predicting the parade's collapse—then prescribed an antidote.<words>202</words>
She urged every resident to bring a single household heirloom, line them along Main, and share the story aloud before any float rolled.<words>225</words>
If people spoke while marching, anger would have no room to shout.<words>237</words>
The pot burbled applause.<words>241</words>
Steam letters confirmed the future had rewritten itself—at least provisionally.<words>251</words>
Still, Cricket needed the mayor’s printing press, locked inside the courthouse’s amber-paneled archives.<words>264</words>
She marched there, ladle in hand, smelling of thyme and risk.<words>275</words>
Guards hesitated; her apron bore tomatoes, not guns, and her eyes simmered hotter than her soup.<words>291</words>
She offered them first taste: a diplomatic spoonful thick with hope.<words>302</words>
Permission ladled open, the presses clattered like cicadas at dusk, spitting pages of dutiful defiance across marble floors.<words>320</words>
By sunrise, heirlooms lined Main—pipe wrenches, quilts, tarnished tiaras, even a shattered jar of the river’s mud.<words>337</words>
When the parade began, neighbors narrated their objects, voices stitched in public like patchwork, and resentment melted into festival brass.<words>357</words>
Cricket watched from the courthouse steps, the stuffed ear tucked in her pocket and the amber prison's doors propped open.<words>377</words>
Rumor, once shackles, became ribbon.<words>382</words>
She filed her final bulletin to the stew, tasted it, and decided the community no longer needed forewarning—just supper.<words>401</words>
