Dim midmorning light drained through the subway car as we rattled between unknown stops. <words>14</words>
Opposite me slouched Morwen Crest, a famously insomniac poet clutching a backpack stitched with feathers. <words>29</words>
Her eyes, ringed like planetary orbits, flicked open and shut in restless micro-sleeps. <words>42</words>
I noticed green vials peeking from the pack—botanical samples still dewing on their stems. <words>56</words>
Curiosity weighed nothing yet filled the car with that peculiar empty abundance of possibility. <words>70</words>
She gestured me closer and breathed warnings in whispers only the fluorescent hum dared accompany. <words>85</words>
“They want me silenced before the next station,” she murmured, “but silence compounds violence.” <words>99</words>
The train lurched, granting us an extra minute between stops, a fragile sanctuary. <words>112</words>
Morwen’s backpack fell open, revealing her notebook, meticulously messy with scratched sonnets and chemical equations. <words>127</words>
Lines of verse braided around formulas measuring leaf conductivity and human forgiveness. <words>139</words>
She believed plants recorded cruelty and could exhale its antidote if asked in perfect rhyme. <words>154</words>
Someone, she confessed, sought to eliminate the research before her peaceful proof reached daylight. <words>168</words>
I glanced around, but the other passengers floated in headphone cocoons, oblivious, abundant yet empty. <words>183</words>
Morwen pressed a vial into my palm, its leaf trembling like a violin string mid-rest. <words>198</words>
“Take it to the attic above Gwynn’s Tavern,” she whispered, “the ghosts preserve truth.” <words>212</words>
Before I answered, the train screeched into the station, doors yawned, and suited agents approached. <words>227</words>
Morwen slipped away in the rush, leaving only ozone and half-spoken stanzas behind. <words>240</words>
That night, I found the tavern’s staircase corkscrewing to a haunted attic no patrons mentioned. <words>255</words>
Ale fumed below, but upstairs silence swelled like drunken laughter remembered the next morning. <words>269</words>
Dust motes orbited antique trunks, and invisible feet shuffled, meticulously messy in their ectoplasmic ballet. <words>284</words>
I placed the vial on a cracked windowsill and felt the room breathe, curious and cold. <words>300</words>
Wind threaded through rotted boards, shaping itself into fresh whispers far older than language. <words>314</words>
They warned me to guard the leaf until Morwen returned with incontrovertible, gentle thunder. <words>328</words>
Days blurred into nights, yet every dawn the sample unfurled wider, drinking dust like sunshine. <words>343</words>
Meanwhile, rumors trickled from literary after-parties where Morwen, half-drunk, confessed her findings to rival editors. <words>358</words>
Each confession spread like spilled wine, forcing the shadowy funders to abandon violent solutions. <words>372</words>
Unable to eliminate ideas now public, they dissolved into the very anonymity they once weaponized. <words>387</words>
When Morwen finally climbed the attic ladder, morning sun ricocheted off empty bottles she carried. <words>402</words>
She set them down, abundant yet hollow, and laughed at the paradox nurturing our experiment. <words>417</words>
Together, we crushed no one; instead, we brewed tea from the leaf and listened. <words>431</words>
The ghosts sipped first, applauding without hands, proving non-violence could taste of mint and thunderclap. <words>446</words>
Between subway stops, a seed of peace had traveled, found soil in a haunted attic, and flowered. <words>463</words>
