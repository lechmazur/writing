Between rides on the interstellar commuter line, General Kesh leaned against the greasy window of the Dark Matter Diner, feeling the universe flicker like an old bulb.<words>27</words>
His medals hung dull, and exhaustion smoldered in his posture like dried seaweed left too long in sun and salt.<words>47</words>
He had commanded victories, yet fear still sat on the throne of reason inside his skull, an uncrowned tyrant he now vowed to dethrone.<words>71</words>
Across the cracked countertop lounged Vira, a rogue archivist whose mischievous wisdom matched the diner's neon shadows.<words>88</words>
She slid him a folder of black-and-white photographs, each bordered by shimmering ink that arced like lightning between frames.<words>107</words>
These were diagrams, she whispered, rationally absurd yet empirically tight, mapping how shared anxieties could be rerouted, renewed, and reborn.<words>127</words>
If the general could trace the arcs across the sequence, he might renew himself and others, excising panic the way surgeons cut tumors.<words>150</words>
But the method demanded a catalyst--the taste of umami despair, specifically a strand of century-old dried seaweed steeped in quantum broth.<words>171</words>
Kesh laughed, the sound rasping like artillery, because that very garnish floated in his untouched miso nebula special.<words>189</words>
He chewed the relic weed, feeling iodine memories flood back--boot camps, funeral salutes, children hiding under burning sky--then swallowed them into silence.<words>211</words>
The photographs pulsed, arcs leaping from image to image until they formed a kinetic storyboard of every soldier he had ever commanded.<words>233</words>
In each snapshot the soldiers confessed a terror, mouths frozen mid-scream, yet lines of coded light linked their confessions like circuitry.<words>254</words>
Vira urged him to touch the line that scared him most, explaining that the diner, built atop a dark matter eddy, would channel the charge.<words>279</words>
His finger settled on a young recruit's silent plea--'I feared disappointing you'--and lightning arched into his sternum, gentle yet unyielding.<words>299</words>
Instead of pain he felt a mischievous warmth bloom, as though the universe itself winked and said, 'Now you see how silly tyrants are'.<words>323</words>
His anxieties diffused outward, looping through the diner's patrons--mechanical pilgrims, gravity cab drivers, ghost tourists--who exhaled and found their shoulders suddenly lighter.<words>345</words>
Fear, dethroned, shrank to a courteous adviser, and reason reclaimed its seat beside compassion, drafting new orders for the weary general's heart.<words>367</words>
When the station loudspeaker announced the next gravity ride, Kesh tipped Vira with a crisp salute and a smile luminous enough to light her photographs forever.<words>393</words>
Stepping through the sliding doors, he felt renewed, armed not with cannons but with the rationally absurd knowledge that shared anxieties dissolve quickest when laughed at together.<words>420</words>
And somewhere behind him, in the hush between rides, the Dark Matter Diner hummed like a satisfied paradox, brewing more courage from leftover fears.<words>444</words>
