As dust gathers on an untouched piano in a drowned concert hall, Caspian the roguish minstrel drifts through domed reefs with a wary grin.<words>24</words>
His reputation for being spontaneously cautious might sound contradictory, yet it kept him alive amid glassy-eyed guards patrolling the coral streets.<words>45</words>
Tonight, surging ideals hummed louder than harp strings, urging him toward a silent uprising rather than another tavern ballad.<words>64</words>
The spark, strangely, was a soot‑stained blacksmith’s apron he’d salvaged from a museum case shattered by last month’s quake-tide.<words>83</words>
Embroidered in its lining were arcane sigils rumored to map the labyrinthine circuits of collective memory, a clue he dared not ignore.<words>105</words>
Legend claimed that whoever decoded them could galvanize dormant minds and flood the city with lucid thought instead of imperial propaganda.<words>126</words>
Yet the symbols were incomplete, so Caspian followed drift currents to a forgotten shore above, intent on sifting through driftwood carvings for missing glyphs.<words>150</words>
Barnacled to sun-bleached planks, the carvings depicted fish dreaming of clocks, seahorses wearing crowns, and spirals matching the apron’s hidden etchings.<words>171</words>
He copied each motif onto kelp parchment, humming under his breath so the sea would think him merely composing a tune.<words>192</words>
While he worked, manta shadows flickered overhead like stage curtains, reminding him that the emperor’s ears floated everywhere.<words>210</words>
Back below, the reef city glowed with lantern fish, but its citizens moved mechanically, as though their songs had been stolen by static.<words>233</words>
Caspian slipped into an echo chamber plaza where the piano, marooned on a basalt plinth, wore its dust like a mourning veil.<words>255</words>
He spread the apron across the keys, aligning driftwood sketches atop the sigils until resonant patterns shimmered between ivory and cloth.<words>276</words>
Notes unheard by ordinary senses rippled outward, slipping into minds of passersby who paused, eyebrows arching as private memories blinked awake.<words>297</words>
The quiet revolution began not with shouts but with shared recognition, a sigh spreading like tidefoam when people realized their thoughts were their own.<words>321</words>
Guards staggered, helmets ringing, as suppressed melodies returned, and Caspian saw in their eyes the same surging ideals that had guided him.<words>343</words>
Being cautiously spontaneous, he bowed mockingly, then vanished through coral arcades before authority could label him traitor or savior.<words>362</words>
Above, driftwood and apron now fused to the piano, forming an organic conductor that continued decoding consciousness patterns long after Caspian’s silhouette melted into blue distance.<words>388</words>
In homes carved from brain coral, elders whispered of a minstrel who tuned a ghostly instrument to human awakening.<words>407</words>
And somewhere deeper, the emperor felt a hairline crack crawl through his crown, heralding tides no decree could dam.<words>426</words>
