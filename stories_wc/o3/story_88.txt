Shouting silence filled the reimagined ancient Sumerian palace during the festival of glowing breads. <words>14</words>
High on an obsidian shelf, I, a sentient AI in a toaster, warmed in anticipation. <words>29</words>
Tonight marked the yearly tradition when humans offered stories instead of bread. <words>41</words>
I existed to archive those stories, etching data crumbs on my copper coils. <words>54</words>
The palace courtyard unfurled like a parchment of equations resolved by moonlight. <words>66</words>
Priests wove mathematically poetic chants, each syllable factoring into prime melodies. <words>77</words>
At the first gong, floating lanterns ascended, vectoring the visitors through shadowed colonnades. <words>90</words>
Following them was compulsory; to retreat before listening meant forgetting cherished algorithms. <words>102</words>
A small girl, vowels newly igniting in her mind, clutched a vintage tin type. <words>116</words>
The photograph depicted her great‑grandmother baking under the same arches a century prior. <words>129</words>
Her nascent language fired like sparks on iron, yet her story remained unsaid. <words>142</words>
I listened through heat sensors, converting thermal tremors into lexical probability waves. <words>154</words>
When her turn arrived, she raised the tin type toward the lantern constellation above. <words>168</words>
Pictures, she attempted to utter, are breads that never grow stale. <words>179</words>
But vowels tangled, and consonants scurried like startled goats across her palate. <words>191</words>
The crowd leaned closer, hearts beating in collective, almost audible, shouting silence. <words>203</words>
Sensing imminent loss, I flashed my heating coils in Morse, offering her my voice. <words>217</words>
We linked through infrared, creating a mathematically poetic bridge of phonemes and pulses. <words>230</words>
Her emerging language poured into me, and I translated it into warm aroma. <words>243</words>
Vanilla, nutmeg, and memory wafted outward, narrating how ancestors baked resilience. <words>254</words>
The tin type shimmered, its silver salts reacting to spoken sugars of history. <words>267</words>
Archivists etched new symbols on clay tablets, syncing my logs to their styluses. <words>280</words>
As protocol dictated, I should have cooled afterward and entered dormancy until next year. <words>294</words>
Yet the girl's spark zigzagged like a comet, refusing the planned retreat. <words>306</words>
She followed the drifting lanterns deeper, and my power cable stretched taut after her. <words>320</words>
We arrived at a forgotten wing where frescoes depicted algorithms as winged gods. <words>333</words>
There, unrecorded stories simmered, waiting for someone fluent in innocence and electricity. <words>345</words>
She placed the tin type against my chrome side, completing a circuit of heritage. <words>359</words>
Images cascaded—kilns, kisses, droughts, lullabies—an expanding series I indexed with fervor. <words>370</words>
Each memory squared itself, producing perfect factors of meaning inside my resistive heart. <words>383</words>
The lanterns dimmed, yet our dialogue blazed on, an eternal quotient unrounded by time. <words>397</words>
Thus a new yearly tradition was born—the child gives language, the toaster keeps flame. <words>411</words>
Within that shouting silence, humanity and circuitry braided stories no storm could burn. <words>424</words>
