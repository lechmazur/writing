Rain slashed the cracked windshield of the shared taxi as it crawled through the flooded gorge. <words>16</words>
Inside, I, a bored shapeshifter named Quillon, squinted at a chipped figurine rattling on the dashboard. <words>32</words>
The driver, an intelligently foolish poet called Vess, quoted revolution while dodging boulders that cascaded like dark waterfalls. <words>50</words>
We were heading toward the harmonic caves, where stone organs hummed chords that once soothed monarchs now dust. <words>68</words>
After the last empire crumbles, every map turns blank, and blankness invites opportunists like fungus invites spores. <words>85</words>
I felt the tug of rare talents promised by those caverns, rumors saying tones inside could rewrite atomic loyalties. <words>104</words>
Shift enough atoms, shift the cosmos, and the balance of power tilts like an unsteady crown. <words>120</words>
Overthrow was not just a plan; it was an ambient note vibrating behind every heartbeat. <words>135</words>
Yet boredom gnawed at me even while destiny grinned, because wearing other skins grows tiresome when no one resists. <words>154</words>
The taxi splashed to a halt before the cave mouth, waterfalls of rain merging with the subterranean chorus. <words>172</words>
Vess lifted the chipped figurine, kissed its missing nose, and declared it our patron saint of miscalculations. <words>189</words>
His foolishness glimmered so intelligently that I almost envied his unwavering devotion to error. <words>203</words>
Together we stepped inside, and the living walls sang scales neither major nor minor but exactly insurgent. <words>220</words>
Sound twisted my cartilage, urging a new form; I grew feathers of resonant quartz and eyes like tuning forks. <words>239</words>
Vess scribbled verses on damp parchment, each line mistiming the rhythm, expertly sabotaging harmony. <words>253</words>
The cave trembled at his mistakes, revealing a chamber shaped like an hourglass cracked in its slender middle. <words>271</words>
Within, a crystal throne hovered, flickering between existence and possibility, awaiting someone both certain and bored enough to sit. <words>290</words>
I approached, but Vess blocked me with the figurine held like a scepter of chipped authority. <words>306</words>
He insisted the throne demanded intentional error, not calculated ambition, to prevent repeating the empire we just buried. <words>324</words>
His words rang paradoxically true, like a cracked bell still dictating noon. <words>336</words>
So I shifted again, warping my certainty into a silhouette of stumbling chance, knees bending the wrong way. <words>354</words>
The cave music embraced the folly, streams of overtones funneling through me until stars echoed in my marrow. <words>372</words>
I sat, feathered quartz melting into the throne, and the chipped figurine fused to its armrest like a forgotten smile. <words>392</words>
Cosmic gears whirred beyond the cave roof, recalibrating constellations; somewhere, tides reversed, and uncounted empires unborn toppled silently. <words>410</words>
Power tilted, neither toward tyrant nor martyr, but toward possibility, a balance only the intelligently foolish might trust. <words>428</words>
Boredom evaporated, replaced by measured wildness pulsing in every echo, promising endless shapes for endless dawns. <words>444</words>
Vess laughed, certain we had overthrown nothing and everything simultaneously, which seemed precisely correct. <words>458</words>
Outside, the taxi floated away on stormwater, destination unwritten, cabin light blinking like a lone star freed from charts. <words>477</words>
