Mist drifted along the aerial canals of Nimbus Haven as the workday exhaled its last sigh. <words>16</words>
Inside the levitating Athenaeum, the librarian clicked off lights only after the last library card got returned to the desk. <words>36</words>
That was my cue, for I am Loke Parrish, professional scapegoat for hire. <words>49</words>
People pay me to absorb blame the way clouds swallow thunder. <words>60</words>
Tonight, however, blame was merely the wrapper around a deeper commission. <words>71</words>
My employer, unseen, whispered tasks through cryptic phone calls at midnight across three previous nights. <words>86</words>
Each murmured instruction had the robustly delicate cadence of porcelain striking steel. <words>98</words>
I was to retrieve a metal washer from the Skyforge Ruins, refashion its emptiness, and decode sacred symbols etched into its rim. <words>120</words>
Nothing else, the voice had insisted, or the clouds would curdle. <words>131</words>
So I walked the misted bridges with obsessive calm, rehearsing fresh alibis inside my skull. <words>146</words>
Scapegoats survive by staying empty, but this washer felt like a mirror. <words>158</words>
Its hole matched the hollow where my abandoned identity used to reside. <words>170</words>
Years ago, I had discarded my birth name to outrun a prosecution that was never mine. <words>186</words>
The washer, cold and bright, reminded me that stories refashion themselves when gaps appear. <words>200</words>
Atop a cirrus balcony, I examined its rim under a flickering lantern fueled by bottled lightning. <words>216</words>
Tiny glyphs spiraled inward like migrating ants, each loop suggesting both exit and enclosure. <words>230</words>
To decode them I needed blame, not because they were guilty, but because guilt is solvent. <words>246</words>
I pressed the washer against my wrist, absorbing every rumor ever hurled at me. <words>260</words>
The metal warmed, and symbols unfurled into constellations spelling a single phrase: 'Return what you never were'. <words>277</words>
Thunder muttered beneath the streets of vapor as understanding anchored me. <words>288</words>
The message demanded I surrender my profession, the final costume covering my absence. <words>301</words>
If I complied, the clouds might stop curdling in secret, and Nimbus Haven could breathe. <words>316</words>
But who would I be without paid condemnation? <words>324</words>
I dialed the midnight number, my voice as steady as frozen dew. <words>336</words>
'Your washer has spoken,' I said, 'and it wants a new scapegoat'. <words>348</words>
Silence crackled, robustly delicate, like glass bells. <words>355</words>
Then the voice replied, calm and obsessive: 'Offer the washer to the librarian, and leave'. <words>370</words>
I obeyed, pacing back to the darkened Athenaeum where return carts glowed with phosphor dust. <words>385</words>
The librarian, eyes cloudier than the sky, accepted the ring and whispered, 'Welcome home'. <words>399</words>
In that moment my scapegoat contract dissolved like vapor into sun, and the city brightened. <words>414</words>
No one saw me step from the balcony edge, refashioned into anonymity lighter than mist. <words>429</words>
