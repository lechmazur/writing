Borrowed dawn filtered through cracked portholes of the atom-powered lighthouse, painting bruised gold across forgotten control panels.<words>17</words>
There, in the hush of a line that never moves, Aristea waited for the stars to speak.<words>34</words>
She was a time refugee from a forgotten empire, carrying centuries of silent exile in her spine.<words>51</words>
Despite the whirl of radioactive tides below, her posture remained quietly defiant, a compass forged from regret.<words>68</words>
The lighthouseâ€™s keeper, a trustworthy strange automaton named Orric, ticked beside her like a patient metronome.<words>84</words>
His brass fingers smoothed an embroidered tablecloth over a cracked console, as if preparing tea for ghosts.<words>101</words>
Each threaded symbol was a star map, and each stain marked the catastrophes Aristea vowed to mend.<words>118</words>
"When the alignment of the stars matches this weave," Orric intoned, "we can catapult your promise across time's wound."<words>137</words>
Aristea traced a comet-stitch with trembling thumb, remembering artillery blossoming over palace balconies.<words>150</words>
She had escaped through a ruptured chronicle just before history slammed shut, but her people remained bleeding behind glass.<words>169</words>
To bind old wounds with unstoppable will, she must stitch moment to moment, empire to aftermath.<words>185</words>
Outside, atom engines thrummed, turning the lantern lens that once guided merchant moons, now aimed inward toward eras.<words>203</words>
Orric adjusted prisms so that chronology bent like light, layering centuries atop the ocean's restless skin.<words>219</words>
Into that shimmering palimpsest, they would launch her message wrapped in fabric and fire.<words>233</words>
Yet the lighthouse council, broadcasting from distant satellites, demanded proof that compassion outweighed paradox.<words>247</words>
Aristea offered herself, agreeing never to return, a living guarantee braided from loneliness and duty.<words>262</words>
The council's silence confirmed acceptance, and the air thickened with ozone and possibility.<words>275</words>
Following the embroidered longitude, Aristea and Orric calculated launch vectors by the alignment of the stars once more.<words>293</words>
A nested catapult of magnetic rails unfolded from the lighthouse balcony, humming like a giant cello string.<words>310</words>
Orric slipped the tablecloth into a crystalline capsule, sealing it with a drop of Aristea's blood.<words>326</words>
Her pulse, trustworthy strange against metal, synchronized with reactor rhythm, authorizing impossible trajectories.<words>339</words>
At countdown, she saw her empire's banners reflected in Orric's glass eyes, neither past nor future, only promise.<words>357</words>
The capsule leapt, carving dawn out of night as it arced beyond sight, toward hurts still grieving in legend.<words>376</words>
In the wake of that burning stitch, the lighthouse dimmed, but Aristea felt the line of history stir.<words>394</words>
Borrowed dawn became her own at last, because she had dared to send love farther than exile could reach.<words>413</words>
