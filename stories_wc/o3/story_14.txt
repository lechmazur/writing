Rain hissed against the tidal power monitoring station as Rafe, a naive gambler, arrived with pockets echoing emptiness. <words>18</words>
He had followed cryptic coordinates whispered during candlelit dinners by a tablemate whose smile flickered like a rustic candle mold cooling. <words>39</words>
The stranger had promised Rafe a game where losing meant nothing, winning meant everything, and rules were rarely predictable. <words>58</words>
Inside, turbines groaned like caged whales, their rhythm syncing with Rafe’s jittery heartbeat as sodium lamps sputtered rebellion. <words>76</words>
An unhinged professor, coat patched by sea salt and chalk dust, called the assembly to order via rebellious midnight lectures broadcast over crackling speakers. <words>100</words>
Rafe, imagining poker chips instead of rivets, applauded with laughing tears he didn't understand. <words>114</words>
The professor unveiled a brass key and spoke of unspoken bargains forged between moon, tide, and desperate souls seeking one last spark before oblivion. <words>138</words>
To play, contestants must dock a skiff beneath the station, unlock the caisson, and retrieve a vial of midnight water. <words>158</words>
Rafe, confident in luck untested by oceans, grabbed the key while others hesitated, their calculations drowned by turbine roar. <words>177</words>
He descended metal stairs slick with algae, each step a discarded coin tossed into a blind well. <words>194</words>
Below, candles—not LEDs—lined the pier, their molds still rustic, dribbling wax like antique hourglasses mocking modern power. <words>211</words>
He felt the absurd romance of technology flirting with apocalypse and laughed harder, tears crusting salt on his cheeks. <words>230</words>
When the skiff bobbed into view, the sea smelled of ozone and forgotten wagers. <words>244</words>
He docked, unlocked the caisson, and scooped water that shimmered like liquid coin flips deciding galaxies. <words>260</words>
But as the vial sealed, turbines stalled, candles guttered, and the professor’s voice crackled: 'House takes the light you borrowed.' <words>280</words>
An unseen mechanism swallowed the pier; waves rose like curtains, performing the finale nobody rehearsed. <words>295</words>
Rafe’s skiff spun outward, propelled by current and panic, yet he laughed through tears, clutching the glowing vial to his chest. <words>316</words>
He understood then that the wager had never been money but memory, that unspoken bargains demand witnesses, and water remembers everything. <words>337</words>
The station behind him darkened, surrendering its data to night, while the vial pulsed, capturing one last spark before oblivion. <words>357</words>
As dawn threatened to tidy the waves, he vowed to spend that spark recklessly, wagering laughter against the coming void. <words>377</words>
First, he would return to the gamblers’ den, pour the luminous water into the rustic candle mold, and strike a match of defiance. <words>400</words>
The wick would flare with laughing tears, a reminder that even naive wagers can set whole tides ablaze. <words>418</words>
And somewhere beneath the quiet turbines, the unhinged professor would resume his midnight lecture, pleased the lesson had finally departed the classroom. <words>440</words>
