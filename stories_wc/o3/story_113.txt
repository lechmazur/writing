The xenon-lit tunnel hummed like a captive nebula, its walls throbbing at the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget.<words>21</words>
Mallory, a bard whose songs entered rooms only after she had fled them, stepped inside with shyly loud footsteps that betrayed her hesitation.<words>44</words>
Clutched to her chest was a worn-out dinosaur plush, so patched and frayed it looked prehistoric even to the tunnel’s future-drunk circuitry.<words>66</words>
The toy was her compass, its button eye spinning whenever the fragility of time quivered near enough to be plucked like harp string.<words>89</words>
She sought to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, rumors of which had nested in the nightmares of the city above.<words>110</words>
To reach it she must motivate sleeping minds into opening their locked dream-doors, a feat possible only via dream-hopping machines hidden beneath the rails.<words>134</words>
The machines resembled bronze coffins on stilts and, with ironic awe, she realized each was engraved with reversed lullabies she herself had once composed.<words>158</words>
Mallory hesitated, because every melody etched there marked a moment she had tried to forget, yet their mirror-lyrics now beckoned like forgiving ghosts.<words>181</words>
She sang one backward, voice trembling and somehow shyly loud, the contradiction cracking open a corridor inside the tunnel’s glow.<words>201</words>
Through that corridor spilled dreams like spilled ink, and she leapt from strand to strand, barefoot on sentences no waking tongue could articulate.<words>224</words>
In the first dream, a clock tower sobbed rust, pleading for someone to rewind it before its hands shattered; Mallory offered the plush dinosaur.<words>248</words>
Stuffing soaked the gears, cushioning them, and the tower’s tears slowed, stabilizing that fragile second like a violin note held over a cliff.<words>271</words>
Each rescued second rewove a thread in the hidden tapestry, and the tunnel’s xenon lamps flickered brighter as though daylight were rehearsing.<words>293</words>
Yet the more she mended, the faster memories of that forgettable year clawed toward her—wars, quarantines, silences—and she feared being buried under them.<words>316</words>
To keep breathing, she let herself feel ironic awe at her own reluctance, then turned it into rhythm, motivating other dreamers to join the song.<words>341</words>
Unseen allies hummed through their machines, harmonizing with her shyly loud timbre until the tunnel vibrated like a lung built of constellations.<words>363</words>
The tapestry finally floated down, shimmering with salvaged instants, and as Mallory draped it around her shoulders the worn-out dinosaur plush exhaled a prehistoric sigh.<words>388</words>
Time, fragile but mended, folded itself neatly, promising no erasure yet whispering possibility, and the hesitant bard stepped forward, ready to sing inside the coming silence.<words>414</words>
