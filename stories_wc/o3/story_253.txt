I first met Rowan, the polite bandit, during the hush of a classroom once the bell has rung. <words>18</words>
He stood at the back, hat tilted in proud humility, asking permission before stealing attention. <words>33</words>
His voice remained eloquently silent, a paradox that made every ear lean closer. <words>46</words>
Instead of words, Rowan placed a glittering machine learning chip with strange code upon the teacher's desk. <words>63</words>
Green symbols fluttered across its surface like startled fireflies, promising forbidden algorithms. <words>75</words>
He bowed, then invited me to follow him into the hallway that no one else seemed to notice. <words>93</words>
Every step after his cane made him hobble with dignified rhythm, yet his eyes blazed forward. <words>109</words>
The lockers dissolved into circuitry, and we entered an electronic wilderness refuge humming beneath the school's skin. <words>126</words>
Copper vines climbed broken monitors, neon birds sang modem chatter, and distant keyboards mimicked waterfalls. <words>141</words>
Through this surreal forest wound a narrow path mapped in flickering timestamps. <words>153</words>
Rowan explained, still eloquently silent, by tracing shapes in the air that the chip translated into murmurs. <words>170</words>
He sought to become a master of time, rewriting seconds the way poets rearrange breaths. <words>185</words>
But to shape chronologies he needed a witness whose loyalties were unbroken, and my record was pristine. <words>202</words>
He warned that invoking the chip would expose shattered allegiances, revealing who truly served the ticking empire. <words>219</words>
I agreed, driven by curiosity and by the same proud humility shining in his posture. <words>234</words>
He lifted the misaligned harp that hung from a branch of network cable, strings warped by static. <words>251</words>
Rowan strummed, and the path before us unfolded through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp. <words>267</words>
Each resonance bent light, stacking seconds on top of each other like translucent cards. <words>281</words>
We stepped between slivers of paused bell chimes, traversing moments no longer aligned with ordinary duration. <words>297</words>
Suddenly halls flickered with rival figures, former partners Rowan had deserted when their ambitions turned cruel. <words>313</words>
Their shattered allegiances now cut across eras, and they lunged to reclaim the chip. <words>327</words>
Rowan bowed with impeccable courtesy, apologizing for future injuries he was about to cause. <words>341</words>
He pressed the chip to his chest, letting its green fire dance with his heartbeat. <words>356</words>
Time ruptured like glass, and the rivals froze mid-stride, faces trapped in cascading reflections of possible regrets. <words>373</words>
Rowan exhaled, releasing them a fraction at a time so they could hobble harmlessly away. <words>388</words>
His proud humility would not let him erase them entirely, though the chip pulsed with temptation. <words>404</words>
Instead he sealed the device inside the misaligned harp, binding sound to code and era to melody. <words>421</words>
The electronic wilderness refuge dimmed, leaves of silicon folding as though satisfied with our choice. <words>436</words>
Soon we stood again in the empty classroom, second hand barely moving, chalk dust frozen mid-fall. <words>452</words>
Rowan tipped his hat, eloquently silent still, and vanished between ticks, leaving me guardian of his humble pride. <words>470</words>
