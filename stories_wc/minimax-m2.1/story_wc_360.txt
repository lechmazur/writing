<story>Maren adjusted her spectacles and studied the latest proof emerging from her letterpress, the symbols arranging themselves in a language that had never existed before stars began vanishing from the sky. [59] She had worked in this topaz workshop for seventeen years, long enough to understand that the amber light filtering through her windows was not merely color but a condition of perception, a symptom of the world becoming itself in ways that defied simpler explanation. [122] The halo fragment sat on her workbench where it had fallen three nights ago, dropped from the darkness above like a tear from something that could no longer hold its sorrow, and it glowed with the patience of used light. [188]
Between vanishing stars, she had developed her methodology. [211] The mathematics of emotion required not equations but extraction, and Maren had learned to borrow personalities the way other craftsmen borrowed tools, temporarily inhabiting the emotional signatures left on objects brought to her shop. [281] A widow's wedding ring told her what love felt like from the inside when it had become impossible. [334] A child's lost toy revealed the precise architecture of wonder before it hardened into ambition. [389] A soldier's dog tag showed her the exact temperature of fear when it stopped serving survival and became something else entirely, something she had come to call the arithmetic of the soul. [462]
This transposed empathy had not come easily. [482] In her early years, Maren had confused empathy with sympathy, had believed that understanding another person's feelings meant something as simple as compassion. [546] But the mathematics of emotion demanded precision, and she had discovered that genuine understanding required temporary erasure of the self, a complete borrowing of the other's interior architecture until she could feel their mathematics from within. [617] The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity, and she had learned to navigate that disorientation the way sailors navigate fog, by trusting instruments over sight. [685]
The halo fragment pulsed now, its light strengthening as more stars disappeared from the void above her roofless workshop. [749] Maren understood what was happening, though her understanding took the form of a feeling rather than an explanation. [811] The fragment was not falling toward the earth so much as the earth was falling toward it, or perhaps both were falling together toward some third condition that had no name because nothing had ever been named before. [884] She picked up the fragment and held it against her chest, where her heart maintained its steady arithmetic, and she felt her own personality begin to borrow from the fragment's origin, from whatever had once worn this halo of light before it became a thing that could be held. [967]
Outside, the remaining stars flickered with what Maren had come to recognize as impatience. [1020] Between vanishing stars, she knew, lay not emptiness but transition, the universe learning to be something that did not require stars to make light visible. [1085] Her workshop hummed with the quiet industry of her presses, each one producing the fragments she would leave behind, mathematical proofs of emotion encoded in symbols that no one had asked for but everyone would need when the stars finished their disappearance. [1162]
She had stopped counting the personalities she borrowed. [1194] They accumulated in her like receipts for emotions, a vast accounting of the mathematics of feeling that she had come to understand was not hers to keep but hers to transcribe. [1261] The halo fragment warmed in her hands, and Maren felt herself becoming transparent, her boundaries loosening into something that resembled light but felt like liberation. [1329]
When the last star vanished, Maren's workshop continued to glow with topaz clarity, and somewhere in the mathematics of emotion, her work continued as well. [1400] She had discovered what she set out to find: that feelings could be measured, that empathy could be transposed, that consciousness was a language waiting to be printed in its own defense against the silence of stars. [1478] The halo fragment dissolved into the light that had always contained it, and Maren smiled with seventeen borrowed personalities and her own, finally understanding that the mathematics of emotion required not a single answer but an endless transcription of questions, each one a fragment left behind for whatever came next.
