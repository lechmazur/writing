The warden's boots made no sound on the ancient stones as she walked the spiral stairs of the tower, her hands tracing the wall where weather had carved rivers into the mortar over seven hundred years. [52] Below her, the labyrinth spread across the hilltop like a half-remembered prayer, its walls catching the strange silver light that broke through the storm clouds. [103] She had been a labyrinth maintenance worker for nineteen autumns now, long enough to understand that the paths shifted when no one was watching, rearranging themselves according to dreams that had been dreamed within their boundaries. [159]
The broken sextant sat in her belt pouch, a brass instrument with a cracked lens and a bent arm, left behind by an astronomer who had wandered in thirty years ago and never emerged. [217] She had found him at dawn, sitting at the labyrinth's center, the sextant clutched to his chest like a compass pointing somewhere beyond the living world. [270] He had smiled at her, placed the instrument in her hands, and simply said, "It measures sorrow now," before walking out through the eastern gate and disappearing into the treeline. [328]
She had learned to use it since then, discovered that under moonlight the broken lens showed her things that daylight obscured. [379] The sextant healed in moonlight, its cracks filling with soft luminescence, allowing her to see the dream-fragments that clung to the walls like cobwebs of memory. [431] Each fragment represented a dream someone had dreamed while lost within the labyrinth's turning passages, and each dream carried a weight, a mass of feeling that could be quantified and measured. [488]
Tonight, with the storm pressing its forehead against the tower's windows, she climbed to the parapet and looked down at her domain. [540] The wind carried the scent of wet earth and something else, something older, the particular smell that trees remember when they have stood at the edge of confusion for centuries. [598] She understood now why the astronomer had come, why he had given her this task. [642] The labyrinth was not merely stone and mortar but a repository of human sorrow, dreams scattered like seeds across its length, each one waiting to be mapped and understood. [700]
At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor far below, she lifts the sextant to her eye and begins to deconstruct the labyrinth's pattern. [756] The method is precise: she maps scattered dreams by following the threads of their making, tracing each vision back to its origin, watching as the walls grow transparent and show her what lies beneath. [812] The stormlit tower by moonlight becomes her observatory, the night her charted sea, and she is neither lost nor seeking but simply witnessing. [866]
She wants to discover what trees witness, standing at the labyrinth's edges, their roots tangled with the bones of those who walked in circles and found no exit. [922] The trees have seen everything—the lovers who entered holding hands and emerged strangers, the children who grew old within the winding passages, the kings who sought wisdom and found only questions. [978] Their sorrow has quantifiable weight, measurable in the sextant's strange arithmetic, each grief a grain of sand in an hourglass that stretches back to the first wall raised against confusion. [1035]
As she works through the night, the labyrinth begins to come apart in her vision, not collapsing but unfolding, its paths laying themselves flat like fabric spread on a table. [1090] The mundane miracles of her trade reveal themselves in the doing: a broken instrument made whole by moonbeams, a confusing place made clear by patient attention, sorrow made bearable by the act of counting it. [1148] When dawn breaks and the storm softens to rain, the warden descends from her tower to begin the physical work of following what her sextant has shown her, knowing that to maintain a labyrinth is sometimes to unmake it, to heal by first understanding the full weight of what has been broken.
