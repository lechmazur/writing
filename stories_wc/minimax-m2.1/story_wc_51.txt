The fractal weaver had been collecting burdens since the snowmelt began, threading their weights into patterns that repeated inward toward infinity. [58]
She worked in the bronze grotto where starlight filtered through fissures in the stone ceiling, casting the space in a metal-rich glow that seemed to breathe with the coming of spring. [89]
Her lamp burned kerosene with a steady hum, the flame orienting properly toward the draft that slipped through the cavern's hidden veins, drawing air upward like an ancient lung exhaling. [132]
The shingled hush of the grotto pressed against her senses—layer upon layer of silence overlapping like the scales of some great sleeping thing, each layer muting the next until the quiet became almost physical, almost pressurable against her skin. [181]
She had come here to collect the weights of different burdens, those that melted down from the mountains with the first thaw, seeping through cracks to pool in the cavern's heart where she sat. [235]
Each burden arrived as a sensation without source—a pressure behind the eyes, a stone in the stomach, a tightness in the chest that had no owner, no name, no story attached. [285]
Her work was to give them shape, to weave them into the fractal patterns that covered every surface of the grotto, patterns that grew smaller and more intricate the deeper one looked, as if the walls themselves contained entire universes of sorrow folded into stone. [345]
She chose a burden from the pool before her, feeling its particular gravity, its specific weight, and began to incorporate it into the pattern at her hands. [392]
The work required perfect orientation of her body, her breath, her thoughts—all aligned toward the center of the grotto where the largest pattern spiraled, the one she had been building since she first stumbled into this place after her own burden became too great to carry alone. [449]
She remembered arriving desperate and overflowing, the weight of her own unnamed sorrow threatening to calcify her from the inside, to turn her heart to stone within her chest. [500]
But the grotto had offered another way: by orienting properly toward the patterns, by adding her burden to the weave rather than carrying it alone, she could release it into the structure and feel herself grow lighter, more permeable, more connected to the ancient rhythm of stones and stars. [556]
Now she moved between the patterns like a librarian between shelves, each section holding different categories of sorrow, different weights of human weight. [603]
The calcification had begun at her fingertips where they touched the stone, creeping upward like frost across a window, turning her flesh slowly to something more permanent, more patient. [652]
She did not resist. [658]
This was the bargain she had made with the grotto, the price of becoming a weaver of burdens rather than a bearer of them—eventually she would become the pattern itself, her consciousness spread thin across the fractal walls, feeling the weights of all who had passed through and left something of themselves behind. [715]
The shingled hush enveloped her completely now, its layers wrapping around her like the embrace of something vast and whale-boned, something that had been holding sorrow since before humans learned to weep, since before the first snowmelt sent waters tumbling down through darkness toward the sea. [771]
She added the final thread to her section and felt another layer of silence settle over her, and in that silence she heard, or thought she heard, the distant song of something enormous moving through deep water, a whalebone reverie rising through stone and soil and root toward the stars that watched over the bronze grotto with their ancient, patient light.
