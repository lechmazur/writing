Mira Vance, curator of the Astral Orchard Archive, stood among the impossible trees that grew in crystalline rows across the asteroid's gray surface, their branches heavy with fruit that hummed at frequencies just below human hearing. [78] She had inherited this position through her grandmother, though the inheritance had arrived not in sequence but in fragments—first the dreams, then the key, and finally, only last week, the official documentation stamped with seals that predated Earth's oldest civilizations. [155] The job itself was simply complicated: she tended a garden that existed partly in physical space and partly in what her grandmother had called "the in-between," where time moved like honey through a sieve and the trees bore fruit that contained memories instead of seeds. [228]
The pistachio shell cameo blank had arrived in the morning's mail, if one could call the delivery system that deposited it through a tear in the fabric of space-time "mail." [290] It was smaller than her thumbnail, its surface that distinctive ridged texture of a pistachio shell, yet carved into the shape of a cameo pendant with a flat center where an image should have been. [358] No return address, no sender's mark—only an inscription on the back in her grandmother's handwriting that read: "Between the first and last page, ask the right question." [418] Mira turned the object over in her fingers, feeling its impossible weight, lighter than air yet dense with significance, and wondered not for the first time what exactly she had agreed to inherit. [489]
She retreated to the bathroom of her small habitation dome, the only room with a door that fully sealed against the orchard radiation that sometimes made the trees sing in frequencies that could drive a person to distraction. [559] The fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting their institutional glow across the utilitarian tiles—her grandmother had always said that profound realizations occurred in bathrooms, where the mask of professional competence could finally slip and the deeper questions rush in like water through a broken dam. [636] Mira sat on the edge of the narrow cot that folded down from the wall, the cameo clutched in her palm, and allowed herself to feel the full weight of her bewilderment, the uncertainty that had been her constant companion since the dreams first began when she was seven years old. [713]
The inheritance had never followed normal rules, she understood now, turning the cameo blank over and over, watching the light catch its edges in ways that suggested hidden depths. [770] Her grandmother had received it from a future version of Mira herself, who had received it from an ancestor who lived three centuries before, who had received it from a child who would not be born for another hundred years—the knowledge flowing backward and forward through the family line in braided streams that defied every linear principle she had been taught to trust. [850] This was the simply complicated nature of the orchard's legacy: everything connected, everything informed everything else, and yet the patterns only revealed themselves to those willing to sit in bathrooms and ask questions that had no answers yet. [920]
The inquiry rose in her throat like something alive, a question that she hadn't known she was waiting to ask until this moment, in this fluorescent-lit sanctuary where the orchards hummed their cosmic songs beyond the sealed door. [986] "What happens," she whispered to the cameo blank, to her grandmother's memory, to the trees that grew in rows across the asteroid like sentences waiting to be read, "when the first page meets the last?" [1054] The object warmed in her palm, the blank center beginning to glow with a soft luminescence that spread outward like ink dissolving in water, and Mira Vance realized with a brightened disquiet that tingled along her spine that she was finally, after all these years of preparation, about to inherit not just a position but a truth—a forbidden knowledge that had been passing through her family for generations, waiting for someone brave enough to ask the question that would make the inheritance complete. [1145]
The bathroom lights steadied, the luminescence faded, and in the cameo blank's center, faint as a whisper, an image began to emerge: a tree, an asteroid, and a figure standing with outstretched hands, finally no longer bewildered but understanding. [1218]
