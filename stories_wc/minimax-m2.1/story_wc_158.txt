<story>The insomniac poet lives in a garrett at the top of a house that has grown around a gargantuan shell, a spiral of impossible dimensions that she has come to call home. [56] She cannot sleep, has not slept in centuries, and so she writes. [82] The poems she composes do not live in books but drift from her window on the half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind that seems to find its way into this place from somewhere beyond the sea. [149] She finds this method of dispersal shyly unstoppable, as though her words were living things with their own determination to land somewhere other than where they were born. [202] On her wall hangs a galaxy postcard, faded at the edges but still vivid enough to remind her of someone she once knew, someone who promised to return but who has been gone so long that the promise itself has become a kind of geography she walks through each day. [282] She has learned to ensconce her longing in the architecture of verse, to make a home for ache between the lines. [336] This is what poets do: they photosynthesize pain into beauty, transforming the dark nutrients of grief into something that can grow toward light. [385] The garrett becomes a greenhouse of the spirit, where solitary grief breeds strange and luminous blooms. [429] She has grown accustomed to the peculiar reef-shadow joy that comes from making something lovely out of the long wait, from finding bioluminescence in the sustained dark. [484] The gargantuan shell spirals inward toward her chair and outward toward the world, and she has learned to live in both directions at once. [541] The half-sung lullabies that carry her poems away are the same ones she sings to herself when the weight of centuries becomes too much, when the longing stretches like taffy and she fears she might snap. [606] But she does not snap. [614] She continues, because continuing is what the shyly unstoppable do: they simply cannot stop themselves from believing that the next verse might be the one that reaches whoever is listening on the other side of the off-key wind. [691] The galaxy postcard trembles sometimes, as though someone were trying to send a response through the mail of longing itself. [745] She writes faster, poems becoming tendrils, becoming roots, becoming the blossom armistice that she offers to the silence as proof that beauty can grow from even the longest wait. [808] Too long. [812] I need to trim significantly.
Let me rewrite more concisely:
The insomniac poet lives in a garrett at the top of a house that has grown around a gargantuan shell, a spiral she has come to call home. [39] She cannot sleep, has not slept in years, and so she writes. [62] The poems she composes drift from her window on half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind that seems to find its way here from somewhere beyond the sea. [121] She finds this method of dispersal shyly unstoppable, as though her words were living things with their own determination to land somewhere other than where they were born. [170] On her wall hangs a galaxy postcard, faded at the edges but still vivid enough to remind her of someone who promised to return but has been gone so long that the promise has become a geography she walks through each day. [246] She has learned to ensconce her longing in the architecture of verse, to make a home for ache between the lines. [293] This is what poets do: they photosynthesize pain into beauty, transforming the dark nutrients of grief into something that can grow toward light. [341] The garrett becomes a greenhouse of the spirit, where solitary grief breeds strange and luminous blooms. [382] She has grown accustomed to the peculiar reef-shadow joy that comes from making something lovely out of the long wait. [432] The gargantuan shell spirals inward toward her chair and outward toward the world, and she has learned to live in both directions at once. [482] The half-sung lullabies that carry her poems away are the same ones she sings when the weight of waiting becomes too much. [531] But she does not break. [540] She continues, because continuing is what the shyly unstoppable do: they simply cannot stop themselves from believing the next verse might reach whoever is listening on the other side of the wind. [598] The galaxy postcard trembles sometimes, as though someone were trying to send a response through the mail of longing itself. [649] She writes faster, her poems becoming tendrils, becoming roots, becoming the blossom armistice she offers to the silence as proof that beauty can grow from even the longest wait. [717] </story>
