In the laboratory of lost sounds, after the power grid stabilizes, Elara worked alone in the amber glow of her equipment. She was a prism-song bell ringer by training, though those terms meant less now than they once had—titles from a world where sound engineers and light sculptors worked in concert rather than in isolated survival. The laboratory occupied what had once been a concert hall's basement, its walls still humming with echoes of performances that had ended before the grids collapsed entirely. Her task was strange even by the diminished standards of the new age: to design an artificial pilgrimage for the scattered communities seeking meaning after the long silence.
The object that anchored her work lay on her workbench—a miner's carbide lamp lens, rescued from an abandoned excavation site three valleys east. Its glass was scratched and nicked, but it caught the emergency lighting and threw it in unexpected directions, fragmenting each beam into golden shadows that danced across her schematics. Unlike the synthetic lenses she'd been issued, this piece had depth. It had known darkness underground, had guided hands through tunnels where no light should have reached. When Elara held it up to her ear—a habit she'd developed since childhood—she could almost hear the echo of its previous purpose, a resonance that no factory-made component could replicate.
The artificial pilgrimage she was constructing required precision and, more importantly, belief. People needed to feel something genuine as they moved through the experience, even if every element of the journey had been manufactured. Elara understood that the paradox was the point: in a world where authentic pilgrimage sites had been destroyed or made inaccessible by the infrastructure failures, the simulation had to contain something that felt ancestral, something that remembered. She propelled her research forward by questioning assumptions that other engineers had stopped challenging—that artificial experiences must necessarily feel hollow, that technology could not midwife transcendence.
Her method was simple but difficult to explain to the committee that funded her work. She began each design phase by asking what the pilgrims would miss if the journey were stripped away. What assumptions about sacred travel had accumulated over millennia, and which of those assumptions were essential to the experience? By questioning assumptions that most specialists accepted as foundational, she discovered that the physical destination mattered less than the transformation along the way. The pilgrimage was not about arriving but about being repeatedly interrupted, repeatedly challenged, repeatedly brought to the edge of surrender and then gently—not weakly, but powerfully gentle—urged to continue.
The laboratory of lost sounds provided her with resources no other facility possessed. In the west wing, acoustic historians maintained recordings of instruments that no longer existed, their timbres preserved in magnetic tape and crystal arrays. In the east wing, engineers worked on synthesizing the sound of dawn as it might have sounded before the noise ordinances, before the industrial amplification that had drowned out natural quiet. Elara moved between these resources like a pilgrim herself, collecting fragments that would become stations along her artificial route. The carbide lamp lens sat in her pocket as she walked, its presence a reminder that even the most sophisticated simulation needed something grounded in actual human experience.
As the weeks passed and her design took shape, Elara began to understand what she was really seeking: the texture of connection itself. Not the fact of connection, which anyone could observe between survivors helping one another, but its texture—how it felt when a stranger's hands steadied you on a rocky path, how it felt when a community's collective breath synchronized without conscious effort. She wanted pilgrims to encounter that texture in her artificial landscape, to feel the grain and warmth of human interdependence even when every stone along the path had been placed by her own hands.
On the night before the first trial run, Elara stood in the laboratory's main chamber, surrounded by the apparatus of her pilgrimage: speaker arrays disguised as ancient markers, holographic projectors hidden within replica shrines, scent diffusers calibrated to evoke memories of home. The golden shadows thrown by her miner's lens pooled at her feet like liquid courage. She knew that tomorrow would reveal whether her assumptions had been correct, whether an artificial journey could carry genuine weight. But standing there in the aftermath of catastrophe, in a world still learning to stabilize, she understood that all journeys were in some sense artificial—we constructed their meaning from the fragments we chose to carry forward. The texture of connection was not something she could manufacture. It was something she could only invite, powerfully gentle, into a space that had been prepared to receive it. [797]
