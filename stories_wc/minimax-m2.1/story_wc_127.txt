Vera was a counterfeit emotion dealer, and she took her counterfeit very seriously. [41] In the amber grotto at dusk, she waited for the transformation to complete, watching the light bend through glass walls the color of honeyed whiskey. [95] The space smelled of ethanol and old secrets, of experiments that had succeeded and others that had quietly failed. [149] On her workbench lay a fragrance chemist's blotter petal, its paper surface still damp with the compound she had spent eighteen months perfecting. [211] She was professionally thorough in all things, especially in matters of the heart, or what passed for the heart in her line of work. [273]
The compound was designed to do something that sounded impossible and perhaps was: to make people feel what others felt, genuinely, without the performance that usually accompanied empathy. [341] Not sympathy, which was easy and cheap. [355] Not compassion, which could be faked by anyone with sufficient practice. [399] But actual feeling-transference, the kind that left no room for pretense because the experience was the pretense. [460] Or rather, the experience was the truth, smuggled into the bloodstream through olfactory channels and translated into something the body could understand. [524]
She lifted the blotter petal, feeling the static electricity rise against her fingertips like tiny electric admissions. [583] This was her method, sensing through static electricity, which sounds like mysticism but was actually quite mundane: the friction of paper against skin created charge, and charge could be read if you knew how to read it. [659] She had learned to read emotional residue that way, the way a doctor reads pulse or a musician reads rhythm. [714] Her profession required her to be half truthful, always offering something real wrapped in something artificial, and she had made peace with that long ago. [779] Half truths were her medium, her raw material, the clay from which she sculpted experiences that felt more real than reality sometimes allowed. [846] She believed that what people needed was not absolute honesty but useful fiction, emotional medicine coated in sugar that would dissolve at exactly the right moment. [919] The transformation was complete now, she could feel it in the way the air seemed to hold its breath, and she brought the blotter to her nose. [987]
The scent was amber and grief, a melancholy that tasted of autumn leaves and letters never sent. [1044] It subsumed her gently, drawing her consciousness toward something larger than herself, something that hummed with the frequency of every person who had ever sat alone in a room and wondered if anyone would remember them. [1123] This was the moment she had worked toward, the fusion of her analytical insight with genuine feeling, the point where her professional knowledge became personal experience. [1192] She had designed this compound to work on others, but she had designed it on herself first, as was her way, because how could she sell an emotion she had never felt? [1270] The grief was beautiful, in the way that all true sorrow is beautiful, because it meant something had mattered enough to lose. [1334] She felt affection for it even as it moved through her, even as it rearranged the furniture of her interior world, because she was professionally detached and that detachment was its own kind of love, the love of the craftsman for her craft. [1421] This was the affectionate detachment she had cultivated over years, the ability to care deeply about something while remaining observer enough to document it, to witness her own transformation without losing herself in it. [1503] The grotto glowed amber around her, the dusk outside deepening to true night, and she understood at last that her half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest, but useful ones, necessary ones, the kind that allowed people to feel what they needed to feel when the raw truth was too much to bear. [1618] She exhaled slowly, releasing the grief and the insight and the empathy that had cost her so much to create, and she already knew what she would do next, because she was professionally thorough, and the work was never finished, only suspended.
