The package arrived on a Thursday, which was unusual because nothing ever arrived for Aldric Vane anymore. [17] He set down his coffee, the third cup of a morning that had already stretched into afternoon, and studied the wrapped box on his front step. [51] No return address. [55] No sender's name. [63] Just his name in handwriting he didn't recognize, and a weight that seemed to shift when he picked it up, as though the contents weren't quite decided on what they wanted to be. [113]
Aldric was an undertaker by trade and inclination, a man who had spent thirty years helping the departed find their way to whatever came next. [166] His hands had grown steady from the work, his eyes had grown tired from the watching, and his heart—well, his heart had grown something else entirely, something he couldn't name but felt as a persistent ache behind his ribs whenever he closed the front gate after a funeral. [227] He had become, without meaning to, inadvertently stubborn in his methods, refusing the new chemical embalming techniques that other morticians had adopted, insisting instead on the old ways, the slow ways, the ways that required him to spend real time with the bodies in his care. [290] The living found this strange. [305] The dead, he suspected, appreciated it.
Inside the box, cushioned in sand that smelled of salt despite coming from nowhere near the coast, lay pieces of glass curved into a parabolic shape. [367] A lighthouse lens, he realized, but broken into three jagged sections, each edge still sharp enough to draw blood if he wasn't careful. [420] As he touched it, Aldric heard something—a sound like a foghorn, distant and mournful, echoing through rooms that shouldn't have existed in his small house on Pemberton Street. [478] The sound pulled at him, not physically but something deeper, some part of his profession that dealt with the spaces between life and whatever followed it. [535]
When he looked up, he was standing in water that came to his waist, in a library that should have been淹没ed centuries ago. [591] Bookshelves rose like ribs from the seafloor, their books swollen and strange, their pages preserved by some miracle or curse Aldric couldn't determine. [648] Light filtered down from somewhere impossibly far above, casting the underwater city in shades of gray-green and forgotten. [700] And in the center of this impossible space, suspended between floor and ceiling as though gravity had simply given up, floated a structure that wasn't quite a chair, wasn't quite a throne, but occupied both states at once. [763]
Aldric understood then why he'd been chosen. [780] The lens had been a distress signal, not for ships but for something else—for the souls who had died in the lighthouse collapse forty years ago, the ones whose bodies had never been recovered, the ones who had been searching ever since for someone to help them find their way. [844] They gathered around him now, translucent and confused, their memories tangled with salt and storm and the terrible moment when the light had gone dark and they had been swallowed by the sea. [906]
"I'm here," he said, and the words bubble-doubled around him, rising toward that impossible light. [954]
The work he did there in that forgotten underwater library was different from any he'd done before. [1005] No embalming fluid, no ritual washing, no carefully chosen words spoken over wooden boxes. [1054] Instead, Aldric sat with each soul individually, in that impossible throne-chair that somehow held both him and them at once, and he listened. [1114] He listened to their stories, their regrets, their unfinished business, and slowly, painstakingly, he helped them release it. [1170] It was revitalizing in a way he hadn't expected—not for them, though for them too, but for himself. [1225] The ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade, replaced by something that felt almost like purpose restored.
The broken lighthouse lens sat in his lap throughout, its pieces slowly knitting together as he worked, drawn by whatever magic or logic governed impossible spaces. [1294] By the time the last soul had passed through—on to whatever came next, given the permanent address Aldric had helped them find—the lens was whole again, glowing softly with a light that would never go dark.
When Aldric returned to his house on Pemberton Street, the package was gone, the sand was gone, and his coffee had finally gone cold. [1373] But in his hands he held something impossible: a lighthouse lens that worked not for ships at sea but for souls at rest, a signal that would call him when someone needed help finding their way. [1439]
He poured out the cold coffee and made a fresh pot, sitting by the window to wait. [1485] The stillness he had chased for so long had finally found him, and he discovered that he wasn't tired anymore. [1543] He was ready. [1549]
