<story>In the hushed sanctuary of ice, she tended flickering memories like delicate flames, her role as ghost-whisperer transcending mere salvage. The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice held her patient work, each frozen wall a vessel for preservation, each soft radiance borrowed starlight from worlds beyond this frozen hollow. She had come to expose what the sea had taken, weaving truth carefully from fragments strangers carried in their dreams.
Her method was singular: analyzing the cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, those brief and luminous arrivals of the departed. Each dreamer hosted a fragment without knowing its weight—a child's laugh, a lingering scent, the particular way someone once stood in doorway light. She collected these impressions like fallings of gentle snow, piecing them together until patterns emerged from the chaos. The glacier held her secrets cold, and she let its patient silence teach her how to listen.
The melted snow globe rested on the shrine's central plinth, its once-clear waters now a cloudy suspension of something precious dissolved. She had pulled it from the wreck herself, diving through the wreck-diver's sacred darkness where wooden bones rose like cathedral ribs from the sand. The object had survived when so much else had been claimed, and she understood its preservation as a form of stubborn testimony. Within its cloudy depths, she had glimpsed something that drove her investigation: a photograph, tiny and waterlogged, showing a face that appeared again and again in the dreams she studied.
She wove truth carefully, as one weaves silk from scattered threads. The dream cameos painted a portrait in fragments—a child lost to the sea, bright hair and bright smile, a favorite song that dreamers hummed without knowing why. Strangers across coastal towns carried these borrowed images, each hosting the same small ghost without understanding the source. The phenomenon had drawn her here, to this shrine where candles guttered in glacial air and the snow globe slowly continued its dissolving.
The photographs had revealed themselves to her patient analysis, hidden within the globe's murky heart like a message in a bottle. A girl of seven, dressed for a voyage that would become her last, her image preserved in this floating sanctuary while her body remained somewhere in the wreck's shadowed depths. The shrine's candles cast their borrowed light across the evidence she had gathered, and she understood her purpose with crystalline clarity. She had come to give this child back her name, to anchor her memory where it could finally rest.
Her investigation had traced the dream-cameos through dozens of sleepers, each one a breadcrumb on a path through darkness. The mother appeared most frequently, her face a mask of grief in every vision, her hands always reaching toward water. Other figures drifted through the dreams—a sailor who had watched the sinking, a passenger who had survived, all of them carrying fragments of a tragedy that had unfolded decades past. The child's face emerged from these collective visions like a photograph developing in solution, until she knew the girl's name, her favorite flowers, the song she had hummed on the final morning.
The shrine held the truth she had assembled, and as dawn bled through the glacier's blue walls, she prepared to expose what she had found. Her motivation had never been simple recovery; she sought to salvage something pure from the wreckage, a single untainted memory rescued from the salt and dark. The snow globe continued its patient melting, its cloudy waters gradually yielding the last of their secrets, and she understood that her work here was nearly finished.
She would find the living relatives, the scattered family who had lost their youngest to the sea. The dreams had shown her the way—the mother's face had led her through a web of connections, each dreamer a node in a network of forgotten grief. The child's story would not remain silent. In this borrowed starlight, beneath the glacier's ancient hold, she would give the nameless girl her voice at last. [792]</story>
