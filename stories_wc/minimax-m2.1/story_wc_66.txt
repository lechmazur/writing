In the years after the story famine, when the airwaves had gone quiet and the printed word had grown thin as ash, Mira worked by candlelight in her ember alcove, copying orchestral scores with the patience of someone who believed that every note preserved was a story saved from vanishing entirely. [102]
The mist rolled through the ruined city in slow waves, finding its way through the cracked windows of her sanctuary, but she barely noticed anymore. She had grown accustomed to the way the fog softened the edges of her small workshop, turning the scattered papers and well-worn reference books into ghosts of their daytime selves. [214]
Her shortwave radio sat on the shelf above her workbench, its dial casting a faint amber glow that she had learned to love more than any lamp. The glow was secretly luminous—she had wrapped the casing in darkened cloth so that the light would not attract attention from the patrols that still wandered the streets, listening for unauthorized broadcasts. [325]
For that was Mira's secret work, her true calling beyond the official copying she performed for the sparse orchestra that still gathered in the great hall when weather permitted. She was a pirate broadcaster, though not of the old-fashioned sort that sought profit or power. She broadcast stories, ones she had reconstructed from memory, from fragments of old scores, from the whispered histories that elderly survivors passed down like treasured heirlooms. [455]
The method she had developed was unconventional, even strange to those who first stumbled upon her signal. She cloaked her stories within song lyrics, weaving narrative into melody in ways that made the words slippery and elusive to anyone listening without intention. A patrol officer might hear only a strange folk tune, humming with minor-key melancholy. But someone who was searching, someone whose soul was hungry for meaning, would suddenly find themselves immersed in a tale—of lovers separated by the famine, of children who had kept stories alive by telling them into empty rooms, of the way music itself had become a form of resistance. [596]
Tonight, as the mist pressed closer and her ember alcove glowed with the warmth of a single coal brazier, Mira prepared her broadcast with particular care. She had been teaching the dust to tell stories for months now, ever since she had discovered that the fine gray powder that accumulated in the corners of old buildings held something strange and wonderful within it. [714]
The dust remembered. [720]
Not in any supernatural sense, at least not one she could explain, but in a way that felt just as real to her meticulous, scientific mind. When she had first noticed that the ancient dust in the archive basement seemed to shift when she hummed certain melodies, she had dismissed it as fancy. But the pattern persisted, and eventually she had understood: the dust had absorbed stories over decades, particles settling over conversations and readings and performances, each grain carrying a whisper of what had passed above it. [843]
So she had learned to coax the stories out, using her broadcasts as a kind of lantern to illuminate what the dust had preserved. The thistled calm that characterized her work—the gentle determination, the peaceful resolve that carried her through cold nights and dwindling supplies—came from knowing that she was not merely telling stories. She was teaching dust to speak, teaching the forgotten to remember, teaching a hungry world that stories could still grow in the most unlikely places. [966]
She adjusted the dial of her radio, watching the secret luminous glow pulse once in acknowledgment, and began to sing. [1026]
The lyrics that emerged were carefully chosen, each word carrying more than its obvious meaning, each phrase a door that would open only for those who knew how to knock. The mist outside seemed to listen, drawing closer to the windows, and the dust in the corners began to stir with something that might have been anticipation. [1149]
In the ruined city, in the years after the story famine, Mira the diligent orchestra copyist continued her quiet revolution. [1208]
