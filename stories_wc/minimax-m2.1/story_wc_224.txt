<story>The mercury-glass seer had not always lived in the mountain's throat, but after remembering became painful, the cavernous bookstore became her only sanctuary. Each night, when her reflections substituted reality, she wandered the infinite shelves alone, her translucent form casting no shadow in the electric lamplight. The building wound through the mountain's core like a digestive tract of knowledge, its corridors branching into studies of astronomy, lost civilizations, and the particular architecture of grief. She had come here to understand the shape of home, though she no longer remembered whether she was searching for a place she had lost or a place she had never found.
Among the ten thousand shelves, one volume drew her attention above all others—a stone tablet wrapped in velvet, its surface covered in the lost language of her ancestors. The letters were raised like tiny mountains, each character possessing a texture that felt impossibly like feather against her glass fingertips. When she touched it, visions bloomed behind her mercury eyes: her grandmother speaking words she could not hear, her childhood home dissolving into mist, her talent—a gift of prophecy that had once come freely—buried beneath years of silence she had imposed upon herself.
The keeper of the bookstore, an old man whose eyes contained the same storms that lived behind her own, watched her from the shadows. He had seen her kind before: seers who buried their talents deep when the weight of knowing became unbearable. "The stone will not reveal itself to those who merely look," he said, his voice carrying the hidden thunder of impending change. "You must plant something of yourself within it. A seed. An honest question asked without armor."
She considered his words for seven nights, each evening finding her seated before the stone, her fingers tracing its feathered ridges while her other self substituted reality with dreams of roads that led everywhere and nowhere. On the eighth night, she finally understood what she had been resisting. The talent she had buried was not a curse to be feared but a garden to be cultivated, and the pain of remembering existed precisely because something precious had been lost—not destroyed, but dormant, waiting for her to tend it again.
The seer pressed her palm flat against the stone and spoke aloud, her voice barely a whisper in the vast silence of the bookstore. "I want to remember what home felt like before I learned to fear my own sight." The lost language beneath her fingers began to glow, each character pulsing with warm light as the stone translated her longing into the tongue of her ancestors. The words that emerged were not answers but permissions, a vocabulary of healing that had been waiting for her to become ready to receive it.
The buried talent rose like water finding its level after a long winter. She saw not visions of what would be, but memories of what had always been: her grandmother's kitchen wrapped in the smell of herbs, her mother's laughter echoing through hallways that existed now only in this sacred language, her own young voice speaking prophecy without fear. The pain was there, sharp and sudden, but it came paired with something she had forgotten could exist—gratitude for having been given such gifts at all.
The stone's light faded, leaving her alone with the keeper and the endless shelves. "The shape of home," he said softly, "is not a place you find. It is a language you learn to speak with everything you are." She looked at her mercury-glass hands and saw, for the first time, that they were not a prison but a vessel. The talent she had buried had been waiting patiently, like a seed beneath snow, for her to return and water it with honesty.
The seer rose from the floor of the labyrinthine bookstore, her decision crystallizing with the quiet certainty of thunder that has finally found its release. She would leave the mountain—not to escape her gifts, but to carry them where they were needed. The lost language stone slipped into her pocket, its feather-textured surface warm against her thigh. Her reflections still substituted reality each night, but now she understood that this was not a fracture but a doorway, a place where her buried talents could walk between worlds and return with wisdom.
Behind her, the bookstore exhaled the scent of old paper and older secrets. The keeper watched her go, knowing that she would return one day—when remembering was no longer painful, but simply a way of honoring the long road home. [798]</story>
