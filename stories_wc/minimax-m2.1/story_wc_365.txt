The repair bay hummed with the silence of abandoned things. [10] Kira ran her fingers along the cold metal walls, feeling the residual vibrations of ships long since departed, their departures etched into the very molecular structure of the steel. [41] As a sensory map maker, she charted places not by coordinates but by impressions—the grief embedded in a corridor, the hope that still lingered near the loading docks, the particular quality of longing that accumulated in spaces where many had passed through without looking back. [104] This was the abandoned Kepler-7 spaceport, and she had come here because the green glass shard in her pocket had led her, as it always did, to places where the membrane between worlds grew thin. [167]
The shard was no larger than her thumb, its surface swirling with colors that existed in no earthly spectrum. [217] She had found it seven years ago in the ruins of a colony station, and since then her maps had begun to change—mapping not just this world but the spaces between, the vast architecture of parallel universes that most humans would never perceive. [285] The gift, if it was a gift, came with a price: her mind cycled through periods of intense clarity and periods of strange forgetting, moments when she could not distinguish between memories she had lived and memories she had absorbed from the other sides. [364] The doctors called it cyclically spontaneous dissociation. [391] She called it the cost of seeing.
In the center of the repair bay, a massive crane hung motionless above an empty cradle, waiting for ships that would never return. [452] Kira climbed the catwalk, her boots ringing against the grated floor, and when she reached the top, she pressed the green shard against the crane's control panel. [516] The glass glowed, and the air shifted—not a physical wind but a cognitive one, a sense of everything tilting slightly to one side as reality's grip loosened. [584] Through the murmur of half-remembered dreams, she felt the presence she had been chasing for months now: the truth that her mentor, who had disappeared three years ago, had been trying to tell her before he left. [658]
She had come to redirect the flow. [679] Not to escape to another world, as she had done so many times before, but to hold the passage open long enough to reach through and pull something back—not a thing but an understanding, the weight of what he had known and never shared. [756] The membrane between worlds began to thin, and Kira saw through the shimmer to the repair bay on the other side, identical but lived in, where a version of herself was sitting at the console, hands trembling, about to make a choice that would determine everything that came after. [839] This was the moment, she realized, the withheld truth that had been driving her: she had been here before, many times, and every cycle she returned to this same junction, trying to change the outcome by redirecting the flow of causality itself. [916] The green glass shard had not led her to this place—she had led the shard, following the thread of her own desperation through parallel universes, searching for the version of events where her mentor had lived to explain what was happening to her. [994]
The shimmer deepened, and the air filled with the murmur of half-remembered dreams—her dreams, his dreams, the dreams of all the travelers who had passed through this junction across all the worlds that touched here. [1071] Kira understood now that the truth she sought was not something withheld by another person but something she had been withholding from herself: the knowledge that her ability was not a gift but a wound, a seam in her consciousness that had opened when she touched the shard and would never fully close. [1158] The weight of this truth was not in discovering it but in carrying it, in accepting that she would forever weave between worlds, mapping the spaces that existed in the liminal moments between what was and what might have been. [1231] She lowered her hand, and the shimmer faded, and the repair bay returned to its abandoned silence—but Kira was no longer the same person who had climbed the catwalk. [1302] She had redirected something, not the flow between worlds but her own understanding of why she moved between them, and in that redirection, she found something she had not expected: not peace, but purpose, the particular weight of a truth finally set down after years of carrying it without knowing. [1386] She slipped the green glass shard back into her pocket and began her descent, already feeling the pull of the next junction, the next place where the membrane thinned and the murmur of half-remembered dreams whispered of all the worlds she had yet to map. [1470]
