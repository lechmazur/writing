The curator of lost causes had not always curated loss. [9] Before time became visible—when it had still moved in its invisible river, carrying all things downstream toward oblivion—Vespera Thorne had been a voice in the revolution's chorus, demanding the asteroid's forgotten histories be spoken aloud. [46] Now she walked the baroque corridors of Archive Hall, her footsteps leaving temporary impressions in the visible time that pooled like amber honey along the floors, and she understood that revolutions, too, leave sediment. [103]
The archaeological dispute had divided scholars for three visible years, which was approximately eleven of the old invisible ones. [147] At its heart lay a question that time's sudden visibility had made urgent: were the founders of the baroque asteroid civilization explorers or refugees? [194] The shard of crystal vase in Vespera's pocket—found in excavation quadrant seven, its edges still sharp enough to draw blood when she touched it improperly—suggested the latter. [244] The vase bore markings in a language no living scholar could read, but the imagery was unmistakable: figures fleeing something vast and dark, their belongings clutched to their chests, their faces turned toward uncertainty. [295]
The storm warning sounded through Archive Hall's brass pipes, that particular tone that meant the time-currents would soon run backward, rewinding events by minutes or sometimes centuries. [346] Vespera moved with practiced urgency, her poet's heart understanding that storms did not merely scramble time—they exposed it, made visible the layers that normally remained hidden beneath the present moment. [397] She began the methodical work of covering every mirror in the eastern wing. [421] The mirrors, she had discovered through years of careful experimentation, acted as conduits during temporal storms, drawing the visible time toward reflective surfaces and concentrating its force. [473] Uncovered, they would pull fragments of the past fully into the present, creating overlaps that could drive observers mad with temporal dissonance. [520] Covered properly, they instead served as buffers, allowing the storm's energy to dissipate harmlessly into the baroque asteroid's crystalline walls. [568]
It had taken her months to devise this method, longer still to convince the governing council of its necessity. [610] They had laughed at first—the poet who had failed her revolution, now claiming expertise in temporal mechanics. [651] But the overlaps had decreased by seven-tenths since implementing her mirror-covering protocols, and the council had learned to trust her strange expertise. [695] She had traded one kind of revolution for another: instead of fighting for a civilization's future, she now fought to understand its past, to hold both in the visible light and decide what was worth keeping. [749]
The mirrors were nearly all draped when Vespera paused before the great reflective surface in Archive Hall's heart. [790] She uncovered her own face, watching the visible time ripple across her features like water over stones. [833] The burnished sorrow she carried had grown smoother over the years, less jagged with grief, more like a polished stone in her pocket—the shard of vase, she realized, had taught her something about carrying fragments without being cut by them. [886]
The storm hit then, and time tore open along the eastern wall. [911] For a moment—less than a heartbeat, more than an instant—Vespera saw them: the founders, not as the archaeologists claimed, bold and victorious, but as they truly were, hollow-eyed and desperate, their escape pod cracked, their hopes leaking into the vacuum. [967] The image vanished as the mirrors completed their work, drawing the temporal violence inward and dissolving it into decorative light. [1009]
Vespera reached into her pocket and touched the vase shard's edge. [1033] The archaeological dispute would continue, of course. [1051] Scholars would argue over whether to revise the official histories, whether to teach children that their ancestors had been conquerors or survivors. [1096] But she knew now, with the certainty that comes from seeing, that the truth mattered less than what civilizations chose to make of their truths. [1143] The revolution she had fought in her youth had failed because it demanded a single story, a single future. [1184] This one—this quiet work of devising methods, covering mirrors, holding shards—would succeed because it held space for multiplicity, for the baroque complexity of what it meant to be both lost and found. [1236]
She covered the final mirror as the storm quieted, and in the reflective dark behind the cloth, she imagined a civilization learning to see itself clearly: not as the noble explorers of official record, not as the pitiful refugees of the shard's testimony, but as both, as all, as the kind of beautiful and terrible thing that covers its mirrors during storms and still chooses to look.
