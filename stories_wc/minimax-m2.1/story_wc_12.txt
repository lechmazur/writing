Father Matthias pressed the loop pedal with his sandaled foot, and the first phrase of the Latin chant began its eternal return, circling back upon itself like a question that refused resolution. [71] The church of St. Bartholomew's dimensional anchor had stood for seven centuries, its stones laid by monks who understood that certain places held reality's fabric more tightly than others, stitching the visible world to something older and more patient. [141] He had decorated the sanctuary with silence, removing bells and candles and anything that might intrude upon the particular quality of stillness he required for his work, his true work, the investigation of thresholds. [204]
The possession would complete at midnight. [221] He checked his pocket watch with the cracked crystal face—11:47—and felt the air's weight shift as something prepared to manifest fully in the body of the boy lying in the vestry, Gabriel Moreno, age nine, whose family had brought him here after three hospitals and two exorcists had failed. [300] The physician at St. Vincent's had used medical terms. The Orthodox priest had used ancient prayers. Matthias would use something rarer: questions. [366]
He spread the artist's palette on the altar before him, its well-worn wood warm from years of his hands, and examined the single color that remained. [427] Alizarin crimson, the color of blood and wine and the inside of a wound just beginning to heal. [478] He had painted with it for decades before understanding that its singular presence was the point—that all other colors were merely distractions from what mattered, the essential fact of presence itself, the stubborn insistence of being. [556]
"Tell me," he said to the empty church, to the looped chant, to the dimensional anchor holding space open around him, "what you believe I assume that I do not know." [626]
The question plumbed the air through rhetorical devices his seminary training had made natural as breathing, devices he had learned from the Scholastics and the Desert Fathers and later from the rhetoricians of ancient Athens, whose questions had pierced harder truths than demons. [706] He believed that possession required cooperation, an unspoken agreement hidden in the architecture of assumption, and his life's work was the illumination of those hidden agreements, the renegotiation of contracts signed in fear or ignorance. [781]
The loop pedal clicked softly as he adjusted the feedback, and the chant multiplied, three voices where there had been one, filling the church with layered prayer that rose and fell and rose again like breath. [852] Gabriel screamed from the vestry—not in pain, Matthias noted with clinical precision, but in frustration, the fury of something caught between arrivals. [915] The possession had begun six days ago but would not finish, stalled at the threshold like a guest unable to decide whether to enter or retreat. [976]
"Why this child?" Matthias asked the darkness gathering in the corners, darkness that moved with intention, that decorated itself with silence before speaking. [1043] "What does he have that you lack? What does he know that you need?" [1094]
The stillness in the church began to unravel, threads of quiet pulling apart to reveal something underneath, something brighter and more terrible than absence. [1156] This was the moment he had structured his entire practice around, the muffled clarity that came before revelation, where truth existed in a state of becoming, neither hidden nor fully shown. [1221]
The alizarin crimson on the palette caught the last light through the west window, and Matthias understood at last the single color's purpose. [1282] It was not limitation but focus, the same focus he brought to his questions, the same focus the dimensional anchor brought to reality's weave. [1343] Every other element in his life had been preparation for this interrogation, this plumb line dropped into the darkness to measure depth, to find bottom. [1405]
The loop pedal clicked once more, and the chant became a wall of sound, impossible to think through, designed to create space in the mind for answers to emerge. [1468] Matthias lifted the palette, the single color glowing like a wound that refused to heal, and walked toward the vestry where Gabriel's struggle continued, where the possession hovered on the edge of completion, where hidden assumptions about possession and power and the nature of thresholds waited to be illuminated by questions asked in the right way at the right moment in the right place. [1580] The dimensional anchor held steady, and Father Matthias entered the threshold. [1633]
