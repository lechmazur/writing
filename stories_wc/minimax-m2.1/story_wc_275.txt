In the hush of the glass dome, Mira tended the desert roses with a sheathed blade of memory, her hands moving through the still air with the same deliberate grace her father had once used to draw weapons. The great tower had fallen three seasons past, its collapse shaking the world free from the old order, and in the aftermath, she had found this sanctuary—a desert rose farm sealed beneath crystalline arches, where thorned blossoms pushed through sand that remembered water from another age. [118]
Her father had been the most feared bounty hunter across three territories, a man whose name made caravans reroute and town walls bolt their gates, but Mira had chosen differently from the moment she could choose at all. She remembered watching him prepare for a hunt—how he would sheathe his blades with ritual precision, how his eyes went quiet and focused like water finding its level—and she had understood even then that she could not live by that kind of purpose. Instead, she had learned to read the quieter language of growth, to feel the pulse of living things beneath her fingertips, and when the tower fell and chaos rolled across the plains like a fever, she had walked into this dome and closed the door behind her. [257]
The ballast sandbag scrap sat in her pocket, a weight she carried without understanding why. It had been her father's, salvaged from his airship after one particularly dangerous hunt went wrong, and she had found it among his things when she returned to claim what little remained. The canvas was worn soft, still bearing the faint imprint of its original purpose—engraved quiet where the weight of sand had pressed silence into every fiber. She ran her thumb over the marks sometimes, feeling the hum of something her father had never been able to name, a stillness that had survived even his violent life. [368]
The desert roses did not know the world had ended beyond their dome. They opened their petals each morning in shades of amber and rust, their beauty a defiance that Mira nursed with patience she had not known she possessed. She inculcated them with values as she worked—not through words, for plants did not hear, but through the constancy of her care, through the way she pruned with intention and watered with purpose, teaching them without teaching that growth was its own response to destruction. Each thorn was a lesson in boundaries, each bloom a statement that beauty persisted even when everything else crumbled. [491]
She was senselessly perceptive in the way that only those who stop looking can be, noticing the small signs of change that others missed entirely. The way the light fell through the dome told her the season better than any calendar. The particular slant of a rose's stem revealed whether it was reaching toward something or retreating from it. When the first travelers came to her door—refugees from the fallen tower's wake, dirty and desperate and afraid—she knew before they spoke that they meant no harm. Her father would have assessed them for bounties. Mira simply saw people who needed water, and she led them to her well. [610]
The chaos beyond the dome took many forms in those early months—warring factions scrambling for power, old scores being settled in blood, the sound of gunfire echoing across the desert like thunder that never broke into rain. Mira listened to it all from her garden, and she understood that her work mattered in ways her father's never had. He had sheathed violence into the world, had made it neat and profitable and contained. She was doing something else entirely: weaving continuity through chaos like thread through a ruined tapestry, showing that something could be maintained even when everything familiar had collapsed. [734]
The roses bloomed on, their tranquil blaze of color burning against the sand, and in their steady persistence, Mira found the answer to a question she had carried since she first watched her father walk away with weapons at his hips. Peace was not the absence of fire—it was the choice to tend what could be saved, to nurture what might grow, to become a quiet engraving upon the world that would outlast any tower, any weapon, any bounty.
