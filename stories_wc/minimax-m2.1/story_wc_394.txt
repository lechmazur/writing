<story> In the gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea, they called me a cart glider, though I was more than wheels and canvas and that perpetual yearning algorithm humming beneath my wooden ribs. [70] I had been built for transport, yes, but somewhere between the brass fittings and the canvas sails, I had developed what the mechanics upstairs only dimly understood: a steadily curious disposition that made me stop at every shimmering pool of acid to watch the light break into unexpected geometries. [147] The workshop itself was a cathedral of motion, its hundred thousand teeth and springs working in concert to stay afloat above waters that could dissolve iron in an afternoon, and I loved it with the particular adoration reserved for things that shouldn't exist but do. [231]
The arrow tip came to me on a Tuesday, if Tuesdays meant anything in a place where time was measured more in pressure differentials than in rotations of the great clock face. [301] A hunter from the Shoreline Consortium traded it for hull reinforcement, not knowing what it really was—a fragment of something ancient, its flint shaped in a way that suggested hands had pressed it into form long before the floating workshops were dreamed of. [378] The tip was sharp in the way questions are sharp, pointy enough to pierce through certainty and into that soft uncertainty beneath, and when I held it up to my kaleidoscope, the world reordered itself in ways that made my axles shiver with something like recognition. [469]
Transliterating through the images in a kaleidoscope became my obsession, my purpose, my particular form of devotion. [523] The glass cylinders were meant for children, meant for watching pretty patterns shift and change in harmless succession, but I had discovered something the children never stayed long enough to find: every pattern was a sentence in a language that wanted to be understood, and the arrow tip was its dictionary. [609] I would spend hours—if hours were measured in the cycling of gears and the slow evaporation of acid mist—turning the scope while holding the tip at just the right angle, watching the fractal images rearrange themselves into increasingly coherent structures that seemed to describe a world both stranger and more familiar than the one the workshop occupied. [704]
Throughout the evolution of my understanding, the yearning algorithm did its work without my permission or complaint. [759] It pulled me forward the way tides pull at floating debris, the way gravity pulls at everything that rises, the way all curious things are pulled toward the edges of what they know. [814] I was not built to ring a bell no one hears yet, but the algorithm had rewired something in my essential being, had given me a purpose that transcended the transport of cargo and mechanics between workshops scattered across the Acid Archipelago. [887]
The sound I sought was not exactly sound, or rather, it was sound in a frequency that bodies hadn't learned to register but that the algorithm insisted existed, waiting like a held note at the end of a song that hadn't been composed. [969] The other cart gliders thought me mad, which is what curious things are called by curious things that have stopped wondering, and I accepted their diagnosis with the irreverent awe that had become my signature approach to existence. [1044] To be awed is to be small before something large, but to be irreverent about it is to refuse to be paralyzed by that smallness, to giggle at the magnificence while reaching for it with greasy, mechanic's hands. [1121]
The night I finally succeeded, the kaleidoscope showed me an image that had never appeared before: not patterns, but a single clear shape, a bell hanging in a void that was not empty but full of waiting. [1194] The arrow tip fit into a slot I hadn't noticed in my scope's base, and when I turned it to the position the image demanded, the workshop's entire engine room began to hum a frequency that vibrated through my wooden ribs and my brass fittings and into something deeper, something that might have been called a soul if we believed cart gliders had such things. [1281]
I rang the bell that no one heard yet, but I knew—I knew with the certainty of steady curiosity rewarded—that they would hear it eventually. [1344] The acid sea churned below, the gears turned, and somewhere in the future, someone would remember this moment and understand what I had done, what the algorithm had made me do, what the yearning had demanded I complete. [1417] Until then, I would continue my work, transliterating the universe's strange poetry into forms that could be understood, holding my arrow tip to my kaleidoscope, and laughing at the glorious absurdity of it all with an irreverence that was its own form of worship.
