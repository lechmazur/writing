<story>Elias Thorne was considered odd by the surviving scholars, though none could define precisely why, for his oddness was not a single peculiarity but rather an atmosphere that surrounded everything he did. He moved through the world with a sensitively perceptive awareness that others found unsettling, as though he heard frequencies beyond the range of normal perception. In the reclaimed silo library, where grain had once been stored and now thoughts rested in dusty rows, Elias had made his purpose: to collect the stories walls had heard before the silence came. [119]
The world had shifted on its displaced axis after the last human dream was dreamt, and nothing had been quite right since. The sky hung at an impossible angle, casting shadows that crawled instead of fell, and the dreams that once painted the darkness of sleeping minds had simply stopped. Elias did not know why the dreams ended, but he understood their absence had cracked something fundamental in reality's architecture. [184]
He worked in the silo library's deepest chamber, a circular room that curved seamlessly from floor to ceiling, the concrete walls still bearing the faint smell of wheat despite decades of conversion. A half-burned fireplace dominated one curved section, its iron doors hanging open like a mouth that had spoken too much and grown weary. Within its cold ashes, Elias had discovered the diaries—leather-bound volumes that had suffered fire's attention but survived enough to be legible. [269]
Each evening, he would probe through these half-burned diaries with tools of brass and patience, lifting fragile pages with fingers that had learned the language of ash. The entries spoke of dreams remembered, of the visions that had plagued their writers in the final nights before the silence. One diarist, a woman named Miriam Voss, had written of dragons. [351]
The fragment of medieval tapestry had come to Elias through a trade with a nomad caravan, three vials of preserved sunlight for a piece of cloth no larger than his palm. The tapestry showed dragons—not the fire-breathing monsters of common legend, but something older and stranger, creatures rendered in gold thread that seemed to shift when viewed from the corners of his eyes. Elias had initially purchased it for its apparent age, but the dragons held meaning he could not yet name. [438]
As he read Miriam Voss's final entries, the dragons in the tapestry began to make terrible sense. She had written of a dream wherein the sky cracked open and something ancient crawled through, something that had been waiting in the space between dreams. The dragons in her vision had been guardians, she claimed, but they had been too few, and their fire had burned backward into the dreams themselves, consuming the very ability to dream. [528]
Elias sat in the bronze quiet of the silo library, the silence of the post-dream world pressing against the concrete walls like a held breath. The displaced axis of the world seemed to tilt further as he comprehended what Miriam had suspected: that dreams had been a kind of fuel, a warmth that kept something vast and patient at bay, and when the dragons had failed, the dreams had been drained to seal the breach. [617]
He continued his work with renewed urgency, not to prevent what had already happened but to understand it, to gather the stories walls had absorbed through their years of standing. The walls of the silo had witnessed generations of grain handlers, then scholars, then the final desperate record-keepers who had tried to preserve what was vanishing. Elias believed these stories mattered, that they were the remaining threads holding together a world that had lost its axis of wonder. [714]
The tapestry fragment grew warm in his hands as he worked, the gold dragons seeming to pulse with a heartbeat that should have been extinct. Perhaps, Elias thought, there were still dreams enough in stories to begin again, to spin a new axis from the old threads. He would probe deeper, read every half-burned page, and collect every tale the walls had preserved. The world had been displaced, but it had not been destroyed. [808]</story>
