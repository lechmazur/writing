The anesthesia dissolved like sugar in rain, leaving Mira with the copper taste of awakening and the phantom weight of restraints still circling her skull. [52] She reached up to find only the pewter mask strap, cool and insistent against her temples, a relic they had forgotten to remove or perhaps deliberately left as a reminder. [97] Through the canopy above, the forest burned with ultraviolet light, each leaf and branch rendered in shades she had no names for, colors that existed only in the space between what eyes were meant to see and what they could survive. [154]
She braced herself against the nearest tree, her proprioceptively enhanced sense of body now a curse that told her exactly how wrong everything felt, every joint slightly displaced from where memory insisted it should be. [211] The interrogation had lasted three weeks by her count, though time had become a rubber band stretched between pain and the blessed absence of it, between waking and the merciful darkness they induced when she stopped talking. [266] She had talked eventually, she remembered that now with a shame that lived in her stomach rather than her mind, and she had hated herself for it even as her body had betrayed her, trembling and sweating and begging for an end to the questions. [322]
The mathematics of mercy had become her obsession in those fluorescent rooms, a way to make sense of what they had done to her and what she had allowed herself to become. [375] If she could quantify it, measure mercy in units of pain and time, perhaps she could understand where she had gone wrong, where the balance had tipped from survival into complicity. [430] The scientists had called her special, had pointed to the enhanced proprioception and the way her nervous system adapted to stimuli that would have killed a normal person, but Mira understood now that special was just another word for damaged in a language that preferred euphemisms. [489]
She walked through the ultraviolet forest because there was nowhere else to go, the facility's doors having been left deliberately unlocked as if freedom was just another form of experiment. [545] Her bare feet found the moss path automatically, her body remembering what her mind had been trained to forget, and she realized with a start that this was how the remembering worked now, not through conscious recollection but through the body's responses, through the way her heart raced at certain wavelengths of light and her muscles locked at the memory of straps and needles. [602]
The pewter mask strap had begun to hum, a frequency she felt in her teeth and the base of her skull, and Mira understood that it was not merely a strap at all but a beacon of some kind, calling her back toward the place she had escaped or forward toward something she did not yet have words for. [661] She did not remove it. [669] The mathematics of mercy, she was beginning to suspect, did not live in answers but in the questions themselves, in the willingness to walk through fire without knowing where the fire led, in the choice to remain rooted to her own devastation rather than fleeing from it into the comfortable numbness they had offered her. [728]
The forest began to thin, and Mira saw ahead of her a clearing where the ultraviolet light gathered like water in a basin, a space that existed outside of ordinary geometry and ordinary time. [779] She stopped at its edge, her proprioceptively enhanced body trembling with the understanding that whatever waited for her there would demand a price she had not yet calculated, would ask her to trade the arithmetic of her wounds for something stranger and perhaps more true. [840]
