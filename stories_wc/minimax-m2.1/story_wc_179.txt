In the soundless sanctuary, where light bent at impossible angles and walls breathed with borrowed time, Mira pressed the broken music box against her chest and listened for its heartbeat. The cylinder pin had snapped three days ago when the shifting began, and with it, the melody that might have saved them all. She had never considered herself a violent person—quite the opposite, in fact—but schemes required谋划, and she had been scheming since the first fracture in reality rippled through their world.
"You're still here." The voice belonged to Kael, his form flickering between solid and translucent as grace shifted around them like sand through fingers. He had been her brother once, before resentment calcified his heart into something the changing world could not touch.
Mira stood, the music box cradled like evidence. "I need to convince you of something."
"That seems pointless now." Kael laughed, though no sound emerged—the sanctuary consumed all vibration, leaving only the memory of noise. "Reality is falling apart, and you want to talk."
The walls of the sanctuary were not walls at all but boundaries between what was and what could be. As Mira watched, a corner of the room simply ceased existing, replaced by a sky that belonged to a Tuesday three years ago. This was the shifting, the grace that moved from place to place without warning or mercy. She had studied it extensively, mapped its patterns, learned that objects and people reappeared when needed elsewhere in the sanctuary, drawn by some fundamental law of conservation she couldn't quite name.
"The music box," Mira said, holding it out. "It stopped when the pin broke. But I remember the melody. Not in my mind—in my cells." She touched her forearm, feeling the pulse beneath skin that had been someone else's arm just yesterday. "When you held this as a child, your cellular memory merged with its mechanism. The music lives in you still."
Kael's form steadied briefly, curiosity momentarily overriding the bitterness that had become his architecture. "You sound certain."
"I'm a pacifist, Kael. I refuse to fight you, refuse to force you, refuse to raise my hand against the man you've become. But I will show you the truth, and I will do it through the only language your body still speaks." Mira pressed the cold metal of the box into his hands. "Play it. Not with your fingers—with your remembering."
He stared at the broken mechanism, at the cylinder where the pin should have engaged the teeth of the comb. The space where connection should have occurred gaped like a missing tooth. "It's broken."
"You are broken," Mira agreed gently. "And so was I, once. Before I learned that resentment is a cage we build ourselves, then forget we built."
The shifting intensified. A doorway became a window became a mirror. In its surface, Mira caught glimpses of their parents—not as they had died, frozen in the moment of loss that had birthed Kael's grievance, but as they had lived, joyful and flawed and human. The grace of memory, distributed equally, without preference.
Kael's hands trembled. "They favored you. You know this. Every decision, every choice—"
"Was made out of love, poorly expressed." Mira stepped closer, close enough to feel the cold radiating from his partially shifted form. "Their grace shifted, Kael. It always shifts. To you, then to me, then back again. I never resented you for the moments you received more. Did you resent me for mine?"
The question hung in the airless air. Around them, the sanctuary reorganized itself once more, and suddenly they stood in a garden that had been dead for a decade, roses blooming in impossible colors.
"Yes," Kael whispered. "For years. For always."
"And now the world shifts and redistributes itself, and you see how futile that resentment was? How it served no purpose, changed nothing, only poisoned the vessel that carried it?" Mira took his hands, wrapped his fingers around the music box. "The melody lives in your cellular memory, Kael. Every cell remembers joy if you let it. Release the resentment, and the pin will reappear when needed. It always does in this place."
Kael closed his eyes. The sanctuary held its breath—though it had no breath to hold—in collective anticipation.
The shifting slowed, then stopped. The garden solidified into permanence, roses anchoring themselves in soil that had been concrete moments before. In Kael's palm, where the cylinder pin had broken, something silver gleamed as grace settled, distributed at last, into two equal portions.
The music box played. [798]
