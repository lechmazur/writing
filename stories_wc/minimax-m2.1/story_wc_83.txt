The geode sits in my palm like a secret the earth kept too long. [12] Its exterior is rough gray stone, unremarkable, but I know what waits inside - the same way I know what waited for us that afternoon in the meadow, before the sky learned our names. [45] Seven hundred and twelve people attended my wedding. [60] Seventeen survived the strike. [78] I was one of them because I stepped away to urinate behind a copse of olive trees, a detail so mundane it humiliates the gravity of survival. [115] The geode belonged to my grandmother. [128] She gave it to me the morning of the ceremony, told me to keep it close, told me it contained a sleeping god. [161] I laughed and tucked it into my suit pocket. [175] The pocket burned in the explosion but the geode emerged untouched, its rough hide mottled with scorch marks that look almost intentional, like deliberate camouflage. [224] Scientists call what I'm doing "perturbation theory applied to existential crisis." [261] I call it the only way forward. [272] The floating observatory drifts at forty thousand feet, tethered to the ruins below by electromagnetic cables that hum with the patience of condemned things. [322] We came here to watch the circuit breakers cool, to monitor the gradual dissipation of heat from the strike zone's emergency shutdown systems, but I came here to think. [375] The geode feels intangibly tangible in my grip - present yet elusive, solid yet whispering of something beyond physics. [416] It exists in a category the wedding forced me to understand: things that were there and are not, things that were not there and are. [460] The other survivors hunt for meaning in conventional ways. [486] They start foundations, have children, write letters to newspapers that never publish them. [522] I hunt differently. [532] I hunt through perturbation theory, the mathematics of small changes rippling into impossible futures. [570] The morning of my wedding, I kissed my wife for the first time as her husband, and somewhere a drone operator pressed a button. [609] Two events, one second apart, connected by nothing except the universe's indifference. [643] But perturbation theory teaches that nothing disconnects - that every action perturbs every other, that the wedding and the strike existed in the same equation, that I am not a survivor but a node in a calculation I'm only beginning to read. [690] The geode's crystals catch the observatory's artificial light and scatter it into geometries that feel almost like answers. [732] I hold it up to the observation window and watch the ruins below sparkle with false hope. [768] Somewhere in that devastation, unused potential pools - futures that never activated, possibilities that aborted mid-sentence, lives that were calculations this universe chose not to complete. [818]] That's what I'm hunting. [824] Not closure, not meaning, not the false comfort of purpose. [852] I'm hunting the reservoirs of what-might-have-been, the pools of unused potential that collect in the margins of catastrophe, hoping to understand why some calculations resolve and others dissolve. [901] The circuit breakers cool below us, their red LED status lights fading to amber, and the geode grows warm in my palm as if responding to some frequency I cannot hear. [954] My wife used to say I overthought everything. [971] She was right. [977] She was also dead now, and I was alive, and the wedding had been beautiful before it became a before-and-after line, and the geode contained crystals that formed under pressure I cannot imagine, and somewhere in the mathematics of destruction, unused potential pooled like water in the craters of abandoned futures. [1039] This is bleak exhilaration: the understanding that I will never know, coupled with the certainty that the search matters. [1087] The sky outside the observatory's windows burns with the particular purple of a sun that set years ago, and the geode sits in my palm like a sleeping god finally waking, like the unfiltered awakening I could not avoid, like the hunt that will never end but must continue anyway, because what else is there to do with unused potential but hold it up to the light and watch it scatter into geometries that look, for just a moment, like answers.
