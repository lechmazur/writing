On the verdant parapet beside a waterfall, where mist rose like whispered prayers and the cascade's song filled the morning with liquid silver, Elara performed her sacred work as she had done for longer than mortal counting could track. The wise orchard pruner moved among the ancient trees whose branches twisted between what was and what might be, her shears gleaming with a light that seemed to come from somewhere else entirely. [125]
She had earned her title through decades of learning how to read the silence between leaves, how to hear the conversations that roots held with the deep places of the earth. Her hands knew the difference between a branch that needed freeing and one that served as a bridge for something traveling between the visible and the hidden. The orchard existed in that liminal space where worlds overlapped, and she had become its keeper through equal parts devotion and the kind of understanding that could not be taught, only gathered over seasons. [219]
The heirloom seed rested in her pocket, warm against her thigh as if it held a heartbeat of its own. She had carried it across the threshold from a realm where color had begun to fade from the sky, where wonder had thinned to nothing more than a memory of a memory. The seed had been saved by someone who understood its purpose—not merely to grow a tree, but to weave new threads of magic into the fabric of a world that desperately needed them. Elara had been insatiably creative in her methods, always seeking new ways to capture and preserve the essence of places that were slipping away. [346]
Her cuts were precise and purposeful, each one an offering of succor to the spaces between worlds that had grown tangled and weary. She cleared the deadwood that blocked the pathways, sang to the wounds in the bark, and let the waterfall's constant voice guide her hands. The parapet where she worked had been built by hands long turned to dust, and its stones were worn smooth by centuries of gardeners who had understood the same truth she did: that some gardens were not meant for fruit alone, but for holding open the doors between what was and what might be. [460]
She drew the seed from her pocket and held it in her palm, feeling its weight and warmth. This was not just a seed but a covenant, a promise made by those who had come before that wonder would not be permitted to die entirely from the realms. The light caught its surface and fractured into colors that had no names in any language she knew, and she smiled at the familiar shimmer. To preserve the color of wonder—this had been her purpose since she had first climbed the parapet as a young apprentice, and it remained her purpose now that her hair had gone white as waterfall foam. [579]
The soil waited in the stone alcove where she had prepared it, mixed with water from the cascade and with ash from a fire that had burned in a place where dragons had once dreamed. She nestled the seed into its resting place with the tenderness of a mother easing a child into sleep, and she understood that this act was more than planting. It was capturing essence and transforming it, taking the last shimmering memory of a fading world and giving it roots in a place where it could grow into something new. [693]
As she pressed the earth closed around her charge, the waterfall seemed to swell in its song, as if recognizing what was being offered. The hush of budding hope hung in the air around her, that particular quality of early spring when everything trembled with the possibility of becoming. She sat back on her heels and watched the parapet settle into its work, the stone and water and soil joining together to nurture what she had given them. [810]
The story should be 600-800 words. I have 810 words which is slightly over. Let me trim a bit from the end.

The hush of budding hope hung in the air around her, that particular quality of early spring when everything trembled with the possibility of becoming. She sat back on her heels and watched, knowing that what she had planted would not merely grow but would weave itself into the fabric of this world, carrying the essence of wonder to places that had forgotten its taste.
