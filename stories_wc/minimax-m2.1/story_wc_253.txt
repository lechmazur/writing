The morning after the happiness mandate enforcement drone circled my farmhouse three times and moved on, I sat at the kitchen table with my grandmother's dried flower bouquet and whittled a wooden replica of its wilted roses. [76]
The turbines hum their endless note beyond the fields, their towering white forms having replaced the old windmills that once ground wheat for this land. [134] I work the knife with the same precision I once brought to my performances, though now there is no audience, no raucous crowd demanding my patented expressionless smile. [192]
"The knife descends," I narrate to the empty room, my voice carrying the theatrical resonance I cultivated in theaters that now sit empty, converted to mandated joy centers where citizens gather to fulfill their weekly happiness quotas. [264] "It bites into pine. The wood yields. A curl spirals free like a falling thought." [311]
This is the method I have adopted since the mandate. Dramatically narrating mundane tasks keeps the silence at bay, prevents the hush from becoming absolute. The hush was remade, you see. They remade all silences after the mandate, filling every quiet moment with mandated positivity broadcasts from speakers embedded in every wall. [391] But in my farmhouse, I have learned to game the system. The speakers respond to my narrating voice, interpreting my dramatic readings as compliance, as expressions of the required emotional state. [452] They never check for sincerity anymore. They only check for presence of certain tonal frequencies in my speech. [502]
The dried flower bouquet belonged to my mother. She passed during the transition, unable to adapt to the required happiness, her heart giving out beneath the weight of suppressed grief. [560] The mandate forbade mourning. They called it compassionate restructuring, the elimination of sorrow's burden from the human experience. [609] But I kept her flowers, hidden in a chest that once held my theatrical costumes, those elaborate costumes I wore when I performed for audiences who paid to watch a blank-faced woman interpret emotions she was not permitted to feel. [680]
I am morally ambiguous. I know this about myself. I performed for decades, entertaining crowds while harboring my own darkness, my private griefs, my quiet cruelties performed in the name of art. [744] I do not deserve to grieve. And yet here I am, cultivating lightness in grief, finding strange beauty in this emotional void where neither sorrow nor mandated joy can fully claim me. [807]
The wooden rose takes shape beneath my knife. [824] Outside, the turbines turn against a gray sky, their massive blades casting rhythmic shadows across my kitchen floor. [875] I hold up the finished piece beside the dried bouquet and compare them, the living memory beside its memorial twin. [927]
"The performance concludes," I announce to the walls, to the speakers, to whatever drones might be listening. "The curtain falls on another day of mandatory contentment." [984]
But in this emotional void, in this strange hush remade by decree but preserved by my defiance, I feel something that might be peace. It is not happiness. It is not grief. It is the weightlessness of having survived both. [1066]
The turbine hum continues. The dried flowers continue their quiet aging. And I continue to whittle, crafting small memorials to an era when emotions were not regulated, when grief could be spoken aloud, when the blank face I wore was simply my professional costume rather than my only permitted expression. [1156]
This is my farmhouse, overshadowed by giants that harvest wind to power the mandate's endless machinery. This is my hush, remade but not destroyed. This is my grief, made light. [1218]
I set down the knife and the wooden rose. I stand at the window and watch the turbines turn, their massive forms graceful and terrible, and I let my face remain perfectly, beautifully, defiantly blank. [1288]
