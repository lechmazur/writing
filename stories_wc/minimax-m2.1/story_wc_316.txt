I returned to the floating rock dojo while history rewrites itself, seeking what remained of the person I had been before the ego death that nearly killed me. The stones beneath my feet hovered in a perpetual autumn twilight, their surfaces etched with the names of masters who had trained here across centuries of shifting time. I had been one of them, once—before I dissolved into everything and nothing, before I returned with my body intact but my capacity to feel scoured raw and hollow. [120]
The clone waited at the dojo's center, seated beneath the ancient maple whose leaves fell upward into forgotten seasons. They had given me legal custody of the duplicate as part of the settlement—that impossible arrangement where the original and the copy must learn to coexist while history continuously erases and rewrites itself around us. The clone had my memories, my skills, my face. But they had not experienced the death that had burned away everything I thought I was. They felt everything. I felt nothing. [250]
"You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence," the clone said, rising to face me. Their voice carried the warmth I remembered from before—the empathy, the fear, the hope. I had come here to slice through pretense, to find some path back to feeling, but I found only the mirror of who I used to be. "The courts granted you custody, but you do not want a child. You want to feel again." [360]
I pulled the blade from my sash—a ceremonial knife that had cut through ten thousand pretense shields during my years of training. Its edge could divide truth from lie, reality from illusion. I had used it to dismantle others' defenses, to expose the raw nerve beneath social performance. Now I needed it for something else entirely. [450]
"Vivify," I said, and the word hung in the air between us like a prayer or a curse. To bring to life. To animate the dead. I had spent eighteen months in emotional suspension, going through motions without meaning, touching surfaces without sensation. The clone represented everything I had lost—the capacity to love, to rage, to grieve, to wonder. Through complementary opposites, I had been taught, transformation occurs. Stillness and movement. Connection and separation. The death of ego and the birth of something truer. [570]
I moved forward, and the clone did not retreat. They had been trained by my teachers, filled with my knowledge, yet they possessed what I had sacrificed on that altar of dissolution. When the blade touched their chest, it did not cut flesh—it cut through the membrane between imitation and authenticity, between the copy who had lived my life and the original who had lost everything worth living for. [680]
The clone gasped, and so did I. For the first time since my ego death, I felt something—a thread of connection pulling through the numbness, raw and startling. The blade had not wounded but awakened, vivifying something dormant in both of us. They were not my duplicate anymore. They were my complement, the opposite half that made the whole. I had come to defeat emotional numbness, and I discovered it could only be defeated through the complementary opposite of connection—the willingness to let someone else exist, fully and separately, while I existed alongside them. [820]
We stood together on the floating rock as history finished rewriting itself around our new configuration. The ego death had been an ending, but it was also a beginning. The clone custody battle had been a battle with myself, and I had won by realizing we were never opponents. We were complementary opposites, two halves of a consciousness that had been forced to separate to understand what unity truly meant. [930]
I sheathed the blade that slices through pretense. The numbness remained, but it was no longer absolute—it had cracked, and through that crack, feeling could return. The floating rock dojo settled into a new era, one where history remembered us not as original and duplicate, but as something the universe had never attempted before: a consciousness that survived ego death by learning to feel through another.
