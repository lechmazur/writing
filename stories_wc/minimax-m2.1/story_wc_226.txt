<story>The pale spire in mist rose from the canyon like a finger pointing toward accusation, and Sera pressed her back against the cold bone of the tower, watching the mist curl between the other towers like breath held too long. [66] The towers of bone stood in their hundreds, white pillars carved by time and something else, their surfaces smooth as skin, their shadows long even at midday when the sun could not reach this deep place. [133] Endless echoes whispered her footsteps back to her, adding phantom companions to her lonely journey through the canyon of whispers. [186]
She was a defiant artist, though they had stopped calling her that when the word began to carry weight in the temple courts. [244] Now they called her something else—word-weaver, truth-shatterer, destroyer of careful lies—and each name carried its own price. [302] The price of forgiveness, she had learned, was always paid in advance. [345]
Sera pulled the charcoal from her pocket and began to write on the bone wall, her hand moving in the practiced rhythm of someone who had been punished for this very impulse and punished again for refusing to stop. [418] Her attribute of being innocently mischievous had never been a choice; it was simply how she moved through the world, finding the cracks in certainty and pressing gently until they became doorways. [488] The words she wrote were not spells, though the priests would claim otherwise. [536] They were simply true, and in this place of constructed silence, truth was the most dangerous art of all. [595]
She had arrived before the ritual, before the temple faithful would gather to perform their monthly ceremony of forgetting. [658] The ritual required silence, required the suppression of all unapproved truth, required each participant to offer up their most honest thoughts and watch them dissolved in the pale spire's light. [725] Sera had undergone the ritual twice before, and each time something essential had been taken from her—not by force, but by her own willing surrender in exchange for belonging. [799]
No more. [804]
She would not refract a single truth into many voices by shouting; that was the method of prophets and madmen, and both were easily silenced. [871] Instead, she would hold impromptu poetry sessions in the spaces between the bone towers, speaking her verses to whoever wandered close enough to hear. [934] The mist would carry her words, the echoes would multiply them, and by the time the ritual began, the canyon would be thick with truths the priests could not identify or un-speak. [1004]
A child appeared around the nearest tower, no more than eight years old, wearing the white robe of the temple novices. [1067] Sera recognized the look of stolen freedom, the same hunger that had driven her own childhood explorations. [1122] The child tilted her head, innocently mischievous in a way that needed no teaching, and asked, "What are you making?" [1187]
Sera smiled, though her heart hammered against her ribs like something wanting escape. [1241] "I'm not making," she said. [1258] "I'm un-making. There's a difference." [1285]
The child's forehead creased with the effort of understanding. [1317] "They say un-making is sin." [1343]
"They say a lot of things." [1361] Sera sank to her knees so she and the child were eye to eye, and in this position, she began to speak her first poem of the afternoon. [1429] The words were simple, almost too simple, about a bird that forgot it could fly and spent its life walking, and how it remembered. [1498] The child listened with the absolute attention that only children and the dying can give, and when Sera finished, the child's eyes were wet. [1567]
"That's about my mother," the child whispered. [1596]
Sera nodded, and the forged hush of the canyon seemed to lean in, curious. [1653] "All true stories are about everyone's mother," she said. [1701] "That's why they make us forget them." [1732]
More children appeared, drawn by the sound of verse in a place designed for silence. [1788] Sera taught them her poems, let them add their own words, watched the truths multiply as they passed from small mouth to small ear. [1856] The mist thickened, and the pale spire seemed to pulse with something that might have been anger or might have been recognition. [1921]
When the priests finally came, their faces set in the rigid lines of stolen authority, Sera stood surrounded by a chorus of children reciting her verses back to her. [1996] The price of forgiveness, she knew, was not something paid to others. [2052] It was the price of forgiving oneself for having stayed silent for so long. [2110]
The ritual could proceed now, but it would find nothing to dissolve. [2162] The truth had already been refracted into a hundred small voices, and no pale spire, no temple, no forged hush of enforced silence could call it back. [2231] Sera had paid her price, and she was finally, beautifully, free. [2287] </story>
