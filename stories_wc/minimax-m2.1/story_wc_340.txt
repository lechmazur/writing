Mira had served the Skyward Line for seven years, long enough to know the groans of the old airship, the moods of captains, and the particular silence that lived at the top of the Meridian Spire. [53]
The brass elevator groaned around her as it climbed, its ancient cables pulling them both toward the observation deck ten floors above. [110]
She held the captain's goggles in her hands—Jansen had forgotten them in the mess hall again, and Mira, ever the ascending servant of trivial duties, had volunteered to return them rather than leave them for the cabin boy. [178]
Through the frosted glass panels, sunlight fractured into a thousand fragments, scattering across the elevator walls in pale ribbons of color, and through scattered light the brass fittings seemed almost to glow with warmth. [252]
Mira was warmly inquisitive by nature, a trait that had gotten her into trouble more than once, but one she could not seem to shake, and so when her thumb caught on an unevenness in the left temple of the goggles, she did not simply dismiss it as wear. [351]
She pried open the hidden compartment with her fingernail, and there, nestled in the padding, was a diary no larger than her palm, its cover stamped with the insignia of an old continental airline that had ceased operations before Mira was born. [449]
The elevator shuddered as it passed the sixth floor, and Mira turned the small book over in her hands, wondering if she should simply close the compartment and pretend she had never found it. [530]
But the pages seemed to unfold beneath her touch of their own accord, as if the diary had been waiting for someone curious enough to discover its secrets, and she found herself reading before she could decide whether this was a violation of privacy or simply fate. [629]
The entries were encrypted at first—a series of symbols that meant nothing to her—but as the elevator climbed higher and the light grew stronger, streaming through the ice-etched windows in shifting patterns, the symbols began to rearrange themselves in her mind, and she realized the cipher was simple, almost childlike in its construction. [744]
The first legible passage spoke of loss, of a woman who had loved the clouds and then been taken by them, and the anguish in Jansen's handwriting was so raw that Mira almost put the diary aside. [828]
But the next entry, dated two years later, spoke of something else entirely—a daughter, hidden away at a school in the lowlands, a joy that he could not speak of openly because joy and command did not sit well together in the eyes of the Line's admiralty. [931]
Mira understood then what she was reading, not just a captain's private grief but his private hope, the joy he had clung to beneath the anguish of his wife's death, and she felt a strange tenderness toward this man whom she had known only as stern and silent. [1038]
The elevator groaned to a stop at the tenth floor, the chime sounding soft and final, and Mira carefully closed the diary and tucked it back into its hiding place, her hands steady despite the weight of what she now carried in her knowledge. [1130]
She would return the goggles to Jansen with nothing more than her usual brief nod, and perhaps in time, if the moment ever presented itself, she would let him know that she understood, that she had read his secret and kept it, that she too knew what it meant to seek out the joy beneath anguish. [1250]
The observation deck doors slid open, and the frozen splendor of the clouds spread out before her in endless white stretches, and Mira stepped into the light with the goggles pressed to her chest, feeling as though she had climbed not ten floors but something far greater, into the quiet space where a man had trusted his sorrow to leather and brass and the kindness of a servant who chose, out of all the duties she could have claimed, this one small errand of mercy.
