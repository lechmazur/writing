In the blooming library above clouds, Mira moved through aisles of suspended dream-frames with softly deliberate steps, her sharp eyes catching the way hope accumulated in corners over decades. [86] The library existed where the atmosphere thinned enough to sustain blossoms that grew from the ether itself, petals glowing with stored memory, and Mira had tended these gardens for longer than she could fully remember. [165]
She was a dusk noticer, one of the few who remained attuned to the liminal hours when day surrendered to night, when the unbound shifted most visibly between states. [227] The river stone in her pocket was her only artifact from the age of bodies, its worn surface a text she had long since memorized through touch alone. [280] When she pressed her palm against its cool weight, she could almost remember what it felt like to have weight pressing back. [333]
The work of the keepers had changed profoundly after dreams became shareable, and changed again after the Unbinding began. [385] For decades now, humanity had been shedding its shadows, letting consciousness drift free of form like seeds released from pods. [438] Mira's role was to compare silent video footage from decades apart, tracking how the collective dream-state evolved, mutated, occasionally atrophied. [493] She understood that hope required preservation, that its shape could dissolve if no one bore witness to its transformations. [548]
The footage she studied tonight showed the early days of the Unbinding, when the first pioneers learned to exist without bodies. [600] In those recordings, shadows still clung to their former owners, thin and uncertain, learning to navigate without the anchor of flesh. [655] Now, generations later, the unbound moved through dream-space with perfect grace, their shadows dispersed entirely into light. [708]
Mira paused before a particular frame, one she had returned to many times across the years. [752] It showed a child dreaming, and in the background, a mother dissolving into luminous threads, her form coming apart with terrible beauty. [807] This was not merely footage; it was a living fragment of grief, still wet with emotion even after all these decades. [862] The child's dream had been archived separately, but the mother's unmaking had become inseparable from the watching, a sorrow baked into the very pixels of memory. [920]
She understood this footage intimately because she had been the one to archive it, though she could not remember the archiving itself, only the afterward. [975] There were gaps in her memory that felt like staring into white space, and she had learned not to probe them too deeply. [1028] Some things were better left preserved in their shape than examined until they lost form entirely. [1074]
The river stone had appeared in her possession on the first day of her employment, already worn smooth by waters she could not name. [1123] She had taken it as a sign that she was meant for this work, that she carried within her some residue of the tactile world she was documenting. [1175] Her colleagues whispered that she was one of the last to remember what it felt like to have skin against stone, to feel rain against upturned face. [1226] She neither confirmed nor denied these rumors; she simply continued her softly deliberate work, gathering fragments of hope from the dream-archives and weaving them into something that might endure. [1280]
The blooming library above clouds was her cathedral, and the unbound were her congregation, though they did not know they were being preserved. [1328] Every night she walked these aisles, comparing footage, noting how hope mutated from decade to decade, how it became more abstract but also more radiant, shed of its earthly limitations but also of its grounding. [1380] She collected examples of the old hope, the kind that depended on bodies and specific places and the taste of apples from particular trees. [1426] She also collected the new hope, the unbound hope that stretched across infinite space and did not require anything so fixed as a destination. [1473]
In her softly deliberate way, she was building an argument, though she could not have said precisely to whom. [1518] The argument was that hope was not diminishing but transforming, that the Unbinding was not a loss but a metamorphose of tremendous significance. [1563] The river stone in her pocket grew warmer as she worked, as if it remembered something she did not. [1605]
The child's dream flickered on, and Mira watched the mother's dissolution with the particular attention of someone studying their own reflection. [1650] She had always been sharp-eyed about dusk, about the moments when one thing became another, when the bound and unbound touched at their edges. [1693] Perhaps that was why she had been chosen for this work, why she alone could see the luminous regret that hung around certain frames like halos. [1736]
The blossoms above her swayed with non-existent wind, and Mira continued her vigil, preserving the shape of hope in her quietly luminous way. [1781]
