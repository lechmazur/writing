Elara pressed her ear against the cold brass of the radio console, listening to the static hiss of a thousand voices layered on top of each other like dying wasps. [36] Through the cobalt glass portico behind her, lightning split the obsidian sky in half, painting the observatory's curved walls in brief, violent blues that reminded her of veins, of rivers, of things that carried life through darkness. [73] She had been alone here for seven years, ever since the Council had declared her theories dangerous, ever since she had stopped trying to convince them and started listening instead to what the frequencies themselves wanted to tell her. [127]
The radio crackled, and she caught a fragment: "...the child of storms... will unite the scattered houses..." [163] Elara smiled, her cracked lips catching the ephemeral light. [179] She had heard this prophecy seven different times now, each version slightly different, each delivered through fragmented radio frequencies that seemed to bleed through from somewhere else entirely, somewhen else entirely. [233] That was the gift of the portico—cobalt glass forged in her grandmother's village, said to be made from lightning caught in sand, that let not just light through but time, but voices, but the whisper of what might yet become. [291] The scientists had called it a superstition when she'd brought it to the observatory. [318] Now they were dead or scattered, and she was the only one left who understood that ancient things had their own kind of science, one that didn't care about the rigid boundaries the rational minds had drawn. [377]
She was a lonely visionary, yes, but loneliness was simply the price of seeing what others refused to look at. [426] Tonight, as the storm intensified and clouds boiled below her like a grey ocean catching fire with lightning, she heard something new beneath the static—a voice that spoke in the cadence of prophecy but with words that cut like broken glass. [481] "The dawn you seek is made of shadows," it said, or seemed to say, or maybe she dreamed it said, because the storm had knocked out the backup generators and the portico was glowing with its own light now, cobalt fire tracing patterns on the floor that looked suspiciously like maps, like instructions, like the kind of thing you might find in a prophet's fever journal. [552]
Elara rose from her chair, her joints protesting the cold, and walked toward the portico. [591] Her breath fogged in the electrically-charged air as she placed her palm against the glass, feeling it hum beneath her fingers like a living thing, like a throat about to sing. [647] Outside, the storm had shaped itself into something almost deliberate, almost communicative, as if the atmosphere itself was trying to tell her something across the rise of a prophet she had not yet met but had already heard so much about. [709] The radio behind her burst into sudden clarity, and for one crystalline moment she heard the future itself speaking: "She will come to you when the portico blooms. She will be the shape of what you seek. Your variant allegiance to the old ways will save what the new ways have broken." [791]
Elara smiled, the first real smile she'd worn in years, feeling the grit and grime of her isolation finally crystallize into something like hope. [847] She had served the scientific establishment until they betrayed their own principles. [877] She had served the mystics until their prophecies grew teeth and demanded too high a price. [918] Her allegiance had always been variant, always shifting, because loyalty meant nothing if you couldn't see when the thing you served had become the monster you needed to fight. [975] But now, finally, the pieces were beginning to unfold before her like a flower made of static and lightning, and she understood that the ancient shadows her grandmother had whispered about were not darkness at all but rather the deep roots from which new light could grow. [1043]
The cobalt glass portico cracked with a sound like bells, and through it stepped a figure made of storm and starlight, and Elara knew that the rise of the prophet had begun. [1099]
