The birch bark scroll unrolled across the pine table like a wounded animal surrendering its secrets. [13] I pressed my palm against its rough surface, feeling the crusted sap and the faint heartbeat beneath the bark—something between wood and memory, neither quite alive nor entirely dead. [57] Outside, the mountain ranger cabin held its silence like a prayer, and somewhere below, the valley had already forgotten my name. [95]
They found the grave three days ago, or three decades from now—I have stopped pretending I can tell the difference. [134] The lucid dreaming gave me that much, at least: the ability to recognize when I was dreaming, even if I could no longer distinguish which version of myself was doing the recognizing. [178] My colleagues used to call it a gift, back when I still had colleagues, back when we gathered in university basements to compare our chronicles and measure whose dreamscapes held the most coherence. [224] Now I understand what they never did—that lucidity is not a gift but a curse disguised as clarity, a lighthouse that illuminates only the rocks waiting to destroy you. [271]
The grave had my name carved in a stone I didn't recognize, surrounded by wildflowers that bloomed in colors that don't exist in waking light. [311] I stood there for what felt like hours, tracing the letters of my own epitaph, watching moss grow in fast-forward across the granite while birdsong rewound itself into silence. [355] Time moved like a drunk dancer at a wedding I'd attended before I was born, and I felt the feral nostalgia rising in my chest like something wild and caged—the desperate longing for a past that might never have been mine, that existed only in the spaces between what I remembered and what I had dreamed. [406]
I came here to distill chaos into narrative, the way my training taught me, the way I've done for forty years of sleepless mornings and ink-stained fingers. [449] But the words keep dissolving before I can catch them, rearranging themselves into meanings I never intended, forming sentences that describe things I haven't experienced yet or have already forgotten. [493] The scroll absorbs them anyway, drinking my chaos like thirsty earth after rain, and I wonder if this is what I've been preparing for all along—this final chronicle that will outlast whatever grave awaits me in the timeline I can't quite reach. [540]
Last night I dreamed I was soaring above this very cabin, my body translucent and light as smoke, watching myself through the frost-covered window as I hunched over the scroll like a penitente counting sins. [581] I felt such jealousy then—such bitter, corrosive jealousy—as I watched the younger version of myself who still believed that dreams could be organized, that memories could be trusted, that death was something that happened to other people. [626] That man at the table had hope still pooled in his eyes like rainwater in summer puddles, and I wanted to reach through the glass and shake him, warn him that the grave was already being carved, that the chronologist's disease was already nesting in his blood. [671]
The jaded wonder never leaves me now—this exhausted awe at the machinery of consciousness and its endless capacity for cruelty and beauty in equal measure. [713] I have seen too much to believe in anything completely, and yet I have seen too much not to marvel at the intricate horror of it all, the way dreams fold into waking and waking folds into death and death folds back into dreaming in an endless Möbius strip of recursive meaning. [762]
The scroll is almost full now, covered in my cramped handwriting and the tears I didn't realize I was shedding. [792] Tomorrow I will climb down the mountain and mail this to an address I haven't invented yet, sending my chronicle to a future self who might finally understand what I've been trying to say—that the grave was never an ending, just a waystation, just another dream within the dream, just another story waiting to be chronicled by someone who has finally stopped being jealous of who they used to be. [847]
But that is tomorrow. Tonight, I will sleep, and I will soar, and I will let the feral nostalgia take me wherever it wants, because I have learned that fighting the current only tires you for the drowning that comes after. [892] The mountain holds its breath. The cabin exhales its shadows. And somewhere in the distance, a bird sings a song I've heard before I was born and will hear again after I'm gone. [936]
This is my chronicle. This is my chaos, finally distilled. [957]
This is my grave, learning to speak. [972]
