After the last forest burns, the world learns to make light differently. [33]
Mira was a dreamless freight guard, which meant she carried things that couldn't be carried by ordinary means and slept a sleep that left no residue in the morning. [77]
The cargo this cycle was a chess clock frozen at midnight, its hands suspended between one move and the next, between one world and another. [121]
She walked across the glowing dune in bloom—the bioluminescent moss that had learned to grow where the trees had failed, casting pale blue phosphorescence across the ash-gray sand like scattered memories of a sea that had evaporated three centuries before. [164]
Behind her, the divergent archive hummed in the cart she pulled, its pages ever-changing, its ink written in possibilities that had never collapsed into certainty. [201]
The archive contained everything that had been and everything that might have been, which made it heavy in ways that scales couldn't measure. [243]
She had been occasionally everywhere in her route—across the glass plains that had once been oceans, through the iron ruins of cities that had learned to burn their own dead for warmth, across the fungal forests that grew in the skeletons of apartment buildings. [292]
But this route was different. This cargo was different. The charm she had been taught to work wasn't the old kind, wasn't the whispered words and祈愿 the way her grandmother had practiced. [328]
This charm worked through wave functions. [336]
You couldn't make something happen by asking. You had to suggest probability, to smile at uncertainty until it relaxed into something you could use. [365]
The wheel of the cart hit a root beneath the sand and jolted. Mira paused, checked the cargo, and saw that the chess clock still read midnight, still held its breath at the threshold of a move that might never come. [404]
The merchant found her at the third hour, materializing from a fold in the landscape where the light bent wrong. [438]
His cart was full of things that had been and things that might be, and his eyes were the color of burned paper. [465]
"There are those who would pay for that clock," he said, his voice like wind through the remains of flute. [491]
Mira's hand found her staff. "There are those who would pay for the archive too. They aren't getting either." [518]
The merchant smiled, and it was the kind of smile that had seen too many forests die. [542]
"After the last forest burns," he said, quoting the old phrase, the one children used to sing before they learned that singing required breath worth wasting, "what grows in the unlit corners?" [575]
Mira looked at the glowing moss beneath her feet, at the pale blue light that had colonized the darkness when everything else had failed. [602]
"Sparks," she said. "I cultivate the sparks." [617]
The merchant's smile fractured, became something almost like grief. "Do you know what time the clock remembers? That frozen moment?" [655]
She did. The divergent archive had shown her. The clock had been stopped at midnight on the day the final forest caught fire, the moment when the world had tipped from might-be to was. [694]
"Hope," she said, "looks like a pause." [706]
The merchant nodded slowly, understanding passing between them like a wave function collapsing into kindness. [737]
He touched the brim of his hat—a gesture as old as the road itself—and stepped backward into a fold of light, disappearing the way old things disappear, slowly and all at once. [775]
Mira continued walking, her cargo behind her, her purpose ahead of her. [794]
The glowing dune in bloom spread around her like a broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself, note by phosphorescent note. [826]
