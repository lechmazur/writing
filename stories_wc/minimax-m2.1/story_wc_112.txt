<story> The research station floated three kilometers above Veridian IV's methane seas, suspended between cloud layers that never fully settled. Kira adjusted her wrench belt and listened to the distant hum of the magnetic nexus warming in its moorings—she could feel the vibration through her mechanically warm fingertips, the same way she'd felt every sky-vessel she'd ever serviced in her twenty years as an obliging sky mechanic. The twilight shift was beginning, and with it came the subdued awakenings she had spent three patient years documenting.
She approached the containment bay where the velith-wing specimens hung in their resting harnesses, their iridescent membranes folding and unfolding in slow cycles that matched the station's own breathing rhythms. These creatures existed in temporal resonance with their homeworld's strange magnetic field, and Kira had formed a working hypothesis that required her to prove time moves sideways rather than forward through their chrysalis cycles. The holographic display array flickered to life at her touch, casting prismatic blueprints across the bay's curved walls.
"The nexus is at 72% capacity," announced ARIA, the station's intelligence system, its voice carrying the particular chill of recycled atmosphere. "Twilight convergence in seventeen minutes."
Kira nodded and moved toward the central lever that controlled the magnetic nexus's alignment matrix. This wasn't simply a matter of activating machinery—it was about creating the precise conditions under which the velith-wings' metamorphosis could be observed across temporal vectors simultaneously. She had designed the lever system herself, a hybrid mechanism that combined tactile engineering with holographic feedback loops, allowing her to feel the quantum states she was manipulating.
The winged creatures began their slow revival as the amber light of twilight filtered through the station's observation panes. Their awakening was subdued, gradual, each membrane unfurling like the pages of a book being read in slow motion. Kira had learned to read their patterns the way other mechanics read instrument panels—if time truly moved sideways, these beings would demonstrate it through their metamorphic phases, existing briefly in states that shouldn't logically coexist.
She gripped the lever, its surface worn smooth by years of obliging service to researchers who needed their experiments calibrated just so. The magnetic nexus sang louder now, its twilight activation reaching the critical threshold. Through holographic principles she had spent months mastering, Kira projected temporal mapping grids across the bay, converting the creatures' subtle movements into visible mathematics.
The first velith-wing lifted its primary membrane, and Kira observed something remarkable: the creature existed simultaneously in two molt phases, its wings both adolescent and mature, flickering between states like a holo-image struggling to resolve. Her breath caught in the icy research air, the station's climate control maintaining the cold temperatures the specimens required even as her own body ran mechanically warm from exertion and excitement.
"ARIA, are you recording temporal bleed?"
"Confirmed. Unprecedented readings across all vectors. You were correct, Kira. Time does move sideways for these creatures."
She pulled the lever further, feeling the resistance shift as the nexus responded to her commands. The holographic displays intensified, showing temporal pathways branching in directions that would have seemed impossible to her training manuals. The subdued awakenings of the velith-wings became a cascade of simultaneous existences, each moment containing fragments of what had been and what would be.
Kira thought of all the sky vessels she had repaired in her career, how she had always obliged their pilots with quick and careful work. This felt different—this was proving something fundamental about the universe's architecture, using creatures that flew through skies she would never touch and machinery that operated on principles she was only beginning to understand.
The twilight deepened outside, and the magnetic nexus reached full power. Through the observation glass, Kira watched her subjects exist in beautiful, impossible multiplicity, their wings beating in a hush that seemed to hold the entire research station suspended between moments. She had proved it: time moved sideways, just as she had theorized, and these mechanically warm beings—herself and the creatures alike—were witnesses to a truth that would reshape xenobiological research forever.
The lever clicked into its final position, and the holographic principles displayed their final confirmation. Time had revealed its sideways nature, and an obliging sky mechanic from a forgotten orbital dock had become the first to document it in the hush of beating wings at rest. [790]</story>
