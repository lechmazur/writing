The underwater welder, Finn, a man patiently impatient for a power he barely understood, found himself at the crossing.<words>16</words>  It was where two timelines, like fractured ribs of the cosmos, should never have met, a broken planetarium reimagined as a pulsing nightclub.<words>34</words>  The air thrummed with a dissonant symphony of bass and crumbling plaster, a fitting soundtrack to the unraveling he felt in his bones.<words>51</words>  Finnâ€™s motivation, inherited like a cryptic family heirloom, was to wield this improbable power, a force whispered about in hushed tones by his ancestors.<words>71</words>  He felt it now, a tingling at his fingertips, a phantom pressure in his ears, like the deep sea calling.<words>85</words>

He caught glimpses of himself in the vintage store mirrors lining the club's walls, distorted reflections in tarnished silver.<words>101</words>  Each glimpse was a snapshot of a different Finn, a different possible outcome, a different unraveling.<words>112</words>  In one, he saw himself, triumphant, bathed in an ethereal glow.<words>119</words>  In another, he was consumed by shadows, a puppet of the very power he sought.<words>129</words>  The inherited mystery of his lineage weighed heavily on him, a cloak woven with equal parts wonder and dread.<words>142</words>

He needed to ground himself, to pamper his frayed nerves before they snapped entirely.<words>150</words>  He found a quiet corner, a forgotten alcove where a vintage button box sat perched on a velvet cushion.<words>161</words>  Its brass hinges gleamed faintly in the strobe lights, a beacon of tangible reality in this swirling vortex of possibilities.<words>174</words>  He opened it, the click a sharp counterpoint to the throbbing music.<words>180</words>  Inside, nestled amongst mother-of-pearl and bone, lay a kaleidoscope of buttons, each a tiny universe of its own.<words>192</words>  He ran his fingers over their smooth surfaces, the cool touch a balm to his anxiety.<words>200</words>

Each button, he realized, represented a moment, a choice, a thread in the tapestry of his unraveling.<words>210</words>  He picked one up, a small, iridescent shell button, and held it tight.<words>218</words>  It was a tangible anchor in a sea of uncertainty, a reminder of the simple, tactile world he was so desperately trying to hold onto.<words>234</words>  The club pulsed around him, the timelines continued their perilous dance, but for a moment, Finn found a fragile peace in the quiet weight of the button.<words>251</words>  He was patiently impatient, waiting for the moment to seize his destiny, but for now, he would pamper himself with the small comfort of the button box, a tiny island of order in the chaos of the unraveling.<words>279</words>
