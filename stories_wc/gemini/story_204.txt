The hush before the Galactic Cuddling Awards acceptance speech descended, a thick silence punctuated only by the rhythmic decay of the abandoned spaceport hangar around her. <words>18</words> Rust gnawed at the metal girders, a slow, inexorable action eating away at the grandeur of a bygone era. <words>30</words>  Elara, professional cuddler extraordinaire, clutched her phantom train ticket punch, an unusually usual good luck charm in her profession. <words>41</words>  Its presence was a comforting weight against the ancient novelty of the setting, a place where the ghosts of roaring rockets seemed to mingle with the dust motes dancing in the dim light. <words>60</words>

She’d acquired the punch during a chance encounter at a farmer's market, a transaction governed by unspoken rules of barter and whispered histories. <words>74</words> The old woman who’d traded it for a hug had simply smiled, a knowing glint in her eye, and Elara had instinctively understood its significance. <words>89</words>  It represented a connection to a past she’d never known, a time when physical touch wasn't mediated by contracts and certifications. <words>105</words>

Elara’s nomination itself was a testament to her dedication to breaking down barriers. <words>113</words>  She’d faced prejudice, whispers about the “unnaturalness” of professional cuddling, the unspoken rule that touch should be reserved for family and lovers. <words>129</words>  But she’d persevered, driven by a deep-seated need to prove that platonic touch could be a powerful force for healing and connection. <words>144</words>

The hangar, a monument to forgotten journeys, mirrored her own internal landscape. <words>152</words>  She’d built walls around her own heart, fearing vulnerability, adhering to the unspoken rules of emotional distance. <words>163</words>  But through her work, she’d begun to dismantle those barriers, brick by decaying brick. <words>171</words>

The phantom punch, a tangible link to a more tactile past, reminded her of the power of simple human connection. <words>182</words>  It was unusually usual, a paradox that perfectly encapsulated her journey. <words>189</words>  She was a professional cuddler in a galaxy where touch was both commonplace and taboo, navigating the unspoken rules of intimacy in a decaying world yearning for genuine connection. <words>209</words>

The announcer’s voice boomed through the hangar, shattering the hush. <words>215</words> Elara took a deep breath, the metallic tang of decay filling her lungs. <words>222</words>  She clutched the phantom punch, its cold metal a grounding presence against the surge of anticipation. <words>232</words>  This was her moment. <words>234</words>  A chance to show the galaxy that touch, in all its forms, was not something to be feared, but celebrated. <words>247</words>  She was ready to break the unspoken rules, to embrace the ancient novelty of human connection, and to let her own heart, like the decaying hangar, be transformed by the gentle, persistent force of love. <words>272</words>
