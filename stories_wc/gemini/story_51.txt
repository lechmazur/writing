The apologetic thug, Brick, gripped the plain wooden crate slat like a lifeline. <words>12</words>
He stood in the static electricity garden, the air thick with the ozone scent of impending storms and regret. <words>23</words>
He’d chosen this bizarre meeting place, amidst crackling Tesla coils and humming Van de Graaff generators, because it mirrored the chaotic energy within him. <words>37</words>
He needed to break free from the shadow of his past, the weight of his mistakes pressing down like a physical burden. <words>50</words>
His method, rationally subjective as it was, involved staging “accidental” meetings with Dr. Aris Thorne, a renowned philosopher specializing in resilience. <words>64</words>
In the second a new silhouette appeared on the horizon, Brick knew it was her. <words>73</words>
He’d meticulously studied her museum visit schedule, crafting elaborate coincidences that placed them in the same exhibit halls, the same crowded cafes. <words>88</words>
He’d even memorized her preferred tea order: Earl Grey, no sugar. <words>94</words>
This time, he planned to outlast his own crippling self-doubt, to finally speak to her, to learn the true meaning of resilience from the source. <words>109</words>
The crate slat, salvaged from a demolished building that once housed his gang, represented the foundation of his old life. <words>121</words>
He planned to leave it here, a symbolic shedding of his past. <words>127</words>
Dr. Thorne approached, her gaze drawn to the sparking displays. <words>133</words>
Brick’s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the quiet intensity of the garden. <words>142</words>
He cleared his throat, the sound amplified by the charged air. <words>148</words>
“Excuse me, Dr. Thorne?” he began, his voice a low rumble. <words>154</words>
“I… I believe I’ve seen you here before.” <words>159</words>
He offered a hesitant smile, a stark contrast to the tattoos snaking up his arms. <words>166</words>
“I’m… I’m a big fan of your work.” <words>171</words>
He felt a flicker of his old bravado, the instinct to intimidate, but he pushed it down. <words>180</words>
This wasn’t about fear; it was about hope. <words>185</words>
He needed to outlast the ghost of the man he used to be. <words>192</words>
He needed to learn how to rebuild, how to find strength in the ruins. <words>200</words>
He needed to understand how to truly break free. <words>206</words>
Dr. Thorne, her eyes sharp and perceptive, regarded him with a mixture of curiosity and caution. <words>216</words>
“Indeed?” she replied, her voice calm and measured. <words>221</words>
“Perhaps we could discuss my work over tea?” <words>227</words>
Brick’s grip tightened on the crate slat, the rough wood a reminder of the path he was leaving behind. <words>238</words>
He took a deep breath, the charged air filling his lungs with a strange sense of possibility. <words>248</words>
He nodded, a small, almost imperceptible movement, but it was enough. <words>255</words>
He was starting. <words>257</words>
He was outlasting. <words>259</words>
He was breaking free. <words>262</words>
He gently placed the slat on a nearby bench, a silent farewell to the past. <words>272</words>
"I'd like that very much," he said, a genuine smile finally breaking through. <words>280</words>
