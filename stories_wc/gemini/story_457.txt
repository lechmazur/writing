Bartholomew, an urban hermit with a side hustle selling nebula-themed socks on the observation deck, stared at the swirling cosmic dust. <words>20</words>
Across the hush of unspoken promises, he felt the weight of conformity pressing down like a broken zipper pull on a spacesuit – useless, yet persistently irritating. <words>38</words>
His motivation was simple: to forge new paths, to break free from the pre-ordained trajectory of cubicle drone to retirement home bingo champion. <words>54</words>
His method was, admittedly, a bit unorthodox: propagating dissent through analyzing contradictions in local folklore. <words>65</words>
He’d noticed a peculiar discrepancy in the tales of the Great Nebula Gobblers, specifically regarding their preferred method of consuming celestial bodies – inhalation versus mastication. <words>84</words>
This, he believed, held the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of societal structures and their inherent flaws. <words>94</words>
He printed pamphlets, impersonally personal in their tone, detailing his findings with absurd solemnity. <words>103</words>
“Citizen,” one pamphlet began, “have you ever considered the existential implications of a nebula being *chewed*? <words>113</words>
The very fabric of our reality rests upon the assumption of *inhalation*.” <words>120</words>
He left stacks of these pamphlets on the observation deck’s benches, tucked between discarded star charts and empty thermoses. <words>132</words>
He imagined the tourists, their faces illuminated by the ethereal glow of distant galaxies, grappling with the Gobblers’ dietary habits. <words>144</words>
He pictured them questioning the accepted narratives, the unspoken promises, the very nature of their existence. <words>154</words>
He saw them, in his mind’s eye, discarding their pre-packaged nebula tours and venturing out into the unknown, inspired by the absurdity of it all. <words>170</words>
Bartholomew adjusted his nebula-themed socks, a small act of rebellion in itself. <words>177</words>
He was a quiet revolutionary, a hermit in the heart of the city, propagating his peculiar brand of liberation one pamphlet at a time. <words>192</words>
The broken zipper pull on his jacket jingled softly, a constant reminder of the broken systems he sought to dismantle. <words>204</words>
He looked out at the nebula, a vast expanse of possibility, and smiled. <words>210</words>
His socks, he noted with satisfaction, were selling rather well. <words>216</words>
Perhaps, he mused, the path to liberation was paved not with grand pronouncements, but with the quiet absurdity of questioning a Gobblers’ lunch. <words>232</words>
The nebula, in its silent grandeur, seemed to agree. <words>237</words>
Bartholomew continued his work, a solitary figure against the backdrop of cosmic wonder, propagating his message across the hush of unspoken promises, one absurdly solemn pamphlet at a time. <words>261</words>
He was, after all, an urban hermit with a side hustle, and he had nebula-themed socks to sell. <words>272</words>
