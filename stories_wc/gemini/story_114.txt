The apathetic summoner, enthusiastically lazy, stretched out on the worn leather couch of the shared dream recording studio. <words>14</words>
After the last breath of a dying god, the world felt strangely muted, like a song played on broken instruments. <words>28</words>
He idly spun the handle of a rustic coffee grinder, the rhythmic grinding a counterpoint to the silence. <words>38</words>
His motivation, to rebuild the coral reefs bleached white by the god's passing, felt distant and abstract, like a half-remembered dream. <words>52</words>
He sighed, a sound sharp with the gentle frustration of knowing he *should* care, but not quite feeling it. <words>63</words>
He needed the river wisdom, the ancient knowledge whispered by the currents of creation. <words>71</words>
But how to access it in this desolate, post-apocalyptic world? <words>78</words>
He rose, a monumental effort for one so enthusiastically devoted to inertia. <words>85</words>
He shuffled down a long, deserted hall, lined with empty frames. <words>91</words>
Each frame, he knew, held a fragment of a shared dream, a sliver of collective consciousness. <words>101</words>
He began to unfold the river wisdom through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall. <words>110</words>
He took the coffee grinder, its rough wood warm against his palm, and placed it in the first frame. <words>120</words>
The frame shimmered, then filled with the image of a swirling nebula, a cosmic coffee grinder churning out stars. <words>131</words>
He found another frame and placed a dried sprig of coral, salvaged from a dead reef, within its empty space. <words>142</words>
This frame filled with the image of a vibrant reef teeming with life, the coral pulsating with a gentle, bioluminescent light. <words>155</words>
He continued, matching frames, each object evoking a corresponding dream fragment. <words>162</words>
A smooth, grey stone became a riverbed, polished by the flow of time. <words>170</words>
A single, iridescent fish scale transformed into a school of shimmering fish, weaving through the resurrected coral. <words>182</words>
With each matched frame, the river wisdom began to unfold, its gentle sharpness cutting through his apathy. <words>192</words>
The disparate images coalesced, forming a narrative, a blueprint for reef restoration. <words>200</words>
The nebula’s stardust became the building blocks of new coral. <words>206</words>
The river’s flow carried nutrients to the nascent reef. <words>211</words>
The fish, guided by the wisdom of the river, brought life and energy to the once-barren landscape. <words>223</words>
The apathetic summoner, no longer quite so apathetic, felt a flicker of something akin to hope. <words>233</words>
The gentle sharpness of the river wisdom had pierced his indifference, revealing the possibility of renewal. <words>245</words>
He understood now. <words>247</words>
The reefs could be rebuilt, not through grand gestures, but through small, deliberate actions, like matching frames in a deserted hall. <words>261</words>
He smiled, a genuine smile, the first since the god's last breath. <words>268</words>
The coffee grinder, now imbued with the river’s wisdom, felt warm and vibrant in his hand. <words>278</words>
He knew what he had to do. <words>281</words>
