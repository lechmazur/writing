The irate smuggler, Baruk, pounded the abandoned spaceport’s flight deck, his breath ragged plumes in the frigid air. <words>16</words>
He wasn’t supposed to be jogging, not here, not now, but his heart, that traitorous organ, had staged a full-blown revolt. <words>30</words>
It demanded more than the stale, recycled air of his smuggling freighter, more than the abstractly physical weight of his guilt. <words>44</words>
It craved the rumored hidden waterfalls, whispered about in hushed tones among the port’s derelict denizens. <words>55</words>
Baruk spat, the icy wind whipping the saliva into a fleeting, crystalline sculpture. <words>62</words>
He needed a sign, a clue, something to memorialize this absurd quest, this internal uprising. <words>72</words>
He stopped, his gaze falling upon a single chopstick, improbably nestled amidst the cracked ferrocrete. <words>81</words>
He picked it up, its smooth surface a stark contrast to the rough texture of the flight deck. <words>90</words>
He’d seen the old spacers use them, stirring their strange, earthy teas, divining meaning in the swirling leaves. <words>101</words>
Baruk scoffed, but a flicker of desperate hope ignited within him. <words>107</words>
He fished a crumpled packet of the same tea from his pocket, a relic from a forgotten trade. <words>117</words>
He brewed a hasty cup using the ship’s emergency water recycler, the lukewarm liquid a biting mockery of the cascading waterfalls he sought. <words>131</words>
He stirred with the chopstick, the tea leaves swirling in a chaotic dance. <words>138</words>
He poured the dregs onto the cracked ferrocrete, the leaves settling into a pattern as abstractly physical as the ache in his chest. <words>150</words>
He studied the pattern, searching for meaning, for direction, for any hint of the hidden waterfalls. <words>160</words>
It looked like… nothing. <words>162</words>
Just a random scattering of damp leaves. <words>166</words>
Baruk’s biting sincerity curdled into bitter frustration. <words>171</words>
He hurled the chopstick across the flight deck, its clatter echoing through the abandoned spaceport. <words>180</words>
His heart, however, continued its relentless, abstractly physical revolt, a dull, persistent thrum against his ribs. <words>192</words>
He knew, with a sinking certainty, that he wouldn’t find peace in the stale air of the spaceport. <words>203</words>
He had to find those waterfalls, not just for the escape they promised, but to memorialize this moment, this revolt, this absurd, desperate hope. <words>220</words>
The tea leaves, meaningless as they seemed, had etched themselves onto the cracked ferrocrete, a testament to his heart’s rebellion. <words>234</words>
He resumed his jog, the biting wind a physical manifestation of his resolve. <words>242</words>
He would find those waterfalls, even if it meant scouring every inch of this abandoned spaceport. <words>252</words>
He would find them, not just for the water, but for the abstractly physical proof that his heart, despite its captivity, could still dream. <words>270</words>
He would find them, and in doing so, he would memorialize the revolt that had begun on this cold, desolate flight deck, with a single chopstick and a cup of lukewarm tea. <words>291</words>
