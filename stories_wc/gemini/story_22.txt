Elara, the small-town librarian, adjusted her spectacles, a mocking smile playing on her lips as she surveyed the portal-strewn canyon. <words>14</words>
Riddled with ancient carvings, it whispered stories of generations of silent watchers, their vigilance a perfectly flawed tapestry woven through time. <words>29</words>
Elara’s motivation wasn’t knowledge, oh no, it was far grander: to become a legend whispered through those very carvings. <words>41</words>
Her fingers traced the stolen museum artifact tag tucked in her pocket, a trophy from a far less impressive heist. <words>53</words>
This canyon, however, held the key to true legendary status: the harvesting of grace. <words>61</words>
The tag, a seemingly insignificant piece of plastic, was actually a focusing lens, crucial to dismantling the protective wards around the grace nodes. <words>76</words>
Through generations, the watchers had guarded these nodes, their power sustained by a shared love for a particular type of food: sun-dried tomatoes. <words>90</words>
Elara, with mocking sincerity, had spent years cultivating a relationship with the current watcher, old Bartholomew, bonding over their “mutual” adoration of the leathery, crimson fruit. <words>107</words>
She’d even baked him a sun-dried tomato and rosemary focaccia, a culinary abomination that Bartholomew, bless his simple heart, had declared “divine.” <words>122</words>
With Bartholomew suitably distracted, Elara began her work. <words>127</words>
The canyon air crackled as she positioned the tag, its plastic surface refracting the moonlight onto the nearest grace node. <words>140</words>
The carvings seemed to writhe, the silent watchers’ disapproval radiating outwards. <words>147</words>
“Such a shame, Bartholomew,” Elara murmured, her voice dripping with false sympathy, “but legends aren’t built on shared snacks.” <words>159</words>
The node pulsed, its light dimming as the grace flowed into the tag, now humming with stolen power. <words>169</words>
Elara repeated the process, dismantling each node with practiced efficiency, the canyon’s whispers turning from watchful reverence to horrified awe. <words>183</words>
Bartholomew, blissfully unaware, emerged from his hut, a half-eaten focaccia in hand. <words>191</words>
“Another slice, Elara?” he offered, his voice thick with sun-dried tomato-induced joy. <words>199</words>
Elara, now radiating a faint, stolen grace, gave him a perfectly flawed smile. <words>206</words>
“Perhaps later, Bartholomew,” she purred, her voice echoing through the newly silent canyon. <words>214</words>
“I have a legend to build.” <words>217</words>
She stepped through a shimmering portal, the stolen artifact tag tucked safely away, leaving Bartholomew and the legacy of the silent watchers crumbling in her wake. <words>234</words>
The canyon, once vibrant with protective energy, now lay dormant, a testament to Elara’s mocking sincerity and her perfectly flawed ambition. <words>248</words>
Generations of silent watchers, undone by a shared love for sun-dried tomatoes and a librarian’s thirst for legendary status. <words>260</words>
The whispers, once a chorus of vigilance, now carried only Elara’s name, a mocking echo through time. <words>270</words>
