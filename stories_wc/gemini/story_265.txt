Deputy Hayes, his face a personally impersonal mask, stood in the lush orchard spanning the rafters of the abandoned cathedral. <words>16</words> During oil changes, he often came here, drawn by the uncharted echoes that whispered through the crumbling stone and the rustling leaves of the apple trees. <words>34</words> He stretched, a slow, deliberate movement, performed with the secret language of bees â€“ a subtle shift of weight, a tilt of the head, a minute flexing of fingers. <words>53</words>  He wasn't mimicking their dance, but rather, interpreting their hum into a physical form, hoping to attract something, something beyond the mundane. <words>68</words> His motivation was simple: to witness a moment of pure grace. <words>73</words>  He carried a twisted twist tie in his pocket, a seemingly insignificant object, yet it felt charged with a strange energy, resonating with the whispers of the cathedral. <words>91</words> The air hung heavy with the scent of ripe apples and the faint metallic tang of motor oil, a peculiar blend that somehow fit the strange sanctity of the place. <words>107</words>  He felt a cautious bravery rising within him, a quiet defiance against the unknown. <words>115</words> The echoes seemed to intensify, swirling around him like the wind rustling through the orchard. <words>124</words> He stretched again, his movements more fluid now, his body attuned to the rhythm of the unseen. <words>133</words> He felt a pull, a gentle tug towards a specific point in the orchard, a place where the sunlight filtered through the broken stained-glass windows, painting the leaves in vibrant hues. <words>152</words>  He moved towards it, his impassive face betraying no hint of the anticipation building within him. <words>160</words>  He reached the spot, the twisted twist tie warm in his pocket. <words>167</words> The echoes reached a crescendo, then abruptly ceased. <words>172</words> A single apple, perfectly ripe and red, detached itself from a branch and began to fall. <words>181</words>  Time seemed to slow. <words>183</words>  Hayes watched, his breath held, as the apple descended, a perfect sphere against the backdrop of the decaying cathedral. <words>194</words> It landed on a moss-covered stone, without a sound, without a bruise. <words>200</words>  It simply rested there, a moment of pure, unadulterated grace. <words>206</words> Hayes exhaled, a slow, steady release of tension. <words>210</words> He didn't move, didn't speak. <words>213</words> He simply witnessed. <words>215</words>  The moment passed, the echoes returned, softer now, almost a whisper. <words>222</words> Hayes reached into his pocket and took out the twisted twist tie, turning it over in his fingers. <words>232</words>  It felt lighter, somehow. <words>234</words> He placed it on the stone beside the apple, a small offering, a silent acknowledgement of the unseen. <words>245</words> He stretched one last time, a gesture of gratitude, and then turned to leave, the uncharted echoes fading behind him. <words>258</words> The oil in his patrol car needed changing. <words>262</words> He had witnessed grace, and that was enough. <words>266</words>  He returned to his personally impersonal duties, the memory of the falling apple a quiet flame burning within him. <words>279</words>
