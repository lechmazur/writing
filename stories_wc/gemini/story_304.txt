The lurking assassin adjusted the paint-splattered camera lens, its warped glass mirroring the baroque asteroid's opulent, yet decaying architecture. <words>16</words>
He perched on a gargoyle, overlooking the unforgiving road that snaked across the asteroid's surface. <words>25</words>
When the bus driver completed the final route, a hush fell over the normally bustling spaceport. <words>34</words>
The assassin's motivation, to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, seemed superficially profound, a borrowed starlight sentiment gleaned from a holo-drama. <words>48</words>
But it fueled him nonetheless. <words>50</words>
He needed the perfect shot, the perfect angle to capture the first rays of the rising sun. <words>60</words>
He laughed, a short, sharp sound that echoed strangely in the vacuum-sealed city. <words>67</words>
His target, a corrupt space-baron, would be arriving soon. <words>73</words>
The assassin had studied his movements for weeks, charting them via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, each glistening strand a predictable path. <words>88</words>
The web, spun across a grimy viewport, had revealed the baron's routine with chilling accuracy. <words>97</words>
The baron's shuttle shimmered into view, its landing gear extending with a hiss of hydraulics. <words>105</words>
The assassin focused the camera, the smeared paint creating a bizarre, almost artistic distortion. <words>114</words>
He wasn't here to kill. <words>117</words>
Not tonight. <words>119</words>
Tonight, he was an artist, a chronicler of borrowed starlight. <words>126</words>
He wanted to capture the precise moment the dawn kissed the baron's face, illuminating his guilt, his greed, his superficially profound pronouncements of philanthropy. <words>143</words>
The shuttle doors opened, and the baron emerged, bathed in the artificial light of the landing bay. <words>152</words>
The assassin pressed the shutter, the camera whirring softly. <words>157</words>
He captured a series of images as the baron walked towards his waiting hovercar, each photo a testament to the unforgiving road of ambition. <words>170</words>
The assassin laughed again, this time a longer, more guttural sound, a release of tension. <words>179</words>
He had his art. <words>182</words>
He had his dawn. <words>184</words>
And he had his plan. <words>187</words>
The spider's web, after all, was not just a map of routine, but a blueprint for a trap. <words>198</words>
He would use the baron's predictability, his superficially profound pronouncements, against him. <words>207</words>
He would weave his own web, a web of borrowed starlight and unforgiving consequences. <words>217</words>
When the bus driver completed his next final route, the baron would find himself caught in a sticky, inescapable predicament. <words>230</words>
The assassin smiled, a predatory gleam in his eyes. <words>235</words>
He cradled the camera in his trembling hands, the paint-splattered lens reflecting the nascent dawn, a promise of a new day, a new hunt. <words>251</words>
The baroque asteroid, bathed in the borrowed starlight, held its breath, waiting for the inevitable. <words>260</words>
The assassin, perched on his gargoyle, laughed, a sound as cold and unforgiving as the road below. <words>270</words>
