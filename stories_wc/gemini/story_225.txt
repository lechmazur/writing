The wayward apothecary, Silas, tapped the dry highlighter pen against the brass railing of the steampunk submarine's observation deck. <words>16</words>
The portholes revealed a world of churning, teal-green water, a battlefield between broken treaties and the uneasy peace of the deep. <words>29</words>
Silas’s love for Elara, unjustly fair and captivating as the bioluminescent coral reefs they studied, was as unconventional as his methods. <words>44</words>
He’d infected her, not with disease, but with a longing, a shared obsession. <words>52</words>
Through morse code signals, blinked from the submarine’s repurposed searchlight, he’d transmitted the coordinates of the migratory cloudwing butterflies’ breeding grounds. <words>68</words>
He knew she’d follow, drawn by the same battered marvel of nature that consumed him. <words>76</words>
The highlighter, its ink long gone, was a talisman, a reminder of the maps they’d poured over in his cluttered apothecary shop, dreaming of this moment. <words>91</words>
The submarine creaked and groaned, a metal leviathan navigating the treacherous currents between warring nations. <words>101</words>
Silas’s infection, his love, was a beacon in this fractured world, a shared purpose in a time of broken promises. <words>113</words>
He tapped out a message on the railing: “Almost there, my love. <words>119</words>
The cloudwings await.” <words>121</words>
He imagined Elara receiving his message, her own submarine, a sleek, silver dart compared to his clunky behemoth, cutting through the water towards him. <words>139</words>
Their love wasn't sanctioned by society, not in this era of suspicion and fractured alliances. <words>149</words>
It was a rogue signal in a world of static, a vibrant anomaly in the battered marvel of their existence. <words>160</words>
He raised the dry highlighter to his lips, a silent toast to their unconventional bond. <words>168</words>
The cloudwings, with their iridescent wings and impossible migrations, were a symbol of their shared passion, a testament to the beauty that could still flourish in a broken world. <words>188</words>
Silas’s love for Elara, unjustly fair in its intensity, was a rebellion against the bleakness, a defiant act of hope in a time of despair. <words>203</words>
He scanned the horizon, his heart pounding with anticipation. <words>208</words>
The cloudwings were a spectacle, a fleeting miracle, and he yearned to share that marvel with Elara. <words>219</words>
He tapped the railing again, a nervous rhythm against the metal. <words>225</words>
He’d infected her with his love, and now, he waited for her to arrive, to share in the wonder of the migratory butterflies, a testament to their unconventional, unjustly fair love in this battered, marvelous world. <words>254</words>
The submarine lurched, and through the porthole, Silas saw a flash of silver, a sleek vessel emerging from the gloom. <words>266</words>
Elara. <words>267</words>
A smile spread across his face. <words>270</words>
The infection had taken hold. <words>273</words>
