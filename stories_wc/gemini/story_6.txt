The skeptical minstrel, Finn, squinted at the dragon-scale armor scrap, its emerald sheen shimmering even in the dim light of the disappearing ink factory. <words>17</words>
At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, an eerie silence had fallen over the usually bustling factory floor. <words>30</words>
Finn knew this was the perfect moment. <words>33</words>
He had to out-scheme Jax, an immortal trickster who’d plagued him for centuries, and this impossibly plausible plan, fueled by reckless generosity, was his only hope. <words>50</words>
Finn chuckled, a sound that echoed strangely in the vast, empty space. <words>57</words>
Jax had a weakness for rare artifacts, and this dragon scale, though just a scrap, was bait enough. <words>68</words>
The factory, known for its vanishing inks, was the ideal setting for the exchange – a place where things appeared and disappeared with disconcerting ease. <words>82</words>
Finn’s plan hinged on the hiss of an ancient steam vent in an abandoned section of the factory. <words>92</words>
He’d rigged a slingshot to launch the dragon scale directly into Jax’s waiting hands, timed perfectly with the vent’s eruption. <words>104</words>
The steam, infused with the factory’s peculiar magic, would make the scale appear to vanish mid-flight, a tantalizing trick for the trickster god. <words>119</words>
Finn positioned himself near the vent, the slingshot loaded and aimed. <words>126</words>
He felt a thrill of irreverent awe, a strange mix of disrespect and wonder at the audacity of his plan. <words>139</words>
The mailbox’s midday hush deepened, the silence pressing in on him. <words>146</words>
Then, the hiss. <words>148</words>
Finn released the slingshot. <words>150</words>
The dragon scale shot through the air, catching the light just as the steam erupted. <words>159</words>
It vanished. <words>160</words>
A moment later, a booming laugh echoed through the factory. <words>167</words>
Jax materialized, his form shimmering like heat haze. <words>172</words>
“Magnificent!” he roared, his voice laced with delighted frustration. <words>178</words>
“Where did it go? <words>180</words>
A disappearing dragon scale in a disappearing ink factory! <words>186</words>
You’ve outdone yourself, Finn!” <words>189</words>
Finn bowed theatrically, hiding a smirk. <words>193</words>
Jax, in his eagerness to understand the trick, had completely overlooked the real prize: the deed to the factory, tucked neatly into the pouch attached to the slingshot. <words>212</words>
Finn had given Jax the illusion of ownership over a disappearing scale, while he himself now owned the entire disappearing factory. <words>225</words>
Reckless generosity, indeed. <words>227</words>
It was a gamble, but Finn knew Jax’s ego wouldn’t allow him to admit he’d been tricked by such a seemingly simple act. <words>242</words>
The trickster god, blinded by his own cleverness, had fallen for the most impossibly plausible of schemes. <words>253</words>
Finn, the skeptical minstrel, had finally out-schemed the immortal. <words>259</words>
He let out a quiet laugh, the sound swallowed by the returning hum of the factory, now his factory. <words>270</words>
