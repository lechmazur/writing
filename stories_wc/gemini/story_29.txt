A hopeful knight, Sir Gideon, knelt in a mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze, the air thick with the scent of overripe plums and something faintly metallic. <words>20</words>
During the hush of a streetlamp flickering out, the world shifted into a deeper shade of twilight. <words>31</words>
He held a stray jigsaw edge, its material humming faintly against his gauntleted fingers. <words>38</words>
This wasn't just any lost piece; it was the key, he believed, cleverly naive in his conviction. <words>48</words>
He had to reclaim what was lost, not just for himself, but for the countless souls trapped in the machine's relentless cycle. <words>61</words>
The machine that cycled regrets, a monstrous contraption hidden deep within the maze, fed on the energy of unfulfilled desires and what-ifs. <words>75</words>
Gideon's own regrets, sharp and vivid, fueled his agonizing bliss, a bittersweet cocktail of determination and despair. <words>86</words>
He closed his eyes, the jigsaw edge pressing into his palm, a physical anchor in the swirling sea of his emotions. <words>98</words>
He needed to neutralize the machine, to break its hold on the past. <words>105</words>
The method was as strange as the machine itself: by syncing with cryptic frequencies emanating from the jigsaw piece. <words>117</words>
He focused, breathing deeply, letting the garden's strange stillness seep into his bones. <words>125</words>
The frequencies began as a low thrum, a vibration that resonated not just in his hand, but in his very core. <words>137</words>
It was a language he didn't understand, yet somehow, instinctively knew. <words>143</words>
The agonizing bliss intensified, a wave of bittersweet energy washing over him as he felt himself aligning with the cryptic rhythm. <words>156</words>
The jigsaw edge pulsed with a soft, ethereal light, mirroring the flickering remnants of the streetlamp's dying glow. <words>167</words>
He saw the machine in his mind's eye, a grotesque tangle of gears and pipes, humming with stolen memories. <words>178</words>
He pushed outward, sending the synced frequencies, now amplified by his own resolve, towards the machine. <words>188</words>
The air crackled with unseen energy. <words>191</words>
A low groan echoed through the maze, followed by a series of metallic clicks and whirs. <words>200</words>
The scent of overripe plums intensified, momentarily overpowering the metallic tang. <words>207</words>
Then, silence. <words>208</words>
Gideon opened his eyes, the jigsaw edge now cool and inert in his hand. <words>216</words>
The agonizing bliss subsided, leaving behind a hollow ache and a fragile sense of peace. <words>226</words>
He had reclaimed something, he wasn't sure what, but the oppressive weight on his chest had lifted. <words>236</words>
He stood, his knees popping in the quiet of the orchard. <words>241</words>
The maze seemed less menacing now, the shadows less deep. <words>247</words>
He took a tentative step forward, then another, the cleverly naive hope flickering anew in his heart. <words>258</words>
He didn't know what awaited him beyond the maze, but for the first time in a long time, he felt ready to face it. <words>271</words>
The machine that cycled regrets was silent, and in that silence, Gideon found a sliver of agonizing bliss, a testament to the power of reclaiming the lost. <words>289</words>
