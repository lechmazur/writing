Bartholomew Buttons, a humorless comedic actor known for his deadpan delivery of absurd one-liners, sat on a rusty swing set in a deserted playground. <words>18</words>
The chipped paint beneath his fingers felt like the flaking skin of a forgotten memory. <words>26</words>
Around him, the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry draped the playground in an eerie stillness, the edge of a wilderness pressing in like a curious spectator. <words>43</words>
He clutched an empty, dried-out inkwell, an objectively personal and unwanted gift from a fan who’d clearly misunderstood his act. <words>56</words>
Bartholomew wanted to bottle a star’s dying breath, a feat as ludicrous as his stage persona. <words>65</words>
He’d convinced himself this inkwell, useless as it was, held the key. <words>72</words>

Through persistent daydream loops, Bartholomew began to concede. <words>78</words>
He saw himself on stage, bathed in the harsh glare of the spotlight, the inkwell perched precariously on a stool beside him. <words>90</words>
He mimed unscrewing the cap, a gesture so exaggerated it bordered on the grotesque. <words>99</words>
The audience, a sea of blurred faces, remained silent, their laughter trapped somewhere between expectation and bewilderment. <words>110</words>
In his daydream, he dipped a phantom quill into the dry inkwell, the scraping sound echoing through the silent theatre. <words>121</words>
He pretended to write a joke on the air, a joke so profound, so cosmically funny, that it would capture the essence of a dying star. <words>135</words>
But the joke never came. <words>138</words>

The loop restarted. <words>140</words>
He’d unscrew the cap, dip the imaginary quill, the scraping sound, the pregnant pause, the absent punchline. <words>151</words>
Over and over, the loop played, a relentless cycle of anticipation and disappointment. <words>160</words>
The playground, the wilderness, the hush of time, all faded into the background of his mental theatre. <words>170</words>
He was trapped in the performance, a prisoner of his own absurd ambition. <words>178</words>

Slowly, through the repetition, a strange shift occurred. <words>184</words>
The desire to bottle a star’s dying breath began to dissipate, replaced by a quiet acceptance of the inkwell’s emptiness. <words>198</words>
The daydream loop, once a frantic pursuit of the impossible, became a meditative exercise in futility. <words>209</words>
He conceded, not with a dramatic flourish, but with a quiet sigh that escaped his lips in the deserted playground. <words>220</words>
The inkwell, once a symbol of his misguided ambition, became a simple object, a dried-out, unwanted gift. <words>231</words>
He opened his eyes, the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry no longer a backdrop for his internal struggle, but simply the sound of the wind rustling through the trees at the edge of the wilderness. <words>251</words>
He placed the inkwell on the swing beside him, a small, insignificant artifact in the vast expanse of the deserted playground. <words>263</words>
The loop had broken. <words>265</words>
He was free. <words>267</words>
Bartholomew Buttons, the humorless comedic actor, stood up and walked away, leaving the unwanted gift behind, a silent testament to the absurdity of his quest. <words>287</words>
