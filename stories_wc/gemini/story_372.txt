The lovelorn spy, curiously indifferent to the flashing neon signs of the futuristic city slums, peeled an unused sticky label from his wrist. <words>20</words>
He’d used it as a makeshift reminder, a pathetically analog note in this digital dystopia, to meet her here, at the greasy spoon diner famed for its experimental protein paste recipes. <words>41</words>
At the instant the new “Sunburst Surprise” recipe was finally tasted by the first daring customer, a low rumble shook the ground. <words>55</words>
It was the avalanche, the unstoppable one they’d both been tracking, the one that had brought them together through a shared interest in urban exploration, the one they’d hoped to outrun. <words>78</words>
He saw his reflection in the chrome countertop, distorted and unfamiliar, a stranger staring back at him from a world about to end. <words>91</words>
He wasn’t sure if it was the protein paste or the impending doom, but a strange calm settled over him. <words>102</words>
He almost felt…disappointed. <words>104</words>
Not in himself, not in the city, but in her. <words>108</words>
She wasn’t coming. <words>110</words>
He knew it with a chilling certainty. <words>113</words>
He’d been played. <words>115</words>
Their shared passion, their whispered plans of escape, the stolen moments amidst crumbling concrete and flickering holograms – all a lie. <words>130</words>
He should have known. <words>132</words>
The signs were there, the subtle shifts in her gaze, the fleeting hesitations in her voice. <words>141</words>
He’d been too blinded by his infatuation to see them. <words>146</words>
Now, as the rumble intensified and the first cracks appeared in the diner’s grimy windows, a perverse sense of satisfaction washed over him. <words>161</words>
He wouldn’t give her the satisfaction of seeing him panic. <words>167</words>
He wouldn’t let her win. <words>169</words>
He smoothed down his rumpled jacket, took a final, lingering sip of the surprisingly palatable Sunburst Surprise, and placed the unused sticky label on the counter, a small, defiant gesture in the face of oblivion. <words>193</words>
Let her find it, he thought, let her wonder what he’d written on it, let her grapple with the unfamiliar reflection of her own betrayal in the ruins of their shared world. <words>215</words>
A slow smile spread across his face. <words>219</words>
He almost wanted to gloat. <words>222</words>
Almost. <words>223</words>
The avalanche roared closer, the ground beneath him bucked and swayed, the diner’s lights flickered and died. <words>235</words>
He closed his eyes, a curiously indifferent observer of his own rambling destiny, and waited for the end. <words>245</words>
He felt a strange sense of peace. <words>249</words>
He had outrun nothing, but in this final moment, he had outrun her. <words>257</words>
And in the strange, distorted logic of his lovelorn spy's heart, that was enough. <words>266</words>
The avalanche consumed him, the diner, the city, the sticky label, and all the unfamiliar reflections of a life lived on the edge of oblivion. <words>284</words>
He was gone, but in a way, he had won. <words>289</words>
He had kept his secrets, his pain, his final, defiant act of indifference, all to himself. <words>300</words>
And that, he realized as the world turned white, was the ultimate gloat.
