The mildly panicked soothsayer squinted at the water rings on the battered wooden bar top, a maze of concentric circles reflecting the neon glow of the billboard desert outside. <words>22</words>
He magnified the ripples, his brow furrowed, searching for answers between the lost years. <words>30</words>
“Destiny, you fickle shrew,” he muttered, the sarcasm molten in his voice. <words>36</words>
“You think you can hide from me in this… this monument to consumerism?” <words>44</words>
He slammed a pocket puzzle box with thirteen locks onto the bar, the wood groaning under the sudden weight. <words>53</words>
“I’ll shape you with my bare hands if I have to.” <words>58</words>
He picked at the first lock, a tiny brass lever shaped like a wilting sapling. <words>65</words>
“Probably unlikely,” he admitted, his panic bubbling up again. <words>70</words>
“But what isn’t these days?” <words>73</words>
The billboards screamed silent messages of consumption, a stark contrast to the fragile ecosystem he saw reflected in the water rings. <words>84</words>
Each ripple, he realized, represented a lost opportunity for environmental stewardship, a chance to mend the broken world. <words>94</words>
The second lock, a miniature wind turbine, mocked him with its immobility. <words>100</words>
“Fine,” he hissed, tracing the path of a particularly large water ring with his finger. <words>107</words>
“Let’s see what secrets you hold.” <words>110</words>
The ring, magnified by his scrutiny, revealed a faint image of a parched riverbed, a testament to the desert’s encroaching thirst. <words>121</words>
He fiddled with the third lock, a tiny metal fish gasping for air. <words>128</words>
The soothsayer’s sarcasm melted away, replaced by a grim determination. <words>135</words>
This wasn’t just about shaping destiny anymore; it was about saving it. <words>141</words>
The puzzle box, he realized, wasn’t just a toy; it was a key. <words>148</words>
Each lock represented a challenge, a step towards restoring balance to the ravaged world. <words>157</words>
The neon glow of the billboards seemed to dim, replaced by the faintest glimmer of hope reflected in the water rings. <words>169</words>
He picked at the locks with renewed vigor, each click a small victory against the overwhelming odds. <words>178</words>
The bar top, once a canvas of despair, became a map of possibilities. <words>185</words>
He saw visions of reforestation projects, sustainable energy sources, and thriving ecosystems blooming in the heart of the desert. <words>198</words>
Probably unlikely, he thought, but the thought no longer held the same weight. <words>206</words>
He had seen the future in the water rings, and it was worth fighting for. <words>214</words>
The thirteenth lock clicked open, and the puzzle box unfolded, revealing a single seed nestled within its intricate mechanisms. <words>226</words>
He held it up to the neon light, a tiny symbol of hope in a world consumed by waste. <words>235</words>
He knew, with a certainty that defied the probably unlikely nature of his quest, that this seed held the potential to reshape the desert, to heal the scars of the lost years, and to finally, truly, shape destiny with his bare hands. <words>265</words>
He smiled, a genuine, unsarcastic smile, for the first time in a long time. <words>272</words>
