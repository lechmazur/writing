The wreck-diver ghost whisperer, Elias, traced the chipped paint of a clown’s leering face in the abandoned carnival shooting gallery. <words>14</words> Dust motes, thick as carnival confetti, danced in the slivers of light filtering through the boarded-up windows. <words>25</words> He’d come here, between the lines of a half-written letter to his estranged sister, seeking solace in the joyfully melancholic echoes of their childhood. <words>40</words>  Their family tradition of attending this carnival every summer had ended abruptly, leaving a void Elias now tried to fill with the whispers of the past. <words>57</words> He pulled a piece of amber from his pocket, the prehistoric insect trapped inside a tiny, golden world. <words>68</words> It was a memento from their last visit, a shared secret, a tangible link to a time when their hearts were open and unguarded. <words>81</words>

Elias closed his eyes, letting the chill of the decaying wood seep into his bones. <words>89</words> He focused on the amber, its warmth a counterpoint to the carnival's icy grip. <words>98</words>  He whispered a name, a plea, a question into the silence, hoping to arouse the spirits that lingered here, trapped like the insect in amber. <words>112</words> A fleeting rebellion against the grief that had become his constant companion stirred within him. <words>121</words> He was tired of living in the shadow of his brother's memory, the golden boy who had drowned in a diving accident years ago. <words>135</words> Elias had inherited his brother's diving gear and, inexplicably, his ability to communicate with the departed. <words>147</words> But he had always felt inadequate, a pale imitation, living a life defined by absence. <words>156</words>

A faint whisper brushed against his ear, a child's giggle, the pop of a balloon. <words>165</words> The carnival came alive in his mind, vibrant and noisy, a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds. <words>176</words> He saw his brother, younger, carefree, aiming a cork gun at a row of grinning ducks. <words>186</words>  Elias felt a thawing in his chest, a warmth spreading outwards, melting the icy shell he had built around his heart. <words>199</words> He understood then. <words>201</words>  His brother wasn't a shadow to be outrun, but a light to guide him. <words>210</words>  This wasn't about stepping out of his brother's shadow, but about stepping into his own. <words>220</words>  He would embrace his gift, his grief, his life, with a joyfully melancholic acceptance. <words>230</words> He would finish the letter to his sister, an invitation to return, to remember, to heal together. <words>240</words>  The carnival, once a symbol of loss, now held the promise of reunion, a testament to the enduring power of love and shared memories. <words>255</words>  He clutched the amber, a reminder of the past and a beacon for the future. <words>264</words>  He was ready to live, truly live, between the lines of a life rewritten. <words>274</words>
