Bartholomew, a scrappy tavern-hand with grease perpetually staining his apron, felt the familiar tug, the inescapable calling, even amidst the vacuum chamber garden's sterile hum. <words>21</words>
The air, thin and recycled, did little to quell the predictably unpredictable urge to randomize his life. <words>31</words>
He glanced at the cracked dome above, where simulated stars wheeled in reverse, the sands of time flowing backward. <words>41</words>
His motivation, as always, was to catapult his imagination beyond the known realms, beyond the tavern's stale ale and boisterous patrons. <words>54</words>
He clutched a collection of broken seashells, remnants of a forgotten ocean, a tangible link to a world that existed only in the reversed flow of time. <words>69</words>
"Right, then," he muttered with flippant solemnity, tucking the shells into his pocket. <words>76</words>
"Off we go." <words>78</words>
He strode towards the garden's edge, where a simulated dried-up riverbed snaked through the synthetic foliage. <words>88</words>
The fossilized footprints, normally tracing a path from the river's source, now pointed towards it, a testament to time's reversed flow. <words>101</words>
Bartholomew's method was simple: he'd follow the footprints, but at each junction, he'd randomize his direction based on the number of broken shell fragments in his hand. <words>117</words>
Three fragments meant left, two meant right, one meant straight ahead. <words>123</words>
He closed his eyes, rummaged in his pocket, and pulled out a handful. <words>130</words>
Two. <words>131</words>
Right it was. <words>133</words>
He turned, the artificial sun, now setting in the east, casting long, distorted shadows. <words>141</words>
The absurdity of it all, the reversed time, the sterile garden mimicking a dead world, the random path dictated by broken shells, filled him with a peculiar sense of peace. <words>158</words>
It was a rebellion against the predictable, a small act of chaos in a world meticulously engineered. <words>168</words>
He continued his journey, the flippant solemnity of his quest a shield against the creeping despair of a world unwinding. <words>180</words>
Each randomized turn, each crunching step through the fossilized footprints, was a defiant affirmation of his own agency, a refusal to be swept away by the backward tide of time. <words>199</words>
He imagined the river flowing backward, filling with water, the footprints disappearing, the shells reforming, the world rewinding to a time before the vacuum chamber, before the simulated stars, before the inescapable calling. <words>221</words>
But even in that imagined past, he knew, the urge to randomize, to explore, to catapult his imagination beyond known realms, would remain. <words>235</words>
It was, after all, an inescapable calling. <words>239</words>
He smiled, a genuine smile, unburdened by the flippant solemnity he usually wore. <words>247</words>
He reached into his pocket, ready for the next randomized turn, ready to embrace the unpredictable path, ready to follow the fossilized footprints wherever they might lead, even as the sands of time flowed backward. <words>274</words>
