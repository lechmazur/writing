The astute hermit, Bartholomew, chuckled dryly, a sound that echoed strangely in the cavern cathedral. <words>12</words>
Phosphorescent flora pulsed with an eerie green light, illuminating the rusted elevator doors that had just shuddered open onto the empty floor. <words>27</words>
“Right on schedule,” he muttered, the humor tinged with despair. <words>32</words>
Bartholomew’s isolation, decades spent in this self-made sanctuary, had amplified his eccentricities, not least of which was his strangely effective method of restoring the long-defunct water systems. <words>55</words>
He held up a blunt scissor, its blades thick with age and grime. <words>62</words>
“My trusty hydro-manipulator,” he explained to the empty air, his voice a raspy whisper. <words>70</words>
At the moment the elevator arrived, Bartholomew had been meticulously slicing a fresh loaf of bread he’d somehow managed to bake using geothermal vents and foraged fungi. <words>89</words>
The scent, warm and yeasty, was his secret weapon. <words>94</words>
Bartholomew’s theory, honed over years of solitary tinkering and fueled by a desperate longing for running water, was that the scent of fresh bread, amplified via the cavern’s unique acoustics, could somehow stimulate the dormant pipes. <words>124</words>
He believed the metal, parched and brittle after years of disuse, yearned for the memory of civilization, for the simple comfort of a shared meal. <words>141</words>
The bread’s aroma, he reasoned, acted as a kind of olfactory key, unlocking the water’s flow. <words>151</words>
He positioned himself strategically near a rusted valve, holding the loaf aloft like some bizarre religious offering. <words>161</words>
“Behold,” he announced to the glowing fungi, “the miracle of carbohydrates!” <words>168</words>
He began to saw at the loaf with the blunt scissor, sending a cloud of crumbs and that tantalizing scent swirling through the cavern. <words>182</words>
The air, thick with the smell of baking bread, seemed to vibrate. <words>189</words>
Bartholomew waited, his ears straining for the gurgle of resurrected pipes. <words>196</words>
Silence. <words>197</words>
Then, a faint dripping sound. <words>200</words>
Bartholomew’s face lit up with a mixture of hope and manic glee. <words>207</words>
“Ha!” he exclaimed, brandishing the blunt scissor. <words>211</words>
“Knew it!” <words>213</words>
The dripping stopped. <words>215</words>
Bartholomew’s smile faltered. <words>218</words>
He sniffed the air, the scent of bread now tinged with the metallic tang of rust. <words>227</words>
“Perhaps,” he mumbled, his despairing humor returning, “a little more crust?” <words>234</words>
He resumed sawing at the loaf with renewed vigor, the blunt scissor struggling against the hardening crust, a metaphor, he thought ruefully, for his own increasingly desperate attempts to connect with a world he had long left behind. <words>272</words>
The cavern cathedral, alive with its phosphorescent flora, remained silent, a testament to the profound impact of isolation. <words>284</words>
Bartholomew sighed, the scent of bread heavy in the air, a poignant reminder of the simple comforts he craved. <words>297</words>
He continued sawing, the rhythmic scraping of the blunt scissor against the loaf echoing in the vast emptiness, a lonely soundtrack to his despairing, humorous struggle for survival. <words>319</words>
Maybe tomorrow, he thought, the water would flow. <words>324</words>
Maybe tomorrow, the isolation wouldn't feel so heavy. <words>330</words>
Maybe tomorrow. <words>332</words>
He kept sawing. <words>334</words>
