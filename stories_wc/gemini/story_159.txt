<story>
A homeless philosopher-king, earnestly frivolous in his tattered robes, wandered the sandstone labyrinth. <words>12</words>
Floating lanterns cast an ethereal glow on the weathered walls, illuminating his path during the readings. <words>22</words>
He carried a weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its brass tarnished, its glass clouded with age. <words>30</words>
His motivation: to puzzle out a labyrinth once thought unsolvable. <words>38</words>
He believed the answer lay not in logic, but in transformative betrayal. <words>46</words>
His method: confetti-coded proposals at random weddings. <words>51</words>
He’d infiltrate the joyous ceremonies, a jarring figure amidst the celebration, and extend his hand, offering not congratulations, but cryptic proposals written on confetti. <words>71</words>
Each piece, a swirling burst of color, contained a fragment of his labyrinth theory. <words>79</words>
He saw the weddings as microcosms of the labyrinth, each guest a potential pathway, each vow a turn in the maze. <words>91</words>
The betrayal wasn't of the couples, but of expectation, of the assumed linearity of life's journey. <words>102</words>
He’d watch the reactions, the bewildered smiles, the confused murmurs, the occasional flicker of understanding, collecting them like data points in his grand experiment. <words>120</words>
The kaleidoscope, a symbol of fractured perspectives, helped him interpret the responses, each twist revealing a new pattern, a new potential solution. <words>134</words>
One evening, during a particularly boisterous reading beneath a particularly bright lantern, he extended a confetti proposal to a weeping bride. <words>148</words>
She paused, her tears momentarily forgotten, and read the message: "The exit lies in embracing the unexpected turn." <words>159</words>
She looked at him, a strange comprehension dawning in her eyes. <words>166</words>
She then turned, not back to the groom, but towards a hidden passage in the labyrinth wall, previously unnoticed. <words>179</words>
The philosopher-king followed, his heart pounding. <words>183</words>
The passage led to a hidden garden, bathed in moonlight, the true exit of the labyrinth. <words>192</words>
The bride, now a collaborator in his experiment, smiled. <words>198</words>
The betrayal, the unexpected turn, had led to the solution. <words>204</words>
The complex simplicity of his method had worked. <words>209</words>
He looked through his kaleidoscope, the fractured images now aligning, forming a clear picture of the labyrinth's intricate design. <words>222</words>
He had puzzled it out, not through logic, but through earnestly frivolous acts of confetti-coded proposals, transforming betrayal into enlightenment. <words>238</words>
The sandstone labyrinth, once a symbol of confinement, now felt like a playground of possibilities. <words>248</words>
The floating lanterns, once guides in the darkness, now seemed to celebrate his triumph. <words>257</words>
He extended his hand towards the lanterns, as if to grasp the ephemeral light, a small smile playing on his lips. <words>271</words>
The transformative betrayal had not only solved the labyrinth, but had also transformed him. <words>280</words>
