She felt the familiar tug, the gravity of her desires pulling her towards the unknown. <words>25</words>
After the invention of time travel, freedom had become a paradox, a shimmering mirage in a desert of infinite possibilities. <words>37</words>
Seraphina yearned to proclaim herself free, to shatter the cage of illusions that held her captive. <words>47</words>
But how could one be truly free when every choice, every path, had already been trodden, every heartbreak meticulously cataloged? <words>59</words>
Her restlessly curious nature, however, refused to accept this predetermined fate. <words>65</words>

The chance to rewrite her story, to proclaim herself free from the gravity of her desires, from the cage of illusions. <words>202</words>
She took a deep breath, the cool air filling her lungs with the promise of the unknown. <words>210</words>
With a final glance at her reflection, a fleeting image of a woman on the cusp of transformation, she zipped towards the distorted patch of sky, ready to embrace whatever lay beyond. <words>228</words>
