The last star had sputtered out eons ago, leaving the surface world a frozen wasteland. <words>14</words>
Kaito, an eternal college student pursuing a degree in immortality, now resided in the subterranean city of the mole people, its mundane glory illuminated by geothermal vents and bioluminescent fungi. <words>35</words>
His pursuit, however, wasn't for endless life, but rather mastery over his own reality, a gifted burden he carried with detached devotion. <words>50</words>
He believed the key lay not in biological immortality, but in digitizing consciousness, transcending the physical limitations of a dying universe. <words>66</words>
His research led him to a peculiar artifact – a coal miner’s headlamp retrieved from a collapsed mine on the surface, a relic from a bygone era when sunlight still kissed the earth. <words>88</words>
The headlamp, surprisingly, contained a faint residual energy signature, a whisper of the past. <words>97</words>
Kaito theorized this energy, if properly harnessed, could be the catalyst for his digital ascension. <words>107</words>

He sought the help of the mole people's archivist, a wizened creature named Borris, whose memory stretched back further than any living being. <words>124</words>
Borris, in exchange for Kaito's assistance in digitizing the city's crumbling archives, agreed to share his knowledge. <words>137</words>
Their method of information exchange was unconventional: swapped travel journals. <words>144</words>
Kaito filled his with complex equations and theoretical frameworks, while Borris filled his with cryptic mole-folk parables and oral histories, each entry a piece of the puzzle. <words>163</words>
One parable spoke of a "light eater," a being capable of absorbing and manipulating light itself. <words>172</words>
Kaito saw a parallel with the headlamp's energy signature. <words>178</words>
He began to understand: the headlamp wasn't just a source of energy, but a blueprint for manipulating it. <words>190</words>

He modified the headlamp, integrating it with the mole people's bioluminescent technology, creating a device capable of digitizing small objects. <words>205</words>
He tested it on a rock, then a fungus, each successful digitization fueling his detached devotion. <words>216</words>
The final step was the most daunting: digitizing his own consciousness. <words>223</words>
He adjusted the headlamp, its mundanely glorious beam now pulsating with the digitized essence of a dying star, filtered through the memories of a forgotten world. <words>242</words>
He placed the headlamp on his forehead, the cool metal a stark contrast to the rising heat of anticipation. <words>253</words>
He closed his eyes, ready to transcend the physical, to become a master of his own reality, a reality crafted not of flesh and bone, but of pure, digitized light. <words>274</words>
The headlamp hummed, the city of the mole people faded, and Kaito, the eternal student, finally graduated. <words>285</words>
