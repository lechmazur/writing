In the hush of a half-lit corridor of a witch's flying carpet garage, Elias, the outcast scholar, felt a jolt. <words>18</words>
He clutched the seashell bearing a strange symbol, its smooth surface mirroring the frantic peace in his soul. <words>30</words>
Elias, strangely trustworthy despite his outcast status, was driven by the need to prove that midnight only lasts so long. <words>44</words>
His method: diaries hidden behind a loose tile in the public restroom of the garage. <words>55</words>
He’d discovered the hiding place weeks ago, a whispered secret from a disgruntled goblin mechanic. <words>65</words>
The diaries, penned by a long-forgotten witch, detailed her obsessive study of temporal anomalies, specifically the fleeting nature of midnight. <words>78</words>
Elias believed they held the key to understanding the strange power of the seashell, a power that resonated with his own internal clock. <words>91</words>
He pried the tile loose, the gritty grout clinging to his fingers like the remnants of a forgotten dream. <words>102</words>
Inside, nestled amongst cobwebs and dust, lay a stack of leather-bound journals. <words>110</words>
He pulled one out, its pages brittle with age. <words>115</words>
The witch’s spidery handwriting filled the pages, a frantic scrawl mirroring Elias’s own racing thoughts. <words>126</words>
He scanned the entries, his eyes darting across the text, searching for any mention of the symbol etched into his seashell. <words>139</words>
A diagram caught his eye, a complex geometric pattern radiating outwards like the spokes of a wheel. <words>149</words>
At its center, nestled within a circle, was the symbol. <words>155</words>
The jolt returned, stronger this time, a surge of energy coursing through him from the seashell. <words>166</words>
The garage around him seemed to shimmer, the half-light flickering as if struggling to maintain its hold on reality. <words>178</words>
He read the accompanying text, the witch’s words echoing his own desperate quest: "Midnight is a membrane, thin and fragile. <words>189</words>
It can be pierced, stretched, manipulated." <words>192</words>
Elias understood. <words>193</words>
The seashell, a key to manipulating time, mirrored his own desire to break free from the constraints of linear existence. <words>206</words>
He felt a strange kinship with the long-dead witch, a shared frantic peace in their pursuit of temporal mastery. <words>218</words>
He continued reading, the witch’s frantic scribbles detailing a ritual, a method for extending midnight, for holding onto the fleeting moment. <words>232</words>
Elias’s heart pounded in his chest, a frantic drumbeat against the backdrop of the hushed garage. <words>242</words>
He knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his soul, that he was on the verge of a breakthrough. <words>253</words>
The seashell pulsed warmly in his hand, a mirror reflecting his own burning desire to prove that midnight, like the soul, could be reshaped. <words>267</words>
He would break free from the constraints of time, just like the witch before him, and find his own frantic peace in the endless expanse of midnight. <words>284</words>
He clutched the seashell tighter, the strange symbol burning into his palm, a promise of the power to reshape time itself. <words>297</words>
The garage, the diaries, the witch's frantic peace - all mirrored in the depths of his own determined soul. <words>308</words>
He was ready to face the dawn, armed with the knowledge that midnight only lasts so long, but with the power to make it last a little longer. <words>324</words>
The hush of the corridor seemed to deepen, holding its breath in anticipation of the outcast scholar's next move. <words>336</words>
Elias smiled, a frantic, peaceful smile, and turned back to the diaries, the seashell warm against his skin. <words>347</words>
He was ready to rewrite midnight. <words>350</words>
