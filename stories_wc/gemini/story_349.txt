A drone pilot, ripped from his time and stranded in a medieval fantasy realm, stood in an abandoned observatory perched on a cliff. <words>18</words>
The orchard below, destined for the axe, waited in the hush before its demise, a charred serenity hanging in the air. <words>31</words>
He was cynically hopeful, clinging to the belief that even in this alien world, horizons of mercy existed. <words>42</words>
He clutched a dried herb bundle, its scent a ghostly echo of a life he might never reclaim. <words>52</words>
He had to lure possibility from the brink of despair, to disseminate hope like seeds on the wind. <words>63</words>

He remembered the absurdity of it all – a speed dating event, a flash of light, and then, this. <words>74</words>
The memory, so starkly modern, felt like a cruel joke against the backdrop of crumbling stone and impending destruction. <words>88</words>
The observatory, once a place of celestial observation, now offered a grim vantage point to witness the orchard's final moments. <words>101</words>
He crushed the dried herbs in his hand, releasing their pungent aroma into the still air. <words>110</words>
He imagined the scent, carried by the breeze, reaching the villagers below, a subtle invitation, a whisper of something different. <words>124</words>

He envisioned the herbs’ properties, known in his time for inducing vivid dreams, working their magic on the medieval minds. <words>137</words>
Dreams of lush orchards, untouched by the axe, dreams of abundance and life. <words>146</words>
He hoped these dreams would disseminate a seed of resistance, a refusal to accept the orchard's fate. <words>157</words>
He knew it was a long shot, a desperate gamble fueled by cynical hope. <words>166</words>
But in this charred serenity, before the fall of the axe, it was the only horizon of mercy he could conjure. <words>179</words>

He climbed to the observatory's highest point, the wind whipping around him. <words>186</words>
He scattered the remaining herb dust into the air, watching it dance and swirl before being carried towards the doomed orchard. <words>200</words>
He closed his eyes, picturing the villagers’ faces, their expressions shifting from resignation to wonder as the scent reached them. <words>214</words>
He imagined them questioning the inevitability of the orchard's destruction, a spark of defiance ignited by a dream. <words>227</words>

He opened his eyes, the charred serenity of the pre-dawn light giving way to the first rays of the rising sun. <words>240</words>
The orchard below, still untouched, shimmered in the golden light. <words>246</words>
He didn't know if his desperate act would bear fruit, but in that moment, the horizon of mercy seemed a little wider, a little brighter. <words>262</words>
The cynical hope within him flickered, a small flame against the vast darkness, but a flame nonetheless. <words>272</words>
