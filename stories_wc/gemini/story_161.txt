<story>Bartholomew, the orchardist, was never tardy, a trait honed throughout his years volunteering at the paper airplane test facility. <words>17</words>  His sardonic glee masked a deep grief, the tragic loss of his wife to a shadowy cabal he believed controlled the global fruit trade. <words>34</words> He was determined to unravel their conspiracy, to expose their rotten core like a bruised apple. <words>44</words>

His opportunity came during the annual peacock-themed fundraising gala held at the facility. <words>52</words> Bartholomew, amidst the swirling paper airplanes and flamboyant decorations, noticed the distinct patterns on the peacock’s tail feathers. <words>63</words>  Each iridescent eye, each shimmering barb, seemed to whisper a secret code. <words>70</words> He realized, with a thrill of sardonic glee, that the patterns mirrored the flight paths of certain experimental paper airplanes, the ones designed for maximum distance and stealth. <words>86</words>

He’d seen those flight paths before, documented in confidential reports he’d “borrowed” from the facility. <words>95</words>  Reports that, when cross-referenced with shipping manifests he’d painstakingly compiled, pointed to a network of clandestine fruit shipments to remote, politically unstable regions. <words>112</words>  The cabal, he suspected, was using the fruit as a cover for something far more sinister. <words>121</words>

He needed proof, something tangible to demonstrate his theory. <words>127</words>  He found it in his pocket: an antique letter seal, his wife’s last gift, engraved with a stylized peacock feather. <words>139</words>  He’d discovered, during his obsessive research, that the seal belonged to a long-defunct trading company, one with historical ties to the very same cabal he now investigated. <words>157</words>

During his next volunteering shift, Bartholomew, with sardonic glee bubbling beneath his composed exterior, gathered the facility’s top brass. <words>170</words>  He used the peacock’s tail, projected onto a large screen, as his visual aid. <words>178</words>  Via the patterns in the peacock’s tail, he demonstrated the correlation between the experimental airplane flight paths and the locations of the suspicious fruit shipments. <words>194</words> He then presented the antique letter seal, connecting the historical dots with a flourish. <words>203</words>

The room fell silent. <words>205</words>  The director, a portly man with a perpetually surprised expression, stammered, “But…peacocks?” <words>214</words> Bartholomew, his sardonic glee reaching its peak, simply tapped the seal. <words>221</words> “Observe the details,” he said, his voice dripping with a mixture of sorrow and triumph. <words>230</words>  “They often hold the key.” <words>233</words>

His demonstration, though initially met with skepticism, sparked an internal investigation. <words>241</words>  Bartholomew, fueled by his grief and sardonic glee, continued to volunteer, meticulously documenting every detail, every anomaly, every suspiciously ripe mango. <words>259</words> He knew his wife’s death wouldn’t be in vain. <words>264</words> He would unravel the conspiracy, one peacock feather at a time. <words>271</words>
