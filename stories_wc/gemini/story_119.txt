Elara, a secret astral projector, stood on the rusted platform of an abandoned carnival roller coaster track, the antique brass key cool against her palm. <words>18</words>
In the seconds following the sudden revelation—that her sometimes always reliable ability to project was faltering—a chill colder than the November wind snaked down her spine. <words>36</words>
She had to flee. <words>38</words>
Not physically, not yet, but astrally. <words>41</words>
Preserving her survival skills, honed over years of navigating the astral plane, was paramount. <words>50</words>
This unyielding compassion for her own well-being, a seemingly selfish act, was actually the bedrock of her ability to help others. <words>64</words>
A weakened Elara was no use to anyone. <words>69</words>
The key, a conduit to a safe haven in the astral plane, felt heavy with the weight of her decision. <words>80</words>
She closed her eyes, the practiced spontaneity of her technique taking over, and focused on the long, skeletal shadows cast by the roller coaster track. <words>95</words>
By tracking the sun shadows, she could anchor her astral form to the physical world, a crucial step in a hasty escape. <words>109</words>
The shadows shifted, elongated, then contracted as the sun continued its relentless westward march. <words>119</words>
Each subtle change was a marker, a guidepost in the ethereal landscape she was about to enter. <words>130</words>
Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the backdrop of the decaying carnival. <words>140</words>
Rust flaked off the metal beneath her boots, a tangible reminder of the impermanence of the physical world, a world she was about to leave behind, at least temporarily. <words>160</words>
The brass key warmed in her hand, resonating with a faint hum as her astral form began to separate. <words>171</words>
The carnival sounds—the creak of the Ferris wheel, the distant caw of a crow—faded, replaced by a low, resonant thrum. <words>185</words>
The shadows, once guides, now stretched and distorted, becoming pathways in the astral plane. <words>196</words>
Elara, her astral form shimmering like heat haze, moved with practiced grace, following the sun's shadow-path towards her sanctuary. <words>209</words>
The antique brass key, no longer cold, pulsed with a gentle light, a beacon in the swirling, sometimes always unpredictable currents of the astral plane. <words>224</words>
She knew, with a certainty that transcended the physical, that this flight was not an act of fear, but an act of preservation. <words>239</words>
It was a testament to her unyielding compassion, a commitment to returning stronger, more capable, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her, both in the astral and the physical realms. <words>263</words>
The roller coaster track, a symbol of dizzying highs and terrifying lows, faded from her awareness as she stepped fully into the astral plane, the brass key her only guide. <words>282</words>
She was safe, for now. <words>285</words>
The journey had just begun. <words>289</words>
