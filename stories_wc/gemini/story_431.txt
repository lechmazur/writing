Elara, an introverted dancer, sat hunched over astronomical charts in the dimly lit cipher decoder's office, her knitting needles clicking a rhythmic counterpoint to the whirring decryption machine. <words>20</words>
During this habit-forming timeframe, the repetitive motion soothed her frayed nerves, a small island of order in the chaotic sea of her mind. <words>35</words>
