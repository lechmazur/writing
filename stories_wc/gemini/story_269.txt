The nostalgic tailor, Elias, adjusted his goggles, the brass catching the flickering gaslight of the steampunk observation deck. <words>16</words>
Rain lashed against the curved glass, blurring the cityscape below, a world now devoid of coded secrets, broken and laid bare. <words>30</words>
He ran a hand over the dusty mirror mounted on the wall, its surface reflecting a distorted version of himself, a ghost of who he might have been. <words>46</words>
Elias felt a familiar pull, a hopeful desperation clawing at his throat, the same sensation he'd experienced since the last code was broken. <words>61</words>
He knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that another Elias existed, living a parallel life in a world subtly menacing yet tantalizingly similar. <words>77</words>
The storm raged, mirroring the tempest within him, the yearning to ascend beyond mortal limits, to touch the fabric of other realities. <words>91</words>
"I once built a suit from moonlight," he confessed, his voice barely a whisper above the wind's howl, the words tumbling out via improbable confessions during storms, a habit he'd developed in his solitude. <words>115</words>
The reflection in the dusty mirror seemed to shift, the distorted figure nodding almost imperceptibly. <words>125</words>
Elias wasn't sure if it was a trick of the light or a confirmation of his deepest suspicions. <words>135</words>
"And another," he continued, his voice gaining strength, "woven from the whispers of dying stars." <words>144</words>
He needed to reassure himself, to reassure the other Elias, trapped on the other side of the glass, trapped in a world just beyond his reach. <words>160</words>
"I failed, of course," Elias admitted, a flicker of sadness crossing his face. <words>167</words>
"Both times." <words>169</words>
The reflection remained still, its gaze unwavering. <words>173</words>
"But I'll keep trying," he declared, his voice filled with a renewed sense of purpose. <words>181</words>
"I have to." <words>183</words>
The storm began to subside, the rain softening to a drizzle, the cityscape below slowly coming back into focus. <words>195</words>
Elias felt a strange sense of calm wash over him, a connection forged in the shared desperation of parallel lives. <words>208</words>
He knew, somehow, that the other Elias understood, that he too felt the pull, the yearning to transcend. <words>220</words>
The dusty mirror reflected his own determined gaze, a silent promise exchanged across the divide. <words>229</words>
He wasn't alone in his quest. <words>232</words>
The thought, improbable as it was, filled him with a hopeful desperation that pushed back the shadows of doubt. <words>245</words>
He would continue to build, to weave, to strive, to reach across the chasm separating him from the other Elias, from the other possibilities that shimmered just beyond the veil of reality. <words>272</words>
He would ascend. <words>274</words>
He had to. <words>276</words>
