The giant’s dining room, usually a cavern of boisterous feasting, was strangely subdued amid rush hour. <words>14</words>
The lingering minstrel, usually the heart of the revelry, sat hunched in a corner, openly private in his gentle turmoil. <words>28</words>
He cradled a witch’s gnarled wooden ladle, its worn smoothness a stark contrast to the rough-hewn table and chairs. <words>40</words>
He longed to escape the mundane existence of rhyming couplets and forced cheer. <words>48</words>
He yearned for something… more. <words>50</words>
His gaze drifted to a peculiar object displayed on the mantelpiece: a meteorite, its surface a chaotic tapestry of ridges and craters. <words>63</words>
He felt an inexplicable pull towards it, a whisper of rejuvenation promised via the texture of a meteorite's surface. <words>75</words>
He rose, the ladle clutched tight in his hand, and approached the celestial rock. <words>83</words>
The room, still bustling with giants rushing to and fro, seemed to fall silent as he reached out and touched the meteorite. <words>96</words>
The rough texture, cold and alien, sent a jolt through him. <words>102</words>
It was a sensation unlike anything he had ever experienced, a raw, untamed energy that resonated deep within his soul. <words>115</words>
He closed his eyes, letting his fingers trace the intricate patterns, each groove and divot a story of cosmic journeys and fiery descents. <words>129</words>
The silence of the room, usually filled with the clang of cutlery and booming laughter, affirmed his decision. <words>140</words>
This was it. <words>142</words>
This was the escape he craved. <words>145</words>
The ladle, a symbol of his old life, felt heavy and foreign in his hand. <words>153</words>
He placed it gently on the mantelpiece, a silent farewell to the minstrel he once was. <words>162</words>
Opening his eyes, he felt a sense of lightness, a newfound clarity. <words>169</words>
The gentle turmoil within him had subsided, replaced by a quiet determination. <words>177</words>
He turned and walked towards the giant’s open doorway, the rush hour traffic outside no longer a symbol of confinement, but a gateway to the unknown. <words>194</words>
The giants, oblivious to the transformation that had just occurred, continued their hurried meal. <words>203</words>
Their indifference, their lack of acknowledgement, further affirmed his path. <words>210</words>
He was no longer the minstrel, bound by rhymes and melodies. <words>217</words>
He was a traveler, rejuvenated by the touch of the cosmos, stepping into a world beyond the giant’s dining room. <words>229</words>
The silence that followed his departure, a silence heavier than the usual cacophony, was a testament to the change that had taken place. <words>244</words>
It was a silence that spoke volumes, a silence that echoed the gentle roar of a soul set free. <words>256</words>
The witch’s gnarled wooden ladle remained on the mantelpiece, a forgotten relic of a mundane existence left behind. <words>268</words>
The meteorite, now subtly warmer, pulsed with a faint, almost imperceptible energy, a silent witness to the minstrel's rebirth. <words>282</words>
