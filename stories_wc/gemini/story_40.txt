Bartholomew Buttonsby, a reincarnated goldfish caretaker, tentatively fierce despite his past life’s limitations, prowled the forgotten recipe library. <words>14</words>
Dust motes danced in the slivers of light filtering through grimy windows, illuminating shelves stacked with culinary secrets lost to time. <words>26</words>
He was there to disrupt a stagnant tradition – the annual Parsnip and Pickle Pudding Potluck, a culinary abomination he’d endured for too many lifetimes. <words>42</words>
Before the doctor’s chart could confirm the turning point – his sanity’s complete departure – Bartholomew needed to find a replacement dish, something revolutionary. <words>56</words>
“Parsnip and pickle…who thought that was a good idea?” he muttered, playful cynicism lacing his voice. <words>65</words>
A sudden change of weather, a torrential downpour rattling the library’s ancient windows, led to a chance encounter. <words>76</words>
A small, damp figure huddled in the doorway, clutching a toy soldier with a missing arm. <words>84</words>
It was Millie, the baker’s daughter, known for her surprisingly sophisticated palate and a shared disdain for the pudding. <words>95</words>
“Lost, little minnow?” Bartholomew asked, his voice softening. <words>100</words>
Millie shook her head, her eyes fixed on the toy soldier. <words>105</words>
“He’s…guilty,” she whispered, her voice thick with unshed tears. <words>110</words>
Bartholomew recognized the guilt’s haunting echo, the same feeling that gnawed at him for failing to alleviate his goldfish’s suffering in his past life. <words>124</words>
He knelt beside her. <words>126</words>
“Guilty about what?” he asked gently. <words>129</words>
“Losing his arm,” Millie sobbed, holding up the soldier. <words>134</words>
“In the Great Marmalade War,” she added, her voice muffled against the toy. <words>140</words>
Bartholomew chuckled, a wave of understanding washing over him. <words>146</words>
He knew the weight of seemingly insignificant losses. <words>151</words>
He pulled a dusty cookbook from a nearby shelf, its pages filled with vibrant illustrations of fantastical desserts. <words>161</words>
“Perhaps,” he said, a mischievous glint in his eye, “a ‘Triple-Chocolate Truffle Tower of Power’ can alleviate his guilt…and ours.” <words>173</words>
Millie’s eyes widened, her tears forgotten. <words>177</words>
The recipe, a forgotten gem, promised a symphony of chocolate, a culinary rebellion against the tyranny of parsnips and pickles. <words>190</words>
Together, they plotted their sweet revenge, the forgotten recipe library becoming their strategic command center. <words>200</words>
The rain continued to lash against the windows, a soundtrack to their playful cynicism and shared determination. <words>210</words>
Bartholomew, the reincarnated goldfish caretaker, found a new purpose, a new battle to fight, and a new comrade-in-arms, even if she was a little minnow with a guilty toy soldier. <words>229</words>
He knew, with a certainty that transcended lifetimes, that this time, he wouldn't fail. <words>238</words>
The Parsnip and Pickle Pudding Potluck was about to face its sweetest, most decadent defeat. <words>248</words>
And perhaps, just perhaps, Bartholomew could finally alleviate the guilt that had haunted him for so long. <words>259</words>
The toy soldier, nestled safely in Millie's pocket, seemed to agree. <words>266</words>
Its one remaining arm pointed towards the future, a future filled with chocolate and the sweet taste of victory. <words>278</words>
