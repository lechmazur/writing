The weary undertaker, Elias, blinked, the hush after the car backfire echoing in the reimagined ancient Persian palace that served as his mortuary. <words>20</words>
The astronomical clock, a marvel of gears and celestial charts, ticked with placid ferocity, its rarely practical function a comfort in the sudden silence. <words>35</words>
Elias’s tribe, the Keepers of the Celestial Paths, held ancient knowledge of the sun’s journey, a knowledge passed down through generations, whispered in hushed tones, imbued with the weight of forgotten rituals. <words>58</words>
This knowledge, more spiritual than scientific, allowed them to imprison shadows, fears, and despairs by following sun paths, trapping them in the intricate dance of light and time. <words>76</words>
Tonight, Elias needed to imprison the encroaching darkness, the absolute dark that threatened to consume him after another day of ushering souls into the beyond. <words>93</words>
He traced the sun’s path across the inlaid mother-of-pearl floor of the palace, his movements precise, guided by the tribal knowledge etched into his very being. <words>111</words>
The clock’s gears whirred, mirroring the celestial movements, as Elias chanted in the ancient tongue, his voice a low rumble in the stillness. <words>126</words>
He focused on the sliver of hope, fragile yet persistent, that flickered within him, the hope that fueled his placid ferocity, his unwavering dedication to his unusual craft. <words>145</words>
The air shimmered, the shadows in the corners of the palace seeming to recoil, shrinking back from the encroaching light conjured by Elias’s ritual. <words>162</words>
He continued, following the sun’s path, weaving a net of light and time, a prison for the despair that threatened to engulf him. <words>176</words>
The astronomical clock chimed, a resonant sound that echoed through the palace, a confirmation of his success. <words>187</words>
The absolute dark receded, replaced by a soft, ethereal glow, a testament to the power of the tribal knowledge and Elias’s unwavering hope. <words>203</words>
He stood, weary but resolute, the placid ferocity in his eyes softened by a glimmer of peace. <words>213</words>
The car backfire, a distant memory now, seemed to have occurred in another lifetime, another world. <words>223</words>
In the reimagined ancient Persian palace, within the hush of the night, Elias, the weary undertaker, had held onto hope, imprisoning the darkness with the ancient knowledge of his tribe and the rarely practical astronomical clock. <words>249</words>
He knew this was a temporary reprieve, that the darkness would return, but for now, he had found solace in the light, a fragile victory in the ongoing battle against the absolute dark. <words>273</words>
He looked at the astronomical clock, its intricate workings a testament to the enduring power of hope, a beacon in the hush of the night. <words>289</words>
The clock ticked on, placidly ferocious, a constant reminder of the sun's journey, and Elias's own. <words>300</words>
He knew he would continue to follow the sun paths, imprisoning the shadows, holding onto hope in the absolute dark, for as long as the clock ticked, and for as long as his heart beat. <words>322</words>
