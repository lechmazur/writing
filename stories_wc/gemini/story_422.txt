The selectively mute ventriloquist, Barnaby, bounced on the shimmering turquoise sand of the parallel universe beach, a cardboard coffee sleeve clutched in his hand like a sacred relic. <words>20</words>
He’d salvaged it from the diner on the corner, after the last call, its faint coffee aroma a grounding scent in this surreal world. <words>34</words>
Barnaby was hopelessly optimistic that this sleeve, somehow, would help him archive the peculiar weather patterns of this dimension – swirling lavender clouds that rained sugared plums and a sun that sang opera. <words>55</words>
His euphoria was tinged with agitation; he hadn’t yet figured out *how* the sleeve would achieve this meteorological miracle. <words>66</words>
He’d come to this beach, a place where the very air hummed with possibility, seeking a new kind of family. <words>77</words>
His old family, bless their cotton socks, hadn’t understood his mute pronouncements through Mr. Snuggles, his sock puppet companion. <words>89</words>
They’d patronized him, their pity a suffocating blanket. <words>93</words>
Here, on this beach, he hoped to find kindred spirits, people who wouldn’t flinch at Mr. Snuggles’ pronouncements on the socio-political implications of sugared plum precipitation. <words>111</words>
He’d learned much about the beach’s inhabitants through accidental overheard phone calls. <words>118</words>
Apparently, a group of sentient seashells debated philosophy with passing seagulls, and a colony of sand crabs held weekly poetry slams. <words>131</words>
Barnaby, through Mr. Snuggles, whispered, “This is it. <words>136</words>
My people.” <words>138</words>
He tucked the coffee sleeve into Mr. Snuggles’ tiny pocket, a symbol of his past life, a reminder of the loneliness he was leaving behind. <words>154</words>
He’d overheard a particularly intriguing conversation between a hermit crab and a starfish about the upcoming sand crab poetry slam. <words>167</words>
Apparently, the theme was “Existential Dread in a World of Sugared Plums.” <words>174</words>
Barnaby, his heart thrumming with euphoric agitation, knew he had to attend. <words>181</words>
He imagined himself, finally understood, finally accepted, reciting a poem through Mr. Snuggles about the cardboard coffee sleeve, a metaphor for the comforting banality of his old life juxtaposed against the exhilarating strangeness of this new one. <words>212</words>
He’d explain how the sleeve, in its simple, earthly way, represented the family he’d lost and the family he hoped to find. <words>226</words>
He’d redefine family, not by blood, but by shared wonder, by a mutual appreciation for the absurd. <words>238</words>
He’d patronize those who couldn’t see the beauty in a singing sun or the philosophical depth of a seashell. <words>249</words>
He’d patronize them with the gentle, yet firm, pronouncements of Mr. Snuggles, his voice echoing across the shimmering turquoise sand, carried on the lavender-scented breeze. <words>268</words>
He took a deep breath, the sugared plum-tinged air filling his lungs, and started towards the sound of clicking claws and rhyming couplets, ready to embrace his new, wonderfully weird family. <words>289</words>
The cardboard coffee sleeve, nestled securely in Mr. Snuggles’ pocket, felt warm against his hand. <words>298</words>
It was a reminder, not of what he had lost, but of the infinite possibilities that lay ahead. <words>308</words>
He smiled, a genuine, unadulterated smile that stretched across his face, a smile that reflected the euphoric agitation bubbling within him. <words>323</words>
He was home. <words>325</words>
