The glacial orchard, suspended precariously over a crevasse of blue ice, shimmered in the perpetual twilight. <words>14</words>
After the last human had set foot on earth, the trees, once heavy with frost-kissed fruit, now bore only memories. <words>28</words>
The guarded druid, Elara, fiercely ambivalent about the whole affair, began to gather the fallen, icy petals for a special family meal, one prepared only on birthdays. <words>47</words>
It was hers, though the concept of celebration felt alien in this silent, frozen world. <words>57</words>
Her family, the grove itself, wouldn't speak, wouldn't sing, wouldn't even rustle a leaf in acknowledgement. <words>69</words>
Elara’s crippling fear, the silence, had choked the orchard for centuries. <words>76</words>
She clutched a dull safety pin, a relic from the before-times, its point digging into her palm. <words>86</words>
It was a reminder, a tiny, sharp nudge against the vast, echoing quiet. <words>94</words>
This birthday ritual, the meal of gathered petals, was her attempt, year after agonizing year, to break the silence. <words>107</words>
To overcome her fear. <words>109</words>
To coax a whisper, a sigh, anything from the frozen hearts of her kin. <words>118</words>
“It’s… it’s my birthday,” she muttered, her voice a brittle crack in the glacial air. <words>127</words>
The silence hung heavy, unbroken. <words>130</words>
A dour amusement flickered in Elara’s eyes. <words>135</words>
“Another year, another meal of ice,” she said, a wry twist to her lips. <words>143</words>
She arranged the petals on a flat, icy rock, the dull safety pin glinting beside them. <words>153</words>
It was a pathetic offering, she knew, but it was all she had. <words>160</words>
All she could manage in the face of her overwhelming fear. <words>167</words>
“Perhaps,” she whispered, her voice barely audible above the creak of the ice, “perhaps next year.” <words>177</words>
She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and began to hum a tune from the before-times, a melody she’d pieced together from fragmented memories. <words>194</words>
The tune, shaky and uncertain at first, gradually gained strength, echoing faintly through the glacial orchard. <words>205</words>
A single petal, dislodged by a breath of wind she hadn’t felt in centuries, drifted down and landed on the safety pin. <words>218</words>
Elara opened her eyes, a flicker of something akin to hope warming her face. <words>226</words>
The silence remained, but it felt… different. <words>230</words>
Lighter, somehow. <words>232</words>
Fragile. <words>233</words>
As if, just if, a crack had appeared in its icy surface. <words>240</words>
Elara smiled, a genuine smile, the first in centuries. <words>245</words>
The dour amusement remained, but now it was tinged with a quiet, determined joy. <words>254</words>
She continued to hum, the melody weaving through the orchard, a fragile promise in the frozen air. <words>265</words>
The silence hadn't been broken, not entirely, but it had shifted. <words>272</words>
And that, for Elara, was enough. <words>275</words>
For now.
