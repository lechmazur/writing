The stoic wanderer, mesmerizingly bland in his dust-coated cloak, arrived at the witch’s familiar training ground just as the teacher wiped the final chalk formula from a slate board. <words>20</words>
The air, thick with the residue of half-formed spells and phantom claws, crackled with a brash tenderness. <words>30</words>
He had followed a trail of nightmares, visions of twisted rituals and arcane symbols, to this place. <words>40</words>
His motivation was simple: to archive these ritual practices, to preserve them, even if it meant imposing his will upon the secrecy of the witches. <words>54</words>
He knew the necessary lies he would have to tell, the bland persona he would have to maintain to gain their trust. <words>66</words>
He approached the teacher, his face an unreadable mask. <words>71</words>
"I seek knowledge," he stated, his voice as flat and weathered as the floorboard he carried, salvaged from an abandoned cabin deep in the whispering woods. <words>85</words>
The teacher, a woman with eyes like chips of obsidian, raised an eyebrow. <words>92</words>
"Knowledge is not given, it is earned," she replied, her voice a low growl. <words>99</words>
He offered the floorboard. <words>101</words>
"A piece of history," he said, "in exchange for a glimpse into yours." <words>108</words>
The teacher’s gaze softened, a flicker of curiosity replacing the suspicion. <words>116</words>
She took the floorboard, running a finger along its splintered edge. <words>123</words>
"Interesting," she murmured, a brash tenderness creeping into her voice. <words>129</words>
"Tell me, wanderer, what nightmares led you here?" <words>134</words>
He began to weave his tale, a tapestry of necessary lies interwoven with fragments of truth, carefully crafted to pique her interest without revealing his true purpose. <words>152</words>
He spoke of haunted forests and forgotten gods, of rituals whispered in the dead of night. <words>161</words>
He imposed his narrative upon the training ground, subtly shifting the atmosphere, making it his own. <words>171</words>
The teacher listened, mesmerized by his bland delivery, the very ordinariness of his voice amplifying the strangeness of his story. <words>184</words>
As he spoke, he memorized the lingering traces of the erased formula on the slate, etching them into his mind. <words>196</words>
He knew that archiving these practices meant preserving a dangerous power, but he believed it was a necessary lie, a necessary risk to protect the world from the forces that lurked in the shadows. <words>220</words>
The teacher, caught in the web of his mesmerizingly bland narrative, agreed to teach him. <words>229</words>
She saw in him a kindred spirit, someone driven by a thirst for knowledge, however unconventional his methods. <words>241</words>
The stoic wanderer, clutching the now insignificant floorboard, smiled inwardly. <words>249</words>
He had gained access to the witch's secrets, a brash tenderness blooming in his heart, a tenderness for the knowledge he would soon possess, and the lies he had told to obtain it. <words>274</words>
