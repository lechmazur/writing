The groggy brewer, a uniquely generic man in stained overalls, stood among the crooked headstones of the haunted mansion graveyard. <words>14</words>
The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and brewing discontent, a lull in the protest settling over the crowd like a shroud. <words>28</words>
He clutched a piece of a broken mirror, its jagged edge reflecting the grey sky, a sliver of the encroaching darkness visible in its depths. <words>41</words>
He needed to initiate change, to become a living embodiment of his values, however hazy they were after a night of particularly strong ale. <words>56</words>
His method? <words>57</words>
Via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase leading down into the mansion's crypt. <words>68</words>
"Right, then," he mumbled, his flippant solemnity echoing in the sudden quiet. <words>75</words>
The returning murmur of the gathering protesters seemed to spur him on. <words>82</words>
He stumbled towards the staircase, his gaze fixed on a patch of mildew just a shade darker than the surrounding grime. <words>94</words>
"For the ale!" he slurred, raising the broken mirror like a toast. <words>100</words>
The encroaching darkness seemed to pulse in response, the shadows lengthening around him. <words>108</words>
He took a deep breath, the musty air filling his lungs. <words>114</words>
This discoloration, this utterly unremarkable blemish on an otherwise unremarkable staircase, was his starting point. <words>126</words>
It was his Everest, his Rubicon, his slightly-darker-than-average patch of mildew. <words>136</words>
He placed his foot on the first step, the dust puffing around his worn boot. <words>144</words>
The broken mirror trembled in his hand, reflecting the growing unease in his eyes. <words>153</words>
The lull in the protest was ending, the voices rising again, a wave of sound crashing against the graveyard walls. <words>165</words>
He descended, one step at a time, the encroaching darkness swirling around him like a drunken dance partner. <words>176</words>
He was a groggy brewer on a mission, a uniquely generic man in a haunted mansion graveyard, initiating a change he didn't quite understand. <words>191</words>
His flippant solemnity was a shield against the fear creeping into his heart. <words>199</words>
The piece of broken mirror, a symbol of his fractured purpose, glinted in the fading light. <words>209</words>
The slightest discoloration on the dusty spiral staircase, his chosen path to becoming the living embodiment of his values, beckoned him downwards. <words>224</words>
The encroaching darkness welcomed him with open arms, or perhaps it was just the shadows playing tricks in the dim light of the crypt. <words>239</words>
He wasn't sure, and frankly, he wasn't entirely sober enough to care. <words>247</words>
He just kept descending, one uniquely generic step at a time, into the flippant solemnity of his self-proclaimed destiny. <words>260</words>
The protest raged on outside, oblivious to the groggy brewer's descent into the encroaching darkness. <words>270</words>
