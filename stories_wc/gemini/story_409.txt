The bruised fighter, ribs aching, stumbled through the dusty attic. <words>10</words>
Clockwork monkeys chattered silently from atop dusty shelves, their gears frozen mid-motion. <words>20</words>
He was skillfully incompetent, a master of losing gracefully, a connoisseur of defeat. <words>30</words>
At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, a tremor ran through the attic, shaking loose a clay pot shard. <words>44</words>
It landed at his feet, inscribed with a language he didn't understand, yet somehow knew. <words>54</words>
It spoke of standing for something, of fighting for more than just the next fall. <words>64</words>
He had to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, the comforting lie that he was simply unlucky. <words>76</words>
He picked up the shard, its rough edges digging into his bruised knuckles. <words>84</words>
The inscription pulsed with a faint warmth. <words>88</words>
He knew what he had to do. <words>91</words>
He had to abduct the sculptor, steal him away through forgotten dreams, before the first chip of marble could define his destiny. <words>108</words>
The fighter closed his eyes, focusing on the sculptor, visualizing his workshop, the smell of dust and sweat, the rhythmic clang of the chisel. <words>127</words>
He delved into the sculptor's mind, searching for the unguarded pathways of sleep, the half-remembered landscapes of forgotten dreams. <words>144</words>
He found a memory of a childhood lullaby, a melody woven into the fabric of the sculptor's subconscious. <words>157</words>
He hummed the tune, a discordant, bruised melody, twisting it into a key that unlocked the sculptor's dream. <words>170</words>
The attic shimmered, the clockwork animals blurring into phantoms. <words>176</words>
He stepped into the sculptor's dream, a world of swirling marble dust and half-formed figures. <words>186</words>
The sculptor stood before his block of marble, chisel poised, a flicker of doubt in his eyes. <words>197</words>
The fighter approached, his bruised face a mask of grim determination. <words>204</words>
He reached out, not to harm, but to guide, to pull the sculptor away from the predetermined path, the life carved in stone. <words>221</words>
He whispered words of defiance, of choosing one's own battles, of standing for something more than the applause of the crowd. <words>236</words>
The sculptor hesitated, the chisel trembling in his hand. <words>241</words>
He looked at the fighter, saw the raw honesty in his bruised eyes, the conviction born of countless defeats. <words>254</words>
He lowered the chisel. <words>256</words>
The dream shifted, the marble dissolving into mist. <words>260</words>
The fighter led the sculptor away, through the labyrinthine corridors of forgotten dreams, towards a future yet unwritten. <words>275</words>
He clutched the clay pot shard, a tangible reminder of the choice he had made, the stand he had taken. <words>288</words>
He was still bruised, still skillfully incompetent, but he was no longer a connoisseur of defeat. <words>300</words>
He was a fighter, standing for something more than the next fall. <words>307</words>
The attic solidified around him, the clockwork animals still frozen, but the air felt different, charged with possibility. <words>322</words>
The sculptor was gone, abducted not by force, but by the quiet strength of a bruised fighter who had finally found something worth fighting for. <words>341</words>
The moment the sculptor’s chisel would have struck the marble had passed, replaced by the echo of a forgotten lullaby and the whisper of a new beginning. <words>361</words>
