Bartholomew, a small-time con artist unusually normal for the dystopian farm they called “Hope’s Last Acre,” felt the familiar lull of remorse creeping in. <words>20</words>
During story time, a ritual meant to comfort the farmhands after a day of back-breaking labor, Bartholomew found himself staring at an empty tape dispenser. <words>35</words>
It was a relic from a bygone era, a time when stories came on spools, not piped directly into their dreams by the Overseer. <words>47</words>
The Overseer’s stories, however, offered no solace, only a saccharine vision of a world that never existed. <words>56</words>
Bartholomew’s scams, petty as they were – a swapped ration card here, a diluted nutrient paste there – were his own small rebellion against this manufactured reality. <words>71</words>
But tonight, the usual thrill was absent, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. <words>77</words>
He needed to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, to reclaim his usual bravado. <words>85</words>
His method? <words>86</words>
Interrogating ghostly apparitions. <words>88</words>
Not literal ghosts, of course, but the phantom memories of his marks, their faces contorted in surprise, anger, then grudging admiration. <words>102</words>
He conjured them now, in the flickering candlelight of the communal hall, cross-examining their spectral forms. <words>111</words>
“Old Man Hemlock,” Bartholomew whispered, picturing the farmer’s bewildered face after Bartholomew had sold him a “self-filling” water bucket. <words>124</words>
“Did you truly believe such a thing existed?” <words>128</words>
The phantom Hemlock sputtered indignantly, a silent accusation. <words>133</words>
Bartholomew chuckled, a mild fervor rising within him. <words>138</words>
“And you, Mrs. Abernathy,” he continued, summoning the image of the cook who had bought his “miracle fertilizer” – nothing more than ground-up rocks. <words>154</words>
“Did your tomatoes grow any larger?” <words>157</words>
A spectral scoff. <words>159</words>
Bartholomew’s grin widened. <words>161</words>
These phantom interrogations, absurd as they were, offered a strange comfort. <words>168</words>
They reminded him of his agency, his ability to disrupt, however briefly, the monotonous rhythm of Hope’s Last Acre. <words>180</words>
They were a testament to his wit, his resilience, his refusal to be swallowed whole by the Overseer’s fabricated utopia. <words>193</words>
The lull of remorse receded, replaced by a familiar spark of mischief. <words>200</words>
He picked up the empty tape dispenser, turning it over in his hands. <words>207</words>
An idea began to form, a new scheme, a new con. <words>213</words>
He would sell them… silence. <words>216</words>
A moment of pure, unadulterated quiet, a precious commodity in a world saturated with the Overseer’s voice. <words>228</words>
He would package it in the empty tape dispenser, label it “The Sound of Freedom,” and watch the fools line up to buy it. <words>241</words>
The jaws of defeat were still there, but Bartholomew was grinning, ready to taunt them once more. <words>250</words>
The mild fervor in his heart grew into a warm glow of anticipation. <words>258</words>
Story time was almost over, and a new story was about to begin. <words>265</words>
Bartholomew's story. <words>267</words>
