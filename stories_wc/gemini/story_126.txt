The shipwrecked merchant, stranded not at sea but amongst the stars, stared out at the desolate void from the space station observation deck. <words>20</words>
After the last tree fell, the grand illusion of nature's permanence had shattered, leaving only the cold, hard reality of space and its attendant melancholies. <words>36</words>
He felt an aloof passion ignite within him, a rebellious spark against the manufactured serenity of the station. <words>47</words>
He wanted to shatter this grand illusion too, this pretense of life continuing as normal in the sterile confines of metal and recycled air. <words>61</words>
His gaze fell upon a rustic butter churn, honestly strange in its out-of-place domesticity, sitting abandoned in a corner. <words>73</words>
It was a relic of a time when butter was churned, not synthesized, a time when trees still breathed and the earth still spun green beneath a vibrant sky. <words>90</words>
He felt a pull towards it, a connection to a past he had only read about in dusty datascrolls. <words>100</words>
He needed to ascend, to break free from the oppressive calm of the observation deck. <words>109</words>
His eyes landed on a flaking travel poster advertising a long-abandoned "Earth Resort" â€“ a ghost station orbiting a dead planet. <words>123</words>
The poster, peeling at the edges, was affixed to a service hatch leading upwards. <words>130</words>
He approached the poster, the aloof passion burning brighter within him. <words>138</words>
He gripped the flaking edges of the travel poster in the ghost station's observation deck. <words>147</words>
The paper tore easily in his hand, revealing the rusted metal of the hatch beneath. <words>156</words>
He pulled, and with a groan of protesting metal, the hatch opened. <words>164</words>
He began to ascend, via the flaking edges of the travel poster, pulling himself up into the dark, unknown space beyond. <words>176</words>
The rustic butter churn, a symbol of a lost world, remained below, a silent witness to his rebellious act. <words>188</words>
He climbed, hand over hand, the poster disintegrating beneath his grip, leaving a trail of faded blue and green, the colors of a forgotten Earth. <words>204</words>
He didn't know what awaited him above, but he knew he couldn't stay in the sterile, manufactured peace of the observation deck. <words>219</words>
He had to break free, to find his own truth, even if it meant embracing the unknown, the honestly strange reality of a universe devoid of trees, a universe where a rustic butter churn felt like a sacred artifact. <words>248</words>
As he climbed higher, the space station's artificial gravity weakened, and he felt a sense of weightlessness, a sense of liberation. <words>262</words>
He was ascending not just physically, but spiritually, shedding the grand illusion of normalcy, embracing the rebellious spark within, and venturing into the honestly strange vastness of a post-tree world. <words>286</words>
He was a shipwrecked merchant, sailing not on seas, but on the currents of his own aloof passion, searching for a new shore in the star-strewn wreckage of the old. <words>304</words>
