The reaver, a charmingly grotesque figure with mismatched eyes and a smile like a chipped teacup, sat hunched beneath a kaleidoscope tree, its branches dripping with iridescent leaves. <words>20</words>
Before the first lie had ever tainted the world, before deceit had even a name, he was already weary, a closed-off creature in a world bursting with nascent innocence. <words>38</words>
He unfolded a crumpled piece of paper, a child’s drawing of a lopsided sun and a grinning moon, their rays intertwined. <words>49</words>
His own father had given him a similar drawing, generations ago, under this very tree, the same mocking affection twisting his lips. <words>61</words>
The reaver sighed, the sound like dry leaves skittering across cobblestones. <words>66</words>
He pulled out a stub of charcoal and began to write in the margins of the drawing, his spidery script filling the white spaces with a scrawled poem. <words>80</words>
“Reach for the stars, little sprout,” he wrote, the words a gentle nag, echoing the poems his father had written for him. <words>90</words>
“But don’t be surprised when they burn your fingers.” <words>94</words>
He knew the generational pattern, the inherited yearning to taste the stars in a single kiss, the inevitable disappointment that followed. <words>107</words>
He knew the sweetness of the dream, the bitterness of the awakening. <words>114</words>
“They’re beautiful from afar,” he continued, his charcoal scratching against the paper, “but cold, cold fire up close.” <words>125</words>
He folded the drawing, the creases deepening the lines of the child’s innocent creation, mirroring the lines etched into his own face. <words>137</words>
He knew he was a broken link in a chain of yearning, each generation reaching for the unattainable, each generation falling short. <words>150</words>
He nagged, not to discourage, but to prepare, to temper the fire of youthful hope with the cold reality of experience. <words>162</words>
He wanted the child to reach for the stars, but he also wanted them to survive the burn. <words>170</words>
He tucked the drawing into his worn leather satchel, a repository of crumpled dreams and scrawled warnings, a testament to the enduring power of generational patterns. <words>184</words>
He rose, his joints creaking like the branches of the kaleidoscope tree, and walked away, leaving the dappled light and shadow behind. <words>196</words>
He knew the child would find the poem, would decipher the mocking affection hidden within the lines. <words>206</words>
He knew the child would still reach for the stars, driven by the same insatiable hunger that had consumed generations before. <words>219</words>
And he knew, with a bittersweet pang, that the cycle would continue, the yearning, the reaching, the burning, the knowing. <words>230</words>
He hoped, perhaps foolishly, that this time, just this once, the stars might offer a taste of their celestial fire without the accompanying pain. <words>244</words>
He hoped that this child, armed with the wisdom of generations past, might find a way to bridge the gap between dream and reality, to finally capture the starlight in a single, perfect kiss. <words>265</words>
But even as he hoped, he knew, deep down, that the stars were cold, distant things, and that some patterns, no matter how charmingly grotesque, were destined to repeat themselves. <words>283</words>
