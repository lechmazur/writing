She perched precariously on a rusted pipe within the invisible ink factory, a relic of a forgotten age between vanishing stars. <words>31</words>
The air hung thick with the scent of something not quite there, a phantom aroma of chemicals that once gave form to secrets. <words>44</words>

Elara, the feral sky nomad, effortlessly complicated in her methods, continued her vigil between vanishing stars, sculpting new paths for her people’s music by the sound of a leaf falling. <words>272</words>
