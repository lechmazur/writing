In the hush of a simmering future, the secret agent headquarters hummed with a low, anxious thrum. <words>14</words>
An insecure advisor, Elias, paced the sterile corridor, his footsteps echoing the hollowness of his conviction. <words>24</words>
He was chasing a rumor, a whisper beyond all reason, of a dreamer's calling so potent it could rewrite reality. <words>36</words>
The calling, clearly ambiguous in its nature and origin, gnawed at Elias, amplifying his inherent insecurities. <words>47</words>
He stopped before a reinforced steel door, its keypad dark and unresponsive. <words>54</words>
Beyond lay the abandoned wing, a relic of a failed project, where the rumor claimed the calling originated. <words>65</words>
Elias’s hand trembled as he punched in the override code, the metallic clicks echoing like gunshots in the tense silence. <words>76</words>
Inside, dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through grimy windows, illuminating rows of abandoned equipment. <words>86</words>
At the far end, on a metal table, sat a brain in a jar, its pinkish-grey surface swirling with faint electrical activity. <words>98</words>
A label affixed to the jar read simply: “Duplicate.” <words>102</words>
The echo of his own footsteps in the abandoned place seemed to mock Elias, amplifying the rumor's absurdity. <words>113</words>
Yet, he felt drawn to the jar, to the clearly ambiguous promise it represented. <words>120</words>
Was this the source of the dreamer's calling? <words>125</words>
Could this duplicate brain hold the key to reshaping reality? <words>131</words>
Doubt warred with desperate hope, fracturing the idyll of his carefully constructed world. <words>140</words>
He approached the table, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. <words>148</words>
The fractured idyll of the headquarters, once a symbol of order and control, now felt like a crumbling facade. <words>159</words>
He picked up a discarded syringe, its needle glinting ominously in the dim light. <words>167</words>
Driven by a desperate need for validation, for something to solidify the clearly ambiguous whispers, Elias jabbed the needle through the jar's rubber seal. <words>182</words>
He injected a dose of experimental stimulant directly into the duplicate brain, hoping to trigger a response, a sign, anything to confirm the rumor and quiet the gnawing insecurity that threatened to consume him. <words>203</words>
The brain pulsed, the electrical activity intensifying, bathing the room in an eerie glow. <words>211</words>
Elias watched, mesmerized, as the fractured idyll of his reality began to unravel, replaced by something new, something terrifying, something undeniably connected to the dreamer's calling. <words>230</words>
The echo of his jab, amplified by the silence of the abandoned wing, reverberated through the secret agent headquarters, a harbinger of the chaotic future that was about to unfold. <words>248</words>
The insecure advisor, driven by a rumor beyond all reason, had unleashed a power he could neither understand nor control, forever shattering the fractured idyll of his world. <words>266</words>
The dreamer's calling, once a whisper, now roared. <words>270</words>
