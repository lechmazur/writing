<story>Bartholomew Buttonsby, the understudy sorcerer, bobbed his head obnoxiously politely as the salt crystal growing chamber hummed around him. <words>16</words> Amid the rhythmic slosh and churn of laundry cycles, the air crackled with the nascent magic of growing crystals and the faint, salty tang of the sea. <words>34</words> Bartholomew clutched a small cardboard box, its plain exterior belying the extraordinary device within. <words>44</words> He was on a mission to track cultural evolution, a pursuit that had led him to this peculiar, vibrating locale. <words>56</words>

His current theory posited that cultural shifts could be predicted by eavesdropping on the whispers of an ancient oak grove, a place said to hold the echoes of forgotten stories and nascent ideas. <words>78</words>  But the grove’s whispers were notoriously elusive, easily hindered by mundane noises. <words>85</words> Hence, Bartholomew’s presence in the salt crystal growing chamber, amid the laundry cycles. <words>93</words> The rhythmic vibrations, he’d reasoned, created a perfect sonic mask, allowing him to isolate the grove’s subtle murmurs. <words>105</words>

He opened the box, revealing a tangle of wires and glowing runes, a device designed to amplify and translate the whispers. <words>117</words>  A playful dread tickled his spine. <words>121</words> What forgotten lore, what nascent anxieties, would he unearth? <words>127</words> He activated the device, and a low hum filled the chamber, blending with the sloshing laundry. <words>137</words>  Static crackled, then a voice, faint and rustling, like leaves in a gentle breeze, whispered, “Spin cycle complete.” <words>149</words>

Bartholomew blinked. <words>150</words> “Excuse me?” he said, obnoxiously polite even to disembodied voices. <words>157</words>  “Fabric softener dispensed,” the voice continued, its tone devoid of any ancient wisdom. <words>165</words> Bartholomew frowned. <words>166</words>  It seemed the laundry cycles, intended to hinder unwanted noise, were, in fact, hindering his access to the grove’s whispers. <words>180</words>  He’d inadvertently tuned into the internal monologue of the sentient laundry system. <words>189</words>

A wave of playful dread washed over him. <words>194</words>  He had woken the unheard, alright, but not the whispers of ancient oaks. <words>203</words> He had woken the spirit of the laundry room, and it had a lot to say about optimal wash temperatures and the importance of separating whites and colors. <words>222</words> Bartholomew sighed, obnoxiously polite to the very end. <words>228</words> “Fascinating,” he murmured, packing up his device. <words>232</words>  Perhaps cultural evolution could wait. <words>235</words> He had a sudden, inexplicable urge to re-sort his laundry. <words>241</words>  And perhaps, just perhaps, offer the laundry spirit a small box of detergent as a peace offering. <words>252</words> After all, one never knew when an obnoxiously polite sorcerer might need a favor from a sentient washing machine. <words>265</words> The playful dread remained, now tinged with the faint, soapy scent of domesticity. <words>274</words>
