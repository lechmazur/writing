A harsh wind whipped through the calligraphy master’s courtyard, tugging at the faded tapestry fragment clinging precariously to the crumbling wall. <words>17</words>
The arrogant swordsman, Ryo, stood doubtfully confident, his hand resting on the hilt of his katana. <words>27</words>
He had come to authorize the impossible, to deliver a spark where all lights had gone out. <words>38</words>
His family, once renowned for their bladework, was now a flickering ember, their potential shackled by doubt and defeat. <words>50</words>
Ryo’s eyes, mirroring the faded blues and greens of the tapestry, darted between the assembled elders, their faces etched with weary resignation. <words>62</words>
He knew they saw him as little more than a brash youth, clinging to the tattered remnants of their former glory. <words>73</words>
Between breaths, a decision solidified within him, sharp and cold as winter steel. <words>80</words>
He wouldn’t plead, wouldn’t bargain. <words>83</words>
He would remind them of who they were, of the fire that still smoldered beneath the ashes. <words>93</words>
He straightened, his doubt momentarily banished by a surge of harsh tenderness. <words>100</words>
“I will not ask for your permission,” he declared, his voice ringing with unexpected authority. <words>109</words>
“I will remind you of our oath.” <words>113</words>
He closed his eyes, drawing a deep breath, and began to sing. <words>119</words>
It was a traditional song, sung at every family wedding, a melody woven with tales of courage and resilience. <words>130</words>
The elders stiffened, their eyes widening in recognition. <words>135</words>
The melody, at first hesitant and thin, grew in strength, echoing the power that lay dormant within them. <words>146</words>
Ryo’s voice, though untrained, carried the weight of generations, each note a testament to their shackled potential. <words>157</words>
The faded tapestry fragment, stirred by the wind and the song, fluttered like a wounded bird, a symbol of their fragile hope. <words>170</words>
As the last note faded, a silence descended upon the courtyard, heavy with unspoken emotion. <words>179</words>
Then, one by one, the elders began to nod, their eyes gleaming with a rekindled fire. <words>189</words>
The eldest, his voice raspy with age, stepped forward. <words>195</words>
“The boy speaks true,” he said, his gaze fixed on Ryo. <words>201</words>
“Let the training begin.” <words>204</words>
Between breaths, Ryo felt the weight of responsibility settle upon his shoulders, a burden he now willingly embraced. <words>216</words>
He had authorized their resurgence, not with words, but with the echo of their shared past, a spark ignited in the space between breaths, a testament to the harsh tenderness that bound them together. <words>244</words>
The faded tapestry, caught by a sudden gust of wind, unfurled fully, revealing a vibrant scene of warriors in their prime, a reminder of the potential that lay within them, waiting to be unleashed. <words>270</words>
