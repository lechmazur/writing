A forgotten noble, Count Valerius, paced the spontaneous combustion lab, the air thick with the scent of ozone and burnt toast. <words>16</words>
He felt a hollow recklessness gnawing at him, a familiar emptiness that settled between text messages from people who pretended to care. <words>32</words>
He needed to cut through the illusions, the polite lies that fortified the walls of his gilded cage. <words>44</words>
The truth, however mysteriously obvious, was always buried under layers of social niceties. <words>53</words>
Valerius picked up an artificial hummingbird drone, its delicate wings whirring softly. <words>60</words>
It was a frivolous gift from a forgotten admirer, a trinket meant to distract, not illuminate. <words>70</words>
He tossed it aside, the metallic whirring abruptly silenced. <words>76</words>
His gaze fell upon a dusty box overflowing with old ticket stubs â€“ remnants of operas, galas, and exhibitions, each a carefully curated performance of a life he no longer recognized. <words>101</words>
He began to meticulously reassemble the stubs, chronologically, like pieces of a shattered mirror. <words>110</words>
Each ticket was a small moment, a fleeting interaction, a whispered conversation. <words>118</words>
Through their reassembly, he was fortifying his resolve, building a bulwark against the encroaching tide of meaningless pleasantries. <words>131</words>
He saw the gradual erosion of candor in small moments, the slow creep of artifice into his relationships. <words>142</words>
The mysteriously obvious truth revealed itself: he had traded authenticity for acceptance, genuine connection for the hollow echo of social approval. <words>159</words>
The lab, a place dedicated to studying the sudden, inexplicable eruption of flames, became a metaphor for his own internal combustion. <words>175</words>
He felt a flicker of something akin to hope, a spark ignited by the stark honesty of these discarded tickets. <words>188</words>
He picked up the hummingbird drone again, its delicate wings still. <words>195</words>
He would reprogram it, he decided, to deliver messages of brutal honesty, short bursts of candor launched into the suffocating atmosphere of polite society. <words>214</words>
He would start with the Duchess, the one who always inquired about his "well-being" with a vacant smile. <words>225</words>
He would tell her how the emptiness gnawed at him, how the gilded cage suffocated him. <words>235</words>
He would tell her the mysteriously obvious truth, that her concern was as artificial as the hummingbird in his hand. <words>248</words>
He would fortify himself with the candor of these small moments, these shards of truth salvaged from the wreckage of his life. <words>262</words>
The phone buzzed with another incoming text. <words>266</words>
He ignored it, the hollow recklessness replaced by a quiet determination. <words>274</words>
He had a drone to reprogram. <words>277</words>
