Elara, the market spice trader, notoriously blatant in her secrecy, clutched a worn leather-bound book. <words>14</words>
Inside, pressed between brittle pages detailing ancient herbal remedies, lay a single dried crimson bloom, a stark reminder of a life she yearned to reclaim. <words>31</words>
The bird rehabilitation sanctuary, usually a haven of chirps and rustling feathers, held its breath, the air thick with anticipation. <words>44</words>
