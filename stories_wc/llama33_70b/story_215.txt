She had been invited to the facility to participate in a series of experiments aimed at understanding the intersection of science and the paranormal, and she saw this as an opportunity to synthesize her knowledge of the occult with the scientific method, <words>306</words>. Amid dance lessons, which were part of the facility's unorthodox approach to inducing psychic experiences, Emilia found herself drawn to a vintage postcard that one of the researchers had left on a table, its faded image of a mystical forest sparking a sense of wonder within her, <words>456</words>.
