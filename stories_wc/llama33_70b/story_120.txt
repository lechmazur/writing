<story>As a time-looping paramedic, I had grown accustomed to the never-ending cycle of saving lives, only to have the clock reset and start all over again, and I often found myself wandering the desolate quantum tunnel, searching for a way to break the cycle, at the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, when the world seemed to stand still, and all that was left was the sound of my own thoughts, and the faint hum of the tunnel's energy <words>396</words>. The privately public nature of my existence made it difficult for me to form connections with others, as I was always reliving the same moments, and they were always moving forward, leaving me behind, like a weathered fishing lure, worn and faded from years of use, but still holding a glimmer of hope <words>556</words>. My motivation for continuing this cycle was to baptize my nightmares in acceptance, to find a way to heal the unhealed traumas that haunted me, and to learn to nest in the comfort of my own skin, rather than trying to escape the pain through my work <words>686</words>. But it wasn't until I heard the sound of a single raindrop, echoing off the walls of the tunnel, that I felt a spark of excitement, a sense of possibility that I had not felt in ages, and I realized that I had been going about this all wrong, trying to force my way through the trauma, rather than letting it wash over me, like the gentle patter of rain <words>806</words>. And so, I stood there, in the quantum tunnel, at the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, feeling the weight of my excitement and boredom, as I waited for the next drop to fall, and the next, and the next, until the sound became a soothing melody, and I felt my heart begin to nest in the stillness, and my mind begin to heal <words>916</words>. As the rain continued to fall, I felt my traumas begin to lift, like a fog burning off in the morning sun, and I knew that I had finally found what I had been searching for, a way to heal, to move forward, and to find peace in the privately public world of my own making <words>1056</words>. And so, I walked out of the quantum tunnel, into a new cycle, one that was filled with hope and possibility, rather than pain and trauma, and I knew that no matter what lay ahead, I would face it with an excited sense of boredom, ready to take on whatever challenges came my way <words>1166</words>. </story>
