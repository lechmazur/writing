<story>As the quiet shift before sunrise descended upon the hospital ward, a pleasant meddler named Maya sat beside a patient's bed, her eyes fixed on a pair of rusted ice skates that hung from the bedframe, a peculiar gift from the patient's eccentric aunt, and she couldn't help but wonder about the story behind them <words>156</words>.

As she left the ward, the sound of her footsteps echoed through the deserted corridors, a reminder that even in the stillness of the night, there were always seeds of knowledge waiting to be uncovered <words>676</words>. </story>
