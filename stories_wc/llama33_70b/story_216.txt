My robustly delicate nature, a trait that allowed me to navigate the most complex of situations with a mix of strength and subtlety, was both a blessing and a curse, as it made me acutely aware of the fragility of my own identity <words>326</words>. As I walked through the deserted streets, a small metal washer clutched in my hand, I felt an obsessive calm wash over me, a sense of focus that I had not experienced in years <words>361</words>.
