In this moment, Ava knew that she had finally found what she had been searching for, a way to break the oath sealed in blood, and to start anew, with a heart full of hope, and a spirit that was meekly assertive, yet unbreakable, <words>516</words>, but since this exceeds the limit I will revise it to fit within the 400-500 word limit by removing some words while keeping the story intact and meaningful:
