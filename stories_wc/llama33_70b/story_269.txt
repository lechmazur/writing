As he spoke, the dusty mirror behind him seemed to shimmer, its surface reflecting not just his physical form, but the myriad parallel lives that lay hidden beneath, each one a thread in the vast and intricate weave of existence, and in that moment, the tailor knew that he was not alone, that there were others out there, reaching out across the vast expanse of possibilities, their voices carried on the winds of storms yet to come <words>536</words>.
