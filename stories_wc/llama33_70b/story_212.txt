<story>As the sun set over the ethereal plains, casting a warm orange glow over the barren landscape, an apocalyptic farmer named Ava stood amidst her makeshift farm, surrounded by rows of peculiar crops that she had spent years breeding from new seeds, each one a testament to her determination to survive in a world ravaged by the last resource war, and she felt an overwhelming sense of restlessness, a yearning to break free from the shackles of a life dictated by the whims of others, a life that had been thrust upon her by the harsh realities of a post-apocalyptic world <words>396</words>.
