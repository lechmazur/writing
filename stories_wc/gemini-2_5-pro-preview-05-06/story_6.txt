Elara, the minstrel whose lute strings vibrated more with cynicism than song, believed in very little, least of all the grand tales of immortal tricksters. <words>23</words> Yet, here she was, at the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, clutching a taunting riddle from Sylas, the very immortal trickster she aimed to out-scheme. <words>49</words> Her motivation wasn't glory, but the burning need to silence the smug, ethereal laughter that echoed in her memories. <words>67</words>

Her search led her to the crumbling shell of a disappearing ink factory, a place where permanence was a forgotten joke. <words>87</words> Inside, amidst the ghostly outlines of forgotten vats, she found it: a single, iridescent dragon-scale armor scrap, glinting with an otherworldly sheen. <words>111</words> It felt impossibly plausible that this tiny relic was her key, a notion that made her scoff even as she pocketed it. <words>134</words> Sylas, she knew, collected such rarities with a greedy, almost childlike obsession, a weakness she intended to exploit. <words>154</words>

Her plan was audacious, bordering on foolish, a true act of reckless generosity with her own safety and the precious scale. <words>177</words> She would not destroy Sylas, for how could she, but she would publicly humiliate him, using his own avarice against him. <words>200</words> She fashioned a simple slingshot from a sturdy pipe cleaner and a rubber band found amidst the factory's detritus. <words>221</words> The target wasn't Sylas himself, but a precarious, ancient bell Sylas had once boasted could only be rung by a "true offering." <words>246</words>

The trickster, drawn by rumors Elara herself had seeded about a "newly discovered" dragon hoard within the factory, appeared as a shimmering distortion near the factory's heart. <words>276</words> Elara waited, hidden, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs, a counterpoint to the factory's eerie silence. <words>296</words> As Sylas, ever the showman, grandly gestured towards an empty space, proclaiming his imminent discovery, Elara took aim. <words>319</words> With a sharp twang, she launched the dragon-scale armor scrap not at him, but towards a specific point above. <words>340</words>

The scale arced perfectly, catching the light, then disappeared into the plume of an ancient steam vent, its hiss suddenly deafening. <words>363</words> For a moment, nothing. <words>367</words> Then, carried via the hiss of an ancient steam vent in an abandoned factory, the scale, now superheated and singing, struck the bell with a resonant clang that echoed through the dilapidated structure and, Elara hoped, far beyond. <words>411</words> Sylas froze, his ethereal form flickering, as the bell's magical chime, amplified by the steam, broadcast not a treasure found, but a fool's errand confirmed by a "true offering" he hadn't made. <words>449</words> He vanished with a shriek of pure, undiluted frustration, leaving Elara amidst the settling dust, a smirk playing on her lips. <words>474</words> Perhaps, she mused, there was a certain irreverent awe to be found in outsmarting the eternal after all. <words>494</words>
