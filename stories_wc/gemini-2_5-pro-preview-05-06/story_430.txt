Kael, a reaver whose heart was a fortress built by generations of distrust, wandered the kaleidoscope park. <words>16</words> Its shifting, luminous geometries were a charmingly grotesque mirror to his own fractured soul. <words>29</words> He clutched a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, a crude sun with too many rays, a relic from a time he barely remembered, a time before the first lie is told. <words>56</words> This was his anchor, and his torment. <words>63</words> His true quest, the one that gnawed at him more than hunger, was to taste the stars in a single kiss, an impossible union he believed would shatter the bitter legacy he inherited. <words>94</words> But he was a closed-off reaver, and directness was a language he’d long forgotten. <words>109</words> Instead, he would nag. <words>113</words> He’d find blank spaces, the margins of memory, the edges of the child’s innocent sun, and there he’d scrawl his poems. <words>134</words>

"Oh, little sun-maker," one began, its letters spiky and uneven, "do you dream of burning bright, or just of not burning out like all the others?" <words>159</words> The mocking affection in his script was a shield for a tenderness he couldn't otherwise express. <words>175</words> He saw the generational patterns in every wilting fractal flower of the park, in every distorted reflection. <words>193</words> "They’ll tell you sweetness lasts," another poem sneered from beside a lopsided stick figure, "but honey rots the teeth, little one, remember that when they offer you the hive." <words>226</words> He wasn't sure who he was warning – the ghost of the child, or the ghost of himself. <words>243</words> Each poem was a tiny, barbed piece of his soul, offered up to the swirling, indifferent beauty of the kaleidoscope park. <words>264</words> He imagined the child, if they ever saw these additions, would find them charmingly grotesque, like a monster trying to sing a lullaby. <words>287</words> The reaver knew this was his only way to fight the silence passed down, to nag the universe into giving him that one stellar moment. <words>314</words> He traced the outline of the drawn sun, his calloused finger smudging the crayon. <words>329</words> "Don't let them steal your sky," he whispered, the words almost a prayer, almost a poem themselves, a desperate plea from a man who only knew how to take, now yearning to give back a warning. <words>368</words> He hoped, with a fierceness that surprised him, that someone, somewhere, would understand his scrawled, bitter love notes to a future he desperately wanted to be different. <words>399</words> For if the stars could be tasted, surely the cycle could be broken, even by a closed-off reaver in a mad park, before the first, inevitable lie poisoned everything. <words>432</words>
