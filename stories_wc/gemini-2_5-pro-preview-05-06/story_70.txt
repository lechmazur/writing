Alistair, a scribe whose spine seemed starched with the same rigidity as his collars, approached the witch’s greenhouse, a vibrant anomaly clinging precariously to a hill of weathered gravestones. <words>29</words> The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something indefinably ancient, felt like a personal affront to his ordered sensibilities, yet a strange, buried optimism flickered within the humid glass panes reflecting the somber sky. <words>66</words> He was here on an official, if unsettling, inquiry, tasked with cataloging the late witch’s peculiar effects. <words>83</words> Inside, among luminous fungi and herbs that whispered secrets in the drafts, Alistair found a dusty, once-sealed envelope tucked beneath a wilting mandrake. <words>109</words> His meticulous nature, usually reserved for ledgers and legal documents, compelled him to examine it closely, leading him to focus on the leftover adhesive. <words>136</words> Nearby, on a workbench cluttered with dried botanicals and strange tools, lay a peculiar glass orb – a prototype light bulb, its filament an intricate, unfamiliar design, rumored to be from Tesla’s own workshop. <words>174</words> Alistair, by meticulously analyzing the leftover adhesive from the envelope, scraping infinitesimal samples onto a slide, discovered traces of a unique pollen, unknown to any botanical text he knew. <words>209</words> He cross-referenced his notes, his gaze darting between the pollen, the strange plants, and the inert Tesla bulb. <words>229</words> It was in that precise moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, a silent click in the universe of his mind: the pollen was from a flower that only bloomed, he hypothesized, under the specific, ethereal light this unique bulb was designed to emit. <words>277</words> He felt certainly uncertain, the foundations of his logical world trembling yet solidifying around a new, astonishing truth. <words>298</words> The witch hadn't been merely dabbling in chaotic charms; she had been cultivating something profound, something requiring scientific marvel and natural wonder in equal measure. <words>328</words> This realization, this quiet transformation beginning within him, cracked through his composure. <words>341</words> A sound tore from Alistair’s throat, not a scream, but a deep, resonant bellow of astonished understanding, echoing amongst the silent gravestones outside. <words>367</words> The witch, he now understood, had been nurturing empathy itself, a fragile bloom in a harsh world, and the bulb was its sun. <words>394</words> His purpose shifted; he would use his own rigid adherence to order, his own arms of steel, not to condemn, but to cradle empathy, to protect this delicate legacy. <words>428</words> The greenhouse, once a place of suspicion, now seemed a sanctuary, and the buried optimism he’d sensed earlier began to tentatively unfurl within his own tightly bound heart. <words>459</words>
