Father Michael, a decidedly rattled exorcist, clutched the worn vintage postcard, its faded ink a stark contrast to the gleaming linoleum of the psychic research facility. <words>26</words> He’d come here, somewhat reluctantly, driven by a deep-seated motivation to entwine science with wonder, to find a logical framework for the inexplicable horrors he’d witnessed. <words>54</words> The facility, however, hummed with an undercurrent of coy aggression, its researchers offering guarded disclosures about their work, their smiles never quite reaching their eyes. <words>81</words> Michael, though inwardly social, found their professional detachment more unnerving than any spectral manifestation. <words>97</words> His current unease was amplified by the thumping bass from the adjacent studio, where obligatory "stress-relief" dance lessons were in full swing, a bizarre counterpoint to his grim purpose. <words>131</words> The postcard, slipped under his door that morning, was clearly the first in a series of puzzles, its cryptic verse hinting at a deeper secret within these walls. <words>162</words> "Where rhythm falters, truth takes its first step," it read, a clue that seemed to mock his two left feet, painfully evident during yesterday's cha-cha. <words>191</words> He needed to synthesize the disparate elements: the facility's strange protocols, the postcard's riddle, and the almost performative cheerfulness of the staff. <words>217</words> The director, Dr. Albright, had been particularly evasive, her polite inquiries feeling more like interrogations. <words>234</words> Michael suspected the puzzles were a test, a way for the facility to gauge his suitability or perhaps to lead him to something they couldn't, or wouldn't, access themselves. <words>267</words> He followed the postcard's clue to the dance studio during a break, the scent of sweat and floor polish thick in the air. <words>291</words> Another puzzle piece, a small, intricately folded note, was tucked inside a loose floorboard precisely where the instructor always demonstrated a particularly difficult turn. <words>320</words> Each solved riddle led to another, a breadcrumb trail of carefully curated information, each step a small victory against the pervasive secrecy. <words>346</words> The final clue, derived from a sequence of dance steps diagrammed on an old flyer, pointed to a specific panel in the facility's archives, a room he hadn't even known existed. <words>382</words> With a trembling hand, he pressed the sequence, and a section of shelving slid silently inward, revealing a hidden room. <words>406</words> Inside, instead of arcane texts or spectral containment units, he found detailed case files, meticulously documenting phenomena nearly identical to his own experiences, but analyzed with a chilling, detached objectivity. <words>444</words> It was the synthesis he’d sought, yet the cold, clinical approach, devoid of any human empathy, left him more rattled than ever, the wonder almost entirely eclipsed by a stark, scientific dread. <words>481</words>
