Elara, a soothsayer whose composure was currently on a rather extended vacation, squinted at the bar top. <words>16</words> "Oh, splendid," she muttered, her voice dripping with molten sarcasm, "another cryptic message from the universe, delivered via stale beer rings." <words>34</words> This particular establishment, a flickering beacon of despair, was nestled deep within a maze of billboards that clawed at the neon-lit desert sky, each one screaming a forgotten promise. <words>61</words> It was the era optimistically, or perhaps idiotically, referred to as 'between lost years,' a societal shrug after the last big oopsie. <words>82</words> Her fingers, trembling slightly – a professional hazard for a mildly panicked soothsayer – traced the overlapping circles on the battered wood. <words>103</words> She was trying to magnify the subtle shifts in their patterns, to read the water rings for some sign, any sign, of how to avert the next, even bigger oopsie. <words>132</words> "Because, naturally, the fate of the world rests on interpreting ancient beverage stains," she added to the empty room. <words>150</words> Her motivation, a desperate, clawing need to shape destiny with bare hands, warred constantly with the sheer absurdity of her methods and the grimness of her visions. <words>178</words> These visions, lately, were all about environmental stewardship, or rather, the spectacular lack thereof, painting futures of dust and desolation. <words>200</words> The chances of actually fixing anything felt, to put it mildly, probably unlikely. <words>214</words> In her pocket, a small, intricately carved puzzle box with thirteen tiny, stubborn locks felt heavier than a dying star. <words>235</words> It had appeared one dust-stormy afternoon, just as her panic had begun to truly blossom, whispered to be a key, though to what, no one quite knew. <words>265</words> "Thirteen locks," she’d sighed then, "because seven, or even a sensible three, would be far too convenient for a species hell-bent on self-immolation." <words>290</words> Each water ring seemed to echo the complexity of those locks, a fractal representation of the planet's interconnected woes. <words>309</words> She needed to see clearer, to understand the sequence, the pressure points, the way to unlock not just the box, but a pathway back from the brink. <words>339</words> "Right, magnify the impending doom, Elara," she told herself, leaning closer, her breath fogging a small patch of the worn surface. <words>360</words> The neon glare from outside pulsed, casting grotesque shadows that danced with the faint images she perceived in the wood grain, images of choked rivers and barren lands. <words>389</words> If she could just decipher this one pattern, this one confluence of spills and time, maybe, just maybe, one of those thirteen locks would yield. <words>416</words> Or maybe she was just a crazy woman in a desert bar, talking to furniture during a global intermission before the final, tragic act. <words>441</words> "Still," she mused, a flicker of something that wasn't entirely panic in her eyes, "got to try, haven't we? Someone has to pretend they know what they're doing." <words>471</words> With a deep breath that tasted of dust and regret, she focused again, determined to wring sense from the senseless, one water ring at a time. <words>499</words>
