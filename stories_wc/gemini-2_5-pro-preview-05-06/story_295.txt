Bram, a sellsword whose joviality was as renowned as his blade, whistled a jaunty tune, though his heart hammered a reluctant rhythm against his ribs. <words>24</words> He stood within the witch Elara’s herb garden, a place of vibrant, unsettling beauty where phosphorescent fungi pulsed with soft light and flowers whispered secrets on the breeze. <words>52</words> A withering vow, sworn in a moment of desperate folly, was slowly claiming him, his skin already taking on a papery, leaf-like texture at the fingertips. <words>79</words> His current, peculiar task was a family tradition: making a time capsule, a method to treasure what truly mattered before the vow consumed him entirely. <words>107</words> He was boldly reluctant, this act a defiant flourish against the encroaching oblivion, a desperate attempt to dethrone the insidious doubt the vow had planted in his mind. <words>139</words> The air thrummed with an elegant mayhem as he knelt, the very soil seeming to writhe with arcane energy throughout his ongoing transformation. <words>165</words> From his worn satchel, he carefully withdrew the primary object for his capsule: his grandfather’s battered astronomical telescope. <words>187</words> It was more than brass and glass; it was a conduit to childhood dreams of exploring distant stars, a stark contrast to his current, earthbound fate. <words>216</words> He’d once used it to chart constellations, now he was charting the slow decay of his own form, a grim irony not lost on his usually cheerful demeanor. <words>247</words> The witch had permitted this strange ritual, her eyes glinting with amusement from the shadows of her crooked cottage, perhaps seeing it as part of the vow's cruel poetry. <words>280</words> As Bram began to dig a shallow hole amidst the belladonna and wolfsbane, his movements were stiffening, the green tinge spreading up his arms. <words>309</words> Each scoop of earth was an effort, a testament to his fading strength, yet his smile, though strained, remained. <words>329</words> He intended to treasure this final act of self-definition, to leave a piece of the man he was, not the blighted thing he was becoming. <words>357</words> The telescope, wrapped in oilskin, was placed gently into the earth, a beacon against the encroaching darkness of his mind and body. <words>383</words> This small rebellion, this act of remembering and preserving, was his way of fighting the despair, of ensuring that even if the vow won, a part of Bram the stargazer, not just Bram the cursed sellsword, would endure. <words>429</words> With the last pat of soil, a tremor ran through him, the elegant mayhem of the garden seeming to intensify as his transformation neared its peak, yet a sliver of peace settled in his fading consciousness. <words>470</words> He had faced the inevitable, not with a roar, but with a cherished memory buried deep, a final, quiet victory to dethrone doubt from his mind, even as the world dissolved. <words>500</words>
