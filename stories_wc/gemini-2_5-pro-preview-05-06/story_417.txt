Brother Thistlewick, his eyes gleaming with a fervent light, adjusted his spectacles, the humid jungle air fogging the lenses as he pored over "The Sacred Symbiosis of Rust and Root" in his surprisingly intact Victorian parlor. <words>34</words> Outside, the jungle pressed in, its vibrant chaos a stark contrast to the faded damask wallpaper, a testament to the unspoken agreements he believed kept the wilderness *mostly* at bay. <words>66</words> He was, by all accounts, an unhinged zealot, his current object of intense study being a rather plain metal bottle cap perched reverently on a velvet cushion. <words>96</words> This cap, he'd proclaimed, was the navel of the New World, the point from which all true understanding would eventually radiate, a belief he held with earnest absurdity. <words>130</words> His current academic pursuit, undertaken during this sweltering afternoon dedicated to studying, was to divine its immediate desires. <words>152</words> "It wishes forâ€¦ liberation," he muttered, a theoretically playful glint in his eye that promised something far more disruptive than mere contemplation. <words>178</words> The unspoken agreements with the jungle felt particularly strained today; a particularly audacious strangler fig tendril had begun to uproot the corner of his prayer rug, inching towards his mahogany lectern. <words>215</words> "An offering is required, a rebalancing," Thistlewick declared to the silent, oppressive heat of the room, his voice a low, conspiratorial hum. <words>239</words> He decided the offending tendril, a verdant symbol of encroaching chaos and perhaps his own internal doubts, must be the one to uproot, not just from the floorboards, but from the very fabric of its insolent existence. <words>280</words> With a grunt and a flourish that was almost a manic dance, he seized the vine, tearing it from its mooring with surprising strength, then flung it out the open window into the verdant, waiting maw of the jungle. <words>323</words> Later that night, as shadows consumed the parlor and the cacophony of unseen creatures formed an overwhelming symphony, Thistlewick knelt before a single, sputtering candle. <words>353</words> He clutched the plain metal bottle cap, its cool, unassuming surface a strange anchor against his fevered palm and racing thoughts. <words>377</words> In a whispered confession in a dark room, addressed to the cap, or perhaps to the suffocating darkness that embodied the jungle's spirit, he spoke of his deepest fear: that his unwavering faith was merely a grand, elaborate game he played against the crushing weight of his own insignificance. <words>436</words> "I am but a hollow vessel," he breathed, tears tracing paths through the grime on his cheeks, "and I pray this emptiness, this utter vulnerability, allows true strength to finally pour into me." <words>471</words> This admission, this raw exposure of his fragile core, was his truest act of devotion, a desperate attempt to find strength in vulnerability, hoping the jungle, the cap, or some listening entity, would finally, truly answer. <words>511</words>
