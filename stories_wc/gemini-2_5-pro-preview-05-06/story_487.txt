Brutus, a man built like a mountain yet possessing the quietude of a mouse, was a docile bruiser by nature. <words>17</words>
His current obsession, however, was anything but quiet: to mold a myth from the mud of reality. <words>32</words>
He’d found the means under the loose floorboards of an abandoned concert hall – a shredded treasure map, its fragments hinting at an artifact of immense power. <words>56</words>
Piecing it together, a painstaking process hampered by faded script in a language he couldn't decipher, was his first challenge. <words>76</words>
The map led him here, to a colossal greenhouse labyrinth, its glass panes sweating in the humid air, stocked with man-eating plants that writhed with a silent, hungry intelligence. <words>109</words>
From somewhere deep within, or perhaps carried on the wind from a nearby festival, throbbed the relentless pulse of drum solos, a disorienting, primal beat. <words>136</words>
Brutus remained disturbingly calm, his massive shoulders relaxed even as a thorny vine snapped near his ear. <words>154</words>
He moved with a brash tenderness, pushing aside carnivorous pitcher plants with a surprisingly gentle hand, his focus absolute. <words>174</words>
The map indicated the prize lay at the labyrinth's heart: a conductor’s baton, rumored to raise the dead. <words>194</words>
He didn't believe in necromancy, not truly, but the story itself, the *potential*, was what he craved to control. <words>215</words>
The language barriers on the map had been frustrating, forcing him to rely on symbols and intuition, much like he navigated the world with his limited words and profound understanding. <words>246</words>
Finally, in a small clearing where the drum solos seemed to echo off the very leaves, he saw it – an obsidian baton resting on a mossy plinth. <words>276</words>
As he reached for it, a colossal Venus flytrap, larger than any he’d yet seen, lunged from the shadows, its maw gaping. <words>299</words>
With a speed that belied his bulk, Brutus didn't flinch; he simply sidestepped. <words>313</words>
He grabbed the baton, not to command the dead, but to command the living, or at least, the legend. <words>332</words>
He gave the baton a sharp twist in his grip, a decisive, almost dismissive gesture. <words>346</words>
Instead of reanimating corpses, a low hum emanated from it, and the aggressive plants around them seemed to recoil, their movements becoming sluggish, almost… respectful. <words>373</words>
The drum solos outside reached a crescendo, then abruptly ceased, as if acknowledging the shift in power. <words>391</words>
Brutus looked at the now-pacified giant flytrap, then at the baton, a faint, almost tender smile playing on his lips. <words>413</words>
He wouldn't tell anyone it controlled plants; he'd let the old myth of raising the dead persist, perhaps even embellish it with his own silent, formidable presence as its new guardian. <words>447</words>
He had molded his myth, not from the dead, but from the vibrant, dangerous life around him, a truth far more potent. <words>471</words>
With a final, gentle pat to the nearest, now docile, carnivorous bloom, he turned to leave, the baton held loosely, his calm absolute. <words>496</words>
