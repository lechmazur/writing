Lord Ashworth, a man more accustomed to pruning roses than defusing bombs, found himself inexplicably assigned to "horticultural duties" at what was clearly a secret agent workshop. <words>26</words> He suspected his influential, and rather exasperated, mother had pulled some strings, hoping a bit of "real world" experience might toughen him up. <words>46</words> Despite his generally yielding nature, Ashworth was unusually perceptive, a trait honed by years of navigating complex social hierarchies with a minimum of fuss. <words>71</words> The workshop, with its oddly shaped rooms and metallic ductwork, acted as a series of echo chambers, and he'd begun to pick up snippets of conversations not meant for his ears through unplanned eavesdropping. <words>106</words> One afternoon, while ostensibly deadheading petunias near a ventilation shaft amid his yard work, he overheard talk of "Project Chimera" and a "failed specimen" â€“ a genetically engineered songbird, now deemed a liability. <words>144</words> A pang of silent empathy, sharp and unexpected, struck Ashworth; he'd always had a soft spot for creatures unable to fend for themselves, his primary motivation now to protect this vulnerable creature. <words>178</words> He knew direct confrontation was out; he was, after all, just the "flower chap." <words>195</words> "Well, this is a pickle, isn't it?" he murmured to a particularly stubborn weed, his tone one of earnest flippancy as he considered his options. <words>220</words> His only potential "weapon" was a dull letter opener he used for severing tough plant stems, a rather pathetic implement for espionage. <words>244</words> The overheard plan was to "dispose" of the bird using a new chemical agent that would, quite literally, liquify organic matter on contact, leaving no trace. <words>274</words> They'd be testing it in Lab 3, a room whose ventilation system, Ashworth had noted from previous eavesdropping in the echo chambers, was notoriously faulty and prone to backdrafts if the main exhaust fan wasn't properly engaged. <words>319</words> He also knew the "specimen" was kept in a small, sealed aviary within Lab 3, awaiting its fate. <words>340</words> During the scheduled "disposal" time, Ashworth, feigning an urgent need to adjust the sprinkler system near Lab 3's external exhaust unit, "accidentally" tripped over the power conduit, yanking it free just as he heard the hiss of the aerosolized agent inside. <words>389</words> He then, with a theatrical sigh of "Oh, botherations!", used his dull letter opener to jimmy open the control panel and subtly cross a few wires he'd observed the technicians fiddling with earlier, ensuring the fan would remain off. <words>432</words> The resulting backdraft, he later heard through the echo chambers (amid much cursing), caused the liquifying agent to aerosolize *within* the sealed control booth where the operatives were observing, rather than in the bird's enclosure. <words>474</words> No one was permanently harmed, thankfully, just subjected to a terrifyingly corrosive mist that ruined their suits and their afternoon, but the bird was spared, later "misplaced" by a suddenly sympathetic junior technician. <words>512</words> Ashworth just smiled, pruning a rose, his silent empathy having found its rather messy, but effective, voice. <words>529</words>
