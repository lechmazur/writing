Elara, the psychic genealogist, sat in the space pirate ship brig, the cold metal seeping into her bones. <16> She idly tossed a pair of dice, one chipped, across the grimy floor, watching them skitter. <30> Each roll was a tiny echo of the grand, chaotic puzzle of destiny she spent her life trying to piece together. <47> Her captors, a boisterous crew with little patience for nuance, wanted her to divine the location of a mythical treasure, a task far removed from her usual, more delicate work. <75> She was, after all, proudly humble, her gifts not for gaudy displays of fortune-telling but for deeper connections. <92> Her true skill lay in her ability to lengthen the threads of ancestry, to trace lineages back through forgotten epochs. <109> She achieved this via the poignant, fragmented diaries left on abandoned bullet trains, relics of civilizations that had risen and fallen like cosmic tides. <134> Each scrawled entry, each faded photograph, was a whisper from the past, helping her reconstruct family trees that stretched across star systems and centuries. <158> This meticulous work was her solace, a way to hush the persistent alarm bells of heartbreak that had chimed since she lost her own beloved, a life cut short despite all her premonitions. <189> The pirates, however, only saw a tool. <195> "Find the Xylos Hoard, witch," Captain Vorlag had growled, his breath smelling of stale grog and impatience. <211> Elara had merely smiled, a flicker of grave playfulness in her eyes. <223> "Destiny, Captain," she'd replied softly, "is not a map to be read, but a tapestry to be understood, thread by painful thread." <246> Now, as the viewport showed the last star beginning to fade into the encroaching morning light of a nearby nebula, she knew her time for contemplation was ending. <274> The chipped die, when she picked it up, felt unusually warm, a familiar thrumming against her palm, a counterpoint to the cold dread she usually associated with foreknowledge. <300> She remembered a particular diary, found on a derelict Martian express, detailing a pirate captain's folly, a lineage cursed by greed—Vorlag's lineage, she now realized with a jolt. <330> Perhaps she couldn't give Vorlag his treasure, but she could certainly lengthen his understanding of his own impending doom, a fate woven into his very bloodline by an ancestor's avarice. <362> It wouldn't bring back her lost love, but the intricate, almost playful justice of it offered a grim satisfaction, a way to momentarily hush the alarm bells of heartbreak. <394> "Captain," she called out, her voice calm yet carrying through the brig's oppressive silence, "I believe I've traced a rather pertinent branch of your family tree, one that ends rather… explosively, near something called the Xylos Hoard." <436> A stunned silence, then a clatter from the guard post, confirmed her throw of the cosmic dice had landed. <455>
