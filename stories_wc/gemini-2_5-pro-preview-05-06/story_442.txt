Kaelen, the edgy tradesman, hunched over his workbench inside the damp, cavernous space of the giant mushroom house. <words>19</words> The air, thick with the scent of mycelium and decay, seemed to press in on him, mirroring the weight of his task. <words>37</words> Outside, the forgotten windmill creaked through its final rotation, each groan a countdown to an uncertain threshold. <words>54</words> "It'll all fade anyway," he muttered, his voice a comfortingly pessimistic rasp that somehow eased the tension in his own shoulders. <words>74</words> He was staring at a torn corner of a flyer, its faded ink hinting at a festival, a face, a promise long since fractured by the relentless distortion of memory. <words>104</words> This fragment was all that remained of a past he desperately needed to anchor, his sole motivation to carry a flickering candle through the endless void that threatened to consume all clarity. <words>139</words> His purpose wasn't naive hope, but a stubborn refusal to let everything dissolve into the same grey mist. <words>158</words>

He needed to vectorize it, to give its ghostly outlines a solid form before the windmill stilled forever and the echoes vanished completely. <words>183</words> On the table lay two old, brass-cased watches, their hands meticulously aligned, ready for the delicate procedure. <words>202</words> The method was precise, almost arcane: via synchronized watches, he would attempt to map the memory's temporal resonance onto a stable framework. <words>228</words> He strapped one watch to his wrist, its cold metal a familiar, grounding pressure against his skin. <words>245</words> The other he placed beside the flyer fragment, a silent partner in this delicate operation against oblivion. <words>263</words> As the windmill groaned its penultimate turn, Kaelen closed his eyes, focusing on the blurry vividness of the image the flyer evoked â€“ a child's laughter, the scent of spiced cider, a fleeting warmth that felt both intensely real and impossibly distant. <words>307</words> The distortion was strong; faces shifted like smoke, colors bled into one another, the joy felt like a phantom limb, an ache for something barely there. <words>336</words>

He began the incantation, a low hum that vibrated through the mushroom's fleshy, bioluminescent walls, his fingers tracing invisible lines in the air, attempting to vectorize the sensation, the scene, the fleeting truth. <words>373</words> The watches ticked in perfect, unwavering unison, a rhythmic anchor against the swirling chaos of recollection. <words>391</words> "It won't be perfect," he reminded himself, the pessimistic mantra a shield against the inevitable disappointment of imperfection. <words>410</words> "Nothing ever is." <words>414</words> The final, shuddering groan of the windmill echoed through the chamber, and then, a profound silence descended, heavy and complete. <words>437</words> Kaelen opened his eyes; the image in his mind was now sharper in places, yet still imbued with that characteristic blurry vividness, a truth captured in its very flawed reconstruction. <words>470</words> The flyer fragment still lay there, unchanged, but the memory it represented now possessed a fragile structure, a vector he could follow. <words>494</words> It was enough. <words>497</words>
