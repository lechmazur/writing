The unsteady sentinel, Kael, haunted the abandoned space freighter docking bay, a lone figure against the vast, echoing emptiness. <words>19</words> Outside, the void shimmered with the terrible beauty of two worlds hurtling towards collision, a cosmic deadline he raced against. <words>39</words> His primary motivation, a burning need to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy, consumed his every waking moment. <words>59</words> With hands that trembled from a coyly furious energy rather than fear, he worked by the dim emergency lights. <words>79</words> His method was painstaking: by reassembling shredded letters, he sought the truth hidden within their fractured script. <words>98</words> A strange automaton bird, its metallic feathers dull in the gloom, perched on a twisted girder, observing him with unblinking optical sensors. <words>124</words> This creature had been the original messenger of the deceitful prophecy, and now it seemed bound to witness its unraveling. <words>146</words> Each reconnected phrase, each deciphered warning, sent a jolt of cheerless ecstasy through Kael’s weary frame. <words>165</words> The prophecy had promised salvation from the impending cataclysm, but Kael increasingly suspected it was the very instrument of the ambush of fate. <words>192</words> The docking bay groaned, a metallic sigh under the immense gravitational stresses heralding the final moments between worlds colliding. <words>214</words> He felt the pressure in his bones, a grim counterpoint to the manic clarity growing within him. <words>233</words> The automaton bird suddenly flitted down, nudging a crucial, almost overlooked scrap of parchment towards his searching fingers. <words>255</words> As Kael smoothed it and fitted it into the larger, reassembled document, the full, chilling message finally coalesced. <words>277</words> It did not offer escape; instead, the reassembled letters began to recommend a perilous journey directly into the heart of the cosmic impact. <words>306</words> The old words had been a lure, a path to annihilation disguised as sanctuary, designed to ensure no one survived the collision. <words>332</words> A harsh laugh, devoid of mirth yet filled with a wild elation, escaped Kael’s lips; the cheerless ecstasy was complete. <words>355</words> He understood now the prophecy wasn't merely misguided; it was a malevolent design, and he had just unarmed it. <words>377</words> The unsteady sentinel straightened, his earlier tremor replaced by a steely resolve, his fury no longer coy but a blazing certainty. <words>402</words> The automaton bird tilted its head, its internal mechanisms whirring softly, as if awaiting a new directive now that the truth was bare. <words>430</words> "They wanted us to flee into a trap," Kael stated, his voice resonating with newfound power, "but we will face it." <words>453</words> He would recommend this new, terrifying path to any who might still listen, a desperate gamble against the orchestrated doom. <words>476</words>
