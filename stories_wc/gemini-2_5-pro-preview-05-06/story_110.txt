The water clock repair shop, "Temporal Fixations," was Elara’s current sanctuary, a place where the only deadlines were dripping ones. <words>19</words> She, a hidden assassin currently enjoying a self-imposed sabbatical – a period she privately termed ‘between chapters’ – found the rhythmic plink-plonk of water a soothing counterpoint to less rhythmic demises. <words>48</words> Elara considered herself quietly flamboyant; today, it was the single, perfectly preserved raven feather tucked into her otherwise severe bun. <words>68</words> Her true art, however, lay not in the silent dispatch of problematic individuals, but in her motivation to transmute pain – theirs, mostly, a little of her own – into a masterpiece of remembrance. <words>101</words> She achieved this through bleak eulogies that mention hidden truths, little verbal monuments she’d construct for each subject, known only to her. <words>126</words>

A new client, Mrs. Periwinkle, waddled in, clutching a tarnished silver water clock shaped like a weeping willow, its delicate mechanisms seized. <words>149</words> "It belonged to my late husband, Bartholomew," she sighed, her voice a symphony of saccharine sorrow that Elara’s internal lie-detector flagged immediately. <words>173</words> This, Elara mused with despairing humor, was the delightful appetizer to another domestic mystery. <words>188</words> Bartholomew, according to the ensuing monologue, was a saint, a pillar, a man who wouldn't harm a fly, though Mrs. Periwinkle seemed to swat at an imaginary one with rather telling ferocity. <words>223</words>

While Mrs. Periwinkle prattled, Elara’s gaze drifted to the shop’s darkest corner, where a moss-covered lantern sat, salvaged from a riverside assignment years ago. <words>250</words> It had illuminated a particularly messy truth, much like the ones she now specialized in unearthing for her eulogies. <words>270</words> She began to adore the challenge of Bartholomew, the unseen man, the canvas for her next composition. <words>289</words> As she meticulously disassembled the weeping willow clock, tiny, almost invisible scratches near the main reservoir caught her eye – not wear and tear, but deliberate, angry gouges. <words>319</words>

"He adored his dahlias," Mrs. Periwinkle sniffled, dabbing a dry eye. <words>330</words> Elara nodded, already drafting the opening lines of Bartholomew’s eulogy in her head: "Bartholomew Periwinkle, a man whose love for dahlias was perhaps only rivaled by his wife’s apparent enthusiasm for amateur clock sabotage..." <words>366</words> The hidden truth, she suspected, was far juicier than mere floral affection. <words>380</words> She imagined delivering it to an empty room, the words hanging heavy as the scent of damp stone and old metal, a perfect, bleak performance. <words>407</words> This quiet investigation, this crafting of a narrative from the detritus of a life, was how she kept her skills sharp, her soul… well, less dull. <words>435</words> The masterpiece wasn't the silence she brought, but the understanding she exhumed, one despairingly humorous, meticulously crafted eulogy at a time. <words>458</words> The lantern in the corner seemed to flicker, though it held no flame. <words>472</words>
