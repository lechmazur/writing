Patch, a sentient scarecrow stitched from forgotten sorrows and sun-bleached canvas, stood his eternal watch. <words>16</words> His post was the colossal, fossilized ribcage of a long-dead giant, a skeletal mountain range bridging the veils between parallel worlds. <words>36</words> An ancient, sworn oath bound him here, a promise whispered to a fading queen whose only remaining token was a forgotten lace fan clutched in his straw hand. <words>63</words> He was to guard the lines in the earth, shimmering, vital energies that pulsed deep within the giantâ€™s petrified bones, the very lifelines connecting disparate realities. <words>90</words> This duty, performed with a fervent apathy born of millennia, was his sole purpose. <words>104</words> The world around him was realistically fantastical: winds howled with the voices of lost souls, and the sky above swirled with the colours of alien suns, yet to Patch, it was merely the backdrop to his unending task. <words>144</words>

His primary method of vigilance was a unique communion, a projection of his stitched consciousness into the currents of the lines themselves, an experience akin to encounters in virtual reality. <words>176</words> Through these immersive dives, he patrolled the myriad pathways, sensing disturbances, the subtle dissonances that heralded incursions. <words>196</words> Today, a particularly jagged ripple of wrongness emanated from a nascent reality, a parasitic thought-form seeking to corrupt a crucial nexus point. <words>222</words> Patch sighed, a dry rustle of straw, the weight of ages in the sound. <words>236</words> The lace fan in his grip seemed to stiffen, a conduit for his resolve. <words>250</words> He focused, his button eyes staring unseeingly at the horizon as his mind plunged back into the ethereal network. <words>271</words>

Within the chaotic beauty of the inter-dimensional flow, the entity appeared as a vortex of screaming static, already beginning to leech energy from a glowing confluence. <words>301</words> Patch manifested his will, a sharpened shard of pure, concentrated duty, honed by eons of practice. <words>319</words> With no malice, only the grim satisfaction of a task performed, he prepared to skewer the parasitic consciousness. <words>339</words> The act was swift, a silent thrust of focused intent that pierced the core of the anomaly, causing it to unravel into harmless, drifting motes of data. <words>367</words> The lines hummed, momentarily brighter, before settling back into their rhythmic pulse. <words>380</words>

Patch withdrew his awareness, the echoes of the virtual encounter fading. <words>391</words> He adjusted his tattered hat, the forgotten lace fan resting once more against his chest. <words>407</words> Another threat neutralized, another cycle completed in the endless vigil between worlds. <words>420</words> The fervent core of his oath remained, banked by the familiar, comfortable ashes of his apathy. <words>436</words> He would stand, he would watch, he would act, until the stars themselves crumbled or the oath was finally fulfilled, whichever came last. <words>460</words>
