Fen, a figure of unnerving calm, moved through the shadowed conservatory of the ancient Chinese palace, the air thick with the silence that always precedes a momentous imperial decree. <words>28</words> Outside these glass walls, the First Minister would soon be summoned, and before the first question about succession could even be uttered, Fen had her own answer to prepare. <words>59</words> Upon a weathered teak bench lay her botanical press, its brass screws gleaming faintly, ready not for idle preservation but for a precise, transformative purpose. <words>86</words> She was here to amalgamate a series of rare, almost forgotten blossoms, each one a note in the silent symphony of her design. <words>110</words> Her method was exacting, dictated by the intricate, asymmetrical beauty found in the pattern of a Celestial Azure butterfly's wings, a creature whose flight was itself an omen. <words>142</words> Around her, the conservatory breathed with the whispers of longing; the desiccated rustle of dying orchids and the faint, collective sigh of a populace yearning for change seemed to cling to the humid air. <words>180</words> The prevailing prophecy, "The Wilted Bloom precedes the New Dawn," was a phrase Fen found deliciously, figuratively literal. <words>202</words> She was, at this very moment, crafting that Wilted Bloom, a tangible harbinger whose symbolic weight would, she intended, be quite literal in its effect on the First Minister’s choice. <words>239</words> Her motivation was not mere obedience to fate, but to spin that very prophecy into raw possibility, nudging the empire towards a dawn of her subtle choosing. <words>271</words> A faint smile touched her lips, a flicker of humorous unease in the face of such grand, delicate manipulation; it was absurd, really, that the future might hinge on dried petals and a lepidopterist’s fancy. <words>314</words>
She selected a Moonpetal, its edges already browning, and laid it carefully onto a sheet of rice paper within the press. <words>338</words> Next, a Nightshade blossom, its purple deceptively innocent, was positioned just so, its placement mirroring a specific dot on the butterfly’s wing diagram she had memorized. <words>369</words> Each layer was an act of faith in her meticulous craft, a belief that beauty and precision could indeed redirect the clumsy hand of power. <words>397</words> The old Emperor was fading, his questions unasked, his legacy hanging by the thread she was now carefully arranging. <words>420</words> The press creaked softly as she tightened the screws, compressing the fragile hopes and calculated risks into a single, potent offering. <words>444</words> Soon, the First Minister would see her creation, a perfect, preserved emblem of decay and promise, delivered by an anonymous hand. <words>469</words> Fen brushed a speck of pollen from her dark sleeve, her work complete, the palace outside holding its breath. <words>490</words>
