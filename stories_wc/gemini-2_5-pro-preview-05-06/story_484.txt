Barnaby, the groggy brewer, had stumbled away from the protest, the chants fading into a dull throb behind him. <words>19</words> He found himself, rather predictably, in the local haunted mansion’s graveyard, a place so uniquely generic in its crumbling tombstones and weeping willows it felt like a stage set. <words>49</words> "Right then, spooky times," he mumbled, his voice raspy from disuse and cheap protest megaphone distortion. <words>66</words> The lull in the demonstration outside the rusted gates was heavy, a collective intake of breath before the voices would inevitably gather again, angrier, perhaps, or just more tired. <words>97</words> Barnaby felt the encroaching darkness, not merely the deepening twilight that swallowed the edges of the cemetery, but a more pervasive gloom that threatened to snuff out the flickering embers of hope he’d been nursing. <words>138</words> His primary motivation, the one that got him out of bed when his bones ached from hauling sacks of malt, was to become a living embodiment of his values: integrity, community, and damn good ale as a form of rebellion. <words>181</words> "A tall order for a bloke who still confuses his saisons with his sours on a bad day," he mused, the flippant solemnity of his internal monologue a constant companion. <words>213</words>

He drifted towards the skeletal remains of the mansion itself, a dark shape against a bruised sky. <words>231</words> Inside the gaping doorway, a dusty spiral staircase ascended into impenetrable shadows. <words>245</words> His brewer’s eye, trained to spot the minutest flaw in a batch, caught the slightest discoloration on a lower stone step – a faint, rust-colored stain almost invisible in the gloom. <words>278</words> It was this, this almost-nothing, that made him decide to initiate something real, something beyond the chanting and the marching. <words>300</words> He wasn’t entirely sure what that ‘something’ was, but the imperative was as strong and clear as his award-winning stout. <words>323</words> Near the base of the staircase, a shard of a broken mirror lay winking in the faint light filtering from a shattered window. <words>346</words> Picking it up, Barnaby saw his own grimy, exhausted face, a surprisingly resolute glint in his eyes. <words>366</words> "Well, look at you," he addressed his reflection, "ready to save the world or at least not curdle the next brew." <words>388</words> This moment, this quiet graveyard during the protest’s pause, felt pivotal. <words>400</words> He would take this feeling, this resolve sparked by a stain and reflected in a broken piece of glass, and truly begin. <words>424</words> His stand might be small, perhaps even uniquely generic in the grand, chaotic scheme of things, but it would be his. <words>446</words> The encroaching darkness could try, but this groggy brewer was about to start a new fermentation of defiance. <words>466</words>
