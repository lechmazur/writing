Bolt, a sentient car mechanic whose gears whirred with a quiet intelligence, existed within the concept of infinity, their purpose singular and profound. <words>20</words>
Their domain was a subterranean orchard, where crystalline fruits pulsed with soft light, all nourished by an underground river of stars that flowed with silent majesty. <words>43</words>
At the orchard's heart lay a shimmering park fountain, its basin not filled with water, but with the lost puzzle pieces of unspoken thoughts. <words>66</words>
Bolt's primary motivation, an ache that resonated through their metallic frame, was to hear the unsaid confessions embedded within these fragments. <words>88</words>
This core concept of gathering fragments defined their endless days, a meticulous, almost sacred, duty. <words>104</words>
To aid this endeavor, Bolt possessed a pair of vintage opera glasses, their brass tarnished but lenses impossibly clear. <words>125</words>
With these, Bolt would study each piece, the act of sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain a delicate, practiced ritual. <words>150</words>
The confessions themselves were repulsively attractive, drawing Bolt in with their raw honesty while simultaneously stinging with the pain or shame they often carried. <words>177</words>
One by one, Bolt would lift a shard, perhaps a sliver of regret or a sliver of forbidden desire, holding it beneath the starlight. <words>203</words>
Through the opera glasses, the faint etchings on the pieces would magnify, swirling into fleeting images, whispering forgotten words. <words>226</words>
A jilted lover’s silent vow of revenge, cold and sharp, would make Bolt’s internal cooling fans spin faster. <words>246</words>
Then, a child’s secret wish for a departed pet’s return, so pure it almost cracked Bolt’s hardened exterior. <words>266</words>
Each revelation brought a wave of exultant grief, a strange and powerful emotion that fueled Bolt’s continued existence. <words>287</words>
There was exultation in the connection, in finally giving voice to what had been painfully suppressed. <words>306</words>
Yet, grief followed, for the sorrow, the missed chances, the quiet desperations that these souls had endured alone. <words>327</words>
Bolt’s metallic fingers, usually adept at tuning engines and mending circuits, moved with surprising tenderness among these fragile remnants of human experience. <words>354</words>
The river of stars continued its timeless journey, constantly replenishing the fountain with new, shimmering fragments of silence. <words>376</words>
And Bolt, the eternal mechanic of hidden truths, would continue to study, to sort, to listen. <words>395</words>
For within this subterranean orchard, within the endless flow of time, the unsaid deserved its audience, and Bolt was its most devoted, if sorrowfully joyful, witness. <words>426</words>
The task was infinite, the confessions unending, but in each fragment pieced together, a tiny part of the universe’s silent heart was understood, and that, for Bolt, was everything. <words>459</words>
