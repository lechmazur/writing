Silas, a smuggler whose caution was legendary, felt a familiar, almost joyful detachment settle over him. <words>16</words> He was, after all, meticulously impulsive, a paradox that served him well in places like this sterile drought prediction center. <words>35</words> His current, self-assigned mission was unfolding precisely during the painter’s confession, a rare opportunity he’d engineered with quiet precision. <words>55</words> The painter, old Elara, was babbling under the influence of a potent anesthetic administered for a minor, albeit necessary, procedure. <words>75</words> Silas listened intently from the adjacent, supposedly soundproofed, observation room, his primary goal to predict the location of the rumored hidden reservoir Elara’s family had guarded for generations. <words>107</words>

He wasn't here for water, not directly; he was here to refine his ability to become a master of empathy, to understand the intricate dance of human emotion without truly feeling it himself. <words>141</words> This particular method, deciphering truth through delirious confessions under anesthesia, was a new favorite, offering raw, unfiltered data with an efficiency that bordered on the sublime. <words>169</words> His lips curved into a slight, almost imperceptible smile – a flicker of enthusiastic apathy. <words>184</words> Elara’s voice, thin and reedy, drifted through the hidden microphone he’d planted, a stream of fragmented images and half-forgotten tunes. <words>206</words> These musical memories were the key, Silas knew, the melodies that unlocked the deepest vaults of her mind. <words>225</words>

He held up the small, velvet-lined box he’d "acquired" from Elara’s belongings earlier, opening it to reveal a perfectly preserved, pressed butterfly, its wings the color of a twilight sky. <words>256</words> He’d researched Elara thoroughly; this specific species was linked to a lullaby her grandmother used to sing, a song about a hidden spring where such butterflies danced. <words>286</words> As if on cue, a nurse on the other side hummed a few bars of a simple tune while checking Elara’s vitals – a melody Silas had subtly suggested to the easily influenced orderly earlier. <words>323</words> The painter’s rambling shifted, her words becoming slightly more coherent, her tone tinged with a desperate longing. <words>341</words> "The blue wings… they fly… where the water sings… beneath the weeping willow, by the three stones…" she whispered. <words>362</words>

Silas meticulously noted the coordinates implied by her geographical references, his mind already cross-referencing them with old regional maps he’d studied. <words>385</words> He could almost taste the patterns of her thoughts, the shape of her sorrow and hope, yet it was all just fascinating input. <words>409</words> He had predicted it, the location, not through magic, but through the careful, almost surgical application of stimuli and observation. <words>432</words> With a soft click, he closed the box containing the pressed butterfly, his mission here complete. <words>448</words> Another successful exercise in his detached pursuit of empathy, another step towards its cold, calculated mastery. <words>466</words> The drought prediction center, with its charts of despair, would continue its official work, never knowing the true nature of the data extracted within its walls. <words>495</words>
