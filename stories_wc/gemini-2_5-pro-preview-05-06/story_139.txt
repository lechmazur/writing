Brother Kaelen awoke with a jolt, the phantom chill of his recurring dream clinging to him in the heartbeat after it returned. <words>21</words>
Below, the aerial gondola swayed gently, a fragile bubble of warmth crossing the jagged, snow-dusted mountains. <words>37</words>
The dream was always the same: his own dark reflection, a shadowy mimic that had outmaneuvered him at every turn, its laughter echoing his failures. <words>61</words>
This journey, this precarious ascent, was Kaelen’s stubborn vow to finally avenge those defeats, to outsmart that taunting shadow. <words>82</words>
He reached into his worn satchel, his fingers brushing against a creased shipping label that had led him to his current, peculiar quarry. <words>106</words>
From the bag, he carefully withdrew an antique flute, its wooden surface scarred and visually unappealing, yet humming with a subtle energy. <words>130</words>
This flute, he believed, held the key to harvesting the past, to understanding the genesis of his tormentor. <words>149</words>
His method was unconventional, perhaps even mad: he was meticulously analyzing a series of tiny, almost imperceptible tooth marks near the flute's mouthpiece. <words>176</words>
Each indentation, he theorized, was a deliberate mark, a forgotten language left by an ancient initiate, or perhaps by the reflection itself in a previous guise. <words>206</words>
The air in the gondola was thin, carrying the scent of pine and distant ice, weaving a sense of cautious enchantment around his grim task. <words>233</words>
For weeks, Kaelen, the stubborn monk, had pored over these marks, cross-referencing them with obscure monastic texts he’d committed to memory. <words>259</words>
The reflection thrived on his despair, on his predictable patterns of thought, always seeming one step ahead. <words>277</words>
But this time, Kaelen wasn't just reacting; he was dissecting, seeking the flaw in the reflection's own ancient design. <words>298</words>
The gondola lurched, nearing the summit station, a stark outpost clinging to the mountainside like a prayer. <words>317</words>
As it did, Kaelen’s breath caught, his gaze fixed on a peculiar sequence of three shallow bites on the flute. <words>339</words>
They weren't random; they formed a pattern he’d seen once before, not in a text, but in the chipped stonework of his own abandoned hermitage, a place his reflection had once defiled. <words>374</words>
A cold understanding dawned, a chilling piece of the past slotting into place with sudden, sharp clarity. <words>392</words>
The reflection hadn't just mimicked him; it had learned from his own forgotten history, his own discarded disciplines, twisting them. <words>414</words>
A grim smile touched Kaelen's lips; the path to avenge was not to destroy the reflection, but to reclaim and purify what it had stolen from his own past self. <words>446</words>
He now knew where to find the next piece of the puzzle, a way to finally outsmart the darkness by understanding its stolen, corrupted light. <words>472</words>
