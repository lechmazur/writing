Elias, a genealogist whose ledgers were as shadowed as the black market alleys he frequented, carried a guilt so heavy it bent his shoulders. <words>22</words> His motivation was singular: to find a path to self-forgiveness for the families he'd fractured with his illicitly sourced truths. <words>40</words> Amid morning walks, a ritual he clung to for a semblance of normalcy, he often found himself drawn to the atypically typical terraced house at the end of Willow Creek Lane. <words>69</words> Inside, what appeared to be a mundane living room transformed, with a flick of unseen switches, into a witch's incantation chamber, pungent with dried herbs and old secrets. <words>97</words> It was here, surrounded by flickering candlelight and arcane symbols, that Elias did his most desperate work. <words>114</words> He believed redemption lay hidden in the past, specifically by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies he'd acquired through less-than-honorable means. <words>139</words> "They always reveal more in what they *don't* say," he'd mutter, his voice a strange mix of brazen modesty, acknowledging his skill yet downplaying its dark origins. <words>167</words> On a dusty shelf, a chipped bowl, perhaps once used for scrying or simple offerings, now held the ashes of burnt eulogies, remnants of lives he’d dissected. <words>195</words> One morning, sifting through a particularly poignant speech, his gaze began to zoom in on a recurring, almost invisible phrase about "lost light." <words>221</words> The words seemed to shimmer, and for a moment, the chamber felt less like a prison of his own making and more like a chrysalis. <words>246</words> He wasn't just tracing lineages; he was tracing the echoes of forgiveness, hoping one might resonate back to him. <words>265</words> The witch, a pragmatic woman named Morwen who rented him the space for a hefty sum and a share of his findings, rarely interfered, but she’d once remarked, "You seek absolution in the obituaries of strangers, Elias. <words>305</words> An odd penance." <words>308</words> He knew she was right, yet the meticulous, almost reverent way he handled each fragile document, each whispered sorrow, felt like the only atonement he could offer. <words>339</words> Today, the "lost light" felt different, less like an accusation and more like an invitation. <words>355</words> He felt himself standing on the brink of renewal, a terrifying and exhilarating precipice. <words>370</words> Perhaps self-forgiveness wasn't found in unearthing others' secrets, but in finally understanding the universal plea for peace hidden within their grief. <words>395</words> The chipped bowl, usually a symbol of his fragmented past, suddenly seemed to hold the potential for something whole. <words>415</words> He took a deep breath, the scent of sage and old paper filling his lungs, a strange comfort in this unconventional sanctuary. <words>437</words> The path was still unclear, but the guilt, for the first time, felt a fraction lighter. <words>454</words>
