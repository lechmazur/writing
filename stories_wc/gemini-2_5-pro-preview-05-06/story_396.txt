Alistair, the urban forager, cradled the fragment of stained-glass, its colors muted in the champagne vault beneath Paris. <19>
He was here to negotiate, a task approached with his typical disinterested passion. <31>
The final performance of an avant-garde show echoed faintly as their hushed discussion began. <46>
His counterpart, Madame Evron, a developer he’d met during a chance encounter at a science fair, tapped an impatient finger. <67>
"Monsieur Alistair," she said, "this…trinket from my redevelopment site." <79>
Alistair, charmingly forgetful, hummed as if searching for a lost thought. <91>
"Ah, the shard of light," he murmured, his motivation to shield this fragile wonder burning coolly. <108>
He’d almost forgotten why they were meeting in this specific vault, amidst shadowy art patrons, until the glass pulsed faintly. <130>
"From the old chapel, I presume?" he asked, though his sporadic research confirmed it. <145>
Their cultural clash was stark: she saw debris, he saw a whisper of irreplaceable history. <161>
"Demolished legally," Evron stated, "The fragment is city refuse, technically." <173>
Alistair smiled vaguely. <177>
"Perhaps," he conceded, "But its soul, Madame, belongs to Paris, not a bin." <193>
The science fair felt distant; her brief interest in his foraged lichen display now a forgotten prelude to this stark negotiation. <217>
"I can offer a small sum for your trouble," she said, her tone dismissive. <232>
He shook his head, the disinterest in his eyes a deliberate mask. <244>
"It's not about money," he replied, "It's about preserving a whisper of the past, a concept perhaps lost in the rush for the new?" <271>
Music from the performance swelled, a mournful cello underscoring their quiet battle. <284>
He’d forgotten the specific historical dates he’d meant to cite, but the fragment itself spoke volumes. <303>
"What then, you scavenger of sentiment?" Evron’s voice was tight, yet a hint of curiosity softened its edge. <323>
"I propose," Alistair said, placing the glass on an ancient riddling rack, "it becomes a feature in your new lobby." <346>
"A small window into history, a bridge, not an obstruction," he elaborated, his passion carefully veiled. <363>
He’d nearly forgotten her company’s name, but the core idea, to shield this fragile wonder by integrating it, felt right. <386>
Evron stared at the fragment, its colors catching the low light, the cultural clash momentarily suspended. <404>
"To incorporate… this?" she mused, the final chords of the performance drifting into silence around them. <421>
"A unique talking point," Alistair suggested, hoping his forgetfulness hadn't undermined his earnest plea. <436>
"Intriguing," she finally conceded, a reluctant respect dawning in her eyes. <447>
Alistair almost let a genuine smile show, then remembered his cultivated air of detachment. <462>
