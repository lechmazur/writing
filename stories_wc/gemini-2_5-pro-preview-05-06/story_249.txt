Alistair, known to everyone in the city of forgotten fountains as the most unmasked of vigilantes, pursued his peculiar passion with a charmingly lazy ambition. <24>
His true crusade wasn't against crime, but against oblivion, a dedicated effort to collect traditional games before they vanished entirely. <44>
He believed these games held the city's faded memories, tiny monuments to the art of resilience in a place that had seen better days. <66>
Tonight, at the precise pause between raindrops when the cobblestones gleamed like polished obsidian, Alistair had a plan. <85>
His current target was Silas Blackwood, a notorious recluse rumored to possess the last complete set of "Echoing Marbles," a game whose whispers were said to reveal forgotten truths. <115>
Alistair had learned of Blackwood’s secret hoard, and his peculiar anxieties, by meticulously analyzing the surprisingly detailed gossip exchanged during the Harmonious Humbugs’ barbershop quartet rehearsals. <146>
The tenors, it turned out, were particularly loose-lipped about the eccentricities of the city’s oldest families. <163>
Alistair’s method to lure the old man wasn't with threats, but with a carefully crafted enigma. <181>
He’d sent an anonymous note hinting at a newly discovered, even rarer game, one that required a unique tool for its unveiling – a tool Alistair now carried. <211>
Tucked under his arm was not a weapon, but an antique dentist’s drill, its polished chrome glinting faintly in the damp air. <235>
He didn’t intend to use it for anything remotely dental; its delicate, clockwork mechanism was supposedly the only thing capable of winding the spring on a legendary "Clockwork Canary" game piece, his bait. <273>
The canary, once wound, would sing a tune only a true connoisseur of forgotten games would recognize, a melody Blackwood couldn't possibly ignore. <299>
Alistair found a dry archway near one of the choked, silent fountains, its stone cherubs weeping actual rainwater. <320>
He set up a small, foldable table, placing the inert canary upon it. <334>
With a sigh that was more theatrical than tired, he began to gently attach the antique drill to the canary's winding port. <358>
This was the delicate part of his lazy ambition: the setup had to be perfect, the allure irresistible. <377>
He wasn’t just collecting objects; he was coaxing stories back to life, demonstrating that even forgotten things could sing again if given the chance. <404>
The city itself, with its crumbling beauty, was a testament to holding on, and Alistair, in his own whimsical way, was its most dedicated curator of that enduring spirit. <437>
He just hoped Blackwood appreciated the artistry of the lure as much as the potential prize. <455>
A faint cough echoed from the shadowed alleyway opposite, and Alistair smiled; the first note of the game had been played. <478>
