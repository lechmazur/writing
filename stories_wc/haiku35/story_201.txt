Now, Elena would complete what was left unfinished—a performance that would bridge past and present, silence and expression. <words>520</words>

As her dance intensified, the fortress walls seemed to absorb her movements, the waterfall's constant roar providing a primal accompaniment to her restless harmony. <words>560</words>
