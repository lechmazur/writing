<story>
The shipwrecked merchant watched the ruined sky through the glass of the space station observation deck with an aloof passion. <words>20</words>
His hands were callused from barter and salvage, but he cradled a rustic butter churn like a reliquary, honestly strange in such a place. <words>44</words>
After the last tree falls the world outside had become a memory on faded screens and everyone agreed to call that silence progress, which only fueled rebellious sparks in him. <words>74</words>
He had been shipwrecked in metaphor and machine, a merchant of wares and stories, and the grand illusion around artificial arboretums and curated views irritated his detached ardor. <words>102</words>
Motivated to shatter the grand illusion, he planned to ascend the observatory rails not for spectacle but to expose the thin circuits behind every tree simulation. <words>128</words>
He would climb via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station, a brittle corridor of forgotten adverts and peeling ink between observation levels. <words>155</words>
The poster's jagged paper became a ladder, its glue like scale, and each peel carried him higher with a strangely honest rhythm that matched his pulse. <words>181</words>
People on the deck watched in curated indifference, their garments emitting polite lamplight while he ascended with a calm that was almost clinical and entirely passionate. <words>207</words>
He remembered being shipwrecked literally, a hull torn on the edge of a meteor belt, and the barter that followed taught him the value of truth over veneer. <words>235</words>
The churn thumped softly against his ribs, rustic wood whispering of churned cream and distant farms, absurd relics after the last tree falls but fiercely meaningful to him. <words>263</words>
He moved with aloof passion, a detached smile that carried heat, and when he reached the observation rim the illusionaries blinked like automatons surprised by honesty. <words>289</words>
He planted the churn on the rim and unscrewed its lid as if preparing a ritual, then tore the poster further, sending ribbons of paper fluttering into the stale air. <words>319</words>
The peeled poster revealed circuitry and a thin film projecting sapling holograms; the deck's tree illusions were just layered smoke and pixel dust. <words>342</words>
A few rebellious sparks arced out from exposed wiring, tiny glows that mirrored his small outrage and made nearby screens stutter with embarrassed light. <words>366</words>
People murmured, some annoyed, some secretly relieved, because the grand illusion had been beautiful and comforting and fundamentally dishonest, and they had grown accustomed to comfort. <words>392</words>
He spoke then, his voice low and oddly charming, declaring that the age after the last tree falls required hard seeing rather than curated solace. <words>417</words>
No one stopped him and yet he felt alone, which suited his honestly strange heart, and as he ascended one last inch his resolve felt like flint. <words>444</words>
He smashed the churn down onto the projection cluster, not to destroy beauty but to free the image, to shatter the grand illusion and let ash and light mingle honestly for the first time. <words>478</words>
The holograms collapsed into thin motes, dust drifting like confession, and the merchant, shipwrecked and certain, smiled with aloof passion finally luminous. <words>500</words>
