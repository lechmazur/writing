After the last human story is written, a wary explorer wanders into a neon cathedral that hums with obsolete hymns. <words>20</words>
They are loudly introverted, projecting inner declarations like lanterns while speaking only in tremors of posture and sideways glances. <words>39</words>
In their pack sits a damaged music CD with a scratched label that promises a melody once used as an emblem of courage at dying campfires. <words>65</words>
They meander through aisles of glass and neon pews, feet slowing to parse the cathedral's geometry and the silence between light and echo. <words>88</words>
Their quest is crooked hope made methodical: to spark an unexpected reunion with your own courage by tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog that has settled like prayer shawls over the nave. <words>123</words>
The neon cathedral is a cathedral of signs and afterimages, an archive of human stagecraft preserved like pollen in glass, and the explorer feels the weight of afterwords around their shoulders. <words>154</words>
They pull the CD out and hold its cracked reflection to a strip of leftover neon, listening for a fragment of that once-fierce anthem to catch and flare. <words>182</words>
Sometimes the CD only whispers, skips, or spits out static like an embarrassed oracle, but the explorer keeps tracing, fingers gentle on the blemish as if reading a scar. <words>211</words>
The method of moving is slow and circuitous: meander first, then wait for the firefly dots to hesitate, then follow the hesitation across columns of signage and cracked mosaics. <words>240</words>
At one point, the faint choreography of glow maps an emblem on a broken organ case: a ring of tiny lights forming a blunt symbol of courage somebody sketched in a fever long before the ink dried. <words>277</words>
It is almost a joke, one of the emblems of courage made from leftover bulbs, but the explorer's chest tightens and they remember campfire faces and the taste of risking a hand to reach a roofline. <words>313</words>
The neon's fluorescence blurs with the fog and the fireflies become a chorus of hesitant commas, each pause a tiny injunction to step forward. <words>337</words>
They put the CD into an ancient player salvaged from a side chapel, and for a moment the machine coughs, then burps out a fractured line that sounds like someone saying goodbye and hello at once. <words>373</words>
It is crooked hope, the kind that stumbles toward bravery in a half lit waltz, and that crookedness is enough to draw a warmth behind their ribs. <words>400</words>
A lullaby of failures and attempts flickers from the scratched groove and the explorer's voice, usually folded inward, unfurls into a single laugh that sounds like a rusty bell. <words>429</words>
Fireflies gather like punctuation, the scratched anthem staining them with memory, and the explorer steps closer to the emblem on the organ, pressing their palm to the ring of lights as if asking permission to be brave again. <words>467</words>
When the ring answers with a tremor and a small surge of light, the reunion is imperfect and whole, and the loudly introverted explorer realizes courage can be a quiet companion after all. <words>500</words>
