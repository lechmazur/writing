<story>An insomniac painter lived in an arboreal workshop suspended among giant mushrooms, painting smiles that hid sleepless maps of ruin and repair. <words>22</words>
He wore a tapered wizard's hat with a bullet hole like a punctured compass, an accessory that made his quiet mischief appear ceremonial. <words>45</words>
The workshop itself was peacefully chaotic, ladders tangled with paintbrushes and potted ferns, floorboards swinging like forgotten xylophones between fungal columns. <words>66</words>
He collected smiles he found in town, cheap crescents on storefront mannequins, practiced grins from postcards, and he painted them larger still to investigate what lay behind the painted smiles. <words>96</words>
At night, by scrying in puddles after midnight, he watched the glossy reflections devour the small lies and reroute their shimmers into honest directions. <words>120</words>
Those nocturnal rituals taught him how to catch light that had been exhausted by commerce and gossip, how to stitch it back into canvases that did not pretend to be painless. <words>151</words>
During the hush of an empty classroom at first light he climbed down from the mushrooms to hang a new painting opposite the scuffed blackboard, the scene acting like a mirror for children who no longer sat there. <words>189</words>
He wanted to outlast the final obstacle: the moment when a conjured grin collapses into the truth and the audience feels abandoned rather than delighted. <words>214</words>
The hat with its bullet hole sat on a nail as a talisman and a question, because holes teach you where to look and where light leaks in. <words>242</words>
He arranged the classroom painting so its painted smiles echoed the chalk letters; the juxtaposition was frolicsome regret, a prank that soothed and a wound that admitted its own edges. <words>272</words>
Sometimes he imagined his insomnia as a small animal under his ribs that devoured sunlight to keep him awake, and sometimes he painted that animal tenderly until it slept. <words>301</words>
When the puddle readings glinted a truthful direction he timed his breath and set the canvas like a patient trap, intending to devour the last false shine with a precise, laughing stroke. <words>333</words>
He had no illusions about applause; his goal to outlast the final obstacle required patience, stubbornness and a soft hunger that forgave its failures while learning their maps. <words>361</words>
At last a morning janitor paused, seeing the painting's grin shift when rain in the roof gutter caught a slant of sun, and the hat wobbled on the nail as though it were applauding. <words>395</words>
He let himself grin with a kind of rueful triumph, the hat's hole reflecting a small comet of light that the puddles had promised. <words>419</words>
Then, peacefully chaotic as always, he packed brushes into a battered tin and walked back up the ladder into the mushroom grove to sleep only until midnight, planning new deceptions that would devour only pretenses and leave the honest scars. <words>459</words>
