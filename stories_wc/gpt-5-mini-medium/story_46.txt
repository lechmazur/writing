During piano practice in an orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls, a blank-faced performer sat at a chipped keyboard and listened to the water's metronome. <words>26</words>
He was uniquely typical in his manner, neat wrists, steady breath, but driven to learn the language of dreams, a pursuit that made his precise madness visible as an even line under the surface. <words>60</words>
He called himself the guardian of rumors while the ferns whispered, a title he could both disavow and embrace because his face registered nothing and yet everything, like a blank mask collecting starlight. <words>93</words>
At his finger, a plain plastic ring was both heirloom and experiment, a votive that would approve which whispers were true by tracking moon paths across the fern canopies and sending tiny currents through the keys. <words>129</words>
During the practice he repeated scales until phrases dissolved into syntax of rumor, playing notes that tasted like syllables and correcting pitch with the clinical obsession of someone mapping fault lines in the air. <words>163</words>
He wanted to learn the language of dreams not as metaphor but as a literal alphabet, and he believed the ring, orbiting moon paths, tuned to nocturnal grammar and would approve grammar from murmurs that crept under leaves. <words>201</words>
As guardian of rumors he accepted confessions from ants and strangers alike, wearing the blank face so others could project urgency or relief while his uniquely typical empathy cataloged which dreams deserved translation. <words>234</words>
The waterfalls turned sunlight into fine grit and made harmony of noise, and the ferns leaned like listeners while the plain plastic ring gleamed when moonlight threaded the spray and the performer approved the murmurs he could decipher. <words>272</words>
He charted trajectories by tracing wet stamps on parchment between sessions, mapping lunar arcs that slipped down between fronds and over moss so that the ring's assent could be read like braille across the staff. <words>307</words>
If he misapproved a rumor, a dream's grammar would fray and a child in the village might wake speaking a falsified secret, so his concentration became a kind of compassionate tyranny enacted with metronomic exactness. <words>342</words>
One night during practice he played a tremor that matched the moon's descent and the ring buzzed, approving a rumor that translated into a lullaby about a missing river, and the ferns exhaled in unison. <words>377</words>
He learned that the language of dreams preferred modest grammar and eccentric cadences, and by approving only what balanced risk and beauty he kept the orchard's rumors honest, a uniquely typical guardian turning madness into a discipline of care. <words>416</words>
