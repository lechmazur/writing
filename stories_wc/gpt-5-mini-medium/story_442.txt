<story>The edgy tradesman lived under the swollen cap of a giant mushroom house, his hands stained with pitch and habit, comfortingly pessimistic about everything he repaired. <words>26</words>
He kept a torn corner of a flyer folded into his belt like a map of a lost instruction, the fibrous scrap promising a job that might be real if memory were not slippery. <words>60</words>
Memory was slippery; distortion of memory had become his craft as much as solder and saw, each recollection refracting like a rainbeam in the mushroom's damp windows. <words>87</words>
Tonight, during the final rotation of a forgotten windmill that groaned beyond the field of bioluminescent spores, his task felt both absurd and destined. <words>111</words>
The job was to vectorize a memory so it could be carried like a lantern, translated into coordinates that would guide his candle through an endless void. <words>138</words>
He doubted his ability, delighting in low expectations; his comfortingly pessimistic smile was a tool, a shield against brighter disappointments. <words>158</words>
He would vectorize via synchronized watches, two battered timepieces ticking in tandem like metronomes for a ritual, their second hands aligning with the last slow arc of the windmill. <words>187</words>
He strapped them to his wrists along with the torn flyer corner, believing that the scrap carried the geometry of forgetting, the negative space of memory that needed tracing. <words>216</words>
Inside the mushroom house the walls breathed spores and shadow, the interior a cathedral of soft gills and wooden rafters, each beam bearing nails shaped like questions. <words>243</words>
He lit the flickering candle as the windmill made its final rotation and the room tilted in blurry vividness, colors smearing like wet paint at the edges of sight. <words>272</words>
Each synchronized tick freed a filament of memory and the tradesman vectorized those filaments into lines on the torn corner, drawing tiny arrows that led from doubt to a faint portrait of a child he half-remembered repairing a toy. <words>311</words>
The distortion of memory meant the portrait shimmered when he blinked, sometimes the child's face smoldered into a clock, sometimes a windmill, and sometimes a map that sent his fingers trembling along invisible seams. <words>345</words>
He felt simultaneously old and central to everything, a tradesman charged with ferrying meaning, comfortingly pessimistic but steady, the candle a small cosmos in his palm. <words>371</words>
When the watch hands clicked into their final alignment the void beyond the mushroom's back door yawed open, a hallway of starless air that swallowed footfall like a question answered in a whisper. <words>404</words>
He stepped into the corridor intent on carrying that flickering candle through an endless void, the torn flyer like a compass and the watches humming in his veins. <words>432</words>
The tradesman's edges softened as memory distortion offered gifts: misremembered steps that became shortcuts, erased doors that improved escape, each falsity improving the path in a logic of survival. <words>461</words>
At the threshold he paused, comfortingly pessimistic and oddly brave, and realized his obligation was not to rescue truth but to translate grief into a line that would not burn out before reaching the other side. <words>497</words>
He stepped forward. <words>500</words></story>
