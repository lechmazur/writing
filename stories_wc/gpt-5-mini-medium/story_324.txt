<story>
In the hush of a simmering future, an insecure advisor paced the corridors of a secret agent headquarters, listening for the dreamer's calling like a tide. <words>26</words>
He kept his hands in his pockets and rehearsed polite doubts, because being useful required that his unease appear strategic rather than weak. <words>49</words>
Across a glass shelf, mounted under a label that read DUPLICATE, a brain in a jar pulsed faintly, clearly ambiguous in its expression like a wink or a warning. <words>78</words>
The advisor loved the jar because it answered questions he did not dare ask aloud, and feared it because its silence felt like an accusation made of glass. <words>106</words>
Rumors arrived here on broken shoes and clean envelopes, and his latest motivation was to chase a rumor beyond all reason, a phantom that shimmered between files and the underside of maps. <words>138</words>
He followed the method he had been taught â€” through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, letting the hollow sounds guide his choices like a compass made of absence. <words>168</words>
Sometimes the echo was a jab, sharp and sudden, reminding him that action required risk; other times it was a lullaby, coaxing him to wait and listen to the brain's quiet ticking. <words>200</words>
Within the secret agent headquarters, corridors folded like promises and offices smelled of ink and distant storms, producing a fractured idyll where duty and daydreams collided. <words>226</words>
The insecure advisor conferred with the jar nightly, posing hypotheticals with a tenderness that made colleagues call him foolish, and yet he trusted the jar's ambiguity more than human certainties. <words>256</words>
He thought of the dreamer's calling as a literal summons and as an accusation, a clearly ambiguous phrase that dated back to a recruit whose notebook smelled of tobacco and moss. <words>287</words>
At two in the morning he traced footsteps through abandoned wings of the building, listening to plaster sigh and floorboards answer so he could chase the rumor beyond all reason without announcing his folly. <words>321</words>
The jar watched with the modesty of a relic, and once, in a moment of almost mythic embarrassment, he jabbed a syringe toward the glass to wake an idea and felt both saint and savage in equal measure. <words>359</words>
That jab ricocheted through him as a moral bell, and the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place returned not to guide but to accuse, making the rumor appear less like a breadcrumb and more like a calling with teeth. <words>399</words>
He chased beyond reason into the hush of corridors that smelled of future and regret, guided by that clearly ambiguous summons and the duplicate brain's faint pulse until the rumor folded itself into truth and left him steadier and utterly undone. <words>440</words>
