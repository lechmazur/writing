<story>
Aloft like a memory, the towering labyrinth of shipping containers in the port city loomed across the lull of a wounded season.<words>22</words>
An aloof page named Ivo moved through the corridors of corrugated metal with a predictably odd gait and a neutral face that suggested other tides.<words>47</words>
He carried a battered deep-sea diver's logbook wrapped in oilcloth, its pages salted and smudged with margins full of native shorthand and sea jokes.<words>71</words>
His private project, driven by an unstoppable curiosity to pierce illusions, was to reconstruct the life recorded in that logbook and thereby reclaim a delicate power.<words>97</words>
An unexpected delay at customs, a broken crane that left a stack of orange containers humming like stalled giants, created a small pocket of time and the chance meeting he needed.<words>128</words>
There, amid shipping labels and fossilized salt, he met Marla, a retired diver whose hands still smelled of copper and who kept her own predictably odd rhythm.<words>155</words>
She blinked at the logbook and offered to help him reconstruct entries, saying that delay had been a mercy and a map.<words>177</words>
They worked across the lull, tracing porpoise ink stains and overturned diagrams, matching names to bearings, and reconstructing a pattern of departures and returns that the authorities had politely forgotten.<words>207</words>
Page and diver read notes about sealed manifests, misrouted containers used as ledger entries by a magnate who traded memories for influence, and the logbook's small annotations pierced that illusion.<words>237</words>
Reclaiming power did not mean seizing offices or shouting curses; it meant assembling proof, restoring names to missing crew lists, and returning a truth that would reroute gossip into accountability.<words>267</words>
Ivo's aloofness thinned under the task, curiosity becoming an engine that refused polite containment, and he listened to every marginal note as if it were an incision.<words>294</words>
The port itself felt like an archive of summers and winters, an innovative nostalgia where rust met neon and old songs winked from the hinges of container doors.<words>322</words>
That unexpected delay had given them hours to reconstruct more than entries; it allowed a stitched conversation wherein Marla named places the logbook omitted and Ivo named doubts he had never voiced.<words>354</words>
Together they followed a breadcrumb of coordinates to a sealed orange container whose manifest had been blacked out, and beneath its floorboards they found a ledger of kept promises and stolen wages.<words>386</words>
Reconstructing that ledger was an act that repaired small people into histories, and as the entries were read aloud dockworkers and clerks reclaimed fragments of voice.<words>412</words>
Rumor hardened into record, and the city rearranged its narrative slowly, embarrassed officials opening cold drawers while the port's pace kept its wounded season slow but honest.<words>439</words>
Ivo did not become public hero; he remained an aloof page by choice, predictably odd, but he moved with a newfound center and an authority sewn from archives.<words>467</words>
Across the lull of that wounded season the port exhaled, containers resettled into their towered sequence, and Ivo kept the deep-sea diver's logbook under his arm like a charm and a map.<words>499</words>
