The focused collector sat alone in the frost giant's lair, fingering a black rose pinned in a journal as if the thing were both evidence and talisman. <words>27</words>
He embraced solitude with an earnest flippancy that made his seriousness smell faintly of comedy, because to triumph over an alpha predator called despair you needed to wear armor of ridiculousness. <words>58</words>
It was seldom odd for a collector to keep curios in monstrous dwellings, but this collector was seldom odd in any pejorative sense, intentionally peculiar rather than broken. <words>86</words>
Rounds of a board game had been set on stones nearby, the timeframe throughout board game rounds marking each pause in which the collector cataloged a memory or weighed a risk. <words>117</words>
Players had come and gone—gnarled giants who enjoyed dice and tea, a bored frost giant lord who snickered at bad strategy—and yet solitude was the collector's chosen guild. <words>145</words>
A sudden invitation to a party, slipped under a rune-stamped slab between turns, arrived like a gambit demanding he unravel his carefully stitched life of small pleasures. <words>172</words>
He read the line about dancing and glowing wine twice, smirked, and then folded the parchment with both the precision of a curator and the casual cruelty of someone who will not be surprised by sorrow. <words>208</words>
Throughout board game rounds he kept one rule: treat invitations as riddles rather than commands and always, always bring a counteroffer of solitude. <words>231</words>
The black rose pinned in a journal was both map and mockery, petals pressed flat against provenance notes that named winters and debts, lovers and losses. <words>257</words>
Every round of dice unpeeled a memory, each roll a soft unravel of nerves and nighttime rituals, and the collector cataloged what courage remained like coins stacked in the margin of an inventory. <words>290</words>
He practiced earnest flippancy by narrating defeats as if they were slapstick, a tone that let him learn without crumbling and angry giants laugh without pity. <words>316</words>
When the frost giant's lair grew colder between rounds and the shadows lengthened into something nearly sentient, the collector took out the journal and traced the stem until the ink smudged like old blood and salt. <words>352</words>
A turn later a young giant offered him a pawn and said the party wanted him to bring a tale, not his trophies, and that absurd demand made the collector laugh in a way that was mostly brave. <words>390</words>
He accepted the sudden invitation to a party on condition he could sit alone and tell stories that unraveled like sweaters, each thread revealing why he collected solitude to fortify himself against despair. <words>423</words>
At the party among clinking horns and warm absurdities he used the black rose pinned in a journal as a prop, showing how pressed things can still give scent to the living and to hope. <words>458</words>
He had triumphed, quietly, over the alpha predator called despair, and felt oddly whole. <words>472</words>
