A mellow bard sat crosslegged on the polished deck of an antique airship hovering above the hush of an empty playground at twilight. <words>23</words>
His hair was elegantly disheveled and his coat smelled faintly of soot, cinnamon, and paper, which made him look like a comfortable storm. <words>46</words>
A worn wooden ruler lay across his knee like a talisman and he tapped it softly when arranging plates and stories into neat, conspiratorial rows. <words>71</words>
He had learned patience in small measures and great silences, a slow apprenticeship to hold delight without crushing it, and the phrase learned patience was almost a laughable epithet he used as a reminder. <words>105</words>
Tonight he was trying to resuscitate wonder in jaded eyes by serving a traditional holiday meal that would, he hoped, pull the city's children and their uneasy parents up the gangplank to join him. <words>139</words>
He arranged roast and stew and sugared fruits on mismatched plates and sang low lullabies that smelled like steam and snow, coaxing invisible footsteps. <words>163</words>
At first there was nothing but the creak of the hull and the hush of swing chains below, a lull that made the expected silence taste like a held breath. <words>193</words>
Then the airship experienced an overload of tiny footsteps and nervous giggles as the traditional holiday meal brought unexpected guests who arrived like confetti through a bellows of warm wind. <words>223</words>
Children tumbled in, faces streaked with soot and promise, while wary parents followed, blinking as if recovering from a joke told with sunrise. <words>246</words>
There was joyful terror in the way their mouths opened at the steam plume, and in the way parents laughed with a bright, surprised fright that made the bard's chest ache with tender triumph. <words>280</words>
He kept his hands steady, measuring portions with the worn wooden ruler as if exact measures could tether astonishment and make it safe to hand around. <words>306</words>
Occasionally the ruler tapped a plate to begin a toast, or the bard used it to point at wonder like a teacher pointing out constellations in a wrong sky. <words>335</words>
He was elegantly disheveled and patient, and his patience was not the kind that stalls but the kind that collects people into a slow, shimmering yes. <words>361</words>
As plates emptied and stories swelled, an overload of memories spilled like spiced cider, too sweet and too sharp, and the air smelled of brave childhood and small, recuperative shocks. <words>391</words>
The playground below remained hushed, its swings a dark audience, while upstairs the bard performed minor miracles: coaxing a timid glance into a gasp, turning a weary sigh into a chorus. <words>422</words>
Parents and children left with pockets full of branded sugar and small, improbable tokens, eyes rearranged to catalog light again. <words>442</words>
The bard, elegantly disheveled and unnervingly calm, packed the worn wooden ruler into his coat and rode the antique airship into the hush of an empty playground at twilight, smiling at the joyful terror he had taught and learned to love. <words>483</words>
