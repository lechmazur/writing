<story>
In the lacquered halls of an ancient Chinese palace a calm assassin hummed tunelessly while folding a botanical press into the lining of his sleeve. <words>25</words>
He moved with the peculiar composure of someone who had practiced patience as a weapon and patience as a joke to keep the sentries off balance. <words>51</words>
Before the first question is asked he bows to a carved dragon and considers how to amalgamate rumor and ritual into a single slick sentence that might alter fate. <words>80</words>
His motivation is not gold or revenge but to spin a prophecy into raw possibility, a mission he describes with a tilt that is at once earnest and absurd. <words>109</words>
Around him court musicians rehearse scales while eunuchs argue over tea leaves and a pigeon commits the ultimate breach of protocol by inspecting an ivory comb. <words>135</words>
He labels petals pressed in the botanical press both literally and figuratively literal because the palace believes metaphors like treaties and takes names as edicts. <words>160</words>
Whispers of longing trickle through the corridors like incense smoke and the assassin catalogues each syllable as if it were evidence and currency. <words>183</words>
He is calm but not unmoved; the humorous unease in his chest is the engine that drives him to imagine futures and to test their seams. <words>209</words>
His method is strange and exacting: he plans futures by the pattern of a butterfly's wings, studying how a tremor here becomes a gale elsewhere. <words>234</words>
He imagines the palace as an ecosystem where courtyards and gossip flutter like scales and a single folded wing might amalgamate rumor and ritual into something palpably new. <words>262</words>
A handmaiden brings him a sealed map and a scrap of silk scented with the emperor's favorite jasmine, and he smiles because the universe has offered the precise inconvenient coincidence he needed. <words>294</words>
He presses the silk and a folded prophecy into the botanical press and arranges them so the butterfly pattern will be legible when the pages open. <words>320</words>
Before the first question is asked he murmurs his intent, a ridiculous ritual line that sounds like a riddle and a promise, and the words seem to stick to the paper. <words>351</words>
The calm assassin's goal is comic and grave: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility and then hand it to the palace as if it were a petition for a lamp. <words>382</words>
He imagines that somewhere within the carved beams a question will eventually land, but for now he delights in the precarious safety of acting before any inquiry can unravel his work. <words>413</words>
When the pages unfurl the palace inhales and the combined scent of jasmine and pressed petals reads like a verdict, and he laughs softly at how literal his metaphors have become. <words>444</words>
