<story>A street musician wandered the cavernous aisles of an automated postal sorting facility at dusk. <words>15</words>
He clutched a vintage fountain pen like a talisman, its nib stained with invisible songs. <words>30</words>
Tonight, at the close of a suitcase that may never reopen, he rehearsed memory and mischief. <words>46</words>
The facility hummed like a thrifted orchestra, conveyor belts composing forgotten rhythms in fluorescent light. <words>61</words>
He was complexly deceptive to himself, arranging a fa√ßade of confidence while cataloguing every misplayed note. <words>77</words>
Regret followed him like returned mail, a backlash of regrets that pinged with each mechanical sort and pause. <words>95</words>
He sought to rewind time through forgotten patterns, tracing loops of melody on paper tags and shipping labels. <words>113</words>
The pen allowed small reversals: ink that believed in second takes, doodles that rerouted a hesitation back into flourish. <words>132</words>
At times he celebrated the absurdity of cosmic mail, imagining planets stamped and dispatched with bureaucratic indifference. <words>149</words>
His motivation was peculiar: to find humor in cosmic absurdity, to laugh while the facility sorted the gravity of his mistakes. <words>170</words>
Employees in badge-lit booths glanced through plexiglass at the improbable musician tracing elegies on cardboard. <words>185</words>
He fed postcards into the belts like confessions, then rewound his fingers over the pen to unwrite what shame had printed. <words>206</words>
Sometimes the rewind failed and the facility returned a louder regret, thicker tape around a missed chord. <words>223</words>
He laughed anyway, a clean, small sound that smelled of ozone and overdue stamps, because despair felt too heavy to own alone. <words>245</words>
Joyful despair became his tuning, each paradox a different key for improvisation. <words>257</words>
He imagined the suitcase's clasp closing elsewhere, sealing letters and a life, an ending that might be permanent. <words>275</words>
The possibility that it may never reopen sharpened his performances into tiny rebellions against finality. <words>290</words>
He used the facility's forgotten barcode patterns like rhythms, tapping conveyor rails and stamping cadence into empty envelopes. <words>308</words>
Each forgotten pattern wound a gentle rewind into his chest, unspooling errors into jokes he could whistle between sorting cycles. <words>328</words>
When a pneumatic tube coughed up a misrouted letter he performed a small funeral and then a comic encore. <words>347</words>
A supervisor once called him complexly deceptive, but he smiled, knowing the phrase described both his masks and his craft. <words>367</words>
Later, alone beneath archival fluorescents, he uncapped the pen and wrote a list of small absolutions in looping ink. <words>386</words>
Each name was a package to be rerouted, each apology a stamp returned to sender with a doodled grin. <words>405</words>
He pressed the nib to a shipping manifest and pretended to rewind his life in neat calligraphy, then burst out laughing. <words>426</words>
The laughter was an offering to the machines, proof that humans can transmute backlog into absurd hymn. <words>443</words>
When the suitcase finally clicked closed in his imagination, he joked about leaving a forwarding address for God. <words>461</words>
He bowed to the sorting machines, humble, defiant, still composing. <words>471</words></story>
