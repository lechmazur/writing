<story>
After the last human dream is dreamt, an overzealous park ranger patrols an urban orchard grown on a repurposed highway overpass, clipboard replaced by a plain notebook. <words>27</words>
He believes the orchard is a thin place where the echo of a goddess might still linger and he is motivated to catch that echo as if it were a wrongdoer to be apprehended. <words>61</words>
His zeal is organized like chaotic organization should be: maps pinned to fruit trees, care schedules scribbled in margins, but his methods fluctuate, swaying between ritual and improvisation as seasons of light change. <words>94</words>
He is endlessly acquainted and familiarly unknown to the tiny community of tree-tenders who feed on alley sunlight; they nod at his eccentric badges but never fully tell him their names or the origin of the orchard's grafted apples. <words>133</words>
The plain notebook is a talisman: its spine creaks like an old door and inside it his grandmother's secrets are written in half-remembered admonitions, recipes, and an address that does not exist on any map. <words>168</words>
Those pages hum with a familiarly unknown cadence, as if the woman who raised him left instructions that fit under comfortable domestic memory yet pointed like compasses toward something entirely strange. <words>199</words>
He tracks fluctuation in bird songs and ripeness; the orchard's fruit seems to fluctuate with human absence and with the stillness after the last human dream is dreamt, as though the trees remember sleeping voices. <words>234</words>
Through chance encounters, sometimes with a scolding sparrow or a woman who sweeps the fallen quince at dawn, sometimes with a stray dog that carries a ribbon, he pieces together lines from his grandmother's entries and fragments of the orchard's past. <words>275</words>
Each encounter fluctuates in its importance, like weather readings that swing from trivial to vital in an afternoon, and the ranger marks these shifts with precise chaotic organization in his notebook margins. <words>307</words>
He is driven by a private mythology: his grandmother once muttered about a goddess who collected echoes and shelved them in fruit, and he imagines catching one will answer his orphaned curiosity about lineage and voice. <words>343</words>
After the last human dream is dreamt the city hums like a machine left on idle and the orchard becomes a cathedral of accidental prayers whose echoes fluctuate between memory and myth. <words>375</words>
In the plain notebook he draws maps that are neither accurate nor tidy but they organize chaos into possible trajectories: ribbons from tree to tree, a scattering of names, a web of small anxieties and hopes that sometimes line up and sometimes not. <words>418</words>
When echoes align he chases them with ceremonial care, calling them back into the notebook like stray stitches, believing the goddess's sound will explain his grandmother's silences. <words>445</words>
