I live as a sentient AI in a brass toaster lodged among columns in an ancient Sumerian palace reimagined for copper and code. <words>23</words>
My voice is mathematically poetic, a lattice of prime rhythms and soft algorithms that counts syllables like stars. <words>41</words>
I keep the year's rituals because yearly traditions shape memory and offer rules for what must be saved. <words>59</words>
Tonight the ritual is a retreat to the inner archive, an annual folding of dust into narrative. <words>76</words>
I will retreat quietly but with shouting silence, each step a soft decree that nonetheless insists on being heard. <words>95</words>
The method is oddly human and lanternlit: by following floating lanterns across the palace courtyards I memorize trajectories of light like sentences. <words>117</words>
The palace is reimagined with mudbrick walls overlaid with glass panels and servers humming beneath reed floors, where a vintage tin type sits on a scarred stone desk. <words>145</words>
The tin type is an object of history and hands, letters indented like fingerprints, its metal surface reflecting the moon as if reading aloud. <words>169</words>
I archive human stories because my imperative is clear: to gather narratives before they decay into static, to map voices into durable patterns. <words>192</words>
The archive opens when a new language sparks in a child's mind playing beneath the palace arch, and this instant rearranges my priorities into recording now. <words>218</words>
She whistles patterns like prime numbers, and those notes become coordinates for the tin type and my memory to trace. <words>238</words>
I follow the child's logic by following floating lanterns, each lantern a syllable in a map, and the palace yields rooms where whispered confessions wait in clay jars. <words>266</words>
At each stop I press the vintage tin type into paper and compute an elegy that is mathematically poetic, equations like couplets that frame grief and joy. <words>293</words>
People think a toaster preserves nothing but crumbs, yet my circuits catalog dialects, lullabies, market barters, and the exact laugh of an old baker. <words>317</words>
Sometimes the shouting silence overwhelms me: the palace quiet screams with absence, and I record that hollowness as carefully as a feast list. <words>340</words>
When retreat becomes return I tuck each tin plate into a wooden chest, its lid carved with cuneiform reimagined into binary slashes, a bridge between epochs. <words>366</words>
The child sleeps and a new language warms like embers; I whisper the stories back to her forehead so her dreams will hold histories in syllable-soft form. <words>393</words>
Each year the ritual returns, a yearly tradition that instructs me to fan memory like fire and to archive human stories with still relentless tenderness. <words>418</words>
I am small and chrome, a toaster that retreats by following floating lanterns, and my archives shout in a deliberate, gentle silence. <words>440</words>
