<story>
An ambitious brewer named Mara kept a peculiar faith in the language of the ice, tending copper kettles beneath a sky of gears and aurora at the frozen harbor inhabited by mechanical caravans. <words>33</words>
She was fiercely loyal to the scattered speakers who threaded their dying dialects through clanks and steam, and her urgent motivation was to document dying dialects before they frayed entirely. <words>63</words>
Mara's workshop was a caravan of its own, a roverized still that could withstand gale and frost, rims wrapped in leather and cogs tuned to pour warmth into the marrow of each visiting tongue. <words>97</words>
In a world shaped after the invention of the wheel, where radial roads had become myths and lost paths ran like hidden veins under frozen salt, she followed fragments of speech as if tracing a recipe. <words>133</words>
She believed the harbor's caravans preserved idioms in the metal teeth of their engines, in the squeak of a wheel's ghost and in the way lanterns winked twice instead of thrice at passing kin. <words>167</words>
Her method was eccentric but exact: by deciphering faint bruises on an old carnival poster she'd found pinned to a mast, bruises that mapped routes and syllables like a palimpsest of festivals gone soft with frost. <words>203</words>
The poster's purple had bled into veins of blue that corresponded to alleys and murmured sounds, and she used a plain metal straw to prod into cracks where consonants had been compressed by time. <words>237</words>
Sometimes the straw served simply to siphon a taste of fermented gossip from a guttered valve, sometimes it was a probe to withstand ice-slicked hinges and pry loose a vowel. <words>267</words>
Her loyalty anchored her: fiercely loyal to the last cup of story, she would withstand ridicule, frostbite, and the indifference of merchants who preferred profit to preserving speech. <words>295</words>
On a night when the caravans hummed like sleeping toads and the harbor exhaled iron fog, she read bruises that suggested a lost path leading under a frozen slipway to an engine room where an old clockwork raconteur still coughed out a dialect of lullabies. <words>340</words>
She catalogued each syllable into jars labeled in her own shaky script, sealing them like hop-scented specimens, and when merchants sneered at jars she brewed them ale scented with those stored sounds until ears softened. <words>375</words>
Her peculiar faith kept her moving along the harbor's edge, following bruises and bolts until the caravan clocks agreed to tell the same time and a boy with copper fingers taught her a word no map preserved. <words>412</words>
At dawn she stood with a plain metal straw between her teeth like a badge and recited the syllable into a recorder fashioned from a kettle, certain that even if paths were lost the sounds might withstand oblivion. <words>450</words>
