He was cynically hopeful, a technician of small miracles who had been sucked off course into a realm where cottages smoked like old sighs and dragons were mostly bureaucratic. <words>58</words>
On a cliff the abandoned observatory crouched like a broken promise, lenses cracked into webbed maps of stars that no longer mapped anything he knew. <words>83</words>
Below, the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down held the valley like breath, every apple bough a suspended verdict and every path incandescent with waiting. <words>110</words>
He carried a dried herb bundle tied with string, its sage and thyme smelling of hearths and funerals, a talisman he planned to disseminate when words failed. <words>137</words>
The hill hosted a strange event that night: a speed dating encounter organized by an old astronomer who missed company and arithmetic in equal measure. <words>162</words>

They planned to disseminate small gifts across the orchard, herbs and kernels and little stamped promises, to coax the trees into remembering why they had loved light. <words>369</words>
Outside the observatory the sky tasted of charred serenity, where ash fell like consolation and silence stitched open wounds into patient fabric. <words>391</words>
In the hush before the trees were cut, they set drones aloft to carry the herb bundles, their rotors whispering benedictions into sleeping limbs. <words>415</words>
In that battered glass room they disseminated mercy across rows of saplings, and he found that from the brink of despair a horizon could indeed answer the smallest signal. <words>444</words>
