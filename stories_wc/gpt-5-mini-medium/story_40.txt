I am a reincarnated goldfish caretaker who keeps odd hours and cultivates patience like algae, tentatively fierce in my small rituals and privately amused by the idea that anyone ever expected me to stay put. <words>35</words>
I turn the pages of the forgotten recipe library for both solace and mischief, tasting margins with the same reverence I give the porcelain bowls that hold my fish, because recipes are really stories of habit stitched in fat and flour. <words>76</words>
A sudden change of weather - rain snatching the sun away and then offering it back with a ridiculous bow - pushed me into the charity of the reading room where a small woman clutched a doctor's chart and a toy soldier with a missing arm lay like a punctuation mark. <words>125</words>
She looked up at me as if I were a plot twist, and I recognized the shape of her hands because they matched the gestures I had made for decades feeding goldfish, sliding nutriment through water like small ceremonial betrayals. <words>165</words>
Her chart, she admitted, was ambiguous and the doctor's notes had not yet confirmed a turning point, which made the possibility of change taste both urgent and absurd to her, and to me. <words>198</words>
Guilt's haunting echo hummed beneath our banter - she blamed the hospital for ritualizing recovery, I blamed myself for tolerating routines that hardened into orthodoxy in the cookbook of the town - and I wanted to alleviate that pressure unlike anyone who prefers placation over upheaval. <words>244</words>
She gripped the toy soldier with a missing arm as if it were a relic of some familial injunction, and I thought about how traditions gather amputations - every lost limb a quiet rule enforced by polite nods. <words>281</words>
My role as reincarnated goldfish caretaker had taught me to read tiny currents of behavior, to watch for the eddies where regret pools, and to be tentatively fierce when I needed to disturb the surface and free something that had been breathing stale ritual air. <words>326</words>
We both laughed with a playful cynicism that tasted faintly of vinegar and lemon rind, and then the rain stopped as abruptly as it began and a sunlit domino of patrons drifted through the door, spilling recipes and conspiracies. <words>365</words>
Before the doctor's chart confirmed anything, the woman asked if I would take the toy soldier home and teach it how to guard something other than duty, and I said yes because I wanted to disrupt a stagnant tradition not out of grandiosity but out of a petty, corrective love. <words>415</words>
That night I set the toy soldier on the lip of the goldfish bowl where he could watch the small orange congregations, and I wrapped his missing arm in a scrap of recipe page like a bandage, reading aloud an absurd instruction about when to add salt to grief. <words>464</words>
In the morning, before anyone could chalk it up to a miracle, people cooked the old recipes differently, trading timidity for daring, and the town smelled like something trying to be alive. <words>496</words>
