At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, a gentle conjurer listened for the echoes that led him toward an underground city of the dwarves. <words>28</words>
He carried a stained glass butterfly in his pocket like a confession and an accusation, its colors catching light that did not belong to this place. <words>54</words>
The mission was the search for justice as much as it was the salvage of soil and memory, to rebuild a forgotten garden beneath stone and industry. <words>81</words>
He smiled with joyful terror because hope felt like a blade and a blossom at once, and he loved both edges. <words>102</words>
The dwarven tunnels smelled of singed moss and coal, and lanterns bounced off maple-ribbed vaults while cart traffic hummed like distant bees. <words>124</words>
He navigated by an inscrutably obvious map of feelings, a compass of regret that pointed toward places where promises had been broken. <words>146</words>
In the market a mason offered a riddle about a fountain, and in exchange the conjurer read reversed messages scratched into copper coins, learning where the water had gone. <words>175</words>
Every reversed message was a mirror poem, spelled back to front so only those who listened backward could hear the truth, a method so cunning it felt like mercy. <words>204</words>
Justice in this subterranean calculus meant reassemble fractured histories, lay roots through stone, and make the dwarves answer for the gardens they had paved. <words>228</words>
He placed the stained glass butterfly on a ledger of names and it shattered softly into color shards that hummed with the names of those erased. <words>254</words>
The shards threaded through the city like confetti, and as he followed their light the conjurer decoded more reversed messages whispered by statues and dripping pipes. <words>280</words>
Each decoded line rearranged the order of ownership and obligation with the quiet power of compost turning; small legal bones made whole. <words>302</words>
At a council chamber carved from geodes, he petitioned the elders with a voice that trembled between laughter and pleading, the joy and terror of someone who had seen both blight and bloom. <words>335</words>
They read the reversed messages aloud together until the meaning folded upon itself and obligations reformed like roots finding water, and the city agreed to cede a courtyard. <words>363</words>
Outside, at the break of that brittle branch, the forest exhaled and the conjurer felt the earth answer him with a hundred small sprouts underfoot, as if the garden had been waiting in patience. <words>397</words>
He set to work to reassemble the courtyard beds, planting seeds whispered in reverse so they would remember the names of those who tended them and the debts owed. <words>426</words>
He laughed, a soft sound of joyful terror that scattered the last glass shards into soil. <words>442</words>
