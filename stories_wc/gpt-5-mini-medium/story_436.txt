The sorrowful apothecary floated in the dim corridor of an exiled fortress floating above scorching deserts, cradling a plastic spoon and a bundle of roughly refined herbs while the library's lamps guttered toward closure. <words>34</words>
In the final minute before a library shuts its doors he had come bearing a packet of family recipes inked in soot and song, determined to tempt an oracle to speak again and break the exile's silence. <words>71</words>
He planned to bifurcate the recipes by decoding dream catchers left behind, a practice half alchemical and half mnemonic that had kept his mother's laughter alive in tinctures. <words>99</words>
His tools were roughly refined, a chipped mortar, glass bottles fogged with use, and a single plastic spoon for tasting, graceless against porcelain yet indispensable. <words>124</words>
Painful joy hummed under his ribs as he set out a map of stitches and spices, each notation a tremor between grief and stubborn hope. <words>149</words>
He had to bifurcate ink from memory and recipe from omen before the door's last latch clicked, threading flavors into questions that might coax the oracle's lips. <words>176</words>
The oracle had once spoken to his family, blessing and cursing dishes in equal measure, and he believed that if he reconstructed the familial palimpsest the oracle would speak again. <words>206</words>
He would bifurcate meanings, separating scent from syntax, by decoding dream catchers left behind by itinerant relatives who stitched spices into loops and beads like punctuation. <words>232</words>
Each bead held a recipe or a grief, family recipes braided with sorrow and laughter, tastes and instructions layered like funerary cloth over joy. <words>256</words>
He worked with hands stained tea-dark, roughly refined movements honed by years of exile, and the act would bifurcate his grief into two threads: one sent to feed memory, the other to plea. <words>289</words>
Outside the window the desert's glare shimmered like a coagulated recipe, and inside the librarian snuffed the last candle as the minute bled; he had sixty seconds to finish. <words>318</words>
He uncapped a vial and spooned a bitter-sweet elixir with the plastic spoon, murmuring the stitched instructions until the dream catchers exhaled and the air bifurcated into past and present, and the oracle turned its head. <words>354</words>
Its voice was gravel and honey, reluctant and ricocheting through the stack's ribs, whispering a single recipe that tasted of forgiveness and the exact name of a lost sister. <words>383</words>
He felt painful joy split him open like a boiled egg, the family recipes returned but altered, bifurcate and whole, and he laughed through tears as exile softened for a breath. <words>414</words>
When the librarian closed the heavy oak there was just time for a single spoonful to be poured into a cup and offered to the oracle, and the fortress above the dunes held its breath, mildly refined now by hope. <words>454</words>
