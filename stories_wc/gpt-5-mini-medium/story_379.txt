I am a trickster lawyer on the run, a man of legal cleverness turned itinerant archivist inside a biodome run as a futuristic farm, and I move with an impatiently patient rhythm that keeps me both hidden and watching. <words>39</words>
The biodome smells of wet soil and remembered machinery while outside the translucent curve the city is a rumor, so I catalogue disappearing languages as if every word were a seed and every silence a threat to harvest. <words>77</words>
My chosen paths are always a crooked map: small diversions, sudden detours, a practiced ability to divert attention from my paper trail into gullies of rumor where trackers lose time and patience. <words>109</words>
During stretching, a communal hour when the biodome's vertical crops flex their engineered fibers and people bend to relieve cramped lungs, the ghosts of my past arrive in the form of cryptic dares sent by old high school rivals who still remember every slight. <words>153</words>
They give me riddled steps and old jokes folded into coordinates, and the dares are a method that funnels my exile into a performance I cannot refuse, because to catalogue languages I must be where the last speakers linger. <words>192</words>
My old rivals, each a minor specter of teenage malice, seem to delight in sending me along paths that feel fated, as if they themselves insistently nudged the forked roads to watch which choices I will honor. <words>229</words>
Sometimes the dares include a trivial object slipped into my hand, like a leftover gift tag with a crooked smile scrawled on it, and that small thing can reroute an investigation or remind a forgotten speaker of a childhood lullaby. <words>269</words>
I am a trickster by necessity, diverting suspicion with legalisms and parables, but there is a ghostly resolve beneath the jokes: every diverted convoy buys time to record a word, a syntax, a dying consonant that will not be forgone. <words>309</words>
Night in the dome is blue and cheap as memory, and I listen at irrigation pumps and the humming barn for vowels that slip in the dark between routines, cataloguing them in a device that tastes like paper and light. <words>349</words>
The law was my first trade, and when agents tracked paper signatures I learned to redirect them toward false claims about crop patents, intentionally creating bureaucratic tangles to divert their interest while I chased idioms through the silo network. <words>388</words>
My rivals' dares escalate: a recorded phrase hidden inside a compost heap, a dare to stand beneath the glass during stretching and recite a lullaby in the last speaker's tongue, a test that forces me to choose the ethical path of preservation over my own safety. <words>434</words>
I step into the blue, recite the lullaby, watch the watchers detour when memories surface, and though I remain impatiently patient, the catalogue grows: one more language recorded, one more ghost given voice on a futuristic farm that will outlast the dome's glass if only someone remembers the chosen paths that led us to speak. <words>489</words>
