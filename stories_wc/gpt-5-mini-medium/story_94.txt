She claimed the title of femme fatale heartbreak counselor and wore it like armor while standing at the rim of the sky reflection pool.<words>24</words>
Amber earrings dangled from her ears, catching the pooled sky and throwing tiny suns that made the time-travel tourists squint.<words>44</words>
After the invention of time travel she had learned to counsel clients whose regrets arrived with timestamps and paradoxical ache, and she listened with a restlessly curious mind.<words>72</words>
Her method was unconventional: by tracking cloud trails across the reflection pool she mapped patterns of longing like constellations of unfinished promises.<words>94</words>
Clients flitted between epochs and left residue of choices in the water, and she read them like rings in old trees, noting how the gravity of desires bent decisions down toward their cores.<words>127</words>
There was a cautious impulsiveness in her voice when she advised someone to unzip a sealed memory or to zip a loose thread of passion back into its sleeve.<words>156</words>
She herself lived with that tension, wanting freedom desperately while performing rituals that proved she was still contained in a cage of illusions.<words>179</words>
Her motivation to proclaim herself free in a cage of illusions became a daily sermon, whispered into the ear of the pool so the sky might reflect it back louder.<words>209</words>
She counselled with both tenderness and calculation, offering clients small rites - sometimes a folded paper, sometimes an amber earring slipped into a palm - to test whether their wants were true or merely attractive echoes.<words>243</words>
One client, a veteran of temporal smuggling, arrived convinced that freedom meant erasing every regret, and she watched him trace the pool's skin with trembling fingers like someone searching for an exit wound.<words>276</words>
She removed her amber earrings and held them to the water, letting their warm tones ripple as though they might teach the pool to remember different outcomes.<words>303</words>
By tracing cloud trails she could read the gravity of desires, seeing which longings bent toward stability and which pulled toward perilous singularities.<words>326</words>
Her restlessly curious eyes catalogued microexpressions as if they were maps, and she offered clients pathways that felt like invitations to both salvation and revolt.<words>351</words>
The veteran wanted a clean severance, but she proposed an experiment: borrow from a later self and return exactly what did not belong, zipped shut like a secret pocket.<words>380</words>
He hesitated, then with a cautious impulsiveness he agreed, and for a moment the pool flashed futures like fish startled into flight.<words>402</words>
She zipped a silver pouch at his throat and whispered a litany of permission that tasted like wind and absolution.<words>422</words>
Then she watched him step away, lighter but trembling, and the amber earrings winked as if approving the small theft of fear.<words>444</words>
Later she stood alone, declaring herself free aloud into the pool while knowing every proclamation was a carefully arranged illusion that kept her heart safely captive and wildly alive.<words>473</words>
