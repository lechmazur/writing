<story>At the rim of a silent crater, where the lunar greenhouse gathered light and breath, a tense bodyguard moved like a shadow through glass, watching plants and people with precise unease. <words>31</words>
His jaw was set in serene anger, a calm that glowed hot under skin, and he had become serendipitously stubborn in ways even he did not invite. <words>58</words>
He had followed a woman whose name smelled of jasmine through park visits on Earth and recorded the rhythm of her Sunday routines, a timeframe that tethered memory to duty. <words>88</words>
The faded photograph he kept folded in his vest showed that same woman smiling on a bench beneath an oak; someone had slipped it to him in a transit queue and it felt like both accusation and prayer. <words>126</words>
He guarded her because he was told to ratify a promise made in his file, a cold contract that bound gestures and silence, but he had begun to imagine a life not written by other hands. <words>162</words>
Amid the succulents and oxygen lamps on the crater's edge he practiced small rebellions: smiling when instructed not to, stepping aside to let a child pluck a leaf, answering questions with honest delay. <words>195</words>
He worked toward a timely rebirth not of flesh but of agency, a scheduleless season that could be ratified only by evidence of change rather than signatures on paper. <words>224</words>
His method was odd and patient: by collecting fragments of overheard stories he assembled a mosaic of other people's exits and small triumphs, clues that suggested escape was teachable and often crumb-like. <words>256</words>
Each shard he tucked into the lining with the photograph was a vote toward permission; each kitchen confession, a neighbor's boast, a child's complaint from a park visit, became grammar for an eventual 'yes'. <words>290</words>
He felt controlling influence like a shadowed hand along his spine, the agency's director sending messages that smelled faintly of ash and authority, and he wanted to break free to choose which greenhouses to protect and which seasons to abandon. <words>330</words>
Serendipitously stubborn, he misinterpreted small kindnesses as permission and learned that one woman in a park had left keys taped under a bench when she finally left a partnership, and he stored that detail like a seed. <words>367</words>
When the director demanded an audit he used the fragments and the photograph to ratify his own refusal, presenting a narrative stitched from overheard farewells and a child's description of a liberated pigeon to argue he had outgrown simple obedience. <words>407</words>
On a cold morning among dew on hydroponic glass he walked away from the post, the photograph pressed to his chest like a talisman, breathing the sterile vegetal air as if inhaling a new name. <words>442</words>
He wandered the park visits he'd memorized and leaned into this timely rebirth, serene anger softening into resolve as he finally ratified his own choice to protect only what he loved and to refuse further chains. <words>478</words>
