<story>
A forthright peddler sat on the rusted gurney of an abandoned space station medical bay, selling hope in small copper tins while the universe hums its secret song. <words>28</words>
He was meekly assertive in the way he arranged a dried flower bouquet beside a pile of identical tins, as if policy and perfume could alter fate. <words>55</words>
Joyful loneliness braided around him like a soft bandage; his grin brightened the fluorescent gloom while his hands trembled with a memory that tasted of iron and old vows. <words>84</words>
He had sworn an oath sealed in blood to protect a village on a world that no longer drew breath, and that weight kept him awake through rerouted ventilation and the station's hollow loneliness. <words>118</words>
Now the motivation to break an oath sealed in blood beat in his chest like a second heartbeat, gentle and insistent, and he planned to divide his burden among strangers who owed him nothing. <words>152</words>
He would divide not coins but confessions, offering one dried bloom and a tin to anyone who would tell a truth, even if that truth arrived like a scraped confession through rumor-laden gossip columns he'd smuggled aboard the silent decks. <words>192</words>
By sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns he had found fragments: a midwife's name, a child's laugh recorded on a dying planet, and a ledger entry promising absolution to the first who returned a keepsake. <words>226</words>
He traded those columns for whispered addresses in the station's echo, coaxing confessions from shipwrights and nurses who passed like ghosts through the medical bay. <words>251</words>
Each confession was a small incision that let bloodless truth leak out, and each truth allowed him to untie one knot of the oath's binding until redemption's path unfolded like a map across his palms. <words>286</words>
He moved meekly assertive between stretchers and faded posters, bartering dried petals for names and laughter for directions, and at night he arranged the bouquet under a skylight where starlight pooled like music. <words>319</words>
Sometimes the happy ache of giving away pieces of his remorse made him laugh alone, a joyous little sound that proved loneliness could be celebratory, not only bereft. <words>347</words>
When finally a woman with a child's eyes took the dried flower bouquet and placed it in her hair, she said the word that unstitched the last clause of his oath, 'forgive,' and the station's hum seemed to answer as if the universe itself knew the small ceremony mattered. <words>396</words>
He raised his tins and offered them empty-handed, the peddler's smile sincere, because dividing grief had taught him to keep faith with living things. <words>420</words>
Later, while the universe hummed its secret song again and the skylight stored that tiny warmth, the peddler folded his hands and felt the final stitch of his blood oath loosen, joyful and unburdened in his lonely harbor. <words>458</words>
