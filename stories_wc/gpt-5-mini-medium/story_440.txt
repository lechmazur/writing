A detached swordsman with a lovingly detached smile stood at the edge of the futuristic city recycling center the night after the last swipe of paint completes a mural. <words>29</words>
He had the appearance of someone who could sever tides yet kept his hands from cutting, and he came to meddle in a practice most people mistook for myth. <words>58</words>
In that recycled cathedral, panels hummed, conveyor belts composed lullabies, and a single piece of sea pottery winked like a relic in a drift of polymer and glass. <words>86</words>
He had heard of the secret weavers in the alleys between sanitation towers, rumored artisans who stitched memory into material, so he intended to consecrate an impossible vow through their obscure craft. <words>118</words>
The swordsman moved with affectionate distance, the lovingly detached cadence of someone who both loved a promise and refused to be undone by it. <words>142</words>
His plan was not violence but meddling that mended: by reassembling collage scraps from a street artist's bin he would create a talisman that looked accidental and contained a vow's geometry. <words>173</words>
After the last swipe of paint completes a mural they would say the city had decorated itself but he knew the mural's final breath signaled the opening of a tiny door into the weavers' schedule. <words>208</words>
Inside the recycling center, under neon kelp and humming sorters, the secret weavers gathered in shifts to splice fragments into truth, and he arrived with his awkward, ceremonial collage targeted like a joke at a shrine. <words>244</words>
He meddled gently, hands moving as if composing a letter instead of a charm, arranging seashell slivers, paint-peel ribbons, circuit ribbon-facets, and the single piece of sea pottery so the vow would read in the light of sorting lamps. <words>283</words>
The weavers watched, amused and serious, because their craft tolerated mischief and meaning, and when he finished they threaded the collage into the archive where vows go to be believed. <words>313</words>
Consecration came not as thunder but as protocol: the machines hummed a low consent and the piece of sea pottery warmed like a secret listening to its name, and the swordsman murmured the vow aloud to anchor it in something that could not be deleted. <words>358</words>
He was both detached and lovingly engaged, a paradox the weavers liked because vows require witnesses who do not demand return, and the playful seriousness of his stance made the ritual intimate and absurd in equal measure. <words>395</words>
When he left the recycling center, the impossible vow had a pulse and the city smiled differently. <words>412</words>
