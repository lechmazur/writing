The sapped herbalist woke in a glass-walled observatory on an ocean cliff, blinking sunlight onto charts and a sleeping kettle. <words>20</words>
During napping after a fevered midday, she remained both dithering and stubborn, a thoughtfully thoughtless scholar who favored gestures over proof. <words>41</words>
Her motivation to study tide patterns had been precise and oddly personal; she cherished the rhythm like a relic, and she knew the price of perfection in every salt-creased page. <words>71</words>
A blacksmith's bellows sat improbably by a pile of dried rue and lavender, a heavy contrivance she had rescued because it pumped more than air into small experiments. <words>99</words>
She used it sometimes as a metronome, the bellows puffing breath across glass like a forced season, as if each exhalation could perfect a swell or hush a bruise in the sea. <words>131</words>
Her fervent indifference made the observatory a museum of neutral obsession: she adored data and scorned interruption with equal intensity, which allowed her to be cruelly kind to herself. <words>160</words>
During napping, she charted dreams as though they were high water marks, annotating crescent moon sketches and plotting the incline of foam on a ragged coastline. <words>186</words>
Sometimes a lone goose passed beneath the cliff, and by the flight path of a lone goose she timed her measurements, tracing the arc to predict when the tide would answer the moon's tug. <words>220</words>
Her hands were sapped by sleepless nights and continual pinching of stems, but her eyes stayed sharp, cataloging whirlpools as if they were specimens on a tray. <words>247</words>
She paid the price of perfection in calloused thumbs and missed meals, in a nervous gladness that tasted like salt, yet she would cherish each small, imperfect graph as a votive offering. <words>279</words>
A visitor once brought practical instruments and a smile; he admired the bellows and suggested calibrating against a clock, but she waved him away with fervent indifference and a herb-stained hand. <words>310</words>
She had become thoughtfully thoughtless about comfort; she slept on woven mats and let the bellows warm a cup of seaweed infusion when she needed courage to continue. <words>338</words>
Once, during napping, the observatory glass steamed with a demonstration she had staged, and she mapped how condensation fed fresh runnels that pretended to be tides. <words>364</words>
When storms rolled in, she remembered the bargain: pursuit cost solitude, and the blacksmith's bellows, an odd relic of action, kept her company as a mettle test. <words>391</words>
She would not trade the ache for the map's clarity; instead she learned to cherish interruptions like the goose, letting one arc redirect her observations toward mercy. <words>418</words>
In the glass-walled observatory on the ocean cliff she napped with charts under her arm, thinking into the tide, and measured how perfection had a quiet, costly tide of its own. <words>449</words>
