<story>
The repressed poet paused at the mouth of an overgrown city street reclaimed by nature, heart a quiet drum of both dread and wonder. <words>24</words>
He had made the spontaneous decision to explore a side road because lingering doubts had swollen into a question that would not be ignored. <words>48</words>
At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor, as absurd and precise as any omen, he felt the world contract into a single decision: to write, or to remain mute. <words>81</words>
He was secretly terrified of what the poem might actually demand of him, which only tightened his voice until it felt like a whisper behind glass. <words>107</words>
The antique perfume bottle he carried like a talisman chimed with memory and absurdity, a tiny cosmos trapped in glass and a scent he could not name. <words>134</words>
He wanted to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, not as violence but as a confession that would map his private heavens onto ordinary flesh. <words>160</words>
His knowing naivety made the desire both tender and ridiculous, like someone who believes a torn map can still guide sailors to stars. <words>183</words>
He moved forward, a spontaneous decision to explore a side road turning into a kind of ritual, boots brushing ivy and cracked tiles. <words>206</words>
The city had been reclaimed in quiet increments; trees unseamed sidewalks and vines braided through rusted streetlights, and pigeons nested like punctuation. <words>228</words>
He imagined the perfume bottle would teach him how to translate scent into ink, how a fragrance might be a key to body and beyond. <words>253</words>
Lingering doubts shadowed every image of the future like moss on stone, making his intentions both luminous and suspicious. <words>272</words>
He kept expecting an ambush of memory or ridicule, as if the city itself might accuse him for daring to make the private public. <words>296</words>
The perfume bottle popped its cork in his pocket with a tiny, impossible sound that matched the pin in the silent corridor and he laughed, startled. <words>322</words>
For a moment he considered turning back, the old impulse to hide his verses like contraband stirring, but the scent that seeped felt like permission. <words>347</words>
He pressed the bottle to the inside of his wrist and inhaled as if receiving a sacrament, imagining letters blooming under skin like constellations. <words>371</words>
Secretly terrified, he thought of the ambush again, how the world might retaliate against boldness by exposing the ugly seams of his life. <words>394</words>
But the knowing naivety in him believed that to be honest was to be reborn, that poems inked on skin could be a tender treaty between human and cosmos. <words>423</words>
So he began to write with a stub of charcoal from a ruined signpost, letters trembling but sure, drawing spirals and names like celestial cartography. <words>448</words>
A flock of pigeons startled like an ambush and the sound sent a pinprick of terror through him, but it also sealed the page. <words>472</words>
When he lifted his wrist the perfume had reacted with sweat to leave a faint starry stain, and his doubts became ornaments rather than shackles. <words>497</words>
