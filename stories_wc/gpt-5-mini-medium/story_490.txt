<story>
A fading caretaker at the caravan repair station waited on a sand-scraped bench after the waves receded from a deserted shore. <words>21</words>
He handled a dried lavender bundle with a kind of enthusiastic apathy, inhaling the dust of purple memories as if testing a map. <words>44</words>
The station smelled of oil and salt and old stories, tools arrayed like patient bones, and he moved methodically random through them to avoid boredom. <words>69</words>
His nickname long gone, his hands fading in steadiness, he pretended his work was a ritual and agreed with the sea that nothing was permanent. <words>94</words>
Yet a forbidden crate had been carried ashore the week before and he felt the allure of the forbidden tug at the sleeve of his curiosity. <words>120</words>
He told himself not to open it, quoting old codes and the caravan's fragile rules, and then gorged on defiance in small, precise bites. <words>144</words>
At night, between oil lamps and the creak of patched axles, he read by moonlight and by hacking ancient archives he taught himself how to unseal things. <words>171</words>
There was a method to his mischief, an oddly bureaucratic choreography: methodically random steps to fool both habit and conscience. <words>191</words>
The crate yielded a shard of glass that absorbed starlight and a whispering compass whose needle spun toward secrets, not north. <words>212</words>
He wrapped the shard in the dried lavender bundle and cradled it like a small, dangerous child, smiling without thinking. <words>232</words>
His fellow mechanics slept or stared at distant horizons; he practiced an enthusiastic apathy, proclaiming that discovery mattered but never mattered enough to wake them. <words>257</words>
When the compass murmured, he followed its soft insistence into corridors of rust and engine bones, filling his pockets with tiny relics and questions. <words>281</words>
He gorged, not on food but on forbidden knowledge, devouring maps of forgotten routes and recipes for stormproof glue with the same hungry calm. <words>305</words>
Each find knitted a new sky in his chest; his aim was to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy, to hold its gravity without naming it. <words>332</words>
Sometimes he worried that his curiosity would topple the station or summon storms back to the empty beach, but the worry was fond and academic. <words>357</words>
On a morning when salt glass glittered like broken promises, the compass fixed and a seam in the crate sighed open, revealing a velvet sphere the color of midnight. <words>386</words>
He picked it up as if it might burn or bless him, and he felt both amusement and a thin, bright terror that made him meticulously careless. <words>413</words>
Outside, the shore lay abandoned and patient; inside, he held the sphere and the dried lavender bundle and considered how forbidden things ask to be cradled. <words>439</words>
He decided to name it nothing, to let it orbit his palms without pronouncement, because naming feels like binding and he wanted only to cradle and learn. <words>466</words>
As the caravan coughed awake and the men shuffled to work, the fading caretaker walked to the shoreline, lavender and sphere in his arms, methodically random as a prayer. <words>495</words>
