He tended the wishing well with a disgruntled patience, an attendant who had learned to catalog hope like a ledger. <words>20</words>
His collection of foreign coins jingled in a tin, each currency a small map of other lives he would never live. <words>41</words>
The job had left him with the weight of scars, not all visible, some documented only in the slow tilt of his mouth. <words>64</words>
Yet tonight he was intensely relaxed, muscles unknotted, breaths measured, as if he had finally learned to move like a secret agent through a crowd. <words>89</words>
He was sitting at a crossing of two unwritten paths, an improbable waypoint that doubled as a secret agent escape route in local rumor. <words>113</words>
People came by with their coins and wishes, but he watched shadows instead, learning each outline as if it were a face. <words>135</words>
He used the method of following shadow patterns to corroborate intentions and detect routes, his eyes tracing absence rather than light. <words>156</words>
That evening a woman paused, palms open, foreign coin trembling between finger and thumb like a small confession. <words>174</words>
She was a courier, she said, though she did not wear the language of uniforms; instead she left a folded note for him under the stone lip. <words>201</words>
The note contained only coordinates and an inked phrase: out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts, which made his jaw tighten and his fingers remember. <words>226</words>
He had been tending the well to pay penance for a life that had cut others and himself, and now the phrase was a summons he could not let pass. <words>256</words>
At the crossing of two unwritten paths, the temporary alignment of sky and alley made an ache inside him settle into purpose. <words>278</words>
He gathered his tin, counting foreign coins by touch, feeling the rim of each scarred piece like a memory corroborating his guilt and resolve. <words>302</words>
A whispered map led him along the secret agent escape route: through rain-blurred corridors, past shuttered cafes where old ghosts might sit and judge in silence. <words>328</words>
Each corner he turned imposed the inherited mystery of the city, as if history had been sewn into the cobbles and the wind were its stitch. <words>354</words>
He felt intensely relaxed even as his heart sped, because he had reconciled that scars carried not only pain but direction. <words>375</words>
A shadow elongating across a wall verified the courier's story and corroborated the existence of a back passage; he followed that darkness like a lit fuse. <words>401</words>
