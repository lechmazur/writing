<story>
The fainthearted sentinel arrived at the secret society initiation chamber with a leash in hand and a heart trying to steady itself. <words>22</words>
Outside, the neighborhood strolled by amid dog walking that blurred the morning into ordinary rhythms, but inside the carved door the air was stitched with ceremony and low light. <words>51</words>
He felt intimately distant from both worlds, close enough to count breath and paw prints, far enough to measure his fear with a thin, flat instrument. <words>77</words>
He held a plain plastic ruler like a talisman and mistrusted it as both comfort and mockery of certainty. <words>96</words>
The illusion of security, he suspected, had been woven into the society's rituals as much as any sigil or oath. <words>116</words>
He drifted through the initiation chamber like a boat without an anchor, determined to wander until something definite emerged. <words>135</words>
His determination had the odd quality of wandering, a resolve that roamed among tapestries and vellum and returned with questions. <words>155</words>
At the center of the chamber hung a woven tapestry whose patterns promised grammar and meaning to anyone patient enough to look. <words>177</words>
He had come motivated to learn ancient writings, and the tapestry was said to be a map of those scripts folded into thread. <words>200</words>
He set the plain plastic ruler against the cloth to pick out alignments and to create a fragile order as he drifted his eyes across knots and colors. <words>228</words>
The ruler's straight edge gave him a metric that numbed panic; measuring, he could pretend the chaos abided by a line. <words>249</words>
Yet the more he traced, the more the design seemed to move, and with each drift of his gaze patterns suggested grammar rather than proof. <words>274</words>
One of the elders watched, amused and quiet, seeing both his intimate distance and his feint toward courage, and the sentinel felt exposed and oddly soothed. <words>300</words>
The elder's voice suggested a method: read through the patterns in a woven tapestry as if the cloth were a palimpsest of abandoned alphabets. <words>324</words>
He learned to track drift as technique, letting his attention wander along motifs until serifs and strokes resolved into meaning. <words>344</words>
Outside a dog barked twice and tugged its owner farther down the lane, a mundane metronome that confirmed the world kept moving. <words>366</words>
He was amid dog walking and society rites at once, learning to measure measures that were not merely inches but pauses, breaths, and ellipses of hesitation. <words>392</words>
The illusion of security softened; he saw the ruler's role was to convince, the chamber's candles there to placate, the vows to scaffold fragile resolve. <words>417</words>
Still he refused safety's comfortable lie; he drifted purposefully until the tapestry yielded a line of knot and color that read like a letter. <words>441</words>
When he copied it with the ruler, tracing its improbable alignments, meaning arrived not as verdict but as companionable hint, and his faintheartedness unfastened into steadier curiosity. <words>468</words>
He left the chamber differently poised, intimately distant no longer a paradox but a vantage, carrying the plain plastic ruler like a memory and the stitched sentence like a map. <words>498</words>
