In the seconds following a sudden revelation, the secret astral projector stood on the rusted abandoned carnival roller coaster track clutching an antique brass key like an offering to silence. <words>30</words>
He was a secret in the way a trained laugh can hide a wound, and he breathed with a practiced spontaneity that disguised how often he had to choose between lingering and leaving. <words>63</words>
He told himself sometimes always as a talisman, meanings warped by long nights of observing other people's exits; that odd attribute steadied him even as his astral self trembled at the threshold. <words>95</words>
In the seconds following that sudden revelation he chose to flee, not from panic but to preserve survival skills that had become quieter than his breathing. <words>119</words>
He fled along the elevated track like a shadow chasing its own echo, using a counterintuitive method by tracking sun shadows cast through the empty cars and skeletal supports to calibrate the safest route between sleepers of rust. <words>157</words>
The antique brass key burned cold and warm in his pocket as if it contained two prayers, one for the fretting body and one for the tether that let his mind move while the rest of him stayed hidden. <words>196</words>
His unyielding compassion compelled strange choices; he had learned to prioritize others' chances to flee faster than his own, because sometimes always the world rewarded those gestures with routes back to life. <words>228</words>
He left a small sign of his passing for anyone who might follow: the key threaded through a welded rail where a gap in the bolts made for a precarious foothold, and a folded scrap with a single instruction to watch the shadows. <words>271</words>
He felt both the discipline of a practiced spontaneity and the looseness of improvisation in his movements as he continued to map sun angles across the tracks and count possibilities like a gambler counting breaths. <words>306</words>
For a secret astral projector the risk was not exposure alone but the atrophy of instinct, so he fled and left tools and maps as small lifelines, training whoever found them to keep sharp the skills that meant surviving when the world forgot how to look. <words>352</words>
Night would come soon and the skeletal cars would sing with the wind, but he had practiced timing and could cross the track in cadence with a shadow's edge, teaching by example the cunning of small movements. <words>389</words>
When his astral double peeled away to scout ahead he felt the odd comfort of not being alone in choice, and he left part of his compassion imprinted on the rail so even the most exhausted traveler could feel a direction and keep going. <words>433</words>
