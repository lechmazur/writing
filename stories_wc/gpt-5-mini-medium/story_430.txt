A closed-off reaver sat on the bench in kaleidoscope park, watching sunlight fracture into confetti across a pond that remembered every small grief. <words>23</words>
He was charmingly grotesque in the way his smile revealed more holes than teeth, and children called him an ogre with a top hat and a secret shoebox of wishes. <words>53</words>
He kept that shoebox, a crumpled child's drawing folded inside like a relic, because the picture held a face that would not stop nagging him to be softer. <words>81</words>
Its lines were clumsy and honest, scrawled in wax and earnest anger, and the margins were full of scrawled poems that nagged with the patience of tide: "Come kiss the sky," one read. <words>114</words>
Those poems were pressed into the crumples like seeds planted to sprout old habits - generational patterns that looped in the family like a music box missing a tooth. <words>141</words>
Before the first lie was told, the park smelled of honest citrus and ink, and all the faces were the faces of potential truth. <words>165</words>
He was closed off by training and tide; he had learned to carve his want into edges so he could hold the world at arm's length and not be undone when it moved. <words>198</words>
But every margin whisper was a little needle, and the scrawled poems in margins nagged him like a grandmother cheeky with a broom, reminding him that his blood hummed with echoes. <words>229</words>
He wanted, monstrously and delicately, to taste the stars in a single kiss, to gather all the borrowed light into his mouth and not hate himself afterward. <words>256</words>
The drawing's stick figure had a crooked smile and a throat like a comet, and in a margin someone had written, "Do not let the small be swallowed by the promising big," which nagged him with a half-teasing cruelty. <words>295</words>
He folded the paper with ritual, smoothing the creases with fingers that smelled faintly of engine oil and sugar, and he answered none of the poems but hummed them under his breath until their rhythm loosened the armor around his ribs. <words>336</words>
A child with paint on her knees approached, eyes like honest coins, and offered another crumpled page with a new poem in the margin that said, in a handwriting both fierce and childish, "Taste everything soft before you decide how hard to be". <words>379</words>
He almost shoved the paper away, almost returned to solitude, but the mocking affection embedded in those words made him grin like a broken gargoyle, and he kissed the child's inked fingertips to taste the stars without asking permission. <words>418</words>
The kiss was small, absurd, and impossible to measure, and before he could call it betrayal or salvation the world answered with a rain of colored leaves and the park hummed with something that felt like forgiveness. <words>455</words>
He remained fundamentally a reaver, closed off and charmingly grotesque, a collector of edges, but the crumpled drawings and their margin poems had begun to alter the generational pattern by nudging him toward gentleness. <words>489</words>
