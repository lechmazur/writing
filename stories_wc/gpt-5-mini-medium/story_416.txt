<story>After the scoreboard resets at a championship match, the straight-laced knight smoothed his tabard and set out for the luminous swamp to gather urban legends. <words>25</words>
He spoke rarely, with laconic exuberance shaped like a clipped sword, because his motivation was cataloging whispers and verifying relics more than seeking glory. <words>49</words>
Academically rebellious despite his armor, he annotated margins with forbidden footnotes and smuggled theory into patrol routes, a scholarship quietly at odds with knighthood. <words>73</words>
The swamp glowed like a turned page; bioluminescent reeds hummed underfoot and ambivalent frogs kept time as if they were referees after the reset. <words>97</words>
He had one lead: a fossilized snail shell said to be an index of the town's myths, catalogued in rumor and locked behind the last shelf of a sunken apothecary. <words>127</words>
At the rickety counter he reached for the last item on a shelf and bumped into another hand at the same moment, the classic collision that would verify intentions and set two paths together. <words>161</words>
She was not a squire but an archivist with soot-streaked sleeves, academically rebellious in her own way, eyes bright with the thrill of urban legends awaiting proof. <words>188</words>
They both smiled, small and stunned; converging destinies, he thought, were less about fate and more about the exact moment two curiosities met. <words>211</words>
She clutched the fossilized snail shell like a thesis and he lifted his visor to verify the patina, tracing growth lines as if grading a dissertation on glacial time. <words>240</words>
Their methods differed: hers was archival patience, his was rigorous protocol, but both used the same furtive joy to squeeze facts from folklore. <words>263</words>
As they catalogued markings and compared notes by the phosphorescent reeds, the knight admitted a small rebellion—annotations inked in margins instead of pennants—and she laughed. <words>288</words>
Their conversation skimmed stadium metaphors because the time felt like after the scoreboard resets, a restart where legends could be replayed with new commentary. <words>312</words>
She wanted to collect urban legends as evidence that stories altered maps and etiquette; he wanted to verify that such stories kept citizens honest, a civic experiment disguised as curiosity. <words>342</words>
Outside, frogs scored unseen games, and the champion reeds reset their chorus, but here destinies converged into purpose, a duet of scholarly mischief and knightly order. <words>368</words>
When the fossilized snail shell split to reveal tiny barcodes of mineral record they realized verification was never purely scientific; it was a ritual of trust that rewrote both of their notebooks. <words>400</words>
