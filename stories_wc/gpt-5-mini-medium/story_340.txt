In the treehouse city braided through the Amazon's high canopy, a proud exorcist named Amaru balanced a battered wizard's grimoire on his knee as if it were both inheritance and indictment. <words>31</words>
That afternoon, when the clock dares to skip a beat and the city hummed with suspended birdcalls, he fingered the pages and felt the weight of responsibility settle like wet moss across his shoulders. <words>65</words>
With an endearingly feisty flare that made parrots gossip, Amaru joked about curses as if mockery were a talisman, half to keep fear from climbing his spine and half to keep the city amused. <words>99</words>
But when the usual ropewalk between the cedar spires slammed silent in a sudden closure, the ramshackle thoroughfare cut off the market and the apprentices who trailed him, and Amaru had to youthify his plan. <words>134</words>
He decided to youthify the ceremony - to replace solemn rites with quicksilver games, shouts, and handholds that would make tired elders grin and give the city's youngsters the lead role in exorcising the dark rumor of a looming shadow. <words>174</words>
Proudness pinched his jaw; he wanted to outshine that looming shadow not merely for applause but to prove that pruning fear could be done with a wink rather than a dirge. <words>205</words>
He opened the wizard's battered grimoire and found annotations where a previous sage had scribbled, 'Responsibility is a pocketknife: useful, dangerous, and always closing on a finger,' which made him smirk with weary pride. <words>239</words>
At the precise hour when the clock dares to skip a beat, a wind that smelled of river clay and mischief swept the platforms and the youngsters began to chant at his improvisation. <words>272</words>
The looming shadow manifested not as a hulking beast but as a trailing gloom along the underside of the trunks, and Amaru taught the children to throw lantern-light like confetti, to make brightness a competitive sport. <words>308</words>
He read an ancient charm in a voice that teased the letters, and the battered grimoire hissed like a cat offended to be petted, proving that even old books could be endearingly feisty when coaxed into a new life. <words>347</words>
Responsibility pressed at him, not as theatrical thunder but as a small, habitual ache that made jokes taste like duty, and he realized the sudden closure of the ropewalk had given him the exquisite misfortune of learning how to lead differently. <words>388</words>
He let them outrun his steps, encouraged mischief over solemnity, and watched light pile atop dread until even the shadow seemed embarrassed to linger. <words>412</words>
Later, with the grimoire snug and his chest lighter, Amaru smiled - playful, cynical, proud - and accepted that responsibility can be youthified into joy. <words>434</words>
