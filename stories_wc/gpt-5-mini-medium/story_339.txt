A joyless performer stood by the prismatic lake amid construction, balancing modestly extravagant costumes on a frame of careful restraint. <words>20</words>
They had come to organize the scattered props and their own memories as workers raised scaffolding and jackhammers drummed like unsteady metronomes. <words>42</words>
Her face, practiced into neutral eloquence, betrayed a life torn between truths: the honest ache of regret and the flattering spectacle of denial. <words>65</words>
She was modestly extravagant about one small thing, a simple drawer knob she kept unscrewed and polished until it gleamed like a tiny moon. <words>89</words>
That knob was ridiculous and necessary, an anchor for her hands and a token she could touch when old guilt tried to swell into public confession. <words>115</words>
She organized not only props but the loose chronology of apologies, receipts and faded tickets into small labeled boxes, arranging contradictions in neat rows. <words>139</words>
To hush the dissonance of old guilt she adopted a ritual: whenever the playground nearby answered the site with a single squeak, she paused and let that echo decide which truth to hold. <words>172</words>
It was not the sound of children but the echo of a squeaking seesaw in an empty playground that mapped her choices, a perverse compass for a performer split between confession and concealment. <words>205</words>
She moved along the lake's edge where prisms in the water refracted the dusty cranes and cement mixers into a riot of color that made her modest tastes look extravagant against the gray worksite. <words>239</words>
Each time the seesaw squealed in the empty frame of the playground, the echo traveled across the prismatic lake and she used it to weigh a memory, filing guilt into boxes labeled mercy or truth with trembling fingers. <words>277</words>
Her acts of organizing became a performance of confession without words, modestly extravagant gestures—a silk handkerchief smoothed, a faded ticket framed—meant to quiet the dissonance swelling under her ribs. <words>306</words>
At night, beneath the crane shadows, she would cradle the simple drawer knob and turn it as if unlocking a silence, whispering apologies to the reflected facets of the lake. <words>336</words>
Sometimes the seesaw sang more than once, and she found herself torn between truths again: to confess and risk undoing the modest theater she'd built, or to tuck more items into boxes and keep the guilt quiet. <words>373</words>
She practiced cautious abandon, letting her arms sweep through air and then rein them in, a choreography of near confessions shaped by the echo's whim. <words>398</words>
On the final day amid construction, when the cranes paused and a hollow lull folded the site, a single high squeak from the seesaw traced a line across the lake and she let the echo be the judge, opening a drawer and offering the knob to the water like a confession. <words>449</words>
