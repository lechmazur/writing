<story>
A moonlit archer crouched on the rim of a subterranean colosseum under an old amusement park, feeling the pull of a dangerous knowledge that hummed like a live wire in his ribs. <words>32</words>
He was a moonlit archer by reputation and aimlessly passionate by habit, a contradiction that made him both reckless and strangely tender when the night demanded a choice. <words>60</words>
Tonight his motive was simple and immense: to attain a legacy of compassion that would outlast the rusting rides above and the humiliations he had collected below. <words>87</words>
He gripped a bent fork like a talisman, its crooked tines proof that value can hide in discarded things, and he listened for instructions in the hollow echoes of the arena. <words>118</words>
Dangerous knowledge had come to him as a map of consequences, a ledger of choices written in symbols only some could read, and he kept it sealed in gestures and in the way he waited before releasing an arrow. <words>157</words>
Beneath the ferris wheel skeleton and midway games above, the colosseum smelled of damp paper and old popcorn, and on the sanded floor the pattern of fallen leaves had become a language he had taught himself to follow. <words>195</words>
He would use the pattern to find the safe corridor to the archive where the knowledge slept, timing his movement by the pattern of fallen leaves and the hush of the stands until the moment matched the final flight of a paper airplane launched from the rusted bumper cars above. <words>245</words>
During that final flight of a paper airplane he had promised himself he would not yield to the part of his heart that wanted spectacle; instead he moved with cautious impulsiveness, an odd double pace of checking and launching. <words>284</words>
The colosseum lights winked as if in applause when the paper plane skittered along a breeze shaft and at that slender instant he saw the ledger in his mind, the dangerous knowledge of which door to open and which story to tell. <words>326</words>
He could attain access by turning the bent fork in a seam behind a broken stand, by reciting names he had never said aloud, by tracing the leaf pattern that led past traps; each method demanded moral accounting and each method threatened harm if handled without compassion. <words>373</words>
His aimlessly passionate nature made the recitations imperfect, and at one point a whisper of guilt and a gust of dusty air almost toppled his balance, but he steadied himself with a breath meant for someone else. <words>410</words>
He opened a varnished chest and found not weapons but a ledger of names and remedies, dangerous knowledge rewritten as care for the broken. <words>434</words>
When the paper airplane finally landed on the arena floor, his chosen act of mercy echoed through the colosseum and the moonlit archer felt a legacy of compassion begin to gather weight like coins in an honest hand. <words>472</words>
