<story>
A missionary walked the glass desert during the migration of the last monarch butterfly, unconvinced yet compelled to test a faith that felt like thin glass underfoot. <words>27</words>
He carried a tarnished silver fork and a conviction to become a conduit for magic, which he explained to no one because intimacy in the desert was only with wind and wing. <words>59</words>
His faith was capriciously consistent, changing posture like a moon that always returned to the same lit face, and the fork was both relic and experiment. <words>85</words>
He had learned to conceal his doubt by decoding patterns in an untuned piano's echoes; he placed the fork on a cracked keybed, listened to the glass plain amplify the disharmonies, and read the intervals like scripture. <words>122</words>
That odd method concealed more than skepticism: it was his means to become a conduit for magic by proving patterns could compel reality when whispered into the right resonances. <words>151</words>
A single monarch landed on his shoulder as the migration traced a trembling silver arc overhead, a small, miraculous witness to his private experiment. <words>175</words>
He felt alone but intimate with that touch, as if the desert and the butterfly together read his resolve and weighed whether his capriciously consistent faith could hold under scrutiny. <words>205</words>
At night the untuned piano left behind in some mirage caravan sang in sonic fragments as he struck the fork against a string and then pressed his ear to shifting glass that echoed like cathedral bells. <words>241</words>
He decoded the echoes by pattern until the music bent around his desire, caprice and consistency braided together like barbed and soft vines. <words>264</words>
Once he thought he had the sequence, he concealed the fork under a moth-eaten cloak and followed the monarchs along their corridor of glass, because his experiment needed ceremony and migration offered a congregation. <words>298</words>
The congregation was thin: a wind that polished the dunes, gutters of light, and the distant paper wings of butterflies, yet that slender assembly felt sufficient to test what he had learned. <words>330</words>
He lifted the fork and let it vibrate in air tuned by memory, imagining that his body might be the final lever between pattern and possibility, that by concealment he would not hide but transmute. <words>365</words>
The monarchs blurred into a living current and for a long breath he thought the patterns answered, glass singing in harmonics that tugged at his chest and pushed something through him toward a sweetness he equated with miracle. <words>403</words>
Then, in the smallest hour, the answer was not a thunder but a hush: the fork cooled, the butterfly lifted, and he found himself less a conduit and more a channelled ear, his doubts dissolved into the intimacy of a world that had always been capriciously consistent. <words>450</words>
