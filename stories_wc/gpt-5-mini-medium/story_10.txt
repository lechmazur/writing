In the abandoned spaceport customs office amid the hum of server rooms, a cheerless duelist waited beside a maggoty wooden chest that rattled when someone breathed too close. <words>28</words>
He had come to learn the power of forgiveness because of fatal flaws that had hollowed his family like termites, and he kept vigil as if penance could be measured in hours. <words>60</words>
The chest was precisely innovative despite its maggots; its hinges had been elasticized by wild tinkering, a family method born through unexpected mutations of family recipes that turned varnish into something like flesh. <words>93</words>
Server lights blinked through broken blinds and catalogs of seized cargo lay in yellowed trays, while the chest rattled out a tiny percussion like a small animal rehearsing forgiveness. <words>122</words>
Once he had been famed for blade and ledger, duels settled by clean strokes and contracts, but his fatal flaw had been a ledger of pride that refused mercy and a blade that always found the final rib. <words>160</words>
He wanted to elasticize his rigid impulses, to stretch remorse into something forgiving, but guilt snapped back like a worn tendon whenever he reached for absolution. <words>186</words>
Precisely innovative experiments with spices and solvents -- recipes from his grandmother that had mutated across exiles -- produced a sap that stung and soothed in equal measure when smeared on old scars. <words>219</words>
He opened the maggoty wooden chest and the rattling eased into a story of ruined suppers, love notes folded between tins, and a torn apprentice contract that named him as both guardian and betrayer. <words>253</words>
The duelist held the contract and fed his palm with a paste made from those mutated recipes, feeling the sap elasticize his memory so that pain could be stretched and inspected without shattering him. <words>287</words>
A recorded chime from the customs server rooms hissed, and a ghostly playback of his mother's cooking -- her laughter, the wrong salt she forgave -- translated through static and clarified what his fatal flaws had cost others. <words>325</words>
He remembered the apprentice whose hand he had cut to prove a point, the recipe of mercy his mother had warned him to keep, and at last he forgave in a fit that was small and precise but true. <words>364</words>
The maggots quieted as if attendance had been paid, the chest no longer rattling, and the server hum seemed to approve with a low sympathetic pulse while he accepted that some repairs would take longer than a night. <words>402</words>
He traced the scarred ledger with a finger and began to rewrite entries, crossing out days of vengeance and inscribing small allowances for mercy learned in server-room nights. <words>430</words>
Outside the abandoned spaceport a ship screamed away, and he let go of the last brittle edge of pride, folding forgiveness into the chest and closing it with trembling hands. <words>460</words>
