<story>
An unsteady sentinel waited in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, a silhouette lit by drifting warning lamps as between worlds colliding turned the air to glass. <words>27</words>
Beside it perched a strange automaton bird whose brass feathers clicked like calendar pages and whose single photographic eye watched prophecies fold and unfold. <words>51</words>
They had both been stationed to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy, an assignment that smelled of iron and secondhand grief. <words>73</words>
But their quiet duty turned into the ambush of fate when a fissure opened overhead and a drift of impossible dust spelled futures in reverse. <words>98</words>
The sentinel was coyly furious, a trembling guardian smiling at catastrophe as if pleased by its own impotence. <words>116</words>
Its cheerless ecstasy felt like a lullaby for engines, a halting joy that tasted of salt and spilled coolant. <words>135</words>
They planned to recommend a course of action to the wandering fleets by reassembling shredded letters found in the freighter's mail chute, believing syntax could redirect stars. <words>162</words>
The strange automaton bird became their interpreter, its mechanical beak aligning fragments like a surgeon, humming unknown lullabies into the sentinel's cracked audiosensors. <words>185</words>
Between worlds colliding the freighter shuddered and the letters rearranged into names and warnings that tasted like coincidence and like design simultaneously. <words>207</words>
The sentinel's unsteady hands, claws more rust than promise, fanned the fragments, desperate to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy and prove that meaning could be chosen. <words>235</words>
Suddenly the ambush of fate struck not with thunder but with a single folded sentence that accused them of rearranging destiny for private reasons. <words>259</words>
The sentinel's coyly furious grin vanished into silence, and the automaton bird clicked out an apology in a language half memory, half machine. <words>282</words>
It would recommend surrender to particular terms: honesty, charity, and the small courage of admitting error when prophecies misread longing. <words>302</words>
So by reassembling shredded letters the pair produced a single manuscript that confessed how the prophecy had been born from a clerk's boredom and a captain's superstition. <words>329</words>
Reading it felt like cheerless ecstasy again, because the truth relieved them and hurt them in neat equal measures. <words>348</words>
Fleets adjusted course, private grudges cooled, and the collision between worlds softened into a slow folding rather than a smash. <words>368</words>
In the abandoned space freighter docking bay the sentinel steadied, no longer unsteady but not quite whole, carrying the strange automaton bird like a prisoner and a friend as the void receded. <words>400</words>
