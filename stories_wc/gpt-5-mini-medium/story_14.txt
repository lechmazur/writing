On the dock beside the tidal power monitoring station, a naive gambler laughed as the tide tapped a rhythm against rusted pylons. <words>22</words>
He kept a rustic candle mold in his jacket pocket like a talisman, believing small shapes could hold luck or secrets. <words>43</words>
During candlelit dinners at the monitoring station, technicians whispered about unspoken bargains written in the currents, and he listened with laughing tears. <words>65</words>
Those promises were rarely predictable, more like tides that turned on whims and moonlight, and they made his heart lurch with hope and dread. <words>89</words>
He had come to dock every dusk to check meters, to walk slippery catwalks, to argue numbers with engineers, but primarily to capture one last spark before oblivion. <words>117</words>
The naive gambler was not interested in policy or profit so much as in that incandescent moment, a private flaring that might prove he had mattered. <words>143</words>
At night the station hosted rebellious midnight lectures by unhinged professors who argued that the sea kept ledgers, spoke in voltage, and accepted bargains without signatures. <words>169</words>
They taught him to read the blinking lights like runes and to trade a coin for a rumor, and he took their doctrines as if they were scripture. <words>197</words>
Once, a professor leaned over a map and offered a plan via their midnight lectures, an unspoken bargain framed as an experiment: use the rustic candle mold to cast wax plugs that would reroute pressure and make the turbines sing at odd hours. <words>240</words>
It was rarely predictable whether mischief would succeed or flood the bay, but predictability had never appealed to him anyway. <words>260</words>
He spent candlelit dinners scoring blueprints against candle smoke, the rustic mold beside his plate like a compass, thinking of sparks and of names nobody would call him after the storm. <words>291</words>
He made the plugs with fumbling hands, each one a fragile promise, and once he docked the final wax piece into a crevice he felt the station inhale and the world tilt. <words>323</words>
Lights stuttered, alarms laughed like children, and for a breath the turbines answered his private invocation with a wild, erratic song. <words>344</words>
He cried with laughing tears, partly at the absurdity of a gambler who had trusted wax and midnight lectures more than contracts, and partly from the beauty of the machine's brief confession. <words>376</words>
The professors applauded as if at a play, not mad but vindicated, while engineers hurried shoreward to assess damage and data. <words>397</words>
His gamble paid in a way no ledger could measure: the spark he craved had flashed, messy and transient, leaving soot on his fingers and a ledger entry only he could read. <words>429</words>
When the tides settled and the professors dissipated into the fog, the gambler kept the rustic candle mold on a shelf, its hollow promising a memory of noise and a lesson about bargains unspoken but kept. <words>465</words>
He returned during candlelit dinners to watch meters and laugh with tears at how rarely predictable fate had been, satisfied he had captured one last spark before oblivion and kept it luminous and his alone. <words>500</words>
