<story>When only one star remained in a dimming sky, a fidgety mage-smith crouched in a lavender field tucked behind rusted factory ruins. <words>22</words>
His hands trembled around a collection of keys on a ring while his other palm smudged chalk from abandoned chalkboard notes he'd salvaged from the factory office. <words>49</words>
The notes mapped a desperate recipe for seeds of regrowth and the fragile ritual to remake the ruined soil into songless gardens, because he believed the smallest sprouts would hold chaos at bay. <words>82</words>
He was musically untalented and proud of it; no tuning could still his nervous fingers or the clatter of metal in his pockets. <words>105</words>
The collection of keys on a ring jingled at the wrong times, each key a tiny promise to open something that might yet remember the old languages of rain and root. <words>136</words>
He laughed with fearful joy as lavender stems tickled his knees and the last star dimmed to a thin pulse above the chimney shadows. <words>160</words>
The abandoned chalkboard notes were a palimpsest of chalked equations, half poems, and instructions he traced with a fingertip until the shapes made the right kind of hunger in him. <words>190</words>
Following those chalked diagrams he began to remake the seed carriers, hammering petals into metal casings and silencing springs that liked to sing. <words>213</words>
His fidgety hands moved with a smith's punctuation, small shakes that left nicked chalk on his palms and tiny brass curls under his nails. <words>237</words>
He remade not for glory but to hold chaos at bay, to stitch a quiet green into the seams of the city's feral metal. <words>261</words>
Each time a key turned in a brass pod a spit of soil breathed and the dim sky answered with a nervy pale of wind, as if the single star above watched and kept its breath. <words>297</words>
He sang terribly to the seedlings, croaks and offbeats that would have made a choir flee, but the plants did not mind his tone. <words>321</words>
There was fearful joy when a green tooth split through ash, and he half-smiled as if surprised by mercy in his own hands. <words>344</words>
Sometimes the factory's sleeping machines rattled awake and spat oily seeds that curled like questions, and he fumbled keys, cursing the rust and himself. <words>368</words>
He returned to the chalkboard notes, rubbing his palms on the board's dusty frame and copying a correction in a shaky hand that made the equations kinder to soil. <words>397</words>
Night tightened; he fitted a last key and whispered the altered notation aloud, ridiculous and hopeful. <words>413</words>
As the single star thinned further, green threads braided the ruins, and his trembling laugh kept the horizon. <words>431</words>
