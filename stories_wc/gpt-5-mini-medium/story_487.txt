<story>The docile bruiser moved through the greenhouse labyrinth like a patient storm, disturbingly calm as drums soloed in the glass rafters. <words>21</words>
He had the hands of a man who could break a jaw and the voice of someone who softened edges with a joke. <words>44</words>
By piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards he began to chart something less practical and more like destiny. <words>65</words>
He grinned with brash tenderness when a corner fit and the paper whispered of paths between monstrous ferns and man-eating plants. <words>86</words>
The baton sat in his jacket, a conductorâ€™s baton rumored to raise the dead, absurdly elegant against his scarred palm. <words>106</words>
He wanted the rumor to be true, not to resurrect corpses but to reawaken the city stories, to mold a myth from the mud of reality until people believed in the soft danger he carried. <words>141</words>
Language barriers stitched around him like vines; the gardeners whispered in dialects he could not parse and the plants hummed in frequencies more felt than heard. <words>167</words>
He preferred that distance because it let him assign meanings, to invent translations that suited the myth he would build. <words>187</words>
Drum solos thundered through the glass like impatient rain, a percussive heartbeat that set his hands moving in time with a plan and the plants swayed in counterpoint. <words>215</words>
He practiced conducting without orchestra, tapping at air with the baton until vines leaned as if answering a song they could not name. <words>238</words>
He remained disturbingly calm when a child asked if the map could summon monsters or miracles. <words>254</words>
His reply had the twist of honesty and misdirection: he said the baton raised stories, not skeletons, and that was almost the same thing in a city that wanted faiths to clutch. <words>286</words>
So he pieced and pieced, the shredded treasure map found under floorboards reconstructing desire, each seam a syllable against the greenhouse grammar of paths and teeth. <words>312</words>
When map and baton aligned he conducted a private ceremony amid drum solos, the percussive air thick with soil and chlorophyll and expectation. <words>335</words>
The plants leaned closer, tongues of vine unfurling like eager translators trying to bridge the language barriers between rumor and root. <words>356</words>
He tapped once and the fern that had nicked a gardener years ago recoiled politely, as if remembering manners from some ancestral grammar. <words>379</words>
The twist came when a torn scrap revealed not an X but a name, written in a language he could not read and yet understood in his chest like a chord. <words>410</words>
He translated the name clumsily to the gardeners with gestures, and in their eyes a story folded and favored his myth over their mundanity. <words>434</words>
So the city came, drumbeats carrying word like pollen, and people leaned into a greenhouse where danger smelled like moss and the bruiser blessed their need with brash tenderness. <words>463</words>
In the end the baton did not call back bones but conjured belief, and belief is sometimes louder and stranger than a returned corpse, which suited him fine. <words>491</words></story>
