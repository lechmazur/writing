When the morning paper lands on an empty porch, a coy spy crouches in the hedges like a cat rehearsing a theft. <words>22</words>
She wears borrowed valor as if it were a scarf, diabolically benevolent in the tiny smiles that hide her true intent. <words>43</words>
The witch's potion brewery across the lane glows like an inverted cathedral whose steeples are iron cauldrons and whose windows exhale perfumes of rue and possibility. <words>69</words>
Her mission is simple in its cruelty and its kindness: to bypass the brewery's enchanted ledger and learn the faces of townsfolk encoded in its steam. <words>95</words>
She will become a master of disguise by stealing not clothes but the quiet anatomy of people's habits, and the ledger is the map to that anatomy. <words>122</words>
To reach it she must bypass wards that turn lies into brambles, and for that she plans the impossible method she calls through reversed time. <words>147</words>
The method is diabolically elegant: she will unweave the morning into threads and step backward past consequence until the ledger's lock is a promise not yet made. <words>174</words>
A loose button clings to her cuff, a prop of triviality that will be planted on a careless magister to explain how she was seen, a tiny hinge for plausible falsity. <words>205</words>
In the half light when the paper settles, she slips between apple barrels and bubbling vats, every footstep borrowed valor and every breath rehearsal, rehearsing humility and menace at once. <words>235</words>
She bypasses a ward by unspooling the same morning until it is a ribbon and threading it through a knot in the brewery's doorway so time folds like cloth around her knees. <words>267</words>
Through reversed time she watches the baker's apprentice step back into bed, the cat unsteal the fish, and the magister reverse his glance, the loose button fluttering unheard into his pocket. <words>298</words>
Mended fences appear where disputes had once lain, literal pickets knitting like stitches when she undoes the scuffle in a single backward inhale, and neighbors wake with softened chins. <words>327</words>
Her diabolically benevolent calculations are moral architecture: she steals guilt from one pocket and tucks it into another, trading grudges for admission slips and awkward apologies. <words>353</words>
But she does not do charity; she learns faces by watching how people forgive, and each forgiven wrinkle is a mask she files in the long ledger of craft. <words>382</words>
When at last the brewery's lock is a question she steps forward in the true morning, the inverted cathedral now ordinary and the paper still damp on the porch. <words>411</words>
She fastens the loose button to her coat as if pinning a promise, and in that small ritual the town's ledger opens without blood or thunder, smiling like a gate. <words>441</words>
The coy spy learns to be a master of disguise not by theft alone but by mending fences, by knitting apology and subterfuge until both wear comfortably like garments. <words>470</words>
She leaves before gratitude can be measured, feeling a borrowed valor settle into her bones like a well tailored coat. <words>490</words>
