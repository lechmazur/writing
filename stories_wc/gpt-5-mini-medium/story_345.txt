<story>He was a lapsed priest in a labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds, moving with a dull radiance that made his repentance look like a streetlamp blinking at noon. <words>32</words>
Unapologetically confused and small in his cassock, he carried an abacus with missing beads like a confession in his pocket and counted nothing the way a man counts his sins. <words>62</words>
He would jog at dawn to remember how the body moves when the mind refuses to steward itself, a small rebellion against inertia. <words>85</words>
By following snow patterns he mapped choice into footsteps, because in the orchard the snowfall left diagrams between stalks and the frozen curves told him where branches would not catch him. <words>116</words>
The price of complacency was not theoretical here; vines grew around favors, and the thick quiet of the place taught negligence a language. <words>139</words>
He had been complacent once, content to tally souls with beads that never quite moved, and now the missing beads of his abacus with missing beads mocked him every step. <words>169</words>
He could feel the hush of fate unraveling around the topmost tendrils, and through the hush of fate unraveling each silence gave him a number he had to acknowledge. <words>198</words>
His motivation was precise and stubborn: to step beyond fate's design and prove that a man could choose where his feet took him in a place that seemed to count every breath. <words>230</words>
He was unapologetically confused about doctrine and direction, about whether leaving was cowardice or penance, and that confusion made him honest in a way piety never had. <words>257</words>
A dull radiance hung around his scalp and the pale path, not brash like prophecy but relentless as a ledger that keeps its sums. <words>281</words>
He jogged up a corridor of stalks, counting steps and omissions, following snow patterns that the wind left like thumbprints on the earth. <words>304</words>
Sometimes the patterns contradicted the abacus, and the missing beads felt like a debt that could not be forgiven by calculation alone. <words>326</words>
He had memorized sermons he no longer believed and learned new rituals of walking, learning to refuse the easiest path because the orchard punished complacency with slow entwining. <words>354</words>
At one fork he hesitated, the abacus with missing beads heavy against his palm, and he realized that counting had become a superstition that excused his past inattentions. <words>382</words>
Through the hush of fate unraveling he chose a ragged trail that showed no footprints, and his jog became a test of whether intent could alter the ledger of tomorrow. <words>412</words>
Snow patterns shifted as if embarrassed to reveal a different plan, and as he tracked them he saw that missing beads corresponded to choices not made, small vanishings that multiplied into ruin. <words>444</words>
He wanted to step beyond fate's design so badly that his heart felt like a fist trying to be a hand, and he laughed, unapologetically confused but steady, as the vines sighed and loosened. <words>478</words>
