<story>The peculiar collector sat at the heart of the probability mapping center, cataloguing futures like insects pinned under glass. <words>19</words>
He was infuriatingly calm, a man whose gestures betrayed no tremor despite the building's humming arrays. <words>35</words>
Across millennia his ledger stitched probabilities into corridors that survivors would one day walk, and he kept an old pencil stub between his knuckles like a relic and a weapon. <words>65</words>
He had been a peculiar collector since apprenticeship, gathering talents that were buried in people and places, talents that refused to be obvious. <words>88</words>
His motive was simple and urgent: to make a final stand against the erosion of possibility, to fling a door open where maps would otherwise only fold. <words>115</words>
The center required precision, and he toggled probabilities by tweaking algorithms, by adjusting weights until histories blinked into different alignments. <words>135</words>
Outside, halls catalogued epochs in glass cases labeled across millennia with dates that slid like fish, but inside he believed the buried talents mattered more than any calendar. <words>163</words>
He had learned to coax potential from silence by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench, translating their spacing into probability vectors. <words>188</words>
At night he sat with a lamp and the stub and sketched the minute differences that made one life flare while another folded into routine. <words>213</words>
To outsiders his habits looked eccentric, a parade of small tics and catalog cards, but his calmness remained infuriatingly calm even when datasets screamed contradictions. <words>238</words>
A technician once asked why he clung to the pencil, and he replied that blunt tools polished attention until buried talents showed their edges, small gifts waiting beneath sediment. <words>267</words>
He planned a final operation: a public mapping session that would not only expose probabilities but reverently unearth those private skills people had lost or never knew they possessed. <words>296</words>
When the board voted against expansion he felt the old safe thin with compromise and decided the center needed one honest rupture. <words>318</words>
On the night of the stand he arranged keys scavenged from a discarded piano bench across a long table and decoded their geometry into a public score. <words>345</words>
Attendees whispered of an eccentric finale, unaware that the piano bench pattern was a map to buried talents and to the subtle inclinations of choice itself. <words>371</words>
He lifted the stub and made a small tweak in the algorithm, a marginal nudge that amplified tiny probabilities of courage and curiosity in the waiting crowd. <words>398</words>
The mapping center hummed; numbers reoriented like tectonics, and fragmented lives felt a pulse they had not known was theirs. <words>418</words>
Someone in the back stood, then another, then a dozen, as talents once buried muttered awake: a violinist remembering her left hand, a mathematician recognizing a pattern in a streetlamp's shadow, a child humming theories like lullabies. <words>455</words>
His final stand had been less about defiance and more a benediction; in fractured grace he watched their hands find instruments and equations and small mercies. <words>481</words>
He handed them the stub and the decoded bench layout and smiled, infuriatingly calm, knowing across millennia lives speak. <words>500</words></story>
