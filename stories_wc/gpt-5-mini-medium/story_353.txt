<story>The small-town baker kept an emergency time machine garage behind his flour sacks, because when shadows learn to speak he had learned to listen. <words>24</words>
He was cynically gentle, folding kindness into dough while correcting apprentices with sarcastic warmth. <words>38</words>
Pressed flowers, carefully flattened between recipe books, served as bookmarks and as talismans against forgetfulness and fear. <words>55</words>
But the baker's true craft exceeded mere confection; he tended seeds of contagion that whispered revolution when watered with intent. <words>75</words>
They were small things he grew in a backlit jar inside the emergency time machine garage, a place smelling of oil and sugar and faint ozone. <words>101</words>
He cultivated them not to infect bodies but to plant ideas, to broadcast small impossible thoughts that would bud into disobedience. <words>122</words>
His motive was plain and dangerous: to dethrone a tyrant who had hollowed the town with decree and hunger. <words>141</words>
He tracked moon phases obsessively, measuring light as one measures proof; his method was simple, by tracking moon patterns and recording the tides of people's private nights. <words>168</words>
At certain lunations the pressed flowers exhaled faint scents that carried the seeds of contagion on neighborhood breezes, and conversations shifted like migrating birds. <words>192</words>
Rumor became strategy; it exceeded the baker's own expectations as shopkeepers hesitated to bow, and a widow refused to close her shutters. <words>214</words>
Neighbors, once taught to fear the tyrant's shadow, began to speak back when dusk thinned; the same shadows that had been mute now offered counsel in gravelly voices. <words>242</words>
The baker, cynically gentle and alarmingly patient, mapped those voices against his lunar charts and the time machine's clocks. <words>261</words>
He exceeded the tyrant's surveillance by syncing small uprisings to moonrise, so a hundred tiny refusals would join like a tide that could not be stopped. <words>287</words>
One night, when the moon crouched like a listening animal, the garage hummed and the time machine spat out a small brass gear stamped with a pressed flower motif. <words>316</words>
It was a token that exceeded superstition; in its teeth the baker tucked seeds that would sprout slogans when placed beneath doorframes. <words>338</words>
By dawn the town wore small handbills of defiance blooming like weeds, and the tyrant found no easy way to stamp them out. <words>361</words>
The tyrant raged, his decrees laced with threats, but the people's whispers had become a contagion the state could not name, and that namelessness was armor. <words>387</words>
In the end the dethroning was quiet: a cart refused to deliver the tyrant's bread, and his palace lights blinked out one by one. <words>411</words>
Later, the baker sat in his oil-streaked garage with a cup of cooling tea and a single pressed flower on the table, listening as the shadows praised him in notes like wind through wheat. <words>445</words>
He smiled, cynically gentle to the marrow, knowing that he had exceeded what anyone thought a baker could do and that the seeds of contagion, once planted, were free. <words>474</words></story>
