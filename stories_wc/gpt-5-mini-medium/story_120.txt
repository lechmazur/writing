I am a time-looping paramedic who measures urgency in the pulse of repeating mornings. <words>14</words>
Privately public, I wear my uniform like a confession and a billboard. <words>26</words>
In the quantum tunnel behind the hospital elevators, time folds and coughs into a pattern I both dread and memorize. <words>46</words>
At the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess I arrive on loop number thirteen with the same weathered fishing lure tucked in my chest pocket as if it were a talisman. <words>77</words>
By the sound of a single raindrop I close my eyes and map where the next collapse will be, listening for the small hollow that predicts a body or a secret. <words>108</words>
Excited boredom guides my hands, the odd being where adrenaline meets practiced indifference. <words>121</words>
I nest the lure against a damp palm, remembering the fisherman from the river district who taught me to tie knots around loss. <words>144</words>
It sits like a memory in metal and paint, nicked and patient, an emblem for all the unhealed traumas that arrive before the siren. <words>168</words>
Patients fold inside my shifts like paper boats, and I fold right back into the tunnel with their scents and confessions lodged under my skin. <words>193</words>
Each loop rewrites what I think I have healed, revealing stitches that never caught, names I swore I had buried but which keep turning up in griefs and wrist scars. <words>223</words>
I swore years ago, standing beneath a hospital bell and a smaller church bell, that I would baptize your nightmares in acceptance, even if I repeated the oath until my voice frayed. <words>255</words>
My motive is practical and ceremonial; between calls I lay patients' terrors on the lure like offerings and whisper absolutions with the bored cadence of ritual. <words>281</words>
Once I held a child's hand as the bell rang and the quantum tunnel hiccuped, and by the sound of a single raindrop I knew which memories would surface when the loop reset. <words>314</words>
Those memories are privately public things: family photos on stretchers, whispered apologies in waiting rooms, a funeral hymn humming from a television no one looks at. <words>340</words>
I baptize not by water but by attention, by naming every fracture until acceptance sinks in like light through a cracked lens. <words>362</words>
There is a private ceremony I perform at the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess where I tie the lure to a branch and nest the pain into the wood so it might rot honestly. <words>397</words>
When the bell echoes again, I step back into the loop with the bored eagerness of someone who knows the script but still cares enough to change a line. <words>426</words>
By the sound of a single raindrop I baptize myself too, letting acceptance in small increments until the loop loosens and the nightmares learn to sleep. <words>452</words>
