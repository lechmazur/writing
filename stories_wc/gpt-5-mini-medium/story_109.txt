<story>
I am a cold natured knight who keeps time in a secret agent center at the hush of a deserted intersection late at night. <words>24</words>
My lawfully rebellious oath makes me obey an odd calendar of errands that the center assigns me, but tonight my mission is quieter, devoted to support rather than surveillance. <words>53</words>
I move like a sentinel through corridors of muted glass and code, but my hands hold a softer task: to collect folk remedies that families whisper about in closed kitchens. <words>83</words>
There is a child's lost mitten in my pocket, its wool faded a small map of small histories, and it guides me toward an incomplete family altar stitched into the margins of this city's living rooms. <words>119</words>
The altars are incomplete because lives are fractured by duty and secrecy, and I support those voids by placing tinctures, whispered recipes, and the mitten like a petition on cold steps. <words>150</words>
My presence at the hush of the deserted intersection is absurd and necessary; agents pass me in tailored coats without knowing that healing can be bureaucratic and ceremonial at once. <words>180</words>
Each remedy I collect feels like paint, each recipe a color, and the ritual of arranging bottles and bark on the altar sparks an artistic awakening inside me that I had not expected. <words>213</words>
It softens the armor around my heart and makes me notice the mitten's uneven stitch, a child's clumsy attempt at care, and for a moment the knight in me remembers being small. <words>245</words>
I am lawfully rebellious in that I follow directives but bend them toward mercy, so the center's forms are stamped and filed while I secretly leave a vial and a folded scrap where the altar is barren. <words>282</words>
A woman with tired eyes finds the mitten one dawn and cries quietly; she thanks me by placing a sprig of rue on the altar, and I accept that small justice as payment. <words>315</words>
My artistic awakening does not make me gentle entirely, but it makes my decisions less absolute and teaches me that art, law, and care can compose a single, stubborn symphony. <words>345</words>
At midnight I walk back to the center, the secret agent center feeling less like a fortress and more like a studio where thresholds between duty and devotion are blurred and honored together. <words>378</words>
When younger officers ask why I carry a mitten and a notebook of recipes on my rounds, I tell them plainly that supporting incomplete family altars heals the city in ways their reports cannot, and I watch them reconsider the lines they have drawn. <words>422</words>
