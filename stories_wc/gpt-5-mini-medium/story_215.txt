<story>The rattled exorcist paced the linoleum halls of the psychic research facility, voice clipped but eyes restless amid dance lessons scheduled next door. <words>23</words>
He was inwardly social, an odd mix of small talk and private tremors that made colleagues both trust and avoid him. <words>44</words>
Rattlement came from the living rooms of others, he said, and yet he kept a lab notebook where guarded disclosures were logged like fossilized confessions. <words>69</words>
The postcard arrived on a Tuesday: a vintage postcard of a seaside pier, its colors browned like an old bruise and a thin line of handwriting promising a secret. <words>98</words>
He turned it over, fingers shaking not with fear but with something like intent; the stamp was a cipher key and the address led to an archive room few remembered. <words>128</words>
The facility director had taught them to synthesize data and anecdote: to prove phenomena without robbing it of awe, a project intended to entwine science with wonder. <words>155</words>
He liked that mission but hated the hubris it invited, and he approached experiments like dance steps learned simultaneously amid lessons he tried not to miss. <words>181</words>
The postcard's message was coy: three numbers, a sketch of concentric circles, and the word 'return' scrawled with a tiny aggression that felt like a dare. <words>207</words>
He catalogued the elements in his lab, hesitated, then used the stamp cipher to align data from psychic imaging, sensory logs, and the old facility blueprints. <words>233</words>
Those alignments became a series of puzzles: numerical locks nested in photographs, light filters that revealed hidden ink, a rhythm code you could only solve if you kept time with a waltz. <words>265</words>
He worked through them between rehearsal breaks, breath counting, shoulders loosening as if the movements he practiced in class could steady hands tracing tiny screws. <words>290</words>
Staff thought him a curiosity and a bridge; some confided rumors to him because his sociability was inward, a private warmth that made disclosures feel safe yet guarded. <words>318</words>
One night the final puzzle yielded a hinge and the lab floor sighed open to a narrow stair leading to a hidden room beneath the archives, the air smelling faintly of salt and ink. <words>352</words>
Inside, a single table bore artifacts: spectral readouts, a broken metronome, and the same vintage postcard placed face up as if waiting for his arrival. <words>377</words>
A recorded voice flickered when he touched the card, coy with technical certainty, urging him to synthesize method and myth, to make experiments that felt like ceremonies. <words>404</words>
He thought of the students down the hall at the studio where amid dance lessons they learned to phrase steps and breathe, and he imagined a protocol that taught delight as rigor. <words>436</words>
His hands stopped rattling then, steadied into a sly, aggressive calm; he would publish methods in journals and stage small rituals in community rooms to show colleagues how to measure wonder. <words>467</words></story>
