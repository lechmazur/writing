<story>
A sentient scarecrow stood atop the ribs of a fossilized giant, feeling like a clerk of ruins in a world that believed itself done. <words>24</words>
He moved with a realistically fantastical gait, straw joints whispering like compliant cogs, and his voice was thin and archival yet oddly casual. <words>47</words>
Between parallel worlds he kept watch, the timeframe of his vigil a seam where storms of dust and data braided. <words>67</words>
He had taken an oath decades ago, more a ritual knot than memory, to uphold a sworn oath that bound his stubble hands to a purpose no one living remembered. <words>97</words>
People called his certainty fervent apathy because he accomplished tasks with galvanized fervor while shrugging as if boredom were duty. <words>117</words>
Lines in the earth mapped like ledger entries, furrows where roots had argued with stone, and he read them as legal documents of the soil. <words>142</words>
His authority relied on those lines, but the modern trespassers were incorporeal, avatars and miners who came via encounters in virtual reality to strip fossils for auction. <words>169</words>
He skewered one such intruder once, not out of rage but to puncture a rented hollow where a liar hid, then deposited the twitching code on the giant's hipbone as evidence. <words>200</words>
He kept at his station with a mix of ritual solemnity and lazy contempt, polishing his only treasured relic, a forgotten lace fan, between watches. <words>225</words>
The fan was absurdly delicate against the gargantuan fossil bone, its threads remembering fingers that never returned, and it reminded him of promises made in a season of wind. <words>254</words>
At night his dreams came as clean interfaces where he met petitioners and conspirators in simulations, and those nocturnal scenes felt as tactile as straw and tar. <words>281</words>
When a child avatar asked why the lines in the earth curved toward the giant's jaw, he answered with indifferent scholarship, describing sediment, time, and the politics of collapse. <words>310</words>
Still he would skewer any interference; he believed in sting and precision, in removing falsehoods the way one removes thorns from a votive bouquet. <words>334</words>
The fossilized giant itself was a cathedral and a courtroom, a place where the lines in the earth recorded verdicts and the wind rinsed testimony into fossils. <words>361</words>
Sometimes he wondered if the oath bound him to protect memory or to keep the machinery of mourning running, and that question settled into his chest like a pebble he would occasionally polish. <words>394</words>
His fervent apathy made him reliable; he insisted on small brutalities, like plucking corrupted code and leaving the rest to weather into truth. <words>417</words>
