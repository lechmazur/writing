<story>
I am a meandering bard who learned to carry a map of silences and a satchel of jokes. <words>18</words>
My face is ordinary, my footsteps ordinary, but I consider myself ordinarily extraordinary because I find miracles in gutters and margins. <words>39</words>
I live in a labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain, where shelves climb like cliff faces and ladders become bridges between epochs. <words>61</words>
Between the stacks are narrow alleys and coal lit basements that host seedy bars, the kind with sticky stools and audiences practiced at forgetting. <words>85</words>
It was in such a bar that I first learned to sow feelings, to plant small seeds of warmth in cracked hearts with subversive puppet shows staged under a flickering lamp. <words>116</words>
I used glove puppets sewn from bookcloth and a prop that startled and charmed: a set of dentures rumored to belong to a famous figure, polished enough to catch the lamplight like a small sun. <words>151</words>
People laughed at the rumor at first, then noticed how the dentures reflected a radiating warmth that seemed to fill the room with someone absent but kind. <words>178</words>
My motive was simple and stubborn: to stir hearts grown cold before I sent an apologetic text whose typing stalled me in a lull of dread and hope. <words>206</words>
The lull stretched like a crease in a beloved letter and I wandered the mountain aisles rehearsing puppet dialogues with the dentures performing silent smiles. <words>231</words>
My shows were subversive because I told the truth through fable and insult, because I made kings trip on their pride and gave waitresses crowns cut from receipts. <words>259</words>
People who had hardened into habits of ignoring looked longer, drew nearer, and sometimes wept in the cramped dark as the dentures shone and a puppet fox confessed to a wrong it would not fix. <words>294</words>
I am ordinarily ordinary in my daily failures, yet the mountain bookstore allowed me the impossible leisure to be gentle and sly in equal measure. <words>319</words>
Those nights I sowed not grain but recollection, scattering the quiet seeds of apology and daring, and the dentures glinted like an ember held between puppet teeth. <words>346</words>
A fractured idyll settled over the mountain: laughter stitched to sorrow, smuggled songs, a warmth that was honest because it admitted fracture. <words>368</words>
In the lull before my thumb hovered, I felt the strange responsibility of being a conduit, a meandering hand pushing an apology into being by sowing a dozen tiny confessions across smoky rooms. <words>401</words>
When I finally typed the first shaky word of the apologetic text, the room felt warmer, as if the dentures had passed on a residual glow to my fingers. <words>430</words>
I sent the message because the puppet fox and the dentures had taught me that small contrition can rekindle ordinary lives into something luminous. <words>454</words>
Then the bar applauded not for spectacle but because they felt sown to one another, and the mountain bookstore exhaled a sigh like a turned page. <words>480</words>
I walked into dawn with the dentures in my pocket and warmth in my chest. <words>495</words>
