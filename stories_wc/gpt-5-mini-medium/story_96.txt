<story>An underground poet kept his hands busy in the witch's familiar menagerie, murmuring to cats and crows while a kettle sighed behind him. <words>23</words>
It was during blanket crocheting that he found an antique map with a tear tucked into a basket of yarn. <words>43</words>
The paper smelled of mothballs and tea; the map seemed statically unique, as if its lines refused to agree with any compass, and the tear stitched a story across a bay. <words>74</words>
He read the map with a disinterested passion that made his voice low and slightly amused, the way someone reads a menu while already half full of plans. <words>102</words>
He had arrived at the menagerie through volunteer stints in odd places, an odd resume for a poet but perfect for a person who liked small economies of surprise. <words>131</words>
Those stints taught him where objects slept and how intention could be borrowed, and they gave him access to the menagerie’s back rooms where familiars slept like folded fortunes. <words>160</words>
He wanted to seize an ending and turn it into an encore; his motivation was to surprise fate with an unplanned encore, a small rebellion against tidy endings. <words>188</words>
He practiced disinterest as a craft, listening with a bored smile while plotting the exact moment to pounce with a line or a gesture that felt accidental. <words>215</words>
During a lull, a familiar—a fox—nudged a teacup from a shelf and it landed brimming cup with rosemary broth, wobbling like a small truth. <words>239</words>
He almost didn’t care, and that almost-caring lent gravity to his fingers as he reached, hair indifferent and eyes calculating, to seize the cup before its contents could stain a map. <words>270</words>
His hand closed and something about the moment felt like an unannounced encore, a second breath that surprised even him. <words>290</words>
He set the cup on the map and, as yarn slipped through his fingers during blanket crocheting, he traced the tear as if sewing the map back into possibility. <words>319</words>
The familiars watched with something like bored devotion, a jury of whiskers and tilted heads that rewarded small mischief with steady purring. <words>341</words>
He imagined the map leading to a room where applause might exist, a place where fate could be surprised by an unplanned encore and maybe cough up a second chance. <words>371</words>
This was not earnest hope but a disinterested passion: a deliberate shrug that nevertheless burned, like a cigarette held for the aesthetic of not needing it. <words>397</words>
He would use his volunteer-earned knowledge to stage something small and pure, to seize a private stage and let the map's torn coast sing. <words>421</words>
He rose, towelled yarn on his knee, and walked from the menagerie with the brimming cup and the antique map with a tear tucked like a secret. <words>448</words></story>
