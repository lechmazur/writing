<story>
He waited in the abandoned circus dressing room, the mirrors shadowed and the costumes sagging like exhausted planets. <words>18</words>
Across the hush of dawn's second breath he listened for a cue that never came. <words>33</words>
He was a tortured protector of small things, of broken promises, and of a cracked porcelain doll kept in a velvet box. <words>55</words>
The doll's smile was suspiciously sweet, as if someone had learned to make mercy with too much sugar. <words>73</words>
He had promised once to protect her from curiosity and from the stars, a vow said under a planetarium's dome during a chance encounter at a planetarium show. <words>101</words>
That show had opened a map of constellations on their laps and unleashed a future neither expected. <words>118</words>
Tonight his hands smelled of stage glue and jasmine, the latter annoyingly insistent and suspiciously sweet again. <words>135</words>
He had come back to embrace a fate once denied, not to run anymore from the night's riddles. <words>153</words>
The dressing room smelled of popcorn ghosts and moth wings, and the cracked porcelain doll sat propped on a chair like an accusation. <words>176</words>
He remembered the planetarium woman with the comet laugh, who had offered him a choice between safety and seeing; that choice had sent him here. <words>201</words>
Confronting the unknown had always been the crueler classroom than any funhouse corridor he'd repaired for others. <words>218</words>
He had made wards from threadbare sequins and iron teeth, but tonight he planned to unleash something gentler and more dangerous. <words>239</words>
The doll blinked, a hairline crack at its temple catching the dawn like a horizon line, and he read the tiny fracture as language. <words>263</words>
A chance encounter at a planetarium show had given him the courage to translate that fracture into motion. <words>281</words>
He wound the aged key he carried like a confession and felt the mechanism respond with a small relieved sigh. <words>301</words>
The doll's voice, when it came, was sugared and oddly steady, suspiciously sweet but precise as a ledger. <words>319</words>
It asked him what he wanted to unleash: the old protections or the new curiosity that had been kept sealed away. <words>340</words>
He thought of the planetarium dome and of the woman's hand in his, a small warm comet that had pointed him toward a sky he'd feared. <words>366</words>
To embrace a fate once denied meant walking out past the dressing room's velvet and into the circus lot where rust met grass and night met morning. <words>393</words>
Across the hush of dawn's second breath the horizon felt like a promise or a dare, and his mouth tilted into something like a grin. <words>418</words>
He told the doll he would unleash the curiosity, that he would let the unknown in and stop stitching the world back together to shield someone else from wonder. <words>447</words>
The doll's cracked eye caught the dawn and unlatched like a small sun, and the room filled with the soft geometry of possibility. <words>470</words>
He stepped into that geometry to embrace what he had once denied, protector and pilgrim at once. <words>487</words>
