I am a blunt heretic who keeps a worn-out teddy bear in my satchel as an affront to the sanctity of the forgotten library inside a deserted temple. <words>28</words>
At the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears I stand with enthusiastically cautious confidence, breath tight, cataloging the stacks for the mechanism that will let me speak to an omniscient mind. <words>60</words>
My bluntness is necessary; as a heretic I do not dress doubts in ritual politeness but announce problems loud enough to rattle plaster and dust from stained vellum. <words>88</words>
The teddy bear, threadbare and missing an eye, is a repository of old promises whispered by my mother and by those who swore this temple would keep their debts to history. <words>119</words>
I approach the dusty ticker with enthusiastically cautious fingers, palms damp but steady, because my motive is not mere curiosity but to match wits with an omniscient mind that once cataloged law and prophecy in this room. <words>156</words>
The method of battle will be through the jumbled codes in an outdated stock ticker that snakes like a stubborn ribbon across the librarian's table, characters flaking like ancient paint. <words>186</words>
When the ticker coughs and coughs again, rearranging its digits into a mockery of prophecy, my pulse hops in anxious elation and my tongue prepares to parry riddles in bare, irreverent sentences. <words>218</words>
The forgotten library smells of mold and paper and the history of compromises, every shelf a stratigraphy of arguments, and the deserted temple hums with a memory that pretends not to watch me. <words>251</words>
I whisper an old promise into the bear's ear - a line I promised to the dead and to myself - and the whisper stings the ticker as if the machine recognizes contracts signed in desperation. <words>285</words>
The omniscient mind answers in a flurry of broken quotations, blinking theorems, ledger entries and stock prices that mean something only when strung like beads, and I meet each flash with blunt questions. <words>318</words>
Each exchange is a battle where punctuation is armor and commas are shields and my brain leans forward with enthusiastically cautious ferocity, tasting victory like citrus and fearing the abyss behind every correct answer. <words>352</words>
At the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears - a yellowed slip of vellum with a smear of a child's ink fight-scrawl - the ticker lights a single coherent code and the temple inhales. <words>385</words>
The omniscient mind throws a theorem like a gauntlet, citing the promise my mother made, how she signed her name in ledger margin and hid the proof inside a child's toy, and the bear trembles. <words>420</words>
I answer with the blunt heretic's logic: I do not worship answers, I dissect them, and I present the old promise back as evidence that humans traded certainty for survival, then ask if the mind would do the same. <words>459</words>
The mind hesitates - a pause measurable in footnotes - then concedes in a neat string of numbers that translates, absurdly and beautifully, into forgiveness, and I laugh, anxious and elated, because by keeping a child's promise I have matched wit for wit. <words>500</words>
