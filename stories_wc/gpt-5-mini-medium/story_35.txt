<story>
At the universal translation center, a quiet gardener sat by a narrow window amid bird calls, cataloging silences with the patience of winter. <words>23</words>
They were there to understand the language of emotions, a motivation that felt like a compass in their chest. <words>42</words>
An embroidered purse lay open on his lap, its stitches mapping a small atlas of recovered memories that returned in edges and scents. <words>65</words>
The gardener's recollections were regularly random, arriving as if a pocketwatch of moments wound itself by whim. <words>82</words>
Once, during a shared experience at a silent retreat organized by the center, a tiny flicker of recognition leaped between strangers. <words>103</words>
The universal translation center had been built to decode speech and feeling alike, a lab for converting sighs into comprehensible scripts. <words>124</words>
He practiced listening like a gardener tends roots, patient and absurd, because he wanted to understand the language of emotions in its raw dialect. <words>148</words>
An improbable longing unspooled inside him when he traced a forgotten floral motif on the purse, as if the embroidery whispered names. <words>170</words>
They returned amid bird calls, fragile frames of childhood and the smell of rain on a roof that he could not yet name. <words>193</words>
In the hush, other faces folded their private light into his, and the center's devices recorded patterns he could not yet articulate. <words>215</words>
Sometimes a single flicker of facial muscle or the tilt of a cup was enough to translate a knot of feeling into remembered names and faces. <words>241</words>
When the gardener opened the embroidered purse to show a companion a moth pinned in a pocket, the pattern of his life rearranged itself. <words>265</words>
They practiced naming the unnamed quietly, pressing words against the soft architecture of feeling until meaning adhered like dew. <words>284</words>
Recovered memories came not as explanations but as weather, unpredictable and illuminating, teaching him new grammar for consolation. <words>302</words>
Night after night he copied gestures into a ledger, believing that to understand the language of emotions one must learn its punctuation and pauses. <words>326</words>
In that improbable longing he found humility: that the center could teach translation but only the quiet gardener could trace the tender grammar of a life back into speech. <words>355</words>
Once a memory returned fully: his mother humming beside a window, fingers moving like tiny translations across the embroidered purse, and the sound fit the stitches. <words>381</words>
He described it later, without words at all, by holding the purse between both palms while the others listened with their faces, and something like syntax formed. <words>408</words>
