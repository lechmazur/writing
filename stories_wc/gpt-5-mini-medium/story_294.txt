<story>The dry-tongued bard arrived in the giant mushroom meeting hall during the hush of a dreamless night, carrying a stained glass prism and a gorgeously awkward confidence.<words>27</words> He had a mouth like old parchment and a tongue that stuck to truth, but his fingers knew how to preserve sound like delicate trophies.<words>52</words> The cloak of doubt hung at his shoulders like damp moss, a philosophical garb he both loved and feared because it protected him from others and trapped him within himself.<words>82</words> He had come tonight to test whether preserving small truths could loosen the prison of the self, or whether preservation would only varnish the bars.<words>107</words> The mushroom hall breathed spores like slow exhalations, its curved columns and glowing caps making a cathedral out of fungus, and his steps whispered conviction and fatigue in equal measure.<words>137</words> He set the stained glass prism on a low stone table, where moonlight passed through colored shards and painted the ceiling with hesitant hymns.<words>161</words> In his throat something like a song was fossilized, and he planned to preserve it in the prism so that his softer truths would not erode into excuses.<words>189</words> He considered the gorgeously awkward motions he always made when he tried to be brave, the way his hands trembled and his sentences tilted toward confession, and he decided confession could be preserved like a pressed flower.<words>226</words> But he did not trust his memory to hold tone or texture, so he used a method that felt absurd and intimate: forgotten voicemails collected on a tiny singing device, each a sleep-rough draft of his self.<words>263</words> He played them into the prism, letting the fractured glass splice and scatter his voice until the shards reunited into clarity or something like it.<words>288</words> As the prism kept the sound, the cloak of doubt shifted, not with thunder but like a slow shrug, loosening at the collar and revealing the possibility that doubt need not be a prison but a lens.<words>325</words> Dreamless night was absolute and forgiving; spores fell in soft script and even the other attendees, bureaucrats of mycology and lonely governors of caps, breathed like sympathetic clocks.<words>353</words> He listened to voicemail drafts where he had begged to be kinder, where he had admitted fear, where he had asked to be spared from himself, and each admission slid into the prism as a grain of preserved light.<words>392</words> A gorgeously awkward smile uncurled on his face, not theatrical but honest, and the habit of hiding felt thinner as the preserved voicemails radiated a modest courage.<words>419</words> He walked out into the hollow night relieved and wary, the cloak of doubt yielding space for voice, and the prism held his preserved self until morning taught him how to speak differently.<words>452</words></story>
