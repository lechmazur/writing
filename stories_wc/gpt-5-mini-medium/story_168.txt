<story>
At the heart of a mysterious stone circle a ruthless flower arranger waited, arranging petals like coded flags. <words>18</words>
She was intellectually spontaneous, quick to reshape an offering or an accusation with a smile of polite anarchy. <words>36</words>
Clipped in her hair was a scuffed plastic comb that caught moonlight and secrets, used more as a talisman than a tool. <words>58</words>
She bore the watcher's burden with a practiced tilt of the head, an ache that taught her to listen when others only saw stones. <words>82</words>
In the pause between a singer's verses the circle hummed, and the arranger used the silence to distinguish rhythms carved into weathered rock. <words>105</words>
Her motivation was simple and obsessive: to decode rock art before its logic dissolved into tourist postcards and forgetfulness. <words>124</words>
She traveled light, but not alone, inviting strangers during impromptu stumbles of road and mood, testing theories through spontaneous road trip conversations and badly brewed coffee. <words>150</words>
Those conversations were her laboratory, a place where intellectually spontaneous leaps met other people's small consistencies, and hypotheses were sketched on napkins. <words>172</words>
Sometimes she played ruthless, cutting floral displays to precise cruelty to reveal how the living language of stems and colour corresponded to chiselled grooves. <words>196</words>
A musician sat nearby, strumming and breathing, and in the pause between a singer's verses she traced a spiral that matched a whistle in the refrain. <words>222</words>
Her companions called her cruel and brilliant in the same breath; she answered with an offered comb and a question about which mark meant river. <words>247</words>
The scuffed plastic comb slid between petals and fingers as she demonstrated how tucked strands suggested flowing water while upright thorns hinted at wind. <words>271</words>
It was politely anarchic work: she rearranged meaning and left people smiling and unsettled, grateful for disorder they could still gossip about at tea. <words>295</words>
Once a dubious guide tried to claim a motif for fortune, but she distinguished intent from accident, pinning the story to a weather pattern and a grazing sheep. <words>323</words>
Night deepened; the stones held their cold counsel, and the arranger felt the watcher's burden sharpen into responsibility for whoever listened long enough to learn. <words>348</words>
She timed a bloom against a carving and waited in the pause between a singer's verses for a visiting skeptic to swallow surprise, then smiled as the pattern resolved. <words>377</words>
Roads had taught her that people reveal truths not under pressure but when idle, so her method of through spontaneous road trip conversations was deliberate mischief and research. <words>405</words>
By dawn she recorded indices in a small ledger, translating spirals into possible journeys and annotating each glyph with floral analogies and weather notes. <words>429</words>
At last she could distinguish meaning from myth, and in that unruly clarity the watcher's burden eased, briefly enough. <words>448</words>
