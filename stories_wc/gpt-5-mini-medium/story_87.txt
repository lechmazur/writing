In the hush of a memory reclaimed, a patient librarian arranged teacups beneath brass gears while the steampunk dining hall exhaled steam and old music. <words>25</words>
She was hyperactively serene, hands moving like a soft metronome even when her pulse seemed to throb against her collarbone. <words>45</words>
The wrinkled sticker sheet the staff had given her years earlier lay face down on the table, its cartoon engines a ridiculous offense in a place of rendered iron and polished knife edges. <words>78</words>
She had kept it like a relic because that sticker sheet carried names and annotations in childish ink that mapped the small betrayals that had scarred her youth. <words>106</words>
Through forgotten mixtapes she had learned the rhythms of the men who broke promises; cassette hiss and lyrical lies taught her when to smile and when to burrow the memory like a seed. <words>139</words>
Her motivation was precise and cold: to bury an old hatred under etiquette and warm pastries so that no one would smell the rot until it was too late. <words>168</words>
Guests dined amid cogs and gaslight, unaware that her calm was a crafted scaffold holding a savage grace that could snap with perfect timing. <words>192</words>
She staged the hollow victory by serving a course named for the past, a pie that tasted of caramelized memory and powdered recrimination. <words>215</words>
When a particular man, the architect of the slight that had begun the chain, accepted the slice with a laugh, her composed smile sharpened into an instrument. <words>242</words>
She let the mixtape spool under the dining table play a song he loved, and as the chorus swelled the brass chandeliers hummed like remembering lungs. <words>268</words>
A throb began behind her teeth, a small drum of triumph and shame that matched the timpani in the tape and made her fingers twitch. <words>293</words>
She tasted the hollow victory: applause in her chest but an ache like cotton stuffed into the mouth of a bell. <words>314</words>
Her plan was mathematical, a patient subtraction of trust until the balance owed became a confession slid into tea and sugar. <words>335</words>
Under the heat lamps she placed the wrinkled sticker sheet atop the bill, a childish accusation that the man laughed at until he read the names inked in her handwriting. <words>365</words>
His face went slack, then bright, then hard as he turned each name into a verdict, and in that small conversion her hatred was buried under facts spoken into the clinking china. <words>397</words>
She left the hall with a steady gait, her hyperactively serene mask intact though something inside unclenched and folded away like a map. <words>420</words>
In the hush of the memory reclaimed she felt the savage grace of justice and the odd emptiness that follows a wound stitched with civility. <words>445</words>
