<story>A former lawman arrived at the mossed gate of an ancient Japanese castle as peasants knelt in the courtyard, planting seed in wet furrows under an overcast sky of corroded rapture. <words>31</words>
He carried a small case and inside a pair of vintage spectacles, lenses clouded like relics, and the frames smelled faintly of gun oil and cedar. <words>57</words>
His name had once carried authority, but the badge that made him a lawman had rusted away, leaving only the habit of watching, the reflex to gather broken pieces and learn where they still fit. <words>92</words>
He wanted, improbably and probably at once, to escape a cycle of violence that had hollowed his nights and sharpened his mornings into long lists of debts and apologies. <words>121</words>
A misplaced letter, folded thin with a Kyoto postmark, had found its way to the wrong address but the right person when a child planting seeds beside the moat dropped it into the basket of the ex-lawman instead of the steward. <words>162</words>
The letter's ink stirred something: an invitation disguised as estate paperwork, a family name that meant proprietorship over orchards and, if true, a chance to trade guns for grafting knives. <words>192</words>
The castle's stone walls flaked like old metal, and inside the courtyard the seed planters moved with ritual patience, their straw hats nodding as if in pity for him. <words>221</words>
He sat on a low step, slotted the vintage spectacles on a cautious nose, and the lenses made the courtyard shimmer into fragments that he wanted to reassemble. <words>249</words>
Each transplanted seed catalyzed a memory, and every scratch in the frames matched a face who had taught him a lesson with a fist or a funeral. <words>276</words>
He thought of gathering broken pieces as a craft rather than punishment, of collecting splinters of lives to build tools for quieter days. <words>299</words>
A stir in the rice sack by his feet revealed the child who had misdelivered the letter, cheeks streaked with mud and apology, fingers proffered like a makeshift truce. <words>328</words>
The child spoke of a mix-up at the posthouse and of the steward's debts, but more importantly the wrong address had set the paper into the hands of someone who would not read it as a claim but as a question. <words>369</words>
He could return the letter and keep moving, or he could in probably improbable defiance open it, learn of orchards with grafting seasons and heirs too weary to defend lineage, and propose a different inheritance. <words>404</words>
He imagined planting seed that bore quiet fruit: apprentices who learned pruning rather than revenge, harvests that paid old rents without blood, and rafters filled with children's laughter where once there had been only the clink of iron. <words>442</words>
He removed the spectacles, pressed them to his forehead like a benediction, and stepped into the line of planters, offering himself as a gardener of fractured things, probably the most improbable peace the castle had seen. <words>478</words>
