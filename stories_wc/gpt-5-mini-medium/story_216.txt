After the last library card was returned to the desk, the cloud city exhaled and the professional scapegoat for hire stood at the window. <words>24</words>
He had a robustly delicate manner, an odd combination that let him be both impenetrable and immediately broken for clients who needed an absence to blame. <words>50</words>
His job was explicit and absurd, to refashion lives just enough so the guilty could vanish and the innocent could breathe, and he performed this by answering cryptic phone calls at midnight. <words>82</words>
Those midnight calls were ritual; a voice would whisper coordinates, fragments of glyph, a tone that matched a pulse, and in exchange he rebuilt an identity scaffold someone else would wear. <words>113</words>
He kept a single metal washer on a chain, a plain circular thing polished until it held the light of the cloud city like a tiny moon, and he turned it over and over between his fingers while decoding. <words>152</words>
That washer was his talisman and his tool; robust but fragile in his palm, a juddering balance that mirrored his own abandoned identity. <words>175</words>
He had once been someone else, a scholar with a library card and a name written in neat ink, but he returned the card and walked away and now only the echo of that signature remained. <words>211</words>
The city hung on pillars of vapor and brass, its streets a lattice of skybridges and catalogues, and the librarians had closed their desks; he marked the moment after the last return and moved. <words>245</words>
The sacred symbols he decoded were not merely ornaments but maps of responsibility, sequences that, when rearranged, allowed guilt to settle into new skins without damaging the architecture of the world. <words>276</words>
He pursued them with obsessive calm, cataloguing each sigil's subtleties in a ledger, matching curves to culpability like a surgeon reading bones. <words>298</words>
Sometimes callers asked him to refashion an alibi so subtly the city would not notice a seam; sometimes they wanted a face they could pin blame upon; and always he asked for the symbols before he agreed. <words>335</words>
His voice on the line was flat and small and patient, and at midnight he walked the cloud city rooftop paths, feeling like a ghost with purpose, threading the washer on invisible lines as if tuning the sky. <words>373</words>
The calls were sometimes cryptic to the point of cruelty: a throat clearing, a number sequence, a humming that suggested arithmetic of shame, and he learned to listen for unreachable patterns. <words>404</words>
At dawn he would place the refashioned sigils into envelopes and slip them into pneumatic tubes, watching them vanish like bad weather while he kept the washer warm between his ribs. <words>435</words>
Once, a caller asked him to stitch back the name he had lost, offering a purse of truth in exchange for his willingness to be blamed forever, but he refused because the work required him to remain unclaimed. <words>473</words>
He kept decoding the sacred symbols, content with being the city's secret and its quiet scapegoat. <words>489</words>
