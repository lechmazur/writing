I am a wreck-diver ghost whisperer who returns, joyfully melancholic, to an abandoned carnival shooting gallery that used to smell of citrus and gunpowder. <words>24</words>
Tonight I carry a piece of amber with an insect inside, warm as a pocket memory, and the object trembles like a small, secret compass. <words>49</words>
Between the lines of a half-written letter I fold into my breast pocket the scrap of paper with my family's instruction: keep the tradition of attending the fair, even if the fair has rotted away. <words>84</words>
That family tradition of attending a specific event together was once a method that stitched us into sunlight and tallow, and tonight it is my scaffolding to step out of the shadow where I used to live. <words>121</words>
My father, the marksmanship legend, cast a long silhouette that swallowed birthdays and bravado alike, and the carnival's lights had once bowed to him. <words>145</words>
Now I slip behind a rusted counter like a polite thief, a fleeting rebellion against the inheritance of silence. <words>164</words>
The targets hang still; their painted eyes seem to hold a congregation of small ghosts waiting to be spoken to. <words>184</words>
I arouse the mechanism with a borrowed coin and an old knack, and the first steel pellet sings through abandoned air like a question. <words>208</words>
The shot opens a seam in the night's skin, and from it comes the soft estuary of memory, my mother laughing at a prize booth decades ago. <words>235</words>
Between the clatter and the smell of rust I whisper to the dead mannequins and the carousel of syllables they left behind, because being a ghost whisperer taught me how to listen where others might only see rot. <words>273</words>
The piece of amber with an insect inside warms like a clandestine sun in my palm and seems to hold the thawing heart of the place, a slow heat that makes old grief liquefy. <words>307</words>
I press the amber to my chest between the lines of a half-written letter I've been avoiding, and the glass of memory refracts a different portrait of myself: small, defiant, and somehow luminous. <words>340</words>
I had been content as a shadow technician, fixing others' echoes on shipwrecks and murmuring to the dead, but tonight the tide of me wants a different shore. <words>368</words>
A childish laugh, mine or someone long gone, answers, and the deserted lights blink; I take that signal as permission. <words>390</words>
I aim at a paper clown and fire twice in quick succession, a small show of rebellion that tastes like citrus and cold copper. <words>414</words>
The second pellet hits the ring of a bell and the sound arouses a flock of memory-spirits that spill out into the midway and applaud me in invisible ways. <words>443</words>
Joyfully melancholic, I laugh at the absurdity of performing courage for ghosts and for a photograph of a younger me pinned to my father's bench. <words>468</words>
The thawing heart in the amber beats against my ribs, and I realize stepping out of the shadow means carrying him differently, not erasing him. <words>493</words>
I sign the letter and walk out. <words>500</words>
