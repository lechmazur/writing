After the last balloon deflates in an empty hall, the psychedelic art installation settles into a hush. <words>17</words>
An aloof dancer watches from the periphery, body folded like a question mark against projector light. <words>33</words>
She is harshly compassionate in small, precise gestures, offering stern comfort that startles even her own hands. <words>50</words>
Beside her on the stained floor sits a cracked compass whose needle trembles between nowhere and memory. <words>67</words>
He or she - she, mostly - collects envelopes labeled letters home, each thin packet of paper heavy with pauses. <words>87</words>
After the revelers left and the lights winked out, the hall kept a residue of forgotten revelry like static in the ears. <words>109</words>
She wants to ease the ache that corrodes those envelopes, to free unspoken truths and set lonely names afloat. <words>128</words>
Her motion is deliberate, easing knots in the air as if loosing threads from an invisible sweater. <words>145</words>
The cracked compass clicks like a bad memory when she taps it and the needle drifts toward neighborhoods she has abandoned. <words>166</words>
She maps paths on the floor with chalk and tiny lights, by mapping scattered dreams as if cartography could translate longing. <words>187</words>
Each line connects a return address to a memory room in the installation, the maze smelling faintly of spilled paint and orange soda. <words>210</words>
The letters home are not all nostalgia; some are accusations, some are recipes, some are apologies that never found a voice. <words>231</words>
She reads aloud in a hollow, theatrical whisper, the syllables soft enough to comfort but harsh enough to wound. <words>250</words>
The cracked compass points not north but toward the names she would otherwise never say, and it spins like a restless conscience. <words>272</words>
She is aloof by training and temperament, yet harshly compassionate when met with human fragility, a seamstress of small mercies. <words>292</words>
She folds each letter into origami memories, easing their edges before releasing them to the mapped lights. <words>309</words>
By mapping scattered dreams, she traces the routes shame took, the alleys regret walked, the boulevards of longing unsent. <words>328</words>
The installation's projections ripple with faces that never stayed long in town and with handwriting that looks like weather patterns. <words>348</words>
Her task is simple in its cruelty: to ease the sting of unsaid things by setting them in public, brittle and tender. <words>370</words>
A visitor - perhaps a former lover, perhaps a stranger - stumbles in, noses the air, and recognizes a handwriting and a hurt. <words>393</words>
They stand with the aloof dancer and listen as she reads a letter that says simply, I forgive you, which frees something like sunlight. <words>417</words>
The cracked compass cools in her palm, its needle finally resting on a forgotten address where a door opens to someone waiting. <words>439</words>
She closes the installation at dawn, pockets the remaining letters home, and walks out with the compass, carrying a map of reconciliations in her chest. <words>464</words>
