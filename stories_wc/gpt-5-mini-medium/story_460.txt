<story>
An unassuming monarch walked through an acid rain forest after the collapse of civilization, his robe patched and humble against the neon rot. <words>23</words>
He moved with a lethargically energetic gait, as if his limbs remembered both long lullabies and sudden scrambles. <words>41</words>
In his rough, calloused hands he carried a box of mismatched puzzle pieces, its lid tied with scavenged thread. <words>60</words>
This box was not merely a container but a curriculum of lost maps, corners and edges that promised the ember of choice to anyone patient enough to sort them. <words>89</words>
He craved to cradle wisdom in rough, calloused hands, to press knowledge into palms that had tended saplings and wiped soot from a thousand fires. <words>114</words>
He perceived the world primarily by small things and by action, and when he needed direction he would perceive via the texture of a feather pressed to his fingertip, letting the barbs narrate wind and rain and far-off metal. <words>153</words>
The acid rain forest hissed in prismatic sheets, trees like blown glass dripping corrosive jewels, and every leaf rang with brittle histories. <words>175</words>
As an unassuming monarch he wore no crown, only the responsibility of tending fragments: legal parchments with fern mold, a child's chipped toy, a list of names in a weathered hairbrush. <words>206</words>
People sought decisions from him like rain from the clouds, and he answered with a prickly wonder, sharp questions folded in gentle pauses, because every choice felt like coaxing an ember from wet tinder. <words>240</words>
Sometimes he opened the box of mismatched puzzle pieces and let his thumb follow a seam until he could perceive a path to mend someone's grief; sometimes the pieces fit, sometimes they did not, and the uncertainty was a companion. <words>280</words>
He moved among sap-stained ruins collecting the mismatched fragments because to cradle wisdom in rough, calloused hands was both penance and prayer. <words>302</words>
At night he would sit beneath a skeletal canopy and, with the feather he kept like a compass, perceive currents of gossip and hope that rustled through the canopy and translated them into small laws and gestures. <words>339</words>
The ember of choice burned small in his palm, sometimes guttering, sometimes flaring with decisions that tasted of citrus and ash, and he learned to shelter it with both tenderness and thorns. <words>371</words>
Once a child asked if kings ever felt alone, and he handed the child a single mismatched puzzle piece and a feather, telling her to perceive the world by touch and to choose where the piece could belong. <words>409</words>
She fitted it clumsily into a sky of ruin and laughed, and he felt less like a monarch and more like a gardener tending a tiny, stubborn flame. <words>437</words>
In an acid rain forest after the collapse, his lethargically energetic presence, the box, the feather, and that ember of choice became a map by which a brittle people learned to hold one another with prickly wonder. <words>474</words>
