<story>
A poison taster with a death wish sat beneath the subterranean waterfall, finger resting on a simple cloth bookmark as if it were a talisman. <words>25</words>
He listened to the strangely compelling hiss of water and to the frantic voices on his battered radio, voices he met by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics for clues. <words>55</words>
Every transmission was a lattice of rumor and grief that the hidden societies used like signal fires, and he parsed them to bind delicate patterns of rumor and counterfeits until the map of currents emerged. <words>90</words>
He carried out his job to map energy flows with the same clinical tenderness that had once made him a remembered poison taster, because even a death wish needs a cause. <words>121</words>
The subterranean waterfall blurred the center of his map like a smudge, the air cool and mineral, and his hands traced currents on wet stone while lantern light turned the page of his pocketbook into a private aurora. <words>159</words>
He kept the simple cloth bookmark folded into a seam near his ribs so that every breath nudged memory, an anchor more faithful than the societies' promises. <words>186</words>
Below, the underground river beat an organ that made his ribs vibrate; above that organ an ice sculpture trembled in the cavern's light, and he knew the timeframe perfectly, in the final second before an ice sculpture collapses. <words>224</words>
It was this, the infinitesimal hinge, he had chosen as his laboratory, because when things end the flows rearrange and expose patterns that polite daylight never reveals. <words>251</words>
A strangely compelling silence collected in the pool at the waterfall's base, like a held breath waiting for permission to fracture, and he felt it answer him with a cold certainty. <words>282</words>
He used his radio as a receiver and translator, binding scraps of emotion and superstition into nodes, and his fingers moved with a calm he called serene upheaval. <words>310</words>
Between frantic callers, a voice claiming descent from an obscure conclave offered coordinates like poetry, a cipher that fit the creases he had been folding in his mind. <words>338</words>
He replied with a list of toxins he would accept and small riddles about currents, and the callers obligingly told him where grief pooled and where rumor ran like a current along a fracture. <words>372</words>
He bound those directions into his map with the bookmark as a pointer, and each binding stitch was a ritual of consent to end and to knowledge both. <words>400</words>
