A town-weary traveler found the abandoned carnival house of mirrors at dusk, drawn as if his feet were answering a summons he had forgotten. <words>24</words>
The place smelled of sea salt and old laughter and every mirror held a different, quieter version of him, each reflection a possibility he could no longer afford to ignore. <words>54</words>
He carried a stained glass panel under one arm, its colors dulled but whole, a talisman he had rescued from a seaside chapel on a trip that had once promised less running and more staying. <words>89</words>
He stood in the hush before someone finally says, "I love you," and listened, because that hush felt like an instruction to open the heart of whatever remained inside him. <words>119</words>
He wanted to escape the confines of his mind, a motivation that had hollowed his pockets and hardened the soles of his shoes into maps of exits. <words>146</words>
There was a cradle of sparks in him, a fragile engine that needed both wreck and care, and he had learned to feed it with intentionally accidental rituals. <words>174</words>
He intended the accidents like prayers, small improvisations that fertilize hope when soil is scarce; tonight he hoped the stained glass could work as seedbed. <words>199</words>
The house of mirrors answered with its chipped laughter, and somewhere above the atrium a metal sign swung on a chain, tapping in the coastal wind like a slow metronome. <words>229</words>
He listened to that tapping because he had decided to accept method as miracle, to let the rhythm catalyze small combustions. <words>250</words>
Each tap was a grain; each pause a dark tide that left salt on the tongue of memory, and he pinned the stained glass by the frame of a broken mirror so light and noise could mingle. <words>287</words>
In the hammered repose of that hour his hands moved intentionally accidental, both careful and reckless, as if to coax the panel to shed images like petals. <words>314</words>
When the sign tapped a certain cadence the cracked mirrors broke the light into sparks that settled onto the glass, a cradle of sparks reborn in blue and rust. <words>343</words>
He watched those tiny fires as if they were a map out, as if their small glow could fertilize the damp corners of his mind so he might find a new border to cross. <words>377</words>
The carriage of silence held a tension like the drawn string of a spring, the hush before someone finally says, "I love you," a punctuation he had heard once and never been able to speak. <words>412</words>
He imagined that if he could outwardly leave the carnival of mirrors enough pieces of himself, the rest would follow more gently, and so he let the metal sign's tapping sow patience into his chest. <words>447</words>
