<story>
The confident watchman reclined on a low comb shelf inside the giant beehive interior, smiling as light pooled like honey around his knees. <words>23</words>
He carried a cracked plastic ruler and a battered microscope, instruments for measuring both cell geometry and small, human traces. <words>43</words>
Throughout coloring sessions he supervised the procession of pigments and pollen, a ritual that stitched the combs into murals of work and want. <words>66</words>
He was confidently sure of his duty but he wore humility like a second veil, a forcibly gentle magistrate of the honeyed art. <words>89</words>
His motive was practical and strange: to hush the voice of envy that buzzed like a small, sharp beetle in the backs of many thoraxes. <words>114</words>
That voice made colors hoard themselves and gossip within cells, turning generous swathes into guarded specks, and the watchman would not permit such narrowing. <words>138</words>
Instead he learned to mobilize the small, stubborn artists—worker bees with paint-thick legs—by aligning their tasks with rhythms that pulled them outward rather than inward. <words>163</words>
Sometimes he coaxed cooperation forcibly but gently, tapping the cracked plastic ruler twice like a conductor's baton while whispering remonstrances that sounded like lullabies. <words>187</words>
He felt the echo of yearning in every stroke of brush and comb, a resonant aftersound that made his chest both light and heavy. <words>211</words>
To translate longing into action he examined tiny human artifacts, and often, under the microscope, he traced a single fingerprint to discover how small jealousies began. <words>237</words>
He read through the patterns in a fingerprint under a microscope like a map of want, each whorl and delta a history of fingers that pointed and withheld. <words>265</words>
From those lines he learned where envy first crept, what shade it preferred, and which combs would mutate grief into small hoards. <words>287</words>
Armed with that knowledge he would mobilize color and chorus, sending a flurry of ochres and laughter into pockets that had started to pinch inward. <words>312</words>
His interventions were correction and celebration both; he clapped with stained palms and apologetically beamed at bees who felt exposed. <words>332</words>
There was a jubilant remorse in his manner like sunlight through combs: joy at colors returned, regret for the sting of needing to steer desire. <words>357</words>
Once a jealous quarrel flared over a brilliant stripe and he knelt, microscope balanced on his knees, to show the combatants how their fingerprints mirrored one another rather than opposed designs. <words>388</words>
They leaned close, laughing at the intimacy of ridges, and the echo of yearning softened into a chorus that longed for the same sun. <words>412</words>
When a child visitor left a smear, the watchman measured it with his cracked plastic ruler, marking how tiny desires repeated across generations. <words>435</words>
He had mobilized their hands and hearts so often that the combs occasionally hummed in contentment, a low certainty that stilled petty ache. <words>458</words>
At daybreak he would sit back, fingers inked, microscope sleeping beside him, and he would let a small, rueful laugh out as the hive brightened, knowing he had been both shepherd and meddler. <words>491</words>
