The alien liaison disguised as a teacher kept a low profile in the city of steam and mosaic, where an ancient roman bathhouse reborn housed rehearsals and secrets. <words>28</words>
He wore glasses that softened his otherworldly gaze and smiled with fierce tenderness when students asked questions he already knew the answers to. <words>51</words>
The motive that guided him, simple and urgent, was to rescue lost knowledge buried under neglect and flame in archives no living scholar remembered. <words>75</words>
Every evening throughout concerts the bathhouse filled with music as performers tuned brass and voice in steam rooms shaped like galleries of time. <words>98</words>
He would compare the pulse of a violin to the rhythm of the giant aqueduct pipes and explain how memory itself could become a vessel. <words>123</words>
In a locked corner of the caldarium he kept a single puzzle tile, its glaze chipped and inscribed with a script that smelled of salt and older suns. <words>151</words>
To the students the tile was a curiosity; to him it was a map fragment that might, if reunited, reopen pathways of teaching the galaxy had lost. <words>178</words>
He was righteously flawed, certain that bending rules for a greater remembering justified small deceits, yet haunted by the harm those choices could do. <words>202</words>
Fear had taught him caution; breaking free from fear taught him to risk exposure when the tremor in a hymn might point the way. <words>226</words>
He learned to listen through the reverberation of a lonely church organ that was mounted improbably above the frigidarium, an instrument whose low notes opened corridors in stone and mind. <words>256</words>
Throughout concerts his pupils would close their eyes and the organ would send shivers along the mosaic, revealing inscriptions in the steam that only he and the tile could translate. <words>286</words>
He compared the way fear tightened their throats to the way the organ tightened the air before a great chord, then taught them to breathe into the unplayed spaces. <words>315</words>
One night, during an overfull program, a low register unlocked a seam beneath the apodyterium and the tile vibrated, sliding to reveal a hollow with letters like ocean bone. <words>344</words>
He felt righteous outrage and gentle grief in equal measure, a contradiction that made him human and alien at once, and he acted with fierce tenderness. <words>370</words>
He compared the hollow inscriptions to the scattering of steam poems and realized they encoded methods of pedagogy and star charts both, a salvage of civilization's lost curriculum. <words>398</words>
He smiled, righteous and flawed, and promised to piece the puzzle, teaching his students the courage to bear knowledge and to share it without hiding the scars. <words>425</words>
