<story>
The unlucky meteorologist carried a mariner's sextant into the subterranean market because cosmic storms had become personal weather and curiosity drove him. <words>22</words>
He was drawn to cosmic events the way moths orient to ruined light, systematically chaotic in planning but faithful to pattern. <words>43</words>
Bitter honey coated his voice when he spoke truths aloud to anyone who would listen, a ritual meant to settle doubt and invite correction. <words>67</words>
He had come underground to study plant behaviors among fungus chimneys and bioluminescent vines, motivated by data no surface grant would touch. <words>89</words>
The shortcut he took - a tunneled aqueduct leading beneath the old tram lines - was supposed to save him a day, but instead produced an unexpected encounter. <words>117</words>
From the dark came a chorus of scales and a rattle like argument, and the lantern light showed the citizens of the underground city of the lizard people pausing in their barter. <words>149</words>
They were scaled diplomats between colliding interests - miners lobbying for fungal rights and growers defending root territory - and their timing put the meteorologist in a narrow interval between colliding interests, a bracket of tension he could neither ignore nor exploit without consequence. <words>193</words>
He had expected to spar verbally with a trade delegate about watering cycles and phototropism, not to be stared at by emerald eyes that cataloged his coat. <words>220</words>
A juvenile with a broken crest blinked and spoke the first of those spoken truths as if it were a knife: "You study daylight from the wrong horizon." <words>248</words>
His bitter honey tone hardened when he answered, because his luck with storms had taught him to accept accusation as data, and he recited a ledger of failed forecasts that smelled of ozone and ash. <words>283</words>
They listened, tails flicking, and the city around them, systematically chaotic with stacked workshops and ordered caverns, rearranged its noise like a mind turning pages. <words>308</words>
Between colliding interests and his own tangled motives, the meteorologist wanted a narrower truth: how subterranean flora tracked passing charged particles and moon pulses, how vines negotiated light with tentacular precision. <words>339</words>
A lizard elder stepped forward and offered the sextant back, its brass dull but calibrated by tides they still remembered, and murmured a spoken truth about balance between sky and root. <words>370</words>
He took it like a confession and measured the glow of a fungus bloom as if aligning stars, the instrument absurd and intimate in hands meant for weather maps. <words>399</words>
The elder's scale hands trembled, systematic yet chaotic, proof that their politics were not unlike storms. <words>415</words>
In that interval between colliding interests he learned that plants here turned toward gossip as much as light, and his research shifted from numbers to listening. <words>441</words>
When the barter resumed, he sparred briefly with a rootkeeper about nutrient schedules, and the exchange tasted like apology and barter combined. <words>463</words>
He left with the sextant strapped to his pack and an offer to map living geotropism, the compromise of an unlucky man who learned to treat accusations as data and compliments as risk. <words>496</words>
