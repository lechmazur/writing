<story>
After the last mountain erodes, the reserved caretaker tends a quantum entanglement garden where vines remember the names of things that no longer stand. <words>24</words>
He keeps a forgotten music box beneath a stone bench, its lid scuffed and its song full of small instructions about how to place offerings and fold paper prayers. <words>53</words>
Though he is honestly dishonest in his speech, telling blunt fictions to ward off unwanted confidences, his hands are precise and reverent when they write. <words>78</words>
He believes that writing the future is less prophecy than a set of careful instructions, a ledger of possible ritual behavior inked in trembling silver that can coax a later world toward familiar meaning. <words>112</words>
The garden itself is a laboratory of entanglements, beds braided across probabilities, and he studies leaves like scripts, annotating the soil with charcoal and memory. <words>137</words>
At dusk the bats rise in a single, agitating plume, and their flight of bats at dusk stirs the air with wingbeats that sound like the turning of pages. <words>166</words>
He has learned to agitate the ritual stones by timing offerings to that movement, because small disturbances cascade differently in entangled soil than in simple dirt. <words>192</words>
Sometimes the music box plays on its own, a hesitant melody that seems to answer future notations, and he writes those answers into a ledger kept under the bench. <words>221</words>
He is careful to appear uninterested when children ask about prophecy, the honestly dishonest way of deflecting hope, yet at night he composes long lists of rites and recipes to preserve spiritual practices for whoever comes after him. <words>259</words>
The ledger is not merely prediction but instruction: how to braid light into a prayer, how to fold memory like cloth, how to set a bowl so that entangled dew will carry messages between lovers separated by probability. <words>297</words>
He writes with excited restraint, each stroke betraying both hunger and discipline, because the future must be coaxed without collapsing into a demand that breaks delicate traditions. <words>324</words>
Once, when a storm of dust erased a row of glyphs, he let the music box play until the bats answered, trusting the agitation to rearrange probabilities and reveal salvageable rites. <words>355</words>
The flight translated to a flutter in the vines and a sequence of echoed chimes that matched a notation he had written months before, which convinced him that writing the future was indeed a practice of preservation. <words>392</words>
He is a reserved caretaker in manner yet a conspirator in method, honestly dishonest when naming the truth to outsiders but absolute in his fidelity to the rites he archives. <words>422</words>
The music box, forgotten perhaps by its maker, becomes for him a clarion of continuity, and he winds it before ceremonies so that its mechanical memory will tug at probability like a stringed prayer. <words>456</words>
After the last mountain erodes, the world narrows to these small practices, and he guards them with an honesty that admits artifice because sometimes preservation must be honestly dishonest to survive. <words>487</words>
When bats take wing he smiles, writing the future with hopeful restraint. <words>499</words>
