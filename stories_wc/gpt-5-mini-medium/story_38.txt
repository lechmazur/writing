<story>
An insomniac poet sat curled among crates in a haunted attic between subway stops, listening to warnings in whispers and cataloguing botanical samples by moonlight. <words>25</words>
His notebook was meticulously messy, pages scrawled with lists of tinctures and metaphors that suggested an empty abundance of memory and longing for quiet remedy. <words>50</words>
He believed he could eliminate the urge to harm by collecting confessions spilled in the coffee-sour dawn of after-parties, each drunken confession a tincture of truth. <words>76</words>
Between subway stops the world shushed and the attic hummed, its rafters storing the static after a thousand near-misses and whispered warnings. <words>98</words>
He kept botanical samples in jam jars, labeled in a hand both meticulous and messy, each leaf an argument for gentleness folded into scientific superstition. <words>123</words>
Warnings in whispers came from the jars sometimes, breathless spores and the attic's old piping forming syllables that said stop and soften. <words>145</words>
At after-parties he hovered near folding tables and cigarette ash, leaning cheap ears to drunken confessions at after-parties with the patience of a taxonomist. <words>169</words>
Each admission was transcribed into verse and vinegar, distilled with silence until its sharp edges were dulled enough to be set beside a pressed fern. <words>194</words>
He wanted, desperately and patiently, to discover the power of non-violence not as an abstract ethic but as a practice that could be learned in the mouth. <words>221</words>
The attic offered an empty abundance of objects and silence, rooms overflowing with useless trinkets and secrets that left him full and starving. <words>244</words>
His methods were meticulously messy: stacks of napkins stained with names, verbatim lines of apologies, jars labeled in trembling ink, and folded sprigs acting as amulets. <words>270</words>
He sought to eliminate revenge by converting its language into recipes for care, reading confessions aloud to the plants until the plants seemed to forgive. <words>295</words>
Between subway stops he felt time slacken into a thin throat where a confession could pass whole and be swallowed by moss and needle and paper. <words>321</words>
After-parties produced the raw syntax of guilt, slurred lists of old injuries, and he turned those lists into rituals of restoration with a drunkard's dignity. <words>346</words>
He was an insomniac poet whose nights of wakefulness were moral laboratories, trials to prove that soft responses could outlast knives and curses. <words>369</words>
The attic, full of complaint and compassion, murmured warnings in whispers that nudged him toward mercy rather than catalogued vengeance. <words>389</words>
One night he hosted a small after-party in the attic between subway stops, offering tea and jars and asking guests to speak drunken confessions into the wood, then to plant a sprig. <words>421</words>
They spoke, wept, and planted, and the attic swelled with an empty abundance of forgiven syllables, proving in small, sticky increments that non-violence could eliminate the need for retribution. <words>450</words>
