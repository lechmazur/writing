<story>I am a mildly panicked soothsayer who prefers molten sarcasm to polite prophecy, and I say that first because honesty is a small courtesy in a maze of billboards in a neon-lit desert between lost years. <words>36</words>
I clutch a pocket puzzle box with 13 locks like a nervous saint clutching rosary beads and like any good entertainer of fates I insist the locks are probably unlikely to open without ritual patience or capitalism. <words>73</words>
The maze of billboards hums advertisements for extinct rain and canned sky and yet I sit on a battered wooden bar top with coffee rings and salt-stain water rings that I read to magnify faint currents of consequence. <words>111</words>
By reading the water rings on a battered wooden bar top, I map the slow habits of groundwater, and if you are wondering whether divination can be environmental stewardship, the answer here tastes like bitter irrigation. <words>147</words>
I try to magnify the impact of tiny choices—turn off a pipeline, plant a root, shame a politician—because stewardship is concrete work and because I am motivated to shape destiny with bare hands despite my sweaty palms. <words>184</words>
Between lost years, everything smells of ozone and reboot; if you call this an interregnum I will accept the term while rolling my eyes like molten slag, which is my polite face for panic. <words>218</words>
The pocket puzzle box with 13 locks sits warm in my palm as if it had been pressed against a beating city heart and I keep fiddling because destiny prefers theatrics and cold metal to willing hands. <words>255</words>
I am mildly panicked, not nihilistic; I believe that reading concentric stains can tell us where water will go, and if that sounds probably unlikely you should see my expression when the rings align with an abandoned pipeline map. <words>294</words>
My motivation to shape destiny with bare hands is literal and metaphorical; I will dig with hands, with laws, with whispered threats to billboards, because the desert remembers what we pretend not to have stolen. <words>329</words>
The maze of billboards is a cathedral of contradictions, neon saints advertising fossil absolution while the dunes outside host cactus cemeteries and the occasional sign that blinks like an apology for something unnamed. <words>362</words>
I turn the locks of the pocket puzzle box with 13 locks in a theater of motion, fingers moving as if shaping destiny with bare hands could be learned like a dance, and each clack is a mock prayer. <words>401</words>
Sometimes I narrate the future like a standup set and the audience is a circle of rusted rods and blinking billboards that don't laugh but they do blink, which is close enough to applause. <words>435</words>
I massage the box between thumb and forefinger until a final lock gives under a sigh, and the pocket puzzle box with 13 locks opens onto a folded map of wet places, and I weep in a molten sarcastic way. <words>475</words>
We magnify small actions into new rivers, planting between lost years because stewardship is what stubborn hands actually do, not theatrical pronouncements but also eventually. <words>500</words></story>
