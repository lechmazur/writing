<story>
After the last empire crumbles, a bored shapeshifter named Iren waits in the echoing entrance to the harmonic caves, feeling the slow itch of possibility and the oddly patient hunger of someone who knows rare talents will be needed soon. <words>40</words>
He is intelligently foolish, an amalgam of precise missteps and gleeful theories that make him more dangerous than a parade of disciplined assassins because his errors hide experiments that teach him how to bend systems. <words>75</words>
The chipped figurine on his palm, a cracked little relic from a collapsed monastery, hums faintly and feels like a secret map when held against the cave mouth, and he nurses it like a conspiracy. <words>110</words>
He remembers the taxi ride that brought him here: a shared cab with a poet, a disgraced noble, and a child who spoke equations as lullabies while thunder erased the world outside and the driver hummed an old lullaby in a language of stones. <words>154</words>
They had argued about overthrow and revolution with the same bemused cadence one uses to name constellations, and between them Iren sowed a plan that read like both a tantrum and a theorem. <words>187</words>
He is not a rebel for glory but to shift the cosmic balance of power, to nudge the lattice that keeps moons obedient, and he thinks of balance as a delicate instrument that prefers eccentric tuning. <words>223</words>
The harmonic caves themselves sing in low, mapped tones when the rain threads through fissures and their acoustics teach him new shapes to wear and new ethics to try, which is why caves are both classroom and cathedral to someone like him. <words>265</words>
On the taxi he learned that rare talents are not simply gifts but currencies, and when squandered politely they become the exact leverage a bored intelligence can exploit to tilt history into a tantrum of order reversed. <words>302</words>
The chipped figurine, once dismissed by other passengers as a humble toy, proved fractal when touched by Iren and sang a partial ledger of rubble and weather and the old empire's last bureaucrats in a voice like a penny dropped into a well. <words>345</words>
Iren's plan was intelligently foolish in every necessary way: he would use the shared ride's witnesses as an alibi while the figurine's micro-resonance rewired the caves' harmonics, creating a corridor that amplified the rare talents of any soul who passed through it. <words>387</words>
The poet laughed and called it heresy and then recited a formula that smelled like tea and lightning, and the noble promised silent gold while the child folded a paper bird that mapped the frequencies with precise naive cruelty. <words>426</words>
In the measured wildness of that plan, as the taxi threaded flooded canyons and the caves pulsed with the rain's scale, Iren shifted into a gull, then an old woman, then a slab of stone, and each guise tuned an argument in the world's ear. <words>471</words>
The corridor opened; the child's paper bird sailed through, the figurine unlocked a chorus, and a tidal correction of power began without fanfare but with exact, ridiculous intent. <words>499</words>
