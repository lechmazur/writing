A dismayed minstrel sat at the edge of the black velvet sky-lounge, watching the endless city breathe like a low, patient animal. <words>22</words>
He wore a broken watch band around his wrist like a confession and measured time by memory rather than any clock. <words>43</words>
He was subjectively rational, insisting that his peculiar logic was the only map that made sense amid the garden secrets the lounge sheltered. <words>66</words>
His motive was simple and oddly solemn: to draw a map of an endless night so sailors of the dark might find themselves. <words>89</words>
He spoke rarely, in clipped phrases that carried laconic exuberance, as if joy could be economized into precise syllables. <words>108</words>
To excavate the night he dug not in soil but into memory, poring over old polaroid photographs until faces and corners surfaced like bones. <words>132</words>
Each polaroid was a compass; each crease a boundary; he drew drawn boundaries around moods and intersections, careful not to erase any ache. <words>155</words>
He excavated further, lifting corners of images with knuckles that trembled and cataloguing light and shadow like artifacts. <words>173</words>
The lounge's garden secrets were literal and whispered: potted night-blooming vines trailed toward neon and a hidden fountain hummed with city memory. <words>195</words>
He cataloged the fountain's reflection in a cracked polaroid and mapped its shimmer as if it were a harbor light signaling safe passage. <words>218</words>
People came and went in the black velvet sky-lounge, lovers whispering, brokers arguing, a child sketching constellations on a napkin, but he remained apart. <words>242</words>
He was dismayed, not by the city's immensity, but by its refusal to be tamed into a single tidy atlas of feeling. <words>264</words>
Subjectively rational arguments guided him: the night was patterned; if he could trace edges precisely the endless would relent into comprehensible lanes. <words>286</words>
He attached notes to polaroid corners: a line for rumor, a dot for laughter, a thin smudge where secrets pooled, and he stitched them together with a trembling thread. <words>315</words>
The broken watch band gnawed at his wrist like a promise undone, reminding him that boundaries even drawn by hand could fray. <words>337</words>
Once he had been exuberant in louder ways, but now his gusto was contained into spare notations and a quiet triumph whenever two hours matched in different polaroids. <words>365</words>
At dawnless intervals he would excavate deeper, because the endless night refused maps unless coaxed by patience and ritual. <words>384</words>
Once he folded the last polaroid into place and traced a final drawn boundary between two laughing strangers, he felt the room tilt into a new, smaller cosmos. <words>412</words>
He smiled, laconic and exuberant, as if the map would not only guide others but forgive him for losing the hours his broken watch band had stolen. <words>439</words>
Then he pinned the map to a pillar of ivy amid the garden secrets, a quiet monument afloat above the endless city, offering routes to anyone willing to read shadows. <words>469</words>
