In the time-worn marketplace inside a giant hourglass, a hopeful pickpocket named Lio balanced doubt and hunger with a blithe discontent that made him hum tunelessly. <words>26</words>
He kept a broken pencil sharpener in his pocket like a talisman, its metal teeth dulled and its plastic shell lovingly cracked. <words>48</words>
The sharpener had been stolen from a child's cart when chalk lines on the sidewalk faded away and no one was watching, and Lio prized it because it once sang tiny impossible promises rather than grinding graphite. <words>85</words>
He lived for the depths of devotion he imagined among the market stalls, where whetstone merchants and hourglass repairers traded whispers and coffee grounds. <words>109</words>
On the day something would materialize to prove his faith was more than a transient habit, he had planned a small, tastefully offensive spectacle. <words>133</words>
Not crude or cruel, Lio thought, but carefully rude in a way that winked at propriety while exposing the rot beneath it. <words>155</words>
His motivation was desperate and religious in its smallness: to share a secret that sears the soul, one he'd carried since he first learned to lift coin purses with a grin. <words>186</words>
The secret was not wealth or escape but a name: an old woman who fixed hourglasses and loved poets, who once taught him the exact syllables that could open a locked throat. <words>218</words>
He intended to confess that devotion in public, to risk his nimble fingers and reputation in a spontaneous karaoke duet with a vendor whose accordion smelled of caramelized time. <words>247</words>
When the chords started, the hourglass walls feathered with sand and the market's lanterns hummed, and his plan felt like both miracle and misdemeanor. <words>271</words>
The vendor, a woman with hands like flattened maps, agreed to duet because she was bored of normal prayers and curious about Lio's audacity. <words>295</words>
Their voices collided in a tastefully offensive mash of hymn and sea shanty, deliberate mockery softened into something oddly tender. <words>315</words>
As they sang, coins fell into Lio's cupped hand like confessionals, and the old woman materialized at the stall's edge with a bag of ground coffee and a face like weather. <words>346</words>
She listened with a smile that smelled of soot and lemon, and Lio felt the secret's heat lift into the open air like steam. <words>370</words>
In a moment of blithe discontent made brave, he stepped forward and shared the name, the syllables cutting through the market's chatter and searing his own ribs with relief. <words>399</words>
She answered with a soft curse and a hug, confirming that the depths of devotion are also domestic and absurd. <words>419</words>
