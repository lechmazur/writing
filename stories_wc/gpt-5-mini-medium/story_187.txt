<story>At the moment a teacher wipes the final formula away, a stoic wanderer stands at the edge of the witch's familiar training ground, a single floorboard from an abandoned cabin strapped to his chest like a relic. <words>37</words>
He moves with mesmerizingly bland composure, as if to impose calm over the apprentices while carrying the secret of necessary lies that he keeps to archive ritual practices, having arrived by following a trail of nightmares traced in smoke. <words>76</words>
The teacher, a woman with soot-streaked hands, wipes the last chalked sigil from the slate and the room inhales; the wandering man counts heartbeats rather than breaths, his face parked between brashness and tenderness. <words>110</words>
He had pried that floorboard from an abandoned cabin because inside its grain the elders once hid faded rubrics, and he believes that necessary lies wrapped in old wood are sometimes the only way to preserve a true ritual's arc. <words>150</words>
Around him, the familiar training ground smells of iron and animal sleep, and wooden dummies curl like question marks as apprentices practice waking familiars by following a trail of nightmares that the older witches dare not speak aloud. <words>188</words>
He will impose order by telling understated stories of ritual failure and triumph, necessary lies that double as mnemonic scaffolds, each anecdote meticulously recorded in the hollow of that floorboard for the archive he imagines. <words>223</words>
At the exact scrape of her palm the final formula gone, a hush falls and the apprentices look for permission to touch the old ways, and he realizes archiving will require a sweeter kind of deception, blunt but kind. <words>262</words>
His stoicism fractures into small mercies: he speaks with a brash tenderness, recounting nightmares as if they were jokes, and the apprentices lean in because the tales deliver both warning and a map. <words>295</words>
Inside the board are splinters of torn prayers, a cramped ledger of gestures, and a single carved sigil that will mislead a curious witch while guiding a true familiar if read after midnight; the necessary lie protects the real line. <words>335</words>
He had followed that trail of nightmares out of a village where a child's dream learned to bite, through fogged fen and over rusted teeth of plows, each bad sleep revised into shorthand for the rituals he meant to archive. <words>375</words>
When the teacher steps back the chalk dust settles and he sets the floorboard on the training earth, imposes a gentle command that sounds like a warning, and the apprentices file the truths and untruths into their palms. <words>413</words>
They tuck the board beneath a young apprentice's cot to be read aloud later, trusting the blur between lie and lesson, and the wanderer walks away with the bland look of a man who has saved something he cannot otherwise confess. <words>454</words>
His footsteps impose distance, but his shoulders fold into one last small mercy, a brash tenderness that archives ritual practice not in parchment but in the living belief of the familiars they will raise. <words>488</words>
