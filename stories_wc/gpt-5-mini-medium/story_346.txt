A boastful warrior paced the hanging corridors of the giant wasp's nest interior with an odd swagger. <words>17</words>
His armor clicked like a metronome tuned to mania amid balloon pops that echoed in hollow mandibles. <words>34</words>
He boasted aloud about victories that might be real, might be rehearsed, and sometimes were both. <words>50</words>
Yet the bravado had an intimately impersonal cadence, as if rehearsed for an audience that was never there. <words>68</words>
He kept a lint-filled pocket over his heart like a talisman, pulling out threads between breaths. <words>84</words>
The lint smelled of old speeches and orange light, a residue of invented moments he wore to be convincing. <words>103</words>
He came here with a single unbearable motive: to escape a fabricated reality that had been stitched around him. <words>122</words>
The nest's walls pulsed with wax and memory, and wasps hummed with the distant grammar of complaint. <words>139</words>
Amid balloon pops the noise punctured his monologues and revealed tiny, absurd gaps where truth might leak. <words>156</words>
He listened because the plan required it: to rewire perception by overhearing unguarded soliloquies scattered like larvae in the shell. <words>176</words>
Each soliloquy was an accidental incision into the script someone else had written for him. <words>191</words>
He hoarded those lines, grafting phrases onto his armor until his boasts tasted like borrowed thunder. <words>207</words>
Sometimes he caught his own voice in the lint-filled pocket and could not tell whether the proof belonged to him. <words>227</words>
A precise madness edged his hearing; he catalogued cadence, vowel slippage, the undercurrent of clarity that betrayed honesty. <words>245</words>
The clarity was not loud; it was an intimately impersonal point of light that made the nest's architecture confess. <words>264</words>
He learned patterns by overhearing unguarded soliloquies and then rehearsed them in the throat of the nest. <words>281</words>
Sometimes a wasp drifted too close, its compound eyes unreadable and curiously intimate, watching his lint tremble. <words>298</words>
He felt both exposed and protected by that gaze, an intimately impersonal verdict that allowed him to refine his lies. <words>318</words>
The nest became a training ground where madness measured itself against precision, each balloon pop a metronomic lesson. <words>336</words>
He would rewire small truths into heroic scripts until escape felt technically possible, like a door latched by grammar. <words>355</words>
By overhearing unguarded soliloquies he learned where edges lay, how to fold a memory into a pocket and claim it. <words>375</words>
The fabricated reality resisted, sending architects of doubt in the form of larger wasps and sharper pops. <words>392</words>
He answered with a recital stolen from a seamstress of nights, precise madness shaping his bravado into a scalpel. <words>411</words>
At the center of the nest a hollow hummed like a congregation, and there the undercurrent of clarity pulled him toward an unambiguous choice. <words>435</words>
He could continue performing, stacking lint and lies, or submit the lint-filled pocket to examination and let reality reassert itself. <words>455</words>
His hand moved, oddly calm, and amid balloon pops he dumped the lint onto wax as if confessing a theft. <words>475</words>
The lint unfolded into a map of phrases, and the undercurrent of clarity rearranged the nest's law to accommodate truth. <words>495</words>
