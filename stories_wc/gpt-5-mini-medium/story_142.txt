<story>
A broke aristocrat chose, in a stubbornly theatrical way, to walk instead of drive toward the ruined carousel like an apology to memories he could not else afford to buy back. <words>31</words>
He felt the legacy's burden as an heir of faded velvet and tax papers, a feeling that folded and tongued his ribs whenever the seaside amusement park appeared between parallel paths of his life and his debts. <words>68</words>
The roller coaster, rumor-laden and chewed with salt and rust, lurched in a haunted amusement park that smelled like burnt sugar and old promises, and the air made his vision a kind of blurry vividness where edges were both near and untrustworthy. <words>110</words>
He clutched a botanical illustration folded into his coat pocket like contraband, the page depicting a strange, realistically odd flower that his grandmother had sketched between recipes and ledger math. <words>140</words>
That botanical illustration was a map of flavor as much as botany, and it pulsed in his hand with annotations for secret recipes he had been driven to learn to honor and perhaps to sell. <words>175</words>
He wanted those recipes both to reconcile forgotten family dinners and to quiet the creditors who measured his worth in late notices and clipped shares. <words>200</words>
The amusement park had rules nobody listed, like how the coaster's shadows could harmonize with a memory and coax a confession out of a skeletal turntable. <words>226</words>
Between parallel paths of his present and an imagined past, he walked the track base watching the metal's lattice hum and imagining recipes emerging from the joints like whispered instructions. <words>256</words>
Realistically odd moments compounded, like a vendor's doll that counted change in Morse and a ticket booth that sold night terrors as tokens, but he kept folding the botanical page, lining its veins with his thumb until the ink seemed usable as a compass. <words>300</words>
At a platform under the highest loop, where black crows nested on safety bolts, he overheard a woman whispering pantry lists that matched marginalia on his grandmother's sketch and realized the park curated recipes as much as ghosts. <words>338</words>
Deciding to harmonize with the place rather than to bribe or bargain, he offered his botanical illustration to the whisperer as a promise and a question, and she took it like a map between confidences. <words>373</words>
She taught him recipes in half sentences, a salt measured by childhood, a reduction timed to the breath of the sea, and each instruction felt like dividing the legacy's burden into something small and transportable. <words>408</words>
He practiced in the shadow of the coaster, learning to harmonize spices with a soundtrack of creaks until the ghostly theater applauded softly. <words>431</words>
His hands regained the aristocrat's patient precision without the arrogance, and each successful dish lightened paper debts in his mind like torn receipts floating away. <words>456</words>
In the blurred vividness of that seaside night he learned that legacy could be shared and sold as nourishment. <words>475</words>
