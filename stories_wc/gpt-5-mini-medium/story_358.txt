The old-fashioned mage tended the arctic research greenhouse like a relic tending its own shrine. <words>15</words>
His coat smelled of wool and lamp oil, and his gestures betrayed a sanctified dread that made the seedlings seem like scripture. <words>37</words>
He was purposefully aimless in his patrols, letting fogged trays and frost patterns rearrange his route as if the greenhouse were a chapel labyrinth. <words>61</words>
Amid playground time on the distant base, when children squealed in hydroponic domes elsewhere, he sat alone bent over a fragment of a pharaoh's coffin, a sliver of gold and ebony that hummed like a foreign heart. <words>98</words>
The fragment held a riddle that unfolded like frost under a lamp, lines of carved hieroglyph glinting as if revealing grammar to the cold. <words>122</words>
He pursued the unfolding riddle by strange, small rituals, reading edges and interrupting reflections until the glyphs rearranged into sense. <words>142</words>
Those interruptions were enacted through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections in condensation and utility glass, where his face multiplied like accusations and comfort. <words>165</words>
He learned to extract the riddle's syllables from the wavering doubles, tracing mouth shapes on the mist until meaning coagulated. <words>185</words>
His aim, oddly enough, was both diffuse and glaringly specific: to claim an uncharted frontier of knowledge where the cold kept secrets and new gods might be born. <words>213</words>
The frontier he imagined was not land on any map but a liturgy of praxis, a place between science and ritual where the greenhouse's panes became windows into the possible. <words>243</words>
He would crouch and cuddle the fragment to his chest as if it were a child or a relic that required heat to speak, while outside polar wind debated the rigging. <words>274</words>
In those cuddles the sanctified dread softened to a filial care and then snapped back, because claiming frontiers does not permit indulgence. <words>296</words>
He preferred being purposefully aimless to hide a strategy of patient occupation, a tactic from a time when maps were permissions and curses interchangeable. <words>320</words>
Sometimes he let children from the nearby playground time wander in, placing snow-damp mittens on the benches and gaping at glass flowers, and he watched them with an odd tenderness that the riddle neither welcomed nor rejected. <words>357</words>
Reflections multiplied the children into choirs and the fragment into a totem, and through ephemeral encounters with those mirror doubles the mage solved each syllable like a pedagogue unwrapping secret lessons. <words>388</words>
As the unfolding riddle yielded its last line, a small geography of meaning, the greenhouse felt like consecrated tundra and he felt, for a moment, that the frontier belonged to him. <words>419</words>
Then the mirror panes fogged and cleared in a different order, and the riddle's final word opened like a mouth that would not stop chanting. <words>444</words>
Sanctified dread returned as the chant set frost crystals shivering into sigils, and the children fell silent, their playground laughter sealed like specimens. <words>467</words>
He realized claiming an uncharted frontier meant a stewardship that could not be gentle, and yet he cupped the fragment to his palms and whispered an apology to gods the ice might birth. <words>500</words>
