I am a skeptical spiritual medium who keeps both a ledger of doubts and a stubborn curiosity. <words>17</words>
Tonight I sit in an iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode, the facets throwing small suns across my knees. <words>37</words>
It is the hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak, that odd suspended moment where wind and breath both decide to listen. <words>61</words>
Around me the mists of uncertainty curl peculiarly frequent and near enough to brush the hem of my coat with chilly possibility. <words>83</words>
Clutched in my hand is a centaur horseshoe with runes, heavy and improbable, which I turn slowly as if reading the alphabet of a creature half made of earth and myth. <words>114</words>
I am not here to pretend I believe; I am here to learn forgotten crafts, to collect techniques whose threads have been lost in the wash of living. <words>142</words>
My posture is brazen humility, a crooked bow between arrogance and apology, because the work requires both insult and reverence. <words>162</words>
To strengthen the fragile knot of skill and faith, I rely on method as strange as any ritual: by the scent of a new book I call the right memory into being. <words>194</words>
When I press the horseshoe to my palm and breathe paper perfume, the runes answer in soft heat and a taste like iron and cedar. <words>219</words>
The cave hums, an orchestra of mineral and memory, and light pools where the geode walls dip like sleeping teeth. <words>239</words>
Outside that suspended hush a carnival crowd forgets its motion and I imagine the stalled coaster riders holding to hands and snacks, unwilling passengers in a pause that mirrors my inquiry. <words>270</words>
I am skeptical, but skepticism here is not a shield; it is a tuning fork, focused into something that wants to strengthen an old craft until it vibrates true. <words>299</words>
The horseshoe's runes light like sleepwalking matchsticks and images comeâ€”how to stitch horsehair braid into talismans, how to cut resin cleanly, how to translate the small, stubborn economies of a vanished guild. <words>331</words>
I smell glue and printer ink and possibility; the scent of a new book is not merely metaphor but a key that rearranges memory into hands that can make. <words>360</words>
Still, my doubt is peculiarly frequent and sometimes insists on proof, so I test the craft by doing small, careful things: I bind a splinter with horsehair, I mark a rune's shadow with powdered lapis. <words>395</words>
Each success loosens fear; each failure teaches patience, and as the coaster begins to creak forward again the cave seems to nod, approving of work done without promises. <words>423</words>
I leave with a centaur horseshoe wrapped in soft cloth, the runes quiet, my pockets full of paper patterns and the cheeky confidence that comes from knowing how to mend what was once forgotten. <words>457</words>
