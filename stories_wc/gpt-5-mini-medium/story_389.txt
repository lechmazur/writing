When the final calendar page of the year is flipped, the forgotten library inside the abandoned mine inhales the last light. <words>21</words>
A thin-lipped warlock arrives, formally casual in a moth-eaten frock coat and a necktie tied with exact indifference. <words>39</words>
He came to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite warnings carved in stone and whispered by miners who feared what learning does to hunger. <words>64</words>
In his hand he cradled a viking ship figurehead fragment, a battered curl of dragon and sea, a lost artifact that hummed like an unsold hymn. <words>90</words>
The library smelled of coal dust, oiled bindings, and the sour tang of texts declared discredited, the very tomes that promised remedies through rumored cures in discredited textbooks. <words>118</words>
He had optimized his route through the mine, mapping shelf-stacks and deadends with razor focus so the night would yield more pages per breath. <words>142</words>
The warlock's thin lips pressed when he read marginalia signed by hands long gone, each annotation another forbidden course of appetite. <words>163</words>
He spoke in a tone of confusing certainty, as if the contradictions of pages were merely puzzles waiting to be devoured. <words>184</words>
A miner's ledger fell open to a recipe that promised restoration through poultices and chants; the methods were labeled heresy by dentists and priests but perfect for optimizing the warlock's hunger for now. <words>217</words>
He believed that lost artifacts like the fragment could be keyed to cures that rewove memory and opened vaults of thought. <words>238</words>
A brittle map slid from a folio and showed a notation: optimize ritual sequence, binding figurehead piece to textbook recipe. <words>258</words>
Outside the shaft the year turned; someone flipped the last calendar page, and a clockwork bell deep underground nudged midnight like a knuckle at a locked door. <words>285</words>
He set the fragment on a lectern and opened a discredited textbook whose spine had been sutured with miners' hair. <words>305</words>
The textbook murmured recipes in cramped type and wild italics, promising cures that stitched wounds of mind and bone through baths and bitter tinctures. <words>329</words>
Each rumored cure was an instruction and a temptation; he optimized gestures, lips moving like a metronome over syllables older than the miners' songs. <words>353</words>
Warnings rattled in his memory — relatives, wardens, even a faded inscription that called him back — but his appetite for the fruit of knowledge outweighed the tremor of caution. <words>381</words>
He bent the fragment to the book as if mating two old engines, reciting a cure that mixed seawater, soot, and a syllable that tasted like ledger ink. <words>409</words>
Light from the fragment flared, revealing diagrams of lost artifacts and recipes that used names like marrow and memory as if they were spices. <words>433</words>
His certainty grew confusingly clear; the cures were not merely medicines but keys to rooms in the mind where pages hung ripe, and he intended to optimize his harvest, regardless of the cost. <words>466</words>
When the last bell tolled he laughed, thin-lipped and small, swallowed a syllable from the textbook, and the mine returned his appetite with subterranean laughter. <words>491</words>
