<story>The morbid florist arranged funeral orchids atop a low mat in the floating rock dojo, petals trembling as the wind under the stone carried distant tidal echoes and an obliging gull cried like a bell. <words>35</words>
She was called neutrally passionate by the monks because she spoke evenly of rot and bloom, obliged visitors with precise funerary bouquets, and never pretended to cheer the inevitable. <words>64</words>
In the last flicker of a guttering lantern she lifted a plain white candle from her apron, its wax skin soft as memory, because the dojo required light to pass judgment on petals and practice alike. <words>100</words>
She wanted to understand cosmic cycles, to see why blossoms submit to decay and why stones float with patient insistence, an inquiry that had tempered her beliefs from dogma to curious ritual. <words>132</words>
Boldly timid, she walked to the dojo's rim and set the candle on weathered tatami, obliging the air itself to hold a conversation between flame and stone, as if politeness could prop open a question. <words>167</words>
Around her, the other monks practiced katas on floating ledges; their movements were slow as seasons and sharp as thaw, neutral witnesses to her private experiment. <words>193</words>
Her motive was not spectacle but comprehension; she obliged herself through method, reading through the backlog of typed pages in a writer's trunk that smelled of ink and old grief. <words>223</words>
Those pages were marginalia and attempting narratives, cycles recorded like lunar rings, notes about compost, about return, and a rough diagram connecting blossom, bone, orbit, and breath. <words>250</words>
She read by that thin flame until the wick shivered and the lantern guttered lower, her eyes mapping recurrences as if the paragraphs could teach the choreography of centuries. <words>279</words>
Occasionally she obliged a hesitant monk with the plain white candle's light so they could sign a page or tie a last petal, sharing her small certainty without sermon. <words>308</words>
She cataloged rhythms: seed to stem, stem to rot, rot to soft returning soil, noting the writer's trunk references that matched celestial annotations sketched in graphite and tea stains. <words>337</words>
Her tempered beliefs did not sever mystery; they made space for curiosity, a vessel less brittle than certainty yet shaped by careful, almost formal doubt. <words>362</words>
As the lantern limned its last hollow, the candle flung a single long shadow that pointed toward an island of older stones, and she obliged the shadow with a question-what repeats, what returns? <words>396</words>
A monk answered by striking a stone that hummed like a planet's sigh, and she realized that the backlog of written cycles was less instruction and more map of what to expect and what to forgive. <words>432</words>
She blew the candle out, obliged the dark to hold the lesson, and felt herself both smaller and willed larger by the cycles she could finally name without fear. <words>461</words></story>
