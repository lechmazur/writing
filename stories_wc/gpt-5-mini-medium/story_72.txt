A sneering envoy arrived in the domed vineyard on a barren alien plain, an odd silhouette against glass and grapevine, his manner furiously tranquil as if anger had been practiced into stillness. <words>32</words>
He carried a folded note sealed with a handprint the color of distant nebulae, and he held it like contraband and like scripture, both accusation and plea. <words>59</words>
Around him the domed space hummed, rows of vines climbing latticework that kept warmth and memory in equal measure, a greenhouse neglected except for the weeds and the stubborn grapes. <words>89</words>
He began to sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse with a methodical hand, as if searching the past by texture rather than by truth, following paper trails others had left like breadcrumbs. <words>124</words>
Those paper trails braided contracts and love letters, shipping manifests and death notices, small bureaucracies of hope and erosion that led from the far edge of the plain to this salted dome. <words>156</words>
Across the hush of a possibility just born, the envoy thought of his motivation to cup starlight in mortal palms, an image at once ridiculous and inevitable that had driven him here. <words>188</words>
He was not naive about physics or metaphors; he knew the stars could not be gathered, yet the folded note contained instructions and a map as if the cosmos could be translated into a domestic plan. <words>224</words>
The sneer shadowed his face as he unfolded the fragile geometry of paper and intention, and his voice, when it escaped, rambled destiny in the half jokes and old threats scribbled in the margins. <words>258</words>
A stray vine brushed his wrist and he felt something like permission, a furiously tranquil pulse that told him to be both patient and reckless, to tally the ledger and to burn it after reading. <words>293</words>
Outside the dome the plain was a quiet white absence, the sky a lower-case sun, but here among grapes and dust the future felt fragile and writable. <words>320</words>
He sifted again, fingers prying at envelopes whose stamps were fossilized days, following the stamp-smudged trajectory of strangers who had once tried to hold parts of Heaven in their hands. <words>350</words>
Among the slips he found a recipe, a treaty fragment, and a child's crayon drawing of constellations annotated with parentheses of exultation, each sheet a verdict on desire. <words>378</words>
The folded note remained last, a simple rectangle like a pulse, and when he smoothed it the handwriting inside made the dome seem to tilt toward possibility. <words>405</words>
Its lines were not orders but invitations, a list of small rituals that promised to concentrate the night into a handful, a method to cup starlight in mortal palms if one could follow the paper trails exactly. <words>442</words>
He laughed, a thin sound that suggested surrender and the possibility of triumph at once, and he slipped the folded note into his coat, as if hiding a lit fuse. <words>472</words>
He stepped toward the dome exit, decisions trailing like ash. <words>482</words>
