I am an underachieving mage with a reputation for spells that sputter and charms that sigh, and I have learned to carry my inertia like a familiar. <words>27</words>
I stand in the abandoned space station control room that hovers low over a patch of land at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, watching the vanishing cornfields like an alibi. <words>60</words>
Bored excitement hums under my skin because this is where I will unveil the plan to reclaim an inheritance I never expected to want, and I will do it by springing a trap on my own limitations. <words>97</words>
The method is absurdly domestic: I coax artifact after artifact from the postal vacuum by tracking misdelivered packages that hitchhiked their way through interfarm transport and orbital freight errors. <words>126</words>
Each missent parcel becomes a small confession from a world that keeps sending me things I almost deserve, and among them arrived a doll head with blinking eyes that shouldn't still work. <words>158</words>
Its laughless porcelain face is chipped, its hair a tangle of dried static, but when my thumbs brushed its lashes the eyes blinked with a slow, deliberate curiosity that felt like a verdict from my grandmother. <words>194</words>
I am an heir by blood to a long line of operators who tuned satellite orchards and grafted weather to soil, but my apprenticeship fizzled while I practiced exceptionally usual tricks that made light bulbs flicker and kettles sing. <words>233</words>
Underachieving is a costume I wore to hide panic; it suited the bored excitement of my afternoons as I pretended not to notice heirloom schematics shoved into crates destined for other addresses. <words>265</words>
The control room smells of ozone and dry dust, as if the station coughed its last cigarette when the farm below stopped being worthy of satellite subsidy and the municipal authority stopped answering. <words>298</words>
I prop the doll head on the central console like a ridiculous crown and set the misdelivered packages in a loose orbit around it, each box a key lettered with other people's names. <words>331</words>
They hum when I touch them in the way parcels hum with the past, and the station's console lights respond to that hum because these systems remember the family registry by serial number. <words>364</words>
The doll blinks again, a metronome for my resolve, and I speak the unveiling words I rehearsed in tea-stained notebooks, the syllables a mortgage on my small courage. <words>392</words>
Light folds in the cracked visor of the doll, and a map of my lineage unfurls across the console in blue wire, naming plots and patents and debts that tie my knuckles to the soil below. <words>428</words>
Bored excitement spikes into a grin as I realize the trap is not to catch fate but to confront the disappointing reflex that kept me small, and I close my hands around the blinking head to feel its ridiculous certainties. <words>468</words>
