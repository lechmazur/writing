The wayward apothecary kept a map of monarch migration pinned under the brass dome of the steampunk submarine observation deck. <words>20</words>
He had been labeled unjustly fair by dockside politicians who disliked his habit of weighing mercy against advantage. <words>38</words>
Between broken treaties the vessel drifted like an argument, its portholes fogged with salt and radiator soot, while he bent rays of lamp light into charted paths. <words>65</words>
His mission was absurd and specific: to track migratory butterflies for reasons of both science and the ache of unconventional love that had lodged in his ribs. <words>92</words>
He suspected that a pattern in their crossings might be a message addressed to the ship's heart, a lover's howl disguised as ecology. <words>115</words>
To keep watch he carried a dry highlighter pen that had outlived its ink but still fit snugly in the pocket of his oilstained frock coat. <words>141</words>
The pen was nonsense to other observers, a talisman of failed notes, but he used its hollow shaft to store moth scales and tiny folded teleglyphs. <words>167</words>
At night he tapped installations of riveted glass and brass with a copper rod, sending Morse code signals through the hull that smelled faintly of oil and lavender. <words>195</words>
Those signals infected the ship's listening instruments like a soft song, coaxing the navigation coils to reorient toward fluttering cold bodies beyond the ocean's skin. <words>220</words>
The crew called it a contagion and blamed the apothecary's contraptions, but they could not deny that the sonar picked up fleeting pulses shaped like wings and impossible maps. <words>249</words>
He was wayward in more than vocation; he loved a cartographer who had left for dry docks when promises splintered into treaties torn and unreadable. <words>274</words>
Tracking butterflies became a ritual and a letter, each flutter a dot or dash of intent, and every cluster a sentence he could translate with lantern and patient thumb. <words>303</words>
In the battered marvel of the observation deck he kept jars and charts like relics, and he wrote responses in code by scraping the air with the dry highlighter pen as if ink were a spell. <words>339</words>
When a migrating band of orange ghosts swept past a porthole he tapped true long rhythms that read like apologies and invitations, infecting the currents of the hull with longing. <words>369</words>
Someone left a note wedged in a gear: your signals are unjustly fair, it said, and the wayward apothecary felt both accused and vindicated. <words>393</words>
He tapped back a single long sorrowful dash that translated to Come home, and sent a cluster of scaled fragments into the vent where they rode warm eddies toward the surface. <words>424</words>
Months later the cartographer returned through treaties still broken but smiling, and leaning on the observation rail she traced the Morse on the glass with a fingertip until the apothecary understood that unconventional love had infected both their maps. <words>463</words>
