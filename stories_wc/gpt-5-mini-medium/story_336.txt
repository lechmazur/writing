A weary undertaker moved through the marbled dusk of a reimagined ancient Persian palace carrying the weight of a lifetime in quiet steps. <words>23</words>
He paused under an arcaded loggia when in the hush after a car backfired in a silent street the sound hung like a coin and left both city and palace listening. <words>54</words>
A battered astronomical clock sat in the shadow of a frescoed wall its brass face scuffed by generations who believed it mapped not only the heavens but the rituals of those who kept secrets. <words>88</words>
He had been taught to read that clock by tribal knowledge an inheritance passed through whispered gestures and the smell of oil on fingers knowledge rarely practical yet precise in its claims. <words>120</words>
He liked to think those small teachings had been saved for something other than cataloging corpses. <words>136</words>
Tonight he faced the clock as if it were a prisoner he could imprison setting its hands with ritual slowness to trap a moment of light. <words>162</words>
He followed sun paths engraved into the palace floor a compass inked under centuries of footsteps and traced courses the city above had forgotten aligning bronze pointers with placid ferocity. <words>192</words>
Each alignment was less about geometry than about memory he locked an hour between two eclipses the way a coffin lid might be clapped down on a heartbeat. <words>220</words>
The palace smelled of crushed pomegranate old wax and a particular cold that settles when people expect nothing immediate an atmosphere that let him hold onto hope in the absolute dark like a lantern cupped in both hands. <words>258</words>
He was weary yes and in his pocket the undertaker kept a card with an old name but the exhaustion sharpened his purpose rather than dulled it. <words>285</words>
He had one clear method by following sun paths and forcing shadows into prescribed seams he could imprison a stretch of night and force the palace to remember its own light. <words>316</words>
Outside the palace the city stayed hushed after that solitary backfire a stray dog padded past and a radio that belonged to nobody played a single old love song as if the world were testing his faith. <words>353</words>
He turned the astronomical clock's zodiac wheel with gloved fingers feeling the unlikely mechanics whirr like a throat the instrument was ornate and almost ceremonial rarely practical yet heir to rituals that outlawed forgetting. <words>387</words>
He did not expect to resurrect anyone only to keep a shape of hope intact a precise interval where grief could breathe and the living might find the courage to enter the dark and return. <words>422</words>
When the last pointer clicked into place the palace bells did nothing and the world stayed mute but inside his chest a rhythm started again small and stubborn and he knew the trapped hour had become a promise. <words>460</words>
