In the glass nave of the extraterrestrial embassy, a secretive conjurer arranged his tools before the first dance began.<words>19</words>
He moved with calculated dreams, fingers lingering on a threadbare washcloth that smelled faintly of sea and soil, and an heirloom piece of jewelry tucked under his sleeve sparked a story he dared not shout.<words>54</words>
He called himself philosophically shallow to disarm listeners while he wove layers of compassion into each incantation to tame the embassy's temperamental biolights and coax wind from sealed vents.<words>83</words>
