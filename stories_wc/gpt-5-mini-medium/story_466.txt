<story>Amid grocery shopping, a cunning connoisseur balanced a basket and a secret with a practiced smile. <words>16</words>
He was morally ambiguous by habit, trading favors and tastes so quietly that neighbors called him charming and neighbors called others gullible. <words>38</words>
In his tote lay a bundle of vintage seed packets whose envelopes smelled faintly of dust and the sea of years. <words>59</words>
They had come to him through a xerograph of a ledger, a copied inventory exchanged in a backroom that made his mouth water. <words>82</words>
Decoding the forgotten had become his private amusement and his map to futures others would not imagine. <words>99</words>
A sudden urge to explore a path not taken nudged him between aisles when the clearheaded lists of shoppers blurred into possibility. <words>121</words>
He left his cart by the fresh herbs and climbed a rusting ladder that led to the town's old smoke signal tower, a relic repurposed as a community archive. <words>150</words>
Inside, amid coils of rope and a window fogged by weather, he spread the seed packets like tarot cards, attentive to prints, stains, and ghosted handwriting. <words>176</words>
His hands, skilled in connoisseurship, lingered where margins carried shorthand and smudges that felt like clues rather than accidents. <words>195</words>
He justified his moral ambiguity by saying destiny had markets and he was simply creating supply. <words>211</words>
Each packet harbored a cipher of dates, town names, and botanical doodles that his xerograph ledger had only hinted at. <words>231</words>
He decoded in long, patient breaths, treating paper like memory and memory like currency, until an address resolved into a coordinate in a landscape of fog. <words>257</words>
His motive was to corner an elusive destiny, not with violence but with botanical monopolies and stories that would bend markets and loyalties. <words>280</words>
Outside, distant car horns and the squeak of trolleys threaded with the random calm of grocery announcements, folding the ordinary world into his experiment. <words>304</words>
He felt gentle chaos settle on his shoulders, a soft wind of possibility that made him smile and worry in equal measure. <words>326</words>
A neighbor wandered up to fetch forgotten basil and paused, eyeing the tower with the curious mix of suspicion and reverence that had always accompanied the connoisseur's reputation. <words>354</words>
He told her a small lie about research and a larger truth about stewardship, and she fed the lie because it smelled like kindness and the truth because it promised gardens. <words>385</words>
As dusk painted the tower salmon, the packets arranged themselves into a route, a botanical breadcrumb trail toward a forgotten greenhouse at the map's ragged edge. <words>411</words>
He imagined the corner he would make of that destiny, shelves of rare seeds and a ledger of allegiance, and felt both glee and the hollow stir of conscience. <words>440</words>
A sudden impulse, less planned than prayer, pushed him down the tower stairs and back through the market, each step a contraction of the life he knew and an expansion toward what the seed packets promised. <words>476</words>
