<story>The burnt-out general sat at the counter of the Dark Matter Diner between rides, his medals dulled by cigarette smoke and cosmic dust. <words>23</words>
He had become rationally absurd in habits and jokes, a man who measured grief in ledger lines and insulted fate with a grin. <words>46</words>
Around him, an odd congregation of night workers nursed their shared anxieties over coffee and chipped pie while a plate of dried seaweed passed like contraband between hands. <words>74</words>
He had one mission that felt equal parts absurd and holy: to renew his gangly faith in logic long enough to dethrone fear from the throne of reason. <words>102</words>
His method was stranger still: he would map the town's terrors via arcs in black-and-white photographs, pinning sequence like birds to a corkboard of breakfast booths. <words>128</words>
Between rides, when the shuttle whistles sighed outside, he coaxed patrons with mischievous wisdom to hand over snapshots of small disasters and private victories. <words>152</words>
Each arc told a story of recurring tremors: an elbow trembling, a hand hesitating over a ring, a child angled away from a photograph, and together they braided the patrons' shared anxieties into intelligible rhythm. <words>187</words>
He was a burnt-out general who could still diagram retreat routes in his sleep, and now he diagrammed courage, trying to renew the lines until bravery followed the arrows instead of hiding behind them. <words>221</words>
He handed a strip of dried seaweed to a waitress and suggested, with a conspiratorial wink, that they feed their fears to the strip and watch what stuck and what drifted away. <words>253</words>
Photographs were scrubbed, rearranged, and linked with yarn until the diner resembled a constellation chart that proved, in its small, rationally absurd way, how named anxieties could be circled, laughed at, and then quietly reduced. <words>288</words>
His motivation was blunt and theatrical: to dethrone fear from the throne of reason by turning private alarms into communal punchlines and practical steps. <words>312</words>
Between rides he taught them a game of gentle exposure: each person confessed a tiny dread, then picked a photograph arc and proposed one modest countermeasure to try by the next whistle. <words>344</words>
He played too, slipping his own trembling scrawl into the collage, admitting that the map of retreats sometimes hid a map of return and that admitting fear had been his first small victory. <words>377</words>
At dawn, after a night of whispering trades and clipped laughter, the diner felt renewed: the throne of reason had acquired jester cushions, and fear, unseated, looked oddly ordinary among the coffee cups. <words>410</words>
The burnt-out general stood, folded his coat made of excuses, pocketed the last strip of dried seaweed, and between rides walked into the light with a grin that married mischief and wisdom. <words>442</words></story>
