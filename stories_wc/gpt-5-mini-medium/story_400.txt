<story>After the last human set foot on earth, a guarded druid sat beneath the hung trees of a glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice. <words>27</words>
He was fiercely ambivalent about ritual and solitude, part attached to memory and part repelled by what echoes lingered. <words>46</words>
The orchard's branches bowed with frost and fruit, trees that had grown into ladders and windows after centuries of slow frost and negotiation with wind. <words>71</words>
He had come to gather the ingredients for a special family meal prepared only on birthdays, a method carried across generations of one family that remembered itself in mushrooms, sap, and the thin sweet meat of ice apples. <words>109</words>
It was a strange birth rite for the planet's last celebrations, meant not to produce offspring but to reset the quiet between living things and language, to break long silences. <words>139</words>
The druid's motivation was simple and sharp: to overcome a crippling fear that had hollowed many years of his vigilanceâ€”the particular terror of speaking first and finding only echo. <words>168</words>
He kept a dull safety pin threaded through his cloak like a talisman, ridiculous and useful, an object for small repairs and greater courage. <words>192</words>
That pin's dullness mattered; it was proof against superstition and ostentation, and its blunt point comforted him when hesitation tightened his chest. <words>214</words>
He invited no ghosts, only the bristled remains of family: lichens that hummed in low consonance, a pair of patient foxes with frost on their whiskers, and a sapling that counted rings like beads. <words>248</words>
They gathered as if summoned by gravity and memory, around a flat slab of cooled stone placed over the crevasse to keep their shadows from falling into the blue. <words>277</words>
The meal was a careful composition: ice apple halves seared on geothermal embers, boiled lichen broth, and a single slice of preserved root that tasted of bone and hymn. <words>306</words>
He stirred and ladled and offered first to the foxes, then the lichens, then his own bowl, a ritual sequence practiced once a year to prove that sound could return without catastrophe. <words>338</words>
Dour amusement creased his face as the fox nudged a bowl and made a small, accidental clack that sent a scattering of crumbs and a brittle, unplanned sound into the air. <words>369</words>
The silence did not retaliate; it arched and listened, and in that listening the druid felt his fear loosen its claws just enough to let him try. <words>396</words>
He cleared his throat, the sound raw and ridiculous and magnificent, and then he spoke the family's old blessing: a single crooked line about harvest, wind, and staying. <words>424</words>
The crevasse answered with a distant, ice-made echo that was not empty but braided with the foxes' tails, the lichens' slow song, and the druid's own cautious laughter, and in that braided echo he found a small victory over terror. <words>464</words>
Later he pinned a scrap of cloth closed with the dull safety pin and tucked the ritual's residue of warmth into his chest like a stubborn ember, fiercely ambivalent but healing. <words>495</words></story>
