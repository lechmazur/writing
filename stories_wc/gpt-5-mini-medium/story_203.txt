<story>The exorcist with stage fright worked amid toy assembly on a derelict spindle of orbital debris. <words>16</words> He kept pressed wildflowers in a titanium locket as a talisman against the vacuum and his own trembling voice. <words>35</words> The inheritance of lies had arrived folded into legal papers and a small spool of instruction parts that smelled faintly of lacquer. <words>57</words> He was never usual, his mentor had once joked, because he performed rites with hands that shook like newly assembled gears. <words>78</words> Around him, the orbital debris drifted like a cemetery of forgotten toys while small servos clicked and tiny limbs locked amid toy assembly. <words>101</words> His motivation was precise and almost obscene in its hope: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of never, to turn inherited falsehood into something true. <words>126</words> He would submerge the lies, he thought, in a ceremony that mixed circuitry and prayer, burying them under a layer of resin and sentiment. <words>150</words> By the sound of a key turning in a lock, the hatch sealed and the workshop hummed like an organ, a defiant hush pressing into the cavity of his throat. <words>180</words> That hush was an ally; it let him whisper the names of things he had been taught to banish and the names he had been taught to keep. <words>208</words> He pinned a pressed wildflower beneath a circuit board as if making an altar, petals flattened to paper, colors preserved against time and impact. <words>232</words> The lies that came with the inheritance were precise little machines of omission and theatrical kindness, promises that performed well on stage but dissolved under calibration. <words>258</words> He flinched as he recited the banishment, a ritual more like a script than a sacrament, the stage fright gnawing at syllables meant to sever. <words>283</words> Each bolt he tightened and every toy limb he assembled was another word in his countertestimony against the inheritance of lies. <words>304</words> Sometimes his hands betrayed him, music of tremor translating into a laugh track of misassembled parts, but the pressed wildflowers never crumbled. <words>326</words> He told himself the ritual was never usual and therefore honest, a confession performed in private vacuum instead of on a mother's stage. <words>349</words> Once, by the sound of a key turning in a lock, he had locked away a child's inheritance of lies too gently and watched it bloom into other people's cruelty. <words>379</words> This time he would submerge the fibrous contracts beneath polymer and prayer, sink them where no orbiting scavenger could pry them up. <words>401</words> He set a toy soldier upon the sealed seam, a tiny sentinel, and sealed the resin with a breath that was equal parts apology and defiance. <words>427</words> When the hatch snapped, the world outside became a scatter of metal and memories, but inside his locket the pressed wildflowers and the quiet of his voice lived on. <words>456</words> He imagined the ashes of never hardening into something that might be handled, and for the first time in years his stage fright felt like fuel rather than a chain. <words>486</words></story>
