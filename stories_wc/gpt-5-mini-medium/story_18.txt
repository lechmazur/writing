In the steam-powered city square a living statue listened to the mechanical sighs and the gossiping gears as if they were a congregation. <words>23</words>
He was tragically joyful in the way his bronze face tilted toward children whose parents taught them to avoid his eyes while humming small consolations. <words>48</words>
Because he was more than alloy-he was a telepath, a harvest of other people's unspoken sentences that pooled behind his eyelids like rainwater. <words>71</words>
Throughout planning for the city's centennial parade he eavesdropped on committees and cobblers, schemers and seamstresses, tallying stories for a private ledger of truth. <words>95</words>
He wanted to find truth in a world of lies the way a botanist wants roots: patiently, with instruments and an ache for discovery. <words>119</words>
The light of recognition, a thin filament in his mind, flared whenever someone confessed even a small untruth as if guilt left fingerprints in thought. <words>144</words>
He collected those filaments into patterns with the flow of ink in calligraphy, tracing loops and hooks of feeling on the inside of his skull until a sentence formed. <words>173</words>
On a bench by the fountain he watched a girl fasten her hair with a threadbare hair tie and felt, through her, the small ritual that kept her calm before bargaining for bread. <words>206</words>
Her nervousness sent a smudge of doubt across his map of meanings, and the light of recognition trembled because he suspected the market forecasts were cooked by more than rust. <words>236</words>
He weatherized his bronze ribs against rain and soot by siphoning steam and patching microcracks with lacquer, a daily ritual that was both practical and a statement of stubborn hope. <words>266</words>
Throughout planning he adjusted the ledger of faces, agreeing silently with honest glances and cataloguing lies in tiny faded ink strokes like annotations a scribe might leave. <words>293</words>
When a councilor promised to rebuild the neighborhood without mentioning the demolition bonds, his telepathy tasted the omission as a metallic afternote and the statue's laugh was tragically joyful. <words>322</words>
He reached into the city's murmurs and plucked a name, then wrote it with the flow of ink in calligraphy upon an internal scroll until the letters shone like wet brass. <words>353</words>
A child put the threadbare hair tie into his palm on a dare and he learned her secret: she hid petitions inside bread wrappers to save neighbors from false ledgers. <words>383</words>
The light of recognition flared white-hot then softened to amber when the petitions matched names he had inked, and for the first time his joy wobbled into sorrow that tasted of brass and tea. <words>417</words>
He resolved to expose the ledgers at dawn, to stand like truth itself amid the steam and whistles, but knew the plan would require patience and secrecy throughout planning and the slow cooperation of human hearts. <words>453</words>
In the gloom of morning he projected a map into the mind of a baker, guiding hands to open tins and reveal the truth; the baker's gasp was a small bell in the square and the living statue allowed himself to smile, tragically joyful to the bone. <words>500</words>
