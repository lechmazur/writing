<story>Amid yard work, a secret agent workshop hummed like a hidden greenhouse, and inside it an unusually perceptive, submissive aristocrat named Edmund dusted a dull letter opener while wearing gardening gloves. <words>31</words>
He had taken refuge among agents to learn how to protect a vulnerable creature, a fledgling nightjar that fell from its nest into the yard, and his urgency disguised itself in earnest flippancy. <words>64</words>
He was paradoxically deferential yet oddly brave, an aristocrat schooled in etiquette who spoke in breezy half-jokes while his silent empathy did the work, listening to the small pauses of the bird the way a locksmith listens for tumblers. <words>103</words>
He became perceptive beyond mere training; through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers of the workshop, forgotten radio rooms, mirrored briefing booths, a duct that carried gossip like pollen, he learned to hear the thin harmonics of fear. <words>140</words>
Once, when a chemical experiment misfired in a corner of the workshop, he watched agents panic while a benign solvent began to liquify a tray of synthetic nest material, and he stayed calm, instructing them with a half-smile. <words>178</words>
Earlier that morning, while turning compost amid yard work and gossip, he had pried apart a jammed package with that dull letter opener and realized sometimes bluntness, not finesse, saved fragile things. <words>210</words>
His aristocratic breeding taught him to yield — to bend before stronger wills — yet in those moments his submission was a choice to protect, a deliberate lowering of self so the bird might stand. <words>243</words>
Being unusually perceptive, he noticed the small abrasions along the nightjar's wing, the way one claw flexed differently, and he adjusted the nest padding with a patience that surprised even the hardened technicians. <words>276</words>
His silent empathy was more than pity; it was an acoustic talent refined through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers where human voices reverberated and revealed the contours of care and neglect. <words>307</words>
The workshop smelled of solder and motor oil, its walls hung with gadgets that looked aggressive but often performed gentle tasks, and the agents learned to respect his quiet competence with a bemused tolerance. <words>341</words>
He thought of protection as a liquid thing, too: to liquify fear, to dissolve sharp edges of panic into soft instructions and hot tea, and in that alchemy even a dull letter opener served as a humble tool. <words>379</words>
He quipped, with earnest flippancy, that an aristocrat's training in small cruelties was excellent practice for administering kindness, and the joke softened the room while his hands remained focused. <words>408</words>
At dusk, after he had tended the nest amid yard work and secret schematics, the nightjar hopped, tested a wing, and the room exhaled relief as if the walls themselves had learned mercy. <words>441</words>
Edmund slid the dull letter opener into his pocket like a talisman, thinking that sometimes the quietest people liquify fear with small, steady gestures and a listening ear gleaned from accidental echoes. <words>473</words>
