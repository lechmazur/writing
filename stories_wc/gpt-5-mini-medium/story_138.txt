<story>Between text messages he sat in the spontaneous combustion lab, a forgotten noble with a posture that insisted on kingship no matter how quietly ruined. <words>25</words>
Hollow recklessness draped his decisions like an old coat as he listened for truths between the ping and ding of incoming texts. <words>47</words>
He kept an artificial hummingbird drone perched on a soldering iron, its wings tirelessly mimicking sincerity while its lenses reflected his face back at him. <words>72</words>
He liked the way its small gestures offered candor in small moments, the tiny mechanical chirp a punctuation that revealed more than any speech he avoided. <words>98</words>
He was mysteriously obvious in his secrecy, a contradiction that made him easy prey for his own illusions and for those who sold him certainty. <words>123</words>
He wanted to cut through illusions; he had been spared any real throne but not the hunger for something sincere. <words>143</words>
So between messages, a pause full of unnamed possibility, he would fortify himself against flattering lies by assembling rituals. <words>162</words>
His favorite ritual was oddly tangible: through the reassembly of old ticket stubs he reconstructed moments when he had been genuinely seen. <words>184</words>
He pasted edges, aligned perforations, and with trembling glue rebuilt cheap proofs of concerts, fairs, and distant trains that had once reduced him to honest laughter. <words>210</words>
Each stub became a keyhole to an afternoon when his manner slipped and candor visited like a friend, glimpses he could hold against his chest like talismans. <words>237</words>
The hummingbird drone would watch as he worked, lowering into his palm with a curiously human patience, a tiny prosecutor for truth. <words>259</words>
Sometimes it trilled a note that made him confess to it and to no one else, small admissions that cut through the saffron fog of aristocratic affectation. <words>286</words>
His fortifications were not stone but these rituals and the mechanical bird that insisted on noticing; they hardened a resolve to see clearly even when seeing hurt. <words>313</words>
In the lab's odor of ozone and polymer, spontaneous sparks sometimes licked the ceiling and the noble would laugh as if daring fate to simplify his life. <words>340</words>
Hollow recklessness pushed him to tear at comfortable narratives, to answer messages with bluntness that would disappoint allies and expose pretenses. <words>361</words>
But when a manager called him hollow in one curt text, he held the reconstructed ticket for a street parade and felt the famous ache of being seen truly. <words>390</words>
He realized then that candor in small moments was armor and wound both, and that his strangely obvious secrecy could become a tool to cut through the gilded mist. <words>419</words>
He fed the drone a confessory set of stubs and it hummed and flashed as if blessing the act, and for a moment the lab felt less like a stage and more like a chapel. <words>454</words>
Between text messages the noble whispered simple truths into the drone's tiny microphone, not to sway anyone but to fortify himself against comfortable delusions. <words>478</words>
He did not seek redemption, only clarity; the ritual, the drone, and the stubs were instruments to cut through illusions forever. <words>499</words>
