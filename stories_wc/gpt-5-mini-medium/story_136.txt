<story>Before recorded history, in a dim root system mapping facility buried like a thought under glaciers and soil, a quiet matchmaker listened. <words>22</words>
She was silently talkative, articulating connections by the tremor of breath and the tilt of her head as much as by speech. <words>44</words>
Her purpose was to decode natural patterns: not for profit or prophecy but to map how root and fungal networks reconstituted life, the cycle of rebirth made visible. <words>72</words>
She kept a mariner’s log book on an oak slab, anachronism and talisman, filled with grain marks, ash smudges, and diagrams of water moving along root conduits. <words>99</words>
The facility smelled of spoil and sap, its stone benches carved by generations who charted darkness with patience rather than light. <words>120</words>
Her matchmaking did not pair lovers but organisms and moments: a seed with a fungus sheath, a decayed trunk with mycelial memory, each alignment a small resurrection. <words>147</words>
She feared routine; she feared stagnation, so she devised a dangerous experiment that would jeopardize the accepted rhythms to reveal deeper loops. <words>169</words>
The method was improbable: by rewiring an outdated vr headset salvaged from a vanished camp, she intended to let the living roots dictate imagery and sequence. <words>195</words>
She wired electrodes to fungal rhizomorphs and moss filaments, translating the electrochemical sighs of decay and growth into flickers and narratives. <words>216</words>
When the headset lit, vision came from the underworld: sedimentary stars, looping seasons compressed to moments, the same root path revisiting the same dead leaf in altered guise. <words>244</words>
It was painful joy; she laughed through tears as fossils breathed and sprouted again in the simulation, an empathic ache of knowing and losing and knowing anew. <words>271</words>
The log book jittered beside her as if recording with invisible ink, her glyphs aligning with the headset's output until the pages almost hummed with a timeline. <words>298</words>
People called her a quiet matchmaker with more patience than speech, but she was more: a midwife for cycles, moving between deaths and sprouts like a reluctant priestess. <words>326</words>
The danger of her project manifested slowly; some roots avoided the probes, others accelerated, and a stubborn tree aborted its bloom, which made her heart lurch with culpable elation. <words>355</words>
She had jeopardized stability, and the facility's elders wanted the headset destroyed, yet the visions had shown a pattern: decay folding back into growth on a precise cadence. <words>383</words>
Understanding that cadence was why she rewired the headset; to decode natural patterns was not mere curiosity but a duty to shepherd rebirth with less violence. <words>409</words>
In the end she refused to tear the device apart; instead she annotated the mariner’s log book with the algorithmic gestures she had coaxed from moss and root, a lullaby for cycles. <words>441</words>
Her work would jeopardize complacency and yet preserve life by teaching future hands how to listen; painful joy stitched into instruction, a balanced transgression. <words>465</words>
When she finally closed the headset's visor, roots outside the facility sighed in windless rhythm, and she felt the comfort of being part of a cycle that neither began nor ended but recycled itself. <words>499</words>
