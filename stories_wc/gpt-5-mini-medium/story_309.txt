I am an overworked detective who treats exhaustion like a second language, and right now I am riffling through a junk drawer at the Vanishing Point Gallery while the hush that follows the final siren settles like ash. <words>38</words>
The gallery smells of old varnish and too many ideas collapsed into frames, a perfect mausoleum for a career that keeps asking for lives it never had. <words>65</words>
I am confidently unsure while I rummage; that is my charm and my curse, a detective who knows procedural steps but cannot be trusted to believe the future will be generous. <words>96</words>
Between receipts and a rusted key I find a single playing card, its edges whispering as if embarrassed to be found outside of a pocket or a plot. <words>124</words>
The card is a joker, grinned like a bad joke at my expense, and I hold it between two fingers like a tiny, defiant flag against inevitability. <words>151</words>
Memories arrive like strangers I once loved: sharp details that refuse to be dismissed, and their impact is a weather I feel in bone. <words>175</words>
I press the joker to my temple and use a half-damaged kaleidoscope I keep for reasons that look sentimental and probably are, letting its fleeting images flicker the past into my pupils. <words>207</words>
They come as shards and brief whole scenes - childhood alleyways, shouting lovers, the precise sound of a mother closing a door - each shard recalibrating how urgent the looming inevitability seems. <words>237</words>
I am trying to outdance that inevitability, which is why I keep breathing sarcasm like a molten lamp, lighting the gallery while secretly learning the steps I would need to not be swallowed. <words>270</words>
Each kaleidoscope pivot sends a new confession: a suspect who smelled like lemon, a partner I double-crossed, a violin I once loved more than sleep, and they all tug at the card between my fingers. <words>305</words>
Memories are not tidy evidence; they smear and resist subpoena, but tonight their smear is a map and the map points to one brittle truth about the inevitable. <words>333</words>
I rummage again, more forceful, more theatrical, because if you have to be defeated you can at least stage it with flair. <words>355</words>
The single playing card becomes a metronome; I tap it against my thumb and the past answers in tempo, images from the damaged kaleidoscope aligning into a staircase I can almost climb. <words>387</words>
The hush deepens, a kind of gravity that wants to resign me, but I am confidently unsure enough to fake a dance step of hope and watch the inevitability flinch. <words>417</words>
At the vanishing point of the gallery, where light goes to argue with shadow, I drop the joker onto the floor, and in the crack of its fall a memory loosens itself enough for me to breathe and, for a wild moment, outdance fate. <words>461</words>
