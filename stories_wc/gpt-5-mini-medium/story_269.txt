<story>
After the last code is broken, a nostalgic tailor climbs the iron ribs of a steampunk observation deck to stand before a dusty mirror that hangs like a forgotten portal. <words>30</words>
The deck smells of coal and rain and the machinery hums with a rhythm that remembers other tides, while thunder prepares the improbable admissions that will come. <words>57</words>
He is nostalgic in a way that fits his needles and pockets; he stitches memories into cloth and keeps an extra stitch for the life that might have been, like a seam saving a secret. <words>92</words>
The dusty mirror is subtly menacing, its glass whispering twin images whose smiles lag behind his by a breath, as if two parallel lives negotiated their own pace. <words>120</words>
He wants to ascend beyond mortal limits, a motive that tinkers with his bones and makes him fold nights into lapels and mornings into cufflinks. <words>145</words>
After the last code is broken the city recalibrates: clocks sigh differently and lungs learn new languages, so during storms he climbs the railing and reassures the glass by confessing impossibilities that sound like prayers. <words>180</words>
He confesses, in a low staccato voice, that he has walked between branches of time and patched a hundred selves into a single coat, that he has loved customers in scores of other weather and returned their letters with his needle. <words>221</words>
The mirror answers by reflecting a version of him who is bald at the temples and wearing a crown of broken compass needles, and the reflection confesses back in impossible accents about a machine that lifts souls like birds. <words>260</words>
Storms make both confessions feel inevitable, rain freckling the brass and lightning stitching the railing to the sky, and his reassurances arrive like performed rituals that steady his hands and split his fear. <words>293</words>
Yet each confession seeds a ladder; each improbable admission during storms is a rung, and as the thunder rehearses his vows the other self practices the ascent on the other side of the glass. <words>327</words>
He is subtly menacing in the way he plans to peel back mortality — not cruelly, but with the focused patience of a man who measures souls like patterns — and that menace comforts him. <words>362</words>
Hopeful desperation winds through his stitches; he must believe he can become more than flesh because otherwise the confessions would be only delusion and the mirror would be only glass. <words>392</words>
As the clockwork above the city slows to a polite halt, he and his reflection negotiate a final design: a garment of ascending doors stitched with lightning, an engine of etiquette and wild intention that could ferry consciousness beyond the skin. <words>433</words>
They promise each other impossible things during the last peal of the storm, and when he steps through the dusty mirror the observation deck inhales and the city counts differently, but even if his body stays behind his hope has already begun to climb. <words>477</words>
