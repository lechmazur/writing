<story>
A wandering orchardist arrived at the forgotten underwater city hall carrying a collection of dried leaves and the quiet certainty of someone both trustworthy and unique. <words>26</words>
He had learned kitchen table wisdom from elders who traded fruit for maps and gossip in other lives, and now he wanted to reclaim patterns of barter that had been erased by tides of time. <words>61</words>
The city hall sat like a reliquary beneath salt and memory, its marble columns colonized by anemones and memory, yet upstairs a council chamber somehow preserved a long table where he imagined many dinners had taught pragmatic truths. <words>99</words>
He traced notes on the dried leaves, each a ledger of wind, price, route, and rumor stretching through the infinite possibilities of a multiverse, because maps were not single things here but branching prophecies. <words>133</words>
He was a trustworthy unique presence in a place where trust had to be earned among ghosts, and villagers had whispered his name when storms reverted orchards into memory. <words>162</words>
His motivation was not glory but the sober trade of mapping routes that would let isolated groves exchange grafts, seedstock, and knowledge across drowned thresholds. <words>187</words>
The hall's ledger room had been hollowed into a garden of paperwork where shells pressed flat over faded ink and his dried leaves lay like a palimpsest he meant to reclaim. <words>218</words>
At the long kitchen table he set the leaves out one by one, thinking of what elders had taught over cups of cider - the small rules that stitch survival together, kitchen table wisdom condensed into gestures. <words>255</words>
He closed his eyes and let a phantom hand touch the paper, an old method of counsel that felt like a mittened vote from the city itself, and in that touch marginal ink shifted into new alignments. <words>292</words>
Via the touch of a phantom hand the dried leaves rearranged their notes into routes that cut through submerged markets and ley channels, revealing barter chains that bent across servers of worlds. <words>324</words>
He recorded them with a blunt pencil, gritty with salt, and the map he drew looked less like geometry than like a grieving tree, routes as roots plaited toward docks that no longer smelled of fish but of stories. <words>363</words>
A merchant ghost listened with the stubborn bureaucracy of someone who had balanced ledgers for centuries and offered a single correction: trade favors must respect seasons of the tree and the tide. <words>395</words>
He nodded, feeling bittersweet grit in his chest, because reclaiming routes meant reopening wounds but also rebuilding a flimsy commerce that might save indifferent saplings on distant shores. <words>423</words>
He folded the map into the leaves, pockets of aroma and ink, and set them like offerings beneath a mayoral seal that hummed faintly with municipal regret. <words>450</words>
