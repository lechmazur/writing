A tuneless bard sat brazenly in the steampunk airship dining room amid poetry readings, humming oddly while clutching a stained manuscript. <words>21</words>
He was fiercely nonchalant about his off-key warbling, a posture that made listeners lean in even as the brass engines thudded and gaslight flickered. <words>45</words>
The stained manuscript belonged to no known poet but carried margins of instructions and warnings written in soot and sugar-gloss ink, its pages smelling faintly of smoke and orange peel. <words>75</words>
Twisted word-of-mouth legends claimed the manuscript could tame chaos itself if read exactly backward on the night the engines coughed and a storm bit at the hull. <words>102</words>
He was motivated by a single exquisite impulse to kiss the horizon of madness and see what might answer when polite reality was unmade. <words>126</words>
Around him, diners recited clipped rhymes and sipped copper tea as if cultivating normalcy, their faces brass-steamed and tired, lending rhythm to his odd mission. <words>151</words>
He struck a tinderbox open with a flourish that made a nearby child clap and the cook frown, coaxing sparks like punctuation before he began to read. <words>178</words>
His reading was not melodic in the slightest, a scatter of cadences and wrong notes that felt more like a ritual cough than a song; he read fiercely nonchalant, as if daring chaos to care. <words>213</words>
Legends whispered that the manuscript required being sung into the tinderbox's sparks, that the heat would translate letters into obedient embers, but he chose instead to speak it aloud to the room, syllables flung like ballast. <words>249</words>
Word-of-mouth legends melded into the present as other patrons leaned closer, their conversation folding into the stanza, and with each misplayed line a strange calm threaded the din. <words>277</words>
A gust rattled the portholes; the ship pitched, but the hush only drew tighter, the chaos outside finding a rhythm to be tamed by syllables that refused to harmonize. <words>306</words>
He wanted to kiss the horizon of madness not as surrender but as a cartographer laying a new coastline, mapping the edge in ink and off-key breath. <words>333</words>
The stained manuscript's margins urged paradoxical methods: read it backward, read it under flame, read it while the engines hiccupped, but the twisted word-of-mouth legends insisted the rite required community rather than a lone pyromania. <words>368</words>
So he invited the room into the awkward chorus, encouraging the crusty poet and the mechanist to repeat a line backwards, and even the captain murmured a hesitant consonant. <words>397</words>
Together their mangled verses warmed the tinderbox and the stained manuscript shimmered like a panicked moon, chaos folding into an order that felt mischievously tender. <words>422</words>
He kissed that horizon of madness with brazen humility, pleased and perplexed, and the ship sailed steadier. <words>439</words>
