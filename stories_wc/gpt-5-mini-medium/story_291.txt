<story>
A daring ship captain found himself ashore in a haunted amusement park mirror maze, the salt still in his skin and the horizon turned to glass. <words>26</words>
He clutched a frayed coil of rope from a prison escape like an old compass, its fibers telling him where luck and law had tangled. <words>51</words>
His motive was plain and stubborn; to stand guard over his own spark of defiance, a small flare of seafaring outrage that refused domestication. <words>75</words>
In the calculated wilderness of reflected corridors he moved deliberately accidental, as if he balanced intention and chance like cargo on a volatile deck. <words>99</words>
He had spent a life confronting prejudice from crowded harbors to captain's tables, so the maze's whispered judgments felt like old barnacles clinging to his hull. <words>125</words>
Yet tonight the prejudice came not from faces but from panes that multiplied you and labeled you in reflections, insisting he be smaller, softer, more tame. <words>151</words>
He refused to overlook even the smallest mirror verdict; overlooking was surrender, and he had vowed to guard that spark that had survived brig storms and prison bars. <words>179</words>
Outside the maze, while the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree, a wind carries the smell of rot and cider and the slow tick of seasons turning. <words>207</words>
He paused at a junction of angled glass, fingers on the frayed coil of rope from a prison escape, deciding whether to bind himself to a stubborn memory or cut loose and vanish. <words>240</words>
Through strange cosmic echoes the mirrors answered, folding years into tides and prejudice into patterns, and he heard voices that were not his and yet taught him his language. <words>269</words>
Some reflections suggested gentleness, others demanded apology, but the echoes also carried the seaworthy truth that defiance need not be violence but a stubborn flare kept alight. <words>296</words>
His tactic was calculated wilderness, equal parts map and raw edge, walking corridors like cliff faces while his heart catalogued every slight and every possible mercy. <words>322</words>
Deliberately accidental choices led him to a pane that showed a younger self with eyes like a lantern, and he deliberately let the rope coil fall open so it could suggest escape without dramatizing guilt. <words>357</words>
The frayed coil of rope from a prison escape lay like testimony in his palms while he listened to echoes that insisted the world had already judged him, and he refused their verdict. <words>390</words>
He thought of captains who had chained themselves to protocol and of prisoners who unshackled themselves with cunning kindness, and he decided to become the border between compassion and rebellion. <words>420</words>
So he stood guard, coil in hand, letting strange cosmic echoes polish him like salt while the orchard cat dozed. <words>440</words>
