<story>
A groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard during the lull in a protest when voices gather again, feeling absurdly important. <words>22</words>
He carried a piece of a broken mirror like a fragile diploma, its jagged edge reflecting lamplight and his own double-take. <words>43</words>
Under a sky that smelled of damp pamphlets he decided to initiate a ritual that felt half sincere and half theatrical. <words>64</words>
The plan was uniquely generic in its symbolism, a deliberately ordinary script for extraordinary nights. <words>79</words>
His motive was not fame but to become a living embodiment of one's values, and he said the phrase aloud as if testing its fit. <words>104</words>
Around him the haunted mansion graveyard hummed like an audience of headstones, the ivy-stitched tombs listening with polite indifference. <words>123</words>
He was groggy from sleepless brewing nights and the tobacco breath of solidarity chants, but resolve tightened his hands. <words>142</words>
It was the encroaching darkness that set the stakes; not a cliche villain but a slow, social seep that dulled windows and promises. <words>165</words>
He realized the only way to begin was via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase, a minute bruise of color that looked like a map to tiny ghosts. <words>195</words>
He set the mirror shard so it caught that tiny stain, angling himself like a distracted caricature of a citizen hero. <words>216</words>
A lull in the nearby protest made his heart seem louder, and when voices gather again he would have to explain what he had done. <words>241</words>
He initiated the motion with a casual flick, the action trivial enough to be denied and earnest enough to seed change. <words>262</words>
The broken mirror's shard answered like a throat clearing, reflecting a fraction of the graveyard and a piece of his face that looked both weary and decorated with purpose. <words>291</words>
At first nothing happened; then the discoloration flared faintly and the air cooled as if conscience had turned down a window. <words>312</words>
That small change was the encroaching darkness gesturing, not with claws but with the gentle erasure of syllables and sidewalk promises. <words>333</words>
He laughed, flippant solemnity wrapped around his ribs like a sweater that did not quite warm him, and he thought of the brewery's faded manifesto tacked behind the taps. <words>362</words>
Becoming a living embodiment of one's values felt ridiculous and sanctified all at once as if he had chosen both costume and creed. <words>385</words>
Around him the dead seemed to lean in, not hostile but curious, and the protest's distant chanting threaded through like a metronome urging speeches and songs. <words>411</words>
