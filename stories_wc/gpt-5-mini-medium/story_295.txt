I am a jovial sellsword named Corin, boldly reluctant to settle, who chopped down doubt like bramble and kept laughing as he bled. <words>23</words>
He came to the witch's herb garden with an astronomical telescope under his arm, a strangely delicate instrument for a mercenary, because his family had a tradition of making a time capsule and he intended to bury treasure and memory therein. <words>64</words>
The withering vow that had sat like frost on his tongue since his father's dying whisper was simple: inherit the telescope, chart the old stars, and unmake the particular kind of fear that loosened his hands. <words>100</words>
Throughout the transformation of the garden at dusk, when basil and rue turned violet and the moon gave the soil a silvery shiver, Corin wrestled with being both eager and afraid. <words>131</words>
He was boldly reluctant: bold enough to step into spells, reluctant enough to ask for instructions, which made him both insufferable and lovable to the witch tending thyme and mandrake. <words>161</words>
She called herself Maela and wore star-shaped pins, and she approved of his laughter because it frightened the shadows of indecision from the garden. <words>185</words>
Maela set the telescope upon a knoll of mint and taught Corin to align lenses by the language of the weeds, saying that to see the heavens was to see the promise between generations. <words>219</words>
He would watch the stars transform as if the sky were a slow hand reshaping his resolve throughout the transformation, and each glint argued for courage. <words>245</words>
Every night Maela brewed tea that smelled of iron and old maps and told stories about the family tradition of making a time capsule, how ancestors packed doubts and vows and salted them against expiration. <words>280</words>
Corin confessed the withering vow had been his: to sell his sword and take roots, yet each time he tried the soil tightened like a fist and doubt sprouted anew. <words>310</words>
Maela handed him a brass tube and a scrap of vellum and said they would use the time capsule to betray his fear: the treasure was not gold but a sealed promise that might outlast the season of his cowardice. <words>350</words>
He wrote his vow with a quavering hand and folded it thrice, and for a moment the night whirled, thistles turning to bells, shadows laughing in an elegant mayhem that tousled his hair. <words>383</words>
Throughout the transformation his laughter changed; it became a weapon against the old echo that told him failing was certain, and he buried the tube under rosemary where roots wound like secrets. <words>415</words>
Days later the garden altered the telescope's glass until stars read as letters instructing him to open the family time capsule only when the withering vow had truly softened into purpose, and Corin felt doubt dethroned in a small crowning gesture. <words>456</words>
