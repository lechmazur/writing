<story>I walk the dogs of the ultra-rich past moonlit hedgerows, a dog walker by trade and an intruder by habit. <words>20</words>
It is when color bleeds from day into night that I find the mansion with a botanical collection humming like a secret, and I go there to stand where fear dares not tread. <words>53</words>
The dining room is haunted more by etiquette than ghosts, long table set with silver that reflects the sky and chairs that remember elbows. <words>77</words>
I am careful in a carefully careless way, leash wrapped twice around my wrist like a charm and my pockets full of excuses to justify a presence no invitation grants. <words>107</words>
Silent agreements hold the property together; the gardeners leave certain hedges untrimmed and the servants look away when the car arrives with strange passengers. <words>131</words>
Those agreements are loud in their silence, a covenant I nod to like a sentinel passing a torch, because the mansion tolerates only the cadence of its own hush. <words>160</words>
Tonight the dogs sniffed blue hydrangea and an atlas of fern fronds in the botanical collection as we crossed the dining room on our rounds and the wallpaper seemed to breathe. <words>191</words>
There had been an encounter at a blood drive earlier that afternoon, a quiet exchange of bandaged hands and stories about having given, which is how I learned the word that kept my pulse steady. <words>226</words>
They muttered consent without names, an economy of nods designed to explain nothing but to justify the smallest trespass as moral rent. <words>248</words>
I liked that notion; in the dining room, among porcelain skulls in the house collection and candle wax pooling like slow moons, the dogs lay down and I listened as silence amplified into something almost conversational. <words>284</words>
The owner had taught me to read those quiet windows between sentences: a creak, a glance, the way a servant straightens a napkin, and in return I learned where to place my foot when fear circled like a dog. <words>323</words>
Standing where fear dares not tread was not bravado so much as a vocation; each careful step justified another day's salary and another slender secret kept from prying heirs. <words>352</words>
I am carefully careless with my cigarettes - I let ash fall where a butler would not notice and I fold my coat over the botanical collection catalog as if to shield it, when really I am shielding myself. <words>391</words>
The loud silence arrives in moments: the scrape of a chair, the far laugh of someone who prefers anonymity, and the unmistakable shiver when a portrait follows you with its painted eyes. <words>423</words>
At dusk, after the blood drive's exchanged glances had proved their currency, I stood in that haunted dining room and justified my presence by stepping into the space between dread and duty, the dogs breathing against my calves like small confessors. <words>464</words>
I wanted to be where the house would not ask questions, to stand where fear dares not tread and to prove that silent agreements could be more binding than loud accusations. <words>495</words></story>
