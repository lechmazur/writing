Before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, the nectar collection facility wakes like a cathedral of glass and iron where a sentient doll collector tends shelves of stitched faces and porcelain limbs. <words>34</words>
She is expectantly resigned yet strangely purposeful, her painted gaze practiced to uphold ritual care for things that remember being loved and afraid. <words>57</words>
Her palms, stuffed with lint and compass dust, cradle a twisted carnival cane whose spiral remembers laughter and the sharpness of broken promises beneath fairground stars. <words>83</words>
She collects not only dolls but the ghosts of booths and games, arranging them along conveyors where vats drip nectar like slow prayers, the facility humming with an industry about to begin before the first mortal supplication. <words>120</words>
The chorus of healing is not sung with voices but with calibrated beats as syringes and petals align, and the collector listens as if to a choir only she can parse, translating its measures into shifts of light and the careful placement of a mittened wrist. <words>166</words>
She maps devotion by following star paths traced on the facility ceiling, constellations scorched by late technicians who believed cosmology could teach the machines gentleness. <words>191</words>
Her motivation is kinetic and impossible to ignoreâ€”she must stride through boundaries once thought sacred, to carry a rope between sanctum and factory, to test whether the old taboos will bend or crack under careful, dollish hands. <words>228</words>
The tone of her work is ethereal grit: varnish-stained fingertips humming lullabies while gears grind, the collector's expectant resignation folding into stubborn courage as she upholds a covenant older than inventory lists. <words>260</words>
At intervals she taps the twisted carnival cane against humming vats to call fragments of song, and the cane answers with a memory of midway healing where cotton candy and bandages were braided into remedies. <words>295</words>
Before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, she aligns dolls to star coordinates, murmuring instructions that sound like sewing patterns and liturgies, weaving a chorus of healing from stitched seams and nectar-laden vials. <words>330</words>
She moves expectantly resigned yet with a stubborn cadence, pushing a cart through dew on metal floors toward the raw vats where the sweetest liquids sing in phosphor light. <words>359</words>
Her doll companions offer counsel in muffled clicks and the quiet clank of porcelain knees; they believe in her mission because she has taught them the grammar of crossing thresholds. <words>389</words>
When the first protocol hums its prelude she will, by following star paths, place the twisted carnival cane into a clear vat where reflections resolve into a doorway, and then she will step to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. <words>429</words>
She steps and the facility exhales; the chorus of healing blooms like a fossilized constellation, a sacrament unnamed by any tongue as she upholds the fragile bridge between sacred and manufactured. <words>460</words>
