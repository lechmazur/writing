<story>The ambivalent prophet lived in a lunar mining colony where dust sang between the rails like a lullaby for machines. <words>20</words>
He kept a cracked collection of marbles in a dented tin, handling them with a happily sad smile as if each sphere remembered an ocean it would never see. <words>49</words>
Between heartbeats he defragmented memory like scrambled light, coaxing fragments together through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box from a long-dead Earth vendor. <words>75</words>
His motive was simple and slightly obscene: to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, to rearrange fortunes with a bashful arrogance that made the miners laugh and then look away. <words>103</words>
He swore the final oath in a whisper so small it fit between heartbeats, promising both revolt and mercy as if neither would suffice alone. <words>128</words>
Ambivalence was his creed; he believed omens and dismissed them with equal care, a prophet who loved prophecy and feared its consequences with a happily sad devotion. <words>155</words>
He used the cracked marbles as counters, rolling them across the jigsaw edges to map outcomes like constellations collapsing and reassembling under a child's slow hand. <words>181</words>
Each placement was a defragmenting, a modest algorithm enacted by fingers callused from sifting ore and pages of fortune; each click reset probabilities that otherwise trudged like debtors. <words>209</words>
The lunar mining colony hummed around him with fluorescent patience, drillers and data clerks more interested in schedules than the rearrangement of fate. <words>232</words>
When he announced minor results with an embarrassed chest-thrust, the bashful arrogance sounded like prophecy tagged as a hobby and everyone pretended surprised interest. <words>256</words>
The scoreboard governed contracts and kinship ties, who ate synthetica and who kept a room with a window, so scrambling it was less vandalism than a strange civic kindness. <words>285</words>
He had found the jigsaw edges in a rummage sale box by the recycler, strips of cardboard printed with impossible landscapes that fit where his marbles would land. <words>313</words>
He understood the irony, a happily sad satisfaction that some balances could be nudged without anyone writing thank you notes, and he preferred it that way. <words>339</words>
Miracles, if they were real, happened between heartbeats in his hands: a marble shifted, a credit line blinked, a child's name moved up one rung and the colony did not collapse. <words>370</words>
Finally he sealed the ritual with the final oath, speaking to cracked glass and cardboard edges that he would scramble the scoreboard until fairness and mischief braided like twin filaments. <words>400</words></story>
