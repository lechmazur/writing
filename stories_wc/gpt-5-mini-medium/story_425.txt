<story>
After the last star is named, a morose paladin waits alone at the solar flare observatory, his cape an oddly lavishly austere drape that promises ceremony but permits no vanity. <words>30</words>
He holds a dull sewing needle like a relic, its unremarkable edge reminding him of delicate circuits and the ancient systems he is here to restore with reluctant reverence. <words>59</words>
A city wide blackout arrives like a mute herald and a chance encounter during that darkness constrains his morning; a stranger bumps his sleeve, carrying a lantern that shows visible changes in the observatory's glass. <words>94</words>
They speak with bored excitement, trading technical superstitions and old maintenance rites as if gossip, and in the conversation he learns that their fleeting touch can confine wandering current into damaged conduits. <words>126</words>
He is morose because the stars were catalogued and named long ago, leaving rituals to memory, yet his eyes kindle with an annoyed hope at the idea of patching ancient arrays with a dull needle and human patience. <words>164</words>
The observatory itself is lavishly austere: brass instruments polished to patient dullness, naked conduits coiling like confessionals, and a single ornate console that refuses flourish but demands ceremonial input. <words>193</words>
During the blackout their chance encounter becomes method; he confines the stranger to the console, asking them to reroute a dying circuit while he gentles frayed wires with the needle, a laughably inadequate tool made sacred by necessity. <words>231</words>
Visible changes ripple along the instruments as small sparks stitch like constellations in miniature, and he feels each tiny restoration as if restoring a name to a star, consummating his reason to continue. <words>264</words>
The paladin's armor clinks with bored excitement, a paradoxical soundtrack to meticulous repairs, while outside the city murmurs and the blackout keeps citizens confined to candlelight and rumor. <words>292</words>
At last a restored hum returns through the observatory, ancient systems answering like old friends, and he understands that naming stars once was vanity but restoring their mechanisms is devotion; the dull sewing needle has become a key. <words>330</words>
He feels a visible change in himself too, the morose edge softened as purpose floods him; repairing circuits is a slow liturgy and his boredom sharpens into a delighted precision that tastes like duty and mischief. <words>366</words>
When the stranger leaves, the paladin confines the observatory's doors and watches their silhouette recede, knowing the chance encounter during the city wide blackout has seeded the uneasy hope that will drive him to restore whole systems long thought dead. <words>406</words>
