<story>The morbid juggler arrived in an abandoned laboratory filled with experiments, carrying a bent ruler like a relic and a smile that did not belong to any funeral. <words>28</words>
He moved with a consistently strange grace, fingers ready to clamp each volatile thought into order while vials hummed and jarred contraptions watched. <words>51</words>
Twisting traditions had been his craft long before the lab became a mausoleum of theories, and tonight he intended to bend ritual as deftly as the ruler in his hand. <words>81</words>
He worked via the scent of rare spices that still lingered in a cracked mortar, reading memory like a map and resonating recipes into the dust of experiments that never learned to die. <words>114</words>
His motive was blunt and oddly tender: to laugh last at the cosmic punchline, to let the universe know a joke at its expense would not go unanswered. <words>142</words>
Around him spilling shelves of aborted hypotheses and skeletonized automata seemed to inhale impatience as he set up his act. <words>162</words>
He juggled not only knives and formaldehyde jars but also ideas, flipping superstition into satire, past sorrow into sharp comic timing, each toss a small revolution. <words>188</words>
Between two ruined centrifuges he processed grief like a recipe, measuring tears with the bent ruler, a gesture that suited both mockery and mercy. <words>212</words>
A childlike empathy glowed in his ribs, defiant compassion that refused to let cruelty have the last line. <words>230</words>
Someone once taught him to clamp a wound shut with humor before stitching truth into it, and the memory clicked like a gear among rusted notes. <words>256</words>
In that cramped span, within the span of a shared smile, time compressed, donors of courage passing a tiny baton of rebellion from one breath to the next. <words>284</words>
A nested experiment whistled like a kettle and released saffron air; via the scent of rare spices the juggler coaxed an old formula to cough its punchline. <words>311</words>
He had always been consistently strange in the way he mixed solemnity with silliness, a habit that made colleagues uneasy and memories stubborn. <words>334</words>
Tonight, as light from a broken spectrometer painted the tiles in jaundiced bands, he tilted the bent ruler and let it ring like a confession. <words>359</words>
The experiments, abandoned and anthropomorphized by years of attention, answered in sympathetic tremors, vials clinking like an audience on cue. <words>379</words>
He told a story in tosses about ritual priests who braided their hair with labelling tape, about a council who decided pity was a bureaucratic error. <words>405</words>
A little laugh escaped him, small and sharp, designed to clamp despair with a smile so that it could be examined and learned from. <words>429</words>
When the final toss arced and landed in his palm the lab breathed as one organism, and he felt, with defiant compassion, that he had made the cosmos grin before the joke folded. <words>462</words></story>
