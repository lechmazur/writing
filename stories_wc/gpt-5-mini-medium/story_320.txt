<story>
A shy diviner named Lale drifted through the forgotten underwater city market like a ghost bargain hunter, palms cold against the beads of a stall while her heart measured tides of possibilities. <words>32</words>
She kept a stack of vintage photographs wrapped in oilskin, images of streetlamps and laughing faces that belonged to other lives and other currents, and she consulted them as if the silvered pictures might answer future questions. <words>69</words>
Her gift was confusingly clear: when she stared at a photograph the echo of regret in its grain hummed in her bones and offered coordinates that were always slightly bent toward sorrow. <words>101</words>
Lale was shy, and so she performed divinations under the indifferent chandeliers of sunken awnings, speaking to fish and lanterns and answering for a market that had forgotten how to ask. <words>132</words>
Her motivation was precise and strange: to right a cosmic imbalance she felt like a blemish on a ledger, to precipitate a correction so that timeline currents might realign and not drown certain names again. <words>167</words>
She discovered the method accidentally: a trail of social media posts that bobbed through parallel timelines, identical captions timestamped differently, each post a breadcrumb left by versions of herself who refused to forget. <words>200</words>
Across those timelines the posts behaved like market stalls, one seller hawking regrets, another offering remedies, and one account shared a photograph of a child holding a lantern beneath a statue submerged but perfectly framed. <words>235</words>
Each identical caption choked with a single instructive line, telling her to meet coordinates at noon, though noon rippled differently depending on which version of night had written the text. <words>265</words>
She followed them like a nervous ritual, posting nothing herself but reading screenshots and comments from shadow accounts, the social trail pulling her past stalls where voices bartered apologies and bargains for memory. <words>298</words>
In one parallel timeline a vendor recognized her and handed over a vintage photograph for free; in another he demanded a confession and accepted silence as payment, the variations stacking until the market ledger hummed. <words>333</words>
The photograph was confusingly clear to her even before she knew why: a child with seaweed in their hair stared with a familiarity that tugged at some ledger line in her soul, and the echo of regret answered like a distant bell. <words>375</words>
She wanted passionately to repair the imbalance, but she tended toward dispassionate gestures, arranging photographs on a wet table without theatrics, touching each image as if the smallest index finger could precipitate a tidal apology across all timelines. <words>413</words>
Her passionate disinterest was a pact: act with devotion but wear the bored face of someone who refuses to be admired, because vanity would tip the cosmic scale back toward catastrophe. <words>444</words>
At the climax she threaded a photograph through a bronze ring beneath a fallen stall, posted a single anonymous update on three accounts, and watched the market's water hold its breath as timelines shifted and names were returned to their proper ledgers. <words>486</words>
