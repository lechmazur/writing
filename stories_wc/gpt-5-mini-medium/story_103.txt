Within the mirrored reflection of a storm-tossed sea the weatherbeaten knight stood inside a lighthouse prison off a jagged reef, his armor dulled by salt and an old, grudgingly sweet smile at the corner of his mouth. <words>37</words>
He had been sentenced to a penance not of chains but of choices impossible to reconcile, each one ringing like the brass door knocker at the cell door that he once refused to lift. <words>71</words>
Within the mirrored reflection the knight watched himself make impossible choices as if they were puzzles presented by waves, a cruel method consisting of a set of seemingly random items that form a pattern only visible when you hold them up to the light. <words>115</words>
He had learned to appreciate the small certainties—the alignment of a seashell, a rusted cog, a torn playing card—arranged on a battered table that his fellow prisoners kept like an offering and like a map. <words>150</words>
Each item appeared random to the gulls above but to him the pattern was a sentence in a language of regret and remedy, a grudgingly sweet grammar that taught him how to hush the final cry of regret before it escaped into the cliffs. <words>194</words>
The prison keeper was a mirror that showed not who you were but the immediate future of every choice, and inside that silvered glass the knight saw himself turning the brass door knocker three times or letting it lie, each action splintering into consequences. <words>238</words>
Joyful agony sat in his ribs as he weighed the sound that might release a wail from neighboring cells or seal it forever; he liked the ringing like a child likes thunder, both necessary and terrifying. <words>274</words>
He thought of the set of items again and how arranging them differently had once saved a man from a madness of memory, so he tested sequences in the reflection the way a musician fingers a fragile tune. <words>312</words>
The impossible choices multiplied like tidepools, each demanding that he appreciate what he would lose to gain what he could not fully name, and every surrender tasted bittersweet though his smile remained stubbornly, grudgingly sweet. <words>347</words>
A gull dropped a torn map onto the ledge and in the mirror he saw the brass knocker fall and strike in the same cadence as the pattern of items, the seashell clicking the cog, the card fluttering to a letter he had tried to burn years ago. <words>395</words>
He realized then that his motive was not punishment but mercy; to hush the final cry of regret he must choose the action that would free others from listening to his own remorse, even if that meant locking himself inside a silence made of light. <words>440</words>
He lifted the knocker with hands that smelled of tar and memory, and in the mirror the light folded around him like a vow. <words>464</words>
When the sound came it was a joyful agony that settled reef, prison and shadowed life beyond, and he understood that some impossible choices are prayers formed from a pattern of small, random things. <words>498</words>
