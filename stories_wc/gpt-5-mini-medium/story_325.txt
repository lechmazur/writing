At intermission in a high altitude tea house, a mad botanist consulted her carnivorous plants as if they could translate wind. <words>21</words>
She wore a worn-out leather belt that cinched a coat smelling faintly of compost and peppermint. <words>37</words>
The clientele sipped steaming cups and murmured about unexplained phenomena beyond the glass, where clouds gathered like secretive witnesses. <words>56</words>
Her expression was comically serious, a gravity that made the teacups feel silly and the plants feel essential. <words>74</words>
During intermission, the projector hummed and the house dimmed, and she unspooled a black-and-white film reel with hidden sections fanning like secret leaves. <words>97</words>
Through those hidden sections she believed the film would ionize the thin air and reveal ancient pathways that once stitched mountain to mountain. <words>120</words>
Her motivation pulsed like a seed: to find ancient pathways lost under glacier dust and bureaucratic maps, to reweave travel lines with botanic intuition. <words>144</words>
She tapped the reel against the belt buckle, a comically precise ritual that registered as both superstition and method. <words>163</words>
Outside the house at altitude, gusts carried papers like migrating birds and the plants leaned toward the window, hungry for direction. <words>184</words>
A fickle loyalty wavered between her and a particular sundew that sometimes fed her not with flies but with inked clues from the film itself. <words>209</words>
The projectionist, bemused, permitted her an extra loop during intermission because the tea house believed in odd patrons and the spectacle of wondering. <words>232</words>
When frames with hidden sections flickered, a pale corona shimmered across the ceiling like a compass and the plants quivered as if translated. <words>255</words>
Spectators leaned, cups suspended, while she, comically serious, adjusted the belt with a decisive tug and whispered an incantation half botanical, half directional. <words>278</words>
Ionize, she murmured, not fully understanding how a film could charge atoms but trusting that the hidden frames were small machines of memory. <words>301</words>
The sundew's tentacles glowed, tiny droplets catching the corona, and a map of faint cracks and ridgelines ghosted on the pane as if some old geology had sent a postcard. <words>331</words>
Her fickle loyalty tilted toward the map and away from the audience, and she pocketed a torn frame behind the belt where the leather was thinnest. <words>357</words>
Outside the tea house, unexplained phenomena gathered like a small congregation: lights that walked, footprints that vanished, and a whispering frost. <words>378</words>
She wanted ancient pathways not for glory but to rethread a fickle loyalty between ruin and renewal, to let the plants remember routes of sunlight and soil. <words>405</words>
