<story>
The somnambulist scout arrives at the family's ancestral house on a wingless layover between flights, a pilgrim who navigates sleep and wake with the same steady hands. <words>27</words>
He is unapologetically humble, not because he hides accomplishment but because he prefers the quiet labor of mapping what cannot be announced. <words>49</words>
Tonight the pilgrimage is a yearly ritual, a methodical trudge that stitches his scout's uniform into family memory and draws him back toward a cellar that has sunk beneath the hill. <words>80</words>
Below the oak and its root-tangled stories lies the sunken laboratory, its windows water-dark, its instruments speaking in the hush of moss and half-forgotten solvents. <words>105</words>
He scouts the thresholds as if they might change form, walking with a folded map of constellations and a bottled lightning bug collection that glows like captured questions. <words>133</words>
Between flights he has learned to measure minutes differently, savoring the slow economy of hallways and the sudden generosity of staircases that lead down instead of up, as if the world saves secrets for those who have patience. <words>171</words>
The bottled lightning bugs cast errant constellations across rusted metal and algae, tiny oracles that blink answers when he presses his palm against glass and asks about woodland secrets. <words>200</words>
He is a scout by trade, but also a somnambulist by habit, mapping trails in sleep and tracing gradients of meaning between waking hours like one who annotates a map while dreaming of rivers. <words>234</words>
This humility shapes his method; he does not catalogue to conquer but to translate, piling soft observances into a topology that can carry spiritual wisdom back to those who will listen. <words>265</words>
In the laboratory's drowned half he finds diagrams carved into tile, marginalia of a family's ancestors who practiced quiet alchemy, and he reads them as a scout reads a trail: for patterns, for promise, for pain. <words>301</words>
A moth flutters where light meets dark and he, in his sleep-practiced grace, traces its flight with bottled light, thinking of how to map the small moral geographies the house hides. <words>332</words>
Loaded curiosity propels him, a weight that makes him gentle rather than frantic, urging him to pry open a jar whose label reads only a faded name and a date tied to the pilgrimage's origin. <words>367</words>
A light scents the water and reveals a map he never knew he'd been building: translucent thread-lines between oak roots, between the lab and the attic, between ancestor and child, annotated by small glowing insects. <words>402</words>
He charts not lines of ownership but of care, the ways love repaired glass, the nights a parent submerged hand to shore a broken instrument, and he marks each with a whisper so tender the jars seem to remember. <words>441</words>
Between flights he will carry this map outward like a folded prayer, delivering wisdom to scouts and strangers at hostel kitchens and airport benches, translating woodland secrets into paths people can follow without ceremony. <words>475</words>
On the last step up from the lab he pauses, blink-true despite sleep habit, smiling because humility proved the pilgrimage's true compass. <words>497</words>
