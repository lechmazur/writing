After the end of storytelling, the softhearted champion sat in the fluorescent hush of the cyberpunk city police station and listened to the hum of machines that pretended to remember people's names. <words>32</words>
He was called a champion because he carried a battered plain brown belt buckle on the thin leather of his uniform, and that buckle had outlived policies, precincts, and a dozen promotions. <words>64</words>
People in the station joked that its plainness made it unremarkable, but he treated it like a talisman and sometimes polished it till the metal sang under his thumb. <words>93</words>
His work at the station was to stabilize reports of small uncanny events that leaked from the neon districts into the paperwork, an unglamorous duty he performed with a consistently organic patience that baffled newer, algorithmic colleagues. <words>130</words>
He believed fate could be unraveled, not killed, and he had grown convinced that the city's misaligned destinies could be nudged back toward coherence with soft hands and rituals rather than brute data overwrites. <words>164</words>
After hours he made midnight visits to a shuttered planetarium where dust settled in diagrams of constellations, and there he watched the mechanical projectors like congregants watching an old liturgy. <words>194</words>
Those visits were methodical and quiet, part therapy, part engineering, and his presence after midnight recalibrated the air itself until the planetarium hummed with a muted euphoria he could translate into small administrative corrections. <words>228</words>
He thought of unraveling fate as unweaving frayed narrative threads that snagged citizens in loops and tangles, then stabilizing them with an intuitively organic touch that accepted not every loose end but the possibility of redirection. <words>264</words>
On a screenless night he clipped the plain brown belt buckle into place, felt its cool weight, and imagined the planetarium's projected curves etching a new cosmic signature into the city's quiet mathematics. <words>297</words>
He was softhearted but also deliberate, and he understood that to etch a new cosmic signature required tiny legal adjustments at the station, gentle memos, reassigned patrols, a slip of procedure that would reroute a life by inches rather than force. <words>338</words>
Sometimes he filed false leads that led predators into surveillance instead of vulnerable alleys, sometimes he altered schedules so two strangers would cross paths and form an alliance, and sometimes he simply left a note that stopped a revenge. <words>377</words>
His colleagues rarely saw the pattern, and the precinct's scanners cataloged incidents as statistical blips while he kept tending the organically flowing feedback loops between policy and human habit. <words>406</words>
The work had a muted euphoria, an ache of hope that hummed under the fluorescent lights and in the planetarium's dust motes at midnight, and he loved people with a tenderness that made his interventions small and respectful. <words>444</words>
One winter dawn a case file arrived with coordinates that matched a recurring knot, and he realized that unraveling fate sometimes demanded he risk being found out, to stabilize a family from perpetual loss. <words>478</words>
That night he returned to the shuttered planetarium, set the plain brown belt buckle as compass, then let consistently organic forces guide. <words>500</words>
