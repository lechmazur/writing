<story>
An uncertain druid dozed at the counter of a hologram repair shop while the library across the street kept its brass clock and quiet patrons until closing. <words>27</words>
He carried a dented lunch tin like a relic and opened it sometimes to arrange single dried petals as if composing an altar to mayhem. <words>52</words>
His motivation was simple and strange: to forge beauty from anarchy, a mission that made his limbs slack with lethargic excitement. <words>73</words>
During library hours he wandered through panels of streetlight into back alleys where experimental troupes held back-alley theater auditions and the air tasted of greasepaint and ozone. <words>100</words>
He moved like a resigned sapling, compelled by ties of obligation to listen and judge, bound to a community that leaned on him because he once healed the city fountain. <words>130</words>
The druid was uncertain about rituals and sure about small kindnesses, his competence being uniquely common, a paradox that made him useful and overlooked. <words>154</words>
He wandered the alley routes with a slow grin and a practiced half-listen, letting auditions filter through like snowflakes into his worn ear. <words>177</words>
Inside the repair shop fluorescents hummed, holo-projectors whirred, and the proprietor, an ex-architect who bred tiny mechanical ferns, kept time with a teacup. <words>200</words>
The druid offered his dented lunch tin as a payment of intent more than coin, inside it a folded scrap of paper that said live messy beloved in block letters. <words>230</words>
He mended hologram seams with herbal recipes and sideways prayers, coaxing glitch-flowers to bloom on cracked projection domes, a lullaby for analog ghosts. <words>253</words>
Performers from the auditions drifted in, dragging costumes smelling faintly of mildew and hope, each seeking an honest shimmer to patch their scenes. <words>276</words>
He confessed to them in low tones that he could not command order, only arrange fragments into gestures that suggested meaning, and they listened because obligation ties are contagious. <words>305</words>
Throughout library hours the druid drifted back and forth between stacks and soldering stations, each trip stretching an elastic promise to neighbors and actors. <words>329</words>
His uncertainty became an asset on nights when anarchy spilled like paint and his duty, taut as vine, braided the chaos into something graceful enough to stand. <words>356</words>
Sometimes he would hand a performer a dried petal from his tin and say make it louder until they made it, turning disorder into a chorus without prescriptions. <words>384</words>
The uniquely common ritual of sharing small, imperfect objects became a grammar, and the repair shop flickered with performances that were half experiment, half village feast. <words>410</words>
By the end of library hours the druid sat cross-legged by a projector, tin open, petals scattered like punctuation, feeling oddly satisfied and lazily electric. <words>435</words>
He realized that ties of obligation were not chains but rough threads that could be woven into theater, repair, and a neighborhood that preferred beautiful messes to tidy emptiness. <words>464</words>
In the slow hush after closing he rose, slung the dented lunch tin against his hip, and wandered toward the stacks like someone going home with the vague pride of a caretaker. <words>496</words>
