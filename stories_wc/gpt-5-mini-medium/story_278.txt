The brooding sculptor stood at the edge of the impact crater research base, palms rough from clay and hands trembling like a confession. <words>23</words>
He had come as a technician but carried the air of someone who had been summoned by the weathered stone of other people's obligations. <words>47</words>
A pair of vintage reading glasses hung from his collar, lenses smudged with fingerprints and tiny flecks of comet dust from previous nights of carving. <words>72</words>
Around him the base murmured with webs of intrigue, laboratory doors half closed, grey-suited administrators whispering about funding and forbidden samples. <words>93</words>
He listened with a murky tenderness, cataloguing loyalties like fossils and feeling the neat filaments of complicity wrap themselves around his ankles. <words>115</words>
The plan was theoretically spontaneous, a paradox he repeated to himself in the mirror when he adjusted the vintage reading glasses and smoothed the line of his jaw. <words>143</words>
Amid car washing in the dusty garage bay he watched colleagues rinse mottled rover panels, soap suds catching like miniature galaxies in the sun. <words>167</words>
He timed his disappearance for noon, when a single sunbeam elected to pierce the lab's grimy window and set motes to dancing. <words>189</words>
It was ridiculous and perfect, theoretically spontaneous and rehearsed in the slow motions of his hands as he carved away someone else's initials from a clay form. <words>216</words>
The webs of intrigue tightened that morning when a supervisor intercepted an old message about reassigned duties, and the base's social currents thickened like sludge. <words>241</words>
He felt servitude as a pressure under his ribs, a fossilized contract that he had learned to read through the scratch of his vintage reading glasses. <words>267</words>
His motive was elemental: to escape a life of servitude that smelled faintly of lab bleach and old coffee, and to carve a self from the white silence of the impact scar. <words>299</words>
He moved through protocols like a man reciting lines to a play he no longer believed in, passing biometric scans with a smile he practiced in mirrors. <words>326</words>
At the appointed minute the sunbeam fell through the garage window and made a small theater on the hood of a dirty rover, and dust began its patient choreography. <words>355</words>
He took off the vintage reading glasses and placed them on the hood, a sacrament of vision and a signal to himself that the old addresses no longer fit. <words>384</words>
Then he breathed, a small gesture, and the motes cut a path through the light as if someone had plucked invisible strings, and his outline blurred. <words>410</words>
To colleagues it looked like a trick of tired brains and halation, but the truth was tender and cunning: he let himself disappear via the dance of dust in a sunbeam. <words>441</words>
The vintage reading glasses remained, a quiet accusation and a map for anyone who might care to follow, lenses catching the base's low light like relic windows. <words>468</words>
He had not unmade the webs of intrigue but had chosen a seam through them, where his hands could still shape breath and stone and make a life briefly his. <words>498</words>
