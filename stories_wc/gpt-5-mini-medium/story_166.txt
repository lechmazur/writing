<story>After the last wish is granted, the ghostly caretaker wanders the frozen orchard that drinks from geothermal streams. <words>18</words>
He moves with a solemnly silly step, a teasing decorum that unsettles roots and rime alike. <words>34</words>
His goal is strange and tender: to communicate with animals by weaving through fate, following lines of future and memory braided into the orchard's sap. <words>59</words>
He carries a single plastic straw, absurd in the cold, which he uses like a conductor's baton to shape whispers along branches. <words>81</words>
When he perforates a frozen leaf with that needle of plastic, the latticed wound sings a little and the steam from below threads its scents through the orchard. <words>109</words>
It is a gentle act and a chaotic one, a puncture that stitches new directions into the shared map of fate. <words>130</words>
He learned to perforate like a poet through forbidden expedition logs he read in the attic of the last wisher, each brittle page annotated with animals' names and impossible coordinates. <words>160</words>
Those logs taught him scales of listening, mapmaking by ear, and how to thread a straw through bark to coax a fox's memory or a raven's joke. <words>187</words>
At night the trees lean closer, curious of the caretaker's solemnly silly rituals, and the geothermal breath fogs tiny stories into the air. <words>210</words>
He speaks with a voice that sounds half like a lullaby and half like a ledger being balanced, confessing names from the logs and asking small favors on behalf of the animals. <words>242</words>
Sometimes a marmot answers by tapping an old irrigation pipe, sometimes a goose arranges the steam in rude diagrams, and sometimes silence replies with an animal's slow assent. <words>270</words>
He keeps each response catalogued through forbidden expedition logs, perforating the paper with the same plastic straw to mark cadence, to score what he hears. <words>295</words>
There is a solemn gravity to his work, yet it is also absurd: he is an invisible gardener conversing with geese and beetles in an orchard that should be sterile and dead. <words>327</words>
After the last wish is granted, wishes no longer govern the world, so his duties are quieter, devoted to conversation rather than miracles. <words>350</words>
Yet fate still needs tending; the orchard's roots tangle toward possible futures and he must weave through them like a seamstress mending a map. <words>374</words>
One morning a badger comes with a wound that smells of iron and regret, and the caretaker perforates the air with a careful straw-stab to let the badger speak its want. <words>405</words>
The badger tells him where a buried kit glows and what the river will forget, and he writes it into the forbidden expedition logs, perforating another hole to match the cadence of the tale. <words>439</words>
In that way he weaves through fate - one careful puncture, one catalogued answer - until the orchard, the animals, and the geothermal murmurs all speak in a chorus that is almost deliberate and entirely accidental. <words>471</words>
