After the last breath of a dying god, an apathetic summoner sat cross legged in a shared dream recording studio and watched the residue of divinity cool like milk on a black stone. <words>33</words>
He was enthusiastically lazy about everything but intention, which meant he could conjure complex rituals while yawning and fold whole climates into a pocket shirt without the usual grim thrust of zeal. <words>65</words>
He kept a rustic coffee grinder on a shelf of whispered microphones, turning its wooden crank like a metronome for memory while he listened for river wisdom in the static, because he believed that currents taught how to reweave coral reefs. <words>106</words>
The plan would unfold through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall where recordings of other people's nights echoed like shells, and he traced fingerprints of tides in the dust between panes. <words>139</words>
Each empty frame was a synchronized aperture in the shared dream recording studio, a place where footage of impossibilities pooled and taught the apathetic summoner that reconstruction begins with accurate listening to what absence says. <words>174</words>
With a gentle sharpness he scraped the grinder's handle until its rhythm matched river wisdom, imagining currents as teachers and coffee grounds as sediment maps that could be rearranged to seed new polyps. <words>207</words>
He remained unapologetically enthusiastically lazy, composing plans in drowsy half-steps because the effort of fervor tired him and because slow, patient circuits were the ones that lasted underwater. <words>235</words>
When he set two frames opposite one another, the emptiness between them unfolded into a channel where memories of reefs and river mouths braided, and he recorded the braided light onto lacquer discs. <words>268</words>
He played those discs back through microphones hung like lanterns in the deserted hall, aligning frames until their silent pictures beat together and made a tide that could carry powdered coral and microbial instructions. <words>302</words>
After the dying god's last breath the ocean had hummed a different hymn, and he felt duty like a resigned tide pulling him to rebuild coral reefs as both restitution and apology for a god's silence. <words>338</words>
He taught fishermen whose dreams came in for studio sessions to whisper to seedlings, translating river wisdom into lullabies that hardened into skeletal scaffolds when sung under moonlight, and he marked each success with a grateful, lazy smile. <words>376</words>
At dawn he cranked the rustic coffee grinder once more, scattering the smell of spent beans like a promise, and as matching empty frames in the deserted hall caught that scent the shared dream studio pulsed, motifs unfolded into coral architectures, and river wisdom braided with human laziness into patient reefs that would outlast both gods and their last breaths. <words>436</words>
