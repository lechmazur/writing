<story>An exiled prince waited alone in the abandoned customs office, his presence both familiar and unknown as a sudden snowstorm rattled the corrugated shutters. <words>24</words>
He clutched an antique mortar and pestle that had been his mother's, a small domestic reliquary that smelled faintly of thyme and old coin. <words>48</words>
Outside the storm had produced the chance encounter he had not expected: a stranger blown into the doorway and calling for shelter, their boot prints carving a map in the drifting snow. <words>80</words>
The timing was uncanny, for he had come at the exact hour during the turn of a key that locks away the past, to seal a ledger that bound him to duties he no longer wanted. <words>116</words>
When the stranger pushed inside, leaning on an umbrella like some accidental chapel, the prince felt unseen forces shift the air around them and remembered how loneliness had been his first exile. <words>148</words>
The stranger was small, with a laugh that made the office feel too intimate and yet strangely official, and their eyes somehow made the prince's stooped figure unintentionally iconic. <words>177</words>
They warmed their hands over a tin mug and asked, in a voice that sounded like a door half-open, whether he believed remedies could improve the hollows people carried. <words>206</words>
The prince laughed without mirth and admitted he sought a cure for loneliness, a selfish quest to make his exile into companionship by any means that the old rituals allowed. <words>236</words>
They exchanged, awkwardly but with urgency, the stories of displaced courtyards and customs ledgers until the prince unlatched the mortar and pestle and offered the stranger a spoon of its crushed, bitter compound. <words>269</words>
The herb was a recipe for memory-basil, bergamot, something older, and as the stranger tasted it the unseen forces in the room hummed like a chorus agreeing to a new covenant. <words>300</words>
Outside the key turned in the ancient lock, a final click that the ledger recorded as the official closing of a chapter, and for a suspended moment the past and present balanced on that small noisy hinge. <words>337</words>
The prince watched the stranger's face, seeing the weather and every exile he'd worn like garments, and felt an unexpected permission to improve the rites he had been given. <words>366</words>
He ground more of the bitter mix in the antique mortar, the pestle ringing on porcelain as if summoning a bell, and the sound made the stranger smile like a doorway opening to a house the prince did not remember. <words>406</words>
They spoke until the snow stopped, trading techniques for stitching back small hollows: a phrase, a song, a ritual crushing of past grudges into a powder that tasted like rain. <words>436</words>
When the key finished its final rotation, sealing the ledger and the office's official papers, the prince realized the cure for loneliness was not a draught but the permission to be known, to accept a shared winter as an antidote. <words>476</words></story>
