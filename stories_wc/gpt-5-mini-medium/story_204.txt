During the hush before an acceptance speech begins, a professional cuddler waits in an abandoned spaceport hangar beneath ceilings that remember liftoffs and lost goodbyes. <words>25</words>
He fingers a phantom train ticket punch, an ornate brass tool passed down from a relative who believed in puncturing time more than paper. <words>49</words>
Unspoken rules govern his work and his life, an unusually usual ledger of boundaries and rituals that keeps strangers comfortable and keeps his own heart respectable. <words>75</words>
Weeks earlier, a chance encounter at a farmer's market had planted a bruise of doubt in him when he learned a vendor with soil-stained hands thought cuddling was deceitful, a prejudice that smelled faintly of decay. <words>111</words>
Now, motivated to overcome that deep-seated prejudice, he fashions the ticket punch like a relic—an ancient novelty that chimes between empathy and ritual—as armor and apology. <words>137</words>
The hangar smells of ozone and old rust, scaffolds and couches scavenged into booths, and the hush holds the audience's attention in a way that makes memory feel like a tangible currency. <words>169</words>
He stands near the stage where an award waits, the hush before an acceptance speech beginning to solidify into a ceremony, when a woman appears from the shadows carrying a crate of heirloom tomatoes and a paper bag of questions. <words>209</words>
She recognizes the ticket punch in his palm and mentions the unspoken rules aloud, surprising him with a pragmatic reverence as though she had been tutored by the same invisible etiquette. <words>240</words>
Their conversation, spun between tomato stems and the whistle of distant ventilation, reveals that her father once owned a similar punch and that her distrust of intimate labor was born from a childhood where closeness was used as leverage. <words>279</words>
He taps the brass, each puncture imagined as forgiveness, each click obeying those unspoken rules he keeps—no promises, only presence—and explains how his craft is consent made tangible rather than a weapon. <words>311</words>
Her voice, roughened by years of marketplaces and practical skepticism, softens as she admits that what she thought unusually usual about professional cuddling was actually her fear of being seen as naive while her father's business decayed into huckstery. <words>350</words>
In the hush, with the abandoned hangar holding its breath like a cathedral of departures, he offers her the phantom punch and the explanation that unspoken rules are tools, not verdicts, and that rituals can repair rather than erase. <words>389</words>
She closes her fingers around the cool brass and feels the unusually usual weight of obligation tilt into a strange permission, a small ceremony that begins to mend the old prejudice in both their throats. <words>424</words>
As the first applause leaks through the hangar walls and the acceptance speech begins elsewhere, they bow to the unspoken rules together and step into a ritual that is neither performance nor proof but a chosen policy of care. <words>463</words>
