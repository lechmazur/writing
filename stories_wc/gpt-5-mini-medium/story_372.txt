He walked the ruined rooftops of the futuristic city slums as if they were a confession. <words>16</words>
The lovelorn spy moved with a curiously indifferent gait, cataloguing graffiti and broken neon as though distance could be measured in disappointments. <words>38</words>
He tasted the new recipe from the alley kitchen at the instant it finally arrived, a spoonful that tasted like both apology and prophecy. <words>62</words>
The flavor unlocked unfamiliar reflections in him—faces in puddles, ghost signs in mirrored glass, a past lover folding into the skyline—none of which he understood but all of which demanded motion. <words>93</words>
He had an unused sticky label in his pocket, blank and absurd, a tiny thing hoarding identity the way the slum hoarded necessity. <words>116</words>
The label felt like a possible name for the life he might claim if he could only outrun the unstoppable avalanche that thudded through city newsfeeds and alley whispers. <words>145</words>
He had learned to move fast in slums grown vertical and hungry; his method with another explorer had become a shared interest in urban exploration that stitched two histories into one breath. <words>177</words>
She, the other climber, tasted the same spoonful and paused like a film stuck between frames, then smiled with a slight, dangerous pity. <words>200</words>
They both understood that recipes were maps here, combinations of smoke and oil that could tell you where the city would break next. <words>223</words>
He felt curiously indifferent about love itself but obsessed with the puzzle of staying ahead of the collapse, a split that made him smaller and sharper at once. <words>251</words>
When sirens braided with falling concrete, the city's rumors of an avalanche solidified into a timbre you could taste in metal and spice. <words>274</words>
He wanted to gloat quietly over his survival like a petulant god, to lay the unused sticky label over some ruin and declare a small ownership, but love had taught him better than triumph. <words>308</words>
Instead he folded the label into a pocket of his jacket and let the other climber take the lead, a curiously indifferent concession that felt like destiny being written in the margins. <words>340</words>
They ran along scaffolds and half-lit catwalks discussing routes as if comparing flavors, their shared interest in urban exploration becoming the grammar of survival. <words>364</words>
At the instant the recipe finally tasted like home to both of them, the skyline folded, a distant shelf of buildings groaning and then starting to slide. <words>391</words>
He moved with the practiced nonchalance of someone who had loved and lost a dozen times, curiously indifferent outwardly while his heart hawked every beat like contraband. <words>418</words>
They scrambled, trading breath and coordinates, gloating only in the private calculus of escape when a ledge held against the slide and their boots found purchase. <words>444</words>
The avalanche was unstoppable but not absolute, and destiny in that rambling sense meant improvisation with a lover at your shoulder and an unused sticky label that might someday mean something else entirely. <words>477</words>
They sat tasting the recipe again in silence, city bones rearranging below, and he, lovelorn, allowed a quiet gloat. <words>496</words>
