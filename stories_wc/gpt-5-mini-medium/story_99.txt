<story>
The bookbinder lingered in the abandoned carnival prize booth like someone waiting for a chapter to finish itself. <words>18</words>
He was strictly casual about the dust on velvet stuffed bears and the way his telekinetic powers made faded tickets drift like bookmarks. <words>41</words>
His hands were clean but never idle, binding torn program pages into miniature sagas with thread and a single chopstick wrapper folded like a secret bookmark. <words>67</words>
He had a casual laugh and a strictly casual coat, a contradiction he cultivated because he believed that solemnity could frighten the legends he sought to revive. <words>94</words>
Across the tapestry of lost legends plastered on grease-stained walls and ticket stubs, he followed a conviction about the price of knowledge that was less a ledger and more a litany. <words>125</words>
He wanted to discover the power of transformation, and his motivation was an equal measure of hunger and gentle scholarship. <words>145</words>
At night the booth hummed inert but not silent, and sudden sound bites—a carousel bell, a squeal from a rusty clown horn, the crunch of a prize being opened—triggered flashbacks that sketched whole sagas in his mind. <words>182</words>
These sudden flashbacks triggered by sound bites revived not only images but the intent of stories, and he could feel them bleed into the paper and thread until books hummed under his touch. <words>215</words>
Revive was a small, dangerous command he never spoke aloud; instead his telekinesis coaxed tattered narratives into motion so that voices answered, dusty puppets bowed, and a prize rabbit mended its seam. <words>247</words>
Each revival demanded a price of knowledge, small at first—a memory, a line from a song—but across the tapestry of lost legends the debts accumulated into sacrificial catalogues he recorded with patient ink. <words>280</words>
Sometimes the booth demanded names; sometimes it wanted a childhood promise, and sometimes his own memory of being strictly casual with consequence was enough to pay and to learn. <words>309</words>
He recorded prices in margins, stitched tally marks into the spine, and felt the transformation he sought arrive as a slow alchemy where paper accepted the breath of myth and returned practical, secret machinery. <words>343</words>
A choir of creaks could revive a hero, a child's laugh could unstop a fountain of ink, and a single torn ticket cue unlocked a sequence that showed him how transformation had a grammar he could learn. <words>380</words>
But knowledge cost him forgetting: the more he learned to shape endings the less he remembered beginnings, and sometimes the price was a name that floated away like a prize balloon. <words>411</words>
He accepted the trade because to discover the power of transformation was also to risk vanishing into the stories he bound, which he now did with a craftsmen's reverence and a showman's restraint. <words>444</words>
In the last flashback a bell made him remember a father teaching a child to fold a chopstick wrapper into a bird and he levitated that fragile origami until inked wings remembered flight across the tapestry of lost legends. <words>483</words>
He smiled, a gesture of grandiose subtlety. <words>490</words>
