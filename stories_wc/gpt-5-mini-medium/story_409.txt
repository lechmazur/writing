At the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble, the bruised fighter wakes in a dusty attic filled with clockwork animals, and the world narrows to the smell of oil and the small metallic tick of precise ruin. <words>38</words>
He is skillfully incompetent at silence, tripping over memories with the studied clumsiness of someone used to bruises as punctuation. <words>58</words>
On a shelf a clay pot shard with an inscription leans among a tangle of windup foxes, its broken letters a map for stubborn hands. <words>83</words>
He reads the inscription aloud as if aloud could unstick what time has glued together, each sound a small oath that tastes like iron. <words>107</words>
The attic is an orchestra of interrupted lives, clockwork animals frozen mid-sway, their eyes like watch faces remembering the hands that once moved them. <words>131</words>
A small figure, not a person but a practice in posture, abducts his attention by shifting a shadow; the gesture is minimal and monstrous at the same time. <words>159</words>
Through forgotten dreams the attic breathes out fragments of earlier promises, and he is pulled toward a window that frames the first light of a day he does not yet have words to name. <words>193</words>
He remembers standing for something once, a lean honest posture that felt like a steadying rod in the mouth of chaos, but memory has been flayed by habit. <words>221</words>
The shard's inscription offers an imperative and a mirror: be whole in action, it seems to say, but his hands are skilled at cruelty and inept at gentleness. <words>249</words>
He moves because he is motivated to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, and movement tastes like confession. <words>267</words>
At the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble he thinks of the inevitability of form, of how a single bright cut reveals both talent and its opposite. <words>295</words>
The bruised fighter admires that honesty but knows his own practice is a parade of little refusals, skillful in theatrics and incompetent at the work of becoming. <words>322</words>
In the close distance of the attic he hears the clink of a clockwork sparrow aligning and feels the old lie - he could keep himself whole by denial - begin to tremble. <words>351</words>
He decides to abduct the certainty of his own excuses, to take them where they can no longer harm him, not with force but by naming them until they dissolve. <words>381</words>
Through forgotten dreams he threads questions into each tick and gear, and the animals answer with the small honest noises of machines that have learned to tell the truth. <words>410</words>
He lifts the clay pot shard with an inscription and traces the letters until meaning loosens like a key from rust. <words>431</words>
It is a small ceremony, an admission without a crowd, and as he speaks the words the last false stories about himself crack and fall away. <words>457</words>
At that instant, at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble, he feels the last vestige of self-deception go dark, and he bows to the honesty he had been too bruised to accept until now. <words>493</words>
