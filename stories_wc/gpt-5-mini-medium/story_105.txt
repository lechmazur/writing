<story>
An outcast scholar paused in the hush of a half-lit corridor and listened to the carpets overhead whisper. <words>18</words>
He had been living for years inside a witch's flying carpet garage where patched rugs landed like ships and neighbors traded engine oil for spells. <words>43</words>
The scholar was oddly called strangely trustworthy by a few desperate clients who said his silence held cures, and the epithet fit him like a second skin. <words>70</words>
He wanted, with a fierce and fragile intent, to prove that midnight only lasts so long and to teach the alley clocks to breathe again. <words>95</words>
On this night a jolt ran through his ribs when he found a seashell with a strange symbol tucked beneath a coil of carpet, its ridges like palmistry and its surface oddly reflective. <words>128</words>
He held it and saw not his face but a mirroring of the soul, small movements answering with calm insistence, so intimate it felt like a hand returning a secret. <words>158</words>
The effect was strange and immediately comforting; the shell was strangely trustworthy even as its image twisted memories he had kept like locked drawers. <words>182</words>
He remembered the diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom, pages scrawled with experiment and apology, the only method he'd used to teach himself to look away and then to look back. <words>216</words>
Those journals had mapped the nights when his own reflection had split into two duties: scholar and exile, and reading them felt like facing a distant sibling one loved but could not trust. <words>249</words>
In the hush of the corridor he pressed the shell to his ear and the carpet engines hummed like distant whales, and for a moment the frantic part of him stilled enough to listen. <words>283</words>
Then a small jolt of memory — a tile sliding, a damp hand passing a bundle — startled him and he staggered, grateful that his breathing remained soft and even. <words>313</words>
He had retrieved a diary that way years ago, via diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom, and the pages had taught him the grammar of patience. <words>342</words>
Now the mirroring shell offered another lesson: that the soul's reflection can be coaxed forward like a tired bird and that midnight only lasts so long if you keep making morning. <words>373</words>
He rummaged through the garage's stacked carpets with calm fingers, each woven layer a map of spells and old debts, his urgency gentle as prayer. <words>398</words>
Beneath a moth-eaten rug he unearthed an engine panel and the diary sealed inside, its margins annotated with a single instruction: trust the reflection and jolt the world awake. <words>427</words>
He laughed quietly, a sound like wind over parchment, and in that laugh the corridor warmed as if the carpets decided to answer. <words>450</words>
He stepped onto the nearest flying rug, placed the seashell on the seat as if offering communion, and felt a last peaceful jolt that rearranged his fear into resolve. <words>479</words>
Dawn threaded stained windows and he tilted the carpet, proving to the sleeping clocks that midnight ends. <words>496</words>
