<story>The arrogant swordsman stood in the calligraphy master's courtyard, cloak damp with evening mist, and watched the faded tapestry fragment flutter against a shutter like a moth with a secret.<words>30</words>
He moved with the confidence of someone born to rule a blade yet his steps were oddly tentative, doubtfully confident in a way that made the courtyard stones hold their breath.<words>61</words>
Between breaths he recalled how the tapestry fragment once hung whole over a hearth, a map of a clan's bright histories, its colors now stolen and its borders ragged like promises unkept.<words>93</words>
He had the arrogance to think that a single sword could authorize a return of those histories, as if the blade could sign a document with a notch and make lineage alive again.<words>126</words>
But his motive was tender in its way: he wanted to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out, a mission born not of vanity but of a lonely, stubborn hope.<words>158</words>
The calligraphy master watched from his bench, ink-smeared palms folded, as though he were a judge and a conspirator at once, allowing and appraising the swordsman's parade of bravado.<words>187</words>
He would authorize nothing rashly, and yet he hummed under his breath a traditional song sung at every family wedding, a melody that braided memory into the air and told the young to tend what elders had made.<words>225</words>
The song, unexpected from a master of strokes, tugged at the swordsman's arrogance and became a hinge; his confidence quivered, doubtfully confident now like steel warmed and nearly bending.<words>254</words>
Between breaths the courtyard seemed to compress time into a filament; the swordsman reached and touched the tapestry fragment with a finger that bore old scars, and the fragment shivered like a flag waking.<words>288</words>
He felt shackled potential uncoil inside him, as if years of practice and pride had been chained to a fear that now slackened a little under the master's song.<words>317</words>
Harsh tenderness braided his actions: he tested the edge, not to cut an enemy but to slice a hanging thread that would release a poem hidden at the tapestry's hem.<words>347</words>
The calligraphy master inclined his head, authorizing the small transgression, and the courtyard filled with the sound of ink and metal agreeing to speak a new sentence.<words>374</words>
Between breaths the tapestry yielded a sliver of text stitched in threads of silver that pulsed when exposed, and the swordsman read aloud with the ungainly grace of someone learning to give what he had hoarded.<words>410</words>
The lines promised nothing spectacular but a tiny covenant: kindle one light and others will find the ember, and for the first time the arrogant swordsman felt his role shift toward servant of a fragile flame.<words>446</words>
He authorized himself to be small, to place the fragment where a child might see it, and in that act the courtyard's shadows loosened as if someone had finally answered a long silence.<words>479</words></story>
