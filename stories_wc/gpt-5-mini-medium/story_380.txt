<story>
The convicted dream thief lived in a forgotten library inside a treehouse, cataloging echoes and paper moths. <words>17</words>
After the last human is born the world shivered into permanent lull and the thief kept a flimsy photo album beneath a beam like contraband and prayer. <words>44</words>
He was mathematically challenged and could never balance a ledger, which suited the library that never needed receipts. <words>62</words>
Inside the album were photographs of empty stadiums and a sequence of friends who shared a love for a certain sport, grinning midkick, midstride, midserve. <words>87</words>
He traced faces with a finger that remembered how to steal and how to give back in equal measure, because the thief had been convicted for pilfering sleep and slipping it into jars to sell to loneliness. <words>124</words>
The fragmented self within him answered in footnotes, a chorus of edges that argued over which memory belonged to which bone. <words>145</words>
Each persona kept a rule about thunder, some insisting it should be coaxed gently, others advocating the plunge of ritual and noise. <words>167</words>
He wanted to coax thunder from empty skies, to make the abandoned clouds grumble and spill, as if weather could be bribed by memory. <words>191</words>
At night he read by bioluminescent fungus and by the lamplight of a moth and rehearsed the complex arithmetic he could never master, counting breaths instead of numbers. <words>219</words>
The books agreed with ink sighs and the treehouse hummed like a throat, reminding him that after the last human is born there are no spectators to applause but memories appreciate a show. <words>252</words>
He would plunge into the hollows of old game tapes and manuscripts, soaking in recorded chants and rhythms from a shared love for a certain sport until his chest vibrated like thunderheads. <words>284</words>
Sometimes the fragmented self stitched itself with silly equations he recited aloud, miscounting goals and sets and overs, and laughing at the audacity of arithmetic. <words>309</words>
He kept the flimsy photo album under his pillow, turning pages to summon faces like charms, imagining each image as a drumbeat that might rouse the sky. <words>336</words>
In the library a wind that was really a memory stirred the shelves and the thief measured that sound with the wrong math, dividing silences into uneven fractions that pleased him. <words>367</words>
His mania was quiet enough to fit between pages, and yet rigorous, for coaxing thunder required ritual precision that his fragmented selves argued over like old teammates about strategy. <words>396</words>
When he finally plunged from the ladder that night, album clutched to his chest, he expected clouds to listen even if no human cheered. <words>420</words>
Instead there was a first small rumble, a polite curiosity of thunder that answered a thief who had become both accused and contrite, collector and choir. <words>446</words>
He felt the fragmented self consolidate into a single hand that closed the flimsy album and released the songs of a sport into the waiting sky. <words>472</words>
He cataloged the thunder like contraband in a ledger he could not balance, smiling with quiet mania at wonder. <words>491</words>
