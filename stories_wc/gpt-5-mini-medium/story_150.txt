In the glass ribs of the steampunk observatory dome an outlaw cowboy poet rehearsed his soliloquies to brass gears and drifting smoke. <words>22</words>
He wore a long coat stained with coffee and oil and kept a small satchel of worn runic bone dice against his ribs. <words>45</words>
The dice were talismans of uncertain measure, each pitted symbol promising choices that tethered strangers and stars into intertwined destinies. <words>65</words>
His methods were virtually peculiar, a mix of old outlaw swagger and laboratory precision, and he had a habit of trying to misalign fate's cogs. <words>90</words>
He did this in a way that baffled engineers and poets alike: by reading coffee shop walls that keep changing text, a ritual he claimed tuned him to the city's heartbeat. <words>121</words>
Throughout rehearsals he wandered between the iron ribs and the rehearsal stage, reciting lines that might rewire a mechanism or seed a rumor. <words>144</words>
The dome accepted his voice with the indifferent warmth of machinery, echoing both challenge and consolation in a tone of saturated ambivalence. <words>166</words>
A crowd of apprentices and ticketless dreamers watched, unsure whether to laugh or learn, drawn because curiosity is a contagion he wanted to spark into something unstoppable. <words>193</words>
He rolled the worn runic bone dice on brass when he needed a nudge, letting their ancient creaks rearrange probabilities like misfiring pistons. <words>216</words>
Once a mechanic swore a gear had shifted out of sympathy and a lover claimed a line he spoke later fit her life like a cuff, evidence of intertwined destinies or convenient coincidence. <words>249</words>
He never insisted on answers; his motives were complicated and almost theatrical, the outlaw cowboy poet more interested in ignition than resolution. <words>271</words>
His ambivalence saturated his gestures: when he smiled it hinted at mischief and farewell, and when he stared at the dome's brass compass he looked like a man both lost and found. <words>303</words>
During a midnight rehearsal the text on a coffee shop wall outside rearranged itself into an imperative that read, 'Misalign the atlas,' and he felt a smile that was neither virtue nor vice. <words>336</words>
He took the dice, rolled them across a map plate, and watched brass needles twitch as destinies shifted minutely, almost imperceptibly, like clockwork misaligned on purpose. <words>362</words>
Throughout rehearsals that season his performance became a calibration: the virtually peculiar ritual of reading mutable walls, the dice and his verses working to misalign expectations and kindle relentless wonder. <words>392</words>
At the final showing mechanical stars spun slowly above them and an apprentice cried because the poetry made her see her choices as threads braided into other lives. <words>420</words>
He left the dome with the dice and a pocket full of directions he did not intend to follow, pleased that curiosity was now contagious and unsettled by how it might misalign someone's whole map. <words>455</words>
He rode away in saturated ambivalence, an outlaw cowboy poet who had engineered a new grammar for fate and who believed that when lives touch and tangle, intertwined destinies begin as questions. <words>487</words>
