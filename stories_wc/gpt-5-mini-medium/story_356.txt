The wry caretaker stood in the space pirate ship cargo hold like an anchor of odd gravity, chalk dust on his knuckles and a softly amused frown. <words>27</words>
He was warmly aloof by habit, a caregiver who kept his distance so he could tend everything properly without getting tangled in crew dramas. <words>51</words>
A single piece of chalk sat behind his ear like a second compass, ready to mark hull seams, ration cycles, or the strange arc of passing nebulae. <words>78</words>
He used it most nights to draw the crude diagrams that helped him understand the core concept he had been arguing with for decades: the nature of time. <words>106</words>
The cargo hold itself was a patchwork cathedral of containers and ropes and sleeping mats, smelling faintly of oil and seaweed from a world they had raided months ago. <words>135</words>
Outside, cloud paths trailed across the viewport, ashen bands of gas and dust whose motions the caretaker learned like weather, and by tracking cloud paths he read when things would align. <words>166</words>
It was a method that sounded silly in the engine room, but it let him predict small gifts: a cargo bump, a stray salvage buoy, the exact hour a faded voice would die on line. <words>201</words>
So when, late and tinny, an outdated phone's dial tone cut out and left the line hanging like a question, he did not panic but he listened very closely. <words>230</words>
The sound had been the ship's small, persistent alarm, the endless 'what if' siren song that kept even the bravest minds hedging every decision, and he had been trying to hush it for years. <words>264</words>
He wanted to stop those frets not by force but by teaching the crew to feel time's seams, to see the weave and accept the pattern, which felt to him like mercy. <words>296</words>
The caretaker's wry jokes often had the edge of gentle harshness, a way to correct without crushing, and tonight he chalked a spiral on a freight crate like a tiny galaxy. <words>327</words>
He traced the cloud paths onto the floor with his piece of chalk, mapping where they would shadow the hull and where whispers would be stamped by daylight or kinks in the metal. <words>360</words>
When the dial tone cut, the last connection thinned, and the crew's what ifs fell momentarily silent as if someone had closed a seam in the air. <words>387</words>
He took a breath, warmly aloof but engaged, and explained, not grandly but plainly, that time was less a ruler than a cartographer's map, stitched by choices and cloud shadows. <words>417</words>
He tapped the spiral and then the paths, showing them how a diverted cargo crate nudged later events harmlessly rather than erasing them, softening the sting of regret. <words>445</words>
And then, with the ease of someone folding a map, he let himself vanish, not as cowardice but as demonstration, by tracking cloud paths he stepped through a seam and left chalk dust spiraling. <words>479</words>
The crew blinked; the what ifs grew quieter, rearranged into a map the crew could follow without drowning in regret. <words>499</words>
