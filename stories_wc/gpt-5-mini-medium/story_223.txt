<story>
The seasick naval officer arrived at the crystal fortress at the end of a rainbow canyon feeling awkwardly charming despite the nausea. <words>22</words>
He had traded secrets across oceans and empires, and those same whispered ledgers had carried him here across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>45</words>
In his hand was a translucent ghost orchid bulb, a thing that pulsed like moonlight and smelled faintly of salt and old maps. <words>68</words>
He planned to transform himself using its bloom and a ritual he had learned by tracking moon phases, a clumsy curriculum of tides and shadows. <words>93</words>
The fortress was a thing of faceted memory: walls that sang when wind passed and halls that reflected intentions like a mirror that sometimes lied. <words>118</words>
He was awkwardly charming as always, hands too big for the delicate bulb, a sailor's gait softened by centuries of longing, and that charm was part apology, part defiance. <words>147</words>
He remembered trading secrets with a glass merchant and a glass priest whose coin was memory, and he remembered the mirror's promise to hold truth for a price. <words>175</words>
Across the quiet longing of centuries he had kept watch, seasickness a private joke against immortality, counting phases to time a sailor's stubborn heart to the slow pull of the moon. <words>206</words>
His motivation was to confront the mirror before it lies again, to force a true reflection from an artifact that had learned to charm lies into glass. <words>233</words>
The bulb hummed when cradled, translucent as confession, and under certain moons it promised to transform memory into form if coaxed with the right ledger of secrets. <words>260</words>
He traded secrets once more, whispering names and coordinates into the bulb as though it were a bottle and the moon a friend, because traded secrets had been his currency and his curse. <words>293</words>
At the zenith of the third waxing he placed the bulb on a pedestal of cut crystal in the great hall, its light aligning with the fortress's facets and the canyon's rainbow veins. <words>326</words>
He felt his stomach roll as if still at sea, an old sailor's nausea folding into the smaller, stranger vertigo of approaching truth, but he straightened with nostalgic defiance. <words>355</words>
The crystal began to sing and the bulb unfurled a ghostly bloom that shimmered like memory, and as light threaded itself through the mirror the fortress held its breath. <words>384</words>
He watched the reflection as if watching a ship approach a shore, democratic with fear and hope, and he spoke the ledger of names aloud so the mirror could not hide behind selective recall. <words>418</words>
The mirror hesitated; then its surface braided the whispered coordinates with the bulb's glow and showed him himself as he had been and as he yet might be, raw and apologetic and defiantly true. <words>452</words>
He confronted it before it could lie again and offered the awkwardly charming half-smile that had steadied treaties, lovers, and lonely watches across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>480</words>
The change was small; when the mirror confessed the truth his seasickness eased like tide retreating. <words>496</words>
