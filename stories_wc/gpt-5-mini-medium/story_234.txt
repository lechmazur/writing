<story>
He was a gentle swordsman who kept his blade wrapped in cloth and his heart in clearer hours.<words>18</words>
At night he walked through the dinosaur skeleton museum at night to hear the bones argue with shadows.<words>36</words>
He carried an empty matchbox in a pocket patched with other people's prayers and the small ritual of not lighting anything.<words>57</words>
He came late to almost everything, a champion of late bloomers who learned the names of flowers after they had begun to surprise him.<words>81</words>
Faithfully unfaithful to his own itineraries he would change plans for strangers and return for nobody, which is how he became a patient xenophile among midnight guards and grad students.<words>111</words>
Sometimes he spoke brusque affection, biting compliments that felt like constellations of advice and relief.<words>126</words>
When the orchard dog finally stops barking at night he would step into the central hall and find his bearings via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial nailed to a display case.<words>159</words>
Those angles were a cipher of patience and geometry he had worked out with a faded compass, spidery charcoal marks, and his slow, exact hands.<words>184</words>
Across glass the fossil ribs rose like ribbed planets, and he imagined cradling each orbit to cradle the universe in a cupped hand while his blade rested like a bookmark.<words>214</words>
He was known as faithful to the pulse of other people's nights but can't be pinned as loyal to a city or a lover, and so he called himself faithfully unfaithful again like an honest paradox.<words>250</words>
A child curator once found him tracing vertebrae with mittened fingers and asked why he came so late to museums.<words>270</words>
He said, brusque affection in his voice, that late bloomers make the best listeners and that patience was his only rebellion.<words>291</words>
The child offered him a toothpick and the empty matchbox slid from the back pocket into the small pale palm like an offering.<words>314</words>
Inside the box he kept a scrap of map, a pressed daisy, and a note that read, in angular handwriting, to cradle the universe in a cupped hand if you find it.<words>346</words>
He opened his palms then, slow and theatrical, and explained via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial how the light could be bent into promises and small kindnesses.<words>375</words>
The swordsman taught the curator to name constellations in the fossil shadows and how to measure mercy with a thumb and a scrap of compass paper.<words>401</words>
