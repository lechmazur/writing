He was a bluffing swindler who moved through the reclaimed orchard farmland inside a toppled skyscraper with practiced ease. <words>19</words>
His charm ran like varnish over rotten beams, energetic but oddly slowed, an energetically lethargic motor that never quite died. <words>39</words>
That morning, at the instant a frozen computer finally restarts, the entire atrium hummed and a strip of sunlight pinged off a blank price tag pinned to a fallen beam. <words>69</words>
He had been waiting to magnetize attention, to pull eyes like iron filings toward a story he could sell, but the tag suggested nothing, a deliberate void. <words>96</words>
Invisible allies, he liked to joke to himself, were his greatest trick: whispers of wind through apple boughs, the echo of a stairway, the creak that moved a buyer's hand. <words>126</words>
He did not believe in ghosts, only in alliances arranged by circumstance and timing, and tonight the timing felt precise, cruelly precise. <words>148</words>
A dropped book—old cover mottled with cider stains—bounced off his boot and skittered to the roots of an office tree, and because his hand reflexively reached the same moment another hand did, their palms collided. <words>183</words>
She was quieter than his practiced targets, eyes like honest coins and a breath that smelled of apple blossom and smoke, and she apologized as if the fall were her fault. <words>214</words>
The dropped book had been her excuse, a meet-cute arranged by gravity and the toppled building's odd geometry; the title, a guide to displaced property law, opened like an offering. <words>244</words>
He wanted to magnetize her attention further, to spin a pitch that would let him look inside her pockets for coin and conviction, but instead he found himself listening to her undercurrents. <words>276</words>
She carried a blank price tag in the spine of the book, folded to hide, and when she showed it to him her fingers trembled like small branches. <words>304</words>
The tag, she said, was a symbol; someone had erased the cost of a parcel of orchard, leaving memory and deed floating unpriced and ignored. <words>329</words>
He wanted to lie about knowing the law to impress her, to trade charm for access, but the instant the frozen computer finally restarted the kiosk above them flared and spat a ledger page into the air. <words>366</words>
The page fluttered, landing between their feet with the quiet insistence of truth, and she said plainly that her motivation was to bare a truth no one dares to handle. <words>396</words>
Her voice had gentle harshness, a steady blade that trimmed excuses, and she asked him if he could help deliver the ledger's account to the few descendants still farming under glass. <words>427</words>
He imagined confessing, trading his grift for witness, and at last chose to bare the ledger, letting invisible allies steady his hands. <words>449</words>
