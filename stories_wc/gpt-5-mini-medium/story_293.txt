<story>The nervous minstrel tucked a crumpled photograph into the fold of his cloak before the early night in the bacteria-powered city. <words>21</words>
He had a habit of being rarely sincere when praised, smiling tight and changing the subject, but tonight the photograph pressed warm with memory and purpose. <words>47</words>
The city pulsed with cultured lights and microbial engines humming beneath glass boulevards, a living grid that fed lamps and lifted gondolas in a continuous, strange communion. <words>74</words>
He had come to the bacteria-powered city to escape the ordinary routines of provincial inns and rote applause, to deploy the map wound into his memory and to find a reason for his songs. <words>108</words>
Following star patterns he had learned from a sailor with ink-stained fingers, he traced constellations over rooftops and alleys, translating their geometry into a secret itinerary. <words>134</words>
That method felt absurd in a city whose heartbeat came from vats and plenum beds, yet the patterns conspired with the microbial light to make a path only someone desperate to be ordinary would ignore. <words>169</words>
He moved with cautious revelry, stepping as if every lamp were a note while his hands clenched the photograph, edges soft from being folded and refolded until its figures blurred like memory. <words>201</words>
The photograph was of a woman laughing at a roadside market, her hair a comet of light; it anchored more than nostalgia, it suggested a life he might aim toward if he could only find purpose in a world of uncertainty. <words>242</words>
Night vendors sold fermented honey and glow-mold pastries while microbes in vats rippled colors like northern auroras, and he felt both ridiculous and alive. <words>266</words>
He was rarely sincere because sincerity felt like an unguarded throat, but tonight the music in his chest and the photograph's promise made him honest in small ways, singing a half-remembered lullaby to a guttered lantern. <words>302</words>
Before a lonely candle flame gutters out he would need to deploy the small machine he'd been carrying, a compass of living cells that would pulse to the pattern he traced on the sky-map of his memory. <words>339</words>
Deploying felt like confessing; he adjusted the device beneath the hem of his cloak and felt it stir, microflora aligning like zodiac signposts whenever he matched the constellations overhead. <words>368</words>
People glanced at his nervous hands but smiled because music softened eyes in this city, and he traded a song for a vial of bioluminescent ink that might repair the photo's faded rim. <words>401</words>
The vial gleamed; he dabbed ink along the crease and watched the woman become clearer, as if the city and its microbes conspired to restore not only image but direction. <words>431</words>
He smiled rarely and with caution, a small revel that was almost a laugh, and set off by following star patterns into the elevated gardens where the vats exhaled warm light. <words>462</words>
Purpose trembled in his palms, fragile and chosen, and he walked to the city's edge before a lonely candle flame gutters out, ready to sing for a life that would not settle for ordinary. <words>496</words></story>
