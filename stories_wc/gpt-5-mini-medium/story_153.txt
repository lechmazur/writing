<story>After the last star burned out, an underground city of the mole people kept immaculate libraries lit by bioluminescent fungi. <words>20</words>
In that duskless realm a mundanely glorious routine governed study and survival, and an eternal college student who studied immortality paced its tunnels with detached devotion. <words>46</words>
He carried a coal miner's headlamp from a collapsed mine like a relic, its cracked glass asking small favors of dwindling filament. <words>68</words>
The lamp was not valuable for its light so much as for the story embedded in its patina: a map of weight and aperture that made the student's experiments plausible. <words>98</words>
Gifted burdens defined his curriculum; the older mentors called the condition both blessing and ledger, a talent for remembering lifetimes that refused to remain light. <words>123</words>
He wanted to become a master of his own reality, to rearrange memory and matter until the architecture of being yielded to precise will. <words>147</words>
His method was obscure and intimate: he would digitize consciousness by encoding fragments into apparatuses and archives, translating experience into patterns of light and notation. <words>172</words>
Crucially, he did not digitize by machines alone but via swapped travel journals discovered in the tunnels between mole wards, each ledger a holograph of footsteps and appetite. <words>200</words>
He traded his memories with other pilgrims who kept paper records, exchanging years of sensation for single paragraphs that fitted neatly into archival algorithms. <words>224</words>
Often the exchange felt like a cheerful abdication, mundanely glorious in its paperwork and the quiet order of lists, and he took comfort in the ritual while remaining formally aloof. <words>254</words>
Yet each swapped journal carried a debt: someone else's sorrow nested like mica, a weight that altered how immortality tasted and required him to shoulder another's night. <words>281</words>
He catalogued these burdens with clinical affection, annotating margins, mapping emotional topography so that later he could summon or excise them with practiced fingers. <words>305</words>
In the archives a coal miner's headlamp became a node: when its filament fluttered while a journal passed from one pair of hands to another, its light pattern encoded the moving grief into a lattice of signal. <words>342</words>
He learned to be ruthless in curation, excising florid longing but keeping the blunt facts that honed his competence, because mastery required fidelity to structure not mercy. <words>369</words>
At times the burden reversed: a miner's terrified hand once left a fossil of hope that expanded his empathy so dramatically he nearly abandoned the project to live among the mole families, which he recorded and then set aside. <words>408</words>
Ultimately his goal was not immortality for its own sake but the authority to edit existence, to digitize self and society via swapped travel journals until the subterranean city rearranged itself to mirror decisions he could trace in tidy marginalia. <words>448</words>
In private he confessed nothing; devotion remained detached, a study habit that protected him from the mess of lives while he accrued power to authorize or erase them. <words>476</words>
