In the quiet breakroom of the floating rock monastery, a tired swordsman sat with a plain cloth bag on his knees. <words>21</words>
Someone had just resigned from the council, and the kettle hissed like a small, indifferent storm. <words>37</words>
He was fiercely apathetic about politics and titles, but that apathy sheltered a soft core and a spark of defiance he rarely spoke of. <words>61</words>
The promise he kept hidden under his armor was not to any lord or doctrine but to himself: to rise, if only once, against a small wrong that gnawed at his conscience. <words>93</words>
He had made that idle vow on a night of drunken laughter years ago, and now the resignation left an empty chair that felt like an accusation. <words>120</words>
The breakroom smelled of incense and boiled roots, and the monastery floated, as if by habit, above a valley of cloud and smaller rocks. <words>144</words>
He opened the plain cloth bag and checked only a coin, a scrap of paper, and a cracked compass that had been useless for years. <words>169</words>
The compass refused bearings but the stars still mattered; a monastery elder had once told him to follow meteor showers when direction failed. <words>192</words>
He had laughed then, a knowing naivety in his smile, and filed the advice away like a trivial superstition. <words>211</words>
Tonight, in the wake of resignation, that naive line of logic felt like a map with a single glowing route. <words>231</words>
He had been fiercely apathetic for good reason—survival demanded detachment—but the spark of defiance pulsed under the cuirass like a stubborn ember. <words>253</words>
If he could follow the meteor showers, if he could step off ritual and let the sky write its route, perhaps he could overcome the small injustice that gnawed at the monastery's quieter edges. <words>287</words>
He stood, muscles complaining, and threaded his sword into place with the clumsy grace of someone who had learned to move as little as possible. <words>312</words>
His resolve was not heroic but stubbornly modest: to keep a hidden promise to oneself with the same weary fidelity that kept the monastery aloft. <words>337</words>
Outside, meteor showers began like gossip, quiet at first, then insistent, tracing silver threads across the dark like sewing through the sky. <words>359</words>
He followed them not with instruments but with a childish trust, that knowing naivety that lets a man believe the world still answers if he listens. <words>385</words>
The path the meteors traced led to a lower terrace where the resigning elder had hidden a ledger of petty abuses and a single stolen blade. <words>411</words>
He crouched, breath fogging, and felt an unexpected lightness when he discovered the ledger; it was smaller than his indignation, and therefore manageable. <words>434</words>
Opening the plain cloth bag again, he slid the coin into a hollow beneath a tile and wrapped the ledger inside the cloth like a secret to be kept between a tired swordsman and his conscience. <words>470</words>
He left the breakroom with the plain sack and a modest plan, a defiant, weary resolve that said he had overcome what kept him awake. <words>495</words>
