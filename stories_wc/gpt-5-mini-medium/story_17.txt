I am a guilt-ridden black market genealogist, amid morning walks, buying secrets and trading names like contraband to feed a quiet, atypically typical hunger for belonging. <words>26</words>
By analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies I learned to read the spaces between grief and pride and to map routes families would never reveal to law or heirs. <words>55</words>
I came to the witch's incantation chamber with a chipped bowl in my satchel and the awkward credential of someone who can unspool ancestry for a price. <words>82</words>
The chamber smelled of rosemary smoke and old ink and the witch, who wore brazen modesty like a shawl, blinked at me as if surprised this was a request she understood. <words>113</words>
She gestured to a worktable where herb bundles circled a circle of salt and glass jars hummed faintly with ancestry's residue. <words>134</words>
I set the chipped bowl down and told her my method: by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies to find who lied least and where forgiveness might start. <words>162</words>
She nodded, tracing an invisible family tree in the air, and asked me, not unkindly, why a trafficker in lineage sought redemption rather than richer clients. <words>188</words>
My answer felt both brazen and modest: I wanted, with the single-minded embarrassment of someone atypically typical, to find a path to self-forgiveness. <words>211</words>
She smiled with a secrecy that smelled like chamomile and asked for the zoom of my process, for the small rapid movement that let me close in on truth. <words>240</words>
I described how I would attend wakes, eavesdrop during coffee after the coffin lowered, and, amid morning walks, skim the hems of neighborhoods for discarded grief. <words>266</words>
Then, by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, I focused on which phrases hesitated, which jokes overcompensated, which silences stretched like maps to hidden culpability. <words>291</words>
The witch set her hands on the chipped bowl and began to hum, her voice like a magnifying glass that made small domestic lies expand until their shape could be read. <words>322</words>
The chamberâ€™s light bent; the salt ring flickered, and memories unpinned from speech, allowing me to trace a lineage of blame to a single, battered ancestor who had sold a daughter to feed debts. <words>356</words>
I thought of the chipped bowl in my satchel and how its sound when struck had always reminded me of a cracked promise. <words>379</words>
The witch instructed me gently: return the bowl to the family with the truth shaped not as accusation but as an offering, and watch for the brink of renewal in the first uneven silence that follows. <words>415</words>
I left amid morning walks, the waft of herb smoke at my back, and zoomed through alleyways with the odd, atypically typical bravado of someone ashamed yet determined to be better. <words>446</words>
When I offered the chipped bowl back, explaining the genealogy I had stitched by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, the daughter placed a palm on the rim and we both listened for forgiveness like a sound. <words>483</words>
