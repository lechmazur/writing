<story>
An awed astronomer tended a lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes, cataloguing stars and trees with the trembling reverence of a pilgrim. <words>23</words>
It was after the last human emotion is felt, the seasons measured in silences, when the astronomer discovered a tattered wedding veil from a jilted bride snagged on a branch like a fossil of sorrow. <words>58</words>
The veil smelled faintly of frost and regrets and its torn lace suggested a narrative the lantern light could not fully illuminate. <words>80</words>
He handled it with rationally organic care, combining method and intuition as if the heart of the lab and the heart of the orchard were one grafted organism. <words>108</words>
His motivation was clear and terrible in its clarity: to topple an idol carved from fear that still cast a longer shadow than any lighthouse beam. <words>134</words>
The idol lived in the hollow of the cliff, a statue grown of superstition and old warnings, and everyone in the empty settlements bowed to its silence for convenience rather than conviction. <words>166</words>
Cultivate, he thought, not destroy; cultivation could reveal the idol's roots and teach new growth how to unmake it, a moral dilemma wrapped in patient gardening. <words>192</words>
He planned via the patterns in a snowflake, reading crystalline loci for instruction as if each flake were a schematic for ethical pruning. <words>215</words>
Nightly under crystal shadows he mapped every filament and vein in the veil against constellations, translating torn threads into decisions about which superstitions to water and which to let die. <words>245</words>
Even when reason urged patience, the veil whispered memory and demanded action, forcing him to face the ethical paradox of reviving pain to dismantle power. <words>270</words>
He was awed not only by stars but by the way grief stratified like sediment, and that awe made his motives more tender and more exacting. <words>296</words>
The orchard itself had been planted to guide sailors and to teach moral geometry; its fruit hung like questions, rationally organic answers swelling under frost. <words>321</words>
At dawn he used the veil to smear salt across the idol's pedestal in patterns borrowed from snowflake diagrams, each smear a deliberate test of conscience. <words>347</words>
Villagers watched from the ice floes like dark constellations, their faces blank since feeling left the world, and they could not tell whether his acts were sacrilege or salvation. <words>376</words>
He knew the moral dilemmas were theater without spectators, that toppling an idol carved from fear might simply replace fear with something subtler or worse. <words>401</words>
To decide, he cultivated disagreement among the orchard rows, pruning branches into contradictions, letting the trees argue in leaf and bark. <words>422</words>
The veil became a talisman and a ledger, its tattered stitches recording each choice like a constellation of consequences. <words>441</words>
When at last he toppled the idol, it did not shatter with thunder but sighed, a thin exhalation that made the light through crystal shadows tremble. <words>467</words>
The villagers did not weep or cheer, but the astronomer, awed again, understood that the act planted a new question rather than delivering final judgment. <words>492</words>
