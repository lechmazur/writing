A hesitant bard stood in a xenon-lit tunnel at the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget, clutching a worn-out dinosaur plush like a small flag of surrender. <words>29</words>
He was shyly loud in manner, a contradiction of soft admission and strangely amplified gestures, as if his awkwardness had learned to wear a megaphone. <words>54</words>
People passed with quickened steps under the pearly xenon glow, their faces shuttered like windows against draughts of memory, but the bard wanted to motivate them toward something impossible and tender. <words>85</words>
His mission was odd and precise: via dream-hopping machines he would coax sleepers into shared reveries until they could retrace hours and stitch what had been frayed in the fragile loom of time. <words>118</words>
He carried plans, a map of dreams and a battered amp tuned by hope, and the dinosaur plush provided a steady pulse, a tactile ledger of small survivals. <words>146</words>
The plush was worn-out and lopsided-eyed, stitched back together in places where grief had tugged at seams, and it smelled faintly of cedar and old songs. <words>172</words>
At the crossing of that particular year the city had stored its regrets in steel lockers and locked the keys into the river, but the bard believed time's fragility meant those regrets were not lost, only rearranged. <words>209</words>
He approached sleepers like a sheepish herald, whispering invitations into the dream-hopping machines' interfaces with a hopeful clumsiness that felt like prayer and bad comedy. <words>234</words>
People laughed at the plush and the bard's squeaky refrains, then sometimes drifted: in their sleeping hours they found old conversations, knots of regret, or a child-sized clearing where forgiveness might be planted. <words>267</words>
Dream-hopping machines hummed like polite insects, translating the bard's ironic awe into tangible images: a patchwork family perched on a subway car, a teacher unmaking a cruel comment, seasons folding neatly into one another. <words>301</words>
He motivated not by force but by demonstration: when a tired commuter awoke with a hand on the plush and a memory rearranged, they carried a new stitch into daylight. <words>331</words>
Sometimes the machines misfired and stitched anachronisms together so fiercely that whole neighborhoods wore yesterday like clothing, which made the bard laugh with a brittle wonder and correct the machine with a gentle shove. <words>365</words>
His shyly loud presence became a hinge; people who had never spoken held each other's eyes and mended invisible hems, sewing hope with clumsy hands while the tunnel buzzed like a distant organ. <words>398</words>
He admitted, with the ironic awe that colored his voice, that his true aim was to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow so that new patterns could be stitched in its place. <words>430</words>
He shoveled small mercies into the dream-hoppers, offered the dinosaur plush like an emblem, and watched fragile time tremble and, improbably, begin to forgive. <words>454</words>
