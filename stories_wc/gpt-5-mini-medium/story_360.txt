<story>
A meek necromancer lived beneath lantern-studded arches in the underground city of the goblins. <words>14</words>
He was peculiarly sincere in his small rituals, gentle with bones and hushes, more scholar than scourge. <words>31</words>
His motive was singular and strange: to decode a universal riddle that hummed at the marrow of things. <words>49</words>
He kept a fountain pen with a broken nib that he believed remembered letters the living had forgotten. <words>67</words>
The pen lay in a velvet pouch beside a frayed scrap of tapestry he called the tangled tapestry because its threads tangled meanings together. <words>91</words>
He wanted to regain something lost, not power but a small clarity, a map from riddle to answer. <words>109</words>
Around him the goblin city murmured and played, the timeframe of his work oddly set amid playground sounds echoing in caverns. <words>130</words>
Children's laughter ricocheted off stone while merchants bartered and small choirs practiced lullabies for impossible infants. <words>146</words>
He wrote slowly with the broken nib, coaxing ink as if coaxing a reluctant spirit to remember a name. <words>165</words>
The fountain pen, though diminished, had a peculiar hunger for the right reflection, a need he could not name. <words>184</words>
One morning dew collected on a thread of the tangled tapestry that hung in his windowless courtyard, and light found it through a fissure. <words>208</words>
He watched how light reflected off the dew drop, and in that simple folding of brightness he felt the riddle stir. <words>229</words>
The reflection split the tapestry's colors into a tiny diagram, lines crossing like bones in a hand, and he traced them with the pen's broken tip. <words>255</words>
Each stroke seemed to regain a syllable of an old syntax, a grammar the dead remembered and the living ignored. <words>275</words>
He whispered answers into the pen's ink, and the nibless tip shivered like a reed singing the name of a forgotten god. <words>297</words>
Outside, a ball struck stone and children squealed, and those playground sounds threaded through the chambers like a metronome for his calm. <words>319</words>
He felt small victories: a curve that matched a star map, a dot that translated into a vowel of the universe. <words>340</words>
The city kept breathing with children and trade, but in the hush of his courtyard the tangled tapestry and the broken pen became a language pair. <words>366</words>
When he finally read the line aloud, it was not an answer but an invitation, a sentence that taught how to listen to undercurrents. <words>390</words>
In the dew's mirror he had learned the method: through the way light reflects off a dew drop the hidden syntax resolves into melody. <words>414</words>
Regain was not a return to former power but the slow gathering of attention, a reclaiming of how to hear the world ask its questions. <words>439</words>
He smiled, peculiarly sincere, understanding that decoding a universal riddle meant keeping curiosity alive and translating small reflections into communal rites. <words>460</words>
The underground city kept playing, and his quiet answer folded back into the tapestry, waiting for another dew and another light. <words>481</words>
