The grumpy crypt caretaker kept vigil in the witch's crystal scrying room. <words>12</words>
He mulled the multiply singular ache that haunted him with a grandiose subtlety that disguised how raw it remained. <words>31</words>
Throughout stargazing he sat by a bowl of sand and traced through the patterns in a sand mandala to steady the tremor in his ribs. <words>56</words>
The unmarked cardboard tube rested beside him like a relic and he gave it a careful jiggle to test a secret hinge of memory. <words>80</words>
Outside the crystal reflected constellations that seemed to argue in whispers as if the sky itself felt the stirrings of revolt. <words>101</words>
He had a motivation to quell an uprising within and also below, a stubborn bid to keep the crypt and its sleeping dead in patient order. <words>127</words>
Trauma, he had learned, was an enumerated geography and the importance of trauma was not just for remembering but for mapping the roads toward calm. <words>152</words>
As caretaker he cataloged echoes; each brittle sigh from a tomb became a lesson in what to soften and what to hold sternly. <words>175</words>
The room was filled with crystal light, velvet darkness, and the small machinery of ritual that made each night feel like a treaty between living will and buried past. <words>204</words>
He moved his fingers across sand paths, erased, retraced, arranged so that grief could multiply singular into fewer, steadier forms rather than fragment into raids upon the heart. <words>232</words>
Sometimes the tube served as a mute telescope, sometimes as a holder for herbs, but always it was a prompt for the memory that made him flinch. <words>259</words>
He thought of uprisings in small terms—a whispering fungus, a tombstone tipping—and of the internal rebellion that required a quieter suppression. <words>280</words>
At times he would jiggle the tube and listen for the sound of a name, believing pattern and percussion could dislodge a lodged sorrow. <words>304</words>
The witch whose crystals hung like captive moons taught him to read the sky while peering into the same glass, a method that braided outer and inner sight. <words>332</words>
Throughout stargazing they traced alliances between constellations and the curve of a hum, making ritual out of math so that sorrow had shape and therefore a place to go. <words>361</words>
He wrestled with the idea that the importance of trauma was not only in its weight but in its translation into action that prevented eruption. <words>386</words>
So he built patterns in the sand mandala that funneled grief like channels, letting small currents carry sediment to appointed basins while stars wheeled on. <words>411</words>
In that quiet engineering of feeling he discovered that to quell an uprising within one must both honor its reports and gently reroute its force so it nourished rather than demolished. <words>442</words>
He smiled, grumpy and small, a steward of quiet revolutions. <words>452</words>
