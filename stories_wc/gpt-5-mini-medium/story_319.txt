The frail guard waited on the tidal island at dawn, feeling the cold salt wind like an accusation. <words>18</words>
He had been posted here throughout sorting, when the island's inhabitants chose their fates and painted allegiances across their doors with careful, trembling hands. <words>42</words>
Being frail was not merely a description, it was the script that fate and magistrates had written for him, inked in expectation. <words>64</words>
He carried a sour-smelling alchemy phial tucked beneath his cloak, a pungent secret that smelled like lemon peel and old vinegar and hinted at experiments that might undo labels. <words>93</words>
Those experiments were illegal, whispered about in cellars and promised by a stranger with paint-stained fingers who had once traced the phrase painted allegiances on the guardroom wall. <words>121</words>
He was resolutely wavering about using it, a deliberate indecision that made him linger where others snapped choices like twigs. <words>141</words>
Throughout sorting, the harbor trees had become confessional pillars, and secrets traveled through messages carved in tree bark so that every acceptance and refusal could be read by moonlight. <words>170</words>
Each inscription was a fingerhold for hope or a gravestone for fear: a list of names, a cross that meant exile, a circle that promised work, a flourish that marked someone as chosen by the governor. <words>206</words>
The frail guard read and reread them, tracing the grooves with a thumb callused by rope and a life that had yanked sails and dragged bodies from the sea. <words>235</words>
Sometimes he would yank the cord around the bell tower just to feel a small rebellion against the bell and its measured sentences. <words>258</words>
The sour-smelling alchemy phial hummed in his pocket like a caged bird, dangerous and promising, and he imagined it spilling light that could wash away the governor's inked destinies. <words>287</words>
He had learned through messages carved in tree bark that the phial's recipe could unseal shackles if mixed with moonwater and a human vow, a ritual whispered in a dozen late-night scratches. <words>319</words>
Yet the inscriptions also warned; someone had carved a blunt admonition: those who fled would be named and painted allegiances reversed upon their return. <words>343</words>
That threatened not only his bones but his last companions, and his desire to escape a predetermined fate stung like salt in an old wound. <words>368</words>
So he practiced small contradictions: lingering longer at the sorting table to count ink blots, folding his back from salute to save a smile, and every evening he would read the new bark messages until the moon grew pale. <words>407</words>
One night the message trees held a map: a circle scratched with salt lines, a note about exactly when moonwater pooled in the lagoon, and a crude arrow pointing to the tide's low breath. <words>441</words>
He set the phial by the water and watched the moon oil itself, thinking his wavering heart had become a nameless resolve. <words>463</words>
At the appointed time he whispered the vow he had carved into a hidden hollow and he yanked the bell cord as rehearsed, a sound to jolt the watchers and signal his one terrible, hopeful choice. <words>499</words>
