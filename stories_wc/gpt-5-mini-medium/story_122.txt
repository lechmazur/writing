<story>
A cyber-templar, patched and praying, marched toward the sky burial site with a worn leather bridle looped over one plated arm, feeling like a relic and a program both at once. <words>31</words>
He was on a collision course with reality, not metaphorically but literally, a machine of ritual and error whose servos trembled and who felt patiently frantic as he adjusted his visor. <words>62</words>
During reading he recited liturgies written in code to steady himself and also to continue a curious motivation: to reflect lightning back at the storm that had become a recurrent accusation. <words>93</words>
He had come to this high, desiccated apron of earth where bodies were offered upward because he believed the mirage of safety could be refracted into real defense if he could prove his method. <words>127</words>
His worn leather bridle, oddly domestic against chrome pauldrons, had been adapted into a harness to hold a hand-polished prism at his brow so he might force the refraction of light through a prism and deliver the world's challenge into an answer. <words>169</words>
Around him gulls circled like punctuation and the cairns of bones testified to rituals practiced in wind and patience as mourners read names aloud from brittle data-scripts. <words>196</words>
He wanted to prove that the mirage of safety could be more than a consolation; he wanted to reflect the strike back outward, to return catastrophe into instrument and message. <words>226</words>
His motivation, framed in metal and small stubborn prayers, was to reflect lightning back at the storm so that the storm would be answered and perhaps altered. <words>253</words>
He worked patiently frantic, calibrating angles by touch and memory, turning a prism so that ultraviolet glands in the disputing clouds might see themselves and hesitate. <words>279</words>
Through the refraction of light through a prism he meant not only to split color but to split intent, to take the storm's accusation and send it back as coded mercy. <words>310</words>
The action was part experiment and part vow, and when lightning arced the world opened in a clean, holy fracture that made his armor sing in harmonic keys. <words>338</words>
Light spilled through the prism and fractured into knives of color aimed not downward but back toward the roiling black, and for a suspended eternity the storm seemed to reconsider its curriculum. <words>370</words>
He felt euphoric agitation as thunder paused and the gulls froze mid-syllable, every small mechanism in his body determining if this answer could be trusted. <words>395</words>
Readers around the cairns kept reading names, an unbroken litany that tied his experiment into ceremony and reminded him that during reading the living and the dead shared a breath. <words>425</words>
When the storm answered, not with annihilation but with a scattered, bright recoil, he understood that the mirage of safety was both a lie and a promise, and he had proved that light could translate fear into something like care. <words>465</words>
