<story>
The guarded minstrel sat crosslegged among glowing moss in the nano-forest, careful as a cartographer but wary of every ear that might catch a tune. <words>25</words>
He was skeptically credulous, a contradiction worn like patched sleeves: ready to doubt rumors of revival yet quick to follow a shared recipe for revival with trembling hope. <words>53</words>
When a last vow is written in a hidden diary beneath a lichen leaf, the minstrel had promised himself space to learn extinct crafts and to refuse the theatrics that had hollowed old guilds. <words>87</words>
He kept a plain plastic bookmark between two pages of the diary because the object seemed honest among gilded lies and because he liked the way cheap plastic resisted weather. <words>117</words>
Outside the sporefog small bands met, grassroots movements knitting survival with craft, teaching whittling and glassblowing and fiber braids in secret hollows while the world above bickered. <words>144</words>
He envied and admired them, but his temperament kept him private; his music was a ledger of feeling rather than recruitment, a map that made no promises. <words>171</words>
Angry peace lived in his jaw, a quiet scolding that sharpened his verses without setting fire to the meeting tents. <words>191</words>
His motive to learn extinct crafts ran deeper than nostalgia; it was a debt to ancestors who had taught resilience with hand and eye and who had also been betrayed by polished promises. <words>224</words>
When the hidden diary finally surrendered its last vow, written in a cramped faded hand and sealed with a thread of hair, he found a string of vows that never happened and a set of cipher marks. <words>261</words>
By decrypting wedding vows that never happened, line by line, he learned not only names and unmet promises but the way commitments could be perfumed into contracts that erased craft. <words>291</words>
He used the plain plastic bookmark as a ruler and pointer as he traced ciphers, feeling ridiculous and sacred in the same breath. <words>314</words>
With each decoded line he disowned a name, publicly in his songs and privately in his ledger, not to tear families but to unmake the pretences that had stolen apprenticeship and woodshop from their children. <words>349</words>
He was skeptically credulous about forgiveness: he wanted to believe repentance repaired damage but expected ledger marks to speak first. <words>369</words>
The nano-forest listened like a congregation of small gears, its bark microfilaments catching syllables and carrying them to mollified roots. <words>389</words>
His angry peace settled into a practice: he traded songs for hours in the loomhouse and in return the grassroots movements taught him collapsed knots and lost ceramic glazes. <words>418</words>
When apprentices asked why he had disowned their masters, he answered with a slow song that salted the edges of truth without cruelty, because the diary had demanded accountability in ink. <words>449</words>
In the end his mission was simple and vast: to learn extinct crafts and to hand them back to small hands that would not forget, preserving a quiet revolution of makers beneath the moss. <words>483</words>
