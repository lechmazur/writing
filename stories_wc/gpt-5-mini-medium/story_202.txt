A careful poisoner kept a low profile in the found object museum, moving like a conservator who preferred silence to applause. <words>21</words>
He carried an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt under a coat, its blade whispering stories of duels and soft betrayals. <words>42</words>
Amid skateboarding through the museum's open halls and over artful ramps, students and teenagers made the space breathlessly youthful, which both amused and concealed him. <words>67</words>
He was innocently guilty in the way he nodded at friends and left with a bookish shrug while a vial of something clinical and delicate nested against his ribs. <words>96</words>
His motivation, to test the edges of gravity, had become philosophical after years of watching coins quiver on tilted pedestals and paper birds snag on moving air. <words>123</words>
He followed a code of instinct, an inner law that told him when to steady a glass and when to let it tremble, and he treated that code like scripture. <words>153</words>
To authenticate his discipline and to invite a puzzle, he arranged a trail of cryptic clues hidden in a scavenger hunt among the exhibits, each riddle coupled to a found object. <words>184</words>
Visitors followed paper scraps taped under benches and small brass arrows tucked beside strange buttons, unaware that the path also gauged how sheaths and hands balanced torque. <words>211</words>
Skateboards clacked like distant applause while an adolescent leapt a ramp and his wheels sang against polished sculpture bases, making the whole scene fragile and kinetic at once. <words>239</words>
He watched the teenager's arcs with the scientist's patience and the thief's restraint, composed to measure the minute deviation that might tell him whether something obeyed gravity or flirted with escape. <words>270</words>
The rapier's cracked hilt reminded him that elegance and ruin are lovers, and he polished its pommel during quiet afternoons to authenticate his reverence for precision. <words>296</words>
At night, under the museum's skylight smeared with dust and a bloom of weak stars, he set the final clue on a plinth beside the cracked hilt and watched the scavengers tilt toward it like moths. <words>332</words>
One student, guilty of curiosity but innocently guilty in manner, found a folded note that instructed him to vault the narrow colonnade to prove a hypothesis about centrifugal daring. <words>361</words>
He obeyed, skate shoes skidding on museum stone, and for a suspended half-second the boy's center of mass tilted away from expected descent, a small theorem written in motion that made the poisoner laugh softly. <words>396</words>
The laugh was oddly tender; he felt innocently guilty for eliciting joy even as he confirmed the code of instinct that told him where the limit between risk and rescue lay. <words>427</words>
At dawn, with the museum emptied and the dusty starlight fading into grey, he left the rapier in its display, authenticated by a tiny inscription only he could read, and walked out lighter in his boots. <words>463</words>
