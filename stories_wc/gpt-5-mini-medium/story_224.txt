<story>
A lingering minstrel lingered in the odd hush of the giant's dining room, perched on a salt cellar like it was a cliff while the city beyond thudded amid rush hour. <words>31</words>
He was openly private in his gestures, a paradox inscribed in his pockets of songs, playing quiet tunes to himself that smelled faintly of burnt toast and longing. <words>59</words>
He cradled a witch's gnarled wooden ladle like a relic and hummed as if to coax it into confessing a map out of the mundane existence he sought to escape. <words>89</words>
He believed he could rejuvenate his worn spirit via the texture of a meteorite's surface if the ladle and space could be made to touch one another's not-quite-remembered grain. <words>118</words>
When he paused, the clatter of giant forks and the distant honk became a silence like approval, and in that fragile hush his plan was affirmed by silence. <words>146</words>
He kept a ledger of confessions under his shirt, openly private in that he let anyone read his hands but never his heart, which tightened like a stringed instrument. <words>175</words>
He rose as a titan in miniature and amid rush hour commotion, staff rushing platters and a carriage clattering against gargantuan bowls, he set the ladle's bowl upon a small iron meteorite the size of a coin. <words>212</words>
He pressed the ladle's rim to the meteorite and began to rub, trusting that via the texture of a meteorite's surface the worn wood would drink star-grit and pass it into him. <words>244</words>
The rubbing felt like braiding time: small rough patches answering small rough memories, the minstrel's breath quickening as old aches softened and a childlike courage warmed his palms. <words>272</words>
The giant's fork paused mid-air; the room's clamor folded into a pocket of nothing, and that absence affirmed his right to attempt departure from the gray treadmill of daily tunes. <words>302</words>
His motivation to escape a mundane existence crystallized into a small, simple decision: he would rejuvenate not to impress or conspire but to become alive enough to leave songs unfinished and streets fresh. <words>335</words>
He kept his plan softly public by nodding at passersby while hiding the meteorite in a sugar cube tin, openly private so others thought him ordinary while he prepared departure. <words>365</words>
A server nearly tipped the tin, causing a tremor in the ladle that felt like a hiccup in his newly emplaced pulse, and he feared the ritual might be interrupted. <words>395</words>
He inhaled until the room was a held note, allowed the ladle to drink and then pressed the warmed wooden bowl to his collarbone, where meteorite texture hummed like a contained comet. <words>427</words>
Warmth threaded his ribs, the silence affirmed departure, and he slipped down a napkin fold toward the city to begin an outward, private, openly brave life. <words>453</words>
