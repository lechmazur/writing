<story>The irate smuggler jogged the abandoned spaceport flight deck, palms slick, breath sharp with purpose. <words>15</words>
A single chopstick thumped in his clenched fist like a makeshift compass and a talisman. <words>30</words>
He moved with jogging rhythm to clear his head, which was a poor shield against the heart's revolt that had been rising for months. <words>54</words>
The revolt was abstractly physical, a stubborn ache that made his ribs a map of grievances and small betrayals. <words>73</words>
He came to this derelict launch apron because rumors of hidden waterfalls beyond the orbital cliffs had become an obsession. <words>93</words>
Finding those waterfalls would memorialize a promise he had made to a lost partner, a quiet pledge he kept only in the cadence of running. <words>118</words>
He memorialized by patterns in tea leaves that he brewed in a dented canteen at dawn, reading rivulets like constellations for a map. <words>141</words>
The tea leaves told him of eddies and drops tucked within rock teeth, if only he could trust the bitter language of their stains. <words>165</words>
Biting sincerity was his armor; he corrected himself aloud when his anger flavored a divination too neatly. <words>182</words>
Around him the flight deck creaked underwind and solar glare, a cathedral of rust where freighter bones became gardens of scrap. <words>203</words>
He jabbed the chopstick into an oil-stained seam and felt its balance like an accusation, testing the world across a needle of wood. <words>226</words>
Every step during his jogging traced a private liturgy, one footfall answering the other, each a small refusal of the quiet he had inherited. <words>250</words>
Sometimes the heart's revolt wrote itself in scabbed lines under his skin, abstractly physical, and he read them with the same care he gave the leaves. <words>276</words>
The smuggler's ire sharpened with each new pattern promising water but hiding gullies of bureaucracy, old debts, and the cruelty of maps that lie. <words>300</words>
He memorialized the lost promise by burning the smallest leaf pattern into the chopstick's tip, blackening wood as if to sign a treaty with memory. <words>325</words>
It was a simple, abstractly physical act: a dent, a scar, a ledger entry that made grief legible in three dimensions. <words>346</words>
The tea found new patterns as he rehearsed his maps, and the leaves finally bowed toward a canyon whose sound, translated, hinted at waterfalls. <words>370</words>
His anger did not calm; it filtered into a precise tenderness that demanded truth rather than comfort. <words>387</words>
Against the bitter sincerity he folded a plan: follow the leaf-lines off the deck to a service lift, down maintenance catwalks, and into a shaft that smelled of ancient condensation. <words>417</words>
He jogged faster, an irate smuggler sprinting toward solace, the chopstick like a baton of accusation and kinship. <words>435</words>
When at last the sound became a roar, he knelt and read the leaves again, as if to memorialize the waterfall itself and the way his heart had revolted to find it. <words>467</words>
Water fell in veils below, and the smuggler, irate but honest, let his tears mix with the tea at the edge of the pool and felt the revolt settle into something like peace. <words>500</words></story>
