The polite bandit sat crosslegged at the edge of the electronic wilderness refuge, an unlikely sentry in a place of humming trees and wire vines. <words>25</words>
He was eloquently silent, folding manners into a stillness that made children in the nearby classroom glance up even during the hush of a classroom once the bell has rung. <words>55</words>
He called himself a bandit out of respect for the thieves who stole moments rather than things, and in his pocket he carried a machine learning chip with strange code that whirred like a caged ember. <words>91</words>
His goal was uncommon and patient: to become a master of time, to learn the grammar of seconds so he might hold a sigh and return it polished. <words>119</words>
Shattered allegiances shaped his path; former friends in the syndicate had chosen vaults and currencies while he chose quiet laboratories and the sound of circuits. <words>144</words>
He moved with a proud humility, explaining when needed and apologizing for the accidental scratches on a researcher's pen, but he never hid the hobble in his left leg that reminded him of debts unpaid. <words>179</words>
At night he listened to the refuge, the data-trees singing in packet bursts, learning how to braid delays like hair and mapping the lapses between pulses. <words>205</words>
Sometimes the chip's strange code opened little windows of memory that showed him betrayals, the faces of allies who had folded under pressure, a mosaic of choices that explained the current fractured loyalty. <words>238</words>
He learned to listen not with his ears but through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp that hung in the refuge's heart, its strings attuned to clock drift and to the small lies time tells. <words>274</words>
When he plucked a sour tone, past loyalties jingled like coins across a table, and he imagined conversations that never happened between old comrades and mentors. <words>300</words>
The classroom above the refuge was empty but for a teacher's coat draped over a chair, and every erased equation felt like a map of chances he could reweave into a better chronology. <words>333</words>
He was polite to the janitor who mopped at midnight, offering tea and a soft excuse for his tinkering, and the janitor called him eloquent with a nod and no questions. <words>364</words>
When the chip hummed a particular inversion, he would hobble to the harp and let the notes translate, each discord a grammar lesson on how moments could be elongated or shortened. <words>395</words>
Learning was his rebellion; every tiny alteration in timing was a promise kept to himself against the people who had abandoned codes and comrades alike. <words>420</words>
At dawn, if he succeeded, he thought, the clockwork in children's recess would stall and give a child an extra second to catch a falling kite, and he would smile with proud humility, knowing he had not stolen that second but returned it. <words>463</words>
Still, the ache in his leg and the ghost of betrayed oaths taught him that mastery of time was less a crown than a careful ledger, balanced by mercies and apologies to those he had called friends. <words>500</words>
