<story>
An amiable gambler named Corin kept a vintage ledger beneath a loose floorboard in the firefly breeding grounds.<words>18</words> 
He was mildly obsessed with patterns, with debts and with the slow mathematics of chance, yet he carried a calm like dusk and a kind of peaceful anger that tempered his smiles.<words>50</words> 
Throughout charity drives he sat at folding tables under nets of firelight explaining to donors how to hydrolyze hope into something useful, translating chemical metaphor into consolation.<words>77</words> 
People gave coins and canned food, and he recorded each kindness in the vintage ledger as if each line could stitch the world back into the kingdom his grandmother had described, a lost kingdom of oak and stone.<words>115</words> 
Restoring that kingdom was his quiet, stubborn motivation; he traced maps in the margins, annotated rituals, and practiced the art of unbecoming, unlearning aristocratic habits to become something softer and truer to the land.<words>149</words> 
He believed that to repair a polity one must hydrolyze pride and titles into water and seed, to let identity dissolve like sugar so the soil might remember how to hold new roots.<words>182</words> 
He did this via the way petals fall from a flower, leaving bright punctuation on the grass that the beetles and small amphibians took as instructions.<words>208</words> 
In the breeding grounds, glass jars hummed with incubating light and volunteers moved like patient priests, and Corin listened as fireflies blinked in the dark like a ledger of constellations.<words>238</words> 
He logged species, nights, and temperatures in tiny hand; each entry doubled as a prayer and an essay on humility.<words>258</words> 
Mildly obsessed is too gentle for the way his pulse quickened when a donor read aloud a line that matched a margin note, because each match seemed to hydrolyze some residual crown still clinging to the people's imaginations.<words>296</words> 
His amiability softened interrogation, and his mild obsession with lists became ritualized care; children would slip him wildflowers and he would study the fall of petals as if they were votes.<words>327</words> 
Often he spoke of the lost kingdom not as nostalgia but as a blueprint for gentler governance, describing how taxes could be seeds and punishment could be pruning, each action a hydrolysis of cruelty into compost.<words>363</words> 
Throughout charity drives Corin timed his slow work to the rhythm of giving, setting jars of glowing larvae on tables like votive cups and tallying small mercies in the ledger by candlelight.<words>395</words> 
A volunteer once accused him gently of hoarding dreams into numbers and he answered with peace-laced anger that sounded like a promise: the ledger was a map and the map would hydrolyze grief into gardens.<words>430</words> 
He taught others the art of unbecoming, releasing crowns as the petals fell.<words>443</words>
