The humorless comedic actor sat on a swing in a deserted playground at the edge of a wilderness, an inkwell, dried out beside him like an accusation. <words>27</words>
He remembered unwanted gifts from an audience that applauded him for being sad while expecting jokes, each memento objectively personal and therefore unwanted. <words>50</words>
He had come to this fringe to bottle a star's dying breath, a project equal parts superstition and stubborn grief. <words>70</words>
He attempted the work through persistent daydream loops, rehearsing the siphon and the lid and the silence until the motions felt rehearsed enough to be ritual. <words>96</words>
At last he had to concede that the inkwell, dried out and useless, was the only vessel he could find on that rusted bench. <words>120</words>
He sat through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, listening as swings lost their chorus and the wild beyond held its breath. <words>142</words>
Now the humorless comedic actor treated silence as a stage and grief as a script he could not improvise out of. <words>163</words>
He thought of the unwanted gifts like bad props, ribboned trinkets and audience sympathy that demanded he mend other people's wonder. <words>184</words>
He imagined siphoning a wandering photon and coaxing it down through the funnel of his hands and into the dry inkwell that had once signed programs. <words>210</words>
At times he would concede that no vessel could really keep a dying star, and yet he could not abandon the experiment because of the way memory felt like a shot already diluted. <words>243</words>
Persistent daydream loops folded into small ceremonies, and on an October evening he stopped counting stars and simply listened for the sound a collapse might make. <words>269</words>
A fox paused at the tree line, eyes like commas, and the wind rearranged the leaves into an answering hush. <words>289</words>
He leaned forward, cupped his hands, pretended to scoop down where the darkness thinned, and imagined the breath sliding like ink. <words>310</words>
The inkwell, dried out and empty of pigment, could not contain a star, but it accepted his notation as if that meant anything. <words>333</words>
He finally conceded another thing: those unwanted gifts were objectively personal demands dressed as presents, and he could no longer perform their redemption. <words>356</words>
Instead he bottled something different, a single exhalation of his own that smelled like smoke and old applause, and labeled it hope. <words>378</words>
Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry he let the swing's small creak be the metronome of his fragile victory. <words>398</words>
In free structure and small ceremony he conceded that the attempt to bottle a star's dying breath had been a way to tell himself stories that stitched him back together. <words>428</words>
