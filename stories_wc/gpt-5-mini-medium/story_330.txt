A dejected knight drifted in the dim center of a zero-gravity dance hall, armor swaying like a slow pendulum as ribbons of light looped around his gauntlet. <words>27</words>
He cupped a single relic-a trident prong from a sunken realm-against his chest, its metal humming with salt and memory and refusing to let him forget what lay beneath the waves of time. <words>60</words>
When an old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour, sound braided oddly with silence and the hall tilted as if time itself had taken a shallow breath. <words>87</words>
In that strike the knight felt horizons deepen, not outward but inward, a series of chiaroscuro doors opening one by one to reveal not landscapes but echoing possibilities. <words>115</words>
He had been normally abnormal for as long as he could remember, living between statutes of order and moments of holy chaos, accepted by neither court nor convent. <words>143</words>
The trident prong pulsed when he hardened his jaw, and the pull at his sternum seemed to quicken the beat of something outdated and vast beneath the ballroom of stars. <words>173</words>
He moved through forgotten paths carved not in earth but in memory, spiraling along the invisible grooves the clock's strike had scored into his mind. <words>198</words>
Around him dancers orbited without gravity, their costumes impossible and pious, saints in sequins spinning with the decorum of ritual and the indecorum of celebration. <words>223</words>
Sacred disorder stitched the place together, so that what should have been sacrilege felt like prayer and what should have been prayer felt dangerously like rebellion. <words>249</words>
He had come to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, a promise that had accumulated sediment of regret and hope until it needed to be spoken to release its buoyancy. <words>280</words>
He extended the trident prong outward like a flag, and the blade's fifth memory, a taste of cold light from the deep, coaxed a phrase from his throat as if the relic itself had learned to speak. <words>317</words>
The words were strange liturgy and stubborn oath, a quickening syllable that pushed the hall's slow drift and drew the dancers' faces into a shared gravity. <words>343</words>
When the unexpected hour repeated itself in a distant tone, the knight felt the horizon of his small life expand like a pupil widening to let in starlight. <words>371</words>
He remembered vows made under torches and vows made silently beside empty harbors, and now he would quicken his breath to set that sediment free, to watch regret rise and break in a harmless bloom of light. <words>408</words>
He spoke then, not loudly but with the pressure of tide, and the trident prong shone like a compass needle pointing toward futures that had been hidden by fear. <words>437</words>
The dancers slowed as if obeying a sacred command, their bodies arranging into a constellation that mirrored the watchtower's face, and for a moment the zero-gravity hall felt like a cathedral adrift. <words>469</words>
His silent vow became an echo, then an answer, and the unexpected hour proved to be less an accident and more a summons that quickened the deepening horizons of his heart. <words>500</words>
