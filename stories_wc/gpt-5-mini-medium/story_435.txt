<story>
A professional dream interpreter arrived at the vapor collection facility carrying a crumpled invitation and a small leather satchel. <words>19</words>
He moved with a peculiar faith, as if each folded crease of paper answered a question he could not yet hear. <words>40</words>
The facility smelled of warm condensate and bread because the technicians collected vapor during baking, which turned the air sweet and slow. <words>62</words>
Inside, pipes threaded like veins toward glass banks where distilled memories pooled, and a quiet pulse marked the timers with a patient insistence. <words>85</words>
He was occasionally frequent in his visits, a contradiction he respected because dreams hold patterns that obey odd rhythms. <words>104</words>
His job required that he listen for the minute thrum of the unconscious and translate smell into ordinance and rumor into remedy. <words>126</words>
This visit had a different urgency because he planned to calcify a precedent, to render mutable rules into stone by other means. <words>148</words>
His motivation was simple and terrible: to rewrite laws carved in stone that kept people measured and immobile. <words>166</words>
He would accomplish this by impersonating a missing person whose family had been silenced by those statutes, and he rehearsed the cadence of their voice. <words>191</words>
The crumpled invitation contained a seal bearing the absent name and the hour of a private reckoning, which made the deception plausible. <words>213</words>
He walked to the glass banks where technicians monitored condensate levels and felt the quiet pulse synchronize with his own misgivings. <words>234</words>
An assistant joked about rituals, unaware that the interpreter planned his impersonation by memorizing the missing person's mannerisms and handwriting. <words>254</words>
Outside, ovens in the facility hummed and bled warmth into the glass, the baking timetable dictating when vapors would be richest and most lucid. <words>278</words>
He had to choose the moment when the vapor's memory would prefer the missing person over the absent truth, when collected dreams leaned toward belief. <words>303</words>
He rehearsed the small rituals the family expected, kissed the envelope, whispered the old nicknames, and let his heart practice a peculiar faith until the lines blurred. <words>330</words>
When he entered the parlor stitched with vapor pipes, someone mentioned that memories could calcify into law if not carefully attended. <words>351</words>
He smiled in a way that suggested confidence and grief simultaneously, adopting the missing person's limp and laugh and borrowing their silence. <words>373</words>
At the appointed hour the vapor banks released a ribbon of scent that smelled like old keys and orchard wind, and the household let him in because his paper bore the correct fold. <words>406</words>
Inside they poured cups of steaming condensate tea and tasked him with reading a vial whose label bore laws they believed immutable. <words>428</words>
He recited the missing person's childhood story, the misremembered dates, the jokes about a cracked bell, and the family nodded as if consecrating an amendment. <words>453</words>
When the last cup cooled the technicians logged a change and the facility's governance accepted testimony delivered in scent, allowing precedent to settle where the old etchings remained. <words>481</words>
Later he left the facility clutching the crumpled invitation, peculiar faith steadying him like a compass. <words>497</words>
