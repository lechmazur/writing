<story>
On a baroque asteroid that hung like borrowed starlight in the thin sky, a lurking assassin waited by an iron railing. <words>21</words>
He held a paint-splattered camera lens against his chest as if it were a rosary, its glass catching filaments of dim nebula. <words>43</words>
The unforgiving road curved beneath the asteroid's carved balustrades, an impossibly narrow ribbon where vehicles never forgot the price of a mistake. <words>65</words>
It was the hour when the bus driver completes the final route and the last yellow lights blinked like tired constellations. <words>86</words>
He was superficially profound, speaking in clipped maxims that sounded like prophecy to lonely travelers, yet he wore gestures that betrayed a small, human fear. <words>111</words>
Tonight his motive was more tender than the rumors suggested: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, a phrase he repeated to himself like a benediction. <words>137</words>
He planned everything via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, each silvery strand a map for footfalls and breath. <words>158</words>
Below, the unforgiving road glinted with pooled oil and frozen starlight, promising neither mercy nor mercy's illusion. <words>175</words>
A modest laugh escaped him then, not cruel but raw, because humor was the only blade he dared let gleam in public. <words>197</words>
He remembered a childhood lesson: even the most ornate corridors end at a threshold and the world is indifferent to your intentions. <words>219</words>
The baroque asteroid's architecture was theatrical, gilded friezes framing windows that opened onto void, and the place favored theatrics because it made death look like an act. <words>246</words>
He kept the paint-splattered camera lens to remind himself that perspective could be stained but still focus, and to prove to any trespasser that art and violence shared the same fingerprints. <words>277</words>
A bus sighed across the distant loop just then, and the driver completed the route with a human shrug that rippled through the station like a pulse. <words>304</words>
Two passengers stumbled into the cold, their faces pale with stories; the assassin watched their hands, learned their rhythms, and catalogued fear like an archivist. <words>329</words>
He told himself his aim was noble, superficially profound words about redemption and holding back the dark, but the truth tightened his chest: he simply wanted to cradle the dawn in trembling hands. <words>362</words>
He crept along balustrades, the spider's web map guiding each toe and elbow, until a streetlight haloed a solitary figure who held a crate of newborn bread. <words>389</words>
The assassin remembered the laugh of a mentor and laughed again, but this time his sound was a ribbon of borrowed starlight that trembled with wanting. <words>415</words>
He raised the paint-splattered camera lens to his eye like a telescope, seeking the exact angle where harm could be precise and mercy accidental. <words>439</words>
At the last breath between night and the brittle promise of dawn he hesitated, thinking that to cradle the dawn in trembling hands might mean to break it as well. <words>469</words>
Then he remembered the spider's wet geometry and moved, and his action was the grace note that saved one life and shattered another. <words>492</words>
