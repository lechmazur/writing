<story>At the end of a corridor no one dares walk, the factory worker reviewed a ledger and his own pulse as gargoyles brooded above a terrace over a bottomless abyss. <words>31</words>He was a factory worker with cosmic powers, academically wild at the margins, exact in motion yet impulsive in thought. <words>52</words>A plain cameo brooch, dull and modest, pinned his sleeve like a keepsake and a compass to old obligations. <words>72</words>Tonight his review was not of parts and quotas but of promises, of the family ritual that connected generations by naming what each dared not say. <words>99</words>The ritual was simple and obscure: they walked to the gargoyle-guarded terrace, set the cameo between palms, and reviewed the footprints of fear aloud. <words>124</words>It was a strange, ordered disarray, a cadence of tidy chaos that made the generations listen while their hands trembled. <words>145</words>Tonight he intended to review not fear but the rules that bound him, to disregard the footprints left by doubt as if they were mud on a uniform. <words>174</words>He had been schooled in expectation: punch in, polish the cameo, keep your head down, accept the ledger's arithmetic. <words>194</words>But his cosmic endowment made him restless, an academically wild mind that peered at timelines and imagined other margins of reality. <words>216</words>On the terrace's lip, the bottomless abyss hummed like unfinished equations, and the gargoyles watched with stony, patient judgment. <words>236</words>He placed the plain cameo brooch between his palms, felt its modest weight, and opened his mind to a review of inherited restraints. <words>260</words>Visions drifted, algebra of constellations and overdue reports, but the ritual demanded voice and lineage, so he named the first rule aloud: never misstep, never excel. <words>287</words>He spoke the second: be steady, be predictable, be a gear; the words tasted of factories and of small, safe victories. <words>309</words>Then he paused, and the ordered disarray within him rearranged - the academically wild syllables pushed against grammar and family script. <words>331</words>He reviewed the list, felt the cameo's cold plainness anchor him, and then, in a small revolt, declared a third rule of his own making: follow wonder. <words>359</words>The ritual's generations held their breath across time; he imagined his grandfather's hands and his granddaughter's future fingers touching the same cameo. <words>382</words>He resolved then to disregard the footprints left by doubt, to step past prescribed trails and let his cosmic power refurbish worn expectations into open possibility. <words>409</words>As the gargoyles blinked in stone, he pinned the plain cameo brooch over his heart, walked to the terrace edge, and let himself be carried by a strange tidy chaos toward a new ledger of life. <words>446</words></story>
