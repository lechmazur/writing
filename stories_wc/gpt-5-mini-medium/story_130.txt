The lost apprentice trailed a thumb over a fallen bird's nest in the hull corridor of the interstellar orchard ship as it migrated between galaxies. <words>25</words>
He smiled with mocking affection because the twigs were braided with tiny solar filaments and a trade bead that might have been a traveler's token. <words>50</words>
Privately open, he kept his hopes folded like paper cranes, admitting nothing to the crew but collecting confessions like seeds. <words>70</words>
The ship smelled of citrus orchards in microgravity and engine oil, and the promise of changing winds hummed through the grafted branches draped over gravity wells. <words>96</words>
He wanted freedom in self-acceptance more than he wanted to be anyone's journeyman, though he still carried the apprentice's knot in his pocket like a small confession. <words>123</words>
A veteran traveler, draped in patched windleaves, sat across the arch and offered traveler's wisdom in barbed bon mots that smelled faintly of toasted plankton. <words>148</words>
He told the apprentice to reverse-engineer his fear by listening to the ship's static and turning the noise into maps. <words>168</words>
The method sounded absurd: via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone salvaged from a garden cabin on Io, the kind that still echoed with human murmurs. <words>196</words>
He took the phone, its antenna bent like a crescent leaf, and held it to his ear while the orchard ship altered course across the promise of changing winds. <words>225</words>
Static pressed against him like a distant market, and from it emerged a grandmother's laugh, a smuggler's apology, and a child's question about stars. <words>249</words>
Each confession, grainy as old fruit, taught him a rule: you cannot prune what you refuse to see, you cannot graft honesty onto a lie, and sometimes a nest falls for reasons you will never own. <words>285</words>
He reverse-engineered those admissions into gestures: he rewove the fallen nest with thread and reclaimed the bead, tucking it into the apprentice's knot in a private ritual. <words>312</words>
Privately open as a moon's underside, he began to perform for no audience but the fruiting trees and the humming drives, and the mockery in his grin softened into affection. <words>342</words>
The traveler who had offered the gnomic advice clapped him on the shoulder and said, in a voice like salt and honey, 'Freedom starts when you stop apologizing for being half-growth and half ruin'. <words>376</words>
Across the promise of changing winds the ship tilted, flung a scatter of pollen satellites into a new quadrant, and with each tiny bloom the apprentice felt his private openness unfurl further toward a gentle self-acceptance. <words>412</words>
He laughed at himself, a small orbit of sound, mocking affection that felt like a key turning. <words>429</words>
When the crew later asked how he had changed, he only held up the bead and the rewoven nest and said, 'I reverse-engineered my silence into truth'. <words>456</words>
