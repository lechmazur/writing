The Cursed Lake had become a churning maw of impossibility. [10]
In the center, where dark water once stagnated, a swirling orchard vortex now ground the sky into bruised pulp. [29]
Huge apple trees, uprooted and terrified, spun in a tightening spiral, their branches interlocking like the fingers of drowning giants. [49]
This catastrophe was the violent aftermath of a grand deception, occurring only moments after the magic trick fails. [66]
The court illusionist, Verrick, had attempted to weave a cloak of pure reflection to hide his treason, but the spell had shattered, collapsing the surrounding geography into this lethal carousel. [96]

Kaelen stood on the shoreline, a guarded druid whose silence was heavier than the ironwood armor plating his chest. [115]
He observed the destruction with warlike serenity, a calm that did not reject violence but mastered it. [132]
Others had fled the exploding illusions, but Kaelen remained because of his specific, cursed attribute: he finds lost things. [151]
Today, he was not looking for a misplaced coin or a stray child, but for the truth Verrick had tried to bury beneath a thousand false reflections. [178]
His motivation was singular and piercing: to discover what mirrors don't show. [190]

Kaelen stepped off the solid earth and onto the trunk of a spinning apple tree as it swept past the bank. [211]
He moved with the rotation, leaping from one groaning timber to the next, navigating the chaos with the grace of a falling leaf. [234]
The air smelled of ozone, crushed fruit, and panic. [243]
As he drew closer to the eye of the storm, the physics of the world grew distorted, bent by the weight of the broken magic. [268]
In the dead center of the vortex, suspended above the roiling water, hung the architect of this disaster. [286]
Verrick was trapped in a beam of solid light, his body paralyzed in the middle of a scream. [304]
This was the core concept of the disaster: a frozen confession. [315]
The scream held the details of the betrayal, the names of the dead, and the location of the stolen crown, all locked in a stasis that the mirrors could not obscure. [347]
However, the chaotic magic shielded Verrick like a diamond shell, preserving the secret in silence. [362]

Kaelen balanced on a root system that hovered near the center and reached into his moss-lined pouch. [379]
He withdrew a heavy, throbbing object: a flesh-eating plant seed, harvested from the deepest jungle of the southern wilds. [398]
It was warm to the touch and hungry for energy. [408]
Kaelen pressed the seed against the hard light of the barrier. [419]
He closed his eyes and began to channel his power, not in a straight line, but through expanding circles. [438]
This method mimicked the growth of old wood and the ripples of a pond, a natural geometry that the jagged, artificial magic of the illusionist could not comprehend. [466]
He pushed his will outward in rings, feeding the seed's voracious appetite with the ambient chaotic energy. [483]

The seed cracked open with a wet snap. [491]
Vines, red as arterial blood and thick as pythons, exploded from the shell, latching onto the frozen light. [509]
They did not just break the barrier; they began to consume the distortion itself. [523]
Kaelen focused his intent on a single action: to unbend the twisted reality that Verrick had wrought. [540]
The vines tightened, pulling against the warp of the air, straightening the curled light and forcing the vortex to slow. [560]
The screech of metal on glass filled the orchard as the magical tension snapped. [574]

The swirling trees crashed into the water as the vortex lost its momentum. [587]
The diamond shell around Verrick dissolved, eaten by the vines, and the frozen confession finally thawed. [603]
The scream that had been trapped for an eternity of seconds burst forth, echoing across the calming lake. [621]
It was a ragged sound, carrying the undeniable weight of guilt. [632]
Kaelen stood amidst the floating debris, the red vines retracting into the water, sated and dormant once more. [650]
He listened to the confession fade into the wind, satisfied that the mirrors were broken and only the ugly, unvarnished truth remained. [672]
