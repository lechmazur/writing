The dawn light fractured through the translucent masonry of the Sapphire Viaduct, casting long, blue shadows across a world that had recently gone quiet. [23] It was the morning after the last fish was caught, an event that had finally snapped the tension of the drying ocean and left the basin beneath the bridge undeniably empty. [55] Elian, a mage of decidedly lukewarm ability, sat in the center of the span, arranging jagged shards of bronze with trembling fingers. [77] He possessed an earnestly naive spirit, the kind that allowed him to believe he could fix a broken planet simply because he had read the instructions in a dream. [106] Before him lay the ruin of a heavy ship’s bell, its metal surface corroded by centuries of salt and silence. [127] To anyone else, the bell was scrap, but Elian viewed it as the fulcrum of existence. [143] His motivation was singular and terrifyingly vast: he intended to right a cosmic imbalance that had allowed the seas to retreat in the first place. [168] His magic, usually mocked for its inability to boil a kettle or freeze a pond, was uniquely suited to this peculiar thermodynamics. [190] He did not use fire to weld or force to bind; instead, he sought to rebuild the artifact by understanding dripping rates. [212]

Elian hovered his hands over a collected pool of morning dew, warming it to exactly room temperature until the viscosity shifted. [233] He lifted the liquid with a subtle magnetic pull, suspending a single droplet above the primary crack in the bronze. [253] In this realm of plausible impossibility, the repair required not heat, but rhythm. [266] If the water dripped at the precise frequency of the ocean's lost heartbeat, the metal would remember its purpose and fuse. [287] It was a practice of brittle devotion, a rigid adherence to a timing so specific that a microsecond of hesitation would shatter his psyche along with the bell. [315] Elian counted under his breath, his eyes wide and unblinking. [325] One drop fell, striking the fissure with a sound like a plucked violin string. [339] The bronze hummed, drinking the lukewarm fluid. [346] He adjusted the suspension of the next drop, calculating the drag of the air and the cooling temperature of the dawn. [367] He had to maintain the water at a tepid equilibrium, preventing it from evaporating into the dry air or freezing in the high-altitude chill. [391] This was the paradox of his power; only a mage without the passion for fire or the heart for ice could sustain such a gentle, monotonous stasis. [418]

He released the second drop. [423] It hit the metal, and the crack sealed an inch, knitting together with a golden scar. [439] Elian smiled, a gentle expression that betrayed his lack of understanding regarding the danger he courted. [455] He did not know that the cosmic imbalance was a heavy door that, once opened, might swing back with crushing force. [476] He only knew the math of the fall. [484] Drop by drop, he continued his work as the sun climbed higher, heating the Sapphire Viaduct until the blue stone seemed to liquefy beneath him. [509] The ship’s bell, once a shattered carcass of history, began to regain its curved integrity. [524] Elian’s devotion remained absolute yet fragile, entirely dependent on the next successful fusion. [537] When the final fissure remained, a hairline fracture near the lip of the bell, Elian prepared the ultimate drop. [556] He felt the weight of the missing ocean pressing against his temples. [568] He released the water, his timing synchronized with the memory of a wave crashing against a hull. [585] The drop made contact, and the bell groaned, sealing itself into a perfect, seamless whole. [600]

Elian sat back, wiping sweat from his brow, his lukewarm magic dissipating into the air. [615] He reached out and struck the rim of the rebuilt bronze with his knuckle. [629] A low, resonant toll rolled out across the dry basin, a sound so deep it seemed to pull moisture from the very air. [652] Far below the viaduct, in the dust where the last fish had gasped its final breath, the ground darkened. [671] Elian watched with innocent wonder as the first geyser of the returned sea erupted toward the sky. [688]
