The light in the floating island tea garden was blinding, a relentless white gold that scoured the eyes, fitting for a world screaming in luminous torment. [25]
Elias, a crafty lantern maker known for entrapping the wisp-lights of the lower marshlands, sat at a wrought-iron table, ignoring the cooling jasmine steam. [49]
He was not here to drink, but to work against the clock of metaphysics. [63]
It was the hour after the shadow detaches, that terrible final phase of death where the silhouette flees the body, leaving the soul exposed and rapidly evaporating. [90]
His wife, Elara, was currently dissolving in the cottage behind him, her memories leaking out into the atmosphere like iridescent mist. [111]
Elias held a rough, cloudy prism in his calloused hands, engaging in the rhythmic, repetitive friction of gem polishing. [129]
He did not use sandpaper or water; he used the velvet hem of her favorite dress and the sheer force of his denial. [152]
His goal was dream recording, a forbidden art that required a surface so flawless it could snag the ephemeral visions of the dying before they dissipated into the ether. [181]
Above the garden, tethered by chains of heavy gravity-glass, hung the Glass Basilica on a floating isle, a cathedral of mirrors where the unshadowed dead were meant to ascend. [210]
Elias looked up at the structure, feeling the nausea of the paradox that defined their world; to reach that holy height, one’s spirit descends while ascending, a crushing spiritual heaviness increasing the higher the body rose. [246]
He would not let Elara go to that cold, mirrored prison without sending part of himself with her. [264]
The prism in his hand grew hot, the facets smoothing under his desperate ministrations until the stone vanished from sight, leaving only a hole in the air. [291]
This was the moment. [295]
A wisp of violet light—Elara’s final dream of a garden that never existed—drifted from the cottage window. [314]
Elias raised the polished void, catching the violet smoke. [323]
The light swirled inside the invisible gem, panicked and vibrant, beating against the geometric constraints of the crystal lattice. [341]
Now came the true test of his craft. [349]
He had to force the energy to transform. [357]
He squeezed the gem, pressing his thumb into the sharp apex until skin broke and blood smeared the invisible facets. [377]
The blood acted as a binding agent, and with a sound like a breaking icicle, the trapped dream flattened, expanded, and solidified into a thin, glowing sheet of violet paper. [408]
Elias set the spectral sheet on the tea table. [417]
His hands, usually steady for delicate filament work, shook as he began the creases. [431]
His motivation: to fold grief into origami cranes, was the only instruction his fingers understood. [446]
He folded the corner, trapping a memory of her laugh. [456]
He creased the wing, sealing away the scent of her hair. [467]
Every fold was a sharp intake of breath, a physical compression of the agony that threatened to tear his chest apart. [488]
The lantern maker worked with terrifying precision, his craft turning raw sorrow into aerodynamics. [502]
The crane took shape, glowing with the pulse of the recorded dream, a small artifact of the woman he was losing. [523]
When the final beak was shaped, the bird twitched. [532]
Elias stood, the air around him shimmering with heat. [541]
He walked to the edge of the garden, where the tea leaves swirled in the updraft. [557]
He held the crane out toward the Glass Basilica. [566]
"Fly," he whispered, the word scraping his throat. [574]
The paper bird flapped its wings, shedding sparks of violet light. [585]
It launched itself into the paradoxical wind, diving downward to fall upward, a bright spark sinking into the blue sky to reach the heights. [608]
Elias watched it go, the light of the Basilica reflecting in his wet eyes. [622]
He had kept her dream, and in doing so, he had given his grief wings to follow her, a luminous torment that would circle the glass spires forever. [650]
