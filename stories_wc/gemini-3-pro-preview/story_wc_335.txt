Silas, the shard-mirror archivist, did not believe in coddling the fragmented souls under his care. [15]
He believed that comfort was a crutch, whereas friction was the only force capable of sharpening a dull spirit. [33]
The Forgotten Library was silent, save for the settling of dust upon thousands of jagged, silvered remnants lining the rot-resistant shelves. [54]
In the center of the room sat the object of his current, gruff fixation: a heavy prism containing a distinct afternoon shadow caught in glass. [78]
Inside that trapped darkness lay the consciousness of Lenore, who had fled the world’s brightness three years ago. [95]
Silas approached the pedestal, his boots scuffing the floor, but as the shadow pulsed violently against its transparent walls, he abruptly turned and began to retreat step by step. [123]
He always walks backwards when nervous, a habit born from a superstition that one must never turn their back on a distortion of reality. [147]
"You are rattling the cage again, girl," he barked at the glass, his voice echoing off the mirrors. [164]
"It is not time yet." [169]
He retreated until his spine hit his desk, where a porcelain cup steamed with the bitter scent of black tea. [188]
Silas did not drink; instead, he peered into the dregs, intent on analyzing the geometry of tea leaves that clung to the ceramic curve. [211]
The wet clumps formed sharp, triangular intersections that pointed inward—a geometry of conflict rather than submission. [227]
He grunted, masking his approval with a sneer. [235]
"Still fighting the inevitable, are we?" [241]
He picked up a diamond-tipped stylus and marched—forward this time—to the prism. [254]
Lenore’s situation was a specific, magical jurisprudence known as reversible exile. [265]
She could leave the moment she proved she could withstand the light, but Silas refused to open the door; the mechanism required that she break it down herself. [292]
His motivation was to mentor resilience quietly, hiding his lessons behind barriers and insults so that she would learn to rely solely on her own strength rather than his charity. [322]
He raised the stylus to the glass surface. [330]
"The leaves say your angles are sharp today," he muttered, preparing to annotate the prison’s surface with binding runes that would actually weaken the structure if struck correctly from within. [359]
"Anger is good fuel, but aim is better." [367]
He began to scratch equations onto the facet, pretending to reinforce the seal while actually highlighting the structural fracture points. [386]
The shadow inside surged, a dark turmoil of smoke and memory swirling in agitation. [400]
"Do not think I will make this easy for you," he growled, the tone of combative tenderness thick in his throat. [420]
"If you want to breathe air again, you must hate me enough to shatter this work." [436]
The library held its breath. [441]
It was that precise, suspended timeframe at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze, a moment of potential energy waiting for a catalyst. [467]
Silas finished the annotation and stepped back, wiping diamond dust from his thumb. [480]
"Well?" [481]
"Are you going to sulk in the shade, or are you going to fix what you broke?" [498]
The shadow condensed, forming a silhouette of a fist against the interior of the glass. [513]
Silas felt the familiar urge to walk backwards again, his heart hammering with a fearful hope, but he forced his feet to remain planted. [537]
He needed her to see him standing his ground so she would learn to stand hers. [553]
With a sound like a cracking glacier, a hairline fracture appeared exactly where Silas had marked the glass. [570]
He scowled, crossing his arms to hide his trembling hands. [580]
"Sloppy form," he criticized, watching the crack lengthen. [588]
"You are hitting the glass, not the geometry." [596]
The shadow ignored him, striking the flaw again with renewed violence. [607]
The shard-mirror archivist narrowed his eyes, suppressing a smile as the prism finally gave way, shattering outward in a glittering explosion of reversible destiny. [631]
Lenore stood there, blinking in the dusty light, no longer a shadow but a solid, breathing woman. [648]
Silas kicked a shard of glass toward her. [656]
"You made a mess," he grumbled, handing her a broom to hide the fact that he was proud she had finally decided to return. [680]
