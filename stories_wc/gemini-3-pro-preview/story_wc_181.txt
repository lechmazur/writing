Elian stood amidst the glowing boughs of the astral orchard, squinting against a radiance that felt suspiciously like radiation. [19]
This lonely asteroid, drifting through the silence of the void, was blooming with spectral fruit that hummed a low, unnerving C-sharp. [40]
The atmosphere was thick with a brightened disquiet, a luminous anxiety that made his teeth ache. [56]
As the bewildered curator of this impossible collection, Elian felt less like a guardian and more like the punchline of a cosmic joke. [79]
The sensory overload of the ghost-trees became too much to bear, forcing him to retreat to the only sanctuary where his mind ever truly cleared. [104]
He locked the door of the habitat’s cramped bathroom, staring into the polished steel mirror while the ventilation fan droned its rhythmic mantra. [127]
It was a ridiculous habit, but he had long ago accepted his method of having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms as an unfortunate necessity of his mental process. [154]
Here, away from the blinding starlight and the judging trees, the paradox of his situation began to unravel in the sterility of white tiles. [178]
He reached into his pocket and withdrew the source of his current existential dread. [192]
It was a pistachio shell cameo blank, smoothed and prepared for a carving tool that he did not possess. [211]
The object was deceptively mundane, a piece of refuse elevated to art, yet it represented the crux of a nonlinear inheritance that defied all biological logic. [237]
According to the holographic manifest that had appeared on his pillow yesterday, this specific shell had been bequeathed to him by his own great-great-grandson. [262]
The timeline was a tangled knot, forcing him to accept heirlooms from a future that his own actions had not yet secured. [284]
Elian turned the beige curve over in his trembling fingers, struck by how the task before him was simply complicated. [304]
He merely had to carve the face of a woman he had never met onto a shell from a nut he had never eaten, to ensure the boy who sent it would eventually be born to send it back. [343]
A hunger began to gnaw at him, not for food, but a driving motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge regarding the mechanics of this temporal loop. [368]
He needed to understand the causality, even if the universe preferred he remain ignorant. [382]
The bathroom walls seemed to close in, pushing him toward a realization that the answers lay outside, with the trees that drank starlight. [405]
He flushed the toilet purely for the auditory punctuation it provided, then marched back out into the shimmering grove. [424]
The asteroid spun beneath his boots, a tiny island in an ocean of ink. [438]
He stopped before the tallest tree, a construct of weeping light, and prepared to inquire about his destiny. [456]
"Who is she?" he shouted at the branches, holding the blank shell up to the alien sky. [473]
The leaves rustled with the distinct, dry sound of turning pages. [484]
Elian realized with a sudden, vertiginous jolt that his existence was confined to a specific structural limitation. [501]
He was trapped in the timeframe between the first and last page of a history that was being written simultaneously in both directions. [524]
The curator looked at the shell again, and the smooth surface seemed to mock him with its infinite potential. [543]
If he carved the wrong face, the inheritance would vanish, the asteroid would go dark, and his lineage would unzip from reality. [565]
The light from the orchard intensified, casting long, impossible shadows that pointed toward the habitat he had just left. [584]
He understood now that the orchard was not a garden, but a library of unlived lives waiting to be pruned. [604]
With a sigh that mingled with the solar wind, Elian gripped the shell tight, sensing the phantom weight of the knife he would find tomorrow. [629]
He would carve the face of the fear he felt right now, capturing the brightened disquiet in miniature. [647]
That was the only way to close the loop. [656]
