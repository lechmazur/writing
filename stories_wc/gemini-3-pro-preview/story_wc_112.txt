The Xenobiology Research Station was a lonely spire of duralumin and glass, tethered to the edge of the stratosphere where the air was thin and bitter. [26] For weeks, Elian had waited for this specific moment, existing within the hush of beating wings at rest. [43] The massive Void-Weavers, translucent moths the size of gliders, lined the external gantries in a slumber so deep they resembled statues of frosted glass. [66] Elian was an obliging sky mechanic, the kind of man who fixed a broken heater before anyone complained and tightened rivets that technically passed inspection. [91] Yet, his compliance masked a radical obsession that the station’s lead biologists would have deemed insanity. [107] He needed to prove that time moves sideways, that the universe was not a river but a stack of infinite pages, and the Weavers knew how to turn them. [136] The scientists claimed the creatures vanished during the twilight storms, presumably blown off course, but Elian had seen the impossible geometry of their departures. [160] Tonight, the atmospheric conditions were perfect, the sky a bruise of indigo and violet. [174] He stood before the experimental array he had jury-rigged near the north docking clamp. [188] Directly ahead lay the magnetic nexus at twilight, a swirling convergence of polar field lines that became visible only when the sun hit the ionosphere at the correct angle. [217] The wind bit through his thermal suit, stinging his exposed face, but the device beneath his hands felt mechanically warm. [237] It was a steady, vibrating heat, generated by the over-clocked capacitors he had salvaged from the trash compactor. [255] This sensation created a strange duality in the air, a pervasive atmosphere of icy warmth that made his skin prickle with anticipation. [277] Elian checked the alignment of the prism lenses one last time. [288] He was not using radar or sonar, but was attempting to peer behind the curtain of reality through holographic principles. [308] By refracting the ambient light through the magnetic distortion, he hoped to create a three-dimensional interference pattern of the "sideways" time. [330] The interface hummed, waiting for the surge of power that would illuminate the invisible. [344] Elian looked at the sleeping Weavers, their wings folded in perfect stillness. [356] If he was right, they were already moving in the other timeline, active and awake while their physical bodies remained dormant here. [378] He reached for the heavy control mechanism, a solid steel bar that felt archaic amidst the digital readouts. [396] With a deep breath that fogged in the cold air, he grasped the lever. [410] He pulled it down with a decisive clank. [418] There was no explosion, no blinding flash of lightning to mark the breakthrough. [431] Instead, the phenomenon manifested as a series of subdued awakenings. [441] First, the holographic projection flickered into existence, painting the air with gossamer light. [454] Then, the silence of the deck was filled with a phantom fluttering, a soft vibration that bypassed the ears and resonated directly in the chest. [479] Elian watched, wide-eyed, as the holographic ghosts of the Weavers detached themselves from their sleeping physical forms. [496] The projections didn't fly away into the sky; they stepped laterally, moving perpendicular to the station’s reality. [513] He saw a Weaver launch itself not into the wind, but into a Sunday that hadn't happened yet. [531] Another slid smoothly into a yesterday he had already lived. [541] The mechanism purred, the heat of it seeping into his gloves, anchoring him as he witnessed the impossible. [559] For a moment, Elian felt the urge to step sideways with them, to abandon his life of repairing air scrubbers and servicing the whims of ungrateful researchers. [586] He imagined an existence where he wasn't just the helpful mechanic, but a traveler of the lateral seconds. [604] But as the magnetic nexus drifted out of alignment with the setting sun, the holographic window began to collapse. [623] The phantom wings faded, returning the gantry to the sole possession of the slumbering, frozen forms. [639] The cold rushed back in, severing the connection. [648] Elian released the lever, his heart hammering against his ribs. [658] He had his proof, recorded in the buffer of his illicit machine. [670] He picked up his wrench, the familiar weight grounding him back in the linear present. [685] Tomorrow, when the scientists panicked over the empty roosts, he would offer to check the perimeter sensors, obliging as ever. [705] He would nod at their theories of migration and weather patterns, holding the warmth of the secret truth close to his chest against the biting cold. [731]
