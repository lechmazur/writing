The pressurized glass of the dome groaned under the weight of the Atlantic, a sound Silas had grown accustomed to over the long, solitary years. [24] He was a hands-on folklorist, a man who rejected the dusty safety of archives in favor of the mud and danger where legends actually breathed. [49] While his colleagues debated taxonomy in lecture halls, Silas was here, submerged in a sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks. [69] It was a surreal bubble of preserved botany trapped on the ocean floor, where ancient apple trees grew twisted and grey in the artificial light. [93] Above the reinforced transparency of the ceiling, the rusted keels of destroyers and galleons formed a jagged, iron circle, like a crown of thorns imposed upon the deep. [121]

Silas wiped his soil-stained gloves on his canvas trousers, his eyes scanning the geometry of the wreckage overhead with feverish intensity. [141] He possessed a chronically curious mind that refused to let sleeping mysteries lie, a trait that had cost him his reputation and his safety. [165] This isolation was the price he paid for the chance to recover stolen memories. [179] The theft had occurred when he was a young man, foolish enough to barter with forces he did not understand, and now, decades later, the void in his mind remained a raw, open wound. [213] The Fair Folk had taken the recollection of his wife’s voice, leaving him with only the silent movie of their life together. [235] The air inside the dome tasted of crisp nostalgia, a biting, sensory hallucination of burning leaves and autumn frost that grew stronger as he neared the solution. [262]

He had spent months waiting for this precise moment to act. [273] To open the way back to the realm where his memories were hoarded, Silas needed to detect a microscopic alignment in the magic that bound this place. [300] He navigated the ritual not by the stars, which were invisible beneath the crushing depth, but by studying broken constellations formed by the gaps between the submerged hulls. [328] Where the iron silhouettes of the ships failed to meet, slivers of bioluminescent algae from the water above shone through the glass, creating a fractured map of a sky that no longer existed. [361] He needed the light to hit the soil in a pattern that mimicked the Pleiades, but the drift of the wrecks had been chaotic for years. [387]

However, today marked the timeframe when habits break, a rare celestial and tidal event where the ocean’s predictable currents reversed, forcing the iron sentinels to rotate in the silt. [416] Silas watched the shadows slide across the mossy earth, his heart hammering against his ribs as the jagged darkness realigned. [436] Suddenly, a beam of phosphorescent light pierced a new gap in the wreckage, striking the earth near the center of the grove with deliberate precision. [461] He rushed to the spot, dropping to his knees in the damp loam. [474] There, pushing up through the soil in the exact center of the light, was a solitary fairy ring mushroom. [492] It was not a circle, but the hub of one, a white, fleshy anchor point that vibrated with a low hum. [513] It was the physical key he had spent a lifetime seeking. [524]

Silas reached out, his fingers trembling not from age, but from the terrifying proximity of his goal. [541] The crisp nostalgia swelled into a roar, the smell of rain and old paper filling the dome. [558] He pressed his hand firmly against the mushroom cap, closing his eyes as the texture of the fungus dissolved into pure energy. [580] The glass walls of the greenhouse seemed to shatter, not from water pressure, but from the influx of the past. [600] The broken constellations above mended themselves, the rusted ships dissolving into the image of a starlit canopy over the university quadrangle where they had first met. [626] The decades vanished in a heartbeat. [632] He heard her laugh, clear and bell-like, and the stolen memory slotted back into his mind, whole and perfect, worth every second of the cold, dark wait. [659]
