The painted clown mouth of the funhouse entrance gaped with a rot that smelled of wet sawdust and ancient, crystallized sugar. [21]
Elias stepped through the gullet, drawn by a magnetism that churned his stomach while simultaneously quickening his pulse—a repulsive allure he could not resist. [45]
Since the resuscitation, when the defibrillators had violently dragged his soul back into his bruised chest, the visual fabric of reality had been irreparably torn. [70]
Everything moved with a lingering luminance, leaving trails of sickly neon light that hung in the air for long seconds after the source had looked away. [96]
He was not alone in this chromatic distortion. [104]
Beside him walked the Whispering Advisor, a tall silhouette that existed only in the nervous periphery of his vision. [123]
Elias knew better than to try and look directly at the entity; in the one picture taken of them together, the Advisor appeared only as a violent, scratched-out void, proof that the creature was photographically cursed. [160]
"Deeper," the Advisor murmured, its voice sounding like dry autumn leaves skittering on cold concrete. [175]
Elias consulted the leather-bound volume in his trembling hands, a battered dream dictionary he had found on his bedside table upon waking in the ICU. [199]
He navigated the maze not by sight, but through paradoxical notes scrawled in the margins of the text in a handwriting that looked suspiciously like his own. [226]
*To ascend, go down,* read the frantic ink next to the entry for 'Falling'. [240]
*To silence the scream, one must sing with a closed throat.* [251]
He followed this nonsensical logic, turning left where the warped path clearly went right, stepping over apparent holes that the lingering luminance revealed to be solid ground. [278]
His goal was specific and desperate: he intended to trick fear into revealing its weakness. [293]
For weeks, the terror of the void had hunted him, feeding on his panic, but Elias had deduced that the entity bound to him was sustained by his resistance to it. [324]
He stopped before a distorted mirror in the Hall of Giants, reaching into his pocket to finger the cold metal of an antique opera cloak clasp. [350]
The clasp, shaped like a weeping heavy-lidded eye and cast in tarnished silver, was the physical anchor that kept the Advisor tethered to this plane. [375]
"It is watching," the Advisor hissed, the sound vibrating unpleasantly in the cartilage of Elias’s ear. [391]
The mirror did not reflect Elias; instead, it reflected the swirling, hungry void he had seen during his brief, medically-induced death. [413]
To spring his trap, he had to offer it the one thing it did not expect: vulnerability without terror. [432]
He needed to unbosom the darkest truth of his resurrection, a secret he had kept buried even from himself. [451]
"I know you are hungry," Elias whispered to the swirling darkness in the glass, his voice steady despite the shaking of his hands. [474]
He opened the dictionary to the page defining 'Home' and read the handwritten marginalia: *The door only opens when you admit you never wanted to leave.* [500]
The lingering luminance of the mirror’s surface flared a violent violet. [511]
"I did not want to come back," Elias confessed, the words tearing out of his throat like jagged stones. [530]
"The silence was perfect, and I hated the noise of living again." [542]
This was the bait, and it was lethal. [550]
Fear, as a predatory cosmic force, expected the living to cling desperately to vitality; it did not know how to digest a creature that courted the abyss with such honesty. [580]
The reflection rippled, confused by this inversion of instinct. [589]
The Advisor shrieked, a sound of grinding metal, as the opera cloak clasp grew searing hot in Elias’s hand, burning his palm. [611]
By embracing the repulsive allure of death, Elias had starved the fear of its primary sustenance. [627]
The mirror cracked, not outward, but inward, imploding into a small, manageable pile of jagged glass on the dusty floor. [647]
The heavy atmosphere lifted immediately, the sickly sweet smell fading into simple, mundane dust. [661]
Elias closed the dream dictionary, trapping the paradox inside. [670]
He had looked the monster in the eye and offered it apathy instead of dread, and in doing so, he had broken its spine. [694]
The lingering trails of light faded, leaving the funhouse dark, quiet, and finally, just an empty ruin. [711]
