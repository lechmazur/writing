Silas Vane adjusted his frayed cuffs, the ink stains on his fingers a testament to his day job churning out sordid rumors for the City Gazette. [26]
Here, however, in the cavernous gloom of the Chevalier Sheet Music Archive, he was not a writer of scandal, but a remover of it. [50]
The vast room smelled of lignin and neglect, filled with floor-to-ceiling shelves where the silent notes of dead composers waited in the dark. [73]
Outside the high, grime-streaked windows, the world was held in a terrifying suspension. [86]
It was that heavy, suffocating hush before the orchard’s trees are cut down, a temporal pause where the impending violence of industrial saws charged the atmosphere with static. [113]
Silas needed that tension; it acted as a pressure cooker for the supernatural. [126]

He turned to his client, Elena, who stood trembling by a podium. [138]
In her hands, she gripped an antique perfume bottle, the glass cloudy with age and residue. [154]
"The vessel is small, but the memory is viscous," Silas murmured, his voice scratching like a rusty needle. [172]
"You must understand that grief is like water trapped in a blocked pipe; if we force it out too quickly, the plumbing bursts." [195]
He was fond of advising through metaphors, mostly because the literal mechanics of his trade were too grim for civilians to stomach. [217]

"I just need to speak to him," Elena whispered, her eyes fixed on the bottle. [232]
"I have to apologize for the ruin I brought on this house." [244]
This was the motivation driving the ritual: an overdue apology that had soured over twenty years into a haunting. [263]
Silas nodded and began his work. [269]
He did not use holy water or salt. [277]
Instead, he uncoiled heavy copper wiring, weaving it through the metal shelving units surrounding them. [292]
He was building a cage of induction. [299]
"We will reach him through induced currents," Silas explained, clamping the leads to a portable generator. [315]
"The spirit is electromagnetic residue; by generating a fluctuating magnetic field around the bottle, we can induce a current in the ghost itself, forcing it to manifest." [342]

He yanked the starter cord. [347]
The generator sputtered, then hummed, a gritty, mechanical sound that warred with the archive’s silence. [362]
Silas cranked the dial. [366]
Invisible energy flooded the aisle, vibrating the thousands of paper sheets stacked around them. [380]
Suddenly, the cork popped from the perfume bottle with a sound like a pistol crack. [395]
A gray vapor poured out, smelling of roses and ozone. [405]
Caught in the induced field, the vapor twisted, snapping into the jagged shape of an old man. [422]
The ghost flickered violently, anchored by the magnetic loops Silas had constructed. [434]

"Father?" Elena choked out, stepping toward the shimmering distortion to reconnect with the man she had betrayed. [451]
"I am so sorry for selling the rights... for everything." [461]
The ghost’s face formed, etched in agony and static, mouth opening in a silent scream that vibrated the very filing cabinets. [482]
It was an imperfect miracle. [487]
Silas watched the readings spike into the red; the connection was established, but the signal was corrupted by years of resentment. [508]
The father reached out, his fingers brushing Elena’s cheek, leaving a burn mark of frost, before he nodded solemnly. [527]
He accepted the apology, yet the sorrow remained etched in the room's atmosphere, unwashed and permanent. [543]
"Enough," Silas barked, cutting the power. [549]
The field collapsed. [552]
The spirit dissipated instantly, sucked back into the ether, leaving the bottle empty and the room cold. [569]

Elena fell to her knees, weeping. [575]
"He didn't smile," she said brokenly. [581]
"A broken mirror reflects the light, but it doesn't show a clean image," Silas said, packing his copper coils. [599]
"You reconnected, you spoke, and he heard you; that is all the physics allows." [613]
He took his fee from the table, feeling the usual hollow ache of his profession. [628]
Just then, the silence outside shattered. [634]
The roar of chainsaws erupted from the orchard, the first tree screaming as it fell. [649]
The hush was over, the destruction had begun, and Silas Vane walked out into the debris of the morning, leaving the music and the ghosts behind in the dust. [678]
