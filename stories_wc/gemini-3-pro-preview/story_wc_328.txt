Elias knelt in the humid loam of the herbalist’s underground garden, his trowel scraping against something harder than a root. [19]
Above them, through twenty feet of rock and permafrost, the world lay under a siege of ice, but down here, the air smelled of wet earth and secrets. [47]
To the old herbalist, Silas, Elias was merely a drift-less wanderer seeking shelter, but in truth, he was a cryptid researcher documenting the anomalies that plagued the surface. [75]
These anomalies were not born of nature but were the result of the time after the missing return changed, when the thousands who had vanished reappeared as hollow, shifting geometries wearing familiar faces. [109]
Elias brushed the dirt from his discovery, revealing a jagged flint arrowhead, cold and sharp enough to sever the tenuous threads of reality. [132]
He pocketed the ancient weapon, his eyes darting to the corner of the garden where the "specimen" sat tied to a chair. [154]
It was—or had been—Silas’s brother, but now it was a vibrating blur of static and sorrow that refused to solidify. [175]
Elias felt a familiar surge of bitterness, a resentment that the universe had returned their loved ones as cosmic punchlines rather than people. [198]
Today, however, he intended to rewrite the gag. [207]
His motivation was specific: to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke, flipping the tragedy of these hollow returns into something absurdly vital. [229]
He moved toward the tangle of creeping ivy on the far wall, where he had hidden the device that Silas unwittingly kept as a keepsake. [254]
It was an old cordless phone, its plastic casing yellowed with age, the antenna bent like a broken finger. [273]
Elias pressed the talk button, and the air in the garden instantly grew heavy, then impossibly light, becoming gravitationally playful in a way that made his stomach flip. [301]
Dust motes danced in complex spirals, and a watering can drifted lazily upward, spinning like a slow top. [319]
This buoyancy was the precursor to the ritual he had designed. [330]
He knew the only way to reach the entity inside the brother was via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone, a frequency that bypassed the ears and vibrated the soul. [363]
Elias brought the receiver to his lips and began to whisper not prayers, but his darkest resentments, pouring his bile into the electronic hiss. [387]
He confessed how much he hated the hope that had curdled into horror, and as he spoke, the flint arrowhead in his pocket grew hot against his thigh. [415]
The static on the line shrieked back, a chorus of lost voices trying to find a shape. [432]
Elias pulled the flint out and sliced his own thumb, smearing the blood onto the phone’s charging contacts to ground the ethereal current. [455]
"Laugh," he commanded the void, "or be laughed at." [465]
The room tipped sideways as gravity released its hold entirely, leaving Elias and the shivering specimen floating amidst the suspended ferns. [486]
The energy in the room began to metamorphose, shifting from the grey despair of the void into a vibrant, chaotic spectrum of light. [509]
The brother’s form stopped flickering and exploded outward, not into gore, but into a cloud of butterflies made of light and sound. [531]
It was a harmony untamed, a wild, cacophonous music of existence that refused to be sad or structured. [549]
Elias floated near the ceiling, watching the swarm reintegrate into a man who was laughing, tears streaming down a face that was finally solid. [573]
The cosmic joke had landed; the universe had tried to offer a ghost, and Elias had forced it to deliver a miracle through sheer spite. [598]
As the gravity slowly reasserted itself, dropping them gently back to the loam, Elias looked at the phone, now dead and silent in his hand. [622]
The outside world remained a frozen wasteland, but here in the dirt, he nursed a fragile, frostbitten hope that perhaps the broken things could be put back together, even if the pieces didn't quite fit the way they used to. [662]
