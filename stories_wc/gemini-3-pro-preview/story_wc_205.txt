The baroque asteroid of Vermillion IV rotated slowly, a heavy jewel of carved obsidian and gold leaf suspended in the aching silence of space. [24]
Here, long after the universal constant shattered and Time became visible, the hours drifted through the streets like phosphorescent pollen. [44]
Elian stood by the high arched window, his silhouette framed against the swirling, luminous chronology outside. [60]
Once, he had been a firebrand, a commander of insurgents who sought to overthrow the stagnant order of the galaxy, but now he was merely a defunct revolutionary, exiled to this museum world of decaying grandeur. [96]
His heart was a vessel of burnished sorrow, polishing the grief of his failures until they shone with a terrible, heavy beauty. [118]

Behind him, Archivist Thorne cleared his throat, tapping a stylus against a datapad with irritating rhythmic precision. [135]
They were locked in a bitter archaeological dispute regarding the true nature of the Vermillion civilization. [151]
Thorne argued that the intricate ruins proved a history of rigid, authoritarian hierarchy, a justification for the current regime's oppression. [171]
Elian, however, sought to reimagine an entire civilization, insisting that the chaotic architecture was evidence of a radical, forgotten liberty. [191]
The old revolutionary refused to let the past be conscripted into the service of tyranny, even if he had to rewrite it himself. [214]

"The storm approaches, Elian," Thorne said, gesturing to the sky where the bands of visible Time were bruising into angry knots of purple and black. [239]
"We must secure the artifacts and retreat to the vault." [249]
Elian ignored the command, his poetically inclined mind seeing not a weather event, but a stanza of chaotic potential. [268]
"The gale sings of memory tonight," Elian murmured, his voice rough with the dust of years. [284]
He began moving through the grand salon, initiating the ancient method of covering mirrors during storms. [300]
It was an old superstition on the asteroid, born of the fear that a reflective surface caught in a chronal tempest might trap a soul in a loop, but Elian had a different purpose. [334]
He draped heavy brocade over the looking glasses, muting their silver tongues, leaving the room blind to its own reflection. [354]

"This is nonsense," Thorne scoffed, watching the revolutionary work with disdain. [365]
Elian paused, reaching into the pocket of his frayed coat to withdraw a jagged object. [380]
It was a crystal vase shard, a remnant of the very first uprising, its edge sharp enough to cut through the lies of history. [404]
The glass was not merely broken; it was faceted to catch the light of moments that had never officially happened. [424]
"You look at the strata and see a cage," Elian said, holding the shard up to the darkening window. [443]
"I look at the fragments and see a mosaic that has not yet been assembled." [458]

The storm broke, and the visible Time roared against the glass, a torrent of rushing images and ghostly light. [477]
Elian did not cower; instead, he began to devise a precise alignment of geometry and nostalgia. [493]
He positioned the crystal vase shard on a velvet pedestal in the center of the room, exactly where the singular uncovered ray from the storm would strike it. [521]
"Watch," Elian commanded, the authority of the general returning to his voice. [533]
The beam of raw, concentrated time hit the shard. [542]
Because the mirrors were covered, the light could not dissipate into infinite reflections of the present room. [559]
Instead, the shard refracted the chronal energy, splitting the storm's chaos into a coherent projection. [574]
The room dissolved. [577]
For a breathless minute, the air was filled not with Thorne's rigid hierarchies, but with Elian's vision: a spectral reenactment of the Vermillion people dancing in the streets, governed by love and erratic art, a society of beautiful anarchy. [616]
The shard amplified the revolutionary's memory, overwriting the ambient time with his desire. [629]
It was a fabrication, perhaps, but in a world where Time was visible matter, perception was reality. [646]

The image faded as the storm passed, leaving Thorne pale and shaken, his data corrupted by the undeniable beauty of what he had witnessed. [670]
Elian pocketed the shard, his hand trembling slightly. [678]
He had won the dispute not with facts, but with art. [689]
He sat in the dim light, a poet among the ruins, burdened by the victory of having forced the universe to dream his dream. [713]
The burnished sorrow returned, settling over him like gold dust, for he knew that even a reimagined past could not bring back the dead. [737]
