Elias hovered in the zero-gravity center of the Floating Observatory, listening to the ticking of contracting metal. [16]
The overload had tripped the safeties, plunging the station into a suffocating darkness while the circuit breakers cooled. [33]
Most men would scramble to restore life support, but Elias knew this specific, heavy silence was the only environment where the hunt could truly begin. [58]
He was a survivor of a drone strike wedding, a man carved out of the negative space left by the sudden erasure of eighty-three kin. [83]
Since that day, amid the smell of burning lace and ionized soil, he had become obsessed with the physics of the unhappened. [105]
He drifted toward the center console, his hand closing around the rough, jagged surface of the Geode crystal secured there. [125]
It was not merely a rock, but a lattice of chaotic variables, a physical anchor for the calculations running through his neural link. [148]
Elias sought to find where unused potential pools, to locate the reservoir of energy left behind when a future is violently amputated. [170]
The universe, he theorized, did not simply discard the momentum of lives cut short; it stored it, heavy and unseen, in the fabric of space. [195]
With the station’s hum silenced, he engaged his method, applying perturbation theory to the vacuum outside the viewing port. [214]
In physics, one solves a complex problem by starting with a simple system and adding small disturbances to see how it reacts. [236]
Elias tapped the Geode, sending a rhythmic, resonant frequency—a deliberate perturbation—out into the silent ionosphere. [253]
He watched the readout on his retinas, looking not for what was there, but for the mathematical ghosts of what should have been. [276]
A shiver of bleak exhilaration raced down his spine as the darkness outside began to ripple with a color the human eye was never meant to process. [302]
This was the unfiltered awakening he had chased for a decade, a tearing of the veil that separated the survivor from the dead. [325]
The sensation was intangibly tangible, a pressure against his chest that felt like the embrace of his bride, yet consisted only of cold radiation and math. [351]
He saw the timeline branch. [356]
In the perturbation patterns, the wedding continued. [363]
He saw the dance that never finished, the children never born, swirling in a vortex of pure, arrested possibility just outside the hull. [386]
The Geode amplified the resonance, its crystal structure organizing the chaotic potential into a terrifyingly clear vision. [403]
He was hunting the moment of divergence, trying to grab the energy of that lost trajectory. [419]
The joy was caustic, burning through him with the realization that this vibrant life existed only as a mathematical waste product of his tragedy. [443]
Tears floated from his eyes, suspended in the air, lenses distorting the spectral light of the ghosts. [460]
He pushed the perturbation deeper, aggressively, forcing the universe to account for the discrepancy of the massacre. [477]
The observatory groaned, the cooling breakers nearing their reset point, threatening to shatter the connection with the return of mundane electricity. [498]
Elias reached out, his fingers trembling as they brushed the cold glass of the viewport, trying to touch the face of the probability cloud. [522]
For a microsecond, the potential became real enough to hurt, a phantom limb of destiny reattached to his soul. [541]
Then, the breakers snapped back. [546]
The hum of the reactor roared to life, the artificial gravity seized him, and the unfiltered awakening collapsed under the weight of restored reality. [570]
The visions of the wedding vanished, retreating back into the unseen pools. [582]
Elias collapsed against the bulkhead, the Geode dull and inert in his grip. [595]
He was alone again, left with nothing but the humming machinery and the cold, hard truth of his survival. [614]
Yet, the exhilaration lingered, a toxic hope that fueled him. [624]
He knew where they were now. [630]
He reached for the override key to trip the system again, preparing to break the world just to see the beautiful ruins of what could have been. [657]
