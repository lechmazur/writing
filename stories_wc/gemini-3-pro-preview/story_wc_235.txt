The wind howled against the timber walls of the mountain ranger cabin, a sound that felt older than the earth itself. [21] I stared at the birch bark scroll pinned to the table, its surface pale and peeling like sunburned flesh. [39] My hand trembled as I gripped the charcoal, driven by a desperate need to distill chaos into narrative before the sun vanished again. [62] Yesterday, I found a mossy stone marker with my name carved into it, dated two years in the past. [81] Since seeing my own grave, the linear progression of hours has dissolved into a slurry of disjointed moments. [99] I am chronologically confused, unmoored in a timeline that no longer requires my heartbeat. [113]

To anchor myself, I force my mind backward, hunting for a version of myself that was still ignorant. [131] This is not a gentle remembrance, but a feral nostalgia that tears at my throat with wolfish teeth. [149] I crave the taste of the coffee I drank ten years ago, back when I believed the future was a promise rather than a threat. [174] It is a savage, violent longing for the days when I was unbroken. [187] My method for inducing the trance is specific and bitter: getting jealous of past selves who had the audacity to be happy. [209] I resent that younger man for his naive breath, for the blood that pumped without the heavy knowledge of this tombstone in the woods. [233]

The envy becomes a hook, dragging me out of the freezing cabin and into the velvet texture of the mind. [253] I am a lucid dream chronicler, a historian of the impossible, and I use my jealousy to breach the walls of memory. [275] The room dissolves into smoke, the smell of pine shifting to the ozone tang of the atmosphere. [292] I step out of the memory and into the construction of the dream, fully aware that I am the architect. [312] The world here is vibrant, painted in colors that the waking eye is too weary to perceive. [329] It is a landscape of jaded wonder, where I can admire the majesty of a purple sun while cynically noting the cracks in the sky’s rendering. [355] I have seen too many miracles in this headspace to be purely awestruck, yet the beauty still commands a weary reverence. [376]

Gravity here is a suggestion I choose to ignore, shedding the weight of my confused timeline like a heavy coat. [396] With a thought, I push off the phantom ground and soar upward, rocketing past the peaks of the mountains that cage my physical body. [420] The wind rushes against my face, not cold like the cabin’s draft, but warm and singing with the voices of everything I have lost. [444] I fly over forests that twist into cities and rivers that flow with liquid starlight. [459] To soar is to briefly escape the paradox of being a dead man walking, a momentary rebellion against the stone marker waiting in the brush. [484] I look down at the tapestry of my subconscious, watching scenes of my life play out in non-linear loops. [503] There is the child crying over a scraped knee, and there is the old man I will never become, sitting on a porch that doesn't exist. [529]

But the jealousy that fueled the flight eventually burns out, leaving only the cold ash of reality. [546] The dream fractures, the purple sun flickering out as the damp chill of the ranger cabin reasserts its dominance. [565] I wake with a gasp, the chronological confusion settling back over me like a wet blanket. [581] Was that dream seconds ago, or have days passed while I navigated the ether? [595] It does not matter, for the duty remains. [603] I reach for the birch bark scroll, the texture rough against my fingertips. [616] I must document the flight, capturing the coordinates of that impossible sky. [628] The charcoal scratches loudly in the silence, darker than the shadows gathering in the corners. [643] By inscribing the dream onto the wood, I force the universe to acknowledge my presence, even if my grave argues otherwise. [664] This act of writing is the only thing that feels linear, a straight line drawn through the tangle of time. [684] I am a ghost haunting my own history, writing down the evidence of my flight so that I might remember, tomorrow or yesterday, that I once knew how to fly. [714] The nostalgia subsides, sated for the moment, leaving me alone with the words and the winter dark. [731]
