The humid air inside the Velvet Observatory hung heavy with the scent of dust and overripe fruit. [17]
Elian pressed his fingers against his temples, trying to dampen the psychic noise radiating from the climbing ivy that strangled the observatory’s iron pillars. [41]
It was a curse to be accidentally telepathic with plants, especially during Midsummer when their growth lust was a deafening roar of green ambition. [65]
He was a provenance researcher by trade, a man hired to trace the bloodlines of objects, but tonight his focus was singular. [87]
Before him rested the Emperor’s prize, a transparent violin made of ice crystal, glistening with a supernatural frost that ignored the sweltering July night. [111]
The artifact was perfect, cold, and silent, the exact opposite of the chaotic, verdant voices shouting in Elian’s mind. [130]
He felt a deep, bruising sadness in his ribs, a mulberry ache that throbbed whenever he looked at the frozen instrument. [151]
His mission was theoretically simple: certify the violin’s origin to solidify the Empire’s claim on the northern territories. [169]
However, his true motivation was far more treasonous; he was there to weigh a dream against an empire. [187]
The dream was a world where the wild things were free to speak, while the empire sought to freeze everything into silent obedience. [210]
Elian picked up his small demitasse, the porcelain warm against his sweating palm. [223]
He had learned long ago that official records were lies, so he sought the truth by reading the future in coffee stains. [245]
Swirling the dark dregs, he peered into the cup, looking for the shape of things to come. [262]
What he saw was not a solid path, but a perforated destiny, a timeline moth-eaten and full of holes. [281]
These gaps were opportunities, little voids where the Empire’s rigid control had not yet solidified. [296]
The ivy on the walls sensed his hesitation and screamed a chorus of encouragement. [310]
They told him he had to act now, in this fragile hour before the promise loses its glow. [328]
If he waited until dawn, the violin would be locked away, and its chilling influence would spread across the land like a blight. [351]
Elian looked at the ice violin, seeing the ancient water trapped within it, water that yearned to rejoin the cycle of life. [373]
He realized that he could not merely destroy it; he had to transform it. [387]
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a single, dried seed he had found in the ruins of a forgotten garden. [409]
The coffee grounds had shown him the exact hole in destiny where this seed could fit. [425]
With trembling hands, he opened the glass case, the cold air biting his skin. [439]
The violin hummed a low, resonant frequency that made his teeth ache. [451]
He needed to propagate a new reality, one root at a time. [463]
Elian placed the seed upon the bridge of the ice violin. [474]
He poured the dregs of his coffee over the seed and the ice, the warm liquid hissing as it met the frozen surface. [497]
The caffeine-rich sludge seeped into the microscopic fissures of the crystal. [508]
The ivy in the room fell silent, holding its breath. [518]
Suddenly, the seed split. [522]
Drawing upon the supernatural preservation magic of the violin, it did not just grow; it erupted. [538]
Roots drove themselves into the ice, drinking the ancient water and cracking the pristine surface with the violence of life. [558]
The transparent violin shattered, not into noise, but into a cascade of melting slush that nourished the exploding vine. [577]
Elian watched as the green shoots twisted to mimic the violin’s curves, replacing the cold dead crystal with living, breathing wood. [598]
The provenance of the object had been irrevocably altered. [607]
He had chosen the messy, overgrown dream over the sterile perfection of the empire. [621]
The mulberry ache in his chest softened into a sweet, ripe relief. [633]
Outside, the midsummer sun began to crest the horizon, illuminating a world that was no longer frozen, but wildly, uncontrollably alive. [654]
