The midnight glade above the clouds exhaled a choking beauty, its obsidian branches twisting under a moon that bloated the sky like a bruised lung. [18]
Lirien, the onyx-ink cartomancer, collapsed onto dew-slick moss, her body still echoing the violent rupture of birth just hours before. [36]
Her daughter, slick and mewling, latched to her breast as she unfastened her bodice with trembling fingers, the cool air knifing through the exposed skin. [54]
It was after the birth—after that tear-streaked expulsion into a world already heavy with her regrets—that Lirien had dragged herself skyward, compelled to find where lost time accumulates. [82]
Years stolen by her cartomancy, futures glimpsed in onyx-ink spreads that left the present a hollowed husk, now demanded reckoning. [102]
Cloudbound repentance called her here, this floating glade where penitents bartered regrets for stolen moments trapped in vapor. [123]
She was willingly perplexed, embracing the fog of confusion as her truest sight, for clarity had long betrayed her. [143]
From her satchel, she withdrew the birthday tablecloth, yellowed linen embroidered with generations of inked palms—a family custom of tracing hands to map the soul's journey. [171]
Her own tiny handprint from childhood grinned up from one corner, smudged where she'd spilled ink pretending to divine fates with dolls. [194]
Beside it lay the cracked saucer from her dolls’ tea set, its porcelain fissure a lightning bolt from the day she'd hurled it in rage at her mother's warnings. [221]
That crack had never mended, widening like a grudge, holding secrets of time she'd flung away. [240]
Spreading the tablecloth across the glade's root-woven altar, Lirien traced her own hand first, palm splayed amid starry moss that pulsed with ethereal light. [263]
The ink from her onyx vial bled into the fabric, black veins seeking the paths her life had abandoned. [284]
Then, gently lifting her daughter, she pressed the infant's minuscule fist to the cloth, completing the triad: child, mother, ghost of girlhood. [308]
Vapors thickened, the glade's beauty strangling her throat with perfumed mist that tasted of forgotten laughter and milk-warm dawns. [333]
She inked her cards next, onyx-black symbols swirling on bone-white stock, shuffling with hands that shook from blood loss and awe. [356]
The spread bloomed before her: The Hanged Time, reversed; The Accumulating Veil; her daughter's tiny handprint mirroring the queen of clouds. [381]
Willingly perplexed, she refused to parse the riddles cleanly, letting their tangle burrow into her mind like roots through soil. [404]
"What penance for the hours I devoured?" she whispered, voice choking on the glade's opulent haze. [425]
The saucer crack glowed faintly, drawing her eye—inside its fracture, motes of light danced, shards of lost birthdays shimmering. [450]
Her mother's voice echoed in memory: "Trace the hands, child, and time reveals its hoard." [469]
Those customs, once dismissed, now anchored her, the tablecloth a compass in the choking splendor. [489]
Lirien pried at the saucer's rim, unfastening a hidden hinge her child-self had sealed with wax after the break. [510]
A sliver of clockwork tumbled free—a tiny brass mechanism, family heirloom ticking with pilfered seconds from every traced birthday. [535]
It was where lost time accumulates: not in ether, but in these intimate relics, bound to bloodlines and rituals. [557]
Tears blurred the cards as repentance flooded her, cloudbound and irrevocable, the glade's beauty a velvet noose tightening with forgiveness. [584]
She wound the mechanism into her daughter's swaddling, the ticks syncing with the baby's breath. [603]
Visions clarified in her willed perplexity: futures reclaimed, not stolen, hands intertwined across tablecloths yet to be traced. [627]
The glade sighed, vapors parting to reveal a dawn-streaked horizon below the clouds. [646]
Lirien rose, tablecloth bundled anew with saucer and cards, the weight of accumulated time now a promise rather than a curse. [671]
Her daughter's eyes fluttered open, holding galaxies undimmed by theft. [686]
In that gaze, repentance solidified, cloudbound no more, as mother and child descended into the waking world. [707]
The choking beauty lingered in her lungs, a reminder that some beauties must strangle before they set you free. [735]
Tracing hands had mapped not loss, but return—the family's custom weaving her fragmented life whole. [754]
Lirien smiled through the mist, perplexed no longer by choice, but by grace. [772]
