In the sunken city ruins of Aqualis, after the plague had finally sputtered out like a drowned fire, the waters receded just enough to expose jagged spires and choked boulevards. [18]
Elias, a wannabe philosopher hunkered in a sewer conduit that once flushed the elite's waste into the sea, scratched manifestos on slime-slick walls with a shard of bone. [42]
He was rationally rebellious, scorning the surface scavengers' babble about rebirth through catastrophe, their competing narratives that painted the plague as a merciful reset. [78]
To Elias, those tales were abrasive nonsense, calm in their idiocy, ignoring the ancient methods of chronometry that had mapped the stars before hubris submerged the city. [113]
His motivation burned simple: preserve those methods, lest the world forget how to measure time without superstition's fog. [136]
One dawn, as bioluminescent fungi pulsed like false heartbeats, Elias unearthed a seafarer’s chronometer cog from the muck—a brass tooth etched with nautical almanacs, survivor of salt and pressure. [174]
It ticked faintly in his palm, a relic from galleons that once plied skies turned oceanic. [190]
But holding it, he began to agonize, the cog's grooves mirroring fractures in his certainty. [206]
Competing narratives clashed: the surface cult claimed the cog's makers had angered the depths with precise clocks defying divine chaos, justifying the flood. [239]
Elias countered rationally—those clocks preserved trade winds' truths, ancient methods chaining rebellion to logic, not gods. [265]
Yet doubt gnawed; what if their narrative held, and his preservation was futile rebellion? [284]
"Abrasive calm settles nothing," he muttered to the dripping arches, voice echoing like gravel in a sieve. [305]
He paced his sewer warren, the cog clutched tight, agonizing over erasure. [320]
Surface envoys had ascended ruins weeks prior, preaching unity under their plague-god myth, offering trinkets for conversion. [347]
Elias had rebuffed them calmly but with barbs: "Your stories bury time; mine exhumes it." [368]
Now, the cog demanded proof—his narrative couldn't compete on whispers alone. [383]
Rationally rebellious, he resolved to delve deeper, through sedimentary layers compressing centuries like forgotten grudges. [406]
The method was methodical: probe the silt with a jury-rigged auger from plumbing scraps, sifting truth from lies layer by layer. [431]
First stratum: plague ash, black and bitter, narratives of mass graves whispered in bones. [450]
Elias agonized there, cog in one hand, ash in the other—did it prove divine wrath or quarantined folly? [476]
He pressed on, abrasive calm steeling him: "Narratives compete; evidence crowns." [492]
Second layer: compacted rubble from the flood's first surge, shattered astrolabes glinting. [510]
Here, ancient methods gleamed—star charts etched on slate, defying the cult's chaos tale. [527]
But agony twisted anew; surface spies might call this forgery, their narrative elastic as kelp. [546]
Third layer, deepest: primordial ooze hugging bedrock, where the cog's twin awaited, fused in a chronometer frame amid logbooks. [574]
He excavated frantically yet calmly, silt caking his beard, heart pounding against rational resolve. [592]
The logs chronicled pre-plague voyages, precise timings preserving trade secrets against storms. [610]
No gods, just methods—wind vectors, lunar ticks, human defiance scripted in ink. [627]
Elias agonized one final beat: integrate or isolate? [638]
Rationally, he chose fusion, wedding the cog to the frame with sewer wire. [651]
It whirred to life, hands sweeping decayed but defiant arcs. [663]
Now armed, his narrative sharpened, he would surface not to convert but confront, preserving ancient methods through abrasive calm exposure. [690]
Competing tales would fracture against this tick—plague as pestilence, flood as folly, time as conqueror. [710]
In his sewer throne, Elias etched the cog's verdict: "Rebellion rationalizes truth." [726]
The sunken city stirred faintly, ruins exhaling secrets through sedimentary scars. [741]
Surface winds carried his first broadcast echo, a philosopher's rasp amid the calm. [758]
Elias smiled thinly, cog pulsing like a second pulse. [767]
Preservation begun; narratives competed, but his endured. [777]
