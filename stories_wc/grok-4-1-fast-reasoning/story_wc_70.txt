The nectar dusk settled over the city like spilled honey, thick and golden, after the blackout plunged everything into shadow. [15]
Lightning arced faintly from the collection tower's spires, now useless sentinels against the bruised sky. [32]
Elias, the candid toll keeper at the tower's base, wiped sweat from his brow, his booth a rickety cage of iron and glass. [51]
Cursed years ago by a traveling sorcerer, Elias was involuntarily truthful; every question pulled the stark facts from his lips like venom from a wound. [74]
He hated it—his bluntness had cost him friends, lovers, even the wonder of simple conversations. [92]
Yet tonight, with the city's hum silenced and weary souls lining up to pay the toll for a glimpse inside the tower, Elias felt a deeper pull. [118]
His motivation burned steady: to preserve wonder in routine, to remind folks that even in mechanical drudgery, magic lingered. [141]
The line shuffled forward, faces etched with the dull ache of repeated failures. [159]
Mira, a sharp-eyed technician with grease-streaked overalls, slapped her coins down. [177]
"What's the real story up there?" [182]
she demanded, nodding at the tower's glowing apex, where the drone beehive thrummed weakly. [205]
Elias opened his mouth, the truth surging unbidden. [214]
"The drone beehive failure," [217]
he blurted, voice gravelly. [221]
Mira leaned in, eyes narrowing. [226]
"Details, toll man. [229]
No games." [231]
The curse clawed deeper; he couldn't dodge, couldn't pretty it up. [243]
But as nectar dusk deepened, painting her face in amber, Elias saw her routine weariness—the spark dimmed by endless repairs. [269]
He reached under the booth, fingers closing on the lacquer box, its black sheen mirroring the dying light like captured night. [294]
This heirloom, carved by his grandfather, held his one workaround for the curse: truths wrapped in riddles. [316]
Not lies, but veils thin enough to tease the mind. [325]
"Take this," [327]
he said, sliding the lacquer box across the scarred wood. [338]
Mira frowned but pocketed her change and pried it open. [349]
Nestled inside was a battered matchbox, its striker worn from old fires. [362]
She flipped the tiny lid, revealing a scrap of paper inked with cramped script. [378]
"A cryptic riddle?" [381]
she scoffed, but unfolded it anyway. [387]
Elias watched, heart steady. [391]
"Read it aloud," [393]
he urged, truthful even in urging. [398]
Her voice cut the dusk: "In waxen halls where tempests breed, / Drones danced on lightning's nectar feed. [419]
No queenly spark to birth the swarm, / Their failure cloaks the tower's storm. [435]
Strike true to light the hidden hive, / Or darkness claims the golden strive." [453]
Mira's breath hitched, the words sinking in like roots. [464]
The drone beehive—massive, hexagonal core of the tower, alive with bio-engineered drones. [485]
They swarmed the collector rods, bodies charged by lightning, pollinating the central queen crystal with electric nectar that powered the city. [513]
Without drones, no reproduction, no fresh charges; the queen starved, blackout inevitable. [532]
She'd suspected sabotage, but this... a biological collapse, elegant and cruel. [548]
"Why riddle it?" [550]
Mira asked, pocketing the matchbox. [556]
Elias met her gaze, curse be damned. [563]
"Because truth raw kills wonder," [567]
he said candidly. [570]
"Routine blinds us—bolts, wires, humdrum toil. [583]
But this? [585]
Drones failing like forgotten bees in dusk? [593]
It sparks the old mysteries, makes you climb that tower not just to fix, but to chase lightning's ghost." [619]
Mira stared at the lacquer box, now hers, its weight a promise. [632]
The nectar dusk deepened to velvet, stars pricking through. [643]
She paid extra toll, waved off change, and started up the spiral stairs. [658]
Elias leaned back, a rare smile cracking his face. [667]
Another routine shattered, wonder preserved. [674]
High above, Mira struck the matchbox—sparks flew, illuminating the riddle anew. [691]
The reveal hit her full: not just failure, but a cycle begging rebirth. [707]
She'd seed new drones from the queen's fading nectar, restore the hive. [721]
Below, Elias tallied the till, the line moving with fresh murmurs. [735]
In nectar dusk's embrace, the tower whispered secrets, routine laced with electric honey. [753]
The city would hum again, but changed—wonder toll paid in full. [767]
