In the skyborne grotto suspended amid eternal clouds, where the aurora wove rivers of light across the vaulted ceiling, a radiant hush enveloped all things. [22]
Lirien, the beautician mortician of this liminal realm, moved with deliberate grace among her charges, those who had plummeted from the sky islands in fatal leaps or quiet fades. [47]
Timeless here, no sun marked hours, no stars wheeled; only the aurora's ceaseless dance measured existence. [70]
Her role demanded duality: for the newly arrived, still clinging to breath, she beautified with luminescent powders and silken threads, restoring fleeting dignity before the end. [101]
For the departed, she mortified with solemn rites, adorning their forms in crystalline shrouds to ease their drift into the void below. [127]
Lirien herself teetered on oblivion's edge, her own spark dimming after eons of service, motivation burning fierce—to capture one last spark before her own nothingness claimed her. [162]
Lucidly watchful, she scanned the grotto's heart, where a final charge lay upon an alabaster slab: an elder skyfarer, body slack at the threshold of stillness, that perilous boundary where motion yielded utterly to calm. [204]
The elder's chest rose one faltering time, then stilled; yet Lirien sensed the spark lingered, faint as auroral whisper. [229]
In her palm rested the emerald chip, pried from the skyfarer's amulet—a verdant shard pulsing with captured skyfire, the last relic of his vibrant voyages. [260]
To infuse it with that dying spark would preserve a fragment of life eternal, a beacon against her encroaching oblivion. [286]
But extraction demanded precision; the method was finding patterns in static, the grotto's ambient hum of suspended ethers manifesting as flickering voids between auroral veils. [321]
Lirien positioned herself at the slab's edge, eyes narrowing to slits of lucid watchfulness, piercing the hush. [343]
She attuned to the static: faint crackles in the air, like distant thunder trapped in crystal, birthing random flecks across her vision. [373]
Breathe steady, she sifted chaos, seeking order—the method of ancients, where mortals glimpsed divine geometry amid noise. [401]
Patterns emerged: spirals mirroring aurora coils, fractals echoing the grotto's vine-laced walls, threads linking the elder's fading pulse to the chip's glow. [435]
One pattern sharpened—a helix of emerald light threading from heart to shard, pulsing thrice before fraying. [458]
This was the spark, raw vitality defying the threshold's pull. [473]
With trembling precision, Lirien extended her beautician's tools: a fine needle of frozen dew, dipped in mortician's elixir of phosphor bloom. [501]
She pierced the pattern's core, channeling the static's weave into the emerald chip. [517]
Infuse, she whispered, her voice a hush within hush, willing the spark to flood the shard. [534]
The chip flared, absorbing the helix; veins of viridian fire coursed through it, capturing the elder's last essence—memories of wind-swept flights, laughter in storms. [568]
The threshold crossed; the elder's form gleamed serene, released to drift. [581]
Lirien clutched the chip, its warmth a lifeline against her own dimming. [593]
Yet as aurora intensified, static surged wilder, patterns fracturing under new strain. [612]
Her watchfulness pierced deeper; she glimpsed her reflection in the chip—a spectral self, spark nearly spent. [636]
Desperation honed her: another pattern, subtler, her own spark mirroring the elder's. [651]
She poised the needle again, turning inward, finding the static's personal cadence—echoes of her beautified living, her mortified dead. [680]
Infuse now her own fading light, threading it into the chip alongside his. [692]
Pain lanced; brilliance erupted, the emerald chip blazing like a newborn aurora. [708]
The grotto trembled faintly, hush deepening to reverence as dual sparks fused, defying oblivion. [727]
Lirien rose, vital once more, the beautician mortician renewed. [737]
She placed the chip at the grotto's nexus, where it hung suspended, a eternal ward. [752]
Under the aurora's approving veil, the threshold of stillness held no terror now. [768]
In radiant hush, her lucid vigil continued, sparks captured forever. [779]
