Elias Kane trudged through the radioactive dust storms of the wasteland, his breather mask fogged with grit. [10]
As a conspiracy debunker, he had made a career after the liquidation debunking tales that kept survivors huddled in their bunkers. [28]
The Great Liquidation of 2047 had wiped out global economies, unleashing experimental warheads that scarred the earth with fallout. [50]
Now, whispers spread of miracles amid the desolation, and Elias's sharply observant eyes pierced those comfortable lies to excavate the truth. [72]
His latest target: the Orchard of Eternity, a thriving grove of apple trees in the heart of the poisoned badlands. [91]
Defying logic, it bloomed green against the swirling ochre storms, its fruits plump and untainted. [109]
Locals spun yarns of a cursed diamond buried at its root, flawed and shimmering with malevolent power that shielded the trees. [131]
Elias scoffed inwardly; curses were the opium of the irradiated. [141]
He needed proof to shatter the myth and reveal whatever tech or trick sustained this anomaly. [162]
The storms battered his rad-suit as he crested a dune, the orchard's silhouette emerging like a defiant oasis. [182]
No birds sang here, but the air hummed with an unnatural calm, a hidden stillpoint where dust devils died unborn. [205]
Elias paused, his keen gaze noting the perfect circular boundary: chaos outside, serenity within. [225]
He crossed the threshold, mask readings dropping to safe levels instantly. [236]
Apples dangled heavy from branches unscarred by fallout; he plucked one, its skin flawless under his light. [257]
At the center stood a crumbling homestead, door ajar from looters post-liquidation. [272]
The owner, Dr. Lena Voss, had vanished in the chaos, her assets liquidated for debts. [290]
Elias entered, boots crunching on debris. [297]
His sharp eyes caught confetti-like shreds littering the floor—shredded letters, methodically destroyed. [317]
Conspiracy peddlers claimed Voss summoned the curse with occult rites. [330]
Elias knelt, gloved fingers sifting the fragments amid dust bunnies. [342]
His motivation burned: to unearth truth from these comforting fables that bred dependency on superstition. [364]
Piece by piece, his observant mind cataloged edges, inks, and watermarks. [379]
Hours blurred under his portable lamp as he reassembled them on a scavenged table. [395]
The first letter pieced together: a plea to creditors, begging time for her "stillpoint generator." [418]
Elias's pulse quickened; no curse, but science. [427]
Next fragments: blueprints sketches, mentioning a "flawed diamond lattice" as the core lens. [448]
He intuited the setup— Voss hadn't fled; she'd engineered this haven. [460]
More shreds aligned: "The diamond's imperfection refracts gamma waves into a stable field, creating a hidden stillpoint." [488]
Elias leaned back, mind racing. [494]
The cursed diamond wasn't hexed; it was a synthetic crystal, flawed by design to bend radiation into harmless harmonics. [517]
Planted at the orchard's heart, it generated a dome of calm, a stillpoint anchoring thriving life amid storms. [538]
Post-liquidation scavengers spread curse rumors to scare off rivals, preserving their secret harvest. [558]
But Voss's letters revealed sabotage: creditors, knowing her breakthrough, liquidated her to seize the tech. [580]
She'd shredded these confessions before hiding the diamond deeper. [592]
Elias's sharp observance spotted a loose floorboard, nudged by his boot. [606]
Prying it up, he unearthed the object—a grapefruit-sized gem, milky with internal fractures, pulsing faintly blue. [629]
No curse, just quantum wizardry born of desperation. [638]
He intuited the full peril: if he debunked publicly without safeguards, warlords would claim it, turning stillpoint into weapon. [664]
The comfortable lie protected the orchard; truth could doom it. [676]
Elias hesitated, apple still in hand, its juice sweet on his tongue. [689]
For the first time, he questioned his crusade. [698]
Reburying the diamond, he pocketed a single letter fragment as proof for himself. [713]
Exiting into the storm, the stillpoint's calm lingered in his veins. [725]
Elias Kane, debunker, walked away silent. [734]
Some truths were too fragile for the wasteland's winds. [745]
The orchard thrived on, its secret intact. [752]
In the howling dust, he pondered: was the real conspiracy his own unyielding quest? [771]
After the liquidation, survival sometimes demanded comfortable lies. [784]
He pressed on, mask fogging once more. [791]
The stillpoint faded behind him, a hidden truth unearthed and reburied. [806]
