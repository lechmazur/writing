Elara had always heard the old buildings whisper. [7]
In the creaks of settling beams and the sighs of warped floorboards, she sensed a language long forgotten, urging her to decipher it. [25]
Her motivation burned fiercely: to learn this tongue of stone and timber, hidden in the city's decaying tenements. [45]
When she moved into the crumbling Victorian on Elm Street, the murmurs grew insistent. [61]
Next door lived Professor Harlan Voss, a reclusive dead language tutor whose reputation preceded him like dust motes in sunlight. [85]
One evening, desperate for sugar to brew tea amid her frantic note-taking on architectural groans, Elara knocked on his door. [108]
He answered with a mysteriously familiar smile, as if they'd shared secrets in another life. [127]
"Of course," he said, handing over a tin, his fingers patiently nimble as they brushed hers. [146]
That simple borrowing of sugar blossomed into weekly tea sessions, a ritual sealing their peculiar bond. [167]
Harlan's parlor, cluttered with tomes on Sumerian ciphers and Etruscan runes, became her sanctuary. [187]
He taught her fragments of extinct dialects, his voice a low hum echoing the buildings' cadence. [207]
Yet beneath the lessons lay an undercurrent of agreed upon lies—they both pretended his knowledge stopped at parchment, not the living breath of edifices. [236]
Elara played along, nodding as he dismissed her theories of murmuring walls as fancy. [253]
Harlan, ever the patient tutor, would seal each session's notes with his antique desk seal, its brass lion's head pressing crimson wax with exquisite care. [282]
The seal, heirloom from a long-lost archaeologist ancestor, bore faint inscriptions that danced like the buildings' whispers. [302]
His patiently nimble hands worked it flawlessly, betraying a dexterity honed by years of delicate decipherment. [322]
Week after week, teas deepened their mysterious familiarity; she'd recount a floorboard's moan, he'd counter with a dead tongue's echo, both veiling deeper truths. [351]
Elara's motive sharpened—she suspected Harlan held the key to the language of old buildings, not dusty academia, but something arcane. [377]
One night, as the Perseid meteor shower lit the sky, Harlan invited her to the rooftop garden atop their shared building. [398]
Blankets strewn amid potted herbs and trellises heavy with night-blooming jasmine, they settled with steaming mugs. [419]
Streaks of fire rained down, mirroring the urgency in Elara's chest. [433]
The building beneath them groaned in harmony, louder now, as if the celestial display awakened it. [452]
"I've humored your fancies long enough," Harlan said, his eyes reflecting falling stars. [470]
But Elara, driven by her unyielding motivation, turned the tables. [483]
"Tell me the truth, Professor," she pressed, her voice steady as she began to interrogate him. [502]
He chuckled softly, that familiar mystery in his gaze, fingers tracing the antique desk seal in his pocket. [523]
"You think the buildings speak a dead language?" he parried, but she leaned closer. [541]
"I've heard them call your name in the walls—Harlan Voss, keeper of their tongue." [559]
He paused, patiently nimble mind weighing her words amid the meteor-lit haze. [575]
Their agreed upon lies cracked like old plaster. [584]
"We both know it's more," she interrogated further, grasping his wrist. [598]
"The seal—its inscriptions aren't Etruscan; they're the lexicon of bricks and mortar." [616]
Harlan's facade wavered, the rooftop garden swirling in cosmic glow. [630]
"You borrowed sugar to breach my door, teas to mine my secrets," he admitted softly. [647]
"But I welcomed it, Elara, because you hear them too." [660]
The shower intensified, stars plummeting like revelations. [672]
"I was a linguist once, purely," he confessed under her relentless questioning. [689]
"Then the buildings chose me—their language isn't dead; it's dormant, awakened by those like us." [710]
Elara's heart raced; her motive crystallized in his words. [723]
"Teach me fully," she demanded, interrogating the shadows of his past. [737]
He drew the antique desk seal, pressing it into her palm—its warmth pulsed like a heartbeat. [755]
"Tonight, under the stars, our lies dissolve," he whispered, mysteriously familiar as kin. [772]
The garden thrummed with the old tongue, now theirs to share. [785]
As meteors faded, Elara spoke her first fluent phrase to the building, and it replied in kind. [802]
