The farmhouse crouched under the giant wind turbines, their blades carving slow arcs through the endless gray sky. [13]
Shadows flickered across the sagging porch like ghosts fleeing dawn. [20]
It was after the happiness mandate, when the world had been force-fed joy through pills and broadcasts until the collectives crumbled under suppressed sobs. [45]
Now, an emotional void lingered, thicker than the turbine hum that remade the old wind hush into a mechanical drone. [64]
In the dim kitchen, the blank-faced performer sat at a scarred table, knife in hand. [75]
Her face was a mask of smooth porcelain vacancy, eyes flat as polished stone. [86]
Before her lay a dried flower bouquet, brittle stems tied with faded ribbon, gathered from a grave long overgrown. [101]
She had plucked them herself, after the deed, her hands steady despite the morally ambiguous mercy she had granted her husband. [119]
The mandate had twisted him into perpetual grins, but inside he rotted; she had ended it quietly, a needle in the night, freeing him from the lie. [141]
Was it love or murder? [144]
She never decided. [146]
To cultivate lightness in grief, she performed now, alone, for the shadows. [157]
Her method was to dramatically narrate mundane tasks, infusing the ordinary with tragic grandeur. [170]
"Behold," she intoned, voice rising like a forgotten opera, "the whittle begins!" [185]
The knife bit into the soft pine branch, shavings curling like pale whispers onto the table. [196]
"From this humble wood, I sculpt the blade of fate, mirroring the titans above that overshadow our fragile hearth!" [215]
The turbines' remade hush throbbed through the walls, a constant underscore to her soliloquy. [227]
She paused, glancing at the bouquet, petals crumbling at the edges like memories under pressure. [240]
"In the era after the mandate," she continued, gesturing grandly with the knife, "we sift through voids, seeking sparks!" [260]
Her blade danced, paring away bark in precise strokes, the wood taking shape—a miniature turbine blade, fierce and indifferent. [276]
"Feel the resistance yield! [279]
Each chip a relinquished sorrow, lightened by the carve!" [289]
Grief coiled in her chest, heavy as the farmhouse beams, but she narrated it away, voice swelling. [301]
Her blank face never twitched; performance demanded detachment. [307]
Outside, a turbine groaned louder, its hum warping the hush into a dirge. [317]
She whittled faster. [319]
"See here, the curve of inevitability!" [325]
The knife slipped once, nicking her thumb; a bead of blood welled, indifferent as rain. [336]
She licked it clean, unbroken in rhythm. [339]
"The bouquet watches, desiccated sentinel of what was," she proclaimed, lifting the flowers dramatically. [354]
"Dried blooms from the plot where happiness failed him!" [362]
Petals dusted the table, mingling with shavings. [367]
Her motivation burned beneath the void: to etch lightness into mourning's weight, one narrated task at a time. [383]
The whittled blade emerged, smooth and lethal, a tiny echo of the giants blotting her sky. [394]
"Thus, I remake the hush!" [398]
She held it aloft, the turbine drone swelling as if in applause. [407]
The blank-faced performer placed the carving beside the bouquet, their forms a still life of loss remade. [421]
"Lightness cultivated," she whispered theatrically, though her voice cracked the void ever so slightly. [435]
But no tears came. [438]
The emotional void held firm. [442]
She rose, knife sheathed, and shuffled to the window. [450]
Turbines loomed, eternal, their shadows racing like unbidden thoughts. [459]
In the distance, another farmhouse mirrored hers, another soul perhaps performing in silence. [472]
She returned to the table, selecting another branch. [478]
"Act two commences," she declared, blank face unchanging. [485]
The knife kissed wood again. [489]
"Whittle forth the petals of forgetfulness!" [496]
Shavings piled higher, a snow of detachment. [501]
The bouquet seemed to nod, morally ambiguous in its mute witness. [509]
Had she honored or betrayed? [512]
The whittle continued, narrating the churn of butter next, though no churn stood ready. [525]
"Churn the cream of regret into golden denial!" [533]
Her arms mimed the motion, dramatic sweeps filling the kitchen. [541]
The remade hush enveloped her, turbines weaving white noise into the performance. [551]
Grief lightened, not vanished—a feather now, not stone. [557]
She completed the petal carving, fragile whorls beside the dried flowers. [565]
"Behold the union: flora and forge, hush remade light!" [574]
The blank-faced performer sat back, surveying her work. [581]
The void pulsed, emotional and empty. [585]
Outside, turbines spun on, post-mandate sentinels of enforced calm. [595]
She gathered the bouquet and carvings, tying them with the ribbon. [604]
A new talisman born of whittle and word. [609]
Lightness bloomed faintly in her chest, cultivated against the weight. [620]
Her face remained blank, the performer's creed. [625]
Tomorrow, another task narrated, another layer peeled. [633]
The farmhouse sighed under turbine shadow. [639]
She extinguished the lamp. [643]
Darkness fell, hush remade once more. [649]
In that emotional void, lightness lingered, morally ambiguous as mercy. [662]
The end. [664]
