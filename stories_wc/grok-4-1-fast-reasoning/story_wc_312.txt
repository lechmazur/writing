Dawn's first blush painted the sapphire viaduct in hues of ethereal blue, its crystalline arches spanning the now-silent sea far below. [12]
From the depths, a fisherman's triumphant yet mournful cry echoed up: "The last fish is caught!" [24]
This marked the end of the Leviathan shoals, whose ceaseless swimming had long stabilized the cosmic tides binding sea to stars. [43]
Without them, imbalance rippled outward, stars winking erratically like faulty lanterns. [52]
Elowen, the lukewarm mage, stood at the viaduct's apex, his earnestly naive eyes wide with unshakeable faith in his feeble gifts. [70]
He was no archmage of legend, his spells flickering like half-hearted candle flames, yet his devotion burned with brittle intensity—a fragile vow to the old maritime rites his grandmother had whispered. [95]
That devotion teetered on shattering; one doubt, and it would crumble. [103]
But the cosmic wrongness gnawed at him, demanding he act. [110]
To right it, he believed, required rebuilding the broken ship's bell, relic of the Stormwraith, wedged into the viaduct's railing from a cataclysmic wreck centuries ago. [133]
The bell's final toll had once harmonized the spheres; now cracked and mute, it leaked a viscous hum—essence of drowned sailors' oaths—dripping in erratic patters. [155]
Elowen clutched his worn satchel, heart pounding with naive certainty that his lukewarm arts could suffice. [170]
He approached the bell, its bronze fractured like a beggar's promise, sapphire dew from the viaduct condensing on its surface in the chill dawn air. [193]
The viaduct wept these tears perpetually, each drop's fall calibrated to the universe's pulse—a secret his grandmother claimed mirrored cosmic equilibrium. [217]
Before the fish vanished, drips fell in steady rhythm, syncing sea and sky. [228]
Now, post-last-fish chaos skewed them: fast, then slow, betraying the imbalance. [241]
Elowen knelt, earnestly naive plan forming: rebuild the bell not with raw fire-magic he barely wielded, but by understanding dripping rates. [264]
Sync the repair to the viaduct's tears, letting their rhythm guide molten bronze back into wholeness. [278]
It sounded impossible—plausible only to the desperately hopeful—yet the logic held in maritime lore: drips as cosmic metronomes. [300]
His brittle devotion urged him on, though doubt whispered he was fooling himself. [313]
He unpacked tools: a vial of phosphorescent fish oil from pre-end stocks, a silver needle for tracing cracks, and his lukewarm grimoire. [334]
First, chart the rates. [337]
He etched a wax tablet, timing drips with a pendulum carved from Leviathan bone. [350]
Dawn strengthened; drops accelerated, five per breath, then lagged to one. [363]
Patterns emerged: triplets for stellar wobbles, doubles for tidal lulls. [374]
Elowen's naive mind seized them as prophecy, his devotion cracking under fatigue but holding. [389]
Sweat beaded despite the cold; his spells sputtered, warming the bell barely past ambient. [402]
He heated fish oil over a lukewarm cantrip-flame, blue as the viaduct, and poured it into the crack, whispering incantations synced to drip-falls. [428]
One drop, two—oil seeped, binding bronze threads. [436]
But the imbalance fought back; a surge cracked the repair wider, drips now chaotic frenzy. [451]
Elowen's hands shook, brittle devotion fracturing—why him, the half-mage, when titans had failed? [470]
Earnest naivety surged: "The lukewarm mend the broken worlds," he muttered, recalling grandmother's tale. [488]
He refocused, divining deeper rates beneath the chaos—subtle undertones, like fish ghosts schooling in ether. [506]
Using a silver needle, he pierced micro-channels, channeling drips directly into the bell's heart. [520]
Each calibrated fall deposited sapphire-infused essence, rate-matched to cosmic leaks. [533]
The bell warmed under his faltering spells, cracks spidering inward then sealing with resonant chimes. [549]
Hours blurred in dawn's lingering light; Elowen rebuilt layer by timed layer, devotion's fragility forging strength through persistence. [568]
Finally, whole, the bell gleamed, humming with restored oaths. [579]
With trembling hands, he struck it. [585]
A toll rolled out—not thunderous, but perfectly pitched, plausible impossibility weaving through reality. [603]
Drips normalized on the viaduct, steady as pre-fish eras. [613]
Stars steadied overhead, cosmic imbalance righted by one lukewarm mage's earnest toil. [629]
Elowen slumped, brittle devotion tempered to resilient vow, the sapphire viaduct glowing in approval at dawn's zenith. [651]
Far below, the sea whispered thanks, empty but balanced once more. [665]
He smiled naively, knowing small acts mend vast rents. [676]
The fishermen, witnessing from shores, hailed the mage atop the viaduct. [690]
In that moment, lukewarm became legend's seed. [701]
The bell's echo lingered, binding devotion eternally to the dawn. [715]
Elowen gathered his tools, ready for whatever imbalance next arose. [729]
The viaduct's drips sang on, guardians of the mended cosmos. [742]
His naive heart swelled—proof that fragile faith rebuilds worlds. [756]
Dawn fully broke, sapphire bridge arching triumphant over silent waves. [772]
And so, after the last fish, equilibrium returned through dripping precision. [791]
