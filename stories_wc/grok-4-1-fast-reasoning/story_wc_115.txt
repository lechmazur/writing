Jax Harlan gripped his flashlight tighter, its beam slicing through the damp gloom of the abandoned train tunnel that snaked beneath the ruins of the old cotton mill. [15]
He was a reckless abandoned-mill explorer, the kind who chased rusted skeletons of industry not for thrills alone, but to unearth the human echoes left behind. [42]
Tonight, sleep deprivation lent his steps a drowsy alertness, eyes heavy-lidded yet scanning every shadow with predatory sharpness. [67]
The tunnel, long disused after the mill's collapse in '87, hummed with faint drips and the distant rumble of trucks overhead. [92]
Jax had heard the legends of the factory ghost shift: spectral workers clocking in at midnight, their translucent forms tending phantom looms in the mill's bowels, spilling into this very tunnel. [127]
Religiously skeptical, he scoffed at holy water tales peddled by ghost hunters, preferring cold steel and forgotten ledgers for truth. [154]
His real quest burned deeper—to find the weight of a swallowed truth, the guilt he'd buried since that fatal night shift two decades ago. [184]
Pushing deeper, boots crunching gravel, he spotted it: a beaded valve wheel, massive and corroded, jutting from a sealed bulkhead door half-buried in silt. [215]
Prayer beads—faded rosaries—were woven tightly into its spokes, as if someone had turned it in desperate ritual, embedding them like a curse. [245]
Jax knelt, fingers tracing the beads' worn surfaces, chilled by their unnatural smoothness amid the rust. [267]
Drowsy alertness sharpened; this wasn't random vandalism. [276]
He pulled his battered portable radio from his pack, twisting the dial for static-laced companionship on these solo delves. [299]
A talk-radio psychic show crackled to life, host intoning about industrial hauntings. [316]
Callers flooded in frantically, voices overlapping in panic. [327]
"They're back—the ghost shift! Looms whirring in the dark!" one shrieked. [341]
Another: "My uncle died turning that valve in the tunnel—won't rest till the truth's out!" [365]
Jax appraised the wheel's mystery methodically, by interpreting these frantic calls to talk-radio psychics. [386]
Patterns emerged: every caller tied to the mill's last night, whispers of sabotage, a confession long hushed. [409]
His pulse quickened; the beads matched descriptions—Father Reilly's, the mill chaplain who'd vanished after the collapse. [435]
Deeper he tuned, drowsiness veiling fear into focus. [446]
A new caller broke through, voice trembling: "It was me—I rigged the belts to cover embezzlement. Workers crushed, tunnel flooded. Forgive me!" [484]
The line went dead silent. [491]
During the hush that followed this sudden confession, Jax froze, the radio's void mirroring the tunnel's. [517]
The weight crashed in: that caller was him—or rather, the anonymous code he'd punched in minutes ago, compelled by the wheel's touch. [545]
Years ago, young and desperate, Jax had been the night-shift mechanic, swallowing the truth of his minor tampering gone wrong, dooming thirteen souls including his own brother. [579]
Religiously skeptical no more in this drowsy haze, he saw the factory ghost shift not as spirits, but as psychic residue—echoes amplified by the beads' faith-forged anchor. [611]
The calls had been his subconscious jury, appraising the wheel as confessional valve, turning to release trapped remorse. [634]
He gripped it now, muscles straining against rusted resistance. [647]
A groan echoed—metal yielding, beads snapping free like absolution beads. [662]
Behind the door, skeletal machinery loomed, dusted with time, but alive with faint whirs: the ghost shift manifesting in his mind's eye. [689]
The weight lifted, truth expelled not as burden but feather-light revelation. [703]
Jax backed away, radio still hushed, tunnel air thickening with mill-dust phantoms that brushed his skin. [725]
Drowsy alertness peaked into clarity—he'd found it, the precise heft of swallowed sin: heavier than chains, yet buoyant in release. [752]
No ghosts, no gods—just human echoes demanding reckoning. [765]
He emerged into moonlight, beaded fragments in pocket, forever changed. [779]
The reckless explorer walked on, lighter, the tunnel's hush his eternal companion. [798]
