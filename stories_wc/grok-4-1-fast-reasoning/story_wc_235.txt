I stirred in the creaky bunk of the mountain ranger cabin, the scent of pine resin and damp earth clinging to my flannel shirt like an old regret. [15]
The dream lingered, sharper than the frost biting at the windowpanes: I'd stood before my own grave, weeds choking the headstone etched with a date that might have been tomorrow's. [39]
Chronologically confused, as always, I couldn't pin whether I'd glimpsed the future or merely revisited a forgotten corner of the past. [68]
My name is Elara Voss, lucid dream chronicler, paid in whispers and wild honey to map the subconscious terrains others fear to tread. [98]
In this forsaken cabin perched on the ridge of Blackthorn Peak, I distilled chaos into narrative, scratching truths onto whatever medium the wilds provided. [131]
Tonight, that medium was a birch bark scroll, harvested from a lightning-scarred tree during last week's storm, its papery skin unfurling like a reluctant confession. [164]
Jaded wonder settled over me, that weary awe of one who's flown too many dreamscapes and crashed just as often. [189]
The grave vision had cracked something open, unleashing feral nostalgia—a savage, clawing yearning for the untamed selves I'd buried along the way. [223]
I remembered the girl who first lucid-dreamed at sixteen, soaring unbound over city spires, no grave in sight. [247]
Jealousy gnawed at me then, hot and irrational, for that past self's reckless freedom, her wings unclipped by decades of chronicling nightmares for strangers. [280]
Why her? Why not me, trapped in this cabin's skeletal embrace, piecing together lives from the ether? [301]
The envy deepened, a method I'd unwittingly perfected: getting jealous of past selves to shatter the veil between waking and dreaming. [331]
It worked every time, that bitter spark igniting lucidity like flint on steel. [345]
The cabin walls blurred, the birch bark scroll glowing faintly in my lap as if alive. [361]
I gripped it tighter, quill fashioned from a raven's feather poised above the bark's virgin veins. [379]
Feral nostalgia surged, visions overlapping: the child-self romping feral through these same mountains, mud-caked and eternal; the young wanderer chronicling first loves in fevered journals; the middle-aged failure, grave already dug in her mind. [419]
Jealousy crested—I hated them all, those ghosts freer than my jaded bones. [435]
The air thickened, and suddenly, I was soaring. [446]
Not gently lifting, but erupting upward through the cabin roof, splintering timber in a cascade of starlit shards. [470]
Blackthorn Peak fell away beneath me, its crags like broken teeth in the moon's indifferent grin. [489]
Winds howled with the voices of past selves, laughing, weeping, daring me to catch up. [508]
Higher I soared, chronologically confused trails weaving through time: childhood meadows blooming below one instant, my grave's mound swelling the next. [537]
Feral nostalgia fueled the ascent, wild as the thermals twisting my body into an arrow of light. [555]
Jealous no more, but envious still, I chased those selves across stratospheres of memory. [573]
The birch bark scroll fluttered in my fist, ink bleeding stories mid-flight—phrases etching themselves: "Grave seen, yet ungrown; selves feral, me chained." [601]
Down below, the cabin shrank to a matchstick, its lantern a dying ember. [615]
I twisted in the ether, wonder jading into resolve: this chaos demanded distillation. [634]
Plummeting now toward lucidity's edge, I unrolled the scroll fully, its bark pulsing with captured frenzy. [652]
Words poured out, narrative threading the feral threads: the grave was no end, but a marker for rebirths I'd ignored. [676]
Soaring leveled into a glide, past selves merging—not rivals, but guides through the chronological maze. [695]
I landed softly amid cabin ruins, or were they whole? Time flickered. [711]
The scroll complete, chaos distilled: a chronicle of jaded wonder, where graves precede flights, and jealousy births wings. [734]
Dawn crept over the ridge, indifferent to my timeline's knots. [746]
I folded the birch bark, tucking it into my pack, ready for the next dreamer's plea. [763]
Feral nostalgia quieted, jealousy's method sated—for now. [774]
In the mountains' silence, I wondered: whose grave would I chronicle next? Mine again? [793]
