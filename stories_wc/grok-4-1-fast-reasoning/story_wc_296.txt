After the magic trick failed, the guarded druid named Thorne tumbled through a rift of shattered illusions into the swirling orchard vortex at the heart of the cursed lake. [24]
His spell, meant to coerce a enchanted mirror into revealing truths it concealed, had backfired with serene inevitability, sucking him into this warlike serenity where ancient apple trees rotated in slow, expanding circles like silent legions poised for eternal battle. [52]
The air hummed with a calm ferocity, branches arching like drawn swords under a sky of rippling water, yet no chaos erupted—only poised tranquility. [76]
Thorne, known across the realms for finding lost things, clenched his fists against the pull of the vortex, his guarded nature a fortress against the lake's insidious whispers. [106]
He sought one truth above all: what mirrors refused to show, the shadowed motives of his own heart that reflections polished away like tarnish. [133]
Now, adrift in this orchard abyss, that motivation burned fiercer, demanding revelation amid the curse's grip. [153]
The trees' roots coiled in hypnotic spirals, their bark etched with runes of forgotten pacts, expanding outward in relentless, unyielding bends. [179]
Thorne's boots sank into frost-kissed soil that shouldn't exist underwater, a frozen confession glinting at the vortex's core—a massive ice shard imprisoning a spectral voice, his own from years past, uttering a betrayal he'd long denied. [214]
Mirrors had always shown him the noble seeker, hiding the druid who once sacrificed a village elder to bind a demon, a deed warped by guilt into oblivion. [241]
Here, frozen mid-syllable, his younger self's lips formed the damning words: "For power, I yield him." [261]
To free it, to face what mirrors didn't show, Thorne needed to unbend the vortex's tightening spirals, but his guarded heart resisted vulnerability. [287]
His attribute stirred; amid swirling petals, his eyes locked on a glint in the frost—the flesh-eating plant seed, a lost relic whispered of in druidic lore, capable of devouring barriers when rooted true. [321]
He'd found it, as always, drawn by the unseen threads that guided him to the misplaced. [335]
Kneeling in warlike serenity, Thorne held the seed aloft, its surface pulsing with hungry veins. [351]
The method came instinctively: plant it through expanding circles, mirroring the orchard's rhythm to unravel its war. [373]
He pressed it into the icy soil at the center, whispering incantations that echoed like distant war drums in the calm. [396]
No blood yet; the seed required flesh to awaken, and in his unyielding guard, Thorne hesitated. [414]
The vortex tightened, trees leaning in like armored ranks, serenity masking their threat. [431]
To unbend meant yielding his own flesh, a confession in action—pricking his palm, he let blood drip onto the seed. [455]
It quivered, roots unfurling in the first tiny circle, nibbling at the frost with acidic relish. [474]
Pain sharpened his focus, the warlike peace amplifying each sensation as circles expanded. [492]
The plant grew, vines thickening, leaves like serrated blades, devouring the outermost roots of the orchard trees in methodical serenity. [517]
Branches groaned but held formation, retaliating with gusts that whipped Thorne's robes. [532]
Deeper circles bloomed; the flesh-eater consumed twisted bark and frozen earth, inching toward the confession's shard. [554]
Thorne's guard cracked—unbending as visions assailed him, mirrors shattering in his mind to reveal the elder's pleading eyes. [579]
"Why hide it?" the spectral voice teased from the ice, his own frozen echo probing. [593]
The plant's final circle engulfed the shard, acids melting ice while sparing the apparition within. [611]
Freed, the confession thawed in a breath of mist, words blasting full: "For power, I yielded him—yet power hollowed me, leaving only loss." [640]
Thorne staggered, the truth raw—no villainy excused, no heroism fabricated, just a man fractured. [657]
What mirrors didn't show was this: his seeking heart, forever finding not just lost objects, but lost selves. [681]
The vortex faltered, trees straightening in release as the plant wilted, its hunger sated. [695]
Unbent, Thorne rose, the warlike serenity now his own—calm readiness forged in confession's fire. [715]
He waded from the lake's heart, the rift sealing behind, carrying seed remnants and a unguarded soul. [736]
No longer just the finder of things, he was the unbinder of self-deceit. [750]
The cursed lake stilled, its vortex appeased, as Thorne stepped into dawn's light. [765]
Mirrors would still lie, but he knew their deceit now, in serene, unyielding truth. [784]
