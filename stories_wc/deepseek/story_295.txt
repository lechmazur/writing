<story>The jovial sellsword stood in the witch’s herb garden, his hand resting on the polished brass of an astronomical telescope, its lens catching the faint glow of the moon. <words>28</words> He was boldly reluctant, his usual laughter muted by the weight of the withering vow he had made years ago—a promise to his dying father to dethrone doubt from his mind and reclaim the treasure that had eluded their family for generations. <words>70</words> The telescope, a relic of their family tradition of making a time capsule, had been buried beneath the garden’s soil, waiting for this moment. <words>98</words>  

The witch, her hands stained with the essence of rare herbs, watched him with a knowing smile, her presence adding an air of elegant mayhem to the scene. <words>129</words> “You’ve come for it, haven’t you?” she asked, her voice a blend of curiosity and mischief. <words>145</words> The sellsword nodded, his jovial facade cracking under the pressure of his mission. <words>160</words>  

Throughout the transformation of the garden—its flowers blooming and wilting in rapid succession, as if time itself were unraveling—he focused on the telescope, the key to the treasure. <words>195</words> His father had spoken of it in hushed tones, describing how it could reveal the hidden path to their family’s lost fortune. <words>220</words> But the vow had withered over the years, its power fading as doubt crept in. <words>237</words>  

The witch stepped closer, her shadow stretching across the garden like a dark omen. <words>253</words> “The telescope is more than a tool,” she said. <words>263</words> “It’s a test of your resolve. To use it, you must confront the doubt that binds you.” <words>284</words> The sellsword hesitated, his hand trembling on the brass tube. <words>297</words>  

As the garden’s transformation reached its peak, the air thick with the scent of herbs and the hum of magic, he made his decision. <words>324</words> He peered through the telescope, its lens revealing not stars, but memories—his father’s face, the time capsule they had buried together, the treasure they had sought. <words>360</words> Each image chipped away at his doubt, replacing it with a fierce determination. <words>378</words>  

The witch’s voice broke the silence. <words>385</words> “The treasure is not gold or jewels,” she said. <words>396</words> “It’s the strength to honor your vow, to reclaim what was lost within yourself.” <words>416</words> The sellsword lowered the telescope, his laughter returning, though it was deeper now, tinged with resolve. <words>438</words>  

He turned to the witch, his eyes alight with purpose. <words>449</words> “Thank you,” he said, his voice steady. <words>457</words> “The treasure was never out there. It was always here.” <words>470</words> With that, he left the garden, the telescope in hand, ready to fulfill his vow and dethrone doubt once and for all. <words>497</words></story>
