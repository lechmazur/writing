<story>The bruised fighter stood in the dusty attic, his knuckles raw and his spirit weary, surrounded by clockwork animals frozen in mid-motion, their gears silent and rusted. <words>31</words> He clutched a clay pot shard with an inscription he couldn’t yet decipher, its edges jagged but its message faintly glowing, as if it held a secret meant only for him. <words>66</words> The attic was a place of forgotten dreams, where time seemed to linger like the dust motes drifting in the dim light, and he had come here to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception that had haunted him for years. <words>113</words>  

At that very moment, far away, a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, the sound echoing through the ages, a reminder of creation and destruction intertwined. <words>148</words> The fighter felt the vibration of that strike in his bones, as though it were a call to action, a demand that he stand for something greater than his own pain. <words>180</words> He had always been skillfully incompetent, a man who could fight but never win, who could dream but never achieve, and he was tired of it. <words>208</words>  

The clockwork animals began to stir, their gears creaking to life, their glass eyes turning toward him with an eerie intelligence. <words>234</words> One by one, they moved closer, their movements deliberate, as if they had been waiting for him. <words>253</words> The fighter tightened his grip on the shard, its inscription now pulsing with a faint light, and he realized it was a key—a key to something he had long forgotten. <words>287</words>  

Through forgotten dreams, they came for him, the clockwork animals, their purpose clear: to abduct him, to take him to a place where he would have to confront the truth he had been avoiding. <words>324</words> He didn’t resist as they surrounded him, their cold metal bodies pressing against his bruised skin, because he knew this was what he needed. <words>353</words> The attic dissolved around him, replaced by a vast, empty space where the only sound was the distant echo of the sculptor’s chisel. <words>383</words>  

In that space, he saw himself as he truly was: a man who had been running from his own potential, hiding behind his failures, and pretending they were enough. <words>415</words> The inscription on the shard flared brightly, and he finally understood its message: “Stand for something, or fall for everything.” <words>443</words> The clockwork animals retreated, their task complete, and the fighter felt a resolve he hadn’t known in years. <words>468</words>  

He would no longer be skillfully incompetent. <words>476</words> He would stand for something, even if it meant facing the pain of his past and the uncertainty of his future. <words>500</words> The sculptor’s chisel struck again, and this time, the fighter felt it as a beginning, not an end. <words>521</words> He stepped out of the forgotten dreams and into the light, ready to carve his own path. <words>540</words></story>
