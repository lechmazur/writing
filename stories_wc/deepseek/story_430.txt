<story>The closed-off reaver stood in the kaleidoscope park, where the trees shimmered like fractured glass and the air hummed with colors that had no name. <words>28</words>He clutched a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, its edges crumpled and smudged, the crayon lines wobbling but earnest. <words>50</words>It was a portrait of him, though he barely recognized himself in the stick-figure version, his sword a jagged slash of red, his face a crooked smile. <words>80</words>Generational patterns, he thought bitterly, tracing the lines with a calloused finger—his father had been a reaver, and his father before him, each one carving a path of violence and solitude. <words>115</words>But this drawing, this clumsy attempt at love, nagged at him like a splinter he couldn’t remove. <words>133</words>He had found it tucked into the margins of an old book, scrawled poems in the child’s handwriting weaving around the printed text, each verse a plea for him to stay. <words>166</words>“Before the first lie is told,” he muttered, the phrase echoing in his mind like a prophecy he couldn’t escape. <words>188</words>He had always been charmingly grotesque, his scars and sneers drawing people in even as he pushed them away, but this—this was different. <words>215</words>The child’s words, clumsy and raw, had cracked something open in him, a fissure he couldn’t seal. <words>234</words>He wandered deeper into the park, the kaleidoscope effect intensifying, the world around him shifting and twisting like a dream. <words>258</words>He had come here to taste the stars in a single kiss, to find something pure and untainted in a life that had been anything but. <words>284</words>But the drawing haunted him, mocking affection in its simplicity, a reminder of the life he could have had if he hadn’t been so afraid. <words>312</words>He stopped at a clearing where the colors coalesced into a single, blinding light, and for a moment, he saw himself as the child had drawn him—not a monster, but a man. <words>348</words>The poems in the margins whispered in his mind, their rhythm steady and insistent, urging him to break the cycle, to be more than the sum of his scars. <words>377</words>He clenched the drawing tighter, the paper crinkling in his grip, and made a decision. <words>394</words>He would find the child, not to say goodbye, but to stay. <words>408</words>The kaleidoscope park seemed to pulse in approval, the colors swirling around him like a symphony of hope. <words>429</words>He stepped forward, the first lie he had ever told himself—that he was unworthy of love—shattering like glass beneath his feet. <words>455</words>And for the first time, he felt the stars on his lips, not in a kiss, but in the promise of something new. <words>478</words></story>
