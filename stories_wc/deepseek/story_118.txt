<story>The hive-mind therapist sat in the uniformly peculiar secret agent training facility, her thoughts echoing through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery. <words>28</words> Her scuffed phone charger plug lay on the table, its frayed edges a metaphor for the fragmented minds she sought to mend. <words>51</words> The sound of hindsight hummed softly in the background, a low, persistent reminder of choices made and paths untaken. <words>76</words> She had come here to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to give form to the intangible whispers of her patients' collective consciousness. <words>103</words>  

The room was dimly lit, the only source of light a single candle whose wax dripped slowly onto a metal plate. <words>129</words> Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, she communicated with the hive-mind, each drop a symbol, each shape a message. <words>157</words> The process was meticulous, requiring patience and precision, but it was the only way to drain the chaos from their shared psyche. <words>183</words>  

As the night deepened, the therapist felt a merry bitterness settle over her. <words>199</words> It was a strange blend of satisfaction and sorrow, knowing that her work brought clarity but also exposed raw, unhealed wounds. <words>228</words> The agents-in-training watched her with a mix of awe and apprehension, their own minds teetering on the edge of revelation. <words>253</words>  

The candle's flame flickered, casting shadows that danced like specters on the walls. <words>271</words> The therapist focused on the wax, interpreting the shapes as they formed: a spiral, a star, a labyrinth. <words>293</words> Each symbol was a piece of the puzzle, a fragment of the hive-mind's collective memory. <words>313</words> She worked tirelessly, her hands steady, her mind sharp, driven by the need to make sense of the chaos. <words>338</words>  

By dawn, the metal plate was covered in a intricate tapestry of wax, a map of the hive-mind's journey. <words>362</words> The therapist leaned back, her task complete, the ephemeral now anchored in reality. <words>381</words> The agents-in-training approached, their eyes wide with understanding, their minds clear for the first time. <words>404</words>  

As the first rays of sunlight filtered through the windows, the therapist felt a sense of fulfillment. <words>426</words> The sound of hindsight had faded, replaced by the quiet hum of clarity. <words>443</words> She picked up her scuffed phone charger plug, a small, tangible reminder of the night's work, and smiled with a merry bitterness. <words>470</words> The hive-mind was at peace, and so was she. <words>483</words></story>
