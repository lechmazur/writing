<story>The sneering envoy stood in the domed vineyard on a barren alien plain, his gloved fingers clutching a folded note as if it were the last thread of a rambling destiny. <words>30</words> The air was furiously tranquil, a paradox that seemed to hum with the weight of a possibility just born. <words>50</words> He sifted through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse, their edges brittle and yellowed, as though the vines themselves had given up on bearing fruit. <words>80</words> The note in his hand was part of a paper trail, a cryptic map that led to something far greater than the envoy had ever imagined. <words>110</words> His motivation burned within him, a singular desire to cup starlight in mortal palms, to hold the infinite in his grasp. <words>135</words> The vineyard’s glass dome shimmered faintly, reflecting the pale light of a distant sun, and the envoy’s sneer deepened as he considered the absurdity of his task. <words>165</words> Yet, he could not turn away, not when the trail had brought him this far. <words>180</words> The greenhouse was a relic, its purpose long forgotten, but the envoy knew it was no accident that he had been led here. <words>205</words> The leaves whispered as he moved, their dry rustle a reminder of the passage of time and the fragility of ambition. <words>230</words> He unfolded the note, its creases sharp and deliberate, and read the words scrawled in a hand that seemed to tremble with urgency. <words>255</words> “The stars are not meant to be held,” it said, “but to be chased.” <words>270</words> The envoy scoffed, his sneer twisting into something darker, more desperate. <words>285</words> He had come too far to be deterred by riddles. <words>295</words> The greenhouse seemed to pulse around him, the air thick with the scent of decay and the promise of something just out of reach. <words>320</words> He sifted through the leaves once more, his movements frantic now, as though the act itself could bring him closer to his goal. <words>345</words> And then, beneath a pile of desiccated vines, he found it: a small, crystalline orb that glowed with a light that seemed to come from within. <words>375</words> The envoy’s breath caught in his throat as he reached for it, his gloved fingers trembling. <words>395</words> This was it, the starlight he had sought, the culmination of his paper trail. <words>415</words> But as he cupped it in his palms, the orb shattered, its light scattering like dust in the wind. <words>440</words> The envoy stood alone in the greenhouse, his sneer replaced by a look of hollow realization. <words>460</words> The stars, it seemed, would always remain just out of reach. <words>475</words></story>
