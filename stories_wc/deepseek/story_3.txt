<story>The surly watchman stood at the edge of the sailor’s graveyard, his weathered hands clutching a short piece of yarn, the only remnant of a traditional craft he had learned from his elder. <words>28</words> The air was thick with the scent of salt and decay, the sky caught in the liminal haze of a time between seasons, neither summer nor autumn. <words>55</words> His eyes, sharp and restless, scanned the horizon as if searching for answers in the cosmic patterns that eluded him. <words>80</words> The graveyard, with its tilted headstones and whispers of forgotten voyages, seemed to pulse with a serenely frantic energy, a dignified chaos that mirrored his own turmoil. <words>112</words>  

He had come here not to mourn but to riddle out the market wisdom that had always seemed just beyond his grasp. <words>136</words> The yarn in his hand was more than a relic; it was a symbol of the intricate connections he sought to unravel. <words>158</words> His elder had once told him that the market was like the sea—unpredictable, vast, and governed by unseen forces. <words>183</words> Yet, unlike the sailors who had perished here, he refused to be swallowed by its depths. <words>202</words>  

As he walked among the graves, his boots crunching on the brittle grass, he began to weave the yarn between his fingers, a habit he had developed during long nights of contemplation. <words>238</words> The motion was meditative, a way to channel his frustration into something tangible. <words>255</words> He thought of the elder’s hands, steady and sure, guiding him through the craft that now felt like a lifeline. <words>278</words>  

A sudden gust of wind tore through the graveyard, scattering leaves and tugging at the yarn in his hand. <words>300</words> He tightened his grip, his surly demeanor softening as he realized the wind’s message. <words>319</words> The market, like the wind, could not be controlled—only understood. <words>336</words> It was a force of nature, chaotic yet governed by its own logic. <words>351</words>  

He knelt beside a weathered headstone, the name long eroded by time, and laid the yarn across it. <words>372</words> In that moment, he felt a strange clarity, as if the cosmic patterns he had sought were finally within reach. <words>395</words> The graveyard, with its silent witnesses, seemed to nod in approval. <words>410</words>  

Rising to his feet, he pocketed the yarn and turned toward the horizon, where the sea met the sky in an endless embrace. <words>435</words> He no longer felt the need to riddle out the market’s secrets; instead, he understood that wisdom lay in accepting its chaos, just as the sailors had accepted the sea. <words>468</words> With a dignified resolve, he walked away, the sailor’s graveyard fading into the haze of the between-seasons twilight. <words>493</words> The surly watchman had found his answer, not in control, but in surrender. <words>510</words></story>
