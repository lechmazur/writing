<story>The disgruntled wishing-well attendant sat on the edge of the moss-covered stone, his fingers idly tracing the grooves of a collection of foreign coins that had been tossed into the well over the years. <words>31</words> Each coin carried the weight of scars—etched by hands that had hoped, prayed, and dreamed, only to leave their burdens behind. <words>57</words> He had always felt the weight of those scars, as if they were his own, though he had never cast a single wish. <words>81</words> His job was to collect the coins, to keep the well from overflowing, but lately, he had begun to wonder if he was merely a custodian of other people’s regrets. <words>113</words>  

The attendant’s demeanor was intensely relaxed, a paradox that baffled those who passed by. <words>131</words> He moved with the ease of someone who had long since stopped caring, yet his eyes betrayed a simmering discontent. <words>151</words> Today, however, something was different. <words>157</words> At the crossing of two unwritten paths—one leading to the well, the other to a forgotten trail—he felt a shift in the air, a whisper of inherited mystery that tugged at his curiosity. <words>195</words>  

A shadow flickered across the ground, and the attendant’s gaze followed it instinctively. <words>211</words> It was not the shadow of a tree or a passing bird, but something deliberate, almost alive. <words>230</words> He stood, his movements unhurried, and began to follow the shadow patterns as they danced across the cobblestones. <words>253</words> They led him away from the well, down the forgotten trail, and into a hidden passage that he had never noticed before. <words>278</words>  

The passage was narrow and dimly lit, its walls lined with symbols that seemed to pulse with a faint, otherworldly glow. <words>303</words> It was, he realized, a secret agent escape route, a relic of a time when spies and fugitives had used this place to vanish into the unknown. <words>331</words> The attendant felt a strange thrill as he walked deeper into the passage, his footsteps echoing softly against the stone. <words>356</words>  

At the end of the passage, he found a small chamber, its walls adorned with mirrors that reflected not his face, but the faces of those who had cast their wishes into the well. <words>391</words> They were old ghosts, their eyes filled with silent judgments that seemed to pierce through him. <words>410</words> The attendant’s jaw tightened as he realized why he had been drawn here: to out-face those judgments, to prove that he was more than just a keeper of regrets. <words>445</words>  

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the collection of foreign coins, holding them up to the mirrors. <words>464</words> “I corroborate your scars,” he said, his voice steady. <words>476</words> “But they are not mine to carry.” <words>485</words> The mirrors shattered, and the ghosts dissolved into the air, leaving the attendant alone in the chamber. <words>506</words> He turned and walked back to the well, his steps lighter, the weight of scars finally lifted. <words>528</words></story>
