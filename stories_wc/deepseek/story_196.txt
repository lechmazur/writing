<story>The tired swordsman leaned against the cold stone wall of the floating rock monastery, his plain cloth bag resting at his feet, its contents as unremarkable as his weary expression. <words>28</words> The quiet breakroom felt emptier than usual, the air heavy with the unspoken weight of someone’s resignation, though he couldn’t bring himself to care much. <words>55</words> He was fiercely apathetic, a man who had seen too much to be moved by the comings and goings of others, yet something in him stirred—a spark of defiance he thought long extinguished. <words>94</words> It was a promise he had made to himself years ago, hidden even from his own memory, buried beneath layers of exhaustion and disillusionment. <words>124</words>  

The monastery, perched precariously on a floating rock, was a place of solitude and silence, its inhabitants devoted to the study of celestial phenomena. <words>158</words> The swordsman had come here not for enlightenment but for escape, though the stars above seemed to mock his indifference. <words>183</words> Tonight, the sky was alive with a meteor shower, streaks of light cutting through the darkness like blades. <words>204</words> He had always followed these showers, not out of reverence but out of habit, a ritual he couldn’t explain. <words>227</words>  

As he watched the meteors, a knowing naivety crept into his thoughts, a strange blend of wisdom and foolishness that reminded him of who he used to be. <words>259</words> He had once believed in something greater, in the possibility of overcoming the world’s cruelty, but that belief had been shattered long ago. <words>287</words> Yet, as the meteors blazed across the sky, he felt a flicker of that old conviction, a quiet insistence that he could still rise above his weariness. <words>322</words>  

The plain cloth bag at his feet seemed to call to him, its simplicity a stark contrast to the chaos in his mind. <words>346</words> He knelt and opened it, revealing a single, unadorned sword—a relic of a life he had tried to leave behind. <words>369</words> The weight of it in his hands felt familiar, yet foreign, as if it belonged to someone else. <words>390</words> He had carried it for years, not as a weapon but as a burden, a reminder of promises unkept. <words>412</words>  

The meteor shower intensified, the sky ablaze with light, and the swordsman felt something shift within him. <words>435</words> He stood, the sword in hand, and made a silent vow to himself—not to fight the world, but to fight the apathy that had consumed him. <words>464</words> The floating rock monastery, with its quiet breakroom and celestial wonders, had become his crucible, and the spark of defiance his guide. <words>492</words> As the last meteor faded into the night, the tired swordsman took his first step toward overcoming the weight of his own indifference. <words>520</words></story>
