The abandoned spaceport hangar loomed like a relic of a forgotten era, its rusted beams and cracked concrete exuding an ancient novelty that made the air feel heavy with history. <words>30</words> Amid the hush before an acceptance speech began, the professional cuddler, Mira, wandered through the farmer's market set up in the hangar, her fingers brushing against the unusually usual produce—carrots with a faint blue hue, apples that smelled faintly of cinnamon. <words>70</words> She wasn’t here for the vegetables, though; she was here to confront the unspoken rules that had governed her life, rules that had kept her from truly connecting with others. <words>100</words>  

Her eyes caught on a stall tucked into the shadow of a derelict spacecraft, where an elderly man with a weathered face sat, holding a phantom train ticket punch. <words>130</words> The tool gleamed faintly, as if it carried the weight of countless journeys, and Mira felt an inexplicable pull toward it. <words>150</words> "That’s not something you see every day," she said, her voice soft but steady. <words>160</words>  

The man looked up, his eyes sharp despite their age. <words>170</words> "It’s not for sale," he said, his tone carrying a hint of challenge. <words>180</words> "But it might be for someone who’s ready to face what they’ve been running from." <words>190</words> Mira hesitated, her heart pounding as she realized this chance encounter was no accident. <words>210</words>  

She had spent years offering comfort to others, her profession a shield against her own fear of intimacy, a prejudice she had never acknowledged until now. <words>240</words> The decay of the hangar around her mirrored the decay within, the crumbling walls a reflection of the walls she had built around herself. <words>260</words> "What do I have to do?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. <words>270</words>  

The man handed her the punch, its weight surprising in her palm. <words>280</words> "Use it," he said simply. <words>290</words> "But know this: it doesn’t just punch tickets. It punches through the lies we tell ourselves." <words>310</words> Mira’s breath caught as she pressed the punch into the air, and suddenly, the world shifted. <words>330</words>  

She was no longer in the hangar but on a phantom train, its carriages filled with faces from her past—clients she had held but never truly seen, friends she had kept at arm’s length, family she had pushed away. <words>370</words> Each face carried a ticket, and with each punch, she felt a piece of her prejudice crumble, the unspoken rules that had bound her unraveling like thread. <words>400</words>  

When she returned to the hangar, the man was gone, but the punch remained in her hand, its surface now warm. <words>420</words> The acceptance speech began in the distance, the crowd’s applause echoing through the vast space, but Mira stood still, her heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>450</words> She had faced her fear, and in doing so, she had found a way to truly connect—not just with others, but with herself. <words>480</words> The hangar, once a symbol of decay, now felt like a place of rebirth, its ancient novelty a reminder that even the oldest wounds could heal. <words>510</words> Mira smiled, the phantom train ticket punch clutched tightly in her hand, and stepped forward into the crowd, ready to embrace the world without fear. <words>540</words>
