<story>The apathetic summoner sat in the corner of the shared dream recording studio, her fingers idly tracing the grooves of a rustic coffee grinder she had found abandoned on the counter. <words>30</words> The studio, once bustling with the echoes of divine inspiration, now felt hollow, its walls lined with empty frames that seemed to watch her with a gentle sharpness. <words>63</words> It was after the last breath of a dying god, and the world outside was unraveling, its rivers running dry and its coral reefs crumbling into dust. <words>96</words> She had come here not out of passion but out of a reluctantly acknowledged duty—to rebuild what had been lost, though the task felt as futile as grinding coffee beans without water. <words>136</words>  

The summoner was, by nature, enthusiastically lazy, a paradox that defined her existence. <words>154</words> She could summon great forces with a flick of her wrist, but only if the effort didn’t require her to leave her chair. <words>178</words> The empty frames on the walls began to hum faintly, their vibrations resonating with the rhythm of her thoughts. <words>200</words> She tilted her head, realizing they were not just frames but portals, waiting to unfold something—perhaps a solution, perhaps a distraction. <words>228</words>  

With a sigh, she stood and approached the nearest frame, her fingers brushing its edge. <words>246</words> The air shimmered, and suddenly she was standing by a river, its waters whispering secrets of river wisdom. <words>268</words> The river spoke of balance, of cycles, of how even the smallest actions could ripple into vast change. <words>290</words> The summoner scoffed at first, but the words lingered, tugging at the edges of her apathy. <words>310</words>  

Returning to the studio, she glanced at the coffee grinder, its rustic design suddenly seeming less mundane. <words>332</words> She began to grind the beans, not for coffee but for the act itself, the rhythmic motion grounding her. <words>353</words> As she worked, the empty frames began to fill with images—coral reefs vibrant with life, rivers flowing with renewed vigor, and dreams taking shape in the minds of those who had forgotten how to hope. <words>396</words>  

The summoner’s laziness shifted into something else—a quiet determination. <words>410</words> She realized she didn’t need to summon grand forces; she only needed to start, to let the small actions unfold into something greater. <words>438</words> The studio, once a place of emptiness, now pulsed with potential, its walls alive with the dreams she had begun to record. <words>464</words>  

By the time she set the grinder down, the world outside was still broken, but the first steps toward healing had been taken. <words>490</words> The summoner, no longer apathetic, sat back in her chair, a faint smile playing on her lips as she watched the frames continue to fill, one dream at a time. <words>522</words></story>
