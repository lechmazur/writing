<story>The tuneless bard lounged in the steampunk airship’s dining room, his lute resting against a chair, its strings silent as if in protest of his lack of skill. <words>28</words>Amid poetry readings by other passengers, he leaned back, fiercely nonchalant, sipping from a brass goblet filled with something that smelled faintly of burnt gears. <words>58</words>On the table before him lay a stained manuscript, its edges singed and ink smudged, as though it had survived a fire or perhaps birthed one. <words>88</words>The bard’s eyes flicked to it occasionally, as if daring it to reveal its secrets, though he made no move to open it. <words>110</words>“Chaos,” he muttered to no one in particular, his voice carrying a brazen humility that made the word sound both a confession and a challenge. <words>138</words>“It’s not something to fear, you know. It’s something to tame.” <words>152</words>The other passengers glanced at him, some amused, others wary, but none interrupted their recitations. <words>170</words>The bard smirked, reaching into his coat pocket to pull out a tinderbox, its brass casing engraved with spirals that seemed to twist and writhe under the gaslight. <words>198</words>He flicked it open, the sound sharp and deliberate, and held it up as if it were a talisman. <words>216</words>“This,” he said, “is how you kiss the horizon of madness.” <words>228</words>The room fell silent, the poets pausing mid-verse, their curiosity piqued despite themselves. <words>244</words>The bard leaned forward, his tone shifting to one of conspiratorial glee. <words>256</words>“You’ve heard the legends, haven’t you? The ones passed down via twisted word-of-mouth, about the man who tamed chaos itself?” <words>282</words>He tapped the stained manuscript with a finger, the gesture almost reverent. <words>295</words>“This is his story. Or rather, it’s the story of how he failed—and why that failure was the greatest success of all.” <words>320</words>The passengers exchanged glances, their skepticism mingling with intrigue. <words>333</words>One of them, a woman with goggles perched on her forehead, leaned in. <words>346</words>“And what does that have to do with a tinderbox?” she asked, her voice tinged with both curiosity and doubt. <words>368</words>The bard grinned, his eyes gleaming with a light that seemed to defy the room’s dim gas lamps. <words>387</words>“Everything,” he said. <words>390</words>“Chaos is fire, unpredictable and wild. But fire can be controlled, directed, harnessed. The man in this manuscript—he didn’t try to extinguish chaos. He danced with it, let it burn, and in doing so, he learned its rhythm.” <words>438</words>The bard snapped the tinderbox shut, the sound echoing like a punctuation mark. <words>452</words>“And that,” he said, leaning back with a flourish, “is how you kiss the horizon of madness without getting burned.” <words>474</words>The room remained silent, the poets and passengers staring at him, their verses forgotten. <words>491</words>The bard picked up his lute, plucking a single, discordant note that hung in the air like a challenge. <words>510</words>“Now,” he said, his tone shifting back to fiercely nonchalant, “who’s next?” <words>525</words></story>
