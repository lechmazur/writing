<story>The stoic wanderer stepped into the witch's familiar training ground, his boots crunching on the brittle leaves that littered the forest floor. <words>23</words> The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint tang of burnt herbs, a place where the line between reality and nightmare blurred. <words>47</words> In his hand, he clutched a weathered floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface etched with symbols that pulsed faintly in the dim light. <words>76</words> He had found it weeks ago, following a trail of nightmares that led him here, each step heavier with the weight of necessary lies he had told to keep his purpose hidden. <words>113</words>  

The training ground was mesmerizingly bland, a paradox of unremarkable trees and rocks that seemed to shift subtly when not directly observed. <words>143</words> At its center stood a chalkboard, its surface smeared with arcane formulas that glowed faintly under the moonlight. <words>168</words> A figure stood before it, her hand poised to wipe the final formula away, her movements deliberate and unhurried. <words>193</words> The wanderer’s heart quickened; this was the moment he had been waiting for. <words>208</words>  

He approached with brash tenderness, his voice cutting through the silence like a blade wrapped in velvet. <words>228</words> “Wait,” he said, his tone firm yet laced with an unspoken plea. <words>239</words> The figure turned, her eyes narrowing as she took in his presence. <words>253</words> “You’re not supposed to be here,” she said, her voice cold but not unkind. <words>269</words>  

“I know,” he replied, holding up the floorboard. <words>278</words> “But this belongs to you, doesn’t it? It’s part of the ritual practices you’ve been archiving.” <words>300</words> Her gaze flickered to the board, and for a moment, he saw a flicker of recognition, of something deeper than curiosity. <words>327</words>  

“Why do you care?” she asked, her voice softer now, almost vulnerable. <words>343</words>  

“Because I’ve seen what happens when these practices are lost,” he said, his voice steady despite the storm of emotions churning within him. <words>371</words> “I’ve followed the nightmares they leave behind, and I can’t let that happen again.” <words>391</words>  

She studied him for a long moment, then nodded, stepping aside to let him approach the chalkboard. <words>414</words> He placed the floorboard at its base, the symbols on it aligning with the formulas above as if they were always meant to be together. <words>445</words> The air around them seemed to hum with energy, a silent acknowledgment of something restored. <words>467</words>  

“Thank you,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. <words>478</words>  

He nodded, his stoic mask slipping just enough to reveal the tenderness beneath. <words>495</words> “Sometimes,” he said, “the truth is too heavy to carry alone.” <words>511</words>  

And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving the training ground and its secrets behind, his heart lighter but his purpose unchanged. <words>540</words></story>
