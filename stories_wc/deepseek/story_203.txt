<story>The exorcist with stage fright clutched the pressed wildflowers in his trembling hands, their delicate petals a fragile reminder of the inheritance of lies he carried. <words>30</words> Amid the chaos of toy assembly in the cramped orbital debris, he felt the weight of his family’s deceit pressing down on him, a legacy he could never escape. <words>60</words> The sound of a key turning in the lock echoed through the metallic chamber, and he froze, his heart pounding as he prepared to submerge himself in the task ahead. <words>90</words> This was never usual for him; exorcisms were supposed to be performed on Earth, not in the cold void of space, but here he was, defying the odds. <words>120</words> His motivation burned fiercely within him—to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to prove that even in the most unlikely of places, redemption was possible. <words>150</words> The room was filled with a defiant hush, the silence broken only by the faint hum of the station’s life support systems. <words>170</words> He glanced at the toys scattered around him, their cheerful colors a stark contrast to the grim task at hand. <words>190</words> Each piece of debris outside the station’s windows seemed to mock him, a reminder of the fragility of existence and the lies that had brought him here. <words>220</words> The key turned again, louder this time, and he knew he couldn’t delay any longer. <words>240</words> With a deep breath, he began the ritual, his voice steady despite the stage fright that had plagued him for years. <words>260</words> The wildflowers in his hand seemed to pulse with a faint, otherworldly light, as if they too were part of the inheritance he sought to unravel. <words>290</words> As he chanted, the air grew colder, and the shadows in the room seemed to shift and writhe. <words>310</words> He could feel the presence of the entity he was trying to banish, its malevolence pressing against his mind. <words>330</words> But he refused to falter, his determination unwavering as he continued the exorcism. <words>350</words> The sound of the key turning in the lock grew louder, more insistent, and he realized it wasn’t just a physical sound—it was a manifestation of the entity’s resistance. <words>380</words> With a final, defiant shout, he completed the ritual, and the room was suddenly filled with a blinding light. <words>400</words> When the light faded, the entity was gone, and the wildflowers in his hand had turned to ash. <words>420</words> He stood there, breathing heavily, the weight of his family’s lies finally lifted from his shoulders. <words>440</words> In the silence that followed, he knew he had sculpted possibility from the ashes of “never,” and for the first time in his life, he felt free. <words>470</words></story>
