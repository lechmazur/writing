<story>The underwater welder adjusted his oxygen mask, his fingers brushing against the vintage button box tucked into his belt, its brass hinges glinting faintly in the murky depths. <words>28</words> He had found it in the broken planetarium, now reimagined as a night club, where the ceiling’s shattered dome revealed a sky that seemed to pulse with inherited mystery. <words>60</words> The box was heavy with secrets, its buttons whispering of moments of unraveling, of timelines that should never meet. <words>85</words> He had been drawn to it, not by chance, but by a force he couldn’t name—a force that made him patiently impatient, waiting for the right moment to wield its improbable power. <words>120</words>  

As he surfaced, the night club’s neon lights reflected in the water, casting ripples of color across his face. <words>145</words> Inside, the mirrors lining the walls offered glimpses of a world that wasn’t quite his own—a world where the planetarium still stood whole, its projector spinning constellations into the night. <words>180</words> He stepped inside, the button box warm against his palm, and caught his reflection in a mirror. <words>200</words> For a moment, he saw not himself, but a man in a different time, holding the same box, his eyes filled with the same determination. <words>230</words>  

The welder moved through the crowd, his movements deliberate, his mind racing. <words>245</words> He knew the box was more than it seemed; it was a key, a bridge between timelines. <words>263</words> He had to pamper it, treat it with care, for it held the power to unravel everything—or to mend it. <words>287</words> The night club’s music thrummed in his chest, a rhythm that felt both familiar and alien, as if it belonged to another time. <words>315</words>  

At the bar, he opened the box, its buttons spilling onto the counter. <words>330</words> Each one was a fragment of a story, a piece of a puzzle he was desperate to solve. <words>350</words> As he touched one, the room shifted, the mirrors flickering with images of the past and future colliding. <words>375</words> He saw the planetarium as it once was, its projector casting stars onto the ceiling, and as it could be, a beacon of light in a broken world. <words>410</words>  

The welder clenched his fists, his resolve hardening. <words>420</words> He would wield the box’s power, not for himself, but to mend the crossing where two timelines should never meet. <words>447</words> The mirrors showed him the way, their glimpses guiding him toward a future where the planetarium’s dome was whole again, its stars shining bright. <words>480</words> He closed the box, its weight a reminder of the task ahead, and stepped back into the night, ready to face the unraveling. <words>510</words></story>
