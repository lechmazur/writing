<story>The jumpy necromancer crept through the pixelated alleyways of the retro video game world, his skeletal fingers trembling as they clutched the fishhook that glowed in moonlight. <words>30</words> The echoing footsteps behind him seemed to multiply with every step, a cacophony of unseen pursuers that made his already erratic movements falter. <words>58</words> He paused, his hollow eyes darting to the walls, where the typically bizarre paint drips of a hidden protest mural caught his attention. <words>88</words> By analyzing the paint drips, he hoped to uncover the truth about the revered icon who ruled this world while the old gods slumbered. <words>116</words> The mural depicted a figure cloaked in light, but the necromancer suspected darkness lay beneath. <words>133</words> His motivation burned fiercely: to unmask the icon and expose the lies that bound this world. <words>150</words> The glow of the fishhook intensified as he traced the mural’s patterns, its light revealing hidden symbols that pulsed with an eerie rhythm. <words>176</words> The footsteps grew louder, their echoes merging into a single, deafening roar. <words>190</words> He turned, his heart—or what remained of it—pounding as he faced the source of the sound. <words>207</words> A shadowy figure emerged, its form shifting like static on an old screen. <words>222</words> The necromancer faltered again, his resolve wavering as the figure spoke in a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. <words>248</words> “Why do you seek to destroy what you cannot understand?” it asked, its tone dripping with clear complexity. <words>269</words> The necromancer steadied himself, gripping the fishhook tighter. <words>281</words> “Because understanding is not the same as truth,” he replied, his voice trembling but resolute. <words>299</words> The figure laughed, a sound that echoed through the alley like the chime of a broken bell. <words>318</words> “Truth is a construct, necromancer. You of all people should know that.” <words>335</words> The necromancer’s eyes narrowed as he stepped forward, the fishhook’s glow illuminating the figure’s face. <words>355</words> What he saw made his undead blood run cold: the icon’s face was his own, twisted into a mask of power and corruption. <words>379</words> “You are me,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the echoing footsteps that now surrounded him. <words>399</words> The figure nodded, its expression unreadable. <words>409</words> “And you are me. We are bound by the same lies, the same truths.” <words>426</words> The necromancer’s hand trembled as he raised the fishhook, its light flickering like a dying star. <words>444</words> “Then I will destroy us both,” he said, plunging the hook into the figure’s chest. <words>461</words> The world around him shattered into pixels, the echoes fading into silence as the old gods stirred in their slumber. <words>483</words> The necromancer stood alone in the void, the fishhook’s glow extinguished, his purpose fulfilled. <words>501</words> But as he turned to leave, he heard a single, echoing footstep behind him, and he knew the cycle would begin again. <words>523</words></story>
