<story>The seasoned woodsman trudged through the radio wave garden, his boots crunching over the artfully messy tangle of wires and antennas that sprouted like metallic weeds. <words>28</words> He carried an antique hairbrush in his pack, its bristles worn smooth by generations of hands, a relic he’d found years ago while mapping abandoned railways. <words>58</words> The final beep of a hospital monitor echoed in his mind, a sound he’d heard just hours ago as he sat by his father’s side, clutching the old man’s hand. <words>92</words> That beep had been a release, a finality, but it had also left him untethered, adrift in a world that suddenly felt too vast and too empty. <words>123</words>  

The woodsman’s goal was clear: to short-circuit the grief that threatened to consume him. <words>143</words> He’d heard rumors of an abandoned water tower deep in the forest, a place where the echoes of the past could be measured, where the truth of one’s heart might be freed by honesty. <words>180</words> The tower stood at the edge of the radio wave garden, its rusted frame silhouetted against the fading light of dusk. <words>204</words> He approached it with a mix of despairing cheer, the kind that comes when one has nothing left to lose but still clings to the hope of finding something. <words>237</words>  

Inside the tower, the air was thick with the scent of damp metal and decay. <words>253</words> He climbed the rickety ladder, each step creaking under his weight, until he reached the top. <words>271</words> There, he pulled the antique hairbrush from his pack and held it aloft, its polished wood catching the last rays of sunlight. <words>299</words> He whispered his father’s name into the hollow space, the sound reverberating off the curved walls, and waited for the echo to return. <words>329</words>  

The echo came, but it was not just a repetition of his voice. <words>345</words> It carried with it a memory: his father, years younger, brushing his mother’s hair with that same brush, their laughter filling the room. <words>375</words> The woodsman felt a pang of sorrow, but also a strange lightness, as if the memory had unlocked something within him. <words>403</words> He whispered again, this time confessing his guilt for not being there more, for not saying the things he’d meant to say. <words>432</words> The echo returned, softer now, forgiving. <words>442</words>  

As he descended the ladder, the woodsman felt a shift, as though the weight of his grief had been measured and found wanting. <words>470</words> He stepped back into the radio wave garden, the wires and antennas now seeming less chaotic, more purposeful. <words>494</words> He would continue mapping the abandoned railways, but now with a new understanding: that the past could not be changed, but it could be carried forward, artfully messy and honest, like the echoes in an abandoned water tower. <words>541</words></story>
