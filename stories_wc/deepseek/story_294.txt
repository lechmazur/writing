<story>The dry-tongued bard stood in the center of the giant mushroom meeting hall, his fingers brushing the stained glass prism that dangled from his belt, its fractured light casting gorgeously awkward patterns on the walls. <words>34</words> The hush of a dreamless night enveloped the space, a crisp languor that seemed to stretch time itself. <words>54</words> He had come here to preserve something—not a song, not a memory, but the cloak of doubt that had wrapped itself around his soul. <words>83</words> It was a heavy burden, this cloak, woven from forgotten voicemails that whispered of failures and regrets, each one a thread in the fabric of his self-imposed prison. <words>118</words>  

The bard’s voice, usually so smooth and commanding, felt like sandpaper in his throat as he began to hum, the sound echoing faintly in the cavernous hall. <words>153</words> He raised the prism to the dim light filtering through the mushroom caps above, watching as the colors danced across the floor like fleeting memories. <words>183</words> Each hue seemed to carry a fragment of the voicemails—his father’s stern tone, a lover’s broken farewell, the hollow laughter of a friend he’d lost. <words>214</words>  

“To escape the prison of the self,” he murmured, his words barely audible, “I must first face the warden.” <words>240</words> The prism trembled in his hand as if it understood, its light intensifying, illuminating the hall in a kaleidoscope of emotions. <words>266</words> The bard closed his eyes, letting the colors wash over him, each one a step closer to unraveling the cloak of doubt. <words>293</words>  

He began to sing, his voice cracking at first but growing stronger with each note. <words>311</words> The forgotten voicemails seemed to rise from the shadows, their words no longer accusations but echoes of a past he could finally release. <words>341</words> The prism’s light pulsed in time with his song, its patterns shifting from awkward to harmonious, as if the hall itself were joining in. <words>371</words>  

As the final note faded, the bard felt the cloak of doubt slip from his shoulders, its threads dissolving into the air like mist. <words>400</words> The prism’s light dimmed, its colors settling into a soft, steady glow. <words>418</words> He stood there, breathing deeply, the weight of his self-imposed prison lifted at last. <words>438</words>  

The giant mushroom meeting hall was silent once more, but the crisp languor of the night felt different now—lighter, freer. <words>463</words> The bard smiled, his dry tongue no longer a barrier but a reminder of the journey he’d taken. <words>486</words> He tucked the prism back into his belt, its light now a quiet companion rather than a beacon of doubt. <words>511</words> As he stepped out into the night, he knew he had preserved not just his past but his future, one song at a time. <words>540</words></story>
