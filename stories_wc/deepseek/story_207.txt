<story>The universe hummed its secret song, a low, resonant vibration that echoed through the abandoned space station’s medical bay, where the forthright peddler stood, clutching a dried flower bouquet. <words>30</words> The petals, brittle and faded, seemed to hold the weight of a thousand unspoken promises, and the peddler’s heart ached with joyful loneliness as he gazed at them. <words>60</words> He had come here to break an oath sealed in blood, a vow that had bound him to a life of wandering and regret. <words>85</words> The bouquet, a relic of a past he could scarcely remember, was the key to his redemption’s path. <words>100</words>  

Meekly assertive, the peddler set the bouquet on a rusted examination table and began to sift through rumor-laden gossip columns he had collected over the years. <words>130</words> The pages were yellowed and fragile, filled with whispers of betrayal, lost loves, and forgotten truths. <words>150</words> He needed to divide fact from fiction, to find the thread that would lead him to the one person who could absolve him of his oath. <words>175</words> The station’s dim lights flickered, casting long shadows that danced like specters around him. <words>195</words>  

As he read, the peddler’s mind wandered to the day he had made the oath, a day steeped in desperation and fear. <words>220</words> He had been a different man then, one who believed that blood could bind a soul to a promise forever. <words>240</words> But time had softened his resolve, and the dried flowers, a gift from the one he had wronged, had become a symbol of his longing for forgiveness. <words>270</words>  

The gossip columns spoke of a woman who had once been a healer on this very station, a woman who had vanished without a trace. <words>300</words> The peddler’s heart quickened as he pieced together the fragments of her story, realizing that she might hold the answer he sought. <words>325</words> He divided the columns into piles, separating the credible from the absurd, until a single name emerged: Elara. <words>350</words>  

With renewed determination, the peddler left the medical bay, the dried flower bouquet cradled in his arms. <words>375</words> The station’s corridors were silent, save for the hum of the universe, which seemed to guide his steps. <words>400</words> He knew that finding Elara would not be easy, but the path to redemption was never meant to be. <words>425</words>  

As he stepped into the station’s docking bay, the peddler felt a strange sense of peace. <words>445</words> The universe’s song grew louder, a symphony of hope and possibility, and he knew that he was no longer alone. <words>470</words> The dried flowers, once a symbol of his guilt, now represented the promise of a new beginning. <words>495</words> With a final glance at the abandoned station, the peddler set off into the stars, ready to face whatever lay ahead. <words>520</words></story>
