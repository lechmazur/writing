<story>The dismayed minstrel sat in the black velvet sky-lounge, his fingers absently tracing the frayed edges of a broken watch band, its timekeeping purpose long abandoned. <words>30</words> The lounge floated above an endless city, its lights flickering like distant stars, and the minstrel’s gaze lingered on the horizon, where the sky and the urban sprawl blurred into one. <words>63</words> He was here, amid garden secrets, to excavate something intangible yet vital—a map of an endless night. <words>86</words> The task felt subjectively rational, a pursuit only he could justify, though its logic eluded others. <words>103</words>  

On the table before him lay a stack of old Polaroid photographs, their edges curled and colors faded. <words>123</words> Each image was a fragment of a memory, a boundary drawn between what was and what could be. <words>140</words> He studied them with laconic exuberance, his movements deliberate yet tinged with a quiet urgency. <words>155</words> The photographs revealed patterns—shadows cast by lampposts, the curve of a forgotten alley, the silhouette of a clock tower—that he believed held the key to his map. <words>183</words>  

The minstrel’s motivation was not merely to chart the city but to understand its rhythm, its heartbeat. <words>202</words> He saw the endless night as a canvas, and the map as his guide to navigating its depths. <words>219</words> The broken watch band, once a symbol of order, now represented the fluidity of time in this place, where moments stretched and contracted like shadows. <words>246</words>  

As he pieced together the fragments, he felt a growing sense of clarity. <words>259</words> The boundaries he drew were not just lines on paper but markers of his own journey, his own reckoning with the infinite. <words>282</words> The sky-lounge hummed softly, its presence a reminder of the vastness above and below. <words>301</words>  

By the time the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, the minstrel had completed his map. <words>322</words> It was not a perfect rendering, but it was his—a testament to his persistence and his peculiar vision. <words>344</words> He leaned back, the broken watch band slipping from his fingers, and smiled. <words>360</words> The endless night was no longer a mystery but a companion, its secrets now woven into the fabric of his understanding. <words>385</words>  

The minstrel rose, leaving the photographs and the watch band behind, and stepped into the new day. <words>405</words> The sky-lounge drifted onward, its journey as endless as the city below, and the minstrel carried his map with him, a guide to the boundless and the unknown. <words>435</words> In that moment, he felt not dismay but a quiet triumph, his laconic exuberance a fitting tribute to the night he had mapped and the boundaries he had drawn. <words>465</words> The endless city stretched before him, and he walked into it, his heart light and his purpose clear. <words>485</words></story>
