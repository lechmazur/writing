<story>The reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper hummed with an energetically lethargic rhythm, the vines creeping up the shattered glass walls as if they couldn’t decide whether to grow or collapse. <words>34</words> At the instant a frozen computer finally restarted, its screen flickering to life in the corner of the makeshift greenhouse, a bluffing swindler named Elias dropped his book, its pages splaying open like a wounded bird. <words>74</words> The sound magnetized the attention of a woman across the room, her hands paused mid-pruning as she turned to meet his gaze. <words>98</words> “You’re not supposed to be here,” she said with a gentle harshness, her voice cutting through the humid air like a blade wrapped in silk. <words>128</words> Elias, ever the performer, flashed a grin and held up the blank price tag he’d been fiddling with, as if it were a badge of legitimacy. <words>153</words> “Neither are these apples,” he quipped, gesturing to the fruit dangling from the twisted branches. <words>170</words> The woman, whose name was Mara, narrowed her eyes but didn’t call him out—not yet. <words>187</words> Instead, she bent to pick up his book, her fingers brushing against the spine as if it were a relic. <words>206</words> “Poetry?” she asked, her tone softening just enough to make Elias wonder if she was mocking him. <words>226</words> “Philosophy,” he corrected, though the distinction felt trivial under her scrutiny. <words>241</words> Their meet-cute was interrupted by the faint rustle of invisible allies—shadows that seemed to shift without light, whispers that carried no sound. <words>266</words> Mara’s expression darkened, and Elias felt the weight of her unspoken truth pressing against the air between them. <words>286</words> “You’re here to bare a truth no one dares to handle, aren’t you?” she said, her voice low but steady. <words>307</words> Elias hesitated, his usual bravado faltering under her piercing gaze. <words>321</words> He had come to swindle, to charm, to escape—but now, standing in this strange orchard, he felt the pull of something deeper, something he couldn’t quite name. <words>352</words> “Maybe,” he admitted, the word tasting foreign on his tongue. <words>363</words> Mara nodded, as if she’d expected nothing less, and handed him back the book. <words>380</words> “Then let’s see if you’re brave enough to face it,” she said, her voice a blend of challenge and invitation. <words>400</words> Together, they stepped deeper into the orchard, the invisible allies trailing behind like silent sentinels, the blank price tag still clutched in Elias’s hand—a symbol of something yet to be defined. <words>435</words> The computer’s hum faded into the background, replaced by the rustle of leaves and the unspoken promise of a truth neither of them could ignore. <words>460</words> In that moment, Elias realized he wasn’t just a swindler anymore; he was a man on the edge of something real, something that might just change everything. <words>488</words> And Mara, with her gentle harshness and unyielding resolve, was the only one who could guide him there. <words>509</words> The orchard, the skyscraper, the invisible allies—they were all part of a story bigger than either of them, a story that had only just begun. <words>535</words></story>
