<story>The wry caretaker leaned against the cold metal wall of the space pirate ship’s cargo hold, a piece of chalk twirling absently between their fingers. <words>25</words> The air was thick with the scent of oil and the faint hum of machinery, but their mind was elsewhere, lost in the nature of time. <words>50</words> They had always been warmly aloof, a paradox that made them both approachable and untouchable, like a star you could see but never reach. <words>75</words> The outdated phone on the crate beside them emitted a faint dial tone, a relic of a world that no longer existed, until it abruptly cut out, leaving silence in its wake. <words>100</words> That silence was a trigger, a reminder of the endless “what if” siren song that haunted them—what if they had chosen differently, what if they had stayed, what if they had vanished like so many others? <words>150</words>  

They pushed off the wall, their boots echoing softly as they crossed the hold. <words>165</words> The piece of chalk in their hand felt heavier now, a tool and a burden. <words>180</words> They knelt on the floor, their movements deliberate, and began to sketch lines and curves, tracking the paths of clouds they had seen through the ship’s viewport earlier. <words>215</words> It was a method they had devised to quiet the noise in their mind, to ground themselves in something tangible, something that moved with the rhythm of the universe. <words>250</words>  

As the chalk danced across the floor, the caretaker’s thoughts drifted to the crew, to the pirates who laughed and fought and lived as if time were infinite. <words>285</words> They envied that, even as they pitied it. <words>295</words> Time wasn’t infinite; it was a thief, a trickster, a force that could vanish in the blink of an eye. <words>315</words> The caretaker’s sketches grew more intricate, a map of moments that had already passed, a futile attempt to capture what could never be held. <words>345</words>  

The ship shuddered slightly, a reminder that they were hurtling through the void, untethered and unmoored. <words>365</words> The caretaker paused, their hand hovering above the floor, and let out a sigh that carried the weight of a thousand unspoken words. <words>390</words> They knew they couldn’t silence the “what ifs” forever, but for now, this was enough. <words>410</words> The chalk lines were a testament to their effort, a gentle harshness that acknowledged the futility of their task even as they embraced it. <words>440</words>  

They stood, brushing chalk dust from their hands, and glanced at the phone, now silent and still. <words>460</words> The caretaker smiled faintly, a wry twist of their lips, and turned away, leaving the sketches behind as they vanished into the shadows of the hold. <words>490</words> The clouds outside continued their endless dance, and the ship carried on, a fleeting moment in the vast expanse of time. <words>515</words></story>
