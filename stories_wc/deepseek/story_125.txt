<story>The underachieving mage slumped in the abandoned space station control room, staring at the doll head with blinking eyes that had arrived via misdelivered packages. <words>28</words> The station, perched at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, hummed with a bored excitement, as if it too were waiting for something to happen. <words>57</words> The mage, whose name was Kael, had always been exceptionally usual—mediocre spells, forgettable presence, and a knack for blending into the background. <words>86</words> But today, he felt a strange pull, as though the doll head was whispering secrets only he could hear. <words>105</words>  

Kael picked up the doll head, its glassy eyes blinking in rhythm with the flickering lights of the control room. <words>128</words> It was unnerving, yet oddly comforting, like a relic from a past he barely remembered. <words>145</words> His family had once been renowned mages, but their legacy had crumbled into obscurity, leaving him with nothing but a vague sense of loss. <words>170</words> Reclaiming heritage had always seemed like a distant dream, but now, holding the doll head, it felt tantalizingly close. <words>192</words>  

He decided to unveil the truth, whatever it might be. <words>203</words> The doll head’s eyes blinked faster as he muttered an incantation, one he’d half-learned from a dusty tome years ago. <words>226</words> The control room shuddered, and a holographic map of the farmland below materialized in the air. <words>245</words> Kael’s heart raced as he realized the map wasn’t just a map—it was a trap, one designed to spring on his own limitations. <words>269</words>  

The farmland, soon to be sold, was a nexus of ancient magic, a place where his ancestors had once wielded unimaginable power. <words>293</words> The doll head was a key, a fragment of their legacy, and it had found its way to him for a reason. <words>314</words> Kael’s usual mediocrity had been a shield, a way to avoid the weight of expectation, but now he saw it for what it was: a self-imposed prison. <words>343</words>  

With a deep breath, he activated the control panel, the doll head’s eyes glowing brighter with each command. <words>364</words> The station’s systems roared to life, and the farmland below began to shimmer with latent energy. <words>383</words> Kael felt a surge of power, not from the station, but from within himself. <words>399</words> He was no longer the underachieving mage; he was the heir to a forgotten legacy, and he was ready to reclaim it. <words>423</words>  

As the farmland’s magic surged, Kael realized the trap had been set not by his ancestors, but by himself. <words>445</words> His limitations had always been a choice, and now, with the doll head in hand and the station at his command, he chose to break free. <words>470</words> The boundary of farmland soon to be sold became a threshold, and Kael stepped across it, leaving mediocrity behind. <words>494</words> The doll head’s eyes blinked one last time, as if to say, “Welcome home.” <words>510</words></story>
