The meek necromancer wandered the underground city of the goblins, his footsteps echoing softly amid playground sounds of laughter and clattering stones. <words>28</words> In his hand, he clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib, its once-elegant tip now jagged and useless, yet peculiarly sincere in its imperfection. <words>55</words> He had come here to decode a universal riddle, one whispered to him by the tangled tapestry of life and death that he had spent years unraveling. <words>88</words> The tapestry was not just a metaphor; it hung in the heart of the city, woven from threads of memory, light, and shadow, its patterns shifting like a living thing. <words>121</words>  

The necromancer paused before the tapestry, his eyes tracing its intricate designs, searching for the key to regain what he had lost—not power, but understanding. <words>156</words> He had always been too timid to command the dead with authority, too gentle to wield necromancy as others did, yet his meekness had led him here, to this moment of mystic simplicity. <words>196</words> The goblins, with their sharp eyes and clever hands, had long guarded the tapestry, believing it held the secrets of existence itself. <words>226</words>  

As he stood there, a single dew drop formed on the cavern ceiling above, catching the faint light of the city’s glowing fungi. <words>256</words> The necromancer watched, transfixed, as the light reflected off the droplet, casting a prismatic glow onto the tapestry. <words>281</words> In that moment, the patterns seemed to shift, revealing a hidden message, a truth that had eluded him for so long. <words>309</words>  

He raised the broken pen, its jagged nib trembling in his hand, and began to trace the newly revealed lines on a scrap of parchment. <words>339</words> The ink flowed unevenly, but the words that emerged were clear: “To decode the riddle, one must see not with eyes, but with the heart of light.” <words>375</words> The necromancer’s breath caught, for he realized that the answer lay not in the tapestry itself, but in the way it interacted with the world around it—the light, the dew, the very air. <words>417</words>  

With newfound clarity, he stepped back, his heart pounding. <words>429</words> The playground sounds faded into the background as he whispered the words aloud, feeling their truth resonate within him. <words>454</words> The tapestry shimmered, its threads unraveling and reweaving themselves into a new pattern, one that spoke of unity, of life and death intertwined, of the eternal dance of existence. <words>497</words> The necromancer smiled, his meekness no longer a weakness but a strength, for it had led him to this moment of profound revelation. <words>528</words>
