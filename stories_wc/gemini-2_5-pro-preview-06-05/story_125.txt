Kael lounged in the captain's chair, the cracked leather sighing under his weight with a familiar, dusty apathy. <words>17</words>
The abandoned space station control room was his private kingdom of failure, half-buried at the boundary of the family farmland his uncle was days from selling. <words>41</words>
A familiar sense of bored excitement fizzed in his veins, the cheap thrill of trespassing on his own dwindling legacy. <words>59</words>
For months, the universe had been sending him gifts via misdelivered packages, a cosmic clerical error he'd decided to interpret as a calling. <words>82</words>
He nudged the last cardboard box with his boot, its shipping label addressed to a tech-recycler three towns over. <words>102</words>
Inside, nestled in packing peanuts, was an object so exceptionally usual it was almost offensive: a plastic doll head with glassy, blinking eyes. <words>127</words>
This was the final piece he needed, the last component in a puzzle he hadn't even known he was meant to solve. <words>148</words>
His ancestors, the so-called Astromancers, had built this place, weaving magic and metal into something that could touch the heavens before it fell back to earth. <words>178</words>
He, their descendant, was an underachieving mage who could barely light a candle without singeing his eyebrows. <words>198</words>
This whole endeavor was a meticulously planned trap, not for an enemy, but for the suffocating mediocrity that had defined his entire life. <words>225</words>
He was here to spring a trap on his own limitations, to force a confrontation with the potential he'd always been too lazy or too scared to face. <words>256</words>
With a grunt, Kael stood and carried the doll head to the main console, a gaping socket in its center waiting like an open mouth. <words>283</words>
He slotted the head into the port; it clicked into place with unnerving satisfaction. <words>297</words>
The doll's eyes blinked once, slowly. <words>303</words>
Kael muttered the simplest cantrip he knew, a weak pulse of energy that was more hope than magic. <words>321</words>
A low hum vibrated through the deck plates, and the doll's eyes began to blink in a steady, rhythmic pulse, each flutter matched by a flicker from the dormant consoles. <words>352</words>
Ancient screens, dead for a century, sparked to life around him in a cascade of cerulean light. <words>369</words>
He was ready to unveil what his family had hidden here, to see if he was worthy of the name Astromancer. <words>391</words>
But the screens didn't show star charts or alien schematics; they displayed the farmland outside, overlaid with a shimmering, intricate web of power he now controlled. <words>422</words>
He hadn't just reclaimed a crashed ship; he had reclaimed his heritage, a kingdom of magic hidden in plain sight, and the boredom was finally, thrillingly gone. <words>451</words>
