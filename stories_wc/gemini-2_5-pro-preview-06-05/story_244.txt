The last petal from the old rosebush had fallen to the workshop floor, a dried crimson tear on the oil-stained concrete. <words>20</words>
Kaelen felt its finality in her bones, a quiet signal that the time for waiting was over. <words>35</words>
Her hands, calloused from both the hilt of a sword and the delicate wiring of argon tubes, were steady as she lifted the tribal mask from its velvet cloth. <words>62</words>
Its wooden surface was a dizzying labyrinth of carvings, a map she had spent years learning to read. <words>79</words>
The weight of the blade she'd once wielded felt heavier in memory than this physical key to her future. <words>98</words>
Guilt was a phantom limb, an ache for the life she had severed with a single, perfect strike. <words>115</words>
She had come to this neon sign repair shop to mend things, a futile penance for a soul she had shattered. <words>135</words>
But mending was not enough; she needed release. <words>143</words>
Her pursuit had been a quiet, desperate thing. <words>151</words>
She moved through the city's underbelly, a ghost in the archives of forgotten lore. <words>165</words>
She had learned to pursue the door of release by gleaning secrets from half-truth historians, men who traded whispers for coin in dusty backrooms. <words>191</words>
Each one gave her a fragment: the celestial alignment, the required incantation, the specific frequency of light needed to awaken the wood. <words>214</words>
They thought her a collector, a wealthy eccentric, never guessing she sought not a prize but an escape. <words>232</words>
Now, all the half-truths had coalesced into one terrifying, beautiful certainty. <words>243</words>
With a reservedly bold flick of a switch, she killed the main lights, plunging the workshop into near-darkness. <words>261</words>
Only one sign remained lit, a custom piece she had painstakingly restored: a spiraling blue serpent. <words>279</words>
Its hum was a low mantra in the sudden silence. <words>289</words>
She raised the mask to her face, the worn wood cool against her skin. <words>302</words>
Through its slitted eyes, the neon serpent's glow refracted, casting the labyrinthine carvings as a shimmering projection onto the brick wall opposite her. <words>329</words>
The lines of light twisted and folded, pulling away from the brick to form a shimmering, depthless archway. <words>347</words>
It did not lead to a place she knew, but that was the entire point. <words>362</words>
Her motivation was never to find a better world, only to open a door to the unknown, a place where the woman she had been could not follow. <words>391</words>
The air grew cold, smelling of ozone and ancient dust. <words>400</words>
The door of release pulsed with a mellow intensity, a silent invitation to leave her guilt behind like a discarded tool. <words>420</words>
She let the mask fall from her face, its purpose served. <words>430</words>
Taking a single, steady breath, Kaelen stepped forward to embrace the void. <words>442</words>
