The rivets of the observation deck wept rust, each tear a memory of the surface world's broken treaties. <words>18</words>
Elara, a wayward apothecary by trade and temperament, paid the corrosion no mind. <words>31</words>
Her gaze was fixed on the crushing blue-black of the abyss, a place of battered marvel where light came only from the things that lived in it. <words>58</words>
She was down here to track the migratory butterflies, a motivation that had earned her exile and this magnificent, groaning vessel. <words>82</words>
No one on the surface understood that the Azure Emperors didn't fly through air, but swam through the deep sea currents, their wings shimmering with captured starlight. <words>114</words>
Her unconventional love for them was a fierce, quiet thing, born in a world that only valued creatures it could grind into fuel or weapons. <words>143</words>
In her hand, she clutched a dry highlighter pen, its felt tip desiccated and its plastic casing scarred. <words>163</words>
It was a relic from her old life, a tool of annotation now repurposed for percussion. <words>180</words>
A flicker appeared in the distance, then another, a constellation of impossible life drifting toward her. <words>198</words>
Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drum matching the thrum of the submarine's engines. <words>217</words>
She lifted the pen and began to tap against the thick quartz pane. <words>231</words>
It was not a greeting, but a diagnosis. <words>239</words>
Through morse code signals of pulsed light from a small emitter synced to her taps, she began to infect them. <words>259</words>
The code carried the sequence for a benign, bioluminescent virus she had engineered in the sub's cramped laboratory. <words>279</words>
It would not kill them, but it would change the very light they produced, making them invisible to the military sensors of the nations above. <words>307</words>
Her love demanded she make them untouchable, a species preserved through a gentle sickness. <words>323</words>
The first butterfly passed the window, its azure glow now flickering with the ghost-green of her contagion. <words>343</words>
It was unjustly fair, this act of salvation through violation, a beautiful creature made more beautiful and yet tainted to ensure its survival. <words>369</words>
The entire swarm followed, a river of altered light, each pulse a testament to her desperate, protective love. <words>388</words>
They were safe from the world of men, but they now carried her mark, a signature of sickness that was also a shield. <words>414</words>
As the last one vanished into the gloom, Elara lowered the highlighter, its purpose served. <words>430</words>
She was their solitary guardian in the deep, her heart a battered marvel, beating in time with the silent, infected wings she had just set free. <words>456</words>
