Kael smirked, the lone sentinel in the humming heart of the magnetic field observatory. <words>14</words>
His superiors, those plodding gods of mediocrity, thought he was just watching the data streams. <words>29</words>
They had no idea he was about to steal their thunder right from under their noses. <words>45</words>
He placed the small, metallic spinning top onto the central console's induction plate. <words>58</words>
It was a relic, an elegant focus tool for a forbidden art he had perfected through stolen glimpses of parallel realities. <words>79</words>
The top began to whir, its polished surface blurring as it stabilized a connection to a world just adjacent to his own. <words>101</words>
Shimmering images coalesced on the main screen, depicting a life that felt both alien and intimately known, a sensation of mysterious familiarity that always unsettled him. <words>131</words>
This reality was a perfect construct, artificially authentic in its every detail, from the scent of rain on pavement he could almost smell to the warmth of a hand he could almost feel. <words>168</words>
In that world, another Kael laughed freely, his arm around a woman whose smile was the brightest thing in that captured universe. <words>192</words>
A sharp pang of conflicting loyalties struck him; his duty was to this cold, sterile room, but his heart yearned for the fabricated warmth on the screen. <words>225</words>
He was a guardian of this reality, yet he coveted another. <words>236</words>
Pushing the field emitters beyond their safety protocols, he tried to sharpen the image, to hear her voice, to steal just one more perfect moment. <words>263</words>
The observatory groaned in protest, lights flickering as the magnetic containment field wavered. <words>277</words>
The spinning top wobbled violently, its perfect hum turning into a discordant shriek. <words>291</words>
On the screen, the idyllic scene fractured. <words>298</words>
He saw the other Kael's face contort in sudden, silent agony as the woman dissolved into static before his eyes. <words>319</words>
The raw, vicarious pain of that loss slammed into him with the force of a physical blow. <words>335</words>
A short, sharp yelp escaped his lips, an involuntary sound of shock that shattered his carefully constructed overconfidence. <words>354</words>
The connection severed, plunging the screen back into scrolling lines of meaningless code. <words>367</words>
Kael stared at the dead monitor, the ghost of a stolen life imprinted on his mind. <words>382</words>
The spinning top lay motionless on the console, a dull piece of metal once more. <words>397</words>
He stood perfectly still in the sudden silence, his throat tight and his eyes burning, caught in the final, agonizing moment before the first tear is shed. <words>426</words>
