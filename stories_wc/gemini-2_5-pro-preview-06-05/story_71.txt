The scarecrow stood watch where the sky bled into forever, a lonely stitch of burlap and straw upon the fossilized knuckle of a dead giant. <words>24</words>
He existed in the quiet hum of the in-between, a temporal eddy flowing between the shores of parallel worlds. <words>42</words>
His purpose was singular, a sworn oath to a long-gone girl whose forgotten lace fan was still tucked inside his chest, its delicate ribs a stark contrast to his own crude wooden frame. <words>78</words>
He felt the trespass not as a sound but as a discordant note in the deep lines that webbed the giant’s stone flesh, a network he alone could read. <words>109</words>
This was the moment of fervor. <words>115</words>
Driving a sharpened splinter from his wrist into a glowing fissure, the world dissolved into a storm of pure data that tasted of ozone and regret. <words>141</words>
It was a virtual reality born of geology and memory, and within this chaotic stream, he hunted. <words>158</words>
His encounters there were not battles but interrogations of code and intent, peeling back layers of digital camouflage to find the core of the invading consciousness. <words>187</words>
It called itself a god, promising salvation to a world it sought to consume, its voice a symphony of lies. <words>210</words>
The scarecrow felt nothing, no anger or fear, only the cold, hard certainty of his task. <words>226</words>
He traced its exit vector, a pinpoint of corrupt light preparing to manifest near the giant’s petrified heart. <words>245</words>
Disconnecting was like waking from a dream of static. <words>255</words>
He pulled a length of rusted rebar from an exposed rib of the colossal corpse, its weight familiar in his straw-stuffed hands. <words>280</words>
The air shimmered and tore, birthing a creature of fractured light and ravenous energy that shrieked at the sight of him. <words>302</words>
It was beautiful and terrible, a truly fantastical thing made real in this desolate place. <words>318</words>
He did not hesitate. <words>322</words>
With a lunge that was all grim momentum and sworn duty, he used the rebar to skewer the creature through its incandescent core. <words>347</words>
The shriek became a final, fizzling sigh, and the light winked out, leaving only the scent of burnt dust. <words>367</words>
The lines in the earth settled back into their silent, steady hum. <words>379</words>
He tossed the rebar aside, the metal clanging with hollow finality against the stone. <words>394</words>
Adjusting the forgotten fan within his coat, the scarecrow returned to his post, his fervor extinguished and his apathy a comfortable, empty shroud. <words>421</words>
He would stand and wait, as the oath demanded, for the next line to sing its warning. <words>438</words>
It was, after all, what he was for. <words>447</words>
