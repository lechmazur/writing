The air in the mirror maze was a calculated wilderness of stale popcorn and ozone, a place where reality had been deliberately fractured. <words>22</words>
Captain Eva Rostova clutched the frayed coil of rope in her pocket, its familiar texture a grounding force against the disorienting reflections. <words>44</words>
It was the last remnant of her prison escape, a physical testament to her own spark of defiance she had come here to stand guard over. <words>71</words>
This haunted amusement park was her shore leave, a self-prescribed trial. <words>82</words>
Outside this labyrinth, in a world she fought to remember, an old orchard cat dozed beneath the skeletal branches of a dying tree. <words>108</words>
That quiet image was the peace she defended. <words>117</words>
The mirrors began to shimmer not with her likeness, but with strange cosmic echoes of the faces that had once condemned her. <words>141</words>
Their sneers warped the glass, their whispered prejudices slithering from the walls—"mutineer," "abomination," "unfit to lead." <words>161</words>
They were the ghosts of a judgment she had long since outsailed, yet here they were, resurrected in cheap carnival glass. <words>184</words>
Eva’s mission was not to fight them, but to confront the prejudice by refusing it purchase in her soul. <words>205</words>
She began to move with a new purpose, a gait that was deliberately accidental. <words>219</words>
When a panel flared with the face of her xenophobic first mate, she stumbled, her shoulder hitting the mirror with a sharp crack. <words>243</words>
The image fractured into a thousand harmless shards of light. <words>253</words>
She would simply overlook them. <words>258</words>
Another echo formed, the prosecuting council from her tribunal, his voice booming with false authority. <words>276</words>
Eva turned a corner too sharply, her boot scuffing the panel's base and making the entire reflection shudder and dissolve into meaningless patterns. <words>301</words>
Each collision, each near-miss, was a carefully choreographed dismissal, an assertion that these phantoms were nothing more than clumsy obstacles in her path. <words>329</words>
She was a daring ship captain navigating a treacherous asteroid field, not a prisoner reliving her trial. <words>347</words>
The echoes grew frantic, sensing their powerlessness, their forms twisting into a singular, monstrous visage of collective hatred in the maze’s central chamber. <words>375</words>
It roared silently, demanding her attention, her fear, her anger. <words>386</words>
Eva met its gaze for a single, defiant second. <words>395</words>
Then, with the practiced ease of a mariner ignoring a rogue wave she knew would not capsize her vessel, she looked past it, focusing on the reflection of the exit sign glowing faintly behind the monstrous form. <words>440</words>
She walked straight through the illusion, the cosmic static crackling harmlessly against her skin, her hand never leaving the rope in her pocket. <words>466</words>
The wilderness had been navigated, its calculated chaos mastered not by force, but by the quiet, unyielding refusal to be seen as anything less than who she was. <words>497</words>
