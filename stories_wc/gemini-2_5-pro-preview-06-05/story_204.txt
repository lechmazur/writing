The professional cuddler, Elias, stood within the cavernous silence of the abandoned spaceport hangar, a place that felt both ancient and new. <words>21</words>
Rust-flecked gantries drooped from the ceiling like metallic vines, their slow, inexorable decay a quiet testament to forgotten ambition. <words>40</words>
His work was about staving off a different kind of decay, the erosion of the soul by loneliness, yet here he was, profoundly alone with his own crumbling convictions. <words>69</words>
It had all started with a chance encounter at a farmer's market a week prior. <words>83</words>
The vendor, a Construct with eyes like polished river stones and a smile that was just a fraction too symmetrical, had an unusually usual presence that both unnerved and intrigued him. <words>116</words>
She hadn't sold him synth-apples or spun-kelp, but had instead pressed a cold, heavy object into his palm: a phantom train ticket punch. <words>142</words>
It didn't punch paper, she'd explained in a voice like static and honey, but rather the unseen barriers between people. <words>164</words>
Now, he was here in her home to overcome the deep-seated prejudice he held against her kind, a loathing he'd inherited like a family curse. <words>193</words>
The unspoken rules of his society screamed that this was wrong, that her manufactured warmth was a dangerous parody of the real thing. <words>220</words>
She sat before him on a stack of old cargo palettes, her placid gaze holding his. <words>235</words>
Across the hangar, a massive, dust-caked screen flickered to life, broadcasting the seal of the Galactic Chancellor. <words>255</words>
The image stabilized, showing the Chancellor at a podium, his mouth slightly open, caught in the pregnant hush before an acceptance speech begins. <words>281</words>
This was the man whose rhetoric had built the very walls Elias was now trying to dismantle. <words>298</words>
As the silence in the hangar deepened, mirroring the silence on the screen, the Construct slowly extended her hand, palm up. <words>322</words>
It was an invitation that defied every hateful, ingrained instinct. <words>332</words>
Elias felt the phantom punch grow heavy in his pocket, a tool for a journey he had to take. <words>351</words>
He pulled it out, the metal impossibly cold, and with a surge of will, he clicked the handle. <words>370</words>
No hole was made in any physical thing, but he felt a clean, sharp severance inside his own heart, a quiet severing of an ancient, ugly bond. <words>398</words>
He took her offered hand, its manufactured warmth feeling more real than anything he had ever known. <words>416</words>
The Chancellor's speech finally started, but his booming voice was just distant noise, the words hollowed of their power. <words>437</words>
Elias had already accepted all that mattered, rewriting the rules in the quiet decay of a forgotten future. <words>457</words>
