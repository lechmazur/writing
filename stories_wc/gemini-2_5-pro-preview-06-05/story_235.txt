Kaelen sat in the sunlit atrium of the reimagined castle, its ancient stone now framing vast panes of glass for their art class. <words>22</words>
He was a remote herbalist among painters, more comfortable with root systems than with charcoal sticks. <words>37</words>
Across the room, Elara sketched, oblivious to the silent orbit he had begun to trace around her. <words>54</words>
His motivation was simple, if strange: to provoke an unspoken conversation between them. <words>67</words>
The method had come to him during a sleepless night, watching the Perseids streak across the sky. <words>83</words>
He realized he could decode patterns in the ephemeral meteor showers, translating cosmic paths into earthly gestures. <words>100</words>
These patterns spoke of intertwined fates, a celestial map for a connection that defied words. <words>115</words>
His tool was a heavy, leather-bound pressed flower book, each blossom a word in a forgotten language. <words>133</words>
During their first still-life session, a meteor shower’s pattern had resembled the curve of a pressed wolfsbane leaf. <words>151</words>
The next day in class, Kaelen waited for the instructor to turn away. <words>165</words>
He would then reposition a single fallen petal on the velvet cloth, a dramatically subtle shift mimicking the toxic flower’s shape. <words>186</words>
It was a warning, a note of caution, reflecting a pattern of celestial interference he’d observed. <words>202</words>
Throughout the following art classes, his actions continued, always quiet, always precise. <words>215</words>
A tilted pear mirrored the arc of a Leonid shower and the form of a pressed columbine, signifying foolishness. <words>235</words>
A stray brush repositioned by a hair’s breadth echoed a meteor’s sharp trajectory and the lines of a gladiolus, for strength of character. <words>259</words>
He watched Elara from a distance, a growing intimacy crackling in the space between them. <words>275</words>
She would pause, her eyes narrowing slightly at the still-life arrangement, a flicker of confusion and then recognition crossing her face. <words>298</words>
He never looked at her directly when she noticed, instead focusing on the grain of his drawing paper. <words>317</words>
The final meteor shower of the semester was a brilliant, slow-burning cascade, a pattern of profound clarity. <words>335</words>
It matched the pressed Queen Anne’s Lace in his book, a flower that meant sanctuary. <words>351</words>
In the last class, Kaelen moved to the central display while the others gathered supplies. <words>367</words>
He gently repositioned three fallen cherry blossoms into the delicate, web-like cluster of the flower from his book. <words>387</words>
He returned to his easel, his heart a quiet drum against his ribs. <words>399</words>
Elara approached the still-life, her gaze fixed on the blossoms he had arranged. <words>413</words>
She did not touch them. <words>418</words>
Instead, she returned to her own canvas and, with three delicate strokes of white paint, added a tiny, star-like cluster to the corner of her painting. <words>444</words>
It was an answer, a confirmation, a shared secret held in the quiet air of the old castle. <words>462</words>
Their fates had touched, not with a sound, but with the silent, perfect alignment of stars and petals. <words>481</words>
