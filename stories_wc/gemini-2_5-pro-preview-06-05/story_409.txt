My knuckles were raw, the skin split over old scars, but the fight I faced wasn't in any ring. <words>18</words>
It was here, in this dusty attic of my own mind, surrounded by the silent, ticking menagerie of my failures. <words>37</words>
Each clockwork animal—a brass songbird that never sang, a silver fox that never ran—was a monument to a life expertly planned and spectacularly failed. <words>62</words>
I was a master of the blueprint, a fool with the bricks. <words>74</words>
My thumb traced the jagged edge of the clay pot shard I held, its familiar weight a cold anchor in my trembling hand. <words>96</words>
The inscription wasn't a name or a date, but a command I had long ignored: *Be shaped by truth, not comfort*. <words>116</words>
Tonight, I would finally obey, driven by the need to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception that had poisoned my core. <words>136</words>
My target was a phantom, the most dangerous part of me, the one who whispered that my carefully constructed lies were a form of strength. <words>161</words>
I had to abduct him from the landscape of my own history, to pull him out through the forgotten dreams where he hid. <words>184</words>
I closed my eyes, the dust motes dancing behind my lids like fading stars, and began the descent. <words>201</words>
The process was intricate, a ritual of memory and will I had perfected through countless botched attempts. <words>219</words>
I navigated the corridors of sleep, past echoes of hollow victories and celebrated defeats, seeking the chamber where he resided. <words>241</words>
He was there, smiling with my own mouth, polishing a clockwork lion that purred with contentment. <words>258</words>
"You can't unmake me," he said, his voice a soothing poison. <words>269</words>
"We built this place together." <words>275</words>
"We built a cage," I countered, my own voice raw with a truth I was only now learning to speak. <words>294</words>
I had to stand for something, even if it meant standing on the ruins of the man I thought I was. <words>314</words>
The world outside my mind seemed to hold its breath, poised at a precipice of creation. <words>330</words>
I could feel it, a sharp, resonant vibration that was not of my own making: the exact moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble. <words>356</words>
In that instant of irreversible beginning, I lunged. <words>364</words>
I didn't fight him with fists, but with acceptance, with the brutal weight of every self-deception I had ever swallowed. <words>384</words>
I grabbed not his body, but his purpose, his reason for being, and extinguished it with the cold, hard light of reality. <words>406</words>
He dissolved into motes of dust, just like the ones dancing in the attic air. <words>421</words>
I opened my eyes to the silent attic. <words>428</words>
The clockwork animals had all stopped ticking. <words>434</words>
The shard in my hand felt different, no longer an accusation but a foundation. <words>447</words>
I was still bruised, still a fighter, but the opponent was finally gone. <words>460</words>
The silence was vast and terrifying, but for the first time, it was honest. <words>473</words>
A block of marble somewhere had its first scar, and so did I. <words>486</words>
