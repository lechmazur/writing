My career as a meteorologist was a litany of bad luck, a joke written in storm fronts and failed forecasts. <words>19</words>
It was this cosmic misfortune that drove me down, into the subterranean city of the Saurians. <words>35</words>
Here, at least, the sky couldn't mock me. <words>43</words>
My motivation was pure science: to study the behavior of the city's bioluminescent flora, strange plants that pulsed with an otherworldly light. <words>66</words>
The Saurians, however, saw them as sacred ancestors, creating a tense standoff between our colliding interests. <words>83</words>
Their society operated with a systematically chaotic grace, full of rituals I could barely comprehend. <words>100</words>
Desperate to chart a newly-bloomed cavern, I took a shortcut through a darkened, crystalline passage. <words>117</words>
My unexpected encounter was with a towering Saurian guard, scales like obsidian, blocking the path. <words>134</words>
His name was Xylos, and his eyes held the cold fire of a dying star. <words>149</words>
"The Sky-Watcher trespasses," he hissed, his voice a low rumble. <words>159</words>
I clutched the old mariner's sextant at my belt, a useless relic of my past life that I couldn't abandon. <words>179</words>
"I only wish to observe the light," I said, my own voice thin. <words>192</words>
"Words are wind," Xylos countered, dropping into a low stance. <words>202</words>
"Show me your intent." <words>206</words>
He didn't draw a weapon; instead, he began to spar, his movements fluid and predatory, forcing me to dodge and weave between stalagmites. <words>231</words>
It was a test, not a battle, a dance of aggression and inquiry. <words>244</words>
My clumsy footwork was no match for his coiled power. <words>255</words>
He backed me against a wall of glowing moss, the air thick with the sweet, cloying scent of ozone and decay. <words>277</words>
This was the city's essence, a bitter honey that promised beauty and delivered peril. <words>292</words>
"Why are you truly here?" he demanded, his hand hovering near my throat. <words>304</words>
Panic gave way to a strange, weary clarity. <words>312</words>
It was time for a spoken truth, the only currency that might have value in this place. <words>328</words>
"Because the sky hates me," I confessed, the words tasting like ash. <words>339</words>
"Every prediction I make is wrong, every storm I chase avoids me, every cosmic event I yearn to see is obscured by clouds." <words>364</words>
I raised the sextant, not to fight, but to show him. <words>376</words>
"I came down here to find stars that wouldn't run away." <words>388</words>
Xylos froze, his reptilian gaze softening for a fraction of a second. <words>400</words>
He lowered his hand, the systematic chaos of the fight resolving into a sudden, sharp stillness. <words>416</words>
"The star-hunger," he murmured, a term of understanding, perhaps even pity. <words>428</words>
"The ancestors pulse for all who are lost." <words>438</words>
"You may study them," he finally declared, "but I will watch you." <words>451</words>
It was not friendship, nor was it forgiveness, but a fragile truce born from a moment of shared, cosmic loneliness. <words>471</words>
