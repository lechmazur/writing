The sorrowful apothecary, Kaelen, worked with desperate haste in the Grand Library of the exiled fortress, a stone behemoth floating silently above the scorched, shimmering deserts. <words>26</words>
The final minute before the great doors sealed forever was ticking away, his last chance to tempt the Oracle—his mother—to speak again. <words>49</words>
For months he had labored, his sole method of rediscovering their lost arts being the painstaking process of decoding the intricate dream catchers she had left behind. <words>78</words>
Each woven thread and dangling feather was a syllable in a forgotten language, a component in a family recipe he now understood. <words>101</words>
His hands, though skilled, were roughly refined in their movements, scarred from a thousand failed attempts to recreate the past. <words>124</words>
He ground shimmering dust from a geode with a mortar and pestle, the rhythmic crunch a painful echo of his mother’s own work. <words>149</words>
From a velvet pouch, he withdrew the final, most crucial catalyst: a cheap, white plastic spoon. <words>166</words>
A wave of painful joy washed over him as he remembered her using it to stir honey into her tea, a mundane treasure from a world long lost to them. <words>199</words>
This spoon was the heart of the recipe, the anchor for a memory potent enough to pierce the veil of her silence. <words>224</words>
The decoded patterns of the final dream catcher had revealed the most challenging step, a directive he barely comprehended. <words>246</words>
He had to bifurcate the very essence of the incense he was creating, splitting the aroma into two distinct yet harmonious streams of scent. <words>275</words>
One stream would carry the sharp grief of their exile, the other the sweet warmth of their shared memories before the fall. <words>301</words>
With a trembling hand, he used the plastic spoon to divide the glowing powder on a silver tray, drawing a line that separated sorrow from solace. <words>331</words>
He carefully funneled each half into a twin-chambered censer, the roughly refined vessel humming with latent power. <words>352</words>
The colossal library doors began to groan, their slow, final closure shaking the very stone beneath his feet. <words>373</words>
Ignoring the grinding stone, Kaelen lit the censer and approached the silent, enthroned figure at the library’s heart. <words>396</words>
Two plumes of smoke rose, twisting together as they drifted towards the Oracle, one smelling of desert dust and tears, the other of honeyed tea and home. <words>429</words>
He held his breath, the offering complete, watching her still face for any flicker of recognition, any sign that his painful joy had finally reached her across the void. <words>464</words>
In the encroaching darkness, as the last sliver of light vanished, he thought he saw her lips part, a silent promise in the final, fragrant moment. <words>496</words>
