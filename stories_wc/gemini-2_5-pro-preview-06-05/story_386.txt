Kaelen, a time refugee from an empire the chronologs had erased, tended the great lamp of the atom-powered lighthouse. <words>19</words>
He existed in the hush of a line that never moves, a pocket of stillness where the only light was a borrowed dawn from the humming reactor core. <words>43</words>
His singular purpose was to bind old wounds with unstoppable will, to stitch the memory of his people back into the fabric of reality. <words>66</words>
On the central table, an embroidered tablecloth lay spread not for meals, but as a map, its silken threads a quietly defiant testament against oblivion. <words>92</words>
Each constellation stitched into the deep blue linen represented a lost world, each knot a forgotten name he refused to let die. <words>115</words>
The few maintenance drones that serviced the lighthouse designated him as 'trustworthy strange', an anomaly who polished brass and recalibrated temporal sensors with equal, unnerving care. <words>148</words>
For cycles, he had been secretly re-engineering the lighthouse's emergency mass-ejector into a crude but functional catapult. <words>169</words>
Its launch sequence was not tied to a button or lever, but keyed to a celestial trigger he had calculated over centuries: by the alignment of the stars as they had once shone over his capital city. <words>211</words>
Tonight was the night. <words>215</words>
The control room was bathed in the soft glow of stellar charts projected onto the curved walls, the predicted alignment a perfect match to the pattern on the cloth. <words>246</words>
With reverent hands, Kaelen folded the embroidered tablecloth into a dense, weighted package, the history of a billion souls tucked into its creases. <words>272</words>
He placed the bundle into the catapult's cradle, a small offering against the infinite void. <words>288</words>
The atom-powered heart of the lighthouse thrummed, diverting a surge of energy as the final star slid into place. <words>309</words>
A low groan of tortured metal echoed through the tower, and with a silent, furious burst of kinetic force, the catapult launched its precious cargo into the timestream. <words>340</words>
Kaelen watched the small projectile vanish, a single tear tracing a path through the grime on his cheek. <words>358</words>
He had not launched a weapon, but a story. <words>366</words>
It was a seed of memory, a defiant whisper sent across the ages, hoping to find fertile ground in a past he could never reclaim for himself. <words>394</words>
The reactor's light seemed a little warmer now, less borrowed and more earned, as he turned back to his solitary watch, a patient guardian of the echo he had just created. <words>430</words>
