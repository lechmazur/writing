<story>
Elias, the world's most disgruntled wishing-well attendant, sat on the cold stone lip, a study in practiced stillness. <words>17</words>
The position was an inherited mystery, a legacy from a father he barely knew, passed down like a tarnished medal. <words>36</words>
Tourists rarely found this forgotten courtyard, part of a network so secret it was known only as an escape route. <words>56</words>
His true job was not to scoop out pennies but to guard this quiet threshold, a task that chafed against the man he used to be. <words>81</words>
The weight of scars, a faint lattice on his forearms and a deeper network across his soul, made the long hours of waiting a unique form of torment. <words>111</words>
He was motivated by a singular, desperate need: to out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts, the comrades and enemies who haunted his quiet moments. <words>139</words>
A soft clink echoed from the water below, a sound distinct from the dull plunk of local currency. <words>157</words>
He leaned over, his expression unchanged, but his body became intensely relaxed, every muscle poised for action. <words>176</words>
There, shimmering at the bottom, was a silver peso, the prearranged signal. <words>188</words>
It joined his silent collection of foreign coins, each one a story of passage, a whisper of danger averted. <words>209</words>
Now he had to corroborate the agent's status. <words>218</words>
His instructions were clear, tied to the celestial clockwork governing this place. <words>231</words>
He had to wait for the crossing of two unwritten paths, that fleeting moment when the afternoon sun bisected the moon's faint daytime presence. <words>258</words>
His method was esoteric, a relic of forgotten spycraft. <words>268</words>
He would confirm the signal by following shadow patterns as they crept across the courtyard's ancient flagstones. <words>286</words>
The gnomon of the well's iron winch began to cast its long, sharp finger toward a series of almost invisible etchings by the far wall. <words>314</words>
Elias tracked its movement, his breath held steady, his mind a silent battlefield against the ghosts who screamed that he would fail again. <words>341</words>
The shadow touched the first mark, a serpent. <words>348</words>
It slid past a second, a broken key. <words>356</words>
Finally, it aligned perfectly with the third and final sigilâ€”a bird in flight, the sign for 'route clear'. <words>377</words>
The corroboration was complete. <words>381</words>
With a sigh that sounded like boredom, he picked up a small, smooth stone from a pile near his feet. <words>402</words>
He tossed it into a patch of overgrown ivy on the far wall, producing a soft rustle that was inaudible to any but the intended recipient. <words>430</words>
The signal was sent. <words>434</words>
He settled back onto the well's edge, the disgruntled attendant once more, his vigil reset. <words>449</words>
The peso below was another ghost laid to rest, but the weight of his own scars remained, a constant, heavy price for survival. <words>474</words>
