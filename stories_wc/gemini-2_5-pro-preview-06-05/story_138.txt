Lord Alistair, a title now as empty as the cavernous spontaneous combustion lab he occupied, ignored the buzz of his phone. <words>20</words>
His focus was on the delicate task at hand, a desperate attempt to fortify his small corner of this volatile world. <words>40</words>
He worked through the reassembly of old ticket stubs, their faded ink a testament to forgotten cinemas and cross-country train rides. <words>62</words>
Each flimsy rectangle was a small, honest truth he was using to build a wall against a lifetime of grand, beautiful lies. <words>86</words>
Above him, an artificial hummingbird drone, a relic of his former wealth, hovered with a silent, metallic whir, its optical sensors scanning for the tell-tale heat signatures of imminent disaster. <words>121</words>
The lab itself was a monument to hollow recklessness, filled with beakers of self-igniting solvents and pressure-sensitive compounds. <words>142</words>
The danger was mysteriously obvious; you could feel the instability in the air, a tension that promised fire, yet its source remained stubbornly hidden. <words>171</words>
His phone buzzed again, a persistent ghost from the life he was trying to incinerate. <words>186</words>
He glanced at the screen between placing a ticket for a forgotten punk show and one for a matinee of a film he could not remember. <words>215</words>
The text read: "Everyone misses the man you were." <words>224</words>
A bitter laugh escaped his lips, a dry, cracking sound in the sterile quiet. <words>237</words>
That man was an illusion, a carefully constructed phantom of nobility. <words>248</words>
His motivation was simple: to cut through illusions, even if it meant burning everything down. <words>264</words>
He picked up his phone, his thumbs moving with a speed born of finality. <words>278</words>
This was the ultimate act of candor in small moments, a digital confession sent between the heartbeats of a dying laboratory. <words>301</words>
"Good," he typed, "He was a liar." <words>308</words>
He pressed send just as the hummingbird drone emitted a sharp, high-pitched alarm and darted back towards him. <words>327</words>
Across the room, a flask of diethylzinc, exposed to a stray molecule of air from a faulty vent, began to glow with an ethereal green light. <words>354</words>
Alistair calmly placed the final ticket stub—a ferry ride to an island he had visited alone—completing his fragile paper barricade. <words>377</words>
The flask erupted not with a bang, but with a silent, all-consuming plume of white fire that devoured the lab bench and licked at the ceiling. <words>405</words>
The wave of heat washed over his fortified corner, but the strange little wall of memories, of small, insignificant truths, held. <words>427</words>
He looked at his phone, the message delivered, the connection severed. <words>438</words>
The illusion was gone, and in the flickering, destructive light, Alistair felt nothing but the clean, sharp, and terrifying emptiness of the truth. <words>462</words>
