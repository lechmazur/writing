Kaelen pressed his forehead to the cool plasteel floor of the biodome, stretching his hamstring as the synthetic sun began its morning cycle. <22>
He was a ghost here among the genetically perfected wheat, a fugitive lawyer hiding in the last place anyone would look for a man who once commanded courtrooms. <46>
His patience was a taut wire, an impatient stillness born from months of waiting for the other shoe to drop. <64>
It dropped this morning, tucked under the hydroponic nutrient pump: a small, leftover gift tag. <78>
The familiar, spiky handwriting of his old rival, Marcus Thorne, was scrawled on the back. <93>
"Dare you to make the sky cry at noon," it read. <103>
A cold dread, sharp and familiar, coiled in his gut; Marcus was now a lead investigator for the very corporation that had framed him. <127>
This wasn't a game; it was a signal, a cryptic test to see if he was still the trickster they remembered from their youth. <150>
He had to divert their attention, which was undoubtedly closing in on this remote agricultural sphere. <166>
All his chosen paths had led him to this moment, a life of manipulating legal code now reduced to decoding taunts from his past. <189>
He rose from his stretch, a plan already forming, his mind a flurry of system overrides and atmospheric controls. <208>
He felt the ghostly resolve settle over him, the same quiet determination that drove him to spend his nights here whispering dying words into his datalogger. <235>
To catalogue the disappearing languages of Old Earth was his penance and his purpose, a way to preserve something pure in a world that had corrupted his own tongue. <266>
He moved to a maintenance terminal, his fingers flying across the holographic interface. <279>
He couldn't make it rain, not literally, but he could trigger the biodome's emergency pollen-scrubbing protocols. <296>
A fine, shimmering mist, indistinguishable from rain on external sensors, would fill the upper atmosphere of the dome. <315>
It was a clever misdirection, a lawyer's argument made with weather systems instead of words. <329>
At precisely noon, as he watched from a ventilation shaft, the dome's sky began to weep a golden vapor. <347>
On the perimeter monitors, he saw the approaching enforcement skimmers pause, their search patterns momentarily confused by the false atmospheric data. <369>
He had diverted them, for now. <375>
He pulled out his datalogger and spoke a single, nearly extinct Ainu word for "clever deception." <392>
Each recorded syllable was a small victory, a defiant breath against the silence they wanted for him. <409>
This was the path he had chosen, a life lived between the lines of cryptic dares and forgotten dialects. <427>
He was impatiently patient, waiting for the next tag, the next word, the next chance to survive. <443>
