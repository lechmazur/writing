Finn, who once slopped ale for a living, now tended the silent, crystalline flora of the vacuum chamber garden. <words>18</words>
It was a profoundly stupid job for a profoundly stupid universe, especially since the sands of time had decided to start flowing backward last week. <words>40</words>
An inescapable calling, the universe's equivalent of a cosmic wedgie, had dragged him here against his better judgment. <words>57</words>
His only company was a small pouch of broken seashells, fragments of a world with tides he could barely remember. <words>78</words>
They were his reason, a pathetic one maybe, but a reason nonetheless: to catapult imagination beyond known realms, or at least beyond this sterile dome. <words>105</words>
The garden's central feature was a dried-up riverbed, its clay floor tattooed with the fossilized footprints of some long-dead, six-legged beast. <words>130</words>
This was the control panel, the great universal reset button, and he was the schmuck who had to press it. <words>149</words>
His task, as dictated by the humming in his bones, was to randomize the sequence of what-comes-next. <words>169</words>
He had to do it through the fossilized footprints in a dried-up riverbed, because the cosmos apparently had a flair for the dramatic. <words>192</words>
The results were always predictably unpredictable; you knew the cocktail would be shaken, you just never knew what liquor would end up in it. <words>219</words>
Last time, gravity had developed a sarcastic sense of humor for three days, making it a real chore to pour a drink. <words>240</words>
The time before that, the color blue had tasted faintly of regret, which had ruined blueberries for him forever. <words>261</words>
He sighed, the sound swallowed by the perfect, oppressive silence of the vacuum. <words>274</words>
He emptied the shattered spirals of the seashells onto the ground before the first footprint. <words>289</words>
They formed a mosaic of fracture and failure, an echo of an ocean that no longer was. <words>306</words>
Maybe this time, he thought with a grimace that was half-prayer and half-smirk, the randomization would finally get it right. <words>328</words>
Maybe it would create a world where a tavern-hand could just be a tavern-hand, and not some janitor for spacetime. <words>348</words>
Or maybe it would give squirrels the ability to teleport, and they'd all just steal nuts from the past. <words>368</words>
It didn't really matter in the grand, ridiculous scheme of things. <words>379</words>
The calling was a hook in his soul, and he was tired of wiggling. <words>393</words>
He took a deep breath from his rebreather, the recycled air tasting of ozone and resignation. <words>408</words>
With the flippant solemnity of a man about to tell a joke at a funeral, he placed his boot into the first ancient depression. <words>432</words>
The world shimmered as time stuttered, and the broken shells at his feet began to reassemble themselves into something new and horribly beautiful. <words>456</words>
Finn closed his eyes, waiting for the universe to tell him the punchline. <words>469</words>
