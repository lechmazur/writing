<story>
The weatherbeaten knight, a relic of rust and bone, stared past his own face into the storm-slicked lantern glass of his lighthouse prison. <words>22</words>
Within the mirrored reflection, the stone walls dissolved, replaced by the ghost of a room he had forsaken decades ago. <words>40</words>
His motivation was simple, a desperate need to hush the final cry of regret that echoed louder than the waves on the jagged reef below. <words>66</words>
There on the reflected floor lay a set of seemingly random items: a splinter from his first lance, a pressed sea-rose, and a child’s wooden toy soldier. <words>93</words>
Each was a monument to an impossible choice, a crossroads where duty had cleaved his life from his heart. <words>112</words>
His gaze settled on the final object, a heavy brass door knocker shaped like a lion’s head, torn from a door he had never again been permitted to open. <words>143</words>
He had chosen the sword over the hearth, the crown over the woman who held that knocker, and the regret was a cancer in his soul. <words>170</words>
But as the phantom light swirled, he saw it—the items were not scattered but arranged, their placement forming a pattern. <words>193</words>
It was the star-sign they were both born under, a secret map of their shared sky drawn in the artifacts of his sorrow. <words>218</words>
A terrible, beautiful understanding bloomed in his chest, a feeling of joyful agony that threatened to tear him apart and make him whole. <words>244</words>
He saw that the path of sacrifice had not erased their love but had instead preserved it in these sacred, painful relics. <words>267</words>
His calloused, trembling finger reached out, not to the cold glass of the lighthouse, but to the warm brass of the knocker in the world behind it. <words>298</words>
The contact sent a shock through him, not of pain, but of a grudgingly sweet acceptance that settled deep in his marrow. <words>323</words>
He did not erase the sorrow; he could finally appreciate it as the price he had paid for a love so profound it could etch itself into the firmament of his memory. <words>358</words>
He saw the life he had lived, not as a failure, but as a long, arduous pilgrimage back to this single, perfect moment of understanding. <words>386</words>
The reflection wavered, the room of memory receding back into the image of his own tired, ancient face. <words>406</words>
The cry of regret was gone, replaced by a quiet hum that was both the echo of her laughter and the whisper of his peace. <words>433</words>
He closed his eyes, the knight in his lonely tower, finally home. <words>445</words>
