The deflated oracle slumped against the peeling paint of the abandoned carnival ring toss game, a ghost in his own subconscious. <words>20</words>
He was a paradox of a man, independently dependent, a king of this forgotten mindscape who could not exist without the memory of what he’d lost. <words>45</words>
Faded, dreamlike invitations promising a second chance had swirled around him like phantom confetti, luring him to this place of rigged chances and forgotten prizes. <words>74</words>
His fingers, thin as spider legs, traced the contours of the empty perfume bottle he clutched to his chest. <words>94</words>
Its scent was long gone, but the memory of her laughter it once held was the engine for his singular, desperate motivation: to rewrite history. <words>122</words>
A smile, full of melancholic glee, stretched his lips as he finally resolved to enact the impossible. <words>140</words>
Wound around the splintered wooden pegs of the game was a centuries-old ceremonial rope, its fibers humming with the energy of causality. <words>164</words>
Each of its thick braids represented a stream of time, and he knew the method to change their weave. <words>183</words>
He began by reconfiguring the braids of a centuries-old ceremonial rope, carefully unspooling its length from the dusty pegs that had once held cheap plastic rings. <words>212</words>
One thread, the color of a summer sky, represented the day his prophecy had mistakenly sent her away. <words>231</words>
With a sob that was half a laugh, he meticulously unwove that sky-blue thread, watching it dissolve into the dusty, stagnant air. <words>255</words>
He then took a shimmering, golden thread from the braid of what-could-have-been—a future where he had remained silent—and began to weave it back into the primary strand of reality. <words>290</words>
The air grew thick, and the distant, tinny music of the carnival stuttered before restarting with a happier, unfamiliar tune. <words>312</words>
The plastic rings on the counter rattled, no longer cheap trinkets but now glowing with a soft, promising light. <words>332</words>
He was utterly alone, a solitary figure remaking the world from the inside out, yet his every action was tethered to her, a perfect portrait of being independently dependent. <words>366</words>
As he tied the final, intricate knot, the empty perfume bottle in his pocket grew warm, and for a fleeting, impossible moment, he could smell roses again. <words>396</words>
The glee on his face was radiant, a terrible and beautiful light in the gloom, but it was edged with the deep, aching sorrow of knowing the price. <words>427</words>
He had his history back, a timeline where she was safe and happy, but the man who had unwritten the old one could never truly be part of it. <words>458</words>
He was now just the silent, deflated guardian of a perfect memory that had never happened to him. <words>477</words>
