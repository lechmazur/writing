Silas, a farmer whose moods mirrored his barren soil, descended into the drowned quarry. <13>
This was his private cathedral: a forgotten power station submerged when the river was dammed decades ago. <28>
He carried the only two things that weren't coated in the dust of his dead-end life. <43>
One was his great-grandmother's quilt, a history of their family told through mismatched patches of calico and silk. <61>
The other was his collection of used postage stamps, tiny paper ghosts from places he would never see. <79>
Down in the silent, green-lit control room, among the hulking, dead turbines, he felt the familiar weight of his own objectively biased truth: that escape was a fantasy for other men. <115>
His despair was a fact, as solid and unmovable as the silt-covered machinery around him. <131>
He spread the quilt over a wide, rusted console, its vibrant, chaotic colors a rebellion in the monochrome gloom. <150>
This was his ritual of hopelessness, arranging the stamps on the fabric squares. <163>
A stamp from Zanzibar on a patch from his grandfather's wedding shirt; a faded monarch from British India on a piece of a gingham dress. <188>
He was trying to connect the unconnected, to force a story where there was none. <202>
But today, in a sudden moment of pure inspiration, the water-warped light struck a stamp from Argentina, making its depiction of a soaring condor gleam. <229>
It rested on a patch of deep blue velvet, and for a breathtaking second, the bird wasn't on a stamp, but flying over a midnight sea. <255>
The boundary between the tiny paper square and the fabric world beneath it vanished. <268>
Then another boundary dissolved: the one between the quilt and the world outside it. <282>
He saw it then, not as a collection of scraps, but as a map. <296>
Each patch was a step, each stamp a destination, and the threads between them were the paths he could forge himself. <318>
The lines between his stagnant farm and a life of motion, between Silas the sullen farmer and Silas the traveler, were erased. <340>
A jolt, pure and electric as the station's ghost current, shot through him. <352>
It was zest, a feeling so alien he almost laughed. <362>
This courage wasn't his own; it was a borrowed valor, stitched together from the resilience of his ancestors and the journeys of a thousand strangers' letters. <389>
He carefully folded the quilt, the stamps now seeming like jewels sewn into its fabric. <404>
He would sell the farm, a decision that felt less like a loss and more like shedding a heavy, waterlogged coat. <424>
Leaving the power station for the last time, he didn't look back at the dark water. <439>
His eyes were fixed on the horizon, a boundary he was finally ready to cross. <453>
