The space pirate navigation room hummed with a sacred disorder, a chaotic symphony of flickering star-charts and discarded nutrient paste tubes. <21> Kael watched his opponent, Captain Vorlag, across the makeshift table, the air thick with whispered secrets and engine grease. <39> Between them lay the prize: a tattered fragment of a medieval tapestry, its faded threads depicting coiled, fire-breathing dragons. <58> Kael’s motivation was not the pirate’s rumored treasure map, but the preservation of forgotten farming methods. <75> His family had a tradition of planting a tree for each new member, a grounding ritual he intended to bring to the sterile colonies. <99> The tapestry, he knew, held the key, its border stitched with glyphs from a lost language that described the cultivation of near-extinct Terran grains. <127> Vorlag sneered, his greed a palpable force in the cramped, zero-g chamber. <141> "Last roll, gambler," Vorlag rasped, tapping a clawed finger on the table. <153> Kael nodded, his expression one of philosophical practicality; one must play the game the universe presents. <171> He scooped up the heavy, iron-cast dice, their pips worn smooth by centuries of use. <186> As they left his hand, he didn't just let them fall, he guided them with a flicker of telekinetic will, a secret he guarded more closely than his life. <216> The dice tumbled, spinning impossibly before settling on a perfect seven, a winning throw. <231> Vorlag’s eyes widened in disbelief, then narrowed in rage as he reached for a plasma pistol. <247> "No tricks," Kael said calmly, his voice cutting through the tension. <257> Before the pirate could fire, Kael snatched a flickering hydro-wick lighter from the console. <272> He brought the small, steady flame close to the ancient tapestry fragment. <284> Vorlag froze, his greed warring with the fear of seeing his prize destroyed. <298> "This isn't a map to gold," Kael explained, the flame dancing just shy of the delicate threads. <315> "It's a map to survival." <321> The heat from the flame caused faint, silvery lines to appear between the woven glyphs, a hidden layer of text shimmering into view. <344> "A dead language that teaches how to grow food in poisoned soil, how to make barren worlds green." <363> The sacred disorder of the room seemed to hold its breath, the hum of the ship the only sound. <380> Kael’s gamble was never about the dice; it was about revealing a greater value than plunder. <396> The pirate captain slowly lowered his weapon, his gaze fixed on the glowing script, a new kind of treasure dawning in his mind. <419> Kael carefully retrieved the tapestry, the warmth of the fabric a promise against the cold of space. <436> He would find a new world, and for the first time in generations, his family would plant a tree whose seeds held the wisdom of dragons and the hope of a harvest. <467>
