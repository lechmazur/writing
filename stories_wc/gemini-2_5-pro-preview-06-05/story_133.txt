Alistair, a locksmith whose hands knew the secrets of a thousand locks but whose heart had long since rusted shut, found the pottery class an absurdly gentle form of espionage. <words>29</words>
He was here, amidst the scent of wet clay and blooming citrus from the labyrinth orchard that sprawled across the colonial town’s rooftops, for a single purpose. <words>56</words>
She sat opposite him, her focus on the vase she was painting with delicate, deliberate strokes. <words>73</words>
Her name was Lyra, and her smile was a delightfully menacing curve that promised both ruin and revelation. <words>91</words>
On her hands, she wore a pair of fine leather gloves, the cuffs intricately detailed with the embroidered sigil of the lost royal house: a silver hawk clutching a skeleton key. <words>126</words>
“The glazes here are rather dull,” she murmured, not looking up from her work, her voice a perfect example of demure audacity. <words>148</words>
“They lack the permanence of the old ways.” <words>157</words>
Alistair grunted, applying a stripe of blue to his own clumsy pot. <words>171</words>
“Permanence is an illusion sold to kings.” <words>179</words>
Lyra finally met his gaze, her eyes dark and knowing. <words>189</words>
“And with the throne left unclaimed, the illusions are all that remain to protect the kingdom’s treasures.” <words>207</words>
The casual mention of the city’s most dangerous secret hung in the air between them. <words>223</words>
Alistair’s own interest was not in the crown, but in the traditions it upheld. <words>239</words>
For generations, his family had not just picked locks but served as the monarchy’s ‘Hunters,’ guardians of secrets and masters of silent infiltration. <words>266</words>
His sole motivation was to preserve those unique hunting methods, a craft now dying in the power vacuum. <words>286</words>
“The old locks on the regent’s vault were designed to be unpicked only by a royal hand or a Hunter’s tool,” Lyra stated, her voice dropping to a whisper that seemed to permeate the very air. <words>326</words>
“But the mechanisms decay, and the knowledge with them.” <words>336</words>
She slowly began to peel off one embroidered glove, the movement both an invitation and a command. <words>353</words>
“I wish to restore what was lost, not just the crown, but the skills that protected it.” <words>371</words>
Her proposition was clear, a direct appeal to the one thing that could stir his jaded soul. <words>388</words>
He looked from her bare, steady hand to the hawk on her glove, a symbol of the hunt he thought was extinct. <words>411</words>
A flicker of the old fire, the thrill of a worthy challenge, began to displace the rust in his heart. <words>431</words>
“The glaze isn’t the problem,” Alistair said, his voice low and steady for the first time that afternoon. <words>449</words>
“It’s the quality of the clay you start with.” <words>459</words>
