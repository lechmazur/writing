Kael, who had known only the sun-scorched horizons of a dead world, now kept watch from the crow’s nest of a corsair ship sailing the void. <words>24</words>
His self-appointed duty was not to spot asteroids or rival vessels, but to conduct his research. <words>38</words>
He was here to archive the universe’s most sacred and ephemeral knowledge. <words>49</words>
His primary tool was a heavy brass ruler, its edges worn smooth by the hands of his ancestors who had measured water rights and shadow lengths. <words>75</words>
Now, Kael used it to investigate everyday miracles. <words>83</words>
Below him on the main deck, the ship’s hulking quartermaster, a being of silicon and rage, gently adjusted the nutrient tube for a much smaller organic crewmate who had fallen ill. <words>117</words>
This was his field of study: translated love, the raw compassion of one species expressed through the alien grammar of another. <words>139</words>
A chime echoed through the rigging, a soft, melancholic note signaling the imminent deadline for his current observation. <words>159</words>
On a small, circular screen beside him, the ship’s life-support system displayed its core process as a tranquil grove of apple trees, a simulation that was authentically artificial in its every detail. <words>196</words>
For a year, the system had produced a single fruit each day to represent its stable function, and now the orchard’s last apple finally falls. <words>224</words>
This finality gave his work a loaded curiosity, a need to understand before the cycle reset. <words>241</words>
He raised the brass ruler, not to the screen, but toward the two pirates below, framing them in the cold metal. <words>263</words>
He wasn't measuring distance, but devotion. <words>269</words>
He measured the precise, gentle angle of the quartermaster’s massive forearm, the slight, trusting tilt of the smaller creature’s head, the unspoken covenant that passed between them. <words>301</words>
These were the metrics of a miracle, the data points of grace in a lawless corner of space. <words>321</words>
He was a desert wanderer charting an oasis of the soul. <words>332</words>
The apple on the screen trembled, its pixels shimmering, and then it dropped from its branch, dissolving into light before it could hit the digital grass. <words>361</words>
The cycle was complete. <words>365</words>
Kael lowered the ruler and etched a complex series of lines and symbols onto a metallic sheet, archiving the geometry of kindness he had just witnessed. <words>396</words>
He had captured another fragment of the language that held the cosmos together, a translation that was more true than the original. <words>421</words>
With his task done for the moment, he leaned against the mast, the brass ruler cool in his hand, and turned his gaze back to the endless, unmeasured stars. <words>452</words>
