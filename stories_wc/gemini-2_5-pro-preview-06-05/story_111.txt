The copper cauldron bubbled over a smokeless flame, its steam mingling with the scent of damp earth and forgotten dog toys. <words>20</words>
I, the city's last and long-deserted alchemist, watched from the edge of the murky pond that served as the park's centerpiece. <words>41</words>
This secret dog park, hidden deep beneath the granite plaza, was the only place left with the right kind of silence. <words>61</words>
My work was a delicate thing, an attempt to wrestle a dream from the clutches of oblivion. <words>79</words>
It was a dream of her laughter, a sound now so faded it felt more like a rumor. <words>97</words>
The brew was almost ready, a shimmering concoction of memory-dredging herbs and liquid moonlight. <words>112</words>
My faith in the old ways had been shattered when my master left, but this new process was my own invention, theoretically intuitive and terrifyingly unproven. <words>143</words>
Was this an act of devotion or the final, desperate ritual of a fool? <words>157</words>
The question hung in the air, as thick as the alchemical vapors. <words>169</words>
I ignored it, picking up the smooth, grey stone I had chosen hours ago. <words>183</words>
My motivation was not to prove a theory, but to hear that laugh one more time. <words>200</words>
With a flick of my wrist, I sent the stone skipping across the pond's still surface. <words>215</words>
The rings spread outwards, perfect concentric circles of shivering light and shadow. <words>228</words>
This was my codex, the language of ripples. <words>237</words>
My mind, trained in the rigid logic of transmutation, now raced to interpret the intuitive geometry of the water's dance. <words>260</words>
There, in the fifth ripple's interference pattern, I saw it: the cadence, the shape of the sound I was chasing. <words>281</words>
A sob of exultant grief caught in my throat. <words>290</words>
I snatched the spool from my satchel, its golden typewriter ribbon gleaming like a captured sunbeam. <words>307</words>
This was no ordinary metal; it was spun from hope and regret, designed to record the intangible. <words>325</words>
Plunging the ribbon's tip into the heart of the bubbling cauldron, I watched it drink the shimmering liquid. <words>344</words>
The gold pulsed, absorbing the essence I had summoned from the water's patterns. <words>358</words>
I lifted the ribbon, its weight now heavier with the ghost of a memory. <words>373</words>
I could almost feel the vibration of her laugh against my fingertips, a phantom echo both wonderful and agonizing. <words>393</words>
For a single, breathtaking moment, I allowed myself to savor the victory. <words>405</words>
The dream was no longer lost to oblivion, but tattooed in shimmering gold upon a ribbon of sorrow. <words>423</words>
My faith was not restored, but it had been answered, and in the lonely silence of the hidden park, that was enough. <words>446</words>
