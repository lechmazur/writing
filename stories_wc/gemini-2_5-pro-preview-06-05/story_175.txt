The aged minstrel, Lyren, stood where the path of glowing toadstools forked, a place the elders called the Sundering. <words>19</words>
He held an empty birdcage of twisted silver wire, its door swinging gently in the spore-laced air. <words>35</words>
This was the intersection where an old tradition, the Rite of Quietude, would die tonight, and Lyren was its sole, smiling executioner. <words>56</words>
A young woman, her face painted with the sacred spirals of the Rite, approached him with a frown. <words>73</words>
"Why do you mock the silence, old one?" she asked, her voice a reverent whisper. <words>86</words>
Lyrenâ€™s eyes, bright with an innocently mischievous glint, turned not to her but to the vintage signpost between the paths. <words>107</words>
"I do not mock it, child; I simply wish to explain its true nature," he said, his tone one of feral elegance, like a wolf crooning a lullaby. <words>136</words>
He gestured with the cage toward the sign, a slab of petrified wood that read 'Listen to the Hum'. <words>156</words>
"My quest for forbidden knowledge began here," he confessed, "with this very sign." <words>169</words>
He began to compare the chipped paint on the vintage sign each night, a ritual he had maintained for a year. <words>189</words>
"You see this fleck of blue?" he tapped a spot where the top layer had peeled away. <words>205</words>
"This was the story of the Great Spore granting us peace, a lovely tale painted over the original red." <words>225</words>
He traced a deeper gouge, revealing a raw, dark wood beneath the layers of color. <words>240</words>
"The red was the story of the Spore demanding a sacrifice for that peace, a truth they decided was too ugly." <words>262</words>
"And beneath it all," he whispered, his voice dropping, "is the wood itself, the forbidden knowledge I finally acquired." <words>282</words>
"There is no gift, no pact, only a sentient fungus that feeds on our silence, on the songs we are forbidden to sing." <words>306</words>
The crumbling illusions fell from the young woman's face, her painted spirals suddenly looking like prison bars. <words>324</words>
Lyren lifted the empty birdcage. <words>330</words>
"The tradition was meant to keep the truth caged, just as this once held a nightingale trained to sing only one, pacifying note." <words>356</words>
"But the cage is weak, the paint is chipping, and the real songs want to be free." <words>374</words>
He set the cage down, its door wide open at the center of the mushroom village crossroads. <words>392</words>
The girl stared at the sign, then at the cage, and for the first time in her life, she felt the feral urge to scream a new song into existence. <words>423</words>
Lyren simply smiled, a kind and terrible sight in the fungal glow, having finally explained the beautiful, awful truth. <words>443</words>
