Kaelen, a pathfinder of the most daring sort, balanced on the skeletal spine of the abandoned roller coaster track. <words>17</words>
The wind whispered through rusted iron, a sound that did little to soothe the quiet mania humming in his blood. <words>34</words>
He was here to answer a riddle older than time, a question whispered in the static between worlds. <words>51</words>
His method was, by any sane measure, absurd. <words>59</words>
For years, he had journeyed not to libraries or temples, but to haunted inns, driven by a purpose he barely understood himself. <words>81</words>
There, he would bribe or charm his way into their archives, his singular focus on their bizarre housekeeping logs. <words>101</words>
He was ingeniously clueless, seeing cosmic patterns where others saw only notes on spectral drafts and mysteriously rearranged furniture. <words>122</words>
Amid page turns, a map had formed, stitched together from a hundred different spidery scripts. <words>138</words>
One log from a New England guesthouse spoke of a chambermaid who polished an antique doorknob until it simply wasn't there anymore. <words>163</words>
Another, from a Louisiana hotel, detailed a recurring complaint about a phantom door appearing at the end of a third-floor hallway. <words>187</words>
These fragmented reports, these mundane accounts of the impossible, were the breadcrumbs that had led him to this high, lonely place. <words>211</words>
The final log, from a motel overlooking this very amusement park, had been the key: "Guest in 2B reports seeing a door at the top of the Devil's Drop." <words>244</words>
And there it was, just ahead, where the track peaked before its terrifying plunge. <words>259</words>
A solitary, weathered doorframe stood impossibly on the narrow walkway, its existence a defiance of physics and reason. <words>279</words>
Time and the salt-laced air had begun to erode its edges, but the empty hole where a knob should be was perfectly preserved. <words>304</words>
Kaelenâ€™s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drum against the silence. <words>316</words>
From his worn leather satchel, he withdrew the object from the New England inn, the source of his long quest. <words>338</words>
It was an antique doorknob of tarnished brass, cool and heavy in his palm. <words>353</words>
This was it, the last fragment. <words>359</words>
He stepped forward, his movements unnaturally steady, and fitted the knob into the waiting void. <words>376</words>
It clicked into place with the sound of a closing book. <words>387</words>
The riddle, he suddenly understood, was not a question to be solved but a barrier to be crossed. <words>406</words>
The quiet mania receded, replaced by a vast and unnerving calm. <words>418</words>
He took a breath, the air tasting of rust and ozone, and turned the knob. <words>433</words>
