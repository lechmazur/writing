Julian, a tragedian by trade and temperament, moved with a practiced calm through the clamor of the Great Carapace sidewalk sales. <words>21</words>
The entire city of Aethelburg, perched on the shells of gargantuan turtles, vibrated with a frantic energy he refused to absorb. <words>42</words>
His mission, a sacred quest rehearsed for months, was to repossess the one object that could shift the cosmic stage. <words>62</words>
He sought a cracked leather case, stolen by a pawn of the Watcher, an omnipotent foe whose direct meddling was oddly seldom. <words>84</words>
The path to it was not force, but intellect: a scavenger hunt via matching riddles hidden in flickering pre-Collapse commercials. <words>107</words>
He saw a vendor struggling with fallen shell-bowls and paused, his heart a silent metronome marking the scene’s beats. <words>128</words>
With a flourish of feigned concern, he helped the man, a small act of performed kindness to grant him access to the antique vid-screen inside the stall. <words>157</words>
The grateful vendor offered him spiced brine, allowing Julian the perfect vantage. <words>170</words>
An ad for 'Sun-Beetle Polish' flickered on, its announcer posing the riddle: 'I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish; what am I?' <words>204</words>
A map. <words>206</words>
Julian’s eyes darted to a neighboring stall selling ancient charts of the Great Sea Below. <words>221</words>
His tranquility was a thin veneer over a core of pure panic. <words>233</words>
Another commercial began on a screen across the way for 'Carapace Caulking'. <words>246</words>
The second riddle emerged: 'What has a thumb and four fingers but is not alive?' <words>261</words>
A glove. <words>263</words>
His gaze snapped to a longshoreman haggling over work gloves, and tucked under the man’s arm was the prize. <words>284</words>
The cracked leather case. <words>288</words>
The stage was set for a final performance. <words>296</words>
Julian approached, adopting the persona of a frantic courier who had lost an identical case. <words>313</words>
“My deepest apologies,” he began, his voice a symphony of desperation, “but you have my portfolio—my entire career is in there!” <words>336</words>
He presented his own decoy, a cheap imitation, and pointed to an invisible scuff mark. <words>352</words>
“This mark from the Gilded Wharf incident?” he improvised, his mind racing faster than the city’s pulse. <words>370</words>
The longshoreman, bewildered by the actor’s sheer conviction, compared the cases and saw a similar, coincidental scratch. <words>389</words>
Confused but convinced by the whirlwind performance, he handed over the cracked leather case. <words>403</words>
Julian took it with a trembling, triumphant hand, offering a final, dramatic bow to the man before melting back into the crowd. <words>425</words>
One scene was over; the play against the Watcher had only just begun. <words>437</words>
