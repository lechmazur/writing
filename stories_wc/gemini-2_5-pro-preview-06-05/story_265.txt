The bell on the mechanic’s door was the only signal Deputy Miller needed. <12>
His thirty minutes had begun, the sacred window allotted during his patrol car’s oil changes. <26>
He walked not toward the coffee shop, but to the skeletal remains of St. Jude’s Cathedral down the block. <43>
Inside, a lush orchard had conquered the nave, its canopy a living ceiling that spanned the high, dusty rafters. <62>
This was his pilgrimage site, a place of uncharted echoes where birdsong had replaced hymns. <78>
With cautious bravery, he scaled the old choir loft staircase, its wood groaning under his tactical boots. <95>
High above the stone floor, he moved along a wide oak beam into the heart of the strange, suspended grove. <115>
His motivation was simple, almost foolish for a man of his profession: to witness a moment of pure grace. <134>
He believed it lived here, in the impossible green world thriving on decay. <148>
A heavy peach had bent a young branch to its breaking point, the pale wood splintered. <164>
From his pocket, Miller produced a twisted twist tie, a relic from a forgotten evidence bag. <180>
He had to stretch, his torso leaning out over the dizzying drop, to reach the wounded limb. <199>
His fingers, usually so steady on a trigger or a pen, carefully bound the branch to a sturdier one, the wire biting into the bark. <225>
The small act of mending was precise, methodical, and personally impersonal; it was a duty owed not to a person, but to the place itself. <251>
His movement disturbed the nearby blossoms, and a cloud of honeybees rose into the air. <267>
They did not attack but swirled in the columns of light piercing the shattered rose window. <284>
Miller froze, watching them communicate with the secret language of bees, a silent, intricate ballet of direction and discovery. <306>
Their communal hum vibrated through the wood beneath his feet, a resonant frequency that seemed to speak of pollen, sun, and survival. <330>
Light caught their thousands of wings, refracting into a momentary, living halo around a cluster of white apple blossoms. <350>
It was an accidental coronation, a perfect alignment of physics and biology that felt like a benediction. <368>
This was it: a fleeting, unrepeatable vision of order and beauty, offered to no one and yet received by him. <389>
His impassive face remained a mask of professional calm, but his breathing hitched for a single, sharp second. <408>
A vibration in his pocket broke the spell; his car was ready. <420>
He retreated from the rafters, leaving the splinted branch and the humming choir behind, carrying the echo of grace back to a world of sirens and paperwork. <447>
