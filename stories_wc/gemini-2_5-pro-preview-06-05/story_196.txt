The silence in the breakroom was heavier than the floating rock on which the monastery was built. <words>16</words>
Brother Theron’s empty mug sat on the table, a small monument to his resignation. <words>29</words>
Kael, once a swordsman and now just tired, watched a dust mote dance in a sliver of starlight from the window. <words>48</words>
He cultivated a fierce apathy, a placid mask over the embers of a life he’d tried to extinguish. <words>66</words>
Yet, Theron’s quiet departure had stirred the ashes, a small act of rebellion that whispered of other possibilities. <words>84</words>
Kael’s hand drifted beneath his coarse monk’s robe, his fingers finding the familiar texture of a plain cloth bag tied to his belt. <words>108</words>
Inside was a promise, a secret he had kept even from himself for a decade. <words>123</words>
He had come here not for salvation, but for a long rest, a pause in a life of sharp edges and cold steel. <words>146</words>
The monastery offered peace, but it was the sterile peace of a cage, a gentle taming of the soul. <words>165</words>
His promise, however, was one of wildness, of a destination whispered about in campfire tales and madmen’s dreams. <words>184</words>
It was a promise to find the place where the sky fell, a land of true quiet that one could only reach by following meteor showers. <words>210</words>
He knew it sounded like a child’s fantasy, a story told with a knowing naivety that belied the impossible odds. <words>231</words>
But the weariness he felt was a chain, and Theron’s empty chair was a suddenly unlocked link. <words>248</words>
The spark of defiance, long dormant, finally caught flame. <words>257</words>
He would not rot here in serene apathy. <words>265</words>
He would not let the swordsman die so tamely. <words>274</words>
He had to overcome this profound exhaustion, this comfortable prison he had built for himself stone by floating stone. <words>294</words>
The promise he’d made to a younger, bloodied version of himself demanded it. <words>308</words>
It was a vow to not just survive, but to seek out a wonder great enough to make the fight worthwhile. <words>329</words>
He stood, his joints cracking a quiet protest against the sudden resolve. <words>340</words>
The bag at his hip felt heavier now, weighted with purpose instead of just memory. <words>355</words>
He walked to the large, circular window of the breakroom, gazing past the other silent, floating islands of stone into the deep, star-dusted void. <words>382</words>
Somewhere out there, a trail of falling light would soon blaze across the darkness. <words>396</words>
He knew the journey was foolish, the destination perhaps a myth. <words>408</words>
But for the first time in years, the tired swordsman felt the thrill of a path unfolding before him, and he would follow it. <words>432</words>
He would follow it until the end. <words>439</words>
