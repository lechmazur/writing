Elara, the last convicted dream thief, sat among the decaying books of the treehouse library. <words>14</words>
The world outside had been silent for generations, ever since the last human was born and then, eventually, gone. <words>32</words>
Her mind, a mosaic of stolen subconsciousness, hummed with a quiet mania. <words>44</words>
She was here to coax thunder from these empty skies. <words>54</words>
On the dusty floor lay the schematics for her grand design, a chaotic scrawl of symbols and misremembered equations. <words>74</words>
The numbers never added up, a frustrating reflection of her own fragmented self. <words>88</words>
She pushed the papers aside and reached for the flimsy photo album, her only real tool. <words>104</words>
Its cardboard cover was soft with age, the pictures within holding the key. <words>118</words>
She opened it to a faded photograph of a father and son at a baseball game, their faces alight with shared joy. <words>139</words>
Elara had never seen baseball, but she knew the crack of the bat, the smell of cut grass, the soaring hope of a home run. <words>165</words>
These were not her memories, but shards she had pilfered from a hundred different minds, all connected by a shared love for this certain sport. <words>189</words>
She had spent years collecting them, trying to assemble one perfect, powerful moment. <words>203</words>
The final piece was the feeling of the crowd, the unified roar that could shake the heavens. <words>220</words>
It was a dream she had only ever brushed against, its owner too strong to succumb fully. <words>237</words>
Now, with humanity gone, the dream's psychic echo was all that remained, faint but accessible. <words>254</words>
She traced the smiling face of the boy in the photo, the last keeper of that specific memory. <words>272</words>
Her own identity was a ghost, a hollow space filled with the echoes of others. <words>287</words>
To create her thunder, she would have to give up the last vestiges of herself. <words>302</words>
She closed her eyes, focusing all her fractured consciousness on the image held in her hands. <words>318</words>
She gathered the stolen sensations: the sticky feel of cotton candy, the tension of a full count, the warmth of a father's arm. <words>342</words>
All the disparate pieces began to swirl, seeking their original, unified form. <words>355</words>
It was time to plunge. <words>360</words>
She let go of her own meager sense of self and fell headfirst into the collective memory of the game. <words>380</words>
For one brilliant, impossible second, the silence of the world was shattered. <words>392</words>
Not by sound, but by a psychic boom of pure, unadulterated joy and anticipation, the roar of ten thousand souls focused on a single soaring ball. <words>418</words>
It was the thunder she had sought, a fleeting echo of life in a dead world. <words>434</words>
Then, it was gone. <words>439</words>
Elara opened her eyes, emptier than before, a vessel of quiet echoes in a forgotten library. <words>455</words>
The sky outside remained clear and silent, but she had made it rumble. <words>469</words>
And in the profound stillness that followed, she smiled. <words>478</words>
