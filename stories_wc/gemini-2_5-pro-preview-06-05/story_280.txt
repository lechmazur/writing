Elian, the hermit beekeeper of the Kepler-186f system, stood on his quasar observation deck. <words>15</words>
A fine, silvery dust, the system’s version of snow, coated the dome in a silent blanket. <words>30</words>
He studied the delicate tracery left upon it, the pattern of animal tracks in the snow. <words>46</words>
These were his texts, his manuals, his entire curriculum in his quest to become a master of strategy. <words>64</words>
The tiny, six-legged grazers of this moon moved with an unthinking efficiency that shamed the grandest fleet admirals. <words>82</words>
He committed the patterns of their foraging and flight to memory, then turned back inside the quiet dome. <words>100</words>
The air inside was warm and smelled of ozone and honey from his stellar hives. <words>114</words>
On a simple steel counter sat his most cherished possessions: a set of dented brass measuring cups from a world he’d long since left behind. <words>139</words>
He measured out nutrient flour and a scoop of luminous, golden honey, the work of his bees. <words>156</words>
He began to knead the dough, a slow and rhythmic push and fold. <words>170</words>
His hands worked automatically while his mind overlaid the patterns from the dust onto galactic charts. <words>186</words>
The grazers’ retreat from a predator became a flawless fleet withdrawal. <words>197</words>
Their spiraling search for lichen became a new type of patrol formation. <words>210</words>
A soft chime interrupted the hush of distant galaxies that was his only constant companion. <words>226</words>
The face of his old mentor, General Eva Rostova, flickered into existence on the main screen. <words>242</words>
“Elian,” she said, her voice tired, “the council still believes your isolation is a waste of talent.” <words>259</words>
He paused his kneading, wiping a hand on his apron. <words>269</words>
“A seed doesn’t grow in a marketplace, Eva,” he replied, his tone sweetly confrontational. <words>282</words>
“It needs quiet soil.” <words>287</words>
“We face a new threat, a hive-mind that adapts faster than our simulations can predict.” <words>302</words>
Elian looked at the dough on his counter, its surface now smooth and elastic. <words>316</words>
He then glanced back at the screen, his eyes holding the magnificent simplicity of a solved puzzle. <words>333</words>
“They are not a fist to be blocked,” he stated calmly, “they are water, so you must give them a new riverbed to follow.” <words>356</words>
He described the patterns he’d seen, the way the grazers diverted a hunter not with force, but by subtly altering the terrain ahead of it, making their own path the one of least resistance. <words>392</words>
Rostova was silent for a long moment, her strategist’s mind racing. <words>403</words>
“It’s… unorthodox.” <words>405</words>
“It’s natural,” he corrected gently. <words>410</words>
The transmission ended, leaving him once more in the profound silence of his station. <words>424</words>
He shaped the dough into a loaf, a perfect form born of cosmic observation. <words>438</words>
This life was a mixed blessing, a solitary orbit of profound loneliness and unparalleled clarity. <words>453</words>
He placed the loaf in the oven, the quiet click of the door the only sound against the eternal, silent turning of the stars. <words>476</words>
