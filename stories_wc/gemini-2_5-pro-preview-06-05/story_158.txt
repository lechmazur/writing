Barnaby hummed, his cheerful tune an odd counterpoint to the crystalline silence of his ice cavern sanctuary. <words>16</words>
He believed this world was just a draft, a lovely but flawed attempt, and he was simply preparing for the final, much-improved edition. <words>38</words>
A profound, fractal sorrow underpinned his optimism, each happy thought branching into a thousand tiny sadnesses for the reality he had to dismantle. <words>63</words>
For years, he had worked by the light of glowing fungi, meticulously analyzing the subtext of lullabies from every forgotten culture. <words>85</words>
He’d discovered they weren't warnings of the dark, but rather the operating code for it, the very instructions for putting a universe to bed. <words>112</words>
Now, the moment had arrived: the hush as a candle’s flame is pinched, a planetary quiet so deep he could feel it in his bones. <words>140</words>
He glanced at the device on his wrist, a band woven from impossible threads that shimmered with a light of its own. <words>163</words>
The quantum entanglement watch band was his life’s work, one half here with him, the other braided into the fabric of a collapsing nebula trillions of miles away. <words>196</words>
It was the ultimate failsafe, the ultimate key. <words>204</words>
His motivation was simple, pure even: to create a new reality, one where kindness wasn't an exception. <words>225</words>
He took a steadying breath, the cold air sharp in his lungs, and began to speak the final verse he’d decoded from a cradle song about a falling star. <words>256</words>
The words were soft, melodic, yet they carried the weight of cosmic finality. <words>269</words>
His primary action was not to destroy, but to notify. <words>279</words>
He was politely requesting a system-wide reboot. <words>286</words>
As he spoke the last syllable, he pressed a shimmering stud on the watch band, sending his notification across the universe in an instant. <words>313</words>
The response was not a cataclysm of fire and noise, but a politely chaotic unfolding. <words>328</words>
The hard, blue-white walls of the cavern began to soften and flow, their rigid structure dissolving into gentle, impossible currents. <words>351</words>
Light fractured, not into the familiar rainbow, but into the colors of the unforeseen: hues that felt like forgotten memories and tasted like silent laughter. <words>381</words>
The very air grew thick with potential, the old physics sighing as they gave way to new, more graceful laws. <words>404</words>
Barnaby watched, a single tear freezing on his cheek, his heart a perfect, aching paradox of grief and joy. <words>424</words>
He had done it. <words>427</words>
He had sung the old world to sleep to make way for a better dream. <words>442</words>
