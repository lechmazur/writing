<story>
The exiled prince, Alaric, hunched over a customs agent’s derelict desk, the wood cold against his forearms. <words>17</words>
His only inheritance, an antique mortar and pestle of dark, veined marble, sat before him. <words>31</words>
Within it, he ground dried silverleaf and frost-fern, a desperate alchemy he hoped would improve his condition. <words>47</words>
For months, he had sought to concoct a cure for the gnawing loneliness that had followed him from his stolen kingdom. <words>66</words>
He believed unseen forces guided his hands, whispering forgotten recipes on the wind that rattled the office’s broken windows. <words>86</words>
Outside, the world had vanished into a sudden, furious snowstorm. <words>96</words>
The wind howled like a grieving beast, piling drifts against the door and sealing him inside this forgotten place of passage. <words>117</words>
He felt a grim satisfaction; the world was now as isolated as he was. <words>130</words>
Then, a frantic pounding on the heavy oak door shattered the quiet. <words>141</words>
Alaric froze, his pestle hovering over the fragrant powder. <words>150</words>
He pulled the door open just enough to see a figure collapse inward, a woman cloaked in white snow. <words>168</words>
She was shivering violently, her lips a faint blue, and his quest for a mystical cure felt instantly foolish. <words>186</words>
He helped her to the small fire he maintained in a metal wastebin, his movements efficient and sure. <words>203</words>
Without a word, he abandoned his esoteric mixture and instead crushed ginger root and elderflower in the marble mortar. <words>222</words>
The simple, spicy scent filled the air, a fragrance of warmth and life that felt both strangely familiar and entirely new. <words>243</words>
He prepared a steaming tea, his focus absolute, the practiced grace of his hands a stark contrast to his ragged clothes. <words>264</words>
As she drank, color returned to her face, and her eyes watched him with a dawning curiosity. <words>281</words>
To her, this quiet, capable stranger tending a fire in a ruin was unintentionally iconic, a figure of calm in the heart of a blizzard. <words>308</words>
Later, with the storm still raging, Alaric walked to the main entrance, the wind screaming through the keyhole. <words>327</words>
He slid the heavy bolt and turned the old iron key in the lock, the grating sound echoing in the vast, empty hall. <words>349</words>
In that moment, during the turn of a key that locks away the past, he wasn't securing them from the snow, but sealing off the lonely prince he had been. <words>381</words>
He was no longer just an exile searching for a magical remedy in solitude. <words>395</words>
He was a man sharing the warmth of a fire with another soul. <words>409</words>
The unseen forces had not led him to a potion, but to a person. <words>423</words>
He returned to the fire, and for the first time in years, offered someone his name. <words>439</words>
The cure, he was beginning to understand, was simply a chance encounter. <words>451</words>
