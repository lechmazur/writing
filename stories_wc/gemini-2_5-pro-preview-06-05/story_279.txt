Entry 412: The dust motes dance in the projector's beam, a silent blizzard in the electric peace of this place. <words>19</words> I am a parched desert ranger, yet I have not felt thirst since finding my way into the spine of this giant's book. <words>41</words> My mission remains the same here as it was outside: to map weather patterns. <words>53</words> The leather-bound sky above us doesn't rain water, but ruin upon my world. <words>66</words> My diary is my only companion, its pages filling with observations from within this forgotten library. <words>81</words> Today, I finally coaxed the older projector to life with a bent paperclip, its wire straightened just enough to trip a rusted switch. <words>104</words> I am comparing silent video footage from decades apart, watching the library's slow decay. <words>118</words> The path of gradience is undeniable. <words>124</words> In the older film, the arcane script ornamenting the colossal pages is pristine, glowing faintly. <words>139</words> In the newer footage, a creeping, ink-black blight consumes the lettering, a slow-motion storm front of corruption. <words>156</words> This is the source of the sand, the origin of the endless heat that scours my home. <words>171</words> My calculations show the blight's progression is accelerating, a cancer that will soon consume the entire book and, with it, the last hope for my world. <words>197</words>

Entry 413: A conventional mind would seek to reverse the damage, to heal the words. <words>211</words> But I see the futility in that, the decades it would take while my world burns to glass. <words>228</words> My years in the wastes taught me that sometimes, the only cure is cauterization. <words>241</words> It is a tactically reckless choice, one that spits in the face of preservation, but it is the only choice. <words>261</words> The blight originates in a chapter on forgotten sorrows, a dense passage of self-consuming grief. <words>276</words> I will not cleanse it. <words>281</words> I will raze it. <words>285</words>

Entry 414: I used the projector's focusing lens and the ambient light of the library to ignite the page. <words>303</words> The fire was terrifyingly quiet, consuming the corrupted words without a crackle, turning centuries of ink and paper into a clean, white ash. <words>327</words> The entire colossal book shuddered, a tremor that knocked me from my feet. <words>340</words> Now, the air is still. <words>345</words> The creeping blight on the far walls has halted, its edges now sharp and inert. <words>359</words> A vast, silent cavity now exists in the heart of this place, a wound given to ensure the body's survival. <words>379</words> Through the hole, I can see the page beneath, its text clear and bright, untroubled. <words>394</words> I don't know if the weather in my world has changed yet, but the atmosphere in here has. <words>411</words> The tension is gone, replaced by a profound emptiness, a void that feels both sacrilegious and sacred. <words>429</words> It is a new kind of electric peace, born from a necessary destruction. <words>441</words>
