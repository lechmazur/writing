Elias, the self-appointed ringleader of this tiny, padded room, adjusted his headphones. <words>12</words>
He was waiting between whispered confessions for his ghost story podcast, a perfect cover for his true, far lonelier work. <words>29</words>
His sole motivation was to guard the inexplicable artifact resting before him: a simple, stained napkin. <words>45</words>
The reddish-brown smear at its center wasn't wine, but a gateway. <words>56</words>
A low hum vibrated through the soundproof foam, a telltale sign that something was trying to slip through the recording. <words>76</words>
It was a familiar, playful dread, the thrill of the universe's most dangerous game of tag. <words>92</words>
The entity was clever, weaving its essence into the silence, hoping to catch him unaware. <words>107</words>
But Elias possessed an ancestral wisdom, a knowledge passed down a line of guardians whose burden was commonly individual. <words>128</words>
Each of his predecessors had faced this test alone, and he would be no different. <words>144</words>
He smiled faintly, a performer about to begin his act. <words>154</words>
"Not this time, whisper-thing," he murmured into the dead microphone. <words>163</words>
He had to outmaneuver it, not with force, but with finesse. <words>175</words>
His fingers, steady and practiced, flicked open a tarnished silver lighter. <words>186</words>
As he touched the lighter's flame to the napkin's stain, the world inside the booth tilted into nonexistence. <words>203</words>
Gravity vanished. <words>205</words>
Dust motes, his pen, and Elias himself floated an inch above the chair. <words>219</words>
The flame detached from the wick, becoming a perfect, pulsating sphere of orange light. <words>233</words>
The encroaching hum warped into a pained shriek as the orb began its performance. <words>247</words>
Elias guided its movement with subtle shifts of his own body, a silent conductor to a bizarre ballet. <words>266</words>
This was the ancient defense, the method passed down through his bloodline: to outmaneuver the void by the dance of a flame in zero gravity. <words>291</words>
The spherical flame bobbed and weaved, a joyful, deadly thing chasing the unseen intruder around the confined space. <words>310</words>
It dipped playfully toward the microphone, then zipped to the ceiling, its heatless light painting the foam in shifting patterns of dread and wonder. <words>335</words>
The entity, unable to find purchase in the chaotic, beautiful physics of the dance, recoiled. <words>350</words>
With a final, frustrated sigh that sounded like static, it was gone. <words>361</words>
Gravity slammed back into place, and Elias landed softly in his seat. <words>374</words>
The flame extinguished itself, leaving a fresh wisp of smoke curling from the napkin's unburnt surface. <words>390</words>
He carefully folded the stained linen, tucking it back into his worn leather wallet. <words>405</words>
The red light on the mixing board blinked, signaling his next guest had arrived for their scheduled confession. <words>422</words>
Elias cleared his throat, the lonely ringleader ready for the next show, his greatest performance forever unseen. <words>438</words>
