The brig’s single viewport showed the last star beginning to fade into morning light. <words>13</words>
I sat on the cold metal floor, a psychic genealogist turned prisoner, holding the captain’s offering: a pair of dice, one chipped. <words>32</words>
“Tell me their fate,” he had growled, his breath smelling of stale grog and impatience. <words>46</words>
But I wasn’t tracing their future for him, not really; I was doing it to hush the roaring alarm bells of my own recent heartbreak. <words>71</words>
My craft was a quiet one, and I was proudly humble in its execution, knowing I was merely a reader of the universe’s scattered footnotes. <words>96</words>
Usually, I worked slowly, piecing together lineages via diaries left on abandoned bullet trains that drifted like steel ghosts through the void. <words>120</words>
This direct, violent imprint from an object was a different, more dangerous magic. <words>133</words>
With a tone of grave playfulness, I began to speak, my voice the only sound besides the ship’s hum. <words>151</words>
“This one,” I said, holding up the pristine die, “remembers the silk-lined pockets of a marquis and the desperate prayers of a thousand gamblers who won.” <words>179</words>
“And the other?” the captain pressed, leaning against the energy bars of my cell. <words>194</words>
I caressed the small fracture in the second die with my thumb. <words>206</words>
“This chip is a memory of shattering,” I whispered, the vision flooding me. <words>219</words>
“It remembers a wooden tavern table, a final, disastrous roll, and a family’s fortune lost in a single, stupid moment.” <words>241</words>
The puzzle of destiny wasn’t about knowing the outcome, but understanding the pattern. <words>254</words>
The captain wanted a prophecy, a guarantee for his next raid. <words>265</words>
I chose instead to lengthen the story, to stretch its timeline from the ancient past directly to him. <words>283</words>
My psychic senses left the dice and touched the captain’s own bloodline, following a thread I now recognized. <words>301</words>
“The man who threw these dice that fateful night,” I continued, my eyes locking with his, “the one who lost everything… he was your great-great-grandfather.” <words>329</words>
The captain’s bravado evaporated, replaced by a stunned silence. <words>339</words>
My own sorrow felt distant now, a quiet hum instead of a scream, eclipsed by the weight of his inherited failure. <words>359</words>
“The dice don’t have a destiny,” I told him, my voice soft but firm. <words>373</words>
“They are a question your family has been asking for two hundred years.” <words>386</words>
I slid the pair across the floor, the chipped one coming to a rest beside the perfect one. <words>403</words>
“Whether you provide the same old answer is entirely up to you.” <words>416</words>
He stared at the dice, then at me, his face a mask of dawning, dreadful comprehension. <words>431</words>
The last star vanished completely, and the brig door hissed open. <words>443</words>
