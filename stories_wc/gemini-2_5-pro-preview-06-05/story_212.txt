Elara was a farmer, which was typical, but her farm was a shimmer of impossible color on the ethereal plains, which was not. <words>21</words> After the last resource war, this place of raw solace was all she had, a sanctuary carved from the world’s ghost. <words>41</words> She bred new seeds here, coaxing life from the pearlescent soil, each sprout a quiet rebellion. <words>57</words> Her existence was typically atypical; a simple life built upon the ruins of a complex catastrophe. <words>73</words> A low, resonant hum vibrated at the edge of her perception, what she called the song of boundaries, the melody that kept the plains separate from the broken-toothed cities beyond. <words>106</words> It was the sound of her freedom, and her cage. <words>116</words>

One evening, while turning the soil, her spade struck something hard: a lacquered box containing a magician’s deck of trick cards, a relic from the life she’d fled. <words>146</words> Each card was a lie, a sleight-of-hand promise from him, the charismatic leader who had dictated her every choice with a smile and a stacked deck. <words>174</words> The sight of the grinning jester made her breath catch, the old chains tightening around her heart. <words>191</words> She had to escape him all over again, not just his city, but his memory. <words>206</words>

An urge, frantic and overwhelming, seized her. <words>213</words> She began to jabber, spilling years of silenced rage and sorrow into the twilight air, a torrent of broken words and raw feeling. <words>238</words> She grabbed a charcoal stick and scrawled her frantic monologue onto the backs of the cards, defacing the false king and the one-eyed jack with her truth. <words>268</words> This was not a letter; it was an exorcism. <words>277</words>

Her method for disposal came to her like a fever dream, an answer carried on the humming air. <words>296</words> She gathered the defiled cards and a collection of empty seed bottles, then walked toward the sound, toward the edge of her world where the plains dissolved into a slow, churning sea of mist. <words>334</words> This was the source of the song, the ultimate boundary. <words>345</words> She sealed her messages in a bottle, one for each painful memory, and cast them into the vaporous tide. <words>366</words> She watched them float away, carried by a sea that wasn't water, toward a destination that didn't matter. <words>386</words>

As the last bottle vanished, the song of boundaries seemed to soften, its notes shifting from a warning to a lullaby. <words>409</words> She felt the raw solace of the plains seep back into her bones, no longer tainted by the past. <words>428</words> Turning back to her fields of strange, hopeful plants, Elara was finally just a farmer, her hands in the dirt, her future her own to grow. <words>456</words>
