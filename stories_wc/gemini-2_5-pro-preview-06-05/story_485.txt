The submersible's lights cut through the abyssal dark, illuminating the fractured dome of the Xylos laboratory. <words>16</words>
Kael piloted the craft with a practiced, aggressive ease, a brazen raider in a tomb of forgotten science. <words>33</words>
Above, the world tore itself apart in social upheaval, but down here, only the slow dance of decay remained. <words>51</words>
He was here for Elara, the brilliant mind the surface world had broken and discarded. <words>66</words>
His mission was to shelter the flame of her faltering genius, to find the data core that would vindicate her life's work. <words>88</words>
Docking with a groan of stressed metal, he cycled the airlock, the pressure change a familiar pop in his ears. <words>108</words>
The laboratory was a gallery of ghosts, of research notes left mid-sentence and coffee mugs growing faint films of algae. <words>129</words>
He moved with a fractured grace, a predator out of place among the sterile ruins of progress. <words>146</words>
The main server room was just as they'd described it, a cathedral of silent, monolithic towers. <words>163</words>
And there, etched into the central console's casing, was the insignia of Director Valerius, the man who had stolen Elara's research and left her for dead. <words>191</words>
Echoes of that betrayal, cold and sharp, resonated in the pressurized silence of the deep. <words>207</words>
Kael found the data core, a small, unassuming crystal humming with latent energy. <words>222</words>
But holding it, seeing that hateful insignia again, sparked something in him, an impulsive thoughtfulness that bypassed reason. <words>242</words>
He couldn't just give this to her; he had to warn her that old ghosts were stirring. <words>260</words>
His eyes scanned the debris-strewn floor and found it: a small, blackened piece of charcoal from a long-dead emergency flare. <words>283</words>
A memory surfaced, a superstition from the coastal slums of his youth, whispered by old fishermen to keep the drowned from following you home. <words>311</words>
You draw the tide-knot, a broken spiral, to sever the connection and blind the spirits of the deep. <words>331</words>
His fingers, usually wrapped around a throttle or a blade, felt clumsy with the delicate charcoal. <words>348</words>
He knelt and drew the jagged, incomplete circle directly onto the smooth face of the data core's housing. <words>367</words>
It was a primitive, desperate mark on a piece of impossible technology, a message only she would understand. <words>387</words>
This was more than data retrieval; it was an attempt to ward off the returning specter of Valerius's ambition. <words>407</words>
He would deliver the core, and she would see the knot, and she would know the danger was not just in the past. <words>431</words>
Leaving the lab, Kael felt the weight of his warning settle, a fragile shield against the coming storm. <words>449</words>
He was her guardian, a rough hand protecting a brilliant, flickering light from the crushing darkness. <words>466</words>
