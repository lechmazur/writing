Ranger Silas patrolled the High-Orchard, his boots crunching on a path of recycled asphalt and fallen crabapples. <words>16</words>
This repurposed highway overpass was his sanctuary, a grid of chaotic organization he curated with a zealot's fire. <words>33</words>
In an age after the last human dream was dreamt, his singular motivation was to catch the echo of a goddess his grandmother had sworn lived here. <words>59</words>
He clutched the plain notebook against his chest, its worn cover holding all of his grandmother's secrets. <words>77</words>
The entries were cryptic, charting how the goddess's presence would fluctuate, a shimmer at the edge of sight. <words>97</words>
Today, the air itself felt different, charged with a feeling both intimate and alien, something familiarly unknown. <words>116</words>
A flash of impossible blue, a kingfisher where no water source existed, darted between pear trees. <words>132</words>
This was a sign, a chance encounter foretold in the notebook's spidery script. <words>146</words>
He flipped open the book, his fingers tracing a frantic map of ley lines she had drawn over a faded highway schematic. <words>168</words>
"Section Gamma, by the old gantry," he muttered, his breath fogging in the strangely cool air. <words>183</words>
He ran, his park ranger discipline dissolving into raw, desperate need. <words>194</words>
The world seemed to warp around him, the neat rows of apple trees blurring into a primal forest. <words>211</words>
The goddess's power would always fluctuate, strengthening and then vanishing in a heartbeat, and he couldn't risk missing it. <words>232</words>
He arrived at the rusted gantry, a skeletal relic from the overpass's former life. <words>247</words>
The feeling was overwhelming now, a memory of a forgotten emotion pressing in on all sides. <words>264</words>
He had expected a vision, a voice, some grand confirmation of his faith. <words>277</words>
Instead, through another chance encounter, a single, withered apricot fell from a barren branch and landed in his outstretched palm. <words>299</words>
As his fingers closed around it, the world did not change, but his perception of it did. <words>316</words>
The chaotic organization of the orchard suddenly resolved into a perfect, living pattern. <words>330</words>
He saw the memory of the concrete mixers, the scent of the first blossoms, the ghost of a million forgotten commutes. <words>351</words>
The familiarly unknown presence wasn't a deity in the sky, but the accumulated soul of the place itself. <words>370</words>
His grandmother's secrets weren't a guide to capturing a god, but a lesson in how to listen to the world's last waking memory. <words>395</words>
The echo wasn't a being to be caught, but a story to be briefly inhabited. <words>411</words>
His frantic energy settled into a profound calm, the notebook now feeling less like a manual and more like a shared diary. <words>434</words>
He finally understood that his true duty was not to trap the echo, but to simply tend its garden. <words>453</words>
