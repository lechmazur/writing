Elara, the last wandering orchardist, drifted through the grand, silent chamber of the forgotten underwater city hall. <words>16</words>
Sunken centuries ago, its marble columns were now furred with phosphorescent algae, casting a ghostly green light on the empty thrones of a lost government. <words>37</words>
She had come to this dead nexus between realities to reclaim a path her people had been forced to abandon. <words>54</words>
From a waterproof satchel, she carefully withdrew her most precious object: a collection of dried leaves bound in worn leather. <words>74</words>
Each brittle, veined specimen was a trustworthy unique map, a key to a single thread in the vast tapestry of the multiverse. <words>96</words>
Her grandmother’s kitchen table wisdom echoed in her mind, simple truths about root and branch that applied as much to cosmic pathways as they did to apple trees. <words>128</words>
“The oldest routes remember the hands that tended them,” the old woman had said, and Elara intended to prove it. <words>147</words>
She selected a silver-veined leaf from a long-extinct celestial pear tree, placing it flat on the submerged mayoral desk. <words>167</words>
Closing her eyes, Elara reached out not with her own hand, but with the one she always felt beside her. <words>186</words>
The touch of a phantom hand, her grandmother’s spectral presence, pressed down upon the leaf. <words>201</words>
It was a method born of love and loss, a way to interface with the echoes of creation itself. <words>219</words>
The leaf did not stir in the still water, but a warmth bloomed from its surface, a current of pure potential only she could feel. <words>242</words>
A faint, shimmering line of light, no thicker than a spider’s thread, pierced the gloom of the hall, stretching into an unseen distance. <words>264</words>
She had done it; the trade route to the Cygnus X-1 orchards was open once more. <words>279</words>
The success was a quiet, hollow thing, filled with the ache of her solitude. <words>293</words>
To map these vital trade routes was a sacred, lonely duty, ensuring scattered worlds would not starve for lack of a neighbor’s fruit. <words>318</words>
She traced the new route onto a fresh vellum sheet, her movements precise and practiced. <words>333</words>
The phantom hand rested on her shoulder for a moment, a comforting, weightless pressure. <words>347</words>
It was a bittersweet grit that fueled her, the memory of a shared past pushing her toward an unknown future. <words>365</words>
One more route reclaimed, one less world isolated within the infinite possibilities of the multiverse. <words>380</words>
Packing her collection away, she swam toward the fractured dome of the city hall, already thinking of the next forgotten path. <words>401</words>
Her work was far from over, a constant, quiet struggle against the entropy that sought to sever every connection. <words>419</words>
She was a gardener in a forest of collapsing stars, and her harvest was hope. <words>433</words>
