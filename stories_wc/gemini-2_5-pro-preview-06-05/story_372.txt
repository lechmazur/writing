It was all just a rambling destiny, wasn't it, a path worn through the neon-drenched filth of these futuristic city slums by people who thought they were choosing. <words>27</words>
I was just another one of them, a lovelorn spy trying to outrun the unstoppable avalanche of my own bad decisions. <words>46</words>
The avalanche had a name, of course: Anya. <words>54</words>
We met tracing the ghost-lines of the old city, a shared interest in urban exploration that felt like the only clean thing left in this world. <words>81</words>
We’d crawl through forgotten sub-sectors and promise each other forever under the hum of failing power grids. <words>100</words>
Now, forever felt like a long time to be haunted. <words>110</words>
My hideout smelled of ozone and recycled water, but tonight, it also smelled of the synth-broth I’d finally perfected. <words>131</words>
On my cluttered workbench, next to the burner, sat a single, unused sticky label. <words>146</words>
It was meant for the data-cache I’d prepared for her, a complete exit strategy, our ticket out of the game. <words>167</words>
I lifted the bowl, the steam warming my face as I stared into my own unfamiliar reflections warping across the polished chrome of the spoon. <words>193</words>
Who was that hollowed-out man looking back? <words>201</words>
At the instant the new recipe is finally tasted, a chime echoed through the small room. <words>217</words>
Her face materialized on my wall screen, impossibly beautiful and utterly serene. <words>229</words>
She didn’t look like a monster, or a traitor, or the architect of my ruin. <words>245</words>
She just looked… distant. <words>249</words>
“I knew you’d land here,” she began, her voice smooth as polished steel. <words>261</words>
She started to gloat, not with fire or passion, but with a chilling, methodical calm. <words>277</words>
She detailed how she’d dismantled my network, sold my secrets, and rerouted the kill-squads away from her own trail. <words>298</words>
Her expression held no malice, only a curiously indifferent satisfaction, like a gamer admiring a high score. <words>316</words>
“It was the only logical move,” she explained, as if discussing a change in the weather. <words>331</words>
“You were a liability I couldn’t afford.” <words>338</words>
The noodles, once a symbol of a tiny, private victory, turned to ash in my mouth. <words>354</words>
My reflection in the now-dark screen was still a stranger, but a different one. <words>369</words>
The lovesick fool was gone, replaced by something harder, something forged in the certainty of betrayal. <words>386</words>
This wasn't a rambling destiny I was caught in; it was a meticulously crafted trap. <words>401</words>
The avalanche wasn't something to be outrun. <words>409</words>
It was something to be faced, something to be climbed, and she was standing right at the top. <words>428</words>
