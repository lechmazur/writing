Silas adjusted the tripod with the grim focus of a man defusing a bomb, his breath fogging in the metallic air. <19> The radio wave garden hummed around him, an artfully messy testament to forgotten signals and rusted dreams. <34> His true motivation was to map the abandoned railways that snaked beneath this valley, a project he pursued with a despairing cheer that gnawed at his own soul. <59> He believed that by measuring the echo in an abandoned water tower looming nearby, he could pinpoint the ghost-tunnels below. <79> It was a strange science, but it was his. <88> From his worn rucksack, he pulled a sonar emitter and a small, velvet-wrapped object. <102> The antique hairbrush felt cold in his calloused hands, its silver back tarnished with time and memory. <118> He told himself he brought it for luck, a lie as thin as the static whispering from the old satellite dishes. <137> He was really here because this was her project, her obsession with the lost lines that crisscrossed their history. <155> A sharp, clinical tone suddenly pierced the garden's low hum, a sound only he could hear, echoing from a place miles and a lifetime away. <179> It was the final beep of a hospital monitor, a sound that marked the precise end of his world. <197> In that exact moment, as the last echo of her life faded, his own equipment began to scream. <215> The sonar emitter sparked violently, its delicate wiring unable to cope with the garden's sudden surge of spectral energy. <233> A cascade of failures caused the entire system to short-circuit, plunging the clearing into an abrupt and profound silence. <251> The despairing cheer shattered. <255> There was no more mapping, no more frantic purpose, just the hollow quiet of the tower and the ache in his chest. <276> He looked down at the antique hairbrush, at the single strand of her auburn hair still caught in its bristles. <295> "I'm not mapping for history," he whispered to the silent antennas, the words tearing from his throat. <310> "I was just trying to follow you." <317> The honesty of it was a physical blow, knocking the air from his lungs and the strength from his legs. <336> He sank to his knees on the damp earth, the lie he'd been living finally discharged like a spent current. <355> He wasn't a cartographer of lost railways; he was just a seasoned woodsman who had lost his way entirely. <373> A profound sadness washed over him, clean and cold and true, and in its depths, he felt a strange and terrible release. <394> He was no longer running. <399> Freed by honesty, he could finally begin the long walk back through the woods, alone. <414>
