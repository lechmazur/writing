I paused, pen hovering over the half-written letter to my brother, the words caught somewhere between my throat and the page. <words>21</words>
The air in the abandoned carnival shooting gallery was thick with the ghosts of salt and rust, a scent I knew better from sunken hulls than from dry land. <words>48</words>
My fingers traced the familiar shape in my pocket: a small piece of amber, a prehistoric fly trapped within its golden tomb. <words>70</words>
This place had been our family tradition, the annual fair a pilgrimage led by our father, with you, Leo, always at his side. <words>94</words>
I was just the quiet echo, the shadow trailing behind your bright light. <words>106</words>
But coming here alone was a quiet, fleeting rebellion, an attempt to reclaim the memory as my own. <words>124</words>
The rows of tin ducks and faded stars stared back with blank, painted eyes, silent witnesses to my trespass. <words>143</words>
As a wreck-diver, Iâ€™m used to the whispers of the drowned, their cold sorrows clinging to me like silt. <words>163</words>
Here, the whispers were different; they were thin, crackling echoes of laughter and calliope music, the joyful ghosts of summers long past. <words>187</words>
I wanted to arouse something more from the silence, to find the specific spirit of my own forgotten moment. <words>207</words>
I pulled out the amber, holding it up to the sliver of light piercing the grimy window. <words>225</words>
I remembered the weight of the cork gun, the surprising crack as I fired, and the impossible clatter of the final tin star falling. <words>251</words>
For a single, brilliant second, I had stepped out of the shadow, my victory sharp and clear. <words>268</words>
Then Dad had clapped you on the back for some other, louder achievement, and my prize, this tiny coffin of fossilized resin, felt small again. <words>296</words>
A joyfully melancholic pang went through me now, a bittersweet ache for the girl who won this treasure and promptly hid it away. <words>321</words>
Standing in the decay, I let the feeling swell, a warmth spreading through my chest that had nothing to do with the sun. <words>344</words>
It was the slow, painful, and wonderful thawing of a heart long frozen by the pressure of being second-best. <words>364</words>
The ghosts of the gallery seemed to sigh with me, not in sadness, but in relief. <words>380</words>
My motivation had been to simply face this place, but it had become something more. <words>396</words>
I was no longer just a whisperer for the dead at sea; I was learning to hear myself. <words>414</words>
I looked back down at the letter on my lap, at the empty space waiting for me. <words>431</words>
My pen finally touched the paper, the ink flowing as smoothly as a deep-water current. <words>446</words>
"I think I'm finally ready to come home," I wrote, "but this time, on my own terms." <words>464</words>
