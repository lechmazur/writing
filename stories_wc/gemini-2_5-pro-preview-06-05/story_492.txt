Kael stood on the third step of the dead escalator, a monument of rust and stillness in the neon-drenched back alley. <words>20</words>
His gaze was unfocused, lost somewhere between a flickering noodle shop sign and the schematics for a dream-catcher that only he could see. <words>41</words>
The city’s promises were just fractured illusions, shards of light glittering in the grime, and he felt an old, unwelcome ache to hammer them back together. <words>68</words>
He hated this feeling, this pull to be the reluctant catalyst for a change no one else believed was possible. <words>87</words>
A sigh escaped his lips, smelling of ozone and regret, as he adjusted the heavy canvas sack on his shoulder. <words>106</words>
Inside, the familiar weight of his blacksmith's tools—a carbon-steel hammer, tungsten tongs, a miniature portable anvil—settled against his spine. <words>129</words>
These were instruments of a cruder, more honest age, perfect for the kind of ruthless kindness he was about to dispense. <words>150</words>
The target was OmniCorp’s primary server nexus, a fortress that supposedly held the city’s collective consciousness in a state of blissful apathy. <words>174</words>
Standard entry was impossible, but Kael’s mind didn’t see walls; it saw pathways. <words>188</words>
He planned to infiltrate not through a door or a vent, but via the interconnected trails of forgotten pneumatic tubes, abandoned data conduits, and the city’s own geothermal piping. <words>221</words>
It was a route only a man considered normally weird would ever conceive of, let alone attempt. <words>237</words>
He stepped off the escalator, his worn boots splashing in a puddle of iridescent sludge. <words>252</words>
His first step was a loose maintenance panel behind a waste reclamation unit, humming with stolen power. <words>269</words>
He pried it open with a grunt, revealing a dark, narrow shaft descending into the city’s forgotten guts. <words>287</words>
This wasn't an act of terrorism, but of radical therapy. <words>298</words>
He had to break the system’s fever, to shatter the placid dream it fed its citizens. <words>316</words>
He would descend into its heart and find the core lie, the central illusion holding everything in its thrall. <words>336</words>
Then, with the raw, physical force of his ancient tools, he would hammer that lie into a new shape. <words>355</words>
He would not give them a better dream; he would give them the chance to build a real one. <words>374</words>
It was a terrible, beautiful responsibility. <words>380</words>
As he slipped into the darkness, the last thing he saw was his own distorted reflection in the puddle, a strange man on a strange mission to gather fractured illusions into something bright. <words>415</words>
