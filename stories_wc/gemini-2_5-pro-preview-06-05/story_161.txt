They called me the orchardist, a quaint little nickname for the volunteer who was never tardy. <words>16</words>
My old life of tending to apple trees had instilled a patience for patterns, for the subtle signs of rot spreading just beneath the skin. <words>38</words>
It was a skill that served me well here, in this place that took my family and left me with nothing but a thirst for ruin and an antique letter seal I’d pried from a dead man’s desk. <words>76</words>
This gleaming, sterile hangar wasn't a paper airplane test facility; it was the nest. <words>90</words>
The "planes" were sophisticated drones, their wings made of a polymer that shimmered under the industrial lights, and they danced in the air with an unnerving, organic grace. <words>121</words>
Throughout my volunteering, I watched them, cataloging every dip and flutter, every silent, coded conversation. <words>137</words>
The executives, smug in their tailored suits, believed their communications were impenetrable, a secret language of aerodynamics. <words>156</words>
Oh, the delicious irony that their downfall would be orchestrated by a man who used to worry about aphids. <words>175</words>
Tonight, I cornered their newest engineer, a bright-eyed boy named Finch, in the primary observation deck. <words>192</words>
"You're wondering why our flight-path data looks so chaotic, yet so beautiful," I began, a grin pulling at my lips. <words>212</words>
He nodded, nervously clutching his tablet. <words>218</words>
With a flourish, I pressed the antique letter seal into a nearby block of modeling clay, leaving the crisp impression of a peacock in full display. <words>246</words>
"They're arrogant," I said, tapping the clay figure. <words>254</words>
"They based their entire encryption on a vanity project." <words>263</words>
I pulled up two images on the main screen: one was the flight telemetry from today's most important "test," and the other was a high-resolution photograph of a peacock's tail. <words>295</words>
"I am going to demonstrate for you how a multi-billion dollar corporation sends its kill orders," I purred with a theatrical wave of my hand. <words>323</words>
I began to overlay the images, and the boy’s face drained of color as the drone's flight path perfectly traced the shimmering ocelli—the eyes—in the bird's feathers. <words>355</words>
Each sweep of the drone’s wings, each subtle change in altitude, corresponded to the fanning and trembling of the plumage. <words>378</words>
"The quiver of the fifth primary feather is the target's location," I explained, my voice dripping with sardonic glee. <words>398</words>
"The shimmer frequency of the eye-spot is the execution window." <words>409</words>
Finch stared, horrified, as the conspiracy unraveled before him, not in whispers, but via the patterns in a peacock's tail. <words>430</words>
Overcoming my tragedy wouldn't bring them back, but this, this exquisite moment of intellectual violence, was a harvest I was going to enjoy. <words>455</words>
