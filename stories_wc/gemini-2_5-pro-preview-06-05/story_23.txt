The wandering bard, Pipkin, arrived by following wind patterns that tasted of ozone and forgotten lullabies. <15> He clutched a worn lute in one hand and a gourd rattle in the other, his expression one of profound concentration mixed with the faint, persistent bewilderment of a man who has misplaced his trousers. <46> Before him shimmered the solar wind collection point, a filigree of immense, gossamer sails catching stellar particles like a spiderweb spun by a god with a penchant for geometry. <76> This particular cosmic intersection was badly out of tune, a fact Pipkin could feel in his teeth, which hummed a rather dreary C-minor. <99> His grand purpose, a self-appointed quest to restore universal systems, often led him to such cacophonous locales. <118> He was here to coax the universe back into harmony, a task for which he employed a traditionally creative approach involving more folk music than physics. <144>

Pipkin settled down to wait, observing the station’s sole occupant. <154> The orchard’s keeper, a lanky automaton made of polished chrome and what looked suspiciously like repurposed kitchenware, was meticulously dusting a grove of crystalline trees that pulsed with captured light. <188> It was a thankless job, polishing the very firmament, but the keeper did it with a certain jaunty flair. <209> Pipkin knew the ritual could only begin when the orchard’s keeper finishes the day’s final chore. <226> Finally, the automaton put away its feather duster (a genuine nebula-plume, the very best), gave a creaky bow to the silent orchard, and trundled off for its oil bath. <257>

Showtime. <258>

Pipkin stood, took a deep breath that smelled of starlight, and began to rattle his gourd. <274> It wasn't a simple shake; it was a complex, syncopated rhythm that spoke the language of planetary orbits and gravitational tides. <296> Inside the gourd, a collection of pressed leaves from the First Orchard, each a perfect, fossilized note of creation, skittered and danced. <320> Their papery whispers were amplified by the collection point’s strange acoustics, weaving into the solar wind itself. <338> The dreary C-minor hum in Pipkin’s jaw wobbled, then shifted into a cheerful, if slightly tipsy, F-major. <358> A dead crystal-branch on the nearest tree flickered, then bloomed with a soft, golden luminescence. <373> The age of renewal had begun here, not with a bang, but with the gentle percussion of very old leaves. <393>

From a porthole, the orchard’s keeper gave a thumbs-up with a spatula-hand before disappearing again. <409> Pipkin smiled, a small, weary thing. <415> One system retuned, countless more to go. <422> He consulted the breeze, which now whispered of a discordant quasar and the quickest route to get there. <440> With a sigh that mingled relief with the daunting nature of his eternal tour, the bard wandered back into the cosmic slipstream. <462> He had a universe to fix, one ridiculously important folk song at a time. <477>
