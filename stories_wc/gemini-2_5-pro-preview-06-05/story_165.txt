Elara, a conjurer whose magic was as gentle as her spirit, lived with a single motivation: to rebuild a forgotten garden in the heart of the mountain. <words>24</words>
The dwarves of this underground city, all stone and suspicion, saw her quest for justice as a fool's errand. <words>42</words>
Her resolve had been forged long ago, in a silent forest, at the precise, sharp sound of a breaking brittle branch. <words>63</words>
That snap had echoed the shattering of the garden's great centerpiece, a magnificent stained glass butterfly. <words>79</words>
Now, she held the last shard, its edges dangerously sharp against her palm. <words>92</words>
She had spent years gathering the fragments from dusty dwarven storerooms and forgotten tunnels, an act of joyful terror with every piece recovered. <words>117</words>
Each piece was etched with runes that made no sense, a puzzle that felt inscrutably obvious, mocking her with its nearness. <words>138</words>
The dwarven elders warned her to cease, their threats rumbling like deep-earth tremors. <words>152</words>
They claimed the garden had poisoned the rock, a lie she felt in her bones. <words>166</words>
One night, holding a shard to a flickering crystal lamp, she saw the light pass through the runes, projecting their mirror image on the wall. <words>191</words>
They were reversed messages. <words>195</words>
"Eht htrae sehtaerb," one read when corrected. <words>202</words>
The Earth breathes. <words>205</words>
A wave of triumphant fear washed over her as she began to reassemble the creature of glass and lead. <words>223</words>
She worked in her small cavern, whispering the reversed words as she fitted the pieces together. <words>240</words>
"Rehtaf-enots s'worrom," she chanted, her voice trembling with power. <words>250</words>
Sorrow's stone-father. <words>252</words>
The message was a lament, a confession from the dwarf who had destroyed the garden not from malice, but from a grief-stricken fear that its surface-world life would weaken the mountain that was his home. <words>291</words>
Justice, she realized, was not about punishment, but about healing this ancient wound. <words>304</words>
As the final wing piece clicked into place, the butterfly pulsed with an emerald light, its glow soft and alive. <words>324</words>
The air in the cavern grew thick with the scent of damp soil and night-blooming flowers, a terrifying and beautiful phantom. <words>345</words>
Dwarves gathered at her doorway, their faces a mixture of awe and alarm, drawn by the impossible aroma. <words>363</words>
The light from the butterfly streamed past them, down the main thoroughfare, and into the dead cavern where the garden had been. <words>386</words>
There, in the center of the barren rock, a single, luminous seed sprouted, unfurling two perfect leaves of pure light. <words>407</words>
The dwarves stared, their stony silence broken by a collective, sharp intake of breath. <words>421</words>
Elara watched the sprout, her heart pounding with a joy so fierce it felt like terror. <words>436</words>
She had not just rebuilt a memory; she had planted a future. <words>448</words>
