The news had arrived on the frozen wind: the final piece of evidence was filed away, officially sealing the tomb of the old ways. <words>23</words> A flare of ephemeral rancor, sharp and thin as an icicle, pricked Kaelen’s heart before dissolving into his usual sea of doubt. <words>44</words> He stood in the frigid tundra orchard, a place of impossible contrasts where skeletal frost-apple trees huddled around the life-giving warmth of geothermal vents. <words>69</words> His hand, clumsy and uncertain, trembled as it clutched the hilt of a sword he felt unworthy to carry. <words>88</words> This was his duty now, his unwanted inheritance: to restore the traditional systems the archivists had just declared extinct. <words>109</words> His other hand protected a single blank postcard in his pocket, a foolish, tangible prayer for connection. <words>127</words> He was a naturally awkward man, his movements jerky and ill-suited for the grace his task demanded, and he stumbled on a patch of black, volcanic ice. <words>155</words> Regaining his balance, he peered into the largest vent, its shimmering heat distorting the air into a watery veil. <words>176</words> He was here to witness the crossing, the great bridging of worlds that his ancestors had prophesied. <words>194</words> They said it would not be a violent tear in reality, but a quiet exchange, a migration of spirit. <words>214</words> The process was to happen by the life of hermit crabs moving shells; the soul of their world, having outgrown its dying vessel, would seek a new home in this one. <words>248</words> A low hum vibrated up through the soles of his boots, a sound that felt older than the ice around him. <words>268</words> From the heart of the vent’s steam, a form began to emerge. <words>280</words> It was not a monster or a god, but something far stranger: a lattice of pure light, pulsing with soft colors and ancient patterns. <words>304</words> The light-form was hesitant, probing the cold air as if testing the temperature of new water. <words>321</words> Kaelen’s breath caught, his ingrained fear warring with his profound sense of duty. <words>335</words> He drew his sword, not as a weapon, but as an offering, its polished steel reflecting the emerging spirit and the stark white landscape. <words>359</words> His awkwardness fell away, replaced by a stillness he had never known, as he held the blade steady to guide the light-form out of its vaporous shell. <words>389</words> The spirit flowed around the blade, anchoring itself to the physical world with a sigh of wind and a scent of thawing earth. <words>412</words> The orchard seemed to brighten, the vents pulsing with a stronger, more stable warmth. <words>427</words> Kaelen finally lowered his sword, the fleeting bitterness in his soul replaced by the heavy weight of a promise beginning to be fulfilled. <words>451</words> He pulled out the blank postcard, its empty space no longer a void of despair, but a clean page waiting for the first words of a new history. <words>481</words>
