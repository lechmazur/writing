The final name on the list, Elias Thorne, received a thin black line through it, the ink still gleaming in the lamplight. <words>20</words>
I stood alone in the lighthouse keeper’s bedroom, a place haunted more by memory than by any actual ghost. <words>38</words>
“Well, Elias,” I murmured to the empty air, “that’s everyone but you.” <words>49</words>
My official directive was simple: cleanse the site, neutralize the anchor, and move on. <words>63</words>
But my personal motivation was to learn traditional methods, the old ways of laying spirits to rest that my superiors deemed inefficient. <words>84</words>
They preferred soulless rituals, but I believed in a more personal touch, a kind of reckless precision in dealing with the dead. <words>106</words>
The central promise of every keeper was to guard the light, a vow that for Elias had eroded into a bitter, lingering duty long after his death. <words>133</words>
His anchor, I knew, was tucked beneath a loose floorboard. <words>144</words>
I pried the board up with my knife and pulled out the object: a short piece of rope, horribly frayed at one end. <words>166</words>
The very rope he’d used to hang himself when the light was automated, his purpose extinguished. <words>182</words>
My job was to confiscate it, severing his tie to this world with cold, bureaucratic finality. <words>198</words>
Instead, I placed the rope carefully on the nightstand. <words>208</words>
His file mentioned a peculiar detail, a shared love for a specific type of dance known only to the old coastal families: the Salt-Spray Reel. <words>235</words>
It was a dance my own grandfather had taught me, a flurry of stomps and turns meant to mimic a ship on a stormy sea. <words>260</words>
To attempt a connection through such a method was unorthodox, bordering on insane. <words>274</words>
Still, I thought, it was certainly possible. <words>281</words>
I kicked off my boots, the bare wood cold against my socks. <words>293</words>
“Alright, old man,” I said, my voice steady, “the service taught me how to banish shades, but my grandfather taught me how to dance.” <words>319</words>
I began the opening steps, my movements sharp and exact in the cramped space. <words>333</words>
A chill dropped the room’s temperature, and a shimmering form coalesced near the window, its spectral face a mask of confusion. <words>354</words>
I didn’t falter, just offered a wry grin. <words>362</words>
“Your turn to lead,” I offered. <words>367</words>
For a moment, the ghost of Elias Thorne simply watched, his form flickering like a dying candle flame. <words>384</words>
Then, with a ghostly sigh that sounded like wind through a cracked pane, he mirrored my step. <words>401</words>
We danced the Salt-Spray Reel, a sentinel and a spirit, turning to a silent tune only we could hear. <words>421</words>
When the final step was taken and I stood panting in the sudden silence, the room was empty once more. <words>441</words>
On the nightstand, the frayed piece of rope crumbled into a fine gray dust that smelled of salt and absolution. <words>461</words>
