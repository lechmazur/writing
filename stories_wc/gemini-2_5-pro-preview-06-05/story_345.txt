The air, thin and cold, tasted of wet earth and ozone. <words>11</words>
Elias jogged, a steady, rhythmic penance through the labyrinth orchard of giant beanstalks that clawed at the pearlescent clouds. <words>30</words>
He was a lapsed priest, though the title felt like a borrowed coat, ill-fitting and forgotten in a closet for years. <words>49</words>
His only guide was the snow, which fell not in a blanket but in deliberate, shifting patterns upon the mossy ground. <words>69</words>
He followed the crystalline lace, the fleeting geometry a language he was slowly, painstakingly learning to read. <words>86</words>
This was his new scripture, written on the wind and erased by the next gust. <words>100</words>
He was, he admitted to the silent, towering stalks, unapologetically confused. <words>112</words>
There was no shame in it, not anymore; certainty was the cage he had spent a lifetime trying to escape. <words>132</words>
His old life had been a study in the price of complacency, of nodding along to a divine plan that felt increasingly hollow. <words>155</words>
He had watched his parish wither, had offered platitudes when action was needed, and had mistaken the comfort of routine for the presence of God. <words>182</words>
The unraveling had been quiet, a slow pulling of threads in the background of his life. <words>198</words>
Now, he was living through the hush of fate unraveling on a cosmic scale, and his own small rebellion felt like a harmonizing note. <words>224</words>

Several beads were missing, snapped from their wires long ago, leaving gaps in its calculations. <words>271</words>
He used to see it as broken, a symbol of his own fractured faith and the world's imperfect sums. <words>291</words>
He had clung to it, a relic of an ordered system he once believed could account for every soul. <words>310</words>
But here, under a sky that glowed with a dull radiance, its incompleteness felt like a promise. <words>327</words>
Fate, like the abacus, had missing beads, unaccounted-for variables, spaces where a man could choose to run. <words>347</words>

He adjusted his pace, his breath pluming in the chilled air, and jogged toward the opening. <words>419</words>
The abacus, with its beautiful, liberating flaws, was tucked safely back in his pocket. <words>433</words>
He was running not from a broken system, but into the boundless possibilities of its missing pieces. <words>451</words>
