The neon signs of the great billboard maze bled through the bar’s grimy window, painting the dust motes in shades of poison and promise. <words>23</words>
I, Kaelen, the cosmos’s chosen messenger, was experiencing what the ancient texts might charitably call mild panic. <words>40</words>
“Just shape destiny with your bare hands,” the visions had whispered, a motivational poster slogan for the terminally doomed. <words>59</words>
My hands, currently slick with sweat, were fumbling with a pocket puzzle box. <words>72</words>
It was a lovely little thing, all brass and obsidian, fitted with a mere thirteen locks. <words>87</words>
Because why make saving the world easy? <words>95</words>
This whole ridiculous errand had defined the blur between my lost years, a penance for a crime I couldn't remember committing. <words>118</words>
My gaze fell to the battered wooden bar top, my only real oracle in this desert of flickering lies. <words>136</words>
I lifted my glass, the condensation having performed its sacred duty, and set it down with a wet click. <words>154</words>
This was my method, a talent so specific it was basically a cosmic clerical error: I read the future by reading the water rings on cheap furniture. <words>182</words>
Oh, the glorious dignity of my calling. <words>190</words>
The overlapping circles shimmered, showing me glimpses of cracked earth and acid tides, the predictable endgame of a species that worshipped consumption. <words>215</words>
It was all part of the grand plan for environmental stewardship that humanity had enthusiastically ignored for centuries. <words>234</words>
My job was to find the counter-argument, the one thread of hope in the tapestry of ruin. <words>251</words>
Success was, according to my own fraught divinations, probably unlikely. <words>261</words>
What a comfort. <words>264</words>
I leaned closer, trying to magnify the details, to force meaning from the meaningless patterns of moisture and wood grain. <words>285</words>
The rings blurred, a chaotic dance of despair, each one a locked door on that damnable box in my pocket. <words>305</words>
My heart hammered a frantic rhythm against my ribs, a drumbeat for the end of days. <words>321</words>
Just breathe, you panicked fraud. <words>326</words>
Another sarcastic thought for the pile. <words>331</words>
Then I saw it, not in the water itself, but in how a single droplet distorted the light over a knot in the wood. <words>354</words>
It wasn't a prophecy; it was a shape, a tiny, intricate spiral. <words>366</words>
The shape matched the etching on the first of the thirteen locks. <words>378</words>
A jolt, sharp and clean as lightning, cut through the fog of my anxiety. <words>392</words>
I pulled the puzzle box from my pocket, my thumb tracing the familiar, cold brass of the initial mechanism. <words>411</words>
It was a start. <words>414</words>
A fragile, absurd, infinitesimal start against a tidal wave of oblivion. <words>426</words>
But for the first time since I’d woken up in this neon wasteland, it felt like my own. <words>445</words>
