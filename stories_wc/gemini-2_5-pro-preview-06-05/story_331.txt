Elian, the garden’s sole caretaker, stood among the shimmering flora, a silent figure in a world long past the age of mountains. <words>21</words>
This was the quantum entanglement garden, where every leaf and petal was linked across space and time, a living network of possibilities. <words>42</words>
His purpose here was a quiet one, a sacred duty he felt with every fiber of his being: to preserve the fading spiritual practices of a forgotten age. <words>69</words>
He was, in his own way, honestly dishonest; he tended the plants, yes, but his true work was tending the future itself. <words>91</words>
A tremor of excited restraint ran through him as the twin suns dipped below the perfectly flat horizon. <words>109</words>
Dusk was the time of change. <words>115</words>
From a hidden alcove in a petrified, crystalline tree, he retrieved the forgotten music box. <words>131</words>
Its lacquered wood was smooth beneath his fingers, its brass key cool and potent with latent power. <words>149</words>
This was not a toy but a tool for inscription, for writing the future into the garden’s quantum foam. <words>168</words>
He needed to agitate the delicate balance of the present, to nudge probability toward a timeline of remembrance. <words>187</words>
His method was ancient and beautifully chaotic. <words>194</words>
As if on cue, a living shadow detached itself from the eaves of the conservatory, resolving into a swirling cloud of leather-winged bats. <words>220</words>
He watched their flight, his eyes tracing the impossibly complex patterns they wove against the violet sky. <words>239</words>
Each dip and swerve was a variable, a stochastic note in a symphony only he could hear. <words>257</words>
His fingers flew to the music box’s pins, setting them with deft, practiced clicks that mirrored the bats’ aerial dance. <words>279</words>
He was not controlling them, merely interpreting their freedom as a divine language. <words>293</words>
With the sequence set, he wound the key, his knuckles white with the pressure of his contained excitement. <words>312</words>
A melody, both strange and deeply familiar, chimed out from the box, a delicate thread of sound weaving through the entangled blossoms. <words>336</words>
The air thrummed, and the light from the ghost-ferns pulsed in time with the tune. <words>352</words>
The song was a prayer, a coded suggestion for reality to fold in a way that would allow an old mantra to be rediscovered, a lost meditation to be practiced again by souls yet to be born. <words>391</words>
As the last note faded, the bats vanished into the deepening twilight, their part in creation complete. <words>409</words>
Elian carefully placed the music box back in its hiding spot, his expression once again settling into the placid mask of a reserved caretaker. <words>434</words>
The garden was safe, and the future was, for now, singing a slightly different song. <words>449</words>
