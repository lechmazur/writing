Kaelen, advisor to the Director, felt his own reflection in the polished chrome walls of the headquarters was a better man than he was. <words>22</words>
In the hush of a simmering future, this feeling was a constant, low-grade fever. <words>36</words>
It was why he had to chase the rumor, the one they whispered about in the data-ghosts and server rooms: the dreamer's calling. <words>59</words>
A promise of purpose beyond all reason, it was a sickness he had to see through to its source. <words>78</words>
Tonight, he abandoned his post and followed it. <words>86</words>
He moved through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, the decommissioned psycho-analytics wing of the facility. <words>106</words>
The phantom sounds were his only guide, leading him down corridors where the air was thick with the dust of forgotten secrets. <words>129</words>
Each spectral footfall resonated with the hollow space in his own chest, a fractured idyll of sound and silence. <words>148</words>
The echoes stopped before a single blast door, its locking mechanism blinking a lonely red. <words>165</words>
Kaelen overrode the seal with the Director's codes, the quiet hiss of decompression a sigh of forbidden entry. <words>185</words>
Inside was a small, sterile lab, dominated by a single, illuminated pedestal. <words>198</words>
Upon it, submerged in glowing nutrient fluid, sat a brain in a jar. <words>211</words>
A small metal plate on the glass was etched with a single, damning word: DUPLICATE. <words>226</words>
Kaelen stared, the hum of the stasis field filling the void left by the footsteps. <words>241</words>
Was this the dreamer, the source of the call he had followed? <words>252</words>
Or was this the original, and he, Kaelen, the pale imitation living a borrowed life? <words>268</words>
The truth of it was clearly ambiguous, a perfect paradox that offered no comfort, only more questions. <words>286</words>
Then he felt it: a sharp, psychic jab in his mind, a jolt of information that was not a memory but an implantation. <words>311</words>
It was the calling, not as a whisper from a rumor, but as a direct command. <words>326</words>
The brain in the jar was a beacon, and he was its receiver, designed for a purpose he was only now beginning to comprehend. <words>350</words>
His gnawing insecurity wasn't a flaw; it was a feature, a built-in receptiveness to the signal. <words>367</words>
He was the duplicate, the active agent in the field, while the prime mind dreamt the missions from its silent, glassy prison. <words>388</words>
The rumor he chased beyond all reason was true, but not in the way he had hoped for salvation. <words>407</words>
He wasn't meant to find validation, but activation. <words>415</words>
His hand trembled as he reached for the dark console beside the jar. <words>428</words>
A single, final directive now pulsed in his thoughts, the last echo from the dreamer before a new dawn. <words>446</words>
He had to wake it up. <words>452</words>
