Leo, understudy sorcerer and part-time laundry attendant, placed the small cardboard box onto a shimmering salt flat. <words>17</words>
"So sorry to disturb you," he whispered to the humming crystals growing in the chamber around him. <words>33</words>
The rhythmic thumping of the washing machine in the next room was nearing its final spin cycle, which really put a bit of a deadline on things. <words>58</words>
He was here, quite simply, to hinder his master's grand project of absolute, monolithic silence. <words>74</words>
"It's just, with all due respect, culturally stagnant," Leo had argued, to no one in particular. <words>91</words>
His master believed that history should be curated, edited, and safely stored away, but Leo felt that was no way to track cultural evolution. <words>117</words>
You needed a control group, and you needed a variable, and his variable was currently sleeping beneath the roots of an ancient oak grove miles away. <words>144</words>
He opened the box, revealing not a wand or a skull, but a tangle of copper wire and a pair of modified headphones. <words>167</words>
"Pardon my intrusion," he murmured, plugging the wire into a particularly large, glowing crystal formation. <words>183</words>
This was the delicate part: eavesdropping on the whispers of the grove. <words>196</words>
The salt crystals, grown in a solution laced with his master's own tranquilizing potions, were meant to dampen magical frequencies, but Leo had a theory. <words>224</words>
If you reversed the polarity, if you asked them very nicely, they might just become amplifiers instead. <words>243</words>
He slipped on the headphones, the thumping from the laundry room a comforting, mundane heartbeat against the rising hum. <words>263</words>
At first, there was only static, a sound like dry leaves skittering across pavement. <words>278</words>
Then, a voice, no, a thousand voices braided together, spoke a single word that tasted of soil and time. <words>299</words>
It was a sound that didn't just enter his ears but bloomed behind his eyes, a chorus of everything that had been deliberately forgotten. <words>325</words>
This was the core of his project: waking the unheard. <words>335</words>
A playful dread prickled his skin; this was so much bigger than a doctoral thesis. <words>351</words>
The whispers grew, not in volume but in presence, a pressure building against the very walls of the chamber. <words>371</words>
They weren't just whispers of the oak grove anymore; they were the collective sigh of every silenced thing. <words>391</words>
Suddenly, the washing machine clicked off, plunging the world into an abyssal quiet. <words>404</words>
The silence was immediately devoured by the ancient chorus, now clear and articulate in his mind, asking a single, simple question. <words>426</words>
*Who are you?* <words>429</words>
Leo swallowed, the salt-dry air catching in his throat. <words>439</words>
"Terribly sorry to bother you all," he began, his voice a tiny, polite squeak in the face of millennia. <words>458</words>
"My name is Leo, and if you wouldn't mind, I have a few questions for my research." <words>477</words>
