Elias sat in the damp quiet of his water clock repair shop, the only sound the rhythmic drip of a dozen different sorrows counting time. <words>22</words>
His gaze rested on the old moss-covered lantern in the corner, its verdigris-stained bronze and clouded glass like a monument to forgotten secrets. <words>43</words>
Each new frond of moss represented another domestic mystery he had been paid to permanently and artfully solve. <words>61</words>
This latest one, a portly philandering husband with a disastrous penchant for romantic poetry, had been a particularly sublime tragedy. <words>82</words>
Elias picked up a silver-inlaid polishing cloth, a quietly flamboyant tool for a grimy profession, and began his private ritual. <words>103</words>
"Here lies Arthur Pumble," he murmured to the dripping darkness, "a man whose fidelity was as leaky as his upstairs plumbing." <words>126</words>
He swore eternal, breathless love to his wife, Beatrice, while composing dreadful sonnets to the baker's daughter on monogrammed napkins. <words>150</words>
A true connoisseur of deceit, our Arthur, who believed the greatest sin wasn't infidelity, but using the wrong fork for the fish course. <words>177</words>
Beatrice, bless her willfully oblivious soul, thought his late nights were spent wrestling with a great novel, a masterpiece in the making. <words>202</words>
In a way, she was correct; his life was a work of fiction, though more of a tragicomic pamphlet than an enduring epic. <words>227</words>
He paused his recitation, buffing a small brass gear until it shone with a lonely warmth the shop otherwise lacked. <words>247</words>
He didn't hate these people, not in the slightest. <words>256</words>
In his own strange and meticulous way, he had come to adore the intricate, grubby tapestries of their hidden lives. <words>278</words>
He adored the way their small, desperate secrets gleamed so perfectly when held up to the cold light of their demise. <words>301</words>
This was his art, the solemn duty he had assigned himself in this quiet intermission between chapters of a life he barely recognized. <words>328</words>
His purpose was to take their messy, excruciating pain and transmute it into a masterpiece of finality, a perfectly balanced and silent clock. <words>355</words>
These bleak eulogies, spoken only to the moss and the shadows, were the hidden truths that gave each ending its profound and necessary weight. <words>381</words>
"His last words, scribbled on a receipt for saffron buns, were 'Her eyes, like twin pools of... something'," Elias chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. <words>410</words>
"Rest in pieces, Arthur, you magnificent, hollow fraud." <words>419</words>
The eulogy was complete, another ugly story given a clean, if merciless, conclusion. <words>432</words>
He set the polished gear back into the delicate mechanism of a clepsydra shaped like a weeping angel, its tears marking the hours. <words>454</words>
The dripping resumed its steady, patient rhythm as he turned back to his workbench. <words>467</words>
Another masterpiece finished, another pain silenced forever. <words>475</words>
