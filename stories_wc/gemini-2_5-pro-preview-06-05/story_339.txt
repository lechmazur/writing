Elias, a performer whose applause had long since soured into an empty ringing, stood by the window of his home, watching the prismatic lake shimmer against the raw, skeletal frame of a new condominium. <words>31</words>
His life was a study in the modestly extravagant, filled with beautiful things that brought him no delight. <words>47</words>
From the empty playground below the construction site, a sound drifted up, a rhythmic, metallic cry that set his teeth on edge. <words>69</words>
It was the echo of a squeaking seesaw, and it was his cue to begin. <words>82</words>
He had to organize, to impose a quiet order on the chaos that churned inside him, a desperate need to hush the dissonance of old guilt. <words>107</words>
His hand went to a chest of drawers, fingers tracing the cool, unassuming brass of a simple drawer knob. <words>126</words>
Inside were the artifacts of his two lives, the carefully curated evidence of two opposing truths. <words>142</words>
One truth painted him the hero of that night, the one who tried to save her; the other, a coward who ran. <words>164</words>
The seesaw’s lonely squeak-squawk became the metronome for his torment, one note for his valor, the next for his shame. <words>186</words>
He pulled the drawer open, a small act of cautious abandon, the scent of old paper and dried flowers rising to meet him. <words>208</words>
He began to sort the photographs and letters, his movements dictated by the haunting cadence from the playground. <words>227</words>
This pile for the brave man she thought he was, that pile for the frightened boy he knew himself to be. <words>248</words>
The light from the prismatic lake fractured across the floorboards, casting shifting, unreliable colors over everything. <words>265</words>
He picked up a single, faded ticket stub, the cornerstone of the lie he had performed for years. <words>283</words>
Was his greatest performance the one on stage, or the one he lived every day? <words>297</words>
The construction hammers pounded in the distance, a brutal counterpoint to the seesaw’s ghostly lament. <words>313</words>
He was so tired of being torn, of the seesaw in his soul that never touched the ground. <words>332</words>
With a breath that felt like shattering glass, he took the pile representing the coward and placed it squarely on top of the pile representing the hero. <words>361</words>
He would not choose one truth over the other; he would organize them into a single, complex, and agonizing story. <words>382</words>
It was not forgiveness, not yet, but it was a kind of order, a way to contain the fracture. <words>401</words>
He closed the drawer, his hand resting on the simple knob, feeling its solid, unremarkable reality beneath his palm. <words>421</words>
The squeaking from the playground continued, but now it sounded less like an accusation and more like a slow, steady heartbeat. <words>442</words>
Outside, the builders were laying a new foundation, and for the first time, Elias felt the ground beneath his own feet might just hold. <words>466</words>
