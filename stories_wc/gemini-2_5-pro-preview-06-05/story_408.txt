Elias, who had once refused a rifle for king and country, now commanded a far more effective army from his porch. <20>
His soldiers were the gnarled apple trees of the hanging orchard, their roots clawing into the ravine walls, their branches battered into watchful shapes by the ceaseless storms. <49>
He called it his neighborhood watch, a charmingly folksy name for a surveillance network that stretched for hundreds of miles. <70>
His xenial smile, offered to the rare lost hiker, was his uniform now, a disarming piece of camouflage. <88>
They saw a gentle soul, a conscientious objector who had traded the battlefield for a quiet life of horticulture and craft. <109>
This persona was his greatest weapon, allowing him to pursue his true and solemn motivation: to map the migration routes of those who, like him, had once refused to fight. <142>
His theater of operations was the regional circuit of autumn craft fairs, a tour he undertook with a look of valiant boredom. <165>
He explained it as a family tradition, a pilgrimage tied to the forgotten holiday of Saint Jude’s Passage, when his ancestors honored travelers. <191>
At his stall, nestled between potters and weavers, he sold hand-carved finches and displayed them on a weathered plank of orchard wood. <216>
To hang each new carving, he used an old, rusty nail he’d pulled from a storm-felled branch, its tetanus-kissed point a small, private joke. <243>
A young man with a familiar, haunted look in his eyes lingered one afternoon, asking about the different woods Elias used. <266>
"This one is from the high ridge," Elias said, his voice warm as he tapped a dark, dense bird. <284>
"And this one," he added, picking up the rusty nail, "is from the shadowed part of the ravine, where things don't get much sun." <309>
He held the nail's sharp tip poised over the plank, his friendly gaze unwavering, letting the quiet threat hang in the air between the scent of cinnamon and sawdust. <339>
The young man’s face paled with a sudden, dawning understanding before he nodded curtly and vanished into the crowd. <360>
Elias felt a familiar, hollow victory. <366>
Back in his cabin, the wind howling through the ravine like a mournful predator, he unrolled his masterwork. <385>
It was a vast map, crisscrossed with pencil lines that marked the secret paths of deserters, draft dodgers, and political refugees. <409>
The family tradition was real, but it wasn't about honoring travelers; it was about hunting them for the state that had once branded him a coward. <438>
He picked up the rusty nail from his tool tray, its purpose now clear. <452>
With the precise, steady hand of a soldier after all, he pressed the nail into the map, pinning the location of the young man from the fair. <481>
Another migrant successfully tagged for the coming harvest. <490>
