The sellsword, Kael, chuckled as iridescent thorns snagged his leather tunic, the sound a strange, dry rustle in his changing throat. <words>20</words>
He was, he decided, a picture of boldly reluctant purpose, wading through a witch’s herb garden where the flora hummed with elegant mayhem. <words>43</words>
Each step was an effort, not of will, but of flesh, as the withering vow he’d sworn to a forgotten god turned his skin to something like silver birch. <words>73</words>
His quest was for a treasure, one fabled to halt any curse, and he would not falter now, not when the transformation was so near its terrible, final artistry. <words>104</words>
He sought it to dethrone the insidious doubt that had plagued him since the vow first began to sour, a creeping suspicion that he was unworthy of salvation. <words>136</words>
The witch, a creature of peculiar habits, had supposedly hidden her prize according to a bizarre method she’d learned from a mortal lineage: a family tradition of making a time capsule. <words>171</words>
Kael’s laugh, weaker this time, scraped past his lips as he spotted it: a patch of earth too perfectly bare beneath a canopy of weeping star-blossoms. <words>201</words>
He dug with hands that were becoming more root than bone, the garden sighing around him as if in anticipation of his failure. <words>228</words>
The unearthed chest was not filled with gleaming potions or enchanted scrolls, but instead held a single, magnificent object: a brass astronomical telescope. <words>256</words>
Confusion warred with the creeping paralysis in his limbs; what use were the distant, cold stars to a man turning into a tree? <words>283</words>
Yet, compelled by the last vestiges of his desperate hope, he lifted the heavy instrument, his bark-like fingers fumbling with the focus wheel. <words>312</words>
He pointed it not at the moon, but towards a shimmering nebula the garden’s strange atmosphere made visible, a place his vow had commanded him to one day cleanse. <words>344</words>
Through the lens, he saw no blight to be purged, but a glorious, stellar nursery where new suns were being born in a silent, chaotic ballet. <words>373</words>
The vow had not been a command to heal a sickness, but a promise to bear witness to a creation he could never comprehend. <words>401</words>
The doubt in his mind did not shatter; it simply dissolved, replaced by an awesome, terrifying clarity. <words>419</words>
His feet took permanent root in the witch’s soil, the transformation completing itself not as an ending, but as a planting. <words>444</words>
He was no longer a sellsword, but a silent, jovial sentinel in a garden of elegant mayhem, his consciousness forever aimed at the stars. <words>471</words>
His treasure was the truth, and his eternity was the view. <words>483</words>
