Alistair decided to walk instead of drive, not out of some newfound love for pedestrianism, but because the last of the Finchley-Potts fortune had evaporated into petrol fumes and parking tickets years ago. <words>32</words>
His legacy's burden was a physical weight in his threadbare coat pocket: a single, brittle botanical illustration of the Moon-Petal Orchid, the key to his family's fabled alchemical recipes. <words>67</words>
His destination loomed ahead, a skeletal silhouette against the bruised twilightâ€”the abandoned "Ghastly Galleon" roller coaster, a place rumored to exist between parallel paths. <words>99</words>
The park gates groaned open under his touch, their rusted protest echoing in the unnatural quiet of a place built for screams. <words>122</words>
He bypassed the skeletal remains of concession stands and climbed into the lead car of the coaster, its vinyl seat cracked like dried leather. <words>147</words>
This haunted ride was the only machine capable of generating the specific resonant frequency needed to glimpse the world where his ancestors had not been fools, but masters. <words>179</words>
With a shuddering lurch, the chain-lift engaged, pulling him into the deepening gloom with a rhythmic, metallic heartbeat. <words>201</words>
As the car crested the first hill, the world did not drop away but folded inward, the familiar laws of physics becoming suggestions rather than rules. <words>232</words>
This was the in-between space, a realistically odd dimension where the air tasted of ozone and forgotten candy floss, and the wooden track ahead glowed with a faint, internal phosphorescence. <words>269</words>
The wind rushing past his ears was not a single sound but a chorus of whispers, the spectral advice of his entire lineage urging him on. <words>298</words>
He pulled out the delicate drawing, its lines sharp and perfect against the swirling, indistinct chaos around him. <words>321</words>
To learn the secret recipes, he had to harmonize, to match the frantic vibration of his own desperate hope with the coaster's ghostly rhythm and the silent, potent energy of the illustrated flower. <words>361</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the image in his mind, and began to hum, a low, wavering note that sought to find its place in the discordant symphony of the void. <words>398</words>
For a breathtaking moment, everything locked into a state of blurry vividness; the scent of the Moon-Petal Orchid filled his lungs, and the complex formulas for its use bloomed behind his eyes like ghost-fire. <words>441</words>
Then the coaster plunged back into his own reality, the sudden gravity a brutal shock as it slammed him back into his seat. <words>467</words>
Stumbling from the ride, Alistair clutched the precious, impossible knowledge in his mind, the weight of his legacy no longer just a burden, but a terrifying and magnificent command. <words>500</words>
