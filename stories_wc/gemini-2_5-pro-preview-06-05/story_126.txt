Kaelen stood on the space station observation deck, a place of silent worship for a god that died after the last tree falls. <words>22</words>
He was a shipwrecked merchant in all but name, his cargo vessel disabled decades ago, leaving him marooned with his relics and his resentment. <words>45</words>
A quiet fury simmered beneath his calm exterior, a singular motivation to shatter the grand illusion projected before them all. <words>66</words>
The deck was a ghost station within a station, its purpose obsolete, yet it maintained the lie with a floor-to-ceiling view of a verdant, impossible Earth. <words>95</words>
Beside him rested the centerpiece of his plan: a rustic butter churn salvaged from a terrestrial ruin. <words>113</words>
Its oaken, hand-carved presence was honestly strange here, a splinter of tactile reality in a universe of sterile light and holographic deceit. <words>139</words>
His gaze shifted to an adjacent wall, where an ancient travel poster advertised alpine meadows under a sky of impossible blue. <words>162</words>
Its surface was brittle, its corners peeling away from the bulkhead like sunburnt skin. <words>178</words>
These frayed imperfections were not a flaw but an invitation, the first of the rebellious sparks he intended to fan into a fire. <words>203</words>
With an air of aloof passion, he hoisted the heavy churn, its wooden dasher feeling like a scepter in his hands. <words>225</words>
The other observers, lost in their placid contemplation, barely registered his movement as he approached the wall. <words>244</words>
He began to ascend, his fingers finding purchase in the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station. <words>266</words>
His boots found holds on a service conduit and then the frame of the poster itself, lifting him level with the main viewport's central projector. <words>295</words>
He felt no triumph, only the cold necessity of the moment as he swung the churn with all his might. <words>317</words>
The heavy oak slammed into the projector housing, and the illusion of a living Earth did not just vanishâ€”it fractured into a million screaming pixels. <words>346</words>
A collective gasp echoed through the chamber as the simulation died, replaced by the true view. <words>364</words>
There it was: the silent, brown sphere, scarred and lifeless, hanging in the unforgiving void. <words>381</words>
Kaelen lowered the churn, his work complete, the silence now filled with the terrifying weight of truth. <words>400</words>
The sparks had been struck, and now they would either be smothered by fear or catch upon the dry tinder of long-dormant souls. <words>426</words>
He did not care which, for he had honored the dead by killing their ghost. <words>442</words>
