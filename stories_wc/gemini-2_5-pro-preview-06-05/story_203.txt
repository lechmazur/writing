Elias’s hands trembled as he clicked a plastic limb into the torso of a toy star-sailor, the silence of his orbital debris-scavenged workshop amplifying the frantic beat of his own heart. <words>29</words>
This was never usual, this work, especially not when the ghost was his own great-grandmother, a specter born from a century-old inheritance of lies. <words>54</words>
She had told everyone she’d died on a green Earth, not in the cold vacuum where she’d been exiled. <words>73</words>
He glanced at the only authentic thing his family owned: a small acrylic frame holding pressed wildflowers from a world none of them had ever truly seen. <words>101</words>
His throat tightened, the familiar paralysis of stage fright creeping in, because he wasn't just an engineer, he was the family’s reluctant exorcist. <words>128</words>
The entity fed on performance, on an audience, and his fear was a feast. <words>142</words>
But his daughter, sleeping in the sealed cabin next door, deserved a future free from the phantoms of the past. <words>163</words>
He was here to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” the word that had haunted his bloodline for generations. <words>185</words>
The lie had given the spirit its anchor, a festering wound in their history, and tonight he would finally close it. <words>206</words>
A defiant hush settled over him as he stood, leaving the half-assembled toy on his workbench. <words>222</words>
He placed the frame of wildflowers next to a basin of reclaimed water, its surface shivering with the station’s gentle vibrations. <words>244</words>
The ritual was a heresy of his own design, pieced together from fragmented data logs and desperate hope. <words>263</words>
He needed to confront the lie with the truth, the cold of space with the memory of a sun-warmed field. <words>284</words>
Taking a steadying breath, he activated the audio file he’d salvaged from his great-grandmother’s personal effects. <words>302</words>
The sound of a key turning in a lock echoed through the small workshop, a crisp, metallic noise that belonged to a different time and place. <words>330</words>
A sudden chill dropped the temperature by twenty degrees, and a shimmering distortion coalesced over the water basin, its form vague but its disappointment palpable. <words>357</words>
Her whisper slithered through the comms, a static hiss of "You were supposed to believe." <words>373</words>
His voice was a choked rasp, but it was his. <words>383</words>
"We were supposed to be free," he countered, his words a small rebellion against the crushing silence. <words>399</words>
With a final, resolute movement, he took the frame and pushed it under the water’s surface. <words>415</words>
He would submerge the beautiful lie in the harsh, recycled truth of their existence. <words>430</words>
The shimmering form convulsed, then dissipated with a sound like breaking glass. <words>442</words>
The cold receded. <words>445</words>
Elias stood panting in the quiet, his reflection staring back from the still water, before he turned and picked up the toy, ready to finish his work. <words>473</words>
