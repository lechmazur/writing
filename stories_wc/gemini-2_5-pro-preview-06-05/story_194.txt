Finn, a lumberjack whose spirit was too large for the forests he felled, now moved with a gracefully awkward energy between the bone-lined walls of The Ossuary. <26>
This gourmet restaurant, built into the hollowed-out catacombs, was his strange new sanctuary. <38>
His motivation was singular: to learn the old healing traditions from the owner, a woman whose kindness was a form of harsh tenderness. <59>
She saw the calluses on his hands not as a flaw but as a foundation. <73>
He was trying to revamp his entire existence, trading his axe for a pestle and mortar. <87>
The change began throughout his nightly bike rides, long, punishing journeys that were meant to quiet his mind. <105>
But lately, they had become the stage for reawakened nightmares, vivid flashes of a world aflame. <121>
It started after he found the letter tucked into the frame of a salvaged bicycle. <135>
It was a coded letter from a future war, though he didn't know that yet; he only knew its strange symbols pulsed in his dreams. <157>
The nightmares showed him screaming metal and shattered cities, but also moments of impossible mending, of flesh re-knitting itself under glowing hands. <179>
He’d wake up gasping, the scent of ozone and antiseptic herbs filling his small apartment. <194>
At the restaurant, the owner’s lessons grew more intense, her voice a low rasp as she taught him about nerve clusters and cellular memory. <216>
"A clean cut is easier to heal," she'd say, pressing a dangerously sharp knife into his palm, "but a shattered bone teaches you about true reconstruction." <241>
Her lessons felt less like herbalism and more like basic training for a conflict he couldn't comprehend. <257>
The hidden agendas began to surface during one grueling bike ride, his legs burning as he pedaled against a brutal headwind. <277>
A nightmare fragment broke through his exhaustion: he saw his own hands, older and scarred, tracing the exact symbols from the letter onto a wounded soldier's skin. <304>
The symbols glowed, and the wound sealed. <311>
He skidded to a halt, the bike clattering onto the pavement. <321>
The healing traditions weren't about poultices for loggers' cuts; they were about battlefield medicine for a time yet to come. <341>
He confronted her that night, the coded letter laid out on a prep table between them, its characters stark against the stainless steel. <363>
"This," he said, his voice rough, "this is what you're really teaching me, isn't it?" <377>
The owner picked up the letter, her touch surprisingly gentle on the strange paper. <390>
"I am trying to revamp you, Finn," she admitted, her gaze unwavering and severe, "because where you are going, there is no room for awkwardness, only grace under fire." <418>
"The nightmares are memories," she continued, a profound sadness in her harsh tone, "and my agenda is simple: to make sure you survive them the second time." <444>
