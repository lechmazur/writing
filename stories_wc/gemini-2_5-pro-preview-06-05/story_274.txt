The final key struck the ribbon with a sound of exhausted finality. <words>12</words>
From my ceramic pot, I watched the Writer slump away from the worn typewriter, leaving the last page exposed to the stale air. <words>32</words>
For years I had been apathetically devoted to him, a silent, leafy witness tending to the unspoken agonies of his work. <words>53</words>
My care was a passive thing, absorbing the carbon dioxide of his sighs and offering oxygen he never consciously valued. <words>74</words>
But tonight, the silence was not empty; it was a vacuum demanding to be filled. <words>89</words>
His embroidered bookmark, a gift from someone long gone, lay beside the manuscript, its stitched-in raven a stark, black question. <words>112</words>
That raven was the sigil for a place he had only ever described in frustrated, deleted drafts, a place of hidden knowledge he could never quite capture in words. <words>144</words>
A spontaneous decision, hot and reckless, bloomed in my xylem: I had to go there. <words>160</words>
I had to find what he could not. <words>169</words>
With a groan of terracotta and a wrenching of roots from soil, I pulled myself free from the windowsill that had been my entire world. <words>196</words>
My pot scraped against the floorboards as I began to move, a clumsy, desperate pilgrimage. <words>212</words>
I had to outrun the morning, outrun the moment he would return to find his quiet companion gone. <words>232</words>
The cool night air was a shock as I tumbled from the porch into a new neighborhood, a sprawling map of sleeping houses and whispering trees. <words>259</words>
Each flickering streetlight was a hostile sun, each gust of wind a threat to my fragile leaves. <words>278</words>
My journey was fueled by a scalding ambivalence; a deep, rooted need to understand coupled with a profound indifference to whether I survived the discovery. <words>308</words>
Finally, I saw it, just as his discarded pages had described: the skeletal frame of an abandoned drive-in. <words>328</words>
The giant screen loomed over the cracked asphalt, a tombstone for a million forgotten endings. <words>344</words>
I scuttled to its base, my pot clattering to a halt in the profound quiet. <words>360</words>
Here, in this cathedral of decay, was the hidden knowledge he sought. <words>373</words>
It was not written in any book or etched onto the screen. <words>385</words>
It was in the feeling of being utterly alone and completely connected to every story that had ever ended here. <words>405</words>
It was the wisdom of the unspoken, the understanding that some things are only true when they are left unwritten. <words>426</words>
I tipped my pot, spilling my roots into a fissure in the pavement, and began to settle. <words>444</words>
My devotion had found a new, apathetic home, tending now to the silence itself. <words>459</words>
