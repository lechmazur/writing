Dr. Alistair Finch sat on the velvet lip of a submerged orchestra pit, the scent of vanilla and caramel from the annual Complacency Cake baking upstairs a cloying sweetness in the damp air. <words>31</words>
Flickering lanterns cast long, dancing shadows across the flooded opera house, their light glinting off the water that now filled the stalls where an audience once sat. <words>61</words>
He was a reticent scholar, more comfortable with the dead languages of artifacts than the living drone of the party above. <words>83</words>
His motivation was simple, a quiet rebellion he had nurtured for years: to dethrone complacency itself. <words>101</words>
Before him, resting on a marble balustrade just above the water's surface, was the ancient clay tablet. <words>119</words>
Its runes, which he had finally translated, promised not power or riches, but a gathering of echoes. <words>136</words>
A resonance that could shake the foundations of a world too comfortable in its beautiful decay. <words>152</words>
From his satchel, Alistair produced a worn, vintage dictionary, its leather cover soft with age. <words>168</words>
He didn't open it to a definition, but instead carefully peeled back the binding. <words>183</words>
Tucked within were his own sketches, precise and technically mischievous diagrams mapping the opera house's acoustics. <words>201</words>
His method was not to shout, but to orchestrate. <words>210</words>
Following his own hidden notes, he waded quietly through the cool water, adjusting the positions of three specific lanterns. <words>231</words>
He angled one to reflect off a gilded cherub, another to skim the water's surface, and the last to shine directly onto the tablet. <words>256</words>
The air grew taut, the light and faint hum of the lanterns focusing into a single, coherent frequency. <words>275</words>
The runes on the clay began to pulse with a soft, internal luminescence. <words>289</words>
Then came the knock. <words>293</words>
It was not the sound of a fist on wood, but a deep, resonant percussion that seemed to emanate from the very dome of the hall, from the water, from the air itself. <words>328</words>
The knock echoed, then answered itself, a cascade of spectral impacts filling the space. <words>344</words>
Upstairs, the cheerful music stuttered and died. <words>351</words>
The self-satisfied chatter ceased, replaced by a sudden, sharp silence. <words>362</words>
Someone had answered the silence with a question, their voice thin and uncertain. <words>376</words>
Alistair watched the concentric ripples spread from the base of the tablet, a small, secret smile touching his lips. <words>397</words>
The gathering of echoes had served its notice. <words>406</words>
A feeling of pensive mirth settled over him as the profound quiet held, a fragile, perfect thing born from a single, well-placed knock. <words>432</words>
