Lord Alistair Finchley considered the wilting petunias with the sort of grave disappointment one usually reserves for a poorly executed coup d'etat. <words>21</words> It was, after all, his duty to maintain the manor's grounds, just as it was his duty to ignore the humming, clanking sounds emanating from the "wine cellar" he leased to some frightfully serious people from the Ministry. <words>58</words> He was, by nature and breeding, a profoundly submissive man, better suited to nodding agreeably than to actual conflict. <words>78</words> While snipping a dead rose head near a ventilation grate, a peculiar echo chamber effect carried voices up from the workshop below. <words>101</words> "The asset is a liability," a clipped voice said, "Protocol requires neutralization before it imprints on anything else." <words>121</words> Another voice, weary and flat, added, "Just a shame; its mimicry was almost perfect." <words>134</words> Alistair, whose perception was so unusually sharp it was often a social burden, understood instantly they weren't discussing a faulty gadget. <words>156</words> He had seen the "asset" once: a small, silver-furred creature with eyes like liquid mercury, designed for espionage and now destined for disposal. <words>181</words> A wave of silent empathy washed over him; he knew what it was to be a decorative thing whose purpose had expired. <words>205</words> His motivation was suddenly, shockingly clear: he had to protect this vulnerable creature from his tenants. <words>222</words> "Oh, bother," he murmured to a particularly judgmental-looking garden gnome, "one supposes one must intervene." <words>238</words> He pocketed the dull silver letter opener from his gardening apron, a flimsy totem of his own gilded cage. <words>257</words> Strolling into the sterile white workshop, he adopted his most vacuous smile. <words>270</words> "So sorry to interrupt your… inventory," he chirped, spotting the silver creature huddled in a glass cage, a syringe of clear fluid on the counter beside it. <words>299</words> The two agents exchanged a look of profound annoyance. <words>308</words> "My lord," the first one began, "this is not a good time." <words>319</words> "Quite, quite," Alistair agreed, drifting closer to a rack of unlabeled chemical canisters. <words>332</words> "I was just wondering about the begonias, they seem to be suffering from a frightful malaise and I thought perhaps your… scientific minds…" <words>356</words> As he spoke, his hand, seemingly by accident, tipped a large beaker of viscous, amber fluid. <words>372</words> The beaker's contents splashed across the cage's electronic lock mechanism and the table holding the syringe. <words>388</words> With a horrifying hiss, the advanced polymer console began to smoke and liquify, dripping onto the floor in sizzling puddles. <words>409</words> Amid the ensuing panic and acrid fumes, the damaged lock sparked and gave way. <words>423</words> A silver blur shot out of the open cage and vanished through the door Alistair had so thoughtfully left ajar. <words>442</words> "Good heavens!" Alistair cried with practiced horror, "I am so dreadfully clumsy, you must put it on my bill!" <words>461</words> Later that evening, from his balcony, he saw a flash of silver dart into the safety of the deep woods, and for the first time in a long while, felt perfectly, quietly useful. <words>495</words>
