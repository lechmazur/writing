The nutrient-paste dispenser whirred, its monotonous drone the only soundtrack to story time on Agri-Unit 7. <17>
Silas sat on the cold polymer floor, tracing the sharp edges of an empty tape dispenser he’d kept for no good reason. <35>
The Overseer’s voice droned on about collective crop yields, a tale meant to soothe, but Silas was busy. <52>
He was busy because the ghosts were back. <60>
They stood among the rows of gray-clad workers, their forms flickering but unusually normal, like smudges on a clean window. <79>
There was the baker from Sector Gamma, still dusted with phantom flour, and the woman who’d sold him the faulty grav-lift pass. <99>
He’d conned them both, small grifts for small gains, yet seeing them here always stirred the quiet, persistent lull of remorse in his gut. <124>
His defiance, his need to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin even in this sterile purgatory, demanded he do something more than just watch. <149>
So, with a mild fervor burning behind his placid expression, he began his work. <163>
*Was it worth it?* he projected towards the baker, a silent interrogation honed by years of reading marks. <180>
The apparition simply stared ahead, his spectral eyes fixed on the far wall where the production quotas were displayed. <199>
No accusation, no anger, just an unnerving, vacant acceptance. <208>
Silas shifted his focus to the woman, the architect of his current predicament. <221>
*You knew the pass was a dud, didn't you?* <230>
*You sold me out to the Enforcers for a week's extra rations.* <242>
Her ghostly form turned slightly, her mouth opening as if to speak, but only the Overseer’s words filled the air. <261>
This was his method, his strange ritual to comfort the ache inside him. <274>
He couldn't change the past, but he could face its echoes, question them, and strip them of their power over him. <295>
He wasn't seeking forgiveness, but a kind of shared understanding with these silent specters of his own making. <314>
The woman’s apparition shimmered, her expression softening into something that looked like pity, or perhaps just resignation. <332>
It was enough. <335>
That flicker of connection, of shared defeat, was a strange comfort. <345>
He squeezed the useless plastic dispenser in his hand, its hollowness a perfect mirror for the moment. <361>
The Overseer’s voice finally stopped, signaling the end of story time. <372>
As the workers rose, the apparitions dissolved back into the recycled air. <384>
Silas stood with them, a faint, genuine smile touching his lips for the first time all week. <401>
He had faced his ghosts and found not terror, but a quiet, shared normalcy in their haunting. <417>
He was still trapped, still a number in a dystopian machine, but he had his tiny, secret rebellion. <434>
In this place designed to crush the soul, he had found a way to interrogate his own, and in doing so, had managed to grin. <456>
