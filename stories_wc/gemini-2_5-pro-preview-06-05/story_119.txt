The revelation struck like lightning, a jagged truth learned moments ago while his spirit soared miles away: they knew. <words>18</words>
His physical form snapped back to the rusted apex of the roller coaster track, the world a dizzying rush of peeling paint and vertigo. <words>39</words>
There was no time for thought, only for the ingrained protocols of survival he had honed for just this moment. <words>58</words>
He had to flee. <words>62</words>
His fingers tightened around the antique brass key in his pocket, its familiar weight a grounding anchor against the panic that threatened to bloom. <words>86</words>
This key, a relic from the person he'd sworn to protect, was the very reason he maintained this life of constant readiness. <words>109</words>
His motivation was simple: to preserve the survival skills that kept them both safe. <words>123</words>
With a practiced spontaneity that looked like reckless abandon, he launched himself into a controlled slide down the steep curve of the track. <words>146</words>
He didn't look back; he didn't need to. <words>155</words>
Instead, he began tracking the sun shadows, using the long, dark fingers of the support beams splayed across the overgrown grounds to chart a path unseen from below. <words>186</words>
It was a method he trusted implicitly, a silent language between him and the light. <words>201</words>
Leaping from the track's end to the faded roof of a ticket booth, he risked a glance downward. <words>219</words>
Two figures emerged from the woods, their movements clumsy and loud in the carnival's graveyard quiet. <words>235</words>
One of them, younger than the other, stumbled near a collapsed section of the boardwalk, his ankle twisting awkwardly. <words>254</words>
A pained cry was swallowed by the oppressive silence. <words>262</words>
Kael froze, his escape momentarily forgotten. <words>268</words>
It was a foolish impulse, this unyielding compassion for any suffering creature, even one who hunted him. <words>285</words>
It was the part of him that was sometimes a weakness, but always his truth. <words>299</words>
He nudged a loose piece of metal siding with his foot. <words>309</words>
It clattered down, landing several feet away from the injured man, drawing his partner's attention to the safer, more stable ground. <words>331</words>
The distraction was a risk, a deviation from the plan, but it was a necessary one. <words>346</words>
He was a secret astral projector, a ghost in the machine of the world, but his humanity remained stubbornly corporeal. <words>366</words>
The older pursuer helped his companion up, their focus shifted for a precious few seconds. <words>381</words>
It was all the time Kael needed. <words>388</words>
He dropped into the shadow of the funhouse, the brass key now a warm promise in his palm, and vanished into the labyrinth of forgotten laughter and decay. <words>417</words>
