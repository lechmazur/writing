Elara had always treated the garage as a sealed tomb, a place where the laws of physics went to grieve alongside her. <words>20</words>
Today, however, she was determined to clean it out, a self-imposed penance to transform the gnawing fear in her gut into something resembling courage. <words>44</words>
Inside, the gravitational anomaly her parents had studied made the task a slow, surreal dance. <words>59</words>
Dust motes refused to settle, hovering in shimmering, weightless clouds, and a stray hammer drifted lazily past her head like a metallic ghost. <words>83</words>
She had to adapt or perish, a mantra that applied as much to the floating debris as it did to the suffocating loneliness of being an orphan. <words>111</words>
Her movements were careful, her expression a mask of the aloof detachment she had perfected over the years. <words>129</words>
From a dust-caked crate, she retrieved her mother’s collection of smooth stones, each one a perfect, polished worry. <words>149</words>
As a wave of low gravity rippled through the space, the stones became softly audible, emitting a low, resonant hum that vibrated through her palms. <words>178</words>
The sound was a familiar comfort, a steadying anchor in the unpredictable currents of the room and her memories. <words>198</words>
She worked for hours, sorting through boxes of forgotten research and faded photographs, the hum of the stones her only companion. <words>222</words>
Then, tucked inside a worn leather-bound journal, she found it: an old, unscratched lottery ticket. <words>239</words>
It wasn't the numbers on the front that held her captive, but the cryptic message scrawled on the back in her father’s familiar script. <words>265</words>
"The pull is only as strong as your fear," it read. <words>276</words>
"Adapt to the drift. <words>280</words>
Loosen your grip." <words>284</words>
The words hung in the air, more tangible than the floating screwdriver beside her. <words>298</words>
She looked at the chaos around her, at the gentle, aimless waltz of forgotten things, and finally understood. <words>318</words>
Her parents hadn't been trapped by this place; they had been fascinated, learning to move within its strange embrace. <words>338</words>
They had adapted. <words>341</words>
All this time, she had been fighting the anomaly, bracing against its shifts, holding onto her grief with a white-knuckled desperation. <words>365</words>
She had to loosen her hold not just on the past, but on the rigid control she exerted over herself. <words>386</words>
Taking a deep breath that felt strangely light in her chest, Elara unclenched her fists. <words>400</words>
She let one of the humming stones lift from her palm, watching it float away to join the silent, swirling ballet of the garage. <words>425</words>
A genuine, unburdened smile touched her lips as she continued her work, no longer fighting the tide but flowing with it, a quiet observer of her own becoming. <words>454</words>
