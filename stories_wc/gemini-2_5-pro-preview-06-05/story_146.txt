Elara, a faux fortune teller plagued by unwelcome, genuine visions, had arrived in the new city just as the planting season began. <words>21</words>
Her stated purpose was academic, a desire to study sacred development by tracing the roots of forgotten faiths. <words>39</words>
It was a pilgrimage she undertook regularly seldom, a ritualized break from the charade of her daily life. <words>58</words>
She believed the best discoveries came from taken chances, so her primary method was to simply explore. <words>76</words>
This time, getting lost in a new city and discovering a hidden gem was the specific chance she embraced. <words>96</words>
Down a cobblestone alley that smelled of rain and old paper, she found it: an extinct language archive. <words>115</words>
Dust motes danced in the slivers of light, illuminating shelves of silent, leather-bound books filled with dead words. <words>135</words>
In a glass case, nestled on velvet, lay a bone flute discovered in a crypt. <words>151</words>
Its polished surface, carved from what looked like a human femur, seemed to hum with a latent energy. <words>170</words>
She convinced the sleepy curator to let her hold it, a request granted with a weary shrug. <words>188</words>
The moment her fingers touched the cold bone, a vision fractured her reality. <words>201</words>
She saw ancient people playing the flute throughout planting, their music not a melody but a prayer that guided the seeds' growth. <words>226</words>
This was the sacred development she had been seeking, the raw, living magic before it became codified religion. <words>246</words>
A profound and peaceful anger bloomed in her chest. <words>256</words>
It was a quiet rage for this lost connection, this language of the earth that had been deliberately erased. <words>276</words>
Yet, a calm settled over her fury, the peace of finally understanding her own disjointed visions. <words>294</words>
They were not a curse but an echo of this same forgotten power. <words>307</words>
The vision receded, leaving her standing in the quiet archive with the flute's chill still on her skin. <words>327</words>
Every random turn, every choice to get lost, had been a step on a path leading directly here. <words>346</words>
She knew she could not keep the flute, but she had taken what mattered: the truth of its song. <words>366</words>
Leaving the archive, the city air felt different, charged with the potential she now recognized. <words>383</words>
The planting season was no longer just a timeframe but a mandate for her own work. <words>401</words>
She would no longer be a faux fortune teller hiding from her sight. <words>415</words>
She would learn to play the song of the earth, becoming a vessel for the sacred development the world had forgotten. <words>437</words>
Her anger was the soil, and her peace was the seed. <words>448</words>
