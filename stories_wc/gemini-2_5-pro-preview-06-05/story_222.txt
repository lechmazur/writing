The air in the Xylosian Embassy's arboretum hummed with a power Kaelen intended to make his own. <words>16</words>
He stood before the Orb-Lily, a flora of living light, its petals shivering with raw, untamed energy. <words>32</words>
From the grand hall, the orchestra was tuning, a final warning before the first dance began. <words>46</words>
His motivation was simple, almost crude for a conjurer of his skill: to harness the power of nature, not for enlightenment, but for control. <words>69</words>
"That's a curious piece," a voice like chimes interrupted his focus. <words>79</words>
Ambassador Lyra pointed a slender, crystalline finger at the tarnished silver ring on Kaelen's hand, its single black stone absorbing the arboretum's glow. <words>103</words>
It was his grandmother's, an heirloom that now forced a story he had meticulously prepared for just such an occasion. <words>122</words>
"It reminds me to be gentle," Kaelen said, his voice a low murmur designed for feigned intimacy. <words>138</words>
"She always said that you can't force a flower to bloom, you can only give it a reason to." <words>158</words>
The ambassador smiled, a politically perfect expression, yet her eyes held a flicker of genuine interest in his philosophically shallow platitude. <words>180</words>
This was the first layer of his deception, a simple appeal to a shared, manufactured sentiment. <words>196</words>
As he spoke of his grandmother's garden, his other hand slipped into his pocket, retrieving a small, threadbare washcloth. <words>216</words>
It was gray and worn, a pathetic object in this place of shimmering opulence, but it was soaked in a silent, calming hex. <words>239</words>
"She used cloths like this to clean every leaf," he continued, the lie flowing as smoothly as the water in the nearby fountain. <words>261</words>
He stepped closer to the Orb-Lily, demonstrating his fabricated memory. <words>272</words>
"A little care, a little patience," he whispered, the words a cover for the somatic components of his spell. <words>290</words>
The ambassador was captivated by the narrative, a story of simple compassion that masked his calculated dream of power. <words>309</words>
The first, soft notes of the inaugural waltz drifted through the foliage, signaling his time was up. <words>326</words>
With a movement that seemed like a tender caress, Kaelen pressed the damp, threadbare washcloth against the lily's pulsating stem. <words>347</words>
He wasn't crushing it; he was beginning to tame it, to soothe its chaotic energy into a current he could command. <words>368</words>
This was the second, truer layer of compassion: not to destroy the wild thing, but to bind it to his will with the least amount of violence. <words>394</words>
The lily's frantic light softened into a steady, rhythmic glow, its power now tethered to the black stone on his ring. <words>416</words>
"A lovely sentiment," Ambassador Lyra said, her attention returning as the story concluded with the lily's newfound peace. <words>433</words>
"You must join me for the dance." <words>441</words>
Kaelen smiled, a predator's satisfaction hidden behind a courtier's mask. <words>451</words>
"I would be honored," he replied, feeling the harnessed pulse of the wild beating in time with his own. <words>470</words>
