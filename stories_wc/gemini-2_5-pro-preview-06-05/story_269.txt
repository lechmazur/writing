The last code fractured into binary dust, and the city’s great brass heart shuddered below. <words>15</words>
On the observation deck, surrounded by whirring chronometers and sighing pneumatics, the nostalgic tailor Elias watched the storm gather. <words>33</words>
His gaze fell upon the object of his life's work: a dusty mirror, now humming with a faint, resonant energy. <words>52</words>
Within its silvered depths, another deck reflected back, but the man standing there was not quite him. <words>70</words>
This Elias was an architect of skylines, not of seams, his hands sketching futures in the air with a confidence the tailor had only ever stitched into the clothes of other men. <words>104</words>
A desperate hope, sharp and painful, seized him; this was the path to ascend beyond the frayed threads of his own mortal life. <words>129</words>
Lightning split the sky, and the deck’s copper filigree glowed, casting long, dancing shadows. <words>144</words>
The architect in the glass smiled, a slow, knowing expression that was subtly menacing, as if he knew every button Elias had ever sewn crooked. <words>171</words>
"It's alright to be afraid," the reflection's voice echoed, not through the air, but inside Elias's own mind as thunder rattled the dome. <words>195</words>
This was how the connection worked, he’d learned from the broken codices: reassurance delivered via improbable confessions during storms. <words>217</words>
"I once confessed to the Grand Machinist that my designs were stolen from a dream," the architect admitted, his form flickering. <words>238</words>
An impossible admission, yet the man in the mirror stood as a titan of his world, not an outcast. <words>257</words>
Elias felt a tremor of fear, yet he had to reassure himself that this was the only way. <words>275</words>
"I told her," Elias whispered back to the glass, his own confession catching in his throat, "that the wedding dress I made was woven with a single thread of her first lover's shroud." <words>310</words>
The architect’s menacing smile softened into something akin to understanding, a shared darkness acknowledged across the void. <words>329</words>
"During the last tempest," the reflection continued, its voice a low hum with the storm, "I confessed that I built the central spire on a foundation of lies, knowing it would one day fall." <words>364</words>
This should have been terrifying, a warning to stay away, to retreat from this flawed, parallel self. <words>382</words>
Yet, it was the ultimate reassurance; their shared imperfections were not weaknesses but the very source of the power to reshape reality. <words>406</words>
The architect extended a hand, its surface shimmering like mercury. <words>416</words>
Driven by a lifetime of longing and a final, desperate hope, Elias pressed his own trembling fingers against the cold, dusty glass. <words>440</words>
The mirror rippled, not like water, but like fabric being unstitched at the seam of the world. <words>458</words>
