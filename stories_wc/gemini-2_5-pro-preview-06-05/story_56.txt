The ancient terminal, frozen for a decade, whirred to life at the exact instant Kael needed it most. <words>16</words> He lounged against a peach tree growing through the skeletal 47th floor, a picture of energetically lethargic focus. <words>33</words> This reclaimed orchard, thriving inside the city’s greatest toppled skyscraper, was his sanctuary and his stage. <words>49</words> His only motivation was to bare the one truth the Council buried: that their life-sustaining systems were designed to fail. <words>69</words> It was a harsh reality he delivered with a gentle voice, a poison served in honey. <words>84</words> A woman with wary eyes, the head archivist, approached his little grove, her arms full of salvaged books. <words>101</words> Kael, with a practiced stumble, sent a heavy leather-bound volume tumbling from her stack right to his feet. <words>119</words> "Careful there," he murmured, his voice smooth as polished river stone, "some histories are too heavy to carry alone." <words>137</words> As she bent to retrieve it, he saw his opening, a chance to magnetize her to his cause. <words>154</words> He was a masterful bluffing swindler, and she was the key to the archives he desperately needed. <words>170</words> "I believe this belongs to you," he said, but instead of the book, he held out a small, blank price tag dangling from a string. <words>193</words> She frowned, confused by the worthless object. <words>200</words> "Its value is what we decide it is," Kael explained, his eyes glinting with the weight of his secret. <words>218</words> "A new price for our future, one not dictated by the Council's lies." <words>231</words> She hesitated, but whispers she'd heard about him—the Ghost of the 47th, the man who talked to the tower's dead systems—gave her pause. <words>256</words> These rumors were his invisible allies, seeds of doubt he had planted across the levels over years. <words>274</words> "Who are you?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. <words>283</words> "Someone who knows the truth is a key, not a weapon," he said with that same gentle harshness. <words>300</words> He gestured to the now-glowing terminal behind him, its screen scrolling with diagnostic data unseen for ten years. <words>319</words> "And the lock is about to give way." <words>327</words> "The Council says the core is stable for another century," she countered. <words>340</words> "The Council also said this tower could never fall," Kael replied softly, the orchard leaves rustling around them like a sigh. <words>361</words> He didn't need to raise his voice; the truth, now scrolling on the screen for anyone to see, was loud enough. <words>381</words> The archivist looked from the glowing screen to the simple tag in his hand, a blank slate waiting for a number. <words>402</words> She finally took the tag, her fingers brushing his. <words>411</words> "Show me," she said, no longer wary, but resolved. <words>419</words> Kael smiled, a genuine, tired expression that broke through his swindler's facade for just a moment. <words>435</words> His invisible allies had done their work, and now, he finally had one he could see. <words>451</words>
