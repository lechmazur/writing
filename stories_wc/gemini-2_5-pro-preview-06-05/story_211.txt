Silas, the luckiest man in the unremembered future, grinned as dust motes danced in the chalk-scented air of the abandoned schoolhouse. <22>
Around the splintered floorboards, the last embers of humanity giggled, their faces lit by a single candle flickering in the center of their circle. <45>
The prize, as always, was the botanical diary, its leather cover holding the pressed, perfect form of the world’s last four-leaf clover. <68>
They played their little game not for the clover itself, but to defy the gravity of hopelessness that pressed in from the ghost town outside. <92>
Silas was a man who typically never lost, his uncanny fortune having elevated him from a simple gambler to their reluctant, smiling king. <117>
The game was spin-the-bottle confessions, a childish ritual where each player offered a shard of their soul for a chance at holding the lucky book. <144>
“I once traded my brother for a clean pair of shoes,” whispered a woman with hollow eyes, her laughter tinkling like broken glass. <166>
Silas simply basked in their misery, his power growing not from the clover, but from their desperate belief in his inability to fail. <191>
Tonight, however, the bottle’s spin slowed, wobbled, and pointed not to a regular, but to a newcomer with nothing left to lose. <216>
His confession was not a memory but a demand, his voice cracking as he begged them to use their collective despair to duplicate the diary. <242>
“One source of hope is a monarchy,” the newcomer declared, “but two could be a democracy.” <258>
Silas’s smile tightened, the cheerful mask slipping to reveal the raw corruption of a man terrified of sharing his singular power. <282>
He refused, but the idea had already taken root, a weed of rebellion in the cracked soil of their hearts. <302>
They realized then that the confessions were the method, the focused energy of their shared sorrow being the true catalyst for the impossible. <326>
Ignoring Silas’s protests, they all placed their hands upon the book, pouring their whispered secrets and broken dreams into its pages. <350>
A tremor shook the small room, and a second, identical diary materialized beside the first, its cover smelling of fresh ink and ozone. <374>
The original clover within Silas’s book withered instantly to dust, his unique luck dissolving into the communal air. <394>
He was just a man now, another face in the circle, holding a useless book. <408>
The group, now custodians of a fragile, duplicated magic, passed the new diary around, their laughter echoing with a terrifying, genuine joy. <432>
They had their wish, a shared chance in a dead world, and they were all so wonderfully, hopelessly doomed together. <453>
