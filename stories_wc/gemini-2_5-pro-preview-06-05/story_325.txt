Dr. Alistair Finch adjusted the single, potted Venus flytrap on his table, its crimson maws gaping in the thin air of the mountaintop tea house. <words>25</words>
"Patience, my dear Nepenthes," he murmured, his expression comically serious for a man speaking to a plant. <words>41</words>
The intermission bell chimed, a delicate sound slicing through the hushed conversations of the other patrons. <words>57</words>
This was his chance. <words>61</words>
From a worn satchel, he produced a small, hand-cranked projector and a reel of black-and-white film. <words>78</words>
His movements were precise, almost surgical, as he aimed the device not at the wall, but at an empty space above the steaming samovar. <words>102</words>
He then unbuckled his worn-out leather belt, an object of cracked hide and faded tooling. <words>118</words>
It was no mere accessory; its intricate patterns were a star-chart, a guide he now consulted with feverish intensity. <words>138</words>
His motivation was singular and absolute: to find the ancient pathways, the invisible conduits that stitched the world together. <words>158</words>
He believed this high-altitude location was a nexus, a weak point between realms. <words>172</words>
Finding a specific notch on the film canister that corresponded to a marking on his belt, he threaded the celluloid into the projector. <words>196</words>
He began to crank, and a flickering square of light hit the air, showing a banal documentary about provincial hat-making. <words>218</words>
Then, for a split second, the image flashed to a hidden section of the reelâ€”a dizzying spiral of geometric shapes. <words>239</words>
Alistair pulled a small, copper-tipped wand from his coat and connected it to the projector's housing with a thin wire. <words>260</words>
"Now, we shall ionize the very firmament," he whispered, his voice a low thrum of excitement. <words>276</words>
He jabbed the wand into the beam of light, and a low hum filled the immediate area, smelling of ozone and brewing oolong. <words>299</words>
This was the core of his work, the unexplained phenomena that conventional science dismissed as fantasy. <words>316</words>
The dust motes and water vapor in the projector's beam stopped their chaotic dance. <words>330</words>
Slowly, they began to align, coalescing into a shimmering, ethereal thread that hung in the air like a crack in reality. <words>352</words>
It was the barest hint of a pathway, a ghost of a road. <words>365</words>
On the table, Nepenthes trembled, not with hunger, but with a strange resonance, its traps snapping shut in a sudden, violent rhythm. <words>388</words>
Alistair watched the plant, his partner in this mad quest, and saw a new, wild energy in its movements. <words>408</words>
The fickle loyalty of a thing bred for consumption was now being tested by forces far older than botany. <words>428</words>
The final bell for the second act rang out, shattering the moment. <words>441</words>
With a grimace of triumph, Alistair packed his apparatus, refastened his cryptic belt, and gave the still-quivering plant a reassuring pat. <words>464</words>
He had his heading, but he now suspected the pathways might not be the only things with a will of their own. <words>486</words>
