Elias, who had once been only a small-town baker, gently adjusted the chronometer on the rusted console. <words>16</words>
The emergency time machine garage smelled of ozone and burnt sugar, a ghost of his former life. <words>32</words>
He worked with a cynically gentle precision, his flour-dusted fingers arranging a delicate mosaic of pressed flowers on a temporal plate. <words>52</words>
Each petal, a fragile whisper of defiance, was meant to dethrone a tyrant. <words>65</words>
This was the era when shadows learn to speak, their murmurs slithering from every corner, carrying tales of the despot's cruelty. <words>86</words>
They spoke of his family, and that was why Elias was here. <words>98</words>
He no longer baked bread to feed the hungry; he cultivated a cure for a poisoned kingdom. <words>115</words>
Within the veins of each brittle larkspur and dried rose were the seeds of contagion. <words>131</words>
It was not a plague of the body, but a contagion of memory, engineered to reawaken the courage the tyrant had bled from the world. <words>155</words>
His plan was simple, desperate, and hinged on ancient knowledge. <words>165</words>
He would exceed the machine’s known limits, pushing it further back than its designers ever intended. <words>181</words>
Success was only possible by tracking moon patterns, a skill he’d learned for timing the perfect sourdough starter. <words>201</words>
The tyrant had risen to power during a new moon, a time of profound darkness and concealment. <words>218</words>
Elias had charted the celestial cycles, finding a precise, mirrored alignment in the past—a lunar eclipse that would act as a temporal anchor. <words>243</words>
This specific celestial event would amplify the machine's power, allowing the contagion to spread not through the air, but through the timeline itself. <words>267</words>
"A little yeast leavens the whole lump," he muttered, the old baker's adage now a grim prayer. <words>284</words>
He flipped the final switch as the moon outside vanished behind the earth's umbra. <words>299</words>
The garage groaned, light bending around the pressed flowers as they dissolved into shimmering dust. <words>315</words>
The energy discharge threw him against the far wall, his breath knocked out of him. <words>330</words>
He had done it. <words>334</words>
Staggering to the garage door, he pushed it open to a world that felt subtly different. <words>351</words>
The whispering shadows had not vanished. <words>357</words>
Instead, they were coalescing, their hushed tones rising into a chorus of names and forgotten truths. <words>375</words>
The seeds had found fertile ground in the soil of the past. <words>388</words>
Elias watched, a tired man who had used the gentle art of preservation to unleash a beautiful, terrible bloom of rebellion. <words>409</words>
He didn't know if it would be enough, but for the first time in years, the darkness felt a little less absolute. <words>431</words>
The tyrant's shadow, once monolithic, now had countless others rising to meet it. <words>444</words>
