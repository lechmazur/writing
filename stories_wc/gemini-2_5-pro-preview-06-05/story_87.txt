Elias, a patient librarian by trade and temperament, sat perfectly still amidst the clamor of the Grand Automaton Dining Hall. <words>19</words>
He was a portrait of the hyperactively serene, his placid expression a mask for the storm raging within him. <words>35</words>
The source of the tempest was a tinny melody leaking from his brass-inlaid audio player, a tune he was excavating through forgotten mixtapes. <words>56</words>
Steam hissed from copper pipes overhead, and the clockwork waiters glided between tables with unnerving precision, yet he saw none of it. <words>78</words>
His world had narrowed to the memory reclaimed, a moment lived in this very hall decades ago, now pulsing in the hush of his mind. <words>104</words>
His long-held motivation was simple and brutal: to finally bury an old hatred that had festered for far too long. <words>124</words>
His fingers, resting on the polished mahogany table, traced the edges of a wrinkled sticker sheet he’d carried for thirty years. <words>145</words>
Each cartoon star and faded smiley face was a testament to a friendship poisoned by betrayal. <words>161</words>
The music, a song Alistair had recorded for him, was the key and the poison, a relic of the day everything shattered. <words>183</words>
He remembered Alistair’s laugh, sharp and cruel, as he’d snatched Elias’s designs for the chronometer that won him the city’s Grand Exposition prize. <words>210</words>
“A gift,” Alistair had said, sliding the cheap sticker sheet across the table as a mocking consolation prize. <words>229</words>
For years, the injustice had been a living thing inside him, a parasite feeding on his peace. <words>246</words>
The old rage began to throb behind his eyes, a familiar and almost comforting pain. <words>261</words>
But today was for the burial. <words>267</words>
With a savage grace, Elias focused on the memory, not to relive the anger, but to dissect it. <words>285</words>
He let the jaunty, synthesized beat of the mixtape wash over the image of Alistair’s sneering face. <words>302</words>
He mentally took the hatred, a writhing, dark energy, and pushed it down into a deep, soundless vault within his consciousness. <words>324</words>
He pictured the lock turning, the tumblers clicking into place, the silence that followed the fury. <words>341</words>
The song faded into a gentle hiss of tape. <words>350</words>
The memory receded, leaving behind the sterile clatter of the dining hall. <words>363</words>
He looked at the wrinkled sticker sheet, no longer a symbol of burning rage but just a piece of aged, flimsy paper. <words>386</words>
The hatred was gone, interred as planned. <words>394</words>
A vast, quiet emptiness bloomed in its place, a void where a mountain had once stood. <words>412</words>
He had won, but the silence that answered his triumph was the sound of a truly hollow victory. <words>430</words>
