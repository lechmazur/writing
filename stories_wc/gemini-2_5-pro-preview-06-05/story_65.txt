The slapdash bard, Finnian, hummed a crooked tune as he spread a stained blanket over the shuddering earth. <16>
He was perched at the very edge of the world, where two tectonic plates ground together in a groan that vibrated through his bones. <34>
Beside his half-unpacked picnic basket sat a curious hourglass, its frame carved from petrified wood. <48>
This place was sacred, a seam in reality his family had honored for generations. <62>
They had always done so with this exact ritual: a family tradition of having a picnic in a certain spot. <81>
But his family was gone, and a rattling cough in his chest promised he would soon follow. <97>
To escape the clutches of death was his only goal now, a desperate, frantic prayer. <113>
From his satchel, he pulled not a lute, but a tarnished brass doorplate, the name of his long-dead grandmother barely legible upon it. <136>
He placed it in the center of the blanket, a profane altar in this holy place. <152>
The air grew still, and the hourglass began its trick. <162>
Slowly, impossibly, the sand in the bottom bulb started to drift upwards, defying gravity while the hourglass resets its sand. <182>
This was his window, the moment of un-time when the possibly impossible could be attempted. <197>
Finnian had to disrupt the ancient energy of this place, to sever his fate from the world’s natural rhythm. <217>
He began to sing, not the reverent hymns of his ancestors, but a chaotic, discordant ballad of his own messy invention. <238>
His voice cracked and his fingers drummed an arrhythmic beat on the brass doorplate, sending jarring vibrations into the sacred ground. <259>
The earth’s gentle shuddering became a violent tremor, protesting his intrusion. <270>
He sang of back-alley brawls and stolen wine, of cheap love and cheaper thrills, a cacophony of life poured into a space meant for serene passage. <297>
He was a discordant note in a divine symphony, a deliberate act of chaos. <311>
With a final, desperate crescendo, he slammed his palm onto the doorplate just as the last grain of sand floated to the top of the hourglass. <337>
Silence fell, absolute and profound. <342>
The trembling in the earth ceased, and more importantly, the rattling in his chest went quiet. <357>
He took a deep, clean breath, the first in months, feeling life, raw and stolen, flood his veins. <375>
A wild, tear-streaked grin split his face, a perfect expression of melancholic glee. <389>
He had done it; he had broken the rules and won. <399>
Packing his basket with trembling hands, he left the doorplate behind, a scar on the sacred land. <416>
He was alive and utterly alone, a ghost who had refused his grave, walking away from the only home he had ever known. <437>
