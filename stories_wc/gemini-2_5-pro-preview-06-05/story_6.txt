Elara, a minstrel who believed in sharp wits over dull magic, stood within the skeletal remains of the old disappearing ink factory. <words>21</words>
The midday sun streamed through grimy skylights, illuminating dust motes dancing in the hush that only an empty mailbox truly understands. <words>43</words>
She was here to out-scheme Vex, an immortal trickster with a penchant for collecting souls and stories, usually in that order. <words>65</words>
He materialized from a shadow pooling near a vat leaking colorless fluid, his grin a slash of ancient, knowing cruelty. <words>86</words>
"My little songbird," Vex purred, his voice like honey and rust. <words>97</words>
"Have you brought what is mine?" <words>103</words>
Elara said nothing, her fingers closing around the object in her pocket: a single, iridescent scrap of dragon-scale armor. <words>122</words>
It was a thing of pure myth, impossibly real, and Vex had coveted it for a thousand years after losing it in a foolish wager with a star. <words>151</words>
He expected her to barter, to beg, to try and leverage the scale for her own pathetic mortality. <words>170</words>
Instead, Elara pulled out a simple leather slingshot. <words>178</words>
Vex laughed, a sound like shattering glass. <words>185</words>
"You cannot harm me with a child's toy," he sneered. <words>195</words>
"I know," Elara replied, her expression one of irreverent awe for the sheer audacity of her own plan. <words>214</words>
She didn't load a stone; she carefully fitted the shimmering dragon scale into the slingshot's pouch. <words>231</words>
Her scheme was not one of attack, but of a reckless generosity so profound it bordered on madness. <words>249</words>
"You thrive on deals, on possession, on the strings of ownership," she stated, her voice clear and steady above the factory's hum. <words>271</words>
"You can't win something that isn't being played for." <words>280</words>
Before Vex could comprehend her impossibly plausible logic, she turned toward the heart of the factory. <words>297</words>
There, an ancient steam vent hissed a constant, sighing breath from the building's forgotten depths. <words>313</words>
With a sharp snap of elastic, she launched the priceless relic not at the trickster, but directly into the plume of vapor. <words>336</words>
The scale vanished via the hiss of the ancient steam vent, caught in the updraft and whisked away into the labyrinthine pipes below. <words>360</words>
It was gone, belonging to no one now, its story surrendered to the indifferent mechanics of the earth. <words>379</words>
Vex stood frozen, his eternal smirk wiped clean for the first time in millennia. <words>394</words>
He hadn't won, but he hadn't lost either; the game itself had been dissolved into steam. <words>411</words>
Elara simply smiled, turned her back on the speechless immortal, and walked out into the silent, waiting afternoon. <words>431</words>
She was already composing the ballad, a tune about how the greatest trick is to give everything away. <words>449</words>
