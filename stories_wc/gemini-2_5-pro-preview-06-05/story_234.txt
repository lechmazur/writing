The orchard dog had finally fallen silent, leaving the dinosaur skeleton museum to its deep, velvet quiet. <words>17</words> Kael stood beneath the Allosaurus, his hand resting on the hilt of a sword that had seen more polishing than blood. <words>36</words> "Still waiting, you big lug?" he murmured to the fossil, his voice a familiar rasp of brusque affection. <words>53</words> He was the night watchman, a post he held with a faithfully unfaithful heart; loyal to this hall of ancient echoes, but disloyal to the men who paid him to simply walk its floors. <words>89</words> His true purpose lay with the peculiar art installation tucked beside the beast's fossilized feet: a half-painted sundial of obsidian and bone. <words>115</words> For years he had studied it, a true late bloomer in the arcane arts, only recently grasping its secret language. <words>136</words> The moonlight, lancing through the high atrium window, struck the dial at the precise angle he had calculated. <words>155</words> He pulled a worn, empty matchbox from his pocket, its hollowness a perfect vessel for the impossible. <words>173</words> He wasn't just a lover of the past, but a xenophile in the truest sense, seeking communion with the utterly alien. <words>195</words> His motivation was not power, but a quiet, overwhelming need to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, to feel its cosmic pulse for just a moment. <words>228</words> The coded angles of the half-painted sundial were not a map, but a lens, designed to focus the ambient starlight into a single, coherent point. <words>256</words> He placed the open, empty matchbox at the focal point on the dial's unpainted half. <words>272</words> A shimmer, no brighter than a firefly, coalesced inside the small cardboard frame. <words>285</words> It wasn't a light, but a texture, a feeling of immense distance and profound strangeness that hummed against his senses. <words>306</words> He saw nebulae swirling in the space of a thumbnail, heard the silent chime of dying stars, and felt the gravitational pull of galaxies he could not name. <words>336</words> This was his unfaithfulness: stealing moments of cosmic clarity from a world that demanded he only watch for burglars. <words>358</words> This was his faith: a belief that understanding was the highest form of guardianship. <words>374</words> The moment stretched, a perfect, fragile eternity held within the cheap container. <words>386</words> Then, as the moon shifted, the shimmer vanished, leaving the matchbox empty once more. <words>401</words> Kael snapped it shut, the sound sharp in the immense silence. <words>412</words> He patted the Allosaurus's massive tibia. <words>418</words> "Patience," he grunted, his words a promise. <words>424</words> "We're getting there." <words>427</words>
