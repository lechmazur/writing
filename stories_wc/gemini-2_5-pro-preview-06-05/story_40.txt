Alistair, currently on his fourth life and first as a professional goldfish therapist, believed all traditions were just peer pressure from dead people. <words>21</words>
He ran a hand over the dusty spine of *Granny Grizelda’s Goulash Gauntlet*, the air in the forgotten recipe library thick with the ghosts of bad cooking. <words>46</words>
His true purpose here, however, was to disrupt the most stagnant tradition of all: the one that insisted only certain ancient, ineffective broths could be used for the Wasting Sickness. <words>80</words>
Guilt’s haunting echo, a souvenir from his life as a failed Napoleonic field medic, was a constant companion. <words>100</words>
He absently fiddled with the toy soldier with a missing arm in his pocket, a tiny, plastic reminder of his past incompetence. <words>124</words>
Outside, a sky that had been a placid blue moments ago suddenly turned a bruised purple, unleashing a torrent of rain against the library’s grimy windows. <words>153</words>
The heavy oak door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a young woman with panic in her eyes. <words>174</words>
"They're all useless," she sobbed, clutching a sheaf of papers, "Every single sanctioned recipe." <words>189</words>
Alistair recognized the letterhead from the sanatorium; this was all happening before the doctor’s chart confirms a turning point for someone she loved. <words>217</words>
"Tradition is a lovely excuse to never have a new idea," he quipped, his tone dripping with a playful cynicism honed over centuries. <words>241</words>
The woman flinched, and Alistair felt a familiar pang—not pity, but a sharp, protective instinct. <words>258</words>
He was, after all, tentatively fierce when it came to fighting the idiocy of established rules. <words>276</words>
His mission was to alleviate suffering, not just watch it unfold according to some dusty, dogmatic playbook. <words>296</words>
"The sanctioned recipes are for show," he said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. <words>311</words>
"The real ones, the ones that actually work, were hidden because they were considered 'unseemly' by the founders." <words>332</words>
He strode to a dark corner of the library, to a section marked only with a faded symbol of a serpent eating its own tail. <words>357</words>
Pulling out a thin, leather-bound volume, he blew a cloud of dust from its cover. <words>372</words>
"This one uses nightshade, fermented honey, and a shocking amount of garlic," he announced, offering it to her. <words>392</words>
"It's an old battlefield remedy, meant to shock the system back to life." <words>406</words>
Her eyes widened, a flicker of desperate hope warring with a lifetime of ingrained obedience. <words>422</words>
She took the book, her fingers brushing his. <words>429</words>
As she fled back into the abating storm, Alistair leaned against the shelves, the weight in his pocket feeling just a little bit lighter. <words>453</words>
The one-armed soldier couldn't be fixed, but maybe, just maybe, this time the patient wouldn't be lost. <words>472</words>
