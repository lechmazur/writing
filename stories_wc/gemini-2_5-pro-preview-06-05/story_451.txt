The scent of bruised peaches and damp earth clung to the alley, a stark contrast to the farmers market bustle just feet away. <22>
Kael pressed a worn photograph into the actor’s hand, the man’s face a carefully constructed mask of disinterest. <40>
“Find him,” Kael whispered, his voice swallowed by the cacophony of vendors and laughing children. <54>
This clandestine meeting was the seventh in as many weeks, another desperate attempt to locate the other half of his identity. <74>
His motivation was a cold, hard knot in his gut: to outlive an apocalyptic prophecy. <89>
Back in his sterile apartment, the only source of the prophecy sat on his mantelpiece, a baseball signed by a time traveler. <111>
The ink wasn't a name but a date and a warning, forbidden knowledge scrawled across stitched leather that spoke of twin stars falling. <135>
It was a typically unique artifact, the only one of its kind, and the source of his unending dread. <154>
The prophecy demanded a sacrifice, one twin for the survival of the world, and Kael refused to be a cosmic pawn. <176>
He had to find his brother first, to understand, to control the outcome. <189>
The actor’s tip finally led him here, to a mysterious mountain peak that clawed at a sky of bruised twilight. <211>
The air was thin, casting the world in crystal shadows, where every jagged rock was sharply defined yet draped in deep, cold gloom. <235>
He wasn't alone. <238>
A figure stood silhouetted against the fading light, a mirror image of the man in the photograph Kael carried. <259>
It was him, his twin. <264>
“You have the ball,” the man said, his voice an unnervingly familiar echo of Kael’s own. <281>
“Then you know what must be done.” <288>
Kael’s hand tightened on the tranquilizer pistol hidden in his jacket; the plan had always been to subdue his brother, to take him somewhere safe until the prophesied date passed. <321>
“The knowledge is a curse,” Kael stated, stepping forward into the biting wind. <334>
His brother shook his head, a sad smile touching his lips. <345>
“The curse isn’t the knowledge; it’s the power I was born with, the one you lack.” <362>
He held up his hands, and the very air around them seemed to fracture like glass. <377>
“The prophecy isn’t about one of us dying,” he explained, his voice strained with effort. <393>
“It’s about you being the only one who can subdue this power inside me before it shatters everything.” <412>
Kael stared, the pistol in his pocket suddenly feeling impossibly heavy, the entire weight of the world’s future resting on an action he had completely misunderstood. <439>
