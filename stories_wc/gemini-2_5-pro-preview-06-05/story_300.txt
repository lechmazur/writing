Cassius, an outlaw by imperial decree and a scavenger by necessity, moved through the Roman marketplace with the practiced air of a man pricing olives. <words>23</words>
"Behold the grandeur of Rome," he muttered to himself, watching a senator trip over a loose cobblestone, "a city of gods and clumsy oafs." <words>46</words>
His earnest mockery was a shield against the stench of fish and ambition that hung heavy in the air. <words>64</words>
He was not here for olives or to ridicule the elite; he was on the threshold of discovery, a state that felt both terrifying and sublime. <words>88</words>
His motivation was a legend whispered among the city's underbelly: a hidden power source, the lost heart of a forgotten cult, potent enough to topple an emperor or build a new world. <words>125</words>
A wistfully pragmatic thought surfacedâ€”with such power, he could perhaps afford a life where he did not have to sift through other people's garbage. <words>151</words>
He stopped at a stall piled high with discarded junk, its owner snoring loudly under a tattered awning. <words>169</words>
Here, amidst chipped pottery and rusted tools, was his true quarry. <words>179</words>
Cassius began to browse the stack of disused canvases, each one a failed artist's forgotten dream. <words>195</words>
From a simple cloth pouch at his belt, he discreetly pulled a small, grimy square of his own canvas. <words>215</words>
His method was painstakingly obscure: he was matching the unique, iridescent paint smudges left on the canvases, remnants of a pigment known only to the cultists who had guarded the power source. <words>252</words>
For months, he had collected these fragments, piecing together a celestial map disguised as abstract art. <words>268</words>
He held his fragment against one canvas, then another, the faint chemical scent of the old paint filling his nostrils. <words>289</words>
The smudges were close, but not a perfect match. <words>299</words>
His determination, the very quality that had made him an outlaw, burned away his frustration. <words>314</words>
He would not leave this marketplace without the final piece. <words>324</words>
Then he saw it at the bottom of the pile: a small, unassuming canvas depicting a poorly rendered bowl of fruit. <words>345</words>
But in the corner, almost invisible, was a smear of shimmering cerulean blue. <words>359</words>
He pressed his fragment to it, and the lines of the smudge flowed together perfectly, completing the constellation of Lyra. <words>380</words>
A silent, breathtaking shimmer of possibility washed over him, the map now complete in his mind's eye. <words>398</words>
He tossed a few cheap coins onto the snoring merchant's belly, a down payment on a new era. <words>416</words>
Tucking the worthless painting under his arm, Cassius slipped back into the crowd, the simple cloth pouch on his hip feeling heavier than all the gold in Rome. <words>444</words>
The city could keep its gods and oafs; he was off to find a real power. <words>461</words>
