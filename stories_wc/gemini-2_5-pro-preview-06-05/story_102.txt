The world outside was finally silent, the wind having screamed itself into exhaustion. <words>12</words>
Inside the map projection room, constellations of forgotten coastlines and phantom mountain ranges swam across the floor and walls in a soft, blue glow. <words>34</words>
I, a mercenary whose spine was more suggestion than substance, watched the shifting light paint patterns on the back of my trembling hands. <words>56</words>
My mentor, Elara, stood silhouetted against a swirling projection of the Serpent's Sea, her presence as sharp as the preceding gale. <words>78</words>
"The Seer's Lament is not a poem, Kael, it is a key," she said, her voice echoing slightly in the hush. <words>98</words>
"It's a prophecy spoken in code, and your task is to hush it before it unlocks a new age of ruin." <words>121</words>
My motivation was simpler: the promise of enough gold to disappear, and the threat of what she'd do if I refused. <words>143</words>
She turned, and the light caught the object she held out on her palm. <words>157</words>
It was a tiny, ornate Victorian dollhouse key, its brass filigree almost comical in its delicacy. <words>174</words>
This was the tool for a world-altering task, an artifact so grandly trivial it made my stomach clench. <words>193</words>
"The code isn't in the words," Elara continued, her gaze fixed on me, "it's in a place the words point to." <words>215</words>
Her finger traced a line of faint light on the wall, a path that snaked through nonexistent kingdoms. <words>233</words>
"You will get there through forgotten trails, paths that have fallen off every map but this one." <words>251</words>
She was offering me a journey into uncharted horizons, a concept that felt like a physical weight on my chest. <words>272</words>
Every instinct screamed at me to run, to find a hole and pull it in after me. <words>289</words>
But the glow of the maps was hypnotic, a promise of something other than the grubby, fearful life I knew. <words>311</words>
A luminous doubt began to flicker within me, a terrifying and beautiful uncertainty about what lay beyond the edge of the world I knew. <words>337</words>
Was it better to be a coward in a familiar hell, or a coward on the path to a new one? <words>361</words>
I reached out and took the dollhouse key from her hand. <words>372</words>
It felt impossibly heavy, a universe of consequence resting in my sweaty palm. <words>386</words>
Elara nodded once, a gesture of finality that sealed my fate. <words>398</words>
I turned from the swirling light of the room and walked toward the door, the tiny key a cold point of focus against my skin. <words>423</words>
The hush after the wind no longer howls was waiting for me, and with it, the first step onto a trail that the world had tried to forget. <words>452</words>
