Jedediah, once a man of the badge and the gun, now knelt in the raked gravel of the ancient castle garden, gathering the broken pieces of a celadon bowl. <26>
The spring air, thick with the scent of damp earth and cherry blossoms, was a balm he applied to the scarred memories of his former life. <49>
This quiet existence, tending to the moss and planting rice seeds in the shadow of the weathered keep, was a state of corroded rapture he guarded jealously. <77>
He pushed the vintage spectacles, their wire frames mended in three places, up the bridge of his nose, bringing the delicate ceramic shards into focus. <103>
Each fragment was a day, a choice, a ghost he was trying to lay to rest with golden lacquer and patience. <124>
It was a probably improbable peace, a fragile construct in a world that had always demanded violence from him. <144>
Then, the old priest who managed the castle grounds shuffled towards him, holding a single, misplaced letter. <162>
The envelope was addressed to a "Master Kenjiro," a name that hadn't been spoken within these stone walls for a century, yet it had found its way here. <192>
Jedediah took it, his calloused fingers tracing the foreign script, a cold dread seeping into the warmth of the afternoon. <214>
He knew he shouldn't open it, that it was a violation of his sanctuary, a key to a door he had bolted shut. <238>
But the need to know, the old instinct of the lawman, was a current too strong to fight. <257>
Inside, the letter wasn't for a long-dead samurai, but a desperate plea from a nearby village, a story of extortion and fear at the hands of a local tyrant. <289>
The words began to stir the ashes of the man he used to be, the protector, the enforcer. <308>
He had come here specifically to escape this cycle of violence, to stop being the hammer that saw every problem as a nail. <334>
He looked from the letter to the neat rows of freshly planted seeds, each a promise of a life untainted by blood. <357>
The spectacles, however, seemed to clarify not just the paper, but the truth of his own nature. <376>
You could not escape the world by simply gathering your own broken pieces; sometimes you had to stop others from being shattered in the first place. <405>
A grim smile touched his lips, the familiar, metallic taste of purpose mixing with the sweet air. <425>
He folded the letter, the crinkle of the paper as loud as a gunshot in the tranquil garden. <443>
His rapture was corroded, yes, but it was still his to define, and today it would be defined not by planting seeds, but by pulling weeds. <471>
He stood up, leaving the bowl's fragments scattered in the gravel, and walked towards the castle gate. <490>
