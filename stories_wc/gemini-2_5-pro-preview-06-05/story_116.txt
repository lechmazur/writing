The minstrel, Elian, sat alone in the black velvet sky-lounge, a silent ship adrift on a sea of light. <words>18</words>
Below him, the endless city sprawled, a circuit board of impossible scale and cold beauty. <words>32</words>
A familiar dismay settled in his chest, the quiet ache of being a single note lost in a deafening chord. <words>51</words>
His purpose, however, was subjectively rational: to draw a map of an endless night. <words>65</words>
He would not use ink or instruments, but instead excavate the past. <words>77</words>
His method was to study the constellation of old polaroid photographs spread across the polished obsidian table. <words>94</words>
Each was a captured star, a fixed point in the sprawling darkness he sought to chart. <words>110</words>
He worked here, amid garden secrets, where bioluminescent flora pulsed with unspoken histories in the manufactured twilight. <words>129</words>
The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone, the ghosts of conversations clinging to the broad, waxy leaves. <words>150</words>
Elian’s fingers, stained with fixer, hovered over one particular image of a laughing woman in a rooftop arboretum. <words>169</words>
He remembered the precise moment the shutter clicked, the boundary it drew around a feeling he thought was infinite. <words>187</words>
On her wrist in the faded photograph was a silver watch, its band snapped clean in two. <words>203</words>
He pulled the very same broken watch band from his pocket, the metal cool and dead against his palm. <words>221</words>
It was his most concrete failure, a relic of a time he could not hold. <words>236</words>
How could he map a city’s boundless night when he couldn’t even contain a single afternoon? <words>252</words>
The sheer, illogical scope of his project suddenly felt less like exuberance and more like madness. <words>268</words>
He had been trying to connect every point of light, to force a grand, universal meaning onto a billion disparate souls. <words>288</words>
The city did not want a map; it thrived on being endless, on its secrets remaining secret. <words>305</words>
His drawn boundaries were not for the city, but for him, a desperate attempt to find his own edges. <words>323</words>
A slow smile, the first in weeks, touched Elian’s lips with a quiet energy. <words>337</words>
His quest was not a failure, just poorly defined. <words>346</words>
He pushed the sprawling collection of photographs aside, leaving only the one of the laughing woman. <words>362</words>
He would not map the night. <words>368</words>
He would map her smile. <words>373</words>
He would chart the topography of that single, perfect moment. <words>383</words>
Picking up his synth-lute, its fretboard dark as the void outside, he let his fingers find a chord. <words>401</words>
It was not a grand anthem for the city, but a small, intricate melody, a secret whispered back to the garden. <words>421</words>
The song was a new kind of map, a single point of warmth with its own drawn boundaries, fiercely protected and subjectively true. <words>444</words>
And in the black velvet lounge, floating above an endless city, the dismayed minstrel finally began to play his way home. <words>464</words>
