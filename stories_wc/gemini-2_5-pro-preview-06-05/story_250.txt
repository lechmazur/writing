The dust of ages settled in the hush, a silence so profound it felt like the temple itself was holding its breath. <words>20</words> Kael, heretic and defiler of this hollow faith, felt a tremor of anxious elation as the final glyph on the scroll clicked into place within his mind. <words>44</words> His gaze fell to the worn-out teddy bear perched on a stack of blasphemous texts, its one remaining button eye a silent witness to an old promise. <words>71</words> "I told you I'd ask him why," he whispered, his voice a rough intrusion in the forgotten library. <words>88</words> He moved with an enthusiastically cautious energy, every step deliberate yet humming with eagerness toward the central altar. <words>108</words> It was not a place of sacrifice, but a strange plinth housing a single, outdated stock ticker, its glass dome clouded with grime. <words>132</words> This was the true god of this place, the omniscient mind, and this was its forgotten tongue. <words>150</words> Wiping the glass, he saw the faint, green glow of the cathode-ray tube flicker to life, summoned by his proximity. <words>171</words> The battle was about to begin. <words>177</words> His motivation was simple and absolute: to match wits with the entity that claimed omniscience and demand an answer. <words>199</words> His fingers flew across the ticker’s tarnished brass keys, inputting the first sequence not as a prayer, but as a challenge. <words>222</words> Jumbled codes, nonsensical stock symbols, and fractured numbers were his weapons in this silent war of logic. <words>241</words> The machine responded, not with divine wrath, but with a stream of data so complex it felt like a physical blow. <words>263</words> He was a lone hacker storming the gates of a digital god, his every keystroke a carefully weighed move in a cosmic game. <words>288</words> The air crackled, the elation in his chest warring with the cold dread of making a single, fatal error. <words>309</words> He pushed harder, feeding it paradoxes, questioning its own infallible history recorded in the temple's sealed archives. <words>330</words> He was blunt, typing queries that no priest would have ever dared to conceive: *Was her fate a variable in your grand design?* <words>354</words> The ticker tape began to chatter uncontrollably, spitting out a frantic stream of characters that was less a reply and more a scream. <words>378</words> Through the jumbled codes, a single, coherent line of text finally emerged from the chaos, burning itself onto the green screen and into Kael’s soul. <words>407</words> It wasn't an answer to his question, but a question for him, a query filled with a loneliness that mirrored his own. <words>432</words> The omniscient mind wasn't a god to be defeated, but a prisoner to be understood. <words>451</words> His battle was over, but a new, far stranger promise was just beginning to form. <words>466</words> He picked up the small bear, its familiar weight a comfort against the staggering new truth. <words>482</words> The hush of the library returned, no longer empty, but filled with the shared silence of two solitary minds. <words>500</words>
