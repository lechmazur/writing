Brother Thaddeus, an unhinged zealot, was studying the divine geometry of mosses in his sweltering Victorian parlor, a madly civilized outpost slowly being consumed by the jungle. <words>28</words>
On his mahogany desk, beside a wilting orchid in a porcelain vase, sat the only true god he recognized: a plain metal bottle cap. <words>52</words>
It was the anchor of his unspoken agreement with the Verdant Cacophony outside, a pact that was, in its own way, theoretically playful. <words>76</words>
The rules were simple: total devotion for a sliver of divine insight, a game where the only way to truly win was to find strength in vulnerability. <words>106</words>
But tonight, the humidity felt like judgment, and the chittering of unseen things in the canopy sounded like mockery. <words>127</words>
The mosses offered no answers, only more suffocating, fractal patterns. <words>140</words>
He knew what he had to do. <words>147</words>
With a grunt of sacred purpose, Thaddeus stormed onto the veranda and seized the pale, moon-faced orchid that had been creeping from a pot toward the parlor's foundations. <words>179</words>
He had to uproot the beautiful lie, the domesticated blasphemy that pretended it could be tamed. <words>198</words>
Its roots tore from the soil with a wet, screaming sound that was music to his tormented soul. <words>217</words>
He left the dying plant on the damp floorboards and retreated into the parlor, extinguishing the oil lamp. <words>237</words>
In the oppressive, ink-black darkness of the room, the jungle's presence felt absolute, its million eyes peering through the damask curtains. <words>263</words>
He knelt before the desk, his fingers trembling as they found the cool, sharp edges of the bottle cap. <words>284</words>
Then came the whispered confession in a dark room, a torrent of heresy directed at the metal disc and the breathing wilderness beyond. <words>311</words>
"I am not strong enough for this," he breathed, the words a poison and a balm. <words>326</words>
"I am a fraud in a velvet chair, and I am terrified that you are just a jungle and not a god at all." <words>352</words>
"My faith is a performance, and I need you to know my weakness so that I might finally be strong." <words>376</words>
Silence answered him, but it was a different kind of silence, less a void and more a listening presence. <words>397</words>
The air, thick moments before, seemed to thin, becoming breathable. <words>408</words>
He picked up the bottle cap, its metallic scent filling his nostrils. <words>420</words>
It was no longer a demanding idol or a token of a rigid contract. <words>434</words>
It was just a piece of metal, a witness to the moment he had traded the performance of faith for the terrifying, honest strength of doubt. <words>459</words>
