Kael stood sentinel among the genetically perfected Earth-ferns, his posture a study in serene anger. <words>14</words>
His charge, the Director’s vapid son, was entertaining guests amid the lush, oxygen-rich air of the lunar greenhouse, a bubble of life perched on Shackleton Crater’s edge. <words>42</words>
Kael’s focus, however, was not on the boy, but on the whispers that drifted between the alien blooms like pollen. <words>61</words>
For months, amid these tedious park visits, he had been building his escape. <words>73</words>
His method was simple: he collected fragments of overheard stories from the powerful and the careless. <words>89</words>
A snippet about a data-purge protocol, a complaint about a comms relay’s lag, a boast about a new autonomous freighter route—each was a brick in his new life. <words>120</words>
His motivation was a constant, low-frequency hum beneath his skin: to break free from the Director’s controlling influence, an ownership codified in the fine print of his contract. <words>153</words>
He subtly shifted his weight, his gaze sweeping the dome, but his mind was on the plan that had become serendipitously stubborn, refusing to fail. <words>180</words>
Every overheard word, every lucky break, had only hardened his resolve. <words>191</words>
Inside his tunic, pressed against his heart, was the faded photograph of a coastline he’d never seen, a promise of real air and open water. <words>221</words>
It was a relic of a life he was determined to claim, a timely rebirth he would architect himself. <words>240</words>
Today, a visiting shipping magnate had spoken of a new charter, one that required a final, digital signature to ratify its flight plan before the next lunar rotation. <words>272</words>
The magnate had laughed about its ghost-in-the-machine security, a system so new it had exploitable backdoors for its creators. <words>296</words>
Kael had overheard the access codes, disguised as coordinates in a casual conversation. <words>310</words>
He now possessed the final fragment he needed. <words>319</words>
His plan was no longer a collection of whispers but a solid, actionable directive. <words>334</words>
He would use the Director’s own network to insert a ghost passenger onto that charter, to create a new identity and erase the old one. <words>361</words>
He would ratify his own freedom. <words>367</words>
The tension in his shoulders did not ease but transformed, shifting from the strain of confinement to the electric hum of imminent action. <words>394</words>
He gave his charge one last, indifferent glance, the boy a symbol of the gilded cage he was about to dismantle. <words>416</words>
Turning his back on the fabricated Eden, Kael walked calmly towards a service terminal, the faded photograph a warm weight against his chest. <words>442</words>
His rebirth was scheduled for departure in three hours. <words>451</words>
