The surly watchman, Silas, patrolled the sailor's graveyard as the last breath of autumn surrendered to the first bite of winter. <21>
Wind, smelling of salt and decay, whipped between the leaning headstones, each a chipped tooth in the jawbone of the coast. <40>
He was a man between seasons himself, caught in a serenely frantic state of observation. <54>
His true duty here was not to guard the dead from the living, but to understand the cosmic patterns that had brought them to this shore. <79>
From his coat pocket, he pulled a short piece of yarn, its fibers the faded blue of a twilight sea. <99>
This was his tool for a traditional craft an old net-mender had taught him: a way of tying knots to divine the ocean's moods. <124>
The elder had called it reading the tides, but Silas had adapted it to his own grim work. <142>
He sought a different kind of market wisdom, not of fish or trade goods, but of the soul's final anchorage. <162>
Was there a rhythm to the arrivals, a predictable surge and ebb in the graveyard's population? <178>
His motivation was a quiet obsession: to map the invisible currents that governed life and death. <194>
His fingers, thick and calloused, began their intricate dance, looping and pulling the yarn with practiced speed. <211>
Each knot was a data point: a storm, a shipwreck, a peaceful passing in a warm bed miles from the waves. <233>
The dignified chaos of the graveyard seemed to focus into the small, complex shape forming in his hands. <251>
He was trying to chart the unchartable, to find logic in the gale-force whims of fate. <267>
As the knot tightened into its final, baffling form, a riddle surfaced in his mind, one he posed to the silent residents around him. <292>
"I have a price but cannot be bought, I have a tide but carry no boat, I have investors who have all lost their lot; what am I?" <322>
The wind offered no answer, only a mournful whistle through a crack in a marble angel's wing. <339>
He looked at the yarn, a tangled glyph representing a hundred forgotten voyages. <352>
The pattern was that there was no single, simple pattern, only an endless, overlapping weave of individual threads. <370>
This was the market's ultimate wisdom: it was a system too vast for any one trader to ever truly master. <390>
A strange peace settled over his frantic mind, the calm at the eye of his personal storm. <407>
He tucked the knotted yarn back into his pocket, a tangible prayer for a question that had no answer. <425>
With a final, grumpy sigh that was almost a form of reverence, Silas turned his collar against the cold and continued his rounds. <448>
The cosmos kept its secrets, and he remained its surly, devoted watchman, waiting for the next season's trade. <467>
