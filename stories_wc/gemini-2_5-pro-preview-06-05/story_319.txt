The frail guard, Elian, watched the sea retreat from the tidal island, his heart a slow, aching drum. <16>
This was the final evening of the sorting, the ceremony where futures were sealed in pigment upon their skin. <33>
His own painted allegiance, the stark grey of the Citadel Wardens, felt like a cage constricting his thin chest. <49>
He was born to be a scholar, not a sentry, and he would do anything to escape this predetermined fate. <67>
His fingers brushed the rough bark of the lone cypress, recalling the messages carved there that had sealed his path. <86>
The secret communications with Anya, a girl sorted to the kitchens, had been their only lifeline. <101>
He clutched the object hidden in his tunic, its glass cool against his trembling fingers. <116>
It was a sour-smelling alchemy phial, a corrosive gift from a disgraced chemist hoping to sow chaos. <133>
Its contents promised to dissolve the Warden's grey, but his resolve was a resolutely wavering thing, a candle flame in the sea wind. <155>
He was terrified, yet he moved with a purpose he hadn't felt in years towards the great hall. <172>
Inside, the air was thick with incense and fear as the last of the youths were branded with their new lives. <193>
Elian slipped through the shadows behind the main dais, his gaze locked on a rusted iron lever set into the stone wall. <213>
He uncorked the phial, the acrid scent stinging his nostrils as he hastily wiped the viscous liquid across the mark on his cheek. <236>
The grey paint sizzled and ran down his skin, leaving it raw and blessedly blank. <251>
This was the moment of no return. <258>
With a guttural cry that was half-terror and half-triumph, he used both hands to yank the lever downwards. <277>
A grinding of stone echoed through the hall as a section of the far wall slid open, revealing the moonlit expanse of the wet sand. <300>
Anya detached from the crowd of the newly sorted, her own face scrubbed clean, and ran towards him. <317>
Together they scrambled through the opening, the shouts of alarm from the sorting ceremony fading behind them. <334>
They ran across the glistening flats, the salty air a balm on Elian's raw face, their bare feet sinking slightly in the mud. <356>
The island and its painted allegiances grew smaller with every step, a prison of fate shrinking into the melancholy twilight. <377>
Ahead lay only an unknown shore and an uncertain future, but for the first time, it was a future they might choose for themselves. <401>
The hope was a fragile warmth against the vast, encroaching dark. <412>
