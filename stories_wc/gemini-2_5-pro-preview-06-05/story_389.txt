The thin-lipped warlock regarded the cavernous space with a proprietary air, his worn boots scuffing softly on stone floors slick with mineral-wept damp. <24> This forgotten library, nestled deep within the guts of an abandoned iron mine, was the perfect venue for his work. <42> He had come here to optimize. <48>

His movements were formally casual, like a tenured professor tidying his desk before a groundbreaking lecture. <64> He unrolled a leather satchel, placing its sole content—a splintered, snarling viking ship figurehead fragment—onto a makeshift altar of stacked tomes. <86> The wood, petrified by salt and time, seemed to drink the lantern light, a lost artifact pulsing with a latent, hungry intelligence. <108> He was here to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite the myriad warnings scrawled in the margins of his sources. <129>

The ritual was scheduled for the exact moment when the final calendar page of the year is flipped, a temporal seam he intended to exploit. <153> Around the figurehead, he arranged the discredited textbooks, their brittle pages detailing rites of cognitive enhancement, methods dismissed by modern cabals as fanciful madness. <179> He found their logic impeccable, their conclusions self-evident. <187> These were not spells but rumored cures for the affliction of mortal ignorance, and he was certain of their efficacy. <207> This confusing certainty was his greatest strength; he knew he was right even as the world screamed he was wrong. <228>

He began the incantation, his voice a low monotone that did not echo but was instead swallowed by the oppressive silence of the deep earth. <251> The words were a framework, a lattice upon which true power would be built. <264> He wasn't summoning a demon or petitioning a god; he was running a diagnostic on reality and preparing to rewrite his own code. <288> The air grew thick and tasted of ozone and ancient sea brine, a phantom scent bleeding from the figurehead. <307> A low hum vibrated up through the soles of his feet, and the carved dragon’s eye, a knot of dark wood, began to glow with a soft, internal fire. <335>

He felt the first tendril of information snake into his mind—not a fact or a secret, but the raw, conceptual structure of a forgotten language. <359> It was agonizing and ecstatic, a perfect paradox of torment and revelation. <371> He smiled, a thin, bloodless line. <377> The warnings were for lesser men, for those who feared the agony and could not appreciate the sublime beauty of the cure. <399> As the hum crescendoed into a silent roar that existed only within his skull, the library, the mine, and the world outside dissolved into a torrent of pure, unfiltered data. <430> He had achieved his optimization, becoming a flawless vessel for a knowledge so vast and so alien it had erased the man he used to be. <454> </story>
