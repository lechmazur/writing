Elara, a vivid dreamer by trade and a thief of cosmic truths by necessity, crept through the silver-dusted rows of the enchanted orchard. <21>
The air, thick with the scent of impossible fruits, was the only thing that didn't hold its breath; the living statues policing the grove were not so generous. <44>
It was all part of the grand, cosmic deception she was determined to unravel, a quest whose sheer audacity always sparked a flicker of dour amusement within her. <69>
She clutched her worn leather pouch, the pressed penny collection inside not souvenirs, but star-charts of realities she’d glimpsed in sleep. <91>
To navigate this place, she had to oscillate between the stark, geometric shadows cast by the gnarled trees. <109>
This was her method, a strange dance she’d perfected by following moon paths only she could perceive. <127>
Her rationally mischievous mind treated it as a game, a way to poke holes in the universe’s stiff formality. <147>
One particular statue, a patient guardian carved like a weeping angel, never turned its head but always seemed to know her location, its stillness a profound threat. <176>
She could almost feel the weight of her brother’s name on her lips, the apology she’d come here to earn the right to speak still lodged in her throat. <206>
He had called her mad, and perhaps he was right, but his dismissal was the very catalyst for this pilgrimage. <226>
The guardian’s unseen gaze felt like a physical pressure, forcing her to flatten herself behind a pear tree that wept glowing sap. <249>
She pulled out a single copper disc, its surface stamped with a spiraling galaxy she’d dreamed of last Tuesday. <269>
It grew warm in her hand, a compass needle for the soul, pointing toward a fissure in the orchard’s manufactured reality. <291>
She had to time her next move perfectly, to oscillate from this shadow to the next just as the moon’s reflection shifted on a puddle of the sap. <321>
It was a ridiculous, high-stakes waltz, and the absurdity of risking obliteration for a truth no one else would believe was almost funny. <345>
The weeping angel’s stony shoulder twitched, a micromovement that screamed imminent pursuit. <358>
Elara took a steadying breath, the apology a silent mantra, a promise she had to keep. <374>
She darted from her cover, not running but flowing with the light, a flicker in the corner of the guardian’s perception. <395>
The air shimmered ahead, a tear in the fabric of the night, and she slipped through it just as the sound of grinding stone echoed behind her. <422>
On the other side, the orchard was the same but fundamentally different, the lie a little thinner here. <439>
She smiled, a grim, tired curl of the lips; the deception was vast, but it was not seamless. <457>
And she, the patient guardian of a forgotten truth, had all the time, and all the pennies, in the world. <478>
