Elias, the finest black market genealogist in the five boroughs, claimed his work was simple research, a statement of brazen modesty given his office was a rented witch's incantation chamber. <words>29</words> His guilt, a constant companion, was the real reason he paid the exorbitant rent; he needed the cloying scent of burnt sage and forgotten spells to scour his conscience. <words>59</words> He sought a path to self-forgiveness, a way to undo the familial line he'd once shattered for a client with too much money and too few morals. <words>88</words> His best ideas often surfaced amid morning walks through the city's waking streets, but the real work happened here, in the chalk-dusted gloom. <words>117</words> On the floor, beside a circle of faded runes, sat a chipped bowl filled with ink-dark water, an artifact left by the landlady and repurposed by Elias for scrying. <words>151</words> Today's penance involved a new, personal project: finding a ghost in his own lineage, a relative erased by shame. <words>176</words> His method was unorthodox, relying on analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies he'd collected over the years. <words>198</words> He believed what wasn't said about the dead screamed louder than what was. <words>211</words> He leaned over his laptop, the screen's glow illuminating the swirling dust motes, and began to zoom in on a scanned document from 1922. <words>240</words> It was a eulogy for a great-grand-aunt, a woman described in atypically typical terms for the eraâ€”praised for her quiet obedience, her seamless domesticity, her utter lack of presence. <words>277</words> The praise was so generic, so hollow, it felt like a carefully constructed dam holding back a flood of truth. <words>299</words> "A devoted sister," the eulogist had written, but the phrasing was stilted, cold. <words>312</words> Elias cross-referenced the date with family letters, his fingers flying across the keyboard. <words>325</words> He found it in a letter from another sibling: "We pray for Eleanor's soul, and for the child she could not keep." <words>347</words> The words hit him not as a revelation, but as a key turning in a lock he'd long forgotten was there. <words>368</words> His great-grand-aunt hadn't been erased for a sin, but had chosen to disappear to protect her child, another branch of the family tree living in secret. <words>400</words> He looked from the screen to the chipped bowl, its imperfection suddenly feeling like a mark of survival, not damage. <words>423</words> He had spent years tracing lines for profit and power, breaking them for the highest bidder, yet here was a story of a line preserved through sacrifice. <words>454</words> A profound quiet settled in the chamber, the guilt receding not into nothingness, but into a manageable, understandable shape. <words>476</words> Standing on the brink of renewal, he finally understood that forgiveness wasn't about erasing the past, but about grafting a new, stronger branch onto it. <words>500</words>
