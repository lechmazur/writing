Elias, who had spent a lifetime watching the unscripted flight of birds, now stood as a silent monument of protest in the leaf classification office. <words>24</words>
His face was hidden behind a mask made from shattered porcelain shards, each piece a memory of a broken promise from a world obsessed with order. <words>49</words>
A braided bitterness coiled in his gut, a familiar serpent he had nurtured since they paved his favorite marsh to build this sterile archive. <words>76</words>
He was anxiously relaxed, a predator waiting for the precise moment to strike, though his prey was not a creature but a concept. <words>101</words>
Then it happened: the cosmic blink, a flicker in the universe’s gaze where the rules of reality momentarily softened. <words>123</words>
This was his chance to assert cosmic chaos as a birthright, to remind the world of the beautiful, untamable wilderness it tried so hard to categorize. <words>152</words>
He began to move, his steps a slow, deliberate dance across the polished marble floor that mirrored the ceiling’s cold, perfect grid. <words>177</words>
He did not touch the towering shelves or the neatly labeled specimen drawers; his method was far more subtle, an act of pure nonviolence. <words>204</words>
Through the ghostlike reflections on the polished marble floor, he projected his will. <words>217</words>
His mirrored form did not simply mimic his movements but warped, twisting into the shapes of wind-battered crags and sprawling, ancient oaks. <words>242</words>
Reflected starlings, silent and spectral, swirled at his feet, their phantom wings brushing against the reflections of the metal filing cabinets. <words>267</words>
The entire office began to kilter. <words>274</words>
Without a sound, a drawer of Quercus rubra specimens slid open, and the dried leaves within lifted, swirling into a gentle vortex. <words>299</words>
Another followed, its Acer saccharum contents joining the silent dance, arranging themselves not by genus or species, but by the memory of an autumn gust. <words>331</words>
The reflections showed a world reborn in beautiful disarray, a forest floor where every fallen leaf was exactly where it was meant to be, without reason. <words>362</words>
The rigid symmetry of the room bled away, replaced by the elegant entropy he had only ever seen in the heart of a true wilderness. <words>391</words>
When the cosmic blink ended, the room was still, but fundamentally changed. <words>404</words>
The leaves were settled, no longer in alphabetical prisons but in patterns of decay and dispersal, a perfect mosaic of chaos. <words>427</words>
Elias stood motionless, his masked gaze taking in the new, wild order he had birthed. <words>443</words>
The serpent of bitterness in his stomach had not vanished, but it was, for a moment, quieted by the profound rightness of it all. <words>469</words>
