Kael tasted the familiar bitterness of nightshade on his tongue, a welcome friend. <words>12</words>
He sat before the subterranean waterfall, its roar a constant, soothing thunder in the vast cavern. <words>26</words>
Beside him, a small radio crackled, broadcasting the desperate pleas of callers to a late-night psychic. <words>42</words>
These frantic, fragmented stories were his true work, the raw data he used to map the world’s hidden energy flows. <words>61</words>
His employers, a society so secret it had no name, believed these ley lines of emotion were the source of all power. <words>82</words>
Kael, however, just wanted to find the one that would finally unmake him. <words>96</words>
A woman was weeping on the air now, talking about a lost love, her voice a spike of pure, agonizing energy on his psychic map. <words>121</words>
It was the final piece of the puzzle. <words>129</words>
In the center of the grotto, a massive ice sculpture of a coiled serpent began to groan, its crystalline structure failing. <words>150</words>
He had timed the poison perfectly to peak in the final second before its collapse. <words>165</words>
This moment of serene upheaval, of simultaneous creation and destruction, was the only place the binding would hold. <words>184</words>
He pulled a simple cloth bookmark from his pocket, its frayed edges soft against his cold fingers. <words>201</words>
It was hers, the last thing she had ever touched. <words>211</words>
The radio psychic’s voice was a low murmur, but the caller’s grief was a scream that Kael could see, a shimmering thread of light converging on this exact point in space and time. <words>248</words>
His movements were slow, deliberate, and strangely compelling against the backdrop of the roaring water and cracking ice. <words>268</words>
He had to bind this flow, to anchor the chaotic energy of loss to a single, physical point. <words>286</words>
With a steady hand, he tied the bookmark around a smooth, dark stone at his feet, knotting the fabric tight. <words>306</words>
The action felt monumental, a final, quiet rebellion against the very fabric of existence. <words>321</words>
He wasn't just mapping the energy for his hidden society; he was redirecting it, creating a permanent void where the flow should be. <words>346</words>
A sanctuary of nothingness, just for him. <words>354</words>
The serpent’s head fractured, a web of cracks spreading in an instant. <words>366</words>
The poison surged, a cold fire spreading through his veins, and for the first time in years, Kael felt a flicker of profound peace. <words>392</words>
As the ice sculpture imploded, showering the cavern in a billion glittering shards, the knot on the bookmark glowed with a soft, impossible light before fading to black. <words>423</words>
The roar of the waterfall consumed the crash, and Kael closed his eyes, finally anchored to the stillness he had so desperately craved. <words>447</words>
