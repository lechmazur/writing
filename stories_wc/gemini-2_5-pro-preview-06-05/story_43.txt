The age of man had ended not with a bang, but with the final period on the last written page. <words>19</words>
I was a footnote, a wary explorer in the silence that followed. <words>31</words>
My only map was the pulse of fireflies, tiny green sparks I traced through the thick fog that carpeted the floor of the neon cathedral. <words>55</words>
This place was a monument to a faith long dead, its vaulted ceilings now ribbed with humming tubes of pink and blue light that did little to pierce the gloom. <words>85</words>
I came here to meander, to lose myself in the vast, echoing quiet. <words>98</words>
My heavy boots and the rhythmic clank of my gear were the only percussion in this dead sanctuary, a loud announcement of my deeply introverted soul. <words>126</words>
Each step was a question I didn't know how to ask, a search for something I had misplaced so long ago it felt like a phantom limb. <words>154</words>
My motivation was a selfish one, a desperate attempt to spark an unexpected reunion with my own courage. <words>173</words>
It had fled years back, leaving me hollowed out and perpetually cautious. <words>185</words>
My gloved fingers fumbled inside my coat, closing around the sharp, cracked edges of a damaged music CD. <words>204</words>
This was one of my emblems of courage, a worthless plastic disc that held the ghost of a song from a time when I was brave. <words>233</words>
The fireflies swirled ahead, their blinking a silent invitation deeper into the nave. <words>247</words>
They gathered around the base of what was once an altar, now just a concrete block bathed in the glitching purple glow of a shattered holographic projector. <words>277</words>
The fog coiled around my ankles as I knelt, the cold seeping through my trousers. <words>293</words>
I held the CD up, its fractured surface catching the artificial light and scattering it like broken promises. <words>313</words>
There was no player, no way to hear the music, but I didn't need to. <words>327</words>
The memory of the thunderous, defiant guitar riff was seared into my mind, a soundtrack to a forgotten act of bravery I could barely believe was my own. <words>358</words>
A breath I hadn't realized I was holding escaped my lips in a shaky, visible plume. <words>374</words>
It wasn't a triumphant roar of rediscovered valor, but something much smaller and more fragile. <words>390</words>
It was a crooked hope, bent but not broken, like the light glinting off the damaged disc. <words>409</words>
The reunion was not a celebration, but a quiet, solemn nod between my present self and the ghost of who I had been. <words>432</words>
I tucked the emblem back into my pocket, its familiar jaggedness a small comfort. <words>446</words>
Rising to my feet, I continued my wandering, the fireflies once again my guide through the beautiful, lonely dark. <words>466</words>
My steps were still wary, but they no longer felt quite so heavy. <words>479</words>
