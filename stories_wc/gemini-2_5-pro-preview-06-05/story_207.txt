Kael, a peddler by trade and by nature forthright, sat alone in the abandoned medical bay, a place where ghosts of healing still clung to the sterile air. <words>26</words>
The universe hummed its secret song around the station, a low thrum of cosmic dust and dying stars that was the only music he ever needed. <words>51</words>
In his hands, he cradled a dried flower bouquet, its fragile petals a defiant splash of ancient Earth-color against the stark white and chrome. <words>76</words>
This was the reason he was here, the final piece of a puzzle he had to solve to walk redemption's path. <words>97</words>
He was here to break an oath sealed in blood, a vow made in foolish youth that had chained two souls together in shared misery for decades. <words>126</words>
A soft, joyful loneliness enveloped him; the solitude was a balm, the purpose a quiet thrill. <words>142</words>
He placed the bouquet carefully on an examination table and turned to a dusty holographic terminal, its screen flickering to life at his touch. <words>167</words>
His work began, a delicate and tedious process. <words>176</words>
He started to sift through rumor-laden gossip columns from the old galactic networks, archives of whispers and scandals from the year the oath was sworn. <words>205</words>
"They say the heiress of Cygnus X-1 vanished with a star-sailor," one headline blared, a dead end. <words>223</words>
"A mining baron's son, disowned after a bloody pact," another whispered, closer to the mark. <words>240</words>
Kael worked with a meekly assertive focus, his fingers flying across the console, his quiet demeanor belying the fierce determination driving him. <words>266</words>
He wasn't just reading; he was hunting for the one verifiable fact buried in a mountain of lies, the key to finding the other signatory. <words>293</words>
Hours bled into a timeless cycle of scan, dismiss, and scan again, the universal hum his only companion. <words>313</words>
Then, he found it: a single, authenticated transport log hidden in the metadata of a society columnist's post about a scandalous elopement. <words>339</words>
It was her name, Elara, and her destinationâ€”a forgotten monastery on a moon called Sanctuary's Rest. <words>357</words>
A slow, genuine smile spread across Kael's face. <words>366</words>
He stood and returned to the bouquet, his movements now full of gentle ceremony. <words>381</words>
With the utmost care, he began to divide the brittle stems and faded blossoms, separating the single arrangement into two perfect, smaller halves. <words>408</words>
One half he left on the console, a promise fulfilled in a dead place, a splash of life for the ghosts. <words>430</words>
The other he tucked securely inside his worn coat, a token of freedom to be delivered. <words>448</words>
He walked out of the medical bay, the joyful loneliness now alight with the bright, clear dawn of his final journey. <words>471</words>
The universe hummed on, but now he could finally hear the melody. <words>483</words>
