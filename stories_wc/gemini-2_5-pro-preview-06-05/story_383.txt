The burnt-out general sat hunched in a booth at the Dark Matter Diner, a place that hummed with the energy of things that weren't quite there. <26>
He was between rides, a euphemism for being between lives, and the air itself felt thick with the shared anxieties of a thousand other transient souls. <51>
His current mission, a personal campaign waged after a thousand failed galactic ones, was to dethrone fear from the throne of reason. <73>
A cosmic tyrant, fear, had made a mockery of his strategies for centuries, and the general was tired of its reign. <94>
He ignored the shimmering menu and instead unwrapped a brittle, salty piece of dried seaweed from his pocket, a relic from a water-logged world he barely remembered. <126>
It tasted of simple truth, a concept he desperately needed to reclaim. <139>
From another pocket, he produced a stack of old black-and-white photographs, their corners soft with wear. <157>
No epic battles or decorated heroes graced their surfaces; they were studies in simplicity. <172>
The first showed the perfect parabola of water from a garden hose. <183>
The second captured the gentle curve of a sleeping cat's spine. <194>
The third, a child's triumphant swing arcing towards the sky. <204>
His method was, he knew, rationally absurd: to renew his burnt-out soul via these captured moments. <222>
He believed that every pure action, every cause-and-effect untainted by panic, followed a clean and perfect arc. <241>
Fear did not create arcs; it created jagged lines, chaotic scribbles, and paralyzing full stops. <257>
The low hum of the diner was the sound of those scribbles, the collective static of worry from every patron drifting through the void. <282>
He traced the arc of the water with his finger, feeling the cool, smooth logic of its flight. <299>
He followed the curve of the cat, a line of absolute peace. <311>
He felt the upward sweep of the swing, a trajectory of pure, unthinking joy. <325>
With each traced line, a little of the static in his own mind cleared, the tight knot of command-fatigue loosening its grip. <348>
This wasn't about forgetting the horrors he'd witnessed, but about remembering the universe's underlying grammar, a language that fear could only mimic, never truly speak. <378>
He was recalibrating his reason, tuning it back to the fundamental frequencies of existence itself. <394>
A slow, mischievous grin spread across his face, the first in ages. <406>
He popped the last of the dried seaweed into his mouth, the crunch a satisfyingly simple sound. <423>
Leaving the photographs fanned out on the table like a tarot spread for the next weary traveler, he stood up, feeling lighter. <446>
His throne was his own mind, and the coup was quietly, absurdly, complete. <459>
The next ride was waiting. <464>
