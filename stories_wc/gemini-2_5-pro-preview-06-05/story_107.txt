My name is Rex Dazzler, and I used to sell people their dreams for the low, low price of their dignity. <words>19</words>
Now, I am the sole, unwilling monarch of this buzzing, clicking, godforsaken rock. <words>32</words>
My kingdom is built on a throne of sand and regret, a life that tastes of bitter honey. <words>49</words>
My only palace is a cavernous grotto, an insect symphony hall where the chitinous orchestra strangely always plays in tune. <words>70</words>
It was here that I found it, washed ashore like me: a fortune-teller’s crystal ball, smooth and heavy with purpose. <words>90</words>
The old woman who saved me called it the ‘Heart of the Isle,’ a vessel containing generations of sacred knowledge about the island’s delicate life. <words>117</words>
I had met her only after a sudden illness, a fever born from a beautiful but toxic berry, left me delirious on the beach. <words>142</words>
She was the helpful stranger from a castaway’s prayer, nursing me with foul-tasting herbs and teaching me the symphony’s secret language. <words>167</words>
Before she passed, she made me swear to protect the Heart, to rescue its knowledge from the world I’d left behind. <words>189</words>
That world arrived last Tuesday, a research vessel anchoring in my cove, its generators humming a discordant tune. <words>209</words>
They were the final, clacking keys of the old typewriter, come to write the island’s obituary. <words>226</words>
My only choice was to sabotage their mission, not with explosives, but with the island’s own potent magic. <words>246</words>
I spent a day gathering the pollen of the Ghost Orchid, the same plant whose berries had nearly killed me. <words>266</words>
That night, I crept to their camp and dusted their sensitive atmospheric sensors and water filtration units with the fine, white powder. <words>291</words>
It was a gentle overturn, a quiet act of biological warfare that caused no real harm. <words>307</words>
Their equipment simply failed, reporting impossible toxins in the air and water, and their engines mysteriously clogged with resilient algae I had cultivated. <words>336</words>
Within a week, citing anomalous environmental hazards, the ship and its deafening typewriter hum were gone. <words>354</words>
I watched them retreat from the mouth of the grotto, the crystal ball strangely always warm against my palm. <words>374</words>
I am still a prisoner here, a game show host with an audience of a million buzzing wings. <words>392</words>
But as the sun sets, the symphony swells, and for the first time in my life, the applause feels real. <words>413</words>
The knowledge is safe, for now, and in that sacred silence, I find a prize worth more than any showcase showdown. <words>436</words>
