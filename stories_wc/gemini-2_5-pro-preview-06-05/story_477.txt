Kael moved through the drowned arboretum with the lethal poise of a striking viper, his every step a silent rebellion. <18>
This forgotten city garden, submerged beneath the glass-domed sea, was the only place his soul could breathe. <33>
Above, the ever-present, synthesized bird songs chirped a maddeningly cheerful tune, a constant reminder of the Unity’s enforced serenity. <51>
He sought to escape this world where individuality is suppressed, a world he would shatter or flee. <68>
His workshop was a testament to a mindfully scattered genius: a chaotic nest of wires, cracked screens, and salvaged motherboards. <87>
Here, he would innovate. <91>
His grand project, a magnificent astronomy telescope scavenged from the Old World observatory, was grotesquely fused with the guts of a dozen broken television sets. <118>
He was not searching for stars, but for a way out. <129>
His method was a lucid frenzy of intuition and desperation, by scavenging for cosmic signals in broken TVs that once broadcasted Unity’s lies. <154>
He believed a whisper of true freedom, a signal from beyond their controlled sphere, was hidden in the static between worlds. <175>
His hands, trained to wield a blade with impossible grace, now danced across soldering points and frequency dials. <193>
For weeks, the only response was the hiss of the void and the incessant chirping from the dome’s speakers. <211>
Then, one shimmering afternoon, a pulse echoed through his headphones, a clear, rhythmic beat unlike anything he had ever heard. <232>
A manic grin split his face as he swiveled the great telescope, aligning its lens with the signal’s faint origin point. <253>
He fine-tuned the receivers, the broken TVs flickering to life not with images, but with waves of pure data. <272>
This was it, the key, the path to a place where a man could be more than a cog. <291>
He fed the signal back into the garden’s local network, hoping to overload the gate controls and create an opening. <312>
But the unforeseen consequences of his desperate act were immediate and horrifying. <324>
The rhythmic pulse he’d mistaken for a cosmic beacon was not an invitation, but a diagnostic heartbeat. <341>
He had not found a signal from the stars; he had tapped into the core frequency of the Unity’s own planetary suppression grid. <364>
His device, intended as a key, had become an amplifier. <374>
Suddenly, the cheerful bird songs faltered, replaced by a piercing, invasive tone that vibrated in his very bones. <394>
The air thickened, and the vibrant, impossible colors of the underwater flora began to fade into a uniform, oppressive grey. <415>
His mind, once a scattered sanctuary of rebellion, felt a cold, orderly calm descend upon it, smoothing away the frantic edges of his identity. <441>
The graceful swordsman stood perfectly still, his motivation erased, his escape attempt having forged the final, perfect link in his own cage. <464>
He was now just another part of the garden, listening mindlessly to the birds. <478>
