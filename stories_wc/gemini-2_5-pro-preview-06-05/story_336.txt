The car backfired, a single crack in the street's deep silence. <words>11</words>
Inside the Grand Ossuary, a reimagined Persian palace of marble and echoing space, the weary undertaker Kaelen did not flinch. <words>29</words>
He was long past surprise, his placid ferocity a shield forged over decades of tending to both the dead and their lingering shadows. <words>52</words>
Tonight's shadow was older, a formless despair that bled from the world's unravelling seams. <words>67</words>
His motivation was simple: to hold onto hope in the absolute dark, even if he was the only one left tending the flame. <words>91</words>
He turned to the heart of the sanctum, a colossal astronomical clock of brass and blued steel. <words>108</words>
Its thousand gears and dials were a map not of time, but of containment. <words>122</words>
Kaelenâ€™s fingers traced the constellations etched into its face, recalling the tribal knowledge passed down through his lineage of guardians. <words>144</words>
It was a legacy of star-charts and solar alignments, a science so ancient it was rarely practical in an age of digital clocks and electric lights. <words>171</words>
Yet, it was the only thing that worked against the encroaching emptiness. <words>183</words>
The clock confirmed the moment was now, the precise alignment when the coming dawn could be weaponized. <words>200</words>
His task was not to bury, but to imprison. <words>209</words>
He began his work by following sun paths, or rather, the memory of them that preceded the light itself. <words>229</words>
His feet, clad in soft leather shoes, moved in a silent, deliberate dance across the mosaic floor, following an invisible geometry only he could perceive. <words>255</words>
Each step was a verse in a prayer of physics, a placement of will against encroaching nihilism. <words>273</words>
The air grew heavy, thick with a cold that had nothing to do with the morning temperature. <words>290</words>
Whispers of failure, of futility, of the sweet release of giving up, coiled in the vast, dark corners of the hall. <words>312</words>
Kaelen ignored them, his focus narrowed to the high, alabaster window in the eastern dome. <words>329</words>
He knelt at the final locus point, a tile depicting a stylized phoenix, just as the first sliver of sunlight pierced the gloom. <words>352</words>
The beam shot across the hall, a spear of pure dawn, striking a series of polished silver discs he had placed along the path. <words>376</words>
Light ricocheted, weaving a cage of brilliance that converged on the very center of the chamber. <words>394</words>
A silent, psychic scream echoed and then vanished as the trap snapped shut. <words>407</words>
The oppressive cold receded, replaced by the neutral air of an empty building. <words>421</words>
Kaelen rose slowly, his joints aching with a familiar exhaustion. <words>431</words>
The sun now streamed freely into the Ossuary, illuminating dust motes dancing in the quiet air. <words>447</words>
He had won, for now. <words>452</words>
He straightened his dark tie, his duty done, ready to face a day of ordinary grief. <words>467</words>
