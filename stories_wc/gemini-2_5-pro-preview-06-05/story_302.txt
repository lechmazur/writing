The tuneless bard, Kael, lounged in a velvet chair, the airship dining room's brass-and-mahogany opulence a stark contrast to his worn leather coat. <words>24</words> A dandy in a powdered wig was reciting odes to a cogwheel, his voice a monotonous drone amid the gentle hum of the dirigible's engines. <words>49</words> Kael ignored him, his gaze fixed on the swirling clouds visible through the grand porthole, a fiercely nonchalant expression masking his true purpose. <words>74</words> He was here to kiss the horizon of madness, and this gilded cage, floating miles above the earth, was the perfect stage. <words>97</words> Whispers followed him, of course, twisted word-of-mouth legends that painted him as a sorcerer who sang storms into existence. <words>121</words> The truth, he felt, was far more interesting and required a certain brazen humility to pursue. <words>138</words> When the cogwheel poet finally bowed to polite, restrained applause, the host announced Kael's name with a nervous flourish. <words>160</words> Kael sauntered to the front, not with a lute, but with a heavy, stained manuscript clutched in one hand. <words>180</words> Its pages were blotched with ink, wine, and something that looked suspiciously like scorch marks. <words>196</words> He opened it, and instead of a melody, a low, guttural chant filled the room, a rhythmic prose that spoke of unmaking and the beautiful anarchy of a flame. <words>231</words> The polished silverware seemed to vibrate on the tables, and the gaslights flickered in time with his discordant cadence. <words>253</words> This was his art: not music, but the careful, deliberate taming of chaos through spoken word. <words>271</words> The passengers leaned forward, their boredom replaced by a primal, electric fear. <words>284</words> His voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, speaking of the thin veil between order and oblivion. <words>301</words> "True creation," he murmured, his eyes sweeping across the terrified, mesmerized faces, "is not about building, but about what you choose not to burn." <words>330</words> With a fluid motion, he produced a small, brass tinderbox from his coat pocket. <words>344</words> A collective gasp sucked the air from the cabin; the ship was a fragile bubble of hydrogen and hope. <words>364</words> He held it up, letting the moment stretch, the absolute pandemonium he could unleash held between his thumb and forefinger. <words>386</words> Then, with a click, he struck the flint, producing a single, brilliant spark that flared for an instant before dying in the opulent air. <words>413</words> He snapped the tinderbox shut. <words>418</words> A profound silence descended, heavier than any applause. <words>426</words> Kael offered a slight bow, a gesture not of pride but of acknowledgement for the abyss he had allowed them to glimpse. <words>449</words> He had shown them the edge, and in pulling back, had made the world feel solid again. <words>467</words>
