Leo dealt the final hand with a practiced smile, the clinking of chips a familiar chorus at his annual fundraiser. <words>19</words>
Everyone knew him as the amiable gambler, a man whose luck was matched only by his generosity during these well-attended charity drives. <words>41</words>
But later, far from the city's glow, he walked through the pulsing twilight of the firefly breeding grounds, a sanctuary where his true work began. <words>69</words>
He sat on a fallen log, the air soft and warm, and opened the vintage ledger. <words>84</words>
Its brittle pages held the last true history of Aeridor, his lost kingdom, and the names of the families who had scattered its people to the winds. <words>113</words>
A peaceful anger, cold and constant as a river stone, settled in his chest as he traced the faded ink. <words>133</words>
This was his singular, mild obsession: not the cards, but the slow, righteous act of restoration. <words>150</words>
He had mastered the art of unbecoming, shedding the skin of a forgotten prince to become this charming rogue. <words>171</words>
It was a necessary transformation, for only from this position could he begin to hydrolyze the foundations of his enemies. <words>193</words>
Each charity drive was a tool, siphoning wealth from the descendants of the usurpers, using their own avarice as the water to dissolve their power. <words>224</words>
He conducted this campaign via the way petals fall from a flower; a quiet, beautiful, and inexorable decay. <words>244</words>
First, a shipping contract would mysteriously fail, then a political alliance would sour, then a family's reputation would tarnish from a whispered rumor he had carefully planted. <words>278</words>
Each was a single petal drifting to the ground, unnoticed by all but him. <words>293</words>
The fireflies blinked around him, thousands of tiny, hopeful lanterns in the immense dark. <words>308</words>
They did not burn with rage, but with a quiet, living light, a reflection of the feeling that fueled him. <words>330</words>
He was not rebuilding Aeridor with swords and banners, but with patience and pressure. <words>345</words>
He was unmaking its destroyers so that his kingdom could one day become again. <words>360</words>
Closing the ledger, he felt the weight of his purpose settle not as a burden, but as an anchor. <words>380</words>
His gaze fell upon the next name on his list, the next magnificent flower he would patiently, lovingly, dismantle. <words>401</words>
He stood up, brushed the dirt from his trousers, and began the walk back toward the city lights, his amiable smile already forming. <words>426</words>
Another charity gala was only a week away, and another petal was ready to fall. <words>442</words>
