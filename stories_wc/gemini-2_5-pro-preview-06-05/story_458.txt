The dust of the abandoned spaceport baggage claim tasted of rust and forgotten departures. <words>13</words>
I, last pilot of the flying library *Mnemosyne*, sat on a motionless carousel, the silence a heavy cloak. <words>29</words>
My motivation was simple, a desperate need to preserve a fading tradition of shared, physical knowledge in a fractured galaxy. <words>49</words>
This derelict terminal, a graveyard of journeys, was the only place quiet enough for the ritual. <words>65</words>
My belief system was spiritually secular, finding patterns of meaning not in gods, but in the universe’s quiet coincidences. <words>84</words>
So I stared into the dregs of my cup, preparing to make a choice by reading the future in coffee stains. <words>105</words>
The bitter grounds swirled into a map of what was to come, a forked path of terrible possibilities. <words>123</words>
My thumb worried the detached coat button I kept in my pocket, a smooth, cool disc of bone from my mentor’s uniform. <words>146</words>
He had believed the library was the bridge to unity, a way to connect the scattered worlds through stories. <words>165</words>
Now, a splinter fleet offered me a chance to rebuild, to restore the Librarians to their former glory. <words>183</words>
Their message blinked on my datapad, waiting, poised in the second a simple yes or no can change everything. <words>203</words>
But their unity was a lie, a conquest veiled in pretty words. <words>215</words>
The coffee stains told a story of fire, of my books and ship twisted into a weapon. <words>232</words>
A deep, fractal sorrow bloomed in my chest, each sharp edge of grief reflecting another, smaller one. <words>249</words>
I saw their fleet, their followers, their false bridge built on the ashes of worlds. <words>264</words>
The stains showed me their target: a specific stellar cartography archive within the *Mnemosyne*, a map to a forgotten superweapon. <words>286</words>
And then, I saw the only true path forward. <words>296</words>
It was not to join them, nor was it to flee. <words>307</words>
The future demanded a sacrifice. <words>312</words>
It required me to obliterate that section of the archive entirely. <words>323</words>
To burn my own books, to tear down a piece of the bridge to save its soul. <words>341</words>
The incoming transmission pinged, insistent. <words>346</words>
"Librarian," the voice crackled, "do you accept our terms? Yes or no?" <words>359</words>
I looked from the blinking light of the datapad to the dark, fractured starburst in my cup. <words>377</words>
The sorrow was a part of me now, but so was the clarity it brought. <words>392</words>
I keyed the comms. <words>396</words>
"No." <words>397</words>
My other hand flew across a different console, initiating the wipe sequence. <words>409</words>
A part of my history, a part of the tradition, turned to unsalvageable data-screech. <words>423</words>
In the echoing silence of the baggage claim, I had chosen the lonelier path, the truer unity. <words>440</words>
