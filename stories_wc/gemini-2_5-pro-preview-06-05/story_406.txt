The old witch's potion brewery was quiet, the only sound the soft thud of the morning paper landing on an empty porch. <words>20</words> Silas, a spy so coy he could charm secrets from a stone, watched from the shadows, his presence a whisper against the dawn. <words>40</words> He was here for one reason: to become a master of disguise, and the witch Morwen held the key in a bubbling cauldron. <words>61</words> Morwen was a diabolically benevolent creature, her aid always tangled in a web of perilous, character-building tests. <words>79</words> This time, her price was mended fences, a literal and magical barrier he had to restore to regain her trust after a past misstep. <words>102</words> He adjusted his collar, a flicker of borrowed valor in his eyes that faltered as his thumb brushed against a loose button on his cuff. <words>126</words> Such a small imperfection could unravel the entire performance. <words>135</words> Morwen's note, left under a toadstool, had been simple: to fix the fence, he would have to bypass its creation. <words>155</words> The only way to do that was through reversed time, a feat possible only by drinking the shimmering, volatile liquid she'd left beside the note. <words>179</words> He uncorked the vial, the potion smelling of ozone and regret, and drank it in a single, desperate swallow. <words>198</words> The world dissolved into a chaotic smear of color and sound, then snapped violently backward. <words>212</words> He saw Morwen's hands, gnarled and powerful, weaving shimmering threads of light into a protective ward across the broken gate. <words>232</words> Each thread was a note in a complex chord, a pattern impossible to perceive in linear progression. <words>249</words> As time rewound, he saw the sequence of her spell, the gaps she left, the anchors she tied to the ancient wood. <words>271</words> He was an observer outside the stream, a ghost watching a memory unfold. <words>283</words> The reversal slowed, and just as her hands began their work, time lurched forward again at its normal pace. <words>302</words> Now, standing before the broken fence, he saw not splintered wood but the ghost-image of her spell. <words>318</words> With movements learned from the rewind, his fingers danced in the air, plucking the invisible threads she had woven. <words>337</words> He didn't break them; he reinforced them, tying off the loose ends he had witnessed her create, completing the pattern with the knowledge he shouldn't have. <words>363</words> The air hummed, and the shattered planks of the fence lifted and seamlessly knitted themselves back together, stronger than before. <words>384</words> The brewery door creaked open, and Morwen smiled, her eyes glinting with that terrible, wonderful benevolence. <words>400</words> He had not just bypassed her ward; he had understood and perfected it, the truest form of apology. <words>417</words> Silas tugged at his cuff, the loose button a sudden, sharp reminder of the man he was versus the master he was trying to be. <words>442</words> She handed him a new vial, this one swirling with the faces of strangers, the ultimate tool for his craft, now truly earned. <words>464</words> He had mended more than just a fence today. <words>473</words>
