The agency called him Sir Kaelan, a cold-natured knight whose armor was a tailored suit and whose quests were sanctioned assassinations. <words>19</words>
Tonight, however, his mission was his own, a lawfully rebellious act of personal desperation. <words>32</words>
He stood at the hush of a deserted intersection, the city’s late-night breath fogging the air around him. <words>49</words>
His motivation was simple and agonizing: to collect folk remedies for a ghost the agency’s doctors couldn’t exorcise from his sister’s lungs. <words>73</words>
The agency’s vast network provided the unwitting support for his search, funneling him intel from a fractured chain of informants. <words>94</words>
He was here to retrieve the next piece of the puzzle, a data fragment from one of the network’s incomplete family altars—digital dead drops disguised as memorials. <words>125</words>
A flicker of color on the wet asphalt snagged his attention. <words>135</words>
It was a child’s lost mitten, small and red, with a single white snowflake stitched imperfectly on its back. <words>154</words>
He bent down, his gloved fingers tracing the coarse yarn, a texture so alien to his world of sterile steel and cold data. <words>178</words>
The intersection remained silent, a vacuum waiting for the exchange, but Kaelan’s focus had been stolen. <words>197</words>
He saw not just a lost object, but the careful, loving loops of the knit, the slight asymmetry of the snowflake, the ghost of a small hand held within. <words>231</words>
It was a composition of flawed, earnest beauty. <words>239</words>
A car slid to the curb, its headlights off. <words>248</words>
The contact, a nervous man in a heavy coat, slid a data chip across the hood without a word. <words>267</words>
Kaelan pocketed the chip containing the remedy data, but his other hand closed tightly around the small, woolen treasure. <words>287</words>
He gave a curt nod, the transaction complete, yet the true exchange had happened moments before with the silent pavement. <words>309</words>
Back within the stark, brutalist walls of the secret agent center, the chip felt weightless and abstract. <words>326</words>
He plugged it in, the information downloading in sterile green text, another desperate recipe of herbs and hope. <words>345</words>
But his gaze kept returning to the red mitten he’d placed on his desk. <words>359</words>
This felt more real, more potent than any digital cure. <words>369</words>
It was a story of warmth in a cold world, a testament to simple creation. <words>383</words>
In that moment, his artistic awakening began, a quiet rebellion against the void he inhabited. <words>398</words>
He opened a secure tablet, bypassed the mission logs, and began to sketch the mitten’s form, capturing not just its image, but the feeling it had given him. <words>429</words>
The lines were clumsy at first, but they were his, a new kind of remedy for a sickness he hadn't known he had. <words>452</words>
