Elara hummed a tuneless, cheerful dirge as she pruned the glowing crimson apples. <12>
Her orchard was a defiant jewel box of life set against the endless gray of the wasteland, a joke she told the sky with every radioactive dust storm she weathered. <38>
It had been years since the old record player in the bunker had scratched its last tune, taking the final notes of the old world with it, and the silence had been her primary motivation ever since. <76>
"Right then," she chirped to a mutated bluebird, "no more half-measures." <87>
Inside her lead-lined shelter, she retrieved the stained glass box from its niche. <101>
Light from a nutrient-paste-fueled lamp fractured through the colored panes, casting fleeting rainbows on her calloused hands. <119>
She was tenuously certain this would work; a conviction as fragile as the glass she held. <135>
With a click, she opened the lid, the scent of ozone and forgotten perfume rising to meet her. <152>
Nestled inside on faded velvet was not a treasure, but a man's drab, threadbare suit, a relic of the person she was supposed to have been. <177>
Her focus, however, was on the small, sequined patch sewn clumsily onto its lapel, the remnant of a once-sparkling costume from a life before the fall. <206>
This was the courage to confess she had rehearsed in the silence for a decade: a truth not of love, but of self. <229>
The world didn't just need color; it needed the vibrant, unapologetic life that had been scoured away and deemed frivolous. <250>
She scraped a fingernail against the patch, collecting the residue of glitter, a faint dust of holographic potential. <269>
Her plan was to use this remnant of defiant glamour, this ghost of sparkle, to finally feminize the grim reflection that stared back at her from the polished metal wall. <302>
She mixed the glitter with her own saliva and a drop of sap from a glowing plum, creating a shimmering paste. <323>
With steady fingers, she began to draw new lines on her face, to soften the hard jawline, to arch the brows that had only ever known how to furrow in determination. <355>
It was a desperate, headstrong act of magic, painting a new reality onto the old. <370>
Outside, the wind began to howl, whipping radioactive dust against the shelter's door. <383>
She ignored it, her focus absolute as she completed the final, shimmering stroke across her lips. <400>
A strange warmth spread through her, a current of forgotten energy, as if the glitter remembered how to shine. <419>
Stepping outside, Elara faced the storm, her newly painted face a beacon against the swirling gray. <435>
And for the first time, the toxic dust seemed to catch her light, swirling around her in faint, prismatic eddies of color. <457>
She smiled, a bitter, beautiful, and merry expression, ready to teach this dead world how to be alive again. <477>
