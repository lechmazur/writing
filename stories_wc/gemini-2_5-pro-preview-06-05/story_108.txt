The minstrel’s fingers twitched over the lute, a discordant echo of the vexation in their soul. <words>16</words>
Before them, at the heart of the falling star collection point, the crowd was a writhing, shrieking beast, clawing for the celestial embers that dusted the cratered ground. <words>43</words>
It was a madness that grated on the minstrel’s nerves, a cacophony they were motivated to hush by any means necessary. <words>63</words>
This chaotic scramble for light was a stain upon the tapestry of fate, a thread they felt compelled to snip. <words>82</words>
A sudden, wicked idea bloomed in their mind, a move both strategically spontaneous and deeply satisfying. <words>98</words>
It was sparked by a memory of their family tradition: annually watching that old black-and-white film where the villain pacifies a mob with a hypnotic drone. <words>128</words>
A thin smile played on the minstrel’s lips, a perfect mask of coy malevolence. <words>142</words>
Their hand slipped into a coat pocket, fingers closing around a confiscated spy gadget pen, lifted from a clumsy agent weeks ago. <words>165</words>
The crowd’s frenzy reached a fever pitch as a particularly large star fragment skittered across the basin, its light raw and wild. <words>188</words>
This was the perfect moment of distraction. <words>195</words>
The minstrel clicked the top of the pen, not to write, but to activate its true function. <words>213</words>
A low, sub-audible frequency began to radiate from the device, a silent command piercing the din. <words>230</words>
It was a signal that called to the sky, not for stars, but for something else entirely. <words>246</words>
From the crater’s rim, a thick, pearlescent mist began to roll inwards, swallowing the starlight and the screams. <words>266</words>
These were the true gifts of the fog, not the fleeting sparks of dying suns, but confusion and quietude. <words>287</words>
Whispers slithered through the mist, promises of personal constellations and silent galaxies meant for one person alone. <words>306</words>
Each member of the mob stopped, their eyes glazing over as they became lost in their own private, foggy cosmos. <words>327</words>
The frantic greed evaporated, replaced by a placid, mesmerized stillness. <words>339</words>
The madness was hushed. <words>343</words>
The minstrel began to play a soft, haunting melody on their lute, the notes weaving through the fog like a serpent, guiding the illusions. <words>368</words>
They watched the silent, entranced figures, each one trapped in a beautiful, lonely dream of their own making. <words>387</words>
The air, once electric with chaos, was now heavy with a serene and terrible peace. <words>402</words>
It was a masterpiece of crowd control, a performance far more potent than any song. <words>417</words>
The minstrel savored the silence, a small, cruel smile their only applause in the starlit dark. <words>434</words>
Their work here, a dark harmony played within the grander symphony of fate, was done. <words>449</words>
