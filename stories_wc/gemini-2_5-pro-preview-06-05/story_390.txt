Mei, the court's most placid assassin, adjusted the screw on her botanical press. <words>12</words>
The heavy rosewood device sat incongruously on a silk pillow, a tool of gentle preservation in a room humming with imminent judgment. <words>31</words>
Outside her screen, the Imperial ministers were assembling, their rustling robes a prelude to the Emperor's morning audience. <words>48</words>
Her work had to be finished before the first question is asked, a timeframe both absolute and, to her, amusingly theatrical. <words>69</words>
For weeks, she had gathered the whispers of longing that clung to the palace's moon-orchids like a fine, desperate pollen. <words>89</words>
These were not mere metaphors for sadness; they were figuratively literal sighs, a tangible ache in the air that she could collect on petals. <words>114</words>
The Emperor believed the Grand Seer’s prophecy of his eternal dynasty was as fixed as the stars. <words>132</words>
Mei, however, had been hired to spin that prophecy into raw possibility, a far more delicate task than simply ending a life. <words>155</words>
Her client, a consortium of hopeful merchants, had paid in rare silks and a single, priceless diagram. <words>172</words>
She began to arrange the sigh-dusted petals inside the press, her fingers moving with unhurried grace. <words>188</words>
Her guide was not some arcane text but a far more elegant schematic: the pattern of a butterfly's wings. <words>208</words>
Specifically, the Azure Dragonwing, a creature said to navigate between the world of what is and what could be. <words>228</words>
Each petal was a point of data, a nexus of yearning for a different future. <words>243</words>
With a soft grunt of effort that seemed entirely out of place, she began to turn the press's handle. <words>262</words>
Her goal was to amalgamate the disparate desires, the collected whispers, and the latent magic of the orchids into a single, coherent force. <words>286</words>
A faint, shimmering sound, like a thousand tiny chimes, filled the small chamber. <words>299</words>
On a nearby table, a scroll depicting the Emperor's unassailable future flickered. <words>311</words>
The flawlessly inked characters for ‘certainty’ and ‘forever’ bled slightly, as if weeping. <words>324</words>
Mei paused, poured herself a cup of lukewarm tea, and took a thoughtful sip, her expression one of mild satisfaction. <words>344</words>
The humorous unease of it all—rewriting destiny with flower parts before breakfast—was the best part of her job. <words>363</words>
She gave the handle one final, firm twist. <words>371</words>
The chiming stopped, replaced by a profound silence that seemed to absorb all other sound. <words>386</words>
Mei opened the press and removed not a mess of crushed petals, but a single, paper-thin wafer of crystallized light, veined like a butterfly's wing. <words>413</words>
It pulsed with a gentle, chaotic energy. <words>420</words>
She slipped the wafer into the Emperor’s tea caddy, a silent offering of pure, unwritten potential. <words>436</words>
The heavy doors to the throne room began to swing open, their groan heralding the day's first inquiry. <words>453</words>
The Emperor would ask his question, but the answer was no longer written in the stars; it was dissolving in his cup. <words>474</words>
