Sir Kaelan, last paladin of the Order of Cosmic Integrity, stood within the solar flare observatory, a place both lavishly austere and profoundly boring. <words>24</words>
In this age, after the last star was named and cataloged, his sworn duty to restore ancient systems felt less like a holy quest and more like cosmic janitorial work. <words>53</words>
He was polishing his gray-steel vambrace with a practiced, weary sigh when the entire city, and the observatory with it, was plunged into an absolute and silent blackout. <words>85</words>
Emergency lighting flickered, casting long, dancing shadows, and in that strobe-like chaos, he saw her for the first time. <words>106</words>
She was a maintenance tech, judging by her jumpsuit, and she was staring at the central spire not with panic, but with a look of what he could only describe as bored excitement. <words>141</words>
"It's starting," she said, her voice calm amidst the sudden dark. <words>151</words>
"The Great Unraveling," Kaelan muttered, the forgotten catechism of his order suddenly feeling uncomfortably relevant. <words>167</words>
"The old texts called it that, but it's really just a system recalibration," she corrected, pointing a steady hand towards the spire where the air itself had begun to shimmer with visible changes. <words>202</words>
Ghostly ribbons of light, like frayed celestial threads, were leaking from the containment field. <words>217</words>
"The system is trying to mend itself, but the conduits are misaligned," she explained, her tone matter-of-fact. <words>236</words>
"We have to confine the primary energy filament before it destabilizes the entire grid." <words>252</words>
Kaelan drew his shimmering energy blade, a weapon that had felled rogue automatons and pirates in the outer voids. <words>271</words>
"That's too coarse," she said, shaking her head as she rummaged in a small pouch on her belt. <words>289</words>
"You can't sever the thread; you have to guide it, like weaving." <words>302</words>
She pulled out a small, insignificant object and held it out to him in the pulsing light. <words>319</words>
It was a simple, dull sewing needle, its point blunted from use or age. <words>333</words>
"The ancient systems weren't built with swords," she said softly. <words>343</words>
"They were stitched together." <words>347</words>
Kaelan looked from the useless-seeming needle to the cosmic energies tearing reality apart at its seams, a strange sense of purpose finally cutting through his gloom. <words>376</words>
He had to confine the fraying light, not with a blade meant to sunder, but with a needle meant to mend. <words>398</words>
He took the needle from her, its cool, dense metal a surprising weight in his gauntleted palm. <words>416</words>
This was the true nature of his vow: not the grand, violent gestures of war, but the quiet, focused act of repair. <words>438</words>
As he moved toward the shimmering tear in the world, Kaelan realized this was the first exciting thing to happen in a century, and he was terribly, wonderfully bored of the alternative. <words>471</words>
