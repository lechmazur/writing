Kael clutched the vintage button box, its worn leather a strange comfort against the thumping bass of the nightclub. <16>
This place, The Orrery, was a broken planetarium given a second, profane life, with fractured constellations crawling across the dome under pulsing strobes. <38>
He was an underwater welder, a man accustomed to immense, silent pressure, yet the air here felt heavier than any ocean. <57>
It was the crossing, the impossible moment where two timelines that should never meet were grinding against each other. <75>
His grandfather’s journal called it a moment of unraveling, a seam in reality that could be re-stitched by the right hands. <96>
Kael’s motivation was simple and terrifying: to wield the improbable power that bled from such a wound in time. <116>
An inherited mystery had guided him here, a legacy of whispers and strange compulsions that felt more like a haunting than a gift. <138>
He learned of his purpose via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, seeing a reflection that was his but older, its eyes pleading, its hands demonstrating the box. <168>
For years he had been patiently impatient, waiting for the signs his mirrored ghost had shown him, and now his skin prickled with the finality of arrival. <194>
The unraveling was not a cataclysm but a subtle sickness in the air, making dancers stumble and drinks spill from hands that swore they were steady. <221>
Kael moved through the crowd, his focus absolute, the box held like a prayer. <234>
He found the epicenter beneath the ruined solar system projector, a spot on the dance floor where the light seemed to bend incorrectly. <256>
He knelt, opening the box to reveal buttons of polished bone and mother-of-pearl, each one a different potential catastrophe. <277>
The ghost in the mirror had warned him against force; this was not a thing to be commanded but coaxed. <297>
He had to pamper the rift, to soothe it. <306>
His finger, scarred from a dozen deep-water burns, hovered over a smooth, grey button that felt warm to the touch. <326>
He pressed it gently, not with the force of a man seizing control, but with the care of one steadying a fragile instrument. <348>
The chaotic music of the club did not stop but folded into itself, becoming a resonant, harmonic hum that vibrated in his teeth. <371>
The air shimmered, and for a heartbeat, he saw the other timeline—a silent, dust-filled planetarium, a sky full of intact stars, and a solitary old man smiling at him with his own eyes. <405>
The improbable power settled into him not as a storm, but as a profound quiet, the absolute control over pressure he had always known, now applied to the fabric of existence itself. <438>
The vision faded and the beat returned, but Kael was no longer just a welder in a nightclub; he was the fulcrum. <459>
He closed the box, the inherited mystery now his to command. <470>
