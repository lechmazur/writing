My name is Elara, and I’m the best exorcist in Veridia, not that it’s much of a boast when your main competition is a man who thinks holy water is improved with a splash of gin. <words>32</words>
Our city is a marvel of braided branches and living wood high in the Amazon canopy, a perfect place for spirits to get tangled, which keeps me gainfully employed. <words>61</words>
My predecessor, the great Alistair, was a legend whose looming shadow was long enough to cast a chill even in the humid jungle air, and I was sick of shivering in it. <words>95</words>
So when the Whispering Blight manifested, I saw my chance. <words>105</words>
It was a nasty entity, ancient and corrosive, and it appeared at the precise moment the grand sundial stuttered, a moment the elders called ‘when the clock dares to skip a beat’. <words>139</words>
Naturally, the consecrated bridge we use for major banishments chose that exact time to collapse, its vine-ropes snapping with a sound like thunderous finality. <words>166</words>
This sudden closure of a usual path sent the council into a tizzy, their panicked squawking more annoying than the spirit itself. <words>190</words>
My standard rites were like spitting into a hurricane, so I turned to my secret weapon: a wizard’s battered grimoire I’d… acquired. <words>216</words>
Alistair would have clutched his sacred symbols, but I’ve always believed in fighting fire with whatever flammable material is handy. <words>241</words>
Flipping through its brittle, musty pages, I found a spell that was beautifully, recklessly insane—it wouldn’t banish the Blight, it would youthify it. <words>270</words>
The grimoire promised to revert the entity to its harmless, infantile state, a spiritual de-aging. <words>286</words>
With a feisty grin that felt more brave than I actually was, I climbed to the city’s apex and began the arcane chant. <words>312</words>
The air crackled, the wizard’s words feeling alien and powerful on my tongue as the Blight writhed, shrinking and paling. <words>336</words>
It was working, and a surge of triumphant pride swelled in my chest; I was doing it, I was eclipsing him. <words>358</words>
But the magic, raw and untamed, didn’t stop with the spirit. <words>370</words>
It bled into the city itself, the ancient Heartwood tree groaning as its bark began to smooth, its mighty branches thinning into saplings. <words>398</words>
The true weight of responsibility crashed down on me then, a force heavier than any ghost; I wasn’t just risking my reputation, but my entire world. <words>430</words>
With a desperate, curse-laden scream, I poured my own energy into the spell, not to banish the now-giggling wisp of a spirit, but to sever the wizard’s reckless magic from our home. <words>467</words>
I saved the city, but the scar on the Heartwood serves as a constant, cynical reminder that outshining a shadow means little when you almost burn down the world to do it. <words>500</words>
