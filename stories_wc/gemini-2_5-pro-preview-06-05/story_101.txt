The procession of unformed thoughts, a parade of what-might-be, forced me onto a detour. <words>14</words>
I found myself before a door that wasn't there a moment ago, in this place before memory began. <words>30</words>
This was the quiet room design studio, a pocket of stillness in the churning chaos of pre-existence. <words>47</words>
A man opened the door, his smile so genuinely welcoming it felt like an anchor. <words>62</words>
"You look lost," the landlord said, his voice the sound of settling dust. <words>75</words>
"We all are, at first." <words>81</words>
He guided me inside, the air humming with a focused, manic clarity. <words>93</words>
"We work on difficult projects here," he explained, gesturing to blueprints of sorrows yet to be born. <words>110</words>
"Our specialty is weathered hearts." <words>115</words>
My own core ached, a premonition of a pain I hadn't yet earned but knew was coming. <words>133</words>
"The goal," he continued, his eyes gleaming with purpose, "is to reimagine the endings we fear." <words>149</words>
He wasn't offering erasure, but resilience. <words>155</words>
He wanted us to adapt. <words>161</words>
My gaze drifted to the only decoration on the wall: a small, framed pin. <words>176</words>
It was a golden bee, an impossible artifact from a history that hadn't happened. <words>191</words>
"A future emperor's sigil," the landlord noted, following my stare. <words>201</words>
"A symbol of resurrection, of empire, of a short man's grand ambition." <words>214</words>
"But that's not its true purpose, not here." <words>223</words>
He tapped the glass frame gently. <words>229</words>
"Its meaning is cryptically obvious." <words>235</words>
I stared at the bee, at its delicate wings and determined form, a creature built to serve a hive. <words>253</words>
It wasn't about a single man's return from exile. <words>262</words>
It was about the continuation of the whole. <words>270</words>
The hive adapts. <words>273</words>
The hive survives the death of any one bee, any one king, any one heart. <words>289</words>
A schism of understanding cracked open in my mind, a revelation so sharp it was almost painful. <words>306</words>
We couldn't stop the breaking. <words>311</words>
We could only design a heart that knew how to mend, how to continue, how to build a new nest after the old one was destroyed. <words>337</words>
We could build a heart that saw the ending not as a finality, but as a necessary transformation. <words>355</words>
The landlord saw the realization dawn on my face and gestured to an empty drafting table. <words>372</words>
"The fear is not of the ending itself," he said softly, "but of being unprepared for what comes next." <words>391</words>
I sat down, the manic energy in the room finally feeling like a tool rather than a symptom. <words>409</words>
Before the first story was ever recorded, we were already trying to change the ending. <words>424</words>
I picked up a stylus made of solidified light and began to draw a heart that could weather any storm. <words>444</words>
