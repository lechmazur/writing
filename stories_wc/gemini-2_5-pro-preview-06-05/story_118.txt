We are the facility’s therapist, and tonight the sound of hindsight is a symphony of screeching brakes and unspoken goodbyes. <words>20</words>
It hums through the night air, a collective psychic migraine emanating from the sleeping minds of the agency’s finest recruits. <words>40</words>
Our purpose, our singular motivation, is to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to give these ghosts of regret a physical form. <words>60</words>
We sit in the nexus, a sterile white room, surrounded by flickering candles whose flames dance with a merry bitterness. <words>79</words>
Each recruit is uniformly peculiar in their anxieties, a curated collection of traumas deemed optimal for fieldwork. <words>97</words>
Our work is to drain these anxieties before they fester, before they compromise the bold discovery planned for dawn. <words>117</words>
The method is an old one, passed down through every iteration of Us: we listen, and we let the wax bleed. <words>138</words>
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, we translate their silent screams into solid, brittle truths. <words>158</words>
The wax pools on the cold steel floor, hardening into glyphs of missed shots and broken promises. <words>175</words>
Tonight, one memory is louder than the rest, a feedback loop from Agent Seven, the mission’s linchpin. <words>193</words>
It isn’t about a failed mission or a lost asset, but something painfully, beautifully mundane. <words>209</words>
We focus, pulling the thread of his regret, and the image sharpens in our shared consciousness: a scuffed phone charger plug. <words>230</words>
He’d forgotten it on the nightstand, a tiny, careless act that now symbolized the life he’d permanently unplugged from. <words>251</words>
The sound of his hindsight wasn’t a scream but a quiet, insistent hum of what could have been, a life of charging phones and sleeping in. <words>280</words>
This simple, potent regret could unravel him, could jeopardize everything. <words>290</words>
We pull harder, our collective will a siphon. <words>298</words>
The primary candle sputters, its wax dripping faster, pooling into a perfect, miniature replica of the scuffed plug. <words>319</words>
We feel the pressure in Seven’s mind ease, the hum fading into manageable silence. <words>333</words>
We have taken his anchorless memory and given it an anchor of its own. <words>347</words>
The room is now littered with these waxen sorrows, a graveyard of alternate timelines. <words>361</words>
We gather the coded shapes, including the tiny charger plug, feeling their cool, waxy weight in our hands. <words>380</words>
They will be melted down and reformed into fresh candles by morning, ready for the next night of psychic sanitation. <words>400</words>
It is a beautifully pointless cycle, and we can’t help but smile. <words>413</words>
The agents will wake up refreshed and empty, ready to make new, exciting mistakes for us to clean up tomorrow. <words>434</words>
Another night’s work is done, another set of ghosts given just enough substance to be swept away with the morning dust. <words>455</words>
Out the window, the first hints of dawn promise a successful discovery, paid for with forgotten regrets and scented wax. <words>476</words>
