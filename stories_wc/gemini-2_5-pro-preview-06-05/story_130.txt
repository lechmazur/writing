<story>
Kael was the only lost apprentice aboard the *Veridian*, an interstellar orchard ship migrating between galaxies. <words>16</words>
He had failed his mentor, the ship’s Weaver, and now tended the forgotten corners of the gravity-fed groves. <words>32</words>
One cycle, beneath a canopy of shimmering Cygnus pears, he found a fallen bird’s nest. <words>46</words>
It was a perfect, intricate sphere of woven stellar-flax and shed comet-plume, now tragically broken. <words>61</words>
The sight was a familiar sting, a mirror to his own discarded ambitions. <words>74</words>
He carried the fragile ruin back to his cramped quarters, a space cluttered with failed projects and the ghosts of potential. <words>94</words>
There, on a small shelf, sat his only true inheritance: an ancient cordless phone, its plastic yellowed with age. <words>113</words>
It held the Weaver’s private logs, hours of static-laden confessions Kael was never meant to hear. <words>130</words>
The old man’s voice would crackle through, dripping with a mocking affection that had defined their relationship. <words>148</words>
“You try too hard to copy the shell, boy,” the voice rasped one night, a phantom in the quiet cabin. <words>167</words>
“Perfection is a cage you build for yourself.” <words>176</words>
Kael, a person who was always privately open to harsh truths, let the words settle in his gut. <words>194</words>
He had spent years trying to replicate the Weaver’s flawless designs, never understanding the spirit behind them. <words>211</words>
This fallen nest was different; it was a failure he could hold, a problem he could solve. <words>229</words>
He decided then to reverse-engineer it, not its form, but its function, its soul. <words>244</words>
He listened again to the phone, sifting through the Weaver’s ramblings about cosmic currents and the resilience of migrating star-sparrows. <words>267</words>
“The journey teaches you the weave, not the destination,” the recording crackled, a piece of raw traveler’s wisdom cutting through the static. <words>289</words>
“You don’t rebuild a home by patching the walls; you find its center and trust it to grow.” <words>309</words>
Kael looked from the phone to the shattered nest, a sudden, brilliant clarity piercing his long-held despair. <words>327</words>
He wasn’t meant to fix the broken thing, but to understand the impulse that created it. <words>343</words>
His motivation shifted from seeking approval to finding freedom in self-acceptance. <words>355</words>
Across the promise of changing winds, as the *Veridian* drifted into a new nebula’s vibrant light, Kael began to work. <words>376</words>
He didn’t mend the old nest. <words>382</words>
Instead, using its fundamental principles of tension and balance, he wove something entirely new from his own salvaged materials. <words>402</words>
It was asymmetrical, flawed, and yet it held an undeniable strength. <words>414</words>
It was his. <words>417</words>
He took his creation back to the grove and secured it in the branches of a young starlight-willow, a quiet testament not to mastery, but to beginning again. <words>446</words>
He was no longer the Weaver’s shadow, but a traveler finding his own way home. <words>462</words>
