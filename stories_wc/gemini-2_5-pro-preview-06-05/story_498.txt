Silas, the nervous kingpin of the valleyâ€™s communal gardens, ran a thumb over a brittle, alien-looking seed pod. <words>18</words>
Through the restless hush of midwinter, the only kingdom he commanded was this collection of dried seed pods, a silent arsenal against the coming season. <words>41</words>
His people, walled within their xenophobic enclave, trusted only the familiar heirloom varieties, the ones their grandfathers had sown. <words>61</words>
They saw purity in repetition, safety in sameness. <words>69</words>
Silas, however, saw only the tyranny of indifference, a slow, creeping rot that promised starvation the first time a blight favored their monotonous crops. <words>94</words>
He had to unsettle them, to crack the foundations of their fear. <words>106</words>
Driving the icy perimeter road one afternoon, the gray sky pressing down, he saw a faded sign half-swallowed by ivy: "Blackwood Arboretum: A World of Trees." <words>134</words>
He had never noticed it before, a ghost from a time before the valley sealed itself off. <words>151</words>
Impulse, or perhaps desperation, made him take the detour to visit a landmark seen on a sign, turning his truck down the forgotten lane. <words>176</words>
The arboretum was a wreck of shattered glasshouses and frozen, skeletal trees from forgotten continents. <words>191</words>
Yet, in the lee of a collapsed stone wall, sheltered from the worst of the wind, a single, impossible camellia was in full, defiant bloom. <words>217</words>
Its waxy, crimson petals were a shout of life in the dead quiet, a species that had no right to survive here. <words>239</words>
A fragile ferocity radiated from the sight, mirroring the frantic hope hammering in his own chest. <words>256</words>
He returned to the enclave that evening, his usual anxiety replaced by a sharp, cold purpose. <words>272</words>
At the monthly council meeting in the sterile town hall, he didn't raise his voice. <words>286</words>
Instead, he placed one of his most treasured pods on the table, a gnarled, dark thing from a distant mountain range. <words>309</words>
"Our soil is dying of boredom," he said, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hands. <words>325</words>
"We preach strength but we practice fear, and indifference is the tyrant that will kill us all." <words>342</words>
He told them about the camellia, a lone survivor thriving on nothing but neglect and its own inherent will to live. <words>363</words>
He held up the pod. <words>368</words>
"This is from a place with soil poorer than ours and winters harsher than we can imagine." <words>384</words>
"It is not a threat to our way of life; it is a chance for our life to find a new way." <words>406</words>
The elders stared, their faces hard masks of suspicion, but he saw a flicker of something else in the eyes of the younger farmers. <words>430</words>
It was a long shot, a change so profound as to be almost unthinkable. <words>444</words>
The success of his gambit, the sprouting of this single seed of doubt in their hardened minds, felt both unlikely and, for the first time, terrifyingly probable. <words>471</words>
He had held the line, and now the entire valley held its breath with him, waiting for the thaw. <words>490</words>
