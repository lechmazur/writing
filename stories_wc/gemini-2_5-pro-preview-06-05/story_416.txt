The grand tourney scoreboard, a slate of polished obsidian, finally wiped itself clean. <12>
Sir Kaelan felt the familiar, quiet thrill of an ending. <20>
While others drank to the new champion, he slipped away from the pavilions and into the twilight breath of the luminous swamp. <39>
His armor was immaculate, his bearing rigid, but this was his true calling. <51>
He was here to collect urban legends, the kind the Royal Academy dismissed as peasant fantasy. <66>
This academically rebellious streak was his most guarded secret, a small, fierce flame against the cold stone of his knighthood. <85>
Tonight’s legend was that of the Gloom-Coil, an ancient snail whose fossilized shell was said to hold the swamp’s first light. <106>
He had to verify it. <111>
The air grew thick with the scent of glowing moss and sweet decay. <123>
Bioluminescent fungi cast long, dancing shadows that played against the water’s still surface. <136>
His source, a tattered scroll he’d traded a silver dagger for, led him to a hermit’s hut half-sunk into the mire. <157>
Inside, the silence was heavy, broken only by the drip of water from the thatched roof. <172>
A single shelf, miraculously dry, held a collection of bog-wood carvings, strange roots, and one other item. <189>
There it was: a spiral of stone, impossibly large, with a faint, pearlescent sheen. <203>
The fossilized snail shell. <207>
A slow smile touched Kaelan’s lips, a rare show of his laconic exuberance. <221>
He reached for it, his gauntlet closing the final inches. <230>
Suddenly, another hand, slender and smudged with mud, shot from the shadows for the very same object. <247>
Their hands bumped, a soft thud of leather on metal. <257>
Kaelan looked up, startled, into the wide, intelligent eyes of a woman clad in scavenger’s leathers. <274>
Her hair was a wild tangle of black curls, and she held a matching scroll in her other hand. <290>
She wasn’t surprised, merely focused, as if his presence was an expected variable in a complex equation. <307>
This was no accident. <311>
It felt like two rivers meeting, a confluence that had been charted long ago by unseen cartographers. <328>
The core concept of converging destinies, a theory he’d once scoffed at in a lecture, now felt undeniably real. <346>
She gave a slight, challenging nod toward the shell. <355>
“To collect the story?” she asked, her voice a low whisper. <365>
Kaelan retracted his hand, his posture still knightly but his expression softened by a shared purpose. <381>
“To verify it,” he corrected gently. <388>
A flicker of understanding, of kinship, passed between them. <397>
“Then we should do it together,” she stated, not a question but a fact. <411>
He looked from her determined face to the fossil, the proof of one legend and the beginning of another. <429>
“Good,” Kaelan said, and for him, the word contained a universe of assent. <442>
