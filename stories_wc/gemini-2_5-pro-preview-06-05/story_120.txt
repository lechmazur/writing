The loop always began at the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, a sound that vibrated through the shimmering walls of the quantum tunnel. <words>22</words>
I, Paramedic Elias Thorne, was its sole, weary inhabitant, a ghost reliving the first second of his haunting. <words>38</words>
A state of excited boredom had long ago replaced panic; the thrill was in the tiny, deliberate changes I could make to the script. <words>59</words>
Today’s change would be monumental, a final attempt to baptize your nightmares in acceptance, or at least my own. <words>78</words>
The memory surged as it always did: a schoolyard, a frantic call, a small body by the swingset, something shiny tangled in a shoelace. <words>102</words>
My unhealed traumas were the very architecture of this place, each swirling nebula a monument to a failure. <words>121</words>
But this time, I wouldn't fight the memory’s pull. <words>130</words>
Instead, I focused until the roaring chaos of the tunnel resolved into a single, distinct sound. <words>147</words>
I listened by the sound of a single raindrop, a perfect plink against a forgotten windowpane from that terrible afternoon. <words>167</words>
That was my anchor, my starting pistol for the real work. <words>178</words>
From my pocket, I pulled the weathered fishing lure, its paint chipped and its hook rusted from a thousand identical cycles. <words>200</words>
It was the object from the call, the one I’d pocketed before the boy’s father arrived, a privately public sin I carried alone. <words>225</words>
Using shimmering threads of temporal energy I’d learned to pluck from the tunnel’s walls, I began to nest. <words>243</words>
I wove the energy strands around a fixed point in the memory-space, creating a small, hollow sphere of relative calm. <words>264</words>
Inside this sanctuary, I placed the lure on a small pedestal of solidified light. <words>279</words>
I added other artifacts from the loop: the phantom scent of antiseptic, the echo of a flatlining monitor, the ghost-image of my own shaking hands. <words>306</words>
Each piece was a nightmare, and I was giving each one a home. <words>319</words>
It was a strange and sacred diorama of my own damnation, built not to escape but to inhabit. <words>338</words>
My work was intimate yet performed on a stage of cosmic scale, a truly privately public confession. <words>355</words>
The bell began its long, sorrowful echo again, signaling the reset. <words>366</words>
But as the tunnel prepared to collapse and rebuild itself, my small nest held firm, a tiny point of stillness in the storm. <words>389</words>
The raindrop sound was clearer now, the lure seemed less a token of failure and more a relic of a lesson. <words>411</words>
A strange peace settled over me, the boredom melting away, leaving only a quiet, thrilling excitement for what the next loop would let me build. <words>437</words>
I had finally found a way to stop running from the recess bell. <words>451</words>
