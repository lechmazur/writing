Barnaby Flick, whose face was once plastered on every lunchbox in the nation, adjusted the final dial on the console. <20>
The low hum of the vibration analysis chamber intensified, a resonant G-sharp that rattled his teeth and made the air taste like ozone. <41>
Before him, incongruously mounted where a blast shield should be, was the prize: a six-foot-tall stained-glass window salvaged from a deconsecrated cathedral in Lyon. <69>
His crumpled treasure map, less a guide to buried gold and more a schematic for psychic demolition, lay open on the steel worktable. <91>
Every arcane symbol and frequency notation was now checked off in his spidery handwriting. <105>
The last secret had been revealed not in some dusty tome, but in the nonsensical ramblings of a late-night infomercial host, a moment of sublime, cosmic absurdity. <136>
He’d paid for his first shot at glory with a childhood, a price of ambition he understood all too well. <157>
This new ambition, to tap into the wild magic of madness, felt like a far more honest transaction. <177>
He grinned, a genuinely weird, lopsided expression that had gotten him fired from his last three "comeback" sitcoms. <198>
The G-sharp hit its prescribed harmonic, and the window began to sing back. <212>
It was happening. <215>
A pinprick of light, the color of a dying star, appeared in the cobalt blue robe of a forgotten saint. <234>
Then, a slow, deliberate trickle of impossible energy began to seep through the hidden layers of etched glass in the cathedral window. <257>
The map hadn't shown a place, but a method: how to use sonic resonance to unlock a non-Euclidean pattern secretly carved between the panes. <285>
The light didn't illuminate the sterile chamber; it seemed to curdle the very air it touched. <301>
It dripped into his mind, a cool, liquid chaos that felt like remembering a language he’d never known. <320>
The rigid scripts of his youth, the forced smiles for the cameras, the hollow applause—it all began to dissolve like sugar in water. <345>
He saw the architecture of reality as a cheap studio set, its flimsy walls trembling under the force of this new perception. <368>
"Well, I'll be damned," he whispered, the tone a perfect blend of reverence and the giddy thrill of a kid who’s just successfully hot-wired the universe. <396>
The trickle became a steady, silent stream, and Barnaby Flick, authentically odd to the last, threw his head back and laughed as the beautiful, terrifying madness poured in. <428>
