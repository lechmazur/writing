Kaelen, a swordsman whose conscience was heavier than any shield, watched his quarry from behind a pot of suspiciously serene orchids. <words>19</words>
The Aethelgard Sky-Spa, a resort adrift in the clouds, was a ridiculous place for an assassination, but a perfect one for unmasking a pretender to the throne. <words>45</words>
His target, Duke Valerius, stood by the geyser-fed pools, his posture so unnaturally straight it was hypnotically rigid. <words>64</words>
Even in a plush, monogrammed robe, the man looked like a tin soldier playing at being a king. <words>81</words>
Kaelen’s fingers tightened around the cracked monocle in his pocket, a shard of a life he’d helped the Duke shatter. <words>102</words>
His atonement depended on deciphering the web of ink on the Duke’s skin, a task that had seemed impossible until now. <words>124</words>
The spa’s brochure had advertised a mandatory "Mindful Weaving" session, and Kaelen knew the vain Duke would attend to project an air of cultured sensitivity. <words>152</words>
He found Valerius in the Tranquility Pavilion, fumbling with a loom, his brow furrowed in theatrical concentration. <words>171</words>
Kaelen sat at a nearby station, his heart a frantic drum against the spa’s gentle chimes, and began to yarn. <words>192</words>
He pretended to work with the vibrant threads, but his eyes were fixed on the Duke’s exposed back, tracing the cryptic tattoos that snaked across his shoulders. <words>223</words>
They were a chaotic mess of lines and symbols, a map of nothing, and Kaelen’s frustration mounted with every failed attempt to find a pattern. <words>251</words>
A soft hand touched his shoulder, and he looked up into the kind, wrinkled face of a spa attendant. <words>272</words>
"You're pulling the threads too tight, dear," she whispered, her voice a balm on his frayed nerves. <words>289</words>
"Every pattern, no matter how complex, begins with a single, simple loop." <words>301</words>
Her simple kindness, so unexpected in this place of gilded deceit, was the key that unlocked his mind. <words>321</words>
He wasn't just looking at tattoos; he was looking at a story woven in ink, a lie spun like a thread. <words>343</words>
The method wasn't about reading, it was about unraveling cryptic tattoos as if they were stitches in a tapestry. <words>364</words>
He saw it then: the starting loop, the cross-stitch of a commoner’s guild, the chain stitch of a forged lineage. <words>386</words>
In the hush where hope takes root, the entire fraudulent history unspooled in his mind. <words>402</words>
Freed by kindness from the paralysis of his guilt, Kaelen calmly finished his row of weaving. <words>419</words>
He now had the proof he needed, a pattern of treason clear as day. <words>433</words>
The pretender’s reign was unraveling, and Kaelen’s own redemption was just beginning. <words>446</words>
