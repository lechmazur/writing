Lyra pirouetted on a rope bridge, her laughter swallowed by the immense canopy of the banyan metropolis as, far below, the last seeds of a forgotten age were pressed into dark soil. <words>31</words>
She was a collector, a carefree dancer driven by a single motivation: to scour the city for its most sacred and nonsensical practices. <words>52</words>
Her method was simple, relying entirely on misguided wishes whispered to the pollen-heavy air. <words>67</words>
"Show me the final art, the Knot of Unbecoming," she wished, and promptly tripped over a loose floorboard, tumbling into the laundry chute of the city's most notorious soup kitchen. <words>99</words>
It was an oddly predictable outcome; her spiritual quests always began with a domestic disaster. <words>114</words>
She landed softly in a pile of aprons that smelled of phantom spices and existential dread. <words>129</words>
For hours she had to scour the steamy kitchens, her search for enlightenment sidetracked by a need to find a matching pair of socks for a three-legged cook. <words>159</words>
Her wish then led her to a conservatory where grumpy orchids recited bad poetry, and then to a workshop where sentient teacups argued about the nature of steam. <words>191</words>
In each absurd location, she found not the Knot, but a single, shimmering thread left behind, almost as if her wish was helpfully unspooling. <words>218</words>
Finally, the collected threads braided themselves together in her hand, forming a single, luminous shoelace. <words>235</words>
The shoelace tugged her towards the highest branch of the oldest banyan, to a tiny hut woven from moonlight and moss. <words>257</words>
Inside sat a guru, who was not a wizened old man but a small, impeccably dressed monkey wearing a single, perfectly polished shoe. <words>282</words>
He pointed a tiny, elegant finger at his bare foot, then at the shoelace in her hand. <words>300</words>
No words were exchanged, for the practice was not in the tying, but in the offering. <words>316</words>
Lyra understood. <words>318</words>
Embracing the sublime absurdity of the moment, she began to dance, a whirlwind of motion that wove patterns of grace and foolishness around the tiny guru. <words>347</words>
Her dance was the prayer, the question, and the answer all at once. <words>360</words>
The monkey chittered in delight, a sound like tiny bells, and performed a solemn hop, which was the entirety of the sacred rite. <words>385</words>
She had collected the final practice. <words>391</words>
With her quest complete, Lyra bowed, leaving the single shoelace on his doorstep as a gift. <words>408</words>
She danced away across the swaying bridges, her spirit light, already composing a new, more misguided wish for the dawn that was breaking over the freshly planted field below. <words>441</words>
