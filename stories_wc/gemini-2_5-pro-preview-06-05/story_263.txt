Kael strolled along the Anemone Promenade, his boots silent on the living coral cobblestones. <words>13</words>
He considered it his most sacred ritual, these nature walks through the reef city of Aethel. <words>27</words>
Tucked into his belt was Barnaby, a faded carnival prize plush, a one-eyed rabbit of indeterminate species. <words>44</words>
Barnaby was a solemn reminder of the saccharine lies the world told itself, the same lies Kael was employed to correct. <words>65</words>
His work, as he saw it, was simply to retell an epic from the villain’s point of view, a perspective he found infinitely more logical. <words>89</words>
The so-called ‘Heroes of the Sunken Light’ were, in his master’s grand narrative, the true tyrants. <words>106</words>
And Kael was the humble, if divinely inspired, editor of their final chapters. <words>120</words>
His current project was High Priestess Liora, a woman famed for her sermons on interconnectedness. <words>136</words>
“All are one under the tide,” she would chant, a sentiment Kael found both touching and tactically exploitable. <words>155</words>
His plan was a masterwork of calculatedly playful irony, a specialty of his. <words>169</words>
He would use her own philosophy to consolidate his master’s claim on the city’s spiritual heart. <words>185</words>
The method was his favorite: assassination through reversed echoes. <words>194</words>
He wouldn’t use a blade or poison, but her own virtue, twisted back upon itself. <words>210</words>
Liora’s private meditation chamber was a network of resonant crystal channels, designed to amplify her voice across the city’s core. <words>231</words>
She believed they connected her to every soul in Aethel. <words>241</words>
Kael, with a few minor adjustments and a well-placed sonic resonator, had ensured they did. <words>257</words>
When she spoke her unifying mantra tonight, the channels would not broadcast her voice outwards but would instead focus every ambient vibration, every whisper, every heartbeat in the city, back inward upon her. <words>292</words>
A reversed echo of unity. <words>298</words>
The sheer force of all that "oneness" would gently, humorously, and solemnly rupture every cell in her body. <words>318</words>
It was a beautiful reflection of morality, really; her greatest strength becoming her most intimate and absolute weakness. <words>338</words>
He paused his walk to watch a school of silver-finned data-fish stream past, their scales flashing coded messages. <words>356</words>
They were simple creatures, operating on pure, uncorrupted logic. <words>365</words>
He admired that. <words>368</words>
Kael adjusted Barnaby in his belt, the plush rabbit’s single button eye staring blankly at the bioluminescent spires. <words>387</words>
The epic had to be told correctly, with all the messy, inconvenient parts of the heroes’ tale properly erased. <words>407</words>
One holy footnote at a time. <words>413</words>
He smiled, a small, private thing, and continued his walk through the silent, listening city. <words>428</words>
His work was not about death, but about narrative clarity. <words>438</words>
And the story, he felt with profound certainty, was finally starting to make sense. <words>453</words>
