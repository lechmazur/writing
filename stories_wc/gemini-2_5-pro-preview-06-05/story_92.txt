The three borzois slept soundly in their velvet beds, oblivious to my trespass. <12>
I stood alone in the Alistair mansion’s dining room, a cavern of mahogany and shadow where the day’s last color bled from the tall, grim windows. <36>
A loud silence pressed in, so heavy it felt like a physical weight on my shoulders. <51>
My only company was the sprawling botanical collection on the sideboard, a morbidly beautiful array of pitcher plants and night-blooming cereus, their waxy petals like sleeping mouths. <79>
This was my ritual, the true purpose of my job as the dog walker for the ultra-rich. <96>
I moved with a carefully careless grace, my fingertips ghosting over the silver, my feet never quite creaking on the ancient floorboards. <120>
It was all part of the silent agreement I shared with Mrs. Alistair, the unspoken contract that allowed me this proximity to her ghosts. <144>
I had to justify this nightly intrusion, not to her, but to the hollow space inside myself that craved this specific brand of peace. <168>
My motivation was simple: to stand where fear dares not tread, to breathe the air of a place others fled. <189>
I often wondered if she knew, if she had chosen me for this very reason. <203>
Our first and only real conversation had been at an encounter at a blood drive downtown, a sterile, brightly lit room so different from this one. <230>
I had been staring at the ceiling, feeling the needle in my arm, when she sat in the chair beside me, her gaze unnervingly direct. <256>
She didn’t flinch when her own turn came, her expression one of placid curiosity rather than anxiety. <275>
“You’re not afraid of much, are you?” she had asked, her voice a low murmur against the hum of the centrifuges. <297>
I had just shrugged, but she saw something in that gesture, an answer that satisfied her. <314>
She told me about her dogs, her house, and its reputation, offering me the job right there as nurses bustled around us with juice and cookies. <343>
She wasn't just hiring a dog walker; she was hiring a fellow sentinel, someone who wouldn't be spooked by the settling of old bones. <367>
Back in the dining room, the memory settled my nerves, anchoring me to the present. <381>
The house wasn't haunted by spirits, but by an oppressive quiet, a stillness that I was uniquely qualified to inhabit. <402>
I was a part of its ecosystem now, as vital and strange as the carnivorous flowers watching me from the shadows. <423>
With a final, deep breath of the dust-and-lilac-scented air, I turned and slipped out, leaving the silence to its loud, lonely reign. <446>
The borzois didn't even stir. <451>
