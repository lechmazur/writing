Silas, an outlaw with more verses than warrants to his name, practiced his lines under the dome's brass-ribbed sky. <words>17</words>
The steampunk observatory was his stage now, a place of gears and glass where he rehearsed his poems of cosmic loneliness. <words>36</words>
Throughout rehearsals, he sought refuge in the dome’s small coffee kiosk, a nook of steam and dark brew. <words>53</words>
It was there he first saw the wall misalign with reality. <words>63</words>
The brass-plated menu flickered, its familiar list of espressos and teas dissolving into a single, stark line of text. <words>81</words>
"The loneliest star still burns," it read, a verse he’d scribbled in his private journal only last night. <words>99</words>
A saturated ambivalence washed over him, a tide of dread and wonder. <words>111</words>
He returned the next day, his heart a nervous drum against his ribs. <words>123</words>
The wall offered a new riddle: "Two paths cross where the clockwork sleeps." <words>136</words>
This entire setup felt virtually peculiar, a stage play written just for him. <words>149</words>
His motivation for being here, once simple survival, now twisted into a need to know, an unstoppable curiosity. <words>167</words>
He pulled the worn runic bone dice from his pocket, their edges smoothed by a thousand anxious thumbs. <words>184</words>
He cast them onto the small cafe table, the ivory clicking softly. <words>196</words>
The runes for 'journey' and 'union' stared up at him, symbols of intertwined destinies. <words>211</words>
He glanced back at the wall, and saw those very same runes now glowing faintly at the end of its latest sentence. <words>232</words>
Fear and fascination were two horses pulling him in the same impossible direction. <words>245</words>
By the third rehearsal, he’d abandoned his script entirely, his performance now a silent vigil directed at the wall. <words>264</words>
He would read the changing text, a method of divination far stranger than tea leaves or tarot. <words>281</words>
The words spoke of another, a "gear-spinner," a "lens-grinder," someone else trapped in this clockwork world with him. <words>300</words>
He felt their presence not as a comfort, but as a mirror to his own gilded cage. <words>316</words>
On the final day of rehearsals, the wall delivered its most urgent message yet. <words>330</words>
"Tonight, the Orrery will misalign." <words>336</words>
"Destiny falters at the western bearing." <words>343</words>
"Come before the final turn." <words>349</words>
A choice was laid bare: to remain the poet, safe in his performance of fate, or to become the outlaw who seized it. <words>371</words>
His unstoppable curiosity had become a roaring fire, burning away all caution. <words>383</words>
He could feel his destiny intertwined with this unseen stranger, a bond forged in cryptic text and shared solitude. <words>401</words>
The saturated ambivalence in his chest was a physical weight, a beautiful, terrible gravity pulling him forward. <words>418</words>
He left his coffee untouched, the runic bone dice resting on the table like a promise or a tombstone. <words>436</words>
Silas turned from the kiosk and walked toward the observatory's western bearing, ready to meet the person on the other side of the wall. <words>458</words>
