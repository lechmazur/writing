The sneering envoy, Kaelen, despised the cloying scent of decay within the domed vineyard. <words>13</words>
Outside the reinforced glass, a barren alien plain stretched into a violet twilight, indifferent to his mission. <words>28</words>
He was here in this neglected greenhouse, a forgotten bubble of green on a dead world, to sift through the detritus of a dead botanist. <words>52</words>
His movements were furiously tranquil, a stark contrast to the dry leaves that whispered and swirled around his boots with every careful step. <words>76</words>
This was the final link in a chain of whispers, a paper trail that had led him across systems to this forgotten outpost. <words>99</words>
Each clue had been a breadcrumb dropped by a ghost, a map leading not to treasure, but to a truth so profound it was considered heresy. <words>126</words>
His superiors, with their polished ships and sterile boardrooms, believed power was a thing to be seized and legislated. <words>147</words>
Kaelen knew better; true power was a thing to be found, a secret to be earned, a chance to cup starlight in mortal palms. <words>174</words>
The botanist, a disgraced academic named Elara, had believed the same, and her rambling destiny had intertwined with his own. <words>196</words>
He knelt, his gloved fingers parting a brittle carpet of desiccated foliage, the rustling sound loud in the quiet dome. <words>218</words>
The search felt eternal, stretching across the hush of a possibility just born, a fragile moment where the future could pivot on the discovery of a single scrap. <words>250</words>
His sneer was a mask for the frantic hope that beat a frantic rhythm against his ribs, a desperate prayer that this was not another dead end. <words>279</words>
He was an envoy of a dying order, secretly seeking the seed of a new one. <words>295</words>
Then, his fingers brushed against something not-a-leaf, something with the crisp, deliberate edges of human artifice. <words>315</words>
He pulled it free from the soil and decaying leaves: a small, folded note, sealed with a fleck of wax impressed with a star-shaped flower. <words>343</words>
With a breath he did not realize he had been holding, he carefully unfolded the brittle paper. <words>359</words>
The note contained not a map, but a sequence of stellar coordinates and a single, cryptic phrase: "The vine remembers the star." <words>383</words>
It was enough. <words>386</words>
The paper trail was not over, merely pointing the way to its next, more dangerous leg. <words>401</words>
Standing, Kaelen looked through the swirling leaves toward the alien sky, the sneer on his face finally melting into the quiet awe of a man who had just been handed the universe. <words>436</words>
His rambling destiny had just begun, and for the first time, he felt the weight and wonder of the starlight he was chasing. <words>461</words>
