The blank-faced performer sat at the obsidian piano, its polished surface reflecting the giant, drooping ferns of the orchard. <words>19</words>
Water from the colossal falls that overshadowed the clearing crashed in a constant, soothing roar, a sound that demanded focus. <words>36</words>
This was the time for piano practice, a ritual of scales and arpeggios. <words>48</words>
But the music was secondary; it was a meditative framework for the performer's true work as the guardian of rumors. <words>68</words>
A new whisper arrived on the mist, a story of a clock that ran backwards in a forgotten town. <words>86</words>
The performer's fingers paused over the keys, their expression a perfect, impenetrable calm. <words>99</words>
This was the motivation that drove every precise action: to learn the language of dreams, and rumors were its scattered, waking dialect. <words>123</words>
To validate the new tale, the performer raised a hand, displaying a plain plastic ring on their index finger. <words>142</words>
The object was uniquely typical, a piece of mass-produced mundanity that, in this place, served as a sacred astrolabe. <words>163</words>
They peered through its perfect circle, and the world seen through it shifted. <words>176</words>
The method was esoteric but exact: by tracking moon paths, the performer could chart the legitimacy of a rumor's soul. <words>198</words>
Even in daylight, the silver trails of the moon's recent and future journeys were starkly visible to them, a celestial map of potential. <words>223</words>
The rumor about the clock was a faint, shimmering thread, and the performer watched as it drifted toward the lunar lines. <words>244</words>
It needed to align with the ghost-arc of the last full moon, a path of resonant truth. <words>262</words>
For a long moment, the thread hovered, resisting the cosmic geometry. <words>273</words>
The performer's breathing was even, their focus absolute, a state of precise madness where celestial mechanics and idle gossip were one. <words>297</words>
Then, with a soft, imperceptible tug, the rumor's thread snapped into alignment with the silver trail. <words>314</words>
The performer lowered their hand. <words>318</words>
They would approve. <words>321</words>
Their fingers returned to the keyboard, but instead of resuming the interrupted exercise, they played a single, resonant chord. <words>341</words>
The chord was not a sound of judgment but of creation, a harmonic stamp that sent the rumor out into the world, no longer a whisper but a budding fact. <words>371</words>
Somewhere, in a town shrouded by fog, the hands of a forgotten clock tower stuttered, stopped, and began to tick backwards. <words>394</words>
The blank-faced performer transitioned smoothly back into their Czerny etude, the melody weaving with the waterfall's roar, another lesson in the dream-tongue now complete. <words>422</words>
Each note played was a step deeper into the grammar of the subconscious, a world built from the approved whispers of the waking one. <words>447</words>
