Leo traced the jagged edge of the blueprint fragment, its cerulean lines a stark map against the oil-stained workbench. <words>19</words>
The reverse engineering workshop was his sanctuary, a place where he could find a strange harmony in chaos. <words>36</words>
All around him, shelves overflowed with dissected electronics and spools of old videotapes, their unwatched silence a constant, humming presence. <words>58</words>
He was a carefree gambler by trade, but this single piece of paper was the only bet he’d ever refused to hedge. <words>80</words>
A flicker on a nearby monitor, playing a degraded tape, showed a flash of white sand and turquoise water, and the island memories flooded back. <words>107</words>
He remembered the heat, the scent of salt and ozone, and Anya’s hand in his just before the engine failed. <words>128</words>
That failure was their shared secret, a catastrophic event that had paradoxically forged her faith in him, making him uniquely trustworthy in her eyes. <words>156</words>
She believed he was the only one who could navigate the fallout because he’d never panicked, not even for a second. <words>179</words>
"Anything?" Anya’s voice cut through the quiet, her reflection appearing in the dark screen beside the beach scene. <words>198</words>
He saw the exhaustion in her face, the same chaotic energy that churned inside him threatening to pull them both under. <words>222</words>
The weight of their pursuers, the complexity of the device they were trying to rebuild from a ghost of a plan, it was all becoming too much. <words>250</words>
His usual detached calm felt thin, a frayed rope over a chasm. <words>263</words>
Leo had to refocus. <words>266</words>
He pushed the fragment away, turned from the hypnotic tapes, and met her gaze directly. <words>282</words>
"The power converter," he said, his voice steady and clear. <words>292</words>
"The schematics are wrong, but the memory isn't." <words>300</words>
"I remember the way it hummed on the island, the specific pitch." <words>312</words>
A spark of understanding passed between them, the secret that bound them together now a tool, a key. <words>331</words>
Anya nodded, her own focus sharpening as she pulled a multi-core processor from a nearby bin. <words>348</words>
The frantic energy in the room didn't vanish; instead, it coalesced, bending to their will. <words>364</words>
They moved in sync, their shared past guiding their hands through the intricate present. <words>379</words>
The clatter of tools and the low drone of the monitors became a kind of rhythm, a workshop symphony. <words>398</words>
This was their hammered repose, a fragile peace forged in the heart of a storm, built not on stillness, but on perfect, synchronized motion. <words>425</words>
