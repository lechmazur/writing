The churning in Lieutenant Arion’s stomach was a familiar traitor, a malady that had plagued him across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>21</words>
He was, by every definition, a naval officer, yet the very concept of a horizon made him ill. <words>36</words>
His journey had finally ended here, at the base of a crystal fortress that speared the sky at the terminus of a rainbow canyon. <words>58</words>
Sunlight shattered through its crystalline walls, casting a thousand dancing spectrums upon the stone. <words>71</words>
Arion clutched the small, precious object in his pocket: a translucent ghost orchid bulb, the price of a universe of traded secrets. <words>93</words>
He had bartered away the star-charts of his fleet for the path to this place, a desperate exchange to confront the mirror before it lies again. <words>121</words>
Inside, the fortress was a celestial clock, its facets and angles designed for tracking moon phases with impossible precision. <words>140</words>
Each night, he would watch a new sliver of lunar light project onto the great, polished wall at the heart of the keep. <words>163</words>
He’d spent a month like this, a lonely vigil fueled by nostalgic defiance against the reflection that had defined and damned him. <words>186</words>
The mirror showed him not as he was, but as the pact demanded: a stoic, sea-faring hero, a lie that chafed against his very soul. <words>214</words>
His attempts to interact with the few crystalline caretakers of the fortress were clumsy, his inquiries punctuated by fumbling gestures and a shy, crooked smile. <words>242</words>
They found him, he suspected, awkwardly charming for a man on such a grave mission. <words>257</words>
Tonight was the full moon, the final phase required for the ritual. <words>269</words>
Arion stood before the mirror, his own queasy, uncertain face staring back from within the heroic illusion. <words>287</words>
“No more,” he whispered, his voice echoing in the vast, silent chamber. <words>298</words>
He held out the ghost orchid bulb, its pearlescent surface glowing softly in the concentrated moonlight. <words>315</words>
This was the moment to transform. <words>321</words>
He pressed the bulb against the mirror’s surface, not to shatter the glass, but to change the light it held. <words>341</words>
The bulb dissolved into the crystal, not with a flash, but with a gentle sigh of energy that rippled across the reflection. <words>363</words>
The hero’s uniform frayed into his own simple tunic, the chiseled jaw softened into his familiar, worried lines, and the steadfast eyes regained their flicker of doubt. <words>392</words>
The mirror was no longer lying; it was simply showing a man. <words>404</words>
For the first time in centuries, the roiling sea in his gut began to calm. <words>419</words>
He was still Arion, the seasick officer, but now the title felt less like a condemnation and more like a quaint, peculiar truth. <words>442</words>
He had faced the lie not with a sword, but with an acceptance so profound it rewrote the terms of the ancient, secret bargain. <words>466</words>
Turning from the honest reflection, he walked toward the fortress entrance, the ground beneath his feet finally, blessedly still. <words>486</words>
