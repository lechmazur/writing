<story>
The noble, a being of pure ennui, drifted through the endless corn maze that carpeted the haunted, pre-sentient plain. <words>19</words>
They were naively sophisticated, possessing a vast, theoretical understanding of cosmic creation but no practical experience beyond a soul-crushing, perpetual boredom. <words>41</words>
Their sole motivation, a fragile spark in the grey expanse of their consciousness, was to finally discover the power of intention. <words>61</words>
In their hand, they perpetually worried the frayed threads of a faded scarf, a lonely relic from a forgotten time when purpose might have had meaning. <words>87</words>
Suddenly, a thought that was not their own bloomed unbidden in their mind—an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event. <words>108</words>
It was a silent, magnetic summons for a rendezvous at the very heart of the impossible, whispering labyrinth. <words>127</words>
A flicker of something other than listlessness, a feeling akin to nervous energy, stirred within their conceptual form. <words>146</words>
Deciding this was the ultimate test of their nascent philosophy, they focused their will, intending with every fiber of their abstract being to find the maze's center. <words>176</words>
The corn stalks, brittle with the strange physics of non-existence, seemed to part before their focused desire, the haunted air whispering with the ghosts of lives not yet conceived. <words>209</words>
The path was not walked but willed into being, each step a silent, forceful command to the dormant reality that slumbered all around them. <words>236</words>
After an eternity that felt precisely like an instant, they arrived in a perfect, circular clearing. <words>253</words>
It was utterly, profoundly, and disappointingly empty. <words>260</words>
A wave of cosmic frustration washed over the noble; all that focused intention had culminated in this magnificent, hollow nothing. <words>283</words>
"I only wished for someone to be here," they projected into the silence, the thought less a command and more a lonely, petulant sigh. <words>308</words>
Yet, in a universe waiting for a reason, that fragile sigh was intention enough. <words>323</words>
Across the clearing, the vacant air shimmered and then coalesced into a form, an ethereal echo of the noble but with an inquisitive tilt to its head. <words>352</words>
The noble stared, dumbfounded, at the being they had literally complained into existence. <words>365</words>
The sheer, sublime absurdity of the situation—the grand quest ending in a cosmic tantrum answered by creation itself—bubbled up from their core. <words>391</words>
A sound, sharp and utterly alien, escaped them—the universe’s very first chuckle. <words>404</words>
The new being, as if by a fundamental law just written, mirrored the sound, its own version softer and more questioning. <words>425</words>
Soon they were both engulfed in a joyous cascade of shared laughter, a phenomenon so new it vibrated through the fabric of potential itself. <words>450</words>
In that moment of pure, ironic awe, the noble finally understood. <words>461</words>
The ultimate power of intention wasn't for shaping worlds or commanding the void. <words>475</words>
It was for the beautifully simple, and infinitely more profound, act of not being alone. <words>490</words>
