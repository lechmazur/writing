The train's shuddering halt at Canal Street was the only punctuation in the endless, run-on sentence of his sleeplessness. <words>19</words>
He was an insomniac poet, and his mind lived in the haunted attic of his brownstone, even as his body rattled through the city's iron veins. <words>43</words>
That attic was his sanctuary of empty abundance, a meticulously messy landscape of stacked verse and drying botanical samples. <words>64</words>
He'd collected the herbs—valerian, poppy, chamomile—not for tinctures, but as silent, wilted prayers for a peace that never came. <words>87</words>
Instead, what came were the warnings in whispers, faint as dust motes dancing in the single slanted moonbeam. <words>108</words>
They spoke of a forgotten violence, a stain on the floorboards that no amount of scrubbing could lift. <words>126</words>
His singular motivation, born from a thousand nights of listening to this spectral pain, was to discover the power of non-violence. <words>148</words>
He couldn't fight a ghost, but he believed he could understand it into silence. <words>163</words>
He had to eliminate the echo, not the voice. <words>173</words>
His method was unorthodox, found via drunken confessions at after-parties for literary magazines he no longer read. <words>194</words>
Amidst the clinking glasses and performative laughter, he would listen as intoxicated peers admitted to small, casual cruelties—a lie to a lover, a sabotaged colleague, a dismissed friend. <words>230</words>
Each confession was a tiny, bitter seed of the same violence that festered in his attic. <words>246</words>
He collected them like his desiccated flowers. <words>254</words>
Back in the attic, surrounded by his carefully cataloged mess, he would offer these stories to the whispering dark. <words>275</words>
"You are not alone in your anger," he would murmur to the chilled air, his voice a thread of empathy. <words>295</words>
"This man cheated for a promotion; this woman broke a promise for pride." <words>309</words>
He diluted the ghost's singular agony with the banal, collective sorrow of the living. <words>323</words>
He was not banishing the spirit; he was integrating its pain into a broader, more bearable tapestry of human failing. <words>344</words>
It was a slow, quiet campaign to eliminate the isolation that gave the haunting its power. <words>361</words>
The whispers hadn't vanished entirely, but they had changed, their sharp edges worn smooth by the sheer volume of shared regret. <words>385</words>
They were less a warning now and more a lament, a sound he could almost sleep to. <words>402</words>
The train lurched forward, screeching toward Prince Street, the brief pause over. <words>415</words>
For the first time in what felt like years, the poet closed his eyes, and between subway stops, he did not feel haunted, merely full. <words>441</words>
