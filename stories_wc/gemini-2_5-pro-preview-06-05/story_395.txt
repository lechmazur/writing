Marshal Kaelen pruned the gossamer-thin petals of a sky-orchid, his movements precise and dutiful on the floating island cloud spa. <words>20</words>
Inside, however, a consciously rebellious spark fought against the stiff collar of his uniform. <words>33</words>
He was not here for the therapeutic mists or the celestial horticulture; he was here to rescue the last unbound manuscripts of the poet Elara, held captive in the spa owner’s private vault. <words>66</words>
Throughout his weeks of meticulous gardening, he had mapped every security patrol and energy conduit, waiting for a sign. <words>85</words>
It arrived tucked inside the soil of a freshly potted moonpetal, a simple fortune cookie slip. <words>101</words>
The tiny paper read: “The forgotten dance begins when the sky-stage sways.” <words>113</words>
His breath caught, the words pulling him back a decade to the Sun-Chaser music festival on Titan’s rings. <words>132</words>
He remembered the pulsing nebula-light show and the shared experience of getting lost in the sound with a woman whose laughter was as sharp and brilliant as a shattered star. <words>164</words>
She was a master thief named Lyra, and he was a rookie officer, yet for three days they had moved to the same chaotic rhythm, an unexpected alliance forged in anonymity and bass drops. <words>200</words>
He had never forgotten their promise: if one ever needed the other for a truly worthy cause, the dance would begin again. <words>224</words>
Rescuing priceless literature from a gilded cage was certainly a worthy cause. <words>236</words>
Kaelen placed his shears down with ceremonial slowness, the dutiful marshal persona dissolving like sugar in rain. <words>254</words>
He walked to the garden’s main control panel, a place he was not authorized to be, and rerouted a minor atmospheric stabilizer. <words>277</words>
A low, resonant groan shuddered through the island’s crystalline foundation. <words>287</words>
The entire eastern deck, where the spa’s wealthiest patrons were enjoying sunset cocktails, began to slowly tilt. <words>305</words>
Panic erupted in gentle, well-bred shrieks as gravity shifted, a perfect and beautiful distraction. <words>320</words>
Kaelen didn’t look back at the chaos he had initiated. <words>331</words>
He moved with a fluid grace he hadn’t felt in years, his steps falling into the memory of a beat from a festival long past. <words>357</words>
The path to the vault was now clear, a direct line through the heart of the manufactured panic. <words>376</words>
He was trusting a thief, betraying his oath, and abandoning a life of rigid order for a single, desperate piece of art. <words>400</words>
Lyra would be waiting at the vault, her own part of the intricate choreography complete. <words>415</words>
Together, they would perform the final steps of this forgotten dance. <words>426</words>
The marshal was gone, and in his place was just a man about to rescue a poet’s soul, guided by a promise whispered in the heart of a cosmic concert. <words>457</words>
