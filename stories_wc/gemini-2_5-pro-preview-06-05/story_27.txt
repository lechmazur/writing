The sparrows nesting in the skeletal Ferris wheel were the only honest performers left in this park. <words>16</words>
From my haunted prize booth, I watched their simple, earnest lives unfold. <words>28</words>
My name is Alistair, and a long-dead warlock cursed me to speak only the truth, a condition that makes running a game of chance quite difficult. <words>53</words>
Most people leave in a huff when told the giant teddy bear is filled with recycled mattress foam. <words>70</words>
But not him. <words>73</words>
He was a fixture, a man named Silas whose mind was a stagnant pond of nostalgia. <words>88</words>
Every evening he came, his eyes fixed on the vintage pencil box on the top shelf. <words>105</words>
"That box," he'd say, "it's the same one I lost as a boy, the day before everything went wrong." <words>125</words>
"It is a cheap replica from 1982, and your life went wrong because you made poor choices," I would reply, as my curse demanded. <words>149</words>
He never listened, simply feeding more tokens into the ring toss slot, his hope a pathetic, flickering bulb. <words>167</words>
I saw his place in the great tapestry of fate: a single, frayed thread looping back on itself, endlessly. <words>186</words>
My motivation was not cruelty, but a desire to provoke evolution in that stagnant mind, to force a change in the pattern. <words>209</words>
So, I devised a politely vindictive solution. <words>217</words>
The next time he came, the full moon hung like a silver coin in the sky. <words>233</words>
"I have adjusted the game's physics," I told him, which was true. <words>245</words>
"You will win tonight." <words>250</words>
He did. <words>252</words>
His hands trembled as I passed the vintage pencil box over the counter. <words>266</words>
"This will not fix your past," I said, my voice calm and even. <words>279</words>
"It will only anchor you to it, a weight to hold you still until you are as much a memory as the joy you chase." <words>306</words>
As I spoke, the moonlight caught him, and the change began. <words>318</words>
It was a slow process, designed to petrify him with the phases of the moon. <words>334</words>
Each night, as the lunar sliver waned, more of him turned to grey, mottled stone. <words>350</words>
He remained at the counter, his expression shifting from triumph to confusion, and finally to a placid horror. <words>369</words>
By the time the new moon arrived, the transformation was complete. <words>381</words>
Now, a statue of a man clutching a wooden box stands before my booth, a permanent customer. <words>399</words>
The sparrows sometimes land on his shoulder, chirping their simple truths. <words>411</words>
I look at the new, unchanging thread in the tapestry and feel a layered tranquility. <words>427</words>
"You have finally stopped running," I whispered to the stone. <words>437</words>
"This is your evolution." <words>442</words>
