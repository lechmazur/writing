King Elian, ruler of the Dripping Canopy, moved with a lethargically energetic grace through his throne room of moss and mutated fern. <words>20</words>
The hiss of the ceaseless acid rain on the broadleaf roof was the only applause he ever received. <words>36</words>
His kingdom was a scrap of life huddled beneath the toxic sky, and his crown was a circlet of woven vine. <words>55</words>
He sat on a fallen log, his rough, calloused hands opening a water-warped cardboard box. <words>69</words>
Inside lay the remnants of a forgotten world: a jumble of mismatched puzzle pieces, their colors faded, their edges frayed. <words>88</words>
They were a useless inheritance, a picture that could never be whole again, yet he treasured them. <words>104</words>
His subjects, survivors hardened by this new, raw existence, saw only trash. <words>116</words>
Elian, however, sought to cradle wisdom, not rebuild monuments from their dust. <words>128</words>
He picked up a single, iridescent feather from a skitter-bird, its barbs stiff and resilient against the corrosive air. <words>147</words>
This was how he learned, how he truly connected with the prickly wonder of his world. <words>162</words>
He did not look at the pieces with his eyes, for sight was a liar here, always distorted by shimmering fumes and desperation. <words>184</words>
Instead, he began to perceive. <words>188</words>
Gently, he traced the edge of a puzzle piece with the feather's tip, feeling the ghost of a clean, machine-cut line. <words>209</words>
He felt the slickness of its printed face, a sky of impossible blue, and the pulpy, swollen texture of its damaged back. <words>230</words>
Each piece was a tiny, sealed story of a world that demanded everything fit perfectly. <words>244</words>
Another piece, shaped like a snarling beast, offered a different texture via the feather: a sharp corner, a smooth curve, a history of being forced where it did not belong. <words>274</words>
The old world had choked on its own completeness, its insistence on a single, final image. <words>290</words>
Here, in the ruin, there was no grand picture. <words>299</words>
There were only fragments, and in that fragmentation, a terrifying and beautiful freedom. <words>312</words>
The ember of choice, so often smothered by the certainty of the past, glowed brightly in the gloom of his hut. <words>333</words>
He could try to force them, to glue them into some monstrous new shape, or he could let them be. <words>352</words>
He could honor the fragment for its own sake. <words>360</words>
His movements, slow but deliberate, were a testament to his quiet energy. <words>372</words>
He perceived the weight of a hundred wrong choices in the box, the pressure to solve the unsolvable. <words>389</words>
With the feather, he nudged one piece away from the othersâ€”a sliver of a painted brick wall, mundane and solid. <words>409</words>
It was his choice, accountable to no one, meaningful only to him. <words>421</words>
He lifted this single piece and placed it on a shelf carved into the living wood of a banyan root. <words>441</words>
It was not a solution, but an answer. <words>449</words>
Wisdom was not the finished puzzle, but the strength to hold one piece in your hand and know it was enough. <words>469</words>
