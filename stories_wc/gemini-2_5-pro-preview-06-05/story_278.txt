Kael, the base's indentured sculptor, scrubbed at the rover's grime, his knuckles raw against the cold metal. <words>16</words>
Each circular motion was a prayer for oblivion, a small rebellion against the corporate masters who owned his hands but not, he swore, his soul. <words>39</words>
He was trapped here in the sterile quiet of the impact crater research base, a gilded cage where he was forced to carve monuments to their greed. <words>64</words>
A single, perfect sunbeam sliced through a high window, illuminating the garage's gloom. <words>77</words>
This was the moment he had calculated for months, a confluence of orbital mechanics and atmospheric dust that was, to any observer, theoretically spontaneous. <words>101</words>
He paused, the soapy water dripping from his sponge, his heart a slow, heavy drum against his ribs. <words>118</words>
From his pocket, he retrieved the vintage reading glasses, their wire frames delicate and worn. <words>132</words>
They had been his grandfather's, a relic from a time of books and quiet contemplation he desperately yearned to reclaim. <words>152</words>
He slipped them on, and the world transformed with a murky tenderness. <words>164</words>
The mundane dust motes kicked up from the rover's chassis were no longer random particles. <words>179</words>
Through the old lenses, he saw them for what they truly were: shimmering, interconnected threads, a cosmic lattice, the very webs of intrigue that bound him here made visible. <words>210</words>
It was a network of shimmering possibility, a loophole in the fabric of his servitude. <words>225</words>
His escape was not a plan of brute force but one of delicate physics and desperate hope. <words>242</words>
He had read the forbidden texts, the ones that spoke of the crater's unique particulate matter and its quantum properties. <words>263</words>
They described a method to disappear, a way to un-become by joining the flow of light and matter. <words>282</words>
He took a breath, the scent of cheap soap and ionized air filling his lungs for the last time. <words>299</words>
With a grace that belied his heavy, brooding frame, he stepped into the column of light. <words>316</words>
He began the dance of dust in a sunbeam, his movements slow and deliberate, mimicking the swirling motes. <words>335</words>
His form started to shimmer, the solid lines of his body blurring at the edges. <words>349</words>
The guards would see only a man having a strange, brief seizure before vanishing. <words>363</words>
But Kael felt a profound peace, a gentle unraveling as he shed the weight of his life. <words>380</words>
His flesh and bone dissolved into a million glittering points of light, each one a star in a tiny, personal galaxy. <words>400</words>
He was absorbed into the golden shaft, becoming one with the light, the dust, and the silent, spinning cosmos. <words>419</words>
The only thing to fall from the now-empty sunbeam was a pair of vintage reading glasses, which clattered softly onto the concrete floor. <words>442</words>
They lay there, lenses reflecting a space where a man had just been, a final, quiet testament to an escape not of this world. <words>466</words>
