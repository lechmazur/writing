Kael’s boots hammered a furious rhythm against the cracked permacrete of the abandoned flight deck. <words>14</words>
He was jogging, though it felt more like he was trying to outrun the ghost of his own life. <words>31</words>
Each ragged breath was a curse against the rust-colored dust, the silent, skeletal starships, and the promise he was failing to keep. <words>53</words>
His motivation was absurd, a fool’s errand whispered to him on a deathbed: to find hidden waterfalls on this gods-forsaken desert moon. <words>79</words>
It was a quest born from his heart’s revolt, a stupid, mutinous organ that refused to accept the cold, hard logic of his smuggling trade. <words>106</words>
He skidded to a halt near the command tower’s shadow, his chest heaving with something more than just exertion. <words>126</words>
This was his ritual, his pathetic attempt to memorialize her. <words>137</words>
From a pouch on his belt, he pulled a dented metal flask and a single, splintering chopstick. <words>155</words>
The chopstick had been hers, a cheap souvenir from a noodle bar on a world now probably glassed over. <words>176</words>
"Right then," he growled, the tone a perfect blend of biting sincerity and utter self-loathing, "let's see the magic." <words>197</words>
He uncapped the flask and used the chopstick to stir the cold, sludgy tea within, his chosen method for this farce. <words>220</words>
He was supposed to find her waterfalls through patterns in tea leaves, a piece of folklore she’d found beautiful and he’d found idiotic. <words>246</words>
Her absence was an abstractly physical weight, a phantom pressure on his skin and a void in the air beside him that the twin suns couldn't warm. <words>277</words>
With a sneer, he tipped the flask, letting the dregs spill onto a flat, sun-bleached plate of metal debris. <words>298</words>
The leaves formed a meaningless, muddy smear. <words>305</words>
Rage, clean and familiar, surged through him. <words>312</words>
He raised the flask to hurl it against the nearest bulkhead, to shatter this last, fragile connection. <words>330</words>
But his arm froze. <words>334</words>
His gaze dropped back to the leaves, and he forced himself to look, truly look, past the anger. <words>352</words>
There, a faint line snaked away from a dark clump, forking just like the canyons in the geological survey he’d stolen and memorized. <words>377</words>
It was probably nothing, a trick of the light, a desperate projection of a broken mind. <words>394</words>
Still, he carefully picked up the single chopstick, the wood a familiar anchor in his palm. <words>411</words>
He tucked it away, his jaw tight with resentment for the hope blooming poisonously in his chest. <words>429</words>
Turning west, toward the canyons, Kael started jogging again, a bitter man running toward a miracle he desperately wanted to deny. <words>452</words>
