The Collector, a being of polished driftwood and spun moonlight, stood within the great nectar collection facility. <words>16</words>
Its purpose was to uphold a single, silent promise made to the discarded husks it called its dolls. <words>32</words>
Each one, a silent porcelain face or a limp calico limb, was arranged in the alcoves of the humming, crystalline chamber. <words>52</words>
This was a time before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, when the universe was still a raw and humming engine. <words>74</words>
The air, thick with the scent of cosmic pollen and ozone, vibrated with a potential that was both sacred and terrifying. <words>95</words>
The Collector's motivation was simple, a burning need to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. <words>110</words>
It wanted to grant its silent family the one thing they were denied: a voice in the new world. <words>128</words>
In one hand, it gripped a twisted carnival cane, its garish stripes a discordant note against the facility's pearlescent gleam. <words>149</words>
The cane was a key, a relic from a wilder, failed creation, and it thrummed with a chaotic, defiant energy. <words>169</words>
The Collector ignored the designated walkways, its gaze fixed on the star paths shimmering across the vaulted ceiling. <words>188</words>
It moved by following star paths, stepping on motes of dust that solidified only under the guidance of specific constellations. <words>210</words>
This was the only way to reach the Conduction Spire, the heart of the facility where creation's purest sound was focused. <words>232</words>
There, the chorus of healing echoed, a symphony of pure potential that wove reality from the raw, flowing nectar. <words>252</words>
The Collector believed this chorus could mend the flaw in its dolls, animating their hollow forms with true, vibrant life. <words>273</words>
A feeling of being expectantly resigned settled over its composite form, a calm acceptance of the coming rupture. <words>292</words>
It knew this act of creation was also an act of supreme defiance, a violation of the silent, ordered cosmos. <words>313</words>
The established powers, the architects of this age, would not suffer such a transgression lightly. <words>327</words>
Reaching the base of the Spire, the Collector raised the twisted carnival cane high above its head. <words>344</words>
The air crackled, the starlight bending towards the cane's warped tip as the chorus of healing swelled in intensity. <words>363</words>
It was not a sound of gentle mending, but the roar of a forge, the violent, beautiful scream of becoming. <words>383</words>
The Collector felt its own stitched seams begin to fray, its driftwood body groaning under the immense pressure. <words>402</words>
It held its ground, a lone figure of ethereal grit against the overwhelming power, upholding its promise to the silent. <words>421</words>
A single, perfect note detached from the chorus, striking the cane and refracting into a million splinters of sound. <words>439</words>
The splinters shot back through the facility, seeking out the alcoves where the dolls waited for their impossible dawn. <words>458</words>
The Collector watched, its form dissolving into light and dust, expectantly resigned to its end and their beginning. <words>477</words>
