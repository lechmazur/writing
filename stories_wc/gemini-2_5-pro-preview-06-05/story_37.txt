The sterile air of the doctor’s waiting room felt a universe away from the life I was trying to build. <words>18</words>

It had all started with a simple detour to avoid a construction zone, a mundane choice that had rerouted my entire existence. <words>59</words>
The unpaved road had led me not to the highway, but to the base of a great ceiba tree, where a rope lift ascended into the mists of a rainforest canopy village. <words>91</words>
Up there, suspended between the clouds and the forest floor, I found the one place my reputation hadn't preceded me. <words>112</words>
They were a people of birdsong and intricate knots, and they saw not a con artist, but a man searching for an anchor. <words>135</words>

Standing on the highest platform at dawn, I took a deep breath and, for the first time in my life, performed an act of pure, unadulterated creation. <words>375</words>
I let out a yodel, not of the alpine variety, but a complex, cascading call that echoed the sheet music’s every twist and turn. <words>402</words>

A small hand slipped into mine, and I looked down at the little boy I was now sworn to protect, his eyes wide with the same earnest whimsy as the song. <words>447</words>
“Leo?” the nurse called from the doorway, her voice breaking the memory. <words>460</words>
