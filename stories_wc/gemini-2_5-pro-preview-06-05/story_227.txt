Kael sat on the cracked vinyl of a waiting area bench, the only movement in a world stuck in amber. <words>18</words>
Outside the grimy dome of the abandoned spaceport, the sun still arced its slow, defiant path across the sky. <words>36</words>
A colossal, silent chronometer on the far wall was forever frozen, its crimson digits reading 00:00:01. <words>52</words>
This final second, stretched into an eternity by some forgotten cataclysm or cosmic joke, was the prison he sought to dismantle. <words>72</words>
His was a subtle uprising, fought not with energy blasts but with whispers of forgotten knowledge. <words>88</words>
He was an underdog magician, a reader of the static that hummed beneath the silence, his only goal to decode dream symbols. <words>109</words>
The collective unconscious of the trapped populace was the only place anything still happened, and he was its sole cartographer. <words>129</words>
He believed the dreams held the key, the sequence to force the final tick of the clock. <words>146</words>
His method was painstakingly simple: by tracking sun patterns as they sliced through the dusty air. <words>163</words>
Each day, he charted the precise angle of the light, the way it illuminated different faded advertisements for off-world colonies. <words>184</words>
He would then turn to the antique brass microscope on the table beside him, a relic from a different kind of explorer. <words>206</words>
He wasn't studying microbes, but motes of dust captured in the sunbeams, believing they held a resonant imprint of the day's dreams. <words>231</words>
He adjusted the focus, his brow furrowed in concentration. <words>240</words>
A recurring symbol had haunted him for weeks: a serpent eating its own tail, but with the head of a weeping clock. <words>262</words>
He felt the familiar sensation of being drainingly invigorated, the mental exhaustion of his work warring with the electric thrill of proximity to an answer. <words>289</words>
A memory surfaced of his mentor laughing at his theories, calling them "the delusions of a boy who polishes dust," and he had to cringe. <words>316</words>
The scorn had fueled him then, and its phantom sting fueled him now. <words>330</words>
He leaned back into the microscope, aligning the shaft of light with a new notation in his journal. <words>349</words>
The dust motes under the lens swirled, not randomly, but into a familiar, horrifying shape. <words>366</words>
It was the weeping clock-serpent, perfectly formed for a fraction of a moment. <words>379</words>
He realized the symbol wasn't a loop of time, but a lock. <words>392</words>
The sunbeam wasn't just a light source; it was the key, and he had just seen how it fit. <words>412</words>
A slow, placid smile touched Kael's lips, a quiet act of rebellion in the face of frozen infinity. <words>431</words>
The great clock still read one second, but for the first time, Kael knew it was blinking. <words>448</words>
