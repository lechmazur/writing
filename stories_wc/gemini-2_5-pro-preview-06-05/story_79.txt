Sheriff Brody stood inside the scientific poetry library, a man made of straight lines and hard truths in a room built from curves and questions. <words>24</words> The midday lull had descended, suspending dust motes in buttery shafts of light and muffling the world outside the tall arched windows. <words>46</words> Here, the silence wasn't empty; it was the echo of quiet, the resonant hum left behind after a town’s collective scream had faded. <words>69</words> He moved with a ghostly resolve, his boots making no sound on the worn oriental rug that snaked between shelves of books on quantum verse and stellar elegies. <words>98</words> His uniform felt stiff and wrong, a costume for a play that had ended weeks ago with the wail of his own siren. <words>121</words>

From his pocket, he drew a tarnished silver chain, its links dulled with memory and time. <words>137</words> It had been hers. <words>141</words> The weight of it in his palm was the anchor for the dirge that had been playing in his head ever since, a relentless funeral march he had to disrupt. <words>172</words> He was here to let a single note defeat an entire dirge, a desperate sort of physics he hoped to learn. <words>193</words> This was how he had decided to rebel. <words>201</words> Not with fury or with his fists, but with the hushed defiance of seeking a new kind of pattern. <words>221</words>

He found the astronomy aisle, where books promised to explain the cosmos through sonnets and free verse. <words>239</words> His mission was specific: he needed to understand the end of a journey, not just the fact of it. <words>259</words> He began his method, pulling down a heavy tome titled "The Meteor's Pathos" and opening it on a lectern. <words>280</words> He would trace the path of falling stars. <words>289</words> The book detailed the Perseids, the very shower that had lit the sky on that final night. <words>308</words> As his calloused finger followed a diagram of a meteoroid’s trajectory—a streak of ice and rock burning through the atmosphere—the illustration seemed to shimmer. <words>338</words> The stark black ink on the creamy page became ethereally physical, a fleeting scar of light he could almost feel under his skin. <words>361</words>

He wasn't just reading about orbital decay; he was charting the anatomy of a final, brilliant flash. <words>380</words> It was a celestial body, obeying the laws of gravity and heat, surrendering to its nature in a blaze of glory. <words>402</words> The thought was not a comfort, but it was a truth, clean and sharp like a shard of glass. <words>421</words> It was a single, clear note of scientific fact that cut through the muddy, chaotic music of his grief. <words>441</words> Closing the book, Brody curled his fingers around the cool, tarnished silver chain. <words>454</words> The dirge had not ended, but for the first time, he could hear a space between its crushing chords. <words>474</words>
