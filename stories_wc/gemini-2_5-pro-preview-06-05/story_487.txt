Len, a man built like a brick wall but with the soul of a sleepy bear, knelt on the damp earth. <17>
The relentless, chaotic pulse of a drum solo echoed from a portable speaker he’d brought, a jarring soundtrack for the humid quiet of the greenhouse labyrinth. <39>
His huge, calloused fingers gently handled the fragile, yellowed scraps he’d pieced together from a shredded treasure map found under his floorboards. <64>
The map’s script was foreign, a swirl of characters he couldn’t decipher, so he’d navigated the maze of snapping pitcher plants and strangler figs using only the crude drawings. <94>
He was disturbingly calm as a Venus flytrap the size of a small dog snapped shut inches from his face. <112>
People called him simple, but they didn't understand his singular motivation: to take a whispered story and mold a myth from the mud of reality for them. <141>
He wanted to give them a legend more real than their poverty. <152>
The map’s final symbol, a jagged lightning bolt, pointed to the base of a colossal, dormant corpse flower. <171>
There, half-buried in the rich, dark soil, was a slender ebony rod capped with silver. <186>
It was the conductor’s baton, the one rumored to raise the dead. <198>
A thick, thorny vine had wrapped around it, anchoring it to the monstrous plant. <212>
Len didn’t try to pull or cut it; he saw the way the thorns interlocked. <227>
With a slow, deliberate motion, he began to twist the vine, following its natural coil. <242>
The drum solo on the speaker hit a frantic crescendo, each cymbal crash seeming to shake the giant petals of the surrounding flora. <265>
The thorns scraped against the baton, but the vine loosened with each careful rotation. <279>
He felt a final pop as the vine released its prize. <289>
Len picked up the baton, its polished surface cool against his skin. <300>
The air, once thick with tension, seemed to exhale as the drum solo faded into a softer, more rhythmic beat. <320>
He looked at the object in his hand, a tool of impossible power according to the stories. <337>
He had no interest in necromancy or disturbing the peace of the departed. <351>
His quest was never about waking the dead, but about awakening hope in the living. <366>
He had wrestled a fairy tale from a place of death and danger. <379>
With a faint, gentle smile that seemed at odds with his brutal surroundings, he turned to leave the labyrinth. <399>
He held the baton not like a weapon or a wand, but like a promise he was bringing back to his people. <420>
It was a brash and tender offering, a solid piece of a myth they could now all touch. <437>
The new, steady drumbeat was the sound of his heart, finally calm. <450>
