Kael, the city’s sole rooftop orchardist, moved with a solemn grace among his bio-luminescent apple trees. <words>16</words>
The chrome spires below hummed with a billion disconnected lives, a sound he worked tirelessly to forget. <words>32</words>
His singular motivation was to find some genuine connection in this world of synthetic everything. <words>47</words>
“Is that one real?” a voice chirped, endearingly irritating and far too close to his prized Moon-blossom graft. <words>65</words>
It was the girl again, the overlooked child from the sub-level warrens, who treated his security fence like a suggestion. <words>84</words>
She had a smudge of grease on her cheek and held out a grimy hand. <words>98</words>
“Found this,” she said, dropping a plain key into his palm. <words>110</words>
It was ancient, made of simple iron, a stark contrast to the polymer and light that built their world. <words>128</words>
Kael’s own project was far more complex: he was trying to x-out the ghost of his former self from the omnipresent Civic Ledger. <words>151</words>
He needed to erase the data-trail of the man he used to be, a corporate drone whose life had felt like a long, flat line. <words>176</words>
Weeks of searching for a network blind spot had yielded nothing but frustration. <words>189</words>
“It’s for the whisper-box,” the girl insisted, pointing a small finger at the garden’s central atmospheric processor. <words>207</words>
He’d always seen the processor as a single, sealed unit, a black box of automated climate control. <words>225</words>
But now, following her gaze, he saw a tiny, almost invisible seam outlining a small panel he’d never noticed. <words>244</words>
In its center was a keyhole, not a port or a scanner, but a simple, mechanical lock. <words>261</words>
His breath caught, a feeling of excited restraint tightening his chest as he slid the plain key into the lock. <words>282</words>
It turned with a soft, satisfying click. <words>289</words>
Behind the panel was not a tangle of fiber optics, but a single, forgotten hardline port—a direct link to the city’s old, unmonitored sub-nets. <words>315</words>
This was it, his chance to finally x-out his past and disappear completely. <words>329</words>
He plugged in his slate, the command prompt for deletion blinking, waiting. <words>341</words>
But the port wasn’t just an exit; it was a doorway. <words>352</words>
He could see faint traces of other users, other forgotten people communicating on this hidden frequency, their lives interconnected in a fragile, secret web. <words>377</words>
They weren’t hiding to erase themselves, but to find each other. <words>388</words>
In the hush between two heartbeats, Kael looked from the blinking cursor to the girl, who was now carefully polishing an apple on her sleeve. <words>414</words>
Connection wasn’t about deletion; it was about addition. <words>422</words>
He deleted the command and instead typed a simple, anonymous message into the void: “Hello.” <words>436</words>
A moment later, a reply blinked back: “Welcome to the garden.” <words>447</words>
