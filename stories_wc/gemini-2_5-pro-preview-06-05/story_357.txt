The sudden invitation to a party was, frankly, an imposition on my carefully curated solitude. <words>14</words>
Still, one must occasionally venture out to triumph over the alpha predator called despair, and a board game night seemed a suitably absurd arena for it. <words>38</words>
My friend called the game Frost Giant’s Lair, a fittingly chilly title for the evening’s main event. <words>55</words>
As the first round began, I slipped into my role as the focused collector, hoarding victory points with a quiet, methodical intensity that my friends found seldom odd. <words>83</words>
“Someone’s trying to win,” Sarah teased, sliding her meeple onto a valuable territory. <words>94</words>
“Always,” I replied, my flippancy a thin veneer over the earnest, desperate need to control this tiny, cardboard world. <words>112</words>
The second round saw my strategy falter, a bad dice roll feeling less like chance and more like a targeted strike from an old, familiar enemy. <words>138</words>
My mind flashed to my journal at home, to the brittle black rose pinned beside the date despair had first sunk its teeth into me. <words>164</words>
I was a collector of moments, and that one was the centerpiece of a collection I never wanted. <words>181</words>
Throughout the third round, the giant’s lair on the board felt indistinguishable from the cold cavern in my own chest. <words>202</words>
Each move my opponents made seemed to echo the predator’s steps, circling closer. <words>214</words>
My focus narrowed to a razor’s edge; this wasn't a game, it was a hunt, and I refused to be the prey. <words>237</words>
The final rounds blurred into a tense montage of plastic tokens and whispered strategy. <words>251</words>
Then came the pivotal moment, a chance to sacrifice my strongest piece for a staggering, all-or-nothing gamble. <words>270</words>
It was a move designed to unravel a player, to leave them exposed and ruined if it failed. <words>288</words>
My friends stared, waiting. <words>292</words>
I thought of the rose, preserved under glass, a perfect monument to loss. <words>305</words>
Despair fed on caution, on the quiet retreat into solitude where it could feast undisturbed. <words>321</words>
Tonight, I would starve the beast. <words>327</words>
With a steady hand that betrayed the tremor in my soul, I pushed my champion forward into the giant’s maw. <words>348</words>
“Well,” I announced to the stunned silence, “go big or go home to your emotionally distant fortress, right?” <words>366</words>
The table erupted as the consequences of my move cascaded across the board, a beautiful, unpredictable chaos. <words>383</words>
I didn’t win the game. <words>388</words>
But as I walked home under the cold stars, I felt the giant’s grip loosen, the predator’s shadow recede. <words>409</words>
Embracing solitude was one thing; weaponizing it in a sudden, glorious, and public failure was a triumph of an entirely different, and much warmer, kind. <words>438</words>
