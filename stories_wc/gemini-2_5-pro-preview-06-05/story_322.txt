I am Alistair, a humble traveling salesman of the exquisitely useless, and this is my workshop: the silent abyss. <words>18</words>
My current project, resting on a velvet cloth, was a simple rustic water pitcher, though its simplicity was a masterwork of deception. <words>38</words>
It was a vessel crafted through one of the many vanishing arts, the subtle craft of capturing echoes. <words>55</words>
"A tragic flaw, you see," I murmured to the listening dark, "is that echoes can leak." <words>71</words>
The repairs would take time, but my methods, while peculiar, were precise. <words>84</words>
My primary task was to quantify the loss, to measure the silence seeping from the hairline fractures. <words>101</words>
I suspended a silver locket over the largest crack, setting it to swing with the rhythm of a pendulum. <words>119</words>
It was a rationally whimsical approach, I’ll grant you, but how else does one count the ghosts of forgotten conversations? <words>139</words>
Each swing that faltered, each subtle hesitation in the arc, marked a memory that had escaped into the void. <words>157</words>
One stutter for a lover's promise, another for a child's first word, a third for the sound of rain on a tin roof generations ago. <words>181</words>
Throughout the repairs, I charted these spectral metrics in my ledger, my brow furrowed in what I hoped passed for academic concentration. <words>204</words>
You might call it a fool's errand, this obsessive accounting of the intangible, but it is my life's work. <words>223</words>
For I believe, with a sincerity that even I find faintly amusing, that these lost arts and their fractured relics hold the key. <words>245</words>
My true motivation, you see, is to learn the true meaning of interconnectedness by mapping the holes it leaves behind. <words>266</words>
How can one appreciate the tapestry without first measuring the length of its frayed threads? <words>282</words>
With each fracture I sealed with gold-dust and whispered apologies, the pendulum's swing grew more confident, more serene. <words>301</words>
I was not merely fixing a piece of pottery; I was mending a tiny rupture in the fabric of what-was. <words>321</words>
The art of the echo-catchers was not about pottery at all, but about binding moments together, ensuring no person or feeling was ever truly an island. <words>347</words>
They understood that a shared memory was the strongest glue in the universe. <words>361</words>
As I applied the final sealant, the locket swung in a perfect, unbroken cadence, a silent metronome in the vast quiet. <words>382</words>
The abyss around me felt, for the first time, just a little less empty. <words>396</words>
I held the pitcher to my ear and heard not a grand chorus, but the faint, contented hum of a story made whole again. <words>419</words>
"Item repaired, loss quantified, interconnectedness… provisionally understood," I dictated to my ledger with a self-deprecating smile. <words>437</words>
Another oddity saved from oblivion, another lesson learned for the man who sells ghosts their homes back. <words>455</words>
