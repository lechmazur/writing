Elara traced the fissure in the iridescent object resting on her stall's velvet cloth, a cracked scale from a beast long turned to myth. <words>22</words>
The floating marketplace of Aeridor creaked around her, a city of canvas and wicker tethered to a fleet of groaning hot air balloons. <words>44</words>
Below, clouds swirled like spilled milk, and the scent of fried sky-eels mixed with the ozone of a coming storm. <words>63</words>
This place was technically wild, a haven for strange commerce beyond the reach of any kingdom's laws. <words>80</words>
She was an alchemist, but a deeply uncertain one, more interested in botany than eternal life. <words>96</words>
Her true passion, the reason she braved this chaotic bazaar, was to map forest trails on the quiet earth far below. <words>117</words>
Each sale of a minor potion or charm funded another expedition into the green, breathing world she missed. <words>135</words>
The scale, however, was different; it was a key. <words>144</words>
It promised a life without end, but she had seen the cost in the hollow eyes of the few who'd achieved itâ€”a static existence, a prison of unchanging perspective. <words>177</words>
The price of immortality wasn't death, but the death of all that made life worth mapping. <words>195</words>
A wealthy merchant, his face a mask of greedy hope, was approaching her stall to make his final offer for the artifact. <words>218</words>
The market seemed to hold its breath, the usual cacophony of haggling and music falling away into a sudden, profound quiet. <words>240</words>
It felt like the hush before the judge reads the verdict, a moment suspended in time where her entire future would be decided. <words>264</words>
Would she sell the key to a gilded cage and fund a lifetime of passionless wandering, or would she reject it? <words>285</words>
Her gaze dropped from the merchant's expectant face to the floor of her stall, a single slab of centuries-old marble, worn and scarred. <words>310</words>
To others, it was just damage. <words>316</words>
To her, it was a library. <words>322</words>
She had a duty to safeguard the memory of the living world, not abandon it. <words>338</words>
With a subtle shuffle of her worn leather boot, she began to trace a new line among the existing patterns, her movements precise and deliberate. <words>362</words>
This was her method to protect her work: through the coded scuffs on a centuries-old marble floor, she was logging the path to a hidden waterfall she'd discovered last week. <words>395</words>
Each scratch was a landmark, each scuff a turn in the trail, a mundane miracle of memory preserved in stone. <words>416</words>
The merchant cleared his throat, the sound jarring in the stillness. <words>427</words>
Elara looked up, her uncertainty finally gone, and gently pushed the cracked scale back into a dusty wooden box. <words>447</words>
"It is not for sale," she said, her voice clear and steady as the ancient ground she longed for. <words>465</words>
A quiet smile touched her lips as the marketplace noise slowly returned, her verdict delivered. <words>480</words>
