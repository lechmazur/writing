Elara, the last archivist of the golden age, felt smaller than ever within the giant's workshop. <words>16</words>
Sunlight, fractured through a colossal, cracked skylight, illuminated dust motes dancing over tools the size of fallen gods. <words>34</words>
Her official duty, throughout this supposed golden age, was to chronicle its unending prosperity, a task that felt increasingly like a lie. <words>55</words>
The catalyst was a simple thing she'd found tucked inside a half-carved mountain peak: an empty coin purse, stitched from hide and big enough to hold a man. <words>84</words>
It was the ultimate symbol of their era's broken precedents, a promise of wealth with nothing inside. <words>102</words>
She clutched the hollow artifact, her resolve hardening. <words>109</words>
Her true purpose was not to polish the gilded cage but to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners of their history. <words>131</words>
The official records were useless, their narratives as smooth and featureless as the giants' polished anvils. <words>147</words>
But the workshop floor held a different kind of story. <words>157</words>
Etched into the stone was a sprawling, intricate pattern, a map disguised as decoration. <words>171</words>
She realized it was a key, a method to find the truth through the pattern of a labyrinth's path. <words>189</words>
For weeks, she walked its winding ways, her soft shoes whispering against the stone. <words>203</words>
The design was precisely playful, a game of logic and misdirection left by the workshop's absent masters. <words>221</words>
One corridor, spiraling like a wood shaving, led her to scorch marks that contradicted the official tales of peaceful creation. <words>242</words>
Another path, doubling back on itself with mocking intelligence, revealed hidden compartments containing schematics for weapons, not wonders. <words>263</words>
Each twist and turn was a new verse in a secret history of deceit, shattering the beautiful, fragile myths she was paid to protect. <words>287</words>
The golden age was not a gift from the giants; it was a meticulously crafted prison for the minds of her people. <words>309</words>
Finally, she reached the labyrinth's center, a single, smooth stone circle beneath the broken skylight. <words>325</words>
Standing there, she understood the final, terrible punchline of the giants' game. <words>338</words>
The labyrinth wasn't a map to a hidden treasure; the labyrinth *was* the treasure, the truth itself laid bare for anyone willing to walk the path. <words>366</words>
The pattern was the confession. <words>371</words>
Her uncertainty had evaporated, replaced by a cold, clear purpose. <words>381</words>
She now possessed the one tool more powerful than any giant's hammer. <words>393</words>
She had the truth, and with it, she would unmask an entire age. <words>406</words>
Her footsteps echoed as she turned to leave, ready to show the world the beautiful, terrible pattern and the hollowness it represented. <words>429</words>
The sparks in the corners were about to become an inferno. <words>441</words>
