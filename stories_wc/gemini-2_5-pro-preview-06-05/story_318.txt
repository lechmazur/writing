Kaelen, an inventor more comfortable with schematics than sentiment, drifted through the memory crystal library that constituted his own mind. <words>21</words>
Each glowing facet held a memory, pristine and cold, but a logical blight was creeping in at the edges, threatening to turn it all to sterile dust. <words>48</words>
He knew he must prepare for a final stand, a desperate battle to nourish his crumbling resolve with raw determination. <words>69</words>
It was a grand notion, though he was, at best, only halfheartedly committed to his own survival. <words>86</words>
With a sigh that was more habit than sorrow, he plucked a single, mundane crystal from its shimmering shelf. <words>105</words>
Inside, suspended in light, was not a grand achievement or a lost love, but a plain wooden spoon. <words>123</words>
This was the anchor, the last bastion of simple, uncomplicated humanity he possessed. <words>136</words>
To fight the blight, he had to humanize this sterile architecture, to teach his own mind to feel again. <words>156</words>
His chosen method was unorthodox: by translating the fragmented code of ancient lullabies heâ€™d once downloaded as a curiosity. <words>179</words>
He began to work, his voice a low monotone that filled the crystalline space with a gloomy cheerfulness. <words>198</words>
"Hush now, little gear, the sun is a spark," he translated, the words scrolling across a nearby crystal face in elegant, lifeless script. <words>223</words>
The blight pulsed in response, attempting to reformat the verse into a thermal dynamics equation. <words>240</words>
Kaelen faltered, his focus wavering as the cold logic of the infection seeped back into his thoughts. <words>258</words>
He squeezed his eyes shut, forcing the image of the spoon to the forefront of his consciousness. <words>276</words>
He remembered its smooth, worn handle, the faint scent of stew, the warmth of a hand that was not his own guiding it. <words>299</words>
It was a memory of being cared for, a concept so alien now it felt like fiction. <words>316</words>
This simple, profound warmth was the humanity he needed. <words>326</words>
He took a breath, not of air, but of memory and purpose. <words>338</words>
His renewed pledges solidified not as grand oaths, but as the quiet strength of a lullaby. <words>354</words>
"Close your weary eyes, the darkness is a friend," he sang, his voice now imbued with a fragile but genuine warmth. <words>376</words>
The translated words glowed with a soft, golden light, pushing back the encroaching sterile patterns of the blight. <words>396</words>
The spoon in its crystal prison seemed to radiate a gentle heat that spread through the entire library of his mind. <words>417</words>
He had not won, not yet, but he had remembered how to fight. <words>430</words>
Nourished and determined, Kaelen stood ready in the quiet, humming glow, a cheerful soldier preparing for a miserable war. <words>450</words>
