I have spent a lifetime listening to ghosts, though I believe in neither. <words>12</words>
My only faith rests in the physics of memory, the way a sound can cling to stone for ages. <words>28</words>
This forgotten library, coiled within the salt-bleached bones of a lighthouse, has been my laboratory across the hush of a borrowed century. <words>51</words>
Dust motes dance in the single beam of moonlight, illuminating the brass rings of the astronomical globe that dominates the room. <words>75</words>
It is a foolishly arrogant device, pretending to map the heavens, but I have humbly repurposed it to chart the far more chaotic geography of a single, lost moment. <words>107</words>
My goal has always been to harness the ephemeral, to take a wisp of what was and give it the weight of what is. <words>132</words>
Tonight, I feel the century of effort narrowing to this single point in time. <words>146</words>
My hands, steady despite their age, trace the constellations I have etched over the globe’s surface, not of stars, but of resonant frequencies. <words>172</words>
Each line connects the silence of this lighthouse to the specific acoustic signature of a canyon a world away. <words>192</words>
I close my eyes and speak the anchoring words, my voice a low rasp against the quiet hum of the globe. <words>213</words>
The air grows cold, thick with the ozone tang of a coming storm or a coming miracle. <words>230</words>
And then it begins. <words>234</words>
It is not a sound that fills the room, but the shape of one; the echo of a voice in a canyon, calling a name I have long since forgotten. <words>263</words>
The globe shudders, its brass rings spinning to align with the spectral vibration. <words>277</words>
A faint light pulses from within its core, a captured star trying to be born again. <words>294</words>
I watch, my cynicism a thin shield against the terrifying hope blooming in my chest. <words>310</words>
The light flickers, and for a breathtaking instant, a face forms in the swirling dust between me and the globe—a woman’s face, her expression one of profound, lonely surprise. <words>344</words>
She is here, and she is not. <words>351</words>
We are two solitary points of light in an endless dark, her trapped in a moment, me trapped in this tower. <words>372</words>
This is the shared isolation I had sought to break, but have only managed to perfect. <words>388</words>
The echo fades, the face dissolves back into motes of dust, and the globe slows its spin. <words>406</words>
I do not feel triumph, only the familiar, eerie nostalgia for a connection that was almost real. <words>423</words>
I am the greatest conjurer of my age, a master of echoes and dust, yet I cannot make her awaken fully. <words>444</words>
I can only bring her here, to this quiet room, to be alone with me. <words>459</words>
Tomorrow, I will try again. <words>464</words>
