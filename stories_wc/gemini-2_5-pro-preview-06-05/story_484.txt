Alistair the brewer, groggy as ever, decided the haunted mansion’s graveyard was a terrible place for a nap, but an excellent spot for cosmic intervention. <words>23</words>
Beyond the wrought-iron fence, the protest had fallen into a temporary lull, a shared intake of breath before the chants for justice began anew. <words>46</words>
He clutched a shard of a broken mirror in his pocket, its edge a sharp reminder of why he was here: to become a living embodiment of his values, which mostly involved purity, patience, and things not turning into soul-eating sludge. <words>91</words>
“Right, let’s get on with it,” he muttered to a crumbling angel, his voice a perfect blend of flippant solemnity. <words>111</words>
The encroaching darkness inside the mansion felt like a bad smell you couldn't quite place, a physical weight in the air. <words>133</words>
It was a uniquely generic sort of evil, the kind that wallpapered over its true horror with dusty portraits and peeling paint. <words>156</words>
He’d been told the heart of the rot was subtle, a weak point to be exploited. <words>173</words>
His boots echoed up the grand, dusty spiral staircase, each step a deliberate beat against the growing silence from outside. <words>194</words>
And there it was, halfway up the ascent: the slightest discoloration on a marble step, a faint, sickly green marring the stone. <words>219</words>
It looked like spilled wine from a century past, utterly mundane yet radiating a profound wrongness. <words>236</words>
This was the nexus, the entry point he had to seal. <words>248</words>
He knew he had to initiate the cleansing now, before the darkness set permanently and the voices outside were silenced for good. <words>272</words>
Alistair pulled out the mirror shard, angling it to catch a sliver of defiant moonlight from a high, grimy window. <words>294</words>
The reflected light was not pure; it was warped, carrying an image of his own tired, determined face. <words>313</words>
He focused that distorted beam directly onto the stain. <words>322</words>
A low hum began, not of sound but of pressure, as the focused point of light and intention pushed back against the ancient corruption. <words>346</words>
The discoloration sizzled, shrinking like a slug in salt as the light intensified. <words>361</words>
He held his ground, a brewer forcing a bad batch to turn, his entire being concentrated on this single, simple act of purification. <words>386</words>
As the last of the stain vanished with a faint pop, the oppressive atmosphere in the mansion lifted, replaced by the simple smell of dust and decay. <words>416</words>
Outside, a single voice rose, and then another, and soon a roar of unified defiance swelled to fill the night. <words>439</words>
Alistair pocketed the now-warm mirror shard and trudged back down the stairs. <words>452</words>
“Well,” he sighed, “that’s that taken care of.” <words>461</words>
“Time for a pint.” <words>465</words>
