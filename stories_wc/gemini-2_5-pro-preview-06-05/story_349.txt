The air in the abandoned observatory was thick with the ghosts of starlight and dust. <14>
Kael, who once navigated the sky with a joystick, now stood on a cliff overlooking a valley he couldn't escape. <31>
Below, the lord’s apple orchard waited in the final, heavy hush before the axes would fall to clear land for a quarry. <52>
A charred serenity settled in his bones, the quiet acceptance of a world burned clean of everything he knew. <70>
His motivation was simple: to lure possibility from the brink of despair, even if he thought possibility was a fool’s game. <91>
He was cynically hopeful, a state of mind he found both exhausting and necessary for survival. <106>
It was a feeling solidified by an encounter at what the locals called the Pairing Fair, a frantic event that felt unnervingly like speed dating for the desperate and the displaced. <138>
He had sat awkwardly across from farmers, weavers, and guards, a man with useless skills and a story no one would believe. <160>
Then came Elara, an herbalist with eyes that saw the static behind his own. <174>
She hadn't offered pity or a place, but simply pushed a dried herb bundle into his hand, its scent earthy and strange. <196>
“Some things only grow after a fire,” she’d whispered, her gaze fixed on the horizon. <211>
“Disseminate this when you feel the end is not an end.” <222>
Now, clutching that brittle bouquet, Kael finally understood. <230>
He wasn't just a drone pilot lost in a medieval fantasy realm; he was a survivor on a new shore. <248>
The observatory’s broken dome framed a sky without satellites, a clean slate of terrifying freedom. <264>
He began to crumble the dried herb bundle between his palms, its seeds and desiccated petals falling like ash. <282>
This wasn't about magic, but about a deliberate, pointless act of creation in the face of certain destruction. <299>
He walked to the cliff’s edge, the wind whipping his tunic. <309>
The first metallic ring of an axe sharpening echoed from the orchard below. <321>
He opened his hands and cast the crushed herbs into the air. <332>
The fine powder and tiny seeds scattered, a fleeting brown cloud against the pale morning light, drifting down towards the condemned trees. <353>
He watched them go, a silent broadcast of a faith he didn't truly possess. <366>
It was a message sent to no one and everyone, a prayer for a future he couldn't imagine. <382>
Perhaps nothing would grow, or perhaps something resilient and wild would choke the quarry’s foundation stones years from now. <401>
He didn't know. <404>
For the first time, he felt the vast, empty promise of this world’s horizons of mercy, and he took a single, steadying breath. <426>
He had done something. <430>
And in the charred serenity of the morning, that was enough. <440>
