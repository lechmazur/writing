The final, discordant cello note shivered through the champagne vault, a jarring modern sound against the ancient stone and sleeping bottles. <21> Jean-Luc, an urban forager who preferred the company of ruins to the living, barely registered the music’s end. <37> His focus was entirely on the woman opposite him and the object of their quiet war. <53> In his palm, he cradled a fragment of a stained-glass window, a sliver of impossible blue he had rescued only to lose to a probate lawyer. <79> Celine, the building’s new owner, saw only a colorful curiosity, a bauble to be sold to the highest bidder. <98> “One thousand euros,” she stated, her voice as crisp and cold as the vintage in her glass, marking the climax of their tense negotiation. <122>

Jean-Luc feigned a casual shrug, a carefully practiced display of disinterested passion. <134> “It’s just old glass,” he murmured, his gaze drifting as if losing focus. <147> He was, by nature, charmingly forgetful, always misplacing keys and names, yet he never forgot the soul of a thing. <168> “You know, this reminds me of something,” he began, letting the thought trail off. <181> Celine’s impatience was a physical presence in the small, damp space. <192> “We met once before, I think,” he continued, looking at her properly for the first time. <208> “A science fair, years ago, at the Lycée Saint-Louis.” <218>

A flicker of surprise crossed her features. <224> “You were presenting a project… I forget the specifics, something about lepidoptera?” he asked, deliberately fumbling the details. <242> “You had found a way to preserve the dust on a butterfly’s wing without dulling the color.” <259> He could see the memory returning to her, the clash of her corporate present with her idealistic past playing out in her eyes. <281> “You spent twenty minutes explaining to a scruffy man who’d wandered in by mistake how you wanted to shield a fragile wonder from the ravages of time.” <309>

He gently pushed the shard of glass across the table, its deep blue glowing in the candlelight. <326> “I don’t have a thousand euros,” he said softly. <335> “But I can promise you it will be safe.” <344> The applause from the performance upstairs finally filtered down into their subterranean world. <356> Celine looked from the glass to Jean-Luc, the hard lines of her face softening. <371> She remembered the girl she used to be, the one who saw beauty in preservation, not just profit. <388> In a chance encounter beneath Paris, surrounded by the carefully aged and protected, she was reminded of what truly endured. <409> “My father’s company sponsored that fair,” she said, her voice losing its edge. <421> “Keep it.” <423> “Tell me the story of where you found it.” <432> Jean-Luc smiled, a genuine, passionate expression finally breaking through his disinterested mask as he began to speak. <448>
