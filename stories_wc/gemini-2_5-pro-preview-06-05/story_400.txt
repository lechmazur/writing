Elara, last of her kind and a druid by grim necessity, adjusted the dull safety pin holding her moss-woven cloak together. <words>19</words>
Below her, the crevasse of ancient blue ice sighed, a soundless exhalation in a world that had forgotten noise. <words>37</words>
Her home, a glacial orchard of crystalline trees, hung suspended over this beautiful, indifferent abyss, a cosmic joke she appreciated with dour amusement. <words>61</words>
Centuries after the last human footstep had faded, the silence had become a physical presence, a weight she was determined to finally break. <words>86</words>
It was a crippling fear, this quiet, the terror that if she made a sound, the only thing to answer would be the echo of her own solitude. <words>116</words>
Yet today was her birthday, or the day sheâ€™d assigned to it, and she felt fiercely ambivalent about the tradition it demanded. <words>141</words>
She had to gather the frost-rimmed starfruit and the shards of sweet, edible ice from the furthest, most precarious branches. <words>165</words>
Each step along the groaning ice-bridge that served as a path was a negotiation with the vertigo that threatened to swallow her resolve. <words>192</words>
Her gnarled fingers, gentle from decades of tending the impossible grove, plucked the glowing fruit, their faint light a small rebellion against the gloom. <words>222</words>
Back in her ice-hewn shelter, she began preparing the special family meal, a ritual remembered from a life she barely believed was her own. <words>251</words>
She crushed the starfruit into a shimmering paste and arranged the ice shards on a plate of frozen granite, a feast for ghosts. <words>277</words>
The meal was a method, a carefully constructed stage for the one act she dreaded more than the fall. <words>298</words>
She sat before the lonely place setting, the silence pressing in, demanding to be kept. <words>315</words>
Her throat was a knot of ancient dust and disuse. <words>325</words>
Taking a breath that felt like swallowing glass, she parted her lips and spoke the first words the Earth had heard in an age: "Happy birthday, then." <words>354</words>
The sound was a monstrosity, a croaking, alien thing that shattered the perfect stillness and tumbled into the crevasse below. <words>377</words>
A laugh, dry and cracked as old earth, escaped her. <words>387</words>
The silence rushed back in, but it was different now, a canvas she had proven she could mark. <words>406</words>
She had faced the void and filled it with a ridiculous croak, and in the profound absurdity of it all, she found not peace, but a grim, satisfying flicker of power. <words>441</words>
