Elara considered the dusty backstage her soundless sanctuary, a quiet tomb where the theater's ghosts and her duties resided. <words>18</words>
For ten years she had been the dutiful ward to Alistair, the magnificent ruin of a man who now slept most of his days away in the wings. <words>41</words>
Her existence was a cycle of medication and quiet resentment, a state of being she'd describe as eagerly jaded. <words>59</words>
The auditions happening on the main stage were just a muffled, irritating pulse beyond her silent world. <words>76</words>
Then she found the first phone, a sleek smartphone tucked inside Alistairâ€™s worn leather glove on his bedside table. <words>95</words>
A new voice note was the only notification. <words>102</words>
"The best tricks," a distorted version of Alistair's voice rasped, "reframe the familiar until it tells a new truth." <words>120</words>
Annoyance warred with a flicker of the old curiosity he used to inspire in her. <words>134</words>
The next day, another phone appeared, this one lifted from a tearful soprano during her callback. <words>149</words>
Its note spoke of "the prop that holds the key, where my first failure earned your pity." <words>166</words>
She had to solve this strange, final performance. <words>174</words>
Throughout the week of auditions, more stolen phones materialized, each a breadcrumb in his bizarre game. <words>190</words>
One message, layered over the sound of a dancer's tapping feet, directed her to a loose floorboard beneath the ghost light. <words>211</words>
Another, captured from a cocky young actor, whispered of the tarnished silver locket she wore, a gift from him long ago. <words>233</words>
Each clue forced her to revisit a shared memory, twisting it from a monument of her servitude into something else entirely. <words>254</words>
The sanctuary was no longer a prison but a stage for his last illusion. <words>267</words>
Her duty was not a chain but a front-row ticket. <words>277</words>
The final note, on a phone snatched from the exasperated stage manager, contained only a single, wheezing chuckle. <words>296</words>
She knew where to look. <words>301</words>
Returning to his room, she picked up the old leather glove again, its cowhide softened by a thousand sleights of hand. <words>322</words>
This time she felt the slight weight inside one of the fingers. <words>334</words>
She worked out a small, tightly rolled piece of paper. <words>344</words>
It wasn't a confession or a map to some hidden treasure. <words>355</words>
It was a joke, a terribly silly pun about a skeleton who couldn't go to the party because he had no body to go with. <words>381</words>
Below it, in his spidery scrawl, were the words: "My motivation was always simple." <words>395</words>
"To offer a final, fearless laugh at mortality." <words>404</words>
From the bed, a soft, rattling breath hitched in what sounded like the beginning of a laugh. <words>421</words>
Elara looked at the stupid joke, at the dying man in the bed, at the graceless beauty of it all, and for the first time in a decade, she laughed with him. <words>452</words>
