Kael adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp, its beam cutting a lonely path through the cavernous dark of the City-Under-All. <words>19</words>
He was, as he had been for millennia, a student of immortality, though his dissertation had long outlived the concept of a university. <words>39</words>
The last star had guttered out eons ago, leaving only the geothermal glow of the deep earth and the quiet hum of the mole people’s final metropolis. <words>65</words>
His purpose, his motivation, was simple: to become a master of one's own reality by becoming its sole, complete archivist. <words>85</words>
A cart rattled to a halt beside his workstation, its silent driver depositing a worn, leather-bound book before retrieving the one Kael had just completed. <words>111</words>
This was the method, an ancient system of swapped travel journals that circulated the collective memory of their civilization. <words>130</words>
Each book was a gifted burden, a generation’s worth of experience, sorrow, and discovery entrusted to the next. <words>147</words>
Kael’s role in this cycle was mundanely glorious; he was the final stop, the end-point of history. <words>165</words>
With a detached devotion that was the only armor against eternity, he opened the new volume. <words>181</words>
The brittle pages smelled of dust and recycled air, their handwritten script a testament to a people who refused to forget. <words>202</words>
He began the painstaking process to digitize the contents, his fingers flying across the luminescent keys of his terminal. <words>221</words>
He translated fading ink into immortal code, converting a life lived in darkness into a stream of pure data. <words>241</words>
This journal was different, its entries chronicling not just the subterranean routes between habitation domes, but the final, desperate journey from the surface. <words>266</words>
It spoke of a sky gone black, of a sun turned to a cinder, and of the mine collapse that sealed the founders of this city away from a dying world. <words>298</words>
The author had been a foreman, and on the last page was a sketch of the very headlamp Kael now wore, a relic passed down through the line of archivists. <words>333</words>
For a fleeting moment, the weight of that specific, inherited burden felt real, a spark of connection across the unbridgeable gulf of time. <words>358</words>
He felt the terror of the collapse, the grim hope of the first tunnels, the crushing responsibility of survival. <words>378</words>
But the feeling passed, subsumed by the vast, calm ocean of his unending consciousness. <words>394</words>
He finished the entry, the last word of a forgotten world saved from oblivion. <words>409</words>
His work was a prayer whispered into the void, a quiet insistence that what had been, would, in some form, always be. <words>433</words>
Kael logged the journal as complete, its physical form now just a shell, its soul safely stored within his archive. <words>453</words>
He leaned back, the beam of his headlamp unwavering in the endless, silent night, ready for the next memory to arrive. <words>476</words>
