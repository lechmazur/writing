Elias, the ship’s caretaker, knelt in the cavernous cargo hold, a single piece of chalk pinched between his calloused fingers. <words>20</words>
He was a man both warmly aloof, a quiet star you could watch for ages but never truly reach. <words>37</words>
Around him, the spoils of a dozen pirate raids lay in dusty, indifferent piles, each a monument to a choice he could no longer unmake. <words>61</words>
That was the problem with time; it wasn't a line but a tangled, screaming knot of every might-have-been. <words>80</words>
His motivation was simple, a desperate need to hush the endless “what if” siren song that echoed louder than the ship’s straining engines. <words>106</words>
On the pitted deck plating, he began to draw, the chalk scratching out a complex cartography of swirling lines and impossible angles. <words>131</words>
He wasn't sketching constellations, but tracking cloud paths, the slow, cosmic dance of the Crimson Nebula visible through the main viewscreen. <words>156</words>
The pirates thought him mad, the old man who charted dust, but they left him to his gentle harshness, his quiet, obsessive work. <words>181</words>
He believed the nebula wasn't just gas, but a place where the threads of spacetime frayed, where one could slip between the moments. <words>206</words>
Propped against a crate of stolen chronometers was the catalyst: an ancient terrestrial telephone, its plastic casing yellowed with age. <words>231</words>
He’d jury-rigged it to the ship’s comms, programming it to find a single, ghost frequency from a life he’d abandoned decades ago. <words>257</words>
For weeks, it had emitted a steady, reassuring dial tone, a connection to a past that was still, technically, possible. <words>280</words>
It was the anchor for his greatest what-if, the life where he’d stayed, married, and grown old under a blue sky. <words>305</words>
Today, however, the tone began to stutter, the sound of a timeline collapsing under the weight of its own improbability. <words>328</words>
Elias worked faster, his chalk a white blur as he connected the final path on his floor-sized map to the nebula’s swirling heart. <words>355</words>
The timeframe he’d been waiting for had arrived, the precise moment when an outdated phone’s dial tone cuts out for good. <words>380</words>
A profound silence fell over the cargo hold as the last electronic hum died, severing the final link to that other life. <words>405</words>
The chalk lines on the floor pulsed with a soft, crimson light, mirroring the cosmic clouds outside. <words>423</words>
He stood, brushed the white dust from his knees, and stepped into the center of his creation. <words>441</words>
With a final, wry smile that held no regret, only release, Elias began to vanish. <words>456</words>
The air shimmered where he had stood, leaving only the lingering scent of ozone and the silent, intricate map on the floor. <words>480</words>
