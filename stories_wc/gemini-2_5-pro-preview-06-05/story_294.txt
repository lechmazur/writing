<story>
The bard named Kaelen sat alone in the great mushroom meeting hall, his throat a desert of unspoken verse. <words>18</words>
During the hush of a dreamless night, the cavernous space, ribbed with gills of faint, blue light, only amplified his silence. <words>38</words>
The cloak of doubt was a physical weight upon his shoulders, woven from every forgotten lyric and fumbled chord. <words>57</words>
He had come here not to sing, but to escape the prison of the self, a cage built from his own failures. <words>78</words>
With a motion that was gorgeously awkward, he retrieved a small, heavy object from his satchel. <words>93</words>
It was a stained glass prism, its facets holding the ghosts of a thousand different colors even in the gloom. <words>113</words>
His purpose tonight was not to create, but to preserve. <words>123</words>
He held the prism up to a sliver of moonlight that pierced the fungal canopy, his hand trembling slightly. <words>141</words>
He was searching for the echoes, the resonant artifacts left behind in the crystalline lattice of the hall. <words>159</words>
His method was strange, a half-remembered magic he used to capture these phantoms through what he called forgotten voicemails. <words>180</words>
He twisted the prism, and a low hum vibrated through the stem-like pillars around him, the air growing crisp with ozone and memory. <words>204</words>
At first, there was only static, the sound of dust settling on ancient spores. <words>218</words>
He adjusted the angle again, his brow furrowed in concentration, a languid desperation in his posture. <words>235</words>
Then, a voice crackled through the prism, faint and tinny, yet achingly familiar. <words>249</words>
"Don't forget the light, Kaelen," it whispered, a message from a woman he had loved, left for him years ago in a similar device. <words>274</words>
Her voice was a warm current in the cold, still air of his solitude. <words>287</words>
He had to save it, to keep this one fragment of warmth from dissolving into the endless quiet. <words>305</words>
He focused all his will, pouring his silent longing into the stained glass, feeling the vibration shift and settle. <words>325</words>
The whisper looped once more, clearer this time, before being absorbed into the prism with a soft, final chime. <words>344</words>
He lowered his arm, the prism now pulsing with a gentle, internal light. <words>357</words>
The voicemail was safe, a tiny spark locked away from the encroaching darkness of his mind. <words>374</words>
He clutched the object to his chest, the smooth, cool glass a comfort against his tunic. <words>390</words>
The silence of the hall returned, but it was no longer a void. <words>403</words>
It was a canvas, and he had just preserved its first, precious brushstroke of sound. <words>418</words>
The heavy cloak on his shoulders felt infinitesimally lighter, a single thread of its oppressive weave having been unraveled. <words>438</words>
He still couldn't sing, but tonight, he had learned how to listen again. <words>452</words>
