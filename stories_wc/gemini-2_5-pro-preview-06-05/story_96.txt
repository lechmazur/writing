The obsidian-furred Blink Cat, a creature so perfectly itself it was statically unique, watched my hands from its perch. <words>18</words>
My own movements were a practiced, rhythmic loop: yarn over, pull through, another stitch in a blanket for a griffin with a perpetual chill. <words>39</words>
This was the latest of my volunteer stints in odd places, a method I had adopted for gathering verses like burrs on a sleeve. <words>62</words>
I worked in the witch's familiar menagerie, a place humming with contained magic and the scent of supernatural dander. <words>82</words>
My life had become a brimming cup, each strange job adding another drop of quiet chaos, and the surface tension was about to break. <words>109</words>
My motivation was simple, a private joke with the universe: to surprise fate with an unplanned encore. <words>128</words>
Fate felt like a script written by a committee, and I, an underground poet, preferred the raw immediacy of a single, defiant ad-lib. <words>153</words>
Tucked into my pocket was the reason for my current stillness, an antique map of the astral currents, its paper soft as moth wings. <words>179</words>
A single, jagged tear marred its surface, obscuring the path to a theorized 'silent realm,' a pocket dimension of pure potential. <words>203</words>
For weeks, during blanket crocheting, I had studied the map with a disinterested passion, treating the puzzle with the same cool focus I gave a difficult rhyme scheme. <words>235</words>
The Blink Cat, which could teleport but only to places it had never been, was the key. <words>252</words>
It was a living paradox, its unique gift also a curse of constant, irreversible novelty. <words>268</words>
The tear on the map was not a flaw; it was a destination, a non-place, a void the cat could perceive. <words>289</words>
My crocheting hook stilled mid-loop. <words>294</words>
The cup of my patience, my planning, my poetryâ€”it all spilled over into a single, silent imperative. <words>313</words>
I would not wait for destiny's cue or for the map to magically mend itself. <words>329</words>
I would seize this moment, this confluence of flawed chart and paradoxical beast. <words>343</words>
I folded the half-finished blanket, setting it aside with the finality of a closed book. <words>359</words>
Holding the map out, I aligned the tear with the shimmering space just before the cat's nose. <words>377</words>
The creature looked from the rip in the paper to my eyes, a flicker of shared, wild understanding passing between us. <words>399</words>
It blinked, and the world dissolved into the quiet hum of a place that had never been on any map at all. <words>422</words>
