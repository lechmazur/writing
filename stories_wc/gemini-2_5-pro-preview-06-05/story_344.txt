Kaelen adjusted the pair of wire-rimmed glasses on his nose, the familiar weight a small anchor in the quiet drift of the floating rock tea house. <words>25</words>
It was a strange perch for a former underwater explorer, but the open sky was the only cure he’d found for the claustrophobia that had stolen the deep from him. <words>55</words>
He remained a student of behaviors, though now his subjects were the scattered survivors who sought solace here, in the hush of improbable beginnings. <words>82</words>
A lightly heavyhearted feeling settled in his chest as he watched a new arrival, a woman whose grief was a shroud around her shoulders. <words>111</words>
His research had taught him observation, but his conscience now demanded more. <words>123</words>
He moved to a shelf lined with dusty, jewel-toned jars, each containing a jam made from a recipe centuries old. <words>146</words>
It was his most unorthodox method, a way to truly understand the echoes of human experience. <words>163</words>
He knew that to taste the subtle differences in old jam recipes was to invite the passions and sorrows of their makers into his own mind. <words>192</words>
Selecting a jar of dark plum and star-anise, he uncapped it, the scent ancient and sharp. <words>210</words>
He took a small spoonful, the flavor exploding on his tongue, and felt the past begin to inflame his senses. <words>233</words>
It was not a fire of heat, but of memory: a baker’s loneliness, a lover’s betrayal, a quiet resilience kneaded into the fruit and sugar. <words>261</words>
The jam’s story mirrored the sorrow he saw in the woman, a shared thread of loss across ages. <words>281</words>
This empathetic surge was his burden and his gift, a strange and powerful healing touch that worked through understanding, not magic. <words>308</words>
He walked to her table, the hum of the levitating stone beneath his feet a steady pulse. <words>327</words>
He didn't speak of what he'd felt, of the baker or the bitter sweetness on his tongue. <words>346</words>
Instead, he simply placed a hand on the worn wood of her table, a quiet gesture of solidarity. <words>366</words>
"The sky is clear today," he said, his voice calm and even. <words>378</words>
"You can see all the way to the Sunken City from the western balcony." <words>394</words>
The woman looked up, her eyes focusing on him for the first time, a flicker of light in their depths. <words>414</words>
It wasn't a cure, but it was a connection, a shared moment in the vast, open air that pushed back the enclosing walls of her grief, and his. <words>446</words>
His study of human behavior had become an act of quiet, bold compassion. <words>461</words>
