Elara traced the fractures on a Jupiter-swirled marble, her workshop silent save for the hum of the lunar colony's life support. <words>21</words>
Outside the reinforced plasteel window, Earth hung like another flawed marble in the void. <words>35</words>
Each cracked sphere in her collection represented a future she had foreseen, a life path set in cosmic stone. <words>53</words>
It was a terribly ordered system, this grand cosmic scoreboard, and she, its ambivalent prophet, had grown tired of reading the final scores before the games even began. <words>82</words>
A small, secret smile played on her lips, a look of bashful arrogance for what she was about to do. <words>102</words>
She had seen the tally of all things, the precise accounting of joy and sorrow, and found it wanting. <words>121</words>
Her motivation was simple, almost childish: to scramble the cosmic scoreboard so thoroughly that not even she could predict the outcome. <words>144</words>
This was her final oath, a promise whispered not to gods or ghosts, but to the dust on her own boots. <words>165</words>
From beneath her workbench, she retrieved a dusty, forgotten rummage sale box. <words>178</words>
Inside lay the instruments of her grand rebellion: a chaotic jumble of jigsaw puzzle edges. <words>195</words>
They were the borders of a thousand forgotten pictures, the frames of worlds that never were. <words>211</words>
Most would see trash, but Elara saw the very syntax of reality, beautifully, wonderfully incomplete. <words>228</words>
She tipped them onto the cool metal floor, a cascade of mismatched colors and shapes. <words>243</words>
Then, in the infinitesimal pause between one beat of her anxious heart and the next, she began. <words>261</words>
It was not an act of creation or destruction, but something far more delicate; she began to defragment fate itself. <words>282</words>
Her fingers didn't move, but the pieces did, snapping together in impossible ways, guided by her will. <words>300</words>
A piece from a pastoral farm scene locked into the edge of a roaring supernova. <words>316</words>
The corner of a child's birthday party fused with the border of a declaration of war. <words>333</words>
She was weaving a new frame for existence, a border of glorious, unpredictable nonsense. <words>348</words>
The moment stretched and compressed, an eternity held within a single cardiac cycle. <words>362</words>
When her heart beat again, the puzzle pieces lay still, forming a perfect, nonsensical rectangle on the floor. <words>382</words>
On her workbench, the cracks in the marbles shimmered and vanished, their futures now beautifully, terrifyingly unwritten. <words>401</words>
A single tear traced a path through the moondust on her cheek, a perfect distillation of her happily sad soul. <words>422</words>
She had broken her chains by reforging the universe's, and for the first time, she had no idea what would happen next. <words>445</words>
It was, she thought with a shy, triumphant grin, a considerable improvement. <words>458</words>
