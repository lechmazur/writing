The cheerless duelist, Rhys, sat alone in the abandoned spaceport customs office, a ghost among ghosts of transit. <words>18</words>
His only company was the low, constant hum of server rooms he kept running, a digital heartbeat in a concrete corpse. <words>37</words>
Before him rested a maggoty wooden chest, its decaying timbers barely containing the dry rattle of what lay inside. <words>56</words>
He knew the sound intimately: the shattered pieces of his brother’s dueling saber, a testament to his own fatal flaws. <words>76</words>
Pride, rigid and unyielding, had been the flaw that shattered his family as surely as his final, perfect strike had shattered the blade. <words>99</words>
Now, his sole motivation was to learn the power of forgiveness, a concept as alien to him as the silent, star-dusted tarmacs outside. <words>124</words>
For weeks, he had worked with a precisely innovative focus, turning his sharp mind from combat strategy to a far stranger craft. <words>146</words>
He sought to elasticize the broken shards, to make them pliable, to mend what his rigidity had destroyed. <words>165</words>
His method was esoteric, derived from unexpected mutations of family recipes not for stews or cakes, but for synaptic enhancers and cellular augments. <words>192</words>
His ancestors had used these formulas to harden a duelist’s resolve, but Rhys was reversing the process, seeking to soften, to yield. <words>216</words>
He carefully measured a shimmering, viscous fluid into a beaker, the final ingredient in a concoction that smelled of ozone and regret. <words>239</words>
With a trembling hand, he opened the chest, the maggots squirming away from the sudden light that illuminated the jagged, metallic fragments within. <words>264</words>
He poured the liquid over the pieces, and for a moment, nothing happened beyond a soft hiss against the cold metal. <words>285</words>
Then, a soft blue light began to pulse from the core of each shard, the hum of the servers seeming to sync with its rhythm. <words>311</words>
The sharp edges began to soften, the brittle structures flowing like mercury as the pieces started to stretch and bend toward one another. <words>336</words>
They did not reform the saber; instead, they coalesced into a single, fluid sphere that hovered above the decaying wood, shimmering with gentle light. <words>362</words>
It was not a weapon of perfect form, but a new creation born from brokenness, flexible and whole in a way the original could never be. <words>389</words>
A single tear traced a path through the grime on Rhys’s cheek, a bittersweet reckoning in the humming silence. <words>409</words>
He could not undo the past, but he had learned that from the most shattered parts of himself, something new and resilient could be formed. <words>435</words>
He reached out, not to the hovering sphere, but to the switch that powered the servers, and with a final, forgiving breath, plunged the room into silence. <words>463</words>
