Sir Kaelan drifted, a ghost of iron and sorrow in the zero-gravity dance hall. <13>
His armor, once a symbol of fealty, was now just a coffin for his spirit, its polished surfaces reflecting the chaotic swirl of silken bodies and shimmering light. <36>
This place was normally abnormal, a spinning cathedral of hedonism where gravity was a forgotten god and joy was the only liturgy. <57>
He, however, was an anchor of despair in this buoyant, sacred disorder. <68>
Clutched in his gauntlet was the sole reason for his presence: a single, salt-crusted trident prong from a sunken realm. <88>
It was a key, a promise, and a burden he had carried across worlds. <101>
He watched the great chronometer on the distant, silent watchtower, its hands crawling toward a time that should not exist. <122>
Then it happened. <125>
The old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour, a thirteenth chime that echoed not in sound but in the sudden, sharp stillness of Kaelan’s soul. <151>
The moment was now. <155>
His motivation, a silent vow echoing through ages, surged from the depths of his lineage, demanding to be voiced. <175>
Dejection evaporated like breath in a vacuum, replaced by a cold, hard resolve that had slept for centuries. <192>
His heart began to quicken, a war drum beating a rhythm of forgotten purpose against his ribs. <208>
He pushed off a gilded railing, launching himself through the frozen tableau of dancers. <222>
He had to move through forgotten paths, not the empty spaces between the floating revelers, but the invisible ley lines that pulsed beneath the hall’s chaotic skin. <251>
Others saw him as just another tumbling speck, but he was tracing a constellation only he could perceive. <269>
His trajectory was an ancient secret, a map burned into his bloodline. <281>
He navigated by the glint of a specific sequin, the arc of a falling wine glass, the ghost of a forgotten melody. <303>
The trident prong in his hand grew warm, humming with a resonant energy that guided him toward the hall’s core. <323>
There, a nexus of pure kinetic energy spun, a miniature galaxy of light and motion. <337>
This was the altar. <341>
With a final, powerful thrust, he arrived at the center of the maelstrom. <355>
He raised the prong, not to strike, but to offer. <364>
The vow was not spoken but unleashed, a wave of silent, potent intent that poured from him, through the prong, and into the spinning heart of the hall. <391>
The sacred disorder paused, the music stuttered, and the light warped. <402>
Before him, the fabric of space shimmered, deepening horizons as a shimmering waterway, smelling of ancient salt and starlight, opened a path where none had been. <429>
The sunken realm beckoned. <433>
Sir Kaelan, no longer dejected but reborn in purpose, pushed forward into the impossible vista, his vow finally finding its voice in the journey ahead. <458>
