Sir Kaelan followed the skeletal remains of the ruined aqueduct, a memory of water in a land of bone-dry sand. <words>19</words>
His quest, to spark flames in a land of ice, felt like a madman's dream here, between the jagged teeth of the mountain passes. <words>41</words>
He carried the weight of his frozen home in his heart, a feeling of crisp nostalgia for the warmth of legends he'd never known himself. <words>66</words>
The sun was a merciless hammer, forcing him to seek shelter in the skeletal husk of a rundown greenhouse slumped against the aqueduct's base. <words>91</words>
Inside, the air was thick with the ghosts of forgotten blossoms. <words>102</words>
Sunlight pierced the grimy, shattered panes of the roof, scattering brilliant pinpricks of light across the dusty floor. <words>122</words>
He watched the motes dance in the beams, a silent, shimmering ballet. <words>134</words>
An odd compulsion, born of his earnest faith in signs and portents, seized him. <words>148</words>
He unrolled his most precious object, an astronomical map passed down through generations, its vellum soft as worn silk. <words>169</words>
The familiar constellations of his northern home offered no guidance here. <words>180</words>
So, with a piece of charcoal, he began mapping the tears in the roof, marking each point of light as a new star on a spare sheet of parchment. <words>211</words>
He worked meticulously, his knightly discipline applied to this strange new cartography. <words>224</words>
As the pattern took shape, a strange resonance echoed within him; the shape was unknowingly familiar, like a melody heard in a dream. <words>249</words>
It was a constellation, but one that did not exist in any sky he had ever seen. <words>266</words>
His breath hitched. <words>269</words>
He laid his new drawing over the ancient astronomical map. <words>279</words>
The points of light from the greenhouse roof aligned perfectly with a series of faint, almost invisible markings on the old chart he had never understood. <words>308</words>
This was the method, the key he was meant to find. <words>320</words>
To see the universe not as a fixed chart, but as a living canvas of life, where even decay could create a new truth. <words>345</words>
The alignment was the trigger. <words>350</words>
As the last point was matched, the ancient ink on the astronomical map flared with a soft, blue light, the faint markings now burning as a vibrant, new path. <words>381</words>
It did not point to a place on the ground, but to a convergence in the heavens, a moment in time when he would need to be standing on the highest peak of the next mountain pass. <words>421</words>
There, the map promised, he would find the celestial ember needed to spark the first flame. <words>438</words>
Kaelan stared at the glowing path, the desert's oppressive heat forgotten, replaced by the burgeoning warmth of hope. <words>456</words>
His journey was not just across the land, but woven into the very fabric of the sky. <words>474</words>
He had read the canvas, and now he knew how to bring the fire home. <words>490</words>
