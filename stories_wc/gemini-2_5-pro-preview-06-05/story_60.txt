The last echo of the noon bell died in the dust below the grand cathedral. <words>14</words> Kaelen the blacksmith felt the silence settle, a familiar weight in the maze-like catacombs. <words>28</words> He carried no torch, for his eyes had long grown accustomed to the gloom. <words>41</words> His face was a mask of indifference, a craftsman come to do a job, nothing more. <words>57</words> His motivation was not glory or fear, but the simple, binding need to seal a covenant with the unknown. <words>76</words>

He moved through the oppressive dark, his heavy boots sure on the uneven stone. <words>90</words> At a fork marked by a collapsed archway, he chose his path without pause. <words>104</words> An old instinct, or perhaps a whispered instruction from the deep quiet, made him haw to the left. <words>122</words> The air grew colder as he descended into a vast, ruined chamber, a place where the very foundations seemed to have been torn apart. <words>145</words> Here, amidst the rubble of a forgotten age, he would begin. <words>157</words>

He knelt and unrolled a thick leather bundle, revealing not tools of iron, but a collection of objects that tell a story. <words>180</words> There was a petrified bird's egg, a shard of obsidian that hummed with a low thrum, and a single, perfect river stone. <words>202</words> Each piece was a verse in the lament of what was broken, a plea for what could rise from this rubble. <words>223</words> He arranged them in a precise circle around a flat-topped stone that served as his altar. <words>239</words> At the center, he placed the most important component: a branch of petrified lightning, a uniquely natural formation that pulsed with a faint, internal light. <words>267</words> It was the anchor for the entity he summoned. <words>277</words>

From a small pouch at his belt, he withdrew the final piece. <words>289</words> It was a faded ribbon of pale blue silk, so delicate it seemed a breath could tear it. <words>307</words> He held it for a moment, its story of a lost promise pressing against his calloused thumb. <words>324</words> With practiced motions, he set up a small, portable forge, its coals glowing with a smokeless, chemical heat. <words>343</words> He took a sliver of meteorite iron and began to hammer it into a simple, unbroken ring. <words>360</words> The rhythmic tapping was the only sound, a stark counterpoint to the mystic simplicity of the ritual. <words>378</words> He worked the metal until it glowed white-hot, then quenched it not in water, but by pressing it against the lightning-struck branch. <words>401</words> A soft chime, like crystal striking crystal, echoed through the chamber as energy flowed into the metal. <words>418</words> He then carefully tied the faded ribbon around the still-warm ring, binding the memory to the new vessel. <words>436</words> The covenant was sealed. <words>441</words> A soft breeze stirred the dust on the floor, and a single, mossy stone on a shattered pillar shifted, settling into a firmer position. <words>465</words> Kaelen watched, his expression unchanged, before packing his collection away. <words>476</words> As the first chime of the next bell rang out from the world above, he turned and walked away from the nascent stirring in the ruins. <words>500</words>
