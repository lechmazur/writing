In the hush of a half-lit corridor, surrounded by the scent of ozone and old wool from dormant enchanted carpets, Elara felt a frantic peace settle in her bones. <words>28</words> She was an outcast scholar, a pariah among her peers for clinging to a single, radical belief. <words>44</words> Her entire life had been dedicated to a simple, desperate mission: to prove that midnight only lasts so long. <words>62</words> The final steps of her quest were not found in a grand library, but revealed via diaries hidden behind a cracked tile in a public restroom. <words>88</words> Those brittle pages, filled with the elegant script of a long-dead sorcerer, had led her here, to this specific witch's flying carpet garage. <words>114</words> The proprietor, a formidable crone named Morwen, had unlocked the door for her without a single question. <words>131</words> Elara knew it was because of the peculiar aura she carried, a disarming sincerity that made her strangely trustworthy even to the most cynical of magic-users. <words>161</words>

Now, she stood before a dusty workbench where dozens of magical components lay scattered like forgotten toys. <words>179</words> Her eyes ignored the dragon scales and bottled starlight, landing instead on a small, spiraled seashell with a strange symbol etched into its pearlescent surface. <words>207</words> It was exactly as the diaries had described, an artifact capable of the most profound and dangerous magic. <words>226</words> With a trembling hand, she picked it up, its surface cool and smooth against her skin. <words>242</words> The core concept from the diaries echoed in her mind: mirroring the soul. <words>255</words> It did not create light or darkness; it only reflected what was already there. <words>269</words>

Closing her eyes, Elara clutched the shell to her chest, pouring all of her conviction, all of her hope, all of her frantic, peaceful certainty into that single point of contact. <words>299</words> She thought of every soul lost to despair, every spirit who believed the darkness was permanent. <words>315</words> This was for them. <words>319</words> A violent jolt shot through her body, not of pain, but of immense, overwhelming energy, as if a dam within her had finally burst. <words>345</words> Her eyes snapped open to see the symbol on the seashell blazing with an impossible, golden light. <words>362</words> But the light was not coming from the shell; it was pouring from her. <words>375</words> The artifact was a perfect mirror, and her soul, when held up to it, was a sunrise. <words>392</words> The oppressive shadows in the corridor did not flee but simply dissolved, replaced by a soft, warm luminescence that felt like dawn. <words>415</words> The frantic energy vanished, leaving only a profound and absolute peace. <words>426</words> She had her proof. <words>430</words> At the far end of the corridor, Morwen leaned against a tapestry loom, a slow, knowing smile spreading across her face. <words>451</words>
