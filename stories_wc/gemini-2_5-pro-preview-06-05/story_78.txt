Elias adjusted the brass mariner’s spyglass, its lens a single, cold eye against the bruised twilight. <words>16</words>
Below him, the city was a skeleton, but here on the rooftop farm, new life stubbornly pushed through soil trucked up six flights of stairs. <words>39</words>
He had never wanted this mantle, this quiet command, but the world’s end had made a late-blooming hero of him. <words>58</words>
The gravity of loss was a physical weight in the air, a constant pressure he sought not to escape but to understand. <words>80</words>
His singular motivation, born in the silent weeks after the Collapse, was to dissect the architecture of cosmic balance. <words>101</words>
"There's no point," a voice said, thin and brittle. <words>110</words>
It was Anya, her shoulders slumped as she stared at a row of withered kale. <words>124</words>
Elias turned, his expression not of sympathy, but of a shared, weary burden; he was softly militant in his insistence on survival. <words>147</words>
"There is always a point," he stated, his tone leaving no room for argument. <words>161</words>
He had to coerce hope back into his small flock, one broken spirit at a time. <words>177</words>
This spyglass, he thought, was his best tool for it. <words>187</words>
He’d found it by scouring dusty attics in the skeletal towers, a relic of a world that looked to distant shores, not distant stars. <words>213</words>
"I spent weeks searching those dead apartments for something that could see farther than our own grief," he told her. <words>233</words>
He guided her to the tripod, his movements deliberate. <words>242</words>
"Look." <words>243</words>
He didn't point it at the ruins, but upward, toward the pinprick of a nebula just visible to the naked eye. <words>263</words>
Through the polished lens, it bloomed into a celestial flower of gas and nascent suns, a place of violent, beautiful creation. <words>285</words>
"The universe didn't stop for us," Elias said, his voice filled with a reluctant awe. <words>299</words>
"It builds, it breaks, it balances." <words>306</words>
"It's all so… big," Anya whispered, her hand still on the cold brass. <words>319</words>
"And we are so small." <words>324</words>
"No," Elias corrected gently. <words>328</words>
"We are the part that gets to witness it." <words>337</words>
He wasn't offering comfort, but a terrible and magnificent purpose. <words>347</words>
Anya didn't smile, but the rigid line of her shoulders softened. <words>359</words>
She was still caught in that hollow space between the first tear and the final sigh, but now she saw the sheer scale of the room. <words>386</words>
She nodded once, a small, sharp gesture of renewed duty, and went back to tending the crops. <words>403</words>
Elias returned to the eyepiece, his own loss a single, dark note in a vast, uncaring, and breathtaking symphony. <words>423</words>
