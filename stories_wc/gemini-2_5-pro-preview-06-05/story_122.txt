The wind whipped across the high plateau, a sacred sky burial site where the bones of the faithful were picked clean by vultures. <words>21</words>
Cyber-Templar Kaelen ignored the cold, his focus absolute, his state one of euphoric agitation as he knelt beside the offering stone. <words>41</words>
Open on his lap was the Codex Gigas Machina, its illuminated circuits glowing faintly in the bruised twilight of the approaching storm. <words>63</words>
He was here to prove the scripture's most audacious claim. <words>74</words>
With movements that were patiently frantic, he unwrapped a worn leather bridle from an oilskin cloth, its archaic form a stark contrast to his own chrome-and-cable sinews. <words>105</words>
The bridle was not for a beast of flesh, but for the storm itself, a focusing anchor for the divine energy the Codex promised he could command. <words>134</words>
He believed this ritual would forge a sanctuary in the chaos, a shield against the entropy of the cosmos, but it was a desperate faith in a mirage of safety. <words>166</words>
The first fat drops of rain spattered the codex's page, and Kaelen smiled, a tremor of ecstasy running through his augmented frame. <words>188</words>
His motivation was pure, a zealous need to reflect lightning back at the storm and thus affirm the Order's dominion over the physical world. <words>216</words>
He produced a crystalline prism, its facets cut with impossible precision, the key to his grand experiment. <words>234</words>
The text he had just been reading described the exact angles, the precise attunements required. <words>251</words>
He looped the old bridle over a jutting spar of rock, the worn leather a grounding point for the impossible energies he sought to channel. <words>278</words>
A low rumble vibrated through the stone, and the air grew thick with ozone. <words>292</words>
Kaelen raised the prism, his cybernetic eye calculating trajectories with inhuman speed, his human heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. <words>318</words>
He had to prove it was all real: the Order, the power, the promise of control in a universe that offered none. <words>340</words>
Then, a searing bolt of white-hot energy tore the sky apart, striking not the distant peaks but the very ground a dozen meters from him. <words>366</words>
In that blinding flash, Kaelen saw his method succeed in a way he never anticipated. <words>381</words>
He had intended to prove his power through the refraction of light through a prism, but the raw, superheated air from the strike had created a lens of its own. <words>415</words>
For a split second, the light of the lightning strike bent through this atmospheric distortion, and he saw the sky burial site not as a holy altar, but as a barren, windswept rock littered with gnawed skeletons. <words>455</words>
The euphoric agitation drained away, replaced by the silent, terrifying clarity that the only thing he had reflected was the truth. <words>479</words>
