The unsteady sentinel, Kael, stood alone in the cavernous silence of the abandoned space freighter docking bay. <words>18</words>
Outside the viewport, two planets, luminous and doomed, spiraled toward their final, catastrophic embrace. <words>33</words>
This was the timeframe between worlds colliding, a cosmic inevitability that filled him with a cheerless ecstasy. <words>50</words>
He was supposed to be the last guardian of a lost cause, a monument to a misguided prophecy that had sent his people fleeing into the void. <words>78</words>
But Kael’s motivation was not to guard; it was to clear the fog of that very prophecy. <words>96</words>
On a dusty console before him lay his painstaking work: a mosaic created by reassembling shredded letters. <words>114</words>
Each fragment was a piece of the lie they had all been told. <words>127</words>
A strange automaton bird, all brass gears and sapphire eyes, perched on his shoulder, occasionally nudging a scrap of paper with its beak. <words>152</words>
It was his only companion in this tomb of steel, a forgotten relic that held its own secrets. <words>171</words>
For weeks, he had worked by the dying emergency lights, fueled by a quiet, coyly furious energy. <words>189</words>
He was furious at the elders who had read apocalypse in the ancient texts, and coyly so, because his rage was a private, holy thing. <words>217</words>
They had preached of an ending, a final judgment from which all must escape. <words>231</words>
Kael, however, was discovering the ambush of fate hidden within the shredded words. <words>246</words>
The prophecy was not a warning; it was an invitation. <words>255</words>
His fingers, trembling, slid the final piece into place. <words>265</words>
The reassembled letter did not speak of annihilation, but of a 'conjoining'—a 'rebirth at the nexus point'. <words>283</words>
This docking bay was that nexus. <words>289</words>
The automaton bird suddenly whirred to life, its sapphire eyes glowing with an intense blue light. <words>305</words>
It hopped from his shoulder onto the console, pecking a sequence on a dormant keypad. <words>321</words>
A low hum vibrated through the deck as the freighter’s primary communication array powered on for the first time in a generation. <words>343</words>
The bird had been waiting for him to understand. <words>352</words>
It was not a pet, but a key, reassembled just as the letters had been. <words>368</words>
Kael looked from the completed message to the colliding worlds, their surfaces now beginning to crack and bleed light into one another. <words>391</words>
He leaned toward the microphone, his voice steady for the first time. <words>403</words>
His sole, vital action was to recommend a new path to any scattered remnants of his people who might hear. <words>423</words>
"This is not the end," he broadcast into the static-filled emptiness. <words>434</words>
"The prophecy was wrong. <words>438</words>
I recommend you return to the nexus. <words>446</words>
Return home." <words>448</words>
