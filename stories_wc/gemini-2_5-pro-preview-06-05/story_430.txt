Kael, a reaver by blood and trade, sat alone in the kaleidoscope park. <words>12</words>
The world was still new, an age before the first lie is told, and the light here fractured into impossible hues. <words>29</words>
Trees wept shimmering, sap-like tears and the flowers, charmingly grotesque, tracked Kael’s movements with pupils of pollen. <words>46</words>
This place was a mockery of beauty, and Kael felt a kinship with its flawed splendor. <words>61</words>
From a worn leather pouch, Kael pulled a piece of crumpled paper, unfolding it with a practiced gentleness that betrayed a closed-off heart. <words>84</words>
It was a child’s drawing: a crude figure with arms outstretched towards a chaotic scribble of stars. <words>101</words>
A family heirloom, this desperate reach for the heavens, a generational pattern of wanting more than the dirt under your feet. <words>124</words>
Kael’s own father had carried it, and his father before him, each a reaver who plundered the tangible while yearning for the sublime. <words>148</words>
Beside Kael lay a book of maps, its margins defiled. <words>158</words>
Elara’s handwriting, a sharp and elegant script, used the empty space to nag. <words>172</words>
She did it via scrawled poems, tiny daggers of mocking affection aimed at the armor around Kael’s soul. <words>191</words>
"My fearsome thief," one began, "you'd gut a god for its golden ichor but flee from the warmth of a hand." <words>213</words>
Kael traced the words, the ghost of her voice a persistent, loving annoyance. <words>226</words>
She was relentless, her ink demanding why Kael chased echoes when a universe waited right here. <words>243</words>
The poems always circled back to the same impossible, infuriating idea. <words>255</words>
Her motivation was a thing of myth and madness: to taste the stars in a single kiss. <words>274</words>
She believed that kiss was locked inside Kael, a treasure waiting to be plundered from the reaver’s own guarded spirit. <words>296</words>
It was a foolish, beautiful notion, the kind that got people killed or, worse, made them vulnerable. <words>314</words>
Kael scoffed, a harsh sound swallowed by the park’s prismatic air. <words>325</words>
Yet, the nagging worked its slow magic, chipping away at the inherited fortress. <words>338</words>
The poems were a siege, and Elara was a patient, smiling general. <words>350</words>
Kael looked from the scrawled verse to the child’s drawing, seeing the same desperate hunger in both. <words>368</words>
The reaver, the child, the lover—all reaching for the same celestial fire. <words>380</words>
A pattern not of theft, but of yearning. <words>388</words>
Kael folded the drawing, the paper whispering against calloused fingers. <words>398</words>
Maybe plundering was not about taking things, but about finally letting something in. <words>412</words>
A slow smile, the first genuine thing to grace Kael’s face all day, touched the reaver’s lips. <words>429</words>
It was time to go find Elara. <words>436</words>
It was time to see if she was right about the stars. <words>449</words>
