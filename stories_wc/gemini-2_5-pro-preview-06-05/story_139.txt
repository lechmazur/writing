The dream returned in a flash of splintered wood and a silent scream, leaving Brother Tenzin breathless in the heartbeat after it faded. <words>22</words>
He sat perfectly still, the only passenger in an aerial gondola gliding silently between snow-dusted peaks. <words>38</words>
Below, the world was a tapestry of deep green valleys and jagged grey stone, a view of cautious enchantment that did little to soothe him. <words>61</words>
For two decades, he had tried to meditate the memory away, but his stubborn nature refused to grant him peace without truth. <words>83</words>
The reflection in the plexiglass window was his own, but it wore a smirk he hadn't seen in years, the face of the man he had to outsmart. <words>112</words>
This journey was the culmination of his long penance, a final, quiet effort to avenge the life that had been stolen. <words>133</words>
From a worn satchel, he carefully unwrapped an antique flute carved from bone, its surface smooth and cold against his calloused fingers. <words>156</words>
Tucked beside it was a visually unappealing and creased shipping label, a grimy rectangle of paper he had salvaged from the flute’s original packaging so long ago. <words>187</words>
It was his only tangible link to the past, a map he was only now learning to read. <words>205</words>
He was not seeking to inflict pain but to reclaim a narrative, to finally prove who had played the discordant, damning notes that night. <words>232</words>
This was his method, the strange obsession that had consumed his quiet hours: analyzing the tooth marks marring the flute’s mouthpiece. <words>256</words>
He had spent years harvesting the past from these tiny indentations, comparing them to sketches, to memories, to the cast of his own teeth he’d made in secret. <words>289</words>
His dark reflection, his twin, had always been clever, covering his tracks with lies that mirrored the truth so closely they became indistinguishable. <words>318</words>
But he had been careless with this one detail, believing no one would ever look so closely. <words>336</words>
Tenzin angled the flute in the thin mountain light, his breath fogging the air as he focused on a specific groove near the edge. <words>363</words>
There it was—a minuscule chip on the edge of a canine impression, a flaw his own perfect teeth did not possess. <words>386</words>
It was the mark of his brother, a signature of violence left behind in a moment of passion. <words>403</words>
A profound stillness settled over Tenzin as the gondola began its slow descent toward the distant monastery. <words>422</words>
He had the proof. <words>426</words>
The weight of two decades lifted, replaced not by triumph, but by the serene, sharp clarity of an answer finally earned. <words>448</words>
He had harvested the past, and in doing so, had finally stepped out of his own shadow. <words>466</words>
