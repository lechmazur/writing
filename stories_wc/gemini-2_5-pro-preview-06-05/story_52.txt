Kael drifted through the time-worn marketplace, a hopeful pickpocket in a city trapped inside a giant hourglass. <words>18</words>
A constant, shimmering cascade of sand fell from the glass sky, a slow-motion apocalypse that measured the day in fading light and accumulating dust. <words>41</words>
His blithe discontent was a well-practiced mask, hiding the gnawing need to share a secret that seared his soul. <words>61</words>
He was waiting for the moment when the chalk lines on the market's stone floor finally faded away, the last remnants of a map he and his sister had drawn as children. <words>95</words>
In his pocket, his fingers traced the jagged edges of a broken pencil sharpener, the only thing he had left of her. <words>118</words>
It was a useless, pathetic token, but it was the anchor for the depths of his devotion, a devotion that had cost him everything. <words>144</words>
He lifted a wallet with the grace of a dancer, his spirits not lifting with it. <words>160</words>
The weight in his conscience was far heavier than the coins in his hand. <words>175</words>
Then, through the shimmering haze of falling sand, a garish, neon-fringed karaoke stage began to materialize between a spice stall and a seller of bottled whispers. <words>206</words>
It hummed with an impossible energy, its screen flickering to life with the title of a song he hadn't heard in years. <words>231</words>
It was her song. <words>235</words>
A desperate, irrational hope surged through him, and he stumbled towards the stage, grabbing one of the two waiting microphones. <words>258</words>
He didn't know the words anymore, not really, but his soul did. <words>271</words>
He began to sing, his voice a raw nerve of grief and love, a sound so nakedly honest it was tastefully offensive in this place of quiet desperation. <words>301</words>
He closed his eyes, expecting only the hiss of the sand, but then a second voice joined his, clear and steady. <words>324</words>
He opened them to see a woman with kind eyes and a sad smile, a stranger who had taken the other microphone to join him in a spontaneous karaoke duet. <words>357</words>
They sang the ridiculous, beautiful song together, their voices weaving a story of loss and loyalty that no one in the market understood but them. <words>386</words>
He poured his secret into the melody—the sharpener, the fall, the silence—and her harmony seemed to catch every unspoken word, offering not judgment, but accompaniment. <words>421</words>
When the final note faded, the last of the chalk lines had vanished from the floor, and the crushing weight in his chest felt, for the first time, bearably light. <words>456</words>
