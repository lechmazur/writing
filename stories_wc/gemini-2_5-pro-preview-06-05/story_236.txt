Elian, the last meek blacksmith, presided over the silent blueprints of the underwater city planning office. <words>16</words>
Here, across the hush of time’s final ripple, the water held everything perfectly still, a grand and final quiet. <words>33</words>
His singular purpose was to harness heartbreak as fuel, a long and lonely task steeped in luminous regret. <words>49</words>
The unfinished bargain he’d struck with her, with Lyra, demanded a specific type of energy to re-forge a single stolen moment. <words>69</words>
His method was strange, yet it was the only one left: by verifying half-baked stories from random hitchhikers. <words>86</words>
They were not people, but echoes, shimmering transients who drifted through his office with tales of loss from forgotten worlds. <words>105</words>
One flickered before him now, a being of fractured light whispering of a sun-warmed kiss it could barely recall. <words>124</words>
Elian listened with a practiced gentleness, his calloused fingers tracing the worn cover of a softcover dictionary. <words>142</words>
This book was his primary tool, the key to an answer that felt openly hidden within the universe’s last dregs of sorrow. <words>164</words>
He wasn’t checking facts, but the authenticity of pain, cross-referencing the hitchhiker’s words for their purity of ache. <words>183</words>
“She said ‘farewell’,” the echo sighed, “but her eyes meant ‘forever’.” <words>194</words>
Elian’s breath caught. <words>197</words>
He flipped through the dictionary’s thin pages, his heart a dull, familiar drum against his ribs. <words>213</words>
He found the entry for ‘forever’, a word he knew intimately, but then he scanned the adjacent definitions. <words>231</words>
There, beside it, was a nearly obsolete term for a love that persists beyond a dimension’s collapse. <words>248</words>
It was the precise nuance he had been missing, the final component for the metaphysical forge that sat where his desk should be. <words>271</words>
For centuries, he had gathered the ambient despair of others, adding it to the vast, terrible ocean of his own. <words>291</words>
He had believed the sheer volume of grief was the key, but the bargain was more subtle. <words>308</words>
It required not just power, but a perfect, unbearable understanding. <words>318</words>
Now he had it. <words>322</words>
With a quiet reverence, Elian closed the dictionary and faced the forge, which shimmered with contained starlight. <words>340</words>
He channeled the hitchhiker’s validated sorrow, weaving it with the memory of Lyra’s hand slipping from his. <words>358</words>
He focused on the new word, on its impossible promise, and used it as the flint. <words>374</words>
He had to ignite the accumulated heartbreak, to burn it all away in one brilliant, defiant act. <words>390</words>
A silent, white fire erupted in the deep, not of heat, but of pure, crystallized memory. <words>406</words>
The office dissolved into a single, perfect image: Lyra turning back to him, her eyes saying not ‘farewell’ or ‘forever’, but simply, ‘wait’. <words>429</words>
The bargain was complete, his regret now a luminous, eternal star in the final darkness. <words>444</words>
