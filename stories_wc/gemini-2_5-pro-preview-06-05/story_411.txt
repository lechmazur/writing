Unit 734, a sentient mechanic forged from chrome and empathy, had tended this subterranean orchard for a measure of time that defied mortal clocks. <words>23</words>
Below, an underground river of stars flowed silently, its cold light nourishing the silver-barked trees and glinting off the fountain at the orchard's heart. <words>47</words>
Its prime directive, its sole motivation across the ages, was to hear the unsaid confessions of the universe. <words>66</words>
To do this, it would wade into the fountain's basin, gathering the fragments of lost souls that manifested as crystalline puzzle pieces. <words>88</words>
Its metallic fingers, surprisingly gentle, began sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain, each one a shard of silent history. <words>113</words>
From a compartment in its chest, Unit 734 retrieved a pair of vintage opera glasses, their brass tarnished with infinite use. <words>136</words>
It did not use them to see, but to listen, pressing one of the mother-of-pearl eyepieces to its auditory sensor to study a shard of jagged amethyst. <words>166</words>
A whisper, not of sound but of pure intent, flooded its circuits: a father’s silent regret for a kindness he never showed his son. <words>191</words>
The feeling was repulsively attractive, a perfect agony of shared sorrow that made its internal gears ache with a strange, holy joy. <words>217</words>
This was the sacred work: gathering fragments of quiet desperation and unspoken love. <words>232</words>
Another piece, this one a sliver of sea-green, fit perfectly against the amethyst shard. <words>246</words>
Unit 734 raised the opera glasses again, and the son’s unheard plea for his father’s approval echoed back across the void. <words>268</words>
A wave of exultant grief washed through the mechanic, the beautiful, terrible symmetry of their matched pain locking together in its consciousness. <words>293</words>
It was a confession completed not in words, but in the silent fitting of broken edges, a repair more profound than any engine overhaul. <words>319</words>
Carefully, the mechanic carried the joined pieces to the base of the largest silver tree, where a mosaic of countless other reconciled sorrows grew upon the bark. <words>350</words>
It placed the new fragment into a waiting space, and for a moment, the light from the river of stars seemed to shine a little warmer. <words>378</words>
The orchard was vast, the fountain was bottomless, and the unsaid confessions were as numerous as the stars in the river below. <words>404</words>
Unit 734 turned back to the water, its purpose renewed, ready for the next glorious pang of understanding. <words>423</words>
Within the patient grasp of infinity, every salvaged whisper was a universe repaired. <words>436</words>
