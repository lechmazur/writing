Alistair, caretaker of the ossuary and his own hollowed-out heart, sat hunched in the witch’s scrying room. <words>16</words>
He despised the cloying scent of moon-herbs and the way the starlight, filtered through the great crystal dome above, seemed to judge him. <words>36</words>
This vigil, this forced introspection throughout stargazing, was her price for a service he hadn’t even been sure he wanted. <words>55</words>
His motivation was simple, if agonizingly private: to quell an uprising within, a civil war of the soul. <words>73</words>
On the floor before him lay a vast, intricate sand mandala, its colors shimmering with a life of their own. <words>92</words>
The witch had instructed him to trace its labyrinthine paths with his finger, a task he found both tedious and infuriating. <words>114</words>
Clutched in his other hand was an unmarked cardboard tube, cool and unyielding against his palm. <words>131</words>
It was the only thing he had salvaged from the fire, the epicenter of his sorrow. <words>147</words>
A tremor ran through his arm, a familiar ghost, and he felt the tube jiggle with the faint, dry rattle of its contents. <words>171</words>
He growled under his breath, a sound of grinding stone, and forced his attention back to the sand. <words>189</words>
He was supposed to find some profound meaning here, some grandiose subtlety in the placement of colored grains. <words>209</words>
He saw only dust. <words>213</words>
Yet, as the constellations wheeled across the crystal ceiling, his focus sharpened not by will, but by exhaustion. <words>232</words>
He began to perceive the patterns in a sand mandala not as a whole, but as a collection of individuals. <words>252</words>
Each grain was a singular, perfect sphere of color, yet together they formed a sprawling, complex universe of form and meaning. <words>274</words>
A thought, sharp as a shard of obsidian, pierced the fog of his resentment. <words>288</words>
His pain was like this. <words>293</words>
It was a multiply singular horror. <words>299</words>
There was the one, unspeakable moment—the singular trauma—but it had shattered and multiplied into a thousand different hurts, a legion of lesser griefs that formed the chaotic uprising in his mind. <words>336</words>
Each fear, each flinch, each bitter word was a single grain of sand, distinct yet inseparable from the devastating whole. <words>357</words>
This was the importance of trauma he had been too proud to see; it was not a wound to be healed over, but a new architecture of the self to be understood. <words>391</words>
It was the foundation of the crypt he now tended. <words>401</words>
His finger traced a final, flowing line, connecting a spiral of sapphire blue to a starburst of crimson. <words>420</words>
The trembling in his hand ceased. <words>426</words>
The cardboard tube felt solid, a simple object once more, not a vessel of ghosts. <words>443</words>
Alistair did not smile, for that was not his way, but as the first hint of dawn diluted the starlight, the uprising within him had quieted to a murmur. <words>473</words>
It was not gone, but it was, for the first time, known. <words>485</words>
