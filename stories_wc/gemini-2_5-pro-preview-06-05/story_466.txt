Alistair was contemplating the merits of a triple-cream brie when the impulse struck him, a quiet but insistent hum beneath the grocery store's muzak. <words>24</words>
It was a sudden urge to explore a path not taken, a dusty service road he’d never noticed behind the supermarket's loading dock. <words>46</words>
Leaving his cart near the dairy case, he slipped out a side door, the mundane world of coupons and checkout lines dissolving behind him. <words>70</words>
The path wound upward, ending abruptly at the base of a derelict smoke signal tower, a stone relic from a forgotten era of communication. <words>96</words>
Inside, dust motes danced in the slivers of light, illuminating a small, forgotten wooden box on a crumbling ledge. <words>116</words>
He lifted the lid, his connoisseur’s eye immediately recognizing the treasure within: a stack of vintage seed packets from the long-defunct ‘Elysian Flora Company’. <words>144</words>
Each packet was a miniature work of art, depicting flowers that seemed just a little too vibrant, a little too perfect for nature. <words>168</words>
Alistair knew, with a certainty that thrilled his morally ambiguous soul, that these were not for planting but for reading. <words>189</words>
He took the box, a quiet act of appropriation to corner an elusive destiny he felt buzzing in his very bones. <words>211</words>
Back in the sterile quiet of a 24-hour copy shop, the fluorescent lights seemed to mock the organic beauty of the packets. <words>234</words>
He wasn't sure what he was looking for, only that the answer lay in decoding the forgotten language of their design. <words>256</words>
He decided to xerograph them, hoping the crude heat and light of the machine might agitate the old inks into revealing their secrets. <words>281</words>
The first copy slid into the tray, a ghostly black-and-white echo of the original packet for ‘Nocturne Poppies’. <words>301</words>
But as he laid it next to the second copy, one for ‘Sun-Kissed Marigolds’, a pattern began to emerge from the gentle chaos of the floral illustrations. <words>332</words>
The filigree on the poppy packet was not decoration; it was a fragment of a star chart. <words>349</words>
The marigold’s sunburst was a compass rose, its points aligning with the constellations revealed on the other copies he quickly made. <words>374</words>
Each seed packet was a piece of a celestial map, a guide hidden in plain sight for decades. <words>394</words>
He gathered the warm, static-charged papers, the flimsy copies feeling infinitely more valuable than the originals. <words>413</words>
The map was incomplete, of course, requiring more packets, more hunting, more of his particular brand of cunning. <words>434</words>
But standing there, amid the low hum of the copier, Alistair smiled, for he had finally found the first concrete step on the path to his own myth. <words>465</words>
His destiny was no longer elusive; it was simply waiting to be collated. <words>478</words>
