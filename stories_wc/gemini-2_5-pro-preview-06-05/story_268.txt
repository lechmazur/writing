The abandoned waiting area held its breath, dust motes dancing in the slivers of light from boarded-up windows. <words>19</words> Kael stood before the antique funhouse mirror, its warped glass a carnival of grotesque possibilities. <words>34</words> A tinny voice from the comms unit on a rusted chair was his only connection to the world he fought to forget, a constant reminder of the price of war. <words>61</words> He ignored the voice for now, his focus absolute. <words>70</words> His motivation was singular: to master the ancient art of seeing truth where there was only deception. <words>87</words> He began to move, a display of what looked like artfully clumsy stumbles and off-balance lunges. <words>103</words> Each step was a calculation, each awkward sway a deliberate shift in perspective. <words>116</words> His reflection stretched and squeezed, a monstrous parody that mocked his human form. <words>129</words> In his left hand, he rolled a plain wooden bead between his thumb and forefinger, its smooth, simple reality a stark contrast to the visual chaos. <words>155</words> The bead was all that remained of the monastery that taught this art, before the conflict had consumed it and everyone he knew. <words>179</words> The screaming silence of the room was a familiar pressure, the ghosts of a thousand unheard pleas echoing in his mind. <words>200</words> He was not looking at himself, but through himself, by tracking distortions in the antique funhouse mirror to find their source point. <words>223</words> The goal was not to fix the reflection, but to understand it so completely that he could, for a single, impossible moment, flatter it into truth. <words>248</words> His clumsy dance became faster, a blur of motion that seemed to defy the laws of balance. <words>265</words> He was chasing the lie, cornering it within the curved glass. <words>276</words> The voice on the comms droned on about the target, a corrupt official whose own life was a distorted reflection of power. <words>299</words> Kael didn't need the details; he only needed the distortion. <words>309</words> Then, for a heartbeat, he found it. <words>316</words> A fractional shift of his weight, a tilt of his head so slight it was barely a movement, and the monstrous caricature in the glass resolved. <words>342</words> For one perfect second, the mirror showed only a man, tired and still, his eyes holding the weight of a hundred battles. <words>364</words> The image flattened, the lies stripped away, leaving only the stark, unadorned core. <words>377</words> He had mastered the perspective. <words>382</words> The screaming silence in his head finally quieted, replaced by a cold, sharp focus. <words>396</words> He stopped moving, his body once again a study in stillness. <words>407</words> "Location confirmed," Kael said, his voice a rasp. <words>414</words> He pocketed the plain wooden bead, the warmth of the wood a final, fleeting comfort. <words>428</words> The art was mastered not for enlightenment, but for execution, and that was the truest price of war. <words>446</words>
