In the hush of the barn loft, just after sunrise, Elias stood motionless amidst his life's work. <words>16</words>
Sunlight streamed through the hay-dusted air, glinting off the brass and copper viscera of the Chronoclasm Engine that filled the space. <words>36</words>
His gaze, however, was fixed on the one thing that didn't belong: a battered old skateboard leaning against a stack of cog-filled crates. <words>59</words>
Its deck was a chaotic collage of faded stickers—grinning skulls, punk bands, a cartoon wolf howling at a shattered moon—each a tiny monument to a boy who believed the world was an endless summer. <words>96</words>
That boy was a ghost, and this faithfully odd workshop was his tomb. <words>109</words>
Elias had paused his work an hour ago, his hands suddenly feeling alien as they calibrated the final esoteric sequence. <words>130</words>
He had felt a flicker of something, a phantom limb of doubt for the boy on the board. <words>148</words>
Then, a low, mournful cry drifted across the fields from the valley below. <words>161</words>
It was the 6:05 train, punctual to the second, a sound as predictable and soul-crushing as the turning of a gear in a clock that only ever told the same time. <words>193</words>
That whistle was the true voice of his enemy, the hymn of the gods of stagnation he had sworn to slam a door on. <words>218</words>
They were the deities of the mundane, the patrons of the unchanging schedule, the architects of a world where every sunrise was a perfect, hollow replica of the one before. <words>252</words>
His purpose, a placid ferocity that had burned in his chest for years, solidified once more into cold certainty. <words>272</words>
This wasn't destruction; it was a necessary correction, a forced reset against a world that had forgotten how to change. <words>293</words>
He walked to the skateboard, his worn leather boots silent on the dusty floorboards. <words>307</words>
With a strange and gentle reverence, he ran a calloused finger over the cartoon wolf, a final, quiet goodbye to the innocence it represented. <words>335</words>
The boy who rode this board had dreamed of escaping his small town. <words>348</words>
Elias, the man he had become, would unmake the town, the tracks, and the entire suffocating timetable itself. <words>368</words>
He was a calm doomsayer, offering a terrifying and absolute form of freedom from the tyranny of the expected. <words>388</words>
Turning his back on the relic of his youth, he faced the silent, waiting engine. <words>402</words>
The train whistle faded, leaving only the hum of nascent energy in the loft. <words>417</words>
His expression was serene, a man at peace with the beautiful, terrible end he was about to create. <words>434</words>
With a steady hand and a clear heart, he reached for the primary ignition lever. <words>449</words>
It was time to resume. <words>454</words>
