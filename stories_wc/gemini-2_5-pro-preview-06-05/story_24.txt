Elian, a meandering bard, considered the silence that had fallen over the labyrinthine bookstore occupying the entire mountain. <words>19</words>
Sunlight, fractured through crystalline ceilings, illuminated dust motes dancing over forgotten folios, but the people shuffling through the aisles seemed colder than the stone shelves. <words>46</words>
He felt an urgent need to stir hearts grown cold, to reignite some lost connection. <words>61</words>
His purpose was to sow a peculiar, radiating warmth in the loneliest corners of this fractured idyll. <words>79</words>
So he descended into the mountain's gut, to a seedy bar tucked between sections on forgotten wars and speculative anatomy. <words>101</words>
There, he began his work through subversive puppet shows, his stage a precariously balanced stack of encyclopedias. <words>120</words>
His puppets were ordinarily extraordinary things, carved from discarded book covers and bound with frayed page markers. <words>138</words>
One, his tragic hero, was a marionette of the Great Orator, its mouth fitted with a set of dentures rumored to have belonged to the famous figure himself. <words>169</words>
The Orator's grand speeches were now twisted into justifications for isolation, his legacy a tool for building walls between people. <words>192</words>
Elian's puppet, however, did not boom with rhetoric; it trembled and wept silent, wooden tears. <words>209</words>
In the dim light, a young woman sat alone, her face lit by the glow of her phone, her thumb hovering over the screen. <words>234</words>
She was trapped in that terrible lull before an apologetic text is sent, a chasm of pride and fear. <words>254</words>
The bard made the Orator puppet clack the infamous dentures, not in a speech, but in a chatter of regret. <words>276</words>
It mimed the act of reaching out, its clumsy wooden hand extending over the tiny stage towards an unseen other. <words>297</words>
A profound warmth, simple and human, began to radiate from the performance, touching the patrons who had expected only cheap mockery. <words>322</words>
The puppet’s silent plea to bridge a gap was more powerful than any of the real Orator’s famous words had ever been. <words>346</words>
The young woman looked up from her phone, her expression broken, and a single tear traced a path through her stony facade. <words>369</words>
She lowered her gaze again, but this time her thumb moved with newfound resolve, typing words she had been too afraid to form. <words>395</words>
Elian watched her, a quiet satisfaction settling in his chest as he saw one small seed of connection take root. <words>416</words>
He packed away the Orator and its storied dentures, knowing his meandering journey through the mountain's cold heart was far from over. <words>441</words>
Another seedy bar, another cold room, awaited his ordinarily extraordinary brand of healing tomorrow. <words>458</words>
