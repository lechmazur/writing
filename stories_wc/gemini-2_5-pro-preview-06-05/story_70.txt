The scribe, Elias, despised the damp heat of the witch’s greenhouse, a bubble of impossible life clinging to a hill of silent gravestones. <words>21</words>
His commission was to catalog the deceased sorceress’s effects, a task he approached with the rigid precision that had defined his entire life. <words>42</words>
His workspace was illuminated by a single, bizarre artifact: a glass bulb containing a filament that pulsed with a soft, electric hum, a supposed prototype from Tesla’s own workshop. <words>73</words>
It cast long, dancing shadows of belladonna and wolfsbane across the stone floor, mocking his need for order. <words>91</words>
His current puzzle was an unsealed envelope, its contents long gone, leaving only a mystery in its place. <words>110</words>
He believed the secret lay not in what was taken, but in what was left behind. <words>126</words>
For hours, he had been meticulously analyzing the leftover adhesive on the paper flap, scraping microscopic samples onto a slide. <words>148</words>
His goal was not born of simple curiosity, but from a desperate, internal mandate: to finally learn how to cradle empathy in arms of steel. <words>174</words>
He had always seen emotion as a variable to be eliminated, a flaw in the logic of existence, yet his own coldness was a cage. <words>201</words>
Under his lens, he expected to find a magical bonding agent or a coded chemical residue, something quantifiable and absolute. <words>223</words>
Instead, he found a single, crystallized teardrop, preserved by a dusting of ghost-orchid pollen. <words>239</words>
The puzzle piece didn't just fit; it shattered the entire board. <words>250</words>
The witch hadn't sealed her final letter with a spell, but with a moment of profound, human sorrow. <words>269</words>
All his rules, all his ledgers and laws of conduct, felt like brittle parchment in a sudden fire. <words>287</words>
He was certainly uncertain of everything he had ever built his life upon, yet this new, terrifying vacancy felt more true than any fact he had ever recorded. <words>321</words>
This was the quiet transformation he hadn't known he was seeking, a silent earthquake in the bedrock of his soul. <words>343</words>
A feeling, vast and unnamed, swelled in his chest, demanding more space than his constricted frame could offer. <words>363</words>
He stood, knocking over his stool with a clatter that went unheard over the sudden thunder in his own ears. <words>383</words>
Elias opened his mouth and let out a raw, guttural bellow that shook the very glass of the greenhouse. <words>402</words>
It was a sound of breaking, of release, of a man forged in iron finally feeling the rust of a tear. <words>424</words>
As the echo faded among the tombstones, the Tesla bulb shone on, its light no longer mocking, but steady and warm. <words>446</words>
A buried optimism began to sprout in the barren soil of his heart, fragile and green. <words>463</words>
