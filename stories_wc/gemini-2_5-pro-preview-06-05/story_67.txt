The jovial blacksmith, Alistair, sat amidst the brass and copper chaos of his late friend's contraption-filled attic. <words>18</words>
A lone metronome, its wooden arm swinging with hypnotic precision, was the only thing that moved with purpose in the dusty air. <words>39</words>
Tick. <words>40</words>
He was here to endure. <words>45</words>
Tock. <words>46</words>
His confidence was a threadbare coat, worn proudly but precariously thin against the chill of his task. <words>63</words>
He believed, with a fervor that bordered on madness, that he could prove darkness can be tamed. <words>81</words>
The rhythmic pulse was his hammer, the encroaching memory his malleable, white-hot iron. <words>95</words>
He focused on the sound, a shield of fervent indifference against the image that always threatened to coalesce behind his eyes. <words>117</words>
It began, as always, with the screech of wheels on steel. <words>128</words>
Then came the window, a grimy frame for a face he was trying to mechanize, to strip of its power. <words>149</words>
He saw her final wave from the departing train window, a gesture that had sliced his world in two. <words>167</words>
His breath hitched, a betrayal of the calm he was forcing upon himself. <words>180</words>
His gaze dropped to the device on the workbench before him, a whirring monstrosity of gears and levers designed for a single purpose. <words>204</words>
At its heart, held in a delicate silver clasp, was a single earring, a tiny pearl that caught the dim light. <words>224</words>
Her earring. <words>226</words>
The contraption's function was absurdly simple: with every tenth tick of the metronome, a tiny brass hammer would tap the pearl, a physical punctuation to his mental exercise. <words>256</words>
He was attempting to file down the sharp edges of grief, to make the memory of her wave just another beat in a predictable rhythm. <words>281</words>
This was the human condition, he mused, this desperate need to build machines to manage the unmanageable heart. <words>300</words>
The pain surged, a familiar tide threatening to drown the steady tick-tock. <words>312</words>
Her smile in that window was not a memory but a phantom, alive and mocking his efforts. <words>328</words>
He gripped the edge of the bench, knuckles white, his jovial mask slipping to reveal the raw desperation beneath. <words>347</words>
But he would not break. <words>352</words>
He would endure. <words>355</words>
He aligned his breathing with the swinging arm, inhaling on the tick, exhaling on the tock. <words>371</words>
He watched the little hammer rise. <words>377</words>
He let the image of the wave fill his mind, raw and terrible. <words>389</words>
Tap. <words>390</words>
The hammer struck the pearl, the sound barely audible, yet it was enough. <words>402</words>
The wave receded, not gone, but contained within the beat. <words>412</words>
Alistair let out a slow breath, a ghost of a smile returning to his lips. <words>426</words>
The darkness was still there, of course, but for one more cycle, it was precisely where he had put it. <words>446</words>
It was tamed. <words>449</words>
