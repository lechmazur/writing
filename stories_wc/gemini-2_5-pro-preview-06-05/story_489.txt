From the lantern room of the derelict lighthouse, I have watched the world forget. <words>13</words>
They call this place haunted, and perhaps it is, but I am merely a witness bound to the salt-stained glass and the spiraling iron stairs. <words>34</words>
Below, the sea churns with an old and patient knowledge, an undercurrent of wisdom that whispers of what has been lost. <words>54</words>
Tonight, that loss threatens to become permanent. <words>61</words>
Miles away, in a city of blinding lights, a dancer prepares to perform a sacred rite as a hollow spectacle, its soul stripped for applause. <words>88</words>
Her performance is a lie, a beautiful poison that will finalize the erasure of the true ceremony. <words>106</words>
My purpose is singular: to rescue the traditions she unknowingly desecrates. <words>117</words>
It is a duty that requires an aggressively kind hand, one that will shatter a comfortable falsehood to preserve a vital truth. <words>139</words>
On the dusty windowsill rests a cheap plastic whistle, left by a child decades ago, a discordant note in this symphony of decay. <words>163</words>
It is a profane object, yet it will be my instrument. <words>174</words>
The air grows still, charged with anticipation. <words>180</words>
I can feel the moment approaching, a convergence of timelines stretched taut like a bowstring. <words>196</words>
It is the instant a dancer’s foot, clad in silk, first touches the stage. <words>210</words>
From the abyssal dark below the cliffs, a sound begins to build, resonating through the stone foundation of my tower. <words>231</words>
It is the call of a whale from the deep, a low and mournful frequency that is not a song of sorrow, but of summons. <words>256</words>
This is the signal, the ancient power rising to meet the moment. <words>268</words>
My calm is brazen, absolute. <words>273</words>
As the whale’s voice crests into a wave of pure sound and the dancer’s toe makes its silent, momentous contact with the polished floor, I act. <words>301</words>
With a surge of focused will, I fling the basic plastic whistle through the open window. <words>317</words>
It arcs out into the night, a tiny piece of modernity cast into the vast, ancient dark. <words>333</words>
The whistle does not fall silently. <words>338</words>
Carried on the whale’s call, it emits a single, piercing note that travels not through the air, but through the very heart of the tradition itself. <words>363</words>
In the theater, the dancer falters, her rehearsed grace replaced by a sudden, intuitive memory. <words>378</words>
The music stumbles. <words>381</words>
Her foot lifts, and when it comes down again, it is not with the lightness of a performer, but with the heavy, grounding stomp of a shaman. <words>407</words>
The true dance has begun. <words>412</words>
From my perch, I feel the shift, the correction of a current that had been led astray. <words>429</words>
The tradition is safe, rescued not by prayer or plea, but by a forceful, necessary intrusion. <words>445</words>
The sea is quiet again, its wisdom affirmed, and I remain, an unseen observer in a haunted room, content. <words>463</words>
