The final countdown echoed through the whispering gallery, each number a stone dropped into the vast, silent pool of my focus. <21>
I am, by trade, a purveyor of paths, a smuggler of hope, though the authorities would use less poetic terms. <39>
They would not understand that this work is not for profit but is the purest expression of the art of survival. <59>
My fingers, stained with dust and purpose, traced the delicate form of the child’s skeleton key that hung from my neck. <81>
It was a relic of a promise, the anchor for a logically emotional man in an illogical time. <99>
My task was simple, if one considers navigating the city’s forgotten circulatory system to map an escape route for thousands a simple thing. <124>
I held my work with a certain grandiose modesty; after all, someone had to do it. <141>
The air shifted, and I closed my eyes, relying on the one true compass I had left. <159>
Faintly, carried on a subterranean draft, came the scent of a garden at night—jasmine and damp earth, the ghost of a world we were about to lose. <189>
That scent was my method, a fragrant breadcrumb trail leading to the main aqueduct tunnel. <205>
The countdown pulsed: "Sixty minutes remaining." <211>
Panic was a luxury, an emotion I filed away under ‘later’. <222>
I moved deeper, my chalk stick scratching symbols onto the damp brick, connecting the city’s secret veins. <241>
The whispers of the gallery above were replaced by the groans of the earth below, a symphony of decay. <261>
I knew these tunnels better than I knew my own face, every crack and fissure a familiar scar. <280>
"Thirty minutes." <283>
The map was nearly complete, a beautiful, sprawling thing of desperate geometry. <296>
But one final, unverified passage promised a shortcut that could save ten precious minutes for the evacuation. <316>
It was an overreach, a gamble against physics and time, and my logic screamed against it. <333>
Yet, the image of the small hand that once held this key pushed me forward, a silent, emotional command. <353>
I stepped into the crumbling archway, and the world answered my hubris with a deafening roar of collapsing stone. <374>
Dust filled my lungs as the tunnel sealed behind me, the scent of jasmine now cut off forever. <393>
I was trapped, but the map was safe in my oilskin pouch. <405>
I found a narrow ventilation grate, barely wide enough for my arm, leading back toward the main passage. <424>
With the last of my strength, I pushed the rolled map through the bars, a final, blameless offering. <442>
The countdown faded into a low hum as I leaned back against the cold, unmoving rock. <458>
It was, I thought, a reasonably elegant solution. <467>
