Her clients called her a heartbreak counselor, a title she wore like a borrowed coat. <14>
She preferred to think of herself as a student of the gravity of desires, that inescapable pull that warped timelines around a single, foolish wish. <34>
The sky reflection pool was her classroom, a perfect mirror for the temporal distortions above. <47>
Today, she was restlessly curious, a familiar ache behind her eyes. <58>
Her amber earrings, a gift from a man who had loved her in three different centuries, felt unusually heavy against her skin. <79>
She had learned her unique trade by tracking cloud trails, the faint, shimmering scars left by chrononauts punching through the past. <99>
Most were faint, harmless echoes of tourists visiting historical moments. <109>
But one trail, blooming now in the water's reflection, was jagged and raw with obsession. <123>
It was his. <126>
He was trying again, chasing the ghost of a moment they had shared, convinced he could rewrite the ending without shattering the beginning. <148>
She watched the celestial wound pulse in the water, a testament to a love so strong it had become a cage. <167>
A cage for them both, she realized, as his repeated incursions kept her tethered to a history she had fought to escape. <187>
Her entire practice was built on a single, painful truth: that the freedom promised by time travel was the most beautiful illusion of all. <210>
You couldn't erase a scar by reliving the cut. <219>
Her motivation had always been to proclaim yourself free in a cage of illusions, to find a way to live with the ghosts without becoming one. <244>
He was making her a ghost. <250>
A flicker of her old self, the femme fatale who knew how to sever attachments, sparked within her. <267>
This wasn't a case for counseling; it was a problem requiring a more permanent solution. <281>
A cautious impulsiveness, the feeling of stepping off a cliff while knowing exactly where the updraft was, took hold. <300>
She would not let his desire dictate her present any longer. <311>
She stood, the reflection rippling away from her boots. <319>
Reaching into her satchel, her fingers found the cool metal tab of the interior pocket. <334>
Zip. <335>
The sound was a final, sharp verdict in the quiet air. <345>
Inside was a paradox key, a device that could lock a specific temporal coordinate, making it inaccessible forever. <363>
Using it on him, on them, was an act of profound violence and profound mercy. <377>
It was an amputation. <381>
She would cut him out of time to save him from it. <392>
And in doing so, she would finally, truly, be alone with her choices. <404>
Walking away from the pool, she didn't look back at the sky, no longer needing its fractured reflection to see her path. <424>
