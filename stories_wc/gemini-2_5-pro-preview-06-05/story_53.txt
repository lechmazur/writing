The last box was the most important, and Kael, in his rash need to protect it, nearly dropped it twice on the stone steps. <words>21</words>
He slammed the heavy oak door of the fortress shut against the wind, the sound swallowed by the ceaseless moan from the valley’s howling caverns. <words>44</words>
All throughout moving day, this ancient refuge had felt less like a sanctuary and more like the throat of some great, lonely beast. <words>64</words>
His motivation was simple: to find solace in the vastness of the cosmos, a quiet place to escape the noise of his own past. <words>88</words>
Yet the valley offered only a different kind of noise, a deep, resonant song of stone and air that vibrated through his bones. <words>111</words>
He realized he’d left the thermal blankets in the transport, the one thing needed to survive the night. <words>129</words>
With a frustrated sigh, he went back outside, only to find a fresh rockfall had blocked the main path down to the landing platform. <words>153</words>
There was another way, a narrow goat trail he’d been warned against, a different route home that skirted the maw of the largest cavern. <words>178</words>
He took it, his boots crunching on loose scree as the wind whipped his coat. <words>193</words>
It was there he had the chance encounter. <words>202</words>
An old woman sat on a stone ledge, so still she seemed a part of the rock itself. <words>219</words>
She was entirely quiet, her face a roadmap of wrinkles, and she simply watched him, her eyes holding no judgment, only a deep and unnerving calm. <words>246</words>
She lifted a single, delicate hand and pointed not at him, but at the cavern beside them, its howl momentarily softening into something like a chord. <words>273</words>
Kael froze, his hand tightening on the precious box he’d brought with him out of instinct. <words>290</words>
He gave a short, jerky nod and hurried past her, grabbing the blankets and scrambling back to the fortress, the woman’s silent gaze following him. <words>317</words>
Inside, the silence of the thick stone walls was a stark contrast to the world outside. <words>333</words>
He sat on the floor and finally opened the box, carefully laying out his collection of old postcards. <words>351</words>
They were his secret, his treasure, each one a universally unique depiction of a place that could not be: a city built on the rings of a gas giant, a forest of crystalline trees under a binary sun, a shoreline where nebulae washed ashore. <words>400</words>
He had spent his life protecting them, these impossible messages from an unknown sender. <words>415</words>
Staring at a postcard of a star-sailer drifting through the Orion arm, he suddenly heard the cavern’s howl again, not through the door, but in his memory. <words>444</words>
It was the same chord the woman had revealed, a low, cosmic hum that matched the painted starlight on the card. <words>466</words>
This was the dawn of awareness; the fortress wasn't a shield from the cosmos, but an amplifier for it, and the postcards were not just pictures, but invitations. <words>496</words>
