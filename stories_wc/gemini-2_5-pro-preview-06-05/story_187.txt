The nightmares had led him here, a trail of psychic breadcrumbs scattered across a fractured dreamscape. <words>16</words>
Kael clutched the splintered floorboard from the abandoned cabin, its weight a familiar anchor against the thrum of his own disquiet. <words>36</words>
He found the witch's familiar training ground hidden behind a facade so mesmerizingly bland it repelled notice like a shield. <words>57</words>
A row of identical, grey sheds stood in a perfect, soulless line, the only sign of life the twitch of a rabbit's nose in a cage. <words>82</words>
He pushed open the door to the largest shed at the precise moment a stern-faced woman wiped the final, glowing sigil from a slate board. <words>109</words>
The air, once thick with power, thinned into the mundane scent of chalk dust and damp earth. <words>126</words>
"You don't belong here," she said, her voice as sharp as broken glass. <words>138</words>
A small, feathered creature with too many eyes shrieked and scrambled behind her legs. <words>152</words>
"Move, you useless thing," Kael grunted, shoving a wooden stool with his boot to block a wisp of residual energy crackling towards the familiar. <words>177</words>
The creature flinched but was unharmed, and the womanâ€™s eyes narrowed with grudging understanding. <words>193</words>
"I'm here to archive your ritual practices," he stated, his stoic tone leaving no room for debate. <words>210</words>
It was a necessary lie, a half-truth to mask the desperation that had gnawed at him for years. <words>228</words>
He had to impose, for there was no other way. <words>238</words>
"We share nothing with outsiders," the teacher countered, folding her arms. <words>249</words>
Kael stepped forward and laid the heavy floorboard on her teaching table, the ancient wood dark against the pale slate. <words>270</words>
"This is from the High Hollow cabin," he said, tapping a faint carving on its surface. <words>286</words>
"You abandoned the Unbinding rite, but I have not." <words>296</words>
Her composure faltered, a flicker of fear crossing her features. <words>306</words>
"That rite is an abomination," she whispered. <words>313</words>
"It's a kindness," Kael countered, his voice rough with an emotion he refused to name. <words>328</words>
"My sister is trapped by the binding you failed to contain, and her nightmares have been my guide." <words>347</words>
His quest wasn't for some dusty archive; it was a rescue mission fueled by a brash, painful tenderness. <words>364</words>
"I need the formula you just wiped away." <words>373</words>
The lie had served its purpose, peeling back the layers of protocol to reveal the raw, beating heart of their shared history. <words>396</words>
The teacher looked from the floorboard to his haunted eyes, then back to the terrified familiar peeking out from behind her robes. <words>420</words>
She picked up a fresh piece of chalk, its snap in the silence a declaration. <words>435</words>
"The first sequence is a containment field," she began, her hand moving across the slate with renewed purpose. <words>452</words>
"Pay attention, wanderer; you only get this lesson once." <words>463</words>
