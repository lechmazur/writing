<story>
Finn, a pickpocket by trade and baffled by calling, stood in the haunted lighthouse engine room between appointments. <words>17</words>
Propped on a rust-eaten console was Silas, the eerie ventriloquist dummy whose gaze seemed to bore through the veil of the world. <words>38</words>
This was the crucible, the space where he practiced the art of transformation. <words>49</words>
His motivation was simple and absolute: to challenge the status quo of the dead who lingered here and the living who forgot them. <words>70</words>
With scorching poise that felt borrowed from a king or a furnace, Finn placed a hand on the dummy’s wooden head. <words>89</words>
He had to sustain the connection, this fragile bridge built of will and spectral static. <words>103</words>
The first words arrived, not from his lips but in his mind, a state so confusingly lucid it was like reading a page before it was written. <words>129</words>
He began the impromptu poetry session, his voice a low, steady anchor in the humming silence. <words>144</words>
“Iron heart, you sleep in salt,” he recited, the verse emerging fully formed, a gift from the ghost of the last keeper. <words>164</words>
“Your brass veins hold no heat, but tell a fault.” <words>174</words>
Each stanza was a negotiation, a demand for ghosts to yield their secrets and for the living world to listen. <words>192</words>
He was no longer just Finn, the deft hand who could lift a watch without a whisper. <words>208</words>
Here, he was a conduit, an arbiter, his old life a shedding skin. <words>221</words>
The air grew thick, charged with the pressure of untold histories seeking a voice. <words>234</words>
Silas’s painted smile seemed to widen, a crack in the facade of reality. <words>247</words>
Finn felt the weight of their spectral attention, a cold press of an audience he could not see but knew intimately. <words>266</words>
He spoke of the sea’s relentless memory and the betrayal of a faulty lens, channeling a century of isolation into resonant meter. <words>287</words>
This was how he fought, not with a blade, but with cadence and rhyme. <words>300</words>
He was redefining power, taking the ephemeral sorrow of this place and forging it into a statement. <words>317</words>
The final poem landed with the force of a physical blow, a declaration aimed at the uncaring town across the water. <words>337</words>
It was a promise of remembrance, a threat of haunting clarity. <words>347</words>
As the last word echoed into the ironworks, the oppressive energy receded, leaving behind a clean, sharp silence. <words>364</words>
Finn took a steadying breath, the scorching poise dimming to a pilot light within him. <words>378</words>
He was still baffled by the mechanics of it all, by the ghost in his machine. <words>394</words>
But the purpose was sharp, the transformation undeniable. <words>401</words>
He straightened his collar, gave a curt nod to Silas, and turned to leave for his next appointment. <words>418</words>
This one was not with a fence in a grimy alley, but with the town mayor, to whom he had a few lines of poetry to deliver. <words>443</words>
