The brass gears of the Chronos Lounge hissed softly, a mechanical sigh in the quiet between calls. <words>16</words>
Kael stared at the empty pages of his notebook, the usual cascade of illusions and sleight-of-hand having dwindled to a frustrating blank. <words>36</words>
His act on the cobbled squares outside was a lie, a flimsy cover for the secret he carried like a shroud. <words>55</words>
Tucked inside his satchel, the rusted knight’s gauntlet felt heavier than its iron weight, a relic of a war he desperately wanted to end. <words>79</words>
He was waiting for her, his adversary, the one person who shared the burden of that gauntlet’s history. <words>98</words>
Every tick of the grand Orrery clock on the far wall was a second lost, another moment closer to the summons that would pull them back to their opposing sides. <words>129</words>
His mind was a barren stage; the creative block was a fortress built from years of bitterness and suspicion. <words>147</words>
He needed to find the right words, a performance not of magic, but of peace. <words>162</words>
His fingers, restless, traced the intricate carving on the wall beside his velvet booth. <words>177</words>
It was an odd decoration for a place of polished brass and steam: a sprawling, petrified coral reef. <words>195</words>
As his thumb brushed over a sharp, porous ridge, the texture snagged his skin and his memory all at once. <words>214</words>
He was suddenly back on the shores of the Azure Maw, a boy, standing beside a girl with eyes the color of the deep. <words>237</words>
They had found a gauntlet then, too, washed ashore among the living coral, and swore an oath not of enmity, but of protection. <words>261</words>
He had to remember the promise, not the betrayal that followed. <words>273</words>
The memory was the key, the one trick that might actually work. <words>286</words>
A chime echoed through the lounge, signaling an incoming call on the house pneumo-tube system. <words>301</words>
Just then, the lounge doors swung open, and Elara entered, her face a mask of weary duty. <words>318</words>
She saw him and her posture stiffened, her hand instinctively moving to the chronometer on her wrist. <words>335</words>
Kael didn't reach for his deck of cards or his disappearing coins. <words>347</words>
Instead, he slowly pulled the rusted knight’s gauntlet from his bag and placed it on the table between them. <words>366</words>
He met her gaze, his own reflecting a desperate, coded plea for a truce he couldn't speak aloud. <words>383</words>
"The tide is low at the Azure Maw," he said, his voice quiet but clear over the hiss of the gears. <words>402</words>
It was the phrase they had used as children, a signal that it was safe to explore the reefs together. <words>422</words>
Elara’s mask cracked, a flicker of the girl he remembered surfacing in her guarded eyes. <words>437</words>
Her hand left her chronometer, hovering for a moment before slowly, tentatively, reaching for the gauntlet. <words>454</words>
The trust was not yet whole, but in the space between calls, a seed of it had been planted anew. <words>474</words>
