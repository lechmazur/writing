The last bell of the echoing hour had long since faded, yet its ghost still shivered in Kael’s bones. <17>
He stood within the skeletal remains of a collapsed cathedral, a place where shattered stained glass now competed with the vibrant spray-painted murals of street artists. <39>
His hands trembled, a persistent tremor that had plagued him since the job that broke him, a stark reminder of why he was no longer a mercenary but a man haunted. <66>
He was here to make peace with that past, a desperate pilgrimage guided only by whispers. <81>
The lead had come through improbable rumor chains: a disgraced historian in a dockside tavern, a child selling scavenged relics, a graffiti artist who signed their work with a cryptic sigil. <112>
Each story pointed to this haven, to a figure known only as the Curator who supposedly held fragments of lost time. <133>
Kael’s approach was carefully reckless; he moved with the practiced silence of his old life but his heart hammered with the hope of a fool. <159>
He found her near the ruined apse, a woman with paint-stained fingers sitting before a small, velvet-draped table. <178>
She didn't look up as he approached, her focus entirely on the object she was polishing. <193>
It was a chunk of amber, the size of his fist, and inside, a spider was trapped forever in its final, desperate lunge. <215>
"You're the one who's been asking," she said, her voice soft as dust. <226>
Kael could only nod, his throat tight with an improbable longing so fierce it was a physical ache. <242>
That amber, that spider—it was his brother’s, the only thing he’d carried on their last mission together. <261>
He’d thought it lost in the fire and the screaming, a piece of his history he could never reclaim. <281>
"I heard it called to its owner," the Curator murmured, pushing it across the velvet. <296>
"They say some things want to be found." <304>
Kael reached out with his shaky hand, his fingers brushing against the smooth, ancient resin. <319>
He had come searching for the unknown, for some sign or absolution he couldn't name. <334>
He hadn't known it would be this, a tangible piece of the moment that had shattered him. <351>
The rumors, the journey, the risk—it all coalesced into this single, quiet transaction. <365>
He placed a small, heavy pouch of coins on the table, enough to buy a legend. <380>
"I need to finalize this," he whispered, more to himself than to her. <393>
Picking up the amber, he felt its impossible warmth seep into his palm, a connection across time. <410>
The trembling in his hand didn't stop, but for the first time in years, it felt less like a tremor of fear and more like the vibration of a held note, finally finding its peace. <445>
