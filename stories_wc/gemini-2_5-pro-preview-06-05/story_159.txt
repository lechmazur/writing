The man who called himself the philosopher-king lived within the winding, sun-baked walls of the sandstone labyrinth. <16>
Floating lanterns, remnants of a forgotten magic he once commanded, drifted along its high corridors, their light a constant, silent reminder of all he had lost. <39>
His singular motivation was to puzzle out a labyrinth once thought unsolvable, a task he pursued with a peculiar devotion. <57>
He achieved this through confetti-coded proposals at the random weddings that sought the labyrinth’s romantic mystique for their ceremonies. <77>
His manner was earnestly frivolous, a perfect disguise for a mind dissecting the grandest of enigmas while appearing to be a harmless madman. <99>
The labyrinth was his life now, a direct result of a transformative betrayal by his own brother, the new king. <118>
His brother hadn't just banished him; he had locked the kingdom’s esoteric knowledge into the very architecture of this maze, a final, maddening challenge. <142>
Alistair’s only key was a weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its mirrored chamber filled not with colored glass, but with dust from every corner of his prison. <167>
He watched now as a new couple stood before an officiant, their soft voices echoing off the warm stone. <185>
The formal readings began, a quiet moment of pledged vows that created the perfect stillness he required for his work. <205>
He clutched a handful of meticulously prepared paper squares, the confetti’s colors and shapes forming a complex question. <224>
With a joyful shout that startled the guests, he rushed forward, his tattered robes flowing behind him like a forgotten royal standard. <245>
He tossed the confetti high, a shimmering cascade that caught the lantern light and showered the bewildered couple. <262>
Then, as the paper rained down, he did not kneel to propose but instead chose to extend his hand toward a specific glyph on the wall. <287>
The glyph, illuminated by a precise pattern of reflected light from the falling confetti, seemed to shimmer in response. <306>
He raised the kaleidoscope to his eye, ignoring the gasps of the wedding party as he focused on the activated glyph. <327>
They saw a beggar playing with a toy; he saw the universe recalibrate. <338>
He retreated into the shadows, the couple’s confused laughter following him as a new pattern resolved itself within the kaleidoscope’s depths. <359>
The swirling dust formed a clear image: his brother’s face, not with malice, but with a sad, desperate hope. <378>
The code was not a lock, but a lesson. <386>
The betrayal was not an ending, but an invitation to a higher form of thought, a transformation he was meant to undergo. <406>
He had to be broken to be remade, and this labyrinth was the crucible. <419>
Alistair smiled, a look of complex simplicity on his face, and settled back into the shadows to await the next readings. <439>
