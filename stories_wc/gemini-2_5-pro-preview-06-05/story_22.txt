Elara clutched the stolen museum artifact tag, its laminated plastic feeling absurdly mundane against the humming air of the portal-strewn canyon. <words>23</words>
"Item 734: Altar of Perpetual Supplication," she read aloud with a mocking sincerity, her voice a dry, academic whisper meant for the silent watchers she knew were hidden among the ancient carvings. <words>56</words>
For generations, they had overseen this place, this grand machine for harvesting grace from the hopeful souls who stumbled through the shimmering gateways. <words>82</words>
It was a perfectly flawed system, designed by beings of immense power who, according to the tag's microscopic annotations, possessed a comically human weakness. <words>111</words>
Her motivation was simple, a quiet librarian's vanity writ large: to become a legend whispered through time, the one who broke the gods' favorite toy. <words>142</words>
She wasn't a warrior with a magic sword; she was a researcher with a secret. <words>156</words>
That secret, gleaned from cross-referencing the tag's data with a thousand-year-old dietary scroll she'd "borrowed," was a shared love for a particular type of food. <words>186</words>
From her satchel, she pulled out a small, sticky honeycake, baked from a recipe she'd painstakingly translated from the canyon walls themselves. <words>214</words>
The watchers considered the offering of these cakes the highest form of worship, a tradition they themselves had started and forgotten the reason for. <words>243</words>
They never realized the specific density of the thrice-sifted flour and the precise crystallization of the sun-blossom honey acted as a resonant catalyst, a key made of sugar and grain. <words>281</words>
With the reverence of a priestess and the smirk of a vandal, she approached the central altar, a shimmering lattice of captured light. <words>308</words>
Her singular task was to dismantle this divine engine not with force, but with flavor. <words>323</words>
She crumbled the cake onto the altar's glowing core. <words>332</words>
For a moment, nothing happened, and the silence in the canyon felt heavy with judgment. <words>346</words>
Then, a low hum turned into a discordant shriek as the delicate frequencies holding the grace captive were irrevocably corrupted by the mundane chemistry of the pastry. <words>378</words>
The lattice flickered, fractured, and then dissolved into a billion motes of harmless, liberated energy that drifted up towards the canyon rim like fireflies. <words>408</words>
The watchers remained silent, but their stillness now felt less like vigilance and more like shock. <words>425</words>
Elara brushed the last of the crumbs from her fingers, her face a perfect mask of solemnity. <words>442</words>
"Such a shame," she whispered to the empty air, "to lose such a beautiful piece." <words>456</words>
Her legend had begun, not with a bang, but with the sweet, sticky scent of a well-baked lie. <words>475</words>
