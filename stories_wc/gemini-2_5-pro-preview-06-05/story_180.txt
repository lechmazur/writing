Elian, a conjurer steeped in a quiet, lingering remorse, surveyed his domain. <words>12</words>
It was a sunken orchard greenhouse, a glass bubble on the seafloor ringed by the skeletal remains of ancient shipwrecks. <words>29</words>
His singular motivation, a goal pursued with the most indifferent enthusiasm, was to rediscover the wild frontier of his mind. <words>48</words>
For decades, he had scoured the surface world, haunting the periphery of civilization throughout yard sales for the necessary components. <words>67</words>
He had gathered salt-shakers, chipped teacups, and tarnished silver, each an anchor for a forgotten sliver of magic. <words>84</words>
Today, he finally held the capstone of his collection: an antique brass microscope, its surface holding the ghost of a touch from long ago. <words>109</words>
The whole endeavor was obviously mysterious, a ritual of his own design to undo a self-inflicted wound. <words>126</words>
Long ago, terrified by the sheer, untamable power of a shared wisdom he’d tapped into, he had sealed the gates of his own imagination. <words>151</words>
Now, he intended to reverse the process, to gently dampen the magical barricades he had so foolishly erected. <words>169</words>
He placed the microscope on a workbench fashioned from a galleon’s mast, its polished lens aimed at nothing. <words>188</words>
From his sleeve, he produced the final tool, a single knitting needle made of bone, its tip honed to a razor’s point. <words>210</words>
He dipped the needle into a vial of shimmering, viscous fluid, a concoction of bioluminescent algae and regret. <words>229</words>
The air grew thick and still, the water pressure outside seeming to intensify with the gravity of the moment. <words>247</words>
His task was not one of force, but of connection, a delicate and precise reconciliation with his past. <words>265</words>
He had to dampen the ward by matching the swirl of fingerprints on the antique microscope. <words>281</words>
Leaning close, he could just make out the faint, oily whorls left by his mentor, the one who had first shown him the meaning of shared wisdom. <words>310</words>
With a steady hand, Elian used the needle’s tip to trace a thin, glowing line of his own fingerprint directly over his mentor’s faded mark. <words>337</words>
The patterns merged, the old and the new, the student and the master, locking into place with a soft, resonant hum. <words>359</words>
A tremor ran through the greenhouse, not of violence, but of release, as if a great tension had been eased. <words>379</words>
The suffocating ward in his mind did not shatter but began to dissolve, its harsh edges turning to mist. <words>399</words>
Colors seemed brighter, the gentle sway of the sea kelp outside more profound, and a forgotten melody surfaced in his thoughts. <words>421</words>
He felt a flicker of something, a nascent idea that was both terrifying and exhilarating, the first true sign of the wild frontier. <words>444</words>
Elian straightened up, placing the knitting needle down with a quiet click, his expression unchanged but his inner world irrevocably altered. <words>467</words>
The shipwrecks remained, but now they looked less like tombstones and more like signposts on a long journey home. <words>488</words>
