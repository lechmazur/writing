The lingering minstrel played a tune no one heard, his lute a speck of wood in the cavernous din of the giant's dining room. <words>23</words> It was rush hour, and the titans boomed and feasted, their cutlery clanging like the hammers of a dozen forges. <words>42</words> He was an openly private fixture here, his melodies a constant, ignored hum, while his soul quietly plotted its departure from this mundane existence. <words>68</words> For years he had performed, a living ornament whose only purpose was to be background noise, a soundtrack to gargantuan digestion. <words>89</words> But tonight, clutched in his tunic, was the key: a witch’s gnarled wooden ladle, stolen from her simmering hut a lifetime ago. <words>112</words> His target sat in the center of the colossal table, a centerpiece mistaken for a lump of basalt but known to him as a fallen star. <words>140</words> The gentle turmoil in his chest mirrored the chaos of the room as he slipped from his stool, a mote of dust moving with intent. <words>165</words> No one saw him scurry across the vast, food-strewn expanse of the table, his small feet navigating hills of spilled gravy and forests of parsley. <words>192</words> He reached the meteorite, its surface a universe of tiny, sharp-edged craters and smooth, cool valleys. <words>210</words> This was the method whispered in the witch’s grimoire, a way to rejuvenate not the body, but the will. <words>230</words> With a trembling hand, he drew the gnarled ladle, its dark wood seeming to drink the chaotic light of the hall. <words>250</words> He pressed the ladle’s warped bowl against the pitted stone, tracing the texture of the meteorite’s surface as if reading a sacred map. <words>273</words> A current, silent and profound, flowed up the wood and into his arm, a shock of pure potential that scoured the weariness from his spirit. <words>301</words> It was not a loud magic, but a deep, resonant hum that settled in his bones, a private symphony drowning out the giants’ cacophony. <words>326</words> He felt the rust of his repetitive life flake away, replaced by the sharp, clear desire for the unknown road. <words>348</words> The giants continued their meal, their booming laughter and arguments shaking the very air he breathed. <words>364</words> They had not seen his pilgrimage, nor felt the shift in the room’s smallest occupant. <words>379</words> Their complete, thundering ignorance was the final, perfect ingredient for his transformation. <words>391</words> His escape was now real, a tangible thing he could taste, and his choice was affirmed by silence. <words>409</words> He turned from the meteorite, the ladle now feeling light as a feather in his grip. <words>425</words> The minstrel walked back toward the table’s edge, no longer lingering, but merely waiting for the precise moment to descend into a new world. <words>451</words>
