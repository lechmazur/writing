Kael, the last summoner, drifted through the shared dream recording studio, a place still humming with echoes after the last breath of a dying god. <25>
He cared for very little in the quieted world, yet he still polished the rustic coffee grinder he used not for beans, but for crystallized sorrows. <50>
His singular, nagging purpose was to somehow rebuild the world’s coral reefs, now just bone-white graveyards in the sea. <70>
He was enthusiastically lazy, a firm believer in the river wisdom that taught the greatest force finds the easiest path, and he intended to exert the absolute minimum effort required. <105>
This path led him here, to a deserted hall within the dreamscape where rows of empty, gilded frames hung like open mouths. <129>
Kael unlatched the grinder, dropping in a single, shimmering shard of the dead god’s final memory—a longing for the vibrant sea life it had created. <156>
He turned the crank with a practiced slowness, the device grinding the memory not into powder, but into a fragrant, luminous mist. <179>
With a sigh that was the peak of his exertion, he guided the mist toward the first empty frame. <200>
It swirled and settled, creating a perfect, shimmering image of the first cyanobacteria blooming in primordial waters. <218>
He had to match the sequence, the causal chain of divine thought that had once sustained the reefs. <236>
Another memory, a dream of symbiosis, was ground and carefully puffed into a second frame, which now held the image of a polyp finding its algal partner. <265>
The work was precise, demanding a focus that felt like the gentle sharpness of a scalpel slicing through water. <286>
He moved down the long hall, grinding memories of sunlight, of currents, of the planet’s first great branching of life, filling each corresponding void. <315>
It was a tedious puzzle, but it was a single task, and therefore preferable to a thousand smaller, more active ones. <337>
When the final frame was filled with an image of the god’s own satisfaction, a low hum vibrated through the floor. <359>
The entire geometric arrangement of the hall began to unfold. <369>
The walls became vast, flat planes, the frames turning into glowing nodes on a sprawling, spectral blueprint. <387>
This was the core schematic for life’s most creative endeavor, the silent architecture of the reef now laid bare and reactivated. <409>
A gentle, life-giving pulse emanated from the pattern, a wave of potential that would wash over the sleeping world and seed the dead coral with new promise. <438>
Kael watched the energy flow out of the dream studio and into the waking reality, his job now complete. <458>
He could finally get some rest. <464>
