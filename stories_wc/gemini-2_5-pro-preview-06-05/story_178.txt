Elara, a clerk for the Coral Plateau Hydro-Archives, felt the pressure of the ocean in her bones. <words>16</words>
It was a constant, crushing reminder of her sister's illness, the creeping bioluminescent decay they called The Bloom. <words>32</words>
Her only hope lay in a theory whispered to her during a disastrously low-scoring trivia night at The Barnacle. <words>49</words>
A disgraced physicist, smelling of brine and fermented kelp, had spoken of a reality that was absolutely relative, a multiverse of potential cures accessible to those who knew how to look. <words>81</words>
"You must quantize the possibilities," he had slurred, tapping a rheumy eye, "Find a focus from the Old World." <words>101</words>
So now, in the dissonant calm of the undersea greenhouse, surrounded by glowing anemone-orchids and gently swaying sea-ferns, Elara knelt before her inheritance. <words>128</words>
It was her great-grandfather's vintage stamp collection, a priceless, nonsensical treasure in a world without mail or a surface to send it to. <words>154</words>
Each fragile square of paper, preserved in a vacuum-sealed album, was a window into a world that no longer existed. <words>175</words>
She ignored the faded portraits of forgotten kings and the renderings of primitive airships, her fingers stopping on a stamp depicting a simple, six-petaled white flower: *Echinacea purpurea*. <words>207</words>
The physicist had said the key was belief, a focused collapse of the waveform into a single, desired outcome. <words>228</words>
Elara closed her eyes, the image of the flower burned into her mind, a symbol of a world with different rules, different medicines. <words>252</words>
She drew a slow, deep breath, the re-circulated air tasting of salt and ozone, and held it. <words>269</words>
In the ephemeral pause of that breath, she began to weave. <words>279</words>
She pictured the greenhouse not as it was, but as it could be, a single variable shifting in the cosmic equation. <words>301</words>
She pushed her will into the silent, pressurized space, seeking to quantize the infinite chaos into one specific, tangible change. <words>323</words>
The world flickered behind her eyelids, a kaleidoscope of shimmering greens and impossible blues, the very fabric of her reality stretching thin. <words>346</words>
It was a moment of pure, terrifying potential, a state both here and not-here, real and unreal. <words>364</words>
Then, her lungs screamed for air and she gasped, her eyes flying open. <words>376</words>
The greenhouse was the same, the light from the abyssal trench filtering through the reinforced dome in the same ethereal way. <words>399</words>
But there, in a previously empty nutrient bed, a single, pale sprout was pushing its way through the synthetic soil. <words>421</words>
It was small and impossibly fragile, yet it was undeniably new, a tiny anchor to another world. <words>438</words>
A strange, unfamiliar calm settled over Elara, a feeling that was not peace, but the quiet, determined start of a cure. <words>460</words>
Her sister was still sick, the ocean was still pressing in, but reality, she now knew, was negotiable. <words>480</words>
