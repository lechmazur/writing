The sleepy nomad, whose name was only a whisper of wind, felt the trail dissolve beneath his worn boots. <words>17</words> He was perpetually tired, a side effect of his quest to blaze a trail not through mountains, but through the intangible limits of perception. <words>38</words> A chance encounter was all he hoped for, some sign he was still moving forward, but getting lost was a frustratingly mundane detour. <words>61</words> Then he saw it: a door of seamless gray rock, slightly ajar, humming with a low, synthetic thrum. <words>79</words>

He pushed it open and stepped from ancient forest into a secret agent disguise room, a sterile chamber lined with faces on mannequins and gadgets in glass cases. <words>109</words> Two figures stood in the center, a man and a woman, wrapped in the heavy hush that falls as two longtime friends part ways for good. <words>135</words> They didn't seem to notice him, their private silence a world unto itself. <words>149</words> The nomad’s gaze, however, was pulled to a corner where an impossible object rested: a circus strongman’s broken barbells, the thick steel snapped like a twig. <words>179</words>

The man finally spoke, his voice rough. <words>186</words> “He called himself the Colossus.” <words>191</words> He gestured to the fractured weight. <words>197</words> “He thought his strength made him a god, that no one could touch him.” <words>211</words> This was the story of the downfall of arrogance, told in a place dedicated to the art of the masquerade. <words>232</words> “I wanted to fight him, to meet force with force,” the man continued, looking at the woman. <words>249</words> “But you knew better.” <words>254</words>

The woman turned, her eyes finally acknowledging the nomad. <words>263</words> “Strength isn’t a muscle,” she said, her tone one of profound, fantasy practicality. <words>277</words> “It’s a belief.” <words>281</words> “We didn’t break him; we just broke his belief in his own power, and the steel followed.” <words>299</words> The barbells were spiritually material, an artifact imbued with the ghost of a shattered ego. <words>314</words> She walked to a wall of blank, white masks and took one down, holding it out to the nomad. <words>334</words> “You seek to pass through limits,” she stated, not asked. <words>344</words> “Don’t try to smash the wall.” <words>351</words> “Wear a new face and convince the wall it was never there.” <words>363</words>

The nomad took the smooth, cool mask, a tool more potent than any map. <words>377</words> He understood that his journey required not a warrior’s energy but a spy’s subtlety. <words>392</words> He gave a slow, grateful nod, leaving the two agents to the final, quiet moments of their shared history. <words>411</words> Stepping back onto the trail, the path ahead seemed clearer, and for the first time in a long time, he didn't feel so sleepy. <words>436</words> He felt awake. <words>439</words>
