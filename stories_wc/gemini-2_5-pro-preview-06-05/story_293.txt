Elian, the minstrel, plucked a final, hollow chord on his lute, the sound swallowed by the damp, pulsing glow of Lumina, the bacteria-powered city. <words>23</words>
The crowd roared with a cautious revelry, their faces lit in shifting shades of phosphorescent green and blue, but his smile was a mask he wore as skillfully as his patched cloak. <words>54</words>
He was rarely sincere, for his heart was not in these vapid tunes but in the secret thrumming in his chest, a rhythm that matched the flickering of the single candle in his high garret. <words>90</words>
Slipping through an alley that smelled of ozone and wet soil, he reached his sanctuary just as the first celebratory energy surge made the city's veins of algae blaze. <words>124</words>
Inside, the lonely candle flame danced, a fragile timer counting down the last moments of his ordinary life. <words>143</words>
His motivation was a desperate need to find purpose in a world of beautiful, glowing uncertainty, a world he no longer felt a part of. <words>171</words>
From beneath a loose floorboard, he retrieved the object of his obsession: a crumpled photograph of a dark coastline under a sky impossibly full of stars. <words>203</words>
It was his map and his mantra, the promise of escaping the ordinary hum of the city's microbial heart. <words>224</words>
His hands, usually so nimble on the fretboard, trembled as he unrolled a small, tightly bound sail made of woven spider-silk and solar film. <words>253</words>
This was his vessel, his singular hope, and the moment had come to deploy it. <words>268</words>
He worked quickly, rigging the sail to a small, kite-like frame on his narrow balcony, the revelry below a distant, meaningless chorus. <words>294</words>
His true guide was not the city's light but the celestial map he had memorized, a complex method of navigation learned from a forbidden book. <words>325</words>
He would escape by following star patterns unseen by the light-polluted denizens below. <words>341</words>
The wind, a thermal updraft from the city's core, caught the delicate structure, pulling it taut with a soft snap. <words>362</words>
With a final, fearful glance at the photograph, he clipped himself into the harness, his nervous energy finally transmuting into action. <words>387</words>
He stepped off the ledge into the night, the sail catching the updraft and lifting him above the glowing, organic metropolis. <words>412</words>
Below, in his now-empty room, the lonely candle flame sputtered, fought for a final second, and guttered out into darkness. <words>436</words>
Elian was already gone, a tiny speck ascending toward the true lights, his insincere life extinguished with the flame. <words>457</words>
