The old hermit, Silas, glared at the sputtering aqueduct, a masterpiece of failure he had inherited. <words>15</words>
"You'd think after seventy years, one of us would give up," he muttered to a particularly vibrant patch of phosphorescent moss. <words>34</words>
His only company in the cavern cathedral was the glowing flora and the maddening drip that was supposed to be a torrent. <words>54</words>
Restoring the water systems was less a noble calling and more a long-form, existential joke whose punchline was dehydration. <words>73</words>
He fiddled with a pair of blunt scissors, their edges worn smooth from decades of snipping nutrient-rich fungi for his experiments. <words>94</words>
They were terrible for cutting, but strangely effective for grinding the delicate spore casings he needed. <words>111</words>
Suddenly, a sound echoed through the immense cavern, a chime so alien he almost didn't recognize it. <words>128</words>
The ancient elevator, a relic from the Builders, had arrived, its bronze doors sighing open onto his empty, forgotten floor. <words>149</words>
For a full minute, Silas just stared, his heart a frantic drum against the vast silence. <words>165</words>
No one came out. <words>170</words>
Of course not. <words>173</words>
"Right on time for the grand finale, then," he sighed, a grim smile touching his lips. <words>188</words>
The arrival was the final component, the trigger he'd been waiting for. <words>200</words>
From a dusty alcove, he retrieved his magnum opus: a small, perfectly preserved loaf of bread. <words>217</words>
The scent of yeast and grain, a ghost from another world, filled his small workspace. <words>232</words>
His theory was absurd, born from the kind of logic that only profound isolation can produce. <words>248</words>
The unique biome of the cavern, he'd discovered, responded to complex organic compounds. <words>262</words>
He needed to amplify that response, to kickstart the entire filtration network embedded in the luminous roots. <words>280</words>
His chosen method was via the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, or at least, the ghost of one. <words>301</words>
Using the blunt scissor, he carefully grated the crust into a fine powder over the central nerve cluster of the glowing flora. <words>324</words>
The powder settled onto the pulsating membrane, and the cavern's light flickered. <words>336</words>
He then placed the rest of the loaf inside the empty elevator car, propping the door open with a rock. <words>357</words>
The elevator shaft would act as a chimney, a colossal vent to amplify the aroma through the entire system. <words>377</words>
It was a plan held together by hope and sheer, unadulterated madness. <words>389</words>
For a moment, nothing happened, and a familiar despair settled in his gut. <words>402</words>
Then, a low hum began, and the phosphorescent plants brightened, their light shifting from a gentle green to a vibrant, electric blue. <words>425</words>
A soft, steady trickle of water began to flow from the aqueduct's spout, growing stronger, clearer. <words>442</words>
It worked. <words>444</words>
His ridiculous, bread-based solution had actually worked. <words>452</words>
Silas leaned against a glowing pillar, listening to the life-giving sound, utterly, completely alone with his victory. <words>469</words>
"Well," he said to the empty elevator, "I suppose a toast is in order." <words>483</words>
He picked up a crumb from the floor, popped it in his mouth, and chewed thoughtfully. <words>498</words>
