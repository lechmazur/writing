Elara, an insomniac painter, dabbed another chipper grin onto the canvas, the expression feeling like a lie. <words>16</words>
Her arboreal workshop, suspended between the caps of giant, phosphorescent mushrooms, was a testament to the peacefully chaotic state of her mind. <words>37</words>
Paint-splattered jars and half-finished portraits cluttered every surface, all watched over by a tapered wizardâ€™s hat perched on a wooden mannequin. <words>61</words>
A single, neat bullet hole pierced its brim, a stark reminder of the magic that was and the price that was paid. <words>84</words>
Tonight, the sleeplessness was a gnawing thing, a familiar beast demanding to be fed. <words>98</words>
With a sigh that tasted of frolicsome regret, she abandoned her work on the painted smiles. <words>114</words>
She knew she had to outlast the final obstacle, the one that kept sleep forever at bay. <words>131</words>
Stepping onto the balcony, she found the midnight rain had left shimmering gifts upon the fungal canopy below. <words>149</words>
This was her method, her strange and secret art. <words>159</words>
Kneeling, she stared into the largest puddle, her reflection wavering as she began to scry. <words>176</words>
The water swirled, not with moonlight, but with the hush of an empty classroom at first light. <words>194</words>
Dust motes danced in the slanted sunbeams, illuminating rows of vacant desks and a chalkboard ghosted with equations. <words>214</words>
It was the memory of him, the wizard of that hat, the teacher who had taught her that all magic required sacrifice. <words>236</words>
He had smiled just like her portraits before he faced the gunman at the schoolhouse door, a final, defiant lesson. <words>257</words>
This vision was the last echo, the final chain. <words>266</words>
Elara focused, her will reaching into the scryed puddle not just to see, but to devour. <words>282</words>
She consumed the silence, the lingering scent of chalk dust, the painful glint of morning on polished wood. <words>299</words>
She devoured the ghost of his laughter and the sharp, terrible crack that had followed it. <words>315</words>
The memory fought back, a phantom ache in her chest, but she pulled it all in, metabolizing the sorrow into strength. <words>337</words>
It was a feast of grief, a banquet of what-ifs, and she left not a single crumb of the past behind. <words>358</words>
When the puddle was just a puddle again, reflecting only her own tired face, a profound stillness settled over her. <words>378</words>
The chaos of her workshop no longer felt like a battleground, but a garden. <words>392</words>
Returning to her easel, she picked up a fine brush, dipped it in cerulean blue, and painted a single, perfect tear rolling from the eye of the widest smile. <words>423</words>
It wasn't a mark of sadness, but of release, a final, fond farewell. <words>436</words>
Behind the painted smiles, there was now peace. <words>444</words>
Elara felt a drowsiness she hadn't known in years, a gentle pulling toward her cot in the corner. <words>462</words>
The obstacle was gone. <words>466</words>
She had finally won. <words>470</words>
