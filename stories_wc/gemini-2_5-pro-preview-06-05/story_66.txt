Elias, the quiet deserter, tended to the silent foliage of the plant communication study. <words>14</words>
His only companion was the cracked mirror on the wall, which splintered his reflection into a dozen men he no longer was. <words>32</words>
He was searching for a place to truly belong, even if that place was ultimately nowhere. <words>46</words>
His days passed throughout jigsaw puzzles, each finished landscape of cardboard marking another phase of his true work: reconstructing stories from shattered porcelain masks. <words>71</words>
He’d fled his regiment with a sack of them, the faces of command, and now pieced them together with a focus that was dizzyingly grounded. <words>97</words>
Each reassembled mask told a tale of duty and loss, a repeating tragedy he had to understand to escape. <words>117</words>
It was an act of noble foolishness, this meticulous curation of a past he intended to destroy. <words>133</words>
The listening figs and whispering ferns seemed to approve, their subtle bio-signals a hum of encouragement in the sterile lab. <words>154</words>
He would glue a shard of a stoic captain’s cheek, then spend an hour on a 500-piece puzzle of a tranquil lake, the two tasks bleeding into one another. <words>183</words>
This strange ritual was his method for breaking the cycle, for seeing the whole pattern of his former life laid bare. <words>204</words>
He needed to see the faces of his history whole one last time before he could unmake them forever. <words>222</words>
Finally, the last mask was complete, its ceramic sneer a perfect replica of the one that had sent him on his final, failed mission. <words>245</words>
The last jigsaw puzzle, a chaotic supernova, was also finished on the table beside it. <words>261</words>
His history was now a complete, monstrous collection. <words>269</words>
He carried the dozen reconstructed masks out into the greenhouse’s central atrium, where the sun beat down through the glass panes. <words>291</words>
He arranged them in a circle on the stone floor, a silent council of ghosts. <words>305</words>
Using the cracked mirror, he angled a beam of concentrated sunlight onto the driest, most delicate mask. <words>324</words>
Slowly, a dark spot appeared on the white porcelain. <words>333</words>
He held his position, his own face a mask of concentration, until the heat began to carbonize the painted-on smile. <words>353</words>
The blackness spread, a creeping void consuming the captain, the sergeant, the grunt, and all the other roles he was forced to play. <words>376</words>
One by one, he focused the light, turning each story, each identity, each piece of the wretched cycle into blackened, brittle charcoal. <words>399</words>
When only dust and scorched stone remained, Elias felt the dizzying sensation cease, replaced by a profound quiet. <words>418</words>
He was a man who belonged to nowhere, and for the first time, that felt like home. <words>433</words>
