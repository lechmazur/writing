Sir Kaelan, a knight whose prudence was his finest armor, sat on a bench of polished obsidian within the grand Knossos Terminus. <words>21</words>
Throngs of evening commuters flowed around him like a river, their faces weary and grey under the soft glow of downward-tapering columns. <words>42</words>
Yet, a mysteriously cheerful smile played on Kaelan’s lips, a small, bright anomaly in the familiar unknown of the station. <words>63</words>
His focus was not on the crowd, but on the sheaf of brittle, secondhand letters resting in his lap, their purpose to help him trace an unknown ancestry. <words>91</words>
They were held together by a single, loose binder ring, a fragile clasp for the guarded secrets of his bloodline. <words>111</words>
For months, he had dedicated his commute to this singular task: to understand. <words>124</words>
He sought comprehension not with a sword, but via cryptic patterns he believed were hidden within the faded ink. <words>144</words>
The letters spoke of harvests and heartaches, but beneath the mundane script, Kaelan saw a cipher in the spacing of the words and the choice of punctuation. <words>174</words>
Tonight, the metallic scent of the transit rails and the murmur of distant arrivals seemed to sharpen his senses. <words>193</words>
His thumb nudged the loose binder ring, and with a soft click, it sprang open, spilling the pages onto his knees. <words>215</words>
As he gathered them, a frustration he rarely allowed himself pricked at his composure. <words>229</words>
He reordered the pages not by their dates, but by the watermarks he had painstakingly catalogued—a bull's head, a double axe, a serpent. <words>255</words>
Suddenly, the cheerfulness on his face was no longer mysterious, but incandescent. <words>268</words>
The patterns had shifted, re-aligned by the new sequence. <words>278</words>
It was not a code hidden within each letter, but a map formed across them. <words>292</words>
The seemingly random inkblots, when viewed through the correctly layered pages, formed a constellation. <words>308</words>
A constellation he recognized from the sole heirloom of his infancy: a small, silver pendant he wore beneath his tunic. <words>329</words>
The guarded secrets were not in what the letters said, but in what they collectively showed. <words>345</words>
He finally began to understand the path he was meant to follow, a route away from this reimagined palace and towards an authentic past. <words>371</words>
The name of the constellation, whispered to him by his adoptive father years ago, was Lyra. <words>387</words>
He carefully threaded the letters back onto the binder ring, its looseness no longer a flaw but a feature that had permitted this discovery. <words>415</words>
Snapping it shut, the prudent knight stood, his smile now one of genuine certainty. <words>431</words>
His commute was over, but his journey had just begun. <words>443</words>
