Kael sat cross-legged on the floor of the moth observation tower, the city below a nervous system of flickering lights after the unexpected outage. <24>
He was supposed to be learning meditation techniques, a way to find stillness amid the chaos. <38>
His instructor’s voice, a calm drone from a small radio, spoke of balancing inside storms. <52>
But Kael, a fiercely loyal scout, wasn't listening to the instructor; he was listening to the static between the guided breaths, the space where the real broadcast lived. <79>
A comedian’s voice crackled through, telling a joke about a three-legged dog walking into a saloon. <95>
It was coded nonsense, of course, a sophisticated method to radicalize the faithful. <108>
He opened his bullet journal, his fingers tracing the familiar engraving on its leather cover: a stylized lunar moth with a single, unblinking eye. <133>
The comedian’s punchline landed— "The bartender says, ‘We don’t serve your kind,’ and the dog says, ‘I’m the man who shot your paw!’" <157>
A wave of sanctified dread washed over Kael, cold and pure as baptismal water. <170>
"Shot your paw," not "pa." <175>
P-A-W. <176>
Port Authority West. <179>
His pen scratched the directive onto a fresh page, the ink seeming to bleed into the paper with grim finality. <197>
This was how they did it, hiding revolutionary fire in the hollow spaces of cheap laughter. <213>
Each listener was individually common, just another lonely soul tuning into a late-night show, seeking a moment of levity in the encroaching dark. <236>
But together, guided by the whispers in the static, they were becoming a weapon. <249>
Outside, a thousand moths, their own navigation thrown into chaos by the city’s stuttering glow, beat their powdery wings against the glass. <271>
They were drawn to the tower’s steady, isolated lamp, a single point of reliable light in a world of uncertainty. <291>
Kael watched them, feeling a chilling kinship with their frantic, desperate flight. <302>
The meditation wasn't a lie, not really; it was the only way he could quiet his own mind enough to hear the real message. <325>
It was the tool he used to endure the holy terror of his purpose, to find a precarious balance in the storm of what he was helping to create. <353>
He had to be calm to receive the instructions that would shatter the city’s fragile peace forever. <368>
He closed the journal, the engraved moth seeming to watch him from the dark leather. <381>
The comedian on the radio began another joke, his voice a cheerful harbinger of ruin. <395>
Kael closed his eyes and focused on his breathing, ready to listen, ready to obey. <410>
