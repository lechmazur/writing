Silas sat on a dusty velvet stool in the abandoned circus dressing room, the first hint of morning painting the grimy mirrors in shades of bruised lavender. <words>26</words>
In his hands, he cradled the cracked porcelain doll, its painted smile a little too wide, a little too knowing. <words>46</words>
It had been a gift, of sorts, from a woman with starlight in her eyes, a chance encounter at a planetarium show where she spoke of constellations as cosmic locks and keys. <words>81</words>
She had called him a protector, a title that felt like a brand on his soul, a constant reminder of a duty he had once denied. <words>108</words>
For years he had guarded the doll, this tiny prison, its silence a heavy weight. <words>124</words>
But the woman had also spoken of balance, of a cosmic performance that required every actor to play their part, no matter how terrifying the script. <words>153</words>
He was done being a stagehand hiding in the wings; it was time to step into the spotlight. <words>171</words>
The doll began to hum, a nursery rhyme so suspiciously sweet it made the hairs on his arms stand up. <words>192</words>
It was a playful, dreadful tune, a melody for the end of one thing and the beginning of everything else. <words>213</words>
Around him, the ghosts of the circus seemed to lean in, the scent of phantom popcorn and greasepaint thick in the air. <words>238</words>
They were his audience for this final, mad act. <words>248</words>
Across the hush of dawn’s second breath, when the world held itself perfectly still between shadow and light, Silas knew the moment had come. <words>276</words>
He was not containing this power anymore; he was not protecting the world from it. <words>294</words>
He was finally ready to confront the unknown by becoming its herald. <words>306</words>
With a sense of playful seriousness, as if he were a clown about to perform the greatest trick of all, he placed the doll on a peeling vanity table. <words>338</words>
"Showtime," he whispered, his voice a dry rasp. <words>346</words>
He pressed his thumb into the largest crack running down the doll’s cherubic face, a key turning in a lock made of forgotten lullabies. <words>372</words>
He had to unleash it. <words>377</words>
A light, not of this world, poured from the fissures, smelling of ozone and burnt sugar, casting impossible, dancing shadows that writhed like jubilant acrobats. <words>406</words>
The unknown wasn't a monster or a god; it was pure, unbridled potential, a chaos that giggled as it filled the room. <words>430</words>
Silas watched, his face split by a grin that mirrored the doll's own cracked smile, his torture finally replaced by the thrill of a fate embraced. <words>457</words>
The circus, after all, was back in town. <words>466</words>
