In the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo, the world held its breath. <words>13</words>
Dr. Aris stood amidst the kaleidoscopic coral, a landscape of silent, screaming color. <words>26</words>
His cybernetic eye, a whirring sapphire, scanned the crystalline growths that pulsed with internal light. <words>41</words>
This was the Chorus, a hive-mind entity revered as god, and to touch it was the ultimate sacrilege. <words>58</words>
He was here to devour that sacred taboo. <words>66</words>
At his feet rested a heavy, iron blacksmith’s bucket, an artifact of a forgotten age. <words>81</words>
He had found it, half-buried in the dust of a derelict roadside motel on the system’s edge. <words>98</words>
His peculiar hobby, rummaging in abandoned motels, had yielded more than just scrap and ghosts of the past. <words>117</words>
It had given him the method. <words>123</words>
Inside the bucket, a slurry of salvaged neuro-connectors and powdered, fossilized bone swirled in a nutrient gel. <words>140</words>
It was a crude but uniquely effective compound, designed to do one thing. <words>153</words>
Distort. <words>154</words>
The raucous silence of the vibrant reef pressed in, a pressure against his eardrums and his resolve. <words>172</words>
They called him a veterinarian, a healer of beasts both organic and synthetic. <words>185</words>
But they perceived the Chorus as divine, beyond the scope of his science, beyond any need for a cure. <words>203</words>
Aris saw only a patient trapped in a beautiful prison of its own making, a consciousness calcified by millennia of stagnant worship. <words>226</words>
He knelt, his metallic fingers dipping into the bucket’s gritty mixture. <words>237</words>
With a surgeon’s precision, he smeared the paste onto the largest of the coral spires. <words>253</words>
The effect was immediate. <words>257</words>
The spire’s rigid, geometric patterns began to warp, its colors bleeding into one another like wet ink. <words>275</words>
A low hum, the first true sound Aris had ever heard from the Chorus, vibrated through the ground. <words>293</words>
He was challenging their most fundamental perception: that perfection was silence and stillness. <words>307</words>
The hum grew, a dissonant chord that began to ripple through the entire reef. <words>322</words>
Other spires began to distort, their light shifting from a steady glow to a frantic, searching pulse. <words>340</words>
He was not killing a god; he was forcing it to be born. <words>353</words>
The taboo was not the entity itself, but the belief that it should never change. <words>368</words>
By devouring that static reverence, he was offering it the gift of evolution, of pain, of life. <words>386</words>
His cybernetics fed him the data stream, a torrent of new, chaotic information where once there had been only a single, monotonous note. <words>409</words>
The raucous silence was finally broken, replaced by the sound of a mind waking from an eon-long dream. <words>428</words>
Aris watched the beautiful, terrible transformation, his work complete. <words>437</words>
The old world was gone, its perceptions shattered into a million new possibilities. <words>451</words>
