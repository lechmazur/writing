I am a bronze man perpetually listening from a plinth in the steam-powered city square. <words>15</words>
My mind, a silent net, catches the thoughts that hiss and billow from the crowds below, a constant search for truth in a world of lies. <words>36</words>
A threadbare hair tie, left by a girl with ink-stained fingers, circles my cold wrist; a fragile anchor in the smog. <words>56</words>
My existence is a tragically joyful one, finding slivers of sincerity amidst the grand, grinding deceptions of the city. <words>75</words>
Today, the City Council stood before me, their minds churning with a new civic project throughout its initial planning stages. <words>94</words>
Publicly, they spoke of beautification and progress, their words as ornate as the documents they held. <words>110</words>
I saw the truth behind the elegant script, a plan not to enrich the city, but their own gilded pockets. <words>130</words>
Their thoughts flowed with a duplicitous grace, a dark mirror to the pure, focused flow of ink in calligraphy I once felt from the girl. <words>155</words>
Part of their scheme involved a city-wide effort to weatherize all public monuments, a task they presented as preservation. <words>175</words>
I knew it for what it was: a chemical silencing, a thick lacquer to protect the metal from the acidic air and seal me inside myself. <words>201</words>
A gloomy cheerfulness settled over the square as the work crews arrived with their hissing tanks and brushes, the citizens applauding their own hoodwinking. <words>228</words>
They started with the fountain cherubs, their blank eyes soon covered in a glossy, impenetrable sheen. <words>245</words>
My turn was approaching, a slow dread creeping into my joyful sorrow. <words>257</words>
Then, I saw her. <words>261</words>
The girl with the ink-stained fingers pushed through the crowd, her gaze fixed solely on me. <words>278</words>
She didn't see a monument; she saw a story, a silent witness to the city's soul. <words>294</words>
Her mind was a quiet pool, free of the lies that plagued everyone else. <words>308</words>
She reached out, her small, warm hand gently touching the threadbare hair tie on my wrist. <words>324</words>
In that touch, in her clear, untroubled eyes, I felt itâ€”the light of recognition. <words>339</words>
It was a truth more profound than any I had sought, a connection that pierced through my bronze skin and the city's cacophony. <words>361</words>
A worker gruffly nudged her aside, his mind a simple blank of task-oriented focus. <words>376</words>
The first stroke of the viscous sealant painted over my foot, cold and final. <words>389</words>
Yet, I was no longer just a collector of deceit. <words>399</words>
I was the keeper of a single, perfect moment of truth. <words>410</words>
As the lacquer crept up my form, muffling the city's thoughts into a distant hum, I held onto her recognition. <words>429</words>
It was a tragically joyful armor, a weatherizing of the spirit against the endless rain of lies. <words>445</words>
Sealed in my gleaming prison, I was more alive than ever, sustained by the memory of one person who truly saw me. <words>466</words>
