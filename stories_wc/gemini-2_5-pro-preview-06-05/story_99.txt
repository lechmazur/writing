Elara, a bookbinder by trade and telekinetic by an accident of birth, sat cross-legged on the dusty counter of the abandoned carnival prize booth. <words>23</words>
Her approach to the arcane was strictly casual, more comfortable in worn jeans than ceremonial robes. <words>39</words>
She was here to discover the true power of transformation, a secret she believed was woven across the tapestry of lost legends. <words>61</words>
Her only tool for this grand excavation was a single, crinkled chopstick wrapper she’d found snagged on a splintered floorboard. <words>83</words>
She smoothed it flat with a thought, the paper whispering against the grimy wood. <words>97</words>
The faint, dry rustle was a sound bite that unlocked the first door. <words>109</words>
A sudden flashback threw her into the heart of a forgotten myth. <words>120</words>
She saw a god shaping the first man from river clay, his divine hands chapped and bleeding from the effort. <words>140</words>
The vision vanished, leaving the scent of wet earth and the understanding that creation demanded a piece of the creator. <words>160</words>
This was the price of knowledge she was beginning to chart. <words>171</words>
A gust of wind whistled through a crack in the booth’s wall, a high, mournful keen. <words>187</words>
Another memory, not her own, surged forth: a sorceress weaving a storm to protect her city, her own voice growing hoarse until stolen by the gales she commanded. <words>215</words>
Transformation was not a gift, but a trade. <words>223</words>
Elara looked at the cheap, forgotten prizes lining the shelves—faded plush toys and plastic trinkets, monuments to fleeting joy. <words>245</words>
She had once believed her power was a simple extension of her will, a way to stitch bindings without thread or glue. <words>268</words>
Now she understood it was a debt. <words>274</words>
She focused on the chopstick wrapper again, this flimsy remnant of a world far from this forgotten place. <words>293</words>
With her mind, she began to fold it, not into a simple crane, but into something far more complex. <words>313</words>
Each crease was a sacrifice, a flicker of a personal memory: the taste of her first coffee, the sound of her mother’s laugh, the warmth of a specific summer afternoon. <words>343</words>
These vital pieces of herself flowed into the paper, and with each loss, her control over the object grew with grandiose subtlety. <words>366</words>
The paper began to glow with a soft, internal light. <words>376</words>
She was not merely folding paper; she was attempting to revive the principle itself, to create a focal point for the power she now understood. <words>401</words>
The wrapper trembled, and for a breathtaking second, it unfolded not into a flat sheet, but into a perfect, luminous feather, humming with a life it had never known. <words>432</words>
The feather faded back into a simple, creased wrapper, but the knowledge remained, etched into the new silence of her mind. <words>454</words>
She had discovered transformation's power, and the price was a quiet hollowing she would carry forever. <words>470</words>
