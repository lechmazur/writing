The astute hermit, Bartholomew, chuckled dryly, a sound that echoed strangely in the cavern cathedral. <words>11</words>
The phosphorescent flora pulsed around him, a sickly green parody of daylight. <words>19</words>
At the precise moment the elevator dinged on an empty floor far above, he knew. <words>28</words>
His isolation, strangely effective at amplifying his despair, had reached a new low. <words>37</words>
“Right on schedule,” he muttered, brandishing a blunt scissor like a ceremonial dagger. <words>45</words>
He needed to restore the water systems, a task made monumental by years of neglect and the sheer absurdity of his situation. <words>59</words>
Bartholomew’s motivation wasn’t noble; it was simply that his tea tasted like dust. <words>67</words>
And dust, unlike despair, didn’t pair well with his melancholic musings. <words>75</words>
His plan, however, was strangely effective, if a bit… unconventional. <words>82</words>
He’d discovered that the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, amplified via the cavern’s unique acoustics, could somehow manipulate the ancient, rusted elevator mechanisms. <words>100</words>
It was a long shot, born of desperation and too much time spent sniffing phosphorescent fungi. <words>110</words>
He sliced into the crusty loaf, the blunt scissor surprisingly efficient. <words>117</words>
The aroma, warm and yeasty, began to spread, its comforting familiarity a stark contrast to the cold, damp stone. <words>129</words>
Bartholomew held his breath, listening for the telltale groan of the elevator’s descent. <words>138</words>
Silence. <words>139</words>
Then, a faint whirring. <words>141</words>
He grinned, a flash of despairing humor in his eyes. <words>147</words>
“Works every time,” he whispered, the scent of bread amplifying his hope, however fleeting. <words>156</words>
The elevator lurched to a stop before him, its doors groaning open like a metal maw. <words>166</words>
Inside, not the expected maintenance crew, but a single, wilting potted plant. <words>174</words>
Bartholomew stared at it, the blunt scissor slipping from his grasp. <words>181</words>
“Well,” he sighed, the despairing humor returning. <words>186</words>
“At least it’s not more dust.” <words>189</words>
He picked up the plant, its dry leaves brushing against his hand. <words>196</words>
Perhaps, he thought, a little greenery wouldn't hurt. <words>201</words>
He placed the pot near a patch of glowing moss, the phosphorescent light illuminating its withered leaves. <words>212</words>
The scent of bread, still lingering in the air, seemed to amplify the quiet beauty of the moment. <words>222</words>
He looked up at the empty elevator shaft, a sudden thought striking him. <words>230</words>
Perhaps the isolation wasn't so bad after all. <words>235</words>
Maybe, just maybe, it was strangely effective at amplifying the small joys, too. <words>244</words>
He took another bite of bread, the crust crunching between his teeth. <words>251</words>
The cavern cathedral, alive with its phosphorescent flora, suddenly felt a little less like a prison, and a little more like home. <words>266</words>
He still needed to fix the water systems, though. <words>270</words>
