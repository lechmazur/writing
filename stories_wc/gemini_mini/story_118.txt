The hive-mind therapist, a uniformly peculiar entity composed of shimmering, interconnected particles, hovered near the window of the secret agent training facility. <words>17</words>
Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, a low hum resonated from the entity, a merry bitterness clinging to the sound. <words>32</words>
Its many eyes, each reflecting a different facet of the same consciousness, focused on a scuffed phone charger plug lying abandoned on a training dummy. <words>46</words>
The plug, a mundane object in this high-tech environment, seemed to anchor the ephemeral nature of their mission in a tangible reality. <words>59</words>
Their motivation, to anchor the ephemeral in reality, stemmed from a deep-seated fear of the mission's potential consequences. <words>70</words>
The sound of hindsight, a constant whisper of "what ifs" and "should haves," echoed through the hive-mind's collective consciousness, threatening to drain their resolve. <words>85</words>
To combat this, the therapist began a peculiar ritual. <words>89</words>
A single candle, held aloft by one of the entity's shimmering tendrils, began to drip wax onto the floor. <words>100</words>
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, the hive-mind began to externalize its anxieties. <words>111</words>
Each drop, a solidified moment of doubt, formed a complex pattern on the polished floor. <words>120</words>
The shapes, cryptic and meaningful only to the hive-mind, represented the potential pitfalls of the upcoming mission. <words>132</words>
The dripping continued through the night, a slow, methodical drain of the hive-mind's anxieties. <words>141</words>
The merry bitterness in the entity's hum deepened, tinged with a growing sense of calm. <words>150</words>
As the candle burned low, the wax shapes on the floor formed a complete picture. <words>159</words>
It was a map, not of the physical world, but of the hive-mind's internal landscape. <words>169</words>
By externalizing their fears through this peculiar method, they had charted a course through the treacherous waters of hindsight. <words>181</words>
The scuffed phone charger plug, now surrounded by the solidified wax, became a symbolic anchor, a reminder of the tangible present amidst the swirling currents of doubt. <words>198</words>
The sound of hindsight, though still present, no longer held the same power. <words>206</words>
It had been transformed, through the slow drip of candle wax and the merry bitterness of acceptance, into a guide rather than a tormentor. <words>220</words>
The hive-mind, its anxieties drained and its resolve strengthened, turned from the window, ready to face the bold discovery that awaited them. <words>232</words>
The coded shapes on the floor, a testament to their struggle, remained, a silent monument to the power of confronting the ephemeral through the tangible. <words>247</words>
The scuffed phone charger plug, bathed in the first rays of dawn, seemed to hum with a quiet energy, a symbol of the grounded reality that anchored their extraordinary existence. <words>264</words>
The hive-mind, unified and resolute, stepped forward, the merry bitterness of their journey now a source of strength, not despair. <words>277</words>
They were ready.
