The final siren wailed, leaving a hush thick enough to choke on. <words>11</words>
Detective Harding, eyes bloodshot and tie askew, stood in the Vanishing Point Gallery, a monument to forgotten artists and their even more forgotten art. <words>27</words>
He was confidently unsure, a state of being he’d perfected over years of chasing shadows in this city. <words>37</words>
The looming inevitability of another sleepless night gnawed at him, a familiar hunger. <words>45</words>
He needed to outdance it, to find a rhythm in the chaos. <words>51</words>
He rummaged through his pockets, fingers brushing against a single playing card, the Queen of Spades. <words>60</words>
It was a memento, a bitter joke from a case long gone cold, a memory that clung to him like a shroud. <words>71</words>
He flipped it over, the black ink swirling in his vision like the fleeting images in a half-damaged kaleidoscope. <words>82</words>
“Another masterpiece,” he muttered, his voice dripping with molten sarcasm. <words>88</words>
The gallery, with its stark white walls and echoing emptiness, seemed to mock his weariness. <words>97</words>
The card, a flimsy piece of cardboard, held more weight than all the pretentious sculptures around him. <words>108</words>
It was a portal, a key to a past that refused to stay buried. <words>116</words>
The kaleidoscope of memories spun faster, fragments of faces, whispers of conversations, the metallic tang of blood. <words>128</words>
He saw the victim’s eyes, wide with terror, reflected in the polished floor of the gallery, superimposed over the abstract swirls of a forgotten painting. <words>143</words>
He closed his eyes, trying to grasp the elusive thread that connected the card, the gallery, and the gnawing feeling in his gut. <words>156</words>
The siren’s silence pressed down on him, a tangible weight. <words>162</words>
He opened his eyes, the Queen of Spades still clutched in his hand. <words>169</words>
The impact of memories, he realized, was not a gentle caress, but a brutal assault. <words>178</words>
It distorted the present, blurring the lines between what was and what could have been. <words>188</words>
He needed to break the cycle, to find a way out of this kaleidoscopic nightmare. <words>197</words>
He looked at the card again, the black queen staring back at him, a silent challenge. <words>206</words>
He tucked it away, the smooth cardboard a small comfort against his calloused fingers. <words>215</words>
He had to outdance the inevitability, not by escaping the memories, but by confronting them. <words>225</words>
He had to find the missing piece of the puzzle, the fragment that would make the image whole, even if it shattered him in the process. <words>242</words>
The Vanishing Point Gallery, in its eerie silence, became his battleground. <words>249</words>
The Queen of Spades, his weapon. <words>252</words>
And the fleeting images in his mind, the map. <words>257</words>
He took a deep breath, the hush of the city a prelude to the storm brewing within him. <words>267</words>
He was confidently unsure, but he was ready. <words>271</words>
