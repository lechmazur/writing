The underwater welder, Finn, a man patiently impatient for a life beyond rust and rivets, found himself at the crossing where two timelines should never meet. <words>20</words>
A broken planetarium, now a pulsating nightclub called The Celestial Tear, throbbed with a dissonant symphony of forgotten constellations and synthesized bass. <words>33</words>
He felt the inherited mystery of his lineage, a whisper of improbable power he yearned to wield, tugging at his soul like a deep-sea current. <words>48</words>
Finn’s gaze, drawn by a flicker in the periphery, landed on a vintage store tucked between a holographic fortune teller and a bioluminescent bar. <words>60</words>
He stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams. <words>66</words>
Glimpses in vintage store mirrors revealed fractured reflections, each Finn subtly different, each existing in a timeline that shouldn't intersect with his own. <words>79</words>
He saw himself as a king, a beggar, a phantom, each a potential outcome of choices yet to be made. <words>88</words>
The unraveling had begun. <words>90</words>
On a dusty shelf, nestled amongst chipped porcelain dolls and tarnished silver lockets, sat a vintage button box. <words>101</words>
Mother-of-pearl, obsidian, brass, each button a tiny portal to a forgotten memory, a lost possibility. <words>110</words>
He reached out, his fingers brushing against the cool, smooth surface of a jade button carved in the shape of a crescent moon. <words>121</words>
The nightclub’s music warped, the lights flickered, and the reflections in the mirrors began to swirl and merge. <words>131</words>
He felt a surge of energy, a raw, untamed power coursing through his veins. <words>139</words>
This was it, the power he craved, the key to bending timelines, to rewriting his destiny. <words>148</words>
But the power was volatile, threatening to consume him. <words>153</words>
He needed to control it, to pamper it, to nurture it like a fragile flame. <words>161</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the button box, grounding himself in the tangible reality of its presence. <words>171</words>
Via glimpses in the vintage store mirrors, he watched his fractured reflections coalesce, the king, the beggar, the phantom, merging back into the underwater welder. <words>186</words>
But this wasn't the Finn who had entered the store. <words>190</words>
This Finn was different, his eyes burning with a newfound understanding, his posture radiating an almost unsettling calm. <words>201</words>
He had glimpsed the infinite possibilities that lay before him, the power to shape not only his own destiny but perhaps the destiny of the timelines themselves. <words>217</words>
He opened the button box, his fingers tracing the intricate carvings on each button, each a potential path, each a moment of unraveling waiting to be embraced. <words>232</words>
The Celestial Tear pulsed around him, oblivious to the cosmic shift that had just occurred within its walls. <words>241</words>
Finn smiled, a slow, deliberate smile that held the weight of a thousand lifetimes. <words>248</words>
He had found his power, not in the grand sweep of timelines, but in the intricate details of a vintage button box, a forgotten relic in a forgotten corner of a broken planetarium. <words>267</words>
The unraveling had just begun, and Finn, the patiently impatient underwater welder, was ready to pamper the chaos. <words>277</words>
