The lovelorn spy, curiously indifferent to the flashing neon signs of the futuristic city slums, peeled an unused sticky label from his wrist. <words>18</words>
He’d used it as a makeshift reminder, a pathetically analog note in this digital dystopia, to meet her here, at the greasy spoon diner famed for its experimental protein slurries. <words>38</words>
At the instant a new recipe, “Neptune’s Vomit,” was finally tasted by a gaggle of thrill-seeking foodies, he saw her reflection in the grimy window, distorted and unfamiliar. <words>57</words>
It wasn’t her. <words>59</words>
His heart, already a shriveled prune of disappointment, withered further. <words>65</words>
He’d been played. <words>67</words>
Again. <words>68</words>
Their shared interest in urban exploration, a carefully constructed facade, had been her method for getting close, for extracting whatever information she needed. <words>87</words>
He knew this. <words>89</words>
He’d known it all along, yet he’d let himself hope. <words>95</words>
Hope was the most dangerous drug in the slums. <words>100</words>
He crumpled the sticky label, a bitter smile playing on his lips. <words>106</words>
The avalanche, the inevitable betrayal, had finally arrived. <words>112</words>
And yet, a strange sense of detachment washed over him. <words>118</words>
He felt almost… relieved. <words>120</words>
This was it. <words>122</words>
The end of the charade. <words>125</words>
He could finally stop running. <words>128</words>
He watched the unfamiliar reflection in the window, a flicker of something akin to amusement in his eyes. <words>138</words>
He knew who she worked for. <words>141</words>
He knew their plans. <words>143</words>
And now, free from the illusion of love, he could finally gloat. <words>150</words>
He had information they didn’t know he had. <words>155</words>
Information that would bury them all. <words>159</words>
He wouldn’t outrun the avalanche. <words>162</words>
He would ride it. <words>164</words>
He would become the avalanche. <words>167</words>
His rambling destiny, once a tangled mess of yearning and deceit, had finally found its terrifying trajectory. <words>178</words>
He tossed the crumpled label into the overflowing bin, a small act of defiance in a city built on them. <words>188</words>
He turned and walked away from the diner, the neon glow painting his face in an eerie, almost celebratory light. <words>199</words>
The taste of Neptune’s Vomit lingered in the air, a fittingly grotesque backdrop to the unfolding drama. <words>209</words>
He wasn't running from the avalanche anymore. <words>214</words>
He was embracing it. <words>216</words>
He was becoming it. <words>218</words>
His curiously indifferent facade cracked, revealing a glint of something sharp and dangerous beneath. <words>228</words>
He would outrun the unstoppable avalanche by becoming something even more unstoppable. <words>237</words>
He would use their own methods against them, their own reflections to blind them. <words>246</words>
He would gloat over their downfall, a lovelorn spy transformed into an agent of chaos. <words>256</words>
The city slums, his playground and his prison, would bear witness to his rambling, destructive destiny. <words>267</words>
He would make sure of it. <words>270</words>
