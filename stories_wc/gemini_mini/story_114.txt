The apathetic summoner, enthusiastically lazy, stretched out on the worn leather couch of the shared dream recording studio. <words>15</words>
Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through the grimy windows, remnants of a world touched by the last breath of a dying god. <words>30</words>
His motivation, a surprisingly sharp pang in his otherwise indifferent heart, was to rebuild the coral reefs, bleached white skeletons in the waking world. <words>47</words>
He knew, somehow, that the answer lay within the river wisdom, a concept as elusive as the smoke curling from the forgotten incense burner in the corner. <words>63</words>
He rose, with the deliberate slowness of someone conserving energy for a truly monumental task, and retrieved a rustic coffee grinder from a dusty shelf. <words>78</words>
It wasn't for coffee, of course. <words>81</words>
This was a tool, a key, a conduit. <words>84</words>
He walked through the studio, a space filled with the echoes of a thousand forgotten dreams, to a long, deserted hall. <words>98</words>
Empty frames hung on the walls, each a perfect rectangle of nothingness. <words>105</words>
He began to unfold the secrets of the river wisdom through matching the empty frames. <words>114</words>
He placed the coffee grinder in the center of the first frame, its wooden handle pointing towards the second. <words>125</words>
The second frame shimmered, and an image, hazy and indistinct, began to form. <words>132</words>
It was a river, flowing not with water, but with light. <words>138</words>
He moved the grinder to the next frame, aligning it with a third. <words>145</words>
Another image unfolded, this one of coral, vibrant and pulsing with life. <words>152</words>
He continued, frame by frame, the grinder acting as a strange, intuitive compass, navigating the currents of the river wisdom. <words>165</words>
The images in the frames began to connect, forming a narrative, a blueprint, a song. <words>173</words>
The gentle sharpness of the process, the quiet click of the grinder against the frames, the slow unfolding of the river's secrets, filled the studio with a strange, expectant hum. <words>192</words>
He was not building the reefs with his hands, not yet. <words>198</words>
He was building them in the shared dream, weaving a tapestry of light and sound, a template for the waking world to follow. <words>212</words>
The apathetic summoner, still enthusiastically lazy, yet driven by a purpose he couldn't quite articulate, continued his work, frame by frame, breath by breath, until the hall glowed with the promise of a reborn ocean. <words>235</words>
The river wisdom, once a distant whisper, now flowed through him, a gentle, insistent current, shaping not only the dream, but the dreamer himself. <words>251</words>
He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that when he woke, the work would continue, guided by the echoes of the river's song. <words>266</words>
The bleached white skeletons, he felt, would soon bloom again. <words>272</words>
