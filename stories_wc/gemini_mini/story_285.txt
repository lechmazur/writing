The hesitant swordsman, naturally awkward, shifted his weight from one foot to the other, the frozen ground crunching beneath his worn leather boots. <words>18</words>
Steam hissed from the geothermal vents that dotted the frigid tundra orchard, the only signs of warmth in this desolate landscape. <words>31</words>
When the final piece of evidence was filed away – a blank postcard tucked into his breast pocket, a symbol of the world he’d left behind – he knew it was time. <words>51</words>
He had to emerge, to bridge the worlds. <words>55</words>
His motivation: to restore the traditional systems, the old ways that had been lost to the ephemeral rancor of progress. <words>68</words>
He watched the hermit crabs, their methodical, sideways scuttle across the icy ground, each one abandoning its old shell for a new one, a perfect metaphor for his own journey. <words>88</words>
He would bridge worlds by the life of hermit crabs moving shells, shedding the old, embracing the new, yet carrying the essence of the past within him. <words>106</words>
He took a deep breath, the frigid air stinging his lungs. <words>112</words>
The orchard, once a symbol of life and abundance, now stood bare and skeletal, its branches reaching towards the grey sky like the clawing fingers of the dead. <words>132</words>
He felt a pang of regret, a fleeting bitterness for what had been lost. <words>140</words>
But the rancor was ephemeral, fading as quickly as it arose, replaced by a steely resolve. <words>150</words>
He drew his sword, the polished steel gleaming in the dim light. <words>156</words>
The blade felt heavy in his hand, a tangible reminder of the responsibility he carried. <words>166</words>
He closed his eyes, picturing the vibrant world he hoped to restore, a world where tradition and progress could coexist in harmony. <words>182</words>
He imagined the sweet scent of blossoming fruit trees, the laughter of children playing in the sun, the gentle hum of ancient rituals being performed. <words>199</words>
He opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on the largest geothermal vent, its plume of steam rising like a beacon in the desolate landscape. <words>214</words>
This was his portal, his bridge between worlds. <words>219</words>
He took a hesitant step forward, his awkwardness momentarily forgotten in the intensity of his purpose. <words>230</words>
He felt a strange tingling sensation, a subtle shift in the air around him. <words>238</words>
The ground beneath his feet seemed to vibrate, the steam from the vent swirling around him like a ghostly embrace. <words>250</words>
He took another step, and then another, his pace quickening as he moved towards the heart of the vent. <words>261</words>
He felt a surge of energy, a powerful force pulling him forward, urging him to cross the threshold. <words>272</words>
He closed his eyes, bracing himself for the unknown. <words>277</words>
And then, he emerged. <words>279</words>
