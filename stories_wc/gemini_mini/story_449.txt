She’d spent the last few weeks, throughout baking countless batches of star-shaped cookies, meticulously filling the backs of discarded concert tickets with cryptic doodles. <words>45</words>

Elara’s motivation, the driving force behind her obsessive sketching, was to birth an entirely new philosophy, one that reconciled the vastness of space with the intimacy of a single gingerbread cookie. <words>80</words>
