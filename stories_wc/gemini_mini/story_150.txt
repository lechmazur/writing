A virtually peculiar outlaw cowboy poet, Jericho, sat in the steampunk observatory dome, the brass gears whirring a lullaby of misaligned time. <words>17</words>
Throughout rehearsals for his latest spoken-word piece, he’d been trying to spark unstoppable curiosity within himself. <words>30</words>
His method? <words>31</words>
Reading the coffee shop walls downstairs, their text morphing into new pronouncements every few minutes. <words>41</words>
One moment, they’d declare the virtues of Martian tea, the next, the dangers of misaligned cogs in dimensional travel. <words>53</words>
Jericho’s saturated ambivalence towards the whole affair was as thick as the observatory’s smog-tinged air. <words>63</words>
He rolled a pair of worn runic bone dice across the star chart table, their clatter echoing the chaotic whispers of intertwined destinies. <words>75</words>
He’d found the dice in a dusty trunk labeled “Property of the Chronomaestro,” a name that sent shivers down his spine, not of fear, but of a strange, detached fascination. <words>93</words>
The dice seemed to hum with a power he couldn’t comprehend, their runes shifting and rearranging themselves with each roll. <words>104</words>
The coffee shop walls downstairs flickered. <words>107</words>
“Beware the Clockwork Heart,” they proclaimed, the words shimmering in emerald green ink. <words>114</words>
Jericho sighed, the saturated ambivalence clinging to him like a second skin. <words>121</words>
He wasn’t sure if the walls were guiding him, mocking him, or simply reflecting his own fragmented thoughts. <words>131</words>
The dice landed, displaying a rune he’d never seen before, a swirling vortex that seemed to suck the light from the room. <words>142</words>
The observatory dome groaned, the gears grinding against each other in a symphony of misalignment. <words>151</words>
He felt a pull, a tugging sensation in his chest, as if his own heart was being drawn into the vortex on the dice. <words>162</words>
The coffee shop walls downstairs went blank, the emerald ink fading into the steam-stained plaster. <words>170</words>
Throughout rehearsals, he’d been searching for a spark, a connection to something beyond the saturated ambivalence that permeated his existence. <words>182</words>
He’d hoped the changing words, the virtually peculiar nature of the observatory, the worn runic bone dice, would offer some clue, some insight into the intertwined destinies he felt brushing against his own. <words>201</words>
But now, staring at the swirling vortex on the dice, he felt more lost than ever. <words>210</words>
The misalignment of the gears, the silence of the walls, the humming of the dice – it all pointed to something vast and unknowable, something that both terrified and intrigued him. <words>229</words>
He picked up the dice, their warmth radiating into his palm. <words>235</words>
The saturated ambivalence began to dissipate, replaced by a burning, unstoppable curiosity. <words>244</words>
He had to know. <words>246</words>
He had to understand the connection between the dice, the walls, the observatory, and himself. <words>256</words>
He had to unravel the mystery of the Chronomaestro and the intertwined destinies that seemed to be drawing him into their intricate dance. <words>272</words>
Throughout rehearsals, he’d been searching for a muse. <words>277</words>
He’d found something far more profound. <words>281</words>
He’d found his purpose. <words>283</words>
