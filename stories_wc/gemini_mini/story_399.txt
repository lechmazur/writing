Old Man Hemlock, the crypt caretaker, grumbled, his face a gnarled map of discontent. <words>12</words>
He clutched an unmarked cardboard tube, its mundane presence a stark contrast to the witch's crystal scrying room, shimmering with celestial charts and arcane instruments. <words>30</words>
Throughout stargazing, Hemlock had been plagued by a multiply singular tremor, a jiggling in his left hand that mirrored an uprising within his own soul. <words>48</words>
The trauma of his past, a singular event fractured into a thousand echoing shards, threatened to shatter the fragile peace he’d painstakingly constructed. <words>65</words>
He sought solace not in the swirling cosmos above, but in the intricate sand mandala spread across the scrying table. <words>78</words>
Its delicate patterns, meticulously raked by the witch, represented the universe's grand design, a cosmic order he desperately craved to replicate within himself. <words>95</words>
He placed the cardboard tube gently on the table, its plainness a jarring note in the room's esoteric symphony. <words>107</words>
Inside, he knew, lay the witch's latest concoction, a potion meant to quell the tremors, both physical and emotional. <words>120</words>
But Hemlock hesitated. <words>122</words>
He understood, with a grandiose subtlety that belied his gruff exterior, that true healing wouldn't come from a bottled remedy. <words>136</words>
It would come from confronting the trauma itself, from tracing its jagged edges through the patterns in the sand mandala, from understanding its place in the larger tapestry of his life. <words>159</words>
Throughout stargazing, he’d witnessed the slow, majestic dance of celestial bodies, each with its own unique trajectory, its own scars and imperfections. <words>176</words>
He realized that his own trauma, multiply singular as it was, was not a flaw but a defining characteristic, a constellation of pain that had shaped him into the man he was. <words>199</words>
With a newfound resolve, Hemlock began to jiggle the cardboard tube, not in agitation, but in a rhythmic motion, mirroring the subtle vibrations of the universe. <words>218</words>
He traced the lines of the mandala with the tube, letting the granular texture ground him, anchoring him to the present moment. <words>232</words>
As he moved the tube, he began to narrate his trauma, whispering the fragmented memories into the stillness of the scrying room. <words>246</words>
Each word, each jiggle of the tube, was a step towards integration, a step towards reclaiming the fractured pieces of himself. <words>260</words>
The grandiose subtlety of the moment wasn't lost on him. <words>266</words>
He was, in his own way, conducting a symphony of healing, using the witch's tools and the wisdom of the stars to quell the uprising within. <words>284</words>
Throughout stargazing, Hemlock found a path towards wholeness, not by erasing his trauma, but by embracing it as an integral part of his multiply singular existence. <words>302</words>
The jiggling ceased. <words>304</words>
The tube rested still upon the mandala. <words>308</words>
And within the grumpy crypt caretaker, a fragile peace began to bloom. <words>316</words>
