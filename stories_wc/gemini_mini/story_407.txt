Bartholomew, the unluckiest meteorologist in the known galaxy, clutched his mariner’s sextant, its brass gleaming faintly in the subterranean glow of the lizard people’s city. <words>17</words> He was there, between colliding interests of warring lizard factions, to study the systematically chaotic behaviors of phosphorescent fungi. <words>29</words> His true motivation, however, was a whispered rumor, a spoken truth passed between star-faring botanists: the fungi held the key to predicting solar flares. <words>42</words> Bartholomew, drawn to cosmic events like a moth to a dying star, couldn’t resist. <words>49</words>

Taking a shortcut through the Whispering Grotto, a network of tunnels known for its unstable crystalline structures, he had an unexpected encounter. <words>60</words>  A hulking lizard, scales the color of dried blood, blocked his path. <words>66</words>  “Surface dweller,” the lizard hissed, its voice like gravel grinding on bone. <words>72</words> “What brings you to the sacred gardens?” <words>75</words> Bartholomew, his voice laced with the bitter honey of a man accustomed to disappointment, explained his research. <words>84</words> The lizard scoffed. <words>85</words> “Lies,” it spat. <words>87</words> “You seek the Sunstone.” <words>89</words>

Bartholomew, taken aback, denied it. <words>92</words> He had never heard of a Sunstone. <words>95</words> The lizard, unconvinced, lunged. <words>98</words> Bartholomew, though no warrior, had learned to spar during his time on a rough mining asteroid. <words>107</words> He dodged the lizard’s initial strike, the sextant swinging wildly in his hand. <words>115</words> The grotto, already unstable, began to tremble. <words>120</words> Crystals rained down, illuminating the scene in bursts of blinding light. <words>127</words>

The fight was a blur of scales, brass, and falling rock. <words>133</words> Bartholomew, relying more on luck than skill, managed to land a blow with the sextant, stunning the lizard. <words>144</words> He scrambled past the dazed creature, deeper into the city, the spoken truth of the fungi’s power echoing in his mind. <words>156</words> He knew, with a certainty that defied his usual bad luck, that he was close. <words>164</words> The lizard’s accusation, however, lingered. <words>168</words> Sunstone. <words>169</words> What was it? <words>171</words> And why did the lizard think he was after it? <words>176</words> The questions added a new layer of complexity to his already systematically chaotic quest. <words>187</words>  He pressed on, the bitter honey of his ambition tinged with a new, unsettling curiosity. <words>197</words> The underground city pulsed with secrets, and Bartholomew, the unlucky meteorologist, found himself caught in its web. <words>209</words> The phosphorescent fungi beckoned, promising answers, but the whispers of the Sunstone hinted at dangers yet unknown. <words>222</words> He was between colliding interests, not just of warring factions, but of his own scientific curiosity and a growing sense of unease. <words>237</words> The spoken truth of the fungi might lead him to the stars, but the unspoken truth of the Sunstone could bury him beneath the earth. <words>252</words>  He adjusted his grip on the sextant, its cool metal a comfort in the humid air of the underground city. <words>264</words>  He had come for answers, and he would find them, even if it meant facing the systematically chaotic heart of the lizard people's secrets. <words>279</words>
