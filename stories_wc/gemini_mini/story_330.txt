A dejected knight, his armor dulled with the cosmic dust of the zero-gravity dance hall, floated listlessly among swirling couples. <words>18</words>
When the old watchtower clock, embedded in the asteroid that housed the hall, struck the unexpected hour of three-and-a-half, a tremor ran through the structure. <words>41</words>
