The unmasked vigilante, lazily ambitious yet driven by a peculiar whim, perched atop the highest forgotten fountain in the city. <words>16</words>
At the pause between raindrops, the air hung heavy with anticipation. <words>23</words>
He was here, in this city of forgotten fountains, not to fight crime, but to lure his next target. <words>33</words>
His motivation: to collect traditional games, no matter how obscure. <words>39</words>
His method: analyzing gossip gleaned from barbershop quartet rehearsals. <words>45</words>
He’d learned that a retired clockmaker, rumored to possess a rare edition of “Fox and Geese,” frequented a particular barbershop every Tuesday. <words>58</words>
This Tuesday, however, the clockmaker hadn’t shown. <words>62</words>
The vigilante sighed, a sound almost swallowed by the dripping stonework. <words>68</words>
Resilience, he reminded himself, was key to any successful game hunter. <words>74</words>
He pulled out an antique dentist’s drill, its silver gleaming faintly in the diffused light. <words>82</words>
Not a weapon, but a tool. <words>85</words>
He’d carefully modified it to carve intricate game pieces from wood. <words>91</words>
He began whittling a small fox, the wood curling away like whispers. <words>98</words>
The barbershop quartet, their rehearsal delayed by the rain, finally arrived, their voices echoing through the deserted square. <words>108</words>
The vigilante listened intently, the drill momentarily forgotten. <words>113</words>
Snippets of conversation drifted up to him: the clockmaker’s grandson was ill, hence the missed appointment. <words>122</words>
The grandson’s favorite game? <words>124</words>
“Fox and Geese,” one of the singers boomed. <words>128</words>
A smile, hidden by the shadows, played on the vigilante’s lips. <words>134</words>
The clockmaker would visit his grandson, bringing the game with him. <words>141</words>
A new location, a new strategy. <words>144</words>
The vigilante’s lazily ambitious nature didn’t preclude meticulous planning. <words>151</words>
He pocketed the half-carved fox, the antique dentist’s drill nestled beside it. <words>158</words>
The rain began again, a gentle patter against the stone. <words>164</words>
The city of forgotten fountains shimmered, each droplet a tiny lens reflecting the hidden whimsy of its most peculiar resident. <words>175</words>
The vigilante descended, his steps as light as the falling rain, already formulating a new plan, fueled by the art of resilience and the thrill of the hunt. <words>190</words>
He would acquire the game. <words>193</words>
He always did. <words>195</words>
The barbershop quartet launched into a spirited rendition of "Sweet Adeline," their voices a strangely fitting soundtrack to the vigilante's whimsical quest. <words>210</words>
He blended into the gathering dusk, a shadow amongst shadows, the city of forgotten fountains his playground, his hunting ground, his canvas for the art of resilient game collecting. <words>230</words>
The rain continued to fall, washing away the day's whispers and secrets, leaving only the echo of a hidden whimsy in the heart of the city. <words>245</words>
The vigilante, driven by his unique motivation, disappeared into the labyrinthine streets, the antique dentist's drill a silent promise of future carvings, future games, future triumphs of resilience. <words>269</words>
He was, after all, a collector. <words>273</words>
And the game must go on. <words>276</words>
