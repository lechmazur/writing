Bartholomew, an exceptionally usual underachieving mage, stared at the blinking doll head. <words>11</words>
He’d found it nestled amongst fertilizer and seed catalogues in a misdelivered package addressed to the station’s previous hydroponics specialist. <words>28</words>
The abandoned space station control room, at the boundary of his family’s soon-to-be-sold farmland, had become his workshop, his sanctuary, his trap. <words>44</words>
Bartholomew felt a flicker of bored excitement, a familiar sensation whenever he embarked on one of his eccentric projects. <words>55</words>
This time, it was different. <words>57</words>
This time, the blinking doll head, with its unnervingly lifelike gaze, held the key. <words>66</words>
The key to reclaiming his heritage. <words>70</words>
Not the heritage of land or titles, which his family was rapidly losing, but the heritage of magic, the raw, untamed power that flowed through his veins, yet remained stubbornly dormant. <words>92</words>
He’d always been told he was ordinary, unremarkable, a disappointment to the long line of powerful mages that preceded him. <words>104</words>
But Bartholomew suspected the truth was far more complex. <words>109</words>
He believed his ordinariness was a self-imposed prison, a fear of failure masquerading as mediocrity. <words>120</words>
The doll head, a bizarre, unexpected artifact, was the perfect catalyst for his plan. <words>129</words>
He’d spent weeks modifying it, weaving enchantments into its vacant stare, channeling his own latent magic into its plastic shell. <words>142</words>
Now, the moment of unveiling had arrived. <words>146</words>
He placed the doll head on a pedestal constructed from discarded circuit boards and rusty pipes, a monument to his peculiar genius. <words>159</words>
With a flick of his wrist, he activated the final rune. <words>165</words>
The doll head’s eyes blinked faster, then began to glow with an eerie green light. <words>174</words>
The air crackled with energy, and a low hum filled the control room. <words>181</words>
Bartholomew felt a surge of power, unlike anything he’d experienced before. <words>189</words>
It wasn’t the controlled, refined magic of his ancestors, but something wilder, more chaotic. <words>198</words>
It pulsed within him, threatening to break free. <words>202</words>
He’d set a trap, not for some external enemy, but for his own limitations, his own fear. <words>212</words>
He’d used the misdelivered package, the abandoned space station, the exceptionally usual circumstances of his life, to create a crucible for change. <words>227</words>
The doll head, a symbol of his perceived inadequacy, was now a conduit for his liberation. <words>237</words>
He was unveiling not just a magical artifact, but a new version of himself. <words>246</words>
A version that embraced the chaos, the uncertainty, the raw power that had always been within him. <words>257</words>
He smiled, a genuine, excited smile, devoid of boredom. <words>263</words>
The trap had sprung. <words>265</words>
And he was free. <words>267</words>
