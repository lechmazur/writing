<story>
A hopeful knight, cleverly naive, knelt within a mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze. <words>14</words>
The air, thick with the scent of overripe plums and the hush of a streetlamp flickering out, hummed with a peculiar energy. <words>28</words>
He clutched a stray jigsaw edge, its surface pulsing faintly. <words>33</words>
This wasn't just any garden; it housed the machine that cycled regrets, a contraption whispering failures into the very fabric of existence. <words>49</words>
The knight, driven by a deep yearning to reclaim the lost, sought to neutralize it. <words>57</words>
The jigsaw edge, he believed, held the key. <words>61</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the cryptic frequencies emanating from the machine. <words>69</words>
Agonizing bliss washed over him as he began to sync with the rhythmic pulses, the jigsaw edge vibrating in his hand. <words>81</words>
The frequencies were a cacophony of whispers, each a lost opportunity, a broken promise, a path not taken. <words>92</words>
Yet, within the chaos, he found a pattern, a melody of regret. <words>99</words>
He began to hum, his voice a low, resonant drone that mirrored the machine's frequencies. <words>108</words>
The jigsaw edge glowed brighter, its light casting strange shadows on the fruit-laden branches. <words>117</words>
The air crackled with anticipation. <words>120</words>
Slowly, subtly, the machine's rhythmic churning began to falter. <words>126</words>
The whispers faded, replaced by a growing silence. <words>130</words>
The knight's humming intensified, the jigsaw edge resonating with the machine's core. <words>138</words>
He felt a surge of power, a connection to the lost fragments of time and memory. <words>147</words>
The machine sputtered, its gears grinding to a halt. <words>152</words>
The agonizing bliss intensified, a bittersweet symphony of reclaimed memories flooding his senses. <words>161</words>
He saw glimpses of forgotten faces, heard echoes of laughter long silenced. <words>168</words>
The orchard garden, no longer a prison of regret, shimmered with a renewed vitality. <words>176</words>
The knight opened his eyes, the jigsaw edge now cool and inert in his hand. <words>184</words>
The machine was silent, neutralized. <words>187</words>
The lost, he hoped, were finally at peace. <words>191</words>
He stood, a bittersweet smile playing on his lips, the scent of plums now carrying a hint of hope. <words>201</words>
He knew the machine was only a symptom, the true source of regret lay within the human heart. <words>212</words>
But for now, in this hushed orchard, a small victory had been won. <words>219</words>
A single, stray jigsaw edge had disrupted the cycle, offering a fleeting glimpse of a world where the lost could be reclaimed, not just remembered. <words>236</words>
And in that fleeting glimpse, the hopeful, cleverly naive knight found a renewed sense of purpose, a strengthened resolve to continue his quest, to mend the broken fragments of time and memory, one cryptic frequency at a time. <words>274</words>
