The exorcist, plagued by a stage fright so profound it bordered on paralysis, stared at the inheritance papers. <words>16</words>
Amid a chaotic sprawl of half-assembled toys, the legal jargon swam before his eyes, each clause a testament to generations of carefully constructed lies. <words>34</words>
His inheritance wasn't land or money, but a legacy of "never"â€”never successful, never normal, never usual. <words>46</words>
He clutched a brittle collection of pressed wildflowers, a memento from his grandmother, the only person who had ever seen the possibility within him. <words>61</words>
He was driven by a defiant hush, a quiet determination to sculpt possibility from the ashes of that inherited "never." <words>73</words>
The setting, however, was far from usual. <words>77</words>
He wasn't in a haunted house or a shadowy crypt, but within a decaying space station, surrounded by orbital debris, the remnants of shattered dreams and defunct technology. <words>96</words>
The station groaned and shuddered, a symphony of metallic sighs accompanying his every move. <words>105</words>
He had to perform the exorcism here, in this graveyard of abandoned ambitions. <words>113</words>
The entity wasn't a demon possessing a person, but a lie woven into the very fabric of his family history. <words>125</words>
It whispered in the hiss of escaping air, in the creak of strained metal, feeding on the inherited "never." <words>136</words>
By the sound of a key turning in a lock, a hidden compartment in the floor slid open, revealing a murky pool of recycled water. <words>151</words>
This was his stage, his ritualistic space. <words>155</words>
He had to submerge the pressed wildflowers, a symbolic drowning of the inherited lies, a baptism in the possibility of a new narrative. <words>171</words>
His hands trembled, the stage fright threatening to consume him. <words>177</words>
But the defiant hush within him grew stronger, a counterpoint to the fear. <words>184</words>
He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and submerged the wildflowers into the murky water. <words>193</words>
The station seemed to hold its breath, the metallic groans fading into an expectant silence. <words>201</words>
As the water closed over the fragile petals, a strange sense of peace washed over him. <words>210</words>
The lie, the "never," began to dissolve, replaced by a nascent sense of freedom. <words>219</words>
He emerged from the ritual, dripping, reborn. <words>223</words>
The orbital debris, once a symbol of failure, now seemed like a constellation of possibilities. <words>233</words>
He was no longer bound by the inheritance of lies. <words>239</words>
He was free to sculpt his own narrative, amid the toy assembly and the silent stars, in a setting as never usual as he was. <words>254</words>
The exorcism was complete. <words>257</words>
Not with chanting or incantations, but with a quiet act of defiance, a submersion of inherited lies, and the blossoming of a new, possible truth. <words>276</words>
