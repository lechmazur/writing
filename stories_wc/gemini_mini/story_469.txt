She stood in the whispering gallery, its curved walls amplifying the hushed panic of the city above, each tick of the clock echoing like a thunderclap. <words>61</words>
The scent of a garden at night, impossibly sweet and out of place, drifted up from a shadowed archway, a siren's call in the concrete labyrinth. <words>76</words>
