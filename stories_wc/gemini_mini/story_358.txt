An old-fashioned mage, robes heavy with embroidered runes, wandered the arctic research greenhouse amid the echoes of children's playground time. <words>16</words>
The air, thick with the scent of thawing permafrost and experimental orchids, hummed with a sanctified dread. <words>27</words>
He was purposefully aimless, his motivation a whisper of ambition: to claim an uncharted frontier, a realm glimpsed only through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections. <words>46</words>
He clutched a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, cold against his gloved hand. <words>54</words>
The fragment pulsed with a faint, icy light, a beacon in the mundane world. <words>62</words>
It was the key, he believed, to this frontier, a lock to a dimension beyond human comprehension. <words>73</words>
The unfolding riddle of the fragment’s purpose consumed him. <words>79</words>
Each fleeting reflection in the greenhouse’s glass panes, in the polished metal of scientific instruments, offered a distorted glimpse of this other world. <words>95</words>
Faces, not quite human, peered back at him, whispering promises and threats in a language he felt rather than heard. <words>108</words>
He saw landscapes of impossible geometry, cities built of starlight and shadow. <words>116</words>
The children's laughter, filtering in from outside, felt jarring, a discordant note in the symphony of his sanctified dread. <words>130</words>
He sought solace, a grounding connection to his purpose, in the strangest of ways. <words>139</words>
He found a small, forgotten mirror tucked beneath a workbench, its surface clouded with condensation. <words>150</words>
He peered into it, seeking another ephemeral encounter. <words>155</words>
This time, he saw not a monstrous visage or alien landscape, but a reflection of himself, older, wearier, cradling the coffin fragment. <words>170</words>
In the reflection, the fragment glowed brighter, casting an ethereal light on his face. <words>179</words>
Driven by an instinct he couldn't explain, he pressed his cheek against the cold glass, cuddling the reflection as if it were a tangible comfort. <words>196</words>
The sanctified dread intensified, a chilling wave washing over him. <words>203</words>
The reflection rippled, the image of the older mage blurring, then solidifying into something… different. <words>215</words>
The face was still his, but the eyes were vast and empty, reflecting the impossible geometries he had glimpsed before. <words>229</words>
The reflected hand, still clutching the fragment, reached out of the mirror, beckoning. <words>238</words>
The unfolding riddle was nearing its climax. <words>242</words>
The mage, lost in the sanctified dread and the allure of the uncharted frontier, felt a strange peace. <words>254</words>
He reached out, his hand trembling, to touch the cold glass, to accept the invitation of his other self, to step into the reflection and claim his frontier. <words>275</words>
The children's laughter faded, replaced by a low, resonant hum that seemed to emanate from the fragment itself. <words>287</words>
The greenhouse air grew colder, the scent of orchids replaced by the dust of ages. <words>297</words>
The mage closed his eyes, ready to embrace the unknown. <words>302</words>
The unfolding riddle was about to reveal its answer. <words>308</words>
He pressed his hand against the glass, and the world dissolved. <words>314</words>
