Seraphina, a femme fatale heartbreak counselor, adjusted her amber earrings, their honeyed glow mirroring the sky reflection pool at her feet. <words>16</words>
After the invention of time travel, heartbreak had become a curiously malleable thing, yet the gravity of desires remained a constant, a heavy anchor in the shifting sands of possibility. <words>36</words>
Seraphina, restlessly curious, felt the familiar pull, the urge to proclaim herself free in the cage of illusions she’d carefully constructed. <words>51</words>
The pool, a perfect mirror of the cerulean expanse above, rippled with the passing of a chronoship, its wake distorting the reflected cloud trails. <words>66</words>
She tracked them, her gaze zipping from one dissipating wisp to another, a method she’d developed for grounding herself in the present, however fleeting it might be. <words>83</words>
Each trail represented a potential future, a discarded timeline, a whisper of what could have been. <words>92</words>
Her clients came to her seeking solace, a way to excise the pain of lost love, but Seraphina knew the truth: the heart, once given, could never truly be retrieved, not even with the power of temporal manipulation. <words>117</words>
It could only be redirected, its trajectory altered, its destination shrouded in the mists of time. <words>127</words>
She dipped a finger into the cool water, the sky reflection rippling around her touch. <words>135</words>
The amber earrings swung gently, catching the light, miniature suns in her carefully crafted orbit. <words>144</words>
Her clients sought freedom from their desires, but Seraphina sought freedom within them, a dangerous dance on the precipice of obsession. <words>157</words>
She zipped her sleek chrono-suit, the fabric shimmering like captured starlight. <words>163</words>
The gravity of her own desires, the yearning for a love that transcended time itself, propelled her forward. <words>174</words>
She stepped into the reflection pool, the water closing over her head, a portal opening in the mirrored sky. <words>184</words>
For a moment, she was suspended between worlds, the past and the future swirling around her like cosmic dust. <words>194</words>
Then, with a burst of temporal energy, she was gone, chasing cloud trails across the vast canvas of time, a cautious impulse driving her ever onward. <words>209</words>
She knew the risks, the potential paradoxes, the dangers of tampering with the delicate fabric of causality. <words>220</words>
But the thrill of the chase, the intoxicating possibility of finding a love that defied the laws of time and space, was too strong to resist. <words>236</words>
She was a prisoner of her own design, a willing captive in the cage of her desires, yet in that surrender, she found a strange, exhilarating freedom. <words>252</words>
The sky reflection pool, now undisturbed, mirrored the empty sky, waiting patiently for her return, or perhaps, for her next departure. <words>264</words>
The amber earrings, left behind on the edge of the pool, shimmered faintly, a testament to the gravity of desires and the restless curiosity of a heart unbound by time. <words>282</words>
