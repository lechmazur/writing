The unsteady sentinel, perched on a rusted girder in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, shivered, not from the cold, but from the premonition of worlds colliding. <words>20</words>
The air crackled with an energy that felt both exhilarating and dreadful, a cheerless ecstasy. <words>29</words>
He clutched a strange automaton bird, its gears whirring softly, a counterpoint to the silence of the vast bay. <words>39</words>
He was tasked with preventing the collision, guided by a prophecy he now suspected was deliberately misleading. <words>50</words>
The fog of deception had to be cleared. <words>54</words>
His gaze fell upon a pile of shredded letters he’d discovered tucked within the automaton bird’s hollow chest. <words>66</words>
He began painstakingly reassembling them, his fingers clumsy with anticipation. <words>72</words>
Each fragment revealed a piece of the puzzle, a coyly furious whisper of truth against the backdrop of impending doom. <words>84</words>
The letters spoke of a planned ambush, a betrayal orchestrated by those he trusted. <words>92</words>
The prophecy wasn't misguided; it was a trap. <words>96</words>
The automaton bird, he realized, was more than a messenger; it was a key. <words>104</words>
Its design, now that he examined it closely, mirrored the docking bay’s layout. <words>112</words>
Specific gears corresponded to specific sections of the bay. <words>117</words>
He began to manipulate the gears, matching their positions to the sequence described in the reassembled letters. <words>128</words>
As he did, sections of the docking bay wall shimmered and dissolved, revealing hidden compartments. <words>137</words>
Inside one, he found a deactivated energy cannon, powerful enough to deflect a small planet. <words>145</words>
In another, a series of coded instructions. <words>149</words>
The ambush of fate, he realized with a grim satisfaction, could be countered. <words>157</words>
The prophecy, now understood, became a roadmap to survival. <words>163</words>
The automaton bird chirped, a metallic sound that echoed through the bay. <words>170</words>
It was a signal, a confirmation. <words>173</words>
He felt a surge of cheerless ecstasy, the thrill of uncovering the truth mingled with the dread of what was to come. <words>186</words>
He had to warn the others, those still blinded by the false prophecy. <words>193</words>
But how could he convince them? <words>196</words>
He considered his options, the weight of the impending collision pressing down on him. <words>205</words>
He couldn't simply tell them; they wouldn't believe him. <words>210</words>
He had to show them, lead them to the truth he had uncovered. <words>217</words>
He had to recommend they examine the automaton bird, its secrets now laid bare. <words>226</words>
He had to recommend they study the reassembled letters, the coyly furious whispers of betrayal. <words>236</words>
He had to recommend they prepare for the ambush, not the collision. <words>243</words>
He had to recommend they use the hidden cannon, the key to their survival. <words>251</words>
He clutched the automaton bird tighter, its cold metal a comfort in the cheerless ecstasy of the moment. <words>262</words>
The time between worlds colliding was running out. <words>267</words>
He had to act. <words>269</words>
He had to recommend. <words>271</words>
