<story>Bartholomew, the orchardist, was never tardy, a trait honed throughout years of volunteering at the paper airplane test facility. <words>16</words>  His sardonic glee, a thin veneer over a deep personal tragedy, found an outlet in the facility's unlikely chaos. <words>31</words> He meticulously observed the flight paths of the paper creations, each loop and flutter a potential clue in the conspiracy he believed was unraveling around him. <words>49</words>  The facility, with its whirring fans and the constant whoosh of launched paper, was his sanctuary, his laboratory for decoding the secrets hidden in plain sight. <words>65</words>

He’d lost his wife, a renowned origami artist, in a supposed “accidental” paper cut, a story the police swallowed whole, but Bartholomew knew better. <words>82</words>  Paper, he believed, could be a weapon as much as an art form. <words>88</words>  He found a clue – an antique letter seal bearing his wife's unique crest, tucked away in a discarded prototype. <words>100</words>  It was the key, he felt, to unlocking the truth. <words>105</words>

Throughout his volunteering, Bartholomew had noticed a recurring pattern in the failed designs, specifically those mimicking a peacock's tail. <words>119</words>  The angles, the folds, the way they spiraled down – they mirrored the markings on the letter seal. <words>130</words>  He needed to demonstrate his theory, to expose the conspiracy he believed reached the highest echelons of the paper airplane community. <words>143</words>

He gathered the discarded peacock-tailed prototypes, arranging them on a table, tracing the lines of their descent with a red marker. <words>155</words>  He pointed to the intricate patterns on the antique letter seal, its peacock emblem almost identical to the failed designs. <words>169</words>  "Observe," he announced with sardonic glee, his voice echoing in the cavernous facility. <words>177</words>  "Via the patterns in a peacock's tail, I will demonstrate the truth!" <words>185</words>

He showed how the specific folds, when applied to a certain type of paper, created minute cuts, invisible to the naked eye but deadly with the right pressure. <words>201</words>  He demonstrated how these cuts could be disguised as accidental nicks, just like the one that claimed his wife's life. <words>214</words>  The other volunteers, initially skeptical, began to see the chilling logic in Bartholomew's deductions. <words>225</words>  The peacock's tail, a symbol of beauty and pride, had been twisted into a tool of silent assassination. <words>237</words>

Bartholomew, fueled by his grief and sardonic glee, had finally unravelled the conspiracy, his meticulous observations and the antique letter seal serving as his guide through the labyrinth of deceit. <words>256</words>  He had found a purpose in the paper airplane test facility, a place that had initially seemed so far removed from his orchard, but which had ultimately become the stage for his personal triumph. <words>279</words>  He would ensure his wife's death wouldn't be just another folded-up tragedy. <words>286</words>  He would make them pay. <words>288</words>
