Before the first prayer was whispered by a mortal, the nectar collection facility hummed with a different kind of devotion. <words>16</words>
Giant, iridescent flowers dripped golden liquid into shimmering basins, their perfume thick and heady. <words>24</words>
Aella, a sentient doll collector with eyes like polished obsidian, stood expectantly resigned amidst the saccharine air, a twisted carnival cane clutched in her porcelain hand. <words>39</words>
She was not here for nectar. <words>42</words>
She was here to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, to breach the veil between worlds. <words>52</words>
The cane, a relic from a forgotten carnival, pulsed with a faint, internal light, guiding her. <words>61</words>
Its twisted form mirrored the paths of stars etched onto the facility’s translucent walls, a celestial map only she could decipher. <words>73</words>
By following star paths, Aella would uphold the chorus of healing, a symphony of whispers that existed before language, before gods, before the very concept of prayer. <words>90</words>
This chorus, a vibration of pure intent, was fading, threatened by the encroaching whispers of mortal desires. <words>100</words>
Aella’s dolls, each a vessel for a fragment of the chorus, lined her pockets, their tiny, painted faces turned expectantly towards the facility’s core. <words>113</words>
The nectar, she knew, was not just sustenance for the ethereal beings that tended the flowers, but a conduit for the chorus itself. <words>125</words>
By disrupting the flow, by redirecting the nectar towards her dolls, she could amplify the chorus, strengthen it against the coming tide of mortal prayers. <words>140</words>
Her porcelain fingers tightened around the cane. <words>144</words>
The air crackled with ethereal grit, a tangible tension between the sacred and the profane. <words>152</words>
Aella moved, her steps precise and deliberate, following the star paths etched on the walls. <words>160</words>
Each step was a transgression, a rebellion against the established order. <words>166</words>
Yet, her face remained expectantly resigned, a mask of serene determination. <words>173</words>
She knew the risks. <words>175</words>
She knew the price. <words>177</words>
But the chorus of healing must be upheld, even if it meant shattering the sanctity of this pre-prayer world. <words>189</words>
The twisted carnival cane pulsed brighter, guiding her towards the heart of the nectar flow, towards the source of the chorus, towards the boundary she was destined to cross. <words>207</words>
The ethereal grit intensified, the air shimmering around her like disturbed water. <words>215</words>
The dolls in her pockets hummed, their tiny voices joining the fading chorus, a defiant whisper against the silence that was soon to be filled with the clamor of mortal pleas. <words>235</words>
Aella reached the central basin, the nectar within swirling like liquid gold. <words>242</words>
She raised the twisted carnival cane, its tip glowing with an otherworldly light. <words>250</words>
The ethereal grit reached a crescendo, the air vibrating with the power of her intent. <words>258</words>
With a resolute movement, she plunged the cane into the basin, disrupting the flow, redirecting the nectar, upholding the chorus of healing in a world on the cusp of prayer. <words>277</words>
