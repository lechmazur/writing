The ambivalent prophet, happily sad, stared at the cracked collection of marbles. <words>11</words>
Between heartbeats, a flicker of bashful arrogance crossed his face in the lunar mining colony. <words>22</words>
His motivation, to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, pulsed with each shallow breath. <words>30</words>
The final oath weighed heavy, a promise whispered between the stars and the dust of the moon. <words>41</words>
He had to defragment the oath, shatter its rigid structure, and scatter its pieces across the universe. <words>53</words>
In a rummage sale box, discarded amongst chipped teacups and faded photographs, he found his method: jigsaw puzzle edges. <words>66</words>
Each piece, a fragment of a forgotten image, held a strange power, a resonance with the cosmic order. <words>77</words>
He held a chipped edge of a puzzle piece depicting a sunflower against a cerulean sky, its vibrant yellow a stark contrast to the grey lunar landscape. <words>93</words>
He pressed it against a marble, whispering a fragment of the oath, a disjointed phrase of cosmic law. <words>103</words>
The marble hummed, a low thrum that vibrated through his fingertips, and a hairline crack spiderwebbed across its surface. <words>115</words>
He repeated the process with another edge, a piece of a roaring lion's mane, and another marble fractured. <words>125</words>
Between heartbeats, he worked, a frantic dance of bashful arrogance and happily sad determination. <words>135</words>
Each puzzle piece, each fragment of the oath, chipped away at the integrity of the marbles, mirroring the fragmentation he sought in the cosmic scoreboard. <words>151</words>
The lunar mining colony, a beacon of human ambition in the vast emptiness of space, became his workshop of cosmic rebellion. <words>164</words>
He saw the scoreboard in his mind's eye, a rigid grid of celestial achievements and failures, a testament to a universe obsessed with order. <words>179</words>
He, the ambivalent prophet, would introduce chaos, a beautiful, shimmering disarray. <words>187</words>
He would rewrite the rules, not with grand pronouncements or fiery pronouncements, but with the quiet, happily sad defragmentation of cosmic law. <words>201</words>
The cracked marbles, once perfect spheres of celestial energy, now pulsed with a chaotic energy, reflecting the fragmented oath. <words>214</words>
He gathered them, his collection of broken promises, his tools of cosmic disruption. <words>222</words>
Between heartbeats, he felt the shift, the subtle tremor in the fabric of the universe. <words>231</words>
The scoreboard flickered, lines blurring, numbers rearranging themselves in a dizzying dance. <words>240</words>
A smile, both bashful and arrogant, touched his lips. <words>245</words>
He had taken the final oath, not to uphold it, but to shatter it, to defragment it, to scramble the cosmic scoreboard. <words>260</words>
And in the lunar mining colony, between heartbeats, a happily sad prophet watched the universe rewrite itself. <words>270</words>
