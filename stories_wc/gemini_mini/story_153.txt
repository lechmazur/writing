The last star had sputtered out eons ago, leaving the surface world a frozen wasteland. <words>14</words>
Kaito, an eternal college student pursuing a degree in immortality, now resided in the subterranean city of the mole people, its mundanely glorious tunnels lit by bioluminescent fungi. <words>34</words>
His motivation, a detached devotion to mastering his own reality, led him to a peculiar discovery: a coal miner’s headlamp from a collapsed mine, miraculously still functional. <words>54</words>
It was a relic of a bygone era, a time when humans still clung to the dying embers of the sun. <words>67</words>
Kaito saw in it not a tool, but a key. <words>72</words>
He believed the headlamp held the secret to digitizing consciousness, a crucial step in his quest for immortality. <words>84</words>
The mole people, adapted to their lightless world, couldn't comprehend his fascination with the archaic device. <words>96</words>
Their gifted burden was their perfect adaptation, a blindness to the possibilities beyond their subterranean world. <words>108</words>
Kaito, however, carried a different burden: the relentless pursuit of a future he might never reach. <words>119</words>
He sought a method to transfer his consciousness, to escape the confines of his physical form. <words>130</words>
His research led him to an ancient library, a repository of forgotten knowledge. <words>138</words>
There, he discovered a collection of travel journals, meticulously detailing the lives of individuals across different eras. <words>150</words>
He theorized that by digitizing these journals and interweaving his own consciousness into their narratives, he could achieve a form of digital immortality. <words>165</words>
He would swap his present reality for a curated existence within the digitized past. <words>174</words>
The headlamp, with its focused beam, became his digitization tool. <words>180</words>
He painstakingly scanned each page, the headlamp’s light illuminating the faded ink, translating the analog words into digital code. <words>195</words>
The process was slow, a testament to his detached devotion. <words>201</words>
Days bled into weeks, weeks into months. <words>206</words>
The mundanely glorious routine of scanning, coding, and integrating became his new reality. <words>216</words>
He lived within the flickering circle of the headlamp’s light, a small, self-made universe in the heart of the earth. <words>229</words>
As he digitized the final journal, a sense of anticipation, almost alien to his detached nature, stirred within him. <words>242</words>
He uploaded his consciousness, a stream of data merging with the digitized narratives. <words>250</words>
The headlamp flickered, then died. <words>254</words>
The underground city, with its bioluminescent glow, faded from his awareness. <words>262</words>
Kaito was no longer bound to the physical world, a master of his own meticulously crafted, digitized reality. <words>274</words>
He had traded the burden of his singular existence for the infinite possibilities of the past. <words>284</words>
The gifted burden of his relentless pursuit had finally borne fruit, a mundanely glorious triumph in the face of eternal darkness. <words>299</words>
