The forthright peddler, Silas, hummed along to the universe's secret song, a low thrum that vibrated through the abandoned space station's medical bay. <words>18</words>
Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through cracked windows, illuminating the faded medical insignia on the wall. <words>28</words>
He was alone, joyfully alone, a feeling he hadn't experienced since before the oath, sealed in blood, had bound him to a life he no longer recognized. <words>44</words>
Silas placed the dried flower bouquet, a memento of a life he yearned to reclaim, on a rusting metal table. <words>55</words>
His mission: to break the oath. <words>58</words>
His method: sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns downloaded from the station's derelict communication hub. <words>68</words>
He believed the key to his redemption's path lay hidden within the whispers and half-truths of the galaxy's elite. <words>79</words>
Silas began to divide the information, meticulously separating fact from fiction, rumor from revelation. <words>88</words>

She was rumored to be hiding on a remote mining asteroid, far from the prying eyes of the authorities. <words>150</words>
Hope, a fragile flower blooming in the desolate landscape of his heart, began to grow. <words>159</words>
He divided his meager supplies, preparing for the long journey ahead. <words>165</words>
The dried flower bouquet, a symbol of the life he was fighting for, would accompany him. <words>174</words>
He would find Lysandra. <words>176</words>
He would break the oath. <words>178</words>
He would walk the path of redemption, even if it meant traversing the darkest corners of the galaxy. <words>189</words>
The joyful loneliness that had filled him in the abandoned medical bay began to transform. <words>199</words>
It was still tinged with solitude, but now, it was infused with purpose. <words>206</words>
He was no longer adrift in the vastness of space, but sailing towards a specific destination, guided by the whispers he had so diligently unearthed. <words>222</words>
The universe hummed its secret song, a melody of hope and resilience, as Silas stepped out of the medical bay and into the unknown. <words>235</words>
He left the abandoned space station behind, a relic of his past life, and embarked on his journey, the dried flower bouquet clutched tightly in his hand, a beacon of hope in the vast, humming universe. <words>260</words>
