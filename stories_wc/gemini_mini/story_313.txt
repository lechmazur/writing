Bartholomew, a small-time con artist unusually normal for the dystopian farm they called Dustbowl, sat on an overturned milk crate. <words>17</words>
It was story time, a mandated hour of saccharine propaganda blasted from rusty loudspeakers across the fields. <words>28</words>
But Bartholomew wasn't listening. <words>30</words>
He held an empty tape dispenser, its clear plastic shell reflecting the sickly orange sunset. <words>38</words>
The lull of remorse, a rare visitor in his hardened heart, settled upon him. <words>46</words>
He needed comfort, a way to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin in its face. <words>55</words>
So, he interrogated ghostly apparitions. <words>59</words>
Not real ghosts, of course, but the flickering, half-formed memories of his past cons, projected onto the dusty air by the tape dispenser, held like a makeshift crystal ball. <words>81</words>
“Old Man Hemlock,” he muttered, focusing on a shimmering image of a grizzled farmer he’d once swindled out of a week’s worth of nutrient paste. <words>97</words>
“Why’d you fall for it, eh? <words>100</words>
My sob story about a sick cyber-chicken?” <words>105</words>
The phantom Hemlock just sighed, a wisp of digitized sound from the dispenser’s tiny, defunct speaker, a relic from a time when such things held actual tape. <words>124</words>
“Desperation, son,” the ghost rasped. <words>127</words>
“Same as you.” <words>129</words>
Bartholomew shifted uncomfortably. <words>131</words>
The ghost was right. <words>133</words>
His cons, petty as they were, were fueled by the same gnawing hunger that plagued everyone in Dustbowl. <words>145</words>
He wasn’t taunting defeat, he was embracing it, finding a strange solace in the shared misery. <words>156</words>
He flicked the dispenser, the image of Hemlock dissolving into static. <words>163</words>
Next, he conjured the spectral form of Mrs. Abernathy, the baker he’d tricked with a counterfeit ration coupon. <words>175</words>
“You should have known better,” he mumbled, a mild fervor creeping into his voice. <words>183</words>
“That coupon was printed on recycled toilet paper.” <words>188</words>
Mrs. Abernathy’s ghost simply smiled, a sad, knowing smile. <words>194</words>
“A little hope is worth more than a loaf of bread sometimes, Bartholomew.” <words>202</words>
The dispenser sputtered, the battery finally giving out. <words>207</words>
The apparitions vanished, leaving Bartholomew alone with the orange dust and the droning propaganda. <words>217</words>
He looked at the empty tape dispenser, a symbol of his hollow victories. <words>225</words>
The remorse, no longer a lull, washed over him in a wave. <words>233</words>
But within it, a strange sense of peace. <words>238</words>
He wasn't grinning at defeat, not quite. <words>242</words>
But he wasn't cowering from it either. <words>246</words>
He was simply sitting with it, finding a strange comfort in its familiarity. <words>254</words>
The propaganda continued, its empty promises echoing in the twilight. <words>261</words>
Bartholomew closed his eyes, the empty tape dispenser clutched in his hand, a small, hard lump against his palm. <words>274</words>
He was home.
