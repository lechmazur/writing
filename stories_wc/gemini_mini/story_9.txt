The mildly panicked soothsayer squinted at the water rings on the battered wooden bar top, a maze of billboards looming in the neon-lit desert behind him. <words>20</words>
Between lost years, in this forgotten corner of the world, destiny felt less like a river and more like a stagnant puddle. <words>33</words>
He magnified the concentric circles, his brow furrowed, muttering, "Oh, joy, another cryptic message from the universe. Probably unlikely, but what isn't these days?" <words>49</words>
His motivation, as always, was to shape destiny with his bare hands, a task that felt increasingly like trying to knit a sweater out of tumbleweeds. <words>64</words>
The pocket puzzle box with 13 locks sat heavy in his pocket, a constant reminder of the weight of the future. <words>75</words>
Each lock represented a crucial step in his grand plan for environmental stewardship, a plan that currently looked as feasible as terraforming Mars with a garden hose. <words>92</words>
"Let's see," he drawled, tracing a particularly wobbly ring with his finger, "if I interpret this correctly, the fate of the planet rests onâ€¦ a misplaced comma in a recycling pamphlet?" <words>111</words>
He sighed, the molten sarcasm dripping from his voice like hot tar. <words>117</words>
"Well, that's just great. I spend years deciphering ancient prophecies, mastering the art of hydromancy via bar spills, and it all comes down to punctuation." <words>136</words>
He picked up the puzzle box, the cool metal a stark contrast to the desert heat. <words>144</words>
"Thirteen locks," he murmured, "thirteen chances to avert ecological disaster, all hinging on the grammatical prowess of some underpaid intern." <words>160</words>
He shook his head, the neon glow of the billboards painting his face in a kaleidoscope of garish colors. <words>170</words>
"This," he declared, with a weary flourish, "is why I drink." <words>175</words>
He signaled to the bartender, a stoic figure who looked like he'd witnessed the rise and fall of several civilizations. <words>186</words>
"Another round," he said, pushing his glass across the bar, "and if you see a misplaced comma anywhere, for the love of all that is green, fix it." <words>203</words>
The bartender grunted, a sound that could have been agreement, amusement, or the rumbling of an impending earthquake. <words>214</words>
The soothsayer leaned back against the bar, the weight of the world, or at least a misplaced comma, pressing down on him. <words>226</words>
He knew, deep down, that his methods were probably unlikely to yield any tangible results. <words>235</words>
But in this maze of billboards, in this neon-lit desert of lost years, what else was there to do but read the water rings and hope for the best? <words>252</words>
He magnified another ripple, a faint tremor in the otherwise still water. <words>258</words>
Maybe, just maybe, this one held the key. <words>262</words>
Or maybe it was just another spilled drink, another echo of a forgotten prophecy, another reminder of the absurdity of it all. <words>278</words>
He chuckled, a dry, rasping sound that echoed through the empty bar. <words>284</words>
"Destiny," he muttered, "you've got a sick sense of humor." <words>289</words>
He took a deep breath, the desert air thick with the scent of dust and despair. <words>296</words>
He had thirteen locks to pick, a planet to save, and a misplaced comma to find. <words>305</words>
And all he had to work with was a battered bar top, a pocketful of improbable hope, and a healthy dose of molten sarcasm. <words>319</words>
He picked up his refilled glass, the ice clinking softly against the glass. <words>326</words>
"Here's to unlikely probabilities," he toasted, raising his glass to the neon-lit void. <words>334</words>
He took a long drink, the cool liquid a temporary reprieve from the desert heat and the weight of his self-imposed mission. <words>348</words>
He knew it was probably a fool's errand, but in the space between lost years, even fools had their roles to play. <words>360</words>
And he, the mildly panicked soothsayer, was ready to play his part. <words>367</words>
