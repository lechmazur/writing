A drone pilot, ripped from his time and flung into a medieval fantasy realm, stood in an abandoned observatory perched precariously on a cliff. <words>20</words>
The hush before the orchard’s destruction hung heavy in the air, a charred serenity settling over the landscape. <words>30</words>
He was cynically hopeful, clutching a dried herb bundle like a talisman. <words>36</words>
He’d found it during a bizarre encounter at a speed dating event in the local village – a gathering as anachronistic as he was. <words>50</words>
A wizened woman, smelling of woodsmoke and prophecy, had pressed it into his hand, whispering about horizons of mercy. <words>60</words>
He’d scoffed, but the words, like the scent, lingered. <words>65</words>
Now, staring at the impending doom of the orchard, he understood. <words>71</words>
The trees, laden with memories and sustenance, represented more than just fruit; they were the last vestiges of hope in a world sliding towards despair. <words>88</words>
His drone, miraculously still functional, hummed softly beside him. <words>94</words>
It was his only link to a world he might never see again, a world of technology and instant gratification, a world he now realized he’d taken for granted. <words>115</words>
He crushed the dried herb bundle, releasing its pungent aroma. <words>121</words>
It smelled of resilience, of defiance, of the stubborn refusal to surrender. <words>129</words>
An idea sparked in his mind, a flicker of possibility in the encroaching darkness. <words>138</words>
He would disseminate the herbs, using his drone to scatter them across the valley. <words>146</words>
The scent, he hoped, would reach the hearts of those about to swing their axes, reminding them of the beauty they were about to destroy. <words>160</words>
It was a long shot, a desperate gamble, but it was all he had. <words>168</words>
He loaded the crushed herbs into a small compartment he’d fashioned for carrying emergency rations, now repurposed for a different kind of sustenance – hope. <words>186</words>
He programmed the drone to fly a specific pattern, a spiral outwards from the observatory, covering the entire valley below. <words>198</words>
As the drone ascended, the scent of the herbs, carried by the wind, began to drift towards the approaching woodcutters. <words>210</words>
He watched, his heart a knot of charred serenity, as the drone became a tiny speck against the vast, indifferent sky. <words>222</words>
He didn't know if it would work. <words>225</words>
He didn't know if the horizons of mercy would expand to encompass this doomed orchard. <words>234</words>
But in that moment of hushed anticipation, he felt a sliver of something he hadn’t felt in a long time – a flicker of genuine, uncynical hope. <words>251</words>
The drone, a tiny messenger of possibility, buzzed against the backdrop of impending loss, a testament to the enduring human capacity to lure hope from the brink of despair. <words>272</words>
He closed his eyes, inhaling the lingering scent of the herbs, a charred serenity settling over him like a shroud. <words>283</words>
He was ready to face whatever came next. <words>287</words>
