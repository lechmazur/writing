The calm assassin, Wei, stood in the ancient Chinese palace gardens, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and impending doom. <words>16</words>
He carried a botanical press, an odd tool for his trade, but essential for his current task. <words>26</words>
Before the first question could even form on the Emperor’s lips, Wei needed to amalgamate the whispers of longing permeating the palace into something tangible, something he could manipulate. <words>47</words>
His motivation wasn’t malicious, not entirely; he aimed to spin a prophecy, whispered from concubine to eunuch, into raw possibility. <words>61</words>
The prophecy, figuratively literal in its absurdity, foretold the Emperor’s demise by “a thousand fluttering sorrows.” <words>71</words>
Wei, a man of practical solutions and darkly humorous inclinations, found the imagery rather inspiring. <words>80</words>
A thousand fluttering sorrows? <words>83</words>
Why not make it real? <words>86</words>
He chuckled, a low rumble in his chest, the sound swallowed by the vastness of the palace. <words>96</words>
The unease, however, was palpable, a shimmering heat radiating from the meticulously pruned bonsai trees. <words>107</words>
Wei opened the botanical press, revealing not dried flowers, but meticulously collected butterfly wings. <words>118</words>
Each wing held a fragment of a whispered longing, carefully captured by Wei over the past moon cycle. <words>130</words>
Longing for power, for love, for freedom, for a taste of the sweet dumplings sold in the market outside the palace walls. <words>144</words>
Wei’s plan was simple, yet audacious: to amalgamate these longings, by the pattern of a butterfly's wings, into a single, potent force. <words>158</words>
He would create a thousand fluttering sorrows, not to kill the Emperor, but to reshape his destiny. <words>170</words>
The prophecy spoke of demise, but Wei saw an opportunity for transformation. <words>179</words>
Perhaps a thousand fluttering sorrows could break the Emperor’s rigid adherence to tradition, force him to confront the simmering discontent within his own palace. <words>198</words>
Perhaps it could even inspire him to try those delicious dumplings. <words>205</words>
Wei carefully arranged the wings, following the intricate veins and scales, each placement imbued with a specific longing. <words>218</words>
He hummed a tuneless melody, a counterpoint to the whispers that now swirled around him, growing in intensity. <words>230</words>
The air crackled with a strange energy, a mixture of hope and despair, of anticipation and dread. <words>241</words>
The humorous unease intensified, a tightrope walk between creation and chaos. <words>249</words>
Wei felt a thrill course through him, the exhilaration of playing with fate. <words>258</words>
He pressed the cover of the botanical press closed, the whispers now trapped, ready to be unleashed. <words>269</words>
The prophecy would be fulfilled, but not as anyone expected. <words>276</words>
Wei smiled, a slow, almost predatory curve of his lips. <words>283</words>
The game had begun. <words>286</words>
