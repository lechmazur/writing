An irate smuggler, known as Jax, pounded the abandoned spaceport’s flight deck, his breath ragged puffs in the frigid air. <words>16</words>
He wasn’t supposed to be jogging, not here, not now, but his heart, a clenched fist in his chest, demanded it. <words>28</words>
It revolted against the stillness, the suffocating memories that clung to the peeling paint and rusting consoles like abstractly physical ghosts. <words>41</words>
He needed to find the hidden waterfalls, whispered legends of the old pilots, oases of serenity in this desolate wasteland. <words>53</words>
Jax stopped, his gaze snagging on a single chopstick lying amidst the debris, a starkly elegant line against the decay. <words>64</words>
He picked it up, its smooth surface cool against his palm, a jarring contrast to the rough, biting sincerity of his surroundings. <words>76</words>
He knew this chopstick. <words>78</words>
It was Elara’s, his lost partner, the one who’d believed in the waterfalls more than anyone. <words>88</words>
He’d lost her here, among the whispering ghosts of failed launches and broken dreams. <words>97</words>
He needed to memorialize her, to mark her absence in a way that felt as real and tangible as the ache in his chest. <words>110</words>
He knelt, scooping up a handful of dust and letting it sift through his fingers, a gritty, abstractly physical representation of his grief. <words>123</words>
He found a cracked ceramic cup, a relic of a bygone era, and filled it with the melted ice clinging to a broken pipe. <words>136</words>
He stirred the dust into the water, creating a murky brew, and then, with Elara’s chopstick, he began to draw patterns in the swirling tea leaves. <words>150</words>
Each stroke was a memory, a shared laugh, a whispered confidence, a biting sincerity that cut through the pretense of their dangerous lives. <words>164</words>
He drew a spiral, representing their dizzying escapes, a jagged line for their near misses, a circle for the wholeness they’d found in each other. <words>179</words>
The patterns shifted and swirled, abstractly physical manifestations of their shared history, a silent testament to a love lost amidst the stars. <words>193</words>
He continued his ritual, his heart’s revolt slowly quieting as he poured his grief into the swirling patterns. <words>204</words>
He wasn’t just jogging; he was mapping his heart, charting the course of his loss, using the single chopstick as his compass. <words>218</words>
The waterfalls, he realized, weren’t a place, but a feeling, a yearning for peace that he now carried within him, etched in the tea leaves, memorialized by a single, elegant chopstick. <words>238</words>
He stood, the biting sincerity of his grief softened by a fragile hope, and continued his jog, the rhythm of his feet a steady beat against the silence of the abandoned spaceport. <words>256</words>
He knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his bones, that Elara’s spirit, abstractly physical yet undeniably present, was running alongside him, guiding him towards the hidden waterfalls of his own heart. <words>277</words>
