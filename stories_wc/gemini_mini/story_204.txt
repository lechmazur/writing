The hush before the Galactic Cuddling Awards acceptance speech was thick enough to spread on toast. <words>14</words>  A phantom train ticket punch, cold and metallic in her sweaty palm, pulsed with an unusually usual rhythm. <words>25</words>  Elara, professional cuddler extraordinaire, felt the weight of the abandoned spaceport hangar pressing down, the decay of forgotten dreams clinging to the air like rust. <words>42</words>  This was it, her moment, but her mind drifted back to a chance encounter at a farmer's market that had changed everything. <words>54</words>

She'd seen him, Grobnar, a hulking K'tharr with scales the color of bruised plums, buying space-rhubarb. <words>64</words>  K'tharr were known for their prickly personalities and aversion to touch, the unspoken rules of interspecies relations dictating a wide berth. <words>78</words>  Elara, however, felt a strange pull, an ancient novelty stirring within her. <words>86</words>  She'd always harbored a deep-seated prejudice against K'tharr, stemming from a childhood incident involving a stolen plush moon-bunny. <words>99</words>  But something about Grobnar's melancholic air, the way he gently cradled the rhubarb, chipped away at her preconceived notions. <words>112</words>

She offered him a free cuddle sample, a bold move even by her standards. <words>119</words>  He'd recoiled initially, his spines bristling, but then, with a hesitant glance, he'd accepted. <words>129</words>  The moment their skin touched, a strange energy flowed between them, a silent understanding that transcended words and species. <words>141</words>  The phantom train ticket punch, a relic from her grandmother, a conductor on the long-defunct Lunar Express, warmed in her pocket. <words>154</words>  It was a symbol of connection, of journeys taken and destinations reached. <words>161</words>

That encounter had sparked a revolution in Elara's practice. <words>166</words>  She began specializing in cross-species cuddling, breaking down barriers and challenging the unspoken rules that kept beings apart. <words>179</words>  The decay of the old hangar, a testament to abandoned dreams, now felt like a fertile ground for new beginnings. <words>191</words>  The unusually usual rhythm of the ticket punch echoed the beat of her heart, a reminder of the chance encounter that had led her here. <words>204</words>  She was no longer just a cuddler; she was a bridge builder, a weaver of connections in a galaxy desperately in need of touch. <words>218</words>

The hush deepened, the anticipation palpable. <words>221</words>  Elara took a deep breath, the ancient novelty of her journey settling in her bones. <words>230</words>  She clutched the phantom train ticket punch, a tangible link to her past and a symbol of the future she was creating. <words>243</words>  She was ready to accept her award, not just for herself, but for all the beings she had touched, and all the unspoken rules she had helped to break. <words>260</words>  The decay of the old hangar seemed to fade, replaced by the vibrant energy of a galaxy embracing connection. <words>271</words>
