The skeptical minstrel, Finn, squinted at the dragon-scale armor scrap, its emerald sheen shimmering even in the dim light of the disappearing ink factory. <words>17</words>
At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, an eerie silence blanketed the abandoned building, broken only by the hiss of an ancient steam vent. <words>33</words>
Finn’s plan, impossibly plausible as it was, hinged on this scrap, this vent, and his reckless generosity. <words>44</words>
He intended to out-scheme Malkor, an immortal trickster known for his elaborate cons and cruel jokes, a feat most considered impossible. <words>57</words>
Malkor had recently bragged about his invulnerability, claiming nothing short of a dragon's breath could harm him. <words>66</words>
Finn, however, had a different interpretation of "dragon's breath." <words>70</words>
He’d discovered that the steam vent, when precisely manipulated, could produce a concentrated burst of scalding air, hot enough to melt lead. <words>83</words>
The dragon scale, incredibly heat resistant, would protect a small object placed within its concave curve from the intense heat. <words>94</words>
That object? <words>95</words>
A vial of the factory's disappearing ink, modified by Finn to reappear after a set period. <words>105</words>
Finn’s reckless generosity came into play with the bait: a seemingly priceless gemstone, rumored to grant wishes. <words>116</words>
He knew Malkor couldn't resist such a prize. <words>120</words>
Finn carefully placed the gem inside the dragon scale, then positioned it beneath the vent, adjusting the pressure via a series of rusty valves. <words>133</words>
He attached the scale to a makeshift slingshot fashioned from scavenged rubber tubing and a forked branch. <words>143</words>
The plan was to slingshot the gem, encased in the dragon scale, directly at Malkor when he appeared to claim his "prize." <words>155</words>
The steam vent would blast the scale, heating it to an extreme temperature, but leaving the gem untouched. <words>165</words>
Malkor, believing he'd acquired a magical artifact, would pocket it. <words>171</words>
Later, when the ink reappeared, the gem would vanish, leaving Malkor with nothing but a sooty residue and a bruised ego. <words>183</words>
Finn chuckled, a sound echoing with irreverent awe. <words>188</words>
He knew the risks. <words>190</words>
Malkor was powerful and vengeful. <words>193</words>
But the thought of outsmarting the immortal trickster filled him with a giddy anticipation. <words>202</words>
He strummed a quick chord on his lute, a jaunty tune for a potentially disastrous gamble. <words>210</words>
The hiss of the steam vent intensified, a dragon's breath waiting to be unleashed. <words>218</words>
Finn, the skeptical minstrel, was ready to play his tune. <words>224</words>
He loaded the slingshot, the dragon scale gleaming in the fading light of the disappearing ink factory, a stage set for a performance of impossibly plausible trickery. <words>242</words>
The hush of the empty mailbox at midday held a pregnant silence, the calm before the storm of Finn's reckless generosity. <words>254</words>
He waited, his eyes fixed on the spot where Malkor would appear, a mischievous glint in his eyes, a song of irreverent awe on his lips. <words>270</words>
