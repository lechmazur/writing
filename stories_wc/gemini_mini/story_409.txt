The bruised fighter, ribs aching, knuckles swollen, stumbled through the dusty attic. <words>11</words>
Clockwork monkeys chattered from cobwebbed shelves, their gears grinding like rusty memories. <words>20</words>
He was skillfully incompetent, a master of losing gracefully, a virtuoso of self-sabotage. <words>30</words>
At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, a tremor ran through the attic, shaking dust motes into swirling galaxies. <words>44</words>
This was his moment, the instant he’d chosen to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception. <words>55</words>
He had to stand for something, even if it was just the right to lose on his own terms. <words>66</words>
He kicked aside a rusted birdcage, its tiny occupant long since turned to dust. <words>75</words>
His eyes, dark and bruised like the rest of him, fixed on a clay pot shard protruding from a pile of moth-eaten velvet curtains. <words>89</words>
An inscription, barely legible beneath layers of grime, hinted at a forgotten language. <words>98</words>
He picked it up, the rough edges scraping against his calloused palm. <words>105</words>
The inscription pulsed with a faint warmth. <words>109</words>
He knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his battered soul, that this shard was the key. <words>121</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the forgotten dreams, the pathways between waking and slumber, the spaces where reality frayed at the edges. <words>139</words>
Through these forgotten dreams, he would abduct the last lie he told himself, the comforting fiction that he wasn't choosing to fail. <words>155</words>
The attic shimmered, the clockwork animals blurring into streaks of brass and gears. <words>164</words>
The shard pulsed brighter, the inscription burning into his skin, a brand of truth. <words>173</words>
He felt a resistance, a clinging to the familiar comfort of defeat. <words>181</words>
But he held on, the shard digging into his flesh, a physical manifestation of his resolve. <words>192</words>
He pulled, hard, tearing away the illusion, the carefully constructed narrative of his own inadequacy. <words>203</words>
The attic snapped back into focus, the clockwork animals frozen mid-motion. <words>211</words>
He opened his eyes, the dust motes settling around him like fallen stars. <words>219</words>
The shard was cool now, the inscription faded. <words>224</words>
He looked at his hand, expecting a wound, but there was nothing. <words>231</words>
Only a faint tingling, a ghost of the pain, a reminder of the lie he had excised. <words>241</words>
He stood there, in the dusty attic, surrounded by the silent witnesses of his private victory. <words>251</words>
He was still bruised, still broken, still skillfully incompetent. <words>258</words>
But now, he was free. <words>260</words>
Free from the self-imposed shackles of self-deception. <words>266</words>
Free to choose his own path, even if it led to ruin. <words>274</words>
He stood for something now. <words>278</words>
He stood for himself. <words>280</words>
