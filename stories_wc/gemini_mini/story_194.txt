A spirited lumberjack named Silas, gracefully awkward in his movements, pedaled his bike through the dense forest, the ancient ossuary-turned-gourmet-restaurant his destination. <words>20</words>
Throughout these bike rides, reawakened nightmares plagued him, cryptic visions of a future war. <words>30</words>

The restaurant, "Bone Appetit," was Silas's latest revamp project, a bizarre attempt to reconcile his harsh tenderness. <words>51</words>

One evening, tucked beneath a velvet cushion in a booth made from a ribcage, he found it â€“ a coded letter from that future war. <words>74</words>
The elegant script, scorched at the edges, spoke of a world ravaged by conflict, a world Silas was increasingly convinced he was meant to prevent. <words>88</words>
