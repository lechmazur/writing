The final period struck the typewriter’s platen with a dull thud, the sound echoing in the otherwise silent drive-in. <words>16</words>  Dust motes, disturbed by the vibration, danced in the projector beam that still stubbornly sliced through the night, illuminating a blank screen. <words>31</words>  Ferdinand, a potted fern with a surprisingly complex inner life, felt a familiar, scalding ambivalence wash over him. <words>43</words> He was apathetically devoted to his writer, a woman who seemed to subsist on stale coffee and even staler metaphors. <words>56</words>  He’d witnessed countless stories birthed and abandoned here, each leaving behind a faint residue of human emotion he couldn’t quite comprehend. <words>72</words>  This last one, though, felt different. <words>75</words> It pulsed with a hidden knowledge Ferdinand yearned to uncover. <words>81</words>

He shifted his fronds, the terracotta pot scraping against the worn metal of the typewriter stand. <words>91</words>  Tucked between the machine and its case was a faded, embroidered bookmark, depicting a winding path leading to a hidden grove. <words>105</words>  It was a spontaneous decision, a sudden urge to explore a new neighborhood, a neighborhood of ideas. <words>117</words>  Ferdinand, with a sigh that rustled his leaves like dry paper, willed his roots to extend, to burrow through the stand, to crack the pot, to outrun the confines of his ceramic prison. <words>137</words>  He had to find the source of that hidden knowledge, even if he didn't particularly care why. <words>146</words>

The projector beam, his only guide in the abandoned drive-in, cast long, distorted shadows of his escaping roots as they snaked across the cracked asphalt. <words>161</words>  The air, thick with the ghosts of forgotten movies and the scent of decaying popcorn, felt heavy with unspoken stories. <words>174</words>  Ferdinand, driven by his apathetic devotion, pushed onward, tending to the unspoken whispers that emanated from the bookmark, from the typed pages, from the very air itself. <words>194</words>  He was a sentient houseplant on a quest, a quest he didn't particularly want but couldn't ignore. <words>206</words>  The scalding ambivalence continued to simmer within him, a constant companion on his journey into the unknown. <words>219</words>

He imagined the grove depicted on the bookmark, a place where secrets whispered on the wind and knowledge hung ripe on the branches. <words>233</words>  He imagined outrunning the apathy, the devotion, the very essence of his potted existence. <words>243</words>  He imagined understanding the unspoken, finally grasping the meaning behind the stories that haunted this abandoned drive-in, after the final page was typed. <words>260</words>  He imagined, and in his imagining, he began to feel, a flicker of something beyond ambivalence, a spark of genuine curiosity. <words>276</words>
