A lone trapper, Elias, sat perched on the edge of the floating observatory's rusting platform, the wind whipping his weathered face. <words>16</words>
Between shifts, this was his ritual. <words>20</words>
He needed to siphon radiance, a shimmering, silently audible energy, from the black hole of doubt that gnawed at his soul. <words>32</words>
The observatory, a precarious structure of salvaged metal and flickering neon, drifted in the inky blackness above a churning gas giant. <words>45</words>
Elias clutched a piece of sea glass, smooth and frosted, a relic from a forgotten ocean world. <words>54</words>
It was a tangible reminder of loss, but also, strangely, of hope. <words>61</words>
The upside of loss, he’d learned, was the space it created for something new. <words>70</words>
He’d found the sea glass tucked within a canister of microfilm he’d liberated, by decoding microfilm from shady archives, during a previous expedition. <words>85</words>
The microfilm detailed a project to harness the energy of dying stars, a project abandoned when the risks outweighed the potential rewards. <words>99</words>
Elias, however, saw potential in the discarded data. <words>104</words>
He believed the same principle could be applied to his own inner darkness. <words>112</words>
He squinted at the swirling vortex of the gas giant below, a miniature black hole of swirling chaos. <words>122</words>
The observatory’s instruments, cobbled together from scavenged parts, hummed with a gritty whimsy, a symphony of clicks and whirs that echoed the trapper’s own resilient spirit. <words>140</words>
He closed his eyes, the silently audible hum of the observatory resonating within him. <words>149</words>
He focused on the sea glass, its smooth surface a tactile anchor in the vastness of space. <words>159</words>
He imagined the microfilm’s intricate schematics, the forgotten equations for capturing stellar energy. <words>168</words>
He began to recommence the project, not to harness the energy of stars, but to siphon the radiance from his own internal void. <words>182</words>
He breathed deeply, drawing in the silently audible energy that pulsed around him. <words>190</words>
He felt a flicker of warmth, a spark of hope igniting within the darkness. <words>199</words>
The sea glass, a symbol of what was lost, became a conduit for what could be gained. <words>209</words>
The upside of loss, he realized, wasn’t just the space it created, but the energy it released. <words>220</words>
It was the potential for transformation, for rebirth. <words>226</words>
He opened his eyes, the gas giant swirling below. <words>231</words>
The black hole of doubt still churned within him, but it no longer consumed him. <words>241</words>
It was now a source of power, a well of raw energy waiting to be harnessed. <words>251</words>
He smiled, a rare and genuine expression on his weathered face. <words>258</words>
He slipped the sea glass into his pocket, a tangible reminder of the upside of loss. <words>268</words>
He stood up, ready to recommence his shift, his spirit renewed, his purpose clarified. <words>278</words>
The silently audible hum of the observatory accompanied him as he walked back inside, a gritty whimsy soundtrack to his ongoing journey of self-discovery. <words>297</words>
