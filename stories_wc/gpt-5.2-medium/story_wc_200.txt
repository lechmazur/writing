<story>In the hush of a hidden sunrise, Echo Gorge held its breath between black cliffs and pale mist. [18] Mara walked the gravel switchbacks with a lantern unlit, modestly fearless in a place that loved echoes. [35] She was a lost soul collector, paid by the river towns to bring back the ones who wandered after death. [55] Not chains or threats guided her work, but listening, because every soul arrived with a confession stuck in its throat. [75] In Echo Gorge, those spectral confessions could be heard only through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp. [93] The harp waited in a cave like a ribcage, its frame warped by an old rockfall and years of damp. [113] Mara carried no pick, only a crocodile's tooth on a cord, rubbed smooth by anxious fingers. [129] She had taken it from the mouth of a swamp godling long ago, after she made it laugh. [147] Laughter was her strange medicine, and her employers never understood why she pursued it so hard. [163] But Mara knew grief could calcify, and a single honest laugh could crack it without breaking the heart. [181] Today she pursued one soul in particular, a midwife named Elowen who had vanished from the wake fires. [199] The town said Elowen refused the next world because she could not forgive herself for one lost child. [217] Mara had delivered babies too, before the plague taught her how easily hands fail. [231] She did not come to scold Elowen, but to find the note in her story that could turn to laughter. [251] At the cave mouth, she knelt and hooked the crocodile tooth under the lowest string like a plectrum. [269] When she plucked, the harp answered wrong, every pitch bent, and yet the air filled with luminous ache. [287] Echoes poured down the gorge, returning as whispers, and Mara let them brush her face like cold rain. [305] A woman began to speak in the broken harmonics, not with a mouth, but with memory. [321] I counted contractions, the voice confessed, and I missed the moment the cord tightened. [335] The confession throbbed in the misaligned strings, and Mara felt the old guilt in her own wrists answering. [353] She followed the sound out of the cave, pursuing it along ledges where the sunrise could not yet reach. [372] Below, the river was a ribbon of pewter, and above, a sliver of light waited behind the ridge. [390] The harp notes kept distorting, as if the gorge itself were twisting them, guiding her toward a narrow cleft. [409] There, Elowen appeared as a figure of water glass, cradling an invisible bundle and rocking with no rhythm. [427] Mara did not approach fast, because souls spook like deer, but she kept plucking softly with the tooth. [445] Elowen, Mara said, the gorge repeats what you hide until it becomes a storm. [459] The specter turned, and the confession spilled faster, telling of her joke to calm a laboring mother, then the silence. [479] Mara heard the joke in the warped music, a silly rhyme about frogs in crowns, and it nearly hurt. [498] That is the part you left out, Mara said, and it matters because you were trying to heal. [516] Elowen shook her head, and the gorge moaned back her shame, multiplying it into a choir. [532] Mara stepped closer until the mist beaded on her lashes, then laid the crocodile tooth in Elowen's palm. [550] It was heavy with the memory of a godling's laughter, and Elowen stared as if it were a lifeline. [569] Take it, Mara said, and tell me the rest, the part you cannot bear to say. [585] Elowen whispered that she had wanted to run, that she had imagined letting the mother die to save herself. [604] The words made Mara's chest burn, but she answered with the frog rhyme, letting it wobble and brighten. [622] Elowen blinked, and for the first time her mouth remembered how to curve, an unwilling laugh cracking through tears. [641] The gorge caught that laugh and returned it gentler, like light finally sliding over the ridge into the cleft. [660] In that new glow, Mara saw the invisible bundle dissolve into mist, and Elowen's shoulders loosened as if forgiven. [679] Mara kept playing through the distorted notes until Elowen's confession emptied, then she offered her hand like a bridge. [698] Together they walked toward the thin sunrise, and the soul collector felt her own grief laugh softly, integrating into healing. [718]</story>
