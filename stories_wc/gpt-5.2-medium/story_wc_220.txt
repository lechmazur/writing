<story>After the last resource war, the wasteland split like pottery, and our scrapyard settlement bridged the cracks with catwalks of welded rebar and prayer. [24] Wind moved through heaps of rusted cars in a wild hush, and the quiet was so deep you could hear bolts cooling after the torch. [49] I was called Lio, an intuitively descriptive scavenger who named people by the smells on their sleeves, because words were cheaper than metal and truer than flags. [76] My closest companion was Morrow, a bloodhound retired from finding bodies, his muzzle scarred by old wire and his eyes tired of pointing at grief. [101] He lived now under my cart, listening to the world, and I kept him fed not for work but because he still wanted to translate distance into closeness. [129] On evenings when the settlement lamps burned blue from scavenged gas, Morrow would nose my palm as if asking where the lost had gone when they stopped calling back. [158] That question became urgent when Sera, the signal-runner who traded messages between far camps, disappeared beyond the cracked flats with a satchel of letters and no echo. [185] The council said she had turned raider, but Morrow whined at the lie, and I believed him because truth always arrived with a smell first. [210] In Sera's shack I found an autumn leaf preserved in wax, pressed flat inside a tin locket, and it held a tint of red that no desert could keep. [239] Pinned beneath it was a riddle written in her sharp hand: 'To hear what I cannot say, turn the storm backward and read the rivers on its spine.' [267] Morrow sniffed the locket, then the floor, then the door, but his tail stayed low, as if even he feared the path the riddle was pointing toward. [294] Storms here were not clouds but old records, phonograph cylinders hauled from prewar libraries and traded as fuel, music, or code. [315] I owed my literacy to a mechanic priest who taught me to decipher the secret texts in the grooves of a phonograph cylinder, reading them by lamplight with a needle and a mirror. [348] Sera had once joked that all confession was just sound turned sideways, and now her leaf and riddle asked me to do exactly that. [372] At the barter pit I traded two copper coils for a cracked cylinder labeled ONLY DUST, and the seller warned me that the last person who listened cried blood. [401] Back under my tarp, in the wild hush between wind gusts, I set the needle into the spiral and watched the mirror catch minute shadows as the cylinder turned. [430] Letters rose out of those shadows, tinted revelations that looked stained by smoke, and my voice read them aloud so Morrow could hear what his nose could not. [458] They said Sera had found a buried relay station and learned the council had been selling coordinates of refugees to a warlord in exchange for clean water. [485] The grooves also held her plan: she would lure the warlord's scouts to the settlement gates, then broadcast the betrayal to every camp that still owned a receiver. [513] But her last lines, thin as wire, were for me: 'Lio, keep the leaf, because it remembers the color of home, and follow Morrow, because he will not lie about death.' [544] Morrow lifted his head at his name and led me across the catwalks into the open cracks, where his paws chose a route no map could draw, straight toward the relay station. [576] We reached a field of sunken antennas, and there Sera waited, bound but breathing, having hidden herself in the station's shadow until I solved her riddle. [602] She pressed the waxed leaf into my hand, warm from her skin, and asked me to stand beside her while she turned her secrets into signal, so the distant could become close enough to protect. [637] When the broadcast went out, the council's guards came running, but Morrow stepped between us, barking not at them but at the lies, and in that hush the camps answered, closing the wasteland with voices.
