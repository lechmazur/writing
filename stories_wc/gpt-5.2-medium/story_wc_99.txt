<story>After the severance, I took the mail boat to Halcyon Islet, arriving in a breezy islet after rain that smelled of kelp and wet basalt. [25]The sky was washed into cerulean regret, and even the gulls sounded as if they were apologizing for something they could not say. [48]In my pocket lay a ghost ship's compass, cold as a coin, salvaged from my father before he disappeared from my life with no good-bye. [73]Its needle did not seek north; it wavered toward whatever I tried hardest to forget, as if the tides of remembrance pulled it like the moon pulls water. [101]I had come because I wanted, absurdly, to find the color of unspoken apologies, the shade my father might have used if he had ever named his leaving. [129]The island held a school for bonsai and memory therapy, run by a slow-spoken bonsai tutor named Sera who met me under a cedar dripping rain pearls. [156]Sera's hands were rhythmically placid, moving in quiet loops as she bowed, and her voice arrived in pauses long enough for the sea to breathe between words. [183]She asked what I carried, and when I showed the compass she only nodded, as though ghost ships were as common here as driftwood. [207]You will not force it, she said, slow and steady, you will diffuse the ache the way mist diffuses a hard shoreline. [229]Her lessons began not with wire or shears but with an antique lace pattern spread on the table, its loops yellowed like old letters. [253]Through instructions woven into an antique lace pattern, she had encoded the steps of shaping trees and also the steps of speaking to the dead without pretending they answer. [282]Each knot meant pause, each openwork window meant look outward, and each border stitch meant return, because remorse, she told me, is a craft of repetition. [308]We sat facing the lagoon where rainwater slid from fern fronds, and she placed the compass on the lace so its needle could rest among the patterns. [335]As the tide turned, the needle began to tremble toward the western reef, and Sera watched it as calmly as she watched a sapling bend in wind. [362]The compass was hungry for memory, she murmured, and the tides of remembrance would keep lifting what I had buried, unless I learned to prune gently. [388]She led me along a path of slick stones, counting my steps to match the lace, until we reached a cove where the sea rocked in and out like a lullaby. [419]There, half in fog, a ship without crew lay anchored, its lanterns glowing though no one tended them, and I understood why locals called it the Wanderer. [446]My father's compass tugged hard toward its deck, and Sera pressed the lace into my palm, telling me to read it as I climbed. [470]On the planks, salt wind rifled my hair, and the ship felt older than wood, like a story retold until only the regret remained. [494]Following the pattern's first knot, I stopped trying to shout into the empty air and instead listened to the rigging creak in slow syllables. [518]At the openwork window, I looked through a broken porthole and saw the lagoon below, the water banded from slate to blue, as if apology had gradients. [545]The compass needle settled at last, pointing not outward but down into my chest, and I realized the severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence. [574]With the border stitch, I returned to the center of the deck where a bonsai pine sat in a cracked pot, needles still green despite the brine. [601]I could almost hear Sera instructing me, slow-spoken and unwavering, to cut what was dead and to keep what could still bend toward light. [625]I pruned one brittle twig, and the act diffused my anger into something softer, until the air around the little tree took on a clear, sea-glass hue. [652]When I stepped back onto the cove stones, the rain-washed breeze carried a color I could finally name, a deepening cerulean that was not forgiveness yet, but was the beginning of my unspoken apologies.
