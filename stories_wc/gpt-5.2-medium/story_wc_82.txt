<story>After the shadow detaches, the sky over Lumen Isle stays too bright, as if daylight refuses to mourn. [18]  
Mira, a crafty lantern maker, works in the floating island tea garden where kettles sing and leaves drift like small boats. [39]  
Since her brother Jalen vanished the night his shadow tore loose and slid away on its own, she has measured time by missing silhouettes. [63]  
On her workbench she keeps a lacquered box of paper squares, and every evening she tries to fold grief into origami cranes. [85]  
The cranes look perfect, but they sit dead on the shelf, because her hands cannot remember the weight of his laughter. [106]  
A tea gardener tells her the only place that still holds lost shadows is the glass basilica on a floating isle above the clouds. [130]  
They say its priests invented dream recording, trapping sleep in crystal so a person can replay what the heart could not keep. [152]  
Mira already knows a little of that craft, because lantern glass, when fed a polished gem, can store a flicker of a dream. [175]  
She has spent months learning gem polishing from a blind jeweler, turning rough moonstone into lenses that bite light cleanly. [195]  
Now she chooses her best stone, sets it in a brass throat, and transforms her favorite lantern into a recorder that breathes softly. [218]  
At dawn the tea garden unmoors, and the floating island drifts toward the basilica, pulling Mira along with ropes of jasmine scent. [240]  
Between tea shrubs, detached shadows skitter like ink fish, and her lantern records their jittering nightmares without her asking. [259]  
Each recording plays back as a chorus of whispers, luminous torment in sound, and she worries Jalen is trapped in such brightness. [281]  
The glass basilica appears by noon, a cathedral built of panes and prisms, standing on its own smaller isle that spins slowly. [303]  
To enter, Mira must take a stairway that descends while ascending, corkscrewing through air so your feet feel both rise and fall. [325]  
Her stomach knots with vertigo and memory, yet the lantern at her belt keeps glowing, as if it recognizes the path of loss. [348]  
Inside the basilica, priests in mirrored veils polish gems on long tables, and the air tastes of tea steam and cold rain. [370]  
They listen to Mira's recordings and tell her that a shadow can be lured back only by replaying the dream it fled from. [393]  
If she finds Jalen's last dream, she can transform the recording into a new shadow, a paper-thin twin that can be held. [415]  
The price, the priests warn, is that the dreamer must climb the Archive Spire and leave part of herself in the light. [437]  
Mira agrees, because her cranes are waiting for a soul to perch on them, and she cannot live with empty wings. [458]  
At the spire's top she sets the lantern on a crystal dais, and it projects Jalen's final dream across the glass like stained dawn. [482]  
In the dream he stands in the tea garden, calling her name, while his detached shadow crawls away from his feet toward the basilica. [506]  
Mira steps into the projection, letting the dream record her back, and she feels herself split into flame and paper. [526]  
She takes the paper part, folds it quickly, and with each crease she forces a different grief to fit inside a crane. [548]  
The lantern's flame part polishes the dream-gem from within, sharpening the image until Jalen's wandering shadow turns, sees her, and returns. [569]  
When the shadow touches the first finished crane, it transforms into a small dark bird made of lightless light, and Mira finally weeps. [592]  
The bird circles the basilica, casting a silhouette onto every pane, and the priests bow as if a missing note has returned. [614]  
Mira carries her lantern home through the stair that still descends while ascending, and in the tea garden she hangs new lanterns shaped like cranes. [639]  
They glow with recorded dreams and the ache she folded into them, luminous torment made useful, so other mourners can find their shadows again. [663]
