<story>In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, I woke on the cold deckplates of an abandoned spaceport repair bay, my palms already reading the grit and oil like braille. [28] I am a sensory map maker by trade, hired once to chart the feel of air currents and the taste of static for pilots who could not trust their eyes. [58] Now there were no pilots, only the husk of Dock Seven and a green glass shard in my pocket, warm as if it had stolen heat from a living sun. [88] The shard had come from a viewport that never broke in my memories, and that contradiction tugged me here more than any contract. [111] I needed to discover the weight of a withheld truth, the kind that presses on the ribs until breathing becomes a decision. [133] Every cycle of my life had been like this, calm days punctured by leaps that were cyclically spontaneous, arriving on a rhythm I could sense but never schedule. [161] When the leaps came, I did not travel by engines or gates; I wove between worlds, threading my body and my attention through parallel universes the way others stitch cloth. [191] The repair bay was perfect for it, full of broken conduits and unfinished hull plates that hummed with choices, and my tongue could taste which choices had been taken elsewhere. [221] I spread my kit on the floor: chalk that marked temperature, a microphone that recorded silence, and the shard, which I set upright in a clamp like a tiny, dangerous sail. [252] Its green edge caught the bay lights and redirected them into a thin line across the far wall, and in that line I heard, faintly, my mother's voice saying, You promised. [283] The line was not just light but a seam, and when my cyclic pulse hit, the seam opened and my senses slipped through, not forward in space but sideways into the next version of Dock Seven. [319] There, the repair bay was still abandoned, yet a fresh smear of coolant cooled the air, and I mapped it by breathing, letting the sweet chemical bite define corridors my eyes could not see. [353] A distress beacon clicked under a workbench, repeating a call sign that belonged to my brother Jalen, missing since the night I said he never came to the port. [382] I had withheld the truth then because Command wanted a scapegoat for the accident, and I thought a lie would keep Jalen safe from their courts. [408] But the beacon's steady tapping gave the lie a mass I could finally measure, heavier than any cargo, and it dragged my feet toward a sealed service hatch. [436] Using the shard as a prism, I redirected the seam again, aiming it through the hatch's locking mechanism, and the worlds on either side shivered like overlapped film. [464] In the next universe the hatch stood open, and inside was Jalen, older, alive, and furious, his hands bound with repair wire as if the bay itself had arrested him. [494] He stared past me at the green shard and said the truth has weight because it anchors worlds, and you cut my anchor when you told them I was nowhere. [524] My cycles had always brought me to places where a decision could be redirected, so I took his bound wrists, stepped back to the seam, and wove us together through parallel universes until we reached one where my statement could be amended. [566] In that final Dock Seven, I found the log terminal intact, and in the quiet after the jump I entered the real account, feeling the withheld truth lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled, finally shared.
