Under starlight, the prism sanctuary glittered like a cut gem sunk into the dunes, each angled wall catching constellations and bending them into quiet corridors. [25]
I was its broken mask restorer, hired to mend ceremonial faces chipped by salt and time, yet tonight my hands shook because the air itself seemed to accumulate silence. [54]
Visitors called the phenomenon the interlaced hush, a weave of muted sound that wrapped around grief and left no echo, and priests claimed it kept the dead from wandering beyond the sanctuary. [86]
They were wrong about one thing: the hush did not keep spirits in; it kept them from touching ground, and so they drifted, bright and restless, among the prisms. [115]
To ground them, I had agreed to exhume the sanctuary's oldest secret with the only tool I trusted, a tapestry needle I wore on a cord like a charm. [144]
The elders had spoken to me across sharing a secret, passing it in half-whispers through the broken mouths of masks I had repaired, as if confession required porcelain and resin. [174]
Long ago, they said, fishermen trapped a storm-spirit in a net and buried it beneath the sanctuary, and the spirit's suffocation became the interlaced hush that thickened each year. [203]
If I could free the storm-spirit and stitch its breath into a mask, the other wandering dead would follow the sound of that breath down into the earth and rest. [233]
But freedom required an unmaking, not a cut, because the trap was tied by human fear: I had to exhume the burial chamber by unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net. [264]
At midnight I followed a staircase of quartz down to a slab marked with hook and wave, and as I pressed my ear to it the hush pressed back, dense as wool. [296]
The tapestry needle found the first knot by feel, and when I teased the strand loose a single forgotten syllable escaped, ringing in my skull like a bell heard underwater. [326]
Spirits gathered above the slab, their faces switching between the masks I had mended and the faces beneath, and their lucid unrest made my vision sharp even as my heart raced. [357]
Each knot I unraveled released another piece of sound, and the sanctuary answered by splitting starlight into prismatic threads that wrapped around my wrists, urging me to finish. [385]
At the final knot my courage faltered, because the secret the elders never said aloud was that the storm-spirit was not merely trapped; it was my ancestor, bound by my family's vow. [417]
Across sharing a secret with it, I whispered my true name into the net, and the name braided with the released syllables until the slab shuddered, ready to open. [446]
The stone lifted like an eyelid, revealing a chamber lined with salt mirrors, and in the center lay the net, still wet after centuries, cradling a heart of stormlight. [475]
When I touched that heart with the needle, the interlaced hush snapped, not into noise but into breathing, and the spirits dropped softly to the floor as if they finally had weight. [507]
I worked fast, restoring a cracked sailor's mask with threads pulled from the net, stitching the storm-spirit's breath into its mouth so the living could hear it without dying of it. [538]
The sanctuary's walls stopped hoarding silence; instead they held song in suspension, and the starbeams outside seemed less distant, as though the sky had leaned down to listen. [566]
My ancestor rose as a figure of rain and lantern-glow, and though it could have swept through the prisms and shattered them, it bent close, asking why I had broken the vow. [598]
I told it that vows made of fear keep the dead unmoored, that every mask I repaired taught me faces are meant to meet air, and that I wanted our family to stop feeding the hush. [634]
It placed its palm against my chest, grounding itself through my heartbeat, then flowed into the stitched mask, leaving behind a strand of net that dissolved into soil like forgiven rope. [665]
Above us, the freed spirits lay down among the salt mirrors, and for the first time the prism sanctuary under starlight felt inhabited rather than haunted, its quiet no longer a prison but a choice. [700]
At dawn I carried the breathing mask upward, and every step sounded clear, as if the world had been exhumed from inside its own throat, while behind me the interlaced hush thinned into ordinary air. [735]
