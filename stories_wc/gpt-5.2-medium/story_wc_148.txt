In copperlight repose, the lighthouse prison off the jagged reef looked less like a warning and more like a lantern hung for lost ships, though its beam swept only empty sea and the barred windows where men learned to whisper. [40]
I was called the cry-wolf boy, because my father was the boy who cried wolf, and because the wardens said lies ran in blood the way salt ran in stone. [70]
They had ferried me here before they find the bodies, while the mainland still argued whether the missing keepers had slipped into the surf or into each other's knives. [99]
I did not come to prove truth; I came to chase hush, the thin quiet that settles only after a story is finished, and I wanted to finish one that began with my father's shout and ended with no one listening. [140]
The chaplain, old as rust, slipped me a lattice from the confessional, a square of pierced oak that once hid sinners' mouths, and told me it sustains impossibilities if you hold it to your ear and refuse to blink. [179]
Through its holes I heard not prayers but corridors, a labyrinth of footfalls and keys, and the lattice gave each sound a place to go so it would not die against the stone. [212]
At night I learned to hover, not by magic but by listening until my weight forgot itself, and the guards, lulled by the beam's slow rotation, never noticed my bare feet skating a handspan above the wet floor. [250]
I followed the hush the way other boys follow gulls, using the chaplain's gift like a compass, and I entered the oldest wing through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades, where generations had tried and failed to escape. [292]
The scuffs were a map: heel marks at the threshold, shoulder gouges where men pushed, and, lower down, a child's scratchings that spelled WOLF in crooked letters, as if my father's panic had prowled all the way to this sea cage. [333]
Inside, the wing curled in on itself, stairs leading nowhere, cells that opened into walls, and a spiral around the lantern room, and I understood why I had been drawn here: to thread a labyrinth with your own story, to lay down words as breadcrumb and rope. [380]
When I pressed the lattice to the door of Keeper Morrow's cell, the impossibility it sustained became plain: the hush spoke back in his voice, telling me the keepers were not lost at sea but hidden in the light, folded like paper inside the Fresnel lens. [426]
I hovered up the iron ladder, the copperlight pooling around my hands, and in the lantern room I found the lens mottled with salt and, behind it, dark shapes that the beam politely ignored, as if illumination itself could avert its gaze. [468]
I did not touch them, because the sea would deliver them soon enough and the island would wake to its horror, but I set the lattice against the glass and whispered my father's old warning into it until the hush finally took the words and held them still. [516]
Down below, the wardens played cards and argued over tides, sure that silence meant safety, while I walked back through the scuffed door and let it remain ajar, a deliberate flaw in the prison's geometry that would guide searchers when they came looking. [559]
I knew what they would say about me then, that I had invented voices in oak and air, that I had floated on delusion, that the son of a liar was manufacturing grief, yet the lattice warmed in my pocket like a coal that refused to cool. [606]
My father had cried wolf because he wanted the village's eyes on him; I chased hush because I wanted eyes away, a space where the dead could be named without spectacle, and where my own story could be true even if no one believed it. [651]
When dawn came, the beam turned pale and the reef began to show its teeth, and I sat in the chapel under the same copperlight repose, waiting for the first shout from the docks, knowing that after the bodies were found, the hush would belong to them, not me. [700]
