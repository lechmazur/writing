<story>Rain had just finished worrying the desert, leaving the fortress walls dark and rinsed, as if the stone had remembered how to sweat. [23]  
Safi, the garrison chef, stood in the courtyard with a bowl of salt and dates, tasting the air the way other people listened, because his tongue caught memories in anything he ate. [55]  
The rainwater in the drains carried sharp recollections of last night's siege drills, and each mouthful made his jaw tighten with strangers' fear until he spat into sand to keep the kitchen steady. [88]  
He had learned to do that after touching a wounded scout and catching her stored remorse, which leapt through his fingertips like fever and stayed in him for weeks, emotionally contagious through touch. [121]  
Now he kept his hands wrapped in linen when he served, yet the commander still sought him, not for stew, but for relief from the fortress's own guilt. [149]  
In the map room, Commander Jinan slid a wet slate across the table and pointed at a sinkhole revealed by the storm beyond the eastern barbican. [175]  
Old songs claimed a coral icebound pavilion lay beneath those dunes, a place where seawater once stood and where the builders sealed their regrets so the living could keep marching. [205]  
Jinan believed the pavilion had thawed enough to open, and he wanted Safi to go down and sandpaper rough memories out of the men before the next battle, without naming what dream of mercy drove him. [241]  
Safi did not ask for a guard; at the close of an unspoken dream he had carried since childhood, he wanted to prove that tasting pain could be turned into craft. [272]  
He found the sinkhole by following how the rain had pooled, analyzing tidal pool formations in the mud as if the desert were pretending to be a shore again. [301]  
The patterns led him to a spiral of salt crystals, and beneath it a breath of cold rose, smelling of brine and long-buried apologies. [325]  
He climbed down into a cavity glazed with frost, where coral ribs arched into a pavilion that looked like a banquet hall for ghosts, its floor a sheet of ice under shifting sand. [358]  
At the center sat jars of clear resin, each holding a swirl of dark sediment, and when he touched one through his linen, the jar warmed and his palms itched with borrowed shame. [391]  
The pavilion had stored remorse like spice, concentrated and preserved, and it wanted to be used, to be subsumed into a living mouth that could grind it down. [419]  
Safi knelt, unwrapped his hands, and placed his bare fingertips on the resin, accepting the contagion, because to smooth a memory you first had to let it scrape you raw. [449]  
Images flooded his tongue without food: workers sealing the pavilion while their children cried aboveground, soldiers abandoning friends to save the fortress, lovers trading silence for survival, all of it brittle yet sturdy as coral. [484]  
He breathed and did what he did with tough meat, tasting until he could name every note, then mixing the remorse with his own quiet failures so it softened, becoming one blended bitterness instead of many jagged ones. [522]  
When he climbed back to the rain-washed courtyard, he carried that mixture in his body, and the first soldier who grabbed his shoulder to ask what he had found suddenly began to weep, feeling it too. [558]  
Safi steadied the man and, instead of pulling away, held on until the grief passed through them both, teaching the watching squad that remorse could be shared without spreading panic, if someone chose to contain it. [594]  
That night he cooked a thin broth with dates and salt, and as each soldier ate he let them borrow, in small sanded portions, the pavilion's old regrets folded into his own, so their dreams stayed unspoken but less sharp. [634]
