<story>After the reef dies, the sea off Lorn Harbor turns glassy and empty, and the old cannon emplacements along the shore sound louder than the waves. [26]
I arrive as a gloom-hill coachman, hired to bring the last wounded maps and the last living witnesses to the memorial council on the blooming jetty at twilight. [54]
The jetty is narrow as a spine, but it reaches into a vast blue dusk where the horizon feels like an unrolled scroll no hand can finish reading. [82]
In my satchel I carry a collection of dried seed pods, rattling like small bones, because the council has ordered me to fertilize the cratered ground where infantry once slept. [112]
They say the soil is poisoned by powder and salt, and that only someone who speaks dead languages can bargain with what lingers in it. [137]
My father taught me those tongues at Gloom Hill, not for prayer, but for work: the contracts carved on ship keels, the grave-songs on stones, the treaties nobody remembers to keep. [168]
When I step onto the jetty, lanterns are already hung from driftwood posts, and the planks have burst with wild blossoms that root in cracks and sway above black water. [198]
The blossoms should not be here, the fisherfolk whisper, unless the submerged concord is still holding somewhere under the dead reef, binding salt to sweetness and war to silence. [227]
The concord was signed in a cave below the surf, they tell me, between our generals and the reef-keepers, and it promised that if we stopped killing, the sea would feed our fields. [260]
But the reef died anyway, bleached to chalk after the last barrage, and now the cave floods with mute sand, so the council wants a land-garden as a new oath. [290]
To let a garden reclaim a battlefield, I must first ask the buried dead to loosen their grip, and I begin by kneeling at the jetty's end where the water laps at rusted shell casings. [325]
The gulls circle overhead, and I listen the way my horse listens for my whistle, sorting each cry for meaning, because my method is by understanding bird calls. [353]
One gull stutters a warning of bitter ground, another clicks twice for fresh seepage, and a third gives a long descending note that in the old naval Latin means, Here is where you dig. [387]
I answer aloud in that same Latin, then in the older reef-script my father called Eel Speech, and the air tightens as if the jetty has become the throat of a sleeping beast. [420]
From the water rises a chill, not a ghost with a face, but a pressure of memory, and the lantern flames lean away from it like reeds in wind. [449]
In the dead languages I name the regiments that fell here and the fish that once glittered on the reef, stitching their names together until the pressure eases into something like attention. [481]
Then I crack open the seed pods and pour their curled kernels into the shallow trench the gull indicated, mixing them with compost hauled in my coach and with ash scraped from the memorial brazier. [516]
Salt still crusts the earth, so I wade knee-deep and bring up a bucket of dark silt, the kind the concord once lifted into coral mouths, and I spread it until the mixture turns heavy and alive. [553]
The birds quiet, and in that narrow strip of planks over an ocean too wide to mend, I feel the vastness press close, asking whether my small fertilizing can count as peace. [585]
I speak again, not to command but to invite, offering the dead a future tense, and the water answers with a soft clacking from below, like stones tapped together in assent. [616]
At twilight the blossoms along the jetty fold and reopen as if tasting a new season, and the trench drinks the silt, and I imagine roots threading through bullet fragments without hatred. [648]
When I lead my horse back toward the dark road of Gloom Hill, the gulls cry a final phrase I understand now as Keep it, and behind me the jetty blooms against the empty sea, holding the submerged concord in soil. [689]</story>
