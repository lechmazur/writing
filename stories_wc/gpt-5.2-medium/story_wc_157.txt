After thoughts became taxable, the city learned to whisper with its eyes, and the Revenue Bureau learned to read those eyes like ledgers. [23]
I was an entomologist by license and a gardener by stubbornness, and my greenhouse behind the museum was the only place the drones did not hover long. [50]
Moths and beetles needed humidity, and humid air fogged surveillance lenses, so my glass rooms became a refuge for people who could no longer afford private thinking. [77]
On the night the auditors seized my neighbor for an unreported dream, a charming rogue scholar named Lio slipped through the service door carrying a gourd rattle seed in his palm. [108]
He smiled as if the world were a prank he would explain later, yet his voice was candidly cryptic, offering truth in short riddles that kept both of us safe. [138]
He said the Bureau had begun taxing not just thoughts but the act of holding them, and the only defense was to spread meanings where calculators could not reach. [167]
From his coat he produced that seed, hard as a bead, and asked me to plant it in soil that belonged to everyone, because ownership was where taxes found you. [197]
When I hesitated, he shook the seed inside a dry gourd shell, and its rattle sounded like a tiny map being unfolded. [219]
Lio belonged to a secret language club that met in plain daylight, under pretexts of botany classes and insect shows, and he wanted my greenhouse to host their next lesson. [249]
The club did not trade words, he explained, but patterns, and every pattern could warp into another if you knew how to watch the borders. [274]
On my worktable he arranged pinned butterflies into a spiral, then nudged one wing and the spiral became an arrow, then a question mark, then a warning about a raid. [304]
He taught me to read the flutter of living insects against mesh as punctuation, and in that converging chaos of wings and breath I felt my own fear reorganize. [333]
Our motivation, he said, was simple: to stand guard over your own spark of defiance, even if the guard looked like a hobby. [356]
If you carried the spark alone, the Bureau could invoice it, but if you planted it in public, it became weather, and no one taxed rain. [382]
So Lio proposed a method that sounded like civic virtue: joining community gardens to plant message patterns, rows of herbs and gourds that read as recipes to strangers. [410]
In his system, the gourd rattle seed marked the start of a sentence, and when it sprouted, its vines curved to point toward the next plot in the chain. [439]
Every garden volunteer learned only one fragment, which kept us innocent, yet the fragments, seen from a roof or a drone, warped together into instructions for shelter. [466]
Within a week my greenhouse filled with retirees, students, and the tired, all pretending to admire beetle larvae while Lio, still smiling, tested their eyes. [491]
He would ask, How many spots on this ladybug, and their answers formed codes, candidly cryptic enough to be true and useless to microphones. [515]
I watched him move among them like a professor and a pickpocket at once, stealing despair, returning curiosity, and leaving each person with a task at a garden. [543]
The Bureau finally noticed the new beds sprouting across the district and sent auditors with clipboards to measure our produce and our silences. [566]
They stormed my greenhouse first, because insects looked like hidden archives, but humidity smeared their lenses and moth dust made their throats close, and their neat order faltered. [594]
In that moment of converging chaos, Lio clacked the gourd rattle, and the club members scattered through the fern aisles, each following a pattern only they could see. [622]
I led the auditors into the butterfly room, where the pinned spiral still waited, and as they argued over taxable intent, the garden messages outside took root, guarding our sparks. [652]
