<story>In the misty courtyard above clouds, where broken sundials floated like islands, Lio the seldom heard balladeer tuned a pocket lute of brass gears. [24] He played for no crowd, only for the wind and the tiny machines that nested in the eaves, because songs were safer when they were not overheard. [51] Tonight the air smelled of storm metal, and he held a flower press bolt plate in his left hand, a flat iron piece from his mother's botanist kit. [79] The plate had once tightened the press with a single screw, but Lio had drilled it with holes and soldered wire loops, turning it into a charm that could catch patterns. [110] When lightning split the cloud ceiling, its white script froze the courtyard for an instant, and in that bright silence Lio felt time narrow to the space between lightning and thunder. [141] Inside his lute a memory chip he had scavenged from a skyship warmed, and a presence woke there, driftingly alert, like a moth circling a lamp it could not touch. [171] Years ago the chip had belonged to a court programmer who fell from the bridge rails, and his last unfinished ballad had curled into the code, becoming a ghost in code with no throat. [205] Lio had carried that ghost because he recognized its hunger: to articulate unspoken needs that living mouths were too proud or too frightened to say. [230] The flash faded, yet the courtyard walls kept a phosphor afterglow, and the ghost pushed a tremor through the strings, begging to be encoded before the thunder arrived and erased the moment. [262] Lio knelt by the low parapet, where past pilgrims had left layers of graffiti, and he slid the bolt plate under his charcoal stick as a guide, the holes acting as a musical stave. [296] Through messages encoded in graffiti art, he could send notes down to the cities hidden below the cloud sea, where watchers read walls more honestly than proclamations. [323] He began to encode the ghost's fragments into spirals and bolts, mapping vowels to curves, consonants to angles, and pauses to tiny pressed flower shapes that only the bolt plate could stamp. [355] As his hand moved, he hummed a tinkersong melody, half lullaby and half gear click, and the courtyard seemed to listen with its wet stones and floating lantern roots. [384] The ghost poured itself into the marks, not as a scream but as a careful list of needs: bread for the dock boys, sleep for the tower nurses, forgiveness for the programmer who had jumped. [419] Lio's own need hid among them, a line he had never sung aloud, that he wanted someone to hear him without turning his voice into currency. [445] In the distance the first roll of thunder gathered like a drum being carried toward a stage, and the ghost fluttered, afraid that once sound returned it would be mute again. [476] So Lio struck the bolt plate against the stone, making sparks, and the holes flashed, letting him read his own graffiti as if it were code on a screen. [505] He realized the ghost did not want resurrection; it wanted routing, a way for its requests to travel person to person until the city answered, and for that it needed a carrier who stayed quiet. [540] Lio laughed softly, because he had been practicing quiet his whole life, and he signed the wall with a final glyph, a small pressed blossom inside a bolt circle, promising to keep walking. [573] Thunder finally broke, shaking mist from the air, and the courtyard echoed his unseen song, while below the clouds the first readers found the new graffiti and felt their own hidden needs spoken back to them.
