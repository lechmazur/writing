The sea hit the cliff with a crashing hush, as if it wanted to keep its own secrets. [18]
Mara Sato waited on the slick rocks for the ebb, checking her watch because the window was only between tidal changes. [39]
She was a spelunker by trade and claustrophobic by curse, and every breath near a tight hole tried to turn into a shout. [62]
Still, she had come to return to the forgotten research facility wedged inside the sea cave, where her brother had vanished. [83]
People in town spoke of the place like a misfiled memory, but Mara's motivation was to stand by the unremembered, even if they had stood by nobody. [110]
The facility had once monitored undersea cables that carried voices and markets across the ocean floor, and its silence had made it a convenient ghost. [135]
Mara clipped her lamp to her helmet and followed a notch in the rock that only appeared when the water dropped low enough. [158]
At the entrance, a throat of stone narrowed, and the familiar panic rose, measuring the distance to daylight like a debt. [179]
She pressed her palm to the wall and counted three exhalations until the sound of waves outside became a softer drum. [200]
Her brother Ken had called this cave a phase mouth, where matter and signal could change state, and he had laughed at how poetic that sounded. [226]
Now Mara carried what he had left with her, a torn field codex page with an illuminant gold fleck embedded in the margin. [249]
Under her lamp the fleck glittered, and it did more than reflect light; it tracked invisible things, the way metal filings track a magnet. [273]
Ken had smeared that gold into ink to map currents of charge around the cables, and the page could still show where a buried line hummed. [299]
Inside the first chamber, rusted consoles leaned like tired animals, and salt crystals crusted every label until names were gone. [319]
The air smelled of wet copper, and in that odor she heard Ken's last voicemail, cut off mid sentence by static. [340]
She unfolded the codex page and watched the gold fleck crawl a fraction toward the southern wall, tugged by a field she could not feel. [365]
Behind that wall, the main trunk of the undersea cables entered the facility through a pressure lock, and the lock was sealed by a collapsed corridor. [391]
The only way past, Ken had written, was through phase transitions: shift the water to vapor, the vapor to mist, and slip the space between. [416]
Mara found the old reactor coil, a ring of ceramic and copper, and when she powered it from her battery the room filled with a low thrumming hush. [444]
Condensation beaded on her lashes as the coil warmed the flooded rubble, and she forced herself into a gap no wider than her shoulders. [468]
Terror crowded her ribs, but the water around the stones began to boil without bubbles, turning to a white fog that made the passage feel less solid. [495]
For a moment she was neither in water nor in air, and the claustrophobia had nothing to grip because the world itself had loosened. [519]
She emerged into the pressure lock chamber, shaking, and the codex page in her glove pointed the gold fleck straight at a terminal marked CABLE HEART. [545]
The terminal was dark, yet when she touched its keys she felt a pulse under her fingertips, as if messages were still running in the dark. [571]
Ken had spliced a recorder into the line, hoping to catch the invisible thing he believed lived in the cable noise, a pattern that learned and hid. [598]
Mara inserted the codex page into the scanner slot, and the gold fleck lit up, translating the field into a map of moving shadows. [622]
One shadow looped around a break in the trunk cable and kept looping, like a stranded fish, and Mara understood why Ken had stayed. [646]
If the cables failed here, the whole stretch of coast would lose its link, and Ken would become just another unremembered name in the town's shrug. [672]
Between the next set of tides, she used the coil to force one more phase transition, drying the corroded joint to vapor, then cooling it to solid contact with a clamp. [703]
The terminal woke, a single line of text repeating Ken's last log, and she returned it to the world by routing it along the undersea cables, listening to the crashing hush outside soften into ordinary surf. [739]
