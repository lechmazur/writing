<story>In the rooftop greenhouse, Mira kept her easel between citrus trees and saffron crocuses, because the smog-choked city below made every streetlamp look drowned.[24] She was an insomniac painter, and night after night she watched the waxing moon climb through soot, methodically hopeful that one clean beam could still reach her glass roof.[53] When the beam arrived, it did not fall like light so much as open a door inside her, and daydreams sparked by moonlight began to move behind her eyes.[82] In those saffron quiet reveries, letters she had never learned drifted up like seeds, each from a lost language the city had ground to dust as factories replaced schools.[111] The only tool that could catch them was the calligrapher's moon-tipped brush Sayeed had pressed into her palm years ago, the night she shared her last jar of jam with a shivering stranger.[144] Sayeed had repaid that small sweetness with the brush and a promise: kindness does not vanish, it changes handwriting.[163] Mira wanted proof, not for pride but for survival, so she began painting the greenhouse panes with the moon-tipped brush, recording the drifting scripts before morning erased them.[191] If strangers truly remembered kindness, then somewhere in the labyrinth of roofs and vents someone would recognize a word and remember the hands that once offered help.[218] On the sixth night of the waxing moon, a knock came up the metal stairs, thin as a question, and the greenhouse door creaked open to reveal Ro the courier.[248] His mask hung loose, his eyes were red from delivering packages through toxic dawns, and he asked whether she was the one painting secret graffiti on glass.[275] Mira invited him in, poured him saffron tea from a thermos, and told him she was trying to save words that had no place left to land.[302] Ro frowned at the panes where pale strokes curved like crescent shells, and he said the marks made his chest hurt, as if he almost understood them.[329] That hurt was the hinge she needed, so she asked him to sit under the brightest patch of moonlight, and she let her own daydreams rouse his.[356] The moonbeam warmed the glass and, in Mira's mind, the lost language returned as a street song from before the smog, sung by a woman selling oranges.[383] She painted the song's first line in looping script, and as the brush's crescent tip lifted, Ro whispered the next line without knowing how.[407] He went still, then told her his grandmother had hummed something like that while offering him bread to a coughing stranger during a blackout, and the stranger had been Mira.[437] Mira remembered: she had been lost, dizzy from fumes, and Ro's grandmother had guided her up these same stairs and hidden her in the greenhouse until the sirens passed.[466] Ro had carried that memory like a sealed envelope, never opening it, because the city taught him that kindness was a luxury that got you robbed.[492] Now the script on the pane unsealed it, and his shoulders rose as if his lungs had found a cleaner pocket of air.[515] Mira, methodically hopeful, proposed an experiment: they would paint a whole alphabet of remembered kindnesses on the greenhouse roof, one word for each person who had ever helped a stranger.[545] Ro agreed, and for the rest of the waxing moon they worked in measured silence, letting moonlight spark daydreams that translated into strokes, and letting the strokes translate back into courage.[576] From the street, the rooftop greenhouse began to glow with pale writing, and passersby paused, roused from their hurry, to mouth sounds their tongues still remembered.[602] Some returned the next night with small offerings: an air filter cartridge, a pot of basil, a note of thanks for a long-ago favor, and Mira watched each gift land like proof.[634] Under the moon's steady climb she finally felt sleep approach, not as surrender but as trust, and before she closed her eyes she wrote one last word in the lost language: rouse.[666]</story>
