<story>In the amber pavilion in autumn, Lina Kade painted a wall-length mural of moths and moonlit lilies, her colors vivid enough to warm the glasshouse even as the orchard outside browned and fell quiet. [34]She was a quietly driven, vivid mural artist, the kind who listened more than she spoke, and she kept in her satchel a collection of old postcards that her mother had mailed from towns with cathedrals and strange gardens. [73]Each card carried, beneath the postage and weather stains, a small question in the same hand: Why do the flowers bloom at night? [96]Lina had asked it since childhood, but after her mother died that winter, the question turned from curiosity to hunger, and she began to reckon that the answer might be braided with whatever her mother had been trying to tell her. [137]When the pavilion closed for the season, she wrapped her brushes and took the postcards to the city, where a soot-dark cathedral rose above the river and offered her a custodial job until spring. [171]Across the melting of winter's last snow, she learned the building's hours and drafts, and she noticed that in the cloister garden, a ring of night-blooming stock opened pale petals only after vespers, as if the stone itself were exhaling perfume. [212]The sacristan shrugged at her questions, saying the gardeners blamed moths and moon and old habits of the plants, but Lina heard in the midnight rustle a softer, older rhythm, an umbral tenderness that made her slow her steps and listen. [253]On a night when sleet tapped the panes, she spread the postcards under the nave lamp and saw that several showed the same cathedral window from the outside, its surface etched with vines so fine they looked like scratches on ice. [294]A final card, dated the year before Lina was born, held a pressed flower and a line that chilled her more than the weather: Look through it when the morning goes quiet. [326]She waited for the moment the choir stopped rehearsing and the city had not yet woken, the dawning hush that filled the cathedral like held breath, then climbed the narrow stair to the transept window. [361]There, through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, she discovered that the vines were not mere ornament but a palimpsest of botanical drawings and notes, carved by different hands and aligned only from one exact angle. [401]When she shifted her gaze, a second set of lines appeared: a map of warm air currents rising from the crypt vents, carrying stored daylight heat to the cloister beds at night, while the thick stone kept the days cold and the evenings mild. [445]In the deepest layer she read her mother's name, etched beside a tiny moth, and the confession that the night bloom was a form of shelter--a trick of temperature and timing meant to feed pollinators when the sun could not scorch them, and to remind a fearful young woman that gentleness could be engineered. [499]Lina stood a long time with her forehead against the cold frame, reckoning not only with the mechanics of petals and vents, but with the message threaded through all those journeys on paper: her mother had been building safe nights wherever she went. [542]When spring finally loosened the gutters and the last snow retreated into the river, she returned to the amber pavilion with the postcards and painted a new panel in the mural, showing the cathedral window layered like memory and the nocturnal flowers opening under it, so that anyone who entered at twilight could understand why they bloomed and feel, for a moment, the same tender dark.
