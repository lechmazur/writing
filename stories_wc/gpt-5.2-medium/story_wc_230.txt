After the empathy virus burned through the cities, everyone learned new ways to hide, but I did not, because my tongue had become involuntarily truthful.[25]
I am Mara Quill, a rational truffle forager, and in the hanging orchard that clings to a ravine battered by storms, my work is to read the ground like a ledger.[56]
The trees grow on cables and terraces above the churning river, their roots boxed in cradles, and every gale makes the whole place sway as if it remembers falling.[85]
I came here to cultivate psychological safety for the survivors we shelter in the orchard sheds, people who cannot bear another mind reading their grief aloud.[111]
Truth, after the virus, is a kind of shrapnel, and my honesty makes me dangerous unless I plan my silences with care.[133]
That is why I study discredited textbooks, searching through rumored cures in discredited textbooks for ways to damp the contagion of feeling without turning anyone numb.[159]
Most pages are superstition, but the margins are full of field notes from smugglers and medics who treated symptoms where governments would not.[182]
One evening, during a storm that snapped a pear platform loose, a courier named Lio limped into my shed and set an antique glass eye on my table.[210]
He said it was only a curiosity, but my illness would not let me accept the lie, and I heard myself answer, 'This is a smuggled relic, and you are afraid of what it sees.'[246]
Lio flinched as if I had struck him, then confessed that the eye had been pried from a saint-statue in the flooded capital and carried over the ridge in a sack of onions.[279]
In the textbooks I had read, glass eyes were not prosthetics but lenses for diagnosis, used to occlude the healer's own sight so the patient's emotions could not infect them.[309]
The margins warned that the method worked only if the healer could not lie, because deception made the lens cloud and reflect panic back into the room.[336]
Lio wanted me to sell the relic onward, yet I saw a different trade: if the eye could help me blunt my unintended truths, our orchard might become a place where people felt safe again.[371]
To test it, I pressed the cold globe into my palm and listened to the wind thread the ladders, then asked Lio about the platform accident, letting my voice go neutral.[402]
Without the eye, my truth would have spilled, but when I held it against my left eyelid like a patch, it occluded the orchard's sway and my words came slower, kinder.[433]
I could still be honest, yet I could choose which honesty served, and that small choice felt like grace in a world that had lost all boundaries.[460]
We began using the eye during nightly councils, not to mute feelings but to keep them from crashing through us, and the survivors stopped accusing each other of secret hatred.[490]
The storm season worsened, and with each thunderclap the ravine filled with static empathy, making even the goats skittish, so my shed became a clinic of quiet.[517]
Then a patrol from the rebuilt Ministry arrived by rope bridge, searching for relic smugglers, and their captain smiled too warmly as she asked what I knew.[544]
My mouth started to tell her everything, because truth is my reflex, but I lifted the glass eye and occluded my good eye, focusing on the captain's boots instead of her hunger.[576]
I told the captain only that truffles grow where lightning strikes old roots, and offered to guide her to safe paths in the orchard, while Lio slipped the relic's twin, a hollow casing, into her search bag.[613]
When the patrol left, satisfied with the planted evidence, I buried the real eye beneath the black truffle bed, because psychological safety sometimes requires secrecy, and my fractured grace was to keep choosing it.[647]
