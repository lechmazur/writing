<story>Through the hush of an overlooked era, the shooting star tracking station clung to a basalt ridge like a barnacle on the night. [23]Its domes were closed most days, its consoles dim, but the sky above still rehearsed its ancient sparks, and someone had to keep the lenses clean. [49]That someone was Lio, the station's cosmic janitor, spiritually curious enough to bow before meteor charts the way others bowed before saints. [71]He mopped in silence and listened to the building creak, savoring what he called flourishing stillness, the kind that grew when nothing insisted on being loud. [97]In a drawer of the maintenance cart he kept a shard of yellow lantern glass, rescued from a decommissioned runway beacon, and when the night felt thin he held it to his eye. [130]The glass warmed his palm and turned the constellations into slow-moving embers, reminding him that even light needed a vessel, even strength needed a crack to enter. [157]Lio had come here after his brother died on a supply run, and he could not bear the city's condolences, which were loud as engines and just as exhaust-filled. [186]He wanted to find strength in vulnerability, not by armoring his grief, but by letting it breathe in the cold corridors where nobody demanded he be healed. [213]The old astronomers had left a practice for calibrating trackers: by tracing the path of falling stars with charcoal on vellum, you learned the sky's habits. [239]Lio did it not for calibration but to empathize, because he suspected each streak was a traveler burning up on purpose to arrive somewhere else. [264]On the first clear night of winter, he climbed to the tracking dome, spread vellum beside the main telescope, and set the yellow lantern glass over a small lamp to soften the glare. [297]When the meteor stream began, he marked the arcs, wrist steady, breath animal and measured, and he felt a primal elegance in the way his body answered the sky without words. [328]Between streaks he heard the station's forgotten generators ticking like bones, and in that rhythm his grief rose, not as a storm, but as a tide. [354]He spoke to it the way he spoke to dust on a lens, gently, acknowledging what was there, and the act of naming hurt became a kind of cleaning. [383]Near midnight a meteor flared low and green, and its track on his vellum pointed not toward any cataloged radiant but toward the station itself. [408]The next streak mirrored it, then another, until the paths converged like fingers indicating a hidden seam in the ridge below the antenna array. [432]Lio followed at dawn, carrying his janitor keys and the lantern glass, and he found a collapsed service tunnel sealed since the station's founding during the quietest decades of expansion. [462]Inside, under sifted pumice, lay a logbook wrapped in oilcloth, and in it the first director had written of losing his daughter to fever and building this place to keep listening. [493]The director described the same exercise of tracing meteors, not to predict impacts, but to let the mind practice releasing what it loved, line by line, into the dark. [522]Reading it, Lio understood that the station was not abandoned so much as waiting, a vessel for anyone brave enough to be porous, and his vulnerability stopped feeling like failure. [552]That night he reopened the dome, set the yellow glass on the lamp like a small sunrise, and invited the few remaining technicians to draw meteor paths with him in shared quiet. [584]As each person traced a falling star, Lio watched their shoulders soften, and he empathized with the tremor in their hands, knowing it was the body's honest salute to loss. [614]In the intervals of black sky, flourishing stillness spread among them, alive as lichen, and the old station seemed to inhale, its silence no longer neglect but nourishment. [642]When a final meteor broke apart over the ridge, they marked its brief fragments and laughed softly, not because the world was fixed, but because they had found a way to stand within its breaking.
