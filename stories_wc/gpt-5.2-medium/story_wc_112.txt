<story>Within the hush of beating wings at rest, the xenobiology research station felt like a lung holding its breath. [19] Frost filmed the observation dome, yet radiator grids under the floor gave the corridors an icy warmth. [36] Mara Kline, the obliging sky mechanic, walked those corridors with a tool satchel and a smile that never asked why. [56] Her gloves were mechanically warm, threaded with microheaters that kept grease fluid and her fingers steady. [72] She had been hired to keep the station's wind rigs and landing pylons alive, but tonight Dr. Sen called her to the core lab. [96] On the table, between cages of sleeping glider-beasts, sat the magnetic nexus at twilight, a ring of dark metal sipping the last purple light. [120] The animals' wings did not move, but their thoraxes held the memory of motion, as if dreaming could flap. [139] Dr. Sen's voice was low, tender and sharp, when she said, 'We need a mechanic who can listen to machines the way my team listens to cells.' [167] Mara set her satchel down and watched a hologram bloom over the ring, maps of field lines drawn through holographic principles. [188] Sen explained that the nexus mirrored any nearby biological rhythm, turning wingbeats and heartbeats into geometry, then sliding that geometry along an axis no chronometer measured. [214] If they could control the slide, Sen insisted, they could prove that time moves sideways instead of forward. [232] Mara did not argue philosophy, but the station's clocks had been skipping for weeks, and she wanted a clean cause more than a grand theory. [257] She leaned over the ring and felt a faint tug at her wrist, like magnetism trying to write in her bones. [278] A single brass lever protruded from the nexus housing, and Sen admitted no one on the science crew dared touch it. [299] Obliging as always, Mara tightened her glove straps, levered the brass handle down a notch, and waited for something to break. [320] Instead, the lab lights dimmed into a softer spectrum, and the sleeping gliders gave a synchronized sigh, a subdued awakening without opening eyes. [343] Their wing joints twitched once, twice, then stilled, and Mara heard the station ventilation echo the pattern like a delayed heartbeat. [364] Sen gripped the console, watching the hologram distort into nested corridors, each corridor showing the same moment from a different angle. [385] 'Sideways,' Sen whispered, and Mara tasted the word like cold tea, familiar and strange. [399] In the nearest corridor of light, Mara saw herself enter the lab a minute earlier, but the earlier Mara carried a cracked rotor blade from the roof. [426] That blade had not broken yet, and the vision made her stomach tighten, because a falling rotor could shear open the aviary and wake the gliders into panic flight. [455] Sen wanted data, but Mara wanted the station intact, so she asked for access to the wind rigs before Sen could pull the lever back. [480] With the nexus still humming, Mara climbed to the roof where twilight deepened and magnetic lines in the air raised gooseflesh under her suit. [504] She held a portable projector to the damaged rotor and overlaid it with a holographic model, using the same principles Sen used, but aimed at repair. [530] The model did not just show stress, it showed possible pasts, and she chose the version where the bolt had never loosened. [552] Her wrench turned, and for a breath the metal obeyed that chosen past, seating itself with a click that sounded like relief. [574] Back below, the gliders stirred again, but gently, as though the station had revised its own memory and their bodies agreed to stay asleep. [598] Mara returned to the lab and told Sen that sideways time was not a highway to prediction but a toolbox, and tools required responsibility. [622] Sen stared at the stable rotor readouts and then at Mara's heated gloves, understanding that the mechanic's warmth came from circuits, not sentiment, and could still be kind. [650] Together they reset the lever to neutral, letting the hologram collapse, and in the quiet that followed, time resumed forward motion while keeping its sideways secrets. [676]</story>
