The tidal arbor above the clouds creaked like a ship, its root-bridges rising and sinking with invisible currents as the Station of Siltwood clung to its branches.[27]
Inside, a wistful station pianist named Lio played the departure hall piano with steely longing, listening for the moment when the horizon invites night and the last airship disappears into violet.[58]
On the music stand sat a broken anniversary clock, its hands stuck at the hour his wife had left, and its chime spring was snapped as cleanly as his promises.[88]
The station master kept telling him to throw it away, but Lio carried it from bench to bench because it was proof that time could be damaged and therefore, maybe, repaired.[119]
Above the ticket windows, a rack of compasses for travelers blinked and sputtered, the needles jerking in short panicked arcs, a phenomenon everyone called flickering compasses since the cloud-tides began to reverse.[151]
Lio understood the compasses better than the engineers did, not by equations but by rhythm, and his mind was strategically creative in the way it searched for patterns behind noise.[181]
When the needles flickered, the piano strings would hum in sympathy, and the broken clock would twitch once, as if the station itself were trying to keep an appointment.[210]
One afternoon, a courier slid a small tin across the counter and told Lio it had come up from the archive shaft, from places sealed since the first storm.[239]
Inside was a black-and-white film reel labeled ENCORE, and the courier warned him that the old projection room was condemned, a refuge for rats and regrets.[265]
Lio took the reel anyway, because he had promised himself, after the day the clock stopped, to surprise fate with an unplanned encore rather than accept the final schedule.[294]
He climbed the service ladder into the arbor's hollow trunk, where cloud-mist beaded on old posters, and found the projection booth with its door chained but its lock long rusted open.[325]
In the dark he threaded the reel through the projector, and the first frames showed the station as it used to be, bright as bone, while the soundtrack carried a faint version of his own melody.[361]
Then the film jumped into hidden sections, splices so clean they were invisible until the light hit them, and in those secret minutes the camera drifted through walls and down stairwells that no longer existed.[396]
He realized the reel was a map made of time, and that by following it frame by frame he could move through hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel into the station's forgotten geometry.[430]
As he walked where the film showed, the compasses in the hall below flickered harder, and their scattered needles pointed not north but toward the booth, as if begging him to choose a direction.[464]
At the end of the hidden stairwell he found a room built inside the arbor heartwood, a still pocket where the cloud-tide noise vanished and the broken anniversary clock began to tick in his hand.[499]
A single compass lay on the floor, its needle no longer flickering, and beside it a piano smaller than his own waited under a sheet, like a stage that had been saving its breath.[533]
He understood the trap and the gift at once: this was refuge not from storms but from endings, a place where a performance could loop until the player decided to release it.[565]
Until the horizon invites night, the station would keep sending departures, and fate would keep counting them, but in this room he could practice the one chord he had avoided, the one that said goodbye.[600]
He played it softly, then louder, weaving his wife's favorite folk theme into his own schedule-bound waltz, and with each repetition the clock hands crept forward and the compasses outside steadied.[631]
When the last light thinned, he lifted the piano lid and struck an ending that was not in the film, an unplanned encore aimed like a flare into the dark, and the hidden room sighed as if satisfied.[669]
Back in the departure hall, the rack of flickering compasses went calm, pointing together toward the open skyway, and Lio set the now-living anniversary clock on the piano as the first night ship arrived.[703]
He began to play for the travelers, not to hold anyone here, but to let every goodbye land clean, and the steely longing in him turned into a strength that could finally keep time.[737]
