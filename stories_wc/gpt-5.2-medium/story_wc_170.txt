<story>Spring had opened the city like a wet book, and the echoing terrace above the canal held the scent of new leaves and stone.[24]In the dusky harmony before morning fully arrived, rain slid away from the prism parapet and left it glittering with broken colors.[46]I stood there perceptively calm, because panic could not fit inside the odd loan I carried in my chest, a borrowed heartbeat that was not mine to waste.[74]The healer who lent it to me had warned that it would slow to a stop when the bells rang, unless I returned it with a truth worth keeping.[103]That was why I had come over the hush before bells ring, to find the elusive mirage painter rumored to live between reflections.[126]People said she could persuade mirrors to show possibilities, not memories, and that her canvases were only the bait.[145]I needed a mirror to show me a future in which my sister did not die on the operating table at noon.[167]As the terrace echoed my steps, I heard a child's song drifting up from the market stairs, soft enough to be mistaken for wind.[191]The tune was familiar, a lullaby mothers used, yet its pauses fell in a pattern that made my borrowed heartbeat answer with three quick taps.[216]I remembered the healer's second warning: the painter spoke through coded lullabies in children's songs, so only those listening for more than comfort could find her.[242]I followed the melody to the parapet where rainwater pooled, and in its shifting prism light a figure seemed to appear and vanish with each blink.[268]She was there when I stopped trying to pin her down, a woman with paint on her fingers like dusk, holding a frame but no canvas.[294]"You brought a loaned pulse," she said, and her voice had the same calm as a pond that knows stones will sink.[316]I told her my name, my sister's name, and the hour the bells would announce, and I asked for grace because I had none left.[341]With a flick of her wrist she set a small mirror against the prism parapet after rain, and the droplets became tiny lenses that multiplied the glass.[368]She hummed the market lullaby, but under it ran a second melody like thread, and I felt the code pull at the borrowed heartbeat, asking its consent.[395]The mirror clouded, then cleared into a corridor of possible rooms, each one lit by a different outcome, and in each my sister lay both alive and gone.[423]The painter watched me with perceptively calm eyes, as if emotion was a pigment she refused to waste, and she asked which room I would dare to enter.[451]I saw that in the room where she survived, I had returned the borrowed heartbeat to its owner, a boy in the ward who would otherwise fade before the bells.[481]In the room where I kept it, my sister lived a day longer, but the boy died, and my own chest learned the ugly rhythm of theft.[508]The coded lullaby shifted, offering me the action of grace not as a gift from her hands, but as a choice from mine, and the mirror waited.[535]When the first bell began to breathe in the tower, still silent but gathering, I pressed my palm to the mirror and let the borrowed heartbeat go, and the painter smiled like someone watching a new possibility take root.[574]The corridor of rooms collapsed into one clear scene where I handed the boy his pulse and then guided the surgeons with steadier hands, as if the terrace echo had traveled into the hospital.[608]Outside, rainlight on the prism parapet dimmed to ordinary stone, the lullaby below returned to simple comfort, and the mirage painter stepped backward into the mirror's last glint.[636]When the bells finally rang, my chest beat with my own honest rhythm again, and in the dusky harmony of that spring morning I understood why she stayed elusive: possibilities must be chosen, not kept.[671]</story>
