<story>After surviving the attempt, I walked out of my studio with singed hair and a new quiet in my ears. [20] I am a luminous glass artist, the kind who coaxes light into bottles and window panels until it hums like a held note. [43] The firebomb that missed my kiln by inches left its message anyway: stop asking about the charcoal wagons that came at night. [65] In the ashes I found a charcoal smuggler's ledger strip, torn narrow, edges blackened, numbers half eaten by heat. [84] It felt like a scorched testament, not only to crime but to every breath I had paused between questions and courage. [105] I had always been steadily adaptive, melting failures back into sand and trying again, so I decided to retrace the ledger's route instead of hiding. [130] The strip listed canyon mile marks and three names I recognized from the market, but one line was smeared into a blank pause. [153] To discover purpose in the pauses, I needed that missing line, because whoever tried to kill me feared what it completed. [174] That night I packed a lantern, a glassblower's rod, and the strip wrapped in wax, then followed the dry riverbed into a quiet canyon under stars. [200] The canyon walls held my footsteps in drifting resonance, as if the stone itself remembered every secret shipment. [218] I slept beside a boulder and woke before dawn, when cold laid a thin skin on the sand and the world was all listening. [242] Old trackers in my town read hoofprints, but I had learned to read light, and the only light now was patterns in morning frost. [266] On shaded stones the frost drew lacework maps of where bodies had passed, warmer boots thinning crystals, mule breath making small halos. [288] I moved slowly, letting the rising sun erase clues behind me, and matched each thinning patch to the mile marks on the ledger strip. [312] At the third bend I found a soot-dark camp ring, and inside it a shard of green bottle glass that caught my lantern like an eye. [338] Someone had been copying my work, using my luminous tricks to mark contraband crates, and the idea stung worse than smoke. [359] Farther on, frost outlined two sets of prints that met, hesitated, and separated, the very shape of a conversation that ended in violence. [382] I knelt where the crystals were burned into a bare oval, and I understood how the bomb had been lit here first, rehearsed in the open. [408] The missing ledger line came back to me in that silence: a pause is where a hand decides, and mine could decide differently. [431] I took my rod and scraped charcoal from the fire ring, then rubbed it into the scorched testament until the smeared numbers lifted like ghosts. [456] The line was a delivery to the parish schoolhouse, and the name beside it was the councilman's, the same man who praised my windows at festivals. [482] I could have marched back with proof, but the attempt had taught me that truth needs a vessel, so I chose to make one. [506] In the canyon I built a small furnace from stones, fed it smuggled charcoal, and melted sand until it ran, bright and obedient, into a pane. [532] While it cooled, I pressed the ledger strip's burned edge against the glass so the numbers and the blackened tear became sealed inside, readable only when held to starlight. [561] By sunrise the pane shimmered with trapped soot, and the frost patterns around my furnace looked like wings, pointing back toward town and the schoolhouse bell. [587] I retraced my steps down the riverbed, carrying the glass wrapped in cloth, and each canyon echo softened, as if the drifting resonance had found its chord. [614] At the schoolhouse I asked the children to hold the pane up to the morning window, and the sealed numbers fell across their desks like a shadowed lesson. [642] When the councilman arrived to bless a new donation of fuel, he saw his own name glowing in my glass and went pale, the pause in his speech louder than any confession. [674] Later, as deputies hauled away his ledgers, I returned to my studio and began a window for the canyon, leaving deliberate empty spaces where light would rest between colors. [703] In those pauses I finally heard my purpose: not to burn brighter, but to endure, steadily adaptive, and make every surviving breath a clear testament that cannot be erased. [732]</story>
