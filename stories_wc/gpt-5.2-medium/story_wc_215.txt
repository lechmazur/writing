<story>After ghosts became visible, the desert learned new shadows, and I learned to live with company I could not touch. [20]I was the astonished recluse of an abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland, a ring of cracked hives around a dry spring. [43]The air still smelled faintly of wax, and the wind carried ash that settled on my tongue like vows I never spoke. [65]I kept a stained glass box on the table where the honey press once stood, its panes flecked amber and green as if holding sunlight in pieces. [92]In the years before the Seeing, my sister Mara and I had made a covenant with the valley, a bargain to tend the bees and tend each other. [120]Then the fires came, Mara died without a goodbye, and the covenant knotted itself to other promises, to debts, to prayers, until it became a tangled covenant I could not name. [151]When the dead began to show in plain noon light, they did not speak; they stood near the places that still mattered, and their silence had weight. [178]I was tranquilly perceptive by habit, watching for the smallest tilt of a head or flicker in a phantom hand, because I wanted to preserve the weight of unspoken words. [208]So I would gaze at the apparitions and read them through contextual clues, the way a beekeeper reads weather by the restless pitch of a hive. [234]A man in a soot-burned coat lingered beside the old smokers, and I knew he had been the last courier because his ghost kept reaching for the pouch that was no longer there. [267]A child hovered by the empty water trough, lips parted, and the dust on her knees told me she had died searching for a drink, still too proud to beg. [297]At night the ghosts drew closer to my table, leaning toward the stained glass box as if it were a lantern, and the colors moved over their faces like slow speech. [328]Mara arrived on the first full moon after the Seeing, standing inside the circle of hives with her hair still braided, and my astonishment finally made sound in my chest. [358]She did not answer when I called, but she touched the hive that had been ours, and the gesture pulled memory through me like smoke. [383]Our covenant had always been simple: if one of us left first, the other would keep the bees and keep the stories, so no promise would evaporate into heat. [412]But with the bees dead and the oasis abandoned, the covenant had tangled with the valley's own grief, and now every ghost seemed to be waiting for me to choose. [442]In the stained glass box were thin slips of paper I had collected for years, each carrying a sentence someone could not bring themselves to say aloud before the fires. [472]I had salvaged them from pockets, from burned desks, from beneath stones, and sealed them away because words kept unspoken feel heavier than spoken ones. [497]Now the ghosts clustered as I opened the box, and the colored panes caught the moon and spilled it across the room, a mute eloquence that made even my breath careful. [528]Mara's ghost bent over the papers, and I understood, through contextual clues of her steady hands and the way she faced the hives, that she wanted the covenant untied, not stored. [559]The valley did not need my hoarding; it needed release, so the living could stop walking around their own unfinished sentences like barbed wire. [583]I carried the box outside to the dry spring, set it on the cracked stone, and one by one read the slips aloud to the listening dead. [610]As each line left my mouth, a ghost softened, then stepped backward into the scorched air, as if hearing the words finally gave them permission to go. [637]When I reached Mara's slip, only her remained, and it said, I forgive you for surviving, so I gazed at her until she nodded, and the oasis felt, for the first time since fire, like a place that could be tended again.
