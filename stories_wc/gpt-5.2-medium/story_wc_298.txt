<story>Within the glow of half-lit corridors, the catacomb orchard breathed damp sweetness under the city. [15]
Tree roots snaked between bones, lifting skulls like pale apples, and every step rang with soft clacks. [32]
Mira came alone, a reckless idealist with dirt on her knees and a lantern she refused to turn up brighter. [52]
Bright light, the elders warned, trammels the dead into waking, and she had no wish to harm what rested. [71]
She was fiercely gentle by nature, the sort who bandaged a thief before calling a guard, and it had ruined her life. [93]
In her pocket lay a burned tarot card, The Star, its edges curled, its promise blackened but not erased. [112]
It was proof of her first bargain, made when her brother Jory returned from the war with holes in his soul. [133]
He smiled and spoke, yet something leaked through him, and his shadow no longer matched his feet. [150]
The city healers offered salves and sermons, but Mira wanted a patch, a stitch, a sure return of whatever was missing. [171]
So she found the Orchard of Quiet Trade and learned its core law: destinies can be bartered like fruit. [190]
A broker takes a thread from one life, knots it to another, and both walk away changed, sometimes saved, sometimes doomed. [211]
Mira had paid with her own future joy, trading it for Jorys wholeness, and the card had burned in her palm to seal it. [235]
Tonight Jory was worse again, as if the knot had slipped, and Mira came to demand the trade be mended. [255]
She walked by inlaying meaning everywhere, reading the angle of roots as runes and the bone heaps as punctuation. [274]
When a femur pointed east, she turned east; when a root crossed another like an X, she knew to wait. [294]
The half-lit corridors ended at a clearing where trees grew straight from rib cages, and lanterns hung in their branches. [314]
There sat Madam Vey, destiny broker, her ledger on a tomb lid, her smile thin as onion skin. [332]
Mira set the burned card down and said, You took my joy once, and I did not complain, but you owe my brother his soul. [357]
Vey traced the cards char, then tapped the ledger, and the clearing seemed to tighten, as if the roots listened. [377]
No trade is owed, she murmured, only renewed, and renewal requires fresh collateral, because fate hates unpaid debts. [395]
Mira felt the old loss flare, the place in her chest where laughter should have lived, and she steadied it with dusky resolve. [418]
What do you want, she asked, though she already knew: another slice of her life, another bright thing to extinguish. [438]
Vey offered a cruel option, the kind brokers loved, to barrow a strangers clean destiny and trammel it onto Jory. [458]
It would patch him, yes, but it would leave someone else hollow, and Mira could not make a savior out of theft. [480]
Instead she asked to see the knot itself, and when Vey hesitated, Mira lifted her lantern, not brighter, only higher. [500]
The light slid along the roots, showing a thread of silver caught among them, stretched between a childs tooth and Jorys name. [522]
Someone had tugged at it, selling off pieces of his restored future, and the broker had looked away to keep profits clean. [544]
Mira did not shout; she only placed her fingers on the thread, fiercely gentle, and offered Vey a new bargain. [564]
Take my ability to forget pain, she said, and in exchange you will bind Jorys destiny to mine so no one can harvest it again. [589]
To make it binding, she burned the tarot card completely on the tomb lid, ash falling like dark pollen into the bones. [611]
Vey watched, unsettled, because a broker expects desperation, not a woman who inlays meaning everywhere and chooses suffering as a lock. [632]
The silver thread tightened, looped around Miras wrist, and settled into her skin, and in the orchard the skull apples stopped clacking. [654]
In the days after, Jorys shadow returned to his feet, while Mira woke each morning with yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn. [675]
She did not regret it; she walked those half-lit corridors again sometimes, listening to the roots and bones, keeping watch over their shared fate. [699]
Under the trees that grew from the dead, her resolve stayed dusky but steady, and the holes she had feared became seams she could live with. [725]</story>
