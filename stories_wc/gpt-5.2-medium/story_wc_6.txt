<story>When the migration of clouds began, the coast went quiet, and I walked the boardwalk toward the volcanic beach, wearing my station jacket over the burn-scarred shoulder I never hide. [30]  
People in town still called me the arsonist's daughter, but I had become a firefighter anyway, gracefully alert in every gust, trained to read smoke and also the small tremors in a voice. [63]  
My father sat in prison for lighting the old pier, and my mother left us with nothing but a foreign coin, drilled and strung on red thread, which she said would keep me from burning the world back. [101]  
I wore that coin under my collar like a pulse, and on nights when sirens woke the dunes, I held it and practiced unyielding compassion, imagining the families behind the flames rather than the headlines. [136]  
The day our engine sank into soft sand near the obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes, dispatch said it was a brush fire, but the sky smelled wrong, sharp as kerosene and grief. [168]  
We hiked in with packs and shovels, and I scooped a handful of black sand from the volcanic beach, letting its grains slide through my glove to judge wind and moisture the way my captain taught. [204]  
At the lagoon's edge, where kelp drifted in lazy ribbons and the water mirrored the moving clouds, we found a shack blazing, not from lightning, but from a line of accelerant running like a fuse. [239]  
Inside, a teenage boy cried for his sister, and when I crawled under the choking rafters, I saw my father in his face, the same stubborn chin and the same panic at what fire can do. [275]  
I dragged the boy out, then went back, because compassion is not a feeling that waits for permission, and my radio crackled with orders I could not obey while someone still breathed. [307]  
In the back room I found the sister pinned by a fallen beam, her leg burned raw, and as flames chewed the doorway I braced the beam, slid my trauma shears under cloth, and cut. [342]  
The beam would not lift, so I did the ugly thing I had learned in wilderness medicine, a field graft of skin from her unburned thigh to cover the exposed muscle, buying time for the ride out. [379]  
She screamed once, then gripped my wrist, and I showed her the coin on its red thread, telling her to match her breaths to the swing, to let pain pass like clouds. [411]  
When we burst into daylight, the lagoon looked impossibly calm, kelp drifting, dunes whispering, and the black sand shining as if it could absorb every story people tried to bury in it. [443]  
Later at the burn unit, the surgeon praised my quick graft and my calm hands, but I watched the girl stare at her bandaged leg, afraid the scar would make her life smaller. [476]  
I told her why I became a firefighter, not to erase fire from my family, but to prove that scars can sing, because mine had taught me where others hurt and where I could help. [511]  
She asked how a scar sings, and I brought her a jar of black sand and said each grain was a note, and we could choose whether to grind them into silence or pour them into rhythm. [548]  
The arson investigator came the next morning and showed me the same coin I wore, found as a token at the shack, and for a moment my throat closed with the old fear of inheriting my father. [585]  
I asked to see the evidence bag, and there, in the drilled hole, was a different burr mark than mine, which meant someone had copied the charm, hoping to frame me or summon my father's legend. [621]  
Instead of hardening, I went back to the obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes at dusk, stood where the kelp-drift peace softened the world, and left my own coin tied to a rescue post. [654]  
If the copycat returned during the next migration of clouds, I wanted them to find a message of unyielding compassion, that we answer burning with saving, and that even the worst family fire can be grafted into light. [692]
