<story>When the forests held elections, the sky above New Cascadia flickered with polling drones and old northern lights, like history trying to remember itself. [24] I was called a luminous skeptic because my skin carried the faint glow of diagnostic ink, yet I doubted every miracle the state advertised. [48] Still, I had a private question, the kind you keep folded in a pocket with forbidden photos, about why some people seemed to carry weather with them. [75] My grandmother used to do it, calling fog in from clear noon, and the Bureau said it was just microclimate talent, hereditary and harmless. [99] After she died, the apartment felt too still, and nostalgia for her storms pushed me to take her tin compass ring from the keepsake drawer. [124] It looked like a toy, dull and cheap, but the ring had a trick the engineers now called an emergent compass, a direction that formed only when you listened right. [154] Grandmother taught me the listening method by making me taste the air, and I found the ring warmed whenever sweetness shifted toward metal on my tongue. [180] Sensing through taste changes sounded like superstition, but my luminous patches recorded ionic swings, and the ring translated them into a subtle pull. [203] The pull led me out beyond the city walls to Lavender Bluff, where wild lavender grew in engineered terraces above basalt cliffs and the aurora worked in slow green ribbons. [233] On election nights the forests voted by shifting leaf voltages, and the whole coast smelled of ozone and sap, as if the land itself were speaking. [259] I came there because the Bureau had marked a cluster of weather carriers as security risks, and I needed to know whether my grandmother had been one of them. [288] The ring did not point north, it pointed to a feeling, a terrestrially cosmic gravity that made my ribs hum like an old radio tuning between songs. [315] I followed that hum along the bluff until the lavender thickened and the taste of the wind turned from citrus to iron, and the compass pull strengthened. [342] At the farthest promontory a circle of people stood with their palms out, each wrapped in a different weather, one in drizzle, one in dry heat, one in snow that never touched the ground. [376] They watched me carefully, used to cameras and raids, and I raised my glowing hands to show I carried only questions and a ring. [400] A woman with thundercloud hair asked why a Bureau skeptic would seek them, and I said I wanted to learn why some people carried weather with them, even when it hurt. [431] She nodded toward the aurora and said the forests elect their councils by balancing water and charge, and the carriers are the moving ballots, the ones who can converge distant atmospheres. [462] The word converge was not metaphor, because as they stepped closer to each other my tongue tasted sudden spring rain, and my ring spun until it aligned with the center of their circle. [495] In that alignment, their separate weathers stitched together into one calm dome, and inside it I heard my grandmother's laugh in the hiss of sleet turning to mist. [523] Thundercloud Hair told me my grandmother had been a carrier who refused to serve the Bureau, so she hid her ballot in the tin ring and taught taste listening to her child. [555] The emergent compass, she explained, was not a map to places but to agreements, pointing toward the next person willing to share a sky rather than own it. [583] If I joined their circle before dawn, my glow and doubt would keep the convergence honest, and the forests would read our combined weather as a vote for mercy. [612] I should have refused, but the taste of the air had already changed, from iron to warm bread, and it felt like my grandmother putting a hand on my shoulder. [642] We converged under the aurora on the lavender bluff, a futurist ritual wearing an antique tenderness, and my tin compass ring settled, finally sure, as the forest tallies began. [671]</story>
