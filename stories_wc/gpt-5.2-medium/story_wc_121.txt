On the glowing viaduct after rain, Lysa walked above the river traffic, boots ringing on wet glass tiles that held a faint light as if the storm had charged them. [30]
She was a gravity defier by trade, hired to repair aerial sensors, and she could step off a railing and hang there, listening, until her body remembered which direction was down. [61]
Tonight, in the hush between the drop and the ripple, she felt the world pause at the instant a bead of water fell from her sleeve and had not yet kissed the river. [94]
In that paused interval she was periodically eternal, trapped for a few heartbeats in a loop where every choice could be tried, undone, and tried again, and it was why she still had work. [128]
A glint near a maintenance hatch drew her, and she floated sideways to it, fingers finding an ancient clay tablet with runes pressed deep like cuts that had healed into symbols. [159]
The tablet was warm despite the rain, and when she wiped it clean the characters rearranged themselves, as though the script were reading her back and deciding what story she deserved. [190]
She had spent years trying to conquer the labyrinth of self, the private maze of fears that made her drift away from people the moment they expected weight and commitment from her. [222]
So she tucked the tablet into her tool bag and started to retrace her route along the viaduct, hoping the runes were a map, but each step split her into versions that chose different tiles. [257]
The city around her dimmed and flared, a darkening brightness, because the tablet had cracked the present into fractured timelines that ran side by side like wet tracks of light. [287]
In one strand she was alone on the bridge, in another a patrol drone hovered, in a third her younger self leaned over the rail, and all of them looked at her with the same tired eyes. [324]
A rune on the tablet pulsed, and she understood it was not showing a single path but generating paths, building a living labyrinth through procedural generation, the way her repair software simulated storms to test sensors. [360]
If she could learn the rules, she could walk any branch and still return, but the price was facing the versions of herself she had abandoned, each one holding a memory she had dropped. [394]
She stopped at the place where the water bead finally hit the river, and time resumed with a soft ripple, yet her periodically eternal gift let her slip back to the suspended instant whenever she inhaled. [430]
Using that breath held moment, she tested the generated maze, stepping left then right, watching which timelines collapsed and which persisted, until the tablet taught her that fear always produced the widest branching. [463]
Her younger self appeared again, not accusing, just waiting, and Lysa realized the labyrinth was built from the times she had floated away from love to avoid being pulled down, each avoidance a new corridor. [498]
She knelt on the shining tile, took out the ancient clay tablet with runes, and pressed it to her chest, choosing one timeline where she stayed, where she let gravity have her, where she asked for help. [535]
The runes steadied, no longer rearranging, and the other strands folded into the chosen one like pages closing, leaving the viaduct brighter for a moment before the clouds returned and tinted everything charcoal. [568]
She rose heavier than before, still able to defy gravity when she needed to, but now she used the power to retrace her way back to the city doors, carrying the tablet as proof that her self maze had an exit. [609]
