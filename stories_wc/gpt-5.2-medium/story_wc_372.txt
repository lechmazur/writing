<story>Above the cloudline, the Archive of Altostratus hung in a quartz hush, its frozen windows ringing softly whenever wind brushed the ice. [22]
Ilian, the orderly records chief, walked the aisles with a lantern dimmed to blue, gently meticulous even in cold that bit through wool. [45]
Each shelf held jars of captured mirages, and each jar, once opened, shed its illusion into air and then into memory. [66]
His work had always been to make inventories, but lately the visions dissolved faster, as if the world below forgot how to dream. [89]
He measured their decay not with clocks but by sampling frequencies, counting the tremble in their light the way one counts a heartbeat. [112]
While illusions fade to memory, he told himself, the Archive must learn what remains. [126]
Tonight a courier from the lower cities arrived breathless, carrying a cracked case that hissed with trapped warmth. [144]
Inside lay a magic lantern slide, a thin rectangle of glass filmed with silver, and at its center a curl of script that shone without flame. [170]
The courier said it had been taken from a wedding altar during an evacuation, when the chapel walls became smoke and the bride vanished mid vow. [196]
Ilian accepted the case with both hands, feeling the heat leak away, and the fear behind the gift made his throat tighten. [218]
If the slide went dark, another promise would fall off the edge of oblivion, and the Archive would be only a museum of forgetting. [242]
He carried it to the Lumen Room, where lenses slept in frost and the ceiling held a lattice of crystals to catch projected words. [266]
The librarians called such words luminous vows, because they glowed brightest at the moment they were sincerely spoken and kept a trace of that sincerity. [291]
Ilian slid the glass into the projector and began to measure its pulse, turning a dial until the script flickered in harmonic bands. [314]
He noted the peaks in a ledger, then checked them again, because accuracy was the last kindness he could offer strangers he would never meet. [339]
At first the vow read only, I will, and the rest was fog, but the frequencies told him where missing syllables should live. [362]
He traced those gaps onto paper and listened, not with ears, but with the fingertips of his mind as the projector's hum mapped sound into light. [388]
Beyond the window, cloud seas rolled under the library, and auroras crawled like slow ink, but inside all motion felt suspended in ice. [411]
As the slide warmed, a second line emerged, and with it an image of two hands joining over a bowl of river stones. [434]
The vow wanted a witness, and Ilian understood that his measuring was also a form of witnessing. [451]
He remembered his own sister, lost years ago when the sky roads collapsed, and how her last letter had been filled with careful, unfinished sentences. [476]
To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion, he had to let the slide borrow something from him, so he whispered a promise of his own into the room. [505]
The crystals caught his breath, and the script steadied, resolving into, I will carry you through the unremembering, even when names thin to dust. [529]
A final frequency spike rang, and in that spike he saw the vanished bride not as a body, but as a bright intention pressed into glass. [555]
He wrote the reconstructed vow into the Archive index, tagged the slide for deep freeze, and sealed it in a drawer that would outlast storms. [580]
Yet he did not feel finished, because the act of keeping had changed him, and the ledger now seemed like a mirror in which he could not look away. [609]
Before dawn, he returned to the window and watched the cloud sea brighten, and he vowed, in the same quartz hush, to measure every fading illusion until the last of them learned to mean. [643]</story>
