<story>On Pomona Drift, an orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, pilot Lysa Marek kept her skiff low over the terraces while the air around the arches held a whirling silence that made even engines seem like thoughts. [38]Every seventh day gravity inverted for an hour, and during that hour the trees lifted their roots like pale fingers, stones rose, and the irrigation ribbons unspooled upward, so she had learned to fly by watching water flow instead of trusting the horizon. [81]Lysa was an intrepid orchard pilot because the orchard councils paid in seed rights, but she flew for another wage: to find the source of resilience, whatever kept these groves alive when storms sandblasted leaves and the soil itself forgot its nutrients. [123]The older farmers spoke of a gathering of echoes somewhere beneath the arches, a place where past winds and voices looped in the rock until they thickened into guidance, and where a single shard of metal could teach a sapling to endure. [165]She had dismissed it as superstition until she found a broken arrow tip lodged in a branch after a raider skirmish, and the next morning the injured tree had sealed its wound with new bark that smelled of rain, as if time had hurried. [209]The arrow tip, dull and pitted, carried an odd attribute that accelerates plant growth, and when she tested it on seedlings in her cabin the stems stretched in minutes, then steadied as though coached to be strong rather than merely fast. [250]She decided the metal was a compass of sorts, and on the next inversion hour she would use it to discover where it had been forged or blessed, because a weapon that healed trees might also heal people and this planet's tired ground. [293]At the appointed dusk the world tilted, and her skiff and the orchards rose toward the violet sky while loose fruit orbited in slow arcs, and in that lifted stillness she listened for the faintest rush of water moving opposite its habit. [335]Below her, the irrigation channels now climbed the slopes like glass ladders, and she navigated by water flow, following the bright threads into a canyon where the floating rock arches formed a ring that turned without sound around a hollow center. [376]The arrow tip grew warm in her palm, tugging her toward the hollow, and when she crossed its threshold the whirling silence tightened until she could hear only her own heartbeat and, underneath it, many heartbeats layered like echoes of orchards long gone. [419]She set the skiff down on a slab that hovered as calmly as a dock, and the air filled with the gathering of echoes the farmers had promised, not voices exactly but repeating patterns of drip, root, and wind that made maps inside her mind. [464]In the center stood a tree grown from bare stone, its leaves motionless yet spinning in her vision, and embedded in its trunk were countless arrow tips, each cracked as if shot into the planet itself to stitch it together. [504]A final echo, sharp as flint, showed her the origin: in the first drought, orchard pilots had turned their weapons into grafting tools, firing metal seeds into trunks so the trees would heal faster, share water, and remember how to grow through hardship. [547]As gravity began to right itself, Lysa pried her broken arrow tip free from her pocket and pressed it into the stone tree beside the others, accepting that resilience was not hidden in one miracle source but in a chorus of choices, and she lifted off guided home by the returning downward water.
