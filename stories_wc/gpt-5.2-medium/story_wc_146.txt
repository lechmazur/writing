<story>Before the collapse, Lumen Gate still stood, an ancient archway of basalt that swallowed sound and returned it as echo. [20]Under it, the cobblestones ran like a frozen river through a town already half ghost, doors latched, ovens cold. [39]In that wild hush between leaving and staying, a cryptic bell tuner named Sava listened harder than anyone breathed. [58]He carried an ebony tuning fork in his coat, black as drowned wood, and treated it like a compass. [77]The town council had paid him to tune the belfry, but he told them the bells were only symptoms. [96]What was sick, he said, was balance shared between streets and hearts, and it was slipping out through the stones. [116]At dusk he sat beneath the archway and waited, infinitely patient, as the last carts rattled away. [133]When a wheel snapped in the distance, the air shivered, and the cracked facades answered with a dull ring. [152]Sava lifted the fork, struck it against the stone, and held the vibrating prongs near his ear without flinching. [171]The note was too high, like a warning bird, and he nodded as if hearing a confession. [188]He paced the main street and counted his steps on the cobblestones, heel to toe, setting a rhythm the town could remember. [210]Each pattern of footfalls made the fork hum differently, and he wrote the changes in chalk on abandoned shop windows. [230]He was not mending a melody for show; he was preparing to rebuild the place from its own pulse. [249]The archway, he believed, was the town's ear, and the street beneath it was its throat. [265]If he could bring their frequencies back together, people would stop drifting, and the empty houses would quit sounding like coffins. [286]Night after night, before the collapse that everyone predicted but no one named, he walked until his soles bled. [305]At first only stray dogs followed, padding in counterpoint, but Sava welcomed them as metronomes with tails. [322]He tapped the fork on the archway when their rhythm wavered, and the dogs adjusted, obedient to the unseen beat. [342]A girl named Mara, left behind to guard her father's kiln, watched him and finally asked what he was tuning. [362]Sava answered in riddles, saying, 'The interval between your step and mine, so we do not topple alone.' [381]Mara did not understand, but she heard how the hush around the street became less frightened when he spoke. [400]She joined his walking, and soon the two of them made a braided rhythm, one fast, one steady. [418]As their footsteps struck true, shutters unwarped, and a sagging lintel in the bakery eased back into level. [436]They tested it again, circling the block, and the stones replied with a low, contented resonance. [452]Word traveled on the few remaining tongues, and others returned cautiously, drawn less by hope than by the new quiet. [472]Sava set them tasks that sounded like games: walk in threes, pause on the cracked blue tile, breathe on the count of seven. [495]With every corrected cadence, the bell in the belfry rang once without being touched, as if the tower were waking. [515]Mara began to see that the town had been built like an instrument, and neglect had thrown its joints out of tune. [537]Still, the threat remained, because beyond the hills the mines were failing, and the governor planned to abandon the district. [557]On the morning the decree was due, Sava led the growing line of townsfolk under the ancient archway for one long measure. [579]Their footsteps, via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones, set the fork singing so deep that dust rose in spirals. [599]The bell answered, then the kiln chimed, then even the dry fountain gave a wet note, and the decree carrier stopped, listening. [621]In that sound the townspeople felt their grief align, and the carrier folded his paper, saying the district had proven itself alive. [643]Sava, still cryptic and infinitely patient, tucked away the ebony tuning fork and watched Mara smile as the ghost town revival turned into home, shared balance restored. [670]</story>
