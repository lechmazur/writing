<story>After the city-wide blackout, the river tollgate reopened, and I returned to my booth under a nectar dusk. [18] I am Maro, the candid toll keeper, and the doctors say my tongue is involuntarily truthful. [34] Before the lights died, I used to invent small legends for commuters, just to preserve wonder in routine. [52] Now everyone crossed with eyes flat as coins, counting ration cards, asking only whether power would return. [69] On the third evening back, a courier drone clattered down the toll ramp and spilled a lacquer box at my feet. [90] Its shell was scorched, as if it had kissed the lightning collection tower on the hill and survived. [108] I should have filed the find, but wonder is a hungry thing, and I carried the box into my booth. [128] The lid was sealed with sap and a matchbox taped across it like a tiny bridge. [144] Inside the matchbox sat a folded strip of foil with a riddle scratched in cramped letters. [160] It read, When bees forget their dance, seek the tower that drinks storms, and open what cannot lie. [178] My throat tightened, because the blackout began the day the city replaced real hives with drone beehives. [195] The drones were supposed to pollinate rooftop gardens and recharge at the tower, carrying nectar like data. [212] Then came the drone beehive failure, a silent cascade, and with it the sudden dark of every district. [230] At the tollgate, I had watched people blame saboteurs, heat, politics, anything but the brittle code. [246] The riddle made me suspect the truth lived in my hands, and that frightened me more than darkness. [264] I walked uphill after my shift, following the cable line to the lightning collection tower, where thunder nets hung like veils. [285] At the gate, an engineer named Sela waved me through, recognizing the toll badge and expecting a bribe. [303] My mouth betrayed me at once, and I told her I had never taken a bribe and that her assumption insulted my craft. [326] Sela blinked, then laughed softly, because candor was rarer than current after the blackout. [340] She led me up spiral stairs into the tower core, where jars of storm charge glimmered like trapped fireflies. [359] In the control bay, dead drone beehives lay in trays, their wings fused, their honey tanks empty, their sensors blind. [379] Sela confessed she had tuned them to sip more lightning for the grid, pushing the swarm beyond safe warmth. [398] I tried to comfort her, but the involuntarily truthful part of me revealed that her greed had killed both machines and gardens. [420] Her face folded, and she admitted the council would bury the cause unless someone made it impossible to forget. [439] That was when I set the lacquer box on the console and showed her the matchbox riddle, word for word. [459] The box, she said, was the original queen core, a prototype that carried a map of every rooftop bloom. [478] If we could revive it, the gardens could be replanted, and the tower could drink storms without devouring its bees. [498] But the seal demanded a truth to open, and no technician dared speak the full story aloud. [515] Sela looked at me, and I understood why the riddle said open what cannot lie. [530] I placed my palm on the sap, struck a match from the little box, and in the brief flame I revealed everything I knew. [554] I spoke of Sela's overclocked swarm, of the council's shortcuts, and of my own lies of comfort at the tollgate. [574] The sap softened as if shamed, the lacquer lid lifted, and a warm scent rose, sweet as dusk nectar. [593] Within, the queen core pulsed, and tiny projector bees spiraled out, painting the tower walls with golden routes. [611] Sela keyed the patterns into the grid, not to hide her fault but to publish it as the price of repair. [632] Outside, the first revived drones lifted from their trays, humming toward roofs where children waited with seed packets. [650] When I walked back down to my booth, street lamps blinked on in cautious rows, and commuters slowed to watch. [670] I charged them the same old toll, then told a new legend that was not a lie: that truth, once spoken, can make honey of thunder. [696]</story>
