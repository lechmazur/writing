<story>Above the acid sea, my gears-and-cogs workshop drifted on pontoons that hissed where spray kissed brass, and every bolt rang like a prayer in a dead temple. [27]I am Lysa, an uncertain alchemist, because certainty melts here faster than iron, and the fumes that rise through the floorboards make even my formulas tremble. [53]On my belt hangs a key ring charm, a small loop of keys welded to a shard of riverstone, and it is the only thing that never corrodes. [81]I found it years ago in the palm of a drowned navigator, and when I turn it, I hear his last bubbles and remember my own first mistake. [109]In the lowest bay of the workshop stands a centuries-old statue of a woman with closed eyes, rescued from a wrecked cathedral ship, her surface cratered with pockmarks like constellations punched into stone. [142]The statue is my map and my oracle, because I can only read my life by matching the pockmarks on her cheeks and throat to the scars on my hands and the dents on my tools. [178]Each match releases a memory as if it had been trapped in the stone, and my mind quilts memories together, stitching a pattern from what the acid fog tries to erase. [209]Tonight the pontoons have begun to soften, and the whole shop lists toward the green churn, so my motivation is simple and terrible: to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion before the sea takes the gears and me. [248]I brew a neutralizing draught, swallow it, and climb down into the flooded bay where the statue stands half submerged in clear water held behind glass, a pocket of safety the old builders called the Lung. [284]Between breaths held underwater, I press my forehead to her brow and narrate, because speech is the only spell that still obeys me in this dire enchantment. [311]I tell the statue about the navigator, about how his key ring charm opened my first lockbox of reagents, and how I lied to myself that alchemy was control instead of surrender. [343]My air thins, but I align a pockmark shaped like a crescent with the crescent gouge on my left thumb, and the water around the statue shivers to show me the night I cracked my brother's cure and watched him fade. [384]I surface, gasp, and pour molten gold into the fracture lines of my own regret in the ledger, practicing kintsugi intentions: not to hide what broke, but to honor the break as the seam that can hold a vessel together. [424]When the workshop groans again, I understand the statue is not asking for more potions, only for an honest pattern, so I clip the key ring charm to the main drive gear and let its riverstone weight become a counterbalance. [464]I dive back into the Lung, hold my breath, and match a cluster of pockmarks on her ribs to the dings on my wrench, and the memory quilt tightens until it reveals a design for patching the pontoons with gold-laced resin and humility. [507]In the minutes that follow, I work the pumps and pour the resin into the blistering seams, and every time the acid tries to chew through, the golden repairs flare like small suns, turning my earlier failures into anchors instead of weights. [549]The statue's face, seen through rippling water, seems almost merciful, and I realize my narration has been a tether; without it, I would be only chemistry in a sinking box, not a person choosing what to become. [586]One last pockmark sits at her throat like a puncture, matching the hollow at the base of mine where fear collects, and I speak into the water that I forgive the brother I could not save, and the self who tried. [627]When I climb to the deck, the workshop has steadied above the acid sea, and the keys on my charm clink with the turning gears, a reminder that repaired things still carry their cracks, but they can float, and so can I.
