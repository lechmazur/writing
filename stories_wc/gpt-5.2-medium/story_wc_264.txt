<story>After the last forest burns, the nights do not fall so much as fracture, a lullaby sung in broken measures over ash and quiet rails. [25] I was the dreamless freight guard on the Farline, paid to listen for thieves and for the small static of cargo that wants to remember what it used to be. [55] At mile marker Zero, the train stopped where the desert had turned into a glowing dune in bloom, each grain lit from within as if dawn had gotten trapped under skin. [86] The company called it a relay depot, but the old handlers whispered divergent archive, because the dune kept every version of every shipment ever sent, layered like choices that never agreed to collapse. [119] In the guard shack, nailed beside the manifest board, hung a chess clock frozen at midnight, its twin faces staring at each other as if waiting for the first move of a game nobody would admit they were playing. [158] I did not sleep, not ever, and without dreams I had learned to patrol the empty hours by tending to what others missed, my private motivation to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners of ruined things. [195] Those sparks were real here: stray photons that fell out of history when the forests went up, and they skittered along the bloom like fireflies, vanishing whenever I blinked, because the archive made everything occasionally everywhere. [231] The handlers taught me the method through wave functions, a way of listening to the dune until its many possibilities hummed in my bones, and on my first watch I tried to charm the clock, tapping its cracked casing in a rhythm that matched the rails. [277] The instant my fingers found the beat, the frozen hands shivered, and the shack opened like a paper fold, showing shelves of ledgers that were also dunes, also train cars, also charred groves that still smelled green in one branch of the record. [320] I walked those shelves without moving, guarding freight that might have been seeds or bullets depending on which page I touched, and I heard, under the humming, a thin crying where a crate of lantern wicks had never arrived, leaving a town to freeze in darkness. [366] In that divergence, the people had burned the last orchard for warmth, repeating the end I lived after, and I understood why the clock was set to midnight: it marked the moment a choice could still turn, if someone held both times at once. [410] So I let the wave functions split me, step by step, until I was guarding every car and every ledger at the same time, my voice a fractured lullaby as I whispered a charm over each unlit corner, coaxing sparks into wicks, into mouths, into the soil where forests might return. [461] In one aisle I rerouted the missing crate by nudging a switch I could not see, in another I stood on the bloom dune itself and planted glassy ember seeds between the grains, and in a third I simply listened, keeping thieves away from hope. [506] Each time my attention drifted, the chess clock clicked though its hands never advanced, reminding me that guarding was not stasis but balance, and that midnight could be held open only by constant care, like keeping a coal alive in a tin. [548] Near dawnless morning, company auditors arrived with a device meant to collapse the archive into a single profitable history, and their boots dulled the dune's glow, but I met them in many places at once, a quiet guard with no dreams to bribe. [591] I offered them the only charm I trusted, not a spell to fool their eyes but a pattern of choices sung through wave functions, and when they heard the different towns breathing in the ledgers, they backed away, leaving me to nurse the bloom until light could spread beyond my watch.
