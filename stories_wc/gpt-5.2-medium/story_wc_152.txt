<story>In the cobalt observatory, autumn wind pressed dry leaves against the dome and the halls answered with echoed silence. [19]  
Liora, the palace's galaxy chart embroiderer, sat under the central oculus with hoop and needle, stitching starpaths onto dark linen for captains who trusted thread more than ink. [47]  
It was three weeks before the coup, when everyone spoke in careful phrases, and she climbed here at dusk not to spy but to listen for unheard stories in the gaps between official reports. [81]  
On the brass rail beside her burned a flame from the eternal candle, taken from the shrine below, steady enough to show each stitch yet old enough to have witnessed every lie the city had ever told. [118]  
To the sentries she looked foolish, humming off key and letting her braid unravel, because she had learned that wisdom traveled farther when disguised as foolishness and no one feared a seamstress with smudged fingers. [153]  
But in her stitches she kept a second map: a web of small errors copied from intercepted flight manifests, and by following those errors through adjacent possibilities--what if a ship delayed, what if a gate misfired--she began unraveling conspiracies that would soon harden into violence. [198]  
The observatory's cobalt walls held a clockwork orrery that could synchronize with the city's signal beacons, and tonight Liora set her needle down, placed the linen over the turning spheres, and waited for the patterns of light to align with her thread. [240]  
Master Kest, the astronomer, stepped in without knocking, pretending to scold her for wasting lamp oil, yet his eyes slid to the eternal flame and his voice softened into code: 'Do the stars still giggle at you, little stitcher?' [279]  
She laughed too loudly, as if simple, and answered, 'They giggle because they know where the ships go when no one watches,' then traced a constellation in the air and described three routes that existed only as adjacent possibilities, each ending at the same hidden dock. [325]  
In the pause that followed, the dome returned her words as echoed silence, and Kest admitted the Council Guard was moving arms there to fund the coup; to prove it, they had to synchronize the orrery's beacon timings with her stitched map so the signal logs would match the contraband departures. [376]  
Liora lifted the flame from the eternal candle in a glass cup and held it over the orrery, because the shrine fire was the one light that never flickered between realities, and as the spheres turned the flame cast twin shadows that revealed which possibility the conspirators had chosen. [425]  
When the beacon tones finally lined up with her stitches, the air itself seemed to click, and faint transmissions surfaced like whispers from under ice: dockworkers bribed, pilots threatened, families paid to stay silent, a whole chorus of unheard stories trapped inside numbers. [468]  
She wrote none of it down in plain speech; instead she embroidered the voices into her chart as misaligned starbursts, so that anyone searching her room would see only a bad artisan, while Kest, reading the hidden logic, watched the conspiracy unravel thread by thread. [513]  
Boots rang on the stair, and a Guard lieutenant entered, demanding to know why the beacon machinery was running; Liora blinked wide, babbled about 'singing planets,' and, still smiling, nudged the orrery half a tooth so the lieutenant's own badge lantern synchronized to the wrong rhythm, slipping him into the adjacent possibility where the log would exonerate her. [571]  
After he left, puzzled and laughing at her, she and Kest sealed the embroidered chart inside a telescope tube and sent it to the river printers who still dared publish truth; the observatory fell back into echoed silence, but now it sounded like a held breath, and Liora kept listening, certain that before the coup the city could still choose another story.
