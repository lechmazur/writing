<story>At twilight the luminous fort of Lyr kept its lantern-glow even as the city below slipped into an unexplained blackout. [20] In that sudden hush, every gate became a mouth clamped shut, and I, the vigilant lock sentinel, listened for teeth. [40] My post was the Archive Door, where brass tumblers nested like sleeping birds around a bronze quill holder bolted to the lintel. [62] The holder was supposed to cradle only pens, but in our fort it cradled sparks: tiny stolen charges from the old lightning rails. [85] We called that secret cache the Cradle of Sparks, and it was why the Overseers insisted I never blink. [104] Tonight, though, the blacked-out city made the Overseers blind as well, and the fort's bright skin glowed alone like a wink. [125] I am calmly inventive by habit, the kind of guardian who rewires a lock while pretending to polish it. [144] So when the blackout arrived, I took it not as a threat but as a curtain, and began my intrigue. [164] The revolution we wanted had to be silent, a shift of hinges and habits, because the fort punished loud heroes. [184] I had promised the scribes and cooks and junior lantern-keepers that I would spark it with nothing more than angles. [204] Those angles lived on the fort's western terrace in a half-painted sundial, abandoned mid-renovation when the Overseers diverted funds to shackles. [225] Its pale arcs were unfinished, but the coded angles in that half-painted sundial still pointed to times no clock would admit. [246] During the blackout, the terrace lamps stayed on, fed by our hidden charges, and the sundial's shadow drew a sharp line anyway. [268] I carried the bronze quill holder in my satchel like a relic, feeling the sparks inside tick against its metal ribs. [289] At the terrace I set it on the sundial's bare center peg, where a painter had left a ring of raw wood. [311] Then I rotated the holder until its base aligned with three scratches I had carved weeks ago, each scratch matching a forbidden meeting place. [335] The coded angles were our language; if the shadow cut the first scratch, the kitchens would lock their doors and leave the keys in bowls. [360] If it cut the second, the scribes would misfile ration orders so patrols starved for paper, not food. [378] If it cut the third, the lantern-keepers would dim every corridor except the ones that led to our hidden stair. [398] Tonight the shadow, absurdly crisp for a lightless city, slid to the third scratch, and my throat warmed with a private laugh. [420] A winking hush held the fort, as if even the stones were in on the joke and dared the Overseers to notice. [442] I tipped the holder, letting one stored spark jump into the sundial peg, and the peg answered with a soft blue pulse. [464] Below, along the walls, locks that usually snapped at midnight eased open by a hair, just enough for friends to slip through. [486] I returned to the Archive Door before any patrol could wonder, and stood again like a statue, sentinel to my own mischief. [508] Captain Orven arrived with a lantern that burned on battery, frowning at the blackout and at me as if I could confess it. [531] He demanded the master key, and I calmly showed him the quill holder instead, explaining that the Archive needed ink even in darkness. [554] While he inspected the harmless bronze, my fingers, hidden in my sleeve, rolled a thin pick that opened the inner tumblers with a sigh. [578] The door swung inward on silent hinges, and the first of our lantern-keepers slipped out of the archive stairwell, eyes bright in the gloom. [602] Orven turned too late, because the corridor behind him was already dimmed, and the only light left was the one that guided our feet. [626] In the blackout we moved like ink across paper, trading keys, swapping orders, freeing wrists, and leaving no anthem but a satisfied click. [649] By dawn the Overseers would find every lock still intact, yet none truly theirs, and the Cradle of Sparks would sit empty, smiling. [672] I resumed my watch as the fort brightened, and when the city lights returned, I kept my face neutral and my revolution quietly alive. [696]</story>
