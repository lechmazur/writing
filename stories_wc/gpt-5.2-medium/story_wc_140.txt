<story>My death certificate says I drowned three years ago, yet I walk the Port of Larkspur breathing salt air. [19]The clerk who filed the error apologized once, then the record hardened, and my name slid off every screen. [38]In a city that measures itself by cargo, being officially dead is a kind of invisibility that pays in cash. [58]I took work at night, guiding forklifts through a towering labyrinth of shipping containers where numbers replaced neighborhoods. [76]Between stacks labeled KX and MZ, I felt the absence of street names like missing teeth. [92]The maze changed across the rhythm of tides, as barges arrived on the flood and left gaps at the ebb. [112]When water rose, container walls threw back voices, and when it fell, the ground exposed old chalk marks. [130]I learned to keep my own voice low, because my mind filters reality differently and turns sound into touch. [149]A shouted order struck me like burlap, while a whisper from a dockworker could feel like wet silk. [167]That odd sense made me hungry not for facts but for the texture of memories, for what a past feels like. [188]Since my own history had been erased by paper, I started building another one out of other people. [206]I did it by collecting fragments of overheard stories, small shards caught between container corners and diesel engines. [224]A stevedore told his apprentice about a grandmother who hid ration coupons in a teapot, and I saved the sound. [244]A customs agent joked about a musician smuggling violins in produce crates, and the joke left a citrus sting. [263]At home I wrote nothing down, because paper could betray me again, so I layered the fragments in my head. [283]Layer by layer, the container maze became a map of lives that the city never bothered to archive. [301]One low tide, when the wind smelled of kelp, I found a torn label from a poison bottle stuck to a pallet. [323]The label carried a skull icon and the words MEMORY SOLVENT in faded red, as if it knew my appetite. [343]I slipped it into my glove and felt its paper bite, like a warning with teeth. [359]That night I listened harder, searching for anyone who had heard of solvent that could strip a person from records. [379]A woman in a neon vest mentioned a shipment seized years ago, chemicals used to wipe ink and blur film. [399]She said the barrels were rerouted through Larkspur anyway, because the port fed on forgetting. [414]Her words hit me as dry sand, and I recognized the same grit in the clerk's apology, rehearsed and empty. [434]If someone could erase cargo manifests, they could erase a living man by changing a single line. [451]I followed the tide clock for a week, returning at each ebb to the pallet yard where the label had waited. [472]With every visit I added new overheard fragments, until a pattern formed like barnacles on a piling. [489]The pattern pointed to Container 9H, a rusted box nobody logged, parked where floodwater lapped its doors. [506]At slack tide I pried it open and found rows of file folders sealed in plastic, all stamped DECEASED. [525]Names, dates, and photos were smeared as though someone had brushed them with my label's solvent. [541]I should have been afraid, but the discovery warmed me, because it proved my vanishing was not a personal curse. [561]In the back lay a mirror, and in its tarnished glass my face looked like everyone I had listened to. [581]Without a legal name, I had become a vessel, and the stories I layered gave me shape only while I held them. [603]I carried the folders out one by one and hid them in different stacks, letting the labyrinth protect what was left. [624]As the tide rose, I stood in a corridor of metal and whispered the rescued names, feeling each syllable as fabric. [645]I did not claim them as mine, yet the port air thickened with memory, and my own erased history gained a grain. [667]By dawn the water covered my footprints, but the layers inside me held, and I walked on, nameless, alive. [686]</story>
