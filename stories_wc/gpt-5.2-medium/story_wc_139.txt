In the funeral home prep room, the air tasted of disinfectant and roses that refused to die. [17]
Mara rinsed her gloves, listening to the drain gurgle like a throat clearing itself. [31]
She was a con artist's honest child, which meant she learned numbers and lies in the same cradle. [49]
Her father Ivo could sell a stranger his own shadow, but Mara kept a ledger in her head. [67]
Her ledger held one impossible equation: how much truth was enough to buy safety. [81]
On the stainless table lay a woman in a plain dress, tagged as unclaimed. [95]
Mara had washed the body's hands with care, because even the nameless deserved symmetry. [109]
Beside the scalpel tray sat a vintage ink pot, squat and black, with a brass lid worn smooth. [127]
The embalmer called it Mercy, and swore its ink liquefies rigid thinking. [139]
Mara had laughed until she saw the way any rule book softened after a line was written with it. [158]
Ink from Mercy bled through official forms, turning boxes into open margins where a person could explain. [175]
That was why Ivo wanted it, and why Mara hid it under the towel rack. [190]
He arrived without knocking, smiling at the corpse as if greeting a client. [203]
Behind him stood a thin man with a bruised temple, his passport torn into two clean halves. [220]
"This is Sami," Ivo said, "and he needs political asylum before the men at the border notice he is missing." [240]
Sami's eyes fixed on the woman's tag, as if unclaimed was a verb that could happen to him. [258]
Mara asked what he had traded for this request, because she was always hunting the mathematics of a fair trade. [278]
Ivo answered for him: a favor, a story, and a cut of whatever relief money came later. [295]
Mara heard the familiar shuffle in those terms, the way her father arranged risk so others paid it. [313]
Sami spoke softly, saying he had published proofs that the government called treason, and the prison had already written his name. [334]
The prep room's fluorescent lights made his skin look embalmed, yet his pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence. [354]
He needed an affidavit, a sponsor, and a clean identity, and Ivo planned to manufacture all three. [371]
Mara knew the asylum interview would be a wall of rigid questions, and the slightest lie would become a breach they could exploit. [394]
She pulled Mercy from hiding, set it on the counter, and felt its cold base steady her. [411]
If the ink liquefies rigid thinking, she thought, it might also liquefy her father's certainty that everyone can be bought. [431]
She told Ivo she would help, but only by waiting actively, studying each step like a proof. [448]
Ivo mistook this for obedience and began rehearsing a false narrative, polishing it with charm. [463]
Mara instead wrote Sami's real story in Mercy's ink, filling the margins with dates he could remember and equations he could defend. [485]
She mapped his fear into numbers, not to reduce it, but to show consistency where officials expected contradiction. [503]
At the same time she prepared the unclaimed woman for viewing, stitching and combing until death looked ready to speak. [523]
When the door buzzer sounded and two uniformed agents entered, the room seemed to inhale formaldehyde. [539]
Ivo stepped forward with his practiced grin, but Mara held up the affidavit pages, still wet at the edges. [558]
She asked the agents to read the margins first, because the boxes were for slogans and the margins were for people. [579]
One agent scoffed and demanded Sami's passport, and Ivo reached for the torn halves like a magician revealing a trick. [599]
Mara stopped him and slid the woman's toe tag across the counter, a silent reminder of what happens when a name is mishandled. [622]
The agent's face tightened, then softened, as Mercy's ink shimmered where it had soaked through the paper. [639]
He began asking questions that were less like traps and more like openings, and Sami answered with calm, checkable detail. [659]
Ivo watched his con collapse, and in that collapse Mara saw her first honest breach in the wall between them. [679]
Outside, the agents made a call, then returned the papers and told Sami he would be moved to a shelter to await review. [702]
Ivo opened his mouth to bargain, but the prep room's quiet labor had already priced the truth. [719]
After they left, Mara cleaned the table, capped the vintage ink pot, and placed it beside the unclaimed woman's folded hands, feeling life keep working even here. [746]
Ivo stood in the doorway, smaller, and asked how she knew what was fair, and Mara said, "I do not know, but I keep calculating." [771]
