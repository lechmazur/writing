<story>Mist hugged the old rail depot, beading on rusted signs and softening every lantern into halos. [16]Inside Bay Twelve, a repair shop lived where ticket counters once were, smelling of oil and cedar. [33]Lio Vance ran it with a magnetic calm that made hurried travelers slow their steps. [48]He was a heartfelt artisan, famous for mending anything that could still be loved back to work. [65]Though blind since childhood, he oversaw every bench by listening to tools and to people. [80]A thin fountain ran through the shop floor in a channel of slate, fed by the depot's condensation pipes. [99]Lio leaned over it often, examining light refraction through water features the way others examined blueprints. [115]Light told him angles, and angles told him where a broken thing wanted to go. [130]That morning the depot trembled with distant cheers from the harbor as an anchor lifted for a ship's maiden voyage. [150]The new steamship, the Meridian, would carry rail freight beyond the cape, if it could find a path through fog. [170]A courier in a wet coat rushed in and set a small crate on Lio's counter without speaking. [188]The crate shook with a faint whir, like a trapped insect trying to remember the sky. [204]Lio asked for the story, and the courier finally breathed, "Its guidance bird failed two hours before launch." [222]From the crate he lifted an artificial hummingbird drone, its copper feathers bent and its lenses clouded. [239]On the Meridian, the drone was meant to scout currents and relay wind pressure as chirped feedback in real time. [259]Captain Sera had built her route around those signals, translating them into direction while the fog hid every buoy. [278]Now she sent the drone to Lio because he, too, lived by decoding feedback into direction. [294]He set the hummingbird on a felt pad and ran his fingertips along the warped frame, listening for the wrong tensions. [315]A crack near the wing joint sang back with a dull click, and Lio nodded as if greeting an honest confession. [336]He asked the courier to open the depot doors, so mist and harbor light could slip inside. [353]At his request, the courier poured clear water into the slate channel until the fountain ran in a steady sheet. [373]Lio held a glass prism above the stream and turned it, feeling the warmth of the beam shift across his knuckles. [394]When the light split and rippled through water, he heard it in the room, a soft hiss where colors met stone. [415]He aligned the drone's cracked wing under that moving spectrum, letting refraction map the bend in the metal. [433]With calm hands he cut a patch from thin brass and shaped it until the water lit it evenly. [452]He soldered by sound, counting the brief sizzles, and the joint tightened without a tremor. [467]Next he cleaned the clouded lenses, then angled them so the drone would read fog glow the way a moth reads moon. [489]The courier watched, uneasy, until Lio invited him to place his palm on the workbench and feel the vibration. [508]"That is how I oversee," Lio said, "not with sight, but with the truth things return when you touch them right." [529]Outside, the harbor horn boomed again, and the depot's glass roof shivered as the Meridian began to drift from her moorings. [550]Lio released the drone into the air above the fountain, and its wings stitched a tight figure eight through the misty light. [572]It chirped in bright pulses, then in worried stutters, and Lio tilted his head until the pattern settled. [590]He wrote the new calibration in raised dots on a tag for Captain Sera, translating the chirps into bearing cues. [610]When Sera arrived, boots dripping, she did not ask how he fixed what her engineers could not. [627]She listened as he described the fountain's light and the wing's reply, and her shoulders lowered into trust. [645]"Send it ahead of you," Lio told her, "and treat every chirp as a question the sea is answering." [664]At the quay they watched the Meridian's anchor chain rise, water spilling from each link like beads from Lio's channel. [684]The hummingbird darted into the fog, singing steady now, and Sera turned her wheel toward the sound, guided by repaired faith. [705]</story>
