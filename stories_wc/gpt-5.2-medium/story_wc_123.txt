<story>After being followed home from the weather office, I kept my face calm and my notebook dry, because the habit of recording storms had taught me that panic only blurs detail. [31]In the quiet courtyard at dusk behind my rented rooms, jasmine vines and rain barrels held a hush so complete that even my breathing sounded like a barometer ticking. [60]I was a meticulous storm recorder by trade, but credibly curious by nature, and I had come here to nurture integrity in solitude, away from the committee that edited other people's data until it agreed with policy. [97]Tonight the follower lingered on the street side of the courtyard gate, a silhouette where lantern light fell short, and I pretended to check the clouds while I listened for the cadence of their steps. [132]A soft thump interrupted that rhythm as a carrier pigeon dropped onto the fig tree, shaking off dust, and the small leather message tube on its leg flashed briefly like a wet match in the dim. [168]I coaxed the bird down with a pinch of millet, slid the tube free, and felt the paper inside tremble with urgency, though the courtyard remained tranquil enough to hear a distant kettle beginning to sing. [204]The note carried a stamp from the Health Bureau, yet the handwriting was my sister Mara's, warning that a rogue quarantine zone had been raised overnight around the old riverside warehouses, outside any legal order, and that my name was on a list. [247]If I went straight to the bureau I would be detained or drafted into their false reports, so I chose the only method my storms had ever rewarded: to intuit the truth by progressing laterally, one careful step at a time along the edges. [291]I left the gate unlatched as if inviting the watcher in, then slipped through the inner passage, crossing neighbor to neighbor by low walls and shared laundry lines until the city noise softened into the river's breath. [329]On rooftops I read wind shifts, and on alley corners I read people, noticing how every patrolman avoided the warehouse district as if the air there carried blame, which told me the quarantine was meant to hide something, not heal. [369]At the first barricade the boards were fresh and the warning signs were printed on yesterday's ration paper, but a gap at the waterline let me slide sideways behind stacked crates, close enough to hear coughing that did not sound human. [410]Inside the zone, men in bureau coats were pouring disinfectant into the river while a generator hummed, and the smell of chlorine mixed with rotting grain, a layered tranquility that tried to pass as safety while my stomach measured it as fraud. [452]I found Mara in a locked loft where pigeons were kept for official messages, her wrists rubbed raw, and she whispered that the quarantine was a cover for dumping untreated fever cultures, because the committee wanted a new outbreak to justify permanent emergency powers. [496]To free her without a hero's spectacle, I used my notebook to copy the discharge logs and storm times, then sent the pages back in the same carrier pigeon's message tube, trusting that honest data, once airborne, could outpace any fence. [537]We escaped by the riverwalk, moving laterally again through reeds and service tunnels until the quarantine sirens faded, and when we reached my courtyard the dusk had deepened, but the jasmine still held its calm, and for the first time I felt integrity had company. [582]Beyond the gate the same silhouette waited, yet now it watched the empty street, misled by my unlatched invitation, and I wrote down the evening pressure and the truth I had learned, promising myself that solitude would remain a choice, not a cage.
