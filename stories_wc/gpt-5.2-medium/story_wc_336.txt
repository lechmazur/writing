<story>Upon the hush of budding hope, when the orchard's first buds held their breath, I followed Master Soren, the wise orchard pruner, up the verdant parapet beside a waterfall. [29]Mist from the plunge drifted over the stone rail and beaded on his shears, and the air itself sounded like a hymn sung under one's tongue, a radiant hush that made secrets feel safe. [63]Soren said the trees were listening for the right cut, because every branch carried a memory of color, and he had sworn to preserve the color of wonder before it leaked from our world. [97]I was his newest helper, insatiably creative and forever inventing new grafts and trellis patterns, yet lately my ideas came out gray, as if my imagination had been frostbitten. [126]He paused at a pear tree growing from a crack in the parapet, its roots drinking spray, and he showed me an heirloom seed kept in a locket of applewood at his throat. [159]This seed, he said, had been carried through famines and wars, but now it mattered for stranger reasons: it was a knot in the weave between worlds, and it could anchor a passage. [192]When the orchard people slept, Soren would go to the waterfall and listen for the second current inside the first, the one that ran backward into the unlost place where colors were born. [225]He taught that pruning was not subtraction but translation, and that by capturing essence from what we cut away, we could succor both the tree and the traveler who crossed over. [256]From his satchel he lifted clear jars, each lined with beeswax, and as his blade kissed a bud he held the jar close, catching the brief exhale of green and sealing it with a twist. [291]The jars glowed faintly, as if the sap's thoughts had been bottled, and he made me write the names of the essences in ink the color of their scent, a lesson my hands understood. [325]At dusk, when the parrots in the valley went quiet, he placed the heirloom seed on the wet stone and arranged the jars around it like lanterns, and the waterfall's mist braided between them. [359]Then he asked me for one thing I feared to give, and I admitted that my sketches had been losing their colors because my little sister Nela was sick, and my worry kept stealing blue. [394]Soren nodded as if he had been waiting for that shade, and he said our weaving between worlds was not for thrill but for care, because wonder without succor becomes a painted mask. [427]He opened the locket, pressed the seed into my palm, and guided my fingers to the jar marked BLUEBELL, telling me to pour its essence onto the seed and think of Nela's laugh. [460]The drop landed with a sound like a bell underwater, and the seed swelled, throwing off threads of light that stitched into a doorway in the falling water, a seam only pruners could see. [494]We stepped through, and on the other side was the orchard as it might have been in the first morning, every leaf edged with luminous pigment, yet bruised patches spread where people had stopped believing. [529]Soren moved with the calm of his trade, pruning the bruised limbs, and by capturing essence from their darkened sap he fed it to the glowing trees, which drank and returned color like breath. [563]I found a patch shaped like my own fear, and instead of cutting it away I drew it in the air, lines of cobalt and silver, and the world answered my insatiably creative gesture by turning the drawing into fruit. [603]When we returned through the waterfall seam, Soren carried that impossible fruit and laid it on Nela's tongue, and she slept while its captured essence seeped into her, restoring the missing blue in her cheeks. [638]At dawn, the orchard outside our window looked brighter without shouting about it, and Soren, hands nicked and gentle, told me the seed would be replanted on the parapet so our worlds stayed woven, and wonder kept its color.
