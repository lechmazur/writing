<story>In the glass atrium beside a quiet brook, Lysander Rook waited for the city council to arrive, his dueling coat hanging open so the brass ribs of his mechanical arm could cool in the morning air.[36] He had been invited as a philosopher, but the invitation carried the unspoken expectation that he might also fence, because the brookside atrium hosted treaties and feuds under the same glittering roof.[68] Lysander called his temperament diplomatically fierce, meaning he would bow to an opponent, speak softly of mutual benefit, then drive an argument to the marrow until it yielded a direction, for his private motive was to turn questions into destinations.[108] While waiting, he studied the half-painted sundial mounted on the atrium wall, its numerals still sketched in charcoal, its gnomon a temporary slat, and he suspected it was more than a timepiece.[140] A rumor in the archives spoke of a hidden overture, a musical plan smuggled into civic art, and that the plan could be read only via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial.[173] From his pocket he drew a danish tin sewing needle card, the kind sailors used to keep needles from rusting, and slid its punched holes over the slat, using the card like a protractor.[207] Each hole framed sunlight differently, and as the beam struck the unfinished paint, the angles resolved into a sequence that matched notes in the council anthem, but rearranged into a route across the city like steps in a dance.[246] He had just traced the final interval when Magistrate Veller entered with two guards and a smile too polished to be sincere, declaring that such measurements were improper without permission and asking, with courtly words, for Lysander to surrender the card.[287] Lysander answered in the same register of etiquette, explaining that the council would benefit from knowing where its own song wanted to go, yet his mechanical arm clicked as he tightened the wrist joint, because Veller was known to steal maps and sell them as policy.[333] When Veller reached for the needle card, Lysander stepped back onto the tiled strip marked for ceremonial duels, drew his thin practice blade, and invited the magistrate to settle the matter by fencing, a challenge phrased as if it were a negotiation clause.[376] Dignified chaos filled the atrium as the guards hesitated, the brook murmured under the glass, and the first clash rang like a cymbal, Lysander parrying with steel while his mechanical arm acted as a second shield, absorbing thrusts with a hiss of valves.[419] Between exchanges he kept his eyes on the sundial, letting Veller drive him in arcs that mirrored the coded angles, so his footwork would memorize the hidden overture as a path, not just a melody.[454] Veller fought with impatient brilliance, but Lysander was fierce in a diplomatic way, offering openings that looked like concessions and then closing them at the last instant, until a twist of his brass fingers snapped the magistrate's blade aside and pinned the man's sleeve to the painted wall.[502] In the silence that followed, Lysander lifted the danish tin sewing needle card for all to see and recited the anthem notes as their new order, turning them into place names, bridges, and gatehouses, while the delayed councilors finally arrived and realized the atrium itself had been composing instructions for years.[553] He explained that the hidden overture was an evacuation and pilgrimage plan left by the city's founders, meant to guide citizens to higher ground when the brook became a river, and that Veller's thefts would strand people in questions with no route out.[596] The council ordered the magistrate arrested, but Lysander asked that Veller be allowed to walk the first leg of the route under guard, because a destination teaches faster than a lecture, and as the sun shifted, the half-painted sundial threw a clean line across the floor like a baton signaling the overture to begin.[650]</story>
