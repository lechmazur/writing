<story>In the sound wave garden, reeds of glass hummed and the ponds rose in ripples shaped like staff lines.[19] Rovan, a cool-headed fisher, worked there at night, listening for fish that swam through music instead of water.[37] He carried no net, only a rail spike polished smooth, because metal remembered straight tracks even in a place that curved sound.[59] When he struck it against a stone, the spike rang once and then held its note like a hook waiting in air.[81] Above the garden, the constellations did not sit still; they sleepwalked, dragging their star feet across the sky, and every misplaced step changed the tide of sound below.[109] The elders called it the season when patterns break themselves, when familiar melodies forget their endings and return as something hungry.[130] Rovan had come for that hunger, because he believed the goddess Sileth left an echo in the broken patterns, and he meant to catch it.[155] His sister Mera tended the garden gates, and she had a strange gift that transliterates emotions into marks that any throat could sing.[178] When fear passed through her, she wrote sharp angles; when hope stirred, she wrote curves, and Rovan used her pages as bait.[200] Tonight she pressed a sheet into his palm, its ink still wet with longing, and whispered, "Do it by voicing silence, or the echo will bite you back."[228] Rovan nodded, set the rail spike at his belt, and walked into the garden with the measured calm of someone who had learned not to argue with storms.[256] The path was a ribbon of sand that responded to footsteps, so he moved in a zigzag, breaking his own rhythm to keep the sleepwalking constellations from matching it.[285] Every turn made the reeds howl softer, like wolves trying to remember a lullaby, and the ponds quivered with chords that did not belong to any human song.[313] At the center stood the Wave Arbor, an arch of vibrating vines, where the oldest melodies were said to brood, feral and half asleep.[337] Rovan pinned Mera's page to the rail spike, lowered it into a pool that shimmered with starlight, and waited for the inked longing to translate itself into sound.[365] He did not hum; he opened his mouth and shaped the absence of hum, voicing silence until the air around his tongue turned dense as water.[391] The pool answered with a thin thread of resonance that wrapped his wrist, tugging him forward, and in the sky one constellation stumbled as if it had snagged on his line.[422] Patterns broke themselves all at once, and the garden erupted into overlapping harmonics, each one a path, each one a predator, and Rovan chose the quietest.[448] He followed it in zigzag again, not from fear but from respect, because the echo of a goddess would slip away from any man who marched straight.[475] At the far edge, under a trellis that vibrated like a throat, the silence he voiced thickened into a figure made of soft static, and it sang without sound.[504] Rovan lifted the rail spike, and the figure's song poured into it; Mera's transliterated marks flared, turning his chest ache into readable runes along the metal.[530] He understood then that Sileth's echo was not a prize but a warning, a lullaby with teeth, telling the garden to keep breaking patterns so no tyrant could predict it.[560] To keep it safe, he let the spike fall into the pool, sealing the runes and the echo together, and the sleepwalking constellations above eased into a gentler drift.[589] When dawn came, the sound wave garden was quiet as a held breath, and Rovan walked back to Mera with empty hands and a cool head, carrying only the feral lullaby inside his ribs.[623]</story>
