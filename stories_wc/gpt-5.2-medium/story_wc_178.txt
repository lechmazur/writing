<story>In the dusky harmony after the last governor fled and before the new banners rose, Nabu-iddin kept watch from a reimagined Babylonian palace of glass roofs and baked-brick arches.[29] Between regimes, the courtyards were quiet enough for an astronomer to hear his own measurements, and frugal enough for him to reuse every clay tablet as a star chart.[58] He was frugal by habit and by grief, counting copper nails and also counting nights, because the palace treasury had been stripped and the sky still paid in steady light.[88] His students had scattered, yet he continued an empirically ironic routine: he trusted only what the gnomon and sighting tube confirmed, even while he cataloged omens for patrons who no longer existed.[120] One evening a mason repairing a collapsed corridor offered him a small object instead of wages, a magic square tile of lapis glaze, its nine cells stamped with cuneiform numbers.[150] The mason swore it had come from an older floor, hidden under rubble like a secret, and Nabu-iddin, who hated waste, accepted it and wrapped it in linen from a discarded curtain.[182] At his table he drew schematic representations of the tile, the palace, and the constellations above them, then tested the numbers against his recorded positions of Jupiter and the Moon.[212] The sums always matched, row and column and diagonal, but so did something else: when he mapped each number to a star name in the palace archive, the sequence spelled a vow.[244] It was encrypted devotion, written not for a king but for an unnamed presence that watched between the worlds, and it ended with instructions to uncloak what had been kept veiled.[275] He laughed once, softly, because the irony was measurable: the tile demanded faith, yet it demanded it in the language of arithmetic that he could verify with his own hands.[305] In the palace a stairwell had been bricked up since the previous dynasty, and the vow on the tile suggested that a door would open only at the moment when Mars crossed the Lion.[339] Nabu-iddin waited three nights, eating thin barley cakes and recording angles, until the red point slid to the appointed place, and then he carried the tile to the sealed corridor.[369] He set it into a square depression in the plaster, and with no thunder at all, the bricks loosened as if remembering an older arrangement, revealing stairs that descended into cool darkness.[401] Below lay a chamber that made the ancient palace feel reimagined again, its walls inlaid with metal lines like circuit traces, turning old myth into a map of forces.[430] On a pedestal stood a bronze mask draped in black cloth, and beside it a rack of tablets carved with schematic representations of eclipses, floods, and coronations.[457] The tile's vow guided his fingers to arrange three tablets in a pattern matching the magic square, and when he did, the cloth on the mask slackened and slipped away.[487] He had uncloaked nothing less than a face without features, a smooth mirror that reflected his eyes and also the starfield, as if the unknown were borrowing him to look back.[518] A voice did not speak, yet meaning arrived through the diagrams around him: the covenant would be sealed only if he offered what he most conserved, not gold, but certainty.[548] He understood then why the devotion was encrypted, why it survived purges and fires between regimes, because it was meant for someone who might never arrive in human history at all.[579] To seal a covenant with the unknown, he took his most trusted instrument, a bone stylus etched with his calibration marks, and snapped it in two, laying the halves on the magic square tile.[613] The mirror-face darkened to the color of evening water, and in that dimness he saw new constellations drawn as schematic representations across his own palms, coordinates for a sky no empire owned.[645] When dawn came, the palace above stirred with distant boots and fresh proclamations, but Nabu-iddin climbed out quietly, frugal still, carrying only the tile and an empirically ironic peace, devoted to what he could not name.[681]</story>
