<story>After the beekeeper's last visit, the waterfall never smelled of clover again, only of wet stone and rosewater from the bakeries. [21]Behind that monumental curtain of water, the grotto city of Nemea held its breath in caverns lit by museum lamps and prayer candles. [44]Maris Dellen, a cultured museum guide with a historically oriented mind, recited dates to travelers as if chronology could keep the ceilings from cracking. [68]Now her tours were mostly for displaced persons who had fled the drowned coast and slept in alcoves between exhibits. [88]They listened politely, yet their eyes kept drifting to the exit tunnels, measuring how fast they could run if the Council ordered another eviction. [112]Maris carried, in a velvet pouch, an emerald-tinted opera glass lens rescued from the old theater, and she used it to read faint inscriptions on waterlogged props. [139]Through that green circle she could see the gold leaf under mildew, and it made her stomach twist with a sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour. [166]The arts were dying here, not with applause but with mold, and she had promised herself she would rescue what she could. [188]The promise began the day her mother taught her their family custom of baking bread shaped like initials, loaves that carried names even when papers were lost. [215]For years those letter-loaves had been only a Sunday joke, but in Nemea they became a quiet registry for the unregistered. [236]Maris baked at night in the museum kiln, perfuming the galleries with rosewater so the hungry would not panic at the smell of damp cloth and medicine. [263]Each morning she placed the warm initials beside the cases of instruments, and the displaced persons would find their own letter and know they were seen. [289]But the Council still wanted the museum cleared, claiming history belonged to settled citizens, not to refugees who might stain it with grief. [312]When the notice arrived, Maris led the families behind the theater backdrop, down a passage where the waterfall's spray had frozen into a door of ice. [338]The old stagehands had sealed their last painted scrims and scores there years ago, waiting for a thaw that never came. [359]Maris pressed the emerald lens to her eye and saw, inside the ice, the faint black curves of musical notes, suspended like insects in amber. [384]If the Council found that cache, they would sell it to surface collectors, and Nemea would forget it had ever sung. [405]She asked the refugees for help, and in return she offered not money but a place in the story, a role, a chorus, a craft to keep. [432]They brought kettles, blankets, and the beekeeper's last jar of honey, saved since his farewell because no one knew when sweetness would return. [455]Maris mixed the honey into dough, shaped huge initials for every family, and baked them until the crusts were dark as varnish. [477]Still steaming, the loaves were stacked against the ice door, and the heat began to thaw a seam, slow drops tapping like a metronome. [501]Rosewater from the crust rose with the cold mist, and the scent made everyone shiver, remembering weddings and funerals at once. [522]As the ice softened, Maris slipped the emerald lens into the gap and watched the inner chamber brighten, her dread blooming because light meant discovery. [547]When the door finally gave, the displaced persons filed in and lifted the scrims, careful as conservators, while Maris narrated their provenance in a whisper. [572]They carried the rescued art back to the main grotto and hung it across the museum hall, turning the eviction shelter into a temporary opera house. [598]That night, beneath the thunder of the monumental waterfall, children sang from the thawed scores, and adults ate their own initials, tasting honey, history, and fear. [624]At dawn the Council guards arrived, but the hall was filled with costumes and the smell of fresh bread, and even they hesitated to trample a stage. [651]Maris guided them as she guided everyone, pointing through the emerald lens at dates on the scrims, explaining that a city without memory makes permanent refugees of its children. [680]She offered the captain a loaf marked with his own initial, and when he broke it, steam and rosewater rose like a warning that mercy could also be tradition. [709]The guards left with their boots damp, and Nemea kept singing, not because the dread was gone, but because the arts had been thawed back into breath. [736]</story>
