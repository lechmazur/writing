<story>While the universe hums its secret song, Lira walks the rim of the Hollow Canyons and listens for the voices that return. [22] She is a canyon echo singer, trained to braid a note into stone so the answer comes back truer than memory. [43] Richly perceptive, she can tell a living echo from a trick of wind by the thin tremor like reed-blown melancholy. [63] The elders say some people echo because they were born too close to the gorge, but Lira sings to learn why some people echo when they stand in any room. [93] Her brother Senn did, and every sentence he spoke returned a heartbeat later in a softer, stolen voice that frightened him. [114] The day he vanished, he left her a whispering seashell half, pale as moon bone, that murmured fragments of conversations not yet had. [137] When she pressed it to her ear, it spoke her name in Senn's echo, then fell quiet as if someone had noticed. [159] That night a messenger from the city of Saltglass arrived with a sealed ribbon and a warning that the Nexus Choir wanted the shell. [183] The ribbon carried only a map inked in spirals toward the serpentine nexus under starlight, where many canyons met like interlaced snakes. [205] Lira had heard of that place in songs that never resolved, and she knew webs of intrigue were knotted there, using echoes as couriers. [229] She decided to go, not to bargain, but to ensure Senn's voice was not being used to trap others in their own repetitions. [252] Traveling alone, she followed the map and let the shell guide her, because its whispers changed with each mile, through progressive disclosure of what it had overheard. [279] First it repeated a dockside argument about a missing singer, then a priest's confession that echoes could be planted like seeds in a throat. [303] Later it offered a child's riddle about two shells that were once one, and Lira began to suspect her half had been split from a twin. [329] At the mouth of the nexus she met Jaro, a silent guide whose shadow echoed him instead, answering her questions in gestures a second late. [354] He took no payment except one note from her song, and when she sang it into his palm she felt the note return colder, as if skimmed by another listener. [384] Together they wound down among star-silver rocks until the canyons formed a spiral chamber where every sound made a luminous thread in the air. [408] There, masked singers waited along ledges, plucking those threads like harp strings to weave messages that could not be intercepted by ordinary ears. [431] Their leader, a woman called Mael, greeted Lira with Senn's own echo and revealed the other shell half hanging at her throat. [453] Mael said Senn had joined the Choir willingly, trading his self for power to listen beyond walls, and that his echo was proof of the bargain. [479] Lira answered with a low melody that made the chamber tremble, and in that vibration she heard the lie: Senn's echo carried pain, not pride. [504] Jaro stepped forward, and his delayed shadow spelled out the truth on the stone, one word after another, because he too had been robbed of an original voice. [532] The Choir harvested echoes by pressing paired shells to a victim's lips, siphoning their second voice into the nexus where it became a tool in the intrigue. [559] Mael lifted her shell half to complete the pair, but Lira sang a counter-phrase, gentle and mournful, that loosened the luminous threads and set them quivering free. [586] As the threads snapped, hidden voices spilled from the stone in layered returns, and among them Senn's true voice rose, faint but whole, calling her by the childhood name no thief knew. [618] Lira reached for both shell halves and joined them, and the new shell did not whisper secrets anymore; it sang origins, showing that people echo when someone has stolen the part that says I am. [653] Mael tried to flee, but the chamber now returned her footsteps too loudly, betraying her to her own accomplices as their web unraveled in frightened glances. [679] At dawn, still under fading stars, Lira and Senn walked out with Jaro, carrying the restored shell to ensure any stolen echoes could be given back, one song at a time. [710] The canyons answered her farewell with softer, kinder returns, and the reed-blown melancholy in her throat became not sorrow, but a promise to listen for what was missing. [738]</story>
