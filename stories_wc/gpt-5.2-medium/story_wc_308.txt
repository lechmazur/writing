<story>In the canyon of endless echoes, towers of bone rose like bleached organs of old giants, and in their shade a harmonic stone skimmer named Oren listened for direction. [29]He had survived through centuries of layered dust, polishing his basalt body with sand and keeping a reverence for every skull rung and femur pillar, because history was the only map that never moved. [63]The elders of his kind could skim stone as if it were water, but Oren wanted a harder trick: to learn to navigate without moving, to cross distances by thought and tone alone. [96]They called it a pulse left wandering, a beat that slipped free of the heart rock and drifted the canyon searching for a new anchor. [121]If he could catch that pulse, he believed he could ride it, not with his feet but with his inner resonance, and arrive at any place that shared its rhythm. [151]For guidance he carried a stone arrowhead found wedged between two ribs of a fallen tower, a relic from people whose songs had once named every bend in the gorge. [181]Oren was historically reverent, so before using it he appraised the arrowhead, turning it in the thin light and tracing its chipped edge to judge the maker's intent and the age of the strike. [215]The arrowhead's faces held faint striations that matched the canyon's own sound lines, and he suspected it had been knapped to answer echoes, not only to pierce flesh. [243]He climbed into the highest bone tower, where wind tunneled through sockets and made an organ music that even stone could feel, and he waited until the sky filled with birds. [274]In this dry world birds were rare messengers, and when a flock finally swept over the canyon, their wings wrote a moving script against the sun. [300]He had been taught to read that script through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, because the flock bent around invisible pressure, the same pressure that guided the wandering pulse. [333]Oren placed the arrowhead point-down on the tower's crown and hummed until his body rang in thirds, letting the note travel into bone and return to him with new overtones. [363]Each return carried dust memories, layers of footfalls and lost prayers, and with weathered resolve he sifted them, refusing to chase any sound that was only grief. [390]When the flock split and rejoined above him, he felt a tug in the note, a syncopation that did not belong to wind or birds, and he knew the pulse had come near. [423]Instead of leaping after it, he stayed still, tuning the hum to the flock's shifting angles, appraising again the arrowhead's alignment as if it were a compass needle made of silence. [454]The bone tower amplified his tone until the canyon answered, and the echoes stitched a path in his mind, not forward but inward, showing that navigation was a relationship between places, not a march. [488]He remembered the arrowhead's makers, how they must have stood as he stood, honoring the dead towers and sending their aim by listening, and he let that respect steady his breathing. [519]The wandering pulse slid into his humming like a second voice, and for a moment he saw, without moving, the far mouth of the canyon where a spring still whispered under stone. [551]He held the image gently and sent his own resonance along it, and the pulse answered by returning the route as a sequence of intervals, a map you could sing rather than walk. [584]At dawn the birds thinned into separate strokes and the note faded, but Oren kept the arrowhead and the learned intervals, certain now that he could travel the towers of bone in stillness, guiding others through dusted centuries by sound.
