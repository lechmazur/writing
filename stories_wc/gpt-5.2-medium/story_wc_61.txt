<story>In the Nebula Garden, where violet dust hung like pollen, Lior listened to blossoms drift from starvines and felt each fall as a memory. [24] He was an otherworldly sentimentalist, exiled from the bright furnaces of his people because he wanted to share light without using fire. [46] The Garden offered serenity, yet its calm troubled him, for every petal that settled on the black soil carried the whisper of repeating families, repeating errors. [72] Generational patterns were stitched into the place: starvines coiled as their ancestors had, and even the drifting spores pulsed in cycles that no gardener could break. [98] Lior carried a single calculating machine gear in his pocket, a relic from a ship that had once mapped the galaxy by turning thought into teeth and rotation. [126] He believed the gear could count the Garden's loops and find a gap where a new kind of light might enter, not as flame but as gentle measure. [154] Each evening, across the quiet sigh of falling petals, he set the gear on a stone and pressed his ear to it, waiting for the tick that never came. [183] Without motion the teeth were mute, so he fashioned a small harness of rootfiber, tied it to a gliding moth, and planned a transit through the densest part of the nebula. [214] In that region sight failed, and the Garden's paths folded into one another like generations that mistook familiarity for fate. [234] To navigate, Lior built a wand from hollow reed and used sonar pinging, clicking his tongue into the tube and reading the return notes in his bones. [261] The echoes revealed floating boulders wrapped in vine, and farther off a wall of condensed starlight that approximates infinity, extending beyond every ping as if the Garden had no edge. [291] The moth strained in thin gas, pulling the harness, and the gear began to spin against the stone, carving faint grooves that glimmered without heat. [316] Lior followed those grooves, trusting the simple arithmetic of rotation more than his longing, because longing had led his mother to the furnaces and his father to silence. [344] He had sworn not to repeat them, yet he could feel their pattern in his hands as he tightened knots and counted turns, as though destiny were a machine. [373] A clearing opened where blooms the size of sails floated in slow orbit, and beneath them lay an old observatory made of glassy bark. [397] Inside, a caretaker automaton waited, its face smooth and tender, and it greeted Lior as if he were the grandson of its last visitor. [421] The machine spoke in hushed tones about how the Garden was seeded to teach species what they pass down, and how every traveler arrived carrying an inherited wound. [449] It asked for a token, and Lior offered the calculating machine gear, admitting that he sought a way to give light that would not burn the next generation. [477] The automaton set the gear into its chest, where missing cogs had long left it dim, and with a soft shiver it began to emit a cool radiance like moonlit water. [508] That light spread through the observatory walls into the nebula itself, outlining paths without scorching leaf or skin, and Lior felt his exile loosen. [532] Yet the caretaker warned him that serenity was never free: if he carried this radiance home, his people might replace their furnaces and forget the discipline that kept them from colder darks. [564] Lior listened to the sonar pinging of his own breath against the bark roof, and he recognized the old pattern: change would be blamed on the youngest, praised in the oldest. [595] So he chose a slower transit, returning not to the furnaces but to the outskirts, where children tended night seedlings and still believed light could be learned. [622] He taught them to build reeds for sonar pinging and to listen for the wall that approximates infinity, then to set small gears in shared frames that made radiance only when many hands turned together. [657] Across the quiet sigh of falling petals, the Garden watched their first wheel glow, troubling in its gentleness, because it promised a future that might finally break the loop. [686]</story>
