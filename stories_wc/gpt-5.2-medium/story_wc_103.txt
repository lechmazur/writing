<story>The living bridge garden breathed beneath my boots, its vines braided into arches that flexed over the river like ribs, and every leaf held a tremor of green. [28]I was the hedge maze designer the caretakers hired when the bridge began dreaming in loops, and they wanted paths that could calm it without cutting it. [55]My sketches were not of straight corridors but of curves that folded back on themselves, because I had come to discover the texture of time, not merely to guide feet. [85]In my satchel I carried fading photographs of the garden, images donated by pilgrims, each one paling even as I looked, as if the paper were exhaling its memories. [114]The strangest photo showed the bridge with a maze already grown, and at its center a woman raising her hand to the sky, though no sky existed above the canopy. [144]When I tried to ask who she was, the caretaker Lio only shook, his gaze fixed behind his eyes, retrocognitively trapped in some earlier knowing he could not reach. [173]He pressed into my palm a small, cold shard of metal and light, a halo fragment snapped from an idol that once crowned the bridge's oldest trellis. [200]Hold it over the photos, he whispered, and you may hear what I cannot, because the bridge keeps its history in reflections and punishes those who stare directly. [228]That night the garden hummed and the river below sounded like pages turning, and I set the halo fragment on the table beside my compass and my pruning knife. [257]The fragment threw a ringed shadow that did not match the lamplight, and inside it the fading photographs brightened, then began to move, their scenes wobbling as if underwater. [286]I traced the maze lines in the moving photo and felt them pull at my fingertips, inviting me to build the same pattern on the living bridge, but with a deeper curvature. [318]My training had begun in stone cities, yet here the only stable math was through hyperbolic geometry, where a finite deck could hold an endless drift of paths. [346]As I planted hedge cuttings in that geometry, the bridge responded, thickening its tendrils into angled corridors, and I heard a soft quake in every joint as if it remembered. [376]Lio watched from the railing, swaying like a reed, and sometimes his mouth formed names without sound, as though his mind were stuck reading captions on vanished pictures. [404]When the maze was tall enough to hide my shoulders, I carried the halo fragment to its entrance and held it up, and the ring-shadow opened like an eye. [433]The air inside turned syrupy, filled with the scent of old ink, and the path ahead matched the photograph's path so exactly that I felt I was stepping onto paper. [463]Hedges leaned inward, their leaves arranged like repeating stars, and each turn multiplied corridors until my sense of distance disintegrated, replaced by a gentle vertigo that shook my teeth. [492]At the center I found the woman from the photo, but she was made of silver grains and paper fibers, a figure half printed, half breathing, caught between glance and gaze. [523]She told me she had designed the first maze, seeking the same texture of time, and the bridge had answered by trapping her retrocognitively inside the image of her attempt. [553]The halo fragment warmed in my hand and lit her face from within, showing tiny striations like growth rings, and I understood that time here was not a line but bark. [584]To free her I would have to let the photographs finish fading, not cling to them, and let the maze consume its own map, so that memory could rejoin the living bridge. [616]She placed her grainy hand over mine and guided the fragment in a slow circle, and the hyperbolic angles around us tightened, drawing every corridor toward a single impossible point. [646]I felt the garden quake in reverie, as if it were dreaming itself awake, and outside the maze Lio cried out, his voice suddenly young, then suddenly absent. [674]The photographs in my satchel turned to blank pulp, then to dust, and the woman's body disintegrated into a swarm of bright flecks that sank into the hedge roots. [703]When I stumbled back to the entrance, the maze was smaller, simpler, more humane, and Lio stood clear-eyed, holding a new photograph that showed nothing but the river. [731]I took the empty image as a final lesson, pressed the halo fragment into the soil so it could rust into light, and listened for the rough, tender grain of now. [762]</story>
