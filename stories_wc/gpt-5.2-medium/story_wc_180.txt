<story>After the breach of contract, Mira Lorne climbed through the broken west window of Saint Aster Cathedral. [17] She was a quartz-eye mender, hired once by guild and clergy alike, until the guild voided her license with a neat stamp. [39] The stamp said she had repaired an heirloom eye without the proper prayer, and the contract snapped like dry twigs. [59] Now, with nothing but a forgotten bag slung on her shoulder, she came to retrieve what the breach had left unpaid. [80] Inside, the abandoned cathedral had become a lush orchard spanning the rafters, branches braided through beams, apples glowing where candles once hung. [102] Wind sighed through missing panes and shook down petals onto the pews, and Mira muttered that saints should have swept. [122] Her feisty grumble was endearing even to herself, a habit learned from her mother, who had scolded dust as if it listened. [144] She came for one thing: the daughter's hair ribbon that the canon's child had dropped in her shop the day before the firing. [167] Mira had kept it to return, because she believed small objects carried large lessons, and she wanted to bridge generational wisdom somehow. [189] If she could give the ribbon back, maybe the child would remember that repair is a kind of respect, not mere trade. [211] She followed the central aisle until the orchard's trunk rose from the altar, a pear tree rooted in cracked marble. [231] On its bark someone had carved lines of a vow, each year crossed out as if the promise were meant to fall away. [254] Mira read it aloud, and the phrase stuck in her mind: deciduous vows, promises renewed by shedding. [271] Accidental wisdom always arrived for her like that, uninvited, from graffiti or gossip, then refused to leave. [288] A flutter in the branches made her reach for her quartz mending kit, but her bag offered only crumbs, thread, and a cracked lens. [312] The kit had been confiscated with her license, so she persisted using forgotten bag contents, improvising as her mother once taught. [333] The flutter was not a bird but a small boy clinging to a beam, one eye a dull quartz orb that had slipped loose. [357] He glared down at her as if she were the reason the world wobbled, and he demanded help in a voice too brave. [380] Mira recognized him as the canon's grandson, the contract's true client, who had been hidden behind theology and fees. [399] She told him she had no right to touch his eye anymore, but he spat that vows were for adults and adults broke them first. [424] That stung, because she had been proud of her own strictness, yet the guild's breach proved paperwork could betray care. [444] She asked where his sister was, and he pointed to a choir stall where a girl tied her hair with a strip of torn cloth. [469] The ribbon, Mira realized, was missing from that hair, and the girl's anxious hands kept slipping on the rough substitute. [489] Mira set down her bag, pulled out the thread, and looped it around the cracked lens to make a temporary socket ring. [511] With crumbs of wax scraped from an old candle stump, she seated the quartz eye, then tightened the ring with a sailor's knot. [534] The boy blinked, the world steadied, and his fierce scowl softened into surprise that a discarded bag could keep a promise. [555] Mira walked the repaired child to his sister, and from her pocket she produced the daughter's hair ribbon, blue as river shade. [577] The girl accepted it, then tied it around her brother's wrist instead, saying, "Vows should stay where you can see them." [599] Mira laughed despite herself, because the child had turned her lesson back on her, and accidental wisdom warmed the cold nave. [620] Under the orchard rafters she offered her own deciduous vow to them: she would keep repairing, contract or not, until their generation could teach hers what faith meant. [648]</story>
