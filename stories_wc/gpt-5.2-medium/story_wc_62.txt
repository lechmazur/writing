<story>At dusk the ancient greenhouse behind Saint Lyris cemetery held its breath, panes sweating after the day heat, while Jonas, the thoughtful gravestone carver, listened to distant thunder without fear. [30]
He came there each evening across the butterfly migration, when orange wings drifted over the glass like embers and then vanished toward the river flats. [55]
His hands stayed stained with limestone dust, yet his mind, fiercely meditative, moved slow and deep, as if carving air the way he carved names. [80]
In town they praised his clean lettering, but he had a private question that throbbed in him like calm thunder: what was the shape of collective grief, the kind shared by strangers. [112]
To find it he began to retrace old headstones, not to copy their dates, but to follow the tiny hesitations of earlier hands, the places where chisel marks softened. [141]
He brought a woven ribbon roll from his mother's sewing basket, strips dyed in mourning colors, and tied one around each stone he studied so the dead would not feel handled. [172]
Inside the greenhouse, where vines had long ago swallowed the benches, he laid the ribbon roll on a potting table and listened to rain begin to drum on the roof. [202]
The sound was thundering calm, steady enough to think by, and it reminded him of family dinners when storms pushed everyone close to the lamp. [227]
They had a custom of trading favorite poems at dinner, each person reciting a line that matched the day, and even his taciturn father would speak when the soup arrived. [257]
After his father died the poems became heavier, and Jonas started writing the lines on scraps of ribbon, believing grief might be measured in meter and breath. [284]
That belief drew him to the greenhouse, because it was the only place in the cemetery where the living plants still reached, and where echoes felt willing to answer. [313]
On the first night of migration he saw a pale figure near the orchids, not terrifying but precise, as if cut from moonlight, and it greeted him with his father's voice. [344]
Jonas did not run; he centered his breathing, fiercely meditative, and the figure smiled in approval, offering spectral mentorship the way a master mason offers a better tool. [372]
It asked to see what he had been retracing, and when he unrolled the ribbons with their poem lines, the air tightened, full of many unsaid verses. [399]
The spirit taught him to read the cemetery like a field, to notice which stones leaned together and which stood alone, and to listen for the communal hush between them. [429]
For each cluster it chose a poem from Jonas's family dinners, guiding his hand to tie the matching ribbon around several markers at once so separate losses would braid. [458]
When the butterflies arrived in thicker waves, they settled briefly on the ribbons, and their weight made the fabric tremble, like the crowd at a funeral shifting on pews. [487]
Jonas began carving a new memorial tablet, not for one name but for a season, and he let the spirit guide his chisel into a pattern of interlocking arcs. [516]
He took rubbings from old stones and compared them in the greenhouse, retracing the strongest grooves, until he saw that every family had repeated the same three pauses. [544]
The pauses were where a loved one had been remembered not as a body but as a habit, and the spirit pressed his wrist there, insisting, "This is where grief joins." [575]
On the last evening, when the migration thinned and the thunder rolled far off like a closing door, Jonas hosted his siblings in the greenhouse for dinner from packed tins. [605]
They lit candles in jars, traded favorite poems as they always had, and between stanzas Jonas laid the woven ribbon roll in the center so each could choose a color. [635]
When everyone tied their chosen ribbon to the unfinished tablet, the spectral mentor stood behind Jonas and seemed to breathe through them all, turning private mourning into one chord. [664]
At dawn he set the finished stone at the cemetery gate, the arcs now a map of shared pauses, and he felt the thundering calm of understanding as butterflies lifted and the spirit let go. [699]</story>
