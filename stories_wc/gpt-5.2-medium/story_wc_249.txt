<story>At the hush of the universe inhaling, the institute dimmed its lights and opened the sound wave garden, a courtyard of reeds and resonant stone where every step returned as music. [31]I was their experimental treatment guinea pig, signed in ink and saline, wired with silver electrodes that recorded not only pulses but the stray images that rose behind my eyes. [61]Dr Sato said the drug would let memories be stored like harmonics, entangled across two minds, so that what I forgot she could still hear, and what she mourned might find a new rhythm in me. [97]I nodded, quietly rebellious, because my consent was a thin mask over a plan: to breathe life into a shared dream my brother and I had sketched before the accident erased him from everyone but me. [133]They led me through glass doors into the garden, and I began drumming on everything, fingertips tapping bamboo rails, knuckles striking the basalt bench, even my own collarbone, hunting the frequency that made my chest loosen. [169]In the center waited the auric lagoon under starlight, a shallow pool infused with conductive gold algae that glowed when sound touched it, and I could not decide if it was beautiful or a grave. [204]Sato motioned for me to perch on the narrow rim, feet dangling above the liquid, and she perched opposite me, our mirrors on the water broken by ripples of light. [234]She counted down and pushed the plunger, and cold fire spread through my veins as the lagoon answered, brightening in rings, while the garden amplified our breathing until it sounded like waves learning to speak. [269]Memories arrived not as scenes but as chords, and in the same instant I tasted her childhood winter and she tasted mine, our minds snagging and braiding, entangled memories tightening like a knot pulled from both ends. [306]In her winter I heard drums in a funeral hall, a ritual for a daughter lost to fever, and my hands, without permission, kept tapping the rim of the lagoon to match the beat she had buried. [343]Sato flinched, and I realized my rebellion had become audible to her; she whispered that the treatment was not meant for resurrection, only for empathy, but I struck the stone again and showed her my brother. [379]He appeared in the lagoon as a constellation of gestures, sitting on our old roof at midnight, drumming on a tin gutter to call meteors, and in my throat was the ache of all the words I never said. [418]Because our memories were now tied, Sato also felt the moment the ambulance doors closed, and her sorrow turned auroral, a curtain of color over a black sky, trembling between science and prayer. [451]She admitted she had built the garden and the lagoon to trap sound, to give her dead child somewhere to echo, and the experiment had been her own attempt to breathe life into a shared dream she could not release. [491]Together we let the drug carry us deeper, using taps and hums to steer, until the lagoon shimmered with two lost faces, my brother and her daughter, not returned in flesh but alive in the pattern of our joined recall. [531]The institute alarms began to whine, sensors warning of neural overload, yet we stayed perched on the rim, and I drummed softly, choosing not to flee but to hold the dream steady long enough for both children to speak through us. [572]In the shared trance their voices were only vibrations, but the sound wave garden translated them into movements of light across the reeds, and we understood: they did not ask for bodies, only for witnesses who would remember them together. [612]Sato cut the feed before our brains burned, and when the drug fell away the lagoon dimmed to simple water, leaving us shaking and wet eyed, the auroral sorrow lingering like afterimage on the back of my eyelids. [650]The next day I expected confinement, but she handed me the data and her private recordings, and I walked out under a pale dawn, still quietly rebellious, carrying proof that memory could be shared without being owned. [687]When night returned, I came back to the garden alone and drummed on the gate until it opened, then perched beside the lagoon under starlight and breathed, not for an experiment now, but to keep the shared dream alive in the only way we had learned, together in mind.
