<story>After the last human dream was dreamt, the air lost its soft clutter, and silence settled like bronze dust over the reclaimed silo library at the edge of the old grain fields. [32]  
In that hush moved Lysa Quell, an odd historian who wore eartrumpets of tin and walked slowly, because she was sensitively perceptive and felt vibrations as if they were sentences. [62]  
Her work was not to rebuild nations or store seeds, but to collect the stories walls have heard, before weather and moss and time erased the last witnesses. [90]  
The silo had been cut open and refitted with shelves, and its concrete skin still held the scent of smoke from the night the dreamers went quiet. [117]  
She called that night the displaced axis, when sleep stopped turning the world in place and the angle of everything shifted, so that memories slid and histories no longer lined up with their own footprints. [152]  
To map the shift, Lysa did what she always did: she listened to rooms until they spoke, then she probed for material proof in the debris people had left behind. [182]  
That evening a draft sighed up the central stair, and she followed it to the old librarian's hearth that had been bricked into the base of the silo like a sealed mouth. [214]  
She chipped away the mortar with a bone-handled chisel, and inside the fireplace she found a nest of half-burned diaries, their edges curled black, their pages smelling of cedar and panic. [245]  
The first diary belonged to a boy who wrote about dragons he saw in woven cloth at the county museum, and tucked between the diary covers was a fragment of a medieval tapestry showing dragons, singed but bright as ember scales. [286]  
When Lysa laid the fragment on a reading table, her fingertips tingled, and she felt the wall behind her answer with a faint hum, as if the concrete remembered the loom's rhythm. [318]  
She turned pages carefully, probing through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace, and the charred lines began to align with the dragons' threads, each entry a coordinate in a pattern the writers never knew they were making. [355]  
A woman described a dream of the grain elevator tilting like a compass needle, and another writer, the librarian, confessed that he had hidden the tapestry fragment in the hearth because it pointed to the new true north. [393]  
In their last nights of sleep they had sensed the displaced axis coming, not as catastrophe but as a quiet correction, and their dreams tried to stitch an old map onto a world that was slipping its bearings. [431]  
Lysa held the dragon cloth up to the silo window slit, and the setting sun poured through the warp, casting scaled shadows that crawled across the shelves toward the hearth like searching animals. [464]  
She understood then that the walls had heard more than voices; they had heard direction itself change, the way a bell hears a cracked note, and the library had been built to keep that knowledge from blowing away. [502]  
The diaries ended with the same line repeated in different hands, a plea to whoever came after: Set the axis back, or at least remember where it went. [530]  
But Lysa, listening in her bronze quiet, realized no one could set it back because the old axis had depended on dreaming minds to anchor it, and those minds were gone like extinguished lanterns. [564]  
So she did the only repair left to her kind: she cataloged the hums in the concrete, the soot in the hearth, the dragon shadows on the shelves, and the diary sentences that still warmed the air when read aloud. [604]  
When night finally wrapped the silo, she pinned the tapestry fragment beside the library's door as a signpost, and every time the wind pressed the metal skin she heard, in the walls, the stories turning toward their new north. [643]
