<story>During the blackout, the sunken city felt like a held breath under the bay. [14]No lamps burned in the drowned streets, and only my headlamp made a pale tunnel through silted water. [32]I came for the forgotten library inside the sunken city, a domed ruin sealed behind corroded bronze doors. [50]I am Maren, a logical page indexer by trade, trained to make sense where records decay. [66]When power failed across the new shoreline, the Archive Guild sent scavengers, but I asked to go alone. [84]Alone, I could hear patterns, and my mind stayed tranquilly perceptive even as currents tugged my suit. [101]The blackout was not just darkness; it was a silence that had been stolen from us for years. [119]In it, I sensed a chance for reclaimed stillness, the kind that lets truth rise without noise. [136]I pushed through the doors and floated into an atrium of collapsed shelves and drifting paper. [152]My mission was simple: to trace honest origins of the city maps that now guided our rebuilding. [169]The Guild suspected the maps were forged to favor certain families, and I needed proof, not rumor. [186]In a reading room sunk waist deep in sediment, I found the old card catalog, swollen but intact. [204]Each drawer was numbered, yet the order made no sense, as if someone had panicked and rearranged history. [222]I readjusted my gloves, steadied my breathing, and began indexing the index. [234]The first cards pointed to ledgers that did not exist on the shelves, while blank cards bore faint impressions. [253]I used an alternative hypothesis: instead of missing books, the catalog itself had been repurposed as a code. [271]Following the code, I swam to a locked cabinet where a single object waited in velvet rot. [288]It was an antique ink stamp, brass handled, its face carved with the lighthouse that once stood above this bay. [308]I knew that seal from treaties, and my pulse tightened with dappled resolve. [321]The stamp meant official provenance, but why hide it in a ruined library during the blackout? [337]On a desk nearby, a folio lay wrapped in oiled cloth, and its title page was rubbed clean. [355]I pressed the stamp onto a corner of the damp paper, not to mark it mine, but to wake its memory. [376]Ink bled dark, and under the lighthouse emblem, letters surfaced in the fibers as if the page exhaled. [394]The folio was a registry of coastal parcels, and the erased title had been replaced by our modern map name. [414]Someone had copied it, stripped the original credits, then used the lighthouse seal to authenticate the forgery. [431]My headlamp flickered, and the library seemed to listen, as if the city itself wished to be corrected. [449]I sat on a toppled globe and let the darkness settle, reclaiming stillness again so my thoughts would not chase fear. [470]In that calm, I saw the next step: the blank catalog cards were not blanks, but receipts for the stolen registry. [491]They held impressions of writing made with pressure, and I could read them by angling my lamp across their grooves. [511]The names matched members of the Guild council, including the voice that had argued loudest for rebuilding rights. [529]I photographed every card, then readjusted the cabinet back into place, leaving the stamp where it belonged. [546]If the council learned I had found it, they would drown the evidence more thoroughly than the sea ever had. [566]So I carried only the images and the restored title, a quiet weight that steadied me on the long swim out. [587]Above, the blackout still blanketed the shore, yet I felt a new lantern inside, lit by honest origins. [605]</story>
