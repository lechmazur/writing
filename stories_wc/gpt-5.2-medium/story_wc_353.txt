<story>After the hedgehog uncurls from its leaf-hut at the edge of the siskin alder grove, Lysa walks the wet path with her tools wrapped in cloth, because even footsteps feel too loud in a world that has forgotten how to answer. [41]  
She is a tree-song sculptor, symphonically minded since childhood, yet she has never heard an orchestra, only the hush that followed the Great Muffle, when metal rang dull and throats closed, leaving her with the stubborn need to create music in a silent world. [85]  
The grove offers materials - alder that bends without breaking, siskins that flicker like moving rests on a staff - but no sound comes back, so she has learned to listen with her hands, to feel how each trunk carries strain the way a body carries grief. [132]  
Today she returns to the long-forgotten sculpture half-buried in moss, an old civic monument whose carved figures have weathered into blank faces, and whose silence has become a teacher she can touch. [164]  
She sets a porcelain insulator on the stone base like an offering, the white bell once meant to keep lightning from burning a telegraph wire, and she wonders what messages the past tried to send before the air itself turned mute. [205]  
Her method is patient: by analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture, she traces hairline maps where frost and root-pressure have argued for decades, and she reads them as intervals, the way a conductor reads a score from the smallest marks. [246]  
The widest crack arcs toward the grove, and she decides it is a low opening note, so she lashes thin copper wire between two alders, threads the porcelain insulator as a calm bridge, and tightens until the wire quivers under her fingers like a held breath. [292]  
To strum it would be easy, but to make it mean something she must practice empathy in motion, walking the wire's length, palms hovering, feeling where the tension changes as sap rises, where a bird lands, where her own pulse trembles into the metal. [336]  
When she finally plucks, the wire does not speak to the air, yet it speaks to her bones, and she answers by carving a small alder block, shaping its cavity to match the crack-patterns she studied, so the vibration has a place to gather. [380]  
She presses the block against the insulator, and the porcelain, cool and dense, carries the tremor into the stone monument and out through the roots, until the grove itself seems to sway in a slow, inaudible chord that even the hedgehog pauses to feel. [424]  
In that shared stillness she understands the cracks were never damage alone, but records of pressure endured, and her symphonically minded heart arranges them into a sequence of strains and releases, each one a promise that nobody is unheard if someone keeps moving toward them. [469]  
By twilight she has strung three more wires, each tuned to a different scar on the sculpture, and though the grove remains intensely quiet, the vibrations travel hand to hand as siskins hop along the lines and Lysa walks among them, conducting without sound, smiling because the world is answering through touch. [521]  
She remembers how people in the nearby settlement avoid looking at one another, afraid their own grief will echo back, so she plans to carry this portable silence-music along the river path, letting neighbors rest their fingertips on the porcelain bridge and learn, for a moment, the weight of another life. [572]  
Before she leaves, she lays her ear to the monument anyway, not expecting sound, only the faintest sensation of moving warmth, and she thanks the forgotten sculptor who once believed stone could speak, promising to keep reading the cracks until every place of strain has its note. [619]  
When the hedgehog curls again under the alder roots, she packs her chisels but not the insulator, leaving it hanging on the wire like a pale moon, so the grove can keep humming through touch while she walks on, a quiet maker of meetings between bodies that cannot yet sing. [669]
