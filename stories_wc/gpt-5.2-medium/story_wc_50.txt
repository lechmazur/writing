Ivo the locksmith had always been reflective, not because he loved mirrors but because he listened to what metal remembered when it cooled. [23]
When the wounded season settled over the valley, frost came late and left early, and the town stopped asking him to cut new keys and started asking him to fix time. [54]
A courier brought a broken timer mechanism from the high quarry, its brass ribs bent and its escapement missing, and with it a note that said the marble cavern below the quarry was swallowing sounds. [89]
In that cavern, the elders claimed, there was a harvest of echoes: every shouted warning, every lullaby, every confession bounced off the walls and ripened into something you could gather, if you arrived before it spoiled. [125]
Ivo went because he wanted, as he wrote in the margin of his repair ledger, to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later, when grief or plainness made him doubt he had ever heard anything miraculous. [163]
He was peripherally focused, the kind of man who noticed the scratch beside a keyhole more than the door, and on the climb to the quarry his eyes kept sliding to the edges where snowmelt traced quick silver lines. [202]
At the cavern mouth, a slab of veined marble reflected his lantern in warped bands, and he began his work before he even stepped inside, turning the broken timer mechanism in his hands to imagine what rhythm it had once kept. [243]
The interior opened into a cathedral of stone, polished by old waters, and every footfall returned twice, first as a sharp tap and then as a softer copy that seemed to drift along the walls looking for a listener. [282]
He set his bench against a pillar and began to reverse-engineer the problem by reading surfaces, but here the surfaces were not only metal; they were sound, light, and the uneasy gap between them. [316]
To replace the missing escapement, he needed a pulse, and the cavern offered pulses in reflections, so he spent days studying reflection angles at different times, marking on marble where lanternlight and sunrise struck and how each strike changed the echo's pitch. [358]
Across the lull of a wounded season, the entrance thawed and froze, his breath became mist then disappeared, and he learned that certain hours made the marble act like a lens, throwing voices to one corner where they lingered as if trapped. [400]
He began to recognize the gathered sounds as layers, and with his peripheral attention he could separate them: the quarryman's cough at dusk, the child's laugh from a week before, the elder's prayer that had cracked on the word forgive. [440]
When he fitted a temporary gear cut from a copper coin into the timer, the device ticked faintly, and the echoes near his bench started to align with the ticks, as if the mechanism were combing the air for moments worth saving. [482]
But each night a deep tremor traveled through the cavern, cracking fresh lines in the marble, and he understood the swallowing was not hunger but overflow, a place too full of unclaimed sound pressing to escape. [518]
He rebuilt the escapement from spare springs and a sliver of marble shaved to the exact angle he had measured at dawn, then anchored the timer to a reflective seam so that every tick opened a narrow window for an echo to settle inside the gears. [564]
On the last day before the pass closed again, he carried the finished device out, hearing behind him the cavern exhale in relief, and in his pack the timer held a gentle chorus that he could release later, when reason needed a hidden cellar door to wonder. [611]
