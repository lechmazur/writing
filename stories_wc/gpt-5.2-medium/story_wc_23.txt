<story>After the hydraulics fail, the starlit signal station above the salt flats goes still, its dish frozen toward a dead satellite and its doors jammed half open like a mouth that forgot how to ask for water. [37]I stay anyway, because I am a patchwork navigator, sewn together from old charts, borrowed languages, and the scars of every route I have survived. [62]The station used to guide the outward caravans, families streaming to the coast when the inland wells turned brackish, but now the tide has eaten the ports and the people are coming back in reverse migration, empty handed and fierce. [102]They arrive under constellations no longer trusted, asking me to navigate the geography of loss, the places where houses were, where names belonged, where a mother last waved from a platform that has since collapsed. [137]With the hydraulics dead I cannot raise the roof lens, and the old mechanical map table will not tilt, so I begin to build a new instrument on the floor from scrap wire, cracked glass, and the one relic I kept from my father, a patina bronze censer foot. [186]He had found it in a drowned temple, and he swore it held a steadier truth than any compass, but when I set it beside my pencil marks it does something impossible, its warmth and weight fluctuate with moon phases, as if the metal remembers tides. [232]On the first night after the failure, when the moon is a thin hook, my phone rings at midnight, and a voice I do not recognize gives me three numbers and the word return. [266]The next night the moon fattens, and another cryptic phone call at midnight delivers a riddle about a river that runs backward, and I start plotting the numbers against star positions, because no one would bother calling unless they needed a path. [308]By the third call I understand that the voice is not an enemy but a relay, someone in the returning columns using broken towers to bounce messages, warning me that the old routes are being swallowed by sinkholes where the coast drained inland. [351]Each midnight instruction matches the censer foot, which nudges my sketches by a hair when the moon climbs, pulling my lines away from memory and toward the altered ground, and I build the device into a crude armillary, the bronze foot as its anchor. [395]When the migrants reach the station, their lanterns look like a second sky, and I show them how the armillary points not north but home, shifting nightly with the lunar pull so that the safest passage keeps changing, like grief. [435]A woman named Sera tells me she left her son on the coast during the first exodus, and now she walks the reverse migration because she heard he might have turned back too, and she needs my map more than my comfort. [477]I give her the raw solace I can, admitting I do not know whether the midnight caller is saving us or counting us, but I also tell her that loss has a terrain, and if we read it carefully we can cross it without falling in. [523]Under a full moon the censer foot grows heavy as a stone, and my armillary swings hard toward the ruins of the old aqueducts, so we set out after dark, following the station stars and the caller's last numbers, moving between collapsed canals that once carried life by force of hydraulics. [574]At the aqueduct we find a camp of returners and, beside their cook fires, a boy repairing a radio with the same patient hands my father had, and when he looks up Sera makes a sound that is half prayer, half wound opening. [617]The boy says the midnight calls were his, sent through whatever towers still breathed, because he remembered the signal station navigator who once guided people away and he wanted someone to guide them back, and as dawn thins the stars I know what I have built is not a machine but a promise.
