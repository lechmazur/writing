Galen, a zen-minded potter, walked the scorched wasteland with clay dust still under his nails, because he wanted to understand why some places resist change. [25]
Ahead, an abandoned beekeeping oasis crouched around a brackish spring, its broken hives stacked like little kilns, and its last palms burned black at the tips. [51]
He arrived at dusk, as chimney smoke flattens against a low sky from some distant refinery, turning the horizon into a pressed-gray lid. [74]
In the shade of a collapsed shed he found a lantern with faded lantern glass, the kind that once made honey-gold circles for night work, now clouded with scratches and soot. [105]
When he lifted it, the glass gave a soft thrum, not from fuel but from memory, as if the oasis had kept time inside it. [130]
Galen held the lantern the way he held unfired bowls, with sharp gentleness, and the thrum steadied, answering his touch like a creature phototropic to kindness. [156]
The first fracture showed itself in the sand: footprints that began, ended, then began again beside themselves, as though two afternoons had been laid over one another. [183]
He had seen minor slips in glaze cooling too fast, but this was larger, a world with cracked seams, and the lantern's glass pulsed whenever he looked at the odd overlaps. [214]
By following sun patterns, he tested the place, marking where shadows should fall, then watching them disagree, drifting sideways as if a different sun insisted on its own path. [243]
Each time the shadows split, the lantern thrum rose to a warning, and in the split light he glimpsed the oasis in other states, lush with bees one moment, empty the next. [275]
Near the spring he met a scavenger girl named Sera, whose canteen was dry, and in one timeline her lips were cracked, while in another she hummed as if she had just drunk. [308]
Galen offered her water from his own jug, and the lantern glass brightened toward her hands, turning its dullness into a clear, warm lens that made the fractured air easier to read. [340]
Sera watched the glow and said the oasis always stayed put, even when dunes marched and wars shifted borders, and she hated it for refusing to die like everything else. [370]
He told her he did not come to break it, only to understand, and she agreed to guide him through the apiary ruins if he promised not to leave her in the wrong hour. [404]
Together they walked between hive boxes that had fused in heat, and under their lids wax combs remained, preserved like pottery shards, holding the scent of a season that would not pass. [436]
At the center stood an old brick chimney from the honey cookhouse, and as the distant smoke flattened again overhead, the bricks began to shimmer, showing the same chimney built, burned, rebuilt. [468]
The lantern thrum matched the shimmer, and Galen realized the oasis resisted change by storing every version of itself, stacking timelines the way a potter stacks bowls in a kiln to share heat. [501]
If one version dried out, another still held water; if one was raided, another still buzzed, and the fractures kept the spring from ever belonging to a single, mortal present. [531]
Sera asked why kindness mattered to the lantern, and Galen said softness is a kind of alignment, the hand that does not grab lets clay center, and time, too, can be centered. [563]
He set the lantern in the chimney's mouth, then, by following sun patterns traced on the bricks by long-gone beekeepers, he rotated it until the thrum became a single note. [593]
The overlaps narrowed; Sera's two faces fused into one tired smile, and the oasis chose a timeline not because it was strongest, but because it was the one they had met with care. [626]
When the chimney smoke finally lifted and rose like it meant to, the spring ran clearer, the preserved combs crumbled into honest dust, and Galen understood that resistance can be a refuge until someone arrives gently enough to let it move. [667]
