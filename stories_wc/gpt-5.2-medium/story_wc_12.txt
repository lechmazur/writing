At the Dimensional Anchor, a ring of basalt bolted to air, Father Selo served as loop pedal priest, layering prayers into soft circuits that kept the rift from yawning wider. [30]
His chapel had no banners; he decorates with silence, letting pauses hang like lanterns so the congregation can hear what their own minds smuggle in. [55]
Tonight the air felt like a cloth over a bell, and through that muffled clarity he sensed the possession in Mara, the apprentice cartographer, tightening its last knot behind her eyes. [86]
Before the possession completes, he must plumb the thing that invited it, not with knives or exorcist fire but through rhetorical devices, the only tools that could reach assumptions without bruising the body that held them. [122]
In his satchel lay an artist's palette with one color, a single well of ash blue, because in this place color was a promise, and one promise was all the Anchor could tolerate without slipping into someone else's world. [161]
Mara sat on the basalt rim, hands folded, still as a drawn map, yet Selo noticed an unraveled stillness in her posture, as if her quiet had been picked apart thread by thread and rewoven by a patient stranger. [200]
He knelt beside her and began with anaphora, repeating, You drew the line, you chose the north, you named the blank, until her breath matched his looped cadence and the parasite, accustomed to single straight commands, hesitated at the echoing options. [241]
Then he shifted to a question, a clean chiasmus: Do you map what you fear, or fear what you map, and he watched Mara's eyelids flicker as the hidden assumption surfaced, that the unknown existed to be conquered. [279]
The possessing voice, thin as graphite, tried to take that assumption and sharpen it into obedience, but Selo pulled the palette out and set the lone blue on Mara's palm like a coin, saying, If conquest is your only color, what do you paint when the world refuses to surrender. [329]
Silence answered first, the kind he used as ornament, and in that decorated gap Mara remembered the first map she ever traced, not to claim land but to find her lost brother, and the memory loosened the parasite's grip like water loosening salt. [372]
Father Selo fed that memory into the loop pedal, not as melody but as metonymy, letting the Anchor hear brother as shelter, shelter as mercy, mercy as boundary, so the rift itself reinforced the idea that limits could protect instead of imprison. [414]
The possessing thing fought, swelling toward completion, and the basalt ring trembled as if it might unbolt from air, yet Selo kept his voice low and precise, offering an ironic litany: If you are so strong, why must you steal a girl's eyes to look through. [460]
That irony forced a choice, and when the parasite lunged for pride, Mara used the blue well to draw a single circle on the stone, an anchor within the Anchor, declaring with her own mouth that the unknown was not an enemy but a neighbor with undisclosed names. [508]
The circle held because it was modest, one color, one boundary, and the possessing voice found no unspoken conquest to hook into; it unraveled into a cold breeze that slipped back through the rift, leaving Mara shivering but wholly present. [548]
Selo did not celebrate; he simply lifted his hands and let the loop fade, ending on a pause long enough to teach, and he told Mara that exorcism was less a battle than illumination, the work of showing what we assume about power, about maps, about ourselves. [595]
Together they remained at the Dimensional Anchor until dawn, tending the rift with muffled hymns and deliberate quiet, alert for the next hidden assumption. [619]
