<story>After the drawbridge rises, the river hushes, and the city turns its face from the water. [16] That is when Lira Voss walks the firm shore, a surveyor hired to measure what no one wants measured. [35] By day she is all rule and plumb line, but at night she is stoically sensitive to every creak beneath her boots. [57] The council says the old riverside pavilion sank in the flood years ago, yet its roof still presses against the dark current. [79] Lira has asked for this assignment, not for pay, but to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams. [96] Her mother once danced in that pavilion, then vanished, leaving a gap that seemed braided through every later memory. [115] Lira calls the feeling interlaced absence, because the missing is threaded with what remains and cannot be pulled free. [134] She carries an antique traveling inkwell in her satchel, brass worn smooth, the only thing her mother left behind. [153] Inside it, ink has survived like a secret ember, and Lira uses it for notes that will not wash away. [173] Tonight the gatehouse lanterns dim, and the river patrol rows off as soon as the chain clanks and the bridge is up. [195] Lira waits until their oars fade, then slips down the stone steps, where water laps at carved lions. [213] A small skiff is tied there for inspectors, and she pushes it out, aiming for the drowned pavilion posts. [232] Mist swallows the arches, but she knows the layout from old plans, and from stories told in half sentences. [251] Her oar strikes something hard, and a buoyant beam rises, as if the pavilion itself wants to speak. [269] She wrests the beam aside, muscles shaking, and threads the skiff through the opening into the submerged pavilion. [287] Below the surface, moonlight filters down in pale ladders, igniting a hushed blaze across silted tiles. [303] The air under the broken roof is trapped and stale, and her lantern flame flutters as if afraid. [321] Pillars lean like tired dancers, and curtains of weed hang where velvet once did. [335] She measures each crack, each slumped footing, and marks them with chalk that dissolves almost before she finishes. [353] Repairs have begun on the shore side, and new stones wait in stacks, but no one dares set them in the water. [375] Lira does, because she believes foundations can store messages the way riverbed clay stores footprints. [390] With the inkwell open, she writes on thin vellum, then seals the strip in wax scraped from her lantern. [409] Her method is simple: placing notes in foundation repairs, tucking each sealed strip between stone and mortar. [426] Some notes are measurements, some are questions, and some are confessions she cannot speak aboveground. [441] She sets the first stone herself, pressing it into place while the river presses back, and she feels time resisting her hands. [463] In the quiet between breaths, she imagines her mother pausing mid dance, like a figure caught between notes of music. [483] The pavilion is full of such pauses, absence interlaced with objects that still insist on their shapes. [500] A silver mask lies in mud, and when she lifts it, it holds a pocket of air that releases with a sigh. [522] She sees her own reflection there, lantern trembling, and she understands why she came: to map what vanished without dismissing it. [543] A scrape echoes, and she turns to find another skiff nosing in, piloted by Councilor Beran with a hook in hand. [564] He says the survey is complete and demands the inkwell, claiming the relic belongs in the archives, not in a private hunt. [586] Lira holds it tight, her sensitivity locked behind a calm face, and she wrests his hook away before it can snag her satchel. [609] Beran lunges, but she pivots and shoves his skiff into a pillar, and the impact sends silt boiling up like smoke. [630] In that sudden cloud, the hushed blaze of her lantern becomes a sun in fog, and Beran hesitates, blinded. [649] She rows deeper into the pavilion and wedges a final note into a cracked footing, one that reads, "I am still listening." [671] When she surfaces on the far side, the city is only silhouettes, and the raised drawbridge keeps Beran from following. [691] She returns to the firm shore with wet sleeves and the inkwell warm against her ribs, as if the ember ink approves. [713] Tomorrow, masons will set stones where she marked them, and her hidden words will bind the pavilion back to memory. [733] Lira knows she cannot recover her mother, but she can chart the spaces left behind, and in that work her dream stays alive. [756]</story>
