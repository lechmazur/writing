<story>The valley lay under a shawl of mist, and above it a floating rock tea house drifted like a patient lantern. [21]I climbed the rope stair with my new heart thudding politely, two months after receiving the donor heart that saved my dyes and my life. [46]In the town below they called me Maru the watchful dye master, because I noticed every stain and every lie. [66]Yet the heart inside me felt quietly explosive, as if it might bloom into a different person without warning. [85]The healer warned me to live with iridescent caution, to let light touch me but not to chase it until my sutures became honest scar. [110]But I had come to the tea house precisely to chase light, to learn why some people magnetize stories while others pass through days unmentioned. [135]A traveling bard once said my stitches made me a plot hook, and I hated how true it felt. [154]My donor, a woman named Sairi, had died on the salt road, and her name drew tales the way wet cloth draws indigo. [177]I owned the last thing she carried: a blue morpho wing pressed flat in paper, shimmering even in shadow. [196]The tea house keeper, Old Eno, served oolong and listened as the rock slowly rotated, keeping its floor level against the wind. [218]He pointed to the ceiling where thin brass wires held prisms, and he asked what color my heart wanted. [237]I told him I could dye any thread, but I could not dye a story, and that was why I was here. [259]Eno said stories stick to those who illuminate the paths others ignore, and the only way to see such paths is by tracking sun trails. [284]He slid a lacquer tray toward me, and on it lay a map painted with nothing but pale lines, invisible until the prisms caught dawn. [309]Sairi had made this, he said, because she believed the sun was a storyteller that always repeats itself, if you learn its handwriting. [332]My fingers trembled over the map, and the morpho wing in my pocket answered with a cold flash, like a warning. [353]I asked Eno what Sairi wanted from me, and he replied that she wanted her heart to finish a journey. [373]At midday we stepped onto the outer deck, where the mist thinned and the valley opened in soft layers of pine and river. [396]Eno gave me a small mirror and told me to move it until it caught a moving ribbon of sunlight that slid along the mist. [421]When the ribbon touched the map, hidden ink flared up, and a route of bright dots appeared, hopping from cliff to cliff. [443]The dots matched places where travelers had vanished into legend, and I felt my borrowed pulse quicken, eager and afraid. [463]I followed the sun trail dot by dot over three mornings, using the mirror to throw light onto stone faces until each dot answered with a glint. [490]Each glint revealed a short line of Sairi's script, and each line described not treasure but someone she had helped: a lost child, a struck miner, a weeping bride. [519]I began to understand that stories magnetize toward the hands that make room for other lives, not toward the loudest voice. [540]Still, my own hands were trained to fix color, to control bleed, to keep beauty from ruining cloth, and that habit resisted her lesson. [564]On the fourth day the final dot led back to the floating rock tea house, to the underside where ropes and tea crates hung over emptiness. [590]There, wedged in a crack, was a small jar of dye so blue it seemed to drink the air, sealed with a moth-wing stopper. [614]Eno said Sairi called it Caution, because it looked like joy but turned poisonous if you hoarded it for yourself. [634]I opened the paper with the blue morpho wing and pressed its scales against the jar's mouth, and the dye leapt up in sparks, quietly explosive in my palms. [663]The sparks did not burn; they illuminated the mist below, painting brief images of people Sairi had touched, each one lit along the same sun trail. [689]My new heart hammered against my ribs as if it recognized them all, and I realized the donor had not given me a plot, but a practice. [716]In the tea house lanternlight, with valley-mist wonder rising through the floorboards, I vowed to dye cloth like Sairi lived: with iridescent caution, so that the stories that find me will be safe to hold and safe to pass on.
