The first time Lissa Vane swam down to the sunken orchard greenhouse, she tasted rust and old apples in the water and felt her own habits crack like thin ice. [30]
She was a hands-on folklorist, the sort who pressed leaves into notebooks and listened for lullabies in engine noise, and her chronically curious mind had brought her back to this place decades later. [63]
Above the glass dome, the bay held a graveyard of shipwrecks that formed a ring like a broken crown, their ribs visible at low tide, their names half-sanded, each one a story she had cataloged when she still remembered why she started. [105]
Now she came for a different archive: memories stolen from her in a single night of fever when she was nineteen, leaving her with neat field notes but no first pages. [136]
The old villagers said the thief was the Ring Court, and that they took what you loved most if you stepped across a fairy ring mushroom without asking. [164]
Lissa had laughed then, but she still kept the habit of counting her steps at thresholds, and it was only when that habit broke, when she forgot to count on the night of the fever, that the blankness began. [203]
She had spent the decades since detecting folklore in everything except herself, until a sailor in a rehab ward told her that the greenhouse under the wreck-ring still bloomed, and that its ceiling showed broken constellations you could study like a map. [245]
So she learned to dive, traded lecture halls for wetsuit seams, and descended with a lantern to touch the silted branches of trees that once bore pears, each touch an attempt to recover stolen memories by feeling the world remember her back. [287]
Inside the dome, where algae filmed the panes, a perfect circle of pale mushrooms clung to a raised bed that had not drowned, and at its edge lay her own notebook from youth, swollen but legible, open to a page that should have been in her head. [334]
The ink described a skywatching game the villagers played: find the constellations, then find where they are missing, because the Court snips stars out to stitch doorways, and the gaps point down to whatever has been taken. [371]
Lissa tilted her lantern upward and saw the greenhouse roof painted long ago with orchard myths, but time and salt had fractured the zodiac into jagged shards, and by studying those broken constellations she could detect a pattern, a spiral that ended exactly at the mushroom ring. [418]
Her hands, steady from years of turning artifacts over under bright museum lights, now hovered in dark water, and she realized the ring was not a warning but a latch, grown up around the place where her nineteen-year-old self had stepped unasked. [460]
She broke her last habit by not counting, by reaching in, plucking a single fairy ring mushroom, and pressing its cool cap to her tongue the way her grandmother once made her taste rain, and the water around her sharpened into crisp nostalgia, apple-sweet and iron-clean. [506]
Decades of blankness folded back as if someone returned a stolen quilt: she remembered the fever, the boy on the pier, the promise to leave the village and come back kinder, and she saw, beyond the glass, the shipwrecks as guardians instead of graves, holding the Court inside its own ring while she swam upward with her first pages restored. [566]
At the surface she wrote the missing prologue from memory, not as a scholar dissecting a tale, but as a woman keeping faith with her younger voice, and she mailed it to every archive she once served. [603]
When habits break, she learned, they do not only make room for thieves; they also make room for return, and each year after, she dove again to tend the drowned orchard and watch the broken constellations slowly be repainted by her own hand. [646]
