<story>When Tomas asked, "Did you remove the last layer, Mara?", she held her breath in the pause between question and reply. [21] Mara was a vivid mural restorer, known for making faded saints look newly surprised, and she liked her work the way a child likes puzzles--methodically playful. [47] Certainty had paid her bills, but lately it felt like a varnish that kept the world from breathing, so she had begun to practice exchanging certainty for curiosity. [75] In her apron pocket she carried a hobo nickel, carved with a tiny ear and a ripple, a charm given by her late mentor who believed sound could wake paint. [105] The restoration site was the citys old amphitheater, and behind its crumbling stage the planners had built a sound wave garden: hedges cut into sine curves, stones tuned to ring when tapped, pools shaped like commas. [141] Mara had been assigned to revive a mural of the first singers, but the wall kept resisting, as if it remembered too much and wanted to stay mute. [169] She learned that if she stood in the garden and clapped once, the reflected sound from the curved hedges returned in clean loops that matched the cracks she needed to seal. [200] It was like listening to a map, and she began to time her brush strokes to the echo, laughing quietly when a stubborn flake lifted exactly on cue. [228] On the morning Tomas questioned her, she had just found a hidden circle in the plaster, the size of her nickel, with a pinhole at its center. [255] She pressed the hobo nickel over it, and the carving fit as if the coin had been cut from that wall; when she tapped the metal, the garden answered with a brighter echo. [288] The echo did not just bounce--it folded, a sound reflected off water, stone, and leaf, then back into her skull, and in that fold she felt herself bewitching the mural. [318] Color seeped through the gray like dawn through fog, and the painted singers opened their mouths, not with voices but with the exact shape of Tomas question. [345] Mara tried to answer him, but before she could, she woke--standing in the garden again, hands empty, the question still hanging in the air. [369] She blinked and saw the coin in her palm, saw Tomas at the doorway, and realized the awakening had nested inside the pause, as if the pause had rooms. [398] Methodical habits took over; she counted the echoes, three short and one long, and stepped between the tuned stones to find where the long echo would reflect back. [426] At that spot, she flicked the nickel into the comma pool, and the splash rang like a bell through the water, a reflected sound that returned as a whisper of her own name. [459] The whisper asked, "Did you remove the last layer, Mara?", and she woke again inside the previous awakening, now holding a brush already wet with solvent. [485] She understood then that the wall was not resisting; it was testing whether she would cling to being right, or let each answer dissolve and look deeper. [512] To trade certainty for curiosity, she did the one thing restorers are trained never to do: she stopped mid-stroke and listened for what the silence was reflecting. [539] The garden answered with Tomas footsteps echoed off the sine hedges, and each reflection arrived a heartbeat late, arranging itself into a new question she had not expected. [567] "What if the last layer is you?" the reflections seemed to say, and Mara laughed, because it was absurd and precise, the kind of joke the world tells when it trusts you. [599] She placed the nickel back into the pinhole circle and tapped it four times, letting the reflected sound bewitch her hands, and the solvent on the brush softened only what was false. [631] Behind the dissolving grime appeared an older mural of the same singers, but their eyes were unpainted mirrors, and in them she saw herself waking again and again, smaller each time, like dolls of attention. [666] At the smallest awakening, no bigger than the pause itself, she finally turned to Tomas and said, "I do not know yet," and the room stayed bright with possibilities as his reply began.
