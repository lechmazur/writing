<story>At the rainwashed tower in spring, the stones shone like cooled bronze against the clouded sky. [16]I arrived after making first contact, when every map in the institute suddenly felt provisional. [31]The signal had come from the tower itself, a narrow band of light repeating a pattern too patient for weather. [51]They sent me because I was a luminous skeptic, a biochemist who refused to kneel to either myth or management. [71]My skin still held a faint lab glow from the tracer dyes I tested on myself, an academically rebellious habit. [91]The council wanted a report, but I wanted to understand the chemistry of homecoming that the signal seemed to promise. [111]Homecoming was supposed to be a feeling, yet the pattern pulsed with the regularity of a reaction clock. [129]At the tower gate, an archivist pressed a small vial into my palm and said it had been found in the stairwell. [151]Inside the vial lay fly amber, a teardrop of resin with a gnat frozen midwing, impossibly fresh. [168]The archivist called it a relic, but my meter read volatile terpenes, as if the forest that made it was still breathing. [190]On the plaza below, volunteers waited to begin what the council advertised as an artificial pilgrimage back to our own origins. [211]Each pilgrim wore a headset that played the tower signal, guiding their steps as surely as hunger. [228]I was assigned to monitor the group, but I slipped my own receiver into my pocket and listened without the prescribed filters. [250]The unfiltered sound had harmonics that made my teeth ache, like a missing element looking for its mate. [268]When the pilgrims started, they did not follow the paved road but chose to converge toward the garden behind the tower. [289]I followed them via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path, where stone faces were buried in moss and nettle. [310]The footprints should have washed away in the rain, yet they persisted as a pale powder that glittered in my lamp. [331]I scraped some into a slide and saw microcrystals arranged like tiny ladders, self assembling under the moisture. [349]The pattern matched the tower signal, translated into matter, which meant the first contact was not a voice but a catalyst. [370]At the end of the sculpture path stood a bronze door half swallowed by ivy, and the pilgrims halted as one. [391]Their headsets went silent, and in that bronze quiet I heard my own blood and the tower answering it. [410]I held the vial up, and the fly amber warmed, as if recognizing the air beyond the door. [428]Without asking permission, I cracked the vial, letting the terpene scent spill onto the crystals of the footprints. [446]The powder flashed, not bright but deep, and a seam appeared in the bronze door where no seam had been. [466]The pilgrims leaned forward, not in worship, but in a reflex as old as turning toward home lights. [484]I realized the council had built the pilgrimage to herd us into contact again, to see who would return and what would change. [507]Beyond the door was a narrow chamber where rainwater dripped through the ceiling and pooled around a pedestal of glass. [527]In the pedestal, the same microcrystals grew like coral, feeding on humidity, and their growth made the light pattern. [546]A plaque named the substance Pilgrim Salt, designed to bind to the chemicals each of us carried from childhood rooms. [566]The tower was not calling strangers; it was sampling us, using scent and sweat to tune itself toward our lost places. [587]When my own breath reached the crystals, they shifted color, and I saw that my lab dyes had made me easier to read. [610]The homecoming I chased was not nostalgia, but a measurable convergence of volatile molecules that could open doors. [628]I took a scalpel to the pedestal and cut a shard free, deciding that any true return required theft from the script. [650]As the pilgrims filed back into the rain, their footprints already rewriting the path, I pocketed the shard and walked homeward to report a different chemistry. [676]</story>
