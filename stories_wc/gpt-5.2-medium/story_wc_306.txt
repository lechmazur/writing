<story>After the campfire's last spark died on the cliff path, Mara Kestrel walked alone toward the breezy lighthouse at dawn, keeping her coat tight and her thoughts looser. [28] She was a conscience for hire, paid to sit beside other people's decisions and whisper questions they were afraid to ask themselves. [50] Tonight's client had been a keeper named Sile, who built tidy certainties like stacked stones and wanted one more stone laid before morning. [73] He said he sought clarity, but the way his eyes flinched from the dark proved he wanted permission to ignore it. [94] Mara had answered in her usual style, sincerely insincere, offering agreement with a smile while secretly weighing every unspoken doubt that smile tried to hide. [119] At the end of their talk, he had pressed a hollow mirror shard into her palm, a splinter of silver glass that reflected nothing but light and made her feel watched anyway. [151] Bring this to the lantern room, he had said, and unhook the cloak of doubt that hangs there, because I cannot touch it without losing my nerve. [178] Now, as gulls wheeled in the whitening sky, the lighthouse hummed with wind chimes strung along the doorframe, each set tuned by Sile to speak in code to those who listened. [209] Mara had learned his method during last week's watch, deciphering wind chime selections the way other people read letters, counting the pauses, the struck notes, the direction the breeze chose. [238] The chimes spoke this morning too, a low triad that meant enter, a bright rattle that meant alone, and finally a single dull clink that translated as do not trust your certainty. [270] Protected vulnerability was the only way to obey that last instruction, so she breathed through the ache behind her ribs and stepped inside without drawing her knife. [297] The spiral stairs smelled of salt and old oil, and with every turn she caught herself rehearsing the words she would sell Sile, as if conscience could be packaged like lamp wicks. [329] At the lantern room door, another row of chimes waited, and their pattern shifted when her mirror shard neared them, as though the empty glass carried an absence that the air could hear. [362] She held the shard up to the first light bleeding over the sea, and for an instant it showed her face without eyes, a reminder that certainty can be a kind of blindness. [395] Inside, the lantern was dark, but a cloak hung from a brass hook beside it, woven of gray threads that seemed to drink the dawn and breathe it back as questions. [426] Mara understood why Sile feared it, because the cloak of doubt did not simply cover shoulders, it covered motives, making every reason under it feel both true and incomplete. [455] She reached for the brass hook, then stopped, listening again to the chimes outside, and the dull clink repeated, insisting that her job was not to deliver answers but to welcome nuance into certainty. [489] So she unhooked the cloak slowly, letting it slide over her hands like cool smoke, and she wrapped it around herself instead of carrying it like a parcel. [517] The room seemed to widen, and in the hollow mirror shard she saw not Sile's face but her own past clients lined behind her, people who had hired her to justify cruelty, silence grief, or erase guilt. [554] She could have walked back down and sold Sile the same easy story, that the sea was calm and the rocks were mapped, but the cloak tightened, urging her to risk being honest. [587] When she found him by the extinguished fire ring outside, she sat close enough to share warmth yet far enough to keep her boundaries, and she placed the shard in the ash between them. [621] Then she told him the chimes had warned against certainty, that the mirror showed how fear hollows truth, and that wearing the cloak of doubt would not break his tower of stones, only teach it to bend in wind. [660] Sile flinched as if struck, yet his shoulders loosened, and when Mara offered the cloak he did not touch it, he simply nodded, accepting that nuance could be welcomed without surrendering the light. [693] In that guarded dawn, her paid conscience felt briefly like her own, and she left the lighthouse with the cloak on her back, not as stolen property but as a promise to keep questioning for both of them.
