After the birth, when my daughter slept with her fist clenched like a seed, I found minutes missing from the room, as if the clock had been swallowing its own ticks, and I, an onyx-ink cartomancer, could only taste their absence. [41]
My decks, stained black with soot and prayer, showed The Hourglass upside down every night, but the cards never said where the stolen time went, and the mystery made me willingly perplexed, as if confusion were the only honest lullaby. [81]
In our family we marked birthdays by spreading a linen tablecloth and tracing each hand in ink, palm lines included, so later we could lay new hands over old shapes and see what had grown, what had shrunk, what had left. [122]
On the morning she was born I had traced my own hand with shaking fingers, then hers with the tip of her tiny thumb, and when I looked again three days later a blank white space yawned between the outlines, time unaccounted for. [165]
The clue came from a dolls' tea set my mother had kept in a cedar box, because inside one saucer ran an old crack that split like a river delta, and when I held it over the tablecloth, the fissure matched the blankness perfectly. [209]
Cartomancy is mostly listening, but onyx ink has weight, and I drew a spread directly onto the saucer, letting the crack decide where each symbol rested, until the pattern pointed upward, past our roof, to the midnight glade above clouds. [249]
I wrapped my daughter against my chest, had to unfasten the ribbon that kept my traveling deck bound, and used it as a tether around my waist, because the path to that glade was a stair of condensed sighs and I did not trust myself not to drift. [297]
Above the last cloud layer the air turned painfully clear, each blade of grass in the glade jeweled with ice-light, and the beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat, sweet and urgent and impossible to spit out. [337]
In the center stood a tree made of vapor braided into bark, and from its branches hung pale pouches that pulsed like lungs, each one labeled with a name, a date, a hush, and I knew I had found where lost time accumulates. [380]
My own pouch dangled low, fat as a plum, and when I touched it the missing days after labor surged back as images of me whispering, Take it, take it, to the ceiling, begging for sleep, bargaining with the universe. [420]
That was my cloudbound repentance, not a prayer sent upward but a confession trapped here in weather, and the tree answered by tightening the air around me until I could barely breathe, as if to teach me the shape of every second I had thrown away. [466]
I wanted to snatch the pouch and flee, yet my daughter's warm weight reminded me that time is not only what I use, it is what I owe, so I set the cracked saucer at the tree's roots and dealt my cards into its fracture like seeds. [513]
The spread showed The Mother, The Sleepless, and The Thread, and I understood that to reclaim the lost hours I had to relive them without trying to escape, so I asked the tree to return them slowly, and I stayed willingly perplexed, open to whatever hurt came. [560]
The pouch loosened, and the glade poured the hoarded time into me as a series of long, ordinary moments: washing blood from sheets, rocking through feverish dawns, learning my daughter's cries, then tracing our hands again on the birthday cloth with steady ink. [603]
When I climbed back down the sigh-stair, the tablecloth lay on our kitchen table, and the blank space had filled with overlapping palms, mine and hers, and a thin line like the saucer crack, a scar that proved time can return when you stop unfastening yourself from it. [651]
