<story>After remembering became painful, I climbed the switchback stairs to the labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain, because I needed to understand the shape of home. [26]
Inside, shelves rose like cliff faces, and every corridor bent back on itself, as if the building listened for footsteps the way a storm listens for trees. [53]
The air held hidden thunder, a pressure behind the paper dust, and the lamps trembled though no wind reached this deep. [74]
At the first junction a mercury-glass seer waited, her eyes silvered like broken mirrors, her voice soft enough to make my teeth ache. [97]
She called me by the name I had refused to remember, then apologized when my hands went numb, as if she had touched a bruise. [122]
I told her I had come for the lost language stone, the one rumored to store the oldest maps of return, not in ink but in soundless grammar. [150]
The seer nodded and led me downward, where the bookstore grew wetter, and book spines glittered with mica like scales on sleeping fish. [173]
She explained that the mountain was an archive of people who could no longer bear their own memories, and each donation of a recollection became a new aisle. [201]
At night the place substitutes reality nightly, shuffling titles, dates, and even faces, so the patrons wake with gentler histories than they earned. [224]
That sounded like mercy, but it also sounded like the reason I could not picture my mother's kitchen without tasting metal. [245]
We stopped at a locked case, and she asked what talent I had buried to survive, because the stone would not open for an empty seeker. [271]
I said I had been a maker of names, able to hear what a thing wished to be called, until grief taught me silence and I packed that gift under years of labor. [304]
Her fingertip traced the lock, and she offered a method I did not expect: to read the stone via the texture of a feather, because feathers remember air better than minds do. [336]
From her sleeve she drew a black feather and placed it in my palm, and the quill prickled with cold as if holding back lightning. [361]
When I stroked it, syllables rose under my skin, and the case clicked open to reveal the lost language stone, dull as river rock but humming with unsaid rooms. [390]
The seer warned that the stone would show me home only if I was willing to seed it with one true memory, not a polished story. [416]
I thought of my mother's hands and the weight of the last goodbye, and the pain tried to shut my throat, yet I pressed the feather to the stone and let the raw moment spill. [451]
The bookstore answered with a distant rumble, hidden thunder rolling through the stacks, and the aisles shifted as if the mountain inhaled. [473]
In the stone's surface I saw not a house but a curve, a crescent of shoreline and a doorway cut into basalt, the place I had fled as a child. [503]
The seer whispered that my talent for names had never died, only gone underground, and now it could translate the stone's grammar into a path through the mountain. [531]
As midnight approached, reality began to substitute itself again, and I felt shelves blur, but the feather kept a steady texture, like a compass needle made of breath. [559]
We walked fast, naming each turn aloud, and every name I spoke pinned the corridor in place, resisting the nightly shuffle that would have stranded me in kinder lies. [588]
At a final door of stacked atlases, the seer did not follow, because she belonged to the mountain's changing dream, but she asked me to return and teach others to carry their pain without trading it away. [625]
I stepped through with the stone warm in my pocket, and behind me the hidden thunder quieted, as if the bookstore had accepted my seed and released me toward the true curve of home. [659]</story>
