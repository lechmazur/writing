<story>The staircase had no top and no bottom, only turning landings that repeated like a thought you could not finish. [20]I climbed anyway, a grim optimist with sore calves and a notebook pressed to my ribs. [36]Somewhere in the stone, the air held a hush that felt spacious, yet it never let me step outside it. [56]On the first landing I found a pair of dice, one chipped at the corner, sitting on the rail as if waiting. [78]I remembered another pair on another night, the one I did not throw when I should have, and my throat tightened. [99]This climb, I told myself, was to capture the texture of that missed opportunity before it wore smooth in memory. [119]I shook the dice in my palm and listened for the tiny stutter the chip made, a flaw that sounded like truth. [141]The staircase did not allow games, but it allowed numbers, and numbers were my lockpicks. [156]Each step was the same height, each turn the same angle, as if a mason had tried to build a proof in limestone. [179]At every tenth landing I paused to write equations, arguing through mathematical proofs that the staircase must either loop or end. [200]But my notebook filled with contradictions, because the stairwell was infinite in length and finite in view, boundless confinement made architecture. [221]A door appeared where no door had been, marked with a simple diagram of a wheel and an arrow chasing itself. [242]Behind it sat a device of brass arms and glass bearings, a perpetual motion machine that clicked without fuel or rest. [263]Its flywheel spun so steadily that my eyes began to believe in forever, and my heart began to argue back. [283]A placard warned: To stop the wheel, you must rupture the assumption that keeps it turning. [299]I laughed, because assumptions were my quarry, and because I was balancedly daring, cautious enough to check, brave enough to act. [320]I rolled the dice on the stone floor, letting the chipped one wobble, and I treated the outcome as a theorem's hypothesis. [342]Snake eyes meant the wheel was a loop; boxcars meant an exit; anything else meant I had misread the axioms. [362]They landed on a three and a four, which was neither promise nor refusal, only the bland middle where I had always hesitated. [385]That number reminded me of the night I watched Mara walk away, and I calculated the angle of my silence like a slope. [408]If I could stop this wheel, I thought, I could press my fingers into the grain of that moment and feel its roughness again. [432]I began a proof by contradiction: suppose the machine needed no input, then the staircase itself must be supplying energy through my climbing. [455]Yet my steps did not tire the air, and the stone gave no heat, so the only consistent source was my expectation. [477]Expectation, I realized, was a kind of motion, and if it could be made explicit, it could be interrupted. [496]I wrote a final lemma: the wheel turned because I believed there was a landing ahead where the missed chance could be redeemed. [519]To rupture that belief, I had to accept that the opportunity was not waiting above or below, but already lost in the act of climbing. [544]My hand shook as I closed the notebook and refused, for the first time, to imagine a better landing. [563]The perpetual motion machine coughed, as if offended, and the flywheel slowed by a fraction that felt like a door unlatching. [584]In that pause, the staircase around me seemed to widen, and the confinement became honest rather than hopeful. [602]I picked up the dice and set them beside the stalled wheel, not as a wager, but as evidence of my former self. [625]Without the machine's clicking, I heard my own breathing echo down the infinite staircase, a sound that had no timeframe, only distance. [647]I turned neither up nor down, but sat on the landing until the texture of the missed opportunity softened into something I could carry. [671]When I finally stood, the steps were still endless, yet each one was mine, and that was the only exit the proofs allowed. [694]</story>
