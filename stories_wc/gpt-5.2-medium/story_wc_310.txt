<story>After the universe contracts, the sky above the ambered observatory deck looks like a bruise lit from within. [18]No constellations hold their old shapes; they flicker, collapse, and reappear as if unsure they should exist at all. [37]Mara, the station's cast lots decision maker, stands at the rail with a quiet enthusiasm that does not match the cold in her suit. [61]She carries a collection of foreign coins, rescued from a museum on the last spiral arm, and she lets them click in her palm like stubborn little planets. [89]When engineers argue over whether to point the dish toward the compressed galactic core or the empty rim, Mara casts the coins and reads their faces as permission. [117]It is not superstition, she insists; in a universe that has folded in on itself, any decision is a guess, and a guess made cleanly is better than a guess made loud. [149]Tonight the receiver spits short static bursts, white noise that arrives in sharp clusters and then stops, as if the void is stuttering. [172]Mara has learned the method the others avoid, understanding static bursts by treating each cluster as a broken syllable in a language spoken backward. [196]The prophecy in the bursts makes no sense in forward time; it announces the results of choices not yet made, then lays out the reasons afterward, like footprints that form behind a walker. [229]The crew calls it the backwards prophecy and hates it, because it turns every hope into stellar doubt, every plan into an accusation. [252]Mara does not hate it; she is quietly enthusiastic, because if the universe can speak from after to before, purpose might still be reachable. [276]Her own purpose is simple and impossible: to wavelength align with purpose itself, to tune the station's last transmitter so a signal can slip through the contracting walls and be heard. [307]The bursts tonight repeat a number and a phrase, and she distills them into a map by boiling their jitter down to three stable frequencies. [332]One frequency is marked in the prophecy as already successful, another as already fatal, and the third as already chosen by her own hand. [356]The chief engineer demands certainty, but Mara only lays the coins on the console, each from a vanished nation, and asks them to fall as they must. [383]They spin in the amber light, ring softly, and settle with two heads up and one edgewise, a pattern she has never seen, yet the bursts had predicted it. [412]The backwards prophecy now becomes personal, telling her that the edgewise coin means she will not choose between core and rim, but split the dish to listen to both at once. [443]Doubt bites as she imagines the strain, the cracked bearings, the thin power reserves, and the possibility that the prophecy is only the station hearing its own ghosts. [471]Still, her enthusiasm stays low and steady, and she guides the engineers through the split, calibrating the twin feeds until the static bursts on each side align like two halves of a broken chord. [505]In that moment she hears, beneath the noise, a clear instruction that arrives last but explains first: send the distilled chord to the past, and you will become the reason you were told to send it. [541]Mara remembers the museum coins again, how every empire thought its face would be final, and she decides purpose is not a monument but a loop. [567]She locks the transmitter to the three frequencies, then distills the station's remaining fuel into a single burn for the capacitor banks, a sacrament made of chemistry and fear. [596]When the discharge comes, the deck trembles, and the amber panels around the dome glow as if sunlight has been remembered rather than received. [620]The signal rides out on the split dish toward core and rim, and in the same second the receiver answers with new bursts that describe, in past tense, the very tremble she is feeling. [654]The crew stares at her, waiting for relief, but Mara only watches the coins, because the edgewise one has begun to roll, slowly, as though time is finally choosing a side. [685]It falls flat on a blank face worn smooth, and she laughs once, small in her helmet, realizing the prophecy was never about certainty, but about becoming aligned enough to act anyway. [717]Outside, the stars keep doubting themselves, but the station now holds a chord that can be heard before it is played, and Mara, cast lots decision maker, has finally chosen to be its source.
