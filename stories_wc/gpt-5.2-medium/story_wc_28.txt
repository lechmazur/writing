<story>After the great fire, the ancient plaza lay open beneath a shattered sky, its stones rinsed white by ash and rain. [21]Samir, a gentle radical with a mason's hands and a dissident's patience, walked there at dawn with measured steps. [40]He wore an iron frame over his coat, jointed like a cradle, because he had sworn to cradle empathy in arms of steel. [63]The frame was not a weapon, yet it made people flinch, and he answered their fear with a warmth that felt cold. [85]In the plaza's center, a mosaic stepping stone survived, its surface chipped into strange constellations by falling glass. [103]When Samir knelt and traced the chips, the patterns pulled him backward, retrocognitively trapped in the moment the flames began. [123]He saw, as if through ice, the old market stalls, the laughing children, and the first torch arcing from the minaret. [144]The vision never let him change anything, only watch, which was its cruelty and also its lesson. [161]He had learned to use that helpless watching as a tool, reading history via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone. [183]Today the chips spelled a route, and in the retrocognition he followed it to the minaret's broken base. [201]There, embedded in soot, glimmered a single minaret mosaic tessera, blue as river depth, loosened by heat. [218]He pried it free and felt a pulse of remembered prayer, not his own, rise into his throat. [236]The council had called the survivors of the fire Cinders, a name meant to keep them small and grateful. [255]Samir believed names were scaffolds for souls, and he planned to rename them before despair hardened into law. [273]His movement was radical because it refused vengeance, insisting instead on aberrant mercy toward those who had lit the torches. [293]That mercy looked wrong to many: he wanted the arsonists alive, their wrists locked in steel cuffs that also carried bread. [314]He called the design a Grasp, an embrace that could restrain a hand while forcing it to feel another hand's shaking. [335]In the plaza, he met Lina, a guard who had lost her brother in the blaze and now guarded the council's storehouses. [357]She watched him pocket the tessera and spat, asking why he collected ruins instead of weapons. [373]Samir held the blue fragment up to the shattered sky and said, quietly, that a ruin could be a mirror. [393]He invited her to step on the mosaic stone with him, and when her boot touched the chipped pattern, her face drained. [415]The stone showed her the fire's first minute, and in that forced watching she recognized the boy who threw the torch. [436]He was not a monster but her own cousin, pressed into the council militia, eyes wide with orders he could not refuse. [458]Lina staggered off the stone, whispering that she could kill him or forgive him, and both choices tasted like ash. [478]Samir offered a third choice, an aberrant mercy that demanded labor and listening: bring the cousin to him, and no blade would rise. [501]In exchange, Samir would fit the Grasp to the boy's arms and make him carry water to the burned quarters each morning. [523]Lina laughed once, bitter and soft, and asked what name he would give such a punishment. [539]Samir set the tessera into the stepping stone's chipped groove, and the blue fit like truth into a wound. [558]The mosaic flared with the plaza's older name, a name erased after the fire, and he said it aloud to rename the place. [581]He called it Haven of Hands, and in the same breath renamed the survivors not Cinders but Keepers. [599]The new names did not rebuild roofs, yet they shifted how people stood, shoulders less bowed, eyes less hungry for revenge. [620]Lina looked at the steel frame on Samir's chest and understood his vow: cold metal could carry warmth if it carried responsibility. [642]That evening she brought her cousin to the plaza, and the boy trembled as Samir buckled the Grasp around his forearms. [663]The cuffs clicked shut with a sound like winter, but Samir slid a loaf into the attached tray and made the boy share it with Lina. [689]Under the shattered sky, their chewing was the first quiet truce the plaza had heard since the smoke, and Samir felt the past loosen. [713]He knew the retrocognitive trap would return whenever he touched the stone, yet now the watching served a future he had named. [735]</story>
