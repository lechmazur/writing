During the solar storm, the sky over the prismatic escondite pulsed like a bruise, and the air carried a hushed thunder that made even machines speak softly. [27]
Ilias had lived so long that lightning bored him, yet tonight his immortal patience frayed, because he was dimensionally aware and could feel space itself twitching under the storm. [56]
The escondite was a refuge built from prismatic glass and folded corridors, a hideout for those who trafficked in forbidden physics, and it was the only place he still felt curiosity. [87]
He had come with one purpose: to discover what happens after goodbye, not the sentimental word, but the moment a connection is severed and a world chooses a new arrangement without you. [119]
On his palm lay a cursed amulet fragment, half a disk of dark metal veined with salt-white cracks, taken from a cult that promised exits from every ending. [147]
When he held it near the wall, the fragment tugged on the building's magnetic lattice, and the colors in the glass shifted as if trying to remember another spectrum. [176]
The escondite's caretaker, a quiet woman named Maris, watched him from behind a curtain of refracted light and said, 'The storm will wake the corridors; don't provoke them. [204]
Ilias answered with the smallest smile, because intrigue was the only emotion he could still manufacture on demand, and he suspected Maris knew why the amulet had been broken. [233]
As the solar storm intensified, compasses in the escondite spun, and the hallways began a spatial mutiny, sliding sideways through themselves so that doors opened onto rooms that did not exist a breath before. [267]
Maris gripped a brass railing that suddenly became a ladder, her knuckles pale, and whispered that the building was defecting toward a neighboring dimension where lost farewells collected like dust. [297]
Ilias felt the mutiny in his bones, a pressure change between angles, and he realized the corridors were not merely rearranging but choosing allegiance, responding to the storm's magnetic fields like iron filings. [330]
He pressed the amulet fragment to his chest and listened; the metal hummed in counterpoint to the thunder, mapping invisible lines that his dimensional awareness could translate into routes. [359]
Following those lines, he stepped into a corridor that tilted ninety degrees without apology, and the prismatic walls showed him overlapping versions of Maris, each one looking away at a different goodbye. [391]
In one reflection she wore the cult's sigil, in another she held a whole amulet, and in the truest image she was simply tired of guarding the doorway between departures. [421]
He found her at the heart chamber, a hexagon of spinning glass prisms, where the mutiny gathered like a council and the air smelled of ozone and old letters. [450]
'You broke it,' he said, raising the fragment, and she did not deny it; she admitted the amulet was cursed because it forced anyone who used it to become the goodbye they sought. [483]
Maris had once tried to cross, she confessed, and came back emptied of her own past, so she hid the fragment here and trained the escondite's magnetic shields to keep the mutiny asleep. [516]
But the solar storm overwhelmed every shield, and now the corridors demanded a leader, a will strong enough to choose which dimension would win the rebellion. [542]
Ilias understood then that his boredom was a kind of cowardice, an endless refusal to risk losing himself, and that the only honest way to learn after goodbye was to let the amulet rewrite him. [577]
He asked Maris to stand back, and he walked into the prismatic council, holding the fragment aloft so it could drink the storm's magnetic fields and speak for him. [606]
The space around him buckled, each corridor arguing in angles, but the amulet hummed louder until the mutiny quieted into a single path, a slit of darkness edged with rainbow. [636]
He looked back at Maris and, for the first time in centuries, meant the word, because goodbye had never been real for him while he stayed; he said it, and stepped through. [668]
On the other side there was no corridor, only a vast field of suspended moments, every farewell he had overheard or caused, and he felt his immortality peeling away like a coat in rain. [702]
The cursed fragment completed itself around his heart, not as metal but as acceptance, and he finally understood what happens after goodbye: space stops obeying you, and you become part of what remains. [735]
