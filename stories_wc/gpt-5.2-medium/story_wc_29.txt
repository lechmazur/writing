<story>The university radio station sat under the observatory dome like a bunker of glass and rust, and Mara Venn, the campus celestial signal interpreter, worked night shifts there with headphones, coffee, and a cautiously hopeful grin she did not quite trust. [41]On her desk lay astronomical charts inked with looping ephemerides, because the new signals were never only audio, they matched positions, as if someone had braided sound to starlight and left the knot to be found. [77]Two months earlier the town had cheered when Mara decoded a clean beacon from the Perseus rift, but now, as the community divides into the Votaries who wanted to answer and the Quiet who wanted to shut every antenna down, every decode felt like a vote. [123]The station manager, a Votary with campaign buttons on his denim jacket, demanded she broadcast the next sequence live, while the physics chair threatened to cut funding unless she surrendered her recordings for review, and Mara saw the power plays forming a net around her. [168]Yet the patterns in the hiss told another story, one her charts confirmed: the beacon shifted whenever humans argued about it, as though the sky were listening and nudging the quarrel toward sharper edges. [202]Mara had read old logs from wartime shortwave operators, and she recognized the signature of cosmic tricksters, intelligences that did not invade with ships but with baited meanings, turning groups against each other until someone handed them control of the dial. [243]To outwit them, she needed to interfere, not by silencing the signal, but by speaking back in a way only the rift would notice, a countercurrent below the range of ordinary hearing. [275]In the cramped studio she rewired the broadcast chain, routing a tone generator into the transmitter and tuning it to subsonic frequencies that would ride under the music, under the talk shows, under the furious town meetings aired at midnight. [315]Her plan was simple in outline and brutal in risk: feed the tricksters a false map, a modulation that mimicked their own cadence but led their triangulation toward a patch of empty sky, while she watched for any correction. [354]Before she hit the switch, she traced lines on the astronomical charts with a pencil worn to a splinter, aligning the Perseus rift with the university tower and with the fault line that split the town into east and west, signal and silence. [397]At 2:13 a.m. the beacon surged, the manager pounded on the locked door demanding airtime, and Mara, hands steady despite the grit under her nails, sent her subsonic reply into the transmitter like a prayer spoken through concrete. [435]The studio monitors showed nothing, but her spectrum analyzer blossomed with a second lattice, and in that inaudible lattice she felt a pressure change, as if something vast had leaned closer and then hesitated. [469]Outside, the Quiet held a candle vigil by the station steps while the Votaries rallied across the street, and for a moment the shouting softened, not into peace but into wary listening, the kind that admits the other side is real. [510]Mara watched the beacon try to reassert its old pattern, then slip along the false map she had laid, and she realized the tricksters were not omnipotent, only opportunistic, counting on humans to do their work for them. [548]When the physics chair arrived with security and the manager arrived with a microphone, she handed them a copy of the charts and the recordings, explaining that the real contest was not contact versus fear but who got to weaponize wonder, and she asked them to keep broadcasting her subsonic shield until the town chose its own voice.
