<story>The opera house had taken the river into its ribs, and the orchestra pit was now a shallow pool under the stage. [22] Lena, a pit violinist, stood ankle-deep among drowned music stands, holding a lantern whose flame fluttered like a nervous bow stroke. [43] Above her, velvet seats faded into darkness, but the flooded floor reflected the lantern light in broken panels, turning every aisle into an in between space. [69] She had been lately inspired by silence itself, by the hush of unstruck chords that hung in the air since the last evacuation. [92] In that hush she could hear the building breathe, and she believed the ghost of Maestro Varga was still conducting somewhere between the boards and the water. [119] Months ago, a stagehand had pressed an antique opera program into her case and whispered that Varga left a code in it before he drowned in the cellar. [147] Tonight Lena returned to unravel it, not with words, but by answering whatever the dead could say through damp paper and music she did not dare play. [174] She unfolded the program on the rim of the pit, where water lapped at the gilt lettering, and let a drop fall from her fingertip onto the cover. [202] The ink did not just blur; it swelled into pale shapes, as if water damage were developing photographs, and a faint staff line appeared where no line had been printed. [232] Lena held the lantern low, and in the wavering light the stains resolved into tiny maps of the theater: the pit, the catwalk, the locked rehearsal rooms. [259] Each map had a note head floating in a corridor, always placed in the narrow gaps between doors or under stairwells, marking the in between spaces Varga favored. [287] She understood then why the stagehand said it was a code: the ghost was giving directions without speaking, and expecting her to reply by moving. [312] To disrupt the fear that kept everyone away, Lena climbed out of the pit and crossed the flooded stage, where set pieces leaned like wrecked ships. [338] The lanterns, set by her own hands along the proscenium, flickered as drafts slid through torn curtains, and their light made the water shimmer with false applause. [365] She followed the first stained map to the gap behind the bass drum storage, a slit of space where the wall met a collapsed stair, and waited. [392] In the hush she felt a pressure near her ear, like the moment before a conductor gives the downbeat, and her fingers lifted without thinking into first position. [420] She did not draw the bow; instead she tapped the wood of the violin softly, and the taps echoed back as droplets falling from a pipe above. [447] When the pipe dripped three times, she opened the program again, let those drops land on the next page, and watched another image rise from the paper. [474] This stain formed measures of music, but the bars were broken, and the missing beats matched the theater map, as if the melody could only exist in gaps. [502] Lena moved from mark to mark, from under-seat crawlspace to balcony stairwell, replying with taps and breath, until she reached the old rehearsal room above the pit. [529] Its door was swollen shut, yet the program, dampened once more, revealed a final image: a keyhole drawn in water-dark ink, and beside it a single fermata. [556] She took the hint and stopped, holding still through a long, held silence, and the swollen wood creaked as if listening, then eased inward on its own. [583] Inside, half-submerged chairs circled a stand where Varga once taught, and on the stand lay a ledger wrapped in oilcloth, untouched by the flood. [607] Lena set down her lantern and, in a wordless conversation, bowed to the empty room, then to the program, accepting that the ghost had used water to show her where to look. [639] The ledger contained Varga's last arrangement, written for instruments placed not onstage but in corridors and stairwells, so music would travel through the building's hidden seams. [665] He had predicted the flood and left this plan so the house could sing even when ruined, and Lena knew her task was to disrupt the old notion of performance. [695] She returned to the pit at dawn and placed the antique program on the music rack, letting its wet pages face the rising light, and she began arranging lanterns in the aisles. [727] When other displaced musicians came quietly, she guided them without speech into the marked in between spaces, and amid the hush of unstruck chords they finally played, answering Varga.
