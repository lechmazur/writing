<story>In the benthic city of Pelagia, where towers grew from basalt and biolamps glowed like deep stars, Instructor Mara Kline taught navigation to divers and submersible pilots. [27]It was the year after we discovered aliens in the cold trench beyond the docks, and the council kept their wrecked probe sealed behind pressure doors, as if secrecy could make first contact gentler. [61]Mara was balancedly curious, never the kind to pry at a wound, yet unable to stop asking what lay above the waterline and beyond it, in the actual sky we had not trusted in generations. [96]The aliens had left no map, only a lattice of light recorded in their probe memory, a pattern that seemed to fold the horizon outward until directions multiplied, an idea Mara named unfolded horizons. [130]Her own motive was humble and fierce: to learn to navigate by starlight, not by sonar echoes that died in silt storms, and to teach that skill before the next alien signal arrived. [163]On the first day of the new course she placed a boat anchor chain link on each desk, rusted from a surface craft long sunk, and asked the students to feel the weight of a single connection. [200]The link, she said, was a compass with no needle, because its edges held angles that could be read when nothing else held steady. [224]She called the method edge geometry, and she demonstrated by shining a thin lamp across the metal, watching the rim throw a bright chord on the wall, then measuring that chord against the curve of the classroom dome. [262]From those measurements she expanded a plain circle into a coordinate net, the way a cartographer might expand a globe into a flat chart without tearing it. [289]After class, Mara carried her own chain link to the quarantine bay, where the alien probe sat like a broken pearl, and she compared the link's curve to the probe's strange lattice, hunting for matching radii. [325]The guards watched her in silence, because everyone still mourned the divers lost on discovery day, and even curiosity felt like disrespect in the citys dim halls. [352]Yet the probe memory, when she decoded it with her student Jae, did not show weapons or threats, only starfields seen from above the ocean, stitched into arcs that unfolded and overlapped like petals. [386]Mara realized the aliens navigated by expanding the horizon itself, using edge geometry in the sky: they tracked how the edges of constellations slid against the true line of night, and turned that sliding into position. [422]To test it she requested one surface ascent, and the council, uneasy but desperate to understand our visitors, granted a single tide window and a single companion, Jae. [450]They rode an elevator pod through kilometers of dark water, past ruins of old buoys, until the lid opened and air cut cold across their masks, and for the first time Mara saw a horizon that did not curve away into black. [492]Above it the stars were painfully bright, and she held the boat anchor chain link at arms length, aligning its inner edge with the line where sea met sky, then marking where a familiar triangle of stars touched the metal. [532]By repeating the sight and expanding her measurements into the alien petal arcs, she and Jae fixed their position without a beacon, and the certainty felt like grief and wonder braided together, as if the world had room again. [571]When they descended to the benthic city, Mara began rewriting the curriculum, not to chase the aliens, but to prepare our children for unfolded horizons, where every edge can be read and every direction can expand into responsibility.
