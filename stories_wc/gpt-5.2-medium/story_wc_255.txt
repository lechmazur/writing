<story>After the phoenix rises, the city smells of ash and sweet resin, and the glassblower's courtyard glitters with new panes like cooled tears. [23] Mara, a colorblind painter, comes there each dawn to sketch what others call red and gold, because she wants to find beauty in imperfection rather than chase correct hues. [52] The phoenix's return changed more than the skyline; it left behind bartered awakenings, little bursts of clarity that people can trade as if they were coins. [78] If you give someone an awakening, you lose that insight, but you gain whatever they offer, and the city's markets now hum with strangers selling memories of kindness or sudden courage. [109] Mara is innocently cunning, the sort who smiles as if she has forgotten to be wary while she measures every angle of a bargain. [133] She needs one specific thing from Master Joren the glassblower: a concertina reed tongue he keeps in a velvet pouch, a sliver of brass that sings when air passes and can wake cooled glass into motion. [169] Joren will not sell it for money, because after the phoenix rises he trusts only awakenings, and he has already bought too many that turned sour in his mouth. [198] To speak with him without begging, Mara uses the language she learned in the burned gardens, communicating through plant arrangements set along the courtyard wall. [223] Three sprigs of rosemary under a chipped jar mean thanks, a circle of ivy means listen, and a single thorny stem on bare stone means I will trade. [251] Joren answers by shifting his own pots, and their silent conversation becomes a dance of leaves and glass reflections while his apprentices pretend not to watch. [277] Mara offers him her first awakening from the phoenix day, the moment she realized her lack of color had made her notice texture and fracture better than any palette. [306] Joren pauses, tempted, but he sets a wilted fern beside an empty bowl, which means not enough, your clarity is common. [327] So Mara paints him a portrait on discarded packing paper, all in grays and misread browns, and she lets the mistakes show: the tremor in his hand, the soot in his beard, the tiny scar that his mirrors always hide. [367] When he sees it, his eyes shine with the shock of being understood, and Mara knows she has found a lever that does not feel like cruelty. [394] She places a wreath of cracked eggshells around a pot of mint, a bold arrangement that means I can awaken what you fear to touch. [419] Joren finally speaks aloud, voice rough from furnace smoke, and says the reed tongue once belonged to a street musician who bartered his last awakening for it and then forgot why music mattered. [452] He fears the same emptiness, yet he cannot stop collecting awakenings, because each one fuels his craft for a day, letting molten glass hold shapes it should collapse into. [481] Mara suggests a different trade: she will awaken his courtyard itself, not with magic but with a pattern he can read, and she will take the reed tongue only if he agrees to stop buying other people's clarity. [519] To prove it, she arranges the courtyard planters into a spiral that follows the fractures in the flagstones, turning each weed and broken shard into a marker, until the whole place resembles a map of breath. [555] Joren walks the spiral, reading her plant grammar, and something in him wakes that is not for sale, the simple attention he had before fire taught him greed. [583] He opens the velvet pouch and lets Mara hold the concertina reed tongue, and its cold edge bites her palm like an honest mistake. [607] But she does not take it yet; she asks for one more thing, an awakening of his that he can spare without hollowing himself. [631] Joren thinks, then offers the moment he first saw bubbles trapped in glass and decided they were stars, not flaws, and as he gives it away he still remembers it, because the gift is shared rather than stolen. [669] With that borrowed starlight in her mind, Mara finally takes the reed tongue and slips it into her paint box beside cracked brushes and soot colored chalk. [696] She breathes through it, and the note that emerges vibrates across the courtyard, making the hanging glass chimes tremble, and every tremor shows her a new shade of wrong that feels strangely right. [729] After the phoenix rises, people keep bartering awakenings, but Mara and Joren keep theirs rooted in rosemary, ivy, and bubbles, choosing trades that leave both of them more awake than before.
