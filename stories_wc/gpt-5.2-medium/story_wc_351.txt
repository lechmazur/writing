The moonlit canyon held its breath, silver light pooling in ledges like quiet water. [14]
Nira Voss stood at the rim with a coil of wire in her pocket and a tremor in her ribs. [34]
She was a helix-minded engineer, the kind who saw every problem as a spiral that could be climbed. [52]
Tonight her hands moved chaotically precise, measuring distances by instinct yet checking them twice against the stars. [69]
Below, the canyon floor was strewn with rusted instruments from the old dream-mines, relics left when the city forgot how to sleep. [91]
Nira had come during a period of profound transformation, when her own nights cracked open and spilled strangers into her waking hours. [113]
Those strangers were memories that were not hers, entangled memories snagged on hers like burrs on cloth. [130]
She no longer trusted her childhood, because it sometimes arrived wearing someone else's voice. [144]
A counselor had told her to accept the blur, but acceptance felt like surrendering the only map she had. [163]
Instead she chose a fiercer motive: to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams and catalogue what the world discarded. [182]
In the dream-mines, miners once lowered periscopes into sleep-chasms to watch their own subconscious shift. [197]
Nira found one periscope half buried in shale, its mirror cracked, its tube gnawed by sand. [213]
She lifted the broken periscope mirror and saw the moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes. [229]
The sight made her knees loosen, because the same dozen eyes had stared from a memory of a hospital corridor she had never walked. [253]
She understood then that the mirror was not just glass but a node, a place where dreams had been routed and crosswired. [275]
If she could modify it, she might sort the tangles in her head without losing the threads that mattered. [294]
Her toolkit was light, but her real method lived behind her eyes, in the slow rewiring of synapses. [312]
She had trained herself in lucid drills that nudged recall through synaptic plasticity, strengthening one pathway while letting another fade. [332]
Now she set the mirror on a flat stone and drew a helix of copper filament around its frame. [351]
Each turn corresponded to a memory segment, and each solder point marked where it had collided with someone else's past. [371]
She breathed in counts of five, letting fear quake through her reverie until it became a steady vibration she could tune. [392]
When she pressed her thumb to the crack, the mirror warmed as if it recognized her pulse. [409]
Images spilled up: a miner laughing, a child hiding under stairs, a lover signing goodbye in a language Nira did not know. [431]
She did not push them away; she labeled them like shards in a dig, noting texture, heat, and the direction they wanted to go. [455]
Then she chose one foreign corridor and walked it in her mind, adjusting the copper helix until the moon's reflection steadied. [476]
The hospital smell sharpened, and the voice attached itself to a face: her mother, younger than Nira had ever seen her. [497]
In that borrowed scene, her mother handed a periscope to a miner and begged him to keep Nira's dream safe while surgery erased it. [521]
The miner had hidden the mirror here, and over years other sleepers had looked through it, knotting their hopes to hers. [542]
Nira's transformation was not madness but inheritance, a network of forsaken dreams seeking an archivist. [557]
She modified the mirror again, not to sever the entanglement but to give each memory a clean angle of return. [577]
Through synaptic plasticity, she rehearsed the miner's laugh until it settled into its own shelf, separate from her father's. [596]
She rehearsed the lover's goodbye until it stopped hijacking her mornings and became a note she could take out and study. [617]
At last she looked through the periscope tube toward the canyon wall, and the rock turned translucent with layered sleeping histories. [638]
She descended into the moonlit canyon, quaking reverie guiding her steps, ready to excavate every abandoned dream and file it under living names. [661]
