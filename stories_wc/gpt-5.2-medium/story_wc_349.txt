<story>During the lull on a store's very first opening day, I set my cart beneath the glass boughs of the glass orchard library floating upon a swirling sea of clouds, where each leaf was a pane and each pane held a catalog number. [43]The whole building floated on a swirling sea of clouds, and the shelves drifted like rafts, bumping softly as the wind turned pages no one touched. [69]I was the clean slate vendor, hired to sell blank ledgers, erasers, and little jars of solvent that could lift ink from paper without lifting the paper's memory of being written on. [101]People said my wares were for liars, but I knew they were for the hopeful, for those who wanted a second start to sound like a first. [128]On the top shelf of my cart, wrapped in gray cloth, sat a single object the library itself had paid me to carry: bottled moonlight, distilled from last night's spill between the stacks. [161]The bottle glimmered with a pale pulse, and the pulsing felt like speech broken into photons, as if a story were trying to start but could not find its first word. [192]I had come here for that word, to find the place where stories begin, because my own past had been wiped so clean that even my name slid away when I tried to hold it. [227]The librarians called me mindfully scattered, a compliment for someone who could keep track of hundreds of blanks while still noticing the pattern of cloud vortices beneath the floor. [256]They said scattering was necessary here, because the library's orchard grew books the way trees grew fruit, and every ripened volume fell into fragments that had to be gathered in the right order. [289]In the quiet gap between customers, the head archivist, Mira, approached my cart and slid a parole docket across the counter, its seal shining like dew. [315]Glimmering parole, she said, tapping the seal, and I understood that the library granted certain stories permission to leave their cages and enter the world, but only if their beginnings were properly cut free. [349]The cut was my job: to incise, not in paper but in absence, opening a channel in the blank spaces so the first sentence could slip through without tearing. [378]Mira set the bottled moonlight beside the docket and told me the bottle was both key and witness, because moonlight remembers what it touches even after the touching is done. [408]To earn the parole, she continued, I had to measure the missing parts of an origin tale, by quantifying absence, counting the gaps where the author had refused to say what came before. [441]She led me between glass trunks to a reading table hung over open sky, where a book lay in shards: paragraphs on separate petals, dialogue on strips of bark, and a title that was only a hole. [478]My hands shook, not from fear but from recognition, because the hole where the title should be matched the hollow in me, and I wondered if this was my own beginning under a different cover. [513]I uncorked the moonlight and let a thread of it spill onto the table; it spread into a map of faint lines, linking each fragment to the silence around it, making the silences countable. [547]I counted the unprinted pauses between words, the number of times a character almost spoke, the length of the blank margin where a birthplace ought to be, and with each sum I felt a doorway forming. [583]When the totals matched the docket's seal, I took my stylus, pressed its tip into nothing, and incised along the doorway's edge, carving a clean curve through pure lack until it shone. [615]The fragments trembled, then snapped into a single page that began, not with a name but with the sound of a cart wheel on glass, and I knew the story was about a vendor entering a floating library. [653]Mira watched me read, and her expression broke and rejoined like the clouds below, because the glimmering parole had not freed a book from the library, it had freed me from the blankness that kept me outside my own life. [693]In the margin the page left an address, the root of the orchard where the first seed of narrative was kept, and during that same lull I packed my clean ledgers, tucked the bottle away, and stepped toward the beginning.
