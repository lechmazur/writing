<story>Jorin, a wandering fireworks designer, came up the last switchback as the blooming fortress at dusk exhaled perfume from its wall gardens. [22]He chanted while walking, not prayers exactly, but little rhythmic recipes for color and lift that kept his feet and mind from sinking. [45]Tonight was the hush of a night with no stars, the sky a lid of soot-gray cloud, and the fortress gates were closed like a clenched jaw. [72]A guard with tired eyes searched his pack and found only tubes, powders, and the fire spinner's kerosene rag knot Jorin used to tame flame in his hands. [100]Jorin held the knot up, its blackened fibers braided tight, and joked that it was his passport, because it had survived every border fire. [124]The guard almost smiled, then remembered why no one smiled here: the fortress, though blooming, was ringed by famine camps, and hope fell heavier than stone. [150]Inside, Jorin met Castellan Mirel, who asked for fireworks not for a festival but for a diversion, a way to keep despair from becoming a riot. [176]Jorin agreed, because his own motivation was to defy the gravity of hopelessness, and nothing defied gravity more honestly than sparks that chose to climb. [201]Mirel led him through corridors tiled with old mosaics, and Jorin let his ambient awareness do the work, filtering the fortress's moods from the sounds of water, breath, and distant coughing. [232]He had learned to filter stories the same way he filtered powder, by sifting what he heard through smell and echo until only the true grain remained. [259]At a turning, his chant changed tempo, and his eyes caught on a single blue tile set wrong, a note in mosaic shaped like a musical quaver. [286]He knelt and touched it, and the tile warmed under his finger as if it had been waiting, then shifted to reveal a thin paper slip sealed behind glass. [315]The slip held a map and a sentence in a child's hand: Light the river gate, not the sky, and the hungry will walk in. [340]Jorin tucked the message beside his kerosene rag knot, because both were tools for making fire behave, and he asked Mirel why a fortress needed secret instructions from a child? [370]Mirel admitted there was a river gate blocked by collapsed masonry, and that the council would rather starve proudly than open to the camps, fearing the mob more than death. [400]Serious playfulness was Jorin's trade, so he proposed a show that would make the council laugh for one breath, then look where the laughter pointed. [425]In the courtyard, as darkness thickened into that starless hush, he laid out mortars and a small clay filter pot, using it to strain river water for his black powder paste. [456]He looped the kerosene rag knot around his wrist like a bracelet, spinning it once to test its weight, and the smell of fuel steadied him better than any sermon. [486]When the council gathered on the balcony, Jorin began his chant again, louder, syncing fuse lengths to syllables, so that each spoken beat became an ignition cue. [513]The first shells burst not overhead but low along the inner wall, painting absurd flowers of green flame that made the council blink, then grin despite themselves. [540]As they leaned forward, he fired a second sequence that traced arrows of red sparks toward the river passage, and in that light Mirel saw the map's line match the stones. [571]Mirel ordered workers to clear the collapse, and Jorin, reading the crowd through ambient awareness, filtered panic into purpose by keeping the courtyard bright with playful bursts while the gate groaned open. [603]From outside came the sound of feet and thin cheers, and the camps entered in lines, not a mob, because the fireworks had turned the night into a stage with rules. [634]Jorin walked beside them, still chanting, letting the rhythm carry fear away, and he handed the rag knot to a boy who trembled at the torches, teaching him to spin flame safely. [666]At the river gate the child who had hidden the note stood watching, and when Jorin bowed with mock ceremony, she answered with a solemn grin that matched his. [695]No stars appeared, yet the sky no longer felt empty, and Jorin knew his work was not to brighten heaven but to show people, even in a fortress of flowers, how to rise together. [729]</story>
