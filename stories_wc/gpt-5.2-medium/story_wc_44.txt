<story>After the year when spoons began to bend reality, the floating isle of Vey kept its observatory open only at night, when the sky felt trustworthy and the lenses stopped lying. [31] Liora, a budding rune scholar, climbed its spiral stairs with ink-stained fingers and a quietly deliberate pace, because haste had been the first loop that snapped when the spoons twisted the laws. [63] She came seeking one question that would not leave her: where shadows go at noon, now that midday light sometimes fell like water and sometimes like stone. [90] In the chart room, beneath a dome of star-maps, she unwrapped the clockwork automaton key, a brass device shaped like a curled child, with teeth at one end and a tiny heart-spring in its chest. [125] Her mentor had called it an instrument of sealed awakenings, meant to open what had been bound without waking the binding itself, and he had vanished before explaining why noon swallowed darkness. [157] Liora had to relearn his craft from scraps, starting with the rule he loved to mutter: knowledge returns by closing loops, not by stretching lines. [182] So she drew a circle of chalk around the key, inscribed four runes for night, north, memory, and hinge, then wound the heart-spring until the little figure clicked upright on jointed feet. [214] It toddled along the chalk ring, tapping each rune in turn, and every tap folded the air so that the last sound met the first, forming a loop she could feel in her teeth. [248] When the loop sealed, the dome above showed a false noon, bright as a lamp, and Liora watched the floor for shadows that should have sat under tables but instead slid sideways as if pulled by tide. [285] The key-automaton halted at the eastern rune and pointed its brass face toward the observatory wall, where a hairline crack ran through an old mural of the isle floating over cloud. [316] Liora pressed her palm to the crack and spoke the hinge rune backward, closing the loop of syllables, and the mural peeled open like a book to reveal a narrow stair dropping into the underside. [351] Down there, the air smelled of iron and cold tea, and a corridor of suspended mirrors showed Liora a dozen angles of herself, each one missing a different shadow. [380] At the end stood a sealed door with no handle, only a keyhole shaped exactly like the automaton's toothed mouth, and the tiny figure raised its arms as if asking permission to enter. [413] Liora set the key against the hole and, instead of forcing it, traced a rune-ring around the doorframe until the beginning met the end, because sealed awakenings answered only to closed patterns. [445] The automaton slid in, turned once, and then walked out on the other side without leaving the lock, as though the loop had taught it to be both key and traveler. [476] Beyond the door lay a chamber where noon was stored: a white pool of light held under glass, and within it drifted countless shadows, folded and stacked like letters never delivered. [507] She understood then that the spoon-bending had snapped the world's straight beam of sun into circles, and at every midday the shadows were drawn through those circles into this reservoir, waiting for someone to close the final loop and send them back. [549] Quietly deliberate, Liora knelt, dipped her finger in the light without burning, and relearned the last rune by feel, completing a ring that joined her own shadow to the rest, so that when true noon returned above Vey the darkness would know the way home. [594] As the reservoir sighed and the folded shadows unfurled upward through the mirrors, the key-automaton curled back into brass stillness, and Liora climbed to the dome knowing her mentor had not fled, only sealed himself until she was ready.
