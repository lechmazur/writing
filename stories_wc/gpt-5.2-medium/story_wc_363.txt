In a forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest, Yara the wistful loom spinner kept her hut between pear trees that no one harvested, listening to a raveling silence that gathered in the branches like dusk. [36]
The silence was not emptiness but thread, and through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry she felt years loosen behind her, each day a strand sliding away from the loom before it could become cloth. [71]
Pinned to her wrist by a braided cord hung a tree sap amber bead, stoically sparkling even under soot, the last gift from her brother Jun before the war ferried him to the far coast. [106]
Jun had written one letter and then vanished, and Yara had sworn to carry a message across impossible distance, not by horse or ship but by weaving what could travel where bodies could not. [140]
Yet her loom had been still for three winters, because every attempt turned the orchard quieter until even her own breath sounded like trespass, and she feared the final cloth would ask a price she could not pay. [178]
On the first market day of spring she walked out through bamboo culms to the village square, and in a rummage sale box of cracked toys she found jigsaw puzzle edges, all border pieces, their paper backs stained with orchard pollen. [219]
The seller said they were worthless fragments from a picture long lost, but when Yara set them on her palm the amber bead warmed, and the pieces tugged at one another as if remembering a frame they had once held. [259]
Back in the orchard she laid the edges around her loom like a fence, fitting corner to corner until a rough rectangle formed, and inside it the raveling silence thickened into a shape that looked like coastline and tide. [298]
She understood then that the border was a map, and that through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box she could recommence her work with direction, weaving a path the way spiders follow the rim of a web. [338]
Night after night she drew thread from mulberry bark and from her own untorn memories, passing the shuttle under the amber bead so its resin light could seal each crossing, and the cloth that grew was nearly soundless, stealing her laughter and leaving only steady hands. [384]
When the rectangle of puzzle edge finally closed, the orchard itself faded beyond it, and through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry she watched seasons slide like cards, realizing the latent sacrifice required was her voice, which the weave drank to keep its long reach unbroken. [430]
At dawn she pressed the stoically sparkling bead into the cloth's center as a knot, mouthed Jun's name without sound, and sent the finished panel into the framed silence; far away on the coast, in a barracks where a man had forgotten how to hope, a strip of amber lit thread appeared on his cot, spelling her message in touch: come home. [492]
The moment it left her hands, the loom snapped back to plain wood and the puzzle edges fell apart, but the raveling silence did not; it pooled in Yara's throat, and she knew she could never speak again, only breathe and listen. [534]
Weeks later, bamboo leaves shivered with distant footsteps, and Jun stepped into the forgotten orchard wearing salt crust and bandages; he held the woven panel like a letter that had survived fire, and when he saw her mute mouth he bowed, understanding what she had paid. [580]
Yara lifted his hands to her cheeks and, in place of speech, guided his fingers over the last remaining threads on the loom, teaching him how to feel the pattern and how to recommence it if another impossible distance ever opened between them, so the orchard could keep its quiet duty without taking more than one voice.
