<story>After the last fish is caught, the harbor goes quiet in a way the sky seems to notice. [18]Nets hang like empty ribs, and the old tide clocks stop, as if the sea has finished its argument. [37]On the morning after that final haul, dawn spills over the sapphire viaduct and turns every stone a cooled flame. [57]Evin crosses it alone, a lukewarm mage whose spells never burn hot enough to impress anyone, including himself. [75]He is earnestly naive, certain that the world is a ledger that can be balanced if one finds the missing entry. [96]The missing entry, according to a cracked star chart he bought from a widow, is a sound that was never rung. [117]At his side he carries a broken ship's bell in a sack, green with salt and split down one seam. [137]The bell came from the trawler Saint Liora, which vanished the night the sea decided to stop giving fish. [156]People say the crew angered a god, but Evin thinks the universe is less personal and more mechanical. [174]If a weight slips on one end of creation, something else must rise, and that is the cosmic imbalance he wants to right. [197]His devotion to that idea is brittle devotion, strong when untouched, but splintering when pressed by doubt or laughter. [216]At the viaduct's center an aqueduct thread drips into a measuring basin, a civic trick to ration water. [234]Evin stops there, because he has learned that every honest miracle begins with understanding dripping rates. [250]He counts the intervals between drops, notes how wind at dawn shortens them, and writes the numbers on his sleeve. [270]The bell, he believes, is only metal until its emptiness matches the rhythm by which the world gives and withholds. [290]He chooses the basin because its drip is constant even after the last fish is caught, when so many patterns fail. [311]From the sack he takes the bell pieces and lays them on the blue stones like bones on a surgical cloth. [332]To rebuild it, he does not weld; he stirs river silt with powdered mica and warms it with a spell that barely steams. [355]The paste hardens only if he breathes on it exactly between the thirteenth and fourteenth drip, so he waits and listens. [376]His breath fogs the seam, and the bell's crack closes with a soft click that sounds like a door in a far house. [399]A steward of the viaduct, seeing this, asks what guild approved such work, and Evin answers, "The one that keeps count." [420]The steward laughs, and Evin's brittle devotion wavers, but the basin drips on, indifferent and reassuring. [436]When the bell is whole again, he threads it to the viaduct railing with net cord from the silent harbor. [456]He has no ship to hang it on, so he makes the viaduct into a prow aimed at the open east. [477]The star chart says the imbalance began when a call for guidance went unanswered, so the bell must answer late. [497]He rings it once, timed to the drip he measured, and the sound travels out as a clean circle in the air. [519]No thunder comes, only a small shift: the viaduct stones brighten, and the sea beyond the harbor tilts like a listening ear. [541]In that tilt he hears another bell, impossibly distant, answering from the place where the Saint Liora should have returned. [561]Fish do not suddenly leap back into nets, but a silver ripple writes itself along the tide line, a promise rather than a gift. [585]Evin feels the universe settle by a fraction, as if a scale stopped trembling, and he almost smiles at the plausibility. [606]The steward, no longer laughing, touches the bell and finds it warm, though Evin's magic was never more than lukewarm. [626]As dawn finishes, Evin leaves the bell to keep counting drops, trusting that devotion can bend without breaking if it keeps time. [648]</story>
