<story>After the anesthesia wears off, I wake face down in needles of violet moss, the air tasting of metal and sap, and the sky above the ultraviolet forest is a bruise that gives light instead of taking it. [38] My wrists still remember the chair and the questions, because I am an enhanced interrogation survivor, and whoever rebuilt my nerves made me proprioceptively enhanced, so every joint reports its angle like a confession I cannot stop hearing. [76] I brace on my elbows, testing the world with that unwanted precision, and the movement triggers the method they taught by accident, remembering through trauma responses, flashes that arrive with nausea and with the old order to cooperate. [114] A strap lies under my cheek, cold and heavy, a pewter mask strap cut loose from the hood they buckled over my mouth, and when I pick it up the metal stains my palm with a faint ultraviolet smear, as if the forest wants proof. [159] In the facility they called it penance: walk into the ultraviolet forest and let the trees write your guilt in invisible ink, then read it back to the tribunal at dawn, a process they named ultraviolet penance and sold as rehabilitation for people like me. [204] I did not come to repent, though the forest hums like a chapel; I came because somewhere in those glowing trunks are the computations the interrogators feared, the mathematics of mercy, the rules that decide who is spared and who is broken. [246] My memories were partitioned under drugs, and now, after the anesthesia fades, they leak back in patterns: a pulse in my throat equals a code word, a tremor in my left knee equals a number, and the strap in my hand is the key that keeps time. [293] I follow the numbers by walking between trunks that glow when I look away, feeling displaced rooted at once, because I was ripped from ordinary streets, yet the moss holds my footprints and the air smells of the same antiseptic that once meant home. [337] A clearing opens where the bark is etched with equations that only appear under violet light, and my enhanced proprioception translates them into muscle urges, so I find myself bracing my back against a cedar and breathing until the tremor in my knee becomes a sequence. [383] The sequence resolves into a memory of the tribunal mathematician, a woman with inkless hands, telling the interrogators that mercy has ratios, that pain must be discounted by intention, and that my case was an outlier they could not force into their ledger. [426] When my stomach clenches, another flash arrives, remembering through trauma responses again: the pewter mask, the strap tightening, ultraviolet lamps scorching my closed eyelids, and a whispered bargain that if I found the forest formula, others would be released. [465] I understand then why I was dropped here half asleep: the forest is the archive, and the archive only opens to bodies that have been tuned by cruelty, because only a body that flinches on cue can read the invisible ink without lying. [508] So I loop the pewter strap around my fingers like a rosary and walk deeper, letting each spike of fear mark a coordinate, until I reach a fallen tree whose rings glow in concentric proofs, and I brace its trunk with my shoulder to steady the final calculation. [556] The mathematics of mercy is not a single number but a function: it grows when harm is admitted, it shrinks when power hides behind procedure, and it requires a witness, which is why the ultraviolet penance demands that I read the equation aloud to the trees. [602] My voice shakes, but the forest answers with a surge of violet pollen that settles on the strap and burns away the last anesthetic fog, and I realize mercy is computed not to absolve the torturers but to release the tortured from carrying their weights, including me, and I start back toward dawn with a map in my skin.
