<story>When the sky is wrong, the stars hang like spilled salt and the moon rises in the west. [18]On such nights the icebound spire above the clouds moans, and its frozen stairs sing under every boot. [36]I climbed it anyway, because a chivalrous thief keeps promises even to people he plans to rob. [53]Master Serren had taught me wonder the way other men teach lockpicks, and he had called me his apprentice of wonder. [74]He also taught me to be sacredly playful, to bow before mystery and still dare to tickle it. [92]Now he lay somewhere inside the spire, imprisoned by the Skywrights, and I had come to amend my last failure. [112]In my pocket was the lid of his broken pocket sundial, warm as a pulse against my thumb. [130]He said the sundial measured not time but courage, and the lid would open only when I embraced the unknown with open arms. [153]At the spire gate, two sentries argued about whether the horizon had tilted again, and their fear made them careless. [173]I stepped from fog to torchlight, saluted, and offered a flask, letting chivalry distract while my fingers studied their keys. [193]Beyond them the spire was a cathedral of ice, with rooms carved into blue walls and a thin chapel where the wrong sky leaked through glass. [219]A chessboard stood in that chapel, its pieces hand carved from bone, and I knew the Skywrights used it as a cipher altar. [242]Serren had once shown me the trick: swap a piece and the board sings up a secret hidden in its hollow belly. [264]So I carried my own set, carved in the same style, each weighted with paper spirals inked in my master's cramped hand. [286]The plan was cautious abandon: play a holy game with liars, steal the truth, and leave without breaking a single promise. [307]I took the place of the absent priest, arranged the bone army, and waited until a Skywright in frost robes entered alone. [329]He thought me another initiate and asked what omen the westering moon meant, and I answered with a smile and a pawn to e4. [353]While he pondered, I slipped my carved bishop into the square he vacated, swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside as neatly as prayer beads. [378]The board clicked, a whisper rose from the ice, and letters formed in the frost: Serren is bound atop the spire, key in the sky. [403]My opponent shivered, sensing the breach, and reached for the alarm cord, but I caught his wrist and apologized for the inconvenience. [425]Chivalry demanded I spare him, so I knocked him gently cold with the flask and laid him facing the chapel door like a sleeping guard. [450]At the top platform the wind tore at my cloak, and the wrong sky churned, as if someone were repainting it with a wet brush. [475]Serren hung from ice chains beside the weather vane, smiling at my arrival as though this were a festival and not a sentence. [498]He nodded at the sundial lid in my hand, and I finally understood that the key in the sky was not a thing but a choice. [524]To amend what I had failed to do before, I opened my arms to the storm, let go of the railing, and trusted the unknown to catch me. [552]The pocket sundial lid snapped open, spilling a thin circle of light that steadied the sky long enough for me to swing into Serren's chains. [577]Ice cracked, the Skywrights shouted far below, and with sacredly playful laughter my master and I used the loosened links as chess knights use leaps. [602]We landed on a ledge where my remaining pieces waited in a satchel, and Serren pressed the carved queen into my palm, heavy with one last secret. [629]Inside was a map of uncharted airways, routes that existed only when the sky went wrong, and he asked if I was ready to steal tomorrow. [655]I looked back at the chapel windows glimmering like frozen eyes, then forward into blank cloud, and chose cautious abandon again, for that was our vow. [681]Together we stepped off the ledge, not falling but entering the map's first corridor, and the sundial lid warmed as the unknown opened its arms. [706]</story>
