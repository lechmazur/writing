<story>At the amber grotto at dusk, I set my case on a ledge that glowed like bottled honey and waited with the calm of someone paid to feel on behalf of others, for I was Mira Voss, a counterfeit emotion dealer whose manner stayed affectionate detachment even when the work turned intimate. [52] Inside the case lay vials of distilled smiles, rehearsed grief, and a single fragrance chemist's blotter petal, crisp as paper but thirsty for meaning, because I did my appraisals by sensing through static electricity as much as by scent or speech. [93] Tonight my client was Orin, a miner newly freed from the amber seams, who swore he felt nothing after the cave-in yet kept touching his chest as if checking a cracked compass, and I could hear the half truths in every denial. [135] I had learned to be professionally thorough, not from ethics but from survival, so before I offered him any manufactured comfort I ran my fingers an inch from his sleeves, letting tiny sparks map the salt of his skin and the tremor of his pulse. [180] Static made truth loud; it told me his numbness was a lid clamped over terror, and I wanted, absurdly for a woman who sold fakes, to fuse insight with empathy until my knowledge of him became something that could actually help. [221] Orin had come because the foreman claimed the grotto's resinous air could finish what the mine had started, a slow change in the lungs that turned dust to amber, and as the transformation completes he needed a feeling to carry him through the last breath. [266] He sat cross-legged on warm stone while the dusk outside bled violet through the cave mouth, and I held the blotter petal over the pool where amber seeped like syrup, letting it drink the fumes that would tint whatever emotion I pressed into it. [310] "Tell me what you remember," I said, gentle as a nurse and distant as a clerk, and he gave me a story in careful fragments, each one a half truth: the shout to run, the hand he did not grab, the silence afterward that he called peace. [357] As he spoke, I flicked my thumb along a wool cloth to charge it, then hovered the petal near his throat; the hairs on my arm lifted, and in that invisible crackle I sensed the unspoken sentence, that he had pushed his brother away to save himself. [404] I could have sold him a bright counterfeit absolution, but the grotto demanded honesty, so I let my own shame, long stored and unnamed, flow into the petal and subsume the sugary notes I usually used, creating a bitter courage that matched his guilt as the amber climbed his breath. [454] When he inhaled, the petal's scent rose like scorched orange peel, and the change finished inside him; his coughs turned to a clear exhale, his eyes filled, and for the first time his tears were not purchased but earned, because he finally saw what he had done and still felt human. [505] I took his payment anyway, coins slick with resin, not as a reward for deception but as a boundary, a reminder that my affection could not become possession, yet I also wrote his brother's name on the case lid so I would not let the moment shrink into another half truth I told myself about being untouchable. [562] Outside, the sky had gone the color of cooled embers, and the miners waiting by the path watched Orin walk as if he carried a lantern under his ribs; I felt the static fade from my fingertips, but the insight stayed, braided with a new tenderness, and I knew my best counterfeits were only training wheels for the day I could offer something real.
