<story>After I saw my own grave, I drove until the road stopped at the mountain ranger cabin, and the pines stood like witnesses with needles dull from old snow. [29]The headstone had my name and a date that had not happened yet, and since then time in my skull has been chronologically confused, sliding forward and back with every breath. [60]I am a lucid dream chronicler by trade, the kind who sells other peoples nocturnal revelations to daytime magazines, but now I needed my own record to distill chaos into narrative before it ate me. [95]Inside the cabin the ranger had left a potbelly stove, a bunk, and on the table a birch bark scroll tied with fishing line, as if the forest expected me to write on its skin. [130]I untied it and smelled sap and smoke, and my hands shook with feral nostalgia, the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it, teeth out, in the dark. [161]The scroll was blank except for faint grooves, as though a previous version of me had pressed stories into it and then fled, leaving only the muscle memory of sentences. [191]That night I lay on the bunk and willed myself into lucidity, because in dreams I can interrogate the future and the past at once, even when waking hours refuse to line up. [224]I found myself on the ridge above the cabin, moonlit and too sharp, and when I flexed my shoulders the air accepted me and I began to soar, not like a bird but like a page torn free. [262]Below, my graveyard appeared again, perched absurdly on a slope where no town existed, and I watched a younger me kneel at my stone, rubbing the letters as if he could erase them. [295]Jealousy came first, not of his youth but of his ignorance, and I realized my method for escaping panic was getting jealous of past selves, counting their unspent chances like coins. [326]I dove toward him, meaning to warn him, but the dream rewound and suddenly I was the younger one, kneeling, while my older self hovered above, stained with the same weary surprise. [358]In that swap I understood why my mind was chronologically confused: the grave had not predicted my death, it had punctured the calendar, and all my versions leaked into one another. [389]The air smelled of wet stone, and the nostalgia in me went feral again, chasing not childhood summers but the exact moment before I learned that endings could be scheduled. [419]My older self spoke without moving his mouth, saying, Write it down, or it will keep happening, and the sentence hit me with jaded wonder, like a miracle delivered by a clerk. [451]When I woke, dawn was bruised purple behind the window, and I sat at the table with the birch bark scroll, letting the grooves guide my pen as if I were tracing scars. [484]I wrote the ridge, the grave, the swap of bodies, and each line steadied the hours a little, because narrative is a fence you can build even in a landslide. [514]At noon I hiked to the actual cemetery down-valley, half expecting fresh dirt, and found only weathered stones, yet my jealousy returned anyway, directed at the people who got to stay dead in one piece. [549]Back at the cabin I forced a nap and went lucid again, this time soaring deliberately over the mountains until I saw threads of light connecting moments, a map that did not care about order. [584]I followed the brightest thread to the night of my first published dream column, where I watched myself grin at a cheap bar, and instead of envying him I thanked him for starting the habit of recording. [621]The gratitude broke the loop, and when the graveyard tried to rise beneath me I outflew it, returning to the cabin with a new calm that felt earned, not foretold. [651]On the last length of birch bark I distilled the whole mess into a simple ending: after seeing your own grave, you either become a rumor or an author, and I chose to keep writing until the dates behaved.
