<story>The floating rock dojo drifted above the ash colored sea, its stone mats held in place by braided gravity ropes, and every sunrise arrived with different constellations because history was rewriting itself hour by hour. [35] I had survived ego death in the first rewrite, when my name vanished from all records and even my mother looked through me, and the shock left me with a strange clarity that sliced through pretense the way a blade parts fog. [77] That clarity did not spare me from emotional numbness, though; it only showed me, without excuses, how I moved like a well trained puppet, so I came to the dojo to learn how to vivify what the rewrites had dulled. [117] Master Sora greeted me on the highest slab, where wind bells rang in two tones at once, and she taught that the antidote to numbness was not more sensation but complementary opposites, letting grief and gratitude balance, letting stillness and strike share one breath. [161] The lesson became urgent when the Custodians arrived, robed lawyers with combat staves, carrying an object wrapped in silk: a brain in a jar labeled duplicate, floating pale in preservative, and claiming it was the legal mind of my cloned self. [202] During the rewrites the city below had printed and reprinted my birth certificate, sometimes listing me as Original, sometimes as Copy, and now two factions fought a clone custody battle over who would control the body that matched that brain, because whichever version won would inherit my training and my memories. [253] The Custodians argued that the jar held my true continuity, the Dojo Council insisted that the living fighter on the mat was the person, and Master Sora asked me to stand between them, not as defendant but as witness, since my post ego death sight could cut through their rehearsed stories. [304] I listened while the wind shifted and the past shifted with it, and I saw the pretense in both sides: the Custodians wanted a controllable citizen, the Council wanted a symbol, and neither cared that my chest felt like an empty drum. [346] To prove personhood, they demanded a trial of technique on the dojo edge where the rock fell away into cloud, and they set my silent clone body opposite me, eyes vacant, ready to be animated if the jarred brain could be installed. [388] Master Sora whispered that I would not win by dominance, because dominance was just another mask, and she urged me to vivify the whole scene through complementary opposites, meeting their cold logic with warmth and their hunger for ownership with surrender. [429] I bowed to the clone body as if to an opponent and as if to a sibling, then opened the jar and placed my palm on the glass, letting my breath slow until I could feel both our pulses, mine in blood and his in stored fluid, two versions of one question. [481] As history flickered, I spoke the truth that my clarity demanded: neither of us was an original, we were both rewrites, and the only custody worth fighting for was custody of the moment, so I invited the Custodians and Council to step onto the mat and feel what numbness had stolen. [532] They refused at first, so I used the dojo art that slices through pretense, a paired motion of push and pull, where one hand protects and the other risks, and I guided their staves and signatures into the same circle, forcing them to breathe together until their eyes watered. [581] In that shared breath the clone body shuddered, not from a transplanted brain but from attention given without ownership, and I felt my own numbness crack as the living and the preserved, the law and the art, the past and the rewrite aligned, ending the custody battle with a new charter that named us co guardians of each other.
