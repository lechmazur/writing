<story>At midsummer the velvet observatory breathed heat like a dark fruit, and I, Liora Venn, provenance researcher for the Royal Archive, climbed its stairs with mulberry ache in my throat. [30] The empire had sent me to certify a relic for the Coronation Hall, yet my private motive was to weigh a dream against an empire before the promise loses its glow. [61] In the dome's hush, astronomers draped the walls in violet velvet to stop stray light, and the cloth made every footstep sound like an apology. [86] On a pedestal sat the transparent violin made of ice crystal, its body catching starlight and holding it, cold and patient, as if music could be frozen into proof. [115] My job was to trace who had owned it, which wars had traded it, and which signatures were forgeries, but the moment I touched the neck my mind filled with green murmurs. [147] I had become accidentally telepathic with plants a year ago after a laboratory pollen spill, and the observatory's potted figs and fern trays began telling me what the human witnesses would not. [179] They spoke in sensations rather than words, in thirst and sap-rise, and the strongest feeling was a warning: destiny here was perforated, full of little holes where choices leaked through. [209] The head astronomer, Master Sorell, offered me bitter coffee and watched my hands, because everyone knew researchers read lies in documents, and some of us read futures in stains. [238] I tipped the cup onto a saucer, let the grounds run, and by reading the future in coffee stains I saw a crown-shaped blot split by a thin white gap, a coronation with a missing note. [274] The violin was meant to be played that night under the open slit of the dome, and the emperor's envoy expected me to stamp its provenance and seal the performance as state myth. [306] But the figs in their tubs pulsed terror into my skull, showing me an image of roots burned black, and I understood that once the music proved the empire's right, the orchards beyond the city would be cut for cannonwood. [346] My dream, the one I had carried since childhood, was smaller than policy: that living things could be allowed to propagate without permission, that a song could belong to whoever needed it. [378] Sorell led me to the instrument's case, lined with frost-silk, and confessed the violin had no maker's mark because it had formed naturally in a glacier cave, sung into shape by wind. [410] That origin made it impossible to own, yet empires do not like impossibility, so they had invented a lineage and demanded I affirm it. [434] In the fern house below the dome, I knelt among pots and listened harder, and the plants gave me a map of hidden vents, places where cold air rose like secret breath. [466] Their message was clear: move the violin through the vent shaft to the garden terraces, where the midsummer festival crowds would hide me, and let the relic vanish into ordinary hands. [497] I returned to the saucer and found new stains blooming as the coffee dried, and in them I read a second future: Sorell standing alone, taking blame, while the dome filled with soldiers. [530] Perforated destiny meant I could shift the scene, but only by accepting that some holes would be punched through my own life. [552] When the envoy arrived with his seal ring and a parchment of invented ancestors, I told him the truth in careful bureaucratic language, and watched his smile curdle into threat. [582] While he argued, I opened the dome's service hatch that the figs had shown me, slid the ice-crystal violin into its case, and sent it down the vent on a rope of velvet cords. [616] In the terrace garden, children were cutting basil to root in water, and I asked them to carry the case between pots, as if it were just another cutting to propagate from one courtyard to the next. [653] The basil laughed in my mind, sharp and sweet, and promised to keep quiet, and that small, green loyalty steadied me more than any oath to a flag. [681] Back in the observatory, I left my official report blank except for one line: provenance indeterminate, therefore unfit for imperial consecration, and I signed it before the promise loses its glow. [712] Later, among festival lanterns, I heard a thin melody from somewhere in the alleys, not grand enough for a throne, but bright as sap, and I knew the empire would never plug all the holes.
