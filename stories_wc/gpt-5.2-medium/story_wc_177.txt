<story>When the storm approaches, the rewilded forest holds its breath, and I follow a path that feels older than my feet. [21]They call me Foresight Hindsight Only, because I see the next step and the last one, but never the whole map. [42]That limitation keeps me precisely playful, testing each fork like a joke with a blade hidden in the punchline. [61]I have come to the vine-draped bunker, buried under nettles and kudzu, because my interpreted dreams insisted the answer waits behind its sealed door. [85]In those dreams, a woman made of ash whispered, "Discover why some paths choose their walkers," and her words stuck like grit in my teeth. [110]The bunker was once a command post, and the directive painted on its walls is decaying now, flaking into symbols that change each time lightning blinks. [136]A rusted slot beside the hatch accepts only one object: a wafer seal stamped with a spiral, soft as communion and hard as law. [160]I found the seal in a crow's nest of branches after a dream showed the bird dropping it at my boots, so I press it into the slot and listen. [190]The wafer dissolves with a sweet, dusty scent, and the hatch sighs open as if it remembers being ordered to obey. [211]Inside, the air tastes of wet concrete and old batteries, yet vines have pushed through cracks, knotting around consoles like green fingers refusing surrender. [235]My flashlight finds a terminal still blinking, and a message scrolls in fragments: DIRECTIVE CONTINUES UNTIL PATH SELECTS WALKER, then the letters smear into mold. [260]I try to read the rest, but the directive is literally rotting, eaten by damp and by the forest's patient will, and my own memories wobble with it. [288]A crack of thunder above turns the bunker ceiling into a drum, and I realize the storm is not only weather but a deadline for whatever this place was built to do. [320]I lie down on the cold floor between roots and wires, close my eyes, and let the bunker transmit its old routines into my sleep, because dreams are the only language left here. [353]Through interpreted dreams, I walk corridors that are both hallway and river, and each door I open becomes a forked trail where the branches lean toward me like judges. [382]The ash woman returns, precisely playful in her cruelty, and tosses me a question like a coin: "Do you think you choose, or are you chosen by the choosing?" [411]I answer with the only tool I have, foresight and hindsight without the present, and I see that the directive was meant to train walkers until one could transcend the bunker and carry its decisions into the living forest. [450]But the forest learned faster than the generals, and as the directive decayed, the paths began selecting people the way roots select water, pulling those who would listen to dreams. [480]I wake with rain seeping through the cracks and lightning strobing the vines, and I understand my motivation was never curiosity alone but the need to be worthy of being chosen. [511]On the terminal, a final prompt appears, asking for the seal again, so I bite my thumb, smear blood on the remaining wafer dust, and press my print to the spiral. [542]The screen floods with a map made of heartbeat lines, and the bunker offers me the last intact order: WALK UNTIL THE WALKING WALKS YOU. [567]Outside, wind combs the canopy, and I step out as the hatch closes behind me, not locking but letting go, as if my leaving completes its purpose. [594]The path in front of me is new, pressed into wet leaf-mold, yet my feet know it, and in the storm's first hard sheets I feel the forest taking my weight like a handshake. [628]I do not command or surrender; I transcend, through the same interpreted dreams that once chased me, until foresight and hindsight meet in a present shaped by whatever chooses to walk with me.
