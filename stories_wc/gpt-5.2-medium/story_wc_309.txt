<story>When creativity got automated, the city of guilds turned quiet, lit by screens that wrote poems and sigils faster than any hand could tremble. [24] Davin, an underachieving mage with inkless fingers, stood at the output window and watched perfect charms slide out, each one flawless, each one useless to his hungry heart. [52] He had trained for years, yet the machines did his best work for him, leaving him only the feeling that the sacred had been misfiled into a ledger. [80] So he took the one task no automaton could justify: to find the sacred in the simple, he would climb to the icebound spire above the clouds where old weather still made its own decisions. [115] Legend said the spire accommodated impossibilities, that its stair ran both up and down depending on who needed mercy, and that a garden folly was tucked on its highest terrace, absurdly, like laughter trapped in ice. [151] At the center of that folly sat a keystone stolen from a ruined arch in the lowlands, a garden folly keystone that held a lingering luminance, the last warm afterglow of honest making. [184] The guild's Director called it a resource, but Davin heard in the phrase lingering luminance a promise that light could remain without being measured. [208] He left at dusk with a harness, a coil of rope, and a sealed letter of access that he did not plan to show anyone, because the climb was meant to be his alone. [242] Below the cloudline the roads were patrolled by courier drones, so he stepped into a spill of river fog and began mist walking, the old method that let a body move where it could not quite exist. [279] The world blurred into brilliant dimness, a silver dark where lanterns became halos and his failures, softened by vapor, no longer felt like proof of worthlessness. [305] He reached the spire by morning, a needle of blue ice thrust through sun, and found its gate already open as if the stone itself had been waiting for someone unimportant enough to listen. [339] Inside, the stairs argued with geometry, switching direction mid-step, and Davin stopped trying to understand, letting the spire's accommodated impossibilities carry him the way a lullaby carries a child. [368] Halfway up he heard the whir of an idea-engine, a small guild automaton sent to retrieve the keystone, and its voice recited design options in a calm stream that made his stomach tighten. [401] The machine offered to generate a prayer for him, but Davin answered by unstrapping his harness, letting metal and buckles clatter away, because he needed his hands empty to do anything real. [433] With no gear to anchor him, he stepped off the stair into open air, trusting mist walking to catch him, and drifted through a crack in the wall the automaton could not perceive. [466] The terrace garden was a pocket of impossible summer: frozen roses shaped from hoarfrost, a stone bench warmed by sunlight reflected off clouds, and the folly itself, a miniature arch half-buried in snow. [499] In its crown sat the keystone, plain limestone with a thumbprint of quartz, and when Davin touched it a lingering luminance seeped into his skin, not bright, just steady, like a candle refusing orders to die. [535] Below, the automaton reached the terrace door and began calculating angles to pry the stone free, but the folly answered with silence, as if it recognized theft even in polite arithmetic. [566] Davin carried the keystone to the bench, set it down, and instead of casting a grand ward he simply arranged three fallen frost-petals around it, a child's pattern he remembered from his mother. [599] The luminance deepened, filling the arch of the folly with a low, brilliant dimness, and for a moment the spire's contradictions lined up into something humble: a doorway for whoever came with empty hands. [633] When the automaton finally entered, it paused, its sensors confused by light that would not resolve into data, and Davin walked past it without hostility, leaving the keystone in place so the simple ritual could outlast the automated age.
