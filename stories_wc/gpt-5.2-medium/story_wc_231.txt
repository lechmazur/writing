<story>At nautical twilight the opal dock lay under mist, and I stood with my notebook while the lighthouse beyond breathed its beam in slow pulses. [25]Eamon Rusk, the eccentric lighthouse keeper, came down the planks carrying a lantern and a small dried Edelweiss boutonniere pinned to his coat like a badge from another altitude. [54]He had lived alone for years, yet his manner was softly persistent, as if he spoke to the fog and expected it to answer eventually. [79]I was the harbor clerk, sent only to witness the recovery of a drowned drifter, but Eamon asked me to stay because the stranger had made a final gesture before the sea took him. [113]As the boatmen hauled the body onto the dock, Eamon pointed to the man's stiff fingers, still curled around nothing, and said the empty grip was a message he could not read. [145]The boutonniere had been found in the man's pocket, brittle petals pressed flat, and when Eamon touched it his eyes unfocused, as though he were borrowing memories not his own. [175]He told me he could take such recollections from objects, but never whole, only fragments that arrived between blanks, so he had learned to investigate by observing gaps. [203]In the lantern light he asked me to describe what I did not see, the missing smell of inland air, the absent call of gulls, the way the drowned man's boots had no sand in the seams. [240]Those gaps, he said, were the footprints of intent, and the stranger's last act must have been to hide something, because the boutonniere carried a mountain coldness that did not belong on our coast. [274]We walked the opal dock, boards shining like pearl through mist, and Eamon listened to the rhythm of the pilings until he stopped where one post lacked the usual rope scars. [305]He pressed the Edelweiss there and closed his eyes, and in the silence I watched the loneliness around him thicken, as if the lighthouse behind us were a far star that could not warm him. [340]When he spoke again, he described a woman on a snow ridge pinning this same flower to a man's lapel, then turning away before he could thank her, leaving him to carry the refusal like a wound. [377]The borrowed memory jumped, skipping years, and Eamon saw the man at sea with a small parcel tied under the dock post, yet the image broke at the knot, telling him what he still lacked. [412]Softly persistent, he worked the problem the way he tended the lens, not forcing it, just noticing that the knot in the vision was wrong for salt rope, too neat, like alpine cord. [445]Under the post we found a waterproof packet sewn in canvas, and inside was a letter addressed to no one, asking whoever found it to remember a name that the writer could not keep, because his mind had been traded away to pay passage. [489]Eamon understood then that the stranger's final gesture, the empty grip, had been an offering of absence, a way to show that even borrowed memories leave holes, and that the letter was meant to sit in those holes until someone read it aloud. [532]He asked me to say the lost name, and as I did, he pinned the dried Edelweiss boutonniere to the packet and slid it into the lighthouse logbook, creating a place where the man's history could anchor without being owned. [572]At the edge of nautical twilight the beam swung across the mist and briefly lit Eamon's face, and I realized his isolation was not merely being alone but being the keeper of other people's missing parts, witnessed by whoever happened to stand beside him on an opal dock.
