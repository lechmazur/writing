<story>After the last ship sailed and the harbor chains clinked shut, I walked inland with my notebook, a traveler hired to write obituaries for the living. [26]The city behind me still smelled of salt and coal smoke, but ahead the palace hill rose like a dark lantern, its windows dimmed for the season of departures. [55]My work was to describe, in vividly descriptive lines, what had already left a person before the body did, and to give those absences names that could be carried without shame. [86]In the shadowed garden in autumn, where the palace kept its last roses under black netting, the steward led me to a bench wet with leaf decay and sorrowful perfume. [116]He said the queen would not meet me, because she was present only by rumor now, and rumor does not hold a pen. [139]What she needed, he whispered, was an explained absence: the kind that turns a missing son into a map rather than a wound. [162]To make such maps I used a method the guild called projecting presence, standing close enough to someone to borrow their breath and then shaping that breath into the outline of who was gone. [196]The steward brought me the object that would anchor the projection, a single weft thread pulled from the palace carpet, red as a cut lip and soft as hair. [225]He handled it as if it were a relic, because that carpet had carried the boy's footsteps to the docks on the morning he boarded the last ship. [253]When I wrapped the thread around my finger, I felt the palace itself tighten, a loom remembering the tension of weaving grief into pattern. [277]At dusk the queen finally came, not in crowns but in a plain shawl, and she sat so near that my sleeve brushed her wrist, an intimate contact permitted only because we both needed it. [312]Her eyes were bright with lonesome splendor, like wet stones under moonlight, and she asked me to write her son dead without killing him. [336]I opened my notebook and described the garden first, the crooked pear tree shedding copper leaves, the hedges swallowing their own shadows, the river beyond running black and patient. [365]Then I asked her to speak one true detail about him, something the sea could not wash away. [383]She said he used to kneel beside gardeners and press his ear to the soil to hear where water wanted to go, and that he believed healing was a geography, not a miracle. [416]I tied the carpet thread between my hands like a tiny bridge and, by projecting presence, I let her borrowed breath cross it until the air beside us took on his height. [448]The queen did not see a ghost; she felt a warmth at her shoulder and heard, inside her own chest, the boy's habit of humming when he was afraid. [477]I watched her fingers curl toward that warmth, and I kept my voice low, guiding the projection gently so the absence would be explained instead of reopened. [504]In the obituary I wrote that he had left not because she failed him, but because the sea had offered him a corridor to places where broken sailors learn to forgive themselves. [536]I described his life as continuing elsewhere, and I placed his absence on the map she already carried, between the garden gate and the far horizon, so she could walk around it. [568]When I read the lines aloud, the queen leaned into me as if my ribs were a railing, and the intimate weight of her grief made my breath stutter. [597]For a moment I projected my own presence too, letting her feel that she was not alone in the garden's long twilight, that another human body could stay. [625]Afterward she asked what I sought in such work, and I told her I traveled to understand the geography of healing, the routes by which people return to themselves after the last ship sails. [659]She placed the red thread in my palm, a payment and a compass, and as I left the shadowed autumn garden I felt its softness mark my skin, a reminder that every departure can be woven into meaning.
