<story>The orchard clings to the cliff like a stitched-on shadow, all knotted branches and wind-bitten fruit. [16]I am its reluctant caretaker, bound by a curse that punishes touch with splinters under the skin and names in the mouth. [38]So I tend the trees by leaving impressions without touching, pressing my palms close enough for frostless air to bruise bark into new growth. [62]Below the orchard, the cliffside labyrinth yawns, a maze of slate corridors cut into the rock and patrolled by mechanical birds. [83]Their brass wings click in the dusk and their glass eyes sweep for warmth, because the Duke who built them hated trespass and hated getting lost. [109]Now travelers still stumble in from the coast road, thinking the labyrinth is a shortcut, and I cannot ignore them even when I want to. [134]Before the night frost forms, I try to guide the lost to safety, because the frost turns the corridors into mirrors and the birds into knives. [160]Tonight three figures arrive, soaked and shaking, and the smallest one holds up a lantern like an apology. [178]I ask their names and their destination, and I note, offhandedly exact, that they have forty-seven minutes until the first rim of ice. [201]They stare at me as if precision is cruelty, but it is the only kindness I have learned in this place. [222]The eldest, Mara, says a child wandered ahead chasing a bird-song, and the metal flock has herded him deeper. [241]I should refuse, because every rescue tightens the curse, yet my orchard was planted to mark safe paths, not graves. [261]In the hollow of my coat I carry a small nut, dark as riverstone, the last from the oldest tree that remembers the Duke. [285]It is not food; it is a key, because the orchard and the labyrinth share roots of design. [303]Years ago, while pruning by near-touch, I found a forgotten blueprint folded inside a rusted survey pipe at the cliff edge. [324]The ink showed an assembly of waystones and wind-fins meant to sing directions through the maze, a system never completed after the Duke died. [348]I memorized its measurements like prayers, not because I love the Duke, but because travelers deserve better than his traps. [368]The blueprint calls for a seed-nut to start the first waystone, and my nut has waited for a night like this. [389]We hurry into the labyrinth, my lantern hooded, the travelers stepping where I point, while the birds clatter overhead in graceless beauty. [411]At the first junction I kneel without kneeling, lowering myself until my breath stains the stone and leaves an impression of a circle. [434]Mara flinches when I do not touch, but the mark deepens anyway, as if the rock wants instruction. [452]Using the blueprint in my head, I assemble the first waystone from loose slabs, nudging them with the pressure of my shadow and the nut's pull. [478]When I set the nut into the hollow without fingers, it clicks like a jaw, and a thin note rises, pointing left. [500]The mechanical birds spiral down, confused by the song, and for a moment their patrol pattern breaks into something almost like curiosity. [522]We follow the note through narrow slots where the sea shows between stones, and I count turns aloud, offhandedly exact: seven right, two down, one back. [548]In a pit of fallen gears we find the child, pinned under a bird with a bent wing, and his tears steam in the cold air. [574]I cannot lift the bird by hand, so I leave an impression on its breastplate, a dent shaped like mercy, and the mechanism releases. [598]As we climb out, the first frost threads the corners, but the waystone's song leads us to my orchard gate, where the trees bow, still cursed, still sheltering. [626]The travelers huddle among the trunks while I listen to the labyrinth behind us settle, its birds returning to their routes with a sound like reluctant applause. [653]Mara asks why I stay here alone, and I answer, too plainly, that someone must keep the curse facing outward instead of inward. [676]The forgotten blueprint was meant for a Duke's convenience, but tonight it becomes a map of ethics, and I decide to finish the remaining waystones. [701]If my hands cannot touch, they can still shape, and each impression I leave will be a sign for the next lost soul before frost writes over everything. [729]In the morning, when the nut's note has gone quiet inside the stone, the orchard will look the same, but the path through the labyrinth will not. [756]</story>
