<story>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds held its leaves like black glass, and in its highest fork I kept watch for the air lanes that only moonlight revealed. [28]They called me the midnight pattern seeker, because I could read the drifting constellations of lanterns and wing lights and tell which pilot was nervous, which was lying, and which was about to fall silent. [63]It was an attentively inventive job, all fingers and listening, but it came with the watcher's burden: if I misread a single cadence, the city below would blame the flyers, and the flyers would stop trusting each other. [101]Tonight the trust was already under pressure, because a supply drop to the sick wards depended on a chain of strangers, and rumors said one of them had been swapping cargo midair. [133]My only link to the chain was a weathered radio and the cold metal parachute buckle I wore on my wrist, a habit from my own jumping days when fear could only be managed by touching something that would not lie. [174]The radio hissed until the sky itself seemed frayed, and then, after the radio static clears, a voice arrived like a stone dropped into a deep well, leaving a soundless echo inside my skull. [208]Courier Nine reported a crosswind and asked for my landing revision, but the way he paused before saying his call sign did not match the pattern I had memorized for weeks. [239]I wanted to accuse him, yet my duty was to preserve trust under pressure, which meant I had to be precise enough that even the guilty could not claim I guessed. [270]So I closed my eyes and let remembering through muscle memory do the work, sliding my thumb along the parachute buckle the way I used to check a harness, counting the tiny nicks that marked the true sequence of his transmissions. [311]Each nick corresponded to a turn of phrase and a breath length, and my hands told me that the man on the line was wearing Courier Nine's voice like borrowed gloves. [342]I revised the landing coordinates with a calm that felt false, sending him toward the southern crown of the arbor where the branches were thin and the wind would force him to slow, and at the same time I keyed a private ping to the real Nine. [389]Minutes later, two parachutes blossomed pale against the dark, one angling for my trap and one holding steady above it, and I could hear nothing but my own breathing, the hush making every movement feel like an oath. [427]When the first jumper hit the branch netting and tangled, I climbed down the slick trunk, snapped the buckle free from my wrist, and used it as a quick lock to cinch his lines before he could cut loose and vanish into cloud. [470]Up close his mask smelled of machine oil, and under it he was a dock clerk from below, eyes wide with the shock of being seen, while the real Courier Nine landed beside us and stared at my buckle as if it were a badge and a warning. [518]I could have let the clerk fall and kept my hands clean, but the watcher's burden is not to punish, it is to keep the web from tearing, so I spoke the truth into the radio, revised the whole route publicly, and watched Nine's shoulders loosen as trust returned. [567]After they flew on with the medicine and the clerk was bound for judgment, I stayed in the high fork until dawn, rubbing the buckle back onto my wrist, rehearsing the pauses and breaths I had caught, because tomorrow another voice would rise out of cleared static, and I would have to listen again, alone, in the arbor's silence that repeated every choice as a soundless echo.
