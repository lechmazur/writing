<story>At the turning of the tide's thought, when the sea wind paused as if listening to itself, the treetop village of Larkroot hovered in its nets of rope and living branches, and every leaf held a wildflower hush. [38]
Jun Mora, an ambitious herbalist from the mudflat towns below, climbed the spiral ladders with satchels of dried mint and fever bark, and with a nose so olfactorily sensitive that even distant rain had a signature. [74]
She came to trade remedies, but also to journalize her days, because her family said memory rots unless aired, and their custom was to save the wrapping paper from parcels and doodle on its interior, where the bright outside could not brag. [116]
Those secret sketches of roots and tides steadied her, and she had begun to believe that the undercurrent of wisdom was not in grand sayings, but in small repeated motions that kept the heart calm while the world shifted. [155]
In Larkroot she sought a single thing: a corpse flower seed, rumored to sleep in the canopy gardens and, when raised with care, to make a medicine that could teach the body serenity within motion, even during pain or grief. [195]
The village wardens laughed at the request, not because it was absurd, but because the seed was a relic bound to the village's safety, and strangers had arrived before with greed masked as scholarship, leaving broken boughs and poisoned wells. [235]
Jun did not argue; she listened, and her sensitive nose caught a thread beneath their words, a faint sulfur and honey tang that drifted from somewhere higher, like a warning bell made of scent rather than sound. [272]
That night she wrapped her trade goods in paper, turned the pieces inside out, and doodled the wardens' faces, the rope bridges, and little spirals that meant odor currents, until the map in her lap showed a path toward the forbidden gardens. [314]
She followed it at dawn, moving with the treetops' sway instead of fighting it, and found an old scentkeeper named Etsu pruning orchids; he did not stop her, only asked why she wanted a flower famous for stench. [352]
Jun answered with her journal, opening pages of wrapping paper where generations of Mora hands had drawn storms settling into still water, and she told him she was tired of healing frantic bodies and wanted to brew a quiet that could travel. [394]
Etsu said the seed was kept for a different reason, because the corpse flower's bloom summoned carrion moths that carried spores away from Larkroot, and without that ugly ceremony the canopy would choke with rot; wisdom, he said, ran like an undercurrent, doing its work unseen. [440]
To test her, he invited her to stand watch during the next bloom, timed to the village calendar by moon and tide, and to write what she learned without stealing anything, especially not at the turning of the tide's thought when the petals would open. [485]
When the hour came, the bud unfurled in the lantern light, and the smell hit Jun like a wave of graves and ripe pears; her knees wanted to buckle, but she breathed through it, matching her inhale to the branch's swing, and journalized every sensation in tight lines and soft doodles. [536]
In the reek she noticed another thread, clean as crushed fern, and saw that the moths followed it to a knot in the roots where a fallen bird lay; she realized the village used decay as a compass, and serenity was not the absence of motion but a way to ride it. [588]
After the bloom, Etsu led her to the compost shrine and, with the wardens watching, pressed one corpse flower seed into her palm on the condition she plant it in the mudflats and send back paper pages of her observations, so the undercurrent of wisdom would keep flowing between roots and people. [640]
Jun descended with the village swaying above her and the sea moving below, and as she wrapped the seed for the journey she turned the paper inward, drew a slow spiral that meant both stink and grace, and felt, in that wildflower hush, her ambition settle into service. [688]</story>
