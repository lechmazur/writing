<story>After the town goes silent, Haru closes his shop without turning the sign, because no one remains to read it. [20]  
He is a gilded-leaf stationer, trained to press thin sheets of gold into margins, and his hands still smell of paste and cedar shavings. [44]  
In the back room he keeps a battered notepad whose cover has softened like old leather, and every page holds a grid of tiny notes about hours. [71]  
He writes them in a precise hand, earnestly studious even when no teacher watches, because he wants to collect the textures of different times before they fade. [98]  
Silence arrived gradually, first in the evening markets and then in the municipal loudspeakers, until the only steady voice was the fluorescent lamp above his counter. [124]  
On the night the last train stopped, he understood that official history would stall too, and that empty days could be mistaken for nothing at all. [150]  
He let himself mourn with incandescent restraint, letting the gold leaf shine while his voice stayed low. [167]  
So he began his method: by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn, he could measure small deviations that his ear felt but his eyes could not see. [198]  
He drew the hum as lines that rose and sank, and each pattern would refract his memory into separate colors, as if minutes had prisms hidden inside them. [226]  
Those colors became invented histories, not lies but careful reconstructions of how the town might have sounded if it had kept speaking. [248]  
He made a baker rise before sunrise again, a child recite poems in the alley, a councilman admit regret, and he wrote each scene beside the humming curve that summoned it. [279]  
Yet the lamp alone gave only indoor time, polished and thin, and he longed for rougher grains, for ages that smelled of sap and wind. [304]  
At the edge of town a stair of stone climbed toward the mountaintop where the old horticulturist had built a blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests, and Haru carried his notepad there under the mute stars. [339]  
He expected the garden to be dead without gardeners, but lantern moss still glowed on miniature trunks, and the clipped branches held blossoms as if hoarding spring. [366]  
Paths twisted between knee-high pines and maples, and the air felt layered, like pages pressed together, so that each turn seemed to open onto a different century. [393]  
In the center stood a maintenance shed with a single working bulb, and he waited there until the first gray of morning, listening for the hum to return. [421]  
At dawn he charted it again, by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn as he always did, but now the sound mixed with leaf-rustle and distant river. [452]  
The combined rhythm refracted more fiercely, and he saw in his mind a procession of small hands pruning, a fire on the ridge, and soldiers folding maps the size of doors. [483]  
He knew none of it had happened here, not exactly, yet the bonsai made a scale where imagination could be tested, and the lamp's hum gave a metronome to keep him honest. [515]  
Each invented history had to match a texture he could touch: brittle needles for war years, wet soil for seasons of plenty, petals that bruised for brief romances. [543]  
As he walked the labyrinth he placed slips of gilded paper at crossings, a stationer's version of breadcrumbs, and the gold caught the early light without shouting. [570]  
By midday he reached a bonsai oak split by lightning long ago, and in its scar he felt the town's silence not as loss but as a pause waiting to be scored. [602]  
He sat, opened the battered notepad to a blank page, and wrote a final history in which the people returned quietly, reading one another's faces the way he read humming lines. [633]  
When dusk came he folded the notepad into his coat and descended, carrying with him not predictions but cataloged sensations, so that even if the streets stayed mute he could still name their time. [667]
