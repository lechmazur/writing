<story>After the Happiness Mandate ended, the valley learned a new kind of quiet, one that did not demand smiles, and my farmhouse sat under the rotating shadows of giant wind turbines. [31] I kept the windows shut, not for warmth but to muffle the blades, because my sister Lena died the week the inspectors stopped knocking, and the air in the rooms still carried her last laugh like a bruise. [69] On the kitchen table, a dried flower bouquet from her hospital bedside shed papery petals into my palm whenever I touched it, and I touched it too often, trying to feel anything other than the emotional void. [106] The therapist assigned by the old mandate had called grief an error, but grief stayed, so I posted a notice at the co op for a performer who could teach me to cultivate lightness in grief without lying about it. [146] He arrived at dusk, a blank faced performer with a suitcase of knives and scraps, and he introduced himself as Orin, bowing to the turbines as if they were an audience that paid in wind. [181] His smile never found his eyes, yet his voice came rich and theatrical, and he asked permission to narrate my evening chores as though they were heroic deeds, because ordinary action was the only script that did not collapse. [220] While I filled the kettle, he announced, "Behold the summoning of water from the deep well," and while I peeled potatoes, he described each peel curling away as a bad memory leaving the body. [254] It should have been absurd, but the rhythm of his words shaped a remade hush, a silence rebuilt around sound rather than against it, and for a minute I heard the turbines as distant surf instead of machinery. [292] After dinner he sat by the stove and began to whittle a block of cedar, turning it slowly, making shavings like pale ribbons, and he narrated the cut of the blade with solemn grandeur. [326] He carved a small bird, then set it beside Lena's dried bouquet, and I noticed his hands were steady in a way that suggested practice with sharper work than art. [356] When I asked where he learned, his blank face stayed still, and he admitted he had once toured as a morale artist for the mandate, performing forced joy while quietly reporting households that did not clap. [392] The confession landed without drama, like a stone into snow, and I understood his moral ambiguity as both stain and tool, because he knew how to steer feeling even when feeling was unwanted. [425] I should have sent him away, yet I kept thinking of Lena gasping under fluorescent lights while a mandated comedian cracked jokes in the corridor, and I wanted to reclaim that moment from cruelty. [459] Orin proposed a ritual: we would do the smallest tasks with grand attention until the body believed, again, that it was allowed to be gentle, and then we would place the bouquet somewhere it could fade in peace. [497] In the morning he marched me to the barn and narrated the milking of my lone goat as a treaty between species, and the goat, unpersuaded, kicked the pail and splattered us both. [530] For the first time in months a short sound escaped me that might have been laughter, and Orin bowed as if the spill were the climax of a tragedy that ended in forgiveness. [563] That night, over the whittling, he told me he had come because he still dreamed of doors he helped seal, and he hoped that if he could make one household lighter, the weight might shift. [598] I carried the dried bouquet outside to the field where turbine shadows crossed like slow clock hands, and Orin followed, narrating each step as a pilgrimage toward a grave that had no stone. [631] At the fence line we wedged the bouquet into the crook of an old post, beside the cedar bird, and the wind worried the petals until they broke free and rode upward into the blade wash. [667] I watched them scatter with no surge of comfort, only the remade hush settling in my chest, and I understood that lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move, even through an emotional void.
