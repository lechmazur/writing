<story>During the lull of distant thunder, the salt flat looked like a sheet of broken glass, and Inez Marrow walked alone across it, her white coat flapping like a flag that had forgotten its nation. [35]  
People called her an amoral philanthropist because her donations rebuilt schools and hospitals while her companies quietly bought aquifers, leased clouds, and sold the water back, one desperate tanker at a time. [67]  
The drought that emptied this basin was not an accident of weather but a manufactured drought, engineered by her meteorologists to keep rain skirting the range until the riverbeds around the flat dried into readable scars. [103]  
She told the board it was research, but in the privacy of her glove she carried an extinct bird's egg, pale as old bone, and her throat tightened with a feeling she never let her lawyers see. [140]  
Secretly sentimental, she had paid smugglers and scientists alike to salvage what could not be revived: the echo of extinct birds, the thin music that once braided sea wind and cliff into meaning. [173]  
The egg belonged to the storm-petrel of Kandar, wiped out when her first dam drowned their nesting island, and she had kept the shell intact, hollowed and fitted with a wafer that held the last field recordings. [210]  
To play them where they would matter, she needed the place the birds had once crossed, and the only guide left was a map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds, branching and rejoining as if the earth remembered flight paths. [250]  
She had ordered the drought so those cracks would sharpen, because when water lingered the pattern blurred, and she could not bear the thought of losing even this crude geometry of absence. [282]  
In the radio earpiece her security chief asked for coordinates, but she snapped the channel off; tonight the flat was a chapel, and her power depended on no one witnessing the wrong kind of tenderness. [317]  
She followed the fissures with slow feet, counting angles, letting the salt cut her soles, until the lines converged toward a dark oval where the ground had once been a pool before her pumps drank it dry. [354]  
Thunder rolled far away, then paused, and in that pause she heard, or imagined she heard, wingbeats clicking through the empty air like the sound of needles on an old record. [385]  
At the oval's center stood a rusted survey stake from the dam project, and she knelt beside it, pressing the egg to her ear, as if the shell could confess what she had done and still forgive her. [423]  
Her philanthropy had always been arithmetic--break a river here, build a clinic there--yet the egg was not a ledger, and the small weight in her palm made the world feel briefly unbuyable. [455]  
She set the egg on the stake's flattened top, flipped a hidden switch with her thumbnail, and waited for the recording to wake, for the petrels' chorus to rise and braid itself with the coming storm. [491]  
But the device did not play, because the wafer inside had cracked in transit, and all she got was a faint hiss, a ruined promise, the kind of silence she had manufactured everywhere else. [525]  
Something in her chest broke with it, and she did the only honest thing left: she lifted the egg high above the salt, whispered the birds' name like a prayer, and let it fall to release whatever echo remained. [564]  
The shell shattered with a soft snap, scattering ivory shards that the wind began to carry along the crack-map's lines, and for a breath the hiss turned into a note, not recovered sound but a remembered one, inside her. [603]  
She rose, wiped her hands, and walked back across the salt flat before the thunder resumed, knowing the drought would end when she allowed it, but also knowing that no amount of rain would wash clean the grace she had broken and the grace she still chose. [650]</story>
