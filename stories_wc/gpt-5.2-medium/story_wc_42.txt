<story>Above the clouds, the Lunar Observatory of Selene Peak glowed with frost light, and the domes breathed slow vapor as if the mountain itself were thinking. [26] Mara Quill, a sage camera repairer, lived in its service corridor, surrounded by dismantled shutters and brass lenses, because she trusted images more than promises. [51] She had come to harness the ephemeral, the brief silver flares that bloom on the Moon during micrometeor strikes, and to bottle them on film before they vanish into ordinary night. [82] Tonight the foundations shake, not from weather, but from the deep fault under the ridge, and every tremor runs through the pier where the main telescope stands. [109] In the control room the observatory clock, a captain of schedules, had a clock hand that would not stop spinning, skittering around the dial like a trapped comet. [137] The hand fed the drive motors, and the drive motors fed the hand, and the loop made the tracking software stumble whenever the earth shuddered. [162] Without stable tracking, the new high speed camera could not lock onto the micrometeor flashes, and the window for the biggest swarm of the decade was closing toward dawn. [191] Mara laid her palm on the clock case and felt its vibration through wood, a frantic pulse against her own, and she thought of her father teaching her that some things must be changelessly constant. [226] A camera, he said, is only honest when its timing is honest, and timing is only honest when it refuses to be bullied by noise. [251] The quake noise was everywhere now, a low groan in the concrete, and the digital sensors jittered, so she reached for an older method, one she used when she repaired field cameras in forests. [285] She opened a drawer and took a pressed aspen leaf, sealed it in a clear cylinder, and dropped it from the top, listening for the sound of a leaf falling onto the felt pad below. [320] Each fall made a soft tick that the earthquake could not imitate, and by that tick she could count seconds that stayed true even as the building swayed. [348] She clamped a microphone to the cylinder, routed it into the clockwork bay, and began to restructure the feedback loop, replacing the runaway hand with a governor keyed to leaf ticks. [379] As she worked, the observatory creaked, and the dome slit revealed the Moon, bright as a scar, while thin cloud seas rolled far below like silent surf. [406] Her hands knew gears the way others knew prayers, and in the luminous ache of the shaking night she remembered the last image she had repaired for Lio, the pilot who never returned from a test launch. [443] The station had been built to fling tiny instrument pods from the peak with electromagnetic rails, not to reach orbit directly, but to steal height and speed until the upper stage could hunt escape velocity. [478] If her camera pod caught the micrometeor swarm at the edge of atmosphere and transmitted the frames upward, the science team could map impacts in real time, something as fleeting as sparks turned into data. [513] But the launch timer depended on the observatory clock, and the spinning hand had already ruined two windows, and the quake was worsening, threatening to misalign the rails forever. [542] When the next jolt hit, a crack ran along the floor seam, and Mara braced herself against the console, keeping her ear on the leaf cylinder until the tick returned, calm and punctual. [575] She tightened the last screw, watched the clock hand slow, hesitate, and finally point like an arrow instead of a blur, and the tracking motors answered with a steadier hum. [605] On the monitor the Moon held still, and the first micrometeor flash winked near Mare Crisium, and Mara gave the launch command, sending the camera pod up the rail with a roar that shook her bones. [641] As the pod climbed into the thin blue and the quake subsided, she listened to the leaf ticks and to the distant telemetry, and she felt, for one breath, that she had restructured time itself into something that could let loss escape.
