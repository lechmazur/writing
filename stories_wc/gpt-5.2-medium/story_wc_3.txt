<story>After the spirit leaves, the air in the magnetic arbor above the clouds tastes like cold iron and apple skin. [20] Nerin, a kindly methodical cuneiform translator, stands on the lattice of levitating boughs with his notebooks open, close enough to feel the last warmth where his sister had been. [49] He came here to reestablish the old observatory, because the monks said the arbor's hidden currents tugged at souls the way lodestones tug at filings. [74] Years ago, his ambition to map the moment of departure had sounded noble, but it haunted him now, whispering that he had valued measurements over his sister's fear. [102] The tablets he translated for the monks spoke of a knowledge fruit that grew only where magnetism and cloudlight met, and of a seed that remembered every question ever asked. [132] Tonight that knowledge fruit seed lies in a glass dish beside the coils, humming faintly as if it can hear him think. [154] Nerin's hands, trained to dust grit from wedges on clay, move with the same patience as he tightens copper bands around a branch that floats inches above the platform. [183] He believes the physics of transition can be understood if he can compare it to something his mind already holds, so he works through analogical thinking, translating between worlds as he always has. [216] A departing spirit, the texts say, is like a script lifted from wet clay, and the magnetic arbor is like the stylus, pulling the impression away without tearing it. [245] When his sister Mara died in the infirmary below, he held her fingers at touching distance from his lips and felt, in the instant after the spirit leaves, a brief drop in weight as if gravity forgot her name. [284] He has carried that sensation upward through storms, because he cannot bear for it to remain only grief; he needs it to become comprehension. [308] The observatory is a ring of stone set among the ironwood trunks, and its instruments were abandoned when a previous abbot tried to trap the dead and was driven mad by his own haunted ambitions. [343] Nerin cleans the lenses anyway, not to steal anyone back, but to reestablish an honest record of what happens when a mind lets go of matter. [369] He wires the seed into the circuit, because the tablets describe it as a bridge: the fruit teaches, the seed remembers, and memory is the one thing a spirit carries across. [400] As the coils energize, the boughs align with a soft click, and the clouds beneath the arbor ripple like parchment dipped in ink. [423] Nerin speaks Mara's name into the horn, not as a summons but as a calibration point, and the seed answers with a pulse that matches the rhythm of his own breathing. [454] In the lens, a pale vector of light arcs from the infirmary's direction, pauses above the ring, and then continues upward, the way a sentence runs off the edge of a tablet into lost space. [489] He sketches the arc and, through analogical thinking, treats its curvature as a grammatical marker, a sign that transition is not a rupture but a conjugation into another state. [518] The seed warms under his fingertips, and for a heartbeat he hears Mara not speaking words but arranging his memories, placing her laughter beside his guilt until the two no longer fight for the same room. [554] His ambition rises again, tempted to chase that warmth and hold it, yet the arbor's field snaps a warning: anything held too tightly becomes noise, and noise becomes madness. [583] So he lets the light pass beyond the instruments, and instead reestablishes the observatory's purpose by writing a translation in plain ink: a guide for future mourners to observe without owning. [614] When dawn thins the cloudsea, Nerin plants the knowledge fruit seed in a pocket of soil wedged between magnetic roots, trusting that understanding, like a tree above the world, must grow after the spirit leaves.
