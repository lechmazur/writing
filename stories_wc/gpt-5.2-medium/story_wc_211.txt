<story>After the foghorn falls silent, the harbor city listens to its own breathing and the towers seem to lean closer, as if waiting for testimony. [25]  
On the highest tower, an ancient orchard garden survives behind glass windbreaks, gnarled apple trees and quince trained into arches over paths of dark soil. [50]  
Erem Voss, a venerable oath scribe for the Municipal Registry, walks there at dusk with a satchel of contracts and a single fragile treasure sealed in paper. [77]  
His tongue can speak dead languages, not as scholarship but as reflex, because each sworn promise he records is archived in the speech of those who first invented vows. [106]  
The Registry believes signatures are enough, but Erem has another motivation, to archive emotional patterns that leak through words like sap through bark, so the city will remember what it felt. [137]  
Tonight the papers tremble in his bag, for he has found in a basement box a wax cylinder phonograph shaving, curled like a pale ribbon and smelling faintly of smoke. [167]  
It was stuck to an old machine, and when he lifted it free the dust of decades rose and he heard, impossibly, a heartbeat embedded in the wax. [195]  
Erem brings it to the orchard because the garden is the only place above the city where silence has depth, and where he can immerse himself without the Registry clerks watching. [226]  
He sets a small hand crank phonograph on a stone table between two pear trees, and the velvet disquiet of the evening gathers in the leaves as if the trees are eavesdropping. [258]  
To steady his hands, he returns to a curious third grade field trip memory, the day his class visited the old Sound Museum and a guide let each child touch a strip of wax shaving. [293]  
Back then he had pressed it to his ear and heard only a faint scratch, yet he felt the guide watching him with solemn hope, as if sound could become a moral record. [326]  
He speaks a line in Akkadian, then in Latin, then in the lost merchant tongue of the river tribes, warming the air with syllables that make his chest vibrate like an instrument. [358]  
When the stylus touches the curling shaving, it should crumble, but instead it softens and accepts the needle, and the machine releases a voice that does not belong to any living throat. [390]  
The voice recites a registry oath, then slips into a lullaby, and Erem realizes he is hearing not words but the shape of grief itself, pressed into wax by someone who never meant to prophesy. [425]  
Yet the lullaby aligns with the city's current sorrow, naming, in dead language cadence, the exact hour the western power grid will fail and the elevators will trap hundreds above the dark streets. [458]  
It is an accidental prophecy, born from a woman long ago singing for her sick child while recording a message for a husband at sea, and the wax kept the pattern like a bruise. [492]  
Erem, trained to bind promises, hears the future as another kind of oath, and he is terrified that by listening he has sworn the city into that failure. [520]  
He immerses himself deeper, letting the orchard scents and the phonograph's rasp braid together, and he begins to write in his ledger not events but the emotional patterns in the voice, fear, tenderness, resolve. [554]  
Those patterns suggest a loophole: the grief peaks only if the city stays ignorant, so he carries the shaving to the roof intercoms and speaks its warning aloud in the oldest vow tongue. [587]  
The message spreads down stairwells and across radios as a strange chant, and when the hour arrives the grid does falter, but crews are ready, elevators are emptied, and the prophecy, archived, loses its teeth. [622]  
Afterward, in the orchard garden atop the skyscraper, Erem stores the wax ribbon in a cedar box beside his oath books, hearing in the quiet not triumph but the soft unease of saved lives. [656]  
He knows the city will ask for evidence and names, yet what he can offer is only the record of feeling, because in every language, dead or living, the truest contract is what we refuse to let happen. [694]
