<story>The vintage bookshop attic smelled of foxed paper and pigeon feed, a loft above Merek's storefront where Mara kept her courier birds and her secrets. [25]She was a courier pigeon trainer by trade, but lately she trained herself harder, learning to trust again one small delivery at a time after the last betrayal. [53]In a tin on her desk lay a mars meteorite chip, red-dark and sharp, the only relic she had not rewritten into some safer story. [78]Everything else in her life she reinvents personal history with, changing names on ration cards, smoothing dates on letters, making paper trails that led nowhere but forward. [105]Merek, who collected first editions and broken instruments, had hired her because his customers paid more for messages that could not be tapped, and because he liked the quiet flutter overhead. [136]He also liked the songs that sometimes drifted up the stairwell when Mara cleaned cages, half-remembered melodies her mother once sang before the fires took the theater. [163]Preserving the echo of lost songs was her private motive for keeping the bookshop's attic as a nest; paper carried music longer than lungs, if you kept it dry and moving. [194]On mornings when doubt withered her throat, she practiced balance on a narrow beam between rafters, holding her arms out like wings until her breath steadied. [220]To choose which bird could be trusted with which page, she used a stranger method: by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight, watching how each pigeon cut the light and disturbed the pattern. [257]The motes formed slow spirals and sudden eddies, and in them she read temperaments the way other trainers read eyes: steady, skittish, hungry, or loyal. [282]One afternoon a man in a soaked coat climbed to the attic and introduced himself as Oren, a clerk from the Archives, though his boots left no mud and his smile was too careful. [316]He set a bundle of sheet music on Mara's desk, each page stamped with burned-out theater seals, and asked her pigeons to carry copies to three rooftops before night. [345]Merek listened from the stair and said nothing, but Mara saw his fingers tremble, the way they did when a tune almost returned and then died. [371]Oren offered payment in ink and bread, yet what caught her was the thin chain around his neck, holding a small red-dark stone that matched her meteorite chip. [399]He noticed her glance and said, softly, that the stones came from the same fall, that a singer had once given him his chip as a promise to keep her work alive. [431]Mara's mind bloomed and withered at once, because her mother had spoken of such a promise, and because promises were exactly what she had learned to forge on paper. [460]She asked for proof, and Oren slid a receipt across the desk, part of an old ledger trail that showed Merek buying blank staff paper the week before the theater burned. [491]The paper trails did not accuse, exactly, but they pointed, and Mara felt the beam under her feet again, that old need to balance between suspicion and need. [519]That night she sat under the skylight and let her meteorite chip hang from thread like a plumb bob, tracing how its shadow crossed the dust swirls while Oren waited below. [550]If his chip was true, the Archives wanted the songs for preservation, but if it was a trap, her pigeons would lead agents straight to the last rooftops where people still sang. [582]Merek climbed up at midnight and confessed that he had hidden the original scores in the attic floorboards, then paid bribes with forged invoices when the city began banning gatherings. [612]He said he never betrayed the singers, only the truth about himself, and that he was tired of living as a shopkeeper with a false past stitched together by receipts. [642]Mara understood then that her own reinvention had been a kind of withering, a way to survive by pruning every branch that might be grasped by another hand. [670]At dawn she chose three calm birds, copied the music, and sent them out, trusting Oren to meet them, trusting Merek to keep the originals, and feeling a small bloom in the dust-lit air as the attic emptied.
