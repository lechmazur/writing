<story>After the collapse of civilization, I kept watch in the beacon-tower, the last upright needle on the salt flats. [19]My title was custodian, but the job was really listening for any reason the world might still answer. [37]At the tower's base stood the glass humming pavilion, a domed ruin that sang when wind combed its ribs. [56]Inside, on a brass cradle, lay the broken crystal prism that once split the beacon flame into a far-seen rainbow code. [77]The prism had cracked on the night the grids died, and with it the light went plain and weak. [96]I was retrocognitively blessed, cursed to see the last few minutes of anything I touched, as if objects carried memories like dust. [118]When my fingers traced the prism's fracture, the pavilion filled with ghost images of engineers arguing, and one whispering, 'Let it break.' [141]That whispered sabotage felt like a coincidence begging for meaning, and meaning was all I had left to prove I was not alone. [164]Two days later a meteor shower stitched the sky, and in the morning I found a pebble of black glass under the pavilion's threshold. [188]The moment I picked it up, sound folded inward, and the pavilion's constant hum dropped into a perfect, breathable silence. [208]I named it a shard of hush, and in its quiet I could hear my own thoughts click into patterns. [228]If the prism had been meant to break, and the hush had fallen at my feet, then the stars might be laying out a trail instead of throwing dice. [257]That was my obsession: to prove that coincidences have meaning, even now, when maps were ash and radio towers were bones. [278]At dusk I climbed the beacon stairs with the broken prism wrapped in cloth and the hush shard in my pocket. [299]From the lantern room I watched constellations wheel, and I began the work the old manuals called alignment by tracking star paths. [321]Each night I marked where Deneb crossed the torn horizon, where Orion's belt sank behind the ruined highway, and where the moon cut their lines. [346]In the hush's silence my retrocognitive gift sharpened, and when I touched my chalk marks I saw tomorrow's smears, as if time had loosened. [370]Those glimpses were not prophecies but echoes of choices, showing me which angle would lead to a bright beam and which would fizzle. [393]On the seventh night, the stars traced a narrow corridor in the sky, and the hush shard grew cold, tugging my hand toward the prism cradle. [419]I carried both to the lantern lens and, in the dim, fitted the fractured prism pieces around the hush like petals around a seed. [443]The hush did not swallow light; it steadied it, dampening the tremor in the old fuel flame until the beam held its shape. [466]With the stars as my rulers, I turned the assembly a fraction, then another, until the rainbow code reappeared on the clouds like a healed scar. [492]To rekindle the beacon meant more than lighting it; it meant returning the old promise that someone, somewhere, was watching back. [513]At midnight the first reply arrived, not as a voice but as a distant answering flash, three beats, then two, from beyond the dunes. [537]My knees shook with thistle-blown hope, because that signal matched the very code I had seen in the prism's memory of the engineers. [560]In the hush, I touched the beacon railing and saw, retrocognitively, a caravan weeks ago pausing at the tower's shadow, guided here by the same meteor shower. [587]Their leader had looked up at my dead light and said, 'If it ever wakes, we will know the world is stitched, not random.' [612]I answered them with another burst of color, and by dawn figures crested the flats, carrying water skins and a new wick for my lamp. [637]In the pavilion below, the glass began humming again as if pleased to be useful, and the hush shard, now set in the prism, let us hear one another without fear. [668]We were scraps of a fallen age, but the star paths above kept their patient geometry, and I finally had my proof: some accidents are invitations. [694]</story>
