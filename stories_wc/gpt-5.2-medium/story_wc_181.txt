<story>Between the first and last page of the station logbook, Mara Keene tried to locate herself, a bewildered curator sent to catalog the astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid. [30] Every tree wore constellations like fruit, bright enough to turn her fear into a kind of wonder, yet the silence around the domes held a brightened disquiet that never quite let her breathe. [63] She had come for the museum consortium, but also to pursue forbidden knowledge whispered in footnotes, the rumor that an heirloom could pass backward as well as forward through a bloodline. [94] The orchard itself was grown from such a thing: a pistachio shell cameo blank, no portrait carved into it, only a pale oval that seemed to wait for a face and a name. [127] Mara kept the blank in a glass case in her quarters and, each morning, she would inquire of it as if it were a colleague, asking what story it wanted cataloged and why the asteroid answered with blossoms. [165] The reply never came in words, but in a simply complicated sequence of events that refused to stay in order: she would discover a tag for a tree she had not yet measured, then later find the measurement already written in her own hand. [209] In the greenhouse walkway, labels dated next year hung beside saplings that were dying as if they remembered being harvested centuries ago. [231] She began to suspect nonlinear inheritance, the kind her grandmother had warned about in a letter that arrived after the funeral and smelled of disinfectant from a shipboard bathroom. [260] That was the first time Mara noticed her strangest habit, having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms, because only there did the station mirrors show her as both child and old woman at once. [292] Leaning over the sink, she realized the mirror was not reflecting time but filing it, sorting moments like specimens, and the cameo blank in her case was the drawer label that could be swapped. [326] If she could carve a face into that pistachio shell, she could decide which ancestor received which memory, and thereby steer the orchard, the consortium, and perhaps herself, across timelines. [356] The knowledge was forbidden not because it was evil, but because it was too clean, able to erase guilt by moving it to someone who had not yet been born. [386] Still, the orchard lured her with its radiant petals and with the logbook whose pages kept reordering themselves between the first and last page, as if the book were inheriting her life out of sequence. [421] At night she walked among the trees, watching star-fruit fall upward, and she heard a child laugh from the compost pit, a laugh that matched her own throat in the mirror. [452] When she returned to her quarters, she found the cameo blank missing, but in its place lay a finished cameo showing her grandmother, eyes wide, as though she had just discovered what Mara was about to do. [489] Mara rushed to the bathroom, because that room was where conclusions happened, and on the damp tile she understood the trap: she had already carved the face, in a future that had inherited her curiosity. [524] The orchard was not a discovery she would donate to the consortium; it was her family's archive, planted by descendants who needed her to become the ancestor who would hide the forbidden knowledge in plain sight. [560] So she opened the logbook to its last page, wrote an accession note to her younger self on the first, and placed the cameo of her grandmother back into the glass case, accepting that the simplest way to keep history honest was to keep it complicated.
