<story>The aurora-lit archway at the edge of Lumen Gate glowed like a bruise of green fire against the winter dark.[20] Under it stood Sel, a moonstruck dreamer who heard unspoken words as clearly as bells, and those words had begun to go silent.[43] In the workshops beyond the arch, painters stared at blank cloth and poets chewed their pens, as if someone had caged their sparks.[66] Sel could hear the trapped creativity knocking inside them, not as speech but as pressure, a plea that never reached the mouth.[88] The city elders called it a famine of inspiration, yet Sel tasted another cause: remembered stardust, stolen from the sky and locked away.[111] When Sel was a child, meteors had rained every season, and each streak left a grit on the tongue that made songs rise unbidden.[135] Now the heavens looked scrubbed clean, and Sel carried the last of that grit in a brass astronomical instrument, an astrolabe etched with constellations no map admitted.[162] The astrolabe was heavy with memory; if Sel pressed an ear to it, the metal murmured names of stars that had died before any written year.[188] Time in Lumen Gate passed across an unwritten calendar, marked not by dates but by what the sky chose to show, and lately it showed only absence.[215] Sel believed the stardust had been siphoned into the deep vault under the archway, where the elders stored relics and, perhaps, fear.[237] To free it, Sel would not fight guards or pick locks, but follow the old method taught by wanderers: by tracing the path of falling stars.[263] The first step was to rest, truly rest, beneath the archway until the aurora quieted into slow curtains and Sel's own breath matched the sky's pulse.[289] In that shadowed rapture, Sel listened to the unspoken words of the city drifting like moths, and the astrolabe's pointer trembled toward the northern gap.[314] A meteor finally cut the dark, thin as a needle, and Sel raised the instrument to catch its angle, marking the streak on a strip of birch bark.[342] Another followed, then another, as if the sky remembered Sel watching, and each line Sel drew seemed to tug at something under the stones.[366] By the third night on the unwritten calendar, Sel's hands shook with cold and awe, yet the murmurs in the astrolabe grew louder, almost impatient.[391] Sel heard, beneath the elders' footsteps above the vault, the unsaid confession that they had trapped the stardust to keep citizens docile and predictable.[415] That confession did not come in words from mouths; it came as a sour hush that only Sel could translate, and it hardened Sel's resolve.[440] On the seventh mark, when the aurora flared violet, Sel laid the birch bark map beneath the arch and set the astrolabe on its crossings.[465] The traced meteor paths formed a spiral, and as Sel turned the instrument to match it, the stones below warmed, unlocking with a sigh like a relieved throat.[493] A seam opened into the vault, spilling darkness first, then a silver dust that swarmed upward, carrying every half-born idea the city had swallowed.[517] Sel stood in the doorway and let the dust pass through their fingers, and in it they felt remembered stardust: the heat of vanished suns held in memory.[545] As it rose into the streets, Sel heard unspoken words turn to laughter, to quarrels, to daring plans, and even the elders' fear cracked into astonishment.[571] Sel, exhausted, rested again under the aurora-lit archway, holding the astrolabe against their heart, while above, new meteors wrote the city's true calendar in fire.[596] Across the next blank marks of the unwritten calendar, murals bloomed on alley walls, and Sel walked through them as if through dreams finally given daylight.[622] Whenever a mind tried to close again, Sel lifted the astrolabe, traced the latest falling star, and felt the city answer in shadowed rapture.[646]</story>
