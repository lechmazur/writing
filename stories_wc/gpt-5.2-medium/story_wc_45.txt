<story>After they found the substitute body in the river reeds, Dr. Rowan Hale walked the maze alone. [17]He was the town bone setter, a forgiving skeptic who never mocked grief but distrusted legends. [33]Yet the reeds had yielded a child-sized corpse dressed in his missing patient Lina's coat. [48]Lina herself had vanished a year ago, and now her mother insisted the body was a substitute. [65]Rowan had signed the death note, then tore it up, feeling a cleft in certainty widen inside him. [83]He yearned for a fact that would not bruise anyone, and for a way to turn mistakes into constellations. [102]That longing led him through the hedge maze to the old manor's secret garden, which Lina loved. [119]Hidden behind clipped walls of yew, the garden kept weathered sundials beside beds of new hybrid roses. [136]Lina had helped him graft those roses last summer, shrewdly innocent in her questions about blood and bones. [154]She would watch him set broken wrists, then ask why pain made people lie. [168]Now, at the garden's center, her small notebook lay under a bench, swollen from rain. [183]Inside, a pressed leaf marked a page where she had drawn a star map of the hedge maze. [201]Tucked in the fold was a tiny object wrapped in thread: a changeling's baby tooth. [216]Rowan knew the folklore, of children swapped for clever mimics, but he had always called it a story. [234]Still, the tooth was real, chipped on one edge as if pried out too early. [249]He remembered Lina arriving the week after her disappearance, not older, but changed, too calm when he touched her pulse. [269]He had written the strangeness off as trauma, and the town had written it off as witchcraft. [286]At the morgue that morning, the substitute body had a healed collarbone set perfectly, the way Rowan sets bones. [305]That detail should have reassured him, yet it was the wrong kind of familiar, like seeing his own handwriting in a threat. [327]He sat on the bench and listened to the garden's old fountain, refurbished with a silent electric pump. [345]Nostalgia and innovation always met here, and Lina had said the future should smell like crushed mint. [362]Rowan followed her star map to the maze's northern turn, where a loose stone hid a tin box. [380]In it were her notes on his cases, each mistake circled in red and linked to a constellation name. [399]A failed set became Cassiopeia, a late visit became Orion, and she wrote, We can navigate by what we get wrong. [420]The last page said, If I am not Lina, forgive me, but do not stop looking. [436]Rowan's skepticism cracked further, not into belief, but into responsibility. [446]He went back to the riverbank at dusk and examined the body's joints again, using the patient methods of bone setting. [467]The wrists bore faint splints marks made from hedge twigs, and the ankle had been reset by a small, practiced hand. [488]No adult in town worked so neatly except him, and he had never touched the child in the reeds. [507]Someone else with his lessons had done it, and he realized Lina had been apprenticing herself in secret. [525]When he returned to the garden, a girl stepped from the roses, barefoot, eyes bright as polished seeds. [543]She held her jaw as if it ached, and Rowan saw a gap where a baby tooth should have been. [563]I left it for you, she said, voice Lina's and not Lina's, shrewdly innocent in its candor. [580]Rowan did not reach for a charm or a prayer; he reached for his satchel and asked to see her mouth. [601]He touched her jawline and felt a misaligned hinge, as real as any fracture, and his yearning steadied into work. [621]With gentle pressure he set the tiny bone, and the girl exhaled, surprised at how ordinary relief could be. [640]If you are a changeling, Rowan said, then you have suffered in our maze of fears, and I can forgive that. [661]She nodded and pointed toward the hedge where a narrow door of living branches opened onto darkness. [678]Beyond it, she promised, the real Lina waited, and the substitute body was only a shell meant to close the search. [699]Rowan took the baby tooth from his pocket, tied it to Lina's star map like a new point of light, and stepped through, determined to chart whatever came next. [728]</story>
