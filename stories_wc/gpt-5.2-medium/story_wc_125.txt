<story>After the energy beings arrived, highways hummed like tuning forks, and I drifted from exit to exit with a notebook in my pocket, a roadside poet collecting overheard prayers from truckers and vanished billboards. [34]They were not gods, just luminous intelligences who fed on motion, and their presence bent minutes into elastic loops, so everyone began choosing between getting home on time or keeping their memories intact. [67]I wanted neither punctuality nor forgetfulness; I wanted to discover the texture of time itself, the grain under the fingertip, and for that I carried a frayed coil of rope taken from a prison escape, traded to me for a verse at a rest stop. [112]The rope smelled of sweat and iron, and its strands held a pattern of knots the escapee had tied in the dark, each knot a decision that could have broken his neck or opened a gate. [148]When the energy beings began offering bargains, the rope became my compass: they asked me to map their new currents through human towns, and in return they would let me touch yesterday without losing tomorrow. [183]It was an impossible choice, because mapping them would quicken their feeding and thin our hours, yet refusing meant remaining a poet skimming surfaces, never learning what time feels like when you pull its threads. [218]So I played ethically, as my mother taught, joking with consequences but not denying them, and I told the beings I would guide them only to a place that already wanted to be altered. [252]They followed me off the road into desert badlands, where an old river had carved a terra cotta grotto, and under starlight the clay walls glowed as if holding a private sunset. [284]I chose the grotto because its roof had fallen in layers, each collapse revealing older bands of earth, and I thought that by uncovering layers I might coax time to confess its hidden surfaces. [318]I spread the frayed rope on the dusty floor and traced its knots against the strata, matching fibers to seams, making a pattern that looked like a map and like a poem at once, then asked the beings to breathe through it. [360]Their light poured into the twists, and the grotto answered with murmurs: the first layer tasted of childhood dust, the next of lovers leaving, and deeper still the air turned rough as stone, the texture of time becoming almost audible. [400]But the beings demanded a final exchange, and here the impossible choices sharpened: either I cut the rope and free them to flow into every city, or I keep it whole and trap them in the grotto, saving people but sealing my own discovery. [444]Ethically playful, I offered a third game: I untied one knot, the one that had marked the escapee's leap over a wall, and I re tied it as a slipknot that could open only when someone recited the verse he paid me with. [487]The beings accepted, laughing like wind chimes, and they sank into the rope's braids, neither loose nor imprisoned, while I walked back toward the highway knowing time now had a feel, and that my poem was a lock anyone could choose to turn. [530]Weeks later, after midnight shows of starlight, drivers found the grotto by rumor, and when they spoke the secret verse their headlights flickered through years, letting them revisit a single moment to mend a mistake without stealing hours from others. [570]I stayed outside on the roadside, listening to what they chose, because each visitor faced a new impossible choice, and the verse measured their courage: some returned to say goodbye, some to forgive, and some to leave well enough alone. [610]In my notebook I wrote their decisions as stanzas, uncovering layers of meaning the way the grotto revealed clay bands, and I noticed that time's texture was not smooth at all but braided, like rope, with mercy and cost twisted together. [651]Sometimes the energy beings pulsed within the knot and tempted me to open it forever, yet I kept drifting, passionate but subtle, trusting that the best map of motion is restraint, and that a poet's duty is to keep choices human sized.
