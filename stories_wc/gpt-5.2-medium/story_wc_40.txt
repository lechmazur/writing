<story>They asked me to testify at dawn, in the shadowed library where the windows still held night like ink. [19]I am a reticent scholar, and my voice has always preferred margins, yet the Council wanted the story of the hush. [40]This was after the last dictionary is printed, when the city decided words should grow without fences. [57]Without new bindings to pin meanings down, the library became a greenhouse for language, and for stranger growths too. [76]Between the stacks hung a chandelier that no longer lit, and from it I had taken a single crystal, cold as a tear. [99]The crystal was sonically reflective; if you breathed near it, your breath returned to you as if the air remembered. [119]I carried it in my pocket for months, because I believed it could help me decode the pattern of growth spreading through our pages. [143]The growth began as pale filaments along the spines, then thickened into vines shaped like letters, reaching for shelf labels. [163]At first we cut it away, but each cut produced a silence so complete it felt suspended, a hush you could lean on. [186]In that suspended hush, even guilt did not echo, and that tempted people to hide their losses among the shelves. [206]Three apprentices disappeared during the season of cuttings, and the Council decided the library itself must be questioned through me. [226]I stood at the long table, hands folded around the crystal, while the first light combed dust from the rafters. [246]My testimony would not come as a clean narrative, I warned them, but through fractured sequences, the way memory breaks on fear. [268]They agreed, because in our era of unprinted definitions, fragments were all any of us could claim as truth. [287]Sequence one: I found the first apprentice, Lysa, listening under the chandelier as if it were a nest. [305]She tapped a book spine, and the sound bounced off the hanging glass, then returned softer, teaching her where the vines were. [327]I showed her my stolen crystal, and its surface caught her tapping and threw it sideways, mapping the stacks by echo. [348]Sequence two: later that week I heard, inside the suspended hush, a childlike laugh that did not belong to any child. [369]It came from the botany alcove, where old herbals lay, and where the letter vines grew fastest toward sunlight. [388]There I saw Lysa again, kneeling, her fingers guiding new shoots into the margins as though she were teaching them to read. [410]Her face held weathered innocence, the look of someone too young to be tired, yet already devoted to a quiet duty. [431]She said the vines were not invading, they were translating, and that the missing apprentices had followed the translation downward. [451]Sequence three: I climbed into the maintenance stair behind the west shelves and found a door newly outlined in green stems. [472]When I pressed the crystal to the keyhole, the sonically reflective facets gathered the building's smallest creaks and arranged them into a rhythm. [495]The rhythm matched the spacing of the vines on the nearest dictionary page, and I understood the pattern of growth was a code for paths. [520]I opened the door and entered a corridor where every word ever fixed in print hung as paper skins, shedding silently into compost. [543]At the end, the two other apprentices sat beside a cistern, safe, mouths open in awe, because the hush had kept them unafraid. [566]They were tending the compost like gardeners, letting definitions rot so new phrases could sprout, and Lysa called it the root lexicon. [588]I wanted to scold them for trespass, but the corridor smelled of damp earth and beginnings, and my anger softened into responsibility. [610]In the library above, the Council waited for blame, yet what I could offer was a map, and a plea to listen. [632]So I testified that the suspended hush was not a curse but a cradle, a pause in which language could change without violence. [655]I set the crystal on the table, tapped it once, and let the echo show them the hidden door, brightening as dawn finally arrived. [679]</story>
