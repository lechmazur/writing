<story>Within the fold of a daydream, Mara drifted into the ruined orchard district, where centuries of thick fog sat in the branches like old wool. [25]  
She was a vivid mural artist by trade, but here the walls were collapsed cider houses and splintered packing sheds, begging for color that no sun could give. [53]  
She had come for a rumor, a fresco fragment pried from a chapel long swallowed by mist, said to hold a scene of laughing children no one could remember anymore. [83]  
Joy had gone missing from her own days, not with a bang but with soft resignations, and she wanted to rediscover lost joy the way an orchard finds spring after blight. [114]  
Under her coat she carried a flat tin case, inside it the fragment wrapped in linen and, strangely, a strip of exposed film she had found stuck to it like a black ribbon. [147]  
The film was useless for printing now, ruined by light, yet when she held it up the fog took on faint shadows, as if the air remembered what had been photographed. [178]  
Mara laughed at that, a small sound of pensive mirth, because even her dream self knew memories were never so polite as negatives. [201]  
She set up in the shell of a marketplace, and from her satchel she drew a prism lamp and coils of wire, tools for how she painted with light. [230]  
Instead of pigment, she projected beams through cut glass, steering them across broken plaster until colors clung to surfaces, the way dawn clings to dew. [255]  
To make sense of the fragment and the film, she opened her knowledge network, a web of whispered names and archived sketches shared by artists who traded discoveries like seeds. [285]  
In the dream, messages arrived as moths of paper that landed on her sleeves, each one carrying a map to some fog bound cellar or a code for a forgotten hymn. [316]  
One moth taught her to align the exposed film against the fresco fragment, and when she did, the scratches on the emulsion matched cracks in the painted saint's robe. [345]  
The fragment was not from a chapel at all, but from an orchard schoolhouse, and the saint was really a teacher, her halo a child's sun scrawled in lime. [374]  
Mara felt her own face soften, remembering she once painted walls for festivals and did not measure the worth of a day by commissions. [398]  
The fog outside shifted, and she followed it through rows of dead apple trees to a courtyard where the schoolhouse had sunk into mud and time. [424]  
On a remaining wall, she found a shallow recess shaped exactly like the fresco fragment, and she pressed it in, hearing a click that was more felt than heard. [453]  
Then she threaded the strip of exposed film into her prism lamp, letting the ruined images filter the beam, and the light that spilled out carried silhouettes of children at play. [484]  
She began to paint with that light, tracing their outlines across the courtyard stones, and the figures leapt from surface to surface as if a recessive laughter had found its voice. [515]  
Her mirth stayed pensive, because the children were only projections, but she could not stop smiling at how the fog itself turned into a screen for them. [542]  
To display what she had made, she angled the lamp toward the marketplace where the dream's residents wandered, and the moving mural guided them like lanterns through the haze. [571]  
They gathered without speaking, and in their upturned faces she saw her own earlier self, the one who believed art could be shared without owning it. [597]  
A final moth from the knowledge network landed on the lamp and unfolded into a note: Wake gently, carry this method back, and when the world feels fogged, paint a doorway of light. [630]  
Mara nodded, and with a sudden comedian's timing she bowed to her audience of ghosts, laughing again at the absurdity of taking instruction from paper insects. [656]  
As the daydream thinned, the courtyard dissolved into white, but the rediscovered joy stayed in her chest, bright and practical, like a lamp you can rebuild from scraps. [684]  
When she woke at her studio table, she still held the tin case, and on the exposed film a new image had appeared: her own hand mid stroke, painting light onto a wall. [717]  
She carried it to her next commission, and instead of hiding the process she chose to display the lamp and the fragment beside the finished mural, inviting anyone to join her network and remember. [751]</story>
