<story>After the orchard grew silent beneath the moon, the cavern breathed like a sleeping animal, and the apples that hung from stone branches glimmered with dew from the dripping stalactites. [30]Lysa, the secretive conjurer, walked alone between the roots, listening for the last drop that would mark midnight, because she believed feelings had rhythms that could be measured if you were patient enough. [63]In her satchel she carried a taxidermist's glass eye pair, cloudy green and veined with gold, saved from a fox that never had a name. [88]They were not for spying, as rumors said, but for aligning her spells to what was missing, the way a grid shows the shape of a hole. [115]Two winters earlier her brother Orren had entered the cavern orchard to harvest moon fruit and had not returned, yet no body was found, no farewell heard, only his ladder left leaning against a pear of quartz. [152]That was the kind of loss that stayed ambiguous, a door neither shut nor open, and it made her tenderly furious at every equation that refused to balance. [180]She had been gently inventive as a child, weaving reeds into toys that clicked like abacuses, and now she turned the same patience toward the mathematics of emotion. [208]If longing could be counted, she told herself, then hope might be proved, and Orren might be somewhere beyond the numbers rather than erased by them. [234]Tonight she followed a single method: via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone set in the central path, whose broken tiles formed repeating triangles like a half solved proof. [265]Orren had laid that stone himself, and she suspected his hands had left a message in the fractures, a map to whatever doorway had taken him. [291]She knelt, set the glass eyes on the tile like twin lenses, and whispered a conjuration so softly that even the bats above could not carry it away. [319]Through them she saw the mosaic brighten, each chip becoming a coordinate, and her heart, which had felt like scattered seeds, began to dovetail with the pattern. [346]The orchard responded as if it remembered sound, and drops from the stalactites fell in measured intervals that matched the triangles, tapping out a sequence she could count on her fingers. [377]When the sequence reached thirteen, a thin seam of light opened between two trees of calcite, and in it she heard Orren's laugh, close enough to bruise. [404]Her first urge was to run through, but the conjurer in her demanded proof, and she adjusted the glass eyes until the laugh resolved into a curve, a probability that rose and fell with her breath. [440]The curve suggested not death, not life, but a third state, like a number between integers, and she understood that her brother might be held in a fold of the cavern where time did not settle. [476]To name that state would be to force an answer the world had not given, so she chose instead to speak to it, offering the old lullaby they shared and letting the notes land on the mosaic like new tiles. [516]The seam of light steadied, and for a moment she saw Orren's outline, not solid but coherent, his eyes fixed on hers with the same question she carried: what do we do with unfinished stories. [551]Lysa answered by turning the ladder into a bridge of spellwork, rungs of remembered days, and she anchored it to the stepping stone so the pattern and her longing would share a single structure. [585]Orren did not cross, yet his outline leaned forward and touched the bridge with a hand of light, and the touch translated into numbers that told her he was reachable, though not retrievable. [618]She took that as the theorem she had been seeking, a quiet axiom beneath grief: that love can continue without resolution, and that the unknown is not the same as the empty. [650]When the seam closed and the orchard returned to silence, she packed the glass eyes away, repaired one chipped tile with a shard of pear quartz, and walked home carrying buried optimism like a lantern under her coat.
