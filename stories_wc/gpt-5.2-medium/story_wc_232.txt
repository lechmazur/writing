<story>Mara Venn sold antique maps in a narrow shop that smelled of cedar and dust. [15]She lived upstairs alone, listening to customers leave with routes they never needed. [28]Her mind was empirically intuitive, trusting measurements but also the small patterns that repeated. [42]One rainy morning a printer from the closed river mill brought her a tin box of scraps. [59]Inside lay curled proof sheets, a cracked brass compass, and a type foundry matrix chip wrapped in vellum. [77]The vellum held a note in faded ink: I promise to meet you where choices have a door. [95]Mara traced the words like contours, feeling a lingering promise tug at her ribs. [109]The printer said the note was found under an old press stone, beside the chip, as if stored for her. [129]He did not know why her name was penciled on the tin lid, but he looked relieved to surrender it. [149]That night Mara studied the chip under her loupe and found its face cut with reversed letters and numbers. [168]A tiny crescent of silver in one corner began to glimmer when she held it near lamplight. [185]She compared the marks to the mill's catalog pages and realized they formed coordinates, not font sizes. [202]On her wall hung a county survey map that showed a limestone ridge and, behind it, a blank patch labeled Sink. [223]If the chip was right, the blank hid a cavern, and the note called it the doorway of decisions. [242]For years she had sold other people's destinations, yet she had never chosen one that belonged to her. [259]At dawn she locked the shop, packed the chip and note, and followed the creek road upriver. [276]Summer storms had swollen the watershed, and the water kept rising as she walked. [290]Her boots sank in silt, but she trusted the simplest data, depth marks on stones and fresh debris lines. [309]By noon she reached the ridge, where dry grass gave way to ferns and a smell of wet iron. [328]The coordinates led to a sinkhole rimmed with milkweed, but no entrance showed itself. [342]She knelt, unsure, until she noticed a line of ants carrying pale petals toward a crack in the rock. [361]Following ants home felt childish, yet it was also an experiment, and she had always trusted experiments. [378]She cleared loose soil, widened the crack with her knife, and found a breath of cool air. [395]The ants vanished into darkness, and Mara slid after them, careful as the creek's roar grew louder behind her. [414]A low tunnel opened into a blooming cavern at midsummer, lit by shafts of sun through ceiling holes. [432]On the cavern floor, white fungi rose like lilies, and moths drifted over pools that trembled with each distant surge. [452]She could tell the creek was climbing above, because the pools' rims seeped and the air thickened. [469]At the center stood a slab of stone carved with a compositor's grid, and in one square a recess matched her chip. [491]When she set the matrix chip in place, the silver crescent glimmered again and letters on the slab sharpened. [510]A panel slid aside with a sigh, revealing a narrow chamber where an old man sat at a hand press. [530]His eyes were bright and wary, and on his wrist she saw ink stains shaped like continents. [547]He said, softly, that he had been waiting since the mill closed, keeping his promise until someone read the coordinates. [567]He called himself Ellis, once her father's partner, and he admitted he had hidden the chip for Mara. [585]Your father believed every choice is typeset, Ellis said, but the form can still be changed before the press falls. [605]Mara felt anger at the years of silence, yet the lonely part of her recognized the same fear in him. [625]Above them water began to patter through the holes, and the cavern's blooms folded as if listening. [642]Ellis pointed to two passages, one marked SET, the other DISTRIBUTE, and said only one stayed dry. [659]If Mara left with him by the dry way, she would inherit his secret presswork and the burden of her father's unfinished debts. [682]If she took the wet passage alone, it led upward to daylight but erased the trail back, a clean decision at last. [704]She listened to the rising creek, weighed both futures like paper in her hands, and chose the wet passage. [723]Before she went, she pressed the note into Ellis's palm and said the promise had brought her here, not to keep her. [745]She climbed as water licked her calves, and in the last shaft of light she saw the ants still marching, unafraid. [766]When she emerged into rain and evening, she understood the doorway of decisions was not stone at all, but the moment she stepped through. [790]</story>
