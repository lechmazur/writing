<story>After the shutdown, the station hung above the black ocean like an unplugged lantern, and the corridors carried an echoed silence that made even footsteps feel like trespass. [28] I returned anyway, a blessed pariah to the crew who had scattered, because the deck where time had been tested was the only place my mind ever lined up. [57] They said my blessing was the reason the clocks failed, that my presence bent minutes the way a magnet bends iron filings, so they left me with keys and blame. [87] In my pocket was the gilded compass rose applique from my grandmother's coat, a bright patch she had sewn on me when I was small and already marked as different. [117] She told me, in the patient language of fishermen, that the world lies about direction but true north never does, and that knowing one honest point lets you walk out of any fog. [150] The anniversary of her death had arrived during the evacuation, and I could not let it pass unmarked, because we have a family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries. [181] I climbed to the time dilation observation deck with my notebook and a graphite stub, listening to ventilation fans slow down in the dark like animals settling to sleep. [210] The deck's window faced the experimental ring, and beyond it the constellations, but the glass had been treated to show two skies at once: the outside now and the outside a few hours later. [244] Without power the ring was inert, yet my body still felt temporally stretched, as if each breath unspooled behind me and every sound arrived with a delayed twin. [272] I pressed the applique to the pane like a tiny sun and used its points to line my page, trusting its geometry more than my wobbling senses. [299] At first my sketch looked wrong, stars shifted away from their charted places, and I wondered if the shutdown had broken the lenses or if my curse had finally become real. [330] Then I saw that the double sky was not an error; it was the deck showing me the drift between the two times, a slow turning that could be measured. [360] If you connect the same star in both panes, you can draw a line of motion, and where many such lines meet is not where your eyes think north is, but where the sky insists. [395] I held my breath and took a careful glimpse through the upper corner of the window, where the treatment was thinnest, and the overlap sharpened into a single needle of direction. [426] That needle did not point to the station's painted arrows; it pointed through the sealed service hatch toward the sea, toward the coast my grandmother had left, toward true north. [456] The realization should have terrified me, but instead it turned the confusion in my chest into a map, and I knew what I wanted: to turn confusion into exploration. [485] The crew had believed the ring caused the accident, yet the deck itself was an instrument, and my odd stretching sense was a calibration, a way to feel the difference between now and later. [519] I sketched faster, marking two versions of Orion and the slow smear of Polaris, until the page held a compass made of starlight and patient pencil dust. [546] When I laid the applique over the drawing, its gilded rays matched the intersection of drifts, and for the first time since the alarms I felt aligned with something bigger than blame. [578] I followed that alignment down to the service hatch, found the manual wheel, and turned it until the bolts surrendered with a cough of rust that echoed back from empty stairwells. [609] Outside, moonlight striped the water, and the air tasted clean compared to the station's recycled breath, but the world still moved in two tempos, waves arriving slightly before their sound. [639] I set my notebook on a rock and, by my family's rule, signed the date under the star sketch, accepting that I was alone and yet connected to every earlier hand that had drawn the same sky. [676] The station behind me became just another dark landmark, and ahead the coast road curved toward the north my page had revealed, a direction earned rather than assigned. [704] As I walked, the temporally stretched feeling loosened into ordinary time, but I kept the applique in my palm, letting its cold points remind me that even in echoed silence the sky can teach you where to go.
