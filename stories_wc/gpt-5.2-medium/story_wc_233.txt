<story>After the final warning, Queen Maelin locked the council chamber and listened to the silence that followed her own decree. [20]The warning had come from the Star-Priest: stop dreaming, or the kingdom would wake to a sky that bled. [39]Maelin was a disenchanted queen, crowned too young, tired of prophecies and of courtiers who offered lacy menace with their smiles. [60]Yet the recurring dreams had returned every summer, always ending in the same image: bleeding starlight dripping into her hands. [80]In the dreams, she stood above clouds inside a cobalt grotto, and something in the rock whispered her true name. [100]She had tried to drown the dreams with wine and lawmaking, but they rose again, polite and persistent as lace around a throat. [123]So she chose a single companion, Captain Rovan, who obeyed her softly commanding voice without mistaking gentleness for mercy. [142]At dusk they left the palace by a postern gate, carrying only a lantern, a coil of rope, and the sealed map of the ridge. [167]The map named their goal plainly: the ember grotto on the ridge, a hollow of black stone said to keep old fires alive. [190]Rovan asked why a queen would climb a mountain in secret, and Maelin answered that sleep had become her enemy. [210]Each night, she said, the dream showed her a star cutting open, and the cut never closed. [227]If the warning was true, she needed to find the place in waking life before the sky began to bleed for everyone. [249]The ascent was steep, and the queen took the front, her cloak trailing like dark embroidery over shale. [267]Rovan offered his hand at a narrow ledge, and she accepted it as if granting a favor, not needing one. [287]Above them the last light thinned, and the clouds below turned to a calm, pale sea that hid the world she ruled. [309]When they reached the mouth of the grotto, the stone glowed faintly cobalt, as if night had condensed into mineral. [329]Warm air breathed out from within, carrying a scent of ash and crushed violets that made Maelin think of funerals dressed in silk. [352]They stepped into the cobalt grotto above clouds, and the lantern flame shrank, intimidated by the blue shimmer in the walls. [373]At the center lay an old fissure filled with dull embers, the same shape as the cut star in her dream. [394]Rovan moved to circle it, but she stopped him with two fingers and a look that could sign a death warrant without ink. [417]Here, she whispered, we wait for the first fireflies of summer, because the Star-Priest said they are sparks that remember the sky. [439]The old ritual required no prayer, only a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer as they rose from the embers. [461]Maelin breathed out with Rovan, and their breath fogged once, then vanished, as tiny lights lifted and stitched patterns in the dark. [483]The patterns settled into a map of constellations, except one star pulsed wetly, leaking a thread of bright, slow blood. [503]Bleeding starlight, Maelin said, and the words tasted like copper though her mouth was dry. [518]The leaking thread dropped into the ember fissure, and the embers flared into a crown-shaped ring that hummed with a patient threat. [540]Rovan reached for his sword, but Maelin laid her palm on his wrist, softly commanding him to stand still and witness. [561]From the ring rose a voice like velvet dragged over glass, calling her by the name the rock had whispered in her dreams. [584]It offered her an exchange: close the sky's wound and lose the throne, or keep it open and rule a kingdom lit by stolen stars. [609]She understood then why the dreams returned, not as prophecy but as temptation, braided with fear, delicate as lace and just as strangling. [632]A queen could live on awe and menace, yet Maelin had grown sick of both, and sicker still of being steered by hidden hands. [656]She turned to Rovan and, with the same courtly tone she used to pardon traitors, told him to tie the rope around her waist. [680]Then she climbed down into the fissure, letting the ember heat bite through her gloves, because unraveling a mystery required entering its seam. [703]Inside, the starlight bled around her like liquid dawn, and she gathered it, not to hoard, but to cauterize the wound at its source. [727]The crown-ring hissed, and the velvet voice tightened, promising curses, but Maelin pressed the light upward until the pulsing star dimmed. [748]When she climbed back out, soot-streaked and steady, the fireflies fell like spent stitches, and the embers cooled to harmless gray. [769]Above the cloud-sea, the night looked ordinary, and that plainness frightened her more than any omen, because it meant the choice was truly hers. [793]</story>
