<story>The floating observatory drifted above the ash colored sea, its balloon skin groaning as wind sheared past, and I watched the horizon through cracked glass while the circuit breakers cooled. [30]On the workbench beside my knees lay the geode crystal I carried from my wedding, split open like a small planet, glittering with a light that should not have survived the fire. [62]I was the drone strike wedding survivor, the man who crawled out from under white cloth and severed limbs, and the agencies that built the drones later hired me for my refusal to look away. [97]They called it an unfiltered awakening, a condition as much moral as neurological, because after that day every sensor in my skull reported raw truth, unsoftened by hope or habit. [127]That truth was intangibly tangible, like holding smoke that still weighs your palm, and it pushed me toward the one question I could not stop hunting: where does unused potential pool, and who controls it. [162]The observatory was my perch, a drifting lab built to measure small instabilities in the upper air, and tonight it shuddered after an overload that snapped the breakers and left the main array dark. [196]While the circuit breakers cooled, I had twelve minutes before the backup batteries dipped and the balloon valves froze, so I worked by headlamp and breath, listening to relays tick like teeth. [228]The strike that killed my bride had been guided by a probabilistic lock, a math trick that finds a target by nudging many tiny uncertainties, and I had learned the same language in graduate ruins. [263]Through perturbation theory it was my compass now; with it I could follow how a small change in temperature, field strength, or doubt would ripple outward and reveal hidden basins of possibility. [295]The geode crystal was not superstition but calibration, its facets scattering microwaves in a known pattern, giving me a stable reference when every other instrument was blind. [322]I set it in the cracked waveguide and pulsed the local field with a hand built coil, then watched the interference on a portable screen that ran hot in my lap. [353]Outside, clouds rolled under us like bruises, and somewhere far below a wedding band of music probably spun in a village, unaware of the drones that always listened. [381]The pattern on my screen trembled, and by comparing its drift to the geode's baseline I computed first order corrections, then second, mapping a gradient that pointed not to matter but to decision. [414]Unused potential, I realized, was not stored in batteries or fuels up here; it pooled in the pauses between triggers, in the moments when an algorithm could strike or refrain. [444]That pool had a signature, a slight softening of the electromagnetic noise, and the observatory had drifted into it by accident when the overload tripped, as if the sky itself wanted notice. [476]It was bleak exhilaration, like laughter in a morgue, because the same slack in reality that let a missile choose my bride could also be seized to cancel the next choice. [507]The breakers clicked once, warning they were almost cool enough to reset, and I began the hunt in earnest, steering the observatory with manual thrusters toward the steepest part of the gradient. [539]Each burst of thruster gas perturbed the field, so I folded those motions into my equations, letting the disturbance teach me, and the geode rang faintly when we crossed the pool's edge. [571]In that ring I saw, without any filter, the wedding courtyard as it had been before the blast, not as memory but as a live branch of what might have happened, hovering beside me like a door. [608]I could not step through, but I could lay my hands on the hinge, intangibly tangible, and when the breakers finally reset with a clang I fed the pool into the guidance net, forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy.
