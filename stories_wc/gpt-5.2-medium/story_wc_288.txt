<story>After the reincarnation memory settled in, I stopped calling my new body a second chance and started calling it a tool. [21] In my previous life I had walked beside moa on the fern plains, and now their bones were museum captions and my only companions were books. [47] That made me, absurdly, a contemporary of an extinct species, carrying their shadows like a passport nobody checked. [65] The Tidal Library rose above the clouds on pylons of petrified coral, and its floors breathed with the ocean even though no sea touched it. [90] Every six hours, vapor from the lower world surged up the shafts, wetting the stacks until the catalog cards curled, then receded and left everything crisp again. [117] Those cycles were my brittle awakenings: each return to dryness felt like waking in a place that had almost dissolved. [137] I had come here to translate isolation into independence, because the city below was loud with people who asked for my past as proof of worth. [163] In the library I could be useful without being examined, and the silence gave my thoughts room to learn new shapes. [184] On my first dry tide, the curator brought me an object wrapped in kelp cloth and said it had refused to keep time for anyone else. [210] It was a brass sundial, palm-sized, with a gnomon shaped like a bird beak, the metal worn smooth by hands that were dust. [233] Around its rim ran an inscription in tiny letters, and when I tilted it toward the skylight the marks flared, atomically reflective, as if each groove held its own mirror. [263] The curator told me it had been found in the moss of an ancient stone circle on the cloud rim, still humming when no wind moved. [289] He wanted me to take it there and listen, because the library collected tides and languages, but not the sounds that made them. [312] I agreed, not out of duty, but because the sundial's light reminded me of moa eyes catching dawn, brief and unrepeatable. [333] At low vapor, I crossed the library's roof bridges and descended a spiral stair that ended in open air, where the clouds rolled like a pale surf. [360] Beyond them stood the stone circle, half buried in lichen, each pillar etched with tally marks that no scholar had parsed. [381] When I stepped inside, the hum grew clear, a low chord that vibrated in my teeth, and the brass sundial warmed as if it recognized the music. [408] I set it on a flat stone and watched its shadow move even though the sun was behind a thick lid of cloud. [431] The inscription lifted off the metal into the air, lines of light arranging themselves into a script that matched the rhythms of the humming. [455] I realized the circle was not a monument but an instrument, and the sundial was its key, translating vibration into readable time. [477] The first message it offered was a list of names, and among them were the last living pairs of the extinct birds I remembered. [501] My stomach tightened, because in my former life I had watched those pairs fail to coexist with our hunger, and the guilt had followed me through death. [528] The sundial did not accuse; it showed patterns, how the birds had nested by the same stones, how the stones had recorded the hum of their feet. [555] In the library, isolation had been a room with walls, but here it was a spacing, the measured distance that allows two lives to share a field. [582] To translate that into independence, I needed to stop trying to resurrect what was gone and start learning how to live beside what remained. [606] The stone circle's hum shifted when I breathed, and I understood it was listening to me as much as I listened to it. [629] I spoke aloud the words I wished I'd said to the hunters of my first century, and the light-script rewrote itself into a set of instructions. [655] They described how to build small refuges in the cloud forests below, places where people and fragile species could meet without consuming each other. [679] The instructions ended with a warning: every awakening is brittle, and any plan that depends on perfect memory will crack at the first tide. [703] So I copied the script into ordinary ink, letting errors show, making a record that did not pretend to be immortal. [724] When the next vapor surge climbed the pylons and the library dampened, my pages wrinkled, but the meaning held, and I felt the first clean edge of self-reliance. [752] I returned the brass sundial to the curator and kept the hum in my bones, ready to coexist with the living world without needing it to forgive me. [780]</story>
