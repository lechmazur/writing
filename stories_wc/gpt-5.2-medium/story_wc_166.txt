<story>After the nostalgia ban, the city sealed its archives and punished anyone who hummed old lullabies. [16]
Mira, a skilled tide dancer from the salt docks, chose elective exile rather than let wardens edit her mind. [35]
She walked out through the west gate with only a needle kit, blank ink, and one moonstone cabochon dust speck. [55]
The speck had fallen from a jewel a smuggler wore, and it glittered like a trapped tide. [72]
Beyond the walls lay the old twilight garden under stars, a place the ban did not reach because it held no names. [94]
Hedges curved there in blackleaf spirals, and fountains whispered in brine language only dancers understood. [109]
Mira had learned to read currents with her ankles, but tonight she needed a different method, by observing gaps. [128]
Between constellations, between the fountain drops, between her own breaths, the universe offered blank measures for a verse. [146]
She carried a vow: to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, so no censor could erase it without drawing blood. [167]
In the city, ink was indexed and bodies were inspected, but in exile she could make a poem that lived. [187]
She sat on a stone bench, pressed the moonstone dust speck into her palm, and felt it warm. [205]
The warmth crawled up her arm and, without warning, she became spontaneously anchored to the bench as if to an unseen mooring. [227]
She tried to stand, but the garden held her with a gentle, absolute gravity. [241]
At first panic flared, then her dancer sense noticed that the anchoring had a rhythm, like tide tables. [259]
If she moved on the wrong beat, the pull tightened; if she waited in the gaps, it eased. [277]
So she began to dance seated, shoulders and wrists tracing crescents while her legs stayed pinned. [293]
The fountains answered with higher spray, and starlight slid along the hedges as if listening. [308]
From the water rose a thin figure of mist, the garden's keeper, who spoke in a voice like wet stone. [328]
'Exile is safest when chosen,' it said, 'but you have brought a city shard that binds you to its grief.' [348]
Mira showed her palm, and the dust speck pulsed, projecting faint images she was forbidden to recall. [365]
She realized the ban had not destroyed nostalgia; it had condensed it into contraband minerals. [380]
The keeper offered a bargain: give up the speck and be released, or keep it and let the garden teach her to write. [403]
Mira thought of wardens turning pages with gloved hands, and she chose the second, even if it meant staying anchored. [423]
Night deepened, obsidian grace settling over leaves, and the keeper guided her attention to the spaces between stars. [441]
Each gap was a syllable, each constellation a line break, and her body became the page. [457]
With her needle she pricked her forearm in a spiral, dipping the point into ink mixed with fountain brine. [476]
The moonstone dust speck dissolved into the mixture, turning the ink silver and slightly cold. [491]
As the first characters formed, the anchoring shifted, no longer a restraint but a fulcrum that steadied her hands. [510]
She wrote not names but motions, describing how tides return without memory and yet remain faithful. [526]
Hours passed, and in the garden's hush she heard the city far away, still policing songs. [542]
Her verse answered that silence, insisting that longing could be transmuted into light rather than surrendered. [558]
When the last line reached her wrist, the keeper touched the bench, and the gravity slackened. [574]
Mira rose, surprised by the ease, and tested a step on the dew-wet path. [588]
She had been anchored so she would stay long enough to learn, and now the lesson let her go. [607]
At the garden's edge a fledgling heron wobbled from its nest, unsure whether the air would hold. [624]
Mira watched it, then understood her own next action: fledge, not back toward the city, but onward. [641]
She wrapped her tattooed arm in linen and carried the remaining ink, planning to visit other banned gardens. [659]
By observing gaps in patrol schedules and in people's guarded speech, she would offer them verses they could wear. [678]
Elective exile would become a network, not of rebels with flags, but of bodies inscribed with star-measures. [695]
Under the constant stars, Mira danced once more, tide dancer and poet, and the twilight garden kept time behind her. [715]</story>
