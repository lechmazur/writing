<story>After the liquidation, most people stopped asking why the sky tasted like pennies and started repeating the Ministry's comfort line: the storms were natural. [24] I made my living as a conspiracy debunker, and being sharply observant was less a talent than a survival habit in the new dust. [48] Clients brought me videos of glowing angels in the clouds, maps of secret tunnels, and, lately, a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed. [71] The diamond sat in a tin box, milky at its heart, and every owner swore it made their crops fail or their lovers vanish. [95] I did not believe in curses, but I believed in patterns, and patterns often meant someone was lying comfortably. [114] A widow named Salma paid me with jars of irradiated honey and a stack of shredded letters she had found in her husband's coat. [138] Her husband had worked for the Liquidation Authority, and the Ministry told her he died heroically sealing a reactor, which was exactly the kind of story that required no proof. [168] I promised, for my own motivation as much as for her grief, to excavate truth from comfortable lies. [186] In my workshop I spread the strips across a table, matched torn fibers, and reassembled the shredded letters until sentences reappeared like bones under sand. [211] The writer, Salma's husband, described a wasteland orchard that somehow thrived amid radioactive dust storms, and he called it the Stillpoint. [232] He claimed the Authority used that hidden stillpoint, a calm pocket inside the storm belt, to move confiscated goods and people after the liquidation without being seen. [259] One line made my hands go cold: he wrote that the cursed diamond was not a curse but a flawed detector, cut wrong on purpose so its cloudy core would shimmer only in the Stillpoint's field. [295] Salma had brought it because her husband stole it, and because thieves in the Authority disappeared as neatly as her lovers in the rumors. [319] I packed the letters, the tin box, and a respirator, then rode a scavenger cart out beyond the concrete ribs of the city into the gray. [345] By day three the dust storms rose like walls, but the reassembled pages had coordinates, and I learned to read the land the way a debunker reads a hoax, for what it tries to hide. [380] At dusk I saw it: rows of apple trees, leaves glossy and unburned, standing in a basin where the airborne grit circled but never fell. [405] I stepped through the swirling edge and felt the world stop humming, a silence so precise that my mind could intuit the boundary as if it were drawn in ink. [435] Inside the orchard, workers in gray masks tended fruit and watched me with the tired caution of people guarding a secret they had been paid to believe. [462] When I opened the tin box, the flawed diamond pulsed with a faint violet sheen, and the nearest worker whispered, 'The curse,' before his supervisor slapped his shoulder and said, 'The beacon.' [494] The supervisor recognized the name on the letters, led me to a root cellar, and showed me a ledger of relocations that proved the liquidation had been a cover for removing dissidents into this calm pocket. [530] I left at dawn with copies of the ledger and Salma's husband's final note, but I also carried a sack of apples because truth, once tasted, is harder to dismiss than any ministry weather report. [565] Back in the city, I staged my findings the way I always did, laying the reassembled letters beside the glowing stone so even a skeptic could see how the beacon had been sold as superstition. [600] Salma read her husband's note aloud, voice steady, and the room of neighbors realized the curse stories had been planted to keep the diamond moving hand to hand until it returned to Authority control. [634] When the Ministry agents came to seize my evidence, I had already mailed the ledger pages to a dozen rival bureaus, betting that in the cracks between their competing lies, the Stillpoint of fact might hold.
