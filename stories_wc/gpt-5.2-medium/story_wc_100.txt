After the mysterious package arrives at my door, the tide seems to pause, as if the sea itself is listening for news from the dead. [25]
I am Marek, a weary undertaker for a coast that has no coast anymore, and my work is to give rest a permanent address when land forgets names. [53]
The package is wrapped in sailcloth and wired shut with copper, and the label bears no ink, only salt-crystals arranged like a map. [76]
Inside lies a broken lighthouse lens, its glass ribs shattered but still smelling of lamp oil and storms, and a note that says, REVITALIZE THE QUIET. [102]
I should have thrown it back to the water, yet I am inadvertently stubborn, the kind who keeps walking long after the funeral is over because the road still holds footsteps. [133]
The note points me down through flooded streets to the forgotten underwater city library, where stone arches lean like drowned ribs and shelves drift in slow spirals. [160]
I go at dusk in a diving suit patched with burial linen, carrying the lens in my satchel, and the sea presses on my helmet with a patient, chased stillness. [190]
At the library gate, kelp has knitted a curtain, and when I cut through, the water inside is clearer, lit by pale plankton that refuse to drift away. [218]
Every table is chained to the floor, every book sealed in wax, as if the librarians expected the sea and decided to archive the flood itself. [244]
In the central rotunda, a brass receiver hangs from the ceiling, and it clicks in my presence, translating distant distress signals into faint taps that tremble through my bones. [273]
The taps spell out coordinates I recognize from cemetery ledgers, the places where coffins floated loose and the dead were never found. [295]
When I hold the broken lens up to the receiver, the shattered glass gathers the tapping into beams, and the rotunda fills with thin light-lines that point deeper into the stacks. [326]
I follow them, and the library rearranges around me, aisles bending into angles no architect could draft, because the city is folding its last secrets into impossible spaces. [354]
To reach the next shelf I must step between two volumes and let my body occupy the gap where there should be only water, a trick the old librarians used to hide during raids. [388]
In those squeezed corridors, sound dies, and the chased stillness becomes a pursuer, closing behind me with the soft certainty of earth on a coffin. [413]
At a reading desk I find a catalog card written in my own handwriting, dated years ahead, listing me as the last volume to be shelved. [439]
The receiver taps faster, pleading, and I understand the distress signals are not from sailors but from the restless, begging for a place that will not sink away from memory. [469]
The library was built as a mausoleum of stories, but its wards are failing, and the dead are drifting through impossible spaces into the open sea, unnamed and cold. [498]
I set the lens into the brass receiver, using wire from my suit and a smear of wax from the books, and I revitalize the old machine with my own breath bubbles. [530]
Light bursts, not whole but workable, and it threads through the stacks, stitching catalog numbers onto drifting bones and pulling them gently toward alcoves labeled by forgotten surnames. [558]
Each time the beam falters, I brace it with my hands and my stubborn refusal to quit, even when the pressure makes my ears bleed and the suit seams whisper. [588]
Hours pass, measured by the slowing taps, until the distress signals become a single long tone, like a sigh settling into a pillow. [611]
The library grows quiet in a way that is not empty but housed, and the chased stillness at last stops running, sitting beside me on the steps as if it has been waiting. [644]
When I surface before dawn, the sea feels lighter, and I know the underwater city has accepted my ledger, giving rest a permanent address while I keep the cracked lens as proof. [676]
