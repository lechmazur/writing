<story>After luck became measurable, the city hired accountants for miracles and inspectors for clover. [14]In that new age, Elias worked as a withered vine dresser at the public garden maze, trimming dead tendrils while tourists chased statistics. [37]He was wisely pragmatic, the sort of man who saved string, reused nails, and believed any bloom deserved a plan for its inevitable browning. [61]Each morning he carried a small tin: a collection of marbles, cracked, once stolen from a children's fountain and now his private ledger. [84]He would polish them with a scrap of chamois until their fractures caught the sun like spider silk. [102]The marbles were not charms, not anymore, but reminders of small victories he commemorated elaborately, because in a measurable world the tiny wins were the only ones that felt human. [132]When he coaxed a vine to thread an archway without snapping, he set one polished marble in a niche of the hedge and wrote the date in chalk on the stone path. [164]When a lost couple found the center by following a jasmine scent he had planted weeks earlier, he placed two marbles together and tied a ribbon of pruning twine around them. [195]The Luck Bureau called such gestures superstition, but its officers still walked the maze with wrist meters that blinked green for favorable probability and red for waste. [222]Last spring one officer, Mera, stopped Elias by the yew gate and showed him a reading: his luck score rose whenever he tended the vines, and fell whenever he lied about it. [254]Her evidence turned an old shame in him, because years ago he had deceived the Bureau to keep his job, faking harvest reports after a blight and blaming vandals for his neglect. [286]He had repaired that lie with a mended deception, confessing the blight to the director while also planting new cuttings in secret so the garden would not be closed before it recovered. [318]The director accepted the truth and pretended not to notice the midnight planting, and Elias learned that some false fronts could be stitched to serve a truer outcome. [346]Now, with meters proving that luck punished deceit, he wanted something stricter than forgiveness: to prove that gardens know their gardeners, even when people do not. [372]He asked Mera for one night inside the maze after closing, and she granted it, curious whether his private rituals could move a number on her screen. [399]At dusk he lit lanterns made from old jam jars and set them along the hedges like a slow constellation, each jar labeled with a minor triumph: 'no mildew,' 'new shoot,' 'kind word.' [432]He placed his cracked marbles at the base of those jars, then polished the last one until his thumb ached, because it carried the deepest fracture and the brightest glint. [462]In the center he opened the tin and poured out the marbles into a spiral on the grass, a blooming pattern that also looked like a dying vine curling back on itself. [494]Mera watched, her meter blinking uncertainly, and asked what he expected from glass and chalk. [509]Elias said the maze remembered every hand that shaped it, that each clipped leaf and each spared bud was a choice, and choices were what luck was measuring now. [538]He admitted the old report fraud aloud to the hedges, not for the Bureau but for the roots, then he described the nights he had replanted until his back shook, naming each cultivar like a witness. [574]A wind moved through the corridors, lifting scent from rosemary and rot from compost, and the lantern light made the maze seem to bloom and wither at once. [602]On Mera's screen his luck score climbed, not because he had performed magic, but because the meter detected steadier patterns in his breath and pulse, the physiology of someone finally aligned with his work. [636]Elias gathered the spiral back into the tin, leaving one marble under the oldest vine as a quiet marker, and as they walked out he told Mera, wisely pragmatic as ever, that proof had to be tended like any garden.
