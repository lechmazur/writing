On the Alder Strait run, Lina was an ardent ferry deckhand, the one who checked lines twice and still whistled as if every crossing were a first chance. [28]
Her resilience was not naive; it was practiced, a resiliently positive habit she used to steady nervous commuters when fog made the city lights look like they were slipping. [57]
But lately the commuter ferry itself had been slipping, vanishing midroute with a muffled sigh, leaving only wake rings that spread and then folded back into nothing. [84]
Lina was always the last to remember it, standing on an empty deck that still smelled of coffee, hearing footsteps that were not there, feeling as permanent transient as the tide. [115]
The harbor clocks added insult by running sideways in their brass housings, hands sliding left to right or tilting, as if time preferred to crab along the wharf. [143]
When clocks run sideways, the old pilots said, you can meet yourself coming back, and Lina started to believe them after she found an empty hourglass wedged under the chart table. [174]
Its glass bulbs held no sand at all, yet it weighed like a promise, and the only mark on it was a pattern of tiny interconnected lines, like ferry routes drawn over each other. [208]
She traced those lines with her thumb and noticed they matched the knots she tied on deck, the lattice of rope that kept cars from rolling, and even the star chart pinned above the radio. [243]
That night, instead of going home, Lina stayed aboard and listened to the radio crackle, calling the harbor office every ten minutes and getting only her own voice returned half a beat later. [276]
The echo carried a second set of background sounds, a bell that never rang in her timeline and gulls that cried in a different rhythm, and she realized the ferry was not sinking but sliding. [311]
She remembered an abandoned sea cave on the far shore, a spectral grotto under starlight that the fishermen avoided, and she aimed the ferry there on the next run, alone. [341]
As the vessel approached, the water around it arranged itself into interconnected patterns of ripples and reflections, like the hourglass engraving made liquid, and the engines sounded as if they were turning pages. [374]
Inside the grotto the air shimmered with blue salt light, and Lina saw the missing ferry, the same hull number, hovering a meter above the black pool as commuters sat frozen midblink. [406]
Another Lina stood on that other deck, older by a year and smiling as if she had been waiting, and she held an hourglass that was full, sand falling upward. [436]
The two hourglasses, one empty and one brimming, seemed to tug at each other, and Lina understood the vanishing commuter ferry was the seam between parallel timelines, opening whenever time walked sideways. [468]
Her older self told her, through a radio handset that buzzed without batteries, that the seam could be stitched, but only by matching patterns exactly: routes, knots, stars, and human choices. [499]
Lina felt the permanent transient ache of every goodbye she had watched on the gangway, and she admitted her real motivation was not to stop the mystery but to merge parallel timelines so nobody had to disappear alone. [537]
To do it, she climbed back to her own ferry and, resiliently positive even with fear in her throat, began to radio the harbor office in a code built from the route schedule. [570]
She called out departure times as constellations, docking berths as knot names, and tide heights as musical notes, until the dispatcher, thinking it a drill, repeated them back in the same sequence. [602]
In the grotto, the echoed transmission aligned with the older Lina's batteryless radio, and the two ferries shuddered as the water drew a single map between them, line by line. [632]
Sand appeared in Lina's empty hourglass, not falling yet, just gathering as if listening, while the sideways harbor clocks outside straightened with a reluctant click. [657]
The frozen commuters blinked, then inhaled, and on both decks people moved at once, each remembering a different version of the crossing but sharing the same wet wind on their faces. [688]
Lina met her older self on the gangway where the two ferries touched, and they did not hug like strangers, but traded a workman's nod, accepting that the seam held because they kept working it. [723]
When dawn came, the grotto faded back to ordinary rock, the commuters filed off laughing at a delay they could not explain, and Lina stayed aboard, ready for the next crossing in whatever now was. [758]
