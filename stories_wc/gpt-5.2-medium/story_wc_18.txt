<story>Upon the shimmer of twilight frost, the ruined orchard district, lost in centuries of thick fog, lay as if buried under glass mountains. [23] Lio, a mirror maker, walked its collapsed lanes with boots that sank into mulch and history. [39] He was firmly grounded, the sort of artisan who trusted straight edges even when the world refused lines. [57] Yet every night a runaway dream slipped from him, climbing the fog like a bright animal toward unseen peaks. [76] In that dream he stood above the district and watched orchards become constellations, and boundaries between ground and sky erased themselves. [97] He had tried sketches, prayers, and a dozen polished panes, but the dream always ran ahead of his waking hands. [117] On the third day of frost he found an astronomer's broken sextant in a puddle where apple trees once grew. [137] Its arc was cracked, its sighting tube bent, and the engraved stars were dulled by centuries of thick fog. [156] Lio recognized the tool from stories of the Observatory Guild, who vanished when the district drowned in mist. [174] If the sextant could be recreated, he thought, it might chart the angle where dreams crossed into daylight. [192] He carried it to his workshop, a roofless kiosk wedged between leaning stone walls and frozen brambles. [209] There he set mirror shards on a table of old cider crates, arranging them like a mountain range made of clear ice. [231] He listened for the dream, and when it brushed his ribs he began the work by breathing in time with it. [252] Through synchronized breathing, his lungs became a metronome that steadied his hands and steadied the air itself. [269] Each inhale drew fog toward the mirrors, each exhale pressed it flat, until the kiosk held a still pool of white. [290] In that pool he could see the district without its hard edges, as if streets, roots, and ruins shared one skin. [311] Erasing boundaries was not a trick to him but the only honest way to match what the dream demanded. [330] He filed brass from a ruined gate hinge, melted it in a tin cup, and poured a new arc for the sextant. [352] Instead of glass lenses, he fitted tiny convex mirrors, so the instrument could measure not only stars but reflections of them. [373] All night he kept the breathing rhythm, letting his pulse and the dream's pulse agree on the same quiet count. [393] At dawn the fog thinned to threads, and the rebuilt sextant lay in his palm like a crescent moon cut from metal. [415] He climbed the highest surviving terrace of the orchard district, where dead branches reached upward like black antennas. [433] The air sharpened again with twilight frost returning early, and the fog rose in sheets that glimmered like ground glass. [453] He sighted through the sextant, but the star he aimed for slid sideways, as if the sky itself were dreaming away. [474] The runaway dream had learned to flee by turning every border into a mirror, making direction and distance lie. [493] Lio lowered the instrument and placed a large round mirror on the frost, face up, so it caught both fog and starlight. [515] He realized he could not trap the dream by force; he had to invite it to recreate itself inside something it recognized. [537] He began synchronized breathing again, slow and deep, until the fog pulsed with him and the mirror surface trembled. [556] With each exhale he tipped the sextant and the mirror together, aligning their arcs so the reflected star met its real twin. [578] At that meeting point, the district's old wall lines dissolved, and the terrace seemed to extend into a ridge of glass mountains. [600] The dream arrived, not as an image but as a pressure behind his eyes, and it poured into the round mirror like water. [623] He held his breath at the end of an inhale, anchoring the moment with all his grounded will, and the mirror stopped trembling. [646] In its depth the orchard district stood restored, every tree alive, and above it the same constellations hung from branches. [666] The sextant's new mirrors fixed the angles, while his breathing kept the boundary between dream and waking erased but stable. [686] Lio lifted the mirror to his chest and felt warmth spread through the frost, as if the captured dream had become his second heart. [710] When he walked back into the fog, the ruined district did not change, yet he carried a window where no wall could hold. [733]</story>
