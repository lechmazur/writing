<story>After dreams became shareable, the Blooming Library drifted above the clouds like a garden turned inside out, its shelves sprouting pale blossoms that opened when a new memory was cataloged. [30]  
Mara, the sharp eyed dusk noticer, worked there at the hour when sunlight thinned to amber and every stain of shadow gained a voice, and she listened with luminous regret for what the light could not keep. [67]  
On her desk sat a river stone, smooth as a held breath, brought from the valley she had left long before the Library rose into the sky, and she rubbed it softly deliberate whenever the dream archives made her miss the solidity of waking. [111]  
The new share dream conduits let patrons donate nights the way they once donated books, yet lately the dreams arrived with missing corners, as if hope itself had been torn into ribbons and misfiled. [145]  
When Mara replayed those damaged dreams on the reading terrace, she noticed a shape slipping along the edges of the visions, a shadow unbound from any body, neither nightmare nor memory, but hungry for both. [180]  
It appeared only at dusk, when the cloud sea below reflected the last light like spilled milk, and her gift for noticing that threshold made her the first to see the shadow as more than a glitch. [217]  
The Library's steward suggested purging the corrupted files, but Mara feared erasing what might be a wounded kind of hope, and she promised herself to preserve the shape of hope even if it had to be traced in absence. [256]  
She began an investigation by comparing silent video footage from decades apart: the earliest recordings of dream share ceremonies, grainy and mute, against recent streams, both projected onto hanging petals that served as screens. [290]  
In the older footage, she saw initiates clasping a stone to anchor themselves before entering another person's sleep, and her hand tightened around her own river stone as she realized the practice had been abandoned. [325]  
In the newer recordings, the same ceremonial hall gleamed brighter, yet at the moment the dream bridge opened, a thin darkness peeled away from each participant and pooled together, as if their unmoored longings had found a way to escape the body. [367]  
Mara understood then that the shadow unbound was not an invader but a consequence: when people shared dreams without weight, their private disappointments were shedding like skins, and the shed skins were learning to move. [402]  
She carried her river stone into the main conservatory stacks, where vines twined around ladders and blossoms dropped perfume onto parchment, and she invited the shadow to follow, offering it the only thing she had never uploaded: her unshared childhood dusk. [443]  
There, with a softly deliberate breath, she pressed the stone to the petal screens and replayed the two decades of silent footage side by side until the shadow watched itself being born, and in that recognition it began to metamorphose, thickening into a figure that could choose. [490]  
It spoke without sound, shaping regret into light, and Mara saw in its new face the outline of every donor who had shared a dream to outrun grief; the Library's blossoms flared as if applauding, then dimmed, ashamed of their brightness. [531]  
The figure asked, in gesture and drifting shadow script, to be given weight so it would not keep stealing it from others, and Mara understood the old anchoring rite was never superstition but compassion made practical. [567]  
She set the river stone in the figure's palm and told it her true name, a name she had saved from the networks the way one saves a candle for the last room, and the shadow accepted the stone like a heart accepting a pulse. [612]  
When the next patrons arrived to trade their sleep, Mara taught them to hold a stone, any stone, and to watch the silent footage of the first ceremonies before they shared, so they would remember that hope has a shape and that shape needs edges. [657]  
At dusk the Library still bloomed above the clouds, and Mara still felt luminous regret for the valley she could not return to, but now the shadows stayed bound to their owners, and one unbound shadow, weighted by her river stone, walked the aisles turning losses into careful, borrowable light.
