<story>Under the soft hush of a distant morning, the frozen library above clouds held its breath, every icicle on the eaves chiming like a muted bell. [26] Mara, a lunar-eclipse locksmith, climbed the stair cut into packed snow, her tools clinking with the tired patience of driftwood washed ashore. [48] She had come for one reason: to learn the rhythm of repair, the hidden timing that made broken things return to their rightful motion. [72] In the valley far below, locks could be forced and clocks could be faked, but the old masters said this library kept the first patterns of mending. [99] The doors were sealed with frost-lace and mirrored steel, and only someone born during an eclipse could read the keyholes that shifted in shadow. [123] Mara pressed her ear to the metal, listened for the smallest click, then uncapped a vial of warmed oil and traced it along the slit until the lock sighed open. [153] Inside, the air was hauntingly bright, as if sunlight had been ground into powder and suspended in cold, and it made her eyelashes sparkle with rime. [179] Shelves rose like cliffs, and between them hung corridors of polished glass that formed a hall of mirrors, multiplying aisles into impossible distances. [202] She stepped carefully, because every reflection carried a slightly different Mara, some older, some with hands stained by soot, all walking the same search. [226] At the center stood a reading table encased in ice, and atop it lay a clockmaker's gear assortment, sorted by tooth and size as neatly as prayers. [253] A note pinned beneath the ice read, in cramped script, Take only what you can return, for the library remembers every missing turn. [276] Mara did not want to steal; she wanted to understand, and understanding required parts, stories, and the courage to admit what she had broken back home. [302] Her father had been a village clockwright who fixed storms' damage with nimble fingers, until his mind began skipping like a chipped gear and his workshop fell silent. [330] She could pick any lock, but she could not pick time, and the guilt tasted like saltwood each morning when she opened his unused tool chest. [356] The librarians were not people now, only a low music in the rafters, and she followed it through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner. [382] Those scraps were wedged behind a cracked mirror, and each line described a repair as if it were a tide: first the pause, then the pull, then the letting go. [412] When she read them aloud, her breath fogged the glass and the hall of mirrors answered, rearranging reflections until one corridor showed her father's bench in summer light. [440] In that image his hands were steady, but the clock before him lacked a final gear, and Mara realized the prophecy was not fortune-telling but instruction. [466] She returned to the iced table, chose a small brass wheel from the clockmaker's gear assortment, and held it against her pulse to feel its teeth count her heartbeats. [495] The rhythm of repair, she understood, was not speed but alignment, the moment when effort matched the shape of what was lost. [517] Yet the note warned her, so she searched the corner again and found a second scrap: Return by making, not by taking. [539] She set her own locksmith picks on the table, selected three gears, and with a needle file began cutting new teeth into a blank ring of steel, copying the ratios the prophecy implied. [572] The library's brightness dimmed to a gentler glow as if satisfied, and the mirrors ceased their dizzy multiplication, leaving a single path back to the door. [598] When Mara stepped out above the cloud sea with the finished gear and the original parts still resting in ice, she carried driftwood nostalgia and a new timing in her hands, ready to mend her father's clock without stealing anyone else's turn.
