<story>After revealing the secret of Nerina's drowning to the surface courts, I returned alone, descending past the cracked domes into the forgotten underwater city garden where salt roses grew from broken mosaics. [32] The place should have been dead, yet my lamp stirred clouds of plankton like stage dust, and in their shimmer a statue of a woman sat upright on a bench, dripping weeds like hair. [66] Her eyes were stone, but her voice entered my mind with the calm pressure of deep water: Ilyan, you told them we chose sacrifice, and now you will learn what you missed. [98] I had always called her the Founder, a lifeless memorial, but telepathy made her intimate, and her manner was incisively kind, sharpening each question until it cut cleanly through my certainty. [129] In my satchel I carried the only relic I had not surrendered to the court, a foxglove-stained glass ampoule the color of bruised twilight, sealed with coral wax and etched with the old alphabet. [163] The Founder drew me closer without moving, tugging at my thoughts until I set the ampoule on her palm, and the garden around us seemed to listen, algae fronds holding still like curtains. [196] Thread a line through the city, she said, and you will see the pattern, and when I hesitated she sent an image of a narrow crack in the garden wall where the dome met its rib. [232] I unspooled my guide cord and began to thread it through that structural weakness, slipping the line into the fissure and following it, hand over hand, as if sewing the ruined architecture back together. [266] Beyond the crack lay a hidden corridor where air had once kissed marble, and my cord led to a sealed door, its hinges buckled by pressure, a second weakness that yielded when I pulled. [300] Inside, the Founder filled my mind with the first revelation: the council did not vote to flood Nerina, it voted to vent poison from the mines, and the sea rushed in by accident. [333] That contradicted everything I had proclaimed, and she did not scold, only pressed the contradiction gently until it opened, showing a second revelation nested within: the mines belonged to the surface courts. [365] I saw, as if through someone else's eyes, merchants signing contracts, and then my own testimony before the court replayed in my head, a certainty built on partial records and righteous anger. [396] I tried to apologize aloud, bubbles stumbling from my mouthpiece, but the Founder sent warmth instead of absolution: Nuance is not mercy for the guilty, it is accuracy for the living. [427] We reached a nursery chamber where skeletal planters held petrified seedlings, and there the cord ended at an altar, its stone bowl shaped to cradle the ampoule I carried. [456] When I set the foxglove-stained glass into the bowl, the wax dissolved, and violet liquid spiraled out, not dispersing but arranging itself into letters that floated before my mask. [485] The third revelation came as those letters touched the statue's mind and then mine: the Founder had brewed this ampoule from foxglove to slow her heart, letting her survive the flood as stone. [518] She had chosen that half-life to keep watch, and I felt her long loneliness animate the lifeless city around us, every empty fountain suddenly a throat trying to speak through silt. [549] A fourth revelation followed, cascading without pause: the poison the council meant to vent was designed by my own court's alchemists, and the drowning was later framed as Nerina's fanaticism. [579] In that moment I understood why she had summoned me after revealing the secret; my first disclosure had replaced one simple lie with another, and she wanted me to welcome nuance into a certainty before more harm hardened. [617] I looped my cord back through the cracks and doors, marking each weakness as a path rather than a flaw, and when I rose toward the surface with the ampoule's message, her telepathy whispered, Tell them the whole seam.
