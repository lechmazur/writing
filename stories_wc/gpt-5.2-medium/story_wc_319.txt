<story>Through the veil of sleep I found myself walking where my waking feet could not go, a frozen garden in mist behind the old municipal library, and the air had the foggy lucidity of thoughts that almost became daylight. [39]I was dimensionally homesick, the kind that aches for a street you have never seen, and I had come because the cultist's pendant in my pocket tugged me here every night with a faint warmth that drew a line in the fog. [81]At the garden's center a black arch of hedges opened like a mouth, and inside it the library's stacks rose without walls, shelves standing under open sky, as if someone had peeled the building outward and left its inside exposed. [121]The feral library guardian stepped from between biographies and frost coated roses, barefoot, hair matted with paper dust, eyes bright as trapped moons, and he did not speak so much as sniff the air, listening for theft the way wolves listen for blood. [164]I remembered the rumors, that a librarian once tried to bind sunlight in the catalog and became its keeper, and that his hunger was not for meat but for certainty, so I held my hands open and did the only brave thing I knew, I waited. [210]When he saw the pendant glint through my fingers, his shoulders hunched and then loosened, as if he recognized an old wound, and he paced around me, circling the boundary where the pendant's glow met the garden's gray, testing the boundaries of light. [253]He finally spoke in a rasp that sounded like pages turned too fast, telling me the pendant belonged to a sleep cult that worshiped dawn as a knife, and that it could cut open a seam between worlds, but only where shadow and shine agreed to touch. [300]The guardian wanted it sealed away, yet his gaze kept drifting to the mist beyond the hedge arch, and I understood he was also dimensionally homesick, locked in this half turned library that existed only when sleepers wandered near. [339]To make friends with uncertainty, he said, you must stop trying to pin the world to its cover, and instead practice interiorizing exteriors, letting what is outside become a room in your mind until the fear of losing it turns into curiosity. [381]He guided me between the shelves and the iced tulips, asked me to breathe the garden as if it were a book I was reading from the inside, and as I obeyed the mist thickened, then thinned, and the pendant's light drew a doorway on my ribs. [428]Through that inward doorway I saw my impossible home, not a place but a color that lived just past the last visible wavelength, and the guardian saw his own, a sunlit desk where someone had once called him by his name and meant it kindly. [473]The pendant tried to widen the vision into a passage, brightening until the frozen roses cast sharp shadows, and the guardian lunged as if to tear it away, but I caught his wrist and asked him to wait with me at the edge, just for one breath. [520]In that breath I watched the boundaries of light behave like a cautious animal, stepping forward, stepping back, refusing to be commanded, and I felt how the cult had mistaken this living boundary for a tool, while it was really a conversation between certainty and dark. [566]The guardian's grip softened, and he confessed that his feral years were a defense against the terror of not knowing where the shelves ended, so he guarded every threshold, yet every night he still listened for footsteps that might choose him as a friend rather than a lock. [614]I told him my homesickness was the same kind of misread map, and that if we let the pendant open a way we would only trade one certainty for another, so together we turned our attention inward, interiorizing the frozen garden until its mist became a calm page. [662]When I woke at dawn, the library windows were ordinary glass, but in my palm lay the pendant, now dull as stone, and on its chain was a new paper tag in careful handwriting, a catalog card that read, FRIENDSHIP WITH UNCERTAINTY, RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP.
