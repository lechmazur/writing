<story>Lysa, the spire's youngest servant and its most steadily ascending one, stepped into the brass elevator with a tray of thawing tea and the airship captain's goggles tucked in her apron pocket. [32]Outside the grated doors, the icebound spire rose above the clouds like a frozen candle, and below it the hangar lights glowed muffled and distant, as if the world had already forgiven itself for winter. [67]She had been told the goggles were a memento to be delivered upstairs, but she had rescued them from a snowdrift beside the captain's empty berth, and her warmly inquisitive fingers still felt the grit of ice in their hinges. [107]When the lift shuddered and began to climb, she caught sight of a thin book wedged behind the call lever, its cover sealed with a thread of wire, and she knew at once she had made an encrypted diary discovery rather than a simple errand. [152]She could have left it for the magistrate, but the spire's hierarchy had taught her that secrets travelled upward only when servants carried them, and she was tired of being merely a carrier. [185]As the elevator climbed ten floors, she pulled the diary free, unfolded the wire into a rough key, and unfolded the first pages with the careful patience she used on cracked teacups. [217]The inside was a blur of tiny symbols and numbers that made her eyes water, so she slipped on the captain's goggles, whose lenses were ground to read sky-maps, and tilted her head to catch the lamp's beam through scattered light bouncing off the iced rails. [263]In that prismatic shimmer, some marks brightened and others vanished, and she realized the code was not meant for a cipher wheel at all, but for someone patient enough to read between reflections. [296]Floor by floor, the diary yielded sentences about storms, rival captains, and an ache the writer named plainly, grief for a sister lost in the lower world, yet every entry ended with one small note of delight, like "laughed at a gull" or "smelled cinnamon on a mechanic." [344]Lysa read with affectionate detachment, as if the captain were still leaning against the elevator wall making room for her, and she wondered why a man who flew free had bothered to practice finding joy beneath anguish in ink. [383]At the sixth floor the code shifted, and the goggles showed a hidden line: "If you are Lysa, do not apologize for wanting more; I watched you climb ladders with a tea tray and I know your steps are not meant to stop here." [427]Her throat tightened, not with surprise that he had noticed, but with the old hurt of being seen and still being small, and she steadied herself by reading on, because the diary was becoming a ladder built out of light. [467]The next pages described a plot to lock the spire's elevator and strand the crew during a whiteout, and the captain's plan to prevent it by placing his goggles and this diary where an inquisitive servant would find them before the conspirators returned. [510]He had written the final instructions in a gentler cipher, telling her to stop the lift at the eighth floor, open the maintenance hatch, and pull the emergency brake cable that ran like a vein through the spire's frozen spine. [550]At eight, with her hands shaking inside worn gloves, she did as he asked, and the elevator groaned to a halt while the lantern threw scattered light across the diary, as if the captain were winking at her through the lenses. [591]When footsteps clattered below and angry voices rose, she tucked the diary to her chest, climbed out into the service corridor, and felt, oddly calm, that seeking out the joy beneath anguish could be an act of sabotage as well as salvation. [633]On the tenth floor, reached by stair after the danger passed, the magistrate praised her quick thinking and offered a promotion, but Lysa only adjusted the goggles on her forehead, thinking with fond distance of the captain who had trusted her curiosity to keep the spire aloft.
