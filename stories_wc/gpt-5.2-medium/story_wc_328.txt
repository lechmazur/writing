<story>After the missing return changed, the town of Larkspur felt like a thaw that still stung, and I came in as Mara Venn, new assistant to the herbalist Edda who kept an underground garden. [34]No one knew I was a cryptid researcher working undercover, sent by the university to follow rumors of a creature that bent weight and song the way wind bends grass. [64]Edda's stairwell dropped beneath her shop into warm earth, where mint and rue glowed under lamps, and the air tasted of iron, honey, and the old grief people carried behind their teeth. [96]That grief had a name now, Jonas Reeve, who vanished in February and walked back in March with eyes like river ice and a laugh that never reached his mouth. [126]Edda said Jonas came to her at night, asking for valerian and silence, and she kept his payments in a tin beside a flint arrowhead she claimed fell from the sky. [157]I recognized the arrowhead as local stone knapped by human hands, yet it hummed when I held it, as if it wanted to point at something my training could not name. [188]The first clue arrived via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone Edda kept by the potting bench, its antenna taped, its buttons worn smooth by anxious thumbs. [217]Some evenings the handset would ring without a line, and when Edda answered, Jonas's voice seeped through hiss, admitting he had followed a music under the frozen river and met what he called the Pulling Choir. [253]He spoke of a harmony untamed, notes that refused to settle into any key, and of bodies that drifted toward it as if gravity had learned to smile. [281]In the garden, pots sometimes slid an inch uphill, then paused, like children pretending they had not moved, and Edda muttered that whatever touched Jonas had become gravitationally playful. [310]I recorded every call, but the tape did not capture the soft extra tone that tugged at my ribs, the same tug that made my coffee swirl counterclockwise when Jonas entered the shop. [343]He asked me, thinking I was only Edda's helper, whether bitterness could be turned into a cosmic joke, and his question sounded like a dare offered to the universe itself. [373]My own bitterness was professional, born from years of chasing footprints that dissolved into hoaxes, so I told him yes, if you can laugh while the frost is still in your lungs. [405]That night the cordless phone rang again, and Jonas confessed he could feel himself beginning to metamorphose, not into an animal, but into a doorway the Pulling Choir might step through. [436]Edda pressed the flint arrowhead into my palm and said it was a stitch left by the first people to pin the world down, and if it came loose, all of us would float. [470]I finally revealed my badge to her, expecting anger, but she only nodded toward the plants shivering under grow lights and said, research or not, you will help me keep him human. [502]We lured Jonas into the underground garden with chamomile tea, and when the strange music thickened, I planted the arrowhead point first into the soil as if nailing down a tent in a storm. [536]The lamps dimmed, the pots lifted, and Jonas's shadow peeled away from his feet, but instead of panic he smiled, and his laugh finally reached his mouth, a sound cracked with frostbitten hope. [569]He told the Choir, speaking into the phone that now rang in my pocket, that if they wanted a doorway they could have his bitterness, and he would make it the punchline, not the price. [604]The gravity in the room hiccuped like a mischievous child, then settled, and the wild harmony folded into a chord my bones could bear, leaving Jonas crouched beside the arrowhead, sweating and ordinary. [637]Later, as dawn cooled the shop windows, Edda let me keep the recordings, but Jonas kept the phone, promising to answer if the Choir called again, because jokes, he said, are how you refuse to disappear. [673]I filed my report as an apprentice's diary, not a scientist's proof, and in the margin I wrote that some forces are best met with anchored hands and an untamed song allowed to play. [707]</story>
