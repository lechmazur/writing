<story>After the search party disbands at dawn, the rain-washed foundry is the only place still awake, gutters spilling silver water into slag heaps. [23]I, Mara Vey, a balanced alchemist sworn to measure gain against loss, step through the broken doors with a lantern and a shame that feels newly polished. [50]The men who searched for Orin have gone home to warm beds and excuses, but I remain because his mother paid me in names, not coin. [76]She gave me a zodiac coin stamped with twelve signs and one empty face, and asked me to redeem her boy from whatever darkness had swallowed him. [103]In our city, names are heavier than metal, for every true name can be weighed, distilled, and used as a reagent in work that is, in the strictest sense, factually mystical. [134]I learned that as an apprentice when I tried to lighten my own name, and the scales in Master Juno's shop cracked under the lie. [159]Now the foundry's furnaces are cold, yet the air holds the old heat, and the rain makes every rivet shine as if grief itself were luminous. [185]Orin had been last seen here, chasing a thief into the casting bays, and the searchers found only a broken charm and a smear of gold-flecked clay. [212]Gold in clay means kintsugi intentions, the sort of deliberate mending that announces what was shattered and refuses to pretend it was never hurt. [236]I set my tools on an anvil and turn the zodiac coin in my palm until the empty face catches the lanternlight like a missing tooth. [262]Each sign is also a surname in the old registry, and by exploring limits I can test which name the blank is meant to hold, if I dare spend my own. [293]Balance is my discipline: for every transformation I must offer an equal truth, so I drip a measure of my name, Mara, into the crucible and feel my childhood loosen. [323]The coin warms, the blank face blooming with a faint line of gold that sketches a circle, and the foundry answers with a whisper of footsteps in puddles. [351]I follow the sound past molds and chains to the quench pit, where rainwater has filled it, and in the surface I see the reflected word ORIN, sinking like slag. [381]My heart wants resurrection, but the facts of my craft deny it; alchemy can move substance, not reverse ending, and that boundary is the first limit I must honor. [410]So I aim for a smaller redemption, one his mother can carry, and I kneel to scoop up the gold-flecked clay the searchers dismissed as mud. [436]In my satchel I have a cracked cup repaired with lacquer and dusted gold, my own practice piece, and I grind its seam into powder to mix with the clay. [466]The mixture takes on a slow glow, and when I press it into the coin's empty face it hardens into an inlay that is not decoration but a vow. [495]I speak the names I have stolen through the years, each one a shortcut I used to avoid consequence, and the coin drinks them until my tongue feels honest and raw. [526]When the last borrowed name leaves me, the foundry quiets, and in that quiet the inlay resolves into a single word: ELLIS, the thief Orin chased. [552]I understand then the weight of names is not only what they can do, but what they demand, and I carry the coin to Ellis's shack at the edge of the yards. [584]He opens the door with a bruised face, and when I show him the coin he flinches as if it were a warrant, because he used Orin's name to buy passage out. [616]The zodiac signs revolve under my thumb, settling on the Ram, and I tell him balance requires return: he must give back the name he spent and lead me to the body. [648]Under the same rain we walk to a culvert where Orin lies wrapped in canvas, and Ellis sobs his real name into my vial, making it heavy enough to seal the shroud. [680]At dusk I return to the foundry and place the coin on the anvil beside the lantern, its mended face glowing like a small sunrise, and I feel luminous regret sharpen into responsibility. [713]Tomorrow I will bring Orin home with his true name intact, and my own name, lighter by one lie, will finally fit my mouth without cracking any scales. [741]</story>
