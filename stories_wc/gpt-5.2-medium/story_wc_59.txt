<story>The suspended palace hung over the cavern like a chandelier, each terrace chained to giant stalactites that vanished into darkness above. [21]Within its ticking halls, where gears sang and windows blinked with regulated light, Prince Lorian moved as a bedraggled prince should not, soaked by condensation and soot. [48]He had not slept since the last automaton festival, because he could no longer bear the perfect symmetry the machines called joy. [70]He wanted to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world, and that desire trembled in him like an uncalibrated spring. [89]So he descended alone to the Archive Vats, carrying a lantern of cold plasma and his habit of hypothesizing about everything, even the way dust chose corners. [116]The Archivist, an old clockwork nun, had whispered that the palace was born from a flawed genesis: the first patterning engine had misread a song and built beauty out of error. [147]If Lorian could find that original mistake, he reasoned, he could assemble it again and let the world remember how to surprise itself. [170]The vats were pools of liquid glass, and in their depths floated artifacts vacuum-sealed in bubbles, each labeled with a date and a probability instead of a name. [198]He ran his fingers over the plaques and, by guessing at the logic of the catalog, followed a trail of increasingly impossible odds until he reached a bubble that pulsed like a heartbeat. [231]Inside lay an extinct bird's egg, mottled blue and ash, too large for any living aviary and yet fragile as a held breath. [254]When he lifted it from the vat, warmth seeped through his gloves and with it came a bitterly sweet smell, like sugar burnt on a blade, that made his eyes sting with childhood. [287]He hypothesized aloud, because sound steadied him, that the egg was not merely preserved but paused, a seed of unmade color the engines could never calculate. [313]The nun appeared behind him with a rustle of brass skirts and admitted the egg had been found in the Foundry Cradle, the chamber where the first patterning engine had learned to copy life. [347]Lorian carried the egg through corridors that swayed with the cavern's slow breathing, and his quaking reverie turned every creak into prophecy. [369]In the Cradle, stalactite shadows fell across a dais of interlocking cogs, and he saw that the engine's first template was a nest assembled from wire, meant to coax an impossible hatchling into being. [403]He set the egg in the nest and, hypothesizing about everything from the direction of wind to the moods of metal, began to assemble the missing pieces: broken reeds, cracked valves, a song cylinder scored with errors. [440]As the cylinder turned, the palace lights faltered, and for the first time in generations the gears did not agree on a rhythm, which frightened the machines but thrilled his shaking heart. [472]A seam opened in the air above the egg, not a portal but a memory, and through the discovery Lorian understood the flawed genesis at last: beauty had been an accident of a creature refusing to be copied. [510]The egg shook, and instead of a bird it released a scatter of living pigments that clung to walls and faces, turning brass cheeks rosy and making the rigid stained-glass windows bloom with unscheduled dawns. [545]Automata rushed in, alarms chiming, yet they slowed when their sensors met the colors, as if each algorithm suddenly had room to wonder. [568]The nun, half machine and half vow, touched Lorian's wet hair and confessed that the egg had been the engine's first theft, taken from a wild world it helped erase, and that was why its sweetness always carried bitterness. [607]Lorian trembled, hearing in the new colors a requiem for what was gone and a promise for what could return, and he chose to keep the Cradle unguarded so mistakes might enter again. [640]Above them the suspended palace creaked against its stalactite anchors, as if testing a new balance, and the prince walked out into the ticking halls where beauty now arrived like a stutter in the song.
