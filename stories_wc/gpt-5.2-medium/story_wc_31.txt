<story>As the late-shift pier lamplighter, I lit lamps one by one until the waterline looked stitched with small moons.[19]Tonight the town was quiet in a meteor hush, waiting for the annual sky lantern release that would send warm paper stars over the bay.[44]I always worked that hour because the first lanterns rose just as my last match died, and I wanted their drifting flames to answer a question I hid behind truth.[74]People said I was honest, but my honesty was a screen, and behind it I carried one private vow: to discover the color of sound.[99]When the harbor bells chimed for the festival, the notes seemed to brush my eyes with pale green, then vanish before I could be sure.[124]A week ago I found a hotel skeleton key tag snagged in seaweed under Pier Nine, its brass number worn smooth, and I kept it like a talisman.[152]The tag had no key, only a split ring and the word Meridian stamped along the edge, which matched the name of a ship that sank offshore decades earlier.[181]As lanterns began lifting from the beach, I turned my back on the cheers and walked the pier to its end, where a ladder dropped to the black water.[210]I went down with my oilskin bag and a hooded lamp, by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify.[231]Under the surface the noise of the festival blurred into a soft thunder, and each muffled shout glimmered in my mind as a ribbon of dull gold.[258]The Meridian lay on its side in a sand hollow, and the broken promenade deck led into a corridor still hung with curtains that waved like tired flags.[286]Inside, my lamp found a door marked Library, and beyond it a forgotten library inside a sunken ship opened like a throat, shelves furred with silt, books swollen but intact in glass cases.[319]Someone had lined the room with emergency lanterns that no longer worked, and in their place I set my own lamp at intervals, making a path of light like written sentences.[350]At the central table lay logbooks from the ship when it served as a floating hotel, and the same Meridian name crowned a registry of rooms.[376]The hotel skeleton key tag fit a narrow brass slot on the registry drawer, and when I slid it in, a catch released with a click that flashed bright blue in my head.[409]Within the drawer was a bundle of vellum cards titled Luminous Vows, each promise written in ink mixed with crushed phosphor so it held a faint light even underwater.[438]The vows were not prayers for rescue, but instructions for listening, insisting that every sound has a color and every color can be kept if you bind it to truth.[468]I realized then why I had come: my habit of hiding behind truth could be turned inside out, making honesty not a shield but a lens.[494]Above the wreck, the lantern release reached its peak, and through a shattered porthole I watched dozens of lights float upward while their distant applause poured down as silver rain.[524]I chose one card, pressed it to my chest, and spoke its vow aloud, promising to hear without wanting, to see without grasping, to let sound paint me and then pass.[555]The words kindled, and the ink brightened until the whole card glowed, and the muffled bell from shore bloomed into a clear violet that filled the library like dawn.[584]In that meteor hush under the sea, I wandered the aisles, touching spines and breathing silt, and each creak of the ship signified a new hue, orange for strain, red for fear, white for release.[619]When my air ran low I returned to the porthole, and the last lanterns were only sparks in the sky, yet their fading crackle still streamed green and gold along my vision.[651]I pocketed the tag and the glowing card, not as proof for anyone else, but as a covenant to keep walking my pier at night, lighting lamps so other people could find their own colors in the dark.[689]</story>
