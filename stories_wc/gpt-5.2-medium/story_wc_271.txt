<story>After the last lighthouse keeper died, the coastal town let the beacon go dark and planted an arboretum on the cliff above it, where salt wind braided through pines and imported cedars. [32]  
Mina walked its gravel paths each morning, a drone strike wedding survivor whose life had been split into before and after by a sound like tearing metal. [59]  
She carried a crumpled photograph in her jacket, the only picture of the bride and groom still smiling, folded so many times the crease lines looked like maps of ruined streets. [90]  
The town council hired her as an interpreter for visiting botanists because she was quietly talented with languages, able to name both trees and grief without raising her voice. [119]  
She accepted not for money but to anchor optimism in realism: if something could grow here on the edge, it had to do so in full view of the sea's erosion. [150]  
The arboretum's central feature was the old lighthouse lens displayed in a glass pavilion, and at noon light pooled in it as if the building still remembered its job. [179]  
Mina liked to stand beside the lens until her thoughts slowed into what she called a pearl of stillness, a hard, bright pause that did not pretend the past had not happened. [211]  
On a Monday in late summer, a research team arrived with saplings meant to resist salt, and their leader, Dr. Harlow, asked Mina to translate warnings about transplant shock to local volunteers. [243]  
She began, but a distant buzzing rose from the water and her throat tightened, because her body kept a catalog of danger that words could not file away. [271]  
Through somatic markers she tracked the surge: palms wet, knees soft, the same copper taste that had come before the strike, and when the sound sharpened she froze mid-sentence. [300]  
The volunteers looked at her as if she had forgotten her own language, while Dr. Harlow followed her gaze to a hobby drone skimming along the cliff for tourist video. [330]  
Mina forced air into her lungs and asked the operator, a teen with a controller, to land it, explaining that some sounds were not neutral and that the arboretum was not a playground for everyone. [365]  
Later, Dr. Harlow apologized and offered to move the team inland, but Mina shook her head and unfolded the photograph, flattening it on a bench beside a young cypress. [394]  
She told him she returned here on purpose, because the cliff taught a clear arithmetic: trees grew at a measured rate, storms came on schedule, and loss was not reversible. [424]  
In the photo, her cousin Samir held out a ring, and Mina traced the crease across his hand, noticing how her chest eased when she named the details out loud. [454]  
Dr. Harlow listened, then asked what would help, and she said the saplings needed what she needed: stakes, shelter, and a record of what happened when conditions turned harsh. [483]  
That afternoon they built windbreaks from reed mats, and Mina translated each step, keeping her attention on bodily signals so she could pause before panic grew teeth. [510]  
When the buzzing returned, she did not wait for it to conquer her; she walked to the pavilion, stood by the lens, and let the light gather until the pearl of stillness formed again. [544]  
The drone was only a gull beating its wings close to the glass, and Mina smiled once, because realism could include the fact that not every shadow carried a missile. [574]  
As evening fog rolled in over the now-dark lighthouse, she helped label the new plantings in two scripts, and beside each name she added a date, not a wish, so future caretakers could measure survival without lying. [611]  
Before leaving she tucked the crumpled photograph into a small waterproof box at the base of the cypress, a marker for herself as much as for the dead, and promised to return tomorrow to translate, to breathe, and to keep growing in public. [654]</story>
