<story>After time became visible, it draped the void in thin, colored strata that slid across skin and stone like slow auroras. [21] On the baroque asteroid Palimpsest, where gilded buttresses were bolted to iron craters, those strata pooled in every corridor and made each hour a thing you could trip over. [50] Len Orest, once a revolutionary who had tried to topple the old Consortium and now lived as a defunct relic of that failed fire, walked the museum quarter with a poet's habit of naming shadows. [85] He carried in his pocket a crystal vase shard, no larger than a fingernail, found in a sealed alcove where visible time hung thick as honey and preserved a pattern of lilies. [117] The shard was evidence, or bait, depending on which faction you asked, and the archaeological dispute over the asteroid's buried court had already split scholars into warring salons. [145] Professor Yara Seld of the Imperial Academy insisted the court belonged to the Consortium's ancestors and should be restored as an emblem, while the Free Diggers claimed it predated every charter and must be reimagined, not embalmed. [182] Len had joined the Diggers not for their slogans but for their longing, because after his revolution collapsed he could no longer bear monuments that told only one story. [211] In the evening he met Yara in the Mirror Gallery, a nave of glass panels set between carved cherubs, and the visible time outside flashed in the coming storm, striking the mirrors like thrown coins. [246] She wanted his shard for her catalog, and he wanted her seal to access the sealed alcoves, so they spoke with careful courtesy that could not hide grief for the civilization both of them had never met. [283] Yara argued that the shard's lilies matched murals in the Academy vaults, proof the court was merely an outpost, but Len heard in its cut edges a different cadence, a poem of exile. [316] When the storm broke, the strata of visible time turned violent, and every mirror began to show not faces but branching futures, each one a corridor to an interpretation. [345] Len had devised a method for such nights from his days in prison, when guards used mirrors to drive rebels mad, and he covered the gallery mirrors with velvet drops to make the room mercifully dark. [381] Yara watched him work, surprised by the gentleness of the gesture, and the two of them listened to the storm scrape the asteroid's ornamented hull like a bow on tarnished brass. [412] In that hush Len confessed why he clung to the Diggers' dream: he was trying to reimagine an entire civilization, not to claim it, but to give it room to breathe beyond the Consortium's slogans and his own. [450] Yara, who had lost a sister to the same revolution that had made Len famous and then useless, replied that she wanted restoration because chaos had already stolen too much. [480] They opened the velvet just enough to let one mirror breathe, and in it the visible time showed the sealed alcove as it had been, with a crystal vase intact on a table beside a map of star routes. [519] The map was the missing piece in the dispute, because it marked Palimpsest not as an outpost but as a meeting ground where rival dynasties traded art to avoid war. [549] Len realized the shard in his pocket had been broken on purpose, a ritual of choosing many futures over one, and his burnished sorrow for his failed uprising softened into resolve. [580] If Yara published the map alone, the Academy would claim the court as proof of imperial mercy, yet if the Diggers hid it, they would turn it into another weapon, and the old mistake would repeat. [616] So he and Yara devised a third act, an exhibition staged in the open crater plaza during the next storm, with all mirrors in the district covered so no one could steal certainty from the branching visions. [653] Instead they projected the map through layers of visible time itself, letting the strata blur its borders, while Len read a poem that named every faction as a necessary fragment, the way a vase becomes more honest when broken. [692] People left the plaza arguing still, but arguing differently, as if the asteroid's baroque stonework had shifted by a fraction, and Len, defunct revolutionary and unwilling curator, finally felt the civilization inside the shard begin to live.
