<story>After the card-flicking conjurer's final flourish failed, the crowd's laughter turned to ash and the lake wind carried it into silence. [21]The mirror he had promised would show our hidden sins only reflected fog and a single bruise-colored moon, and in that humiliation the curse on Lake Kestrel tightened. [49]I was Thalen, a guarded druid of the reed clans, trained for war yet sworn to keep my voice calm as a drawn blade. [73]They called me Finder because lost things drifted toward my steps: missing oars, swallowed rings, even names people forgot to say aloud. [95]Tonight, what found me was a seed in a wet velvet pouch, labeled in the conjurer's shaky hand: FLESH-EATING PLANT, DO NOT PLANT. [118]He pressed it into my palm as guards hauled him away, and he mouthed, as if to a mirror, that the trick failed because the truth was frozen. [146]A frozen confession, he meant, locked beneath the cursed lake where the orchard of drowned trees spun like a storm around a hole in the world. [172]I wanted that confession not to judge him, but to discover what mirrors do not show: the face of the hand that holds them, and the bargain behind every reflection. [202]At dawn I rowed alone to the lake's center, where the water turned in widening rings and the air smelled of apples that never ripened. [227]There, a swirling orchard vortex rose from the surface, branches circling in disciplined fury, and between them glinted shards of mirrors taken from every home the curse touched. [255]I anchored my boat on a knot of roots, breathed the warlike serenity my teachers drilled into me, and began the old method of entry: through expanding circles. [283]With a reed staff I traced one ring on the water, then another, each larger, each humming, until the vortex matched my rhythm and opened a path down. [311]Cold seized my lungs as I descended, and under the spinning orchard I found an ice coffin wedged in silt, its lid a mirror bent like a scowling face. [340]The confession inside was not words but a man, the conjurer's twin, mouth open mid-apology, breath halted in crystal, hands strapped to keep him from clawing out. [367]Around him lay the curse's machinery: mirror shards forming a cage, and in the center, an unplanted seed identical to the one in my pocket, already sprouting teeth. [395]I understood then why lost things came to me; the lake was stealing them to feed this plant, and the mirrors were only bait to make us look away from our missing. [427]To free the frozen confession, I had to unbend the mirror-lid, not with force, but by reversing the circles I had drawn, shrinking them in my mind until the glass remembered straightness. [459]When it straightened, the twin's eyes moved, and his apology poured out as bubbles that became syllables in my head: he had planted the first seed in vanity, to make mirrors show only beauty. [493]But the plant hungered for what the mirror hid, so it ate flesh, then memories, and finally the conjurer tried a stage trick to confess without confessing, which doomed them both. [524]I pushed my pouch-seed into the mirror cage, letting two hungers meet, and sang the druid war-chant in a calm voice until the sprouts chewed each other into stillness. [553]The vortex above faltered, orchard branches slowing as if saluting, and the lake released a tide of lost things that rose around me like offerings in widening rings. [581]I carried the thawing twin toward the surface, and in every floating shard I saw not my face, but the dark water behind it, honest at last about what it refused to show. [614]Back on shore, the guards waited with spears, yet I stood between them and the conjurer, serene as a shield wall, because the confession had been paid for with years of ice. [646]I told them the mirrors were innocent tools, that the real enemy was the wish to be seen without being known, and I returned every recovered item to its owner in expanding circles of gratitude. [681]When the conjurer finally faced the lake and spoke his own confession aloud, no trick, no glass, just breath, the orchard stopped swirling, and the cursed water lay flat as polished stone.
