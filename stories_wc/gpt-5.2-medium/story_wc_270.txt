<story>During the reconstruction, the new council laid stone roads over ash and called it peace. [15]  
Nara, my grandmother, watched from a scaffold with the calm of an insurgent who had survived her own victory. [34]  
She kept her gray hair braided tight, as if every strand still carried coded orders from the old tunnels. [53]  
Our village clung to the volcanic hot springs, where steam rose in curtains and the ground hummed like a drum. [73]  
The springs had always been sacred, and tradition said nothing sealed there should ever be opened. [89]  
Nara had followed tradition once, and it nearly turned her into a weapon. [102]  
When she was young, the priests pressed a thin crystal into her skin and spoke of implanted destiny, a path chosen before breath. [125]  
The crystal did not guide her; it commanded her, and she rebelled, starting the insurgency that burned the old temple. [145]  
Now, in the peace she had helped win, she wanted to evolve tradition with intent, not let it evolve people by accident. [167]  
I learned that desire the day she sent me to gather reeds at the spring edge and I heard the reeds answer. [189]  
Their voices were not words, more like sensations of thirst and sunlight, but they were aimed at me. [207]  
I ran to Nara and confessed I was accidentally telepathic with plants, and she did not look surprised. [225]  
She led me behind the bath house to a slope of black rock where lichens spelled slow warnings into my mind. [246]  
Under the rock, she said, the priests had hidden their last relic, and the plants had been listening for decades. [266]  
The relic was an embryo in amber, sealed before the war, meant to hatch into the next oracle of destiny. [286]  
Nara believed the embryo carried a program like her crystal, only deeper, a life with a future written inside it. [306]  
She would unseal it, but only after understanding the script that controlled it. [319]  
For weeks the springs were crowded with masons and healers, and above them children flew kites from salvaged cloth. [338]  
One evening a storm twisted in from the caldera and left an abandoned kite snagged in a tamarisk tree. [357]  
The tamarisk trembled with relief when I touched it, and it urged me to take the kite tail. [375]  
On the tail, stitched in soot colored thread, ran a cryptic script that made my eyes sting. [392]  
Nara spread the tail on a flat stone and asked the moss to read with me, because moss remembers patterns. [412]  
As I traced each symbol, the moss sent impressions of old chants, and the reeds supplied missing beats like punctuation. [432]  
Together we decoded the message: a sequence of heat and silence, steps for opening amber without shattering what slept inside. [452]  
The last line was a warning that the embryo would imprint on the first will it sensed, completing its implanted destiny. [473]  
Nara stared into the steam and said, softly, that was why the priests used newborns, because newborns have no will yet. [494]  
She would not feed it emptiness, and she would not let it feed on conquest, so she chose me as witness and counterweight. [517]  
At dawn we carried the amber to the hottest pool, where sulfur bubbled and the stone lip burned our palms. [537]  
Following the decoded steps, Nara held it above the water for seven breaths, then lowered it into steam, then into shade. [558]  
The amber clouded, unsealed along a seam like a mouth opening, and the embryo glowed pale green, searching. [576]  
I felt the plants around us lean in, and through them I felt the embryo reach, not for command, but for a story. [599]  
Nara spoke her story into the steam: that tradition was a tool, that destiny must be chosen, and that life should serve repair. [622]  
The embryo pulsed, and the vines on the rocks echoed the pulse back to me like approval. [639]  
When the amber finally fell away, what rose from Nara's hands was not an oracle, but a small salamander bright as spring leaves. [662]  
It blinked at the broken temple on the ridge, then at the new road, and it crawled toward the garden beds where workers grew food. [687]  
Nara laughed once, surprised, and I understood her intent had rewritten the script more than any rebellion could. [705]  
In the months that followed, the salamander lived in the hot spring channels and kept the water clean, and people called it the Rebuilder. [729]  
Nara taught the children to fly kites again, not as omens, but as messages to be decoded together, so no destiny would be implanted alone. [754]
