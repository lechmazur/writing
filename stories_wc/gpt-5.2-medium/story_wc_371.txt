<story>After the birds flew south, the city grew quiet in a way Mina could not ignore.[16] She was a creeping normality noticer, trained by boredom and grief to notice what everyone else called normal.[34] Streetlights had shifted from warm to white, patrols had gained new badges, and familiar shop signs vanished between one week and the next.[57] The loss that stung most was the bakery on Alder Row, whose ovens once scented her walk to work.[76] One morning the door was bricked over, and the next morning no one admitted there had ever been a bakery there.[97] Mina kept the last loaf she had bought, bread from the vanished bakery, wrapped in cloth like a relic.[116] It had gone hard, but its crust still held the faintest sweetness, a proof that memory could be edible.[135] Her motive was simple enough to sound foolish: to find the sacred in the ordinary before the ordinary was edited away.[156] A paper slip left under her door offered a place where old things were still served, if she came after dusk.[177] It named no address, only a sketch of a palace gate and a teacup drawn inside a courtyard of vines.[197] The palace had been closed since the ministers moved their offices to glass towers, and the courtyards had been left to weeds.[219] On a cold evening she followed the sketch, slipped through a gap in the gate, and found lantern light trembling among fig trees.[242] In the overgrown palace courtyard a secret tea house had taken root under a collapsed arcade, its tables made from salvaged doors.[264] The woman at the kettle greeted Mina as if she had been expected, her voice heuristically gentle, always testing what kindness might work.[287] Call me Sada, she said, and drink first, then speak.[297] Tea warmed Mina's hands while Sada watched her eyes track the small violations in the courtyard: a missing statue, a newly painted slogan, the trimmed roses.[323] You see what changes by inches, Sada said, and that makes you useful here.[337] Useful for what, Mina asked, ashamed that she had only watched while neighbors learned to keep their heads down.[356] Sada led her to the far wall where planters were hidden behind broken marble, and she revealed packets of seeds and a trowel.[379] We work through guerrilla gardening, she said, because flowers can occupy a space before laws do.[395] Each night we plant herbs and wheat in the cracks, and each week someone in uniform has to decide whether to uproot them.[418] The choice slows the machine, and it also reminds us that mercy still has a shape.[434] Mina unwrapped her cloth bundle and set the hard loaf on the table, and the tea house fell briefly silent.[454] This is bread from the vanished bakery, she said, and I do not know why I kept it except that I could not bear one more erasure.[481] Sada broke off a piece, chewed slowly, and her eyes shone as if the crust had named an old prayer.[501] There are altars everywhere, Mina, Sada said, but they are covered, and we spend our lives choosing what to uncloak.[521] She pointed to a tarp draped over the missing statue's plinth, and together they pulled it back to reveal a cracked fountain bowl.[544] Inside, someone had planted thyme and tiny white flowers, and the water that no longer ran smelled clean anyway.[563] Mina confessed then that months ago she had signed a complaint about the bakery's smoke, thinking it would bring an inspection, not a disappearance.[587] She had told herself it was harmless, and that lie had been the first brick in the wall.[605] Sada listened without flinching, and offered no grand forgiveness, only a slice of the old bread dipped in tea.[624] This is tenuous absolution, she said, not a clean pardon, but a chance to repair what your hands can reach tonight.[645] So Mina knelt in the courtyard dirt, tucked wheat seeds into the fountain's rim, and felt the palace breathe as if it remembered harvests.[669] When footsteps scraped beyond the gate, the tea house went dark, yet the new plantings remained, small green arguments against forgetting.[690] Days later, as winter tightened, Mina walked past the bricked bakery and saw a single sprout pushing through mortar, and she bowed to it.[714]</story>
