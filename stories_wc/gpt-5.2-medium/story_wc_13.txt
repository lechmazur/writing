<story>Rin Vale drew beetles for the city museum, a natural history illustrator with ink-stained fingers and sharp eyes. [18] From her studio she could see the rooftop canal system weaving between towers like a silver ribbon laid on stone. [38] Boats slid there instead of streets, because the ground below belonged to the sleeping Giant of Vare. [55] When he napped, the towers stayed upright; when he stirred, whole districts sagged and canals spilled. [71] Rin planned her days across a giant's nap, measuring errands by the slow rise and fall of his chest. [90] Around her neck hung an infinity symbol pendant, a cheap brass loop she had found in a specimen drawer. [109] It warmed whenever she heard a sound repeat itself, even faintly, as if the metal listened for its own return. [129] She wore it because she wanted what her sketches could never pin down: the place where echoes are born. [148] The museum's acoustics were dead, and the canal air swallowed voices, but the pendant promised there was still a source. [168] Old boatmen spoke of Echo-Forges, chambers that shaped a call the way a smith shaped iron. [184] No map showed them, and every tale ended in an interrupted cadence, a sudden stop before the final note of directions. [205] Rin suspected the missing resolution was not forgetfulness but a lock. [216] The key, she learned, belonged to Master Orren, the city's unofficial keeper of time. [230] Orren lived atop the highest tower, where canals met in a ring and the wind kept strict tempo. [248] His workshop was open to the sky, cluttered with hourglasses, metronomes, and clay that moved under its own accord. [267] When Rin arrived, Orren was kneading that clay into a miniature canal, and the water in it flowed backward. [286] He did not deny the rumor that he sculpted time itself; he demonstrated by pinching the air until Rin's next breath delayed. [308] She steadied herself, then showed the pendant and asked about echoes and the broken endings in every story. [326] Orren set a metronome ticking and said, 'The Echo-Forge is caged inside the Giant's throat, and no song can finish there.' [348] He explained that the Giant's nap held the city in a suspended bar of music, always leading to a chord that never lands. [371] To reach the forge, Rin would have to uncage it, and to do that she would need time the nap did not give. [394] Orren offered a method: by borrowing time from small, harmless moments and paying them back later with interest. [412] He pressed her pendant into the clay canal, and the brass loops sank like hooks into the current. [430] 'This will hold what you borrow,' he said, 'but it will also remember what you owe.' [447] Rin left at once, poling a narrow boat along the rooftop canals toward the Giant's sleeping face, which filled the horizon like a hill. [471] She sketched as she traveled, not for beauty but to mark repeating shapes, certain that echoes began as patterns. [490] At the tower nearest his jaw, ladders descended into a vent where warm breath rose in slow drafts. [508] The metronome tick Orren had started still seemed to follow her, but it kept slipping, like a drummer missing beats. [528] In that broken rhythm she felt the city's interrupted cadence, and she realized she could hide her thefts in the gaps. [549] She touched the pendant and stole a second from the drip of condensation, then another from the pause before her next step. [571] The loops grew hot, and the air around her thickened, granting her extra heartbeats without waking the Giant. [589] Down in the throat chamber she found iron bars set in stone, and behind them a dark pool that held every sound the city had lost. [615] When she whispered her own name, it returned to her layered and luminous, like a flock of birds turning at once. [636] The lock on the cage was not a keyhole but a cadence, a sequence of stresses that demanded a final resolving beat. [658] Rin borrowed more time, stretching the moment between inhale and exhale until she could tap the pattern on the bars with her pencil. [681] The last tap should have closed the phrase, yet she deliberately broke it, letting the interrupted cadence hang, and the bars swung open in answer. [706] From the pool rose a clear, child-sized figure made of reverberation, and it looked at her pendant as if it recognized its looped shape. [730] Rin understood then that echoes are born where endings are refused, and as the Giant sighed toward waking, she ferried the freed echo into the canals, already counting how she would repay the stolen seconds.
