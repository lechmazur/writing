<story>Between childhood and now, I have lived in the seam where one world subtitles the other. [16]  
People call me a between-worlds translator, but to me it is listening until meaning takes shape, elusively tangible like mist that still wets your hands. [41]  
When I was eight, my mother led me to the alchemist's market strung high above the city rooftops, a web of catwalks under laundry lines and copper chimneys. [69]  
She translated herbs into remedies for neighbors who could not afford doctors, and she taught me that overlooked histories are the ones that keep us from falling. [96]  
Before we left that day, an old vendor pressed a lighthouse lens fragment into my palm and said, in a dialect I did not know yet, Hold on to your anchors of intuition. [129]  
I did not understand, but the shard caught sunlight and split it into a quiet rainbow that seemed to stop time in a single eternal instant. [155]  
Years later, after my mother died and the city renamed its streets for new patrons, the market remained, still swaying above roofs like a memory that refused to be archived. [185]  
I returned with my translator's satchel and the lens fragment wrapped in cloth, because I had found a crack between worlds that opened only there, at dusk. [212]  
A series of paintings hung along the highest walkway, portraits of workers and keepers no one mentioned in official histories, and the air around them thrummed with untranslated speech. [241]  
I had learned that passages in the seam answer not to maps but to intuition, and intuition needs anchors: objects that remember for you when your mind doubts. [269]  
The vendor's shard was my anchor, but it had begun to darken, as if someone on the other side was unfastening its light. [292]  
To honor the people in those paintings, I needed to keep the seam open long enough to hear their names, then carry the names back where they could be spoken. [322]  
The trick, my mother once whispered, is to read through hidden details in paintings, because artists hide doors where censors never look. [344]  
I lifted the lens fragment to my eye and examined the first portrait, and the glass revealed a tiny spiral of blue in the subject's button, painted with impossible precision. [374]  
When I traced the spiral with my fingertip, the paint warmed, and a second city flashed behind the canvas, all drowned stone and low stars. [399]  
A voice spoke in the drowned city's salt language, and I translated aloud, tasting each word as it turned into our air: We kept the lighthouse when the council forgot. [429]  
In the next painting, a woman held a lantern, and the lens fragment showed her shadow wearing a crown of hooks, pointing toward a bolted hatch beneath the walkway. [458]  
I knelt, slid my fingers into the seam of the hatch, and unfasten the rusted latch with a twist that felt older than my bones. [483]  
Cold light breathed up, and the market sounds fell away, replaced by the hush of waves against a tower I could not see but somehow remembered. [509]  
Down the ladder was a room of stored canvases, each stamped REJECTED, and in the center lay the missing half of my lens, set into a frame like an eye. [539]  
As I fitted my fragment to it, the joined glass flared, and for an eternal instant I stood in both cities at once, hearing the rejected painters recite names of keepers, migrants, and herbalists. [573]  
I spoke the names into my own world, translating them into street corners and school lessons, and when the light finally dimmed, the seam held steady, anchored by intuition and by the histories no one could overlook again. [611]
