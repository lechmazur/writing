<story>On Pomaria, the orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, the sky was a hard azure and the ground smelled of bruised fruit after every tremor. [26] Lio was the meek blacksmith of Crate Hollow, a quiet man whose hands could bend iron but whose voice rarely rose above the hush of leaves. [52] When the arches began shedding rubble into the orchards, he set his only clear desire against the panic: to coax resilience from rubble before the trees starved. [79] He worked deliberately, forging clamps and rings, yet each repair failed because the stone itself seemed asleep, crumbling like bread under his hammer. [102] A traveling magician arrived at dusk, stepping from a cart of windblown petals, and unfurled a length of magician's silk that gleamed blue as the upper air. [129] The magician said the silk could wake what was sleeping, but awakenings on Pomaria were never free; they were bartered, traded between breath and stone. [154] Lio, quietly determined despite his meekness, offered three iron orchard hooks and his best chisel in exchange for a single narrow strip. [176] He did not understand what else he was giving until the magician tied the silk around his wrist and Lio felt a memory loosen, slipping into confusion. [203] It was a strange timeframe, between understanding and confusion, where he knew he had lost something but could not name it, like a fruit you taste only after it is gone. [234] The silk led him, tugging when he walked near the abandoned mine shafts under the floating arches, shafts that once fed the town with ore and now breathed dust. [263] He descended alone, lantern in one hand, the other wrapped in the magician's silk, and the deeper he went the more the rock ceiling shimmered like a sleeping eye. [292] At the lowest chamber he found piles of collapsed supports and scattered stones, and he placed the silk on the largest boulder as if laying a bandage. [319] The boulder warmed, then spoke in a slow grind, telling him the arches were failing because their old anchors had been mined away and their roots no longer touched the planet. [350] In return for that knowledge, the silk tightened and another slice of his memory was taken, leaving him with a blank where his mother's name should have been. [378] Anger tried to rise, but he shaped it into azure defiance, a calm blue flame, and he began planning how to forge new anchors from the very rubble that had fallen. [409] Using abandoned mine shafts as hidden workshops, he dragged broken stone down, smelted salvaged ore from the walls, and hammered the mixture into ribbed rods that could bite rock. [438] Each night he wrapped the magician's silk around a rod, asked the sleeping boulder to wake just enough to teach him, and paid with more of himself. [465] The bartered awakenings changed him: he forgot songs and faces, but he gained a map of unseen stresses in the arches and a sense of where new roots could be planted. [496] When he finally climbed to the orchard surface, he moved with deliberate care among falling shadows, driving the rods into cracks and stitching stone to stone with the silk. [525] The first arch steadied, its underside glowing like dawn through leaves, and the trees below stopped shedding unripe fruit, as if the planet itself had taken a fuller breath. [554] The magician returned to collect what he was owed, but found Lio standing under the repaired arch, empty eyed yet unbowed, offering the silk back with a shake of his head. [585] Lio had learned that resilience was not a trick to purchase but a craft to practice, so he kept the strip only long enough to wake the last stones, then buried it in the mine where it could cost no one else. [627] With his memories thinned to a few bright tools, he returned to his forge and listened to the orchards, letting their quiet grow into the new names he would someday deserve. [658]</story>
