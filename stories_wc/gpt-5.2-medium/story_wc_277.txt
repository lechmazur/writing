After the journalist called, Celeste Marrow listened to the rain tick on her penthouse skylight and said, gently, "Tell me the part you cannot print." [25]
She was the newsprint heiress, owner of the Marrow Daily, but she had learned that ink could also hide. [44]
She had come not for fame but to discover hidden truths. [55]
Lyle Benton, her best reporter, spoke of an observatory above the clouds where the director swore he had found a new planet. [77]
The story would sell papers, he said, yet his voice carried the small tremor of a man who had seen something wrong. [99]
Celeste, devotedly observant by habit and by inheritance, heard that tremor and felt an orbit of regret begin to pull at her. [121]
Her father had built the newspaper on exposing fraud, then died after printing an accusation that later proved untrue. [140]
Since then she treated every headline like a planet: beautiful, distant, and dangerous if you miscalculated its path. [158]
She told Lyle she would come herself, and she packed only a coat, a notebook, and a rosewood pen nib her father had carved. [182]
The nib did not fit any pen anymore, but she carried it as a promise that writing should cut clean. [202]
Two hours later a cable car lifted her past pine and rock into a white sea, and the mountain observatory floated like a ship. [226]
Inside, every footstep returned in echoes from the domed halls, as if the building rehearsed her doubts aloud. [244]
Director Sato greeted her with practiced wonder and offered cocoa in a mug stamped with moons. [260]
His solemn face tried for playfulness, but his jokes about cosmic traffic sounded memorized. [274]
He led her to the main telescope where star charts hung like laundry and pointed to a faint smear on a glass plate. [297]
"That is Kalliope," he said, naming the supposed planet, "and its orbit proves it must exist." [313]
Celeste smiled as if charmed, yet she watched his hands, the way he avoided touching the plate at its edge. [333]
Lyle met her later in the corridor and slipped her a photocopy of Sato's calculations, whispering that numbers were being redone at night. [356]
She laughed softly, because conspiracies always sounded like pulp serials, and then she grew quiet because pulp could still kill. [376]
In her room she set the rosewood nib beside the equations and began to test Sato's claim through proof by contradiction. [397]
If Kalliope's orbit matched the smear, she reasoned, then the timing of the plate exposures could not overlap with the maintenance logs. [419]
But they did overlap, which meant either the logs were false or the smear was made when the telescope was supposedly blind. [441]
She traced each contradiction as if it were a small moon tugging at a larger lie, and she felt her own regrets circling close. [465]
At dawn she asked Sato to show her the darkroom, pretending she wanted the romance of chemicals and starlight. [484]
He obliged, and the echoing observatory above clouds seemed to hold its breath while red lamps painted their faces. [503]
On a shelf she spotted a box of glass plates labeled with last month's date, yet the dust on top was fresh, not settled. [527]
Sato followed her gaze, and his expression flickered into the same guilty look her father wore in old photographs. [546]
He confessed, not to inventing a planet, but to shifting the exposure times so his grant committee would not discover he had damaged the lens. [571]
A cracked lens would end the program, and he had already lost a colleague in an accident for which he blamed himself. [593]
His new planet was an orbit of regret: he kept it spinning so he would not have to face the still center of that death. [618]
Celeste could have marched the confession to Lyle and printed it, but she saw how the observatory would collapse and take honest work with it. [643]
So she chose to intervene, the way editors once intervened in her father's mistakes, by forcing the truth to survive without spectacle. [665]
She offered Sato a bargain: he would file a quiet report admitting the lens damage, and the paper would run a story on funding, not miracles. [691]
To make it airtight, she wrote the plan with the rosewood nib scratching directly into his logbook, and she showed him her contradictions like courtroom exhibits. [717]
If he denied the damage, her notes proved the smear could not be planetary, and if he denied the notes, the plates proved the logs false, so honesty became his only consistent orbit. [750]
When Celeste called Lyle back, her tone was solemn playfulness, as if she were teasing a headline into behaving. [769]
"No planet," she said, "but plenty of truth, and it will keep us busy for years," and the echoes of the observatory sounded almost like applause. [795]
