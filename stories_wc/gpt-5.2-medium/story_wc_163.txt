<story>Mira Lorne called herself a landscape astrologer, because she read tides, dunes, and ruined skylines the way other people read constellations. [21]The job had brought her down through a service shaft into the forgotten underwater city research facility, where glass corridors still held pockets of breath against the surrounding sea. [50]She carried only a slate of charts, a coil of line, and a burnt feather sealed in wax paper that smelled faintly of smoke and salt. [76]The feather was her warrant from the Surface Council, proof that a seabird had died over this place the night the facility went dark, as if the sky itself had marked it. [108]Inside, emergency lamps had long since failed, yet the rooms were not wholly black; screens leaked cold algae-blue, and small jellies drifted in ceiling cracks like slow thoughts. [136]Mira moved with softly ingenious care, tapping walls to map hollow spaces, listening to how the building answered, until the echoes aligned into a pattern she could trust. [164]At the central atrium, she found a man in a patched pressure suit tending a garden of air plants under a cracked dome, and he watched her as if she were another specimen. [197]His name, he said, was Jonah Ates, last technician on the roster, and he had stayed because leaving felt like admitting the city had truly been forgotten. [224]Mira told him she was here until sunrise, when the Council's skiff would return, and that she needed one night to see what rhythms still lived beneath the drowned streets. [254]Jonah laughed without sound, then offered her tea brewed from condensed vapor, a small civility that made the facility feel briefly like a home rather than a tomb. [282]She asked about the night it failed, and he led her through shadowseamed hallways to a lab where a mural of the old skyline had been painted for researchers who missed the surface. [315]On the bench sat a terrarium sealed with rusted clamps, and inside, in dry moss, lay dozens of firefly pupae preserved by the city's last botanist. [341]Jonah admitted he could not bring himself to open it, because the first fireflies of summer had always meant his family was together, and here he had no one to share them with. [374]Mira unfolded her charts and, instead of stars, traced the faint bioluminescent algae currents outside the windows, showing him how they pulsed in cycles like a submerged zodiac. [402]She said she had wandered from coast to coast to learn the rhythm of belonging, and every place had taught her that you did not find a constellation alone; you found it by pointing together. [437]To prove it, she placed the burnt feather on the lab table, and its charred barbules caught the algae-light so that a thin silver line appeared, like a compass needle aimed at the dome. [471]Jonah, captivated despite himself, followed her up through maintenance ladders until they reached the cracked dome, where the water above made moving stars of reflected streetlights from the surface. [500]Mira loosened the terrarium clamps with a hairpin and a twist of line, her softly ingenious hands steady even as distant pressure groaned at the seams. [526]When she lifted the lid, warm air rose, and she and Jonah took a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer as they woke, spiraling up in gentle green loops beneath the dome. [560]The lights did not erase the darkness outside, but they stitched it, turning the facility into a place of shadowseam wonder, where each glow made room for the next. [589]In that luminous respite, Jonah confessed he had been counting days like bolts, tightening them against loneliness, and that he feared sunrise because it would pull her away. [617]Mira answered that sunrise was only a boundary if you stood still, and she asked him to walk the drowned streets with her, reading the algae-zodiac until the skiff arrived. [647]They descended with the fireflies cupped in a lantern jar, and as they moved, Mira pointed to pulses in the water and Jonah matched them with old street names, their voices making a new map. [682]By the time dawn brightened the surface into a pale coin above the dome, the burnt feather lay between them like a quiet oath, and Mira finally felt belonging beat in time with another heart.
