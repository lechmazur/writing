<story>When the last speakers of Vey were still alive, Ilen walked the canyon of endless echoes called Resounding, where towers of bone rose like ruined organs.[26]He was a copper-veined storyteller, skin threaded with metallic lines that caught the pale light and made listeners think of maps.[47]Quietly articulate, he never raised his voice, because the canyon returned every shout as a thousand mangled copies.[65]Between two of the bone towers lay a slit in the rock, the tunnel of echoes, where a whisper could be held, bent, and made to sing.[92]In his pouch he carried a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed, cloudy at its heart and chipped along one edge as if something had bitten it.[119]He had not taken it for wealth, but because its imperfections caught vibrations the way clean gems could not.[138]Across the death of a language, he had promised the elders he would keep Vey from falling into pure silence.[158]Their words were made for touch, for grain and pressure, and his one obsession was to translate texture into sound before no mouths remained.[182]The elders could still speak, but each season their consonants softened, as if time was sanding them down.[200]Ilen believed the canyon itself could be a throat for the dying tongue, if he learned to harness its echoing chambers.[221]On the morning the oldest speaker, Toma, could no longer name the difference between velvet and bark, Ilen led him to the tunnel.[244]They stood where wind funneled through ribs of stone, and Ilen placed the diamond on Toma's palm, asking him to stroke its chipped edge.[268]The old man touched it, and a dry rasp rose from the gem, as though it had stored a hundred unspoken syllables.[290]Ilen listened, then pressed the diamond against the tunnel wall and whispered the Vey word for roughness, letting the echo multiply until it matched the rasp.[316]That was when the curse showed itself, not as bad luck but as hunger, pulling the sound deeper into the tunnel until even Ilen's thoughts seemed to repeat.[344]If he let the diamond feed on voices unchecked, it would swallow the language faster than death could.[362]To control it, he watched the canyon sky, where flocks of ash-gray swifts crossed between bone towers in shifting lattices.[382]Vey had words for those patterns, verbs that described a curve, a stutter, a sudden braid, and Ilen had recorded them on strips of hide.[407]Through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, he found measures for the echoes, timing his whispers to the swifts' turns as if conducting.[433]When the flock tightened, he spoke the word for silk, and when it scattered, he spoke the word for grit, and the tunnel answered in distinct textures of sound.[462]The diamond vibrated in his hand like an eager mouth, but the bird-led rhythm held it, harnessing its hunger into resonance instead of erasure.[486]Day after day he brought speakers to the tunnel, not to memorize a list, but to rub stone, bone, hide, and water, and let Vey name what they felt.[515]As their throats failed, the canyon kept their meanings, layered in the rock as harmonics, so that even children who had never heard fluent Vey could sense it.[543]But on the night Toma died, the swifts did not fly, and the tunnel filled with unpatterned repeats that threatened to make every word the same dull note.[571]Ilen entered alone, laid his ear to the wall, and spoke the final phrase Toma had taught him, a sentence that meant, Listen to what you touch.[598]He set the flawed diamond in a crack and, using his own copper-veined fingers as a tuning fork, scraped the bone floor until the vibrations matched the memory of Toma's voice.[629]Outside, a late flock finally rose from the dark canyon, and their wings drew a slow spiral, the old Vey sign for return.[652]Ilen aligned his breathing to that spiral and let the tunnel of echoes carry his words, each one shaped by the birds' geometry, until the cacophony separated into clear strands.[682]The diamond flashed once, then went still, its curse sated by the structured chorus, and the walls answered with a new voice that was neither Toma's nor Ilen's alone.[711]Years later, when no living person could speak Vey from birth, travelers still came to the bone towers, brushed their hands along the rock, and heard the canyon translate them.[741]They said a copper-veined storyteller had built a library without pages, harnessing echoes and a cursed gem so texture could survive as sound, even after the language died.[769]</story>
