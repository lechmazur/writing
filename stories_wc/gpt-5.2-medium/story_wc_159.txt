<story>In the opal library above clouds, I was the glass-orchid caretaker, tending vitrified petals that held tiny prisms of breath for readers who never came.[25] The shelves glimmered like wet stone, but the aisles were a corridor of deserted marvels, maps to cities erased, dolls of saints, and clocks still measuring yesterday.[52] Every dawn I worked gently systematic, checking each orchid for cracks, polishing its stem, and recording in a ledger the name it was meant to remember.[78] My motive was simple and heavy: to preserve the sound of forgotten names, so that when the library finally reopened, someone could speak them without shame.[104] Names here were not ink; they were tones, stored in the orchids, and released only when I could light the crystal at their cores by the echo of a long-forgotten song.[135] That song had once drifted through the museum of extinct feelings, a neighboring wing where exhibits of grief, devotion, and first joy slept under dusted glass.[161] Now the melody arrived in scraps, because the wind chime that called it down from the rafters had a bamboo tube cracked clean through, leaving its notes to stutter.[190] Without the full chord, I could not light half the orchids, and their names stayed mute, a kind of foxglove regret blooming in my throat each time I passed them.[220] I climbed ladders to examine the chime, saw the split, and knew repair would require an older piece of bamboo from the museum wing, from an exhibit labeled Last Lullaby.[250] Across the museum of extinct feelings I went, carrying my oil lamp, my ledger, and a pouch of orchid dust, moving between cases where emotions were archived like insects.[279] In the Hall of Apologies, a diorama of two figures forever turning away made the air sweet and poisonous, and I almost dropped the lamp as old words tried to return.[310] I steadied myself with the routine I trusted, counting steps, breathing in fours, and listening for the broken chime's rhythm in my memory as if it were a compass.[339] The deeper galleries held deserted marvels too: a fountain that poured upward into nothing, a theater curtain that rose on an empty stage, and a cabinet of unclaimed wedding rings.[369] At Last Lullaby, the case was ajar, and inside lay a bundle of bamboo tubes tied with hair, each tube carved with a name I could no longer pronounce.[398] When I lifted one, the long-forgotten song answered faintly from the ceiling, and the lamp in my hand flared, as if it recognized the timber of the past.[426] I understood then that the chime had not merely been damaged; it had been grieving, and the crack was the place where an unsaid goodbye had lodged.[453] Back in the library, I replaced the broken tube with the carved one, wrapped the join in silk, and hung it so it could swing freely in the draft.[482] At twilight I lit the lamp, struck the chime, and waited, and the song came whole at last, pouring through opal arches and into every glass-orchid like rain.[510] One by one the orchids brightened, each crystal catching fire by the echo of a long-forgotten song, and the names rose in clear tones that filled the empty aisles with company.[541] I wrote them as I heard them, not to own them but to keep them moving, and when the last tone faded I felt the foxglove regret soften into something almost like gratitude.[574] Beyond the windows, cloudbanks rolled like slow surf, and I imagined future visitors climbing to this height, finding the deserted marvels tended, and hearing their own ancestors answered from glass.[604] Until then I would keep my rounds, gently systematic, lighting what I could, mending what broke, and letting the repaired chime call names back into the world, one clean note at a time.[637]</story>
