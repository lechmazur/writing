On the ancient terrace at midsummer, Sera Talan waited for the delegations, watching lantern smoke curl into the violet air. [20]
She had been a forever war peace negotiator so long that her hair had forgotten its original color, yet she still arrived early, as if timeliness could mend history. [49]
In her hands was an ebony clipboard, polished by years of signatures and refusals, and it felt heavier tonight than any weapon. [71]
The terrace belonged to ruins older than either army, and its cracked mosaics pictured constellations shifting, a reminder that power moved during the slow dance of celestial bodies. [99]
Sera had chosen this place because ritual significance could do what threats could not, turning simple steps into shared meaning. [119]
To anchor ideals in practice, she needed both sides to perform the old solstice oath, not just sign a paper that would be burned by the next commander. [147]
Her style was operatively gentle, a patience trained into discipline, but gentleness did not mean softness about consequences. [165]
Years ago she had helped plan a corridor evacuation that turned into a massacre when the convoy was shelled, and the dead visited her whenever negotiations stalled. [192]
Since then, every treaty felt like a chance at redemption, and every chance carried a price she could not predict. [212]
The first delegation arrived from the River League, boots dusted with salt, led by Captain Maro who distrusted ceremonies more than bullets. [234]
Behind him walked a girl holding a bundle of reed candles, and her eyes kept drifting to the star mosaics as if they were maps out of grief. [262]
From the opposite stairway came the Iron Banner envoys, faces masked in bronze, and General Odran carried the scars of twenty truces broken. [285]
Sera mustered her voice, not loud but steady, and invited them to stand on the mosaic circle where the solstice line cut through the stones. [310]
She set the ebony clipboard on a low altar, beside an empty bowl, and explained that the treaty would be read aloud while the sun sank and the first planet rose. [341]
Maro snorted at the bowl, and Odran asked what was to stop the other from using the darkness to draw knives. [362]
Sera answered by opening her palms, showing the thin burn scars, and said the bowl was for ashes, because every side would surrender one cherished order to the fire. [391]
The ritual demanded a sacrifice of intent, she told them, the price of redemption for leaders who had made killing normal. [412]
Maro reached into his coat and produced a folded directive authorizing raids on refugee barges, and his fingers shook as he offered it. [435]
Odran hesitated longer, then removed a medal stamped with the names of villages he had razed, and placed it with a metallic click on the altar. [461]
Sera added her own item, a map marked with the doomed corridor she had designed, and she felt the terrace tilt as if the sky itself judged her. [489]
When the sun touched the far ridge, the girl lit the reed candles and sang the solstice verse, and even the masked envoys lowered their heads. [515]
Sera read the treaty from the clipboard, clause by clause, while above them Venus brightened and the moon climbed, slow proof that time could change course without apology. [543]
The document promised shared wells, exchange of prisoners, and a council on the riverbank, but it also listed penalties that would fall first on commanders, not civilians. [570]
Maro objected to the penalties, and Odran objected to the council, yet the ritual cornered them into arguing details instead of denying the humanity across the circle. [597]
At the final line, Sera invited each to speak one vow aloud, and her operatively gentle gaze held them there, refusing to let shame turn into rage. [624]
Maro vowed to keep the barges unraided, Odran vowed to withdraw from the orchards, and the girl vowed to carry news between camps until her feet failed. [651]
Then they burned the directive, the medal, and the marked map in the bowl, and the flames threw flawed beauty onto their faces, making them look briefly like people who could start over. [684]
As ash drifted over the terrace and the celestial bodies continued their indifferent waltz, Sera clipped the signed pages together and understood that peace was not forgiveness, only the daily labor she had finally chosen to pay for. [722]
