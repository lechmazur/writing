<story>On nights when the coast storms turned the tower windows into sheets of moving ink, I climbed the internal labyrinth with my tool belt and broom, doing my shift as the labyrinth maintenance worker. [34] The maze was not for tourists; it was a municipal instrument for collecting grief from citizens, each bend stamped with a number that let our clerks file sorrow as if it were tax. [67] We called it quantified sorrow, because people left with lighter shoulders, and my duty was to keep the stones aligned so their measurements stayed true. [92] I did not mind the arithmetic of sadness, but I had a private hunger: to discover what trees witness, especially the wind-bent pines around the tower that never spoke. [121] Old astronomer Rell once told me that trees keep the sky in their rings, and he pressed into my hands his broken sextant, saying it would point to the memories I wanted if I learned its language. [158] The thing had a snapped index arm and a cracked arc, useless by daylight, yet it healed in moonlight the way some cuts close when you stop picking them. [187] Each full shift I laid it on the tower sill after my rounds, and by the time the moon cleared the storm cloud edges, the metal stitched itself smooth enough to turn. [219] Rell also taught me a method that sounded like nonsense until I tried it: by mapping scattered dreams, you can chart where a mind has been without breaking into it. [249] The labyrinth gathered dreams along with grief, leaving flakes of sleep on door lintels and in the seams of my gloves, and I swept those flakes into paper envelopes labeled with the bend numbers. [283] On the night everything changed, the tower was stormlit and the corridors held their breath, and in the deepest run the silence tightened until I heard a pin strike stone. [313] At that moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor, the maze always shifts, and my chalk lines slid sideways as if the walls were listening for my reaction. [343] I followed the sound to a pocket chamber where an oak sapling grew improbably from a floor drain, its leaves wet with seawater, and I felt the weight of all the grief it had absorbed. [378] The clerks would have tagged that weight as fifty-four units and closed the case, but I wanted the witness, not the sum, so I set the sextant to the sapling and waited under the moon. [413] As the moonlight brightened between lightning flashes, the sextant repaired itself fully and began to tick, each tick subtracting a fraction from my own chest as if it were measuring my quantified sorrow too. [447] The numbers it showed were not angles but nights, and when I plotted them on my maintenance map beside the dream envelopes, a hidden route appeared that ran straight to the tower roof. [480] I realized the labyrinth had been built to keep people from reaching the trees outside, because the pines watched every confession, and the town feared what witness would do to our orderly ledgers. [513] If I wanted answers, I had to deconstruct the maze itself, not smash it, but take it apart stone by numbered stone, releasing the stored dreams back into the air to guide me. [546] Working as I always did, I loosened bolts, lifted panels, and wrote the bend numbers on my wrist, while the moon kept the sextant whole and the drifting dreams formed a faint, practical compass. [580] By dawn the hidden route opened, and I stepped out onto the storm-swept parapet where the pines leaned close, and in their needles I heard the same pin-drop silence, now filled with images. [613] They showed me, not in words but in the mapped dreams I had freed, the faces that entered the tower and the hands that planted the sapling to drink their sorrow, and I understood that trees witness by holding what we refuse to carry. [657] When I went back inside, I filed no report; I simply reset the remaining stones into a smaller labyrinth that led outward instead of in, a mundane miracle that let grief be measured yet still heard. [693] On the next stormlit night, with the sextant resting on the sill and healing again in moonlight, I listened for the corridor pin and smiled, because now I knew the trees were already answering.
