<story>After the future arrives early, the city clocks stuttered and the night trains ran in daylight, as if tomorrow had jumped the rails. [23]Lysa, purposefully curious even when fear tightened her throat, followed a rumor that the jump had cracked open dreams. [42]They said an oracle waited in the cobalt glade at dusk, where leaves held a blue metallic sheen and the air tasted of rain. [66]She carried, wrapped in wax paper, a maze topiary clipping taken from the governor's forbidden hedge, a sprig shaped like a question mark. [89]The clipping was her proof that the future's garden had already seeded itself into the present, and her ticket past the sentries. [111]At the glade's center she found him, the root-bound visionary, a man whose legs had become braided roots sunk deep into the cobalt soil. [135]His chest rose with slow sap breaths, and dozens of pale scars crossed his arms like stitched rivers. [153]When she stepped close, the scars warmed, and she realized he was linking through scars to anyone who had ever been cut by time's new edges. [179]Elation fluttered in her stomach, anxious because it meant the rumor was true and she could not pretend anymore. [198]"Heed me," the visionary whispered, voice dry as bark, "for the eclipsed covenant is failing, and your dreams are leaking into mine." [220]Lysa had heard of that covenant only in lullabies, a pact made during an ancient eclipse to keep the dead future from owning the living present. [246]Now, after the future arrived early, the eclipse no longer waited its season; it skittered across calendars, blotting out trust whenever it pleased. [269]She showed him the clipping, and the blue light in the glade seemed to sharpen, as if the hedge's maze remembered routes between worlds. [293]"I came to find the intersection of dreams," she said, "where my mother's sleep meets the place she vanished to when tomorrow came early." [317]The visionary's eyelids trembled, and in the tremor Lysa felt other minds brush hers, strangers bound by matching scars and matching losses. [339]"There is a crossing," he said, "but it is hidden inside the hedge you clipped, and the covenant can open it only if you offer a wound." [366]She rolled up her sleeve to reveal the thin scar on her wrist from the day the future sirens first sang, and her anxious elation turned to steadier resolve. [395]On his barky palm he placed the topiary sprig, then pressed her scar to it, and pain flashed like a small private eclipse. [418]The leaves unfurled in her mind into corridors, and she walked them without moving, guided by the visionary's roots and the chorus of scar-linked dreamers. [443]At each turn she glimpsed pieces of other people's nights: a child clutching a bright plastic sun, a soldier hearing birds inside his helmet, her mother humming behind glass. [472]The intersection appeared as a round clearing in the maze where all those images overlapped, and above it hung a black disk, the covenant's eclipsed seal. [498]But the seal was cracked, letting tomorrow's harsh light spill through, and the overlapping dreams began to tear at one another like dogs. [521]Lysa remembered the visionary's warning to heed, and instead of fleeing she traced her scar with her fingernail until it bled, then touched the blood to the seal. [549]Across the glade, his own scars flared in answer, and the linked dreamers felt their wounds align, stitching the crack with a living thread of shared pain. [576]The black disk slid whole again, and in the sudden dimness Lysa found her mother at last, not as a ghost but as a sleeper standing at the same crossing. [606]They held the topiary clipping between them like a compass, and when dusk lifted from the cobalt glade, the covenant carried them back to a present that could wait for its future. [638]</story>
