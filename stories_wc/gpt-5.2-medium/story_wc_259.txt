<story>Across the end of innocence, when my city still believed history was a gentle teacher, I walked into the lost civilization archive with a saffron veil over my hair and dust on my hands. [34] I was its youngest historian, and the elders kept saying my curiosity was steadily unpredictable, the sort that either finds truth or burns a library down. [60] They were right, because my real motivation was to pursue forbidden knowledge, the sealed catalogs of Keth, a vanished empire whose scripts were outlawed after the Purge. [87] The archive was built atop their ruins, and in its lowest vault the air tasted of old copper and wet stone, as if the walls sweated forgotten names. [115] I had been taught that memory is a story we tell ourselves, yet Keth left proof that memory has weight: atoms of nostalgia that cling to ink, bone, and breath. [145] Those atoms made archivists weep or laugh without warning, so the elders banned the Keth shelves and assigned me to safer work, indexing treaties and births. [171] At twilight, when the lamps began to hum and the marble windows turned violet, I stole the key anyway and descended until my sandals met a door of patinated bronze. [201] Inside stood the bronze prism pagoda at twilight, a model no taller than my waist, its facets catching the last light and splitting it into narrow, trembling corridors. [229] I knew from fragments that the pagoda was a purifier, meant to clean archives after war by breaking dangerous recollection into harmless dust. [252] But the instructions were missing, and my teachers had warned that purification failed if done in a pattern, because patterns let nostalgia reassemble itself like a marching song. [280] So I set my jaw, breathed through the saffron veil, and began to purify the Keth books by avoiding patterns: turning the pagoda a quarter, then a seventh, then not at all. [312] Each choice felt like stepping on ice that might hold, and the pagoda answered in angles of light that changed steadily yet unpredictably, never repeating the same beam twice. [341] When the first folio passed through the prisms, a scent of my childhood orchard rose from the paper, and I understood how the atoms of nostalgia had stolen innocence from everyone who touched them. [375] I should have stopped, but the forbidden knowledge in those glyphs promised an answer to why Keth erased itself, and my joy at nearing it hurt like a pulled tooth. [405] The light corridors thickened until I could see scenes inside them: children learning letters, soldiers learning obedience, and finally a council deciding that memory itself was a weapon. [433] As I rotated the pagoda in my irregular sequence, the council turned their own archives into traps, binding atoms of nostalgia to every record so conquerors would choke on longing. [463] That was the Purge the elders spoke of, not a cleansing but a contagion, and I felt anguished joy because my people had inherited both the sickness and the cure. [493] To reach the last catalog, I had to break my own habits: no counting steps, no steady breathing, no prayers in order, only deliberate disorder so nostalgia could not predict me. [524] The pagoda opened like a flower of metal, and within lay a single slate inscribed with the forbidden formula for separating a life from its memories without killing either. [553] In that moment I saw my younger self, still innocent, running toward a future that would demand this choice, and I wept as I copied the formula and let the archive take the tears. [587] When I climbed back to the upper halls, dawn had started to bleach the windows, and the elders asked what I had found, reading my veil as if it were a confession. [619] I told them I had purified the Keth shelves, which was true, but I did not tell them that purification by avoiding patterns had purified me as well, stripping off inherited dread while leaving love. [654] That night I began teaching the city to read again, not in tidy sequences but in spirals and leaps, so our new archive would hold knowledge without trapping us in nostalgia's bright cages.
