<story>Liora came back to the valley after twelve years in far ports, a diaspora returnee with dust in her suitcase and a warmly curious habit of asking names for every stone. [31]Her journeys had always been interrupted, by strikes, by storms, by letters that arrived too late, and the breaks had chipped away at the faith she once carried like a lantern. [62]When the monastery trustees hired her to help excavate a forgotten tomb beneath the old catacomb orchard, she hoped that digging toward the dead might lead her back to something living. [93]The orchard grew in a hollow of carved limestone, where tree roots snaked between bones and ribs made pale trellises, and each apple smelled faintly of incense and soil. [122]Father Sava, cautious as he was devout, showed her the object they meant to recover: a cracked sundial base that once stood above the tomb to mark prayer hours, now buried under collapses and rumor. [157]He said the abbey had lost its way after the war, and if she could rebuild the dial and reopen the tomb, pilgrims might return, and he might believe his own sermons again. [190]Liora did not trust miracles, yet she trusted work, so she began the excavation in small, deliberate stages, treating the orchard as a map and walking it each morning in purposeful wandering until she learned which roots led to voids and which held the ceiling. [235]Her spade tapped skulls and stone, and sometimes she stopped to listen, because the catacombs answered with soft drafts that sounded like pages turning, as if the dead kept a library she was entering one careful breath at a time. [275]Midweek, just as she located the keystone to the tomb passage, a tremor shivered the hill and caved the trench, interrupting the journey downward and forcing her to climb out through a side gallery lined with child-sized niches. [313]She emerged among the apple trees shaken but unhurt, and the interruption felt too familiar, like the ship that once turned back when her mother died, so she sat against the sundial base and admitted to herself that her faith had been depending on arrival, not on direction. [361]That night she wandered again, not to escape the work but to reframe it, following root corridors and bone paths until she found a collapsed chapel alcove where a stonemason had etched a simple sun and the words, 'Keep walking even when the hour breaks.' [406]In the days that followed, across excavating the tomb with ropes and wedges, she rebuilt what the tremor undid, shoring the passage, cataloging the bones with gentle apologies, and fitting the sundial base with new mortar mixed from orchard clay, each step an answer to her own doubt. [454]When the doorway finally opened, it revealed not treasure but a circle of clay lamps around an empty bier, and in the center a pocket watch stopped at noon, as if the buried pilgrim had also suffered an interrupted journey and had left time itself unfinished. [500]Father Sava wanted to seal the tomb again, fearing scandal, but Liora, warmly curious even in reverence, searched the walls and found a shallow niche holding a notebook of itinerant prayers, written by travelers who recorded where they turned back, whom they forgave, and how they kept faith without reaching their shrines. [552]She read aloud by lanternlight, and the orchard above seemed to listen, roots tightening as though to brace the roof, while Sava's stern face softened at lines that admitted fear yet chose motion, and Liora understood that restoration was not a return to the past but a decision to keep moving through it. [605]At the surface they set the sundial base on a plinth between two apple trunks, and Liora carved a new gnomon from fallen limestone, aligning it by the stars because the sun was hidden behind storm clouds that reminded her of all the delays she had cursed. [652]When the clouds broke at last, the shadow fell across the fresh markings and slid forward, and she felt a cautious enchantment in the simple proof that time could resume without erasing the pauses, that even a life of interrupted journeys could still point, steadily, toward light. [699]Later, as pilgrims began to wander the orchard paths, stopping to read copied pages from the notebook, Liora chose not to leave again, but to keep rebuilding the monastery's trust through the same purposeful wandering that had guided her underground, and in doing so she restored a lost faith that was now wide enough to include detours.
