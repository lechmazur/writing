<story>The shrine was a hollowed chamber carved into glacier ice, candle-lit and silent, with ice walls carved into shallow alcoves that held shells, rusted nails, and names scratched by grieving hands. [31] Mara sank her diving suit beside the altar-stone and listened, because she was a wreck-diver and a ghost whisperer, and this place made even trapped voices rise like breath in cold air. [63] She had come for a single object sealed in her satchel: a snow globe, or what remained of it, its glass collapsed and melted into a lopsided teardrop that still held a blur of water and silver grit. [101] In the wreck below the fjord it had rolled from a child's cabin, and the child's ghost had followed Mara through silt and dark, asking for the little world that used to snow on command. [136] Mara's reason was always the same, spoken into her regulator and into her own ribs: salvage something pure from the wreckage, not the copper or the jeweled buckles, but the last honest thing left behind. [171] The shrine's candles borrowed starlight through the ice, tinting every flame with a cold blue, and Mara set the melted globe where it could catch that light like a pupil. [201] The ghosts that clung to the glacier did not speak in sentences; they pressed images against her thoughts, and Mara, who weaves truth carefully, translated only what she could confirm. [231] What she needed to confirm was why the child's globe had melted, because glass does not slump into itself in seawater unless someone has brought heat down where it does not belong. [263] She had tracked rumors of a smuggler called Fen, a dream-harvester who sold visions of the dead to the living, and she suspected he had used the wreck as a furnace for his craft. [297] Fen never appeared in daylight or dive-lamps, so Mara hunted him by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, listening in taverns for the small details people forgot they had said aloud. [328] A fisherwoman mentioned a man with ink-stained fingers who kept stepping into her sleep as if through a door, only long enough to check the knots on her nets and whisper, 'Leave the window unshuttered'. [363] A priest dreaming at the shrine saw the same man reflected in the glacier wall, not centered but drifting at the edge like a cameo in a play, and that was how Mara knew Fen used windows of connection. [402] The shrine itself was such a window: a lens of clear ice above the altar that opened to the sea below, and to whatever memories hovered between water and bone. [432] Mara warmed the melted globe between her gloves until the trapped water shifted, then held it up to the ice lens, aligning distortions the way she aligned testimonies, patiently, without letting grief rush her. [466] Through that imperfect glass she saw the wreck again, but not as she had dived it; she saw it as Fen had entered it, carrying a coil of copper wire and a brazier that burned with stolen lamp-oil. [504] The child's ghost crowded close, showing Mara a small hand on the globe, then a larger hand cracking it open to pour the water into the brazier, making steam that Fen shaped into dream-doors. [538] Mara understood the cruelty of it: Fen did not summon the dead, he skimmed their last reflections off the water and sold them, and each sale thinned the spirit until only silence remained. [571] To expose him she could not accuse with hearsay, so she asked the shrine for witnesses, and the candles flickered as sleepers in nearby villages began to dream the same edge-of-frame man. [603] When Fen stepped into those shared dreams, thinking them private, Mara watched his movements through the globe and the ice lens, catching the pattern of his entries and the harbor where he woke. [636] She met him on the pier with the fisherwoman and the priest beside her, laid the melted snow globe in Fen's palm as proof of the heat he had carried underwater, and, with borrowed starlight on her face, told the crowd the careful truth that finally left him nowhere to hide. [687] As guards took Fen, Mara returned to the glacier shrine and set the teardrop globe in an alcove, so its distorted little world could serve as a gentler window of connection for the child and for anyone who came to remember without buying. [730] The ghost's images softened into a single fall of imagined snow, and Mara, hearing that quiet gratitude in her bones, felt that purity was not untouched, only rescued and held where the light could reach it.
