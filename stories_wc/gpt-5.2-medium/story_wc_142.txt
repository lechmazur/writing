<story>Before privatization, the raft city of Cadenza never slept, a perpetual carnival stitched from pontoons, barges, and old theater floors that bobbed on the bay. [25] Ira worked the midway as a culture shock absorber, greeting newcomers at the gangplanks and quietly translating customs so fights did not start over a wrong hand sign or song. [55] She was orderly intuitive, able to sense where a crowd would knot and to slide bodies apart with a joke, a ribbon, a redirecting glance. [80] That gift mattered now, because the Council had posted glossy plans for "heritage upgrades," and rich mainlanders were already measuring decks, muttering about rents and railings. [106] Ira's loyalties split like the tide: she owed the Council her paycheck and her berth, yet she owed the performers and boatwrights her childhood and her name. [133] Dual allegiance kept her walking a tightrope above the music, smiling at investors by day and passing warnings to her neighbors by night. [156] The warnings began when Old Majo, the riveter who had set the first foundation stone of Cadenza's anchor pier, pressed a small foundation stone chip into her palm. [184] "From the pier's heart," he said, and the chip looked ordinary until it caught lantern light and flashed a faint map of the raft seams etched in quartz. [212] Majo explained that privatizers could not buy what they could not number, and the map showed hidden tie points where Cadenza could be loosened, rearranged, and retied. [239] If the neighborhoods reorganize themselves overnight, he said, deeds and surveys would fail, and the Council would be forced to bargain with the living city instead of selling a fixed grid. [270] Ira felt hope rise and panic chase it, because she was on the Council's payroll to keep order, but she could not watch her friends become attractions in someone else's curated parade. [302] Her solution used the only language both sides ignored: messages encoded in graffiti art, sprayed under bunting and behind ticket booths where security cameras saw only color. [329] As culture shock absorber, she already wandered every alley between ferris wheel and food raft, so she began tagging careful symbols that looked like carnival flourishes to strangers. [357] To her people, a blue spiral meant move south at midnight, a red swallow meant swap moorings with the mask-makers, and a tiny white square meant meet at Majo's pier. [387] She kept the code orderly, intuitive in its logic of currents and foot traffic, so even drunks and acrobats could follow it without needing to read. [413] Meanwhile she fed the Council harmless truths, reporting that crowds wanted more safety ropes and better lighting, buying time while the raftwrights prepared chain hooks and tow lines. [441] The night the first private security launch arrived, brass bands still played, but Ira heard the new engines like teeth, and desperation sharpened her hope into a plan she could not delay. [473] She flashed the foundation stone chip at lantern height, read the quartz seams, and walked the decks leaving fresh graffiti arrows that sent whole blocks drifting apart with practiced grace. [503] From the Council tower, Administrator Vell watched addresses change beneath him, and when he confronted Ira on the swing-bridge, she admitted her dual allegiance and offered him a choice. [532] "You can sell a map," she said, "or you can protect a people; if you stand with us, we will keep the carnival open and the accounts clean, but on our terms." [564] Vell stared at the moving lights, the dancers hauling ropes, the old women steering barge-homes like swans, and he realized privatization would turn all this into a museum he could not run. [596] By dawn he signed a moratorium, blaming "safety reviews," and Ira, exhausted, painted one last mural of a stone heart cracking into many boats, hopeful and desperate that Cadenza might stay free by staying fluid.
