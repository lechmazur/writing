<story>After the crash brought us to Pomona-Orchard, strangers had already become family in the tight months of rationing and shared jokes under the floating rock arches. [26]The planet was an orchard world, its valleys stitched with pear trees and its sky riddled with slow-spinning stone bridges that never touched the ground. [51]We thought we were alone until the dawns began answering us, in white chalk lines on the deserted sidewalks of the abandoned packing town. [75]Those messages were signed only with a small bell sketch, and the directions they offered felt strangely trustworthy, like a hand on your shoulder in a thorn thicket. [103]We followed the chalk to a ruined butterfly garden where a brass watering bell hung from a trellis, dulled by pollen and time. [126]When Mara rang it, the air cooled and a pale figure unfolded from the shadows of milkweed, translucent as mist yet steady as a lighthouse. [151]The ghost bowed with an old-fashioned courtesy and said its name was Serren, and that it had been waiting to help whoever could still hear the bell. [178]Serren was altruistic in the plainest way, asking nothing, tending our wounds, and teaching us which fruit could be safely eaten when the moons turned the sap bitter. [206]At night it spoke of a nebula of respite, a pocket of quiet between star lanes where exhausted ships could drift unseen and repair their broken hopes. [233]But the route to that nebula ran through the planet itself: beneath one of the hovering arches lay an ancient relay well that would open only if many hands rebuilt it together. [265]Serren could not lift stone or weld metal, so it used the method it had left for years, through messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn, to orchestrate collective effort. [295]Each morning we reexamined the new notes, arguing and laughing as if they were letters from an aunt, until our small band of survivors moved as one crew. [323]Mara, who had once been a stranger to all of us, became our foreman; Jai kept the fuel cells alive; I learned to read the chalked maps as if they were constellations. [355]The work was brambled hope, scratched and snagging, because every beam we raised seemed to attract windblown thorns from the orchards and questions about why a ghost cared. [383]Serren answered by leading us to its own grave, a cracked service pod wedged under a levitating arch, and asking us to reexamine the logs still sealed inside. [411]The recordings showed Serren as a living technician who had stayed behind during the last harvest war, ringing the butterfly garden bell to signal refugees toward shelter. [438]When the arch relays failed and the invaders burned the packing town, it died buying time, and its last act was to chalk the first dawn message with hands that were already fading. [471]We understood then that its trustworthiness came from a habit of sacrifice, and our fear of being used fell away like dry leaves. [494]So we brought the bell to the relay well and set it on the keystone, and when Mara rang it the sound threaded through the orchard, calling not spirits but people. [525]From between the trees came other lost crews, drawn by the chalk routes they too had been following, and together we hauled cables across the empty air to the floating arches. [556]At sunset the rebuilt relay well opened, projecting a star-scented window that pointed toward the nebula of respite, and Serren stood beside us, brighter, as if belonging were fuel. [585]Before we left, it asked us to keep chalk and bell together, to leave dawn messages for whoever arrived after us, because family was a practice, not a bloodline. [614]We promised, and as our patched ship rose under the thorny constellations, Serren saluted from the garden, fading into the milkweed while the arches carried our shared labor into the stars.
