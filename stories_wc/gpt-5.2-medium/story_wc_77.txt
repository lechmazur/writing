<story>After the resuscitation, my lungs still tasted of pennywater and dust when I returned to the abandoned carnival funhouse at the edge of town. [24]The paramedics had warned me to rest, but the thin glow that had clung to my skin in the ambulance would not let me sleep. [49]It was a lingering luminance, sickly and seductive, like moonlight filtered through spoiled milk, and it made every shadow in my room look hungry. [73]In the funhouse entrance, mirrors mottled with fungus breathed a cold perfume, and my footsteps pulled squeals from old rubber tiles. [94]I came because I was photographically cursed: any camera that captured me kept the image glowing for days, bright enough to read by, and the people in those photos later died of panic. [127]Fear had learned my outline, and I meant to trick it into revealing its weakness before it learned the rest of me. [149]A whispering advisor waited inside, a voice without a body that always knew the shortest path to whatever I dreaded most. [170]"Keep your eyes soft," it hissed from a cracked clown mouth painted on the wall, "and keep the clasp close." [190]At my throat I wore the opera cloak clasp I had taken from my grandmother's costume trunk, a silver hook shaped like a swan with its neck twisted backward. [219]The clasp held not fabric but intention; when I touched it, the lingering luminance on my hands gathered into a bead, as if the metal could sip light. [247]The advisor guided me to the Hall of Snapshots, where broken photo booths leaned like coffins, and strips of my own face hung from their slots, still shining. [275]Each strip pulsed with repulsive allure, inviting me to stare until my heartbeat matched its flicker, and I felt the old drowning fear pry at my ribs. [302]I opened my satchel to unbosom the thing I hated carrying: a dream dictionary inherited from my father, its margins dense with paradoxical notes written during his insomnia. [330]He had scribbled that to escape a burning house in dreams you must walk deeper into the flames, and to silence a scream you must sing it in harmony. [359]Those contradictions had sounded like madness until the night I flatlined; after I was pulled back, the notes began answering me in sleep with their own strange music. [387]Now, in the funhouse, I traced a line under the word FEAR, and the advisor breathed, "Read the margin, not the meaning." [409]The paradoxical note beside it said: "To trick fear, offer it a photograph that cannot keep you, a light that cannot linger." [431]I understood then that my curse was a net made of attention, and the lingering luminance was the bait that taught the net where to close. [457]If I could make the light fail at the moment of capture, fear would show its empty hands. [475]The advisor led me into the Tilted Corridor, where a final booth still had power, its flash bulb swollen like a maggot, ready to burst. [500]I fastened the opera clasp around my bare wrist, not as jewelry but as a hinge, and stepped into the booth, letting the mirrors multiply my glow. [527]As the countdown clicked, I recited from the dictionary the impossible instruction to "be unseen by being perfectly seen," and I pressed the swan's twisted neck until it bit skin. [557]The flash erupted, and for one nauseating second my face burned onto the strip, but the clasp drank the luminance instead of letting it linger, leaving the image gray and ordinary. [588]In the silence that followed, the advisor finally revealed itself as my own breath returning, and fear, deprived of its shining proof, slid off me like wet paint. [616]I walked out past the fungus mirrors, carrying the dull photo strip as a charm, and behind me the funhouse went dark for good, as if even the shadows had lost interest. [648]</story>
