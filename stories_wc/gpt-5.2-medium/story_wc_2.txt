<story>Mara was a broken-clock tinkerer in the river town of Sile, where people paid her to make stopped hands tell useful lies. [22]She said every clock kept two times, the one it showed and the one you carried, and she learned to live uncertainly certain between them. [47]After the harbor fire, when black flakes still drifted down like moths, the admiral came to her shop with a naval chart burned at the edges and a hole where his compass rose should have been. [83]The admiral's lost compass rose, he swore, had rolled away during the evacuation, and without it he could not prove a report that the enemy ships had turned inland. [112]Mara did not care about naval courts, but she cared about the way accidents repeated, and this was the third week when coincidence becomes pattern. [137]A stranger had left an ash gray feather on her sill every morning, and the stopped clocks she repaired kept chiming at the same minute past midnight, as if pointing her somewhere. [169]So she took the admiral's charred map, set a handful of broken gears in her pocket, and went searching for what might be hiding beneath the ashes of the old botanical conservatory. [201]The conservatory sat behind a collapsed wall, its glass roof webbed with soot, yet inside it still breathed, and she entered through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse. [230]Vines had reclaimed the iron benches, and the air smelled of wet earth mixed with smoke, as if the fire had only paused. [253]On the back table she found a row of clock faces, each cracked, each set to that same midnight minute, and the feather lay among them like a signature. [282]Beneath the table a trapdoor yawned, and when she lifted it a cold roar rose up, water echoing in stone. [302]She climbed down into a tunnel where roots hung like dark hair, following the sound until it opened to a subterranean waterfall spilling into a pool that reflected no sky. [332]There, in a niche behind the falling sheet, a brass star glimmered, and she had to improvise a way past the spray using the gears as stepping teeth in the slick rock. [364]As she edged through, she remembered her own reason for taking the job: to befriend uncertainty in planning, not to banish it, because certainty had burned the harbor as surely as the enemy did. [398]The waterfall hid a chamber lined with scorched crates, and in the gray silt she saw the admiral's lost compass rose half buried, its points bent but its center still true. [429]When she lifted it, the brass warmed in her palm, and the needleless hub clicked once, like a clock deciding to start again. [452]Footsteps splashed behind her, and the stranger with ash gray feathers sewn into his coat stepped from the tunnel and said he had been leaving signs to lure someone who could listen to broken time. [487]He introduced himself as Corin, keeper of the conservatory's secret pumps, and he confessed that he had diverted the admiral's compass rose here to map hidden currents under the city, because fire had exposed how shallow their plans were. [526]Mara, uncertainly certain, offered a bargain: she would return the compass rose if Corin helped her build a clock that marked not hours but probabilities, a device that would teach the admiral to steer with doubt instead of rage. [565]Together they carried the brass star back up through the greenhouse, shook soot from the leaves, and by morning the chiming minute had shifted, not to a fixed new time but to the one they chose to watch for, so that beneath the ashes the town could begin again without pretending it knew the route.
