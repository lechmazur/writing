<story>Three weeks after stopping the medication, I return to the river with my notebook and the old station map folded in my pocket. [23]I am the town's chronicler of currents and spillways, hired to write the truth of water, but lately my own truth keeps slipping under like a stone. [50]Daringly methodical, I measure the banks in paces, record birdcalls in time stamps, and crosscheck every detail against map references from surveys older than my grandparents. [76]Yet the page I cannot annotate is the one where I signed off on the dam inspection that failed, the week my brother drowned downstream. [101]I come to the disused railway station overgrown with ivy because its platform once held the gauge house keys, and because punishment feels like waiting for trains that never arrive. [131]In my satchel is my father's accordion, the bellows patched with tape after he slammed it shut in grief, and I carry it like evidence. [156]I tell myself I am here for data, but really I am looking for a path to self-forgiveness, something as exact as a coordinate and as tender as a song. [186]The station doors hang open, and ivy threads the ticket windows, and the air smells of rust and wet leaves, like the river has been living here too. [214]I spread my map on the cracked bench and line it up with the tracks, alluding to an imaginary inspector beside me because I cannot bear to speak to myself directly. [245]The map references point to a service tunnel marked in pencil, a forgotten shortcut from platform to river, and my fingers shake as I trace the tiny arrow. [273]Without the medication, every memory comes back unfiltered: my brother laughing at my rules, my signature on the report, my father's silence, the tape on the accordion. [300]I follow the tunnel to the station bathroom, the only room still sheltered, and the walls are layered with messages that have survived vandals and rain. [326]Through bathroom graffiti wisdom, someone has written, in careful block letters, YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH AND STILL LIVE, and beneath it another hand replies, START WHERE YOU LIED. [355]I read the lines aloud, raw as confession, and I notice a sketch of the river bend with a date and a grid number that matches my survey book. [384]On impulse I take out the accordion, press the taped bellows gently, and a thin chord sighs into the tiles, as if the room itself wants to forgive me. [413]The chord steadies my hands enough to copy the grid number, then I check it against my map references and realize the graffiti is pointing to the old intake gate. [443]That gate was the part of the dam I skipped, the part my brother dared me to inspect properly, and the part I pretended was fine because I wanted to go home early. [476]I walk out to the riverbank behind the station, counting my steps like I used to, and the ivy scrapes my sleeves as if it has its own ledger to keep. [507]At the intake gate, half buried in silt, I find the corroded latch my report ignored, and I photograph it, annotate it, and send it to the council with my name attached. [539]The act does not bring my brother back, but it stops the river from taking someone else, and for the first time the truth feels less like punishment and more like shelter. [571]I sit on the platform edge, play a rough lullaby, and allude in the melody to my brother's laugh, my father's hands, and the pills I chose to leave behind. [601]When dusk fills the station, I fold the map, write one final line in my notebook, and accept that self-forgiveness is not a destination but a route I must keep surveying. [632]</story>
