The confession dropped from Mara's mouth like a bolt, and the room went so quiet I could hear my own eyelids click. [22]
In that hush, my drowsy alertness sharpened, because her eyes said she expected me to do what I always did: run. [43]
I am a reckless abandoned-mill explorer by habit, but I am also religiously skeptical, and I do not believe in absolution that arrives on a hymn. [69]
Mara had whispered, almost calmly, that years ago she saw a man die in the freight yards and never told anyone, not even the police. [94]
Now she wanted me to find the weight of that swallowed truth, something solid enough to set on a table between us. [116]
She mentioned an abandoned train tunnel under the old Barlow Mill, a place where the foreman used to send men on a midnight factory ghost shift. [142]
Her voice shook when she said the dead man's badge number was painted there, and that she had hidden one piece of the mill in the dark. [169]
I drove out after midnight, keeping the car heater low so my half sleep would not turn into surrender. [188]
At the tunnel mouth, the air tasted of wet iron and old coal, and the rails vanished into a throat of brick. [210]
On my lap sat my tool roll and the beaded valve wheel Mara had given me, heavy with grease and tiny glass beads that caught my headlamp. [237]
She claimed it came off a pressure gate that controlled the mill's steam, and that turning it once would open what she could not say aloud. [263]
I put a battery radio in my pocket, tuned to the overnight talk show where psychics took calls from the sleepless, and started walking the ties. [289]
It was my method to appraise mysteries: by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, I could hear what people tried to hide in their own stories. [315]
A woman on the air sobbed that a door in her basement opened only when she lied, and the host told her spirits demanded honesty. [340]
I did not buy the spirits, but I bought the pattern, and it kept me awake as water dripped from the tunnel crown onto my neck. [366]
Farther in, a rusted service pipe ran along the wall, ending at a bolted flange where a matching valve wheel should have been. [389]
My flashlight found blue paint on the bricks, numbers smeared by damp, and beneath them a chalk mark like a cross that made me snort. [414]
I pressed the beaded wheel onto the spindle, and the beads felt warm, as if many hands had worried them during some invisible shift. [438]
When I turned it, the tunnel breathed, and a seam in the brickwork sighed open to a narrow passage that smelled of wool coats and cigarettes. [464]
The radio crackled with a caller yelling that she heard machines running in a shut factory, and the psychic murmured, 'They are clocking in, they are clocking in.' [492]
I followed the passage until it widened into a buried loading bay, lit by no lamp I could see, where silhouettes moved in slow labor. [517]
Men and women in soot dark coveralls pushed carts through one another, their faces blank, their boots never quite touching the ground. [539]
At a punch clock bolted to a pillar, the dead man from Mara's story stood watching, fingers worrying a badge as if it were a rosary. [565]
He looked at me without surprise, and in my heavy lidded calm I realized this ghost shift was not haunting for fun but for accounting. [590]
I appraised the scene like a salvage lot, listening to the radio and to the scrape of carts, and the two stories lined up. [614]
The caller on the air begged to know how to unstick a secret, and the psychic said, 'Name the weight, then turn the wheel back.' [639]
I asked the dead man what Mara had swallowed, and his mouth opened on a soundless shift whistle while his hand pointed to the badge number on the wall. [668]
Under the paint, I found a dented tag stamped with that number, and on its back a note in Mara's handwriting admitting she had pushed him onto the track. [697]
The truth hit with physical heft, and the ghosts seemed to lean in, waiting to see if I would carry it into the world or drop it back into darkness. [727]
I turned the beaded wheel the other way, sealing the bay, and walked out to call Mara, not to forgive her, but to stop her from hiding behind my silence. [757]
