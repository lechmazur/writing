<story>The day the Regent died and no successor rose, the palace of Vey ran on echoes, and I took my post in its whispering gallery with my notebook and borrowed uniform. [31]They hired me as a crisis actor to stage calm for the crowds outside, yet my ribs still remembered the collapse of the South Bridge, where I had been a real survivor. [63]In that disaster I learned how absence can glow, how a missing handprint on a rail can shine brighter than any torch, and I swore to become the historian of small gestures. [95]During this interregnum the court moved like a nomadic penumbra, ministers and guards drifting from chamber to chamber, loyal to no crown, casting shifting shadows across the mosaics. [123]My task was to read those shadows, and to choose, benevolently ruthless, which ones deserved to be recorded and which ones had to be cut away before they strangled the city. [154]At dawn I carried a chessboard missing all the pawns, an heirloom from the bridge, because the emptiness of its front rank reminded me to watch the little people first. [184]The board also served as my prop, proof that I belonged among strategists, even though I was only paid to weep on cue and point toward imaginary safety. [212]In the gallery, whispers skated along the curved stone, so a word breathed behind a column reached the farthest balcony as clear as confession. [236]I listened to courtiers trade rumors of the missing prince, then marked each speaker not by names but by gestures: a finger tapping twice, a sleeve tugged down to hide ink, a blink held too long. [272]That afternoon a messenger slid me a strip of vellum stating only, Unbind the archive before midnight, and the letters were pressed in a waxy hand I knew from the bridge rescue lists. [305]The archive lay sealed under the gallery floor, and the Regent's loyalists intended to keep it bound until they could rewrite it, erasing the small gestures that proved their cruelty. [335]To reach the latch without tools, I used the method my mother taught for secret markets, a pattern of walking that spells words, each turn and pause forming a letter in the dust. [368]With guards above, I paced UNBIND across the tiles, and the gallery answered, carrying my heel clicks as if they were whispered prayer, until the hidden catch loosened. [396]Cold air rose from the opening, smelling of paper and dried violets, and my chessboard lay beside it like a field after battle, all pawns gone, kings exposed. [424]I descended and found bundles of testimony tied with red cord, accounts of ration lines, of nurses sharing water, of a soldier lifting a child over flood debris, the gestures I had vowed to save. [459]Footsteps thundered overhead, and I was benevolently ruthless again, ripping the cord, splitting the bundles into my coat and satchel, leaving nothing for the loyalists to burn. [486]When they dragged me out, I performed my hired panic for them, sobbing and stumbling, but in the whispering gallery I let my real survivor voice slip into the stone and guide a child attendant to hide the rest. [525]The attendant, part of the palace's nomadic penumbra, vanished between doorways with my satchel, and I watched the empty throne room fill with light as if the missing prince were already a ghost. [558]They imprisoned me in a closet off the gallery, yet the next night the city woke to broadsheets quoting the archive, and the crowd's anger turned from bloodlust to insistence on a lawful succession. [592]When the new council freed me, I set the pawnless chessboard on the gallery ledge and began writing not of rulers but of fingertips, sleeves, blinks, and footsteps, luminous in their absence, binding the interregnum to memory by unbinding it from lies.
