<story>In the heart of a city that had seen better days, there was a broken planetarium reimagined as a night club called The Nebula.<words>26</words> By day, Eli worked as an underwater welder, his patience stretched thin by the slow pace of his work, yet he was meticulous and never rushed.<words>46</words> By night, he was a regular at The Nebula, drawn to its unique atmosphere and the eerie beauty of its decaying star projector.<words>73</words> Eli was patiently impatient, always looking for something more than the life he had, always seeking a way to wield improbable power.<words>103</words>

One night, as Eli wandered through the club, he caught glimpses of himself in the vintage store mirrors that adorned the walls.<words>131</words> In the fractured reflections, he saw moments of unravelingâ€”brief visions of himself in a different time, wielding a strange and powerful force.<words>166</words> Intrigued and drawn to these visions, Eli became obsessed with finding their source.<words>185</words>

His search led him to a small, forgotten room tucked away behind the old projector.<words>207</words> Inside, he found a vintage button box, its contents spilling out like a collection of stolen moments.<words>229</words> Each button was unique, each a glimpse into a different time and place.<words>246</words> Eli realized that the buttons were fragments of time, and that he was standing at the crossing where two timelines should never meet.<words>276</words>

He began to collect the buttons, to sort them and study them, patiently impatient to unlock their secrets.<words>302</words> He started to pamper the buttons, polishing them carefully, as if trying to coax out their hidden power.<words>327</words> And slowly, he began to understand.<words>335</words> Each button was a moment of unraveling, a piece of time that had come undone, and he could use them to weave a new reality.<words>363</words>

Eli started to experiment, using the buttons to make small changes in his life.<words>380</words> But with each change, he felt a growing sense of unease.<words>392</words> The power was intoxicating, but it was also dangerous.<words>406</words> He saw glimpses of a world unraveling, of timelines colliding in ways they were never meant to.<words>430</words>

One night, as Eli looked into one of the mirrors, he saw a reflection that chilled him to the bone.<words>452</words> A world in chaos, timelines colliding, and at the center of it all, him, wielding the improbable power he had so desperately sought.<words>483</words> In that moment, Eli understood the true nature of the buttons and the danger they posed.<words>503</words> He realized that some things were meant to remain unchanged, that some powers were not meant to be wielded.<words>528</words>
