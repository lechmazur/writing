Eli's current obsession was a tarnished silver locket, its once-gleaming surface now dulled by age and neglect.<words>130</words> It bore no inscription, no visible marking to hint at its significance.<words>148</words> Yet, Eli sensed a pulsating power within, a vital key lost to time, waiting to be uncovered.<words>174</words> He was driven by a hopeful brutality, a ruthless determination masked by his gentle demeanor.<words>196</words>
