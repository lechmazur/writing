<story>In the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry, there existed a deserted playground at the edge of a wilderness.<words>24</words> The swings creaked forlornly, and the merry-go-round spun in the occasional breeze, its laughter faded into echoes of the past.<words>44</words> Here, in this forgotten place, a humorless comedic actor named Edgar found solace.<words>59</words> He was known for his deadpan delivery, his inability to laugh at his own jokes, and his peculiar fascination with the night sky.<words>89</words>

Edgar had received an unwanted gift from an old friend, an inkwell, dried out and seemingly useless.<words>113</words> The inkwell was objectively personal, its design reminiscent of Edgar’s late mother’s favorite trinket.<words>137</words> He couldn’t discard it, nor could he ignore the memories it stirred.<words>154</words> Instead, he carried it with him, a silent companion in his solitary walks through the playground.<words>176</words>
