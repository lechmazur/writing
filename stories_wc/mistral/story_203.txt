<story>In the hushed silence of the orbital debris field, amid the ever-present hum of distant machinery and the occasional drift of discarded playthings, Sister Elara floated.<words>36</words> An exorcist by training, a recluse by necessity, she was known as the one who possessed stage fright, a seemingly absurd contradiction.<words>64</words> Her sanctuary was a decommissioned shuttle, tucked away within the vast junkyard of space, where she lived amid toy assembly, creating peculiar trinkets from the debris.<words>107</words>

Sister Elara was never usual, a trait that extended beyond her profession to her very being.<words>130</words> She had inherited a lie, a familial legacy of deception that had shattered her childhood.<words>153</words> Her mother had fabricated a life of normalcy, hiding her true nature as an exorcist, and her father had played along, sculpting a web of deceit.<words>186</words> Elara's discovery of their secret had been a brutal awakening, shattering her reality and leaving her with a deep-seated fear of the spotlight.<words>221</words>
