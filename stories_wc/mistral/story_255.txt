Eli's motivation was simple yet profound: to unearth a mythic relic that local legends whispered could bring delayed justice to those who had been wronged.<words>146</words> The tales spoke of an encrypted USB drive, hidden away in the tower, containing information that could right the wrongs of the past.<words>179</words> Eli was skeptical of the myth but couldn't ignore the analytical challenge it presented.<words>203</words>
