<story>In the faded, rustic confines of an abandoned carnival shooting gallery, Edmund, a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, found solace in the joyfully melancholic atmosphere.<words>31</words> The gallery, with its chipped paint and silent targets, was his sanctuary between the lines of a half-written letter he carried in his pocket, a letter that held the weight of his family's traditions and his own quiet rebellion.<words>60</words>

Every year, his family would attend the carnival together, a tradition that had once been a source of joy but now felt like a shadow he couldn't escape.<words>89</words> Edmund's unique gift of whispering to ghosts had always set him apart, made him different, and his family's expectations felt like a heavy burden.<words>121</words> He longed to step out of the shadow, to arouse his spirit and live on his own terms.<words>141</words>

One day, while diving in the nearby lake, Edmund discovered a piece of amber with an insect inside, perfectly preserved in the golden resin.<words>170</words> The amber was cold to the touch, much like his own heart, which had been frozen by the weight of expectations and the fear of disappointing his family.<words>203</words> Yet, there was a spark within him, a fleeting rebellion that refused to be silenced.<words>221</words>

In the shooting gallery, Edmund held the amber up to the faint light filtering through the cracks in the walls.<words>244</words> The insect within seemed to dance, a tiny, eternal rebellion against its imprisonment.<words>264</words> Edmund felt a kinship with it, a shared longing for freedom and life.<words>281</words> He decided then that he would finish the letter, express his true feelings, and finally step out of the shadow.<words>307</words>
