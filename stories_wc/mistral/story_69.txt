<story>In the grimy, neon-lit alley behind the hologram repair shop, a uniquely common figure wandered.<words>21</words> His robes were tattered, his beard unkempt, and his eyes held a flicker of lethargic excitement that hinted at both his druidic past and his uncertain future.<words>47</words> He was Gethin, an uncertain druid who had left his ancient order to find meaning in the chaotic urban sprawl.<words>75</words>
