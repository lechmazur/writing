In the peculiar realm of the black hole resort, where gravity was a fickle friend and the laws of physics took a vacation, there existed a mild-tempered guard named Eli.<words>31</words> His life was poetically bland, filled with the humdrum of daily routines amid bike rides through the resort's labyrinthine paths.<words>57</words> The resort, a bizarre haven for the eccentric and wealthy, was built around the edge of a stable black hole, offering guests a literal edge-of-the-abyss experience.<words>93</words>

Eli's world began to unravel like a loose thread when he stumbled upon a peculiar sight: a group of stray cats gathering in an alleyway, their eyes fixed on a hidden object.<words>137</words> Intrigued, Eli decided to follow the cats, their tails held high like antennae guiding him through the resort's twisted back alleys.<words>173</words> The method of following stray cats was an unusual one, but Eli found a strange comfort in the savage bliss of their company.<words>206</words>
