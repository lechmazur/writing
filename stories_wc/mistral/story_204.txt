<story>In the abandoned spaceport hangar, dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through the cracked windows, creating an unusually usual atmosphere of neglect and nostalgia.<words>31</words> The hangar, once a symbol of technological prowess, now decayed silently, much like the professional cuddler's resolve to overcome her deep-seated prejudice.<words>57</words>

Evelyn, the professional cuddler, was known for her warmth and empathy, but she harbored a secret prejudice against the "Spacers," the former spaceport workers who were left behind when the space program was defunded.<words>99</words> She saw them as relics of a past that couldn't let go, a sentiment echoed in the decaying hangar where they often gathered.<words>131</words>

One day, during the hush before an acceptance speech began, Evelyn found herself at the farmer's market, a chance encounter that would challenge her prejudices.<words>167</words> She was there to buy fresh produce, a simple task that seemed worlds away from the complex emotions she was about to confront.<words>200</words>

At the market, she met Oliver, an old Spacer with a twinkle in his eye and a phantom train ticket punch in his hand.<words>226</words> The punch was an antique, a relic from a time when trains were the primary mode of transport, and it was Oliver's most prized possession.<words>257</words> He held it out to her, an unspoken rule of introduction among the Spacers, who valued the history of human achievement in all its forms.<words>289</words>

Evelyn hesitated, her prejudice a tangible barrier between them.<words>305</words> But there was something in Oliver's eyes, a warmth that mirrored her own, that made her reach out and accept the phantom punch.<words>332</words> It was cold and heavy in her hand, a stark contrast to the warmth of human touch she was used to.<words>356</words>

As she held the punch, Oliver began to speak, his voice echoing in the quiet market, painting a picture of a time when the spaceport was alive, and the Spacers were pioneers.<words>392</words> His words were filled with pride and longing, not the bitterness she had expected.<words>410</words> She listened, her prejudice decaying with each word, replaced by a newfound understanding and respect.<words>434</words>

In that moment, Evelyn realized that the Spacers were not relics of the past but guardians of history, much like the phantom punch.<words>459</words> They were not so different from her, seeking comfort and connection in their own way.<words>477</words> As the acceptance speech began in the distance, Evelyn accepted her own change of heart, embracing the ancient novelty of the Spacers and their stories.<words>505</words>

From then on, Evelyn became a regular at the farmer's market, seeking not just fresh produce but the company of the Spacers, their unspoken rules of camaraderie becoming as familiar to her as the rules of her own profession.<words>547</words> The abandoned spaceport hangar, once a symbol of her prejudice, became a sanctuary of understanding, its decaying walls echoing not with bitterness, but with tales of human achievement and connection.<words>587</words></story>
