<story>In the throes of excited boredom, Ed, a time-looping paramedic, found himself once again stuck in the quantum tunnel, a place where time folded in on itself like a MÃ¶bius strip.<words>32</words> The bell's echo marking a forgotten recess had become his cue to wake, and with it, the familiar dread of knowing what came next.<words>57</words> He was privately public, his life a series of repetitions that no one else remembered, his actions unnoticed by the world around him.<words>83</words>

Every loop started the same way: with the sound of a single raindrop hitting the windshield of his ambulance.<words>109</words> That single drop was his method, his timer, his starting pistol.<words>127</words> It signaled the moment to nest, to settle into the familiar routine of a day he'd lived too many times to count.<words>156</words>

In the beginning, he'd tried to change things, to save the lives he knew would be lost. But the quantum tunnel was unforgiving, and no matter what he did, the loop always corrected itself.<words>193</words> Now, he was just trying to baptize his nightmares in acceptance, to find a way to live with the unhealed traumas that echoed through his mind like the bell that marked his days.<words>229</words>

On this particular loop, Ed noticed something new.<words>241</words> A small, weathered fishing lure sat on the dashboard, its once-bright colors faded, its hook rusted.<words>265</words> It hadn't been there before, and its presence sent a jolt of excitement through him.<words>284</words> Change was rare in the tunnel, and Ed had learned to seize it when it came.<words>304</words>

He picked up the lure, turning it over in his hands.<words>315</words> It was old, yes, but it was also a symbol.<words>326</words> A symbol of his past, of a life before the loops.<words>339</words> He'd gone fishing with his father, once upon a time.<words>351</words> Before the ambulance, before the tunnel, before the endless echo of the bell.<words>372</words>

As he held the lure, he felt a shift.<words>381</words> The raindrop hit the windshield, but the sound was different.<words>395</words> It was softer, more distant.<words>403</words> And then, suddenly, the ambulance was gone.<words>411</words> Ed was standing on the bank of a river, the weathered fishing lure still in his hand.<words>428</words>

He looked around, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and fear.<words>443</words> This was new.<words>446</words> This was different.<words>449</words> He'd broken the loop.<words>454</words> Or so he hoped.<words>458</words> He cast the lure into the water, the motion familiar and foreign all at once.<words>475</words> And as he waited for a bite, he felt a sense of peace wash over him.<words>489</words> Perhaps this time, he could heal.<words>496</words> Perhaps this time, he could accept his past and move forward.<words>512</words> Perhaps this time, the bell would toll for a new beginning.<words>529</words></story>
