In the cluttered projection room, Eli discovered a vintage microscope tucked away in a corner, gathering dust.<words>188</words> It was an unusual find, but Eli saw it as a sign, a piece of the puzzle that his spontaneous adventures were continually assembling.<words>217</words> Through the lens of the microscope, he examined the crumbling bits of the drive-in—the mineralized remains of a forgotten time.<words>243</words>
