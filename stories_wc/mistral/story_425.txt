<story>In the lavishly austere halls of the solar flare observatory, where the last star had been named and cataloged, Sir Eldred, a morose paladin, wandered.<words>33</words> His life had been dedicated to a now obscure order, sworn to protect the light of knowledge.<words>56</words> Yet, in this age of completion, where the cosmos held no more mysteries, his purpose felt as dull as the sewing needle he absently fiddled with.<words>86</words>

The observatory, once a beacon of discovery, was now a monument to bored excitement.<words>109</words> Its polished marble floors and grand arches were bathed in the perpetual twilight of a starless night.<words>139</words> Sir Eldred's steps echoed through the empty corridors, his reflection in the glass displays of named stars and mapped galaxies a stark reminder of his own stagnation.<words>179</words>

One evening, as he stood before the vast window overlooking the unchanging night, a sudden and inexplicable darkness swept through the observatory.<words>214</words> A city-wide blackout, a rare occurrence in their technologically advanced society, confined the observatory in an unfamiliar natural darkness.<words>249</words> Sir Eldred felt a spark of excitement, a chance encounter with the unknown.<words>269</words>
