<story>In the sprawling isolation of the glass desert, where the sun blazed capriciously consistent against the translucent dunes, Eldridge, an unconvinced missionary, trudged during the migration of the last monarch butterfly.<words>41</words> The delicate creatures fluttered overhead, their orange and black wings a stark contrast against the shimmering landscape, as Eldridge pursued his solitary journey.<words>66</words> His destination was a ruined chapel, half-buried in the glassy sands, where it was rumored that magic still lingered.<words>91</words>

Eldridge's faith had once been strong, but the world's decline had tested it, leaving him with more questions than answers.<words>117</words> He had heard tales of the chapel's magic, of how it could make one a conduit for miracles, and he yearned for that power, if only to understand the silence of the divine.<words>157</words> In his pocket, he carried a tarnished silver fork, a family heirloom, its dull gleam a reflection of his waning belief.<words>185</words>
