The gondola creaked, swaying gently as it traversed the misty peaks.<words>107</words> Alistair reached into his pocket, pulling out an antique flute, its surface marred by tooth marks.<words>131</words> He had found it in the monastery's storeroom, drawn to it by an inexplicable force.<words>154</words> He believed the flute was key to outsmarting his dark reflection, to avenge the life it had stolen from him.<words>182</words>
