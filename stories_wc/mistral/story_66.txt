In the heart of a dense forest, tucked away from the world, there was a peculiar research facility dedicated to plant communication studies. <words>31</words> Among the scientists, there was a quiet deserter, named Eli, who had left his former life to find a place where one truly belongs, even if it is nowhere. <words>60</words> Eli was dizzyingly grounded, a walking contradiction, his feet firmly planted on the earth while his mind whirled with memories and regrets. <words>89</words>

The lab was filled with plants of all kinds, from towering ferns to tiny mosses, each one whispering secrets in their silent language. <words>121</words> Eli worked among them, his hands gentle on the leaves, his eyes haunted by a past he could not escape. <words>149</words> In his pocket, he carried a small, cracked mirror, a remnant of his old life. <words>171</words> He had shattered it himself, a symbol of breaking the cycle that had kept him trapped. <words>191</words>

Every evening, after his work with the plants, Eli would sit at a worn table, piecing together jigsaw puzzles. <words>216</words> Each puzzle was a map, a city, a landscape, any place that was not here. <words>235</words> Yet, as he placed the last piece in each one, he would feel the same emptiness. <words>253</words> None of them was the place he belonged. <words>263</words>

One day, while studying a rare species of orchid, Eli found a shattered porcelain mask hidden among the roots. <words>288</words> Intrigued, he began to reconstruct it, piece by piece, like one of his puzzles. <words>309</words> As he did, he began to see stories in the fragments. <words>322</words> A life lived in fear, a cycle of abuse, a desperate need to break free. <words>339</words> He saw himself in the story, his own past echoing in the porcelain shards. <words>357</words>

Driven by a noble foolishness, Eli decided to carbonize the mask, to destroy the cycle permanently. <words>380</words> He built a fire in the lab's courtyard, the flames licking the night sky. <words>398</words> As the mask turned to ash, Eli felt a weight lift from his shoulders. <words>416</words> He looked into his cracked mirror, seeing his reflection fractured, but free. <words>432</words>

From that day forward, Eli found a sense of belonging in his work, in the silent whispers of the plants. <words>454</words> He was no longer a deserter, but a scientist, a healer, a man at peace. <words>472</words> He had broken his cycle, found his place. <words>482</words> Even if it was nowhere, it was his. <words>492</words> And that was enough. <words>498</words>
