<story>In the hushed silence before the orchard's trees were cut down, Eli, a former drone pilot, found himself inexplicably stranded in a medieval fantasy realm.<words>31</words> He was perched atop a cliff, within the cold stone walls of an abandoned observatory, his heart a drum of cynically hopeful beats.<words>56</words> The observatory, once a beacon of knowledge, was now a shell of echoes, its telescopes gathering dust instead of starlight.<words>83</words> Eli's drone was nowhere in sight, his tech-savvy skills rendered useless in this realm of sword and sorcery.<words>109</words>

One evening, in a twist of fate and magic, the observatory hosted an unusual speed dating event, a phenomenon as foreign to the realm as Eli himself.<words>144</words> Villagers, drawn by curiosity and the promise of new connections, filled the observatory.<words>163</words> Eli, seeing an opportunity to disseminate his story and perhaps find a way home, joined the event.<words>186</words>

At his first table, a woman with eyes like a stormy sea sat across from him, a dried herb bundle tied to her wrist, its scent filling the air.<words>213</words> She was Aelia, a local healer, her heart as warm as her smile.<words>227</words> Eli, his voice a rusty hinge, shared his tale.<words>237</words> Aelia listened, her expression shifting from curiosity to disbelief, then to compassion.<words>254</words> She spoke of horizons of mercy, of how Eli's arrival might not be a curse but a blessing in disguise.<words>275</words>
