One day, while cleaning the storeroom, he stumbled upon a vintage sewing box.<words>103</words> It was intricately designed, with a worn, velvet exterior and delicate metal clasps.<words>124</words> As he opened it, he felt a strange sensation, a fleeting glimpse of something... otherworldly.<words>146</words> A cold breeze swept through the room, and a faint, spectral figure darted past him.<words>165</words> He wasn't afraid; instead, he felt a spark of curiosity and excitement.<words>183</words>

Over the following days, Marco noticed more of these fleeting glimpses, what he began to believe were poltergeist activities.<words>209</words> He started to document them, analyzing patterns, trying to understand their purpose.<words>229</words> He saw it as a puzzle, a wager of faith that there was more to this world than meets the eye.<words>250</words>
