The moon was waxing gibbous when Elias found himself amid bird watching, though his true purpose lay elsewhere. <words>19</words>  

He perched on a rusted bench near the haunted amusement park’s prize booth, binoculars in hand, feigning interest in a kestrel circling above. <words>40</words>  

In truth, he was waiting for the right moment to speak, for his words carried a curse—one that forced him to utter only truth. <words>61</words>  

The booth’s faded canopy fluttered in the evening breeze, its prizes long abandoned, save for a single vintage pencil box resting atop the counter. <words>83</words>  

Elias knew it was no ordinary trinket; it was woven into the tapestry of fate, a relic that bound choices to consequence. <words>104</words>  

A woman approached, her steps measured, her expression politely vindictive as she regarded him with knowing eyes. <words>121</words>  

“You’ve come to provoke evolution in a stagnant mind,” she said, her voice smooth as silk yet edged with steel. <words>140</words>  

Elias exhaled, lowering his binoculars. <words>144</words>  

“I don’t have a choice,” he admitted, his curse ensuring his honesty. <words>157</words>  

She tapped the pencil box with a gloved finger. <words>165</words>  

“This holds the past, the present, and the yet-to-be,” she murmured. <words>179</words>  

Elias nodded, his fingers twitching. <words>186</words>  

“The moon’s phases dictate its power,” he said. <words>196</words>  

She smiled, though it did not reach her eyes. <words>206</words>  

“Then you know what must be done.” <words>214</words>  

Elias hesitated, but the weight of his purpose pressed upon him. <words>228</words>  

He reached for the box, feeling the hum of destiny beneath his fingertips. <words>242</words>  

The woman stepped back, her posture expectant. <words>252</words>  

“The truth you speak will petrify the one who resists it,” she reminded him. <words>267</words>  

Elias swallowed hard, his gaze flickering to the moon. <words>278</words>  

It was nearly full—perfect timing. <words>285</words>  

He turned to the booth’s cracked mirror, where his own reflection stared back, weary and unrelenting. <words>301</words>  

“The mind that refuses to change will turn to stone,” he whispered. <words>314</words>  

A shudder ran through him as the words took hold. <words>325</words>  

The mirror darkened, his reflection stiffening, his own face becoming immobile. <words>338</words>  

The woman watched, impassive. <words>343</words>  

“You knew it would be you,” she said. <words>352</words>  

Elias could not respond—his lips were frozen, his body rigid. <words>365</words>  

The curse had fulfilled its purpose. <words>372</words>  

The woman picked up the pencil box, tucking it beneath her arm. <words>384</words>  

“The tapestry of fate is ever-weaving,” she murmured, before vanishing into the night. <words>400</words>
