The broken planetarium pulsed with neon light, its shattered dome refracting colors like a fractured prism. <words>14</words>  

Beneath the flickering constellations, Elias, an underwater welder by trade, traced the rim of a vintage button box. <words>29</words>  

He had found it in a forgotten corner of a shop, its lacquered surface reflecting glimpses of himself in the store’s antique mirrors. <words>45</words>  

Each reflection had shown something different—his face older, younger, or not his at all. <words>55</words>  

Now, in this nightclub built from the ruins of forgotten stars, he sought answers. <words>66</words>  

The air smelled of ozone and spilled liquor, the music a low thrum beneath the weight of time itself. <words>80</words>  

Elias was patiently impatient, his fingers tapping against the box’s lid as he waited. <words>92</words>  

He had been told that at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, the box would open. <words>106</words>  

And when it did, he would wield improbable power. <words>113</words>  

A woman in a sequined dress approached, her eyes reflecting the broken constellations above. <words>126</words>  

“You don’t belong here,” she murmured, her voice carrying the weight of inherited mystery. <words>138</words>  

Elias smirked, though his grip on the box tightened. <words>147</words>  

“I’ve spent my life welding things together,” he said. “Now I want to see what happens when something unravels.” <words>163</words>  

She studied him, then reached out, her fingers brushing the box’s surface. <words>174</words>  

The lid clicked open. <words>177</words>  

Inside, a collection of buttons lay nestled in velvet, each one a different era, a different choice. <words>191</words>  

Through the mirrors lining the club, Elias saw glimpses of what could be—worlds where he had never taken this path. <words>206</words>  

A life where he had never become a welder, another where he had never found the box. <words>219</words>  

The woman leaned in. “Choose carefully.” <words>224</words>  

Elias exhaled, his pulse steady despite the storm inside him. <words>234</words>  

He picked up a button, its surface worn smooth by time. <words>244</words>  

The nightclub flickered, the air thick with the scent of saltwater and rust. <words>255</words>  

He was back in the depths, welding metal in the crushing dark, but something had changed. <words>269</words>  

His hands moved with certainty, as if he had done this before—perhaps in another life. <words>282</words>  

The button box was gone, but its weight remained in his chest. <words>293</words>  

He had unraveled something, and in doing so, had been remade. <words>303</words>  

Above him, the ocean shimmered like a fractured sky, and he smiled. <words>313</words>
