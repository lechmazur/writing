Dr. Alistair Vex sat in the high-altitude tea house, adjusting his worn-out leather belt as he sipped a steaming cup of oolong. <words>19</words> His carnivorous plants, nestled in glass terrariums, twitched hungrily beside him. <words>30</words> The patrons gave him wary glances, but he paid them no mind. <words>41</words> He was here for something far more important than social pleasantries. <words>52</words>  

The black-and-white film reel flickered to life on the projector screen, casting eerie shadows across the wooden walls. <words>66</words> It was an obscure archival piece, rumored to contain hidden sections revealing ancient pathways lost to time. <words>80</words> Alistair leaned forward, his comically serious expression unwavering. <words>89</words>  

As the film played, he tapped his fingers against the table, waiting for the intermission. <words>100</words> The tea house’s fickle loyalty to its patrons meant service was unpredictable, but he had no time for distractions. <words>116</words> He reached into his satchel, retrieving a small ionization device of his own invention. <words>129</words>  

The film sputtered, and the intermission title card appeared. <words>137</words> Now was his chance. <words>141</words> He adjusted the dials on his device, aiming it at the screen. <words>152</words> A faint hum filled the air as the ionization process began. <words>163</words>  

The hidden sections of the film revealed themselves in ghostly overlays, showing cryptic symbols and shifting landscapes. <words>177</words> Alistair’s eyes widened as he recognized the markings—coordinates to an ancient pathway rumored to lead to untold botanical wonders. <words>194</words>  

A waiter approached, eyeing the device suspiciously. <words>202</words> “Sir, what exactly are you doing?” <words>208</words>  

Alistair didn’t look away from the screen. <words>215</words> “Deciphering the lost routes of the Verdant Order,” he said, his tone grave. <words>228</words>  

The waiter blinked. <words>231</words> “Right. More tea?” <words>235</words>  

“Obviously.” <words>236</words>  

The waiter left, shaking his head. <words>242</words>  

Alistair scribbled notes furiously, his plants rustling in excitement. <words>252</words> The symbols shifted again, revealing a final clue—a location high in the mountains, obscured by mist. <words>268</words>  

He tightened his worn-out leather belt, preparing for the journey ahead. <words>278</words> The fickle loyalty of the tea house had served him well this time. <words>290</words>  

As the intermission ended, the film returned to its mundane narrative, the hidden sections vanishing. <words>304</words> Alistair smirked. <words>306</words> He had what he needed. <words>310</words>  

He gathered his plants, paid his bill, and stepped into the cold mountain air. <words>322</words> The ancient pathways awaited, and he would not be deterred. <words>334</words>
