The abandoned space freighter docking bay groaned as metal strained against the vacuum’s pull. <words>14</words>  

A lone sentinel stood at its entrance, his stance unsteady, his breath shallow. <words>27</words>  

He had been stationed here for reasons he barely understood, a pawn in a prophecy he no longer trusted. <words>42</words>  

The air smelled of rust and old fuel, a relic of a forgotten era drifting between colliding worlds. <words>56</words>  

In his trembling hands, he held the remnants of shredded letters, piecing them together with meticulous desperation. <words>70</words>  

Each fragment whispered of fate’s ambush, of a destiny he had been forced to accept. <words>82</words>  

Yet, the more he reassembled, the more the prophecy unraveled into something else—something false. <words>96</words>  

A fluttering sound echoed through the bay, and he turned sharply, his pulse erratic. <words>109</words>  

Perched atop a rusted console was a strange automaton bird, its brass wings twitching. <words>122</words>  

Its eyes, small orbs of flickering blue light, studied him with an intelligence that unsettled him. <words>136</words>  

The bird clicked its beak, and a voice—mechanical yet eerily human—spoke. <words>147</words>  

“You seek clarity, but clarity is a trick of the mind.” <words>156</words>  

The sentinel clenched his jaw, his fury coy but undeniable. <words>167</words>  

“I was promised truth,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>178</words>  

The bird tilted its head, as if amused. <words>185</words>  

“Then I recommend you stop searching in the ruins of deception.” <words>196</words>  

His fingers tightened around the half-reassembled letter, the words shifting under his gaze. <words>209</words>  

The prophecy had spoken of his role as a guardian, but now he saw the lie. <words>222</words>  

He had not been chosen—he had been misled. <words>230</words>  

The automaton bird flapped its wings, scattering dust into the stale air. <words>242</words>  

“Fate does not ambush,” it said. “It waits for those too blind to see its approach.” <words>256</words>  

The sentinel exhaled, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. <words>266</words>  

Cheerless ecstasy flooded his veins—he had been freed, but at what cost? <words>279</words>  

The docking bay trembled as the freighter drifted closer to the collision point. <words>291</words>  

He had little time. <words>295</words>  

The letters, the prophecy, the lies—they no longer mattered. <words>306</words>  

He turned to the automaton bird. <words>311</words>  

“What would you have me do?” <words>317</words>  

The bird’s eyes flickered. <words>321</words>  

“Survive.” <words>323</words>  

With a final glance at the shredded letters, he let them scatter into the void. <words>336</words>  

Then, with unsteady steps, he walked toward the unknown. <words>346</words>  

The freighter groaned again, metal screaming as the worlds prepared to collide. <words>359</words>  

And the sentinel, no longer bound by prophecy, embraced the chaos ahead. <words>371</words>
