The hush settled over the wedding hall like dust in an abandoned library, and Felix Vance, freelancer of all things, exhaled. <words>21</words>  

His latest gig—wedding poet, vow consultant, and emergency toast-giver—had ended, leaving him alone with the remnants of celebration. <words>41</words>  

But his true work was just beginning. <words>46</words>  

He turned the amber ring on his finger, its golden depths catching the dim light, a relic from a past job he barely remembered. <words>71</words>  

Felix freelanced everything—writing, fixing, stealing, advising, even listening—but tonight, he was here for something deeper. <words>96</words>  

He had promised himself he would chronicle elder wisdom, the last good intentions of those who had lived long enough to know better. <words>123</words>  

And the best place to find such wisdom was where no one thought to look. <words>140</words>  

The steampunk airship engine room hummed beneath his feet, gears grinding in a mechanical symphony. <words>161</words>  

The ship’s chief engineer, an old man named Garrick, sat on an overturned crate, sipping from a dented tin cup. <words>187</words>  

Felix approached with the rhythm of waves against a cliff—steady, inevitable, patient. <words>209</words>  

Garrick squinted at him. “You again? What’s your angle this time?” <words>226</words>  

“No angle,” Felix said, leaning against a copper pipe. “Just a question.” <words>243</words>  

Garrick snorted. “You always got questions.” <words>256</words>  

Felix smiled. “And you always got answers.” <words>271</words>  

The old man sighed, setting his cup down. “Fine. Ask.” <words>285</words>  

“What’s the last good intention you ever had?” <words>301</words>  

Garrick’s fingers traced the rim of his cup. “To teach a fool how to listen.” <words>322</words>  

Felix chuckled. “And did you?” <words>335</words>  

Garrick’s eyes twinkled. “Still trying.” <words>348</words>  

Felix tapped the amber ring. “I think you just did.” <words>365</words>  

The old man studied him, then laughed—a deep, rusted sound. <words>382</words>  

“You’re more profound than you realize, boy.” <words>398</words>  

Felix shrugged. “Inadvertently.” <words>409</words>  

Garrick stood, stretching. “You outwit people without meaning to, you know that?” <words>432</words>  

Felix grinned. “It’s a freelance skill.” <words>447</words>  

The engine room pulsed around them, scattered harmony in metal and steam. <words>468</words>  

Felix pulled out his notebook, ready to write. <words>483</words>  

Some wisdom was worth freelancing for free. <words>497</words>
