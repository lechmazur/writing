The last name was crossed off the list, ink bleeding into the damp paper. <words>14</words>  

Sentinel Garrick exhaled, his breath curling in the cold air of the lighthouse keeper’s bedroom. <words>28</words>  

The ghosts here whispered broken promises, their voices threading through the frayed rope in his hands. <words>42</words>  

He had confiscated it from the last trespasser, a man who swore he could bind spirits. <words>56</words>  

Certainly possible, Garrick had thought, but the man had failed, leaving only echoes behind. <words>69</words>  

The lighthouse had once been a beacon, but now it was a tomb of eroding vows. <words>83</words>  

Garrick had come not to banish the dead, but to learn their traditional methods. <words>96</words>  

The old ways were fading, and with them, the knowledge of how to keep the restless at bay. <words>112</words>  

He traced the rope’s fibers, feeling the weight of forgotten rituals in its unraveling strands. <words>126</words>  

A gust of wind rattled the shutters, and the floorboards groaned beneath unseen steps. <words>139</words>  

The ghosts were watching, waiting, testing his resolve with their murmured regrets. <words>152</words>  

He smirked, dry-witted even in the face of the spectral. <words>161</words>  

“If you want me to leave, you’ll have to teach me first,” he said. <words>174</words>  

A shadow shifted, and the air thickened with something ancient and expectant. <words>187</words>  

Then, a rhythm—soft, deliberate—tapped against the wooden floor. <words>198</words>  

Garrick recognized it instantly: the cadence of a dance long thought lost. <words>211</words>  

His heart pounded as he stepped forward, matching the spectral beat. <words>224</words>  

A shared love for this dance had once bound the living and the dead. <words>238</words>  

Now, it was his only chance to learn what had been forsaken. <words>251</words>  

The ghosts moved with reckless precision, guiding him through the steps. <words>264</words>  

Each motion wove through the air like a thread, binding past to present. <words>278</words>  

The frayed rope in his hands tightened, its fibers twisting back together. <words>291</words>  

The lighthouse trembled, its walls absorbing the rhythm, the knowledge, the promise renewed. <words>306</words>  

Garrick danced until the whispers faded, until the ghosts had nothing left to teach. <words>320</words>  

When he finally stopped, the rope was whole, and the lighthouse stood silent. <words>334</words>  

He exhaled again, this time with certainty. <words>341</words>  

The old ways were not lost—just waiting for someone reckless enough to reclaim them. <words>356</words>  

Garrick pocketed the rope and stepped into the night, leaving the lighthouse at peace. <words>370</words>
