Gideon Vance had never been late a day in his life, a fact he wore like a badge of honor. <words>19</words> His orchard, a sprawling expanse of meticulously pruned trees, thrived under his vigilant care. <words>32</words> But tending apples had lost its luster after the accident that took his wife. <words>45</words> Seeking distraction, he volunteered at the paper airplane test facility, a place as absurd as it was fascinating. <words>63</words>  

The facility was a cavernous warehouse where engineers hurled folded prototypes, measuring their aerodynamics with scientific precision. <words>81</words> Gideon, however, had little interest in flight mechanics. <words>89</words> He was here for something else—something hidden in the folds of bureaucracy. <words>102</words>  

It started with an antique letter seal he found in a forgotten drawer. <words>114</words> The insignia—a peacock with an elaborate tail—felt oddly familiar. <words>126</words> His late wife had once pointed out the same pattern in a book on cryptography. <words>140</words>  

Curiosity turned to obsession as he traced the symbol through facility records. <words>152</words> The deeper he dug, the more inconsistencies he found—misplaced shipments, erased logs, and classified memos. <words>170</words> Someone was using the facility for something beyond paper planes. <words>182</words>  

One evening, he demonstrated his findings to a skeptical technician. <words>191</words> "Look at this," he said, spreading out a series of facility blueprints. <words>204</words> "The storage rooms align with the patterns in a peacock’s tail." <words>216</words>  

The technician scoffed. <words>218</words> "You’re seeing things, old man." <words>222</words>  

Gideon smirked, his sardonic glee barely contained. <words>230</words> "Am I?" he asked, tapping a specific point on the map. <words>241</words> "Because this room doesn’t exist in any official records." <words>252</words>  

That night, he slipped into the restricted section, heart pounding. <words>262</words> The door bore the same peacock insignia as the letter seal. <words>274</words> Inside, crates labeled as paper supplies contained something far more valuable—encrypted documents, gold bars, and surveillance tapes. <words>295</words>  

A conspiracy, hidden in plain sight. <words>300</words>  

The next morning, he arrived—never tardy, as always—ready to expose the truth. <words>312</words> But the facility director was waiting, flanked by two men in dark suits. <words>326</words>  

"You’ve been busy, Mr. Vance," the director said, voice smooth as polished steel. <words>339</words>  

Gideon crossed his arms. <words>343</words> "Just demonstrating a little pattern recognition." <words>350</words>  

The director chuckled. <words>353</words> "You should’ve stuck to apples." <words>359</words>  

Gideon grinned. <words>362</words> "And you should’ve hidden your tracks better." <words>370</words>  

The suits stepped forward, but Gideon tossed a paper airplane toward them. <words>382</words> It unfolded midair, revealing copies of the incriminating documents. <words>394</words>  

"Sent those to the press this morning," he said, relishing their panic. <words>406</words>  

The director’s face darkened. <words>411</words> "You have no idea what you’ve done." <words>419</words>  

Gideon shrugged. <words>421</words> "Just pruning the rot." <words>426</words>  

As security swarmed in, he felt something he hadn’t in years—purpose. <words>438</words>  

His wife would’ve loved this. <words>443</words>
