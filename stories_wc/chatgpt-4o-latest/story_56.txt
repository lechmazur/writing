Jonas flicked the blank price tag between his fingers, watching the way it caught the dim light filtering through the shattered glass of the toppled skyscraper. <words>17</words>  

The orchard farmland, reclaimed from the ruins, stretched in uneven rows beneath the collapsed beams and rusted steel, a strange oasis in a world that had long since stopped making sense. <words>41</words>  

He was a swindler by trade, a man who could sell a dream with a well-placed smirk, but today, he wasn’t here to sell—he was here to reveal. <words>65</words>  

The truth he carried was heavier than any lie he had ever spun, and for once, he wasn’t sure if his words would be enough. <words>87</words>  

A book dropped behind him, the thud breaking the quiet hum of the orchard, and he turned to see a woman scrambling to pick it up. <words>110</words>  

She moved with an odd contradiction—her limbs sluggish, her eyes sharp, as if her body had long since given up but her mind refused to follow. <words>133</words>  

“Need a hand?” Jonas asked, bending down, his fingers brushing the worn cover at the same time as hers. <words>149</words>  

Their eyes met, and for a moment, something unspoken passed between them, something neither of them could name. <words>167</words>  

“I know who you are,” she said, her voice carrying the same gentle harshness he had spent years perfecting. <words>185</words>  

Jonas smirked, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Then you know I’m not here to con you.” <words>202</words>  

She exhaled, standing slowly, the book clutched to her chest. “You’re here to tell them, aren’t you?” <words>220</words>  

He nodded, glancing toward the gathering crowd beyond the orchard rows, waiting for him to speak. <words>235</words>  

“They won’t believe you,” she warned, her voice softer now. <words>247</words>  

“They don’t have to,” he replied. “They just have to listen.” <words>261</words>  

The computer screen flickered in the distance, frozen for hours, now finally restarting at the worst possible moment. <words>278</words>  

Jonas felt it—the shift in the air, the invisible allies he had counted on stirring to life. <words>295</words>  

He stepped forward, raising the blank price tag high. “You’ve all been paying for something that was never for sale.” <words>315</words>  

Murmurs rippled through the crowd, uncertainty thick in the reclaimed air. <words>328</words>  

The woman beside him didn’t move, but he could feel her presence like a magnet pulling him forward. <words>346</words>  

“They told you this land was theirs,” Jonas continued, voice steady. “But the truth? It was always yours.” <words>366</words>  

The computer screen finished rebooting, flashing records long buried, proof of the deception. <words>381</words>  

Gasps filled the space, disbelief warring with realization. <words>392</words>  

Jonas turned to the woman, exhaustion settling into his bones. “Now they know.” <words>406</words>  

She nodded, her lethargy momentarily forgotten. “Now they decide what to do with it.” <words>423</words>  

And for the first time in his life, Jonas wasn’t bluffing. <words>435</words>
