The acid rain fell in slow, deliberate sheets, hissing as it met the skeletal remains of trees. <words>14</words>  

King Oren, a monarch in name only, trudged through the ruined forest, his cloak tattered but his crown intact. <words>30</words>  

He was lethargically energetic, his body sluggish but his mind alight with restless thoughts. <words>42</words>  

In his hands, he cradled a small wooden box, its lid worn smooth by years of handling. <words>56</words>  

Inside lay a collection of mismatched puzzle pieces, each one a fragment of something lost. <words>69</words>  

He had gathered them from the ruins of his fallen kingdom, though none fit together. <words>82</words>  

Still, he carried them, believing that wisdom could be held in rough, calloused hands. <words>95</words>  

The ember of choice flickered within him—an urge to rebuild, to understand, to perceive. <words>108</words>  

But perception was a fickle thing in this world of decay and shifting truths. <words>120</words>  

He knelt beneath the twisted remains of a once-mighty oak, reaching into his cloak. <words>133</words>  

From its folds, he withdrew a single feather, its barbs still soft despite the ruin. <words>147</words>  

Closing his eyes, he ran his fingers along its surface, feeling the ridges and hollows. <words>161</words>  

Through its texture, he perceived echoes of the past—whispers of choices made and unmade. <words>175</words>  

He saw his people fleeing the acid storms, their cries swallowed by the poisoned wind. <words>188</words>  

He saw the throne room, empty and cold, the weight of his crown heavier than ever. <words>202</words>  

And he saw the ember, glowing faintly in the darkness, waiting for him to decide. <words>215</words>  

The puzzle pieces rattled in their box as he stood, his fingers tightening around it. <words>229</words>  

He had spent years searching for meaning in their jagged edges, but meaning eluded him. <words>243</words>  

Perhaps they were never meant to fit together, just as the past could not be restored. <words>257</words>  

Yet, even in their disarray, they held something—a lesson, a possibility, a choice. <words>270</words>  

The acid rain burned against his skin, but he did not flinch. <words>280</words>  

He turned toward the horizon, where the ruins of his kingdom lay in silent testimony. <words>294</words>  

The ember of choice pulsed within him, urging him forward, urging him to act. <words>307</words>  

He would not rebuild the past, but he would shape what remained into something new. <words>321</words>  

With the puzzle pieces in one hand and the feather in the other, he walked on. <words>335</words>  

The forest hissed and whispered around him, but he no longer feared its voice. <words>348</words>  

He was an unassuming monarch, a man without a throne, but not without purpose. <words>361</words>  

And as long as the ember burned, he would carry wisdom in his calloused hands. <words>374</words>
