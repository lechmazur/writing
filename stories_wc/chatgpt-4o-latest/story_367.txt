The glass-walled observatory clung to the ocean cliff, its structure groaning under the weight of salt and wind. <words>16</words>  
Inside, Edris, a sapped herbalist, slumped over a desk strewn with brittle seaweed and ink-stained charts. <words>31</words>  
His fingers, once deft with mortar and pestle, now trembled as he traced tide patterns with a quill. <words>45</words>  
He had come here to study the ocean’s rhythm, believing its secrets held the key to perfecting his elixirs. <words>60</words>  
Yet, perfection had drained him, each failed attempt another weight pressing against his ribs. <words>72</words>  
He barely noticed the blacksmith’s bellows propped against the wall, a relic from a barter long past. <words>87</words>  
It had been traded for a salve that promised unbroken sleep, though the blacksmith never returned to confirm its worth. <words>103</words>  
Edris envied that certainty, the ability to forge something tangible, something that did not dissolve like tinctures in water. <words>118</words>  
A lone goose cut through the sky, its flight path a perfect arc against the storm-lit horizon. <words>132</words>  
Edris watched it with fervent indifference, admiring its precision while dismissing its significance. <words>144</words>  
He had long since abandoned the notion of cherishing anything beyond his work. <words>156</words>  
Perfection demanded sacrifice, and he had given everything—his health, his joy, his very sense of time. <words>171</words>  
The tide charts blurred before him, his exhaustion pulling him toward napping, though he resisted. <words>184</words>  
Sleep was an enemy, a thief that stole hours he could not afford to lose. <words>196</words>  
Yet, as his head dipped, his mind wandered to the bellows, to the blacksmith’s certainty. <words>210</words>  
What if perfection was not in the refinement, but in the force of creation itself? <words>223</words>  
The goose’s flight path had been effortless, unburdened by hesitation. <words>233</words>  
Edris had been thoughtfully thoughtless in his pursuit, chasing an ideal without questioning its worth. <words>248</words>  
The tide did not strive for perfection; it simply was. <words>258</words>  
With a sudden clarity, he reached for the bellows, pressing its handles together. <words>271</words>  
A gust of air rushed forth, scattering his charts, disrupting the careful order he had built. <words>286</words>  
He laughed, the sound foreign in the quiet observatory. <words>296</words>  
Perfection had been a cage, and he had mistaken its bars for progress. <words>309</words>  
The tide would continue, the goose would fly, and he—he would let go. <words>322</words>  
For the first time in years, Edris allowed himself to cherish the imperfection of being. <words>336</words>  
As the wind howled through the glass walls, he closed his eyes and surrendered to sleep. <words>350</words>  
Outside, the ocean roared, indifferent yet eternal, carrying his burdens away with the tide. <words>364</words>
