The static electricity garden crackled with unseen energy, the air thick with the scent of ozone. <words>14</words>  

Dante stood among the humming coils, his fingers tracing the edge of a plain wooden crate slat. <words>28</words>  

It was all he had left from the shipment that had changed his life. <words>38</words>  

Once, he had been a thug—muscle for men who never dirtied their own hands. <words>50</words>  

Now, he was something else, though he wasn’t sure what. <words>59</words>  

He had spent months staging accidental meetings in museums, hoping to cross paths with her again. <words>74</words>  

Dr. Evelyn Carter had been the first person to look at him without fear. <words>87</words>  

She had spoken of resilience, of breaking free from the past, and he had listened. <words>101</words>  

But listening wasn’t enough; he needed to understand. <words>109</words>  

A new silhouette appeared on the horizon, and his breath caught. <words>120</words>  

Evelyn. <words>121</words>  

She approached cautiously, her eyes scanning the garden’s flickering arcs of energy. <words>133</words>  

“You again,” she said, her voice carrying quiet intensity. <words>143</words>  

Dante nodded, gripping the crate slat like a lifeline. <words>153</words>  

“I need to know,” he said. <words>159</words>  

She sighed but did not turn away. <words>167</words>  

“Know what?” <words>169</words>  

“What it means to outlast.” <words>175</words>  

Evelyn studied him, her expression rationally subjective. <words>184</words>  

“You think survival is enough?” she asked. <words>192</words>  

He hesitated. <words>193</words>  

“It’s all I’ve ever known.” <words>199</words>  

She gestured to the garden, where arcs of electricity leapt between metal spires. <words>212</words>  

“Static clings to what it touches, but it never truly changes,” she said. <words>225</words>  

Dante frowned, shifting his grip on the slat. <words>234</words>  

“I don’t want to be static.” <words>240</words>  

“Then stop waiting for accidents,” she said. <words>248</words>  

His stomach tightened. <words>251</words>  

“I thought if I kept running into you, I’d figure it out.” <words>263</words>  

Evelyn shook her head. <words>268</words>  

“Resilience isn’t about waiting for answers.” <words>275</words>  

He exhaled slowly, the weight of his past pressing against him. <words>286</words>  

The crate slat in his hands had once been part of a smuggler’s cargo. <words>299</words>  

Now, it was just wood—nothing more, nothing less. <words>309</words>  

He let it drop. <words>313</words>  

Evelyn watched, her gaze unreadable. <words>320</words>  

“Good,” she said. <words>324</words>  

Dante straightened, the static in the air no longer clinging to him. <words>336</words>  

For the first time, he wasn’t just surviving. <words>344</words>  

He was moving forward. <words>348</words>
