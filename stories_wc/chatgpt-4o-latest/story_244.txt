The neon sign repair shop buzzed with dying light, its flickering glow casting restless shadows on the walls. <words>16</words>  

Kaede adjusted the tribal mask in her hands, tracing the labyrinthine carvings with a calloused thumb. <words>30</words>  

She had stolen it from a temple long ago, and its weight had never left her. <words>42</words>  

The final petal had fallen from the old rosebush outside, marking the time she had dreaded. <words>56</words>  

Tonight, she would pursue the door of release, the only way to atone. <words>68</words>  

Her sword, wrapped in cloth, leaned against the counter, a relic of past sins. <words>80</words>  

The shop’s owner, an old man with ink-stained fingers, watched her with knowing eyes. <words>94</words>  

“You still chasing ghosts?” he asked, adjusting a sputtering neon tube. <words>106</words>  

Kaede exhaled slowly. “I need to find the door.” <words>114</words>  

He chuckled, shaking his head. “You glean secrets from half-truth historians and expect clarity?” <words>128</words>  

“They know more than they admit,” she said, her voice reservedly bold. <words>140</words>  

The mask’s carvings held a map, but only in fragments, whispers of a path unseen. <words>154</words>  

She had spent years piecing them together, chasing rumors, trading steel for knowledge. <words>168</words>  

Now, the final clue lay in the neon shop’s basement, buried in forgotten records. <words>182</words>  

The old man sighed, handing her a rusted key. “You won’t like what you find.” <words>196</words>  

Kaede descended the creaking stairs, the air thick with dust and old electricity. <words>210</words>  

Stacks of yellowed papers lined the walls, histories rewritten, truths obscured. <words>222</words>  

She sifted through them, searching for the last piece of the puzzle. <words>234</words>  

A brittle parchment revealed itself, inked with symbols matching the mask’s carvings. <words>248</words>  

Her pulse quickened as she traced the lines, the path now complete. <words>260</words>  

The door of release lay beneath the city, hidden in the catacombs. <words>272</words>  

She emerged from the basement, the old man watching her with quiet pity. <words>286</words>  

“You think opening it will absolve you?” he asked. <words>294</words>  

Kaede met his gaze. “I have to try.” <words>302</words>  

The streets pulsed with neon as she moved through the city’s underbelly. <words>316</words>  

She followed the map’s guidance, descending into the labyrinth below. <words>328</words>  

The air grew colder, the silence pressing against her skin. <words>340</words>  

At last, she stood before the door, its surface etched with the same carvings. <words>354</words>  

Her fingers trembled as she fitted the mask into the hollow at its center. <words>368</words>  

The door groaned, ancient mechanisms shifting, unlocking the unknown. <words>380</words>  

A gust of warm air rushed past her, carrying voices from beyond. <words>392</words>  

She hesitated, guilt coiling in her chest, then stepped forward. <words>404</words>  

The door of release swallowed her whole, and the neon world faded behind. <words>416</words>
