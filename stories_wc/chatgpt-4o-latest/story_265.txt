Deputy Calloway stood beneath the vaulted ceiling, where the orchard’s branches stretched toward stained glass, their leaves trembling in the hush. <words>17</words>  

He rolled a twisted twist tie between his fingers, its metal core bent into an unrecognizable shape. <words>30</words>  

The cathedral had been abandoned for decades, yet the air still carried uncharted echoes of whispered prayers and forgotten hymns. <words>45</words>  

Calloway was here for reasons he could not fully articulate, drawn by something beyond duty. <words>57</words>  

He was a man of cautious bravery, his face impassive even as his heart strained toward the unknown. <words>71</words>  

The orchard had overtaken the nave, roots splitting stone, vines curling around broken pews. <words>83</words>  

Bees moved through the air in slow, deliberate patterns, their hum forming a rhythm he almost understood. <words>98</words>  

He had learned their secret language long ago, though he rarely spoke of it. <words>110</words>  

It was a skill passed down in hushed tones, a way to stretch beyond human limits. <words>124</words>  

Calloway exhaled and let his fingers move in subtle gestures, speaking to the swarm. <words>137</words>  

The bees responded, shifting in synchronized waves, revealing a path deeper into the orchard. <words>151</words>  

He followed, his boots silent on the moss-covered floor, his mind steady despite the unknown ahead. <words>166</words>  

The cathedral had become a sanctuary for something ancient, something waiting. <words>177</words>  

He had come during oil changes, slipping away from the garage where he worked between shifts. <words>192</words>  

It was the only time he could disappear without question, without expectation. <words>204</words>  

The bees led him to a clearing where sunlight filtered through shattered glass, painting the ground in fractured color. <words>221</words>  

At the center stood a woman, her hands raised, her body poised in perfect stillness. <words>234</words>  

She was neither young nor old, her presence both immediate and eternal. <words>246</words>  

Calloway did not speak, did not move, only watched. <words>255</words>  

The woman stretched, her arms reaching toward the heavens, her motion impossibly fluid. <words>269</words>  

It was a moment of pure grace, untouched by time, unshaken by the world outside. <words>283</words>  

The bees swirled around her, their hum rising in reverence. <words>294</words>  

Calloway felt something shift within him, something he had not known was missing. <words>308</words>  

The twisted twist tie in his hand grew warm, its shape no longer meaningless. <words>322</words>  

He understood now—this place, this moment, was not meant to be explained. <words>335</words>  

It was meant to be witnessed, to be carried in silence. <words>347</words>  

The woman lowered her arms, her gaze meeting his, and in that instant, he knew. <words>362</words>  

He would return, again and again, drawn by the echoes that only he could hear. <words>376</words>  

The bees dispersed, the orchard swayed, and Calloway turned, stepping back into the world beyond. <words>391</words>  

The twisted twist tie remained in his pocket, a reminder of the uncharted echoes that had found him. <words>406</words>
