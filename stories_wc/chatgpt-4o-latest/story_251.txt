The lunar mining colony hummed with the quiet desperation of those who had gambled their futures on dust and stone. <words>19</words>  

Among them, Elias sat cross-legged in his dimly lit quarters, a cracked collection of marbles spread before him. <words>36</words>  

Each sphere held a sliver of memory, fragmented visions of futures that might be, or never were. <words>50</words>  

He was a prophet, though he neither embraced nor rejected the title—an ambivalent seer caught between fate and free will. <words>69</words>  

His fingers traced the marbles, feeling the fractures like fault lines in time itself. <words>82</words>  

The final oath loomed over him, a promise that would either cement or shatter the cosmic scoreboard. <words>98</words>  

He had spent years defragmenting the universe’s scattered truths, piecing them together through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box. <words>118</words>  

Each jagged connection revealed glimpses of celestial order, but the picture remained incomplete. <words>132</words>  

The colony’s artificial gravity pressed lightly on his chest, a reminder that even here, between heartbeats, choices mattered. <words>151</words>  

Elias exhaled, happily sad in the way only those who understand too much can be. <words>166</words>  

He had seen the end, the way the universe would fold in on itself, numbers resetting like a game played too long. <words>187</words>  

But he had also seen the loophole, the way to scramble the cosmic scoreboard before the final tally. <words>204</words>  

The marbles whispered their fractured truths, and he listened with bashful arrogance, knowing he alone could tip the scales. <words>223</words>  

He reached for the last piece of the puzzle, a jagged edge that had eluded him until now. <words>240</words>  

It fit perfectly, locking into place with a certainty that sent a shiver through his spine. <words>256</words>  

The oath burned on his tongue, ancient words that would either rewrite destiny or doom it. <words>271</words>  

He hesitated, caught between the weight of knowledge and the thrill of uncertainty. <words>285</words>  

Then, with a quiet resolve, he spoke. <words>290</words>  

The marbles cracked further, their fractures glowing like constellations rearranging themselves. <words>305</words>  

The colony’s lights flickered, the hum of machinery stuttering as reality bent. <words>319</words>  

Between heartbeats, the universe shifted. <words>324</words>  

Elias smiled, happily sad, knowing he had done what no prophet before him had dared. <words>340</words>  

The cosmic scoreboard scrambled, numbers dissolving into something new, something unwritten. <words>355</words>  

He leaned back, exhaling as the weight of fate lifted. <words>368</words>  

For the first time, the future was truly uncertain. <words>380</words>  

And that, he thought, was the greatest prophecy of all. <words>394</words>
