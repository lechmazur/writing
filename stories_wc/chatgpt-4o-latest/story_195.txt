The nomad caravan bustled with the chaos of spring cleaning, yet Joren, a forlorn roustabout, lingered at the fringes, his fingers idly turning a small spool of thread. <words>22</words>  

Dust swirled in golden shafts of light as he watched the others scrub, mend, and sort, their laughter a distant echo in his hollow chest. <words>44</words>  

He had once been like them—carefree, full of mischief—but time had hardened him, leaving only the brittle shell of a man who had forgotten how to smile. <words>69</words>  

A child's giggle snapped him from his reverie, and he turned to see little Mara, her eyes wide with the edge of curiosity. <words>92</words>  

She pointed at the spool in his hand. "What’s that for?" she asked, tilting her head. <words>107</words>  

Joren hesitated, then smirked. "For tracking moon trails," he said, his voice carrying the weight of an old secret. <words>127</words>  

Mara gasped. "Really?" <words>129</words>  

He nodded, his mind already weaving a tale. "You see, the moon leaves invisible threads in the sky, and if you follow them just right, they lead to forgotten wonders." <words>161</words>  

Her eyes sparkled. "Show me!" <words>165</words>  

Something stirred in Joren’s chest, something long buried. "Alright," he said, standing abruptly. "But we must sprint to catch them before they fade." <words>191</words>  

Mara squealed with delight as they took off, weaving through the caravan, past drying linens and stacked crates. <words>213</words>  

Joren’s feet pounded the earth, his heart racing—not just from exertion, but from something deeper, something he couldn’t name. <words>237</words>  

He led her beyond the tents, where the sky stretched vast and endless, the first stars flickering to life. <words>259</words>  

He knelt, pressing the spool into her tiny hands. "Now, close your eyes and listen," he instructed, his voice softer than before. <words>285</words>  

Mara obeyed, her breath slowing. "I hear… the wind," she whispered. <words>301</words>  

Joren smiled. "Good. Now, imagine the moon’s silver threads stretching across the sky, waiting for someone brave enough to follow them." <words>329</words>  

She opened her eyes, wonder filling her face. "Where do they lead?" <words>343</words>  

"To the child hidden in every hardened heart," he murmured, more to himself than to her. <words>362</words>  

Mara grinned and tugged his hand. "Then we have to keep going!" <words>379</words>  

Joren laughed—a sound foreign to his own ears—and let her pull him forward, their shadows dancing beneath the rising moon. <words>403</words>  

As they ran, something inside him cracked, and for the first time in years, he felt light, as if the threads of the moon had finally found him too. <words>439</words>
