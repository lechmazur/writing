Captain Elias drifted through the abandoned spaceport baggage claim, his boots echoing against the cracked tiles. <words>14</words>  

The air smelled of rust and forgotten departures, a fitting place for a man who piloted a flying library. <words>29</words>  

He knelt beside a toppled suitcase, brushing dust from a detached coat button resting in its shadow. <words>42</words>  

It was small, unremarkable, yet it reminded him of the traditions he fought to preserve. <words>54</words>  

The Library of Aetheris, his ship, carried the last volumes of a dying civilization. <words>66</words>  

Once, knowledge had bound people together, but now, ignorance threatened to obliterate that fragile unity. <words>80</words>  

Elias sighed, pulling a dented tin cup from his satchel and pouring the last of his coffee. <words>94</words>  

The stains swirled in the dim light, forming patterns only he could decipher. <words>106</words>  

By reading the future in coffee stains, he had navigated storms, evaded warlords, and found lost souls. <words>121</words>  

Now, the patterns revealed a choice—one that could change everything in a single second. <words>134</words>  

A woman’s voice cut through the silence. <words>139</words>  

“You’re late.” <words>141</words>  

Elias turned to see Mara, her coat missing a button, her eyes heavy with unspoken grief. <words>155</words>  

She had once been his co-pilot, before the schism that fractured their mission. <words>168</words>  

“I had to be sure,” he said, gesturing to the coffee stains. <words>179</words>  

Mara scoffed. <words>181</words>  

“You still believe in that?” <words>185</words>  

“I believe in what it tells me,” Elias replied, his voice steady. <words>196</words>  

She exhaled sharply, glancing at the button in his palm. <words>206</words>  

“That was my father’s,” she murmured. <words>211</words>  

Elias nodded. <words>213</words>  

“He believed in the bridge to unity, too.” <words>220</words>  

Mara’s expression hardened. <words>224</words>  

“That bridge collapsed when you left.” <words>229</words>  

Elias studied the stains again, the answer forming in the shifting liquid. <words>241</words>  

“I left to protect the books,” he said. <words>248</words>  

“And I stayed to protect the people,” she countered. <words>255</words>  

Silence stretched between them, fragile as old parchment. <words>263</words>  

Then, the moment arrived—the second where yes or no would decide everything. <words>276</words>  

Elias extended the button. <words>280</words>  

“If we rebuild the bridge together, maybe neither of us has to choose.” <words>291</words>  

Mara hesitated, then took it, her fingers brushing his. <words>300</words>  

A fractal sorrow lingered in her eyes, but something else flickered there, too. <words>312</words>  

Hope. <words>313</words>  

The Library of Aetheris awaited, its books whispering of forgotten unity. <words>324</words>  

And for the first time in years, Elias believed they could listen. <words>334</words>
