The cracked mirror reflected a face that no longer belonged anywhere. <words>10</words>  

Jonas, a deserter from a war no one remembered, traced the fractures with a calloused finger. <words>22</words>  

He had fled not from fear, but from the unbearable weight of repetition. <words>31</words>  

The cycle of orders, violence, and regret had spun him dizzy, yet he remained grounded in his need to escape. <words>45</words>  

Now, he worked in a secluded research facility studying plant communication, where silence was both a refuge and a sentence. <words>59</words>  

The scientists spoke of roots whispering secrets through the soil, of leaves trembling with messages unseen. <words>71</words>  

Jonas listened, hoping the plants might tell him where he belonged. <words>80</words>  

In the evenings, he reconstructed stories from shattered porcelain masks, piecing together forgotten faces. <words>92</words>  

Each fragment held a history, a whisper of someone who had once worn it. <words>103</words>  

He arranged them like jigsaw puzzles, searching for meaning in the fractures. <words>114</words>  

One night, as he worked, the lab’s lead researcher, Dr. Lorne, approached. <words>125</words>  

“You spend so much time with broken things,” she observed. <words>133</words>  

Jonas shrugged, his fingers tracing the porcelain’s jagged edges. <words>142</words>  

“Everything breaks,” he murmured. <words>146</words>  

Dr. Lorne hesitated, then placed a charred leaf beside him. <words>155</words>  

“This plant,” she said, “communicates through fire. It carbonizes its own leaves to send warnings.” <words>168</words>  

Jonas studied the blackened veins, a message written in destruction. <words>178</words>  

“Burning to speak,” he said. <words>182</words>  

Dr. Lorne nodded. <words>184</words>  

“Sometimes, breaking is the only way to be heard.” <words>192</words>  

Jonas thought of the war, of the endless cycle he had fled. <words>202</words>  

He thought of the masks, the mirror, the plants whispering underground. <words>212</words>  

Perhaps belonging wasn’t a place, but a pattern waiting to be rewritten. <words>222</words>  

The next day, he shattered the cracked mirror completely. <words>231</words>  

He took the shards and arranged them among the porcelain masks. <words>241</words>  

A new puzzle, a new story—one that did not repeat the past. <words>252</words>  

As he worked, the plants rustled, their unseen voices humming through the soil. <words>263</words>  

Jonas listened, and for the first time, he spoke back. <words>272</words>
