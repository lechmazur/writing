The temple in the clouds stood silent, its marble pillars veiled in mist. <words>12</words>  

Inside, Lior traced his fingers over an antique lace pattern draped across the altar. <words>24</words>  

The instructions woven into its delicate threads whispered secrets only the patient could decipher. <words>36</words>  

He had come to rekindle something lost, though he barely understood what. <words>47</words>  

The hush after a cashier closes out the register had always been his favorite time. <words>60</words>  

It was then that the world exhaled, and he could listen without distraction. <words>72</words>  

Now, in this temple, he sought to learn the language of the heart. <words>84</words>  

A subtle illusionist by trade, Lior had spent years crafting deceptions. <words>95</words>  

Yet, he longed for something real, something beyond sleight of hand. <words>107</words>  

The lace’s pattern shifted under his gaze, revealing symbols he barely recognized. <words>119</words>  

Casually intense, he studied them, his mind threading meaning from the woven design. <words>132</words>  

The understory grows, the lace seemed to murmur, its message both cryptic and clear. <words>145</words>  

Lior frowned, recalling the unmarked binder clip in his pocket. <words>156</words>  

It had been left for him at the market, attached to a blank page. <words>169</words>  

A test, perhaps, or an invitation—he wasn’t sure which. <words>180</words>  

He placed the clip on the lace, watching as the fabric pulsed beneath it. <words>193</words>  

The temple’s air thickened, the mist curling inward like breath drawn deep. <words>205</words>  

A voice, neither male nor female, resonated from the stone walls. <words>216</words>  

“You seek to understand, but do you seek to listen?” <words>225</words>  

Lior hesitated, then nodded, though no one was there to see. <words>237</words>  

The lace unraveled, its threads weaving into the air, forming luminous script. <words>249</words>  

Each word pulsed with meaning, bypassing logic and sinking into his chest. <words>261</words>  

The understory grows—not in the canopy, but beneath, unseen yet vital. <words>273</words>  

Lior’s illusions had always been about spectacle, about what dazzled the eye. <words>285</words>  

But the heart’s language was different, quieter, rooted in what lay beneath. <words>297</words>  

He exhaled, feeling something shift within him, something long dormant stirring. <words>309</words>  

The temple’s mist receded, revealing a path he hadn’t noticed before. <words>321</words>  

He picked up the binder clip, fastening the blank page to his sleeve. <words>333</words>  

Perhaps understanding wasn’t about creating illusions, but about seeing through them. <words>345</words>  

With a final glance at the altar, he stepped forward, ready to listen. <words>357</words>
