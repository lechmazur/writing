The observation deck of the abandoned space station creaked under the weight of time, its vast windows framing a dead Earth below. <words>19</words>  

Joren, a shipwrecked merchant of forgotten trade routes, stood alone, clutching a rustic butter churn like a relic of defiance. <words>38</words>  

His reflection in the glass was honestly strange—gaunt, wild-eyed, draped in tattered silks that once spoke of wealth. <words>54</words>  

He had survived the fall of civilization, the last tree collapsing in a silent surrender to the poisoned winds. <words>71</words>  

Yet here he was, marooned in orbit, staring down at the grand illusion he had once believed in. <words>88</words>  

The station’s artificial gravity hummed inconsistently, flickering like the rebellious sparks that danced along exposed wiring. <words>105</words>  

Joren smirked; rebellion was all that remained now. <words>112</words>  

He had spent years bartering in the void, trading goods between colonies that no longer existed. <words>128</words>  

Now, his only possession of worth was the butter churn, a relic of a world that had devoured itself. <words>146</words>  

He traced its wooden frame, feeling the grooves worn smooth by hands long turned to dust. <words>162</words>  

The churn was absurd here, in this sterile ruin of metal and silence, yet it was his last tether to meaning. <words>181</words>  

He turned away from the window, his gaze settling on a faded travel poster peeling from the bulkhead. <words>197</words>  

It depicted a paradise that had never existed—lush forests, golden fields, a sky untainted by industry’s greed. <words>214</words>  

Joren reached out, fingers curling around the flaking edges, and pulled. <words>226</words>  

The paper tore in strips, revealing a maintenance shaft behind it, a forgotten path upward. <words>242</words>  

He exhaled sharply, gripping the churn tighter, and began to ascend. <words>255</words>  

The climb was treacherous, the metal rungs rusted, the air thick with the scent of decay. <words>272</words>  

Each pull of his body upward felt like a rejection of the lie he had once lived. <words>288</words>  

He reached the uppermost level, a forgotten control room bathed in the cold glow of failing monitors. <words>305</words>  

The station’s systems flickered, whispering of a world that had moved on without him. <words>320</words>  

Joren placed the butter churn on the console, its presence an absurd challenge to the sterile machinery. <words>337</words>  

He activated the last remaining broadcast channel, his voice steady despite the void pressing in. <words>353</words>  

“The illusion is shattered,” he declared, his aloof passion cutting through the static. <words>366</words>  

“There is no paradise, no return—only what we make from the wreckage.” <words>379</words>  

The station groaned as if in agreement, the rebellious sparks flaring one last time. <words>394</words>  

Joren smiled, watching the churn’s shadow stretch across the dying screens. <words>407</words>  

He had ascended beyond the lie, and that was enough. <words>419</words>
