The frost giant’s lair was colder than expected, but Elias had long since learned to embrace solitude. <words>18</words> He sat at the stone table, his journal open, the black rose pinned inside its pages. <words>33</words> The petals had dried, but their meaning had not. <words>41</words>  

Across from him, the frost giant rumbled, shifting the board game between them. <words>53</words> The game was ancient, its rules obscure, but Elias had studied them well. <words>67</words> He was a collector—not of objects, but of victories over despair. <words>80</words>  

The frost giant’s breath misted in the air as he moved his piece. <words>92</words> Elias watched, calculating, unraveling the strategy hidden beneath the giant’s slow deliberation. <words>106</words> He was seldom odd, but always precise. <words>115</words>  

A sudden invitation to a party had brought him here, though he had never been one for gatherings. <words>131</words> The invitation had been carved into ice, delivered by a raven with eyes like frozen stars. <words>147</words> He had accepted, not for the company, but for the challenge. <words>161</words>  

The game continued, each round tightening the tension between them. <words>172</words> The frost giant played with brute force, but Elias played with patience. <words>185</words> He had spent years mastering the art of solitude, refining his mind against the cold. <words>200</words>  

Despair was the true opponent, the alpha predator lurking in the shadows of his thoughts. <words>215</words> He had faced it before, and he would face it again. <words>228</words>  

The black rose in his journal was a reminder of that battle. <words>240</words> A token from a time when he had nearly lost himself. <words>253</words>  

The frost giant grunted, frustrated. <words>258</words> Elias moved his final piece, sealing his victory. <words>267</words> The giant stared at the board, then let out a booming laugh. <words>280</words>  

“You are a strange one,” the giant said, shaking his head. <words>292</words>  

Elias smiled, closing his journal. <words>298</words> “I prefer ‘focused.’” <words>301</words>  

The giant nodded, then gestured toward the cavern’s entrance. <words>312</words> “You have won. The path is yours.” <words>322</words>  

Elias stood, feeling the weight of the cold lift slightly. <words>334</words> He had triumphed, not just in the game, but over something deeper. <words>349</words>  

As he stepped into the icy wind, he knew solitude was not a curse. <words>363</words> It was a choice, a discipline, a shield against the world’s chaos. <words>377</words>  

And sometimes, it was the only way to win. <words>386</words>
