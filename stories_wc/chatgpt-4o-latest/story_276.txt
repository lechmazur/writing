Emissary Lorne adjusted his collar, the thin coathanger inside his jacket pressing awkwardly against his spine. <words>14</words>  

He had been sent to the orbital debris tracking station as a diplomat, though he felt more like a janitor. <words>30</words>  

The station’s corridors were cluttered with outdated equipment, blinking consoles, and the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door in the break room. <words>48</words>  

Each postcard bore a different world, a different sky, a different message scrawled in fading ink. <words>61</words>  

Lorne had come here to negotiate, but the station’s crew seemed more interested in their picnics—strange, floating affairs held in the low gravity of the observation deck. <words>82</words>  

They would tether themselves to railings, unwrap sandwiches, and speak in riddles about the universe. <words>96</words>  

He lurched through the station’s narrow halls, his balance unsteady in the artificial gravity. <words>110</words>  

Commander Vey, a woman with a consistently surprising way of speaking, greeted him with a knowing smile. <words>126</words>  

“You’re here to learn universal patterns,” she said, as if reading his thoughts. <words>138</words>  

Lorne hesitated, then nodded. <words>142</words>  

Vey gestured toward the observation deck, where the debris of forgotten missions drifted like branches of redemption, remnants of past mistakes waiting to be repurposed. <words>165</words>  

“Everything follows a pattern,” she continued. <words>172</words>  

“Even chaos?” Lorne asked. <words>177</words>  

“Especially chaos.” <words>179</words>  

She handed him a tablet displaying orbital trajectories, each line a thread in an unseen tapestry. <words>195</words>  

Lorne traced the paths with his finger, feeling the weight of history in each arc. <words>209</words>  

He had come expecting negotiations, but instead, he found himself drawn into something deeper. <words>224</words>  

The station’s crew spoke in metaphors, their wisdom accidental yet profound. <words>237</words>  

During one picnic, an engineer compared debris tracking to untangling a coathanger—frustrating, intricate, but ultimately revealing a hidden order. <words>257</words>  

Lorne found himself listening more than speaking, absorbing their insights like a sponge. <words>271</words>  

He began to see the station not as a relic, but as a place of quiet revelation. <words>286</words>  

One evening, as he watched a derelict satellite tumble through space, he understood. <words>299</words>  

Redemption wasn’t about erasing the past; it was about finding new purpose in what remained. <words>314</words>  

When his mission ended, he left not as an emissary, but as a student. <words>327</words>  

The postcards on the fridge rustled as he passed, whispering their silent farewells. <words>341</words>  

As he stepped into the shuttle, he realized he had learned more than he had ever expected. <words>356</words>  

The universe was a mess of broken things, but even in the wreckage, there was meaning. <words>371</words>  

And sometimes, wisdom arrived not through grand declarations, but through the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door. <words>391</words>
