The frail guard stood at the edge of the tidal island, his breath shallow as he traced the latest message carved into the bark of a gnarled tree. <words>17</words> The words were brief but urgent, another piece of the puzzle guiding him toward escape. <words>30</words> He had spent years deciphering these hidden messages, left by those who had come before. <words>44</words> Each carving was a whisper from the past, a plea to break free from a predetermined fate. <words>59</words>  

The island was a prison in all but name, its shifting tides dictating when one could leave or remain trapped. <words>76</words> The guard had once believed in his duty, but time had worn him down. <words>89</words> His body was weak, his resolve both resolute and wavering, a contradiction he could not reconcile. <words>105</words>  

In his trembling hands, he held a sour-smelling alchemy phial, its contents swirling with an eerie luminescence. <words>120</words> It had been smuggled to him by a sympathizer, someone who had seen the painted allegiances on his skin. <words>137</words> The markings were meant to signify loyalty, but he had altered them subtly, shifting their meaning. <words>152</words> To the untrained eye, he was still a servant of the island’s rulers. <words>165</words> To those who knew how to read between the lines, he was something else entirely. <words>180</words>  

The phial’s contents were his last hope. <words>185</words> He had been told it would weaken the chains that bound him, though the method of escape remained unclear. <words>201</words> The messages in the bark had led him here, to this moment, to this choice. <words>215</words>  

A distant horn sounded, signaling the beginning of sorting. <words>223</words> The island’s inhabitants were divided, their fates determined by unseen hands. <words>235</words> He had watched too many be taken, their futures decided before they could resist. <words>249</words> He would not be among them. <words>254</words>  

With a deep breath, he yanked the cork from the phial and drank. <words>263</words> The taste was acrid, burning his throat as it slid down. <words>274</words> For a moment, nothing happened. <words>279</words> Then, a warmth spread through his limbs, a strength he had not felt in years. <words>294</words>  

The tide was receding. <words>298</words> He stumbled toward the shore, his body no longer frail but filled with a strange energy. <words>313</words> The messages had promised freedom, but only to those who dared to take it. <words>327</words>  

As the water pulled away, revealing a hidden path of stones, he stepped forward. <words>340</words> Behind him, the island remained, its painted allegiances unchanged, its prisoners unaware of what lay beyond. <words>357</words>  

Hope and melancholy intertwined as he walked, leaving behind the fate that had once seemed inescapable. <words>371</words>
