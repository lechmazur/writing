Detective Elias Vance stood in the Vanishing Point Gallery, the hush after the final siren pressing against his ears like a held breath. <words>19</words>  

The city outside had collapsed into silence, but inside, the walls still pulsed with the echoes of forgotten lives. <words>36</words>  

He rummaged through his coat pocket, fingers brushing against the single playing card he’d found at the crime scene. <words>53</words>  

A queen of spades, edges worn, a faint smear of blood along its border. <words>65</words>  

It was a clue, or maybe just another ghost in a case that had already stolen too much of him. <words>83</words>  

He was overworked, running on fumes and bad coffee, but stopping wasn’t an option—not yet. <words>99</words>  

The memories clawed at him, surfacing in fleeting images through the half-damaged kaleidoscope he carried. <words>115</words>  

A relic from another life, another case, another failure. <words>122</words>  

He lifted it to his eye, twisting the cracked cylinder, watching as fractured colors bled into one another. <words>140</words>  

A woman’s laughter, sharp as glass. <words>146</words>  

A hand slipping from his grasp. <words>151</words>  

The scent of rain on pavement, the taste of regret. <words>160</words>  

He exhaled sharply, lowering the kaleidoscope, grounding himself in the present. <words>172</words>  

The gallery stretched before him, its paintings shifting in the dim light, each piece a doorway to something lost. <words>190</words>  

He was here for answers, but the place felt like a mausoleum of forgotten truths. <words>204</words>  

A voice cut through the silence, smooth, knowing. <words>213</words>  

“You look like a man chasing ghosts.” <words>220</words>  

Vance turned, molten sarcasm curling his lips. <words>228</words>  

“Ghosts are easier to catch than the living.” <words>236</words>  

The woman leaned against a pillar, confidence draped over her like a well-tailored coat. <words>249</words>  

Her eyes flicked to the playing card in his hand. <words>258</words>  

“You think that’s the key?” she asked. <words>266</words>  

“I think it’s a door,” he said, “but I’m confidently unsure about where it leads.” <words>280</words>  

She smirked. <words>282</words>  

“Then you’re exactly where you need to be.” <words>290</words>  

Vance studied her, the way she stood just outside the light, as if she belonged to the shadows. <words>307</words>  

Memories stirred again, unbidden. <words>312</words>  

A dance he’d once known, a rhythm he’d lost. <words>321</words>  

He wasn’t here to solve a case. <words>328</words>  

He was here to outdance a looming inevitability. <words>337</words>  

The past was closing in, and he had only moments left to move before it swallowed him whole. <words>353</words>  

He flipped the card between his fingers, feeling its weight, its history. <words>365</words>  

Then, with a breath that tasted like surrender, he stepped forward. <words>377</words>  

The gallery shifted around him, the paintings warping, the air thick with something unsaid. <words>392</words>  

The woman watched, waiting. <words>397</words>  

Vance smiled, a tired, knowing thing. <words>405</words>  

“Let’s see where this door leads.” <words>412</words>  

And he walked through. <words>416</words>
