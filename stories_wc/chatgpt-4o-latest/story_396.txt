Étienne shuffled through the dimly lit champagne vault beneath Paris, his fingers brushing against the cool stone walls. <words>12</words>  

He was an urban forager, but not for food—his treasures were forgotten relics, discarded beauty. <words>26</words>  

Tonight, he sought something rare, something worth shielding from careless hands. <words>35</words>  

A fragment of a stained-glass window rested in his pocket, its colors flickering under the low light. <words>49</words>  

He had found it wedged between two crumbling bricks in an abandoned chapel, a fragile wonder too delicate for the world above. <words>66</words>  

Étienne had meant to deliver it to a conservator, but he had forgotten—again. <words>78</words>  

His charming forgetfulness had cost him before, but tonight, it might save him. <words>91</words>  

The vault was not empty. <words>95</words>  

A science fair had taken an unexpected turn, its participants ushered into the underground space for a final demonstration. <words>111</words>  

Among them stood Dr. Lillian Graves, an American physicist with sharp eyes and a sharper tongue. <words>125</words>  

She was here to unveil a new method of glass reinforcement, a breakthrough that could change restoration forever. <words>140</words>  

Étienne watched from the shadows, disinterested yet drawn in by the passion of those around him. <words>155</words>  

The clash was inevitable. <words>158</words>  

Lillian’s work threatened the philosophy of preservation Étienne held dear—restoration through reinforcement, not reverence. <words>174</words>  

To her, history was a puzzle to be solved; to him, it was a whisper to be preserved. <words>189</words>  

A chance encounter brought them face to face as the final performance of the fair began. <words>204</words>  

Étienne, distracted, bumped into her, nearly dropping the stained-glass fragment. <words>216</words>  

Lillian caught it, her fingers tracing the delicate edges. <words>226</words>  

“This is remarkable,” she murmured, tilting it toward the light. <words>236</words>  

Étienne hesitated, then spoke. <words>240</words>  

“It belongs to a forgotten chapel,” he said. <words>248</words>  

Lillian’s brow furrowed. <words>251</words>  

“It could be reinforced, made stronger,” she suggested. <words>260</words>  

Étienne shook his head. <words>263</words>  

“Some things should remain fragile,” he countered. <words>271</words>  

A negotiation began, not of money, but of ideals. <words>281</words>  

Lillian argued for preservation through science; Étienne, for preservation through stillness. <words>293</words>  

The performance continued around them, but their debate became its own spectacle. <words>306</words>  

In the end, Étienne made his choice. <words>312</words>  

He placed the fragment back in his pocket, shielding it from the world. <words>325</words>  

Lillian sighed but smiled. <words>330</words>  

“Charming, but forgetful,” she mused. <words>337</words>  

Étienne smirked. <words>340</words>  

“Perhaps,” he admitted, disappearing into the vault’s shadows once more. <words>350</words>  

The stained glass remained untouched, a fragile wonder safe for another day. <words>363</words>
