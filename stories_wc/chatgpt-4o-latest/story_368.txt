Jace had learned to survive in the alleys, where luck was a currency and trust was a debt. <words>19</words>  

The cameo brooch he wore, scavenged from a forgotten chest, pulsed with a whispering curse. <words>36</words>  

It murmured echoes of a voice he had never known, distant yet familiar, threading through his thoughts. <words>54</words>  

The brooch’s influence was theoretically random, its effects unpredictable—sometimes fortune, sometimes misfortune. <words>69</words>  

Yet Jace had begun to notice a pattern, one that reversed itself when least expected. <words>86</words>  

He followed its pull through the ruins of a lost orchard temple, vines heavy with forgotten fruit. <words>105</words>  

The air smelled of overripe sweetness, a contrast to the decay of stone and time. <words>122</words>  

He traced the temple’s carvings, their meaning lost across an unwritten calendar of ages. <words>138</words>  

The brooch burned cold against his skin, urging him deeper into the temple’s heart. <words>154</words>  

There, beneath a collapsed archway, he found a mosaic depicting reversed patterns of light and shadow. <words>173</words>  

The image shifted as he stared, revealing a hidden path beneath the vines. <words>188</words>  

Jace hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at him, but he had learned to trust confident uncertainty. <words>206</words>  

He stepped forward, the brooch’s whisper growing louder, guiding him through the concealed passage. <words>222</words>  

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of forgotten harvests, fruit untouched by time. <words>239</words>  

At the chamber’s center stood a tree, its branches heavy with luminous, pulsing fruit. <words>256</words>  

The echoes in his mind coalesced into a single voice—soft, knowing, waiting. <words>271</words>  

Jace reached out, plucking a fruit, its glow dimming as it rested in his palm. <words>289</words>  

The brooch’s curse surged, reversing the decay around him, restoring the temple’s lost splendor. <words>307</words>  

The walls straightened, vines coiled back, and the air filled with the hum of renewal. <words>324</words>  

Jace understood then—this place had been waiting for him, for the brooch, for the cycle to turn. <words>344</words>  

He had come to harvest hope from darkness, to contrast ruin with rebirth. <words>359</words>  

The fruit in his hand pulsed once more, then settled into stillness. <words>374</words>  

The voice in the brooch faded, its purpose fulfilled, its curse lifted. <words>389</words>  

Jace stepped back into the world, the temple behind him no longer lost. <words>404</words>  

He had been an orphan of the streets, but now he carried something greater. <words>421</words>  

Not just survival, but the knowledge that even in ruin, renewal could be found. <words>437</words>  

And as he walked, the distant echo of the past became the promise of tomorrow. <words>454</words>
