The ghost train rattled through the abandoned amusement park, its rusted tracks groaning under the weight of time. <words>14</words>  

Inside, Ezra sat cross-legged, a cracked porcelain teapot balanced on his knee. <words>26</words>  

He poured himself a cup of bitter herbal tea, steam curling like whispers in the dim carriage. <words>39</words>  

Ezra had once been a prodigy, a name whispered in reverence among pathfinders. <words>50</words>  

But he had vanished, slipping into obscurity like a shadow at dusk. <words>61</words>  

Now, he trained in solitude, running endless miles through the skeletal remains of the park. <words>74</words>  

His marathon training was more than endurance—it was a ritual, a meditation. <words>85</words>  

Each step carried him deeper into forgotten paths, where secrets lay buried beneath dust and neglect. <words>98</words>  

He had a mission: to preserve the old ways, the folk medicines lost to time. <words>110</words>  

The world had moved on, but Ezra refused to let the knowledge fade. <words>121</words>  

His methods were unconventional—hacking bizarre music playlists, embedding hidden track info with ancient remedies. <words>135</words>  

Only those who knew where to look would find the cures woven into melodies. <words>147</words>  

Tonight, he waited for a contact, someone who had deciphered his latest message. <words>160</words>  

The ghost train lurched, and a figure stepped into the carriage, eyes wary. <words>172</words>  

A woman, her breath heavy from running, scanned the dim space. <words>183</words>  

"You’re Ezra," she said, voice edged with both awe and skepticism. <words>194</words>  

He nodded, pouring her tea from the fractured teapot. <words>203</words>  

She hesitated before accepting, fingers brushing the porcelain’s jagged edge. <words>214</words>  

"I found your track," she admitted. "The one about feverroot." <words>225</words>  

Ezra studied her, his expression an aloof passion, both distant and intense. <words>237</words>  

"Why do you seek it?" he asked, voice calm yet demanding. <words>248</words>  

"My brother is sick," she said. "Doctors don’t know what it is." <words>260</words>  

Ezra exhaled, a mix of frustration and peace settling over him. <words>271</words>  

Angrily peaceful—that was how he always felt about the world’s neglect. <words>283</words>  

He reached into his satchel, pulling out a small bundle of dried feverroot. <words>295</words>  

"Boil this," he instructed. "Three nights. No more, no less." <words>306</words>  

She clutched the bundle, eyes glistening with something between gratitude and disbelief. <words>318</words>  

"Thank you," she whispered. <words>321</words>  

Ezra simply nodded, his focus already shifting to the next path ahead. <words>333</words>  

Before she left, she surprised him—wrapping him in a brief, firm hug. <words>345</words>  

For a moment, the ghost train felt less haunted, less forgotten. <words>356</words>  

Then she was gone, and Ezra was alone again, listening to the tracks groan. <words>369</words>  

He sipped his tea, the bitter taste grounding him in his purpose. <words>380</words>  

The world might forget, but he would remember. <words>387</words>  

And as long as he ran, as long as he searched, the knowledge would endure. <words>400</words>
