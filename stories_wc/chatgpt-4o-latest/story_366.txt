Jessa wiped her hands on her apron, the scent of espresso clinging to her fingers. <words>12</words>  

The transmission repair dock hummed with the sounds of hydraulic lifts and clanking tools. <words>24</words>  

She wasn’t supposed to be here—her shift at the café had ended hours ago. <words>36</words>  

But she had a theory, and theories demanded testing. <words>44</words>  

The journals, bound in cracked leather, sat beside her on the workbench. <words>55</words>  

They belonged to her grandfather, a meteorologist obsessed with decoding weather patterns. <words>67</words>  

He had believed that ice crystals in glaciers held a secret language. <words>78</words>  

Jessa, a telepathic barista, had inherited his obsession. <words>86</words>  

She also inherited his noble foolishness. <words>92</words>  

Her ability to read minds made her an efficient worker—too efficient. <words>104</words>  

She brewed coffee before customers even placed their orders. <words>113</words>  

But efficiency wasn’t always success. <words>118</words>  

She had learned that the hard way. <words>124</words>  

People liked the illusion of choice, the ritual of ordering. <words>134</words>  

So she had learned to be inefficient—efficiently so. <words>143</words>  

Now, she applied that same paradox to decoding the journals. <words>153</words>  

The dock’s owner, a grizzled mechanic named Lorne, watched her work. <words>164</words>  

“You’re wasting your time,” he grunted. <words>170</words>  

She ignored him, tracing the pattern of ice crystals in a photograph. <words>182</words>  

The journals suggested that weather could be predicted by these formations. <words>194</words>  

If she could crack the code, she could redefine success itself. <words>205</words>  

Not just for herself, but for her grandfather’s legacy. <words>214</words>  

A gust of wind rattled the dock’s metal walls. <words>223</words>  

The seasons were shifting, and she felt the urgency. <words>233</words>  

She reached into her pocket and pulled out a vintage button hook. <words>245</words>  

It had belonged to her grandmother, a relic of another time. <words>256</words>  

She turned it over in her fingers, lost in thought. <words>266</words>  

The hook’s curve reminded her of the swirling ice formations. <words>277</words>  

A pattern within a pattern. <words>281</words>  

She grabbed a sheet of tracing paper and began sketching. <words>290</words>  

Lorne sighed, shaking his head. <words>295</words>  

“You’re trying to cloak chaos in logic,” he muttered. <words>305</words>  

Jessa smiled. <words>307</words>  

“Maybe,” she admitted. <words>310</words>  

But noble foolishness had its place. <words>316</words>  

She layered the sketches over the journal’s notes. <words>325</words>  

The patterns aligned in a way she hadn’t expected. <words>335</words>  

Her breath caught. <words>338</words>  

She wasn’t just chasing ghosts—there was something here. <words>349</words>  

Lorne peered over her shoulder, frowning. <words>357</words>  

“Well, I’ll be damned,” he murmured. <words>364</words>  

Jessa exhaled, her heart pounding. <words>371</words>  

Success wasn’t about speed or certainty. <words>377</words>  

It was about persistence, about seeing patterns others ignored. <words>388</words>  

She had spent years hiding her gift, cloaking it in normalcy. <words>400</words>  

But maybe, just maybe, it was time to embrace it. <words>410</words>  

The seasons were changing, and so was she. <words>418</words>  

She picked up her pen and kept working. <words>426</words>
