The scent of drying pigments filled the air as Lysandra dipped her brush into the swirling mix of ochre and crimson. <words>19</words>  

She worked in the back room of her funeral parlor, where tradition dictated that every coffin be adorned with a final, personal touch. <words>40</words>  

Her great-grandfather, a man of peculiar habits, had started this practice, believing that death should be as vibrant as life. <words>59</words>  

Now, as the last glamorous undertaker in her lineage, she upheld the ritual with fruitless patience, waiting for the world to appreciate its beauty. <words>81</words>  

She sighed, setting down her brush, and reached for the brass measuring tape that had belonged to her ancestor. <words>99</words>  

It was tarnished but still precise, its numbers etched deep from generations of use. <words>113</words>  

She pulled it taut, measuring the length of the coffin, ensuring the proportions were perfect before she continued painting. <words>133</words>  

Outside, the world had forgotten the artistry of her craft, dismissing it as ordinary, a mere necessity rather than a sacred duty. <words>154</words>  

But Lysandra knew better—there was no such thing as ordinariness, only myths people told themselves to avoid wonder. <words>175</words>  

She turned to her computer, opening the social network archive where she stored images of her most exquisite work. <words>195</words>  

Each coffin was a masterpiece, a final canvas for the departed, yet few ever saw them before they were buried. <words>216</words>  

She scrolled through the comments, most of them indifferent, some mocking, but a few—just a few—understood. <words>235</words>  

A notification popped up: a request from a family who wanted their father’s coffin elongated to fit his towering frame. <words>256</words>  

She smiled, running her fingers over the brass tape, recalling how her great-grandfather had once done the same. <words>276</words>  

Elongation was an art in itself, requiring balance, proportion, and an understanding of the body’s final rest. <words>295</words>  

She accepted the request, feeling a jubilant remorse that such beauty was only appreciated in death. <words>314</words>  

As she mixed a new batch of paint, she thought of the myth of ordinariness, how people clung to it for comfort. <words>335</words>  

But in her world, nothing was ordinary—not the dead, not the living, and certainly not the art of farewell. <words>355</words>  

She would continue, as her ancestor had, preserving ancient practices in a world too hurried to notice. <words>374</words>  

And perhaps, one day, someone would look at her work and see not just a coffin, but a story worth remembering. <words>396</words>
