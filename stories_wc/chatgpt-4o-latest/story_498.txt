The nervous kingpin sat hunched over his collection of dried seed pods, fingers twitching as he traced their brittle edges. <words>14</words>  

Through the restless hush of midwinter, his breath fogged the cracked window of his hideout in the xenophobic enclave. <words>30</words>  

He had built his empire on fear, but now fear gnawed at him in return. <words>41</words>  

The enclave had grown hostile to outsiders, and even he, its architect, felt the walls closing in. <words>57</words>  

His unlikely probable dream—communal gardens thriving in the heart of this cold, closed world—was slipping through his grasp. <words>73</words>  

He had amassed power not for greed, but to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference. <words>88</words>  

Yet his men whispered that he had grown weak, that his obsession with the gardens would undo him. <words>104</words>  

A knock at the door unsettled him, and he reached for the pistol beneath his chair. <words>118</words>  

It was Jonas, his most trusted lieutenant, though trust was a brittle thing these days. <words>132</words>  

“The council’s meeting,” Jonas said, voice low. “They want to shut the gardens down.” <words>146</words>  

The kingpin exhaled sharply, his fingers tightening around a seed pod until it cracked. <words>160</words>  

“They fear what grows beyond their control,” he murmured, standing. <words>171</words>  

Jonas hesitated. “They say it invites outsiders. Weakens our borders.” <words>183</words>  

The kingpin laughed, a sound both bitter and fragile. <words>192</words>  

“Life isn’t a border,” he said. “It’s a root, spreading whether they like it or not.” <words>207</words>  

He grabbed his coat and stepped into the frozen streets, Jonas trailing behind. <words>220</words>  

On the way to the council hall, a sign caught his eye—an old landmark, half-forgotten. <words>236</words>  

“Take a detour,” he ordered. <words>241</words>  

Jonas frowned but obeyed, steering them toward the crumbling monument. <words>253</words>  

It was a statue of the enclave’s founder, a man who had once preached unity. <words>267</words>  

Snow clung to the inscription: “Strength through growth.” <words>275</words>  

The kingpin traced the words, his breath shallow. <words>284</words>  

“They’ve forgotten,” he said. <words>289</words>  

Jonas shifted uneasily. “Maybe they never believed it.” <words>299</words>  

The kingpin turned, eyes burning. “Then we remind them.” <words>309</words>  

At the council hall, the air was thick with suspicion. <words>319</words>  

The elders sat in a semicircle, their gazes sharp. <words>329</words>  

“The gardens must be dismantled,” one declared. <words>338</words>  

The kingpin stepped forward, holding up a dried seed pod. <words>350</words>  

“This,” he said, voice steady, “is not a threat. It is survival.” <words>364</words>  

Murmurs rippled through the room. <words>370</words>  

“You built this enclave on fear,” another elder said. <words>381</words>  

The kingpin nodded. “And now I build on hope.” <words>391</words>  

Silence stretched, fragile yet charged. <words>399</words>  

Then, an elder reached out, fingers brushing the seed pod. <words>411</words>  

A single nod. <words>414</words>  

The line held. <words>417</words>
