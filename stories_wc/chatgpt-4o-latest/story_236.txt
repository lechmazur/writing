The underwater city planning office stood in eerie silence, its glass walls refracting the dim glow of bioluminescent algae. <words>16</words>  

Here, across the hush of time’s final ripple, a meek blacksmith named Elias waited, his calloused hands clutching a softcover dictionary. <words>34</words>  

The book was worn, its pages dog-eared from years of searching for words he could never quite find. <words>47</words>  

He had come to settle an unfinished bargain, one that had bound him to this place long before he understood its cost. <words>64</words>  

The clerk, a gaunt figure with translucent skin, peered at him with eyes like polished pearls. <words>77</words>  

"You return," the clerk murmured, voice carrying the weight of tides long past. <words>87</words>  

Elias nodded, his grip tightening on the dictionary as if it contained the answer to his sorrow. <words>100</words>  

"I need to ignite the forge again," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>113</words>  

The clerk’s gills flared slightly. <words>117</words>  

"Your bargain was left unfinished," they said. <words>123</words>  

Elias knew this well—he had once traded his skill for a promise, one that had never been fulfilled. <words>140</words>  

The forge had gone cold, and with it, the love he had tried to shape into permanence. <words>154</words>  

Now, he sought to harness heartbreak as fuel, to temper regret into something lasting. <words>168</words>  

The clerk gestured toward a ledger, its ink shifting like restless currents. <words>179</words>  

"Your debt remains," they said. <words>185</words>  

Elias hesitated, then opened the dictionary, flipping through pages filled with definitions he had memorized but never mastered. <words>202</words>  

"Words are openly hidden," he murmured. <words>208</words>  

The clerk tilted their head. <words>212</words>  

"Explain." <words>213</words>  

Elias exhaled. <words>215</words>  

"I have spent years verifying half-baked stories from random hitchhikers, searching for truth in their lies." <words>234</words>  

The clerk’s expression remained unreadable. <words>239</words>  

"And?" <words>240</words>  

"I found that every story is unfinished," Elias said. <words>248</words>  

The clerk tapped the ledger. <words>252</words>  

"Then finish yours." <words>255</words>  

Elias closed the dictionary, pressing it against his chest. <words>263</words>  

"I will," he said, stepping forward. <words>270</words>  

The forge awaited, its embers dormant but not dead. <words>280</words>  

He reached out, his fingers trembling as he touched the cold metal. <words>291</words>  

With a deep breath, he whispered the words he had long feared to speak. <words>304</words>  

The forge roared to life, flames licking the air like forgotten memories reignited. <words>317</words>  

The clerk watched, their expression unreadable. <words>323</words>  

Elias felt the weight of his past lift, if only slightly. <words>333</words>  

The bargain was unfinished, but now, at last, it could begin again. <words>344</words>
