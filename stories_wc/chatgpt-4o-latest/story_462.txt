The traveler arrived at the abandoned carnival house of mirrors just as the wind stirred the metal sign above the entrance, tapping out a rhythm that felt both intentional and accidental. <words>22</words>  

He had wandered too long through towns that never felt like home, his mind a cage he could not escape. <words>38</words>  

Inside, the mirrors stood cracked and dust-laden, reflecting versions of himself he barely recognized. <words>50</words>  

He carried a stained glass panel wrapped in cloth, its colors dulled by time but still holding the memory of light. <words>66</words>  

He had found it in the ruins of a chapel, abandoned like everything else he seemed drawn to. <words>80</words>  

The wind outside picked up, the metal sign tapping faster, as if urging him forward. <words>93</words>  

He placed the panel against one of the mirrors, aligning its fractured beauty with his own reflection. <words>108</words>  

The glass caught the dim light filtering through the broken ceiling, casting scattered hues across the room. <words>123</words>  

He exhaled, feeling something shift inside him, a cradle of sparks igniting in the hollow spaces of his mind. <words>140</words>  

He had spent years trying to silence his thoughts, but here, in this forgotten place, they finally felt like something worth listening to. <words>159</words>  

The tapping of the sign outside became rhythmic, almost like a heartbeat, steady and insistent. <words>172</words>  

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of seeds, remnants of a past life he barely remembered. <words>189</words>  

He knelt and pressed them into the dust-covered floor, as if fertilizing the ground with the weight of his own longing. <words>207</words>  

The mirrors reflected his movements, multiplying his act of quiet defiance. <words>218</words>  

He had spent too long running from himself, but here, in the hush before someone finally says, “I love you,” he found stillness. <words>239</words>  

The wind outside howled, the metal sign clanging now, as if marking the moment of his surrender. <words>253</words>  

He traced the edges of the stained glass panel, feeling the roughness of its fractures, the beauty in its imperfection. <words>269</words>  

He had always believed escape meant movement, but perhaps it was something else entirely. <words>282</words>  

Perhaps it was the act of staying, of letting the cradle of sparks within him catch fire. <words>296</words>  

The mirrors shimmered, the colors of the stained glass shifting with the wind’s breath. <words>309</words>  

He closed his eyes, listening to the tapping, the wind, the silence between. <words>322</words>  

For the first time in years, he did not feel lost. <words>333</words>  

He opened his eyes and whispered, “I am here.” <words>343</words>  

The wind carried his words away, but the mirrors held them, reflecting them back in endless echoes. <words>359</words>  

He stood, brushing dust from his hands, and stepped toward the exit. <words>372</words>  

The metal sign swung wildly now, its tapping a farewell, a benediction. <words>385</words>  

He did not know where he would go next, but for the first time, it did not matter. <words>400</words>
