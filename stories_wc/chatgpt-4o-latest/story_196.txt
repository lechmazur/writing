The tired swordsman slumped onto the wooden bench in the quiet breakroom, staring at the plain cloth bag resting beside him. <words>16</words>  

Someone had resigned today—another monk abandoning the floating rock monastery, leaving behind only silence and the scent of burnt incense. <words>33</words>  

He traced the rim of his cup, the tea inside long gone cold, his fingers moving with the absentmindedness of someone fiercely apathetic. <words>50</words>  

Yet, deep within, a spark of defiance still smoldered, refusing to be extinguished by the weight of exhaustion. <words>63</words>  

He had made a hidden promise to himself long ago, one that no resignation, no departure, could shake. <words>77</words>  

The monastery drifted through the sky, its stone foundations untouched by time, but he knew better—everything eroded, even faith. <words>93</words>  

He had come here seeking peace, but peace had never come; only the endless cycle of arrivals and departures remained. <words>108</words>  

The monks spoke of enlightenment, of surrender, but he had never believed in surrender—not truly. <words>121</words>  

Instead, he watched the meteor showers, tracing their paths across the heavens, searching for something beyond the monastery’s floating walls. <words>137</words>  

He had followed them once, long ago, when he still believed in destiny, when his sword had felt lighter in his grip. <words>154</words>  

Now, the blade rested within the plain cloth bag, wrapped in layers of fabric, hidden from prying eyes. <words>169</words>  

He had sworn never to draw it again, yet the weight of it pressed against his leg, a silent reminder. <words>185</words>  

Outside, the sky darkened, and the first streaks of light cut through the void, heralding another meteor shower. <words>199</words>  

He exhaled slowly, watching the celestial fire descend, tracing their arcs with the same quiet reverence as before. <words>214</words>  

The monks called them omens, but he saw them as something else—guides, reminders that movement was still possible. <words>230</words>  

He had overcome so much, yet the greatest battle remained: the one against his own inertia. <words>243</words>  

The monastery would continue floating, the monks would continue preaching, and others would continue leaving. <words>257</words>  

But he would not leave—not yet. <words>262</words>  

Not until he understood why the fire in his chest refused to die, why the stars still called to him. <words>278</words>  

He tightened his grip on the cloth bag, feeling the familiar shape within, and allowed himself a small, knowing smile. <words>294</words>  

Perhaps, one day, he would follow the meteors again. <words>302</words>  

But for now, he would stay, watching, waiting, until the time was right. <words>315</words>  

The breakroom remained silent, the scent of resignation still lingering, but he was not resigned. <words>330</words>  

He was simply resting, gathering strength, preparing for whatever came next. <words>344</words>  

The sky burned with falling stars, and he watched them, unblinking, as if daring them to show him the way. <words>360</words>
