The forgotten underwater city laboratory groaned as shifting currents pressed against its corroded walls. <words>14</words>  
Once, it had been a beacon of progress, but now it lay in ruin, swallowed by time. <words>28</words>  
Amid the wreckage, a brazen raider named Cass moved with practiced ease, her boots echoing on rusted grates. <words>42</words>  
She had come not for treasure, but for a man whose mind still burned despite the world's decay. <words>56</words>  
Dr. Elias Varn, the faltering genius, had locked himself away, refusing to abandon his work. <words>68</words>  
Cass had no patience for stubborn men, but she owed him more than she could admit. <words>82</words>  
She found him hunched over a table, scribbling equations with a piece of charcoal. <words>94</words>  
His fingers were stained black, his eyes hollowed by sleepless nights and unrelenting obsession. <words>108</words>  
"You shouldn't be here," he muttered without looking up. <words>115</words>  
Cass smirked, though the expression felt brittle. <words>121</words>  
"Neither should you," she countered, tossing a ration pack onto his desk. <words>132</words>  
Elias hesitated before snatching it up, hunger overriding pride. <words>141</words>  
Outside, the world was unraveling—riots, betrayals, the collapse of old orders. <words>151</words>  
Cass had seen friends turn on each other for scraps, had felt the sting of misplaced trust. <words>165</words>  
She had learned to move first, to strike before being struck. <words>175</words>  
Yet here she was, risking everything for a man who barely acknowledged her presence. <words>187</words>  
"You have to leave," she said, her voice edged with urgency. <words>197</words>  
Elias exhaled sharply, shaking his head. <words>203</words>  
"My work isn't finished," he said, gripping the charcoal tighter. <words>213</words>  
Cass clenched her fists, frustration warring with something softer. <words>222</words>  
"You always did believe in ghosts," she said, forcing a laugh. <words>232</words>  
Elias finally looked at her, his gaze wary. <words>239</words>  
"You remember that?" he asked. <words>243</words>  
Cass nodded, the memory surfacing despite herself. <words>251</words>  
As children, they had whispered about the echoes of betrayal that haunted this place. <words>263</words>  
Superstition had kept them from venturing too deep, had warned them of unseen dangers. <words>275</words>  
Now, she used that same fear to reach him. <words>283</words>  
"The echoes are real, Elias," she said, stepping closer. <words>292</words>  
"Not ghosts, but people—those who would see you fail." <words>302</words>  
His fingers twitched, charcoal smearing across the page. <words>311</words>  
"You think they'll come for me?" he asked, voice barely above a whisper. <words>322</words>  
Cass nodded, her impulsive thoughtfulness guiding her words. <words>331</words>  
"They already have," she admitted. <words>335</words>  
Elias swallowed hard, the weight of her warning settling in. <words>345</words>  
For the first time, doubt flickered in his eyes. <words>354</words>  
Cass reached out, gripping his wrist. <words>360</words>  
"If you stay, your flame will die here," she said. <words>370</words>  
Elias hesitated, then dropped the charcoal. <words>377</words>  
"Alright," he whispered. <words>380</words>  
Together, they fled the drowning city, leaving its ghosts behind. <words>390</words>  
But the echoes of betrayal would follow them still. <words>400</words>
