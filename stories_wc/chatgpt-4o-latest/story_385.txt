Elliot paced the quiet hospital ward, his fingers tracing the edges of a tattered notebook. <words>11</words> He had spent years chasing symbols older than language itself, but the latest discovery eluded him. <words>24</words> The answer, he was certain, lay in the scattered seeds of forgotten knowledge. <words>33</words>  

Outside, the obsidian skyscraper loomed, its glass reflecting the last remnants of the night. <words>44</words> The city below was still, save for the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer. <words>56</words> Elliot had followed those prints before, knowing they led to something just beyond his grasp. <words>69</words>  

A voice interrupted his thoughts. <words>73</words> "Still chasing ghosts, Elliot?" <words>77</words> He turned to see Marianne, a pleasant meddler with a talent for manipulation. <words>88</words> She smiled, but her eyes gleamed with intent. <words>95</words>  

"You know me," he said, forcing a grin. <words>102</words> "I can't let a mystery rest." <words>108</words>  

Marianne stepped closer, holding a pair of rusted ice skates. <words>117</words> "These were left in the archives," she said. <words>124</words> "Thought they might interest you." <words>129</words>  

Elliot frowned, taking the skates. <words>134</words> The rusted blades bore faint engravings—symbols eerily similar to the ones he studied. <words>146</words> His pulse quickened. <words>149</words>  

"You knew I'd recognize these," he said. <words>155</words>  

Marianne shrugged. <words>157</words> "I weaken your resolve just enough to keep you searching." <words>165</words> "It's what I do." <words>169</words>  

Elliot exhaled sharply. <words>172</words> "And what do you get out of this?" <words>178</words>  

"A front-row seat to the unraveling of history." <words>184</words>  

The symbols on the skates whispered of something buried, something waiting. <words>193</words> He traced them with his thumb, feeling the weight of centuries. <words>202</words>  

"The footprints," he murmured. <words>205</words>  

Marianne tilted her head. <words>208</words> "What about them?" <words>211</words>  

"They always vanish before dawn," Elliot said. <words>217</words> "Like the symbols—always just out of reach." <words>225</words>  

Marianne's smile widened. <words>228</words> "Then perhaps it's time to follow them properly." <words>235</words>  

Elliot hesitated, then nodded. <words>239</words> The quiet shift before sunrise was ending, and the city was waking. <words>249</words> But the real journey was just beginning. <words>254</words>
