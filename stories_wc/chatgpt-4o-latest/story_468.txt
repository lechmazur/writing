The mangrove labyrinth whispered with the voices of singing spirits when the night yielded to golden embers. <words>19</words>  

Mortician Elias Vance stepped carefully, his boots leaving footprints that vanished after a single heartbeat. <words>33</words>  

He had come to collect dream journals, the last remnants of thoughts before death. <words>44</words>  

A tarnished silver bracelet dangled from his wrist, a relic from a corpse that had once intrigued him. <words>59</words>  

The spirits’ melodies wove through the air, a loudly serene chorus that both soothed and unsettled. <words>73</words>  

Elias listened, his curiosity insatiable, his fingers tracing the bracelet’s worn engravings. <words>85</words>  

He had learned to imitate the spirits’ rustling voices, though his own attempts always felt hollow. <words>99</words>  

The labyrinth twisted unpredictably, roots rising like skeletal fingers from the waterlogged earth. <words>112</words>  

Each step erased itself, forcing him to rely on instinct rather than memory. <words>124</words>  

A journal lay ahead, its pages fluttering as if breathing. <words>133</words>  

Elias knelt, brushing away the damp leaves, his pulse quickening. <words>144</words>  

The ink shimmered, revealing fragmented dreams of a lost soul. <words>154</words>  

He read of a woman who had drowned here, her final thoughts tangled in regret. <words>167</words>  

The spirits rustled louder, their voices swelling with revelation. <words>177</words>  

Elias felt the weight of the bracelet grow heavier, as if the past resisted being disturbed. <words>191</words>  

He had always believed that death held secrets worth uncovering. <words>201</words>  

Another footprint appeared beside his own, then vanished. <words>211</words>  

Someone—or something—was imitating him. <words>217</words>  

He turned sharply, but the labyrinth remained empty save for the shifting shadows. <words>230</words>  

The spirits’ song changed, their tones laced with warning. <words>240</words>  

Elias hesitated, then pressed forward, journal in hand. <words>250</words>  

The bracelet burned cold against his skin, pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>261</words>  

A gust of wind carried a whisper: “Not all dreams should be taken.” <words>273</words>  

Elias smirked, his curiosity outweighing caution. <words>282</words>  

He had heard warnings before, yet he always returned. <words>292</words>  

The labyrinth shifted, the mangroves closing in. <words>301</words>  

His footprints vanished faster now, as if the land itself rejected him. <words>314</words>  

The spirits’ song became discordant, their voices clashing. <words>324</words>  

Elias clutched the journal tighter, determined to escape with his prize. <words>336</words>  

The bracelet’s tarnished surface reflected something behind him—something that should not exist. <words>350</words>  

A figure, identical to him, stood watching. <words>358</words>  

It lifted its wrist, revealing an identical bracelet. <words>368</words>  

Elias’ breath caught as the figure imitated his every move. <words>380</words>  

The spirits fell silent, the rustle of revelation settling like dust. <words>392</words>  

The figure smiled, and Elias understood—he had become the next lost soul. <words>405</words>  

The labyrinth swallowed him, his footprints erased forever. <words>414</words>  

The spirits resumed their song, welcoming a new voice into their chorus. <words>425</words>
