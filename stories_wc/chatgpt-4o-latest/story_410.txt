The cavern cathedral pulsed with an eerie glow, its phosphorescent flora casting shifting shadows along the damp stone walls. <words>16</words>  

Deep within, an astute hermit named Lior hunched over a rusted pipe, his fingers trembling with frustration. <words>30</words>  

The water systems had failed again, and without them, the underground sanctuary would wither into dust. <words>42</words>  

He sighed, running a calloused hand through his tangled beard, his isolation gnawing at him like a dull ache. <words>56</words>  

Years alone had sharpened his mind but dulled his spirit, leaving him with only his strangely effective methods for company. <words>71</words>  

He reached for his most trusted tool—a blunt scissor, its edges worn but still capable in his hands. <words>85</words>  

With careful precision, he wedged it into the corroded valve, twisting with all his might. <words>97</words>  

The metal groaned but refused to budge, mocking his efforts with its stubborn silence. <words>109</words>  

Lior exhaled sharply, his breath mingling with the damp air, and considered his next move. <words>122</words>  

He needed to amplify his approach, to coax the system back to life rather than force it. <words>135</words>  

A memory surfaced—one of warmth, of comfort, of the scent of a fresh loaf of bread. <words>149</words>  

It had been years since he’d last tasted one, but he knew its power. <words>161</words>  

With a smirk, he rummaged through his satchel, pulling out a small vial of yeast extract. <words>175</words>  

He uncorked it, letting the scent drift through the cavern, weaving through the bioluminescent tendrils. <words>189</words>  

The air shifted, the flora pulsing in response, as if stirred by the memory of sustenance. <words>202</words>  

Lior watched as condensation formed along the pipes, moisture drawn from the very walls. <words>214</words>  

The scent amplified, curling through the cathedral like an invocation, coaxing the dormant systems awake. <words>228</words>  

A distant gurgle echoed through the chamber, followed by a sputtering cough of water. <words>240</words>  

Lior grinned, his despairing humor bubbling to the surface. <words>247</words>  

“Who knew bread could fix plumbing?” he muttered, shaking his head. <words>257</words>  

The pipes shuddered, releasing a steady trickle, then a stream, then a full cascade. <words>269</words>  

Water surged through the channels, feeding the glowing flora, restoring the cavern’s fragile ecosystem. <words>282</words>  

Lior leaned back, exhaustion settling into his bones, but satisfaction warming his chest. <words>294</words>  

At that moment, far above, an elevator arrived at an empty floor, its doors sliding open to no one. <words>309</words>  

A reminder of the world he had left behind, of the isolation he had chosen. <words>321</words>  

Yet here, in the depths, he had found purpose, however strange his methods. <words>333</words>  

He chuckled, the sound echoing through the cavern, swallowed by the hum of flowing water. <words>346</words>  

Perhaps solitude wasn’t so bad after all. <words>351</words>
