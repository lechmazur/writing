The balloon drifted toward the ceiling, its string twisting like a severed tether. <words>14</words>  

Jonas watched it rise from his cot in the futuristic hospital ward, his fingers tracing invisible lines on his blanket. <words>33</words>  

A cartographer by trade, he had spent years mapping the uncharted, but now he was lost. <words>50</words>  

The rhythmic clang of a hidden blacksmith’s forge echoed in his mind, a sound he had followed once before. <words>71</words>  

It had led him to a village where innocence had been bartered for progress, where children no longer played. <words>92</words>  

He had tried to convince them that maps could preserve what was vanishing, but they had only laughed. <words>111</words>  

Now, in the sterile hush of the ward, he felt that same creeping erosion. <words>126</words>  

A nurse passed by, distantly intimate in her practiced warmth, adjusting the monitors with mechanical precision. <words>147</words>  

Jonas reached for the dictionary on his bedside table, its pages worn from years of travel. <words>166</words>  

Between them lay a dragonfly, pressed and preserved, its delicate wings frozen in time. <words>183</words>  

He had found it in a place where the rivers no longer ran clear, where maps had failed. <words>204</words>  

The corruption of innocence was not always loud; sometimes, it was the quiet loss of wonder. <words>223</words>  

He traced the dragonfly’s fragile form, remembering the child who had given it to him. <words>242</words>  

She had asked if maps could bring back what was lost, and he had no answer. <words>263</words>  

The balloon above him wavered, caught in an air current, its shadow flickering across the ceiling. <words>284</words>  

Jonas closed the dictionary, sealing the dragonfly within, as if preserving a truth he could not voice. <words>305</words>  

He had spent his life charting the world, but he still did not know his place in it. <words>326</words>  

The forge’s clang echoed again in his mind, a call to something he had yet to understand. <words>347</words>  

Perhaps maps were not meant to reclaim the past but to guide the lost toward something new. <words>368</words>  

The balloon reached the ceiling, trembling against the artificial light, and Jonas exhaled, feeling weightless. <words>387</words>  

He would follow the sound again, wherever it led, until he found what he was searching for. <words>408</words>
