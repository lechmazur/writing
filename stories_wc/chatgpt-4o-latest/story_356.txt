Joss leaned against a rusted crate in the dim cargo hold, twirling a piece of chalk between his fingers. <words>17</words>  

The space pirate ship groaned as it drifted through the void, its hull scarred by years of skirmishes and smuggling runs. <words>36</words>  

Joss had been here too long, watching over stolen goods and lost souls with a wry detachment that masked something deeper. <words>57</words>  

He exhaled, tracing a lazy spiral on the metal floor with the chalk, his mind drifting like the clouds he once tracked. <words>80</words>  

Back when he had skies instead of stars, when time felt like something he could hold instead of something that slipped away. <words>103</words>  

The outdated phone in his pocket buzzed, its dial tone cutting out as the ship’s interference swallowed the signal whole. <words>124</words>  

Joss smirked—time had a way of vanishing just like that, swallowed by the vastness of space and regret. <words>144</words>  

He had taken this job to hush the endless “what if” siren song, to drown out the past in the hum of engines. <words>167</words>  

But time didn’t work that way; it wasn’t a straight line, nor a loop—it was a tide, pulling him back when he least expected. <words>192</words>  

A soft clang echoed as the cargo bay door slid open, revealing a young deckhand, wide-eyed and jittery. <words>212</words>  

“Captain wants to know if you’ve seen the missing crate,” the kid stammered, shifting from foot to foot. <words>232</words>  

Joss sighed, tapping the chalk against his palm. “Things vanish all the time, kid. You ever watch clouds?” <words>253</words>  

The deckhand blinked. “Clouds?” <words>260</words>  

Joss nodded, his gaze distant. “They shift, break apart, reform. You think they’re gone, but they’re just somewhere else.” <words>283</words>  

The kid frowned. “So… the crate’s still here?” <words>292</words>  

Joss chuckled, a sound both warm and weary. “Maybe. Maybe it’s just not where you expect it to be.” <words>314</words>  

The deckhand hesitated, then left, muttering about useless riddles. <words>326</words>  

Joss watched him go, then turned back to his chalk spiral, now smudged by his boot. <words>344</words>  

He had spent years tracking cloud paths, believing he could predict their course, but time wasn’t so easily mapped. <words>366</words>  

It slipped through fingers, reformed in unexpected places, whispered in the static of a dying dial tone. <words>386</words>  

Joss exhaled, letting the past settle like dust in the hold, and for the first time in years, he didn’t chase it. <words>409</words>  

Instead, he let it vanish. <words>413</words>
