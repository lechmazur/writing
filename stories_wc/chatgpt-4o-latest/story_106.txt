The sullen farmer trudged through the knee-high water, his boots squelching against the tiled floor of the forgotten underwater city power station. <words>21</words>  

He had come here with a singular purpose—to walk away from a dead end, to leave behind the barren fields that had given him nothing but toil. <words>44</words>  

In his satchel, he carried a collection of used postage stamps, each one a relic of distant places he had never seen but longed to reach. <words>69</words>  

The station’s rusted machinery loomed around him, its silence pressing against his ears like the weight of history itself. <words>88</words>  

He ran his fingers over the mismatched patches on the passed-down quilt draped over his shoulders, tracing the seams where generations had stitched their stories together. <words>116</words>  

Each patch was a fragment of a life once lived, a boundary erased by time and necessity, much like the city that had drowned beneath the waves. <words>143</words>  

He had always been told that boundaries were absolute—between land and sea, past and future, what was his and what was beyond reach. <words>167</words>  

But standing here, in this place where the world had forgotten its own limits, he felt a moment of pure inspiration. <words>189</words>  

He pulled a stamp from his collection, one depicting a lighthouse, its ink faded but its purpose clear—to guide the lost. <words>213</words>  

With a sudden zest, he pressed it against the quilt, as if by doing so, he could stitch himself into something greater than his own isolation. <words>240</words>  

The act was small, almost absurd, but it was the first time in years he had done something without the weight of expectation. <words>265</words>  

He had always been objectively biased, seeing the world in stark contrasts—success or failure, movement or stagnation, belonging or exile. <words>289</words>  

But here, in this submerged ruin, he saw the truth: boundaries were meant to be crossed, not obeyed. <words>311</words>  

The power station had once lit up a city, its energy flowing through circuits that no longer existed, yet its purpose had not vanished. <words>337</words>  

It had simply changed, just as he could. <words>345</words>  

He let the quilt slip from his shoulders, watching as it floated on the water’s surface, its patches blending into a single, seamless whole. <words>373</words>  

For the first time, he did not feel like a man borrowing valor from those who had come before him. <words>397</words>  

He was not a farmer bound to dying land, nor a collector of things he would never use. <words>419</words>  

He was a man who had erased his own boundaries, and in doing so, had finally stepped beyond them. <words>441</words>
