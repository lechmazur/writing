The wheels of Elias’s bike hummed against the cobbled streets as he pedaled toward the ossuary-turned-restaurant, the coded letter burning a hole in his pocket. <words>22</words>  

He had found it buried beneath a fallen oak, its cryptic symbols whispering of a war yet to come. <words>38</words>  

Elias, a lumberjack by trade, had always been drawn to the hidden layers of things—wood grain, human nature, and now, fate itself. <words>57</words>  

His hands, calloused from years of felling trees, clenched the handlebars as he replayed the nightmares that had resurfaced since discovering the letter. <words>76</words>  

They weren’t just dreams; they were warnings, visions of fire-lit skies and fractured alliances. <words>89</words>  

He had come to the ossuary not for its famed bone-in steaks but for the whispers of old healers who dined there. <words>108</words>  

If war was coming, he needed to learn the traditions of mending wounds—both of the body and the soul. <words>126</words>  

The restaurant’s entrance loomed ahead, its walls lined with skulls, their hollow eyes seeming to recognize him. <words>143</words>  

Inside, chandeliers of femurs cast a dim glow over patrons savoring dishes prepared atop ancient sarcophagi. <words>159</words>  

Elias moved with a grace that was almost awkward, his broad frame navigating the tight space between tables. <words>176</words>  

A woman in a crimson shawl watched him from the corner, her fingers tracing the rim of a glass. <words>192</words>  

He recognized her—Mireille, a former battlefield medic turned chef, rumored to know the lost arts of healing. <words>209</words>  

Sliding into the seat across from her, he placed the letter between them. <words>221</words>  

“I need to understand,” he said, his voice rough but earnest. <words>233</words>  

Mireille unfolded the parchment, her eyes scanning the symbols with a knowing sadness. <words>247</words>  

“This isn’t just a warning,” she murmured. “It’s a blueprint for survival.” <words>261</words>  

Elias exhaled sharply, his nightmares aligning with her words. <words>273</words>  

“Then teach me,” he said. “I want to revamp the way I live—turn destruction into restoration.” <words>291</words>  

Mireille studied him, then nodded. <words>298</words>  

“Meet me at dawn,” she said. “We start with the old ways.” <words>312</words>  

As Elias rode home, the city’s lights flickering like distant stars, he felt the weight of hidden agendas pressing against his ribs. <words>332</words>  

The war wasn’t just coming—it had already begun, woven into the fabric of their lives. <words>349</words>  

But for the first time, he wasn’t just a witness to destruction. <words>362</words>  

He was learning to heal. <words>369</words>
