Father Elias had once believed in divine order, but now he wandered the labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds, his faith as fractured as the abacus with missing beads he clutched in his trembling hands. <words>30</words>  

The hush of fate unraveling whispered through the towering stalks, a dull radiance filtering through their tangled canopy, casting shifting shadows that seemed to mock his every step. <words>61</words>  

He had been complacent once, trusting that destiny would guide him, but now he saw the cost of his inaction—his parish lost, his purpose eroded, his soul adrift. <words>94</words>  

Unapologetically confused, he jogged through the twisting paths, his breath ragged, his mind grasping for meaning in the endless green corridors. <words>118</words>  

The abacus had once belonged to a boy from his congregation, a child who had asked him if numbers could measure the weight of a soul. <words>149</words>  

Elias had laughed then, dismissing the question with a pat on the boy’s head, never realizing that his indifference would one day haunt him. <words>180</words>  

Now, as he followed the snow patterns that dusted the ground in strange, deliberate swirls, he wondered if fate had always been a puzzle he had refused to solve. <words>216</words>  

The orchard stretched endlessly, the stalks swaying with an unseen breath, their leaves whispering secrets he could almost understand. <words>243</words>  

He had thought himself safe in his faith, but safety had been an illusion, a price paid in stagnation, in the slow erosion of conviction. <words>275</words>  

The snow patterns led him deeper, their curves and breaks forming a language he could not read but instinctively obeyed. <words>303</words>  

He had spent years waiting for answers, for divine intervention, but now he realized that waiting had been his greatest sin. <words>331</words>  

The abacus rattled in his grip, its missing beads a reminder of all the moments he had let slip away, all the lives he had failed to touch. <words>366</words>  

He jogged faster, his feet pounding against the frozen earth, his breath forming ghosts in the cold air. <words>392</words>  

The orchard pulsed around him, the stalks bending as if acknowledging his movement, his choice to step beyond fate’s design. <words>419</words>  

For the first time in years, he felt something stir within him—not faith, not certainty, but the raw, aching possibility of change. <words>451</words>  

The snow patterns led him to a clearing where the sky opened wide, and as he stepped forward, the abacus slipped from his fingers, vanishing into the frost. <words>487</words>  

Elias did not look back. <words>491</words>
