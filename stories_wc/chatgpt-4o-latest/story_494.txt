The calligraphy master's courtyard was silent, save for the wind teasing the bamboo leaves. <words>14</words>  

Jin, an arrogant swordsman, stood with his arms crossed, his confidence worn like ill-fitted armor. <words>28</words>  

He had come seeking wisdom, though he would never admit it. <words>36</words>  

In his hand, he clutched a faded tapestry fragment, its edges frayed by time. <words>48</words>  

It was all that remained of his family's legacy, a symbol of what had been lost. <words>61</words>  

The calligraphy master, an old man with ink-stained fingers, studied Jin with knowing eyes. <words>74</words>  

"You carry doubt beneath your pride," the master said, his voice like a brushstroke on parchment. <words>88</words>  

Jin scoffed, though the words struck deeper than he wished to acknowledge. <words>99</words>  

"I need no lessons in doubt," he replied, his grip tightening on the fabric. <words>111</words>  

The master gestured to a scroll hanging in the courtyard, its characters bold yet fluid. <words>124</words>  

"True strength is not in the blade, but in the hand that wields it," he said. <words>137</words>  

Jin exhaled sharply, his frustration mounting. <words>143</words>  

"I did not come for riddles," he snapped. <words>149</words>  

The master merely smiled, then motioned for Jin to sit. <words>157</words>  

Reluctantly, he obeyed, though impatience burned within him. <words>165</words>  

"You seek to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out," the master murmured. <words>178</words>  

Jin's jaw tightened. <words>181</words>  

His family had fallen, their name reduced to whispers and forgotten debts. <words>192</words>  

He had sworn to restore their honor, yet every step forward felt like a chain around his ankles. <words>206</words>  

The master dipped his brush into ink, then paused. <words>214</words>  

"Sing," he commanded. <words>217</words>  

Jin blinked. <words>220</words>  

"Sing what?" he asked, his voice edged with irritation. <words>229</words>  

"The traditional song sung at every family wedding," the master said. <words>238</words>  

Jin hesitated. <words>241</words>  

He had not sung it since childhood, since before his family had crumbled. <words>252</words>  

His voice, doubtfully confident, wavered as he began. <words>261</words>  

The melody was rough, the words unfamiliar on his tongue. <words>270</words>  

Yet with each note, something within him loosened. <words>279</words>  

The master painted as Jin sang, his strokes swift and deliberate. <words>289</words>  

When the song ended, the master turned the scroll toward him. <words>299</words>  

The characters formed a single word: "Authorize." <words>306</words>  

Jin frowned. <words>309</words>  

"What does this mean?" he asked. <words>315</words>  

The master set down his brush. <words>321</words>  

"You have shackled your own potential," he said. <words>329</words>  

"You wait for permission to reclaim what is already yours." <words>338</words>  

Jin stared at the word, his heart pounding between breaths. <words>347</words>  

The tapestry fragment in his hand felt lighter, as if the weight of his past had shifted. <words>360</words>  

For the first time, he saw the truth. <words>367</words>  

His family's honor was not something to be restoredâ€”it was something to be lived. <words>380</words>  

He stood, bowing deeply to the master. <words>387</words>  

"Thank you," he said, his voice steady. <words>395</words>  

The master nodded, his expression one of harsh tenderness. <words>404</words>  

Jin turned, stepping beyond the courtyard, his path no longer clouded by doubt. <words>415</words>
