The hush of a simmering future pressed against the walls of the secret agent headquarters, where Advisor Lorne paced, his footsteps echoing through the abandoned corridors. <words>22</words>  

He had been left behind, a relic of uncertain wisdom, his counsel sought only when ambiguity was required. <words>38</words>  

Tonight, he chased a rumor beyond all reason, a whisper of something impossible—something that could redefine everything. <words>53</words>  

His fingers trembled as he reached the lab, where a single jar sat beneath flickering fluorescent light. <words>67</words>  

Inside, suspended in viscous fluid, a brain pulsed faintly, its label reading: "Duplicate." <words>78</words>  

Lorne swallowed hard, his reflection distorted in the glass, his own thoughts unraveling. <words>89</words>  

Was this the original, or was he? <words>95</words>  

The dreamer's calling had always been his burden, the need to know, to understand, to chase the intangible. <words>111</words>  

He had advised kings and killers, but never himself. <words>120</words>  

A sound—footsteps, distant yet near—sent a shiver through him. <words>131</words>  

He turned sharply, his breath shallow, his mind a storm of doubt. <words>143</words>  

The echo of movement in an abandoned place carried a weight heavier than presence. <words>156</words>  

Someone else was here. <words>160</words>  

A shadow flickered at the doorway, and then a voice, clearly ambiguous, whispered, "You shouldn't have come." <words>177</words>  

Lorne clenched his fists, his insecurity gnawing at him. <words>188</words>  

"Who am I?" he demanded, his voice barely steady. <words>198</words>  

The figure stepped forward, revealing a face eerily familiar—his own. <words>210</words>  

"You are the duplicate," the other Lorne said, his expression unreadable. <words>222</words>  

Lorne's stomach twisted. <words>226</words>  

"No," he whispered, shaking his head. <words>234</words>  

The other Lorne jabbed a finger toward the jar. <words>243</words>  

"That is the original," he said. <words>250</words>  

Lorne's breath hitched. <words>254</words>  

His entire existence, his memories, his fears—were they merely echoes of another's? <words>268</words>  

The dreamer's calling had led him here, but now, the dream was breaking. <words>281</words>  

"Why tell me?" he asked, his voice hoarse. <words>291</words>  

The other Lorne hesitated. <words>295</words>  

"Because I need you to make a choice." <words>304</words>  

Lorne's gaze flickered to the jar, then back. <words>314</words>  

"Destroy it," the other Lorne said. <words>321</words>  

Lorne's hands shook. <words>325</words>  

If he did, would he become real? <words>333</words>  

Or would he erase the only truth that mattered? <words>344</words>  

The fractured idyll of his life splintered further. <words>353</words>  

He reached for the jar, his fingers hovering over the glass. <words>365</words>  

The footsteps echoed again, closer this time. <words>374</words>  

More were coming. <words>378</words>  

Lorne made his choice. <words>383</words>  

With a final breath, he shattered the jar. <words>393</words>  

Fluid spilled, the brain sinking into lifeless silence. <words>403</words>  

The other Lorne exhaled, his form flickering—then vanishing. <words>414</words>  

Lorne stood alone, the echo of footsteps fading. <words>424</words>  

He was real now. <words>428</words>  

Or at least, he had to believe he was. <words>437</words>
