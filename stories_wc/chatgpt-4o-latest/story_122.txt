The cyber-templar knelt at the sky burial site, his metal fingers tracing the worn leather bridle in his lap. <words>16</words>  

The relic smelled of dust and old storms, a tether to a past that no longer existed. <words>30</words>  

Above him, the storm churned, its electric veins writhing through the heavens like a living thing. <words>42</words>  

He had come here to prove that safety was a mirage, a lie told to those too afraid to face the storm. <words>58</words>  

The bridle had once controlled a beast that no longer roamed these lands, just as he had once believed in control. <words>74</words>  

Now, he sought to reflect lightning back at the storm, to bend its fury through the refraction of light through a prism. <words>90</words>  

His mind was a battlefield of patient frenzy, a paradox of stillness and urgency. <words>101</words>  

The prism, a shard of ancient glass, lay beside him, humming with the energy of the storm’s approach. <words>115</words>  

He had read of this moment in the codices of the old order, the words etched into his memory like circuitry. <words>131</words>  

The act must be performed during reading, the knowledge shaping the action as the action reshaped the knowledge. <words>145</words>  

Lightning forked across the sky, illuminating the bones scattered across the burial site. <words>157</words>  

The dead had been left here to be taken by the wind and the carrion birds, their remains a testament to impermanence. <words>173</words>  

He understood now—safety was an illusion, but so was fear. <words>183</words>  

The storm roared, and he lifted the prism, aligning it with the heavens. <words>194</words>  

The bridle, wrapped around his wrist, tightened as if the past itself resisted his defiance. <words>207</words>  

He exhaled, his breath merging with the charged air, his body a conduit between earth and sky. <words>221</words>  

The first bolt struck, refracted through the prism, splitting into a thousand shimmering veins of light. <words>235</words>  

The storm recoiled, its own fury turned against it, the sky fracturing into a kaleidoscope of brilliance. <words>249</words>  

Euphoric agitation surged through him—he had done it, he had proven the lie of safety and the truth of defiance. <words>265</words>  

The storm howled, but he did not flinch, his body vibrating with the energy of the reflected lightning. <words>279</words>  

The bridle smoldered, its leather curling, the past burning away in the fire of the present. <words>292</words>  

He laughed, the sound lost in the wind, his voice merging with the storm’s dying echoes. <words>305</words>  

The sky burial site stood silent once more, the bones untouched, the storm retreating beyond the horizon. <words>319</words>  

He lowered the prism, its surface darkened, the refraction complete, the proof undeniable. <words>331</words>  

The cyber-templar turned, stepping away from the burial ground, his path no longer bound by the mirage of safety. <words>347</words>  

The storm would return, as all storms did, but he would be ready. <words>357</words>  

He had seen the truth refracted through light, and he would never be blind again. <words>370</words>
