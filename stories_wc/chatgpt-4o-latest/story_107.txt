The old typewriter’s keys finally went silent, and with them, the last echoes of his former life. <words>19</words>  

Once, Leonard Graves had commanded the stage, his voice a beacon for eager contestants. <words>30</words>  

Now, he sat on a sun-bleached log, stranded on an island where the only audience was the wind. <words>45</words>  

The fortune-teller’s crystal ball, the only thing he had salvaged from the wreck, rested in his lap. <words>60</words>  

Strangely, it always seemed to glow faintly at dusk, as if whispering secrets he could not decipher. <words>75</words>  

He had found it in the wreckage, nestled between shattered wood and torn fabric. <words>86</words>  

Perhaps it had belonged to another passenger, someone who had not been as lucky—or unlucky—as him. <words>102</words>  

The island was not entirely unkind, but it was indifferent, its beauty edged with quiet menace. <words>117</words>  

At night, the insect symphony hall came alive, a chorus of chirps and clicks filling the humid air. <words>133</words>  

Leonard listened, imagining them as an unseen orchestra, playing for an audience of ghosts. <words>146</words>  

He had tried to signal for help, but each attempt had been met with failure. <words>159</words>  

Then came the illness, sudden and merciless, leaving him fevered and weak beneath the swaying palms. <words>175</words>  

Delirium blurred the edges of reality, and in his haze, he saw a figure emerge from the jungle. <words>191</words>  

The stranger was gaunt, his skin weathered by the sun, his eyes sharp with knowing. <words>205</words>  

“You’ve been sabotaging yourself,” the man said, pressing a cool leaf to Leonard’s burning forehead. <words>220</words>  

Leonard tried to protest, but his voice was a rasp, his body too weak to argue. <words>234</words>  

The stranger nursed him back to health with roots and whispered wisdom. <words>245</words>  

He spoke of sacred knowledge hidden on the island, knowledge that must be rescued before time erased it. <words>262</words>  

Leonard, once a man of flashing lights and empty applause, found himself listening with unexpected reverence. <words>278</words>  

The crystal ball, the stranger claimed, was a key, a guide to what lay beneath the earth. <words>293</words>  

With renewed strength, Leonard followed him through tangled vines and shifting sands. <words>306</words>  

They unearthed a chamber, its walls etched with symbols older than memory. <words>318</words>  

The knowledge was not written in books but in the bones of the island itself. <words>331</words>  

Leonard traced the carvings, feeling the weight of something greater than himself. <words>344</words>  

A gentle overturn of his past, a shift from spectacle to substance, had begun. <words>357</words>  

The bitterness of his exile remained, but now it was laced with honeyed purpose. <words>371</words>  

He had been stranded, yes, but perhaps he had also been chosen. <words>383</words>  

The insect symphony swelled, and for the first time, Leonard truly listened. <words>395</words>
