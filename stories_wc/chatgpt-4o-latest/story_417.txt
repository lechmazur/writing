The Victorian parlor stood defiantly amidst the jungle, its ornate wallpaper peeling from the humidity, its chandelier swaying slightly as if whispering secrets to the vines creeping through the windows. <words>25</words>  

Jonathan sat rigidly in a high-backed chair, his fingers tracing the edge of a plain metal bottle cap, his only tether to sanity. <words>44</words>  

Across from him, Father Elias loomed, his eyes alight with the fervor of a man who had long since abandoned reason for revelation. <words>63</words>  

"You understand, don't you?" Elias whispered, his voice barely audible over the distant calls of unseen creatures. <words>78</words>  

Jonathan swallowed, his studies forgotten, the open book on his lap a mere prop in their unspoken agreement. <words>93</words>  

He had come here to learn, to find strength in vulnerability, but Elias had other lessons in mind. <words>108</words>  

The zealot leaned forward, his breath warm and fevered. "We must uproot the falsehoods that bind us, Jonathan." <words>123</words>  

Jonathan's fingers tightened around the bottle cap, its ridges biting into his palm. <words>135</words>  

Theoretically, this was playful—a game of wits, a dance of ideas—but in practice, it was something far more dangerous. <words>154</words>  

Elias reached out, his fingers brushing the book’s pages, his touch reverent. "Knowledge is a cage unless wielded with faith." <words>171</words>  

Jonathan exhaled sharply. "And what if faith is the cage?" <words>182</words>  

Elias smiled, a slow, knowing curve of his lips. "Then we must break it from within." <words>197</words>  

The jungle pressed against the parlor, the scent of damp earth and blooming decay thick in the air. <words>212</words>  

Jonathan had always believed in logic, in structure, but here, in this room, reason felt like a brittle thing. <words>229</words>  

Elias gestured to the bottle cap. "That—what does it mean to you?" <words>242</words>  

Jonathan hesitated. "It's nothing. Just a cap." <words>252</words>  

Elias chuckled, shaking his head. "No. It is proof." <words>263</words>  

Jonathan frowned. "Proof of what?" <words>271</words>  

Elias leaned in, his voice a whispered confession in the darkened room. "That even the smallest things hold power when given meaning." <words>292</words>  

Jonathan's pulse quickened. "And if I refuse to give it meaning?" <words>305</words>  

Elias sighed, almost disappointed. "Then you remain blind." <words>316</words>  

The jungle rustled, unseen things shifting just beyond the parlor walls. <words>328</words>  

Jonathan looked down at the cap, its dull metal gleaming faintly in the candlelight. <words>343</words>  

Perhaps Elias was mad, but madness had a way of making sense in the right light. <words>360</words>  

He turned the cap over in his fingers, considering. <words>369</words>  

Elias watched, waiting, his patience infinite. <words>380</words>  

Jonathan exhaled. "Then tell me what you see." <words>392</words>  

Elias grinned. "I see the beginning of understanding." <words>404</words>  

The candle flickered, the jungle breathed, and Jonathan, for the first time, felt the weight of something greater than knowledge. <words>423</words>
