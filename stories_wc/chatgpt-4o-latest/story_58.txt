The moth observation tower stood on the city’s edge, its silhouette barely visible against the flickering skyline. <words>14</words>  

Inside, Elias adjusted his scout’s sash, fingers brushing the engraved bullet journal cover tucked into his belt. <words>29</words>  

The words on it—"Balance the Storm"—were a mantra he barely understood but desperately needed. <words>41</words>  

He had come here to learn meditation techniques, to quiet the chaos inside him. <words>53</words>  

The city’s blackout had left the streets in uneasy darkness, but the tower’s lanterns still burned. <words>66</words>  

Elias’s mentor, an old comedian named Rook, sat cross-legged on the wooden floor. <words>78</words>  

Rook’s routines were nonsense, full of absurdities that made people laugh—until they listened closer. <words>91</words>  

Hidden in the jokes were codes, messages meant to radicalize those who could decipher them. <words>104</words>  

Elias had been one of them, drawn in by humor but staying for something deeper. <words>117</words>  

Now, he sought balance, not just in the city’s unrest but within himself. <words>129</words>  

Rook exhaled, watching the moths flutter against the lantern glass. <words>138</words>  

“You’re too common, Elias,” he said, voice low. <words>146</words>  

Elias frowned. “Common?” <words>149</words>  

“Individually common,” Rook clarified. “Like a single moth in a swarm.” <words>161</words>  

Elias clenched his fists. “I’m loyal. I’ve followed every step.” <words>172</words>  

“Loyalty without balance is just another storm,” Rook murmured. <words>182</words>  

Elias opened his bullet journal, tracing the engraved words again. <words>192</words>  

Balance the Storm. <words>195</words>  

He had thought it meant control—over the city, over others. <words>206</words>  

But maybe it meant something else. <words>211</words>  

Rook chuckled, launching into another routine. <words>218</words>  

A joke about a man who built a tower to escape the wind, only to find it swayed more the higher he climbed. <words>236</words>  

The audience had always laughed, but Elias now heard the warning. <words>247</words>  

He had climbed too high, too fast, without grounding himself. <words>258</words>  

The city’s lights flickered again, casting long shadows across the wooden floor. <words>270</words>  

Elias closed his journal. <words>274</words>  

“I need to learn,” he admitted. <words>280</words>  

Rook nodded. “Then sit. Breathe. Watch the moths.” <words>291</words>  

Elias obeyed, watching the delicate wings beat against the glass. <words>303</words>  

Inside him, the storm raged—but for the first time, he didn’t fight it. <words>316</words>  

He let it move, let it settle, let it be. <words>326</words>  

Outside, the city’s lights flickered once more, then held steady. <words>338</words>
