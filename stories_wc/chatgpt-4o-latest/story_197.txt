The hush settled over the world like a held breath, the moment after a child’s last bedtime story, when the air itself seemed to listen. <words>22</words>  
Perched on a gnarled branch of the Yggdrasil-like tree, Lior sifted through a set of sticky notes, their order scrambled anew each night. <words>44</words>  
Each note contained fragments of a cosmic lullaby, a melody meant to soothe the restless dreams of the universe itself. <words>61</words>  
But the notes never stayed in place, shifting like whispers in the dark, demanding to be unscrambled before the nightmares collided. <words>83</words>  
Lior was a high-altitude con artist, a thief of celestial harmonies, weaving stolen dreams into lullabies that kept the chaos at bay. <words>106</words>  
His fingers, calloused from years of deception, traced the edges of a fabric scrap tied around his wrist—a relic of a forgotten promise. <words>132</words>  
The fabric had once belonged to someone who had believed in him, someone who had seen past the mundane terror of his existence. <words>157</words>  
Now, it was his tether, his reminder that even in pristine chaos, there was something worth holding onto. <words>176</words>  
The tree groaned beneath him, its roots stretching beyond sight, threading through the fabric of reality itself. <words>196</words>  
Lior worked quickly, rearranging the sticky notes, each movement further unraveling the tangled melody buried within. <words>217</words>  
The nightmares were close—he could feel them pressing against the edges of the world, waiting for the lullaby to fail. <words>240</words>  
They were mundanely terrifying, not grotesque or monstrous, but familiar—forgotten faces, lost chances, the weight of unspoken words. <words>263</words>  
If he failed, they would merge, forming something beyond fear, something that could not be undone. <words>283</words>  
His hands trembled as he placed the final note, the melody clicking into place like a lock turning. <words>304</words>  
The lullaby rose from the tree, a soundless hum that wove through the branches, soothing the fractures in the night. <words>327</words>  
The nightmares recoiled, their collision averted, their forms dissolving into the hush once more. <words>346</words>  
Lior exhaled, his grip tightening on the fabric scrap, knowing that tomorrow, the notes would be scrambled again. <words>368</words>  
He would climb the tree once more, unscrambling the melody, holding the nightmares at bay for one more night. <words>389</words>  
Because in the pristine chaos of the universe, someone had to compose the lullaby that kept the dark from swallowing the light. <words>414</words>  
And as long as he had the fabric scrap, he would remember why he did it. <words>432</words>  
The hush deepened, the lullaby settling into the bones of the world, and Lior closed his eyes, waiting for the next night to come. <words>464</words>
