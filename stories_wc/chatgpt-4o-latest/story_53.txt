The wind howled through the valley as Elias stepped into the fortress, his boots scraping against the ancient stone. <words>14</words>  

Today was moving day, and he had taken a different route home, drawn by an inexplicable pull. <words>28</words>  

The fortress stood defiant against the elements, its walls whispering secrets of forgotten ages. <words>39</words>  

Elias had always been a protector, but his rash nature often led him into trouble. <words>51</words>  

He sought solace in the vastness of the cosmos, believing that understanding the infinite would quiet his restless soul. <words>66</words>  

Inside, dust swirled in the dim light, and his fingers traced the rough stone as he wandered. <words>79</words>  

A gust of wind slammed a door shut behind him, sealing him in with the echoes of the past. <words>93</words>  

His heart pounded, but he forced himself to move forward, drawn by something unseen. <words>105</words>  

In a forgotten chamber, he found a wooden box resting atop a crumbling table. <words>117</words>  

Lifting the lid, he discovered a collection of old postcards, their edges curled with time. <words>130</words>  

Each bore an image of distant stars, celestial bodies painted in hues beyond earthly comprehension. <words>143</words>  

The messages on the back were written in a language he did not recognize, yet they felt familiar. <words>157</words>  

A quiet hum filled the air, resonating deep within his bones. <words>167</words>  

He realized, with a dawning awareness, that these were not mere postcards but echoes of a universal truth. <words>182</words>  

Each card was a fragment of something infinitely vast, a whisper from the cosmos itself. <words>195</words>  

His breath caught as he turned one over, the ink shifting before his eyes. <words>207</words>  

The words rearranged themselves into something he could understand: "You are not alone." <words>219</words>  

A shiver ran down his spine, but he did not feel fear—only a profound sense of belonging. <words>233</words>  

The fortress, the valley, the howling wind—all of it had led him here for a reason. <words>246</words>  

He had spent his life protecting others, but now he understood that the universe had been protecting him. <words>261</words>  

The realization was universally unique, a truth meant only for him yet connected to everything. <words>274</words>  

He sat in the quiet, letting the weight of it settle into his soul. <words>285</words>  

For the first time, he did not feel the need to act, to rush, to shield. <words>298</words>  

Instead, he simply existed, a part of the vast, infinite whole. <words>308</words>  

The wind outside softened, as if the fortress itself acknowledged his understanding. <words>320</words>  

Elias gathered the postcards, knowing he would carry their message with him forever. <words>332</words>  

As he stepped back into the valley, the stars above seemed closer than ever before. <words>345</words>  

He had found what he had been searching for—not in the cosmos, but within himself. <words>358</words>  

And as he walked home, he took his time, no longer in a hurry to outrun the universe. <words>372</words>
