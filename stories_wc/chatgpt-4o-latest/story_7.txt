The nectar collection facility hummed with the low murmur of unseen wings, its golden reservoirs pulsing with liquid light. <words>19</words>  

Among the vats, a sentient doll collector named Veylin moved with expectant resignation, his porcelain fingers tracing the edges of his latest acquisition. <words>40</words>  

The doll’s glass eyes reflected the facility’s glow, its tiny lips parted as if whispering secrets only Veylin could hear. <words>57</words>  

He had spent lifetimes gathering them, each one a vessel of forgotten voices, each one a fragment of something lost. <words>74</words>  

Yet, his true purpose lay beyond mere collection—he sought to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. <words>89</words>  

In his other hand, he gripped a twisted carnival cane, its spiraled wood darkened by time and use. <words>105</words>  

It had once belonged to a ringmaster who spoke in riddles, a man who claimed the cane could uphold the weight of unseen worlds. <words>126</words>  

Veylin had tested this claim, tracing star paths with its tip, watching as the air shimmered and bent beneath its touch. <words>145</words>  

Tonight, before the first prayer was whispered by a mortal, he would follow those paths again. <words>159</words>  

The nectar vats pulsed in rhythm, their glow intensifying as if sensing his intent. <words>172</words>  

He stepped forward, the cane tapping against the floor, each strike sending ripples through the air. <words>188</words>  

The dolls in his satchel stirred, their tiny limbs twitching, their silent chorus swelling into something almost audible. <words>205</words>  

This was the chorus of healing, the voices of those who had been broken and remade. <words>219</words>  

They sang not in words, but in the resonance of memory, in the echoes of what had been lost and found again. <words>238</words>  

Veylin closed his eyes, letting their song guide him, letting the cane carve a path through the unseen. <words>254</words>  

The air split open, revealing a corridor of starlight, a bridge between what was and what could be. <words>270</words>  

He stepped through, the nectar’s glow clinging to his form, the dolls pressing close as if afraid of what lay ahead. <words>289</words>  

Beyond the threshold, the world was neither past nor future, but something in between—a place where boundaries dissolved. <words>306</words>  

Here, the twisted carnival cane was no longer wood but something fluid, something alive. <words>320</words>  

The dolls uncurled from their stillness, their porcelain skin warming, their glass eyes blinking with newfound awareness. <words>337</words>  

Veylin felt the weight of their gazes, the silent plea within them. <words>349</words>  

He had upheld their existence, but now they sought more—they sought to walk, to breathe, to be. <words>366</words>  

The chorus of healing swelled, no longer a whisper but a force, reshaping the space around them. <words>381</words>  

Veylin raised the cane, tracing one final star path, his own form flickering as the boundary shattered. <words>397</words>  

The nectar collection facility stood empty, its golden reservoirs still pulsing, but Veylin and his dolls had stepped beyond. <words>415</words>  

Somewhere, in a world without edges, they took their first breath together. <words>428</words>
