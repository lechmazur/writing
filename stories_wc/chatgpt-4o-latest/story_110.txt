The water clock repair shop smelled of damp brass and regret. <words>10</words>  

Elias, a hidden assassin by trade, sat among the ticking mechanisms, waiting. <words>20</words>  

His latest target, a quietly flamboyant horologist named Victor, adored his work. <words>30</words>  

Victor’s shop was cluttered with timepieces, each whispering secrets of lost hours. <words>40</words>  

A moss-covered lantern flickered in the corner, casting eerie shadows on the walls. <words>50</words>  

Elias had been hired to kill Victor, but something about him unsettled him. <words>60</words>  

Victor spoke in bleak eulogies that mentioned hidden truths, as if expecting death. <words>70</words>  

“You know,” Victor mused, adjusting a delicate gear, “time is a domestic mystery.” <words>80</words>  

Elias raised an eyebrow, his fingers tracing the hilt of his concealed dagger. <words>90</words>  

Victor chuckled, his flamboyance subdued but undeniable. <words>96</words>  

“People think time is linear, but it’s more like a leaking pipe.” <words>106</words>  

Elias smirked, despite himself. <words>109</words>  

He had killed men for less philosophical rambling. <words>114</words>  

Victor gestured toward the moss-covered lantern. <words>119</words>  

“That belonged to my father,” he said. <words>124</words>  

“He believed pain could be transmuted into a masterpiece.” <words>130</words>  

Elias stiffened. <words>132</words>  

The words struck something deep, something he had buried long ago. <words>142</words>  

Victor continued, adjusting the water clock’s delicate balance. <words>148</words>  

“Every broken thing can be repaired, given enough patience.” <words>154</words>  

Elias exhaled slowly, his grip on the dagger loosening. <words>161</words>  

Victor turned, his eyes gleaming with quiet understanding. <words>167</words>  

“You were sent to kill me, weren’t you?” <words>173</words>  

Elias didn’t answer. <words>176</words>  

Victor smiled, as if amused by his own impending demise. <words>184</words>  

“I suppose I should be honored.” <words>189</words>  

Elias hesitated, the weight of his profession pressing against his ribs. <words>198</words>  

Victor tapped the water clock, watching the liquid shift. <words>205</words>  

“Time is strange,” he murmured. <words>209</words>  

Elias sighed, slipping the dagger back into his coat. <words>216</words>  

Victor’s laughter was soft, almost melancholic. <words>222</words>  

“You’re not going to kill me, are you?” <words>228</words>  

Elias shook his head. <words>231</words>  

Victor nodded, as if he had expected this outcome all along. <words>240</words>  

“Then stay,” he said. <words>244</words>  

“Help me fix what’s broken.” <words>249</words>  

Elias glanced at the moss-covered lantern, its glow steady. <words>257</words>  

Perhaps, for once, he would. <words>261</words>
