The orchard island drifted in the maelstrom’s grip, its trees bending but never breaking. <words>13</words>  

Under the waxing moon’s glow, the midwife knelt beside a smoldering fireplace, sifting through half-burned diaries. <words>28</words>  

She was openly secretive, speaking in riddles yet never lying, her wisdom growing with each recovered page. <words>41</words>  

The wind howled through the gnarled branches, carrying whispers of stolen memories she sought to reclaim. <words>53</words>  

She pressed herbs between her fingers, inhaling their scent, grounding herself in the present. <words>64</words>  

The diaries, charred and fragile, held fragments of a past someone had tried to erase. <words>76</words>  

She traced the ink with calloused fingers, deciphering words that flickered like dying embers. <words>88</words>  

Each passage revealed glimpses of a life she should have remembered but didn’t. <words>99</words>  

A child’s birth, a betrayal, a promise whispered beneath the orchard’s boughs. <words>110</words>  

The midwife’s breath hitched—these were her memories, stolen and scattered like ash. <words>122</words>  

She had delivered countless lives, yet her own had been taken from her. <words>134</words>  

The maelstrom churned beyond the island’s edge, a mirror of the turmoil within her. <words>147</words>  

She pressed the herbs into a poultice, an old remedy for clarity of mind. <words>159</words>  

The scent of crushed leaves mingled with the smoke, unlocking something deep inside. <words>171</words>  

She saw herself standing in this very orchard, speaking to a hooded figure. <words>183</words>  

Their voice was familiar, yet distant, like an echo from another life. <words>195</words>  

“You must forget,” they had said, pressing a vial into her palm. <words>207</words>  

She had obeyed, drinking willingly, believing it was for the greater good. <words>219</words>  

Now, she understood—her wisdom had been growing, but at a terrible cost. <words>231</words>  

She had been made to forget something vital, something dangerous. <words>242</words>  

The midwife stood, the diaries clutched to her chest, her resolve hardening. <words>254</words>  

She would transcend this forced ignorance, reclaim what was hers. <words>265</words>  

The orchard trembled as if sensing her awakening, petals drifting like snow. <words>277</words>  

She walked to the island’s edge, the maelstrom roaring beneath her feet. <words>289</words>  

The wind tore at her cloak, but she did not waver. <words>300</words>  

She whispered the names she had read, calling them back to her. <words>312</words>  

The air shimmered, the maelstrom’s fury bending to her will. <words>323</words>  

A figure emerged from the storm, their face obscured by shadow. <words>335</words>  

“You were never meant to remember,” they said, voice laced with regret. <words>347</words>  

“But I do,” she answered, pressing the herbs to her lips. <words>358</words>  

The memories surged, filling the void that had hollowed her for years. <words>370</words>  

She saw the truth—the betrayal, the sacrifice, the reason she had forgotten. <words>382</words>  

Tears burned her cheeks, but she did not falter. <words>391</words>  

The island steadied, the maelstrom receding, the orchard blooming anew. <words>403</words>  

She had recovered what was stolen, and with it, she had grown. <words>415</words>  

The midwife turned from the storm, stepping into the orchard’s embrace. <words>427</words>  

Her wisdom was no longer hidden, no longer stolen—it was hers again. <words>439</words>  

And with it, she would shape the world anew. <words>447</words>
