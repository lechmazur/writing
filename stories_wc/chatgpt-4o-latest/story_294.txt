The hush of a dreamless night settled over the giant mushroom meeting hall, its spongy walls absorbing even the faintest whisper. <words>19</words>  

At the center of the chamber, a dry-tongued bard named Lior sat cross-legged, his fingers tracing the edges of a stained glass prism. <words>38</words>  

The prism refracted the dim glow of bioluminescent spores, casting fractured rainbows across his gorgeously awkward frame. <words>53</words>  

He had come here to escape the prison of the self, to shed the cloak of doubt that clung to him like damp wool. <words>72</words>  

His voice, once a river of sonnets, had withered into a cracked whisper, parched by years of uncertainty. <words>87</words>  

He had tried to preserve his essence through forgotten voicemails, messages left for no one, echoes of a man he barely recognized. <words>106</words>  

Now, in this fungal cathedral, he sought a different kind of preservation—one that did not rely on memory alone. <words>122</words>  

He lifted the prism to his lips, as if it might distill his voice into something pure, something untainted by hesitation. <words>141</words>  

The colors trembled across his face, illuminating the lines of doubt etched into his brow. <words>154</words>  

A voice, not his own, drifted through the chamber, soft as the spores that floated in the air. <words>170</words>  

"You cannot preserve what you refuse to release," it murmured, weaving through the silence like a forgotten melody. <words>187</words>  

Lior turned sharply, his breath catching in his throat. <words>194</words>  

A figure stood at the edge of the hall, wrapped in a cloak that shimmered like liquid shadow. <words>209</words>  

The stranger’s presence was both weightless and immense, as if they were carved from the very fabric of hesitation itself. <words>226</words>  

"Who are you?" Lior rasped, his voice brittle. <words>233</words>  

The figure stepped forward, their movements gorgeously awkward, as if they were learning how to exist in this space. <words>249</words>  

"I am the doubt you have carried," they said, their voice layered with echoes of Lior’s own. <words>263</words>  

Lior clenched the prism tighter, its edges biting into his palm. <words>273</words>  

"If I let you go, what will remain?" he asked, his words barely more than breath. <words>287</words>  

The figure tilted their head, considering. <words>292</words>  

"Only what was always there," they replied. <words>299</words>  

Lior hesitated, then slowly, deliberately, set the prism down. <words>309</words>  

The colors it cast flickered, then faded, as if surrendering to the night. <words>322</words>  

The figure smiled—a quiet, knowing thing—before dissolving into the air like mist. <words>336</words>  

Lior exhaled, his throat no longer dry, his voice no longer a stranger to him. <words>350</words>  

He stood, stepping beyond the prism’s fractured light, and walked into the waiting dark. <words>364</words>
