The salt crystal growing chamber hummed softly, its air thick with brine and the rhythmic churn of laundry cycles from the adjacent room. <words>19</words>  

Eldrin, an understudy sorcerer, adjusted his robes and clutched a small cardboard box to his chest. <words>34</words>  

His master had tasked him with an unusual experiment—waking the unheard by eavesdropping on the whispers of an ancient oak grove. <words>50</words>  

The problem? The only grove nearby had been reduced to a single, gnarled stump, locked away in this chamber for preservation. <words>66</words>  

Eldrin cleared his throat and bowed deeply to the stump. <words>74</words>  

"Dearest and most venerable remnant of wisdom, might I trouble you for a moment of your esteemed time?" he asked, his voice dripping with exaggerated courtesy. <words>96</words>  

The stump remained silent, but Eldrin knew better than to take that as refusal. <words>108</words>  

He placed the small cardboard box beside it, its contents rattling ominously. <words>120</words>  

Inside were salt crystals infused with echoes of forgotten voices, meant to amplify the whispers of the past. <words>135</words>  

With a flourish, Eldrin sprinkled the crystals around the stump, then pressed his ear to its rough bark. <words>150</words>  

A chorus of murmurs slithered into his mind, fragmented and restless. <words>161</words>  

"Time bends… the cycle repeats… hinder the tide…" the voices sighed. <words>173</words>  

Eldrin frowned. <words>175</words>  

His master had warned him that the unheard often spoke in riddles, but this felt urgent. <words>190</words>  

"What tide?" he asked, his tone still obnoxiously polite. <words>200</words>  

The whispers coiled tighter. <words>204</words>  

"The tide of forgetting… the erosion of stories… hinder the silence…" <words>216</words>  

Eldrin’s fingers twitched. <words>220</words>  

He had come to track cultural evolution, to understand how knowledge faded and transformed. <words>233</words>  

But now, the voices begged him to act. <words>242</words>  

The laundry cycles in the next room shifted, the rhythmic sloshing of water echoing like a heartbeat. <words>258</words>  

Eldrin’s mind raced. <words>262</words>  

If the unheard were vanishing, then history itself was dissolving. <words>272</words>  

He had to hinder this decay. <words>280</words>  

With a deep breath, he reached into the cardboard box and withdrew a single, glistening crystal. <words>294</words>  

He pressed it against the stump, willing the voices to anchor themselves. <words>306</words>  

The chamber trembled. <words>309</words>  

Salt formations cracked, and the air thickened with unseen presences. <words>321</words>  

The whispers surged, no longer fragmented but whole. <words>332</words>  

"Remember us," they pleaded. <words>338</words>  

Eldrin nodded solemnly. <words>342</words>  

"I shall," he vowed, his usual politeness tempered by genuine reverence. <words>354</words>  

The voices sighed in relief, settling into the crystal like embers into ash. <words>368</words>  

The laundry cycle ended with a final, decisive click. <words>379</words>  

Eldrin exhaled, knowing that history had been preserved—at least for now. <words>392</words>
