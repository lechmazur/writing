The frozen harbor stretched endlessly, its surface a jagged mirror reflecting the glow of mechanical caravans humming with quiet life. <words>19</words>  

Among them, Elias crouched beside a rusted stall, his breath curling in the frigid air. <words>32</words>  

He was an ambitious brewer, but his true passion lay in documenting dying dialects before they vanished forever. <words>47</words>  

His latest lead had brought him here, to a place where words clung to the past like frost on iron. <words>63</words>  

A battered carnival poster flapped weakly against a caravan’s side, its ink faded, its paper bruised by time. <words>78</words>  

Elias traced the faint marks, deciphering them like a forgotten script, his fingers trembling with peculiar faith. <words>92</words>  

The bruises formed a pattern, a map of lost paths, guiding him toward something unseen. <words>105</words>  

He had learned to trust such signs, for language often hid in the scars of the world. <words>119</words>  

A gust of wind rattled the metal frames of the caravans, and Elias clenched his coat tighter. <words>133</words>  

He had withstood worse—hunger, doubt, the weight of a world that no longer cared for old tongues. <words>148</words>  

But he was fiercely loyal to his cause, unwilling to let history slip into silence. <words>161</words>  

From his pocket, he pulled a plain metal straw, its surface worn smooth by years of use. <words>176</words>  

It had belonged to his mentor, a linguist who had vanished chasing the same vanishing words. <words>190</words>  

Elias placed it between his lips, a ritual of remembrance, and turned toward the path revealed by the poster. <words>206</words>  

The ice groaned beneath his boots as he walked, the mechanical caravans watching with unblinking lights. <words>220</words>  

He followed the bruised map through the frozen harbor, past stalls selling gears and bottled echoes of laughter. <words>235</words>  

At last, he reached a caravan older than the rest, its door slightly ajar, whispering invitation. <words>248</words>  

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aged parchment and something brewing in copper vats. <words>263</words>  

A woman sat by a flickering lamp, her eyes sharp, her hands ink-stained. <words>275</words>  

“You found the path,” she murmured, her voice carrying the cadence of a dialect Elias had only read about. <words>290</words>  

His heart pounded—proof that the language still lived, hidden in the frozen corners of the world. <words>304</words>  

She gestured to a chair, and he sat, the metal straw cool against his fingers. <words>317</words>  

“You seek the lost words,” she said, pouring a steaming drink into a tarnished cup. <words>330</words>  

Elias nodded, his breath hitching as he recognized the syllables woven into her speech. <words>343</words>  

She smiled, lifting her own cup. “Then drink, and listen. The past is not yet silent.” <words>356</words>  

As the warmth spread through him, Elias knew he had found what he had been searching for. <words>370</words>  

The lost paths were not gone—they had only been waiting for someone to read their bruises. <words>384</words>  

And so, with peculiar faith, he listened, ready to document the words before they faded forever. <words>398</words>
