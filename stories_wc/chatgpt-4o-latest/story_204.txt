The abandoned spaceport hangar still smelled of rust and forgotten departures. <words>10</words>  

Mira adjusted her coat, the fabric worn but comforting, as she waited in the hush before the acceptance speech. <words>25</words>  

She had never been here before, yet the place felt oddly familiar—unusually usual, like a dream half-remembered. <words>38</words>  

Her fingers traced the phantom train ticket punch in her pocket, a relic from a journey that had never happened. <words>52</words>  

She had found it at a farmer’s market, nestled between crates of bruised apples and jars of honey. <words>65</words>  

The vendor, an old man with clouded eyes, had pressed it into her palm without a word. <words>78</words>  

Mira had almost refused, but something in his gaze told her this was not a gift—it was a test. <words>92</words>  

She had spent years as a professional cuddler, offering warmth to those who had forgotten how to ask for it. <words>106</words>  

Touch was her trade, yet she had always drawn a line between comfort and connection. <words>118</words>  

Unspoken rules governed her world, rules she had never dared to question. <words>128</words>  

But now, standing in the vast emptiness of the hangar, she felt those rules begin to decay. <words>140</words>  

The ticket punch grew heavier in her hand, as if waiting for her to understand its purpose. <words>153</words>  

A whisper of movement caught her attention—a figure emerging from the shadows. <words>164</words>  

He was tall, draped in a coat that had once been elegant but now bore the weight of time. <words>178</words>  

His eyes flickered to the object in her hand, and for a moment, something like recognition passed between them. <words>192</words>  

"You carry a relic of passage," he said, his voice edged with something ancient. <words>204</words>  

Mira hesitated. "I don’t even know what it is." <words>212</words>  

He smiled, though it did not reach his eyes. "It is proof that you belong to a journey you have yet to take." <words>226</words>  

The words unsettled her, but she did not let go of the punch. <words>237</words>  

"Why me?" she asked. <words>241</words>  

"Because you still believe in barriers," he said. "And you must learn that they are illusions." <words>254</words>  

Mira thought of the people she had held, the walls she had kept between herself and them. <words>267</words>  

She had always believed that comfort was enough, that connection was dangerous. <words>278</words>  

But what if she had been wrong? <words>283</words>  

The hangar seemed to breathe around her, the silence thick with expectation. <words>294</words>  

The acceptance speech would begin soon, but she no longer knew if she wanted to stay. <words>307</words>  

The man gestured toward the darkness beyond the hangar doors. <words>317</words>  

"Come," he said. "Let the journey begin." <words>326</words>  

Mira looked down at the phantom train ticket punch one last time. <words>336</words>  

Then, with a deep breath, she stepped forward. <words>344</words>
