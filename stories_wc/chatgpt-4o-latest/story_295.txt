The jovial sellsword strode into the witch’s herb garden, his boots crushing rosemary and thyme beneath his heels. <words>14</words>  

Moonlight bathed the tangled greenery, casting silver shadows over the ancient astronomical telescope that stood at the garden’s heart. <words>30</words>  

He had come for treasure, though not the kind that jingled in a purse. <words>40</words>  

Tonight, he sought to bury a time capsule, a family tradition meant to preserve a moment before transformation. <words>55</words>  

His fingers traced the metal of the telescope, its lenses clouded with age, its purpose long forgotten. <words>69</words>  

The witch had promised that through it, he would see the truth of his own withering vow. <words>82</words>  

He had sworn never to doubt himself, yet doubt had crept in like ivy through stone. <words>96</words>  

Boldly reluctant, he adjusted the telescope, peering through its warped glass into the heavens. <words>109</words>  

Stars swirled, constellations shifting, revealing a vision of himself—crowned, victorious, yet hollow-eyed. <words>122</words>  

The sellsword laughed, a sound both rich and bitter, for he understood the mayhem of fate. <words>136</words>  

The witch emerged from the shadows, her robes rustling like dry leaves. <words>146</words>  

“You see now,” she murmured, plucking a sprig of lavender and crushing it between her fingers. <words>160</words>  

He nodded, unsheathing his dagger and carving his name into the wooden base of the telescope. <words>174</words>  

“This will be my time capsule,” he declared, voice steady despite the storm within. <words>187</words>  

The witch smiled, her teeth glinting like pearls in the dark. <words>197</words>  

“Then you are ready,” she said, stepping aside to reveal a small chest buried in the soil. <words>212</words>  

Inside lay relics of past warriors, each having left behind a token before their own transformation. <words>226</words>  

He placed his dagger within, sealing his past self away with the others. <words>238</words>  

The wind stirred, carrying the scent of sage and prophecy. <words>248</words>  

Doubt had been dethroned from his mind, and in its place, certainty took root. <words>260</words>  

The sellsword turned from the garden, his laughter echoing through the night, elegant in its mayhem. <words>273</words>
