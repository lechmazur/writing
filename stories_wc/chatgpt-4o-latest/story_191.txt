The mist curled around the island like a living thing, shifting in slow, deliberate movements. <words>14</words>  

Jonas sat at a weathered table, his fingers tracing the rim of an abandoned mug. <words>27</words>  

The coffee inside had cooled, forgotten in the urgency of his task. <words>36</words>  

He was a cardsharp, but not the kind who relied on luck. <words>46</words>  

His skill lay in reading people, in knowing their tells before they did. <words>58</words>  

But here, on this island, his talent had taken on a stranger dimension. <words>70</words>  

He had begun to see himself in the dreams of others. <words>80</words>  

Not as a participant, but as a fleeting presence, a cameo in their subconscious. <words>94</words>  

By analyzing these glimpses, he had pieced together a puzzle he barely understood. <words>107</words>  

The island whispered secrets, and he was determined to hear them all. <words>118</words>  

A hushed plea echoed through the mist, barely audible yet impossible to ignore. <words>131</words>  

Jonas turned, his pulse quickening, though his face remained impassive. <words>142</words>  

A figure emerged, their voice boisterously quiet—loud in urgency, soft in volume. <words>156</words>  

They clutched an antique ink well, its surface etched with symbols he recognized. <words>169</words>  

He had seen those markings before, in the dreams of strangers. <words>180</words>  

The ink well trembled in the figure’s hands as they stepped closer. <words>192</words>  

"You must hasten," they whispered, their breath warm against the cold air. <words>204</words>  

Jonas studied them, his mind racing through the fragments he had gathered. <words>216</words>  

The ink well was a key, a conduit for something beyond understanding. <words>228</words>  

He had dared the unimaginable before, but this was different. <words>238</words>  

This was not a game of cards; this was a wager against fate itself. <words>251</words>  

Grudging admiration flickered in his chest—whoever had set this in motion was brilliant. <words>265</words>  

He reached for the ink well, feeling its weight, its history pressing into his palm. <words>279</words>  

The mist thickened, swirling as if aware of his decision. <words>289</words>  

The figure exhaled, relief evident in their posture. <words>298</words>  

Jonas closed his eyes, letting the island’s whispers guide him. <words>308</words>  

The ink well pulsed, and the world shifted. <words>316</words>  

He had always known how to read the unseen. <words>325</words>  

Now, he would learn how to write it. <words>333</words>
