Elias had never trusted the dead, which was an odd predicament for a spiritual medium. <words>16</words> He believed spirits were like mists—shifting, uncertain, and prone to deception. <words>27</words> Yet, he had no choice but to listen when they whispered. <words>36</words> Tonight, their murmurs led him to an iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode. <words>49</words> The walls shimmered with refracted light, casting spectral illusions that danced like forgotten memories. <words>62</words>  

In his hands, he clutched a centaur horseshoe etched with runes, its metal warm despite the cave’s chill. <words>77</words> The artifact had appeared peculiarly frequently in his visions, always accompanied by the scent of a new book. <words>92</words> He inhaled deeply, expecting the familiar aroma of ink and paper, but the air carried only damp minerals. <words>108</words>  

Elias had come here to learn forgotten crafts, to strengthen his understanding of the old ways. <words>121</words> The spirits had promised knowledge, but they had also warned of the mists of uncertainty. <words>134</words> He had scoffed at their cryptic warnings—what was life if not uncertain? <words>145</words>  

A sudden hush fell, like the eerie silence when a roller coaster stalls at its peak. <words>158</words> The cave seemed to hold its breath, waiting. <words>165</words> Elias traced the runes on the horseshoe, feeling their grooves pulse beneath his fingertips. <words>178</words>  

A voice, neither male nor female, echoed through the chamber. <words>186</words> “You seek knowledge, but do you accept its weight?” <words>195</words>  

Elias smirked, his brazen humility unshaken. <words>202</words> “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.” <words>209</words>  

The mist thickened, swirling into shapes—figures from lost civilizations, artisans of forgotten crafts. <words>222</words> They moved with purpose, their hands weaving, carving, forging. <words>231</words> Elias watched, mesmerized, as they shaped reality itself. <words>240</words>  

The scent of a new book filled the air, sudden and intoxicating. <words>250</words> His mind sharpened, as if the knowledge within those spectral pages was seeping into him. <words>264</words>  

The centaur horseshoe grew heavier, its runes glowing. <words>272</words> The spirits’ work was not just to be observed—it was to be continued. <words>285</words>  

Elias knelt, pressing the artifact to the cave floor. <words>294</words> The mist coiled around him, whispering instructions in languages he did not know but somehow understood. <words>309</words>  

He worked, his hands moving with newfound skill, strengthening the bond between past and present. <words>322</words> The cave pulsed with approval. <words>327</words>  

When the hush lifted, Elias stood, transformed. <words>334</words> The mists of uncertainty had not cleared, but he no longer feared them. <words>347</words>  

He left the cave, the scent of a new book lingering in his mind. <words>358</words> The spirits had given him knowledge, and now, it was his to wield. <words>371</words>
