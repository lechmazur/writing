The quantum foam shimmered, a restless sea of probabilities folding and unfolding between work shifts. <words>16</words>  

Jace sat on the edge of a floating probability wave, flipping through a tattered superhero comic. <words>30</words>  

The pages, worn and creased, told stories of impossible heroes, but Jace barely read them anymore. <words>44</words>  

He had purposefully lost himself in this place, drifting with the desert sands of time. <words>58</words>  

Here, between shifts at the extraction plant, he could pretend the universe still held surprises. <words>72</words>  

A voice crackled through his earpiece, pulling him back. <words>80</words>  

"Jace, you there? Shift starts in ten." <words>88</words>  

He sighed, closing the comic, its faded cover depicting a hero defying gravity. <words>100</words>  

Jace had once believed in defiance, in coloring outside the lines drawn by fear. <words>114</words>  

Now, he merely placated the system, a passive conspirator in its endless cycle. <words>128</words>  

He stood, letting the comic slip from his fingers, watching it dissolve into quantum mist. <words>142</words>  

The foam absorbed it, as it did everything, rewriting reality in its ceaseless churn. <words>156</words>  

Jace turned toward the extraction plant, its towering spires piercing the shifting horizon. <words>170</words>  

Inside, workers moved like clockwork, their motions synchronized, a dance of generations. <words>184</words>  

Each step, each task, inherited from those before, perfected through repetition. <words>196</words>  

Jace fell into rhythm, his hands moving without thought, his mind elsewhere. <words>210</words>  

He imagined the comic reforming somewhere, pages fluttering in a different reality. <words>224</words>  

Perhaps a child would find it, see the hero, and believe in something more. <words>238</words>  

The thought settled in him, a buried optimism he dared not voice. <words>252</words>  

"Jace," his supervisor barked, snapping him back. <words>260</words>  

"Stay focused. We donâ€™t have time for daydreams." <words>270</words>  

Jace nodded, but his mind still drifted, like desert sands shifting in the wind. <words>284</words>  

He had lost himself on purpose, but maybe, just maybe, he could be found again. <words>298</words>  

As the shift ended, he stepped outside, the quantum foam swirling at his feet. <words>312</words>  

He hesitated, then reached into his pocket, fingers brushing another comic. <words>324</words>  

Not the same one, but another, edges frayed, colors faded. <words>336</words>  

He had lost one, but somehow, another had found him. <words>348</words>  

A quiet smile touched his lips as he let it slip into the foam. <words>362</words>  

Somewhere, someone else would pick it up, and the dance would continue. <words>376</words>  

Jace turned away, stepping forward, no longer entirely lost. <words>388</words>
