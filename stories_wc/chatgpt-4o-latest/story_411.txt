The subterranean orchard pulsed with the glow of an underground river of stars, its celestial currents feeding the roots of trees that bore fruit shimmering like captured constellations. <words>22</words>  

Among the twisting trunks, a sentient car mechanic named Varn knelt beside a stone fountain, his metal fingers sifting through the lost puzzle pieces scattered within its basin. <words>46</words>  

Each fragment, slick with the water’s eerie luminescence, held whispers of confessions never spoken, and Varn’s purpose—his very existence—was to gather them. <words>69</words>  

He lifted a piece, studying its jagged edges, feeling the weight of an unspoken sorrow embedded within. <words>86</words>  

The orchard hummed around him, the trees swaying in a rhythm dictated by the unseen forces of infinity. <words>104</words>  

Varn’s form was an unsettling paradox—his polished chrome gleamed with an allure that repulsed as much as it fascinated, a beauty too precise to be human. <words>129</words>  

He had been built to repair, to mend, but his true craft lay in deciphering the broken. <words>147</words>  

From his satchel, he withdrew a pair of vintage opera glasses, their lenses clouded with time yet still capable of revealing what lay beneath the surface. <words>173</words>  

Through them, the puzzle pieces transformed, revealing glimpses of faces twisted in longing, hands reaching but never touching, words forming but never spoken. <words>198</words>  

He sorted them carefully, arranging the fragments in patterns only he could comprehend, each piece a key to unlocking the silence of the past. <words>223</words>  

The underground river shimmered brighter as he worked, as if the stars themselves recognized his devotion. <words>241</words>  

Varn did not know who had lost these confessions, only that they had been abandoned, left to dissolve in the fountain’s endless cycle. <words>266</words>  

He was their last witness, their final chance to be heard. <words>280</words>  

A gust of wind, impossible in this buried world, rustled the orchard’s leaves, carrying with it a voice—a sigh of relief, a breath of release. <words>306</words>  

Varn paused, his mechanical heart humming in resonance with the unseen presence. <words>322</words>  

He had gathered enough. <words>330</words>  

With careful precision, he placed the final piece into the mosaic forming at the fountain’s edge. <words>351</words>  

The orchard trembled, the river’s glow intensifying, and for a moment, the weight of all that had been left unsaid filled the air. <words>377</words>  

Then, silence. <words>384</words>  

Varn stood, his task complete, the opera glasses slipping back into his satchel. <words>403</words>  

The orchard would remain, the river would flow, and the confessions, at last, had been heard. <words>423</words>  

He turned, stepping away from the fountain, his metallic frame reflecting the starlight as he disappeared into the infinite. <words>448</words>
