Jonas stood at the edge of the lunar greenhouse, his posture rigid, his fingers tightening around a faded photograph. <words>17</words>  

The image was nearly worn away, but he could still make out the face of the man who had once controlled his every move. <words>36</words>  

He exhaled slowly, his breath fogging against the reinforced glass that separated him from the crater’s endless expanse. <words>50</words>  

For years, he had been a bodyguard, his life dictated by orders, his choices made for him. <words>64</words>  

But now, amid park visits with the children of the colony, he had begun to see another way. <words>80</words>  

He had started collecting fragments of overheard stories, piecing together a truth that had eluded him for too long. <words>97</words>  

The people here spoke of freedom, of second chances, of rebirth. <words>107</words>  

And Jonas, serendipitously stubborn, had decided it was time to ratify his own escape. <words>121</words>  

The greenhouse was his refuge, a place where he could think without the weight of his past pressing down on him. <words>138</words>  

The plants thrived in the artificial light, their roots stretching into nutrient-rich soil, unshackled by the barren world outside. <words>155</words>  

He envied them. <words>157</words>  

A soft chime signaled the arrival of someone else. <words>166</words>  

Jonas turned, his muscles tensing instinctively, but it was only Mira, the colony’s botanist. <words>181</words>  

She studied him with knowing eyes, her hands dusted with soil. <words>192</words>  

“You’re always here,” she said, her voice calm but probing. <words>204</words>  

Jonas hesitated, then held up the photograph. <words>213</words>  

“This man,” he said, “he owned me.” <words>221</words>  

Mira nodded, waiting. <words>224</words>  

“But I’ve been listening,” he continued. <words>231</words>  

“To the stories people tell when they think no one is paying attention.” <words>243</words>  

Mira smiled faintly. <words>247</words>  

“And what have you learned?” she asked. <words>254</words>  

Jonas looked back at the crater, at the vast emptiness beyond. <words>265</words>  

“That I don’t have to be who he made me.” <words>275</words>  

Mira stepped closer, brushing dirt from her palms. <words>285</words>  

“Then don’t be,” she said simply. <words>292</words>  

Jonas exhaled again, but this time, the tension in his shoulders eased. <words>304</words>  

He took the photograph and, with deliberate finality, tore it in half. <words>317</words>  

The pieces fluttered to the ground, remnants of a past he no longer needed. <words>331</words>  

Mira watched, then gestured to the plants around them. <words>342</words>  

“Rebirth happens here every day,” she said. <words>352</words>  

Jonas nodded, understanding at last. <words>359</words>  

He had been trapped in someone else’s shadow for too long. <words>370</words>  

But here, in the quiet hum of the greenhouse, he was finally free. <words>382</words>  

The anger remained, but it was no longer a cage—it was fuel. <words>395</words>  

And as he turned to leave, he knew his new life had already begun. <words>407</words>
