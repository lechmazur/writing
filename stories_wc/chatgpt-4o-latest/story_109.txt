Sir Aldric pulled his cloak tighter as he stepped into the secret agent center, the cold biting through his armor. <words>16</words>  

He had always been cold-natured, but tonight, the chill felt deeper, as if it reached into his very bones. <words>32</words>  

The mission was simple: retrieve folk remedies hidden within incomplete family altars scattered across the city. <words>45</words>  

Aldric had never questioned his orders, but something about this task unsettled him. <words>57</words>  

Why would a knight be sent to collect such things in the dead of night? <words>69</words>  

The hush of a deserted intersection greeted him as he stepped outside, the streets empty save for flickering lamplight. <words>84</words>  

He moved swiftly, his boots barely making a sound against the cobblestones. <words>95</words>  

The first altar stood beneath a crumbling archway, candles long extinguished, offerings scattered. <words>108</words>  

Among the relics, he found a child’s lost mitten, small and threadbare. <words>120</words>  

Something about it made him pause, his fingers tracing the worn fabric. <words>132</words>  

Memories stirred—of a time before duty, before the cold had settled into his soul. <words>145</words>  

He tucked the mitten into his belt and moved on, the night pressing close. <words>157</words>  

Each altar told a story of absence, of families fractured and incomplete. <words>169</words>  

Aldric had always followed the law, but tonight, he felt the weight of its rigidity. <words>183</words>  

What good were rules if they left people broken? <words>191</words>  

At the final altar, he hesitated, the remedies gathered in his satchel. <words>203</words>  

He had been sent to retrieve them, but now, he questioned why. <words>215</words>  

A figure emerged from the shadows—a woman, her eyes sharp yet weary. <words>227</words>  

“You don’t have to take them,” she said, voice low. <words>237</words>  

Aldric studied her, the weight of his duty pressing against the stirrings of something new. <words>251</words>  

“What would you have me do?” he asked. <words>258</words>  

“Support those who need them,” she replied. <words>266</words>  

The law dictated he complete his mission, but his heart whispered otherwise. <words>278</words>  

For the first time, he chose rebellion—not for chaos, but for justice. <words>291</words>  

He left the remedies at the altars, ensuring they would reach those who needed them. <words>305</words>  

As he turned to leave, his fingers brushed the mitten once more. <words>317</words>  

A warmth spread through him, unfamiliar yet welcome. <words>327</words>  

Perhaps, he thought, this was his true awakening—not of battle, but of art. <words>341</words>  

The art of mending what had been broken. <words>349</words>  

And with that, he disappeared into the night, the hush of the intersection closing behind him. <words>364</words>
