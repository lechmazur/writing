The raft drifted free, its rough-hewn logs creaking as they met the open water. <words>14</words>  

Baron Elias watched from the shore, his fingers tracing silent symbols in the air. <words>26</words>  

The catacomb orchard behind him whispered with unseen movement, roots shifting between ancient bones. <words>39</words>  

He had lived here for years, archiving the seasons in ways only he understood. <words>51</words>  

Each tree bore marks of his observations, carved in a language no one else read. <words>64</words>  

Tonight, the river called him forward, its surface reflecting the unknown like a dark mirror. <words>78</words>  

He knelt, unearthing an empty bottle buried beneath the gnarled roots of an apple tree. <words>91</words>  

Inside, a brittle parchment held the record of a season long past. <words>102</words>  

His hands trembled as he unrolled it, the ink faded but the meaning clear. <words>115</words>  

Storms had come early that year, twisting the orchard into something visibly obscure. <words>127</words>  

He had written of the way the wind howled through the hollowed skulls below. <words>140</words>  

Now, the air was still, but doubt flickered in his chest like a dying ember. <words>153</words>  

He turned toward the raft, stepping onto its uneven surface with careful deliberation. <words>165</words>  

The river would take him where it wished, and he would record what he found. <words>178</words>  

A shadow moved among the trees, a figure watching, hands speaking in silent gestures. <words>191</words>  

Elias responded in kind, his fingers shaping the question: "Why do you follow?" <words>203</words>  

The figure hesitated, then signed back: "To see what you see." <words>214</words>  

Elias considered this, the luminous doubt in his mind shifting like the current. <words>227</words>  

He gestured toward the raft, an invitation unspoken but understood. <words>238</words>  

The figure stepped forward, their bare feet pressing into the damp earth. <words>250</words>  

Together, they pushed off, the raft gliding into the unknown. <words>261</words>  

The orchard receded, its roots still tangled in the past. <words>272</words>  

Elias held the empty bottle close, ready to fill it with what came next. <words>285</words>  

The river carried them forward, its surface rippling with secrets yet to be written. <words>298</words>  

The figure beside him signed a single word: "Watch." <words>307</words>  

Elias nodded, his eyes fixed on the horizon, where the seasons would change again. <words>320</words>
