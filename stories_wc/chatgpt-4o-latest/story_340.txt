The treehouse city of Viridia swayed with the wind, its rope bridges creaking like old bones whispering secrets. <words>19</words>  

At its highest perch, exorcist Liora sat cross-legged, flipping through a battered grimoire that smelled of damp parchment and regret. <words>38</words>  

She had pried it from a wizard’s cold fingers years ago, and it still hummed with stolen knowledge. <words>54</words>  

Her fingers traced the curling script, searching for the spell that would finally let her outshine the shadow looming over her name. <words>75</words>  

Her father, the great Elias Voss, had been the most feared exorcist in the Amazon. <words>89</words>  

Now, his legend clung to her like a second skin, suffocating and inescapable. <words>103</words>  

She snapped the book shut, scowling. <words>107</words>  

"Responsibility is just a fancy word for a leash," she muttered, standing. <words>121</words>  

The city pulsed with life below—merchants hawking charms, children swinging from vines, elders murmuring prayers to the trees. <words>141</words>  

But something was wrong. <words>145</words>  

The air thickened, the wind stilled, and then—just for a fraction of a second—the clock in the central tower skipped a beat. <words>167</words>  

Liora’s stomach twisted. <words>171</words>  

That was never a good sign. <words>176</words>  

A shriek tore through the canopy, followed by the unmistakable sound of a path sealing shut. <words>194</words>  

She turned sharply—one of the main vine bridges had curled in on itself, trapping a group of villagers on the other side. <words>216</words>  

A shadow slithered between the branches, its form flickering like a candle’s last breath. <words>233</words>  

Liora grinned, cracking her knuckles. <words>238</words>  

"Finally, something interesting." <words>242</words>  

She leapt from her perch, landing with a thud on a lower platform. <words>255</words>  

The shadow lunged, its tendrils reaching for her throat. <words>266</words>  

She ducked, flipping open the grimoire mid-roll. <words>277</words>  

The spell she needed was risky, but she had never been one for caution. <words>292</words>  

"Time to youthify, you ancient parasite," she growled, slamming her palm onto the page. <words>309</words>  

A burst of violet light erupted, wrapping around the shadow like a cocoon. <words>322</words>  

It writhed, shrinking, its form twisting into something smaller, weaker—until it was nothing more than a whimpering wisp. <words>343</words>  

Liora smirked, scooping the tiny specter into a glass vial. <words>354</words>  

"Not so scary now, are you?" <words>359</words>  

The villagers cheered as the sealed path reopened, vines unfurling like relieved sighs. <words>374</words>  

Liora dusted off her hands, feeling the weight of responsibility settle back onto her shoulders. <words>391</words>  

She hated it. <words>394</words>  

But maybe, just maybe, she was starting to wear it well. <words>407</words>
