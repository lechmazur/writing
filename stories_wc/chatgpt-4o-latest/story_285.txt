The frigid tundra orchard stretched endlessly, its skeletal trees steaming where geothermal vents cracked the ice. <words>16</words>  

A hesitant swordsman stood among them, his breath curling in the air, fingers twitching over his hilt. <words>30</words>  

He had always been naturally awkward, his movements stilted, his presence an ill fit for the world’s rhythm. <words>44</words>  

Yet he had come here, to this forsaken place, to restore the traditional systems lost to time. <words>57</words>  

The final piece of evidence had been filed away, and now the truth could no longer be ignored. <words>71</words>  

A blank postcard rested in his palm, its emptiness a bridge between what was and what could be. <words>85</words>  

He had found it buried beneath the archives, a relic of a world that had once thrived. <words>99</words>  

The message it should have carried had been lost, but its silence spoke louder than any words. <words>113</words>  

He watched as hermit crabs scuttled between the vents, abandoning old shells for new, shifting homes. <words>127</words>  

Their movement mirrored his purpose—bridging worlds, carrying the past forward without losing its essence. <words>140</words>  

The orchard had once been sacred, a place where elders gathered to pass down their wisdom. <words>154</words>  

Now it was a graveyard of forgotten customs, its trees bearing no fruit, its roots brittle with neglect. <words>168</words>  

He exhaled sharply, his hesitation warring with the rancor that simmered beneath his skin. <words>180</words>  

The systems had been dismantled piece by piece, discarded like shells no longer fit for use. <words>194</words>  

But tradition was not something to be abandoned—it was meant to evolve, to find new vessels. <words>208</words>  

He stepped forward, his boots crunching against the frost, the postcard trembling in his grip. <words>222</words>  

The geothermal vents hissed, their warmth a fleeting promise against the tundra’s relentless cold. <words>235</words>  

He had spent years in the shadows, watching, waiting, unsure if he was meant to act. <words>249</words>  

But hesitation had no place here; the time to emerge had come. <words>259</words>  

He knelt, pressing the postcard into the frozen earth, as if planting a seed of remembrance. <words>273</words>  

The wind howled through the orchard, carrying whispers of voices long silenced. <words>285</words>  

He closed his eyes, listening, feeling the weight of history settle upon his shoulders. <words>298</words>  

The hermit crabs continued their slow migration, shifting, adapting, surviving. <words>309</words>  

He would do the same. <words>313</words>  

Rising, he turned toward the horizon, where the first light of dawn bled into the sky. <words>327</words>  

The past would not be forgotten, nor would it remain unchanged. <words>338</words>  

It would move forward, carried by those willing to bear its weight. <words>350</words>  

And so would he. <words>354</words>
