The wasteland orchard stood defiantly amid the swirling radioactive dust, its gnarled trees bearing fruit that glowed faintly under the ashen sky. <words>19</words>  

Elias, a headstrong mage draped in tattered robes, traced his fingers over the stained glass box in his hands. <words>36</words>  

The box shimmered with fractured hues, a relic from a time when color had not yet abandoned the world. <words>51</words>  

He exhaled, tenuously certain that what he was about to do would work. <words>63</words>  

The orchard had survived, but survival was not enough—he wanted it to thrive, to bloom in defiance of the gray. <words>81</words>  

The old record player beside him scratched its last tune, the final note dissolving into the wind. <words>96</words>  

It was time. <words>99</words>  

He reached into his satchel and pulled out a tattered costume, once vibrant, now dulled by time. <words>115</words>  

Glitter clung to its fabric, the residue of forgotten performances, of joy that had once been effortless. <words>130</words>  

He whispered an incantation, his voice steady despite the weight of his task. <words>143</words>  

The glitter lifted, swirling in the air like embers caught in a breeze. <words>156</words>  

It drifted toward the trees, settling on their branches, their leaves, their fruit. <words>169</words>  

For a moment, nothing happened. <words>173</words>  

Then, color bled into the orchard, hesitant at first, then bold, then unstoppable. <words>187</words>  

The trees blushed with crimson and gold, the fruit deepened into rich purples and oranges. <words>201</words>  

Elias let out a breathless laugh, a sound edged with merry bitterness. <words>214</words>  

He had done it. <words>217</words>  

But his work was not yet finished. <words>222</words>  

He turned to the figure watching him from the shadows of a skeletal tree. <words>234</words>  

Lena. <words>235</words>  

She had always been there, a quiet presence, a steady force. <words>247</words>  

He had never found the courage to confess what she meant to him. <words>259</words>  

Not until now. <words>262</words>  

He stepped forward, the stained glass box still in his hands. <words>274</words>  

“I saved this for you,” he said, his voice softer than he intended. <words>287</words>  

Lena’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. <words>294</words>  

She reached out, her fingers brushing the glass, tracing the colors now reflected in the orchard. <words>308</words>  

“You brought color back,” she murmured. <words>314</words>  

Elias swallowed. <words>316</words>  

“I wanted to bring it back for you.” <words>322</words>  

The wind carried the scent of fruit, of earth, of something reborn. <words>334</words>  

Lena smiled, and for the first time in years, it felt real. <words>346</words>  

She lifted the box, turning it in her hands, watching the light dance through it. <words>359</words>  

Then, with a knowing glance, she whispered, “You always had the magic.” <words>372</words>  

Elias laughed, the sound ringing through the orchard, through the wasteland, through the world they were rebuilding. <words>387</words>  

And for the first time in a long time, he felt whole. <words>398</words>
