Lord Edwin Pembroke adjusted his silk cravat, sighing as he scraped dirt from his gloves. <words>14</words>  

Yard work was unbecoming of an aristocrat, but the hedgehog needed protection. <words>27</words>  

The poor creature had taken refuge in his garden, trembling beneath the rosebush. <words>39</words>  

Edwin, despite his station, had always possessed an unusually perceptive nature. <words>50</words>  

He sensed the silent plea in the hedgehog’s beady eyes. <words>60</words>  

Unfortunately, his cousin, Lord Reginald, had a penchant for cruel amusements. <words>73</words>  

If Reginald discovered the hedgehog, it would not survive the evening. <words>85</words>  

Edwin resolved to smuggle it to safety, but he needed assistance. <words>97</words>  

That led him to the secret agent workshop hidden beneath his estate. <words>110</words>  

The workshop bustled with quiet efficiency, filled with peculiar contraptions. <words>121</words>  

Edwin, ever the submissive aristocrat, hesitated before addressing the quartermaster. <words>134</words>  

“Pardon me, but I require a discreet means of transport.” <words>145</words>  

The quartermaster, a wiry woman named Miss Henshaw, raised an eyebrow. <words>157</words>  

“For what purpose, my lord?” she asked, voice laced with skepticism. <words>170</words>  

Edwin hesitated, then murmured, “To protect a vulnerable creature.” <words>181</words>  

Miss Henshaw studied him, then nodded, handing him a dull letter opener. <words>195</words>  

“Not much of a weapon,” Edwin remarked, turning it over. <words>206</words>  

“It’s not for fighting,” she said. “It’s for liquefying documents.” <words>219</words>  

Edwin blinked. “I beg your pardon?” <words>224</words>  

She smirked. “Press the hilt, and ink dissolves into nothingness.” <words>236</words>  

“Fascinating,” Edwin murmured, slipping it into his pocket. <words>245</words>  

As he turned to leave, voices echoed from the adjacent chamber. <words>257</words>  

Unplanned eavesdropping was hardly gentlemanly, but he couldn’t help himself. <words>270</words>  

Reginald’s voice carried through the chamber, sharp with amusement. <words>281</words>  

“Did you hear? My dear cousin is playing gardener again.” <words>293</words>  

A chuckle followed. “What’s he up to this time?” <words>304</words>  

“Something about a hedgehog,” Reginald sneered. “I think I’ll pay it a visit.” <words>318</words>  

Edwin’s grip tightened around the letter opener. <words>326</words>  

Silent empathy had always been his strength, but action was required. <words>339</words>  

He hurried back to the garden, heart pounding. <words>347</words>  

The hedgehog remained curled beneath the roses, unaware of its peril. <words>360</words>  

Edwin scooped it up, tucking it into his coat. <words>371</words>  

Reginald’s footsteps crunched on the gravel path behind him. <words>382</words>  

“Edwin,” Reginald drawled. “What are you hiding?” <words>391</words>  

Edwin turned, forcing an easy smile. <words>398</words>  

“Nothing of consequence, dear cousin.” <words>403</words>  

Reginald’s gaze narrowed. “Hand it over.” <words>410</words>  

Edwin withdrew the letter opener, pressing the hilt. <words>419</words>  

A faint hiss filled the air as ink on Reginald’s papers vanished. <words>432</words>  

Reginald gaped. “What—” <words>435</words>  

“Ah,” Edwin said, feigning regret. “Your hunting permits, I presume?” <words>448</words>  

Reginald paled. “You—” <words>451</words>  

“Best be careful with your paperwork,” Edwin said lightly. <words>461</words>  

He turned on his heel, hedgehog safe in his coat. <words>472</words>  

For once, submission had served him well. <words>480</words>
