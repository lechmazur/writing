The abandoned spaceport customs office smelled of rust and old regrets. <words>10</words>  

Amid the hum of server rooms, Kieran sat alone, his fingers tracing the hilt of his rapier. <words>22</words>  

Once, he had been a duelist of renown, but now he was merely a man haunted by his failures. <words>35</words>  

Before him rested a maggoty wooden chest that rattled with every shift of the stale air. <words>47</words>  

It had belonged to his father, a man whose shadow he had never escaped. <words>58</words>  

Kieran had spent years perfecting his technique, precisely innovative in every strike. <words>69</words>  

Yet, his fatal flaw had always been his inability to forgive—himself, his father, his past. <words>82</words>  

He unlatched the chest, its hinges groaning like old bones. <words>91</words>  

Inside, he found brittle pages filled with recipes, annotated in his father’s sharp hand. <words>103</words>  

Kieran had expected weapons, not instructions for meals long forgotten. <words>113</words>  

His father had been a duelist too, but also a cook, one who believed in tradition. <words>125</words>  

Kieran had rebelled against that, choosing the blade over the kitchen. <words>135</words>  

Now, he realized the recipes were more than instructions—they were a legacy. <words>146</words>  

One caught his eye: a dish that required elasticizing dough through unexpected mutations of family techniques. <words>160</words>  

It was a challenge, one that demanded both precision and innovation. <words>170</words>  

He set to work, his hands moving with the same discipline he had once reserved for dueling. <words>183</words>  

Flour dusted the air as he kneaded, stretched, and folded, pushing the dough beyond its limits. <words>196</words>  

The hum of the servers became a rhythm, guiding his movements. <words>206</words>  

As the dough transformed, so did something within him. <words>215</words>  

He saw his father’s hands in his own, the same careful touch, the same relentless pursuit of perfection. <words>229</words>  

For the first time, he understood—his father had never wanted to control him, only to teach him. <words>243</words>  

The realization struck deeper than any blade ever had. <words>252</words>  

He had spent his life dueling ghosts, never realizing the fight had always been with himself. <words>265</words>  

The dish was complete, its aroma filling the empty space with something almost like warmth. <words>278</words>  

He took a bite, and memories flooded back—laughter, quiet moments, lessons unspoken. <words>290</words>  

Tears welled in his eyes, not of sorrow, but of bittersweet reckoning. <words>301</words>  

Forgiveness was not a single act but a process, like perfecting a recipe. <words>312</words>  

He had always sought mastery in combat, but perhaps true mastery lay in understanding. <words>324</words>  

Kieran closed the chest, no longer rattling, no longer a burden. <words>334</words>  

He stood, feeling lighter than he had in years. <words>343</words>  

The past could not be changed, but the future was his to shape. <words>354</words>  

With one last glance at the empty customs office, he stepped forward, ready to begin again. <words>367</words>
