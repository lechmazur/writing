The abandoned carnival shooting gallery stood in eerie silence, its rusted rifles still lined up as if waiting for hands that would never return. <words>19</words>  

Jonah stepped inside, his boots crunching on shattered glass, the scent of saltwater still clinging to his wetsuit. <words>34</words>  

He was a wreck-diver by trade, but a ghost whisperer by fate, drawn to places where the past refused to sink. <words>50</words>  

Tonight, he sought something more than echoes—he sought himself. <words>59</words>  

In his palm, he clutched a piece of amber, its trapped insect frozen in time, a relic of a world that had moved on. <words>76</words>  

It had been his father’s, passed down through generations, a talisman of their family’s tradition—attending the carnival together every summer. <words>93</words>  

But the carnival had died, and so had his father, leaving Jonah adrift in the shadow of a man he could never quite become. <words>111</words>  

A whisper stirred the dust. <words>115</words>  

He turned, pulse quickening, as a figure flickered between the lines of a half-written letter he had never finished. <words>132</words>  

The ghost of his father stood by the rusted counter, his expression joyfully melancholic, as if savoring a memory that both warmed and ached. <words>150</words>  

“You never finished writing to me,” the ghost murmured, his voice carrying the weight of tides. <words>163</words>  

Jonah swallowed hard, the amber pressing into his palm. <words>174</words>  

“I didn’t know what to say,” he admitted. <words>183</words>  

His father’s gaze drifted to the rifles, then back to Jonah. <words>194</words>  

“Then say it now.” <words>199</words>  

Jonah hesitated, then reached for one of the rusted guns, its barrel cold beneath his fingers. <words>214</words>  

He aimed at the row of faded tin ducks, the same ones he had tried to hit as a child, always missing, always disappointing. <words>232</words>  

His father had been a champion shot, his laughter ringing through the carnival air, his presence larger than life. <words>247</words>  

Jonah squeezed the trigger. <words>251</words>  

The rifle clicked, empty. <words>255</words>  

A chuckle, soft as the tide. <words>260</words>  

“You always hesitated,” his father said. <words>268</words>  

Jonah exhaled, his grip loosening. <words>276</words>  

“I don’t want to be you,” he said, the words arousing something deep within him, something thawing. <words>292</words>  

His father nodded, the ghostly edges of his form flickering. <words>303</words>  

“Good,” he said. <words>307</words>  

Jonah looked down at the amber, the insect inside forever trapped, forever waiting. <words>320</words>  

He set it on the counter and stepped back. <words>330</words>  

The ghost smiled, then faded, leaving only the scent of salt and rust. <words>344</words>  

Jonah turned and walked away, stepping out of the shadow, into the fleeting rebellion of his own life. <words>360</words>
