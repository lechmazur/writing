Sir Alden knelt at the entrance of the hedge maze, his fingers tightening around the stray jigsaw edge he had carried since childhood. <words>17</words>  

The mystic orchard garden lay hidden within, its trees whispering secrets in the hush of the streetlamp flickering out behind him. <words>35</words>  

He had spent years chasing rumors of the machine that cycled regrets, a cursed device that trapped souls in endless longing. <words>53</words>  

Tonight, he would reclaim what was lost—not just for himself, but for all who had suffered under its cruel design. <words>71</words>  

Alden was cleverly naive, believing that hope alone could undo the machine’s grip, yet wise enough to seek the right path. <words>89</words>  

He stepped forward, the maze shifting around him, its walls breathing as if alive, guiding him deeper into its heart. <words>107</words>  

The orchard garden emerged from the mist, its trees heavy with luminous fruit, pulsing in rhythm with an unseen force. <words>125</words>  

At the center stood the machine, a towering construct of brass and glass, its gears grinding with the weight of sorrow. <words>143</words>  

Alden’s heart clenched as he saw spectral figures trapped within its glow, their faces twisted in agonizing bliss. <words>159</words>  

He recognized one—a woman with silver eyes, her expression frozen between joy and despair—his mother, lost years ago. <words>177</words>  

Tears burned his eyes, but he steadied himself, gripping the jigsaw edge, knowing it was the key to neutralizing the machine. <words>195</words>  

The device operated by syncing with cryptic frequencies, feeding on the echoes of regret that resonated through the orchard. <words>211</words>  

Alden closed his eyes, attuning himself to the machine’s rhythm, feeling its pulse align with his own heartbeat. <words>227</words>  

The jigsaw edge vibrated in his palm, a fragment of something greater, a missing piece that could disrupt the cycle. <words>245</words>  

He stepped forward, pressing the jagged piece into the machine’s core, forcing it to acknowledge an incomplete pattern. <words>261</words>  

The gears shuddered, the spectral figures flickering as the machine faltered, its harmony fractured by the intrusion. <words>277</words>  

Alden gritted his teeth, pushing deeper, syncing his own regrets with the machine’s frequency, forcing it to unravel. <words>293</words>  

The orchard trembled, the luminous fruit dimming as the machine let out a final, shuddering sigh. <words>307</words>  

One by one, the trapped souls dissolved into light, their burdens lifted, their regrets no longer feeding the cycle. <words>325</words>  

His mother’s silver eyes met his, gratitude shining before she, too, faded into the night. <words>339</words>  

Alden collapsed to his knees, the jigsaw edge crumbling in his grasp, its purpose fulfilled. <words>353</words>  

The orchard garden remained, but the machine was gone, its presence erased, leaving only silence and the scent of fruit. <words>371</words>  

He had reclaimed what was lost—not just his mother, but the hope that regret could be undone. <words>387</words>  

As dawn broke beyond the hedge maze, Alden rose, his heart lighter, his purpose fulfilled. <words>401</words>
