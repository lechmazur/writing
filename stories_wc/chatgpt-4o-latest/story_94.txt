Celeste adjusted her amber earrings, their golden glow catching the light from the sky reflection pool beneath her. <words>14</words>  

She had spent years counseling the brokenhearted, but tonight, she was the one seeking answers. <words>28</words>  

The pool shimmered, reflecting not just the sky but the weight of unspoken desires. <words>39</words>  

She had tracked cloud trails across centuries, following the gravitational pull of longing itself. <words>51</words>  

Time travel had made it possible, but it had also made her restless. <words>62</words>  

She zipped her leather jacket, the motion sharp, decisive. <words>70</words>  

Freedom was an illusion, but she intended to proclaim herself free anyway. <words>81</words>  

The man she sought had left echoes in time, ripples in the fabric of longing. <words>94</words>  

She had counseled countless souls, but his heartbreak had been different. <words>105</words>  

It had been a wound so deep it bent reality around it. <words>116</words>  

She had to know—was it love or merely the gravity of desire? <words>128</words>  

The sky reflection pool held the answer, if she dared to look. <words>139</words>  

She knelt, her fingers skimming the surface, distorting the mirrored clouds. <words>151</words>  

A shimmer, a shift—time unraveled, revealing the past she had chased. <words>163</words>  

There he was, standing at the edge of another time, waiting. <words>174</words>  

His eyes met hers through the rippling veil, recognition sparking. <words>185</words>  

"You followed me," he murmured, his voice a whisper across time. <words>197</words>  

"I had to know," she admitted, her curiosity never allowing rest. <words>209</words>  

He smiled, but it was laced with sorrow. <words>216</words>  

"Desire is a force stronger than time," he said. <words>225</words>  

She felt it then—the pull, the weight, the inevitability. <words>236</words>  

She had counseled others to let go, but could she? <words>247</words>  

The sky reflection pool shimmered, offering a choice. <words>256</words>  

Stay, surrender to gravity, or break free from the illusion. <words>267</words>  

Her fingers brushed the surface again, distorting his image. <words>278</words>  

She had chased him through time, but she would not be trapped. <words>290</words>  

With a deep breath, she stood, stepping back from the pool. <words>301</words>  

His reflection wavered, his expression unreadable. <words>308</words>  

"You were never meant to stay," he said softly. <words>317</words>  

She touched her amber earrings, grounding herself in the present. <words>328</words>  

"No," she agreed, "but I had to see." <words>337</words>  

The sky darkened, the clouds shifting, time resetting. <words>346</words>  

She turned, walking away, her heart lighter than before. <words>357</words>  

The gravity of desire had pulled her in, but she had let go. <words>369</words>  

She zipped her jacket again, sealing the past behind her. <words>380</words>  

The sky reflection pool stilled, holding only the present now. <words>391</words>  

She had proclaimed herself free, and for the first time, she was. <words>403</words>
