The glacial orchard hung in eerie stillness, its frozen boughs arching over the abyss of blue ice below. <words>14</words>  

Eryndor, the last druid, moved between the crystalline trees, his breath curling in the frigid air. <words>28</words>  

He had spent decades alone, tending to the orchard, speaking only to the wind and the roots. <words>42</words>  

Silence had become his companion, his shield, his prison. <words>50</words>  

But today, he would break it. <words>56</words>  

His hands trembled as he gathered the frost-laden fruit, their skins shimmering like trapped stars. <words>69</words>  

Each one was necessary for the meal—a tradition he had not honored in years. <words>82</words>  

The special family meal, once prepared only on birthdays, had been abandoned when the others left. <words>96</words>  

Not left—died. <words>98</words>  

Eryndor exhaled sharply, his fiercely ambivalent heart warring between grief and obligation. <words>110</words>  

He had sworn never to speak again, never to acknowledge the void their absence had carved. <words>123</words>  

Yet, the silence had grown too heavy, pressing against his ribs like an iron vice. <words>136</words>  

He set the fruit down on the ice-carved table, his fingers brushing against a dull safety pin. <words>150</words>  

It had once fastened his sister’s cloak, a relic of warmth in a world of cold. <words>163</words>  

He picked it up, turning it over in his palm, feeling its uselessness, its weight. <words>176</words>  

A bitter chuckle escaped him—dour amusement at the absurdity of sentimentality. <words>188</words>  

Still, he pinned it to his own cloak, a quiet defiance against forgetting. <words>200</words>  

The meal took shape slowly, each step a ritual, each movement a memory. <words>212</words>  

He crushed the fruit, its juices running like liquid sapphire over his fingers. <words>224</words>  

The scent filled the air, sharp and sweet, a ghost of past celebrations. <words>236</words>  

He stirred the mixture over the fire, the flames casting flickering shadows on the ice. <words>249</words>  

His hands shook—not from cold, but from the fear coiled deep in his chest. <words>262</words>  

To speak would be to acknowledge his solitude, to invite the echoes of the dead. <words>275</words>  

But silence had ruled him too long. <words>280</words>  

He ladled the meal into a carved bowl, setting it before the empty seats. <words>293</words>  

The orchard groaned as the ice shifted, a sound like distant thunder. <words>305</words>  

Eryndor took a breath, his throat tight, his heart hammering. <words>315</words>  

Then, with a voice cracked from disuse, he whispered, “Happy birthday.” <words>327</words>  

The words shattered the silence, rippling through the frozen air like a spell undone. <words>340</words>  

For the first time in years, he was not afraid. <words>348</words>  

The orchard seemed to sigh, the ice settling, the wind carrying his words away. <words>361</words>  

Eryndor closed his eyes, the weight in his chest lifting, just a little. <words>373</words>  

He ate in silence, but it was no longer the silence of the lost. <words>385</words>  

It was the silence of the living. <words>390</words>
