The red recording light flickered in the dim booth, casting eerie shadows on the walls. <words>14</words>  

Victor, the lonely ringleader of a forgotten circus, adjusted his headset and cleared his throat. <words>27</words>  

Between whispered confessions, he spun tales of ghosts that danced in the dark. <words>37</words>  

Tonight, however, his voice wavered as he unfolded a stained napkin on the desk. <words>50</words>  

The napkin bore cryptic symbols, passed down through generations of his family. <words>61</words>  

Ancestral wisdom, his grandmother had called it, though he never understood its purpose. <words>74</words>  

Yet, he guarded it fiercely, knowing it was an inexplicable artifact of great power. <words>87</words>  

A flickering candle floated beside him, its flame twisting in zero gravity. <words>98</words>  

He had learned to read omens by the dance of a flame. <words>110</words>  

Tonight, the flame spun erratically, warning him of unseen dangers. <words>121</words>  

Victor exhaled, his breath fogging the glass of the recording booth. <words>132</words>  

A presence lurked beyond the microphone, unseen but undeniably there. <words>143</words>  

He was commonly individual, preferring solitude over the company of others. <words>155</words>  

Yet, in this moment, he longed for another voice to confirm his fears. <words>168</words>  

The napkin trembled as if touched by invisible fingers, its symbols glowing faintly. <words>181</words>  

Victor’s pulse quickened, but he forced a playful chuckle into the microphone. <words>193</words>  

“Listeners, have you ever felt watched when you were alone?” he whispered. <words>205</words>  

The candle’s flame twisted sharply, signaling an imminent threat. <words>215</words>  

Victor knew he had to outmaneuver whatever haunted the booth. <words>226</words>  

He recalled his grandmother’s words: “The napkin reveals truth when fear clouds the mind.” <words>240</words>  

With trembling fingers, he traced the symbols, feeling warmth pulse beneath his touch. <words>253</words>  

The booth’s walls shimmered, revealing shadowy figures pressing against the glass. <words>264</words>  

Their mouths moved in silent screams, their eyes hollow voids of despair. <words>276</words>  

Victor’s breath hitched, but he focused on the flame’s erratic dance. <words>288</words>  

It spun left, then right, guiding him through the ancestral ritual. <words>299</words>  

He whispered the words etched into the napkin, his voice steady. <words>310</words>  

The figures recoiled, their forms unraveling like smoke in the wind. <words>321</words>  

The booth fell silent, save for the crackling of the floating candle. <words>333</words>  

Victor exhaled, his body sagging with relief as the napkin darkened. <words>345</words>  

The symbols faded, their purpose fulfilled, leaving only an ordinary stain. <words>357</words>  

He leaned into the microphone, his voice laced with playful dread. <words>368</words>  

“And that, dear listeners, is why some stories should never be told.” <words>380</words>  

The red recording light flickered once more before the booth went dark. <words>392</words>
