The attic smelled of dust and lavender, a contradiction that suited Elias perfectly. <words>13</words>  

He was a poet who never slept, a man who found meaning in the spaces between words. <words>26</words>  

His desk was a battlefield of ink-stained pages and botanical samples, pressed between books he never finished. <words>39</words>  

Each leaf and petal held a secret, a whisper of something lost, something waiting to be understood. <words>52</words>  

Tonight, the whispers were louder, curling through the rafters like ghosts of forgotten verses. <words>63</words>  

Elias traced the veins of a dried fern, his fingers trembling from too much coffee and too little rest. <words>76</words>  

The attic was haunted, but not by spirits—by warnings, murmured in voices only he could hear. <words>89</words>  

They spoke of elimination, of choices made in shadows, of truths spilled in drunken confessions at after-parties. <words>102</words>  

He had heard them before, between subway stops, when the city blurred into a smear of neon and regret. <words>115</words>  

The poets and philosophers, the dreamers and drunks, they all spoke of power, of violence, of inevitability. <words>128</words>  

But Elias wanted something else—he wanted to discover the power of non-violence, to carve meaning from restraint. <words>141</words>  

His meticulous mess reflected his mind: chaotic yet deliberate, a contradiction of order and disorder. <words>152</words>  

The whispers warned him again, curling around his ears like ivy, urging him to act before it was too late. <words>165</words>  

He closed his eyes, listening, feeling the weight of their urgency press against his ribs. <words>176</words>  

Somewhere in the city, another after-party raged, another confession slurred its way into existence. <words>187</words>  

He had been there before, had heard the secrets spill like wine onto cracked wooden floors. <words>200</words>  

Eliminate, they had said, as if destruction was the only path to change. <words>211</words>  

But Elias knew better—knew that words, wielded carefully, could dismantle without bloodshed. <words>222</words>  

He gathered his botanical samples, each one a fragment of something resilient, something that had survived. <words>235</words>  

The whispers grew frantic, warning him of what would come if he did nothing. <words>246</words>  

Between subway stops, he had seen the faces of those who believed in violence, their eyes hollow with certainty. <words>259</words>  

He would not be one of them. <words>263</words>  

The attic pulsed with unseen energy, the weight of history pressing against his skin. <words>274</words>  

He dipped his pen into ink, the black liquid spreading like roots across the page. <words>285</words>  

His words would be his weapon, his defiance, his answer to the whispers that begged for destruction. <words>298</words>  

The city would listen, eventually. <words>302</words>  

He just had to write. <words>306</words>
