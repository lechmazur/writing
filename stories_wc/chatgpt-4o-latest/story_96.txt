Ezra sat cross-legged on the floor of the witch’s familiar menagerie, a half-finished crocheted blanket draped over his lap. <words>22</words>  
The air smelled of damp fur and candle wax, a fitting backdrop for a poet who had long abandoned the stage. <words>41</words>  
A raven perched on a shelf above him, watching as he traced the edges of an antique map with a tear running through its center. <words>65</words>  
The map had come to him through a volunteer stint cataloging forgotten artifacts in a crumbling library beneath the city. <words>88</words>  
He hadn’t planned to take it, but something about its frayed edges and faded ink had whispered of unfinished journeys. <words>111</words>  
Ezra had once believed in fate, but now he preferred to surprise it with an unplanned encore. <words>130</words>  
His poetry had been a brimming cup, overflowing with words that no longer found an audience. <words>149</words>  
Now, he wrote only for himself, scrawling verses in the margins of old books and on the backs of receipts. <words>172</words>  
The witch’s familiars—cats, owls, and creatures without names—paid him no mind as he unraveled the map’s secrets. <words>195</words>  
It depicted a city beneath the city, a place where forgotten poets and lost souls might still whisper their truths. <words>218</words>  
Ezra’s fingers hovered over the tear, as if he could mend it the way he stitched his blanket. <words>239</words>  
But some things were meant to remain broken, their imperfections making them statically unique. <words>258</words>  
The witch herself had told him that once, in the same disinterested tone she used for prophecies and weather reports. <words>281</words>  
He had met her through another volunteer stint, this time tending to creatures that existed between worlds. <words>302</words>  
She had laughed when he asked why she needed help, saying even magic required maintenance. <words>323</words>  
Now, as he sat among her familiars, he realized he had been maintaining something too—his own forgotten purpose. <words>346</words>  
The map’s symbols called to him, urging him to seize the moment before it slipped away. <words>367</words>  
He folded the blanket, set it aside, and stood, the map clutched in his hand. <words>386</words>  
The raven cawed, as if offering approval, and the other creatures stirred in their cages. <words>407</words>  
Ezra smiled, a flicker of passion breaking through his practiced indifference. <words>424</words>  
Perhaps poetry wasn’t dead—perhaps it had only been waiting for him to listen again. <words>445</words>  
With the map as his guide, he stepped toward the unknown, ready to write his next verse in the city beneath. <words>470</words>
