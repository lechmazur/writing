The brittle branch snapped beneath Elric’s boot, shattering the silence of the forest. <words>14</words>  

He froze, his breath curling in the cold air, listening for any sign of pursuit. <words>27</words>  

The underground city of the dwarves lay hidden beneath the roots of these ancient trees. <words>39</words>  

Elric, a gentle conjurer, had come seeking justice for a crime long buried in shadow. <words>52</words>  

In his satchel, wrapped in velvet, rested a stained glass butterfly—his only clue. <words>64</words>  

It had once adorned the forgotten garden of the dwarves, now lost to time. <words>76</words>  

Legends spoke of its destruction, but Elric knew the truth had been obscured. <words>88</words>  

The butterfly’s shattered pieces had been scattered, and he had vowed to reassemble them. <words>101</words>  

Through reversed messages hidden in dwarven runes, he had traced the fragments’ locations. <words>113</words>  

Each clue had led him deeper into the earth, where stone whispered of betrayal. <words>126</words>  

The entrance to the city loomed ahead, its gates carved with inscrutably obvious warnings. <words>139</words>  

Elric pressed his palm to the cold metal, murmuring an incantation of passage. <words>151</words>  

The gates groaned open, revealing a labyrinth of tunnels lit by glowing fungi. <words>164</words>  

Dwarves bustled about, their eyes wary, their voices hushed with unspoken fears. <words>176</words>  

He stepped forward, clutching the butterfly, and the murmurs turned to gasps. <words>188</words>  

A dwarf elder approached, his beard braided with silver, his gaze heavy with recognition. <words>201</words>  

“You carry a relic of our past,” the elder said, voice thick with emotion. <words>213</words>  

Elric nodded. “I seek justice for the garden that was stolen from you.” <words>226</words>  

The elder’s eyes darkened. “The garden was not stolen—it was destroyed from within.” <words>239</words>  

Elric’s heart pounded. “Then help me reassemble the truth, piece by piece.” <words>251</words>  

The elder led him to a hidden chamber where broken glass glittered like stars. <words>264</words>  

Elric knelt, arranging the fragments, his magic weaving them back together. <words>276</words>  

As the butterfly took shape, memories surged forth—of betrayal, of greed, of sorrow. <words>289</words>  

The dwarves had been deceived by one of their own, a leader lost to ambition. <words>302</words>  

With the final piece in place, the butterfly pulsed with light, revealing the past. <words>315</words>  

The elder wept. “Now we see clearly. Justice must be served, and the garden restored.” <words>328</words>  

Elric smiled, joyful terror coursing through him as the city stirred with purpose. <words>341</words>  

The dwarves, once fractured, now stood united, ready to rebuild what had been lost. <words>354</words>  

As dawn broke above the forest, the underground city awakened to a new beginning. <words>367</words>  

Elric stepped back, watching as the dwarves set to work, hope rekindled in their eyes. <words>380</words>  

The butterfly, now whole, was placed at the garden’s heart, a symbol of renewal. <words>393</words>  

Justice had been found, not in vengeance, but in the act of restoration. <words>405</words>  

Elric turned, his mission complete, the brittle branches above whispering his farewell. <words>417</words>
