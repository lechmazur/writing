The floating island cloud café drifted silently above the sleeping city, its lanterns swaying in the hush of midnight. <words>16</words>  

Inside, a kindly guard named Elias stood watch, his uniform crisp but softened by years of wear. <words>30</words>  

He was loyally disloyal, sworn to protect the café but forever tempted by the horizon’s hidden promise. <words>44</words>  

Tonight, he traced the soft edges of time with his fingertips, feeling the past and future blur. <words>58</words>  

A single patron remained—a poet, tapping with the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys on the wooden table. <words>72</words>  

Elias watched as the poet measured sugar into his coffee with a basic measuring spoon. <words>85</words>  

The spoon was unremarkable, yet it held the weight of ritual, a quiet act of worship. <words>99</words>  

The poet’s eyes flickered toward Elias, sensing the guard’s longing for something beyond duty. <words>112</words>  

“You dream of leaving,” the poet murmured, stirring his coffee as if stirring fate itself. <words>125</words>  

Elias hesitated, then nodded, his heart heavy with frothy despair. <words>135</words>  

“The horizon is a promise,” Elias admitted, “but promises are often illusions.” <words>147</words>  

The poet smiled, tapping his fingers again, the rhythm echoing like distant thunder. <words>160</words>  

“Perhaps,” he said, “but illusions shape reality as much as truth does.” <words>172</words>  

Elias glanced at the café’s edge, where mist curled like whispers of forgotten dreams. <words>185</words>  

Below, the city’s grocery stores stood in midnight silence, aisles frozen in time. <words>198</words>  

He had walked those aisles before, under flickering lights, searching for something unnamed. <words>211</words>  

Now, he stood between duty and desire, between the café’s warmth and the horizon’s call. <words>224</words>  

The poet set down his spoon, its tiny clang a punctuation mark in the quiet. <words>237</words>  

“Go,” he urged, “before time hardens its edges again.” <words>247</words>  

Elias exhaled, his breath merging with the mist, his decision forming like a poem. <words>260</words>  

With one last glance at the café, he stepped forward, into the unknown. <words>272</words>
