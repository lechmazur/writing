Jace leaned against the peeling entrance sign of the abandoned funhouse, flipping a pressed four-leaf clover encased in glass between his fingers. <words>17</words>  

The smuggler’s reputation for recklessness had earned him exile from every crew he’d ever run with. <words>32</words>  

Now, he stood at the spot where the map he carried tore clean in half—one side familiar, the other a void of uncertainty. <words>50</words>  

His watch vibrated in sync with three others, signaling the moment had come. <words>61</words>  

He exhaled sharply, forcing a grin as he turned to the shadows where his would-be allies lurked. <words>75</words>  

They were a tight-knit syndicate, bound by codes he didn’t yet understand, but he knew one thing: they valued spectacle. <words>92</words>  

So, he would give them one. <words>97</words>  

Jace strode forward, arms wide, voice booming with exaggerated bravado. <words>107</words>  

“Ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and ghouls, welcome to the grandest gamble of my life!” <words>119</words>  

His words echoed through the hollow amusement park, swallowed by the eerie silence beyond. <words>131</words>  

The leader of the syndicate, a woman named Vey, stepped into the dim light, arms crossed. <words>144</words>  

“You dramatize everything,” she said, unimpressed. <words>150</words>  

Jace smirked, tapping the glass-encased clover against his palm. <words>159</words>  

“Luck’s a show, Vey. You don’t win people over with silence.” <words>169</words>  

She studied him, her expression unreadable. <words>175</words>  

Behind her, the others remained still, waiting. <words>182</words>  

Jace’s watch pulsed again, synchronized with theirs. <words>189</words>  

The plan was simple: cross the threshold, retrieve the package, return. <words>199</words>  

But the funhouse was haunted—not by spirits, but by something worse. <words>209</words>  

Memories. <words>210</words>  

Jace had been here before, years ago, with someone who mattered. <words>220</words>  

Someone who had believed in him before he’d ruined everything. <words>230</words>  

He shook off the thought and stepped forward. <words>237</words>  

The doors groaned open, revealing a corridor of warped mirrors. <words>247</words>  

His reflection twisted, splitting into versions of himself—reckless, desperate, alone. <words>258</words>  

Vey followed, her watch alarm chiming in unison with his. <words>267</words>  

“Stay rational,” she murmured. <words>272</words>  

Jace chuckled, though there was no humor in it. <words>281</words>  

“Rationally emotional,” he corrected. <words>286</words>  

She arched a brow but said nothing. <words>293</words>  

They moved deeper, past the point where the map ended. <words>302</words>  

The unknown swallowed them whole. <words>307</words>  

Jace’s fingers tightened around the clover. <words>314</words>  

He wasn’t just here for the job. <words>321</words>  

He was here to prove he belonged. <words>328</words>  

To show that even a reckless smuggler could find a place. <words>338</words>  

The funhouse whispered around them, laughter from no one, footsteps that weren’t theirs. <words>350</words>  

Vey’s watch pulsed again. <words>355</words>  

Jace met her gaze, and for the first time, she nodded. <words>364</words>  

A silent acknowledgment. <words>367</words>  

Distant companionship, but companionship nonetheless. <words>374</words>  

Jace grinned, stepping forward into the dark. <words>382</words>
