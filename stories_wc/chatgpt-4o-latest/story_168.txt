The singer’s voice faded, leaving a charged silence hanging over the stone circle. <words>14</words>  

Marla adjusted a delicate orchid in her arrangement, her fingers moving with ruthless precision. <words>28</words>  

She had spent years mastering the art of floral balance, but tonight, her focus was elsewhere. <words>41</words>  

Across from her, Julian ran a scuffed plastic comb through his unruly hair, eyes scanning the ancient carvings. <words>56</words>  

“You see the spirals?” he asked, his voice low, as if afraid to disturb the stones. <words>69</words>  

Marla nodded, her mind already leaping ahead, intellectually spontaneous as always. <words>80</words>  

“They’re not just decorative,” she said. “They distinguish different epochs of thought.” <words>92</words>  

Julian smirked. “And you figured that out between arranging lilies and threatening your suppliers?” <words>105</words>  

She ignored the jab, plucking a petal from a rose and letting it drift to the ground. <words>118</words>  

“The watcher’s burden,” she murmured. “To see, to interpret, to carry the weight of meaning.” <words>131</words>  

Julian exhaled, leaning against one of the stones. “You always do this.” <words>142</words>  

“Do what?” she asked, tilting her head. <words>149</words>  

“Turn a spontaneous road trip into a philosophical excavation.” <words>157</words>  

She smiled. “And yet, here you are.” <words>164</words>  

He chuckled, tapping the comb against his palm. “Because you make it impossible to look away.” <words>177</words>  

The pause between verses stretched, the singer waiting, the night holding its breath. <words>188</words>  

Marla traced a carving with her fingertip. “These symbols—someone left them to be understood.” <words>201</words>  

Julian sighed. “Or to confuse people like us centuries later.” <words>211</words>  

She shook her head. “No. They wanted someone to watch, to carry the burden forward.” <words>224</words>  

He studied her, the flickering torchlight casting shadows across her face. <words>234</words>  

“You’re relentless,” he said. <words>238</words>  

She plucked the comb from his hand, turning it over thoughtfully. <words>248</words>  

“This,” she said, “is a tool of order, even in its scuffed imperfection.” <words>260</words>  

Julian raised an eyebrow. “And?” <words>264</words>  

She gestured to the carvings. “Like these. Imperfect, but meant to bring clarity.” <words>276</words>  

He laughed softly. “Polite anarchy. That’s what you do.” <words>285</words>  

She inclined her head. “And you follow.” <words>291</words>  

The singer inhaled, ready to resume, but for now, the silence held them captive. <words>303</words>  

Julian exhaled. “So, what do they mean?” <words>310</words>  

Marla smiled. “That’s the burden, isn’t it?” <words>318</words>  

The music swelled again, but neither of them moved. <words>327</words>  

The watcher’s burden was theirs to bear. <words>333</words>
