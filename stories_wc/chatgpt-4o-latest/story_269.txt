The storm raged outside the steampunk observation deck, lightning illuminating the brass and glass structure in eerie flashes. <words>18</words>  
Elias, the nostalgic tailor, traced a gloved hand over the dusty mirror mounted beside the control panel. <words>33</words>  
His reflection flickered, revealing another version of himself—one with sharper eyes and a subtly menacing smirk. <words>48</words>  
He exhaled, steadying himself, knowing this moment had been inevitable since the last code was broken. <words>62</words>  
The machine hummed beneath his feet, gears shifting as the storm outside mirrored the turbulence within him. <words>76</words>  
He had spent years stitching together not just fabric, but the very threads of reality itself. <words>90</words>  
Now, standing on the precipice of something greater, he had to reassure himself. <words>102</words>  
The mirror’s surface rippled, and the other Elias spoke, his voice a whisper of static and wind. <words>117</words>  
“You fear what comes next,” the reflection murmured, “but you always have.” <words>129</words>  
Elias clenched his fists, his mind racing back to the first time he glimpsed the parallel lives. <words>144</words>  
Each stitch in his garments had been a thread in a grander tapestry, weaving destinies together. <words>159</words>  
He had seen versions of himself fail, succeed, love, and perish—all leading to this moment. <words>173</words>  
The storm outside intensified, rattling the glass panels as he made his improbable confession. <words>187</words>  
“I want to ascend beyond mortal limits,” he admitted, his voice barely audible over the wind. <words>202</words>  
The reflection’s smirk deepened, as if amused by the honesty. <words>211</words>  
“And what makes you think you deserve it?” the other Elias asked. <words>223</words>  
Elias inhaled sharply, his fingers tightening around the brass railing. <words>234</words>  
“Because I have seen every failure, every mistake, and I have learned.” <words>247</words>  
The machine beneath him whirred, responding to his conviction, the final sequence locking into place. <words>261</words>  
The reflection’s expression softened, the menace fading into something almost… proud. <words>273</words>  
“Then step forward,” it said, extending a hand through the glass. <words>285</words>  
Elias hesitated, the weight of his past selves pressing against his mind. <words>297</words>  
But hope, desperate and unyielding, propelled him forward. <words>306</words>  
His fingers met the mirror’s surface, and the world fractured around him. <words>318</words>  
The storm outside ceased, the observation deck dissolving into a cascade of golden threads. <words>332</words>  
He was no longer bound by time, by flesh, by failure. <words>343</words>  
He had become the tailor of existence itself. <words>351</words>  
And in that moment, Elias knew—he had finally ascended. <words>363</words>
