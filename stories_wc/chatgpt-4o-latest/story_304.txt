The assassin lurked in the cathedral shadows of the baroque asteroid, waiting for the bus driver to complete the final route. <words>19</words>  

Through the paint-splattered camera lens, he watched the neon-lit streets below, where the last passengers disembarked into the cold. <words>38</words>  

The road was unforgiving, winding through the asteroid’s gilded ruins, where echoes of forgotten prayers clung to the marble. <words>55</words>  

He traced the pattern of a spider’s web after rain, its delicate strands glistening like the veins of fate. <words>72</words>  

Each thread mirrored the choices that had led him here, to this moment, to this target. <words>85</words>  

The bus driver, a man with weary eyes and a heart full of unspoken regrets, stepped onto the platform. <words>103</words>  

He laughed, a sound both hollow and profound, as if mocking the weight of his own existence. <words>120</words>  

The assassin recognized that kind of laughter—it was the sound of someone who had seen too much. <words>137</words>  

He adjusted his grip on the blade, its edge catching the borrowed starlight filtering through stained-glass domes. <words>155</words>  

The driver lit a cigarette, exhaling smoke that curled like ghosts in the artificial gravity. <words>170</words>  

He had driven this route for years, watching the city decay, its grandeur crumbling beneath time’s indifference. <words>188</words>  

The assassin hesitated, his mission suddenly fragile in the face of something he couldn’t name. <words>204</words>  

The driver turned, meeting his gaze through the fractured lens, and smiled. <words>216</words>  

“You’re here for me,” he said, as if greeting an old friend. <words>229</words>  

The assassin stepped forward, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>241</words>  

“Why do you laugh?” <words>244</words>  

The driver exhaled again, watching the smoke dissolve. <words>255</words>  

“Because the road never forgives, but it always remembers.” <words>268</words>  

The assassin felt the weight of those words settle into his bones. <words>282</words>  

He had walked that road too, leaving footprints in blood and silence. <words>297</words>  

The driver flicked his cigarette away, embers scattering like dying stars. <words>311</words>  

“I’ve been waiting for this,” he murmured. <words>320</words>  

The assassin tightened his grip, but his hands trembled. <words>332</words>  

He had killed without hesitation before, but this was different. <words>347</words>  

The driver reached out, his fingers brushing the assassin’s wrist. <words>361</words>  

“Do you know what it means to cradle the dawn?” he asked. <words>376</words>  

The assassin swallowed hard, his pulse a drumbeat in the quiet. <words>390</words>  

“To hold something fragile, knowing it will slip away.” <words>403</words>  

The driver nodded. <words>406</words>  

“Then you understand.” <words>409</words>  

The assassin exhaled, lowering the blade. <words>421</words>  

For the first time, he chose to let the road remember instead of taking another life. <words>439</words>  

The driver smiled again, stepping into the dawn’s first light. <words>453</words>  

And the assassin, for once, did not follow. <words>464</words>
