Dust swirled in the attic as Gideon traced his fingers over the rusted gears of a clockwork sparrow, its wings frozen mid-flight. <words>16</words> He had come here searching for something, though he wasn’t sure what. <words>27</words> His knuckles were bruised, his ribs aching from the last fight he barely won. <words>40</words> He had spent years in the ring, throwing punches for causes he barely understood. <words>53</words> But now, he fought for something real—truth. <words>60</words>  

A glint of ceramic caught his eye beneath a pile of broken automata. <words>70</words> He reached down, pulling out a shard of a clay pot, its surface etched with an inscription. <words>84</words> The words were faded, but he recognized the script—an ancient dialect of forgotten dreams. <words>97</words> He had seen it before, in the fleeting moments between consciousness and sleep. <words>110</words>  

The attic creaked as he turned the shard over, his pulse quickening. <words>120</words> He had spent years deceiving himself, believing he fought for honor when he only fought to survive. <words>135</words> But this inscription—this fragment of something lost—held the key to extinguishing that last vestige of self-deception. <words>150</words>  

A noise behind him made him spin. <words>156</words> The clockwork animals stirred, gears clicking, eyes flickering with artificial life. <words>167</words> He wasn’t alone. <words>170</words>  

A figure emerged from the shadows, a sculptor’s chisel in one hand, its tip gleaming. <words>184</words> “You shouldn’t have found that,” the man said, his voice calm, almost regretful. <words>197</words>  

Gideon tightened his grip on the shard. <words>204</words> “What does it mean?” he demanded. <words>210</words>  

The sculptor sighed, stepping closer. <words>216</words> “It’s a map,” he said. <words>222</words> “A guide to something buried in forgotten dreams.” <words>230</words>  

Gideon’s breath caught. <words>234</words> He had always dismissed his dreams as meaningless, but what if they weren’t? <words>247</words> What if they had been leading him here all along? <words>256</words>  

The sculptor moved fast. <words>261</words> Before Gideon could react, the man struck him with the chisel’s handle. <words>273</words> Darkness swallowed him. <words>276</words>  

When he woke, he was bound to a chair, the attic’s dim light casting long shadows. <words>289</words> The sculptor stood before him, turning the shard over in his hands. <words>300</words>  

“You’re skillfully incompetent,” the man mused. <words>307</words> “You fight well, but you don’t know why.” <words>316</words>  

Gideon clenched his jaw. <words>321</words> “I know now.” <words>325</words>  

The sculptor smiled. <words>329</words> “Then prove it.” <words>333</words>  

With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the shard onto Gideon’s lap. <words>344</words> “Find what it leads to,” he said. <words>352</words> “But be warned—some truths are better left buried.” <words>362</words>  

The ropes loosened. <words>366</words> Gideon stood, rubbing his wrists, his bruises forgotten. <words>376</words> He had spent his life fighting without purpose. <words>385</words> Now, he had one. <words>389</words>  

As he stepped into the light, the first strike of a sculptor’s chisel echoed in the distance. <words>403</words> The world was being shaped, and so was he. <words>412</words>
