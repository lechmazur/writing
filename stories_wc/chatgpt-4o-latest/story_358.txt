The arctic research greenhouse stood in eerie contrast to the frozen wasteland beyond, its glass walls fogged with condensation. <words>16</words>  
Inside, an old-fashioned mage named Aldric paced between rows of frost-kissed ferns, his robes trailing over the damp floor. <words>33</words>  
He had come here not for science, but for something far older—a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, hidden beneath the soil. <words>50</words>  
The artifact pulsed with an ancient riddle, one that unfolded only through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections. <words>63</words>  
Aldric, purposefully aimless in his methods, had spent weeks deciphering its shifting symbols, yet the answer remained elusive. <words>78</words>  
He longed to claim an uncharted frontier, a realm beyond time, where forgotten gods whispered secrets to those who dared listen. <words>95</words>  
The greenhouse, though warm, felt haunted by the weight of his pursuit, the air thick with sanctified dread. <words>108</words>  
Outside, amid playground time, the distant laughter of children echoed through the icy expanse, a cruel contrast to his solemn task. <words>125</words>  
Aldric turned to a silvered panel, his own reflection staring back with weary eyes, the coffin fragment clutched in his trembling hands. <words>143</words>  
The riddle shifted again, its meaning slipping through his grasp like mist, revealing only glimpses of a forgotten path. <words>157</words>  
Frustration gnawed at him, but he knew the answer lay not in force, but in surrender. <words>170</words>  
He reached out, pressing the fragment against the mirror, watching as his reflection distorted, reshaping into something not quite human. <words>188</words>  
A voice, neither his nor the pharaoh’s, whispered from the glass, urging him to embrace the unknown. <words>202</words>  
Aldric hesitated, then stepped forward, allowing his reflection to envelop him in an otherworldly embrace. <words>216</words>  
The sensation was strange—like a cuddle from something both familiar and alien, a presence that understood his longing. <words>232</words>  
The greenhouse flickered, its walls dissolving into shifting sands, the arctic cold replaced by the dry heat of an ancient tomb. <words>249</words>  
Hieroglyphs glowed along the walls, their meaning finally clear: the riddle was not a question, but an invitation. <words>264</words>  
Aldric had not been solving it—he had been answering its call. <words>275</words>  
He turned, expecting to see his own reflection, but instead, a figure stood before him, draped in royal linen. <words>292</words>  
The pharaoh, neither living nor dead, extended a hand, offering Aldric a place beyond the reach of time. <words>308</words>  
With a final glance at the fading greenhouse, Aldric accepted, stepping into the unknown, his purpose finally found. <words>322</words>  
The children’s laughter echoed once more, distant and fading, as the last trace of the mage vanished into legend. <words>338</words>
