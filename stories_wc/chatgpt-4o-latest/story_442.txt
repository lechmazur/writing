The windmill groaned as its final rotation sent a shudder through the giant mushroom house. <words>19</words>  

Inside, Dren adjusted his leather gloves, his fingers tracing the torn corner of a flyer in his pocket. <words>38</words>  

The ink had bled over time, distorting the words, much like his own memories of why he was here. <words>58</words>  

He exhaled, the air thick with the scent of damp spores and something older, something forgotten. <words>75</words>  

The candle in his other hand flickered, its flame barely holding against the drafts that whispered through the walls. <words>96</words>  

He had to carry it through the void, though he no longer remembered why. <words>110</words>  

His watch beeped in sync with another—somewhere, someone else was moving with him. <words>127</words>  

The plan had been vectorized, every step calculated, every movement aligned. <words>143</words>  

Yet, as he stepped forward, the floor beneath him seemed to shift, as if the house itself resisted his passage. <words>164</words>  

Dren smirked, a comfortingly pessimistic thought settling in his mind: nothing ever went as planned. <words>183</words>  

The walls pulsed, their fungal flesh breathing in tandem with his own. <words>197</words>  

He reached for the torn flyer again, trying to recall what it had once advertised. <words>214</words>  

A service? A warning? A promise? <words>220</words>  

The words blurred, shifting like the memories he could no longer trust. <words>234</words>  

The synchronized beep of his watch reminded him to move, to keep the candle alight. <words>252</words>  

Beyond the arched doorway, the void stretched endlessly, a swirling abyss of forgotten things. <words>270</words>  

He stepped forward, the candle’s glow barely pushing back the darkness. <words>285</words>  

Somewhere, another figure did the same, their watches ticking in unison. <words>300</words>  

The windmill outside gave a final creak, its last breath lost to time. <words>315</words>  

Dren’s boots met the threshold, and the void swallowed him whole. <words>329</words>  

The candle wavered, but did not die. <words>338</words>  

Memories twisted, reformed, and unraveled again. <words>351</words>  

He had done this before. <words>358</words>  

Would do it again. <words>364</words>  

The flyer’s torn edge crumbled in his grip, its message lost forever. <words>380</words>  

Yet, the candle remained, flickering defiantly against the void. <words>395</words>  

And so, he walked on. <words>402</words>
