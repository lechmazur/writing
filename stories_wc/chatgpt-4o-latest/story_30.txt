The navigation room of the space pirate vessel *Ebon Tide* flickered with dim, erratic light, the glow of distant stars barely piercing the reinforced glass. <words>20</words>  

Jarek Voss, gambler of fate and fortune, rolled his telekinetic dice across the metal table, their motion guided by unseen forces. <words>40</words>  

Each roll was a whispered secret, a silent negotiation with probability itself. <words>50</words>  

Across from him, Captain Lirian watched with narrowed eyes, her fingers tracing the edge of a fragment of medieval tapestry depicting dragons in flight. <words>74</words>  

“That scrap,” Jarek murmured, “it’s more than decoration, isn’t it?” <words>85</words>  

Lirian smirked, brushing dust from the ancient fabric. <words>93</words>  

“It holds a lost language,” she admitted, “one that speaks of forgotten farming methods.” <words>109</words>  

Jarek leaned forward, intrigued. <words>113</words>  

“Farming?” he echoed, his voice edged with disbelief. <words>121</words>  

Lirian nodded. <words>123</words>  

“Before the stars, before the machines, there were ways to grow food that didn’t strip the land bare.” <words>141</words>  

Jarek considered this, his mind both sharp and philosophically practical. <words>153</words>  

“Why does a pirate captain care about farming?” he asked. <words>164</words>  

Lirian’s gaze darkened. <words>168</words>  

“My family had a tradition,” she said. <words>175</words>  

“For every new member, we planted a tree.” <words>183</words>  

Jarek exhaled slowly, understanding dawning. <words>190</words>  

“You want to preserve what’s left.” <words>197</words>  

Lirian nodded. <words>199</words>  

“The tapestry holds knowledge we’ve lost.” <words>206</words>  

Jarek’s dice hovered midair, trembling. <words>213</words>  

“Then why gamble with it?” he asked. <words>220</words>  

Lirian’s lips curled into a wry smile. <words>228</words>  

“Because knowledge, like fate, must be risked to be won.” <words>238</words>  

Jarek chuckled, appreciating the sacred disorder of it all. <words>248</words>  

He gestured, and the dice tumbled once more. <words>256</words>  

The numbers landed, sealing his wager. <words>263</words>  

Lirian’s fingers tightened on the tapestry. <words>270</words>  

A sudden alarm blared through the ship. <words>278</words>  

“Flame in the engine bay!” a voice crackled over the comms. <words>289</words>  

Lirian cursed, shoving the tapestry into Jarek’s hands. <words>298</words>  

“Keep it safe,” she ordered, before vanishing into the chaos. <words>308</words>  

Jarek stared at the ancient fabric, feeling the weight of lost knowledge in his grip. <words>320</words>  

For the first time in years, he considered a gamble beyond himself. <words>330</words>  

Perhaps, just this once, he would bet on something greater. <words>340</words>
