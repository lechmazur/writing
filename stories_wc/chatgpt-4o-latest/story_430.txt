The reaver sat on a bench in Kaleidoscope Park, his fingers tracing the edges of a crumpled child’s drawing. <words>16</words>  

The paper was soft from too much handling, its colors bleeding into one another like the sky before a storm. <words>33</words>  

He smirked, a charmingly grotesque expression that twisted his scarred face into something almost human. <words>46</words>  

The park shimmered around him, its shifting hues reflecting the restless thoughts in his head. <words>59</words>  

Before the first lie is told, the world is still raw, still waiting to be shaped. <words>72</words>  

He had once believed in that kind of purity, before the cycle had swallowed him whole. <words>86</words>  

A voice nagged at him, not in sound but in ink, scrawled poems in the margins of his mind. <words>101</words>  

They were the same words his father had left him, the same words he had once ignored. <words>115</words>  

Generational patterns were a cruel joke, a wheel that turned whether you wanted it to or not. <words>129</words>  

He had sworn never to become the man who raised him, yet here he was. <words>142</words>  

The drawing in his hands was proof of that, a relic of something he had already lost. <words>157</words>  

A child’s attempt at capturing the stars, their light smeared across the page in frantic strokes. <words>172</words>  

He had promised her once that he would taste the stars in a single kiss. <words>185</words>  

She had laughed, mocking affection in her voice, and told him he was a fool. <words>199</words>  

But fools still dream, even when the world teaches them not to. <words>211</words>  

The reaver clenched the paper, his knuckles whitening as the park’s colors shifted again. <words>225</words>  

The past nagged at him, relentless, whispering in the same ink-stained voice. <words>238</words>  

He had left behind more than he could ever reclaim, but the cycle was not yet complete. <words>253</words>  

The stars still burned, waiting for someone foolish enough to reach for them. <words>266</words>  

He stood, the drawing crumpling further in his grip, and turned toward the horizon. <words>280</words>  

The park twisted around him, its colors deepening, as if urging him forward. <words>293</words>  

Before the first lie is told, there is still a chance to break the pattern. <words>307</words>  

He had spent his life running from ghosts, but perhaps it was time to chase one instead. <words>322</words>  

The reaver smiled again, grotesque and charming, and stepped into the shifting light. <words>335</words>  

The stars had waited long enough. <words>339</words>
