Elara kneaded dough with the same cynically gentle touch she used to handle the pressed flowers her mother had left behind. <words>19</words>  

The bakery smelled of cinnamon and regret, but she had no time to dwell—tonight, the emergency time machine garage would open. <words>38</words>  

She had tracked the moon’s patterns for months, waiting for the moment when shadows would learn to speak. <words>53</words>  

Only then could she plant the seeds of contagion that would unravel the tyrant’s rule. <words>66</words>  

Elara had once believed in kindness, but years under the despot’s grip had taught her that mercy was a luxury. <words>84</words>  

She wiped flour from her hands and retrieved the small tin of pressed flowers from beneath the counter. <words>100</words>  

Each petal held a secret, a whisper of the past encoded in its veins. <words>113</words>  

She had exceeded every expectation placed upon her, learning to read the moon’s language and decipher the tyrant’s weaknesses. <words>132</words>  

The emergency time machine garage was hidden beneath the ruins of an old observatory, its entrance masked by vines and dust. <words>151</words>  

Elara stepped inside, the hum of dormant machinery vibrating beneath her feet. <words>164</words>  

The shadows stirred, their voices curling around her like smoke. <words>176</words>  

“You bring the contagion?” one whispered, its tone neither welcoming nor hostile. <words>189</words>  

Elara held up the tin, her fingers steady despite the weight of her mission. <words>203</words>  

“These flowers carry the spores,” she said. <words>210</words>  

The shadows murmured, shifting along the walls like ink in water. <words>222</words>  

“The tyrant’s breath will spread them,” another shadow intoned. <words>234</words>  

Elara nodded. <words>236</words>  

She had studied his habits, his rituals, his belief in celestial omens. <words>249</words>  

By tracking the moon’s patterns, she had determined the exact night he would seek guidance from the stars. <words>266</words>  

That night, he would inhale the spores, and the seeds of contagion would take root. <words>281</words>  

His mind would fracture, his grip on power dissolving like sugar in rain. <words>294</words>  

The time machine whirred to life, gears grinding against time’s resistance. <words>307</words>  

Elara stepped inside, the pressed flowers clutched to her chest. <words>319</words>  

The shadows coiled around her, whispering their final warnings. <words>331</words>  

She would exceed the limits of history, rewriting the fate of her people. <words>344</words>  

The machine shuddered, light bending as past and present collapsed into one. <words>357</words>  

Elara closed her eyes, breathing in the scent of flour and rebellion. <words>370</words>  

When she opened them, she stood in the tyrant’s chamber, moonlight spilling through the stained-glass windows. <words>387</words>  

The air was thick with incense, masking the delicate scent of the pressed flowers she now scattered. <words>404</words>  

The tyrant inhaled deeply, oblivious to the seeds of his undoing. <words>417</words>  

Elara watched as his expression shifted, confusion blooming into fear. <words>430</words>  

The shadows in the corners of the room began to whisper. <words>442</words>  

And for the first time, the tyrant listened. <words>450</words>
