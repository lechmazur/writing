The nebula observation deck was empty except for Lorne, an urban hermit with a side hustle selling counterfeit star maps. <words>19</words>  

He sat cross-legged on the cold metal floor, analyzing contradictions in local folklore to propagate his latest theory. <words>36</words>  

The myths of the drifting constellations contradicted themselves—some claimed they were the souls of lost travelers, others said they were celestial prisons. <words>55</words>  

Lorne found the inconsistency thrilling, a crack in the rigid structure of accepted truth. <words>67</words>  

He tugged at the broken zipper pull on his jacket, a relic of his past life in the corporate sector. <words>84</words>  

That world had been impersonally personal—colleagues who knew his name but not his dreams, meetings filled with words but devoid of meaning. <words>104</words>  

Now, across the hush of unspoken promises, he sought to forge new paths. <words>116</words>  

The nebula swirled beyond the glass, a cosmic contradiction of chaos and order, much like the folklore he dissected. <words>134</words>  

He had once conformed, once believed in the necessity of structure, but the myths whispered otherwise. <words>150</words>  

If the stars themselves could defy categorization, why couldn’t he? <words>160</words>  

He spread out his notes, scrawled with theories that no one had asked for but that he needed to express. <words>178</words>  

The act of writing them down was both absurd and solemn, a ritual of defiance against the mundane. <words>195</words>  

A security drone hovered nearby, scanning for unauthorized occupants, but Lorne remained still. <words>209</words>  

He had learned to exist in the margins, neither fully seen nor entirely hidden. <words>223</words>  

The myths spoke of a traveler who had escaped the confines of fate by embracing contradiction. <words>238</words>  

Lorne saw himself in that story, a man breaking free from conformity through the very act of questioning it. <words>255</words>  

He traced the jagged edge of the broken zipper pull, a reminder of the life he had shed. <words>271</words>  

The nebula pulsed, as if acknowledging his silent rebellion. <words>282</words>  

He would propagate his findings, not for validation, but because the act itself was liberation. <words>298</words>  

The myths were not meant to be resolved, only explored, much like his own existence. <words>313</words>  

He gathered his notes, ready to distribute them in places where they might be found by others seeking escape. <words>331</words>  

The security drone beeped, but Lorne simply smiled. <words>341</words>  

He had already left the world they wanted him to inhabit. <words>353</words>  

The nebula swirled, and Lorne disappeared into the contradictions he had come to understand. <words>369</words>
