The hush of the barn loft just after sunrise wrapped around Silas like an old coat, worn but familiar. <words>19</words>  

He sat cross-legged on the wooden floor, his battered old skateboard resting beside him, its stickers peeling at the edges. <words>38</words>  

Each decal told a story—relics of places he had been, ideas he had once believed in, and rebellions he had outgrown. <words>58</words>  

Below, the steampunk workshop hummed with the quiet ticking of gears and the occasional hiss of steam escaping from unseen pipes. <words>78</words>  

Silas exhaled slowly, his breath merging with the morning mist that drifted through the open loft window. <words>94</words>  

He had always been faithfully odd, a man who spoke of endings with the serenity of a monk. <words>111</words>  

People called him a doomsayer, but he never shouted his prophecies—he merely stated them, calm as the tide. <words>130</words>  

The world was not ending, not in fire or flood, but in something quieter: the slow decay of movement, the creeping rot of stagnation. <words>153</words>  

That was why he had come here, to this place of gears and steam, to slam a door on the gods of stagnation. <words>175</words>  

He ran a hand over the skateboard’s worn surface, feeling the grooves and scratches, each one a mark of motion, of defiance. <words>196</words>  

The sound of a distant train whistle cut through the morning air, and Silas smiled. <words>209</words>  

It was time. <words>211</words>  

He rose, gripping the skateboard under one arm, and descended the ladder into the workshop below. <words>229</words>  

The space was cluttered with half-built contraptions, brass fittings, and blueprints curling at the edges. <words>244</words>  

At the center stood a machine of his own design, a fusion of steam and steel, of past and future. <words>263</words>  

It was not a weapon, nor a tool of destruction—it was a machine of motion, of escape. <words>280</words>  

He placed the skateboard onto the platform, aligning it with the grooves he had carved into the metal. <words>298</words>  

The train whistle sounded again, closer now, a signal, a summons. <words>311</words>  

Silas took a deep breath and stepped onto the board. <words>322</words>  

With a pull of a lever, the machine roared to life, gears spinning, steam hissing, the scent of oil thick in the air. <words>344</words>  

The platform beneath him shuddered, then launched forward, propelling him through the open doors and into the morning light. <words>365</words>  

For a moment, he was weightless, suspended between past and future, between innocence and knowing. <words>382</words>  

Then the wheels met the earth, and he was moving, faster than he ever had before. <words>398</words>  

The wind tore at his clothes, the world blurred around him, and he laughed—a sound of placid ferocity. <words>417</words>  

He was not running from the end; he was resuming something long forgotten. <words>432</words>  

The gods of stagnation would not have him. <words>441</words>  

The train whistle called once more, and Silas answered, riding toward whatever came next. <words>458</words>
