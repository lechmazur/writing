Jonas drifted through the murky corridors of the forgotten underwater city hall, his boots stirring up clouds of silt. <words>14</words>  

He was a wandering orchardist, but his orchards were not of land—they were of trade, scattered across the multiverse. <words>32</words>  

Each world had its own fruits, its own routes, and Jonas had spent lifetimes mapping them. <words>45</words>  

Now, he sought to reclaim something lost: the wisdom of a vanished people, hidden beneath the waves. <words>61</words>  

His only guide was a collection of dried leaves, brittle pages of a ledger that once recorded the city's commerce. <words>80</words>  

The ink had faded, but Jonas knew that knowledge was never truly gone—it only waited to be touched again. <words>99</words>  

He placed his hand on the table where merchants once bargained, where deals had been sealed with nods and handshakes. <words>120</words>  

A phantom hand, unseen but felt, pressed against his own, and the past surged through him. <words>137</words>  

He gasped as visions unfolded: ships laden with spices, caravans winding through forgotten roads, voices murmuring of fair trades. <words>157</words>  

The wisdom of the kitchen table, the quiet agreements that built empires, whispered their secrets into his bones. <words>176</words>  

Jonas had always been unique, a man who could be trusted to carry knowledge across worlds without corruption. <words>195</words>  

That trust had earned him passage through realms where others would be turned away. <words>210</words>  

But trust was a burden, too, for it meant he could never settle, never claim a home of his own. <words>229</words>  

The phantom hand lingered, urging him to take more, to remember deeper. <words>244</words>  

He saw the city's final days—the flood that swallowed it, the desperate attempts to preserve its wisdom. <words>263</words>  

The merchants had known their time was ending, but they had not fought it; they had prepared. <words>281</words>  

They had left their knowledge in ledgers, in whispered traditions, in the very bones of the city. <words>299</words>  

Jonas understood now: his task was not just to map trade routes, but to carry forward the wisdom behind them. <words>320</words>  

Trade was not just about goods—it was about trust, about the unspoken agreements that bound civilizations together. <words>340</words>  

He withdrew his hand, the phantom touch fading, but the knowledge remained. <words>355</words>  

The dried leaves in his satchel were no longer just records; they were a map of human connection. <words>374</words>  

With bittersweet grit, Jonas turned and ascended toward the surface, the weight of history pressing against his chest. <words>394</words>  

The multiverse was vast, but he would carry this wisdom to every world that would listen. <words>412</words>  

For as long as there were hands to shake and tables to gather around, the wisdom would never be lost. <words>432</words>
