The radio wave garden hummed with invisible currents, a place where signals tangled like overgrown vines. <words>16</words>  

Jonas, a seasoned woodsman, stood among the rusted antennae, his artfully messy beard twitching in the wind. <words>32</words>  

He had spent years mapping abandoned railways, chasing the ghosts of forgotten tracks. <words>44</words>  

Now, he sought the last piece of his puzzle, hidden in the echoes of an old water tower. <words>60</words>  

In his calloused hands, he clutched an antique hairbrush, its silver filigree dulled by time. <words>74</words>  

It had belonged to his mother, the only relic of a past he had tried to forget. <words>90</words>  

The final beep of a hospital monitor still haunted him, the moment he had left her side. <words>106</words>  

She had whispered something then, but he had been too afraid to listen. <words>118</words>  

Now, he stood at the base of the water tower, measuring the echo of his own footsteps. <words>134</words>  

The rusted structure groaned as he climbed, each rung a step deeper into memory. <words>148</words>  

At the top, he placed a small transmitter, its wires tangled like his thoughts. <words>162</words>  

He had rigged it to short-circuit, sending a pulse through the garden’s tangled frequencies. <words>176</words>  

If his calculations were right, the returning signal would reveal the lost railway’s path. <words>190</words>  

The wind howled as he activated the device, the pulse rippling through the air. <words>204</words>  

For a moment, silence. <words>207</words>  

Then, a distorted voice crackled through his receiver—his mother’s voice. <words>219</words>  

“Jonas, you don’t have to run anymore.” <words>225</words>  

His breath caught, the antique hairbrush trembling in his grip. <words>235</words>  

The signal had carried more than echoes; it had carried truth. <words>247</words>  

He had spent his life chasing lost things, but what he truly sought was absolution. <words>263</words>  

Tears blurred his vision as he whispered, “I’m sorry.” <words>273</words>  

The receiver crackled again, softer this time. <words>281</words>  

“You are free, my son.” <words>287</words>  

The final beep of the hospital monitor faded from his mind, replaced by the hum of the garden. <words>305</words>  

Jonas exhaled, the weight of years lifting from his shoulders. <words>317</words>  

He had mapped the railway, but more importantly, he had mapped himself. <words>329</words>  

With a final glance at the tangled antennae, he descended, stepping into a world no longer haunted. <words>347</words>  

The wind carried his mother’s voice away, but the truth remained. <words>359</words>  

Honesty had freed him, and for the first time, he walked forward without looking back. <words>373</words>
