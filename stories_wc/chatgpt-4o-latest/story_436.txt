The apothecary stood at the edge of the exiled fortress, staring down at the endless dunes below. <words>17</words>  
The air shimmered with heat, distorting the horizon like a half-remembered dream. <words>28</words>  
In his trembling hands, he held a plastic spoon, its surface worn from years of use. <words>40</words>  
It was the last remnant of his mother’s kitchen, a relic of family recipes long lost. <words>53</words>  
He had spent years trying to recreate them, but something was always missing. <words>64</words>  
The flavors were close, yet roughly refined, never quite capturing the warmth of home. <words>77</words>  
His mother had whispered that the secret lay in the oracle’s words. <words>87</words>  
But the oracle had fallen silent, retreating into a void of forgotten prophecies. <words>99</words>  
Now, in the final minute before the library shut its doors, he had one last chance. <words>113</words>  
He rushed through the dim corridors, past towering shelves of brittle scrolls. <words>124</words>  
The librarian watched him with weary eyes, already reaching for the great iron key. <words>137</words>  
He reached the oracle’s chamber, where dream catchers swayed in the still air. <words>149</words>  
Each one held fragments of lost wisdom, woven into delicate strands of memory. <words>161</words>  
He had spent years decoding them, searching for the key to the oracle’s silence. <words>174</words>  
Tonight, he would bifurcate the final dream catcher, unraveling its hidden message. <words>186</words>  
His fingers trembled as he pulled at the threads, revealing symbols beneath. <words>198</words>  
The words formed a recipe, one his mother had never written down. <words>209</words>  
Tears blurred his vision as he traced the instructions with the plastic spoon. <words>222</words>  
The oracle stirred, its voice a whisper of wind through ancient stone. <words>233</words>  
“You have remembered,” it murmured, its tone laced with painful joy. <words>244</words>  
The apothecary fell to his knees, clutching the spoon like a sacred relic. <words>256</words>  
He had tempted the oracle to speak again, but at what cost? <words>267</words>  
The fortress trembled, its exile nearing an end as the prophecy unfolded. <words>279</words>  
The scorching desert below seemed to shift, revealing paths long buried. <words>291</words>  
He had found the recipe, but it was more than food—it was a key. <words>303</words>  
A key to return home, to undo the years of sorrow and solitude. <words>315</words>  
The librarian’s voice echoed through the halls. “The library closes now.” <words>326</words>  
The apothecary rose, the plastic spoon still clutched in his hand. <words>337</words>  
He stepped into the desert wind, ready to follow the path revealed. <words>349</words>  
The oracle’s voice faded, but its final words lingered in his heart. <words>361</words>  
“Go, and let the taste of home guide you back.” <words>370</words>  
With painful joy, he walked forward, the fortress dissolving behind him. <words>382</words>  
The desert stretched before him, endless yet full of promise. <words>392</words>  
For the first time in years, he was not lost. <words>401</words>  
He was going home. <words>404</words>
