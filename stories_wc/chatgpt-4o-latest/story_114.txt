The shared dream recording studio hummed with the echoes of forgotten thoughts. <words>10</words>  

Elias, an apathetic summoner, lounged in a chair, spinning a rustic coffee grinder absentmindedly. <words>22</words>  

He was enthusiastically lazy, a contradiction that suited him well. <words>30</words>  

The last breath of a dying god had left the world fractured, its balance undone. <words>42</words>  

Elias had no interest in heroics, but the ocean whispered of coral reefs in ruin. <words>54</words>  

He sighed, stretching his arms before standing with exaggerated sluggishness. <words>62</words>  

The method was clear—he had to unfold the past through matching empty frames. <words>74</words>  

They hung in a deserted hall, remnants of dreams lost to time. <words>84</words>  

Each frame was a portal, a window into memories that had yet to settle. <words>96</words>  

Elias approached the first, brushing dust from its edges. <words>104</words>  

A river shimmered within, its currents carrying whispers of wisdom. <words>114</words>  

He stepped forward, and the water pulled him into its depths. <words>124</words>  

The river spoke in ripples, revealing the coral’s forgotten song. <words>134</words>  

Elias floated, absorbing the knowledge with detached curiosity. <words>144</words>  

The ocean had once thrived, but without the god’s breath, it withered. <words>156</words>  

He surfaced, dripping with understanding, and moved to the next frame. <words>168</words>  

This one showed hands shaping stone, building foundations beneath the waves. <words>180</words>  

Elias smirked—rebuilding required effort, something he avoided. <words>190</words>  

Yet, the river’s wisdom lingered, urging him forward. <words>200</words>  

He turned the handle of the coffee grinder, its rhythmic sound grounding him. <words>212</words>  

The scent of aged beans filled the air, mingling with salt and memory. <words>224</words>  

He placed the grounds into the water, watching them dissolve. <words>234</words>  

The river accepted the offering, swirling with renewed energy. <words>244</words>  

Elias sighed again, stepping into the final frame. <words>254</words>  

Here, coral bloomed in slow motion, unfolding like a forgotten dream. <words>266</words>  

He reached out, fingers grazing the fragile structures. <words>276</words>  

The ocean responded, currents shifting to embrace his presence. <words>286</words>  

He had no grand purpose, no burning passion—only the river’s quiet insistence. <words>298</words>  

With a lazy flick of his wrist, he summoned the first fragments of new coral. <words>310</words>  

They settled into place, guided by unseen hands. <words>320</words>  

The frames behind him faded, their purpose fulfilled. <words>330</words>  

Elias exhaled, the weight of the god’s absence lighter now. <words>340</words>  

He returned to his chair, the coffee grinder still in his grasp. <words>352</words>  

The ocean would heal, slowly, lazily—just like him. <words>362</words>  

And for once, that was enough. <words>368</words>
