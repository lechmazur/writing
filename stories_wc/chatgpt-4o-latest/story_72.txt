The domed vineyard stood alone on the barren alien plain, its glass panels fogged with the breath of forgotten seasons. <words>19</words> The envoy arrived with a sneer, his boots crunching against the brittle soil as he stepped inside. <words>36</words> Vines curled in defiance, their leaves whispering secrets to the stale air. <words>47</words> He was here to find the note, the one that would unravel the paper trails of a dream too fragile to last. <words>66</words>  

Through the swirling leaves in the neglected greenhouse, he sifted with furiously tranquil hands, his mind a storm beneath a placid surface. <words>88</words> The hush of a possibility just born pressed against his ribs, urging him forward. <words>103</words> Somewhere in this ruin lay the folded note, the last trace of a vision that sought to cup starlight in mortal palms. <words>126</words>  

He had once believed in such things—before duty had carved belief from his bones. <words>140</words> Now, he was merely the hand that erased what should never have been written. <words>157</words> The vines clung to his sleeves as if pleading, but he tore free, scattering dust and petals. <words>178</words>  

Then, beneath a fallen trellis, he found it. <words>185</words> The paper was brittle, its edges curled like dying leaves, but the ink remained bold. <words>200</words> He unfolded it with careful fingers, the words within striking like a pulse against his palm. <words>217</words>  

"The stars are not beyond us," it read. <words>225</words> "They wait to be held, to be known, to be ours." <words>237</words>  

A rambling destiny had led him here, to this moment where choice still lingered. <words>253</words> He could destroy the note, as commanded, and let the dream wither. <words>267</words> Or he could leave it, let the paper trail remain, let the hush of possibility breathe. <words>285</words>  

For the first time in years, he hesitated. <words>293</words> The vines rustled, the dome above reflecting the cold light of distant suns. <words>308</words> He clenched the note, his sneer faltering, his purpose unraveling like ink in water. <words>324</words>  

Then, with a breath that tasted of dust and longing, he tucked the note back beneath the trellis. <words>342</words> Let someone else find it. <words>347</words> Let the dream persist. <words>352</words>  

As he stepped out of the greenhouse, the wind carried the scent of something new—something waiting to grow. <words>371</words>
