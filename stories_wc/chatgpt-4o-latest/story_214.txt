The lone trapper sat hunched over a rusted console in the floating observatory, his fingers tracing the edges of a piece of sea glass. <words>22</words>  
It shimmered under the dim emergency lights, a fragment of something lost yet strangely whole. <words>35</words>  
Between shifts, when the station drifted in the void, he decoded microfilm from shady archives, searching for a way to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt. <words>58</words>  
The observatory creaked as it adjusted its orbit, the silence thick with the weight of unseen forces. <words>71</words>  
He had once believed in permanence, in the solidity of things, but loss had taught him otherwise. <words>84</words>  
Now, he listened to the silently audible hum of the cosmos, a sound that pressed against his bones without ever touching his ears. <words>101</words>  
The microfilm reels clicked into place, revealing cryptic diagrams and half-erased equations. <words>113</words>  
He had stolen them from a forgotten archive, a place where knowledge was buried under layers of dust and deception. <words>129</words>  
Each frame held whispers of abandoned theories, blueprints for machines that could bend light and fracture certainty. <words>143</words>  
He ran a calloused thumb over the sea glass, its smooth surface a reminder that even broken things could be reshaped by time. <words>159</words>  
The observatory’s sensors flickered, detecting the gravitational pull of a nearby singularity. <words>171</words>  
He had come here to recommence an experiment long thought impossible—to extract something luminous from the abyss. <words>186</words>  
The equations hinted at a method, a way to harness the event horizon’s energy without being consumed. <words>199</words>  
He adjusted the dials, aligning the station’s instruments with the black hole’s silent roar. <words>211</words>  
The sea glass caught the faint glow of distant stars, refracting light in unexpected directions. <words>224</words>  
He thought of the things he had lost—people, places, pieces of himself scattered like debris in the void. <words>239</words>  
Yet here he was, still shaping meaning from the wreckage. <words>247</words>  
The observatory trembled as the machinery engaged, siphoning a sliver of radiance from the darkness. <words>260</words>  
For a moment, the station was bathed in an eerie glow, neither day nor night, but something in between. <words>275</words>  
He exhaled, watching the light dance across the sea glass, proof that even the void could yield something beautiful. <words>290</words>  
The microfilm’s final frame revealed a single phrase, scrawled in a hand he almost recognized: “Loss is not the end.” <words>305</words>  
He let the words settle, their weight neither crushing nor freeing, but simply there. <words>317</words>  
The station’s systems stabilized, the siphoned radiance stored for future use. <words>328</words>  
He placed the sea glass beside the console, a talisman of transformation. <words>340</words>  
Outside, the black hole remained, vast and indifferent, but no longer entirely unknowable. <words>353</words>  
He had taken something from it, and in doing so, had reclaimed something of himself. <words>366</words>  
The observatory drifted onward, and the lone trapper, for the first time in years, allowed himself to believe in the upside of loss. <words>386</words>
