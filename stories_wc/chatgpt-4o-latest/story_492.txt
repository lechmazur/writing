The escalator had frozen mid-ascent, its rusted gears locked in a silent snarl. <words>14</words>  

Juno exhaled sharply, adjusting the weight of the blacksmith’s tools slung across his back. <words>27</words>  

The cyberpunk city pulsed beyond the alley, neon veins threading through the smog-choked skyline. <words>39</words>  

He should have been working—tinkering, inventing, losing himself in the hum of creation. <words>51</words>  

Instead, he was here, infiltrating the underbelly of the city via interconnected trails. <words>63</words>  

Juno had never been a hero, nor a revolutionary—just a man too distracted to refuse. <words>76</words>  

But the fractured illusions of this place needed gathering, needed forging into something bright. <words>89</words>  

And somehow, he had become the reluctant catalyst. <words>95</words>  

A figure emerged from the shadows, eyes glinting like polished steel. <words>105</words>  

“You’re late,” the woman said, voice edged with impatience. <words>114</words>  

Juno shrugged, tapping the rusted railing of the broken escalator. <words>124</words>  

“Time’s a funny thing when the world stands still,” he muttered. <words>134</words>  

She scoffed but gestured for him to follow. <words>142</words>  

They moved through the alley, past flickering holo-signs and the scent of burnt circuitry. <words>154</words>  

Juno’s mind wandered, cataloging the decay, the potential hidden in the wreckage. <words>165</words>  

He was normally weird—too lost in thought, too tangled in ideas. <words>176</words>  

But here, in this moment, his oddity had purpose. <words>185</words>  

They reached a rusted door, its surface etched with forgotten symbols. <words>195</words>  

The woman knocked twice, then pressed her palm against a biometric scanner. <words>206</words>  

The lock clicked, and the door yawned open. <words>214</words>  

Inside, the air was thick with heat and desperation. <words>223</words>  

Scattered across the room were remnants of broken tech, shattered dreams waiting for rebirth. <words>236</words>  

Juno unslung the blacksmith’s tools, fingers tracing their worn handles. <words>246</words>  

“These aren’t just relics,” he murmured. <words>252</words>  

The woman crossed her arms. “Then prove it.” <words>260</words>  

Juno knelt, selecting a twisted fragment of circuitry. <words>269</words>  

With ruthless kindness, he began to work. <words>276</words>  

Sparks danced as metal met metal, as broken things found new purpose. <words>287</words>  

The others watched, hope flickering in their tired eyes. <words>296</words>  

Juno had never wanted to be the one to start this. <words>307</words>  

But sometimes, the world needed a distracted inventor to forge its future. <words>319</words>  

And so, he did. <words>323</words>
