The biodome’s artificial sun flickered as Callum stretched his arms, his breath fogging in the controlled air. <words>16</words>  

He had been running for months, slipping through legal cracks like water through fractured stone. <words>28</words>  

A trickster lawyer turned fugitive, he had once manipulated the law with a silver tongue. <words>40</words>  

Now, he used that same cunning to stay ahead of those who wanted him silenced. <words>54</words>  

The biodome farm was his latest refuge, a place where engineered crops grew in sterile soil. <words>68</words>  

Rows of luminous wheat swayed under the artificial breeze, their glow casting eerie shadows. <words>81</words>  

Callum exhaled, his impatience gnawing at him even as he forced himself to wait. <words>94</words>  

He was impatiently patient—always restless, yet knowing when to bide his time. <words>106</words>  

A crumpled gift tag lay in his palm, the last remnant of a message. <words>119</words>  

It had arrived with no gift, only a scrawled dare from an old rival. <words>132</words>  

"Find the lost tongues before they vanish forever," it read in jagged ink. <words>144</words>  

Cryptic dares had guided him here, each one leading him deeper into obscurity. <words>157</words>  

His high school rivals had always played games, but this was something else. <words>170</words>  

They knew his obsession—cataloguing disappearing languages, preserving voices before they faded. <words>183</words>  

But why push him toward this farm, this place of sterile perfection? <words>195</words>  

A rustling in the wheat made him turn, his pulse quickening. <words>206</words>  

A figure emerged, draped in a cloak woven from biofiber strands. <words>218</words>  

"You took the dare," the figure said, voice hollow yet familiar. <words>230</words>  

Callum’s mind raced, recalling a debate club rival from years past. <words>242</words>  

"Why send me here?" he asked, fingers tightening around the gift tag. <words>255</words>  

The figure gestured toward the crops, their glow pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>268</words>  

"They engineered these plants to absorb sound," they murmured. <words>278</words>  

"Every whispered word, every dying language—it’s all trapped in them." <words>291</words>  

Callum’s breath hitched as he stepped closer, realization dawning. <words>303</words>  

The farm wasn’t just growing food; it was harvesting voices. <words>315</words>  

He reached out, brushing a stalk, and a whisper curled into his ear. <words>328</words>  

A language he didn’t recognize, soft and pleading, lost yet alive. <words>340</words>  

His path had always been chosen by wit, by escape, by diversion. <words>353</words>  

But now, he had to decide—run again or stay and unearth the truth. <words>366</words>  

The gift tag crumpled in his fist as he made his choice. <words>378</words>  

For the first time, he wouldn’t divert. <words>384</words>  

He would listen. <words>387</words>
