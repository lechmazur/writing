The wind howled over the mysterious mountain peak, carrying whispers of forgotten truths. <words>12</words>  

Elias adjusted his coat, the weight of the baseball in his pocket grounding him. <words>23</words>  

It was signed by a time traveler—proof that the past and future were not fixed. <words>35</words>  

He had spent years chasing fragments of his identity, a twin separated at birth. <words>47</words>  

Now, he had hired actors to play versions of himself, testing their mannerisms. <words>59</words>  

If he could see himself reflected in another, perhaps he could find the truth. <words>71</words>  

The clandestine meeting was set in a hidden cave beneath the peak’s jagged cliffs. <words>83</words>  

The actors waited inside, their faces flickering in the dim lantern light. <words>94</words>  

Each had been given a script—memories Elias barely remembered, rewritten as dialogue. <words>106</words>  

Outside, the farmers market bustled in the valley below, oblivious to his search. <words>118</words>  

He descended into the cave, the air thick with damp stone and secrecy. <words>129</words>  

The first actor stepped forward, mimicking a childhood story Elias had recounted. <words>141</words>  

But something was off—his voice lacked the weight of forgotten sorrow. <words>152</words>  

The second actor tried, his gestures eerily familiar, but still, something was missing. <words>165</words>  

Elias clenched the baseball, its signature glowing faintly under the lantern’s flicker. <words>177</words>  

The time traveler had warned him: some knowledge was forbidden for a reason. <words>189</words>  

A shadow moved at the cave’s entrance, and Elias turned sharply. <words>199</words>  

A figure emerged, identical to him in every way—his twin. <words>209</words>  

"You shouldn’t have come here," the twin said, voice laced with warning. <words>221</words>  

Elias stepped back, heart pounding. "I needed to know who I am." <words>233</words>  

His twin sighed. "Some truths are better left buried beneath the mountain." <words>245</words>  

The actors exchanged nervous glances, sensing the weight of the moment. <words>256</words>  

Elias tightened his grip on the baseball, feeling time ripple around him. <words>268</words>  

The prophecy had foretold an apocalypse, but only one of them could survive it. <words>281</words>  

His twin lunged, and Elias barely dodged, the cave walls trembling. <words>292</words>  

The actors scattered as the brothers clashed, shadows dancing like crystal shards. <words>304</words>  

Elias had to subdue him—there was no other way. <words>312</words>  

He swung the baseball, striking his twin’s temple, time distorting on impact. <words>324</words>  

His twin collapsed, gasping. "You don’t understand what you’ve done." <words>335</words>  

Elias knelt beside him, realization dawning. "I was never meant to exist, was I?" <words>349</words>  

His twin’s breath shuddered. "You were the forbidden knowledge." <words>358</words>  

The mountain groaned, the prophecy unraveling as Elias stood alone. <words>369</words>  

The baseball’s signature faded, time sealing itself once more. <words>379</words>  

Elias stepped out of the cave, the farmers market still bustling below. <words>391</words>  

He had outlived the prophecy, but at what cost? <words>400</words>
