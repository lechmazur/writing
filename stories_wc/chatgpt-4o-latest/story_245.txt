Jace ran laps around the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his breath sharp in the cold air. <words>14</words>  

The rhythmic pounding of his boots echoed through the empty expanse, a ghost of past departures. <words>27</words>  

He wasn’t here for nostalgia—he was here for answers. <words>34</words>  

A single chopstick, tucked into his belt, pressed against his side as he moved. <words>46</words>  

It was all he had left of his brother, a relic of their last job together. <words>59</words>  

Smuggling was never clean, but that run had been a disaster. <words>68</words>  

Now, Jace was alone, his heart a clenched fist of fury and regret. <words>80</words>  

He stopped near a rusted cargo loader, sweat cooling on his skin. <words>91</words>  

The chopstick felt heavier than it should, as if it carried the weight of his failure. <words>105</words>  

He pulled a thermos from his pack, pouring tea into a dented metal cup. <words>117</words>  

The steam curled upward, twisting into patterns that only he could decipher. <words>129</words>  

Jace had learned this method from an old trader—reading the heart’s revolt through tea leaves. <words>143</words>  

He swirled the liquid, watching the shapes form and dissolve. <words>153</words>  

A jagged line, a broken path, a waterfall hidden in the chaos. <words>164</words>  

His pulse quickened. <words>166</words>  

The waterfalls were real. <words>169</words>  

His brother had spoken of them, a place beyond the mapped stars. <words>181</words>  

Jace had dismissed it as a dream, but now the tea told him otherwise. <words>194</words>  

He clenched the chopstick, his grip turning his knuckles white. <words>204</words>  

His brother had died chasing that dream, and Jace had sworn to forget it. <words>217</words>  

But the heart revolts against silence, against denial. <words>226</words>  

He had spent too long running in circles, trapped in his own bitterness. <words>238</words>  

The patterns in the tea whispered a different path. <words>247</words>  

Jace exhaled sharply, his decision solidifying like cooling metal. <words>258</words>  

He would find the waterfalls. <words>261</words>  

Not for redemption, not for closure—just because his heart demanded it. <words>273</words>  

He stood, the chopstick still in his hand, a symbol of what was lost. <words>286</words>  

But also of what could still be found. <words>292</words>  

The spaceport was dead, but he was not. <words>300</words>  

Jace turned toward the horizon, where the stars waited. <words>310</words>  

His boots struck the deck with renewed purpose as he jogged toward his ship. <words>323</words>  

The past would not hold him here any longer. <words>332</words>  

He would memorialize his brother not with grief, but with discovery. <words>344</words>  

The waterfalls were out there, hidden beyond the known. <words>354</words>  

And Jace would find them, no matter the cost. <words>362</words>
