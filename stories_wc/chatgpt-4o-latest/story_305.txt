The scholar stood at the edge of the flooded opera house, lantern light dancing across the water’s surface. <words>16</words>  

He adjusted his spectacles, the weight of the ancient clay tablet pressing against his palm. <words>29</words>  

The runes carved into its surface whispered of forgotten voices, a gathering of echoes trapped in time. <words>42</words>  

He had spent years deciphering them, his reticence mistaken for indifference by those who sought quicker answers. <words>56</words>  

But knowledge, he believed, was not to be rushed—it was to be courted, unraveled with care. <words>69</words>  

A knock echoed through the cavernous space, reverberating against the waterlogged walls. <words>80</words>  

He tensed, fingers tightening around the tablet, knowing that discovery was inevitable. <words>91</words>  

The sketches hidden in the binding of his vintage dictionary had led him here, each line a breadcrumb. <words>105</words>  

They had been left by another mind, one equally mischievous in its technical precision. <words>117</words>  

A mind that had understood the weight of complacency and sought to dethrone it. <words>129</words>  

He waded forward, the cold water lapping at his knees, the lanterns flickering uncertainly. <words>141</words>  

The opera house had once been grand, its balconies filled with rapturous applause. <words>152</words>  

Now, it was a hushed cathedral of ruin, where echoes gathered in solemn congress. <words>165</words>  

He reached the stage, where a single table stood, a cake half-baked in its tin. <words>178</words>  

The scent of vanilla and damp wood mingled in the air, an oddly domestic contrast. <words>190</words>  

He placed the tablet beside the cake, its runes catching the lantern’s glow. <words>202</words>  

The knock came again, more insistent this time, and he exhaled, steadying himself. <words>214</words>  

He had not come this far to falter now, not when the echoes were listening. <words>226</words>  

A figure emerged from the shadows, their coat dripping, their eyes sharp with recognition. <words>239</words>  

“You found it,” they murmured, gaze flicking to the tablet, then to him. <words>250</words>  

He nodded, his silence speaking volumes, his mind already calculating the next step. <words>263</words>  

The runes had hinted at something beyond mere history—a shift, a reckoning. <words>275</words>  

The scholar had no interest in power, only in the dismantling of stagnation. <words>287</words>  

The figure reached into their coat, producing a worn notebook filled with sketches. <words>299</words>  

They flipped to a page where the opera house was drawn in meticulous detail. <words>311</words>  

At its center, the tablet rested, surrounded by symbols that pulsed with intent. <words>323</words>  

“The echoes are waiting,” the figure said, voice laced with pensive mirth. <words>334</words>  

The scholar allowed himself the smallest of smiles, then reached for the cake. <words>346</words>  

If they were to rewrite history, they might as well do it over dessert. <words>358</words>
