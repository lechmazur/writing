The found object museum smelled of rust and forgotten stories. <words>10</words>  

Dust swirled in the dim light as Felix traced his fingers over an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt. <words>24</words>  

It had once belonged to a duelist who fought for honor, but now it was just another relic. <words>36</words>  

Felix, a careful poisoner by trade, had come here for something far more delicate than steel. <words>49</words>  

A scavenger hunt had been arranged, a trail of cryptic clues hidden among the exhibits. <words>60</words>  

Each clue led deeper into the museum’s labyrinthine halls, where forgotten artifacts whispered secrets. <words>72</words>  

He was here to authenticate the final clue, to prove his instincts were sharper than any blade. <words>85</words>  

Outside, the sound of skateboarding echoed through the alley, wheels scraping against concrete. <words>96</words>  

Felix had always admired skaters—the way they tested the edges of gravity, defying limits. <words>109</words>  

It was a philosophy he understood well, though his own tests were far more lethal. <words>121</words>  

He moved with precision, his every step dictated by a code of instinct honed over years. <words>134</words>  

The next clue was hidden beneath a glass case displaying a collection of antique keys. <words>146</words>  

He lifted the case carefully, his hands steady, his breath slow. <words>156</words>  

A folded note lay beneath, inked in a hand he recognized. <words>166</words>  

"Innocently guilty," it read, a phrase that sent a shiver down his spine. <words>178</words>  

It was a message meant for him alone, a reminder of the delicate balance he walked. <words>191</words>  

Felix had never been caught, never been accused, yet guilt clung to him like dust. <words>204</words>  

He unfolded the next clue, its words leading him toward the museum’s upper level. <words>216</words>  

The stairs creaked beneath his weight, the air thick with the scent of aged paper. <words>228</words>  

At the top, a skylight bathed the room in dusty starlight, casting long shadows. <words>240</words>  

There, resting on a pedestal, was the final object—a vial of liquid, dark and shimmering. <words>253</words>  

Felix reached for it, his fingers brushing the glass, his pulse steady. <words>264</words>  

This was the test, the culmination of the hunt, the proof of his mastery. <words>276</words>  

He uncorked the vial, inhaling the faintest trace of bitterness. <words>286</words>  

A perfect poison, undetectable, lethal in the right hands. <words>294</words>  

He had passed the test, authenticated his skill, and yet— <words>303</words>  

Outside, a skater launched into the air, twisting, weightless for a moment. <words>314</words>  

Felix watched, mesmerized, as the skater landed, rolling away into the night. <words>326</words>  

For a second, he envied that freedom, that defiance of gravity without consequence. <words>338</words>  

Then he slipped the vial into his pocket and disappeared into the shadows. <words>349</words>
