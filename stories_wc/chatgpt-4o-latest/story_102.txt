The map projection room lay in eerie silence, the hush after the wind no longer howled. <words>19</words>  

Dorian, a spineless mercenary, traced his fingers over the glowing outlines of forgotten trails. <words>32</words>  

He had been hired not for his courage, but for his ability to disappear when things turned dire. <words>47</words>  

Yet now, he held a Victorian dollhouse key, its grandly trivial design at odds with the weight of his task. <words>64</words>  

The key was said to unlock something beyond the known world, an uncharted horizon hidden in prophecy. <words>78</words>  

That prophecy had been spoken in code, whispered by a dying oracle whose words still haunted him. <words>92</words>  

Dorian had no love for riddles, but he had been paid handsomely to hush the prophecy forever. <words>106</words>  

His employer, a shadowy figure known only as the Cartographer, had left him with a single instruction. <words>121</words>  

"Find the door that fits the key, and ensure no one else ever does." <words>132</words>  

The map before him shimmered, revealing paths long erased from history, leading to places men feared to tread. <words>147</words>  

He hesitated, doubt luminous in his mindâ€”was he truly meant to silence something so vast? <words>161</words>  

A voice interrupted his thoughts, low and knowing. <words>167</words>  

"You hesitate, Dorian," said the Mentor, a figure who had trained him in the art of vanishing. <words>182</words>  

The Mentor stepped forward, his presence both reassuring and damning. <words>191</words>  

"You were never meant to be a hero, only a shadow passing through forgotten trails." <words>205</words>  

Dorian clenched the key, its ornate metal biting into his palm. <words>215</words>  

"What if this prophecy is meant to be heard?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>229</words>  

The Mentor sighed, his expression unreadable. <words>235</words>  

"Then you must decide whether you are the man to let it speak." <words>247</words>  

Dorian turned back to the map, tracing a path toward the unknown. <words>258</words>  

The door he sought lay beyond the last marked boundary, where the world fell away into speculation. <words>273</words>  

He had spent his life avoiding decisions, but now, standing at the edge of an uncharted horizon, he had no choice. <words>291</words>  

With a deep breath, he stepped forward, the key warm in his grip. <words>303</words>  

The Mentor watched, saying nothing, as Dorian vanished into the silence. <words>314</words>  

The map flickered, the forgotten trails shifting as if acknowledging his passage. <words>326</words>  

Somewhere, the prophecy stirred, waiting to be either silenced or set free. <words>338</words>  

And for the first time in his life, Dorian did not turn back. <words>349</words>
