The unstable dimension rippled around Orin as he clutched the brass compass, its needle spinning wildly. <words>14</words>  

He had spent lifetimes searching for forgotten places, guided only by heartbreak-induced visions. <words>26</words>  

Each vision shattered him, yet he recomposed himself with a desperately casual air. <words>37</words>  

He had no choice—his mind was a vault of facts, but his heart was a ruin. <words>50</words>  

The latest vision had come in the cradle of a whispered minute, fleeting yet searing. <words>63</words>  

A lost city, veiled in sorrow, had called to him through the fractures of time. <words>75</words>  

The compass trembled in his palm, aligning not to direction but to emotion. <words>86</words>  

Orin exhaled sharply, forcing himself to analyze rather than feel. <words>95</words>  

Empathy was a path he had never walked, only observed from a distance. <words>107</words>  

Yet the visions demanded more than knowledge—they required understanding. <words>117</words>  

The dimension around him wavered, its instability mirroring his own uncertainty. <words>129</words>  

He stepped forward, the ground shifting beneath his feet like liquid memory. <words>140</words>  

The city emerged, its structures half-formed, flickering between existence and oblivion. <words>152</words>  

He saw echoes of lives once lived—laughter, sorrow, love—all suspended in time. <words>164</words>  

His fact-minded nature cataloged details, but his heart ached with recognition. <words>175</words>  

This place had been forgotten not by accident, but by grief too great to bear. <words>188</words>  

The compass pulsed, urging him deeper into the city's fractured heart. <words>199</words>  

He followed, his steps measured, his mind racing. <words>206</words>  

A figure emerged—a woman, translucent, her eyes filled with unspoken loss. <words>218</words>  

"You seek forgotten places," she whispered, her voice threading through the air. <words>230</words>  

Orin nodded, his throat tight. <words>235</words>  

"Then you must remember what was lost," she said, touching his forehead. <words>247</words>  

A vision consumed him—love abandoned, promises broken, a city mourning itself. <words>259</words>  

He gasped, the weight of sorrow pressing against his ribs. <words>269</words>  

For the first time, he did not merely observe—he felt. <words>278</words>  

The city solidified, its structures stabilizing as his understanding deepened. <words>289</words>  

Empathy was not a path of logic, but of shared pain and healing. <words>301</words>  

The woman smiled, her form growing more tangible. <words>309</words>  

"You have found us," she murmured, and the city exhaled in relief. <words>321</words>  

Orin looked at the compass—it no longer spun aimlessly. <words>331</words>  

It pointed forward, steady, guiding him not to places, but to people. <words>343</words>  

He had spent lifetimes searching for forgotten places. <words>350</words>  

Now, he understood—what was lost was never truly gone. <words>361</words>  

It only waited to be remembered. <words>366</words>
