The gnarled forest village clung to twisted branches, its homes woven from roots and shadow. <words>14</words>  

Here, beneath a sky choked with mist, the soothsayer worked. <words>24</words>  

He was a man of dreadful hope, his visions neither salvation nor doom, but something in between. <words>38</words>  

His garments were lavishly humble—embroidered with gold yet frayed at the edges. <words>49</words>  

In his hands, he held a blacksmith’s hammer, though he had never forged iron. <words>62</words>  

Instead, he manufactured miracles. <words>65</words>  

Not through divine will, nor through trickery, but by the echo of a long-forgotten song. <words>78</words>  

The melody drifted through the hush of memory’s corridors, a whisper of something ancient. <words>91</words>  

Each strike of the hammer against unseen anvils shaped the impossible into existence. <words>103</words>  

A blind child saw again. <words>107</words>  

A withered tree bore fruit. <words>111</words>  

A dying man breathed anew. <words>115</words>  

Yet the soothsayer did not seek gratitude. <words>120</words>  

He sought to become a force of nature. <words>126</words>  

Not a man, not a prophet, but something elemental, something eternal. <words>136</words>  

The villagers feared him, though they never spoke of it aloud. <words>146</words>  

They came to him with trembling hands, offering prayers he did not need. <words>158</words>  

He accepted them with a nod, his eyes fixed on something beyond sight. <words>170</words>  

One night, a woman arrived, her face lined with sorrow. <words>180</words>  

She carried a bundle wrapped in cloth, silent and still. <words>190</words>  

“My son,” she whispered. <words>193</words>  

The soothsayer unwrapped the child, his skin cold as river stones. <words>204</words>  

The mother’s tears fell onto the boy’s lifeless cheek. <words>214</words>  

The soothsayer lifted his hammer. <words>218</words>  

The song stirred, faint at first, then rising like wind through hollow bones. <words>230</words>  

He struck the air, and the sound rippled through the village. <words>241</words>  

The branches trembled. <words>244</words>  

The mist thickened. <words>247</words>  

The boy gasped. <words>250</words>  

His eyes fluttered open, reflecting something vast and unknowable. <words>261</words>  

The mother sobbed, clutching her son, but the soothsayer did not smile. <words>273</words>  

He saw what lay beneath the miracle. <words>280</words>  

The boy’s breath was borrowed, his heartbeat an echo. <words>290</words>  

The village would pay for this. <words>295</words>  

Not today, not tomorrow, but across the hush of memory’s corridors. <words>307</words>  

The soothsayer turned away, his hammer heavy in his grasp. <words>318</words>  

He had shaped the impossible once more, but at what cost? <words>329</words>  

The song faded, leaving only silence. <words>336</words>  

And in that silence, something waited. <words>342</words>  

Something patient. <words>344</words>  

Something hungry. <words>346</words>  

The village did not yet understand. <words>351</words>  

But the soothsayer did. <words>355</words>  

And he knew that one day, the forest would take back what had been given. <words>368</words>  

For miracles were never free. <words>373</words>  

And neither was he. <words>377</words>
