The assassin moved like ink spilled on silk, silent and inevitable. <words>10</words>  

He had studied the pattern of a butterfly’s wings, knowing that the smallest shift could change the course of history. <words>28</words>  

Tonight, he would not kill with a blade but with a whisper. <words>37</words>  

The ancient Chinese palace loomed ahead, its golden eaves catching the moonlight like dragon’s teeth. <words>50</words>  

Inside, the Emperor’s council debated, their voices rising and falling like waves against stone. <words>63</words>  

He slipped past the guards, his presence as unnoticed as a forgotten dream. <words>74</words>  

In his hands, he carried a botanical press, its wooden frame worn smooth by time. <words>87</words>  

It was an odd tool for an assassin, but tonight, it was his weapon. <words>99</words>  

He had pressed a single flower within its pages—a rare orchid, steeped in poison. <words>112</words>  

The Emperor’s tea would be infused with its essence, a death as delicate as perfume. <words>125</words>  

Yet, as he moved through the palace, he heard whispers of longing. <words>136</words>  

Not voices, but the sighs of the walls, the breath of history itself. <words>148</words>  

They spoke of futures unwritten, of destinies waiting to be spun into raw possibility. <words>161</words>  

He paused, amused by the irony—he was a man of endings, not beginnings. <words>174</words>  

Still, the whispers persisted, urging him to amalgamate fate with choice. <words>185</words>  

He reached the Emperor’s chamber, where a single candle flickered in the dark. <words>197</words>  

The Emperor sat alone, staring at a scroll filled with unanswered questions. <words>209</words>  

Before the first question could be asked, the assassin acted. <words>218</words>  

He placed the botanical press on the table, its presence both innocent and damning. <words>231</words>  

The Emperor looked up, his eyes sharp with recognition. <words>240</words>  

“You are here to kill me,” he said, his tone more amused than afraid. <words>253</words>  

The assassin smiled, a rare expression. <words>259</words>  

“I am here to change the course of history,” he replied. <words>269</words>  

The Emperor gestured to the press. <words>274</words>  

“And this?” <words>276</words>  

“A lesson in patience,” the assassin said. <words>282</words>  

He opened the press, revealing the orchid, its petals dark with poison. <words>294</words>  

“But also a choice.” <words>298</words>  

The Emperor studied the flower, understanding dawning in his eyes. <words>308</words>  

“To drink or not to drink?” he mused. <words>315</words>  

The assassin nodded. <words>318</words>  

“By the pattern of a butterfly’s wings, even hesitation can reshape destiny.” <words>331</words>  

The Emperor laughed, a sound of humorous unease. <words>340</words>  

“You are a figuratively literal man,” he said. <words>348</words>  

The assassin inclined his head. <words>352</words>  

“And you are an Emperor who understands the weight of whispers.” <words>363</words>  

The candle flickered again, casting shadows that danced like fate itself. <words>375</words>  

The Emperor reached for the tea, then stopped. <words>382</words>  

He pushed it aside. <words>386</words>  

“Tell me,” he said, “what future do you see?” <words>396</words>  

The assassin smiled once more. <words>401</words>  

“One where the first question is never asked.” <words>409</words>  

And with that, he vanished into the night. <words>416</words>
