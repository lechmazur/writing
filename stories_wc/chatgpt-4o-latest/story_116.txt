The minstrel slumped in the corner of the black velvet sky-lounge, plucking absentmindedly at his lute while the city stretched endlessly below. <words>19</words>  

His broken watch band lay beside him, a useless relic of time in a place where night never ended. <words>34</words>  

He had come here to draw a map of the endless night, though the task felt increasingly absurd. <words>48</words>  

Still, he persisted, excavating meaning from the past by studying old Polaroid photographs scattered across the table. <words>63</words>  

Each image captured a fragment of the city’s secrets—gardens hidden behind iron gates, alleyways swallowed by neon haze. <words>78</words>  

He traced the edges of each photograph, searching for patterns, for boundaries that might define the undefinable. <words>92</words>  

His mind, subjectively rational, insisted that even infinity must have its limits. <words>103</words>  

A bartender, dressed in midnight silk, refilled his glass without a word, their expression unreadable. <words>116</words>  

The minstrel sighed, his fingers tightening around the neck of his lute. <words>127</words>  

He had once believed music could chart the unknown, but melodies dissolved in the vastness of this place. <words>142</words>  

A photograph caught his eye—an overgrown courtyard, vines curling around a forgotten fountain. <words>154</words>  

He recognized it from a song he had written long ago, before he lost his way. <words>167</words>  

The realization sent a shiver through him; perhaps the city was not endless, only unremembered. <words>181</words>  

He picked up his pen and began sketching, drawing lines where memory and intuition guided him. <words>194</words>  

Boundaries emerged—some real, some imagined, but all necessary. <words>203</words>  

A woman in a silver mask approached, watching him with quiet amusement. <words>214</words>  

“You map the night as if it can be tamed,” she murmured. <words>225</words>  

He smirked, his laconic exuberance masking his doubt. <words>234</words>  

“Even the wildest songs have structure,” he replied. <words>243</words>  

She tapped the broken watch band on the table. <words>252</words>  

“Time is meaningless here, yet you still measure.” <words>261</words>  

He shrugged. “Boundaries give meaning, even if they’re illusions.” <words>272</words>  

She considered this, then placed a Polaroid before him. <words>283</words>  

It showed a door, half-hidden in shadow. <words>292</words>  

His pulse quickened—he had never seen it, yet he knew it. <words>305</words>  

The woman leaned in. “Some maps lead home.” <words>314</words>  

He hesitated, then added the door to his sketch. <words>325</words>  

The city shifted, the sky-lounge trembling as if acknowledging his work. <words>338</words>  

For the first time in years, the minstrel felt something close to hope. <words>351</words>  

He gathered his photographs, his map, and his broken watch band. <words>364</words>  

Then, with a final glance at the endless city, he stepped toward the door. <words>377</words>  

The night would always be vast, but now, at least, it had direction. <words>389</words>
