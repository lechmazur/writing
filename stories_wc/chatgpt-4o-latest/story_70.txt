The witch’s greenhouse clung to the hill of gravestones like a stubborn memory, its glass panes fogged with the breath of forgotten things. <words>19</words>  

Inside, Elias Whitmore, an uptight scribe with ink-stained fingers, hunched over a wooden table, his pulse a metronome of certainty and doubt. <words>38</words>  

He had spent years chronicling the world’s truths, yet here he was, analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope, searching for something unspoken. <words>61</words>  

The letter had arrived without a sender, its contents a riddle wrapped in the scent of old parchment and regret. <words>79</words>  

It spoke of a prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop, hidden beneath roots that drank from the dead. <words>97</words>  

Elias had scoffed at first, but the words gnawed at him, their weight pressing against the steel bars of his reason. <words>118</words>  

Now, in the dim glow of the greenhouse, he traced the brittle seal with a trembling fingertip, his certainty unraveling thread by thread. <words>140</words>  

The witch, a woman with eyes like storm-lit glass, watched him from the shadows, her silence a question he could not answer. <words>161</words>  

“You seek something,” she murmured, her voice a whisper of wind through hollow bones. <words>174</words>  

Elias exhaled sharply. “I seek understanding.” <words>185</words>  

She tilted her head, considering him as one might a bird too proud to admit its wings were broken. <words>204</words>  

“Then dig,” she said, gesturing toward the graves beyond the glass. <words>218</words>  

The earth was damp beneath his fingers, the scent of decay and renewal mingling as he unearthed the object of his search. <words>239</words>  

The bulb, delicate yet unyielding, pulsed faintly in his palm, as if remembering the hands that had shaped it. <words>259</words>  

A puzzle piece clicked into place within him, a quiet transformation stirring in the marrow of his being. <words>278</words>  

He had spent his life believing knowledge was a fortress, but here, in the witch’s greenhouse, he saw its walls crumble. <words>299</words>  

Truth was not a thing to be caged—it was light, fragile yet persistent, demanding to be cradled in arms of steel. <words>320</words>  

The realization struck him so fiercely that he bellowed, the sound raw and unguarded, shattering the hush of the night. <words>340</words>  

The witch did not flinch. Instead, she smiled, a buried optimism flickering in the depths of her gaze. <words>358</words>  

“Certainly uncertain,” she mused, as if naming the shape of his soul. <words>372</words>  

Elias looked at the bulb, its glow steady despite the tremor in his hands. <words>388</words>  

For the first time, he did not fear the unknown. <words>400</words>
