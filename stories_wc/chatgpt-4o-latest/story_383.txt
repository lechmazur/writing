General Elias Kane slumped into the cracked leather booth of the Dark Matter Diner, the neon sign outside flickering like a dying star. <words>19</words> He exhaled, watching the steam curl from his untouched coffee, his fingers tracing the edges of a brittle sheet of dried seaweed. <words>38</words> The war had ended, but the battles in his mind raged on, looping like an old film reel. <words>53</words>  

Across from him, a woman in a trench coat spread black-and-white photographs across the table in careful arcs. <words>68</words> "You still collecting ghosts, Mara?" Kane asked, his voice rough with exhaustion. <words>80</words>  

Mara smirked, tapping a photo of a faceless soldier. <words>89</words> "Not ghosts—anxieties," she corrected. <words>94</words> "We all carry them, but we pretend they belong to someone else." <words>106</words>  

Kane picked up a photograph of a crumbling cityscape, the shadows stretching unnaturally long. <words>118</words> "And what do you do with them?" he asked. <words>127</words>  

"I renew them," Mara said, flipping another image over. <words>136</words> "Turn them into something useful before they rot into fear." <words>147</words>  

Kane chuckled, shaking his head. <words>152</words> "Rationally absurd," he muttered. <words>156</words>  

"Like you," Mara shot back, grinning. <words>162</words>  

He sighed, rubbing his temples. <words>167</words> "Fear sits on the throne of reason, and we let it rule," he admitted. <words>180</words>  

Mara leaned forward, her voice low. <words>186</words> "Then dethrone it." <words>189</words>  

Kane stared at the dried seaweed in his hand, brittle yet resilient. <words>199</words> "How?" he asked. <words>203</words>  

Mara gestured to the photographs. <words>208</words> "By seeing it for what it is—a story we tell ourselves." <words>220</words>  

The diner door creaked open, and a group of travelers shuffled in, their faces weary from the road. <words>234</words> Kane watched them, recognizing the same weight in their eyes. <words>244</words>  

Between rides, between wars, between selves—this was where fear festered. <words>255</words>  

He placed the seaweed on the table and picked up a pen. <words>265</words> "Then let's rewrite it," he said. <words>272</words>  

Mara smiled, sliding a blank photograph toward him. <words>280</words> "Start here." <words>283</words>  

Outside, the neon sign flickered again, but this time, it held steady. <words>294</words>
