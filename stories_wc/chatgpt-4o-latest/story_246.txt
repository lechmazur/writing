The hush of the phone as its battery died left Ezra alone with his thoughts. <words>18</words>  
He exhaled, watching the static dance across his fingertips, a side effect of the anomaly. <words>30</words>  
The magnetic field here had always been strange, warping compasses and bending radio waves. <words>41</words>  
Locals dismissed it, but Ezra knew better—this place held secrets buried in time. <words>53</words>  
He unfolded the embroidered handkerchief, its golden thread forming symbols he barely understood. <words>65</words>  
It had been tucked inside the antique desk he’d bought last week. <words>75</words>  
Alongside it, he had found letters—handwritten, brittle with age, yet disturbingly relevant. <words>87</words>  
They spoke of a curse, passed down through blood, binding his family to misfortune. <words>100</words>  
Each generation had tried to break it, but none had succeeded. <words>110</words>  
The last letter warned of a cosmic scale, one that demanded balance. <words>122</words>  
Ezra had spent his life chasing conspiracies, but this one felt personal. <words>134</words>  
He traced the embroidered symbols again, feeling the weight of unseen forces. <words>146</words>  
The anomaly pulsed around him, a silent witness to his unraveling fate. <words>158</words>  
He had always been discreetly flagrant, pushing boundaries while pretending to toe the line. <words>172</words>  
Now, he stood at the edge of something far greater than himself. <words>184</words>  
The letters hinted at a process—polymerization, a binding of elements into permanence. <words>197</words>  
But what was he meant to fuse? His past? His bloodline? His very soul? <words>211</words>  
He reached into his pocket, pulling out a small vial of iron filings. <words>223</words>  
The anomaly reacted instantly, the filings lifting, twisting in unseen currents. <words>235</words>  
Ezra placed the handkerchief on the ground, arranging the filings atop it. <words>247</words>  
The letters had spoken of sacrifice, of weighing the scale in one’s favor. <words>260</words>  
His ancestors had failed because they had tried to escape the curse. <words>272</words>  
But Ezra understood now—he had to embrace it, to bind himself willingly. <words>285</words>  
He pressed his palm to the fabric, whispering the words from the letters. <words>298</words>  
The air thickened, the anomaly surging, pulling at him with invisible hands. <words>310</words>  
Pain lanced through his veins as something ancient took hold. <words>320</words>  
The filings melted into the embroidery, the symbols glowing with eerie light. <words>332</words>  
Ezra gasped, feeling his body shift, his essence polymerizing with the anomaly itself. <words>345</words>  
The curse was not meant to be broken—it was meant to be transformed. <words>357</words>  
As the last of his breath left him, the field settled, its hunger sated. <words>370</words>  
The embroidered handkerchief lay still, its golden thread now dark with iron. <words>382</words>  
Somewhere, a cosmic scale tipped, and for the first time in centuries, balanced. <words>395</words>
