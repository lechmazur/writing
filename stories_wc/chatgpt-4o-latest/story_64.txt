The floating marketplace swayed gently, its tethered balloons groaning under the weight of centuries-old stalls. <words>19</words>  
Aldren, an uncertain alchemist, traced his fingers over a cracked scale from a mythical beast, its surface humming with latent power. <words>40</words>  
He had traded half his library for it, hoping it would reveal the secret of immortality. <words>53</words>  
Yet, as he stood among the drifting stalls, he wondered if he had paid too much. <words>67</words>  
The hush before the judge’s verdict had always been the moment he feared most—when the world held its breath, waiting. <words>89</words>  
Now, he felt that same tension in his chest, as if the scale itself was weighing his soul. <words>106</words>  
Aldren’s hands were calloused from years of grinding herbs and distilling essences, but his heart remained unsteady. <words>122</words>  
He had never been certain of anything, least of all his own work. <words>134</words>  
The price of immortality was not just gold or knowledge—it was conviction, something he sorely lacked. <words>151</words>  
A merchant with technically wild eyes—half-mad, half-brilliant—watched him from across the stall. <words>166</words>  
“You hesitate,” the merchant said, voice like rustling parchment. <words>176</words>  
Aldren exhaled. <words>178</words>  
“I need to safeguard something,” he admitted, gripping the scale tighter. <words>191</words>  
The merchant’s gaze flickered to the marble floor beneath them, its surface worn by centuries of footsteps. <words>209</words>  
“The answer is there,” the merchant murmured. <words>218</words>  
Aldren frowned, kneeling to examine the scuffs and scratches. <words>230</words>  
They weren’t random—no, they formed a pattern, a code left by those who had walked before him. <words>248</words>  
Deciphering it, he saw a map emerge, winding through unseen trails of knowledge. <words>262</words>  
It led not to eternal life, but to something more valuable: the forgotten paths of the forest. <words>278</words>  
Aldren had sought immortality, but what he truly needed was a way to navigate the world. <words>294</words>  
The cracked scale pulsed in his palm, as if acknowledging his revelation. <words>307</words>  
He had been looking for permanence, but life was movement, change, discovery. <words>321</words>  
The marketplace swayed again, and Aldren stood, lighter than before. <words>334</words>  
He would map the trails, not for eternity, but for those who came after. <words>349</words>  
That, he realized, was its own kind of immortality. <words>360</words>  
The judge’s verdict would come soon, but Aldren no longer feared it. <words>373</words>  
He had already found his answer. <words>380</words>
