Sir Aldric knelt beneath the ruined aqueduct, tracing his fingers over the brittle parchment of an astronomical map. <words>14</words> The desert wind whispered through the crumbling stone, carrying the scent of distant rain. <words>26</words> He had traveled between mountain passes, seeking the knowledge hidden in the stars. <words>38</words> His mission was clear—to spark flames in a land of ice. <words>49</words>  

The map had been entrusted to him by a dying scholar, its constellations marked with cryptic annotations. <words>64</words> Aldric had studied it endlessly, yet something about it felt unknowingly familiar. <words>77</words> He could not place why, but each symbol tugged at the edges of his memory. <words>91</words>  

His journey led him to a rundown greenhouse, its glass ceiling fractured by time. <words>104</words> The structure stood alone in the desert, a forgotten relic of a bygone era. <words>118</words> Inside, vines curled around rusted beams, their leaves brittle from neglect. <words>130</words>  

Aldric unrolled the map beneath the broken roof, aligning it with the night sky. <words>143</words> He mapped the tears in the glass, matching them to the constellations above. <words>156</words> As he did, a pattern emerged—one he had seen before. <words>168</words>  

Memories surfaced, crisp with nostalgia. <words>172</words> He recalled his childhood, tracing stars with his father’s hand guiding his own. <words>185</words> The same constellations, the same markings—this was no ordinary map. <words>197</words> It was a canvas of life, charting not just the heavens but his own past. <words>211</words>  

Aldric’s heart pounded as he realized the truth. <words>217</words> The map was a key, a trigger to something long forgotten. <words>228</words> He followed its path, his steps guided by the alignment of stars and shattered glass. <words>242</words>  

At the greenhouse’s center, he found a pedestal, its surface etched with the same symbols. <words>255</words> He placed the map upon it, and the air shimmered with unseen energy. <words>268</words> The constellations above seemed to pulse, their light refracting through the broken ceiling. <words>282</words>  

Then, the ground trembled. <words>285</words> A hidden mechanism groaned to life, ancient gears shifting beneath the sand. <words>298</words> The aqueduct, long dry, began to flow once more, water cascading through its channels. <words>312</words>  

Aldric watched in awe as the desert transformed. <words>319</words> The parched earth drank deeply, and dormant seeds awakened. <words>330</words> Greenery spread like ink on parchment, life returning to the barren land. <words>343</words>  

He understood now—this was his purpose. <words>348</words> The map had led him not just to knowledge, but to action. <words>360</words> By mapping the tears in the roof, he had unlocked the past’s wisdom. <words>373</words>  

The land of ice he sought to ignite was not of frost, but of desolation. <words>387</words> And now, through the stars and his own hands, he had sparked its rebirth. <words>400</words>
