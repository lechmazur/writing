Jessa wiped her hands on her overalls, smudging grease across the fabric as she studied the latest piece in her space debris art studio. <words>19</words> The antique oil lamp sat at the center of her worktable, its brass surface dulled by time. <words>34</words> She had found it floating among the wreckage of an old cargo freighter, a relic of forgotten craftsmanship. <words>50</words> Her fingers traced the intricate etchings along its base, her mind already spinning with ways to restore it. <words>65</words>  

She had always been drawn to ancient methods, to the artistry of hands that shaped metal and glass before machines took over. <words>84</words> It was why she had left the stables, why she had traded the scent of hay for the cold sterility of space. <words>103</words> But even here, amid the drifting remnants of lost civilizations, she found ways to preserve what mattered. <words>118</words>  

The hum of an approaching vehicle pulled her from her thoughts. <words>126</words> She grabbed the half-torn tickets from her workbench, remnants of a forgotten carnival booth she had salvaged years ago. <words>145</words> They were more than scraps; they were keys, imbued with a strange energy she had yet to fully understand. <words>162</words>  

Jessa stepped outside as the transport skidded to a halt, dust kicking up in the artificial gravity field. <words>178</words> The door slid open, revealing a familiar face—Lior, her old friend and occasional accomplice. <words>192</words>  

"Still collecting junk?" he teased, his voice carrying the same intellectually playful lilt she remembered. <words>206</words>  

"Still running from responsibility?" she shot back, tossing him a ticket. <words>218</words>  

He caught it, flipping it between his fingers. <words>225</words> "You ever figure out what these do?" <words>232</words>  

Jessa smirked. <words>234</words> "Only one way to find out." <words>240</words>  

She pressed her own ticket against the lamp, and the air around them shimmered. <words>253</words> The lamp pulsed, its metal shifting, morphing beneath her touch. <words>265</words> The engravings deepened, rearranging into symbols she almost recognized. <words>276</words>  

Lior took a step back. <words>281</words> "Jessa, what did you do?" <words>287</words>  

She exhaled slowly. <words>290</words> "I think I woke it up." <words>296</words>  

The lamp glowed, and a voice, ancient and weary, filled the space. <words>308</words> "You seek to preserve what was lost." <words>316</words>  

Jessa nodded, her pulse steady. <words>322</words> "I do." <words>325</words>  

The glow intensified, and suddenly, they were no longer in the studio. <words>338</words> They were amid car rides through a city long gone, its streets alive with the hum of artisans at work. <words>354</words> Blacksmiths, glassblowers, weavers—all practicing their crafts as if time had never touched them. <words>370</words>  

Lior turned to her, awe in his eyes. <words>377</words> "This is what you wanted, isn't it?" <words>385</words>  

Jessa swallowed hard. <words>389</words> "Not just for me. <words>393</words> For everyone." <words>396</words>  

The lamp pulsed again, and the vision faded. <words>406</words> They were back in the studio, but something had changed. <words>417</words> The lamp was no longer dull; it gleamed, restored to its former brilliance. <words>431</words>  

Jessa ran a hand over it, feeling the warmth beneath her palm. <words>444</words> "Some things aren't meant to be forgotten." <words>453</words>  

Lior chuckled, shaking his head. <words>460</words> "You always were quietly bold." <words>467</words>  

She grinned. <words>469</words> "And you always needed proof." <words>477</words>  

He held up the ticket, now whole. <words>485</words> "Guess I got it." <words>491</words>  

Jessa looked at the lamp, then at the endless debris beyond. <words>503</words> There was still so much to save. <words>510</words>
