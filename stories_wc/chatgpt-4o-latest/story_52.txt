Jasper slipped through the time-worn marketplace inside the giant hourglass, his fingers light as whispers. <words>14</words>  

The sand above shifted, a slow cascade marking the passage of time, but he had more pressing concerns. <words>29</words>  

His latest mark, a merchant with a belt heavy with coin, stood haggling over a broken pencil sharpener. <words>43</words>  

Jasper smirked—who argued over something so useless? <words>49</words>  

Still, he had no time for judgment; he had a secret to share, one that seared his soul. <words>63</words>  

He needed coin to reach the one person who deserved to hear it. <words>72</words>  

With a flick of his wrist, he plucked a pouch from the merchant’s belt and melted into the crowd. <words>86</words>  

The air smelled of spice and old parchment, the scent of forgotten stories and misplaced dreams. <words>98</words>  

Jasper’s heart pounded—not from fear, but from hope. <words>106</words>  

He had spent years preparing for this moment, waiting for the chalk lines on the sidewalk to fade away. <words>121</words>  

That was the sign, the unspoken promise that the past had loosened its grip. <words>134</words>  

He ducked into a shadowed alcove, counting his stolen coins, when a voice materialized beside him. <words>148</words>  

“Stealing again, Jasper?” <words>151</words>  

He turned to see Liora, her smirk tastefully offensive, her eyes sharp as shattered glass. <words>164</words>  

“You know me,” he said, grinning. <words>169</words>  

“I do,” she replied, plucking the broken pencil sharpener from her pocket. <words>180</words>  

Jasper blinked. <words>182</words>  

“You stole that?” <words>184</words>  

“I traded for it,” she corrected. <words>188</words>  

“Why?” <words>189</words>  

“Because it belonged to him.” <words>193</words>  

Jasper’s breath hitched. <words>196</words>  

The man they had both lost, the one whose absence had carved hollows in their chests. <words>210</words>  

Liora’s fingers traced the sharpener’s jagged edge. <words>217</words>  

“He used to say devotion isn’t measured in grand gestures, but in the smallest, most broken things.” <words>232</words>  

Jasper swallowed hard. <words>235</words>  

“I need to tell you something,” he said. <words>242</words>  

Liora tilted her head. <words>246</words>  

“Then tell me.” <words>249</words>  

But words failed him, so he did the only thing that made sense—he grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the nearest tavern. <words>267</words>  

A musician strummed a familiar tune, and without thinking, Jasper began to sing. <words>279</words>  

Liora’s laughter bubbled up, but she joined in, their voices weaving together in a spontaneous karaoke duet. <words>294</words>  

The crowd cheered, oblivious to the weight of the moment. <words>303</words>  

As the last note faded, Jasper leaned in. <words>311</words>  

“He didn’t leave,” he whispered. <words>316</words>  

Liora’s breath caught. <words>319</words>  

“He was taken.” <words>322</words>  

The hourglass above shifted, grains of time slipping away, but Jasper had never felt more certain. <words>336</words>  

Liora’s grip tightened around the broken sharpener. <words>343</words>  

“Then we find him,” she said. <words>348</words>  

Jasper nodded, hope burning bright. <words>354</words>  

The marketplace hummed around them, but for the first time in years, they were moving forward. <words>368</words>  

Together. <words>369</words>
