The arboreal workshop swayed gently among the towering mushrooms, its wooden beams creaking in the damp midnight air. <words>16</words>  

Inside, Lior dipped his brush into a swirl of ochre and crimson, his insomniac mind tracing the contours of another painted smile. <words>34</words>  

Each face he created bore the same expression—serene, content, yet hollow, as if the joy was merely a mask. <words>48</words>  

He sighed, rubbing his temples, the weight of his sleepless nights pressing against his skull. <words>60</words>  

The final obstacle loomed before him, an unfinished canvas that refused to yield its truth. <words>73</words>  

He needed to see beyond the surface, beyond the painted smiles, to devour the essence of what lay beneath. <words>89</words>  

Lior grabbed the tapered wizard’s hat from the worktable, its bullet hole a silent testament to some forgotten violence. <words>106</words>  

He placed it on his head, feeling the fabric settle like a crown of riddles. <words>118</words>  

With a deep breath, he descended the rope ladder, his bare feet landing in a puddle that shimmered under the moonlight. <words>134</words>  

He knelt, staring into the water, his reflection rippling as he began scrying in the puddles after midnight. <words>150</words>  

Shapes twisted in the liquid depths—faces he had painted, their smiles melting into something raw and unguarded. <words>165</words>  

A whisper curled through the air, a voice both familiar and distant. <words>176</words>  

"You paint what you fear," it murmured, "but do you see what you are?" <words>189</words>  

Lior’s breath hitched as the puddle darkened, revealing an empty classroom bathed in the hush of first light. <words>205</words>  

Desks stood in neat rows, their surfaces marred by forgotten etchings of names and dreams. <words>218</words>  

At the front, an easel stood, a canvas waiting, expectant. <words>228</words>  

He stepped forward, his fingers trembling as he reached for the brush resting beside it. <words>242</words>  

The wizard’s hat slipped from his head, landing with a soft thud on the wooden floor. <words>256</words>  

A single bullet hole stared up at him, a silent eye witnessing his hesitation. <words>269</words>  

He turned back to the canvas, his heart pounding. <words>278</words>  

The painted smiles had vanished, replaced by something raw, something real. <words>291</words>  

A face stared back at him—his own, but not as he had ever seen it. <words>305</words>  

Peacefully chaotic, the expression wavered between sorrow and mirth, acceptance and defiance. <words>319</words>  

Lior swallowed hard, his fingers tightening around the brush. <words>330</words>  

To outlast the final obstacle, he had to embrace what lay beneath. <words>343</words>  

With a steady hand, he dipped the brush into the paint and began. <words>355</words>
