The root system mapping facility stood in the heart of an ancient forest, its wooden beams entwined with vines that pulsed like veins. <words>19</words>  

Inside, a quiet matchmaker named Elian traced the delicate lines of a mariner’s log book, its pages filled with cryptic symbols. <words>38</words>  

Elian had always been silently talkative, his thoughts flowing in gestures and glances rather than words. <words>51</words>  

He believed the roots held secrets of the cycle of rebirth, patterns that whispered of lives lost and regained. <words>69</words>  

The facility’s scholars dismissed his theories, but he knew the answers lay beneath their feet. <words>83</words>  

One night, he found an outdated VR headset buried in a forgotten storeroom, its circuits rusted with time. <words>101</words>  

He spent weeks rewiring it, his fingers moving with quiet precision as he modified its ancient code. <words>118</words>  

When he finally placed it over his eyes, the world around him dissolved into a luminous web of roots. <words>136</words>  

Each tendril pulsed with memories—faces, voices, lives that had once walked the earth. <words>151</words>  

He saw a woman laughing by the sea, her hands tracing the same symbols in the mariner’s log book. <words>170</words>  

A child followed, carving those symbols into bark, their meaning passed through generations. <words>185</words>  

Elian gasped, his silent voice echoing in the vast network of roots. <words>198</words>  

The patterns were not random; they were the language of rebirth, a map of souls returning. <words>215</words>  

But his discovery jeopardized the facility’s purpose—if the cycle of rebirth was proven, their research would be obsolete. <words>235</words>  

The scholars would never allow such knowledge to surface. <words>246</words>  

Elian had to act before they erased his findings. <words>258</words>  

He copied the patterns into the mariner’s log book, each stroke a silent rebellion. <words>274</words>  

As dawn broke, he slipped the book into the roots, letting the earth cradle its truth. <words>291</words>  

The facility’s leaders found him hours later, the VR headset shattered at his feet. <words>307</words>  

They demanded answers, but Elian only smiled, his silence louder than any words. <words>323</words>  

The roots had already begun their work, carrying the knowledge deep into the earth. <words>339</words>  

Centuries would pass, but the patterns would rise again, whispered through leaves and waves. <words>355</words>  

Elian closed his eyes, feeling the painful joy of knowing he had set something eternal in motion. <words>373</words>  

The cycle would continue, and one day, another seeker would find the book and understand. <words>390</words>  

The roots would remember, even if no one else did. <words>402</words>
