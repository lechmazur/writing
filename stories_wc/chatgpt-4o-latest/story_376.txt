The longhouse stood defiant against time, its wooden beams darkened by centuries of firelight and whispered secrets. <words>16</words>  

Inside, the air carried the scent of spiced mead and aged oak, a fitting stage for those who thrived in the hush of an overlooked era. <words>35</words>  

At the center of it all sat Eirik, a rogue fortune teller draped in modestly flashy silks, his presence both understated and undeniable. <words>54</words>  

Before him rested an amber inkwell, its golden depths swirling with ink that seemed to hold the weight of unspoken truths. <words>72</words>  

He dipped his quill, his fingers steady, his mind tracing the emotional patterns he sought to archive. <words>86</words>  

Across from him, Astrid watched, her own hands wrapped around a goblet of wine, their shared love for wine tasting the only bridge between them. <words>106</words>  

She had come not for a reading, but for something deeper, something neither had yet spoken aloud. <words>121</words>  

Eirik’s quill danced in a zigzag across the parchment, his strokes deliberate, his gaze never leaving hers. <words>138</words>  

“The past lingers in the ink,” he murmured, his voice carrying the fierce repose of a man who had seen too much. <words>156</words>  

Astrid tilted her head, her golden hair catching the firelight, her expression unreadable. <words>169</words>  

“You don’t believe in fate,” she said, swirling the wine in her goblet. <words>182</words>  

Eirik smirked, tapping the quill against the inkwell. <words>191</words>  

“I believe in patterns,” he corrected. <words>197</words>  

She leaned forward, her voice softer now. <words>205</words>  

“And what pattern do you see in me?” <words>212</words>  

Eirik hesitated, the weight of the unspoken offer settling between them. <words>225</words>  

He could tell her of the choices she had yet to make, the roads she would zigzag between, the emotions she would bury and unearth. <words>247</words>  

But some truths were not meant to be spoken. <words>256</words>  

Instead, he reached for his own goblet, lifting it in silent acknowledgment. <words>269</words>  

Astrid mirrored him, their eyes locking as they drank, sealing something neither would name. <words>284</words>  

The fire crackled, the longhouse standing witness to yet another moment lost to time. <words>298</words>  

Outside, the wind howled, but inside, the hush remained unbroken. <words>311</words>
