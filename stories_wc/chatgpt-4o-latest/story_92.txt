Elliot adjusted his gloves, the leash of a diamond-collared Afghan Hound wrapped loosely around his wrist. <words>16</words>  

The mansion loomed ahead, its windows dark, its dining room waiting. <words>26</words>  

He had walked dogs for the ultra-rich long enough to know their silent agreements—unspoken rules that dictated his every step. <words>42</words>  

Tonight, however, was different. <words>46</words>  

Tonight, he was here for himself. <words>51</words>  

The botanical collection sat in the center of the long dining table, its glass cases filled with preserved petals and twisted vines. <words>67</words>  

Rare, priceless, and rumored to be cursed. <words>72</words>  

Elliot had heard the stories, but he had never been one to turn away from fear. <words>85</words>  

He had come to stand where fear dared not tread. <words>94</words>  

The Afghan Hound whined, its ears twitching as the last light of day bled into night. <words>107</words>  

The air thickened, the silence growing loud, pressing against his ribs. <words>117</words>  

He reached for the nearest case, fingers brushing the cool glass. <words>127</words>  

A whisper of movement behind him. <words>132</words>  

He turned sharply, but the room remained empty. <words>140</words>  

Carefully careless, he told himself. <words>145</words>  

That was how he had always survived. <words>151</words>  

A shadow stretched across the table, though no one stood to cast it. <words>162</words>  

Elliot exhaled slowly, steadying his pulse. <words>169</words>  

He had encountered worse—at a blood drive once, where a stranger had gripped his wrist too tightly, eyes too knowing. <words>185</words>  

That encounter had taught him something: fear only had power if you let it. <words>197</words>  

The botanical collection pulsed, as if breathing. <words>204</words>  

He had to justify his presence, even if only to himself. <words>215</words>  

He wasn’t here for wealth or curiosity. <words>222</words>  

He was here to prove that silence could be broken. <words>231</words>  

The Afghan Hound growled low, its body tense. <words>239</words>  

Elliot reached for the latch on the glass case. <words>247</words>  

The moment it clicked open, the room exhaled. <words>255</words>  

A gust of air, thick with the scent of earth and decay, rushed past him. <words>267</words>  

The chandelier above flickered, casting jagged shadows. <words>275</words>  

Something unseen shifted in the corner of the room. <words>283</words>  

Elliot refused to step back. <words>288</words>  

He had come too far. <words>292</words>  

The silence roared in his ears. <words>298</words>  

Then, a voice—soft, brittle. <words>304</words>  

“You understand the cost?” <words>308</words>  

Elliot nodded. <words>310</words>  

The botanical collection shuddered, petals curling inward. <words>318</words>  

The leash in his hand tightened as the Afghan Hound pressed against his leg. <words>330</words>  

He had made his choice. <words>335</words>  

The mansion would not let him leave unchanged. <words>343</words>  

But then, neither would he. <words>348</words>
