The abandoned carnival ticket booth stood like a forgotten relic, its peeling paint whispering of laughter long since silenced. <words>14</words>  

Inside, the gloomy barkeep slumped against the counter, flipping open a worn wallet with fingers that had memorized its creases. <words>29</words>  

The wallet wasn’t his, not really—it belonged to a man who no longer existed, a man swallowed by transient realities. <words>42</words>  

He sighed, his abrasively charming demeanor dulled by the weight of stolen time, waiting for the hush when a truce forms without words. <words>57</words>  

Outside, the wind droned through rusted carnival rides, a mechanical hum that blurred the edges of past and present. <words>69</words>  

He had come here chasing whispers, confessions overheard at a broken payphone booth where voices bled through static. <words>81</words>  

They spoke of midnight’s theft, of light stolen and hidden in the folds of forgotten places. <words>91</words>  

He had listened, piecing together fragments of truth like a bartender assembling shattered memories over cheap whiskey. <words>104</words>  

Now, he waited, knowing that reality would shift again, that the carnival would breathe in the dark. <words>115</words>  

A shadow flickered beyond the booth’s cracked window, a figure neither here nor gone. <words>125</words>  

He straightened, slipping the wallet into his pocket, its presence an anchor against the shifting tide. <words>137</words>  

The figure stepped closer, a woman with eyes like fractured mirrors, reflecting too many worlds at once. <words>149</words>  

“You’ve been listening,” she said, her voice carrying the weight of a thousand unspoken truths. <words>160</words>  

He nodded, the carnival’s hush settling between them, an unspoken truce forming in the stillness. <words>172</words>  

“You want the light back,” she murmured, tilting her head as if measuring his resolve. <words>183</words>  

He exhaled, the scent of old wood and forgotten dreams thick in the air. <words>194</words>  

“Midnight took it,” he said, his voice rough, edged with something like regret. <words>205</words>  

She smiled, not kindly, but knowingly, as if she had seen this story play out before. <words>217</words>  

“The carnival is its own reality,” she said. “It shifts, it steals, it remembers.” <words>228</words>  

He clenched his fists, the wallet pressing against his palm like a heartbeat. <words>239</words>  

“How do I take it back?” he asked, though he already knew the answer. <words>250</words>  

She gestured toward the carousel, its painted horses frozen mid-gallop, waiting. <words>261</words>  

“Ride,” she said simply. “And don’t let go.” <words>270</words>  

He hesitated, then stepped forward, the carnival groaning as if sensing his intent. <words>282</words>  

The moment he touched the carousel, the world fractured, colors bleeding into shadow. <words>294</words>  

He held on as the ride lurched, spinning through realities, through stolen midnights. <words>306</words>  

The wind howled, voices whispering secrets he had only half-heard before. <words>317</words>  

Then, suddenly, stillness. <words>320</words>  

He stood in the booth again, the woman gone, the wallet heavier in his pocket. <words>332</words>  

He opened it, and there, nestled between old bills, was a sliver of light. <words>344</words>  

The carnival sighed, settling into silence, as if appeased. <words>353</words>  

He exhaled, stepping out into the night, the stolen light pulsing against his chest. <words>365</words>  

Midnight had taken, but he had reclaimed. <words>372</words>  

And for now, that was enough. <words>378</words>
