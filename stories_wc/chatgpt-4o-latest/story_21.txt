The forgotten city hall stood in eerie silence, its once-grand columns now draped in ivy, its marble floors cracked by time. <words>18</words>  

Amid the distant thrum of drum circles, Ambassador Lior adjusted his cuffs, his expression an abrasive calm. <words>34</words>  

He had come not for diplomacy, but for something far older—vengeance, measured and exact. <words>46</words>  

In his palm, he turned over a fox tail tassel, plucked from the belt of a bandit long dead. <words>61</words>  

The tassel was a relic of betrayal, a token from the night his brother had been taken. <words>75</words>  

Lior had spent years decoding genetic patterns, tracing the bloodlines of those responsible. <words>87</words>  

His work, both organically synthetic and deeply personal, had led him here. <words>98</words>  

The scent of must lingered in the air, seeping through the shuttered children’s theater where he now stood. <words>113</words>  

It was here that the last of the bandit’s kin had hidden, unaware that their lineage had been unraveled. <words>129</words>  

A voice, dry as parchment, called from the shadows. <words>136</words>  

“You wear vengeance like a diplomat’s cloak, Lior.” <words>143</words>  

The old man stepped forward, his robes tattered but his eyes sharp. <words>153</words>  

Lior smirked, a jest forming on his lips. <words>161</words>  

“I prefer to think of it as justice, Elder.” <words>169</words>  

The elder chuckled, shaking his head. <words>176</words>  

“Justice is a blade honed by truth, not by blood.” <words>185</words>  

Lior tightened his grip on the tassel, feeling the weight of his choices. <words>196</words>  

He had spent years tracing the genetic echoes of his brother’s killers, but now, standing here, the price of revenge loomed. <words>215</words>  

Would he erase an entire bloodline for the sins of one? <words>224</words>  

The drum circles outside grew louder, their rhythm pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>235</words>  

The elder stepped closer, his voice softer now. <words>244</words>  

“You have the knowledge to end them, but also to heal.” <words>254</words>  

Lior exhaled, the musty air thick in his lungs. <words>264</words>  

He had come seeking retribution, but found only the weight of history pressing down on him. <words>278</words>  

Slowly, he let the tassel slip from his fingers, watching it drift to the floor. <words>291</words>  

The elder nodded, understanding. <words>296</words>  

“Come,” he said. “There is more to be done.” <words>305</words>  

Lior followed, leaving vengeance behind in the dust of the forgotten city hall. <words>317</words>  

Outside, the drum circles played on, their rhythm unchanged. <words>327</words>
