The rainforest canopy village shimmered with golden light as Elias adjusted his collar, waiting for his name to be called. <words>16</words>  
The doctor’s office, a wooden platform suspended between colossal trees, swayed gently in the uncertain silence. <words>29</words>  
Elias, a reformed con artist, tapped his fingers against his knee, his mind drifting to the crumpled sheet music in his pocket. <words>44</words>  
It was the last remnant of his past life, a song he had once used to swindle dreamers out of their savings. <words>60</words>  
Now, he sought redemption—not through deception, but by becoming the guardian of tomorrow’s flame. <words>72</words>  
The village elders had spoken of it in hushed tones, a sacred duty passed only to the worthy. <words>85</words>  
Elias had spent years proving himself, yet doubt still clung to him like mist in the treetops. <words>99</words>  
A nurse emerged, calling another patient, and Elias exhaled, his thoughts spiraling back to the detour that had led him here. <words>115</words>  
Earlier that morning, he had taken a longer route to avoid a construction zone, stumbling upon a hidden grove. <words>130</words>  
There, he had found an elder humming a familiar tune—the very melody from his crumpled sheet music. <words>144</words>  
The elder had smiled knowingly, as if recognizing the dishonestly honest man Elias had been. <words>157</words>  
“You carry a song of deception,” the elder had said, “but even lies can lead to truth.” <words>170</words>  
Elias had hesitated before yodeling the tune, his voice echoing through the trees, raw and unguarded. <words>184</words>  
The elder had nodded approvingly. “You understand now. The flame is not just fire—it is the light of wisdom.” <words>199</words>  
Now, in the waiting room, Elias clenched the sheet music, realizing the gradual revelations of his journey. <words>212</words>  
He had spent years running from his past, but perhaps his past had been leading him here all along. <words>226</words>  
The doctor finally called his name, and Elias stood, stepping forward with a heart lighter than before. <words>239</words>  
He was ready to embrace his role—not as a trickster, but as a keeper of truth. <words>251</words>  
The rainforest whispered around him, carrying his yodel into the vast, waiting future. <words>262</words>
