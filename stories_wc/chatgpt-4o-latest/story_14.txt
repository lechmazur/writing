The waves slapped against the dock, rhythmic as a gambler’s heartbeat before the final card turned. <words>16</words>  

Jonas, a man who had wagered more than he’d ever won, stood at the edge, gripping a rustic candle mold in his trembling hands. <words>38</words>  

The tidal power monitoring station loomed behind him, its steel bones humming with the ocean’s restless energy. <words>52</words>  

He had spent years chasing fortune, but tonight, he sought something rarer—a last spark before oblivion. <words>69</words>  

The unhinged professors who had once lectured him at midnight, ranting about unseen forces, had planted the idea in his mind. <words>92</words>  

They spoke of unspoken bargains, of debts paid in whispers rather than coin. <words>106</words>  

Jonas had laughed then, but now, with the candle mold heavy in his grip, he wasn’t so sure. <words>126</words>  

The station’s control room flickered with candlelight, a tradition among the workers who dined there. <words>143</words>  

Electricity was their trade, but fire was their ritual. <words>154</words>  

Jonas stepped inside, the scent of wax and salt thick in the air. <words>169</words>  

He had docked his boat hours ago, but his true arrival was only now beginning. <words>186</words>  

Across the table sat Eleanor, a woman whose laughter could turn tides. <words>200</words>  

She had always been rarely predictable, her moods shifting like the sea. <words>215</words>  

“You brought it,” she said, eyeing the mold. <words>226</words>  

Jonas nodded, setting it between them. <words>236</words>  

The others continued their meal, oblivious to the quiet transaction unfolding. <words>252</words>  

Eleanor reached out, her fingers brushing the metal. <words>264</words>  

“This belonged to my grandfather,” she murmured. <words>276</words>  

Jonas swallowed. <words>279</words>  

“I know.” <words>281</words>  

She smiled, but there was sorrow in it. <words>294</words>  

“You think this will change anything?” <words>306</words>  

Jonas exhaled, the candle flames dancing in his breath. <words>321</words>  

“I think it’s my last chance to make things right.” <words>337</words>  

Eleanor studied him, then the mold, then the flickering light. <words>353</words>  

Finally, she nodded. <words>360</words>  

“Then let’s begin.” <words>371</words>  

They melted the wax, poured it carefully, watched as the past took shape in the present. <words>392</words>  

The others laughed around them, unaware of the silent bargain being struck. <words>409</words>  

Jonas felt something shift, as if the tides themselves had acknowledged his wager. <words>426</words>  

For the first time in years, he wasn’t afraid of losing. <words>440</words>  

The candle hardened, the flame steady. <words>451</words>  

Eleanor met his gaze, and in that moment, they both understood. <words>468</words>  

Some debts weren’t paid in gold, but in firelight and forgiveness. <words>484</words>  

And sometimes, that was enough. <words>492</words>
