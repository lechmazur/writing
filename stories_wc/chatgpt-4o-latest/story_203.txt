The exorcist’s hands trembled as he snapped the last plastic piece into place, the half-assembled toy spaceship resting on his lap. <words>19</words>  

He had never been usual, never fit the mold of those who banished spirits with booming voices and unwavering confidence. <words>38</words>  

Instead, he worked in a defiant hush, whispering incantations as if afraid the ghosts might hear him before he was ready. <words>59</words>  

Tonight, amid the floating wreckage of orbital debris, he prepared to confront the inheritance of lies that had haunted his family for generations. <words>83</words>  

His father had told him that their lineage was sacred, that they were chosen to cleanse the world of lingering souls. <words>105</words>  

But the truth had surfaced like a corpse in still water—his ancestors had not banished spirits; they had trapped them. <words>127</words>  

The pressed wildflowers in his pocket were proof, each petal infused with the whispers of those who had been silenced. <words>149</words>  

He had found them in an old book, their brittle edges crumbling as he read the names scrawled beneath them. <words>171</words>  

Each flower was a soul, bound by deceit, submerged in the weight of forgotten promises. <words>187</words>  

He clenched them now, feeling the fragile remnants of lives stolen by the very rituals he had been taught to perform. <words>211</words>  

A metallic clang echoed through the wreckage, the sound of a key turning in a lock that should not exist in space. <words>235</words>  

The air around him thickened, the ghosts stirring, sensing the unraveling of their prison. <words>253</words>  

He swallowed hard, stage fright gripping him as he prepared to speak the words that would set them free. <words>275</words>  

His father’s voice echoed in his mind, warning him that breaking the cycle would bring ruin. <words>293</words>  

But ruin was already here, drifting in the void, waiting for someone to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never.” <words>317</words>  

He exhaled, his voice barely above a whisper as he recited the reversal, the incantation that would unbind the souls. <words>341</words>  

The pressed wildflowers in his palm disintegrated, their essence unraveling into the void, each petal a name finally spoken. <words>365</words>  

The debris around him trembled, the ghosts rising, no longer submerged in the weight of forgotten history. <words>385</words>  

For the first time, the exorcist felt no fear, only the quiet certainty that he had done what was right. <words>407</words>  

As the last whisper faded, he turned back to the toy spaceship, snapping the final piece into place. <words>429</words>  

It was not perfect, not whole, but it was something new, something built from the wreckage of what had been. <words>453</words>  

And that, he thought, was enough. <words>458</words>
