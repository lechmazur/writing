The underground city of the mole people stretched endlessly beneath the dead sky, its tunnels illuminated only by the dim glow of bioluminescent fungi. <words>19</words>  

Elias adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp strapped to his forehead, its cracked glass a relic from a collapsed mine centuries ago. <words>38</words>  

He had been a student for longer than he could remember, studying immortality with a devotion that had long since become detached from any human urgency. <words>61</words>  

The last star had burned out, and yet he remained, endlessly pursuing mastery over his own reality. <words>78</words>  

The mole people scurried past him, their hunched forms carrying journals filled with the knowledge of those who had come before. <words>97</words>  

They did not speak, but they understood the weight of gifted burdens—knowledge passed down, exchanged, and reshaped through the act of swapping travel journals. <words>120</words>  

Elias had traded his own countless times, each new volume containing fragments of his research, his failures, his fleeting triumphs. <words>141</words>  

He digitized the contents of each journal before relinquishing it, ensuring that no insight was ever truly lost. <words>160</words>  

The mole people did not question his presence, nor did they question his purpose; they simply accepted him as part of the city’s eternal rhythm. <words>183</words>  

He had long since abandoned the surface world, where time had collapsed into irrelevance, where the absence of stars had rendered the sky a void. <words>206</words>  

Here, beneath the earth, he pursued the mundanely glorious—an existence defined not by spectacle, but by the quiet accumulation of understanding. <words>227</words>  

The headlamp flickered as he turned a page, its failing light casting shadows that danced like ghosts against the tunnel walls. <words>248</words>  

He had read of those who sought immortality through power, through conquest, through divine intervention. <words>265</words>  

But Elias sought something different: the ability to shape his own existence, to master the fabric of reality itself. <words>286</words>  

The mole people had no interest in such ambitions, yet they facilitated his work, their journals carrying whispers of forgotten techniques. <words>309</words>  

He traced a passage with his fingers, the ink smudged by time, detailing a method of preservation through thought alone. <words>330</words>  

If he could digitize not just words, but consciousness itself, then perhaps he could transcend the limits of flesh. <words>351</words>  

The headlamp dimmed further, its power nearly spent, but Elias did not falter. <words>366</words>  

He had lived through the death of stars; he would not be undone by darkness. <words>383</words>  

The mole people continued their silent exchanges, their journals passing from hand to hand, their knowledge flowing like an underground river. <words>406</words>  

Elias closed his eyes, feeling the weight of centuries settle upon him, and in that moment, he understood. <words>427</words>  

Immortality was not a single act, not a grand revelation, but the quiet persistence of thought, carried forward by those willing to bear it. <words>450</words>  

The headlamp flickered one last time before going dark, but Elias did not need it anymore. <words>469</words>  

He had already begun to digitize himself, one thought at a time. <words>484</words>
