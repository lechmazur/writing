The dandelion field stretched endlessly, golden heads swaying in the hush that followed the newborn’s first cry. <words>19</words>  

A feral ranger stood among them, his breath steady, his fingers grazing the brass balance scale strapped to his belt. <words>38</words>  

He had lived by instinct, by the raw, unfiltered perception of the world, never dulled by civilization’s comforts. <words>53</words>  

Yet, even he quivered now, sensing the weight of the moment, the delicate pause between what was and what would be. <words>72</words>  

The child had been born beneath the open sky, its arrival heralded only by the wind and the rustling of dandelion seeds. <words>91</words>  

He had come here for a reason, though reason itself had always been a precisely random force in his life. <words>108</words>  

The brass scale was not for measuring gold or grain but for something far more elusive—balance in the unknown. <words>125</words>  

He had received the message through code words in receipts, scattered across markets and taverns, guiding him here. <words>142</words>  

Each slip of paper had carried fragments of a truth he had yet to fully grasp, yet he had followed. <words>159</words>  

Now, in the quiet between the infant’s first breath and its next, he understood why. <words>172</words>  

The mother lay exhausted, her eyes half-lidded, her body spent but her spirit unbroken. <words>187</words>  

She had known he would come, though she had never met him, never spoken his name aloud. <words>204</words>  

The father was absent, lost to the unknown, and so the ranger had been summoned instead. <words>219</words>  

Not to replace, not to claim, but to witness—to weigh the moment on his scale. <words>234</words>  

He knelt, pressing his palm to the earth, feeling the pulse of life beneath his fingertips. <words>251</words>  

The child’s tiny fingers curled, grasping at the air, reaching for something unseen but deeply felt. <words>268</words>  

The ranger exhaled, his breath stirring the dandelion seeds into flight, scattering them toward the horizon. <words>285</words>  

He had spent his life resisting the pull of permanence, embracing the unknown with open arms. <words>300</words>  

Now, he saw that same embrace in the child’s first reaching motion, in the mother’s weary smile. <words>317</words>  

The brass scale remained untouched, for some things could not be measured, only accepted. <words>332</words>  

He rose, his task complete, though no one had assigned it, no one had spoken it aloud. <words>349</words>  

The wind carried the infant’s second cry, breaking the pause, ushering in the next moment. <words>364</words>  

The ranger turned, vanishing into the dandelion field, leaving only footprints and drifting seeds behind. <words>381</words>  

The mother whispered a name, not his, but the child’s, and the world moved forward once more. <words>396</words>
