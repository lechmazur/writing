The neon skyline pulsed beyond the rooftop garden, a cybernetic heartbeat in the city’s restless body. <words>14</words>  

Elias, a solemn orchardist, knelt beside a gnarled citrus tree, his fingers tracing the rough bark. <words>28</words>  

He had cultivated this oasis above the chaos, a place where roots could anchor despite the shifting world below. <words>42</words>  

Tonight, in the hush between two heartbeats, he waited. <words>50</words>  

A soft scuffle behind him made him sigh. <words>57</words>  

“Again, Milo?” he murmured without turning. <words>64</words>  

The overlooked child—endearingly irritating, perpetually underfoot—grinned as he stepped closer. <words>74</words>  

“You always know,” Milo said, plopping onto a crate. <words>83</words>  

Elias finally looked at him, his expression unreadable. <words>91</words>  

Milo was small for his age, his clothes patched, his fingers always twitching as if searching for something unseen. <words>106</words>  

“I found something,” Milo announced, holding up a plain key. <words>115</words>  

Elias took it, turning it over in his calloused hands. <words>124</words>  

“Where?” he asked, his voice carefully neutral. <words>131</words>  

Milo shrugged. “In the alley. Thought it might be important.” <words>141</words>  

Elias exhaled slowly. <words>144</words>  

In a city where everything was coded, encrypted, locked behind retinal scans, a simple key was an anomaly. <words>159</words>  

“Why bring it to me?” Elias asked. <words>166</words>  

Milo kicked at the dirt between the planters. <words>174</words>  

“Because you see things others don’t,” he muttered. <words>182</words>  

Elias studied the boy, his heart tightening. <words>190</words>  

Milo was like this garden—overlooked, underestimated, yet stubbornly alive. <words>200</words>  

He turned the key in his palm, feeling its weight. <words>209</words>  

“Come,” he said, standing. <words>214</words>  

Milo scrambled up, eyes bright with curiosity. <words>222</words>  

They descended into the city, weaving through neon-lit streets. <words>231</words>  

Elias moved with purpose, Milo darting beside him like a restless shadow. <words>241</words>  

At last, they reached a forgotten door, its surface scratched and worn. <words>251</words>  

Elias hesitated, then slid the key into the lock. <words>260</words>  

A soft click. <words>263</words>  

The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit space filled with humming servers and tangled wires. <words>275</words>  

Milo gasped. <words>277</words>  

“What is this?” he whispered. <words>282</words>  

Elias stepped inside, his voice hushed with excited restraint. <words>291</words>  

“A network,” he said. “A place where lives connect.” <words>300</words>  

Milo’s fingers twitched again. <words>305</words>  

“Like… people?” he asked. <words>310</words>  

Elias nodded. <words>312</words>  

“In a world that x-outs what it deems unnecessary, this is where the forgotten find each other.” <words>326</words>  

Milo’s breath hitched. <words>329</words>  

“You mean… like me?” <words>333</words>  

Elias placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder. <words>341</words>  

“Like us,” he corrected. <words>345</words>  

Milo swallowed hard, then grinned. <words>352</words>  

“So… what now?” <words>356</words>  

Elias smiled, the weight of solitude lifting. <words>364</words>  

“Now, we grow,” he said. <words>370</words>  

And in the hush between two heartbeats, connection took root. <words>380</words>
