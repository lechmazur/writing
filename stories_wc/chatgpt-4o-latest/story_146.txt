Marla had spent years pretending to see the future, but the visions had started coming unbidden. <words>18</words>  

She sat in the extinct language archive, flipping through brittle pages, searching for meaning in forgotten words. <words>33</words>  

The archive was quiet, save for the occasional rustle of parchment and the distant hum of the city. <words>47</words>  

She had come here throughout planting season, drawn by an inexplicable need to study sacred development. <words>61</words>  

Her hands trembled as she traced a passage describing a bone flute buried in a crypt centuries ago. <words>75</words>  

The words stirred something deep within her, a vision flickering at the edges of her mind. <words>88</words>  

She saw herself getting lost in a new city, wandering unfamiliar streets until she found a hidden gem. <words>103</words>  

The vision sharpened—an underground chamber, dust thick in the air, and the bone flute resting on an altar. <words>118</words>  

Marla had regularly seldom trusted her visions, but this one felt different, urgent. <words>129</words>  

She left the archive and let her feet carry her through the labyrinthine streets, surrendering to chance. <words>143</words>  

Hours passed before she stumbled upon a crumbling stone entrance, half-hidden behind ivy and time. <words>157</words>  

She hesitated, then stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and forgotten history. <words>171</words>  

The chamber was just as she had seen—dusty, silent, sacred. <words>180</words>  

At the center, the bone flute lay waiting, its surface etched with symbols from the archive. <words>194</words>  

She reached for it, and the moment her fingers touched the flute, another vision overtook her. <words>208</words>  

She saw the past—priests playing the flute, their melodies shaping the growth of crops and forests. <words>222</words>  

She saw the future—herself standing before a crowd, playing the flute, guiding them toward renewal. <words>236</words>  

Peaceful anger welled within her, a quiet fury at the knowledge lost, the wisdom buried. <words>249</words>  

She had spent years pretending, but now she understood—her gift was real, and it had purpose. <words>263</words>  

She left the crypt, the flute clutched tightly, ready to explore the possibilities it offered. <words>276</words>  

Returning to the archive, she translated the symbols, uncovering instructions for melodies that shaped the land. <words>290</words>  

She played the first notes, and outside, the wind shifted, carrying the scent of rain. <words>303</words>  

The city, unaware of its forgotten past, would soon remember. <words>311</words>  

Marla had taken a chance, and in doing so, she had found her true calling. <words>324</words>
