The atom-powered lighthouse stood alone on the edge of a world that had forgotten its own past. <words>17</words>  

Inside, a man named Oris waited in the hush of a line that never moved. <words>30</words>  

He was a time refugee, the last remnant of an empire erased from history. <words>42</words>  

The embroidered tablecloth before him was his only relic, its golden threads whispering of a home no one remembered. <words>58</words>  

Oris traced the patterns with fingers that had once commanded fleets, now reduced to quiet defiance. <words>72</words>  

The lighthouse hummed with atomic fire, its beacon pulsing in rhythms dictated by the alignment of the stars. <words>87</words>  

He had learned to trust the strange mathematics of the cosmos, for they alone had guided him here. <words>102</words>  

The world outside had no place for him, but he had not come to beg for one. <words>116</words>  

He had come to bind old wounds with unstoppable will, to stitch together what time had unraveled. <words>131</words>  

The embroidered tablecloth was more than fabric—it was a map, a key, a promise. <words>144</words>  

Each thread held coordinates, each symbol a forgotten name, each fold a path through lost time. <words>158</words>  

The lighthouse’s keeper, a woman named Sel, watched him with wary respect. <words>170</words>  

She had seen wanderers before, but none like him—none so quietly defiant. <words>183</words>  

“You trust the stars too much,” she said, her voice edged with borrowed dawn. <words>196</words>  

“They have never lied to me,” Oris replied, his fingers tightening on the cloth. <words>209</words>  

Sel considered this, then nodded toward the great catapult outside, rusted but functional. <words>223</words>  

“If you’re right, that will send you where you need to go.” <words>233</words>  

Oris stood, folding the tablecloth with reverence, his heart steady. <words>244</words>  

The empire was gone, but its echoes remained, waiting to be gathered. <words>256</words>  

He stepped into the night, where the stars aligned in patterns only he could read. <words>270</words>  

Sel activated the catapult, its ancient gears grinding against time itself. <words>282</words>  

Oris climbed into the cradle, the embroidered tablecloth wrapped around his shoulders like a banner. <words>296</words>  

The lighthouse pulsed, its atomic heart beating in time with the cosmos. <words>308</words>  

Sel pulled the lever, and Oris was flung into the sky, toward the past, toward home. <words>322</words>  

The stars caught him, folding him into their forgotten light. <words>332</words>  

Sel watched until he was gone, then turned back to the lighthouse, waiting for the next traveler. <words>347</words>  

The hush of the unmoving line remained, but now, it carried the whisper of possibility. <words>361</words>
