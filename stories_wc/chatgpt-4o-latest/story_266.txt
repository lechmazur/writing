The floating rock yoga studio drifted in the dim hush of dawn, its wooden planks creaking as the wind whispered through the gaps. <words>19</words>  

Inside, a bleak clown sat cross-legged, his painted grin cracked like old porcelain, his eyes shadowed by sleepless nights. <words>38</words>  

Before him, a clock hand spun wildly, defying time’s order, a cruel joke ticking in endless circles. <words>53</words>  

He had once promised to master joy, to outshine the northern lights with a grin that could split the sky. <words>72</words>  

But promises drifted like mist, dissolving before they could be grasped, leaving only the absurdity of their echoes. <words>90</words>  

He had learned to dismantle illusions in private poetry, carving truth from the lies he once performed. <words>106</words>  

Each stanza stripped away another layer of painted artifice, revealing the raw sinew of his sorrow. <words>122</words>  

The studio swayed, suspended above a world that had long since stopped making sense to him. <words>137</words>  

He had come here to master himself, to wrestle meaning from the technically absurd. <words>151</words>  

The clock hand spun faster, mocking his efforts, a relentless reminder that time obeyed no master. <words>168</words>  

He reached for it, fingers trembling, but the moment he touched it, the world lurched. <words>184</words>  

The wooden floor groaned, the floating rock shuddered, and the horizon tilted like a stage set collapsing. <words>202</words>  

He clutched his knees, breathing through the chaos, his painted smile stretching into something almost real. <words>218</words>  

The train whistle echoed from below, the earliest departure slicing through the dawn’s fragile silence. <words>234</words>  

He had once chased that sound, believing it carried the promise of somewhere better. <words>249</words>  

But promises drifted, and he had learned that escape was just another illusion. <words>264</words>  

The spinning clock hand slowed, its rebellion faltering, as if acknowledging his realization. <words>279</words>  

He exhaled, his breath curling in the cold air, and for the first time, he felt weightless. <words>296</words>  

Not because the rock floated, but because he had finally let go of the need to chase. <words>312</words>  

The northern lights flickered on the horizon, their brilliance untouchable, but his grin remained. <words>328</words>  

Not painted, not forced—just there, jagged and generous, a quiet defiance against the absurd. <words>344</words>  

The train rumbled below, carrying others toward their drifting promises, but he stayed. <words>359</words>  

The clock hand stopped. <words>362</words>  

And for the first time, time belonged to him. <words>377</words>
