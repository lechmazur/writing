The sun hung low over the abandoned carnival, casting long, shifting shadows across the rusted roller coaster tracks. <words>17</words>  

Jonas crouched beside a broken cart, his fingers tightening around the antique brass key in his palm. <words>31</words>  

He had always known he was different, but the revelation had struck him like a lightning bolt. <words>45</words>  

His ability to astral project wasn’t just a quirk—it was a survival skill, one he had to preserve. <words>60</words>  

The key had been left for him, its meaning buried in the past, but he had no time for riddles. <words>75</words>  

The shadows stretched, marking the sun’s descent, and he knew he had to flee before they found him. <words>89</words>  

He had learned to track time by the movement of shadows, a skill passed down through whispered lessons. <words>103</words>  

Sometimes always, he reminded himself, the trick to survival was knowing when to disappear. <words>115</words>  

His pursuers were close, their footsteps crunching against the gravel, their voices sharp with intent. <words>129</words>  

Jonas inhaled deeply, his mind slipping free from his body, his astral form rising above the wreckage. <words>143</words>  

From above, he saw them—three figures moving with practiced precision, scanning the ruins for any sign of him. <words>158</words>  

They didn’t understand his gift, only that it made him valuable, and that made him a target. <words>172</words>  

He had spent years running, but this time, he wouldn’t just escape—he would outmaneuver them. <words>186</words>  

His astral form drifted ahead, scouting the path beyond the coaster’s skeletal remains. <words>198</words>  

The key in his hand pulsed with a strange warmth, as if urging him toward something unseen. <words>212</words>  

He returned to his body with a jolt, his breath steady despite the adrenaline coursing through him. <words>226</words>  

The shadows had shifted again, marking the precise moment he needed to move. <words>238</words>  

He sprinted along the rusted tracks, his feet barely making a sound against the corroded metal. <words>252</words>  

Behind him, the pursuers hesitated, uncertain of where he had gone. <words>263</words>  

Jonas knew they relied on logic, on patterns—things he had long since abandoned. <words>277</words>  

Compassion had always been his weakness, but now, it was his greatest weapon. <words>290</words>  

He had seen into their minds, felt their desperation, their fear of failure. <words>303</words>  

They weren’t monsters, just people trapped in a system that demanded obedience. <words>316</words>  

He could flee, but he could also lead them astray, give them a way out. <words>329</words>  

The brass key burned against his palm, a reminder of doors yet to be opened. <words>343</words>  

He turned sharply, doubling back, his movements guided by instinct and shadow. <words>356</words>  

The pursuers followed, their confusion growing as he led them deeper into the ruins. <words>370</words>  

At the heart of the carnival, he stopped, his breath steady, his purpose clear. <words>384</words>  

He held up the key, letting the last rays of sunlight catch its surface. <words>397</words>  

“This isn’t about me,” he said, his voice calm, unwavering. <words>407</words>  

The figures hesitated, their weapons lowering slightly, uncertainty flickering in their eyes. <words>421</words>  

Jonas stepped forward, offering them a choice—one they had never been given before. <words>435</words>  

Sometimes always, survival wasn’t about running. <words>442</words>  

Sometimes, it was about showing another way. <words>449</words>
