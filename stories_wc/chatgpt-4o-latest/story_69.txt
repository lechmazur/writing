Elias sat hunched over a flickering hologram, his fingers tracing the fractured light as if willing it back to coherence. <words>14</words>  

The repair shop hummed with the low whir of malfunctioning projections, their distorted images casting ghostly figures across the walls. <words>32</words>  

He was a druid, though not the kind who spoke to trees—his magic lay in circuitry, in coaxing broken things into brief moments of wholeness. <words>54</words>  

But today, his hands hesitated, his certainty fraying like the static-laced illusions before him. <words>66</words>  

A dented lunch tin sat beside him, its lid barely closing over the remnants of yesterday’s meal. <words>81</words>  

It had once belonged to his mentor, a woman who had taught him that even the most ordinary objects carried weight. <words>99</words>  

She had called him uniquely common, a paradox that had both comforted and unsettled him. <words>113</words>  

Now, with her gone, he felt the pull of obligation—toward the shop, toward the broken things, toward a world that never quite fit together. <words>135</words>  

But obligation was not the same as purpose. <words>141</words>  

So, when the library hours stretched long and the shop emptied of customers, Elias wandered. <words>157</words>  

His feet carried him through the city’s veins, past neon-lit streets and into the forgotten spaces where stories clung like dust. <words>177</words>  

He found himself at the back entrance of a crumbling theater, where auditions were held for those who had nowhere else to perform. <words>198</words>  

The actors here were like him—uncertain, searching, trying to forge beauty from anarchy. <words>213</words>  

He watched as a woman stepped onto the makeshift stage, her voice trembling but her presence undeniable. <words>229</words>  

She spoke of lost things, of broken machines and forgotten names, and Elias felt something stir within him. <words>247</words>  

When she finished, the silence was thick, expectant. <words>255</words>  

Without thinking, he stepped forward, the lunch tin clutched in his hands. <words>268</words>  

“I don’t act,” he admitted, his voice quieter than he intended. <words>280</words>  

The director, a man with tired eyes, gestured for him to continue. <words>292</words>  

Elias hesitated, then opened the tin, revealing not food but tiny fragments of shattered holograms. <words>308</words>  

“I fix things,” he said. <words>312</words>  

The director nodded, as if this, too, was a kind of performance. <words>324</words>  

And maybe it was. <words>328</words>  

Maybe repairing the broken was its own kind of art, its own kind of story. <words>344</words>  

As the night deepened, Elias stayed, watching, listening, letting the weight of obligation shift into something lighter. <words>364</words>  

Not purpose, not yet—but something close. <words>372</words>  

And for now, that was enough. <words>380</words>
