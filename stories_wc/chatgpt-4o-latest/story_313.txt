Jonas had always been a small-time con artist, but in a world where crops withered under an artificial sun, even deception had lost its luster. <words>22</words>  

The dystopian farm where he scraped by was a patchwork of dying fields and rusted machinery, overseen by silent drones that recorded every movement. <words>44</words>  

He had no grand ambitions—just enough cunning to trade counterfeit ration slips and enough charm to avoid the wrong kind of attention. <words>65</words>  

But lately, something gnawed at him, a lull of remorse creeping in like the dust storms that swallowed the horizon. <words>85</words>  

It wasn’t guilt for the people he’d tricked; they were all just as desperate as he was. <words>101</words>  

No, it was something deeper, something he couldn’t name, something that made him feel unusually normal in a world that had lost its way. <words>126</words>  

So he did what any man in his position would do—he interrogated ghosts. <words>139</words>  

They gathered in the abandoned barn at night, flickering shapes of those who had once tilled the land before the soil turned to poison. <words>162</words>  

Jonas would sit on an overturned crate, an empty tape dispenser in his hands, rolling it between his fingers like a talisman. <words>185</words>  

"Tell me," he’d say, his voice edged with mild fervor, "what’s the trick to living with yourself?" <words>204</words>  

The apparitions never answered directly, only whispered fragments of old stories, half-remembered lullabies, and warnings that came too late. <words>226</words>  

Still, he pressed them, taunting the jaws of defeat and grinning as if daring the past to swallow him whole. <words>247</words>  

One night, as the wind howled through the broken rafters, a ghost in a tattered straw hat finally spoke clearly. <words>268</words>  

"You comfort yourself with lies, boy," it said, its voice like dry leaves rustling. <words>283</words>  

Jonas tightened his grip on the tape dispenser, its emptiness a quiet mockery of his own hollow justifications. <words>304</words>  

"Maybe," he admitted, "but what else is there?" <words>317</words>  

The ghost gestured toward the fields, where skeletal stalks swayed under the artificial glow. <words>334</words>  

"Something real," it murmured, before dissolving into the night. <words>347</words>  

Jonas sat there long after the ghosts had gone, the weight of their words pressing against his ribs. <words>366</words>  

For the first time in years, he didn’t feel like running another con. <words>382</words>  

Instead, he walked to the edge of the farm, where the soil was less dead, and knelt. <words>401</words>  

With careful hands, he dug into the earth, planting something small, something real. <words>419</words>  

The empty tape dispenser lay forgotten in the dust, its purpose spent. <words>433</words>  

And as the artificial sun flickered overhead, Jonas waited, not for a trick, but for something to grow. <words>455</words>
