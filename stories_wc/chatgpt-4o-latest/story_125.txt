Joren slouched in the cracked leather chair, staring at the blinking lights of the abandoned space station control room. <words>14</words>  

The place smelled of rust and old circuitry, a relic of a forgotten era. <words>25</words>  

He drummed his fingers on the console, waiting for the next misdelivered package. <words>36</words>  

It had started as a joke—ordering random items to this derelict station. <words>47</words>  

But then the packages began arriving with eerie precision, each one whispering of something lost. <words>60</words>  

The latest delivery sat before him: a doll head with blinking eyes. <words>71</words>  

It stared at him, its mechanical lids clicking open and shut. <words>82</words>  

Joren sighed, rubbing his temples. <words>86</words>  

He was an underachieving mage, a disappointment to his lineage. <words>96</words>  

Magic had always felt just out of reach, like a language he barely understood. <words>109</words>  

His family had once ruled the arcane arts, but he was exceptionally usual. <words>121</words>  

No grand spells, no legendary feats—just a knack for receiving the wrong mail. <words>134</words>  

The doll head blinked again, and something in its glassy stare unsettled him. <words>146</words>  

He picked it up, turning it over in his hands. <words>154</words>  

A faint hum vibrated through his fingertips. <words>160</words>  

Joren frowned. <words>162</words>  

Magic? <words>163</words>  

He placed the head on the console and traced the sigils etched beneath its scalp. <words>176</words>  

They were old, older than anything he had studied. <words>184</words>  

A whisper curled through the room, threading through the dust-laden air. <words>195</words>  

Joren’s pulse quickened. <words>198</words>  

This wasn’t just another misdelivered oddity. <words>204</words>  

This was a message. <words>207</words>  

The station shuddered as the farmland below neared its final sale. <words>218</words>  

His family’s land, the last remnant of their legacy, would soon be gone. <words>231</words>  

He had told himself he didn’t care. <words>237</words>  

But the packages had been leading him here, hadn’t they? <words>246</words>  

Each one a breadcrumb, guiding him toward something he had ignored. <words>257</words>  

Joren exhaled, his breath fogging in the cold air. <words>266</words>  

It was time to unveil the truth. <words>272</words>  

He pressed his palm against the console, feeling the station’s dormant power stir. <words>285</words>  

The doll head’s eyes flickered wildly, its mouth parting in a silent scream. <words>297</words>  

A surge of energy coursed through him, unraveling the chains of his own limitations. <words>310</words>  

Magic wasn’t about grandeur—it was about connection. <words>318</words>  

And he was connected to this place, to his heritage, to the forgotten power in his blood. <words>332</words>  

The station’s lights flared, illuminating the sigils carved into the walls. <words>343</words>  

This was his inheritance, waiting for him to claim it. <words>352</words>  

Joren straightened, his usual boredom replaced with something sharper. <words>363</words>  

Excitement, edged with the weight of responsibility. <words>369</words>  

He had set a trap for his own doubts, and now they had sprung. <words>381</words>  

The farmland below might be sold, but his legacy would not be erased. <words>393</words>  

Joren reached for the next package, ready to see where it led. <words>404</words>
