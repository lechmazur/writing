The subterranean waterfall roared in the cavern’s depths, its mist curling around the jagged rock formations like ghostly fingers. <words>16</words>  

Elias knelt at the edge, his breath steady despite the cold seeping through his bones. <words>28</words>  

He had spent years interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, tracing patterns in their paranoia. <words>40</words>  

Each desperate voice had been a thread, weaving a map of energy flows hidden beneath the world. <words>53</words>  

Now, in the final second before the ice sculpture collapsed, he had found the heart of it. <words>66</words>  

The sculpture, a towering effigy of interwoven figures, trembled as cracks spiderwebbed through its crystalline surface. <words>79</words>  

Elias reached into his coat and pulled out a simple cloth bookmark, its edges frayed from years of use. <words>93</words>  

It was the only thing he had left from his mother, the woman who had first whispered of hidden societies. <words>107</words>  

She had spoken of those who bound themselves to unseen currents, shaping the world in ways no one understood. <words>121</words>  

He had never believed her—until the voices on the radio began to align too perfectly. <words>133</words>  

The bookmark was his key, a cipher that had led him here, to the waterfall’s edge. <words>145</words>  

He had spent his life as a poison taster, courting death with every sip, hoping one day it would take him. <words>160</words>  

But death had been patient, waiting for him to see the truth before it claimed him. <words>172</words>  

The ice sculpture groaned, its collapse imminent, and Elias pressed the bookmark to the cavern floor. <words>185</words>  

The energy surged beneath his fingertips, a pulse that resonated with something deep inside him. <words>197</words>  

He had always been strangely compelling to others, drawing them in without understanding why. <words>209</words>  

Now he knew—he was a conduit, a living map of the hidden forces shaping the world. <words>222</words>  

The waterfall’s mist thickened, swirling around him as if acknowledging his presence. <words>233</words>  

He had come here to bind the unseen, to tether the currents before they unraveled. <words>245</words>  

The voices had warned of this moment, of the collapse that would either destroy or reveal. <words>257</words>  

The ice sculpture shattered, shards cascading like falling stars, and the cavern trembled. <words>269</words>  

Elias closed his eyes, feeling the energy surge through him, rewriting the map in his mind. <words>281</words>  

For the first time, he did not long for death—he longed to understand. <words>292</words>  

The hidden societies had always been watching, waiting for someone to see what lay beneath. <words>305</words>  

And now, as the waterfall roared and the ice melted into the earth, Elias finally did. <words>318</words>
