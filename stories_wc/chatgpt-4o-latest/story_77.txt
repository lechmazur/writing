The asteroid drifted in the void, its surface pockmarked with the scars of forgotten battles. <words>14</words>  

Inside a hollowed-out cavern, dim lanterns flickered over rusted crates and stolen relics. <words>26</words>  

Joren sat cross-legged on the cold metal floor, his fingers tracing the edges of a dried starfish. <words>40</words>  

It had been a gift from someone long gone, a relic of a world he barely remembered. <words>54</words>  

The space pirate hideout buzzed with murmured deals and clinking glasses, but Joren remained apart. <words>67</words>  

An introverted empath, he felt the weight of every unspoken sorrow in the room. <words>79</words>  

He had come here chasing whispers, seeking the wisdom buried in the mountain of lost souls. <words>93</words>  

The journal before him, its pages brittle with age, held the final words of a forgotten thinker. <words>107</words>  

Joren turned the last page, his breath slow, his mind swimming in drowsy enthusiasm. <words>119</words>  

The words spoke of outcasts—those who saw too much, felt too deeply, reasoned beyond comfort. <words>133</words>  

He had spent years searching for a way to marshal their scattered voices into something stronger. <words>147</words>  

His hands moved instinctively, reassembling fragments of a shattered marionette he had found discarded. <words>161</words>  

Each piece fit together with delicate precision, a puzzle of forgotten craftsmanship. <words>173</words>  

The marionette’s joints clicked into place, its hollow eyes staring back at him. <words>185</words>  

It was obviously hidden, its purpose buried beneath layers of neglect and misunderstanding. <words>198</words>  

Much like the wisdom he sought, it had been broken, scattered, waiting to be restored. <words>212</words>  

The journal’s final passage spoke of a place where reason’s outcasts could find refuge. <words>225</words>  

Joren exhaled, his fingers tightening around the starfish, feeling its brittle resilience. <words>238</words>  

He had spent too long absorbing the pain of others without direction. <words>250</words>  

Now, through the act of reassembling, he understood—wisdom was not found, but rebuilt. <words>263</words>  

The marionette’s strings lay coiled beside it, waiting for a hand to guide them. <words>276</words>  

Joren stood, his shadow stretching across the cavern wall, his purpose finally clear. <words>289</words>  

He would champion those who had been cast aside, those whose voices had been silenced. <words>303</words>  

The pirates around him continued their dealings, unaware of the quiet revolution forming. <words>316</words>  

Joren tucked the journal into his coat, the marionette cradled in his other hand. <words>329</words>  

The wisdom of the mountain was not in solitude, but in the strength of the gathered. <words>343</words>  

He stepped toward the exit, the weight of the starfish grounding him in memory. <words>356</words>  

The asteroid’s tunnels stretched before him, dark and uncertain, but no longer empty. <words>369</words>  

Joren had found his path, and with it, the scattered would rise. <words>381</words>
