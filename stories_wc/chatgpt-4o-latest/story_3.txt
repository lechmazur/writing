The wind howled through the sailor’s graveyard, a desolate stretch of shore where broken masts jutted from the sand like the ribs of forgotten beasts. <words>19</words>  

Gideon, the surly watchman, stood among them, his coat flapping as he fingered a short piece of yarn in his calloused hands. <words>38</words>  

Between seasons, the tides were unpredictable, and he had spent years studying their erratic rhythms, hoping to understand the cosmic patterns that governed them. <words>59</words>  

His grandmother, a weaver of both cloth and wisdom, had taught him a traditional craft—knotting yarn into intricate loops that mirrored the constellations. <words>81</words>  

She had claimed that the sea and sky spoke the same language, and if one listened closely, they could decipher the riddles of fate. <words>102</words>  

Tonight, the air was serenely frantic, the hush before a storm, the quiet chaos of shifting currents and unseen forces. <words>120</words>  

A merchant from the market had once told him that true wisdom was not in knowing answers but in asking the right questions. <words>141</words>  

So Gideon posed his riddle to the wind: “What is it that binds the stars, the sea, and the soul?” <words>157</words>  

The yarn twisted in his fingers as he tied a knot, a pattern his grandmother had called the Sailor’s Eye. <words>175</words>  

A wave crashed against the shore, and in its retreat, something gleamed among the wreckage—a silver locket, half-buried in the sand. <words>196</words>  

He bent down, prying it free, his heart pounding with the weight of unseen hands guiding him. <words>213</words>  

Inside was a scrap of parchment, its ink faded but legible: “The answer is always in the weave.” <words>230</words>  

Gideon exhaled, his surly demeanor softening as understanding dawned. <words>239</words>  

The market wisdom, the riddles, the knots—they were all threads in the same tapestry. <words>254</words>  

The sea did not move in chaos but in a dignified order, a pattern too vast for most to see. <words>273</words>  

He tied another knot, this time with purpose, letting the yarn guide his fingers as the storm gathered on the horizon. <words>293</words>  

The wind whispered through the graveyard, carrying his riddle back to the stars. <words>307</words>
