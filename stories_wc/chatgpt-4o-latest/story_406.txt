The morning paper landed on the empty porch with a dull thud. <words>12</words>  

Inside the witch’s potion brewery, Lucian adjusted his collar, ensuring the loose button remained unnoticed. <words>27</words>  

He was a coy spy, slipping through shadows with a smirk that concealed his true intent. <words>39</words>  

Tonight, he would bypass the barriers of time itself, all to mend fences long broken. <words>52</words>  

The witch, draped in robes of shifting hues, stirred a cauldron bubbling with reversed time. <words>65</words>  

Lucian watched, his fingers grazing the button that had once belonged to his father. <words>78</words>  

His father, a master of disguise, had vanished years ago, leaving only riddles behind. <words>91</words>  

Lucian had spent years chasing whispers, learning the art of deception and transformation. <words>103</words>  

Now, he stood on the precipice of something greater—becoming the master his father was. <words>116</words>  

The witch cackled, her voice both cruel and kind, a diabolically benevolent force of nature. <words>129</words>  

"You seek to mend what was broken," she mused, ladling the shimmering potion into a vial. <words>143</words>  

Lucian nodded, his smirk unwavering, though his heart pounded beneath his carefully composed exterior. <words>156</words>  

"Drink, and time will unravel," she said, pressing the vial into his gloved hand. <words>169</words>  

He hesitated only a moment before tipping the liquid past his lips. <words>180</words>  

The world twisted, colors bleeding into one another as time reversed its course. <words>192</words>  

Lucian found himself standing in a dimly lit study, the scent of ink and leather thick. <words>206</words>  

A man sat at the desk, his fingers deftly sewing a button onto a coat. <words>218</words>  

Lucian’s breath caught—his father, alive, unaware of the son watching from the shadows. <words>231</words>  

He stepped forward, his voice steady despite the storm within. <words>241</words>  

"You always said a disguise is only as strong as its weakest thread." <words>253</words>  

His father looked up, eyes sharp, recognition flickering like a candle in the wind. <words>266</words>  

"You shouldn’t be here," the man murmured, setting the coat aside. <words>277</words>  

Lucian smirked, mirroring the expression he had inherited. <words>287</words>  

"And yet, here I am," he said, holding up the loose button. <words>299</words>  

His father exhaled, a mixture of pride and regret shadowing his face. <words>311</words>  

"You’ve come to mend what I tore apart," he said, voice heavy with borrowed valor. <words>324</words>  

Lucian nodded. "I need to know why you left." <words>332</words>  

His father sighed, running a hand through his graying hair. <words>343</words>  

"To protect you," he admitted. "But I see now that I only made you chase ghosts." <words>357</words>  

Lucian clenched the button, feeling the weight of years between them. <words>369</words>  

"Then let’s fix this," he said, offering his father a chance to return. <words>382</words>  

The man hesitated, then reached for his coat, fastening the newly sewn button. <words>395</words>  

As time surged forward, they stood together in the witch’s brewery once more. <words>407</words>  

The morning paper landed on the empty porch, but this time, the house was no longer empty. <words>421</words>
