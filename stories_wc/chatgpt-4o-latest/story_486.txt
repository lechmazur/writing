The hush of a freshly erased chalkboard settled over the cauldron room, a silence so crisp it felt like a held breath. <words>19</words>  
Elias, a sound engineer with fingers both clumsy and dexterous, traced the rim of a stained glass fragment on the worktable. <words>38</words>  
The shard shimmered, refracting candlelight into fractured spectrums, a relic from a cathedral long since abandoned. <words>51</words>  
He had stolen it, not for beauty, but for its resonance—glass that once caught hymns still hummed with echoes of devotion. <words>69</words>  
Tonight, he would use it to hush the roar of an unstoppable crowd. <words>79</words>  
The city outside boiled with voices, a ceaseless tide of demands, accusations, and fervor. <words>91</words>  
Elias had once reveled in sound, sculpting it like clay, but now it overwhelmed him. <words>105</words>  
He had discovered his gift by accident—how a misplaced frequency could bend reality, how silence could be shaped. <words>123</words>  
Now, he sought retribution, not through violence, but through absence. <words>133</words>  
He lifted the stained glass fragment and held it to his lips, whispering a critique of the world’s relentless noise. <words>151</words>  
The cauldron before him bubbled, thick with the essence of stolen whispers and swallowed words. <words>165</words>  
He had gathered them from pantomime confessions in public squares, where the guilty spoke only in gestures. <words>181</words>  
Their silent admissions had weight, and he had bottled them like rare perfumes. <words>194</words>  
Now, he poured them into the cauldron, watching as the liquid darkened, thickened, stilled. <words>208</words>  
The room held its breath. <words>212</words>  
Elias reached into the cauldron, fingers trembling, and pulled forth a sphere of silence. <words>226</words>  
It pulsed in his palm, a void wrapped in glass, waiting to be unleashed. <words>238</words>  
He stumbled, nearly dropping it, his dexterity failing him at the worst moment. <words>251</words>  
But he caught himself, steadied his grip, and stepped toward the window. <words>263</words>  
Below, the crowd surged, voices crashing like waves against stone. <words>274</words>  
He raised the sphere and let it fall. <words>282</words>  
It shattered upon the cobblestones, and silence rippled outward. <words>293</words>  
The roar of the city collapsed into nothingness, mouths moving without sound. <words>305</words>  
Elias exhaled, watching as confusion spread like ink in water. <words>316</words>  
The world had been too loud, too reckless with its noise. <words>327</words>  
Now, it would learn the weight of quiet. <words>335</words>  
He turned from the window, the stained glass fragment still warm in his hand. <words>348</words>  
Retribution had never needed words. <words>354</words>  
Only silence. <words>356</words>
