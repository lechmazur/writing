Beneath the cobbled expanse of the city plaza, where hurried feet never paused long enough to notice the faint scent of damp earth, a secret dog park thrived in the shadows. <words>22</words>  

Here, among the tangled roots and flickering lanterns, a deserted alchemist named Lior sat cross-legged beside a shallow pond, watching the ripples spread from a stone he had just tossed. <words>48</words>  

The patterns in the rings told him things—things no one else could see, things that whispered of futures unwritten and pasts that refused to die. <words>72</words>  

Tonight, as the scent of brewing tinctures curled through the underground air, he wrestled with a dream that threatened to slip into oblivion. <words>96</words>  

His hands trembled as he unspooled a golden typewriter ribbon, its metallic sheen catching the dim lantern light like a sliver of lost divinity. <words>120</words>  

He had once believed in the transmutation of faith itself, that belief could be distilled, refined, and made tangible—but faith had abandoned him long before he abandoned the world. <words>148</words>  

Now, he sought to reclaim it, to savor its essence once more, to prove that even a forsaken alchemist could still weave miracles from the remnants of his own despair. <words>176</words>  

The dogs, spectral and silent, watched him with knowing eyes, their presence both a comfort and a torment. <words>196</words>  

They were the echoes of those who had once loved without question, creatures who had never needed proof to believe. <words>220</words>  

Lior envied them. <words>222</words>  

He dipped the golden ribbon into the pond, watching as the ripples formed concentric circles, each one a question, each one an answer. <words>248</words>  

Through the patterns, he saw the shape of his own dilemma—faith was not something to be brewed like a potion, nor transcribed like an alchemical formula. <words>276</words>  

It was something to be leapt into, blind and desperate, like a dog chasing a scent through the dark. <words>300</words>  

The realization struck him with an exultant grief, a sorrow so profound it felt like joy. <words>320</words>  

He had spent years searching for proof, for certainty, for a way to make belief tangible, but faith had never been about certainty. <words>348</words>  

It had always been about the leap. <words>360</words>  

The golden ribbon dissolved in the water, its essence dispersing into the ripples, vanishing into the unseen currents below. <words>384</words>  

Lior closed his eyes and let out a breath he had been holding for years. <words>404</words>  

The dogs stirred, their forms flickering like candle flames, and one by one, they vanished into the shadows. <words>428</words>  

He was alone again, but for the first time in years, he did not feel abandoned. <words>450</words>  

Faith had not returned to him. <words>462</words>  

He had returned to it. <words>474</words>  

And that was enough. <words>485</words>
