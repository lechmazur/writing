The grumpy crypt caretaker scowled as he stepped into the witch’s crystal scrying room, the air thick with incense and whispered omens. <words>17</words>  

In his gnarled hands, he clutched an unmarked cardboard tube, its contents unknown even to him. <words>30</words>  

He had found it wedged between the mausoleum stones, where the dead whispered secrets only he could hear. <words>45</words>  

The witch, draped in robes that shimmered like liquid dusk, gestured toward the sand mandala spread across the floor. <words>61</words>  

"Place it there," she murmured, her voice carrying the weight of unseen forces. <words>72</words>  

He hesitated, his fingers tightening around the tube as if it might vanish. <words>84</words>  

"Why?" he grumbled, his voice like gravel scraping against tombstones. <words>95</words>  

"Because the patterns will reveal what you refuse to see," she replied, her gaze piercing. <words>109</words>  

With a reluctant sigh, he set the tube atop the mandala, watching as the witch traced symbols in the sand. <words>126</words>  

The grains shifted, forming intricate spirals that pulsed with an eerie glow. <words>138</words>  

He felt something stir within him, a tremor not of fear but of recognition. <words>151</words>  

The witch’s fingers danced, and the patterns multiplied singular, each shape reflecting a fragment of his past. <words>167</words>  

Memories surged—shadows of battles fought within himself, wounds never tended, ghosts never laid to rest. <words>182</words>  

The crypt had been his refuge, but also his prison. <words>191</words>  

The dead did not judge, but they also did not heal. <words>202</words>  

The witch’s eyes flickered toward the sky, where stars began their slow waltz across the heavens. <words>216</words>  

"Throughout stargazing, the truth emerges," she intoned, her voice a thread in the cosmic loom. <words>230</words>  

The caretaker’s hands trembled as he reached for the tube, jiggling it slightly. <words>243</words>  

The cap loosened, and a cascade of ashes spilled onto the mandala. <words>255</words>  

His breath caught. <words>258</words>  

He knew whose remains these were. <words>263</words>  

The uprising within him roared—a rebellion of grief, guilt, and unspoken sorrow. <words>276</words>  

He had buried too much, not just in the earth, but in himself. <words>288</words>  

The witch’s gaze softened. <words>292</words>  

"Trauma does not vanish," she said. <words>298</words>  

"It must be seen, acknowledged, given form." <words>305</words>  

The patterns in the sand shifted once more, forming a path leading outward. <words>319</words>  

A way forward. <words>322</words>  

The caretaker exhaled, the weight in his chest easing, if only slightly. <words>334</words>  

He gathered the ashes with reverence, stepping beyond the scrying room’s threshold. <words>347</words>  

The stars above bore witness, as they always had. <words>356</words>  

And for the first time in years, he allowed himself to look up. <words>369</words>
