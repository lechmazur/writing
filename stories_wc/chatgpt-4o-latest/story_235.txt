The ancient Japanese castle had been reimagined as an art school, its wooden corridors now lined with canvases instead of armor. <words>19</words>  

In a secluded chamber, Aoki, a remote herbalist, sat with a pressed flower book open before him. <words>33</words>  

He was not a student, nor a teacher, but something in between—an observer who repositioned himself within the school’s quiet spaces. <words>49</words>  

His presence was dramatically subtle, a shadow in the periphery of every art class, never acknowledged yet never unnoticed. <words>63</words>  

The students whispered about him, wondering why he always appeared when ink met paper, when brush met silk. <words>77</words>  

Aoki was waiting, though for what, even he could not fully articulate. <words>85</words>  

His fingers traced the delicate petals pressed between the pages, each flower a remnant of a moment long past. <words>99</words>  

He had gathered them under ephemeral meteor showers, decoding their fleeting patterns to understand the fates intertwined with his own. <words>115</words>  

It was through this method that he had first sensed her presence—Kaede, the artist who never spoke. <words>129</words>  

She painted with a distant intimacy, her brushstrokes whispering secrets that her lips refused to utter. <words>143</words>  

Aoki watched her from the edges of the room, noting the way her hands trembled before finding their rhythm. <words>158</words>  

She, too, repositioned herself constantly, shifting between light and shadow, between presence and absence. <words>171</words>  

Their fates had intertwined long before they had ever met, though neither had acknowledged it aloud. <words>184</words>  

Aoki had seen it in the sky, in the way the meteors danced and vanished, leaving only questions behind. <words>199</words>  

One evening, as the castle’s paper walls glowed with lantern light, he placed his pressed flower book beside her easel. <words>215</words>  

Kaede hesitated, her fingers hovering over the worn leather cover before finally turning the first page. <words>229</words>  

Each flower was a message, a silent conversation woven through time, waiting to be understood. <words>242</words>  

She traced the petals, recognizing the same patterns she had unknowingly painted over and over again. <words>256</words>  

Aoki watched as realization flickered in her eyes, a connection forming without a single word spoken. <words>270</words>  

The next day, she repositioned her canvas, aligning it with the window where the sky could be seen. <words>285</words>  

That night, meteors streaked across the heavens, their fleeting brilliance mirroring the strokes of her brush. <words>299</words>  

Aoki stood beneath the open sky, knowing she was watching too, their fates now fully entwined. <words>312</words>  

Neither spoke, yet the conversation had begun, carried by ink, by petals, by stars. <words>324</words>  

And in the silence, they understood. <words>328</words>
