The floating rock tea house drifted in the hush of improbable beginnings, its wooden beams creaking softly as the currents of unseen forces nudged it along. <words>19</words>  

Inside, Elias adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, their delicate frame slipping down his nose as he studied the jars of jam lining the shelves. <words>40</words>  

Each jar held a different era, a whisper of time preserved in sugared fruit, and he had learned to taste the subtle differences between them. <words>61</words>  

It was his method, his way of understanding human behaviors—how they changed, how they remained the same, how they left traces even in something as simple as jam. <words>88</words>  

He had once been an underwater explorer, drawn to the mysteries of the deep, but the crushing weight of the ocean had always gnawed at him. <words>113</words>  

Claustrophobia had made every dive a battle, every descent a quiet war between curiosity and fear. <words>129</words>  

Now, in the open air of the floating tea house, he felt lighter, though a lightly heavyhearted ache still lingered in his chest. <words>152</words>  

The tea master, an old woman with hands like gnarled roots, watched him with knowing eyes. <words>169</words>  

"You seek something," she murmured, pouring a cup of tea that smelled of distant summers. <words>186</words>  

Elias hesitated before answering. <words>190</words>  

"I want to understand people," he admitted, swirling a spoon through a jar of plum jam. <words>208</words>  

The tea master nodded, as if she had expected this. <words>221</words>  

"Then you must learn how they heal," she said, pushing a small dish toward him. <words>240</words>  

It held a smear of jam, dark and glistening, its scent carrying something both familiar and unknown. <words>259</words>  

Elias dipped a fingertip into it and tasted. <words>270</words>  

Memories unfurled—laughter at a kitchen table, the warmth of a hand on his shoulder, the quiet comfort of being understood. <words>293</words>  

The sensation inflamed something deep within him, not pain, but recognition. <words>308</words>  

"This is..." he started, but the words failed him. <words>320</words>  

The tea master smiled. <words>324</words>  

"Jam is not just fruit and sugar," she said. <words>338</words>  

"It carries the touch of those who made it, their joys, their sorrows, their healing." <words>359</words>  

Elias set down his spoon, his hands steady in a way they hadn't been in years. <words>378</words>  

For the first time, he understood—he had been searching not just for knowledge, but for connection. <words>399</words>  

And here, in this drifting place, he had found it. <words>412</words>
