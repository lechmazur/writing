The suspended palace swayed gently, anchored to the giant stalactites above the abyss. <words>14</words>  

Inside, Alric the Tinkerer adjusted his brass thermometer, frowning at the subtle temperature shift. <words>27</words>  

He had spent years chronicling environmental changes, sculpting intricate devices to measure the world's slow decay. <words>40</words>  

His latest invention, a mechanical canvas, would capture the moment an artist’s brush first met paint. <words>53</words>  

Yet, as he worked, a whisper of mortality crept into his thoughts. <words>63</words>  

The palace had stood for centuries, but even stone eroded, even metal rusted. <words>75</words>  

Alric, oddly truthful even with himself, knew his time was finite. <words>86</words>  

Still, he refused to let impermanence halt his work. <words>95</words>  

He visited the pop-up carnival fortune-tellers that drifted through the palace corridors. <words>108</words>  

Their painted tents shimmered like mirages, their voices weaving practical illusions. <words>119</words>  

One fortune-teller, blind but keen, traced his palm with ink-stained fingers. <words>131</words>  

"You sculpt time itself," she murmured, "but time sculpts you in return." <words>143</words>  

Alric chuckled, though the words settled deep in his bones. <words>154</words>  

He returned to his workshop, where gears clicked in rhythmic defiance of entropy. <words>167</words>  

The brass thermometer gleamed under the lantern light, its needle trembling. <words>178</words>  

He adjusted its casing, ensuring it would endure long after he was gone. <words>191</words>  

His hands, steady yet weathered, guided the artist’s brush to the canvas. <words>203</words>  

The first stroke landed, capturing the precise moment of creation. <words>214</words>  

A record of change, of fleeting existence, of beauty in transience. <words>224</words>  

The palace swayed again, whispering its own slow descent into time’s embrace. <words>237</words>  

Alric smiled, knowing his work would outlast him, even as the stalactites thinned. <words>250</words>  

He had confronted mortality not with fear, but with purpose. <words>260</words>  

And in that, he had sculpted something eternal. <words>268</words>
