The towering labyrinth of shipping containers loomed over the port city, their rusted exteriors whispering forgotten voyages. <words>14</words>  

Among them, an aloof page named Lior wandered, his fingers tracing the peeling paint of a blue container. <words>28</words>  

He was predictably odd, always lost in thought, always searching for something others dismissed as myth. <words>41</words>  

This time, it was a deep-sea diver’s logbook, rumored to contain secrets buried beneath the waves. <words>55</words>  

An unexpected delay—his contact failing to arrive—led him to a chance meeting with an old dockworker. <words>69</words>  

The man, wrapped in the scent of salt and rust, eyed Lior with knowing amusement. <words>82</words>  

“You’re looking for the logbook, aren’t you?” the dockworker asked, his voice rough as the tide. <words>96</words>  

Lior’s curiosity, unstoppable as ever, sharpened. <words>101</words>  

“I am,” he admitted, his tone measured, though his pulse quickened. <words>112</words>  

The dockworker chuckled, pulling a battered notebook from his coat. <words>122</words>  

“Found this wedged between two containers last season,” he said. <words>133</words>  

Lior took it carefully, its leather cover warped by time and brine. <words>144</words>  

Flipping through the pages, he saw cryptic entries detailing dives into impossible depths. <words>156</words>  

One passage caught his breath: a map, half-erased, leading to something called the Abyssal Crown. <words>169</words>  

The words pulsed with an eerie familiarity, as if whispering directly to him. <words>180</words>  

Across the lull of a wounded season, he had searched for meaning in forgotten texts. <words>193</words>  

Now, he had a piece of something larger, something waiting to be reconstructed. <words>205</words>  

The dockworker watched him with a knowing smirk. <words>211</words>  

“Reclaiming power, are we?” he mused. <words>217</words>  

Lior met his gaze, the weight of realization settling in his chest. <words>228</words>  

“Yes,” he said, closing the logbook with quiet reverence. <words>238</words>  

The labyrinth of containers stretched before him, a maze of past and future entwined. <words>251</words>  

He would pierce the illusions, unravel the mystery, and reclaim what had been lost. <words>263</words>  

With the logbook in hand, he stepped forward, the scent of salt thick in the air. <words>276</words>  

The past whispered through the pages, but the future was his to write. <words>287</words>
