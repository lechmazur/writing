The last library card slid across the desk, its plastic surface worn from years of use. <words>14</words>  

Above the city of clouds, where streets were woven from mist, Elias waited. <words>27</words>  

His phone rang at midnight, as it always did, the voice on the other end cryptic. <words>40</words>  

"Refashion the past," it whispered, "or be swallowed by it." <words>48</words>  

Elias, a professional scapegoat for hire, had spent years shouldering the sins of others. <words>60</words>  

He erased identities, absorbed blame, and left no trace of those who paid him. <words>72</words>  

But tonight, the job was different—it was his own past he had to erase. <words>85</words>  

A metal washer sat in his palm, its surface smooth yet worn, robustly delicate. <words>98</words>  

It was the last remnant of the life he had abandoned. <words>107</words>  

The washer had once held together the door of a home he no longer claimed. <words>120</words>  

He turned it over between his fingers, feeling the weight of forgotten choices. <words>132</words>  

The voice on the phone had given him coordinates, deep within the cloud city. <words>145</words>  

He moved through the mist-laden streets, his steps silent, his mind obsessively calm. <words>158</words>  

The symbols had haunted him for years—etched into walls, carved into memories. <words>171</words>  

They were sacred, indecipherable, and yet he knew they held the key to his past. <words>185</words>  

He reached the designated alley, where the fog curled like whispers around his feet. <words>198</words>  

A wall stood before him, covered in the same symbols that had plagued his dreams. <words>212</words>  

He pressed the washer against one of the markings, feeling a vibration beneath his fingers. <words>226</words>  

The wall shifted, revealing a hidden passage, and Elias stepped inside. <words>237</words>  

The air was thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten ink. <words>248</words>  

Shelves lined the walls, filled with books that had never been checked out. <words>261</words>  

At the center of the room stood a desk, and on it, a single open book. <words>275</words>  

The pages were filled with the same symbols, but now, they made sense. <words>288</words>  

They told the story of a man who had erased himself to protect the truth. <words>302</words>  

Elias traced the words, realizing they were his own, written long ago. <words>314</words>  

He had been here before, had chosen to forget, had refashioned himself into a ghost. <words>328</words>  

The phone rang again, the voice softer this time. <words>336</words>  

"You have found what you sought. Will you erase it again?" <words>347</words>  

Elias hesitated, the washer still warm in his hand. <words>356</words>  

For the first time, he considered keeping the truth instead of burying it. <words>369</words>  

The mist outside thickened, the city shifting as if waiting for his decision. <words>382</words>  

He closed the book, tucked the washer into his pocket, and stepped back into the fog. <words>396</words>  

This time, he would not abandon himself. <words>402</words>
