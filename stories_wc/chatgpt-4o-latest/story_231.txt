The shepherd stood at the crumbling gates of the ancient Sumerian palace, his fingers tracing the antique hairpin tucked into his belt. <words>19</words>  

He had found it buried in the sands, a relic of a forgotten queen, and now it gleamed under the rising sun. <words>38</words>  

The anchor of a great ship lifted in the nearby harbor, signaling the beginning of its maiden voyage. <words>53</words>  

He took it as an omen—justice, like the sea, was unpredictable, and today, he would pay its price. <words>72</words>  

His flock grazed behind him, oblivious to the storm brewing in his heart. <words>85</words>  

He was habitually spontaneous, a man who welcomed chaos as a teacher, and today was no different. <words>104</words>  

The coordinates had arrived at dawn, scrawled on a scrap of parchment tucked beneath a lamb’s wool. <words>123</words>  

He had read them once, twice, then burned the paper, committing the numbers to memory. <words>140</words>  

Now, he stepped forward, past the palace’s threshold, where shadows whispered of forgotten betrayals. <words>157</words>  

Inside, the air was thick with incense and the weight of unspoken truths. <words>172</words>  

A figure emerged from the gloom, draped in robes of deep indigo, eyes sharp as obsidian. <words>191</words>  

"You are late," the stranger said, voice like shifting sand. <words>204</words>  

The shepherd grinned, his spontaneity a shield against the gravity of the moment. <words>221</words>  

"Justice waits for no man, yet here I stand," he boasted, though his heart pounded. <words>240</words>  

The stranger studied him, then gestured toward a low table where a single cup of wine sat. <words>259</words>  

"Drink, and we shall speak of debts unpaid." <words>270</words>  

The shepherd hesitated, then lifted the cup, the hairpin pressing against his side. <words>287</words>  

He drank deeply, the bitterness coating his tongue like regret. <words>300</words>  

"You seek justice," the stranger murmured, "but do you know its cost?" <words>315</words>  

The shepherd exhaled, his grip tightening on the hairpin. <words>328</words>  

"I have lost a brother to a king’s greed," he said. <words>341</words>  

The stranger nodded, as if he had already known. <words>354</words>  

"Then you understand," he said, "that justice is never free." <words>371</words>  

The shepherd’s pulse quickened. <words>380</words>  

"What must I pay?" <words>387</words>  

The stranger smiled, slow and knowing. <words>398</words>  

"Your flock, your freedom, your name." <words>411</words>  

The shepherd laughed, a sound both bitter and free. <words>426</words>  

"Then take them," he said, "for I have already given them to the wind." <words>445</words>  

The stranger nodded, and the palace trembled as if the gods themselves had heard. <words>462</words>  

Outside, the ship sailed toward the horizon, carrying its own price into the unknown. <words>479</words>
