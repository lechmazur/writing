The wind howled through the xenobiology research station as Elise tightened her coat, watching the migration of clouds shift in unnatural patterns. <words>19</words>  

She had spent years chasing fragments of her past, a lost heiress to a fortune she barely remembered. <words>35</words>  

Her only clue was an old parking stub, its ink faded but still legible enough to suggest a place she had once been. <words>54</words>  

She clenched it in her gloved hand, bitterly optimistic that this detour to avoid traffic would finally unify the pieces of her fractured reality. <words>78</words>  

The overlook had been an accident, a scenic stop she hadn’t planned, but something about the view unsettled her. <words>96</words>  

Below, the research station sprawled across the valley, its silver domes gleaming under the shifting sky. <words>110</words>  

She had never been here before—or so she thought—but the place felt like a memory trying to surface. <words>129</words>  

Elise moved with reckless precision, descending the rocky path toward the facility, her breath sharp in the cold air. <words>147</words>  

The security at the entrance barely glanced at her, as if she belonged, and she stepped inside without hesitation. <words>165</words>  

The walls hummed with unseen energy, and the air smelled of sterile metal and something faintly organic. <words>181</words>  

She followed the corridors instinctively, her fingers brushing against the smooth surfaces as if seeking confirmation of their reality. <words>200</words>  

A door slid open ahead, revealing a lab filled with containment tanks, each holding something alien yet familiar. <words>218</words>  

Her pulse quickened as she approached one of the tanks, pressing her palm against the glass. <words>233</words>  

Inside, a shifting form mirrored her movements, its translucent skin rippling like the migrating clouds above. <words>251</words>  

A voice behind her made her turn sharply. <words>257</words>  

“You shouldn’t be here,” said a man in a lab coat, his expression unreadable. <words>271</words>  

Elise held up the parking stub. <words>276</words>  

“This is the only thing I have left of my past,” she said. <words>289</words>  

The man studied it, then exhaled. <words>296</words>  

“You were here before,” he admitted. <words>303</words>  

Her stomach tightened. <words>306</words>  

“What happened to me?” she demanded. <words>314</words>  

He hesitated, then gestured toward the tank. <words>323</words>  

“You were part of an experiment,” he said. <words>332</words>  

Elise’s breath caught. <words>336</words>  

“The research was meant to push the limits of possibility,” he continued. <words>349</words>  

“But something went wrong.” <words>353</words>  

She stared at the shifting form in the tank, realization dawning. <words>366</words>  

The fragments of her past weren’t just memories—they were pieces of something undone, something incomplete. <words>386</words>  

She had been split, scattered across realities, and now she had found the place where it all began. <words>406</words>  

Her fingers curled into a fist. <words>412</words>  

“I want to be whole again,” she said. <words>423</words>  

The man nodded slowly. <words>428</words>  

“Then we have work to do.” <words>434</words>  

Outside, the clouds continued their migration, shifting like echoes of a reality waiting to be unified. <words>452</words>
