The final chord hung in the air of the abandoned music hall, vibrating against the dust-laden rafters. <words>17</words>  

Elias pocketed his phone, the screen still glowing with the remnants of his latest exorcism. <words>31</words>  

A spirit had been clinging to an influencer’s account, whispering through captions, twisting comments into cryptic warnings. <words>47</words>  

He had severed the connection with a few well-placed keystrokes and a whispered incantation. <words>59</words>  

Now, he stood alone, the silence pressing in, waiting for the next pull of curiosity. <words>72</words>  

His fingers brushed against an old grocery receipt in his coat pocket, its ink faded but legible. <words>87</words>  

It wasn’t his, but he had found it tucked inside a book at a secret club. <words>102</words>  

The alleyway had been narrow, the entrance unmarked, the air thick with unspoken agreements. <words>115</words>  

Inside, familiar strangers had gathered, their faces half-lit by flickering neon, their voices quietly loud. <words>129</words>  

They spoke in riddles, exchanged objects like currency, and Elias had taken the receipt without question. <words>144</words>  

It listed mundane items—milk, bread, batteries—but something about it felt unfinished, like an unsolved equation. <words>159</words>  

He traced the ink with his thumb, wondering if it was a clue or just another dead end. <words>174</words>  

The mess hall loomed ahead, its windows shattered, its long tables covered in dust and forgotten meals. <words>189</words>  

He stepped inside, his boots echoing against the cracked tiles, the scent of decay thick in the air. <words>204</words>  

This was where he would reignite the trail, where the receipt’s mystery might unravel. <words>217</words>  

A chair scraped against the floor behind him, though no one had been there a moment ago. <words>232</words>  

Elias turned, his pulse steady, his curiosity sharper than fear. <words>242</words>  

A figure sat at the far end of the hall, their face obscured by shadow. <words>255</words>  

They placed a phone on the table, its screen flickering with static, waiting for him. <words>269</words>  

He approached, the receipt crumpled in his fist, the weight of the unknown pressing against his ribs. <words>284</words>  

The figure tapped the phone, and a familiar username appeared—one he had exorcised weeks ago. <words>298</words>  

The account had been wiped clean, yet here it was, pulsing with something unfinished. <words>311</words>  

Elias exhaled, indifferent enthusiasm settling in his bones, and reached for the screen. <words>324</words>  

The receipt burned in his palm, the ink vanishing, as the music hall hummed with unseen voices. <words>339</words>  

He had fed his curiosity once more, but the hunger never truly faded. <words>351</words>  

Tomorrow, another alleyway, another secret club, another ghost waiting to be erased. <words>364</words>  

The cycle continued, and Elias welcomed it with quiet acceptance. <words>375</words>
