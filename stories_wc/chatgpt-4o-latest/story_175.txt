The aged minstrel arrived at the mushroom village under a sky bruised with twilight. <words>10</words>  

His cloak, once embroidered with golden thread, now hung in tattered silence. <words>20</words>  

In his hands, he carried an empty birdcage, its bars rusted with time. <words>30</words>  

The villagers, small and sprightly, watched him with eyes both wary and curious. <words>41</words>  

He had come seeking forbidden knowledge, whispered only in the damp hollows of the elder fungi. <words>54</words>  

Each night, he sat beneath the village’s ancient sign, its paint chipped and peeling. <words>66</words>  

With a voice both weary and sharp, he explained the nature of illusions. <words>77</words>  

"See how the paint fades?" he would say, tracing the cracks with a gnarled finger. <words>90</words>  

"Once, this sign gleamed, promising a village untouched by time." <words>99</words>  

The villagers, innocently mischievous, would giggle and prod at his words. <words>110</words>  

"But time gnaws at all things," he continued, "even the truths we hold sacred." <words>122</words>  

One child, bold and bright-eyed, pointed at the empty birdcage. <words>132</words>  

"What was in there?" she asked, tilting her head. <words>140</words>  

"A nightingale," the minstrel replied, his voice laced with something unreadable. <words>151</words>  

"Did it escape?" another child asked, eyes wide with wonder. <words>160</words>  

"No," he murmured, "it sang until it forgot why it sang at all." <words>171</words>  

The village elder, a mushroom taller than the rest, frowned. <words>180</words>  

"You speak of things best left buried," the elder warned. <words>189</words>  

The minstrel only smiled, his teeth like the moon behind clouds. <words>199</words>  

"Buried things have a way of surfacing," he said, voice soft as moss. <words>210</words>  

Each night, he returned to the sign, comparing its decay to the village’s traditions. <words>223</words>  

"Once, you feared the dark," he told them. <words>231</words>  

"Now, you dance beneath it, unafraid." <words>237</words>  

The children laughed, twirling in the glow of bioluminescent spores. <words>247</words>  

The elder watched, silent, knowing the minstrel unraveled more than just stories. <words>259</words>  

One night, the minstrel found the child who had asked about the birdcage. <words>271</words>  

She sat alone, tracing patterns in the damp earth. <words>279</words>  

"Do you still wonder about the nightingale?" he asked. <words>288</words>  

She nodded, eyes reflecting the village’s soft glow. <words>296</words>  

"It was never caged," he admitted, setting the birdcage down. <words>306</words>  

"Then why carry it?" she asked, voice barely above a whisper. <words>316</words>  

"To remind myself," he said, "that some prisons are invisible." <words>326</words>  

The child frowned, considering his words. <words>332</words>  

"Like the old stories?" she asked. <words>338</words>  

"Exactly," he said, smiling. <words>344</words>  

The next morning, the minstrel was gone, the birdcage left behind. <words>354</words>  

The village elder sighed, knowing the minstrel had taken something intangible with him. <words>367</words>  

The children, however, only saw an empty cage, rusted and forgotten. <words>378</words>  

And beneath the village’s sign, the paint chipped a little more. <words>388</words>
