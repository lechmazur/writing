Lord Evander drifted through the endless corn maze, his faded scarf fluttering in the spectral wind. <words>14</words>  

The haunted plain stretched beyond sight, its eerie silence broken only by the rustling stalks. <words>27</words>  

He had received an unexpected invitation—an elegant note sealed with wax, promising a spontaneous event. <words>41</words>  

Evander, a noble of waning influence, had accepted out of sheer ennui. <words>51</words>  

His life, once gilded with purpose, had dulled into a series of meaningless gestures. <words>64</words>  

Yet, the note had intrigued him, hinting at something beyond his usual tedium. <words>77</words>  

He wandered deeper, the maze twisting in ways that defied logic. <words>88</words>  

The corn whispered secrets, though no creature yet lived to understand them. <words>100</words>  

Before sentience, before history, there was only the weight of intention. <words>111</words>  

Evander had come to discover if intention alone could shape reality. <words>123</words>  

A flickering lantern appeared ahead, illuminating a clearing where figures stood waiting. <words>136</words>  

They were draped in garments of forgotten eras, their faces obscured by shadow. <words>149</words>  

One figure stepped forward, a woman with naively sophisticated grace. <words>160</words>  

Her voice was both knowing and innocent, as if wisdom had not yet betrayed her. <words>174</words>  

"You seek the power of intention," she said, her tone laced with ironic awe. <words>188</words>  

Evander smirked, adjusting his scarf. "I seek something to make existence bearable." <words>201</words>  

She gestured to a table set with goblets of shimmering liquid. <words>212</words>  

"Drink, and we shall rendezvous beyond the veil of meaning." <words>224</words>  

Evander hesitated, then lifted a goblet, its contents reflecting the endless maze. <words>237</words>  

As he drank, laughter erupted—shared, unbidden, and strangely familiar. <words>248</words>  

The figures laughed, the corn laughed, even the wind seemed to chuckle. <words>260</words>  

Evander found himself laughing too, though he did not know why. <words>272</words>  

The woman leaned close, her breath warm against the cold night. <words>284</words>  

"Intention is not power," she whispered. "It is merely the first ripple." <words>297</words>  

The maze shifted, the paths unraveling into infinite possibilities. <words>308</words>  

Evander felt weightless, as if he had never been bound by time. <words>320</words>  

His faded scarf slipped from his shoulders, carried away by unseen hands. <words>333</words>  

The laughter swelled, folding into itself, becoming something more. <words>344</words>  

Evander understood then—intention did not shape reality; it merely invited it. <words>357</words>  

The figures faded, the maze dissolved, and he stood alone in the void. <words>370</words>  

Yet, the laughter remained, echoing through the nothingness, waiting to be heard. <words>383</words>  

Evander smiled, his ennui replaced by something dangerously close to wonder. <words>395</words>  

And with that, the first creature stirred, reaching toward the sound. <words>407</words>
