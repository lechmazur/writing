The hush of a half-lit corridor pressed against Elias’s ears as he traced the edges of the seashell in his palm, its strange symbol pulsing under his fingertips. <words>22</words>  

He had found it buried beneath a stack of forgotten tomes, its presence whispering of something beyond mere coincidence. <words>38</words>  

Elias was an outcast scholar, dismissed from the academy for theories deemed too erratic, too impossible. <words>51</words>  

Yet, he knew the truth lay in the spaces between accepted knowledge, in the echoes of things unseen. <words>67</words>  

The seashell was proof—proof that souls could mirror, that something beyond flesh and bone connected people in ways no one dared to admit. <words>90</words>  

He had spent months chasing fragments of forgotten lore, his only guide the diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom. <words>113</words>  

Each entry, scrawled in a hand both desperate and precise, spoke of a witch’s flying carpet garage where lost things found their way home. <words>140</words>  

Elias had to see it for himself. <words>146</words>  

The corridor led him to a rusted door, its handle worn smooth by hands before his. <words>161</words>  

He pushed it open, stepping into a cavernous space where carpets hung like sleeping beasts, their fibers shimmering with latent magic. <words>185</words>  

A woman stood among them, her gaze sharp yet strangely trustworthy, as if she had been expecting him. <words>204</words>  

“You carry something that does not belong to you,” she said, her voice a current beneath the still air. <words>223</words>  

Elias held up the seashell, its symbol glowing faintly in response. <words>235</words>  

“I need to understand,” he said, his voice steady despite the frantic peace thrumming in his chest. <words>252</words>  

The woman stepped closer, her fingers brushing the shell’s surface. <words>265</words>  

“It mirrors the soul,” she murmured. <words>273</words>  

Elias felt a jolt, as if something inside him had been yanked forward, exposed. <words>289</words>  

Memories not his own flickered behind his eyes—lives lived, choices made, regrets carried. <words>305</words>  

He staggered, gripping the nearest carpet for balance. <words>316</words>  

The woman watched, unshaken. <words>323</words>  

“Midnight only lasts so long,” she said. <words>334</words>  

Elias gasped, the words striking something deep within him. <words>348</words>  

He had spent years believing in endless darkness, in exile without reprieve. <words>363</words>  

But the diaries, the shell, the witch—they all pointed to something else. <words>380</words>  

A cycle, a reflection, a truth waiting to be reclaimed. <words>394</words>  

He straightened, the weight of understanding settling over him. <words>408</words>  

The woman nodded, as if he had passed some unspoken test. <words>421</words>  

“Come,” she said, gesturing to a carpet unfurling before them. <words>435</words>  

Elias stepped forward, leaving the hush of the corridor behind. <words>449</words>  

The night would end. <words>453</words>  

And he would be ready. <words>458</words>
