The greenhouse labyrinth pulsed with humid breath, its glass walls fogged by the exhalations of monstrous flora. <words>14</words>  

Joaquin, a docile bruiser with fists like stone, moved disturbingly calm through the twisting corridors of vines. <words>28</words>  

He had come for the conductor’s baton, rumored to raise the dead, but the plants had other plans. <words>41</words>  

Somewhere beyond the tangled paths, amid distant drum solos from an unseen source, the artifact waited. <words>53</words>  

Joaquin’s motivation was simple: to mold a myth from the mud of reality, to prove legends could breathe. <words>66</words>  

The shredded treasure map, found beneath the floorboards of a forgotten chapel, had led him here. <words>78</words>  

Piecing it together had been an ordeal, each fragment a whisper of danger and promise. <words>90</words>  

Now, as he twisted through the labyrinth, the language barrier between him and the map’s cryptic symbols gnawed at him. <words>104</words>  

He had never been good with words, but his fists spoke fluently in the dialect of survival. <words>116</words>  

A vine lashed out, its thorns glistening with venom, but Joaquin caught it midair and snapped it. <words>129</words>  

The plant shrieked—a soundless vibration in the air—alerting its brethren to the intruder’s presence. <words>141</words>  

Joaquin pressed forward, his breath steady, his mind locked on the baton’s promise. <words>152</words>  

The myth said it could summon the dead, but Joaquin didn’t want ghosts—he wanted proof. <words>165</words>  

Reality had always been too rigid, too unwilling to bend to the weight of belief. <words>177</words>  

He would change that. <words>180</words>  

A clearing opened before him, a pedestal at its heart, the baton resting atop it like a king’s scepter. <words>194</words>  

The plants recoiled, sensing the artifact’s power, their hunger momentarily stilled by reverence or fear. <words>206</words>  

Joaquin stepped forward, his fingers brushing the baton’s polished surface. <words>215</words>  

The drum solos intensified, a rhythm that seemed to sync with his heartbeat. <words>226</words>  

Then, a final twist—his hand closed around the baton, and the air thickened with unseen energy. <words>239</words>  

The labyrinth trembled, vines writhing, the very walls of the greenhouse groaning under the weight of something awakening. <words>253</words>  

Joaquin raised the baton, unsure of the words to command it, but knowing that language had never been his strength. <words>267</words>  

Instead, he let his intent speak, his will shaping the myth into something tangible. <words>278</words>  

The ground split, mud bubbling, and from the earth rose figures—half-formed, caught between decay and rebirth. <words>291</words>  

They did not speak, but Joaquin understood them. <words>298</words>  

They were proof. <words>301</words>  

The myth had been molded, and reality had no choice but to listen. <words>312</words>
