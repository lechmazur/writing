The neon cathedral hummed with artificial light, its stained-glass windows replaced by shifting holograms of forgotten myths. <words>19</words>  

A wary explorer named Cass moved through the cavernous space, her boots echoing against the polished obsidian floor. <words>36</words>  

She clutched a damaged music CD in her gloved hand, its surface marred by scratches that distorted the melodies trapped within. <words>55</words>  

Cass had always been loudly introverted, her voice carrying weight even when she spoke to no one but herself. <words>74</words>  

Now, she muttered under her breath, tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog that curled through the cathedral’s pews. <words>96</words>  

The fireflies pulsed like dying stars, guiding her toward the altar where emblems of courage lay scattered like forgotten relics. <words>117</words>  

Each emblem bore the mark of those who had once dared to defy silence, to carve stories into the bones of time. <words>138</words>  

But the last human story had already been written, and Cass had come seeking something else—her own lost courage. <words>159</words>  

She meandered between the pews, her fingers brushing against the cold metal of abandoned offerings, her breath uneven. <words>179</words>  

The cathedral had once been a place of worship, but now it was a mausoleum for voices that had faded into static. <words>200</words>  

Cass placed the damaged CD onto the altar, her reflection warping in its cracked surface. <words>216</words>  

She had found it buried beneath the ruins of an old archive, its label smudged but still legible: "Echoes of the Brave." <words>239</words>  

A name she barely remembered, a song she had once known by heart. <words>253</words>  

She hesitated, then pressed the disc into an ancient player embedded in the altar’s stone. <words>271</words>  

The machine whirred, struggling against time’s decay, and then—sound. <words>285</words>  

A fractured melody spilled into the cathedral, warped but unmistakable, a voice she had not heard in years. <words>305</words>  

It was her own, recorded long ago, before fear had settled into her bones like a second skin. <words>325</words>  

She had sung of fireflies and fog, of neon light and the weight of forgotten stories. <words>344</words>  

The emblems of courage shimmered in response, their edges glowing as if awakening from slumber. <words>363</words>  

Cass closed her eyes, letting the music fill the hollow spaces inside her. <words>379</words>  

She had come seeking courage, but she had not expected to find it in the echo of her own voice. <words>400</words>  

The fireflies swirled around her, their flickering bodies tracing a path forward, out of the cathedral, into the unknown. <words>423</words>  

With crooked hope, she followed. <words>428</words>
