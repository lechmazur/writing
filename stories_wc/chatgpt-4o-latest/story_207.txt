Joren stood in the abandoned space station’s medical bay, the hum of the universe vibrating through the metal walls. <words>16</words>  

He was a peddler, a trader of forgotten things, but today he sought something beyond barter. <words>30</words>  

In his hands, he clutched a dried flower bouquet, its petals brittle yet stubbornly clinging to their stems. <words>44</words>  

It had once been a gift, a token of love before he had sealed his fate with a blood-bound oath. <words>60</words>  

Now, he sought redemption, a way to break the promise that had shackled him for years. <words>73</words>  

The station had long been abandoned, its sterile halls now coated in dust and echoes of the past. <words>88</words>  

Joren had followed whispers, sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns to find this place. <words>101</words>  

They spoke of a forgotten healer, one who had once mended wounds beyond flesh and bone. <words>115</words>  

He had to divide truth from fiction, separating myth from reality with careful precision. <words>128</words>  

His meekly assertive nature had served him well in negotiations, but now it was all he had to push forward. <words>145</words>  

He stepped toward an old examination table, its surface cracked but still sturdy. <words>157</words>  

The bouquet trembled in his grip as he placed it down, a symbol of what he had lost. <words>172</words>  

He had sworn an oath in blood to a man who no longer walked among the stars. <words>186</words>  

That promise had cost him everything—his freedom, his love, his very sense of self. <words>200</words>  

But oaths, like flowers, could wither, and he had come to see if they could also be undone. <words>215</words>  

The station hummed around him, the universe’s secret song filling the silence. <words>227</words>  

Joren closed his eyes, recalling the words he had spoken so long ago. <words>239</words>  

He had pledged loyalty, sworn to never return to the life he had once known. <words>253</words>  

Yet here he was, standing in defiance of his own past. <words>264</words>  

A soft chime echoed through the bay, a flicker of power surging through the station’s systems. <words>279</words>  

Joren turned, heart pounding, as a screen flickered to life. <words>290</words>  

A message, old yet waiting, scrolled across the display. <words>301</words>  

"Redemption is not given, but chosen." <words>306</words>  

He exhaled, the weight of years pressing against his chest. <words>318</words>  

He reached for the bouquet, fingers brushing against the fragile petals. <words>330</words>  

With deliberate care, he began to pull them apart, dividing each stem, each memory. <words>345</words>  

The oath had been sealed in blood, but perhaps it could be broken in dust. <words>358</words>  

As the last petal crumbled, the station’s hum deepened, resonating with something unseen. <words>372</words>  

Joren felt lighter, as if the universe itself had acknowledged his choice. <words>385</words>  

He turned toward the exit, stepping forward into the unknown, unburdened at last. <words>398</words>  

The stars awaited, and for the first time in years, he was free. <words>410</words>
