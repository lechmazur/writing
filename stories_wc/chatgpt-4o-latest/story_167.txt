The capsule hotel for time travelers hummed with a quiet anticipation, the air thick with the calm that settles before a crucial test. <words>19</words>  

Inside one of the narrow pods, Edris, a dutiful scholar, traced the edge of a small wire coil between his fingers. <words>38</words>  

It was uncommonly typical—just a simple loop of metal—but in his hands, it carried the weight of an unspoken heart. <words>58</words>  

He had spent years studying the forbidden tale, a story erased from history, its echoes buried in the past. <words>77</words>  

Tonight, he would let it be told. <words>82</words>  

The capsule walls pulsed with dim blue light as he activated the transmission device, his breath steady despite the enormity of his task. <words>104</words>  

The well was deep, its stones slick with time, and the voice that lingered there was waiting. <words>123</words>  

Edris had discovered it by accident, a whisper carried by the echo of a voice in an old well. <words>144</words>  

It had spoken of betrayal, of love denied, of a truth that had been deliberately contaminated. <words>162</words>  

The scholars before him had erased it, fearing its power, but Edris could not let it remain buried. <words>182</words>  

He placed the wire coil against the capsule’s receiver, tuning the frequency to the past. <words>198</words>  

A voice, distant yet clear, rose from the depths of time. <words>210</words>  

“They silenced me,” it murmured, the words trembling like ripples on still water. <words>226</words>  

Edris closed his eyes, feeling the weight of history pressing against his ribs. <words>241</words>  

The tale unfolded in fragments—an unrecorded love, a betrayal that reshaped an empire, a truth too dangerous to be known. <words>263</words>  

He felt the contamination of history itself, the deliberate erasure of what should have endured. <words>280</words>  

The voice wavered, as if sensing its final chance to be heard. <words>294</words>  

Edris pressed his palm against the capsule’s control panel, recording every syllable. <words>310</words>  

The past was not silent; it had only been waiting for someone to listen. <words>326</words>  

As the transmission ended, the coil in his hand grew warm, as if carrying the pulse of the lost story. <words>347</words>  

He exhaled, knowing that by morning, the truth would be set free. <words>362</words>  

The capsule hotel remained still, its travelers unaware of the history shifting beneath them. <words>379</words>  

Edris lay back, the weight of duty and defiance settling into his bones. <words>394</words>  

The unspoken heart of the past had finally found its voice. <words>407</words>
