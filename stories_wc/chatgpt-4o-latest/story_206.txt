The forgotten market lay in ruins, its stalls abandoned, its wares dust-choked relics of a time before the rebellion. <words>19</words>  

Among the wreckage, Lucian knelt, his fingers tracing the delicate curves of a shattered sugar sculpture. <words>32</words>  

Once, his hands had crafted wonders—delicate dragons, crystalline roses—but now they shaped only vengeance. <words>46</words>  

He had been a candy sculptor, renowned for his precisely creative artistry, until the rebellion stole everything. <words>61</words>  

His sister had vanished in the chaos, leaving behind only a forgotten locket, its chain broken, its secret lost. <words>76</words>  

Lucian clenched it now, the metal warm from his grip, his heart burning with ardent scorn. <words>89</words>  

Rumors spoke of a hidden continent, a place untouched by war, where the lost might be found. <words>103</words>  

He had to reach it, but first, he needed answers—answers buried in the past. <words>116</words>  

A trail of photographs had begun appearing in the market, each one leading him deeper into memory. <words>130</words>  

The first showed his sister, laughing beside a stall selling candied oranges. <words>141</words>  

The second, a blurred figure slipping something into her hand. <words>150</words>  

The third, a shadowed alley where she had last been seen. <words>160</words>  

Someone was guiding him, an anonymous kindness threading through the wreckage of his grief. <words>173</words>  

But kindness alone would not bring justice. <words>180</words>  

He had spent years honing his craft, and now he would use it to counterattack. <words>194</words>  

His sugar sculptures became weapons—hollowed figures filled with poison, delicate shards sharp as razors. <words>208</words>  

He left them where the rebellion’s oppressors gathered, their beauty irresistible, their sweetness fatal. <words>222</words>  

Yet the photographs continued, leading him beyond vengeance, toward something deeper. <words>234</words>  

One night, he found a final image—a ship, its sails marked with an unfamiliar crest. <words>248</words>  

Beneath it, a note: "She is waiting." <words>255</words>  

Lucian’s breath caught. <words>258</words>  

The hidden continent was real. <words>262</words>  

And his sister was there. <words>266</words>  

He abandoned the ruins, the rebellion, the vendetta that had consumed him. <words>278</words>  

The forgotten market faded behind him as he followed the trail to the unknown. <words>291</words>  

The locket, once a symbol of loss, now held the promise of reunion. <words>304</words>  

He would find her. <words>308</words>  

And perhaps, in the end, he would find himself. <words>317</words>
