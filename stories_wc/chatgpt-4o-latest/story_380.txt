The forgotten library inside the treehouse groaned as the wind pressed against its wooden ribs. <words>14</words>  

Inside, Elias flipped through a flimsy photo album, its pages curling at the edges. <words>26</words>  

The images within were blurred, as if the memories they held had been stolen. <words>38</words>  

He knew this because he had stolen them himself, once upon a time. <words>50</words>  

A convicted dream thief, Elias had spent years siphoning fragments of others’ minds. <words>62</words>  

Now, his own thoughts were a shattered mosaic, pieces missing, edges jagged. <words>74</words>  

He sat cross-legged on the warped floorboards, muttering equations he could never solve. <words>87</words>  

Numbers slipped through his grasp like sand, mocking his mathematically challenged mind. <words>99</words>  

Outside, the sky stretched vast and empty, thunderless for decades. <words>110</words>  

Elias had one purpose left—to coax the storm back from silence. <words>122</words>  

He traced a trembling finger over a photograph of two figures mid-air. <words>134</words>  

A memory stirred: the shared love for a certain sport—diving. <words>145</words>  

He and his brother had once plunged from cliffs, slicing into the sea. <words>158</words>  

The sensation of falling, of surrendering to gravity, had been their language. <words>170</words>  

But his brother was gone, lost to the same theft Elias had mastered. <words>183</words>  

He had stolen too much, even from himself, and now he was hollow. <words>196</words>  

The library creaked as he stood, the photo album slipping from his grasp. <words>209</words>  

He climbed the ladder to the platform above, where the wind howled. <words>221</words>  

The world had forgotten how to break, how to shatter into sound. <words>233</words>  

Elias spread his arms, imagining the weight of water beneath him. <words>245</words>  

If he could remember the fall, perhaps the sky would remember thunder. <words>257</words>  

He took a breath, then plunged into the abyss below. <words>268</words>  

For a moment, he was weightless, suspended between past and present. <words>280</words>  

Memories flickered—his brother’s laughter, the crash of waves, the roar of storms. <words>293</words>  

Then, impact—his body met the earth, but the sky cracked open. <words>305</words>  

A distant rumble answered, hesitant at first, then growing, rolling, breaking. <words>317</words>  

Elias lay still, his fragmented self dissolving into the returning storm. <words>329</words>  

The wind carried whispers of forgotten dreams, stolen and reclaimed. <words>340</words>  

Raindrops struck the wooden planks, drumming a rhythm long absent. <words>351</words>  

The library inside the treehouse shuddered, as if exhaling relief. <words>362</words>  

Elias smiled, his purpose fulfilled, his mind finally whole. <words>373</words>  

Above, the sky wept, and the world remembered how to dream. <words>385</words>
