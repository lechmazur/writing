The carnival was packing up under the first rays of dawn, its laughter and music fading into the mist that clung to the polluted swamp orchard. <words>21</words>  

Mayor Elias Thorn, who had never meant to be mayor at all, stood at the edge of the orchard, watching the monks tend to their poisoned trees. <words>42</words>  

He had won the election by accident—a joke ballot, a miscount, and suddenly, the grumpiest man in town was in charge. <words>61</words>  

A clockwork beetle whirred in his palm, its tiny gears clicking as it adjusted its delicate brass wings. <words>78</words>  

It had been a gift from the monks, a symbol of transformation, though Elias had never quite understood why. <words>96</words>  

He sighed, rubbing his temple, the weight of fate pressing against his ribs. <words>108</words>  

Last night, in a crowded café, he had overheard a conversation that refused to leave his mind. <words>126</words>  

Two travelers, voices hushed but urgent, spoke of the swamp’s poisoned waters and the monks’ secret knowledge. <words>144</words>  

“The water remembers,” one had said. “It carries wisdom, but only for those willing to listen.” <words>161</words>  

Elias had scoffed at the time, but now, standing here, he felt something shift inside him. <words>179</words>  

The monks moved like shadows among the twisted trees, their robes damp with morning mist. <words>195</words>  

One of them, Brother Aldric, approached, his face lined with years of quiet patience. <words>211</words>  

“You carry the beetle still,” Aldric observed, his voice like rustling reeds. <words>225</words>  

Elias grunted. “Didn’t know what else to do with it.” <words>237</words>  

Aldric smiled, unbothered by Elias’s perpetual gruffness. <words>249</words>  

“The carnival leaves, but the water remains,” the monk said. “And so does its wisdom.” <words>266</words>  

Elias frowned, glancing at the murky water pooled beneath the trees. <words>280</words>  

“What wisdom?” he muttered. “It’s just filth and rot.” <words>293</words>  

Aldric knelt, cupping a handful of the dark water. <words>306</words>  

“Even poisoned, it remembers purity,” he said. “It can change, if guided.” <words>322</words>  

Elias stared at the water, then at the beetle in his hand. <words>336</words>  

The tiny machine clicked, its wings unfolding, shifting, changing. <words>350</words>  

A memory surfaced—his grandfather’s voice, telling him that change was never instant, but always possible. <words>370</words>  

He exhaled, the reluctant awe settling deep in his bones. <words>384</words>  

Perhaps fate wasn’t a straight path, but something that could be nudged, reshaped. <words>401</words>  

The monks had tended this poisoned land for years, believing in its metamorphosis. <words>417</words>  

Maybe it was time he did the same. <words>428</words>  

With a final glance at the departing carnival, Elias knelt beside Aldric and touched the water. <words>448</words>  

The clockwork beetle stirred, and for the first time, he listened. <words>462</words>
