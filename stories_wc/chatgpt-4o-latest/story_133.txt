The locksmith adjusted his embroidered gloves, their golden threads catching the last light of dusk. <words>12</words>  

He had once been a man of purpose, but years of crafting keys for doors that led nowhere had left him jaded. <words>29</words>  

Now, he found himself in a pottery class, his rough hands shaping clay with surprising delicacy. <words>41</words>  

Across from him sat a woman with a delightfully menacing air, her gaze sharp as a blade. <words>54</words>  

She spoke in measured tones, her words permeating the quiet space like ink in water. <words>66</words>  

"You know of the unclaimed throne," she said, her fingers pressing into the clay. <words>78</words>  

The locksmith did not look up, but his hands faltered. <words>86</words>  

"I know of many things," he replied, his voice edged with demure audacity. <words>98</words>  

She smirked, wiping her hands on a cloth embroidered with the same golden thread as his gloves. <words>112</words>  

"The labyrinth orchard still stands on the rooftops," she continued, watching him closely. <words>124</words>  

He exhaled slowly, the scent of wet clay mixing with the distant aroma of citrus. <words>136</words>  

"That place is a relic," he murmured. <words>141</words>  

"A relic that holds the key to preserving hunting methods long forgotten," she countered. <words>154</words>  

The locksmith finally met her gaze, his fingers tightening around the clay. <words>165</words>  

"You assume I care," he said. <words>170</words>  

She leaned forward, her presence permeating the space between them. <words>180</words>  

"You cared once," she said. <words>185</words>  

The locksmith stood abruptly, removing his gloves with deliberate precision. <words>196</words>  

The embroidered fabric lay on the table like a discarded past. <words>206</words>  

"Meet me there during painting," she said, rising as well. <words>217</words>  

He hesitated, then nodded. <words>221</words>  

That night, he climbed the rooftops of the colonial town, the labyrinth orchard stretching before him. <words>234</words>  

Moonlight painted the twisting paths in silver, the scent of ripe fruit thick in the air. <words>247</words>  

She was waiting, a brush in hand, painting symbols onto the stone walls. <words>259</words>  

"These marks will guide us," she said, her strokes precise. <words>270</words>  

He traced one with his fingers, recognizing the old hunters' code. <words>281</words>  

"You mean to claim the throne," he said. <words>288</words>  

She smiled, delightfully menacing. <words>292</words>  

"And you mean to help me," she replied. <words>299</words>  

The locksmith sighed, the weight of forgotten purpose settling on his shoulders. <words>310</words>  

"Show me the way," he said. <words>316</words>  

Together, they moved through the orchard, the past and future intertwining like vines. <words>328</words>  

The unclaimed throne awaited, and with it, the return of something long lost. <words>339</words>
