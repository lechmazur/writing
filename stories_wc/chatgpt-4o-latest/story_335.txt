The mercenary’s hands trembled as he stepped over the shattered pews, his boots crunching against broken glass and forgotten prayers. <words>16</words>  

The cathedral had collapsed decades ago, but its bones still stood, repurposed by those who saw beauty in ruin. <words>32</words>  

Street artists had claimed the space, their murals twisting over crumbling walls, saints and specters alike staring from the wreckage. <words>48</words>  

He wasn’t here for the art, though—he was here for the rumor, the impossible whisper passed through improbable chains. <words>64</words>  

Somewhere in this ruin, hidden beneath layers of dust and time, lay the thing he sought. <words>76</words>  

A chunk of amber, ancient and golden, with a spider frozen inside—a relic of a past he couldn’t escape. <words>92</words>  

He had killed for less, but tonight, he only wanted to finalize something long overdue. <words>106</words>  

The slow fade of an echoing hour stretched around him, the silence thick with ghosts of forgotten hymns. <words>120</words>  

He moved with a carefully reckless gait, his instincts warring with his desperation. <words>132</words>  

The mercenary had spent years searching for the unknown, chasing shadows, hoping to make peace with what he had done. <words>150</words>  

The amber was the last piece, the final tether to a life he had shattered with his own hands. <words>166</words>  

He had first heard of it in a bar, a drunken whisper from a man who barely believed his own words. <words>184</words>  

Then another voice, in another city, confirming the impossible—an artifact lost in the wreckage of faith. <words>198</words>  

Now, standing in the cathedral’s hollow ribs, he felt the weight of every step that had led him here. <words>214</words>  

His fingers traced the edges of a fallen altar, its marble cracked but still cold beneath his touch. <words>228</words>  

Then, beneath a pile of forgotten canvases, he saw it—a glint of gold in the dim light. <words>242</words>  

He knelt, brushing away dust, his breath catching as he lifted the amber from its resting place. <words>256</words>  

The spider inside was perfectly preserved, its delicate legs curled as if caught mid-motion. <words>268</words>  

He had seen this before, in another life, in another place where blood had stained his hands. <words>282</words>  

It had belonged to someone he had loved, someone he had betrayed. <words>292</words>  

Holding it now, he felt the improbable longing coil tight in his chest. <words>304</words>  

The past could not be undone, but perhaps, in this moment, it could be acknowledged. <words>318</words>  

He closed his fingers around the amber, its warmth seeping into his skin. <words>330</words>  

The cathedral groaned around him, the slow breath of a place that refused to die. <words>344</words>  

He exhaled, steadying himself, and walked back into the night, the weight of the past finally bearable. <words>360</words>
