The neon-lit desert hummed with static, a maze of billboards flickering half-truths into the void. <words>16</words>  

At a battered wooden bar top, Elias traced the water rings, his fingers trembling with the weight of prophecy. <words>32</words>  

"Probably unlikely," he muttered, eyes darting to the pocket puzzle box with its thirteen infernal locks. <words>45</words>  

The bartender, unimpressed, wiped a glass and smirked. <words>51</words>  

"That thing gonna tell you the future, or just keep your hands busy?" <words>62</words>  

Elias exhaled sharply, molten sarcasm curling in his throat. <words>71</words>  

"Both, if I can magnify the right moment," he said, tapping the bar. <words>83</words>  

The rings in the wood whispered secrets, rippling outward like echoes of lost years. <words>95</words>  

Destiny wasn’t written in stars—it was shaped with bare hands. <words>105</words>  

And Elias had spent too long watching the world burn from the sidelines. <words>117</words>  

The billboards outside screamed indulgence, excess, a future choking on its own neon glow. <words>129</words>  

He had seen the signs—literally and otherwise—but no one listened to a mildly panicked soothsayer. <words>143</words>  

Not when the truth was inconvenient. <words>147</words>  

Not when it meant dismantling the machine that fed them. <words>156</words>  

The puzzle box clicked under his fingers, each lock a riddle, each turn a choice. <words>169</words>  

Inside, the key to something better—or nothing at all. <words>178</words>  

"You're wasting your time," the bartender said, pouring another drink. <words>189</words>  

Elias laughed, sharp and bitter. <words>194</words>  

"Time’s already wasted. I’m just trying to salvage what’s left." <words>205</words>  

The bartender shrugged, uninterested in salvations. <words>211</words>  

Outside, the desert wind howled, carrying the scent of scorched earth. <words>222</words>  

Elias turned another lock, feeling the weight of probability shift. <words>232</words>  

Probably unlikely. <words>234</words>  

But not impossible. <words>237</words>  

The water rings deepened, patterns emerging, a map of what could be. <words>248</words>  

A world not drowning in its own waste. <words>254</words>  

A future not dictated by greed. <words>259</words>  

He had seen it once, in a vision half-forgotten. <words>268</words>  

Now, he would carve it into reality. <words>274</words>  

The final lock clicked open. <words>278</words>  

The bartender leaned in, curiosity finally outweighing indifference. <words>288</words>  

"What’s inside?" <words>290</words>  

Elias smiled, the weight of destiny settling in his palms. <words>300</words>  

"Change." <words>301</words>  

And for the first time in years, it felt possible. <words>310</words>  

The neon flickered, the desert held its breath, and the world teetered on the edge of something new. <words>324</words>  

Elias closed the box, stood, and stepped into the maze of billboards. <words>335</words>  

The future wasn’t waiting. <words>338</words>  

It was his to shape. <words>342</words>
