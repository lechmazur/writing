The gears of the steampunk lounge whirred softly as Elias adjusted his tattered coat, his fingers brushing against the rusted knight’s gauntlet hidden beneath the folds. <words>22</words> He had found it years ago, a relic of a forgotten war, much like himself. <words>35</words> The weight of it reminded him why he was here. <words>44</words>  

Between calls for performances, he sat at the bar, staring at the brass pipes lining the walls, his mind clouded with creative block. <words>61</words> The music of the lounge, usually a source of inspiration, now felt distant, hollow. <words>75</words> He had once been a master of illusion, a street performer who could make crowds gasp in wonder. <words>92</words> But tonight, his hands trembled, his tricks faltering. <words>102</words>  

Then, he saw her—Marla, his sworn adversary, the woman who had once exposed his greatest deception. <words>118</words> She moved through the haze of steam and cigar smoke, her eyes scanning the room with the same sharpness that had once undone him. <words>137</words>  

Elias clenched the gauntlet, its rusted surface rough against his palm, and remembered. <words>149</words> The memory came not as an image but as a sensation—the texture of a coral reef beneath his fingertips. <words>165</words> Years ago, he had hidden in the shallows of a distant shore, running from the consequences of his lies. <words>181</words> The coral had scraped his skin, grounding him in reality, forcing him to confront what he had become. <words>198</words>  

Now, he had a chance to make peace. <words>206</words> He rose, his movements deliberate, and approached Marla. <words>216</words> She turned, her expression unreadable, but he saw the flicker of recognition in her eyes. <words>231</words>  

“I never thanked you,” Elias said, his voice carrying a coded desperation. <words>244</words> “For what?” she asked, her tone wary. <words>253</words>  

“For forcing me to see myself,” he admitted, placing the gauntlet on the table between them. <words>268</words> “I kept this as a reminder of what I was—a relic, rusting away.” <words>282</words>  

Marla studied the gauntlet, then him. <words>289</words> “And now?” she asked. <words>295</words>  

“I want to build something new,” he said. <words>304</words> “But I can’t do it alone.” <words>312</words>  

She exhaled, her fingers tracing the gauntlet’s corroded edges. <words>323</words> “Trust is not easily renewed,” she said. <words>333</words>  

“No,” Elias agreed. <words>337</words> “But it can be.” <words>343</words>  

A long silence stretched between them, filled with the hum of machinery and the distant laughter of patrons. <words>359</words> Then, slowly, Marla nodded. <words>366</words>  

“Between calls,” she said, “we’ll talk.” <words>376</words>  

Elias allowed himself a small smile. <words>384</words> The gauntlet remained on the table, but its weight had lifted. <words>398</words>
