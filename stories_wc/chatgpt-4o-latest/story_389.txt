The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his formally casual robes, their embroidered edges fraying from years of neglect. <words>14</words>  
He stood at the entrance of the forgotten library, deep within an abandoned mine where echoes whispered secrets. <words>28</words>  
Tonight, as the final calendar page of the year was flipped, he would gorge on the fruit of knowledge. <words>42</words>  
Warnings had been given, but he dismissed them as the fearful mutterings of lesser minds. <words>54</words>  
His fingers tightened around the Viking ship figurehead fragment, its worn wood humming with latent power. <words>67</words>  
It was said to be a key, though no one knew to what. <words>77</words>  
He intended to optimize its potential, unlocking the lost artifacts buried in the library’s depths. <words>90</words>  
The air smelled of damp parchment and forgotten ink, a scent both intoxicating and foreboding. <words>103</words>  
Shelves loomed in the darkness, their contents untouched for centuries, their wisdom waiting to be devoured. <words>116</words>  
He moved with certainty, though the path twisted in ways that defied logic. <words>127</words>  
The books here were discredited, their cures deemed fraudulent, their truths buried beneath ridicule. <words>139</words>  
Yet he knew better—truth often hid in the margins of disbelief. <words>150</words>  
He traced a finger along a spine, dust curling into the air like ghosts. <words>163</words>  
A tome fell open, revealing a passage on rumored cures through forgotten rituals. <words>175</words>  
His lips curled slightly, the closest he ever came to a smile. <words>186</words>  
The figurehead fragment pulsed in his grip, reacting to the words on the page. <words>198</words>  
He whispered an incantation, syllables twisting like serpents in the stale air. <words>210</words>  
The library groaned, as if awakening from a long slumber. <words>220</words>  
Shelves shifted, revealing a hidden alcove bathed in an eerie glow. <words>232</words>  
Inside, artifacts lay scattered—relics of forgotten power, waiting to be claimed. <words>244</words>  
His breath quickened as he stepped forward, the hunger in his eyes undeniable. <words>256</words>  
Knowledge was a feast, and he had starved for too long. <words>267</words>  
He reached for a gilded scroll, its edges crumbling at his touch. <words>279</words>  
The words within spoke of a ritual to transcend mortal limitations. <words>290</words>  
He had found what he sought, despite the warnings. <words>300</words>  
The figurehead fragment burned in his palm, its power surging. <words>311</words>  
The library trembled, as if resisting his intrusion. <words>321</words>  
But he would not be denied. <words>327</words>  
He began the ritual, his voice steady, his certainty absolute. <words>338</words>  
The walls cracked, shadows lengthened, and the mine groaned in protest. <words>350</words>  
Yet he continued, his hunger greater than his fear. <words>360</words>  
The final word left his lips, and the world shattered. <words>371</words>  
Darkness swallowed him, knowledge consuming him whole. <words>380</words>  
The library stood silent once more, waiting for the next fool. <words>391</words>
