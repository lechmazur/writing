Elliot adjusted his tool belt, the weight of his wrench familiar as he stepped into the sand castle preservation lab. <words>16</words>  

The air smelled of salt and old stories, the silence thick except for the occasional scratch of a brush against fragile grains. <words>33</words>  

He had taken this job for the quiet, but silence had never been empty for him. <words>45</words>  

It was filled with whispers, with the ghosts that clung to broken elevators and forgotten hallways. <words>59</words>  

He saw them now, flickering at the edges of his vision, watching as he pried open the control panel. <words>74</words>  

The elevator here was ancient, its gears grinding like a voice trying to be heard. <words>87</words>  

He understood that struggle. <words>90</words>  

During lunch breaks, he staked out local ghost tours, listening to guides spin tales of lost souls. <words>106</words>  

He wasn’t looking for proof—he had enough of that. <words>117</words>  

He was looking for a way to let go. <words>126</words>  

A way to stop dissecting every silence for the echoes of the dead. <words>138</words>  

Today, he carried something different in his pocket—a dried flower crown, brittle and delicate. <words>153</words>  

He had found it in an old maintenance shaft, left behind by someone who had once believed in beauty. <words>169</words>  

It reminded him of his sister, who had woven crowns like this before she disappeared. <words>183</words>  

She had always been elegantly clumsy, her hands creating fragile things that never lasted. <words>197</words>  

He had spent years chasing her ghost, listening for her voice in the hum of machinery. <words>212</words>  

But ghosts never spoke the way the living did. <words>221</words>  

They lingered in the spaces between words, in the dissonance of silence. <words>234</words>  

A soft gust of wind stirred the sand sculptures, shifting their edges, reshaping them. <words>248</words>  

He thought of how sand castles were preserved—not by keeping them unchanged, but by accepting their impermanence. <words>265</words>  

Maybe that was the answer. <words>269</words>  

Maybe letting go wasn’t about forgetting, but about allowing things to shift. <words>282</words>  

He placed the dried flower crown on the workbench, watching as a grain of sand settled into its petals. <words>298</words>  

Then, for the first time in years, he let the silence be just silence. <words>311</words>  

The ghosts didn’t vanish, but they no longer held him captive. <words>323</words>  

He finished his repairs, wiped his hands, and stepped into the elevator. <words>336</words>  

As the doors closed, he caught his reflection in the polished metal. <words>349</words>  

For the first time, he looked like someone who was ready to move on. <words>362</words>  

Outside, the wind carried away a few grains of sand, reshaping the world one whisper at a time. <words>378</words>
