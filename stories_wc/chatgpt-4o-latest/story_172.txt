The last photo was snapped in the deserted hallway, its flash echoing like a final breath. <words>17</words>  
Jonas, an unsettled guide, exhaled sharply, gripping the wooden puzzle box in his trembling hands. <words>32</words>  
He had led countless seekers through the ruins, but none had returned unchanged. <words>44</words>  
Tonight, he was alone, save for the prophecy that whispered his doom. <words>57</words>  
The hallway stretched endlessly behind him, its walls shifting like a living thing. <words>70</words>  
He had to outrun it, to escape before the architecture sealed his fate. <words>84</words>  
The puzzle box, carved with spiraling patterns, was his only hope. <words>96</words>  
Legends spoke of its power to reveal architectural secrets through reversed wishes. <words>110</words>  
Jonas had wished for escape, but the box had twisted his intent. <words>123</words>  
Instead of a door, it had given him knowledge—terrible, inescapable knowledge. <words>137</words>  
The ruins were not ruins at all, but a structure waiting to align. <words>151</words>  
If he failed to act, the prophecy would consume him in stone. <words>164</words>  
He fled, the box clutched to his chest, sand biting his heels. <words>178</words>  
The hallway dissolved into moonlight, and he found himself on a deserted beach. <words>192</words>  
Before him, a giant seashell loomed, its spirals mirroring the puzzle box. <words>206</words>  
The prophecy had led him here, to the heart of the design. <words>219</words>  
Jonas hesitated, then traced the grooves of the box with steady fingers. <words>233</words>  
The seashell pulsed, responding to his touch, its ridges shifting in tandem. <words>247</words>  
He understood now—he had to align the patterns, to complete the structure. <words>261</words>  
With careful precision, he twisted the box’s segments, reversing his wish. <words>274</words>  
The air thickened, the beach trembling as unseen forces snapped into place. <words>288</words>  
The prophecy had warned of his end, but it had not foreseen this. <words>302</words>  
By aligning the puzzle, he had rewritten the architecture of fate itself. <words>316</words>  
The seashell unfurled, revealing a hidden passage spiraling into the earth. <words>330</words>  
Jonas hesitated, then stepped forward, his fear tempered by sharp gentleness. <words>344</words>  
He had been an unwilling guide, but now he was something else. <words>358</words>  
Accidentally heroic, he descended, leaving the prophecy gasping in his wake. <words>372</words>  
The hallway, the ruins, the shifting walls—they were all behind him now. <words>386</words>  
Only the unknown remained, waiting to be shaped by his hands. <words>399</words>  
And for the first time, Jonas did not fear what lay ahead. <words>412</words>
