The floating rock dojo drifted through the void, its stone foundation cracked but enduring. <words>12</words>  

Inside, Elias, a morbid florist, arranged wilted petals around a plain white candle. <words>24</words>  

The candle’s wax pooled like melted bone, its flame flickering in the last breath of a guttering lantern. <words>38</words>  

He had come here seeking understanding, drawn by the whispers of cosmic cycles. <words>48</words>  

His beliefs had been tempered by loss, neither hardened nor shattered, but reshaped. <words>58</words>  

A neutrally passionate man, he neither clung to nor rejected the mysteries he pursued. <words>70</words>  

The dojo’s master, an aged scribe, had left behind a trunk filled with typed pages. <words>82</words>  

Elias obliged the silent invitation, sifting through the backlog of words left behind. <words>94</words>  

Each page spoke of celestial rhythms, of stars collapsing and reforming in endless cycles. <words>106</words>  

The words resonated with him, mirroring the way flowers withered only to bloom again. <words>118</words>  

He traced the inked lines with reverence, his fingers dusted with time’s residue. <words>130</words>  

Outside, the dojo’s floating rock tilted slightly, shifting its course through the abyss. <words>142</words>  

Elias felt the movement but remained still, absorbing the knowledge before him. <words>154</words>  

The candle’s flame wavered, casting elongated shadows that danced like specters. <words>166</words>  

He read of the universe’s breath, the inhalation of creation, the exhalation of decay. <words>178</words>  

His own work as a florist had always been a quiet reflection of this truth. <words>190</words>  

Flowers lived, died, and returned to the soil, just as stars did in the heavens. <words>202</words>  

The realization settled in him—not as revelation, but as confirmation. <words>212</words>  

He had always known, but now he understood. <words>218</words>  

The lantern’s final flicker surrendered to darkness, leaving only the candle’s glow. <words>230</words>  

Elias exhaled, his breath merging with the silence of the drifting dojo. <words>242</words>  

He closed the trunk, sealing the words within, yet carrying them forward. <words>254</words>  

The floating rock dojo would continue its journey, as would he. <words>264</words>  

Not as a seeker, but as one who had found. <words>272</words>
