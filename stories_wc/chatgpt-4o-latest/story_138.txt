The forgotten noble sat in the spontaneous combustion lab, watching the artificial hummingbird drone hover near the ceiling. <words>16</words>  

Its tiny wings whirred, a mechanical mimicry of life, yet its presence felt more real than his own. <words>30</words>  

Between text messages, he sorted through a pile of old ticket stubs, their faded ink whispering of past illusions. <words>45</words>  

He had once been someone—someone with a name, a title, a place in the world. <words>56</words>  

Now, he was a ghost in a lab built for destruction, fortifying himself through the reassembly of discarded memories. <words>72</words>  

Each stub was a fragment of a life that had unraveled, a life that had been mysteriously obvious in its decline. <words>88</words>  

He pressed two stubs together, aligning their torn edges, as if stitching together the truth he had long ignored. <words>103</words>  

The hummingbird drone dipped lower, its sensors scanning his work, its presence a silent judge of his recklessness. <words>118</words>  

A text message buzzed on his phone, but he ignored it, unwilling to let another illusion intrude. <words>132</words>  

He had spent years wrapped in deception—his own, others’—but candor lived in small moments, in the quiet between distractions. <words>149</words>  

The lab smelled of burnt paper and melted plastic, remnants of failed experiments, of things that had combusted too soon. <words>165</words>  

He knew the feeling well. <words>168</words>  

Another ticket stub, another memory: a night at the opera, a performance he had barely watched. <words>182</words>  

He had been too busy pretending, too busy maintaining the illusion of importance. <words>194</words>  

The hummingbird drone landed on the table, its tiny feet clicking against the metal surface. <words>207</words>  

It tilted its head, as if questioning his purpose, as if demanding an answer he wasn’t sure he had. <words>222</words>  

He exhaled, pressing another stub into place, fortifying his resolve with each careful reconstruction. <words>236</words>  

The truth was simple: he had lost himself in the grand performance of his own life. <words>249</words>  

Now, in the hollow recklessness of this lab, he sought something real, something unburned by pretense. <words>264</words>  

The phone buzzed again. <words>267</words>  

This time, he picked it up, staring at the message: “Are you ready to stop running?” <words>281</words>  

The hummingbird drone twitched, its wings fluttering as if sensing the shift in his thoughts. <words>295</words>  

He looked at the reconstructed stubs, a mosaic of past choices, past mistakes. <words>308</words>  

Candor was not grand; it was found in the quiet, in the spaces between distractions. <words>322</words>  

He typed a reply: “Yes.” <words>325</words>  

The hummingbird drone lifted off, its wings slicing through the air like a blade through illusion. <words>340</words>  

The lab flickered with the glow of dying embers, but for the first time, he felt untouched by the fire. <words>356</words>
