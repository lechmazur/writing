The neon haze of the cyberpunk city night market flickered erratically, its glow reflecting off puddles left behind after the storm used up its last rumble. <words>22</words>  

Jasper Vail, a broke swashbuckler with a flair for the fashionably unfashionable, strode through the labyrinth of stalls, his tattered coat billowing behind him. <words>45</words>  

He adjusted the vintage hatpin securing his frayed cravat, a relic from a time when elegance still mattered in a world that had long since burned. <words>69</words>  

The market pulsed with desperate energy—hawkers peddling black-market cybernetics, scavengers bartering for scraps, and mercenaries lurking in the shadows, waiting for the next contract. <words>98</words>  

Jasper ignored them all, his focus set on a single goal: to shelter kindness in a world on fire. <words>117</words>  

He had nothing but his wits, his blade, and a method as unorthodox as his attire—charting the swirl of antique marbles scattered under a bed. <words>147</words>  

It was a trick he had learned from an old gambler, a way to read the chaos of the world in the patterns of the past. <words>177</words>  

Tonight, he needed that trick more than ever. <words>185</words>  

A child, no older than ten, huddled beneath a rusted awning, her cybernetic arm flickering with failing power. <words>208</words>  

Jasper knelt beside her, his voice low. <words>216</words>  

"You're running low on charge," he murmured, noting the dim glow of her artificial fingers. <words>237</words>  

She nodded, wary but too exhausted to flee. <words>249</words>  

"Got a name?" he asked. <words>258</words>  

"Rin," she whispered. <words>265</words>  

Jasper reached into his pocket, fingers closing around a small pouch of antique marbles. <words>285</words>  

He spilled them onto the cracked pavement, watching as they rolled and settled into a pattern only he could decipher. <words>312</words>  

The marbles told him what he needed to know—where to find a power cell, who to avoid, and the quickest way out. <words>342</words>  

"Come on," he said, offering his hand. <words>354</words>  

Rin hesitated, then took it. <words>364</words>  

They moved through the market like ghosts, Jasper emitting an air of practiced indifference while his mind worked furiously. <words>390</words>  

The power cell was in the possession of a fence named Ludo, a man who respected only two things: skill and spectacle. <words>419</words>  

Jasper stepped into Ludo’s den, tossing a single marble onto the table. <words>439</words>  

"One game," he said. "Winner takes the cell." <words>457</words>  

Ludo smirked, intrigued. <words>465</words>  

The game was swift, brutal, and inevitable—Jasper never lost when the stakes were real. <words>488</words>  

With the power cell secured, he and Rin vanished into the night, two flickering lights against the darkness. <words>500</words>
