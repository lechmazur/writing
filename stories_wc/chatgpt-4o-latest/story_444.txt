The zeppelin lay sunken beneath the waves, its skeletal frame a cathedral of rust and memory. <words>14</words>  

Between bursts of radio static, Ambassador Liora listened for the voices that haunted her nights. <words>26</words>  

She had been chosen for this mission not for her diplomacy, but for her ability to dream with others. <words>40</words>  

The chain of letters had led her here, each one penned by hands long vanished, each voice echoing across time. <words>55</words>  

She traced the ink with methodical playfulness, as if teasing secrets from the past. <words>66</words>  

The letters spoke of illusions—comforting lies woven into history, waiting to be hushed. <words>78</words>  

A child’s ghost costume, threadbare and forgotten, lay draped over a rusted console. <words>90</words>  

It had been part of a play, a story meant to indoctrinate young minds into believing in the empire’s eternal glory. <words>106</words>  

Liora lifted the fragile fabric, feeling the weight of its deception. <words>116</words>  

She had worn such illusions once, wrapped herself in them like armor. <words>128</words>  

Now, she sought to unravel them, thread by thread. <words>137</words>  

The voices in the static grew clearer as she donned the costume, its frayed edges whispering against her skin. <words>152</words>  

She closed her eyes, letting the shared dream take hold. <words>162</words>  

The zeppelin was whole again, its corridors alive with laughter and purpose. <words>174</words>  

Children ran past her, their faces alight with belief in a world that never truly existed. <words>187</words>  

She walked among them, a ghost in their dream, her presence a quiet rebellion. <words>200</words>  

A boy stopped before her, his eyes filled with questions he had not yet learned to ask. <words>213</words>  

"Why do you wear that?" he asked, pointing to the costume. <words>224</words>  

"To remind myself," she said, "that even ghosts can wake." <words>235</words>  

The dream wavered, the illusion fraying at its edges. <words>246</words>  

The children hesitated, sensing the shift, their certainty unraveling. <words>258</words>  

Liora reached into her pocket, pulling out the final letter in the chain. <words>271</words>  

She read it aloud, her voice steady despite the calm frenzy in her chest. <words>284</words>  

"The empire is not eternal. It is a story told to keep us asleep." <words>296</words>  

The boy’s face flickered, his form dissolving into static. <words>307</words>  

One by one, the children faded, their laughter swallowed by the truth. <words>319</words>  

The zeppelin groaned, its illusion collapsing into rust and silence. <words>330</words>  

Liora opened her eyes to the wreckage, the ghost costume slipping from her shoulders. <words>343</words>  

The radio crackled one last time, then fell silent. <words>353</words>  

She had hushed the illusion. <words>357</words>  

And in doing so, she had set them free. <words>365</words>
