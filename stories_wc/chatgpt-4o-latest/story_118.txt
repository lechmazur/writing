Dr. Vexel adjusted their glasses, the lenses reflecting the dim glow of the training facility’s emergency lights. <words>12</words>  

The agents-in-training sat in a semicircle, their minds linked to Vexel’s own, a hive of tangled thoughts seeking order. <words>27</words>  

Tonight, the air carried the weight of something unspoken, a tension humming beneath the surface of their collective consciousness. <words>40</words>  

A scuffed phone charger plug dangled from the wall, its frayed edges a testament to the facility’s relentless pace. <words>53</words>  

Vexel sighed, their voice laced with merry bitterness. <words>59</words>  

“Hindsight has a sound, you know,” they mused, letting the words settle like dust in the sterile room. <words>72</words>  

The agents shifted, their expressions uniformly peculiar, each face reflecting a different shade of skepticism. <words>85</words>  

One recruit, a wiry man named Lorne, frowned. <words>91</words>  

“What does hindsight sound like?” he asked, his voice edged with doubt. <words>102</words>  

Vexel smiled, reaching for the candle on the table before them. <words>113</words>  

They tilted it, letting the slow drip of wax form coded shapes on the steel surface. <words>126</words>  

Each drop landed with a soft hiss, a whisper of past mistakes solidifying into something tangible. <words>139</words>  

“It sounds like this,” Vexel said, watching the recruits lean in. <words>149</words>  

The wax hardened into symbols, a language only the trained could decipher. <words>160</words>  

Lorne’s eyes widened as he read the message forming before him. <words>170</words>  

“Tomorrow’s mission,” he murmured, his pulse quickening. <words>177</words>  

Vexel nodded. <words>179</words>  

“The eve of a bold discovery,” they said, their voice carrying through the night air. <words>191</words>  

The agents exchanged glances, the weight of the moment settling in. <words>201</words>  

Vexel placed a hand on the table, feeling the collective unease ripple through their shared mind. <words>214</words>  

“To anchor the ephemeral in reality,” they continued, “we must first drain ourselves of doubt.” <words>227</words>  

The words resonated, a pulse of understanding threading through the group. <words>237</words>  

Lorne exhaled, his fingers tracing the hardened wax. <words>245</words>  

The coded shapes told a story of what was to come, a mission that would redefine their purpose. <words>259</words>  

The scuffed charger plug sparked slightly, a reminder of the facility’s imperfections. <words>270</words>  

Vexel chuckled, the sound rich with knowing. <words>277</words>  

“Even the most broken things still carry a charge,” they said. <words>287</words>  

The agents smiled, the merry bitterness of their training settling into something steadier. <words>299</words>  

Tomorrow, they would step into the unknown, but tonight, they listened to the sound of hindsight. <words>312</words>
