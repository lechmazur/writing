The floating tea platform drifted through the mist, its wooden planks creaking under the weight of forgotten transactions. <words>19</words>  
Here, Lucian Vey, a soul-broker real estate agent, conducted his peculiar trade, exchanging spectral residencies for those seeking a second existence. <words>40</words>  
His clients arrived in hushed anticipation, drawn by the legend of his persuasive prowess. <words>51</words>  
Lucian’s method was unorthodox—he deciphered the past by reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles, each containing echoes of lives once lived. <words>75</words>  
Tonight, he held a particularly ancient bottle, its surface clouded with time, its label a whisper of forgotten ink. <words>96</words>  
He turned it in his hands, eyes narrowing as the reversed script revealed a melody lost to the ages. <words>117</words>  
A song, woven into the very fabric of the bottle’s history, hummed at the edge of his mind. <words>137</words>  
Lucian’s motivation was not merely profit—he sought to learn these forgotten songs, to resurrect them through the art of persuasion. <words>161</words>  
His voice, rich with grandiose modesty, carried across the platform as he addressed his latest client, a woman seeking refuge from mortality. <words>186</words>  
“You wish to inhabit a home beyond time,” he intoned, gesturing to the spectral estates shimmering in the mist. <words>208</words>  
“But to do so, you must understand the rhythm of existence itself.” <words>220</words>  
He uncorked the bottle, releasing a sigh of dust and memory, and began to choreograph the air with his hands. <words>244</words>  
The woman watched, entranced, as the dust swirled into patterns, forming the shape of a house suspended between worlds. <words>267</words>  
Lucian remained weirdly static, his body unmoving save for his hands, which wove the melody into the very foundation of the home. <words>293</words>  
The song, once lost, now resonated through the platform, its notes threading through the mist like golden filaments. <words>314</words>  
The woman gasped as the house solidified, its walls humming with the echoes of past inhabitants. <words>334</words>  
“This is your dwelling,” Lucian declared, his voice both commanding and reverent. <words>349</words>  
“But remember, all things cycle through time, even the forgotten.” <words>363</words>  
She stepped forward, her form dissolving into the melody, becoming part of the house’s eternal refrain. <words>382</words>  
Lucian exhaled, sealing the transaction, and placed the empty bottle among the others, ready to be recycled into new stories. <words>407</words>  
The floating tea platform drifted onward, carrying its broker and his ever-growing archive of spectral melodies. <words>428</words>  
Lucian smiled, knowing that with each bottle deciphered, another song would rise from the depths of oblivion. <words>450</words>  
And so, the art of persuasion continued, shaping the unseen world, one forgotten note at a time. <words>472</words>
