Elliot snapped awake at the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess. <words>12</words>  

The quantum tunnel shimmered around him, its walls folding like liquid glass. <words>23</words>  

He exhaled, already knowing what came next. <words>29</words>  

The paramedic bag at his side felt heavier each time. <words>38</words>  

Somewhere ahead, someone was dying—again. <words>44</words>  

He had lost count of how many loops he had endured. <words>54</words>  

Each time, the same emergency, the same choices. <words>61</words>  

He stepped forward, boots crunching on unseen ground. <words>69</words>  

The tunnel’s glow pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat. <words>77</words>  

He moved by the sound of a single raindrop, his only guide. <words>88</words>  

The patient would be waiting, just beyond the bend. <words>96</words>  

Elliot’s fingers brushed the weathered fishing lure in his pocket. <words>106</words>  

A relic from a childhood he barely remembered. <words>113</words>  

His father’s, once bright, now dulled by time. <words>121</words>  

He had never learned to fish, never wanted to. <words>130</words>  

But he carried it, a tether to something unfinished. <words>139</words>  

The tunnel opened into a ruined street, rain misting the air. <words>149</words>  

A car lay overturned, steam rising from its shattered hood. <words>158</words>  

Inside, a woman gasped for breath, pinned beneath metal. <words>167</words>  

Elliot knelt, hands moving on instinct. <words>173</words>  

He had saved her before, and before that. <words>181</words>  

Yet she always died, no matter what he did. <words>190</words>  

His fingers trembled as he checked her pulse. <words>198</words>  

Weak, fading. <words>200</words>  

He should have felt urgency, but only excited boredom remained. <words>211</words>  

The loop had drained him of fear, of hope. <words>219</words>  

Still, he worked, pressing gauze to her wound. <words>228</words>  

Her eyes fluttered open, searching his face. <words>236</words>  

“You always come back,” she whispered. <words>241</words>  

Elliot froze. <words>243</words>  

She had never spoken before. <words>247</words>  

His grip tightened on the lure in his pocket. <words>256</words>  

“Who are you?” he asked. <words>260</words>  

Her lips curled in something like recognition. <words>267</words>  

“You nest in this moment, but never leave.” <words>275</words>  

Elliot’s breath hitched. <words>278</words>  

The tunnel, the loops, the endless rescues—was this his prison? <words>289</words>  

Unhealed traumas, replaying until he understood. <words>296</words>  

He had never saved her because he had never saved himself. <words>307</words>  

The lure pressed into his palm, sharp and real. <words>316</words>  

His father’s voice echoed in memory, distant but clear. <words>325</words>  

“Let go, son.” <words>328</words>  

Elliot exhaled, releasing the lure. <words>334</words>  

The tunnel flickered, its walls unraveling. <words>340</words>  

The woman smiled, her form dissolving into light. <words>349</words>  

Acceptance washed over him, cool as rain. <words>357</words>  

The loop shattered. <words>359</words>  

Elliot awoke beneath an open sky, free. <words>366</words>
