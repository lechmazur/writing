The slapdash bard stumbled toward the edge of the tectonic plate, his lute slung haphazardly across his back. <words>16</words>  
The ground trembled beneath his feet, a reminder that time was slipping away. <words>27</words>  
In his trembling hands, he clutched a brass doorplate, its inscription worn by generations of fingers. <words>40</words>  
This was the key, or so the legends claimed, to a sacred space beyond mortal reach. <words>53</words>  
He had no choice but to believe, for death’s shadow loomed ever closer. <words>64</words>  
The hourglass was nearly empty, its last grains of sand spiraling downward. <words>75</words>  
When it reset, the world would shift, and he would be lost forever. <words>86</words>  
His family had always gathered here, on this precarious precipice, for their annual picnic. <words>99</words>  
A tradition, they called it, though none could recall its origin. <words>110</words>  
Perhaps it had always been a ritual, a desperate attempt to defy fate. <words>123</words>  
Now, he alone remained, the last of his line, the final keeper of the song. <words>136</words>  
He strummed his lute, the notes discordant yet strangely resonant in the shifting air. <words>149</words>  
The melody was possibly impossible, a tune that should not exist yet did. <words>162</words>  
The brass doorplate grew warm in his grip, its inscription glowing faintly. <words>173</words>  
He pressed it against the trembling earth, whispering the words his ancestors had sung. <words>186</words>  
The ground split open, revealing a staircase spiraling downward into darkness. <words>197</words>  
He hesitated, knowing that to descend was to disrupt the natural order. <words>210</words>  
Yet what choice did he have? <words>214</words>  
Death was coming, and he had no intention of greeting it. <words>225</words>  
With a deep breath, he stepped forward, the melody guiding his way. <words>238</words>  
The walls pulsed with an eerie light, illuminating carvings of past picnics. <words>251</words>  
His ancestors’ faces stared back at him, frozen in time, caught mid-laughter. <words>264</words>  
At the bottom of the staircase, an altar stood, its surface dusted with ancient crumbs. <words>277</words>  
A single hourglass rested atop it, its sand frozen in place. <words>288</words>  
He reached out, his fingers brushing the glass, and the sand began to move. <words>301</words>  
The world above trembled, the tectonic plate shifting as time reset itself. <words>314</words>  
He felt himself being pulled, his body dissolving into the melody he played. <words>327</words>  
The sacred space embraced him, a place where death could not follow. <words>338</words>  
His song echoed through eternity, a melancholic glee woven into the fabric of time. <words>351</words>  
The hourglass turned, the sand beginning its descent once more. <words>362</words>  
Above, a new family gathered at the precipice, unaware of the bard’s sacrifice. <words>375</words>  
They laid out their picnic, laughing, as the earth trembled beneath them. <words>386</words>  
The tradition continued, a ritual of defiance, a song against oblivion. <words>397</words>  
And somewhere, deep below, the bard played on, forever disrupting the inevitable. <words>410</words>
