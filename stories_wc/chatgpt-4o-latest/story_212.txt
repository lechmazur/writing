The ethereal plains stretched endlessly, a ghostly shimmer rising from the cracked earth where nothing natural had grown in decades. <words>16</words>  

Elias knelt in the dust, his fingers sifting through the soil, searching for signs of life in the seeds he had bred. <words>32</words>  

He was an apocalyptic farmer, one of the last, cultivating crops that could survive where the world had failed. <words>46</words>  

The last resource war had left the land barren, its boundaries drawn in ash and ruin, but Elias refused to accept that fate. <words>63</words>  

He had spent years perfecting his seeds, whispering to them like a magician coaxing a trick from his deck of cards. <words>80</words>  

The deck itself, worn and frayed, lay beside him, a relic from a time when illusions were entertainment rather than survival. <words>97</words>  

He shuffled the cards absentmindedly, their edges softened by years of use, as he listened to the wind’s song of boundaries. <words>114</words>  

It was a song of division, of invisible lines that dictated where one could go and where one must remain. <words>129</words>  

Elias had never accepted those lines, not when they were drawn by war, nor when they were drawn by men. <words>144</words>  

His father had dictated his life once, forcing him to till poisoned land, to obey rules that no longer made sense. <words>161</words>  

But Elias was typically atypical, a man who saw patterns where others saw chaos, who believed in possibilities where others saw endings. <words>178</words>  

He had learned to send messages in bottles, casting them into the sea, hoping they would reach someone beyond the wastelands. <words>195</words>  

The bottles carried his words, his dreams, his plea for escape, drifting beyond the boundaries that had caged him for so long. <words>212</words>  

One morning, a bottle returned. <words>215</words>  

Inside was a single card from a magician’s deck—his own, marked with a symbol he had never seen before. <words>232</words>  

It was an invitation, a challenge, a promise. <words>237</words>  

He jabbered to himself as he examined it, his mind racing with possibilities, his hands trembling with something close to hope. <words>254</words>  

The wind carried a whisper, a voice woven into the song of boundaries, urging him to follow where the bottle had come from. <words>271</words>  

He gathered his seeds, his deck, and his resolve, stepping beyond the lines that had once held him captive. <words>286</words>  

The ethereal plains stretched before him, endless and uncertain, but for the first time, Elias walked toward something rather than away. <words>303</words>  

The song of boundaries shifted, its melody no longer one of confinement, but of passage, of change, of something new taking root. <words>320</words>  

And as Elias disappeared into the horizon, the first green shoot broke through the dust behind him. <words>333</words>
