Father Elias adjusted his collar, his fingers trembling as he studied the vintage postcard in his hands. <words>14</words> The edges were frayed, the ink faded, but the message scrawled across the back still burned. <words>28</words> "To see beyond, one must first be seen," it read in a looping, deliberate script. <words>40</words> He exhaled sharply, his breath uneven, as the distant sound of music filtered through the walls. <words>54</words>  

The psychic research facility had an odd way of conducting its studies—dance lessons amid spectral investigations. <words>68</words> Elias had been invited under the guise of consultation, but he knew better. <words>79</words> They wanted him rattled, off-balance, vulnerable to their guarded disclosures. <words>90</words>  

Dr. Celeste Moreau, the lead researcher, twirled into the room, her movements precise yet teasing. <words>103</words> "Father Elias," she purred, "have you solved the first puzzle?" <words>113</words>  

He held up the postcard. <words>117</words> "This was left in my quarters," he said, his voice measured. <words>129</words> "It’s part of your game, isn’t it?" <words>137</words>  

She smiled, coy aggression flickering in her eyes. <words>145</words> "A test, if you will," she admitted. <words>153</words> "To entwine science with wonder, we must first synthesize belief with proof." <words>166</words>  

Elias scoffed but traced the embossed seal on the card. <words>176</words> It matched the emblem on the facility’s grand ballroom floor. <words>187</words> "And what happens when I solve it?" he asked. <words>197</words>  

"You unlock the next step," she said, gesturing toward the dancers. <words>208</words> "Each movement, each rhythm, is a clue." <words>216</words>  

Elias watched, his mind working. <words>221</words> He had spent years banishing spirits, but this was different. <words>232</words> The ghosts here were not exorcised—they were studied, courted, understood. <words>244</words>  

He stepped onto the floor, mirroring the dancers. <words>253</words> The patterns formed symbols, the symbols formed sequences. <words>263</words> He synthesized the steps into meaning, his inwardly social nature allowing him to observe without intrusion. <words>278</words>  

A door clicked open behind the mirrors. <words>285</words> Moreau’s smile widened. <words>290</words> "You’re closer than you think, Father." <words>298</words>  

Elias hesitated before stepping through. <words>304</words> The hidden room was lined with artifacts—relics of hauntings, possessions, and inexplicable phenomena. <words>318</words>  

At the center stood a chair, restraints worn from use. <words>328</words> "What is this?" Elias demanded. <words>334</words>  

Moreau’s voice softened. <words>338</words> "The final puzzle." <words>342</words>  

The door sealed behind him. <words>347</words> The music outside continued, oblivious. <words>354</words>  

Elias gripped the postcard, its message now a whisper in his mind. <words>365</words> To see beyond, one must first be seen. <words>373</words>  

He had been invited not as an exorcist, but as a subject. <words>385</words>  

And now, the real experiment would begin. <words>392</words>
