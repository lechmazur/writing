The hush of a hidden sunrise draped the futuristic hub in a veil of violet mist. <words>14</words>  

Elias stood at the orchard’s edge, fingers twitching as he hesitated to step forward. <words>27</words>  

The trees, gnarled and blackened, bore fruit that pulsed faintly, as if breathing. <words>38</words>  

He had never wanted this—caretaker of a cursed orchard, bound by inheritance. <words>50</words>  

Yet, the whispers in the wind told him there were secrets buried here. <words>62</words>  

His analytically playful mind refused to let mysteries remain unsolved. <words>72</words>  

He gripped the fossilized dragon tooth in his pocket, its ridges worn smooth. <words>85</words>  

He had found it in a cave beneath a rotting farmhouse on the outskirts. <words>99</words>  

The tooth had unlocked something—visions of fire, of voices lost to time. <words>112</words>  

Elias had spent nights deciphering the patterns in the orchard’s decay. <words>124</words>  

Each tree bore scars that matched the grooves on the dragon tooth. <words>136</words>  

The connection gnawed at him, urging him deeper into the orchard’s heart. <words>149</words>  

He moved between the trees, their shadows stretching unnaturally in the dim light. <words>163</words>  

A farmhouse loomed ahead, its frame sagging, its door barely hanging on. <words>176</words>  

He had explored it before, but something told him he had missed something. <words>189</words>  

Pushing inside, he inhaled the scent of damp wood and forgotten time. <words>202</words>  

His fingers traced the carvings on the walls—symbols matching those on the tooth. <words>216</words>  

He pressed the tooth into a groove, and the floor shuddered beneath him. <words>229</words>  

A hidden compartment yawned open, revealing a book bound in brittle leather. <words>242</words>  

The pages detailed the orchard’s curse—rooted in a dragon’s dying breath. <words>255</words>  

The fruit carried echoes of its sorrow, waiting for someone to listen. <words>268</words>  

Elias felt a gleeful sorrow rise in his chest—he was that someone. <words>281</words>  

He had always wanted to be the voice of the unknown. <words>292</words>  

Now, the orchard’s whispers were his to translate, its mysteries his to reveal. <words>306</words>  

Stepping outside, he plucked a fruit, its pulse steady in his palm. <words>319</words>  

He took a bite, and the world around him shifted. <words>329</words>  

Memories not his own flooded his mind—of dragons soaring, of fire consuming. <words>343</words>  

The orchard was not dying; it was waiting to be understood. <words>355</words>  

Elias gripped the tooth tighter, a smile ghosting his lips. <words>366</words>  

He would not abandon this place, not now. <words>375</words>  

The future would know the orchard’s truth, and he would be its voice. <words>389</words>  

As the sun crested the horizon, the trees exhaled, their fruit glowing anew. <words>403</words>
