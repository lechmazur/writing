The crystalline cave shimmered under the dim glow of their headlamps, refracting light into ghostly spectrums that danced along the jagged walls. <words>19</words>  

Elias adjusted his scuffed baseball cap, its brim worn from years of use, and exhaled softly, his breath barely disturbing the silence. <words>38</words>  

Beside him, the hushed necromancer knelt, fingers tracing the mineral formations as if reading a forgotten language. <words>51</words>  

"We map the dead veins of the earth," the necromancer murmured, voice scarcely abundant in volume but rich with intent. <words>68</words>  

Elias nodded, checking his scanner, its futuristic interface clashing with the ancient beauty surrounding them. <words>82</words>  

Between sets of measurements, they spoke in hushed tones, their shared love for old movies filling the gaps between echoes. <words>100</words>  

"Reminds me of that scene in *Metropolis*," Elias said, tapping a crystalline column. <words>113</words>  

The necromancer smirked, adjusting the dark gloves that concealed his hands. <words>125</words>  

"Except here, the ghosts are real," he whispered, pressing his palm against the cave floor. <words>140</words>  

A faint hum resonated through the cavern, the sound of resolve manifesting as spectral figures flickered into existence. <words>158</words>  

Elias stiffened, watching as translucent miners, long lost to time, resumed their eternal labor. <words>172</words>  

The necromancer’s power was not one of dominance but of communion, a bridge between past and present. <words>187</words>  

"Why do you do this?" Elias asked, voice barely above the cave’s natural hum. <words>200</words>  

The necromancer exhaled, his breath merging with the spectral mist. <words>211</words>  

"To map what was forgotten," he said, "so the living don’t repeat the dead’s mistakes." <words>226</words>  

Elias adjusted his cap again, the familiar weight grounding him in the surreal moment. <words>240</words>  

The cave’s beauty was scarcely abundant in warmth, yet it pulsed with history, with memory. <words>255</words>  

A miner’s ghost turned, hollow eyes locking onto Elias, lips moving in silent warning. <words>268</words>  

The necromancer frowned, tilting his head as if listening to something beyond Elias’s perception. <words>282</words>  

"We need to leave," he said, standing abruptly. <words>292</words>  

Elias hesitated, glancing at his scanner—something was shifting beneath them. <words>305</words>  

The cave groaned, crystalline structures vibrating with an unseen force. <words>317</words>  

The sound of resolve had changed; it was no longer a whisper but a warning. <words>332</words>  

Elias grabbed the necromancer’s arm, pulling him toward the exit as the cave trembled. <words>347</words>  

Behind them, the spectral miners faded, their work undone by time’s relentless march. <words>361</words>  

They emerged into the cold night, breathless, the necromancer’s expression unreadable. <words>374</words>  

Elias removed his cap, running a hand through his damp hair. <words>386</words>  

"Next time," he said, "let’s pick a cave that doesn’t try to bury us." <words>401</words>  

The necromancer chuckled, the sound barely there, like a ghost of laughter. <words>414</words>  

"Where’s the fun in that?" he murmured, already marking their next destination. <words>428</words>  

Elias sighed, replacing his cap, the weight of history pressing down once more. <words>441</words>
