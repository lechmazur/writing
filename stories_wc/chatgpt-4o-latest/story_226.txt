The orchardist moved through the resonance testing facility with the slow, deliberate steps of a man who had spent too long among dying trees. <words>17</words>  

His hands, calloused from years of pruning lifeless branches, clutched a sun-bleached desert skull wrapped in oilcloth. <words>33</words>  

The hush where past met prophecy had settled over the facility, a silence thick with the weight of forgotten songs. <words>48</words>  

He had come to contain something precious—something lost. <words>55</words>  

The lullabies of vanished generations, their echoes trapped in the bones of the land, waited to be reclaimed. <words>69</words>  

His craft was not in fruit but in memory, in the careful tending of what others had abandoned. <words>83</words>  

The skull in his hands was more than a relic; it was a vessel, humming with the resonance of voices long stilled. <words>99</words>  

He had acquired it via black-market transactions, trading the last of his orchard’s yield for a chance to hear the past. <words>115</words>  

The facility’s walls pulsed with artificial light, a sterile glow that made everything feel both genuine and false. <words>129</words>  

He understood that contradiction well—his own existence was a paradox, a man rooted in decay yet desperate to preserve. <words>144</words>  

The technicians barely acknowledged him as he stepped into the chamber, their focus on the machinery that would extract the echoes. <words>160</words>  

He placed the skull on the platform, his fingers lingering on its surface, feeling the faint tremor of something waiting to be freed. <words>177</words>  

The lead technician, a woman with tired eyes, adjusted the dials, her voice hushed. <words>188</words>  

“This will take precision,” she murmured. <words>193</words>  

He nodded, his throat too tight for words. <words>200</words>  

The machine whirred to life, sending waves of sound through the skull, coaxing out the lullabies buried within. <words>215</words>  

At first, there was only static, a whisper of wind across forgotten graves. <words>226</words>  

Then, a note—thin, wavering, but unmistakably human. <words>236</words>  

His breath caught as the melody unfolded, a song sung to children who had long since turned to dust. <words>250</words>  

The orchardist closed his eyes, letting the sound wash over him, filling the hollow spaces inside. <words>263</words>  

This was his craft, his pride—not in growing, but in gathering, in salvaging what time sought to erase. <words>278</words>  

The technician glanced at him, her expression unreadable. <words>286</words>  

“You understand what you’ve done?” she asked. <words>293</words>  

He opened his eyes, the weight of the moment pressing against his ribs. <words>304</words>  

“I’ve contained something that was slipping away,” he said. <words>313</words>  

The machine continued its work, drawing forth lullabies that had once soothed restless infants beneath ancient skies. <words>328</words>  

Each note was a thread in a tapestry of loss, woven back together by his hands. <words>341</words>  

The orchardist stood in haggard awe, listening as the past sang itself whole again. <words>353</words>  

For the first time in years, he felt something bloom inside him. <words>364</words>  

Not fruit, not leaves—just the quiet, aching beauty of remembrance. <words>376</words>  

And in that hush, where past met prophecy, he knew his work was not yet done. <words>389</words>  

He would find more bones, more echoes, more songs waiting to be reclaimed. <words>401</words>  

The orchard was gone, but his harvest had only just begun. <words>411</words>
