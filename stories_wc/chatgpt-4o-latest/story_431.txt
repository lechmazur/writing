Elias sat in the cipher decoder’s office, his fingers absently knitting a pattern he didn’t fully understand. <words>14</words>  

The room smelled of old paper and dust, the air thick with forgotten echoes of past secrets. <words>28</words>  

He had come here not for codes, but for escape—from the desolate wasteland that stretched beyond the city’s edge. <words>43</words>  

His mind worked in illogically logical ways, a paradox that made sense only to him. <words>55</words>  

Dancing had once been his refuge, but movement alone could not carry him beyond the invisible walls of his world. <words>71</words>  

Instead, he had turned to the stars, tracing their paths across astronomical charts spread before him. <words>85</words>  

Each constellation was a step, each orbit a rhythm, each celestial body a partner in a silent waltz. <words>99</words>  

He had learned to read them as others read words, finding patterns where none should exist. <words>112</words>  

The habit had formed slowly, like the careful repetition of a dance until it became second nature. <words>126</words>  

Knitting helped him think, the steady motion of his hands grounding him in the present. <words>139</words>  

The yarn twisted between his fingers, forming intricate knots that mirrored the coded messages on the desk. <words>153</words>  

He had been hired to decipher them, but he knew the real puzzle was himself. <words>165</words>  

The wasteland outside was not just a place—it was a state of mind, a vast emptiness he longed to escape. <words>181</words>  

His mental fortitude had been tested time and again, but he refused to break. <words>193</words>  

Instead, he danced in his mind, his thoughts moving in careful, deliberate steps. <words>206</words>  

The charts before him whispered of distant worlds, places untouched by the desolation he knew too well. <words>220</words>  

He traced a line between two stars, imagining a bridge between here and there. <words>233</words>  

The office was silent except for the soft clicking of his knitting needles. <words>245</words>  

He had learned to listen to the forgotten echoes, to find meaning in what others discarded. <words>259</words>  

The habit of searching, of decoding, of moving forward even when standing still—this was his true dance. <words>274</words>  

He folded the chart carefully, tucking it into his bag alongside his unfinished knitting. <words>287</words>  

The wasteland would not hold him forever. <words>292</words>  

One day, he would step beyond it, guided by the stars and the rhythm he had taught himself to follow. <words>308</words>  

For now, he would continue his work, unraveling mysteries one thread at a time. <words>321</words>  

The cipher decoder’s office was not a prison, but a rehearsal space for the escape he was choreographing. <words>337</words>  

He stood, stretching his limbs as if preparing for a performance only he could see. <words>350</words>  

The stars waited, the echoes whispered, and Elias danced on. <words>360</words>
