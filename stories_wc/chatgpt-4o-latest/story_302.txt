The airship lurched as the dining room filled with the clatter of silverware and the murmurs of poets lost in their own verses. <words>19</words>  

At the center of it all sat Veylan, a bard whose voice carried no melody, only the raw scrape of words against silence. <words>38</words>  

He was fiercely nonchalant, his indifference a shield against the jeers of those who believed music required harmony. <words>53</words>  

Before him lay a stained manuscript, its pages warped by time and neglect, filled with cryptic verses that spoke of taming chaos itself. <words>72</words>  

Legends, twisted by word-of-mouth, claimed that whoever deciphered its meaning could kiss the horizon of madness and return unscathed. <words>91</words>  

Veylan did not seek sanity, nor did he fear the abyss; he merely wished to understand the rhythm of disorder. <words>108</words>  

A poet across the table sneered, swirling his wine. <words>115</words>  

"Your words stumble like a drunkard in the dark," he said. <words>125</words>  

Veylan smirked, striking a tinderbox to light the candle beside him. <words>137</words>  

"Perhaps," he said, "but even the lost find paths unknown to the sure-footed." <words>151</words>  

The flame flickered, casting shadows over the manuscript’s ink-stained lines. <words>162</words>  

The airship groaned as turbulence rattled the chandeliers, and gasps rippled through the room. <words>176</words>  

Veylan traced a finger over the manuscript’s words, feeling their weight, their defiance of order. <words>189</words>  

The legends had always been vague, but he had pieced together enough to know that chaos was not destruction—it was potential. <words>209</words>  

A steward stumbled past, dropping a tray of glasses that shattered like brittle constellations. <words>222</words>  

Veylan barely blinked. <words>225</words>  

He stood, raising his voice above the murmurs. <words>233</words>  

"Chaos is not to be feared," he declared. <words>241</words>  

"It is the breath between notes, the space between stars, the silence that makes sound matter." <words>257</words>  

The poets scoffed, but some leaned in, intrigued despite themselves. <words>268</words>  

Veylan flipped a page, revealing a passage smeared with ink and time. <words>280</words>  

He read aloud, his voice jagged but unwavering. <words>289</words>  

The words twisted through the air like smoke, curling into the minds of those who listened. <words>303</words>  

The airship trembled again, but this time, it felt like a heartbeat rather than a warning. <words>317</words>  

Veylan smiled, knowing he had not tamed chaos, but danced with it. <words>329</words>  

And in that moment, the horizon of madness felt close enough to kiss. <words>341</words>
