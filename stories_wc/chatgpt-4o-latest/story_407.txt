Dr. Elias Vance had spent his life chasing celestial phenomena, yet misfortune clung to him like a shadow. <words>19</words> His latest expedition, meant to study the effects of cosmic radiation on subterranean flora, had led him underground—far deeper than intended. <words>41</words> The shortcut through a collapsed tunnel had seemed promising until the ground gave way beneath his feet. <words>54</words> He landed hard, his mariner’s sextant clattering across the stone floor of an impossible city. <words>67</words>  

Towering structures of carved obsidian loomed over him, their surfaces slick with bioluminescent moss. <words>79</words> The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and something acrid, almost reptilian. <words>92</words> He barely had time to gather his bearings before a group of lizard-like beings emerged from the shadows. <words>106</words>  

They moved with a systematic chaos—each step deliberate, yet unpredictable. <words>116</words> Their golden eyes flickered with intelligence as they encircled him, their forked tongues tasting the air. <words>130</words> Elias raised his hands, his mind racing for a way to communicate. <words>141</words>  

One of them, taller than the rest, stepped forward and spoke in a guttural yet strangely melodic tongue. <words>155</words> Elias, ever the scientist, listened intently, recognizing patterns in their speech. <words>167</words> He reached for his notebook, but the leader hissed, pointing at his sextant instead. <words>180</words>  

Realization struck—these creatures navigated their world much like ancient mariners, using celestial alignments even underground. <words>195</words> He lifted the sextant carefully, aligning it with the faint glow of phosphorescent fungi above. <words>209</words> The lizard leader watched, then nodded approvingly. <words>216</words>  

Encouraged, Elias spoke, choosing his words with precision. <words>224</words> “I study plants,” he said, gesturing to the moss. <words>232</words> The leader’s eyes narrowed, then turned to a nearby wall covered in twisting vines. <words>244</words>  

A whispered command, and two warriors stepped forward, sparring with swift, fluid movements. <words>256</words> Their strikes were not meant to harm but to demonstrate something—perhaps a test. <words>268</words> Elias watched, then mimicked their stance, awkward but willing. <words>278</words>  

The leader grinned, revealing rows of needle-like teeth. <words>286</words> “Spoken truths,” he rasped in broken English. <words>294</words> “You seek knowledge. We seek understanding.” <words>301</words>  

Elias exhaled, the tension easing. <words>307</words> Between colliding interests, a fragile bridge had formed. <words>315</words> He had taken a shortcut and found an unexpected encounter—one that might redefine his research. <words>330</words>  

The lizard people led him deeper into their city, where plants pulsed with an eerie luminescence. <words>344</words> He studied their behaviors, noting how they reacted to sound, movement, even emotion. <words>357</words>  

For the first time in his unlucky career, Elias felt he was exactly where he was meant to be. <words>371</words> The bitter honey of fate had finally sweetened. <words>380</words>
