The floating cloud café drifted above the silent plains, its lanterns flickering uncertainly in the unexplained blackout. <words>16</words>  

Elias, a soft-voiced guide, traced the embroidered patterns on his vest, feeling the raised threads like a map of forgotten paths. <words>36</words>  

His companion, Mira, sat across from him, her fingers wrapped around a cup of tea that had long since gone cold. <words>55</words>  

They had taken a different train than usual to reach this place, drawn by the promise of something constantly rare. <words>75</words>  

Outside, the plains stretched endlessly, their silence pressing against the café’s walls like an unspoken scream. <words>91</words>  

Elias had spent years chasing that silence, believing it held a power he could harness. <words>106</words>  

Mira, ever the skeptic, had followed not out of belief, but out of quiet partnership. <words>122</words>  

“You still think it’s here?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. <words>135</words>  

Elias nodded, his fingers tightening around the fabric of his vest. <words>147</words>  

“The scream of the silent plains isn’t something you hear,” he murmured. <words>161</words>  

“It’s something you feel, something that fills you with blissful agony.” <words>174</words>  

Mira exhaled, watching the lanterns sway as the café drifted. <words>186</words>  

The blackout had stolen the hum of machinery, leaving only the sound of their breathing. <words>202</words>  

Elias stood, his movements slow but filled with zeal. <words>214</words>  

He stepped toward the edge of the café, where the mist curled like restless spirits. <words>230</words>  

Mira followed, her skepticism warring with curiosity. <words>241</words>  

“What if it’s just silence?” she asked. <words>252</words>  

Elias smiled, the kind of smile that carried both certainty and sorrow. <words>266</words>  

“Then we listen harder.” <words>271</words>  

He closed his eyes, letting the weight of the plains settle into his bones. <words>285</words>  

The blackout had stripped away distractions, leaving only the raw essence of the world. <words>301</words>  

Mira hesitated, then reached for his hand, their fingers brushing lightly. <words>315</words>  

A quiet partnership, built not on belief, but on trust. <words>328</words>  

The silence deepened, pressing against them like an unseen force. <words>341</words>  

Then, in the stillness, they felt it—a pulse, a tremor, a scream without sound. <words>359</words>  

Elias gasped, his embroidered vest fluttering as if caught in an invisible wind. <words>374</words>  

Mira’s grip tightened, her skepticism shattering in the face of something undeniable. <words>389</words>  

The café trembled, the lanterns flickering wildly before the blackout swallowed them whole. <words>405</words>  

In the darkness, the silent plains finally spoke. <words>414</words>
