The forgotten recipe library smelled of dust and regret, a fitting place for a man who had lived too many lives. <words>19</words>  

Elliot, once a goldfish and now a caretaker of them, traced his fingers over the spines of books no one read. <words>38</words>  

He had spent years tending to creatures that barely remembered him, a poetic punishment for a past he couldn’t recall. <words>57</words>  

A toy soldier with a missing arm sat abandoned on a shelf, its plastic face frozen in a grimace of determination. <words>78</words>  

Elliot picked it up, feeling an odd kinship with the broken thing, both of them remnants of something unfinished. <words>97</words>  

Outside, the sky darkened without warning, and a sudden downpour rattled the library’s windows like impatient fingers. <words>116</words>  

A woman burst through the door, shaking rain from her coat, her eyes scanning the room before landing on him. <words>135</words>  

“You’re Elliot, aren’t you?” she asked, her voice tentatively fierce, as if testing the weight of her own certainty. <words>154</words>  

He hesitated, guilt curling in his stomach like a fishhook snagging something deep. <words>167</words>  

“I was,” he admitted, setting the toy soldier back on the shelf as if it might answer for him. <words>186</words>  

She stepped closer, her presence unsettling in a way that made him want to both flee and listen. <words>205</words>  

“My grandfather used to talk about you,” she said, pulling a yellowed paper from her pocket. <words>222</words>  

Elliot’s breath caught as he recognized the handwriting—his own, from a life he barely remembered. <words>239</words>  

A recipe, scrawled in ink that had bled at the edges, a dish meant to alleviate something unnamed. <words>258</words>  

“I found this in his things,” she continued, watching him carefully. <words>271</words>  

“He said you were trying to disrupt a stagnant tradition, but you disappeared before you could.” <words>290</words>  

Elliot swallowed, the weight of forgotten intentions pressing against his ribs. <words>303</words>  

“I was trying to change something,” he admitted, “but I don’t remember what.” <words>320</words>  

She unfolded the paper, smoothing it against the counter. <words>331</words>  

“It’s a recipe for a dish no one makes anymore,” she said. <words>344</words>  

“Something about it scared people.” <words>353</words>  

Elliot stared at the words, the ink swimming before his eyes like fish in a murky pond. <words>372</words>  

The rain outside softened, as if the world itself was holding its breath. <words>389</words>  

Before the doctor’s chart could confirm a turning point, before he could be told what was inevitable, he had a choice. <words>412</words>  

He could let the past haunt him, or he could finish what he started. <words>429</words>  

With a slow, deliberate motion, he reached for the book beside the toy soldier. <words>448</words>  

“Let’s cook,” he said, and for the first time in lifetimes, he felt whole. <words>467</words>
