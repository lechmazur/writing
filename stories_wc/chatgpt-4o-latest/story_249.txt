The city of forgotten fountains held its breath at the pause between raindrops. <words>12</words>  

A hush settled over the cracked stone plazas, where water once danced but now slumbered in dry basins. <words>27</words>  

In an alleyway, beneath the flickering glow of a neon pawnshop sign, a man without a mask adjusted his coat. <words>42</words>  

He was known as Calder, the unmasked vigilante, a man who pursued justice with a peculiar, almost lazy ambition. <words>57</words>  

His crusade was not for vengeance or glory but for something far stranger—he sought to collect traditional games. <words>72</words>  

Marbles, knucklebones, ancient board games carved into wood—each held a history, a resilience against time’s erosion. <words>87</words>  

Tonight, he was after a rare prize: a centuries-old set of fox and geese, rumored to be hidden in a collector’s vault. <words>104</words>  

But Calder never broke in—he lured his targets into revealing their secrets. <words>115</words>  

His method? Analyzing gossip from barbershop quartet rehearsals, where the city’s elite unknowingly sang their indiscretions. <words>130</words>  

He had spent weeks listening to harmonized whispers between verses, piecing together the location of the game set. <words>145</words>  

The collector, a retired dentist named Lorne Vespian, had boasted of his treasures between warm-ups and refrains. <words>160</words>  

Calder knew Vespian’s weakness—his obsession with rare tools, particularly an antique dentist’s drill from the 1800s. <words>175</words>  

So Calder acquired one, a rusted relic with an ornate handle, and arranged a meeting. <words>188</words>  

Vespian arrived at the appointed café, his fingers twitching with anticipation as he eyed the drill. <words>201</words>  

Calder leaned back, exuding the air of a man who had all the time in the world. <words>214</words>  

“I hear you appreciate craftsmanship,” Calder said, turning the drill slowly in his hands. <words>227</words>  

Vespian’s eyes gleamed. “Exquisite. Where did you find it?” <words>236</words>  

Calder smiled. “A trade, perhaps? I’m more interested in games than tools.” <words>249</words>  

Vespian hesitated, then chuckled. “You’re an odd one. But I do have something you might like.” <words>262</words>  

An hour later, Calder walked away with the fox and geese set wrapped in velvet. <words>275</words>  

The city exhaled as the rain resumed, filling the forgotten fountains with fleeting ripples. <words>288</words>  

Calder paused by one, watching the water reclaim its place, a quiet testament to resilience. <words>301</words>  

He traced the worn edges of the game board, feeling the weight of history in his hands. <words>314</words>  

Every piece he collected was a story, a reminder that even forgotten things could endure. <words>327</words>  

With a satisfied sigh, he disappeared into the night, already listening for the next whispered clue. <words>340</words>
