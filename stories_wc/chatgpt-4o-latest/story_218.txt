The forgotten clock tower loomed over the city, its hands frozen at an hour no one remembered. <words>16</words> Inside, Elias sat hunched over his latest board game design, sketching intricate pathways on yellowed parchment. <words>30</words> He had spent years in solitude, crafting worlds for others to explore while he remained unseen. <words>42</words> Tonight, however, his focus wavered as he traced the outline of a phantom carnival ticket resting beside him. <words>57</words>  

He had found it by chance at an improv show, tucked beneath his chair like a secret waiting to be uncovered. <words>73</words> The ticket shimmered, both there and not, its edges curling in a breeze that did not exist. <words>87</words> It was metaphysically physical, a contradiction that unsettled him yet pulled him closer. <words>99</words>  

Elias had never been one for crowds, but something about the ticket whispered of escape. <words>111</words> Not from the tower, not from his solitude, but from the endless shadowboxing with his own demons. <words>126</words> He had spent years designing games where others could belong, yet he had never stepped into one himself. <words>142</words>  

As he sketched, the lines of his board blurred, shifting into something unfamiliar. <words>153</words> The carnival ticket pulsed, and suddenly, the forgotten clock tower was no longer silent. <words>166</words> A distant calliope played, its notes curling through the air like smoke. <words>178</words>  

Elias stood, heart pounding, as the walls of the tower stretched and twisted. <words>189</words> The gears above groaned to life, grinding against time itself. <words>200</words> He clutched the ticket, feeling its weight shift between real and unreal. <words>213</words>  

A door appeared where none had been before, its frame lined with flickering carnival lights. <words>226</words> He hesitated, then stepped through. <words>231</words>  

The world beyond was a carnival unlike any he had known, its pathways mirroring the designs he had drawn. <words>247</words> Figures moved through the stalls, their faces familiar yet just out of reach. <words>259</words> He recognized them—characters from his games, brought to life. <words>270</words>  

A woman in a harlequin mask approached, holding out a board game piece shaped like him. <words>284</words> “You’ve always belonged here,” she said, her voice carrying the near distance of a memory. <words>298</words>  

Elias swallowed, his fingers brushing the piece. <words>305</words> The carnival pulsed, the air thick with the scent of spun sugar and ink. <words>317</words> He had spent years creating worlds for others, but this one had been waiting for him. <words>332</words>  

For the first time, he stepped into the game—not as its designer, but as a player. <words>346</words> The clock tower’s bells tolled behind him, marking a time that finally moved forward. <words>360</words>
