The hush settled over the condemned building like a held breath, the moment before destruction stretching thin. <words>19</words>  

On the quantum beach beyond its crumbling walls, the summoner prowled, his footprints flickering in and out of existence. <words>38</words>  

He was alone, as always, save for the shifting echoes of himself that the beach’s strange physics conjured. <words>56</words>  

Each reflection of him moved just a fraction behind, mimicking his every step with eerie precision. <words>74</words>  

But he did not seek to follow—he sought to outshine. <words>85</words>  

In his hand, he clutched a brittle leaf, its veins forming an oddly authentic map. <words>103</words>  

It had been passed down through generations, a relic of his family’s peculiar holiday tradition. <words>121</words>  

Every year, they celebrated the Day of Invention by crafting something entirely new. <words>138</words>  

Not just new—something that had never existed before, something that defied replication. <words>155</words>  

His ancestors had built machines that whispered, songs that could only be sung once. <words>172</words>  

But he, the last of them, had chosen summoning. <words>184</words>  

Not of spirits or beasts, but of ideas, of things that had never been imagined. <words>202</words>  

The map on the leaf led to the heart of the beach, where time folded in on itself. <words>221</words>  

There, he would summon the spark of invention itself, something no reflection could mimic. <words>239</words>  

The condemned building groaned behind him, its final moments ticking away. <words>254</words>  

He reached the center of the beach, where the sand shimmered like liquid glass. <words>271</words>  

Kneeling, he pressed the leaf into the ground, whispering the words of his lineage. <words>289</words>  

The air crackled, the quantum tide pulling back as if in reverence. <words>304</words>  

From the sand rose a shape, shifting, unstable, something that had never been before. <words>322</words>  

It pulsed, resisting definition, refusing to be mirrored. <words>334</words>  

His reflections hesitated, their forms flickering, unable to replicate what had no precedent. <words>353</words>  

For the first time, he was ahead of them, beyond them. <words>366</words>  

The building behind him shuddered, the final detonation imminent. <words>381</words>  

He stood, triumphant, as the structure collapsed, dust swallowing the past. <words>398</words>  

The spark of invention remained, untethered, a thing only he had brought into being. <words>416</words>  

And in that corroded rapture, he knew—he had outshone himself at last. <words>432</words>
