The abandoned schoolhouse stood at the heart of the ghost town, its windows shattered, its walls whispering secrets of a forgotten past. <words>19</words>  

Inside, under the flickering glow of a dying lantern, Felix shuffled a deck of cards with the ease of a man who had never lost. <words>40</words>  

He was a gambler, a lucky one, the kind who typically never walked away empty-handed. <words>54</words>  

But tonight, luck was not his concern—tonight, he sought something greater. <words>66</words>  

The others sat in a circle, their faces half-lit, half-shadowed, waiting for the game to begin. <words>83</words>  

A dusty bottle stood at the center, its glass clouded with time, ready to spin. <words>98</words>  

Felix placed a tattered botanical diary beside him, its pages filled with sketches of plants that no longer grew. <words>118</words>  

It had belonged to his grandfather, a man who had once believed in the power of nature before the world had turned barren. <words>140</words>  

He had come here to defy the gravity of hopelessness, to prove that something still mattered. <words>157</words>  

With a flick of his wrist, he spun the bottle, watching as it wobbled and slowed. <words>174</words>  

It pointed to Mara, a woman with eyes like dying embers, who typically never spoke of the past. <words>193</words>  

She exhaled and placed her hand on the diary, her fingers tracing the inked leaves. <words>209</words>  

“My father tried to duplicate life,” she confessed, her voice steady. <words>222</words>  

“He thought he could bring back what was lost, but power corrupted him.” <words>237</words>  

Felix nodded, understanding too well how power twisted even the best intentions. <words>252</words>  

The bottle spun again, landing on Jace, a man who had once been a scientist before knowledge became a currency of control. <words>273</words>  

He hesitated, then spoke. <words>277</words>  

“I helped build the machines that drained the earth,” he admitted. <words>289</words>  

“I thought we were saving humanity, but we were only feeding the hunger of those in power.” <words>308</words>  

The room fell silent, the weight of their confessions pressing against the rotting walls. <words>324</words>  

Felix picked up the diary, flipping to a page where a single flower had been pressed between the sheets. <words>343</words>  

“This was the last one,” he said. <words>351</words>  

Mara reached out, her fingers brushing the brittle petals. <words>363</words>  

“We can’t duplicate the past,” she murmured. <words>375</words>  

“No,” Felix agreed, “but we can choose what comes next.” <words>389</words>  

Outside, the wind howled through the empty streets, carrying their voices into the hush of the unremembered future. <words>410</words>  

The bottle spun one last time, but no one watched where it landed. <words>424</words>  

They had already decided their fate. <words>432</words>
