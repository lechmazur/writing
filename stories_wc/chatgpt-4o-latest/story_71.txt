The sentient scarecrow stood atop the fossilized giant’s ribcage, staring at the lines in the earth below. <words>16</words>  

They crisscrossed like veins, ancient and deliberate, whispering of forgotten paths between parallel worlds. <words>32</words>  

The wind rattled through his straw-bound frame, but he felt nothing—only the weight of his oath. <words>47</words>  

Long ago, he had sworn to guard the passage, though he no longer remembered for whom. <words>63</words>  

A lace fan, tattered and forgotten, lay at his feet, its delicate patterns mirroring the lines below. <words>80</words>  

It was the only relic of the one who had given him purpose, though their name had faded. <words>98</words>  

He bent down, his burlap fingers tracing the fan’s edges, feeling the echoes of a promise. <words>114</words>  

The world flickered, and suddenly, he was elsewhere—inside the virtual reality where travelers sought passage. <words>131</words>  

Here, he encountered them: wanderers, seekers, those who wished to cross between realms. <words>146</words>  

They came with questions, with desperation, with greed, and he judged them all the same. <words>162</words>  

A man in a crimson cloak approached, his eyes sharp, his hands steady. <words>175</words>  

“I seek the path,” the man said, his voice devoid of hesitation. <words>188</words>  

The scarecrow tilted his head, his stitched mouth unmoving. <words>199</words>  

“Why?” he asked, though he already knew the answer. <words>211</words>  

“To claim what was lost,” the man replied, his fingers twitching toward his belt. <words>226</words>  

The scarecrow saw the glint of a dagger, the intent behind the man’s stance. <words>241</words>  

With fervent apathy, he moved—not out of anger, not out of fear, but duty. <words>257</words>  

His arm extended, straw twisting into a sharpened point, and he skewered the man clean through. <words>274</words>  

The virtual world shimmered, the illusion breaking, and the scarecrow stood once more atop the fossilized giant. <words>292</words>  

The body was gone, erased by the shifting realities, but the oath remained. <words>306</words>  

He looked down at the lace fan again, its fragile beauty untouched by time. <words>321</words>  

Somewhere, in some forgotten past, he had made a promise, and he would keep it. <words>336</words>  

The lines in the earth pulsed, waiting for the next traveler, the next test. <words>350</words>  

He did not care who they were, only that they came, and that he remained. <words>366</words>  

Between parallel worlds, between forgotten oaths and fading memories, the scarecrow stood eternal. <words>380</words>  

The wind howled through the bones of the giant, but he did not listen. <words>394</words>  

He had no need for sound, no need for feeling—only the duty that bound him. <words>410</words>  

And so, he waited. <words>414</words>
