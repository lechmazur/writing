The last stone settled into place, sealing the abandoned wall with a finality that made Liora’s breath hitch. <words>16</words>  

She wiped her hands on her linen apron, the scent of crushed thyme and salt lingering on her fingers. <words>31</words>  

The coral restoration station stood quiet behind her, waves lapping against the pylons like a heartbeat she could not steady. <words>47</words>  

She had come here to hush the hollow echoes of shame, to mend something beyond the reef. <words>61</words>  

The letters had led her here—forgotten pages tucked inside a vintage sewing kit, their ink faded but their meaning sharp. <words>78</words>  

She had memorized every word, tracing the loops and slants of a hand she once knew. <words>91</words>  

Her mother’s voice lived in those letters, a woman both academically artistic and recklessly free. <words>105</words>  

She had written of coral, of restoration, of a world that could be stitched back together like torn fabric. <words>121</words>  

Liora had doubted for so long, doubted her mother’s dreams, doubted her own hands. <words>134</words>  

But here, among the reefs, she felt the breathless longing of something unfinished. <words>147</words>  

She knelt by the water’s edge, fingers brushing the delicate branches of a transplanted coral. <words>161</words>  

It was fragile, yet determined, growing despite the odds. <words>170</words>  

She understood that now. <words>173</words>  

The sewing kit rested beside her, its compartments still holding needles, thread, and the weight of memory. <words>189</words>  

Her mother had stitched fabric, but she had also stitched hope into words Liora had once ignored. <words>204</words>  

She opened the kit, unfolding the last letter, reading it aloud to the waves. <words>218</words>  

“You will doubt, my love, but doubt is the heart’s way of asking to be proven wrong.” <words>233</words>  

Tears blurred the ink, but she did not stop. <words>243</words>  

She read until the wind carried the words away, until the reef seemed to breathe with her. <words>258</words>  

The station lights flickered on as dusk settled, casting golden reflections on the water. <words>272</words>  

She had spent years running from her mother’s legacy, fearing she would never be enough. <words>287</words>  

But here, after the last stone was set, she understood. <words>298</words>  

Restoration was not just for coral—it was for hearts, for histories, for the spaces doubt had hollowed. <words>314</words>  

She picked up the sewing kit, tucking the letters inside, not to forget but to carry forward. <words>329</words>  

The reef would grow, the wall would stand, and she would no longer run. <words>342</words>  

She turned toward the station, the scent of salt and thyme still clinging to her skin. <words>356</words>  

Tomorrow, she would plant more coral. <words>362</words>  

Tomorrow, she would write her own letters. <words>368</words>  

But tonight, she would let the ocean whisper back. <words>375</words>
