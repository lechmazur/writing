The wishing-well attendant slouched against the damp stone wall, fingers idly sifting through his collection of foreign coins. <words>14</words> Each piece bore the weight of a wish, a hope, a desperate plea cast into the abyss. <words>28</words> He had long since stopped believing in their power. <words>34</words> The well was nothing but a pit of rusted dreams. <words>42</words>  

Tonight, however, was different. <words>46</words> The air carried the scent of old rain and unsettled dust. <words>55</words> He traced the ridges of a coin from a country he had never seen. <words>66</words> The grooves felt like scars, deep and unspoken. <words>74</words>  

A shadow flickered across the cobbled ground, stretching unnaturally in the moonlight. <words>84</words> He exhaled slowly, intensely relaxed despite the creeping unease. <words>93</words> The patterns of the shadows told him what he needed to know. <words>104</words> Someone was coming. <words>107</words>  

He stood, pocketing the coins, and followed the shifting darkness. <words>116</words> The path led him through an alleyway, past the forgotten remnants of a secret agent escape route. <words>129</words> The tunnels beneath the city had once been arteries of espionage, now clogged with time. <words>141</words>  

At the crossing of two unwritten paths, he stopped. <words>149</words> The air was thick with the weight of unseen eyes. <words>158</words> He had spent years trying to out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts. <words>170</words>  

A figure emerged from the gloom, their presence as familiar as regret. <words>181</words> "You still collect them?" the voice asked, low and edged with something unreadable. <words>193</words>  

He pulled a coin from his pocket, letting it glint in the dim light. <words>204</words> "They tell stories," he murmured. <words>208</words>  

The figure stepped closer, their own scars barely hidden beneath the collar of a worn coat. <words>220</words> "And do they corroborate what you already know?" <words>228</words>  

He considered the question, rolling the coin between his fingers. <words>237</words> "They remind me," he said finally. <words>243</words>  

The figure nodded, as if that was answer enough. <words>251</words> The past could not be rewritten, only carried. <words>259</words>  

Together, they followed the shadow patterns deeper into the forgotten tunnels. <words>268</words> The city above them slept, unaware of the weight of scars moving beneath its streets. <words>280</words>  

And in the darkness, the wishing-well attendant finally understoodâ€”some wishes were never meant to be granted. <words>293</words>
