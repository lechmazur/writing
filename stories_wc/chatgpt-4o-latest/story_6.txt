The minstrel, a man of sharp wit and sharper doubts, stood before the abandoned disappearing ink factory, clutching a scrap of dragon-scale armor. <words>19</words>  

He had won it in a bet against a duke who swore it was worthless, but the minstrel suspected otherwise. <words>38</words>  

The midday sun cast no shadow on the rusted pipes, and the only sound was the hush of an empty mailbox swinging in the breeze. <words>61</words>  

He had come here for one reason—to out-scheme the immortal trickster known as Veyl, whose cons had ruined kings and beggars alike. <words>86</words>  

Veyl had promised a wager: if the minstrel could present something of "impossibly plausible" value, he would win a fortune. <words>108</words>  

If he failed, he would owe Veyl a favor, and favors to immortals were debts never truly paid. <words>127</words>  

The minstrel had no gold, no army, only his reckless generosity and a mind that refused to be fooled. <words>147</words>  

He stepped inside, boots echoing against the factory’s hollowed-out floor, where vats of vanished ink had once swallowed words from history. <words>171</words>  

A hiss escaped from an ancient steam vent, whispering secrets in a language only the desperate could understand. <words>191</words>  

The minstrel listened, nodding as if the vent confirmed his suspicions. <words>203</words>  

He pulled a slingshot from his satchel, the kind a child might wield, and loaded the dragon-scale scrap. <words>224</words>  

With a flick of his wrist, he launched it into the rafters, where it struck a rusted pipe with a sharp clang. <words>248</words>  

The impact sent a cascade of invisible ink dust swirling through the air, catching the light in eerie, shimmering patterns. <words>272</words>  

From the shadows, Veyl emerged, clapping slowly, his grin as ageless as the stars. <words>289</words>  

"You amuse me, minstrel," Veyl said, his voice like silk unraveling. <words>303</words>  

"But what have you truly brought me?" <words>311</words>  

The minstrel gestured to the air, where the ink dust settled, revealing words scrawled across the walls—words that had been erased long ago. <words>337</words>  

They told of a contract, signed in blood, binding Veyl to a debt he had long since forgotten. <words>357</words>  

The trickster’s eyes widened, his smirk faltering. <words>368</words>  

"Impossibly plausible," the minstrel mused, bowing with exaggerated flair. <words>384</words>  

Veyl chuckled, shaking his head. <words>393</words>  

"You win this round," he admitted, vanishing into the ink-laden air. <words>408</words>  

The minstrel pocketed his slingshot, whistling as he stepped back into the daylight, richer in ways no gold could match. <words>432</words>
