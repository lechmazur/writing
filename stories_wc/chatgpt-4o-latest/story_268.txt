The abandoned waiting area smelled of dust and regret, its cracked tiles whispering of footsteps long gone. <words>14</words>  

A single flickering bulb cast jagged shadows, distorting the vigilante’s reflection in the antique funhouse mirror. <words>28</words>  

He studied the warped glass, tracking the subtle distortions that revealed hidden movements beyond his sight. <words>40</words>  

His art was ancient, passed down through whispers and scars, demanding patience and sacrifice. <words>52</words>  

War had taken everything from him—his family, his home, his name. <words>62</words>  

Now, he fought in silence, a ghost in the city’s underbelly. <words>73</words>  

A plain wooden bead rested in his palm, smooth from years of handling. <words>85</words>  

It was all that remained of his sister, lost in the first wave of destruction. <words>98</words>  

He rolled it between his fingers, grounding himself in its quiet weight. <words>109</words>  

The mirror flickered, revealing a figure slipping through the shadows behind him. <words>121</words>  

He turned, his movements artfully clumsy, a deception honed to perfection. <words>133</words>  

The intruder hesitated, underestimating him, as they always did. <words>144</words>  

With a sudden shift, he struck, using their own momentum against them. <words>156</words>  

They crumpled, unconscious before they hit the ground. <words>163</words>  

He exhaled, the screaming silence of the waiting area pressing in. <words>175</words>  

His earpiece crackled—another virtual call from his handler. <words>185</words>  

“You’re late,” the voice chided, laced with forced patience. <words>195</words>  

“I was busy,” he murmured, eyes never leaving the mirror. <words>206</words>  

“Did you get what we needed?” <words>211</words>  

He knelt, searching the intruder’s pockets, retrieving a small data chip. <words>223</words>  

“Yes.” <words>224</words>  

“Good. We’re close now.” <words>228</words>  

He knew what that meant—the final step in mastering the ancient art. <words>241</words>  

The price of war was steep, but he had already paid more than most. <words>254</words>  

He glanced at the bead again, a silent promise in its worn surface. <words>266</words>  

His handler’s voice softened. “You did well.” <words>273</words>  

He almost laughed. Flattery was wasted on him. <words>283</words>  

Instead, he stood, stepping over the fallen body. <words>292</words>  

The mirror rippled, revealing another distortion—another threat. <words>303</words>  

He tightened his grip on the bead and prepared to fight again. <words>314</words>  

The waiting area remained silent, but war never truly ended. <words>325</words>
