The laundromat hummed with the low drone of spinning machines, fluorescent lights flickering like dying stars. <words>16</words>  

Jonah sat on a cracked plastic chair, flipping a wilted paper flower between his fingers. <words>27</words>  

It had been given to him by a stranger, a relic of a prophecy he barely understood. <words>39</words>  

A run-in at this late-night laundromat had set everything in motion, though he hadn’t realized it at the time. <words>53</words>  

The woman who had handed him the flower had whispered, “Between scenes, the world shifts.” <words>64</words>  

Jonah, conventionally rebellious in his leather jacket and scuffed boots, had scoffed at first. <words>75</words>  

But now, as he sat waiting for his clothes to dry, the air around him shimmered. <words>88</words>  

The laundromat dissolved, replaced by towering bookshelves and the scent of ink and dust. <words>100</words>  

He stood in the study of a giant, the ceiling lost in swirling shadows. <words>111</words>  

A massive desk loomed before him, covered in parchment and quills the size of spears. <words>123</words>  

Jonah’s breath hitched as he realized he was not alone. <words>132</words>  

The giant sat in a high-backed chair, eyes like molten silver studying him. <words>144</words>  

“You have come between scenes,” the giant rumbled, voice shaking the very air. <words>155</words>  

Jonah clutched the wilted paper flower, its edges crumbling in his grip. <words>166</words>  

“I don’t understand,” he admitted, his voice small in the cavernous room. <words>177</words>  

The giant leaned forward, casting Jonah in a shadow that felt like memory itself. <words>189</words>  

“You are the prophet of glimmering transitions,” the giant said. <words>198</words>  

Jonah laughed, a sharp, disbelieving sound. <words>205</words>  

“I’m no prophet,” he said. <words>210</words>  

The giant’s lips curled into something resembling a smile. <words>218</words>  

“And yet, you are here.” <words>223</words>  

Jonah looked down at the flower, its fragile form pulsing with faint light. <words>235</words>  

He had spent his life estranging himself from expectations, from belief, from purpose. <words>247</words>  

But now, standing in the study of a being beyond comprehension, he felt something shift. <words>260</words>  

The scattered minds of the world were lost, fragmented, disconnected. <words>269</words>  

And somehow, impossibly, he was meant to unify them under a single vision. <words>280</words>  

The flower in his hand unfurled, its petals regaining color, shimmering with possibility. <words>292</words>  

Jonah exhaled, the weight of understanding settling over him like a second skin. <words>304</words>  

The giant nodded, as if hearing his unspoken acceptance. <words>312</words>  

“The world is always between scenes,” the giant murmured. <words>320</words>  

Jonah closed his eyes, feeling the transition begin again. <words>329</words>  

When he opened them, he was back in the laundromat, the hum of machines grounding him. <words>342</words>  

The paper flower in his hand was no longer wilted. <words>350</words>  

It glowed softly, a beacon of what was to come. <words>359</words>  

Jonah stood, stepping into the night, ready to begin. <words>367</words>
