The coral reef city of Valtess shimmered beneath the waves, its bioluminescent towers casting eerie glows through the currents. <words>19</words>  

Among its winding tunnels, a zealot assassin named Oris moved with calculatedly playful grace, his every step a dance between devotion and death. <words>39</words>  

Clutched in his hand was a faded carnival prize plush, its once-bright colors now dulled by time and salt. <words>55</words>  

He had won it as a child, back when innocence still clung to him like seafoam to the rocks. <words>71</words>  

Now, it served as a reminder—of what he had lost, of what he sought to reclaim through his work. <words>89</words>  

Oris had been hired to consolidate the fractured factions of Valtess, not through diplomacy, but through reversed echoes of their own sins. <words>109</words>  

He would retell an epic, but from the villain’s view, forcing the city to see its own reflection in the abyss. <words>127</words>  

During nature walks through the coral gardens, he whispered his version of history to those who would listen. <words>143</words>  

He spoke of the so-called hero who had drowned dissenters, of the rulers who had rewritten their crimes as triumphs. <words>161</words>  

His words rippled through the currents, bouncing back distorted yet undeniable, forcing the people to question their own morality. <words>181</words>  

One evening, as he perched atop a spiraled reef, a scholar named Lir approached, curiosity flickering in his eyes. <words>199</words>  

“You twist the past like a carnival mirror,” Lir said, his voice both amused and wary. <words>213</words>  

Oris tossed the plush into the water between them, watching it drift. <words>225</words>  

“History is already twisted,” he replied, his tone laced with humorous solemnity. <words>239</words>  

“I merely reverse the echoes, so the truth can be heard.” <words>251</words>  

Lir studied him, then the plush, before nodding. <words>261</words>  

“If you succeed, what then?” he asked. <words>271</words>  

Oris smiled, a predator’s grin softened by something almost wistful. <words>285</words>  

“Then Valtess will know its own reflection,” he said. <words>297</words>  

“And perhaps, for the first time, it will choose to change.” <words>311</words>  

The scholar chuckled, shaking his head. <words>321</words>  

“You are either a madman or a prophet.” <words>333</words>  

Oris retrieved the plush, squeezing it once before tucking it away. <words>347</words>  

“Perhaps both,” he mused, before vanishing into the depths. <words>361</words>
