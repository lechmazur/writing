The last call at the diner on the corner had come and gone, leaving only the hum of the neon sign and the rhythmic crash of waves from the parallel universe beach beyond the parking lot. <words>26</words>  

Jasper sat in his usual booth, his wooden puppet, Felix, propped against the salt shaker, its painted grin frozen in perpetual amusement. <words>46</words>  

He traced the ridges of a cardboard coffee sleeve, his fingers absorbing the warmth of his untouched drink, while his mind cataloged the shifting clouds outside. <words>69</words>  

Jasper had spent years archiving weather patterns, convinced they held the key to something greater—something no one else seemed to notice. <words>91</words>  

Felix, of course, spoke for him, his voice bright and unshaken, a contrast to Jasper’s silence. <words>108</words>  

“You see that sky, pal?” Felix chirped, his voice carrying Jasper’s euphoric agitation. “That’s a storm brewing, but not the bad kind—the kind that changes things.” <words>138</words>  

The waitress, a woman with tired eyes and a patient smile, refilled his coffee and patted his hand. <words>157</words>  

“You always see something in the clouds, don’t you, hon?” she said, her tone bordering on patronizing. <words>176</words>  

Felix chuckled. “And you always see something in me, don’t you?” <words>191</words>  

She laughed, shaking her head, and walked away, leaving Jasper to his thoughts. <words>209</words>  

His phone buzzed, and as he reached for it, he accidentally answered a call instead of silencing it. <words>230</words>  

A voice—his sister’s—filtered through. <words>239</words>  

“I don’t know why I keep checking on him,” she sighed. “He’s stuck in his own world, talking through that puppet like it’s real.” <words>267</words>  

Jasper’s grip tightened on the coffee sleeve. <words>278</words>  

Another voice, softer, replied, “Maybe that’s just how he copes. Maybe Felix is his way of redefining family.” <words>303</words>  

Jasper exhaled, his chest tight, but Felix spoke for him. <words>318</words>  

“Family isn’t just blood, you know,” Felix murmured, though no one was there to hear. <words>338</words>  

Outside, the sky churned, the clouds shifting in ways only Jasper understood. <words>355</words>  

He stepped onto the sand, the parallel universe beach stretching endlessly, its waves whispering secrets only he could archive. <words>379</words>  

Felix dangled from his hand, his wooden face tilted toward the sky. <words>394</words>  

“You think they’ll ever get it?” Felix asked. <words>407</words>  

Jasper smiled, his silence filled with something close to hope. <words>421</words>  

The storm rolled in, and for the first time in years, he didn’t feel alone. <words>439</words>
