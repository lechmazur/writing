The overgrown city street stretched before him, vines curling around rusted lampposts, shattered glass glinting like fallen stars. <words>17</words>  

Elias stepped carefully, his fingers tightening around the antique perfume bottle in his coat pocket. <words>29</words>  

It had belonged to his mother, its scent a ghost of jasmine and regret. <words>40</words>  

He had never dared open it, fearing the memories it might unleash. <words>51</words>  

Tonight, however, was different—tonight, he would write. <words>59</words>  

The cosmic verse burned inside him, demanding to be inked upon mortal skin. <words>71</words>  

He had spent years repressing his poetry, fearing its power, its truth. <words>83</words>  

But the silence of the city, reclaimed by nature, whispered encouragement. <words>94</words>  

A spontaneous decision to explore a side road led him deeper into the ruins. <words>106</words>  

The buildings loomed, their skeletal remains swallowed by ivy and time. <words>116</words>  

He felt the weight of lingering doubts pressing against his ribs. <words>127</words>  

What if his words were meaningless? <words>132</words>  

What if they were too much? <words>137</words>  

A pin dropped in the silent corridor ahead, and his breath caught. <words>148</words>  

Someone was there. <words>151</words>  

His pulse hammered as he reached for the perfume bottle. <words>161</words>  

The scent might mask his fear, or perhaps summon something older. <words>173</words>  

A shadow moved, and before he could think, he was ambushed. <words>184</words>  

Hands grasped his coat, shoving him against the crumbling brick. <words>194</words>  

A voice, low and knowing, murmured, “You shouldn’t be here.” <words>204</words>  

Elias swallowed, his terror carefully hidden beneath a poet’s calm. <words>215</words>  

“I came to write,” he said, his voice steady despite the tremor inside. <words>228</words>  

The figure hesitated, then released him. <words>234</words>  

Moonlight revealed a woman, her eyes sharp with recognition. <words>244</words>  

“You’re the one who writes on skin,” she said. <words>252</words>  

Elias nodded, his fingers brushing the bottle’s cool glass. <words>262</words>  

She extended her arm, bare and waiting. <words>269</words>  

“Then write,” she whispered. <words>273</words>  

His doubts clawed at him, but he uncapped the bottle. <words>283</words>  

The scent of jasmine and regret filled the air, thick as memory. <words>295</words>  

With trembling hands, he dipped his fingers into the liquid. <words>305</words>  

He traced words onto her skin, each letter a fragment of the cosmos. <words>317</words>  

She shivered, not from cold, but from understanding. <words>326</words>  

The city held its breath, vines curling closer, listening. <words>336</words>  

Elias stepped back, the verse complete, his fear laid bare. <words>347</words>  

The woman studied his work, then smiled. <words>354</words>  

“For the first time,” she said, “you are seen.” <words>363</words>  

Elias exhaled, the weight of doubt lifting. <words>372</words>  

The city, the silence, the scent—they had all led him here. <words>384</words>  

And for the first time, he believed in his own words. <words>394</words>
