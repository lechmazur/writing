The hush after the car backfired settled over the silent street, a momentary void where time itself seemed to pause. <words>19</words>  

In that fragile stillness, Darius, a weary undertaker, traced the celestial etchings on the astronomical clock before him. <words>36</words>  

The device, an artifact of forgotten craftsmanship, had been salvaged from the ruins of an ancient Persian palace reimagined in modern decay. <words>55</words>  

Its intricate gears whispered secrets of the cosmos, but Darius sought something more earthly—tribal knowledge passed through generations. <words>74</words>  

He had spent years deciphering the wisdom of his ancestors, though much of it was rarely practical in the world he now inhabited. <words>95</words>  

Yet, in the absolute dark of his existence, he clung to hope, believing the old ways still held power. <words>113</words>  

The clock’s hands moved not by mere mechanics but by following sun paths, aligning with celestial rhythms long abandoned by modern minds. <words>134</words>  

Darius had learned to imprison time itself within its gilded frame, capturing fleeting moments before they dissolved into oblivion. <words>153</words>  

His work as an undertaker had taught him the fragility of existence, the way life unraveled without warning. <words>170</words>  

Each body he prepared was a testament to time’s merciless advance, yet he refused to surrender to its inevitability. <words>189</words>  

The palace, once a beacon of grandeur, now stood as a mausoleum of forgotten dreams, its corridors echoing with ghosts of lost dynasties. <words>211</words>  

Darius moved through its halls with placid ferocity, his purpose unwavering despite the weight of his burdens. <words>228</words>  

He had been entrusted with a task—one that required both patience and precision. <words>242</words>  

The astronomical clock was more than an artifact; it was a key to understanding the cycles that governed all things. <words>261</words>  

By aligning its mechanisms with the sun’s passage, he could determine the precise moment to act. <words>278</words>  

The knowledge had been passed down through whispers, a secret guarded by those who understood its significance. <words>296</words>  

Tonight, as the city held its breath in the wake of the sudden noise, he knew the time had come. <words>315</words>  

He placed his hands upon the clock’s surface, feeling the vibrations of its ancient wisdom. <words>332</words>  

The gears turned, marking the convergence of past and present, guiding him toward his final duty. <words>350</words>  

In the depths of the palace, beneath the weight of history, he would imprison the last remnants of a dying era. <words>370</words>  

Not in chains, but in memory, in the careful preservation of what once was. <words>386</words>  

For as long as the clock turned, as long as the sun traced its path across the sky, hope would endure. <words>406</words>  

Darius exhaled, the hush stretching on, and with steady hands, he set the mechanism in motion. <words>423</words>  

The past would not be forgotten. <words>428</words>  

Not while he remained its keeper. <words>433</words>
