Cassius crouched in the shadow of a crumbling archway, his fingers tracing the tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle. <words>17</words> The ancient Roman marketplace reimagined around him bustled with merchants hawking wares, their voices rising over the scent of spiced wine and fresh bread. <words>38</words> He had spent years navigating this world, a hacker of lost histories, unearthing names erased by time. <words>54</words> Today, he sought one in particular—the name of a man condemned as a monster. <words>67</words>  

The bottle caps in his satchel clinked softly as he shifted, each one a relic of past victories. <words>86</words> He had adopted the habit of collecting them, a rarely common practice in a world obsessed with gold and marble. <words>107</words> They reminded him that even the discarded held value, much like the name he pursued. <words>123</words>  

A tea vendor poured steaming liquid into a clay cup, the leaves unfurling as Cassius watched. <words>138</words> He had only until the tea finished steeping to act. <words>149</words> The inscriptions on the rake handle led him here, whispering of a hidden ledger beneath the mosaic tiles. <words>168</words>  

He moved swiftly, prying up a loose tile with practiced ease. <words>179</words> Beneath it, a scroll lay wrapped in oilcloth, untouched by time. <words>192</words> His pulse quickened as he unrolled it, scanning the faded ink. <words>204</words>  

There it was—the name of a man history had erased. <words>215</words> A man condemned as a monster, yet whose crimes had been fabricated by those in power. <words>232</words> Cassius had seen it before: the vilification of those who threatened the status quo. <words>249</words>  

He traced the letters with reverence, committing them to memory. <words>261</words> The tea vendor glanced his way, the steam curling like ghosts between them. <words>276</words> Cassius knew he had little time before the wrong eyes noticed his discovery. <words>292</words>  

Slipping the scroll into his satchel, he stood and melted into the crowd. <words>305</words> The bottle caps jingled softly, a reminder that even the smallest things could hold great weight. <words>324</words>  

As he walked, he whispered the name under his breath, ensuring it would never be forgotten again. <words>341</words> The marketplace hummed around him, oblivious to the history he had just resurrected. <words>358</words>  

Cassius did not seek wealth or fame—only truth. <words>369</words> And in a world where monsters were often men in disguise, he had learned that redemption lay in remembrance. <words>390</words>  

The tea had finished steeping. <words>395</words> But the name would steep in history once more. <words>407</words>
