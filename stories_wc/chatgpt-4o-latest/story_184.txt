Joss, a scrappy tavern-hand with a knack for trouble, knelt in the vacuum chamber garden, sifting through the brittle soil. <words>17</words>  

The airlock hissed behind him, though no air remained to hiss. <words>26</words>  

He ignored it, focused instead on the fossilized footprints embedded in the dried-up riverbed beneath his knees. <words>38</words>  

Each indentation told a story, but Joss wasn’t here for history—he was here to randomize fate. <words>50</words>  

He pulled a small pouch from his belt, its contents rattling like shattered dreams. <words>61</words>  

Inside lay his collection of seashells, broken and jagged, remnants of an ocean that had never touched this place. <words>76</words>  

He scattered them across the footprints, watching as they landed in chaotic patterns. <words>87</words>  

The arrangement was never the same twice, yet always eerily familiar. <words>97</words>  

Joss smirked, his predictably unpredictable nature making him the perfect conduit for what came next. <words>111</words>  

The sands of time here flowed backward, an anomaly he had long since stopped questioning. <words>123</words>  

Instead, he embraced it, using the reversal to catapult imagination beyond known realms. <words>135</words>  

He traced a finger along the largest footprint, feeling the ancient pulse beneath. <words>146</words>  

The shells began to shift, aligning themselves into symbols he almost recognized. <words>157</words>  

A flippant solemnity settled over him—he had done this before, would do it again. <words>170</words>  

The call was inescapable, woven into his bones like the dust of forgotten stars. <words>182</words>  

He exhaled, though breath was meaningless here, and pressed his palm to the ground. <words>194</words>  

The vacuum chamber garden trembled, its sterile beauty warping as reality bent. <words>205</words>  

Through the footprints, through the shells, through the backward-flowing sands, something stirred. <words>217</words>  

Joss grinned, knowing he had once again set the wheel spinning. <words>228</words>  

He never knew what would emerge, only that it must. <words>238</words>  

The garden darkened, shadows pooling where none should exist. <words>249</words>  

A whisper curled through the void, ancient and inevitable. <words>259</words>  

Joss stood, brushing dust from his knees, and turned toward the airlock. <words>271</words>  

He had work to do, and the universe was waiting. <words>281</words>
