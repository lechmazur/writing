Jude had never been one for sentimentality, but as he sifted through the cluttered garage, he found himself hesitating over a small wooden box. <words>22</words>  

Inside, nestled in a bed of dust and forgotten memories, lay his collection of smooth stones, each one a relic of a childhood spent alone. <words>44</words>  

He ran his fingers over them, their surfaces cool and familiar, a quiet comfort in a world that had never quite made space for him. <words>67</words>  

The garage groaned as the gravitational anomaly outside pulsed, shifting the weight of objects unpredictably, making even the simplest task an exercise in adaptation. <words>91</words>  

Jude had learned to move with it, loosening his grip on control, letting the shifting forces guide his steps rather than resisting them. <words>113</words>  

A softly audible rustling drew his attention to a crumpled lottery ticket wedged between two rusted toolboxes. <words>132</words>  

Unfolding it, he found a cryptic message scrawled across the faded numbers: "Fear is a stone—hold it too tightly, and it sinks you." <words>157</words>  

He exhaled sharply, the words striking something deep within him, something he had spent years trying to ignore. <words>178</words>  

Fear had been his constant companion, whispering that he was alone, that he would always be alone. <words>197</words>  

But courage—courage was something he had never quite grasped, something he had always assumed belonged to others. <words>219</words>  

The anomaly pulsed again, and a wrench tumbled from a shelf, narrowly missing his foot. <words>237</words>  

Jude didn’t flinch; he had grown used to the chaos, to the way the world around him refused to stay still. <words>260</words>  

He picked up one of the stones, rolling it between his fingers, feeling its weight, its smoothness, its quiet certainty. <words>283</words>  

Maybe fear was a stone, but stones could be thrown, could be skipped across water, could be let go. <words>305</words>  

He loosened his grip and let the stone drop, watching as it landed soundlessly among the others. <words>324</words>  

The message on the ticket lingered in his mind, a challenge, a promise, a truth he had always known but never accepted. <words>348</words>  

He had spent his life holding onto fear, letting it define him, letting it keep him from stepping beyond the boundaries of his solitude. <words>374</words>  

But the world was shifting, and he had a choice—adapt or perish. <words>389</words>  

With a final glance at the stones, he stood, brushing the dust from his hands, and stepped out into the anomaly’s pull. <words>412</words>  

The garage trembled behind him, but he didn’t look back. <words>426</words>  

For the first time, he wasn’t afraid of what came next. <words>439</words>
