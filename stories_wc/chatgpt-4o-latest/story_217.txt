The first ring of the phone echoed through the abandoned amusement park, slicing through the thick, stagnant air. <words>19</words>  

Jules hesitated before answering, her fingers tightening around the pocket knife she always carried. <words>32</words>  

The voice on the other end was familiar, yet distant, like a melody half-remembered from childhood. <words>46</words>  

"Meet me at the haunted house," the caller said, and the line went dead. <words>57</words>  

Jules exhaled, her breath visible in the cold night, and stepped forward. <words>68</words>  

The haunted house loomed ahead, its peeling paint and broken windows whispering of forgotten screams. <words>81</words>  

She had spent years being overlooked, dismissed as insignificant, but tonight, she would prove them wrong. <words>95</words>  

Inside, the air smelled of dust and something older, something waiting. <words>106</words>  

A flickering lightbulb cast long shadows as she moved through the narrow corridors. <words>119</words>  

Then, a rustle—too deliberate to be the wind. <words>127</words>  

Jules tightened her grip on the knife, flipping open one of its many blades. <words>140</words>  

"You're late," a voice murmured from the darkness. <words>148</words>  

She turned, heart pounding, to see Theo leaning against a rotting wooden pillar. <words>161</words>  

His smile was sadly joyful, as if he had already accepted the inevitable. <words>174</words>  

"You always did love theatrics," Jules said, stepping closer. <words>184</words>  

"And you always adapted," Theo replied, his eyes scanning her face. <words>196</words>  

She had once trusted him, but trust had a way of eroding like old paint. <words>210</words>  

"Why call me here?" she asked, her voice steady. <words>220</words>  

"Because you’re the only one who still believes in wonder," he said. <words>232</words>  

Jules scoffed, but something in his tone made her pause. <words>243</words>  

Theo reached into his coat and pulled out a small, wrapped package. <words>256</words>  

She hesitated before taking it, unwrapping it carefully. <words>266</words>  

Inside was a single, perfectly made dumpling. <words>275</words>  

Her breath caught—only one person had ever made dumplings like this. <words>288</words>  

"Grandmother’s recipe," Theo confirmed, watching her reaction. <words>298</words>  

Memories flooded back—late nights in the kitchen, laughter, flour-dusted hands. <words>311</words>  

"You think food can fix this?" she asked, voice softer now. <words>323</words>  

"I think it can remind us why we fight," Theo said. <words>334</words>  

Jules exhaled, the weight of the past pressing against her ribs. <words>346</words>  

She took a bite, the taste igniting something long dormant inside her. <words>358</words>  

The haunted house groaned as if sensing the shift. <words>368</words>  

Theo stepped closer, his presence intensifying the moment. <words>379</words>  

"We can change things, Jules," he whispered. <words>388</words>  

She looked at him, at the shadows, at the knife in her hand. <words>401</words>  

Then, she closed the blade and nodded. <words>409</words>  

The world outside was still dark, but for the first time in years, she felt light. <words>423</words>
