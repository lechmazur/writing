The dinosaur skeleton museum was silent when the orchard dog finally stopped barking at night. <words>16</words>  

Haru, a gentle swordsman, stepped between the towering fossils, his boots whispering against the marble floor. <words>30</words>  

In his pocket, an empty matchbox rattled softly, a reminder of something lost or yet to be found. <words>44</words>  

He had come here not for relics but for answers, seeking them in the coded angles of a half-painted sundial. <words>59</words>  

The sundial stood in the museum’s courtyard, its incomplete markings a puzzle left by someone he once trusted. <words>73</words>  

Faithfully unfaithful—that was how she had described herself before vanishing into the world’s hidden corners. <words>86</words>  

She had loved him, or so she claimed, but her love was a restless thing, never staying in one place. <words>101</words>  

Haru had spent years chasing her shadow, deciphering the cryptic messages she left behind. <words>113</words>  

This sundial was her latest clue, and he traced its edges with calloused fingers, feeling the weight of time. <words>128</words>  

The museum’s air smelled of dust and ancient bones, a fitting place for a man who felt like a relic himself. <words>143</words>  

He had always been a late bloomer, slow to understand the world’s shifting tides. <words>155</words>  

Even now, he struggled to grasp why he still followed her trail, why he still longed to cradle the universe in a cupped hand. <words>173</words>  

A rustling sound broke his thoughts, and he turned to see a woman stepping from the shadows. <words>187</words>  

She was draped in a coat too thin for the night, her eyes sharp with recognition. <words>200</words>  

“You found it,” she said, nodding toward the sundial. <words>207</words>  

Haru exhaled, his grip tightening around the matchbox. <words>215</words>  

“I always do,” he replied, his voice carrying the brusque affection of a man who had chased ghosts too long. <words>230</words>  

She smiled, but it was the kind of smile that carried both welcome and farewell. <words>242</words>  

“You never understood,” she murmured, stepping closer. <words>250</words>  

“Then explain it to me,” he said, though he already knew she wouldn’t. <words>261</words>  

Instead, she reached into his pocket, plucking the matchbox from his grasp. <words>272</words>  

She opened it, revealing a folded slip of paper hidden inside. <words>282</words>  

Haru hadn’t known it was there. <words>287</words>  

She unfolded it, reading the words he couldn’t see. <words>296</words>  

Then, with a sigh, she tucked it into her coat. <words>305</words>  

“You always loved the chase more than the catch,” she said. <words>315</words>  

Haru shook his head. <words>319</words>  

“No,” he said. “I loved you.” <words>326</words>  

She hesitated, then kissed his forehead, a fleeting touch like a whisper of wind. <words>339</words>  

“You were always a xenophile,” she said. “Loving things that don’t belong to you.” <words>352</words>  

Then she turned and walked away, her silhouette vanishing between the towering skeletons. <words>364</words>  

Haru stood there, staring at the sundial, the angles now meaningless without her. <words>376</words>  

The matchbox felt lighter in his hand, emptier than before. <words>386</words>  

He had chased her across continents, through riddles and ruins, but perhaps some things were never meant to be held. <words>402</words>  

With a quiet sigh, he placed the matchbox on the sundial and walked into the night. <words>415</words>  

The orchard dog would bark again tomorrow, but tonight, the world was silent. <words>427</words>
