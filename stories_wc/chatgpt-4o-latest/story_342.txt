The sky pulsed with the last tremors of thunder, a hush settling over the twisted orchard labyrinth as the pilot wandered between gnarled trunks. <words>21</words>  

His flight jacket hung loose, his steps deliberately dreamy, as if he drifted rather than walked. <words>36</words>  

In his left hand, he clutched a worn-out glove, its seams frayed, its leather cracked with time. <words>50</words>  

He had found it in the cockpit before his last flight, though he had no memory of how it got there. <words>66</words>  

Now, in the lull before fresh rain, he sought something deeper—patterns hidden in the world’s design. <words>80</words>  

The orchard twisted unnaturally, branches curling like frozen waves, their bark etched with symbols he almost recognized. <words>94</words>  

He had come here to archive these patterns, to understand the language nature whispered in its quiet moments. <words>108</words>  

But the postcards had led him here first. <words>113</words>  

Scattered in the cockpit, their edges curled with age, they bore sinister doodles—spirals, jagged lines, and eyes that never blinked. <words>129</words>  

He had traced them back to this grove, where the trees seemed to breathe with forgotten voices. <words>143</words>  

Each postcard carried a borrowed memory, glimpses of lives he had never lived but somehow recalled. <words>157</words>  

A child’s laughter beneath a violet sky, a woman’s hand pressing a letter into his palm, a storm swallowing a distant shore. <words>175</words>  

The glove in his hand tingled, as if charged with the weight of those memories. <words>188</words>  

He flexed his fingers inside it, feeling the imprint of another’s grasp, another’s choices. <words>201</words>  

Had he been careless, or had he simply been lost in someone else’s past? <words>214</words>  

The orchard whispered no answers, only the rustling of leaves shifting in unseen currents. <words>227</words>  

He pressed forward, deeper into the labyrinth, where the trees grew tighter, their branches forming tunnels of shadow. <words>242</words>  

The postcards had promised something here—an emancipation from the weight of borrowed lives. <words>255</words>  

He knelt at the base of the oldest oak, its roots coiled like petrified serpents. <words>268</words>  

Beneath the moss, he found another postcard, its ink still wet, its message addressed to him. <words>282</words>  

"Let go," it read, the words scrawled in his own handwriting. <words>292</words>  

The glove burned against his skin, the memories pressing harder, demanding release. <words>305</words>  

With a breath of resigned exuberance, he peeled it off, letting it fall among the roots. <words>319</words>  

The orchard sighed, the branches loosening, the air clearing as if a storm had passed. <words>332</words>  

The postcards in his pocket crumbled to dust, their borrowed memories returning to the earth. <words>346</words>  

He stood, lighter, his own thoughts finally his own. <words>355</words>  

The rain began, washing away the last echoes of thunder, leaving only the quiet rhythm of falling drops. <words>370</words>  

He turned back toward the world beyond the grove, no longer a pilot lost in another’s past. <words>384</words>  

The orchard let him go. <words>388</words>
