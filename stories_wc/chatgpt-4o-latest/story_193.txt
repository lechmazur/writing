The wind howled as Prince Aldric turned the key, locking away the past he could never reclaim. <words>19</words>  
Snowflakes swirled through the broken windows of the abandoned customs office, settling on forgotten ledgers and dust-laden crates. <words>38</words>  
He had once been heir to a kingdom, but unseen forces had conspired to cast him into exile. <words>54</words>  
Now, he sought something greater than a throne—he sought the cure for loneliness. <words>66</words>  
His fingers traced the worn surface of an antique mortar and pestle, an artifact he had carried since childhood. <words>85</words>  
Legends whispered that it had been used by healers who could mend not just bodies, but souls. <words>103</words>  
Aldric had never believed in such myths, but desperation had a way of reshaping convictions. <words>118</words>  
As he ground dried herbs, the rhythmic motion steadied his thoughts, offering a fragile sense of purpose. <words>136</words>  
The storm outside thickened, wind rattling the shutters like a restless spirit demanding entry. <words>151</words>  
Then, through the swirling white, a shadow emerged—a traveler, hunched against the cold. <words>167</words>  
Aldric hesitated before opening the door, his exile having taught him caution. <words>181</words>  
The figure stumbled inside, shaking off the snow to reveal a woman with piercing, knowing eyes. <words>198</words>  
She studied him as if recognizing something unspoken, something lost. <words>211</words>  
“You carry an object of great significance,” she murmured, nodding toward the mortar and pestle. <words>229</words>  
Aldric stiffened. “It’s just an heirloom.” <words>237</words>  
She smiled, the kind of smile that saw through lies. <words>248</words>  
“Unintentionally iconic,” she mused. “Like you.” <words>259</words>  
He scoffed, but her words unsettled him. <words>270</words>  
She moved closer, brushing frost from her cloak. <words>281</words>  
“I am called Elira,” she said. “And I know why you seek.” <words>296</words>  
Aldric’s grip tightened on the pestle. “Then tell me.” <words>308</words>  
She knelt beside him, pulling a small vial from her satchel. <words>322</words>  
“The cure for loneliness is not found in solitude,” she said. <words>336</words>  
He frowned. “Then where?” <words>343</words>  
She poured a few drops into the mortar. <words>353</words>  
“By improving the lives of others, you mend your own.” <words>367</words>  
Aldric hesitated, then resumed grinding, the scent of crushed herbs filling the air. <words>383</words>  
For the first time in years, he was not alone. <words>395</words>  
Outside, the storm began to ease, as if the unseen forces had finally relented. <words>412</words>  
And within the abandoned customs office, something long locked away began to open. <words>428</words>
