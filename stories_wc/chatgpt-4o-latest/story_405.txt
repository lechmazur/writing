Jonah never trusted luck, but he trusted patterns. <words>10</words> He spent his nights in the underground mushroom farm, testing recipes. <words>19</words> The air was thick with damp earth and the scent of spores. <words>28</words> He wasn’t a chef, but he knew how to gamble with flavors. <words>38</words>  

Tonight, he stirred a broth infused with dried petals from his collection. <words>48</words> Each petal held a memory, pressed between pages of a book he never read. <words>59</words> He told himself they were just ingredients, but he knew better. <words>69</words>  

A frantic knock echoed through the tunnels. <words>74</words> Jonah sighed, setting his ladle down. <words>80</words> Another lost traveler, another desperate soul seeking direction. <words>88</words>  

He found the man trembling near the entrance, eyes darting. <words>96</words> “You’re looking for a way out,” Jonah said, voice steady. <words>106</words>  

The man nodded, clutching a notebook filled with cryptic scrawls. <words>115</words> Jonah recognized the markings—subway seat etchings, a language of the lost. <words>126</words>  

“You followed these?” Jonah asked, flipping through the pages. <words>134</words> The man swallowed hard. <words>137</words> “They led me here.” <words>140</words>  

Jonah exhaled, rubbing his temple. <words>145</words> He had spent years interpreting those scrawls, guiding wanderers to safety. <words>156</words> But this man—his desperation was different. <words>162</words>  

“What are you running from?” Jonah asked. <words>168</words>  

The man hesitated. <words>171</words> “Grief,” he admitted. <words>174</words>  

Jonah understood. <words>176</words> Grief was uncharted territory, a place without maps. <words>184</words>  

He reached for his collection of dried petals, selecting one carefully. <words>194</words> “This belonged to someone I lost,” he said, truthfully lying. <words>204</words>  

The man frowned. <words>207</words> “Truthfully lying?” <words>210</words>  

Jonah smirked. <words>213</words> “I tell the truth, but not all of it.” <words>221</words>  

The man exhaled shakily. <words>225</words> “I don’t know where to go.” <words>231</words>  

Jonah studied the scrawls again. <words>236</words> “These markings—some lead to dead ends.” <words>243</words>  

The man’s face paled. <words>247</words>  

Jonah tapped a symbol. <words>251</words> “This one means impound.” <words>256</words>  

“Impound?” the man echoed. <words>260</words>  

Jonah nodded. <words>263</words> “A place where things are taken, never returned.” <words>271</words>  

The man shuddered. <words>274</words>  

Jonah set the petal into the broth, stirring slowly. <words>282</words> “You can’t outrun grief,” he murmured. <words>289</words>  

The man watched the broth swirl. <words>294</words>  

Jonah ladled some into a bowl, handing it over. <words>303</words> “Drink,” he said. <words>306</words>  

The man hesitated, then sipped. <words>311</words>  

Jonah watched as his shoulders relaxed. <words>317</words>  

“Where do I go now?” the man asked. <words>324</words>  

Jonah pointed to a tunnel. <words>328</words> “That way leads to the surface.” <words>334</words>  

The man stood, gripping his notebook. <words>340</words> “Thank you.” <words>342</words>  

Jonah nodded, watching him disappear into the dark. <words>350</words>  

He turned back to his broth, stirring absently. <words>357</words>  

The petals dissolved, their memories steeping into the liquid. <words>365</words>  

He had guided another traveler, but his own path remained unclear. <words>375</words>  

Frantic peace settled over him as he tasted the broth. <words>384</words>  

It was bitter, but honest. <words>388</words>  

Just like grief. <words>391</words>
