The chipped bowl sat on the altar, its cracks filled with wax, a relic of past rituals. <words>14</words>  

Jonas traced its rim, his fingers trembling as he stood in the witch’s incantation chamber. <words>28</words>  

He had spent years unearthing bloodlines for desperate clients, selling secrets that should have stayed buried. <words>42</words>  

Now, guilt clung to him like damp cloth, suffocating, relentless. <words>50</words>  

He had come here seeking something intangible—a path to self-forgiveness. <words>61</words>  

The witch, draped in robes that shimmered like oil on water, watched him with knowing eyes. <words>76</words>  

“You analyze the subtext in funeral eulogies,” she said, her voice smooth as river stones. <words>91</words>  

Jonas flinched; he had never spoken of that to anyone. <words>101</words>  

It was how he verified lineage, how he uncovered the truths people tried to bury. <words>115</words>  

“Names omitted, grief exaggerated, love overstated,” he murmured. <words>122</words>  

She nodded. “And yet, you never read your own past.” <words>132</words>  

Jonas swallowed hard. <words>135</words>  

His own lineage was a wound he refused to probe. <words>144</words>  

The witch gestured to the chipped bowl. <words>149</words>  

“Drink,” she commanded. <words>152</words>  

He hesitated, then lifted it to his lips. <words>160</words>  

The liquid burned, and suddenly, the chamber blurred. <words>169</words>  

He was outside, amid morning walks he had taken as a child. <words>180</words>  

His mother’s voice echoed, recounting a history he had ignored. <words>191</words>  

Atypically typical, she had called their family—ordinary on the surface, but riddled with secrets. <words>206</words>  

He saw his grandfather’s funeral, the eulogy filled with omissions. <words>217</words>  

A name left unspoken. <words>221</words>  

His own father’s. <words>224</words>  

Jonas gasped, the vision shattering. <words>229</words>  

He was back in the chamber, the witch watching. <words>238</words>  

“You’ve spent years exposing others,” she said. <words>246</words>  

“But your own truth was the one you feared.” <words>255</words>  

Jonas clenched his fists. <words>259</words>  

He had built his career on revealing hidden pasts, yet his own had remained a mystery. <words>273</words>  

Now, he stood on the brink of renewal. <words>281</words>  

The witch smiled. <words>284</words>  

“You can’t change the past, but you can choose what comes next.” <words>295</words>  

Jonas exhaled, the weight on his chest loosening. <words>305</words>  

For the first time, he felt ready to zoom forward. <words>315</words>  

Not to escape, but to rebuild. <words>320</words>  

He placed the chipped bowl back on the altar, its cracks no longer a flaw, but a testament. <words>336</words>  

A reminder that even broken things could hold meaning. <words>346</words>  

He turned to leave, the morning light spilling through the chamber’s narrow window. <words>359</words>  

The world outside awaited, and for once, he was ready to meet it. <words>371</words>
