Dr. Liora Vex adjusted the servo-motors in her wrist as she crouched beside the dying eel-hound, its bioluminescent scales flickering weakly. <words>19</words> The kaleidoscopic coral around her pulsed in rhythmic waves, shifting hues with each breath of the tide. <words>33</words> She had seen creatures like this before, but never one so mangled—its wounds distorted as if reality itself had twisted. <words>50</words>  

She reached into her satchel and pulled out a blacksmith’s bucket, its iron sides dented from years of use. <words>66</words> It wasn’t meant for medicine, but she had learned that the right tool was often the one at hand. <words>83</words> With a flick of her cybernetic fingers, she activated the bucket’s internal sterilization field. <words>97</words>  

The eel-hound whimpered, its gills fluttering in the quiet that followed a distant train whistle’s echo. <words>111</words> That sound always unsettled her—an omen of something just beyond perception. <words>123</words> She had spent years rummaging in abandoned motels, searching for lost knowledge, forgotten cures, and the whispers of things best left undisturbed. <words>143</words>  

Tonight, she sought something more. <words>147</words> A sacred taboo, a legend whispered among the cybernetic outcasts who had abandoned the sterile cities. <words>161</words> They spoke of a substance hidden in the coral, something that could rewrite the body, reshape the mind. <words>176</words>  

She had to devour it. <words>180</words>  

The eel-hound’s eyes flickered open, reflecting the shifting coral like shattered glass. <words>192</words> It knew. <words>194</words> It had seen what she was after, had perhaps tasted it itself. <words>207</words>  

Liora dipped her fingers into the blacksmith’s bucket, scooping out a viscous, shimmering fluid she had collected from the ruins of a forgotten motel. <words>226</words> The substance distorted in her palm, shifting between liquid and solid, between known and unknown. <words>240</words>  

She pressed it to the eel-hound’s wounds, watching as the flesh knitted together in ways that defied anatomy. <words>255</words> The creature shuddered, then stilled, its breathing deep and steady. <words>267</words>  

Liora exhaled, the raucous silence pressing in around her. <words>277</words> The coral pulsed faster now, as if sensing what she had done. <words>289</words>  

She lifted the bucket to her lips. <words>295</words>  

The moment the substance touched her tongue, the world fractured. <words>306</words> The coral twisted into impossible shapes, the eel-hound’s form stretched and multiplied, and the train whistle’s echo returned, looping endlessly. <words>325</words>  

Her cybernetic limbs spasmed, recalibrating against the shifting reality. <words>336</words> She saw herself reflected in the coral—dozens of versions, each making a different choice. <words>350</words>  

She had challenged perception itself. <words>355</words>  

And perception had answered. <words>359</words>
