The brig of the space pirate ship rattled as the engines groaned, a sound like a dying beast exhaling its last breath. <words>19</words>  

Dr. Elias Vance, psychic genealogist, sat cross-legged on the cold metal floor, rolling a pair of dice in his palm. <words>38</words>  

One was chipped, a flaw that made its rolls unpredictable, much like the tangled bloodlines he traced through time. <words>55</words>  

He had been captured while following a trail of diaries left on abandoned bullet trains drifting through the void. <words>74</words>  

Each diary contained fragments of a lineage, whispers of ancestors who had shaped the present in unseen ways. <words>93</words>  

Now, locked away, he sought to lengthen the thread of his own fate, to weave himself into the puzzle of destiny. <words>114</words>  

The ship lurched, and the dice tumbled from his fingers, clattering against the grated floor. <words>129</words>  

He watched them settle: a three and a five. <words>137</words>  

Eight. <words>138</words>  

A number of infinity turned upon itself, a loop of past and future entwined. <words>152</words>  

Elias smirked, a proudly humble man who knew that fate was both a game and a riddle. <words>169</words>  

The brig door hissed open, and Captain Liora stepped inside, her cybernetic eye gleaming in the dim light. <words>188</words>  

"You've been reading too much into ghosts, Vance," she said, arms crossed. <words>201</words>  

"Ghosts are just echoes waiting to be heard," he replied, picking up the dice. <words>216</words>  

She sighed, leaning against the wall. <words>223</words>  

"You know why you're here?" <words>227</words>  

Elias nodded. <words>229</words>  

"You think I stole something." <words>234</words>  

"You did," she said. <words>238</words>  

"A name." <words>240</words>  

He chuckled, grave playfulness in his voice. <words>247</words>  

"A name is not a thing to steal, Captain." <words>255</words>  

"It's a thing to uncover." <words>260</words>  

She tossed a worn diary onto the floor between them. <words>270</words>  

"Then tell me what this means." <words>277</words>  

Elias picked it up, flipping through brittle pages filled with hurried script. <words>289</words>  

The words spoke of heartbreak, of alarm bells ringing in the soul, of a love lost to the stars. <words>308</words>  

He traced the ink with his fingers, feeling the weight of generations pressing upon him. <words>323</words>  

"This is your ancestor," he murmured. <words>330</words>  

Liora stiffened. <words>332</words>  

"How do you know?" <words>336</words>  

"Because the last star fades into morning light, just as it did in their final entry." <words>351</words>  

She exhaled sharply, the brig suddenly too small for the ghosts between them. <words>365</words>  

Elias rolled the dice again. <words>370</words>  

A six and a two. <words>376</words>  

Eight. <words>377</words>  

Destiny, once more, looping back upon itself. <words>385</words>  

"You wanted to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak," he said softly. <words>398</words>  

"But some echoes refuse to be silenced." <words>406</words>  

Liora turned away, her voice barely above a whisper. <words>415</words>  

"Then tell me how to listen." <words>422</words>  

Elias smiled, setting the diary aside. <words>431</words>  

"Letâ€™s start with a roll of the dice." <words>439</words>
