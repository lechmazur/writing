The dejected knight drifted through the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor weightless yet still burdening his soul. <words>14</words>  

The air shimmered with spectral lights, casting elongated shadows that twisted unnaturally across the mirrored walls. <words>27</words>  

He clutched the broken trident prong, a relic from a sunken realm, its jagged edge humming with forgotten power. <words>40</words>  

The knight had once sworn an oath beneath a different sky, but time had unraveled his purpose like frayed silk. <words>53</words>  

Now, as the old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour, the hall trembled, and the silence between beats deepened. <words>66</words>  

He felt the vow stir within him, an echo from ages past, demanding to be voiced before it was lost. <words>79</words>  

The knight had always been normally abnormal—too bound by honor for the lawless, too wild for the righteous. <words>92</words>  

Yet here, in this sacred disorder, he found a place where contradictions could breathe, where lost things could be found. <words>105</words>  

The trident prong pulsed in his grip, urging him forward, quickening his steps through the weightless expanse. <words>117</words>  

He moved through forgotten paths, corridors unseen by those who danced, where echoes of past revelers whispered in the dark. <words>130</words>  

Each step deepened the horizon before him, revealing layers of time folded into the architecture of the hall itself. <words>143</words>  

Memories not his own flickered in the mirrored walls—knights before him, bearing the same burden, seeking the same release. <words>156</words>  

The vow had been spoken before, but never completed, its words swallowed by the shifting tides of history. <words>169</words>  

He reached the heart of the hall, where gravity flickered uncertainly, and the air hummed with unseen forces. <words>182</words>  

The trident prong grew heavier, anchoring him as the world around him threatened to dissolve into weightless oblivion. <words>195</words>  

He raised it high, feeling the presence of those who had come before, their silent voices pressing against his mind. <words>208</words>  

The vow surged through him, a sacred utterance that had waited centuries to be spoken in full. <words>220</words>  

His voice, long unused, cracked as he spoke the words, each syllable unraveling the disorder that had bound him. <words>233</words>  

The dance hall shuddered, its mirrored walls fracturing, revealing glimpses of the sunken realm from which the trident had come. <words>246</words>  

Water rushed in, yet did not drown him; instead, it carried him forward, deeper into the forgotten paths of time. <words>259</words>  

The vow completed, the weight lifted, and the knight felt, for the first time in ages, truly unburdened. <words>272</words>  

As the last echoes of his words faded, the zero-gravity dance hall dissolved, leaving only the deepening horizon before him. <words>285</words>  

He stepped forward, no longer dejected, no longer lost, but part of something greater than himself. <words>296</words>  

The watchtower clock struck once more, and the world shifted, welcoming him into the next chapter of his journey. <words>309</words>
