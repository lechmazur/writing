The shooting star tracking station hummed with the low, persistent drone of an outdated overhead projector. <words>19</words>  
Between innings of a local baseball game, Dr. Elias Vance, an unruly alchemist with wild silver hair, adjusted his cracked magnifying glass. <words>41</words>  
The lens distorted the celestial charts before him, but he claimed it revealed truths unseen by ordinary eyes. <words>55</words>  
His hauntingly cheerful demeanor unsettled his colleagues, who whispered that he had once touched the sky itself. <words>72</words>  
Tonight, he intended to impress them, to disarm their cynicism with playful wonder. <words>84</words>  
He tapped the projector, its flickering light casting shifting constellations onto the station’s curved ceiling. <words>99</words>  
"Watch closely," he said, his voice lilting with mischief. <words>110</words>  
A meteor shower was predicted, but Elias insisted something greater was coming. <words>124</words>  
His assistant, Mara, folded her arms, skeptical yet intrigued. <words>135</words>  
"You always promise miracles," she said, "but all I see are stars." <words>149</words>  
Elias grinned, lifting the magnifying glass to the projected sky map. <words>162</words>  
The cracked lens fractured the light, creating a shimmering illusion of movement. <words>176</words>  
"Not just stars," he murmured. "A door." <words>185</words>  
Mara frowned, but before she could respond, the station’s radio crackled. <words>198</words>  
"Unidentified celestial object approaching," the technician announced. <words>210</words>  
Elias clapped his hands, his excitement infectious. <words>220</words>  
"Right on time," he whispered. <words>227</words>  
The others gathered around as the projector’s hum deepened, resonating through the floor. <words>241</words>  
Outside, the sky split with a streak of silver fire. <words>252</words>  
The meteor wasn’t falling—it was slowing. <words>262</words>  
Mara’s breath caught. "That’s impossible." <words>271</words>  
Elias only chuckled, his eyes reflecting the descending light. <words>284</words>  
"Not impossible," he said. "Just forgotten." <words>294</words>  
The object hovered above the station, pulsing with an otherworldly glow. <words>307</words>  
Elias stepped forward, raising the magnifying glass. <words>318</words>  
The fractured lens refracted the light, revealing intricate patterns within the glow. <words>332</words>  
Symbols danced across the walls, ancient and unreadable. <words>343</words>  
Mara shivered. "What did you do?" <words>352</words>  
Elias turned, his grin widening. <words>360</words>  
"I reminded the sky that we are watching," he said. <words>372</words>  
The object pulsed once more, then ascended, vanishing into the void. <words>386</words>  
Silence followed, thick with awe. <words>394</words>  
The projector’s hum faded, leaving only the distant roar of the baseball crowd. <words>408</words>  
Mara exhaled, her skepticism shaken. <words>417</words>  
Elias patted her shoulder. "See? Wonder wins." <words>429</words>  
She glanced at the magnifying glass, its crack gleaming. <words>441</words>  
Perhaps, she thought, some fractures revealed more than they obscured. <words>455</words>  
Outside, another star fell, but now, she wasn’t sure it was just a star. <words>470</words>
