The observatory stood abandoned on the cliff’s edge, its great dome cracked like an old skull, staring blindly at the sky. <words>19</words>  

Inside, Marcus adjusted his flight suit, the fabric torn and useless in a world without drones or satellites. <words>34</words>  

He had once piloted machines across distant battlefields, but now he was stranded in a realm of swords and sorcery. <words>50</words>  

A bundle of dried herbs lay beside him, its scent sharp, meant for healing or poison—he hadn’t decided which. <words>66</words>  

The orchard below would soon be razed, its trees felled before the next moonrise, leaving the land barren. <words>80</words>  

He had learned this from a woman at a speed dating event in the village, a bizarre custom he barely understood. <words>98</words>  

She had spoken of mercy as if it were a horizon—something distant, shifting, never quite reachable. <words>112</words>  

Marcus had laughed, cynically hopeful, knowing that mercy was often just another word for hesitation. <words>126</words>  

Yet here he was, waiting in the hush before destruction, contemplating whether to act. <words>138</words>  

The villagers believed the orchard was cursed, its roots tangled with old magic, its fruit bitter with forgotten grief. <words>154</words>  

They would burn it, salt the earth, and move on, as people always did when faced with the unknown. <words>170</words>  

But Marcus had seen too much war to trust in destruction as a solution. <words>182</words>  

He had spent years disseminating orders from afar, pressing buttons that sent fire raining down on strangers. <words>198</words>  

Now, he had no machines, no commands—only his own hands and the weight of his choices. <words>214</words>  

The woman from the speed dating event had given him the herb bundle, pressing it into his palm with quiet insistence. <words>232</words>  

"Possibility lingers at the brink of despair," she had said, her eyes dark with something he couldn’t name. <words>248</words>  

He had scoffed then, but now, in the charred serenity of the observatory, her words gnawed at him. <words>264</words>  

The orchard was not cursed—it was merely misunderstood, its roots deep, its fruit waiting for the right hands. <words>280</words>  

Marcus stood, gripping the herbs, and descended the cliffside path toward the trees. <words>292</words>  

The villagers would come with torches soon, but perhaps he could show them another way. <words>306</words>  

Perhaps mercy was not a distant horizon but something one could reach, if only they dared. <words>320</words>  

He knelt at the first tree, pressing the herbs into the soil, whispering words he barely believed. <words>336</words>  

The wind stirred, carrying the scent of dried leaves and something older, something waiting. <words>350</words>  

Marcus exhaled, watching the orchard breathe with him, and for the first time in years, he felt like a pilot again. <words>368</words>  

Not of drones, not of war, but of possibility. <words>376</words>  

And that, he thought, was worth staying for. <words>386</words>
