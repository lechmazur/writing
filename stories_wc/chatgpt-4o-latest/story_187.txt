The stoic wanderer arrived at the witch’s familiar training ground just as the teacher wiped the final formula away. <words>19</words>  

The air still crackled with residual magic, the scent of burnt herbs clinging to the damp earth. <words>33</words>  

He had followed a trail of nightmares to this place, each vision leading him closer to the truth he sought. <words>48</words>  

In his hands, he carried a floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface etched with forgotten sigils. <words>62</words>  

The students, draped in dark robes, turned to him with expressions of wary curiosity. <words>74</words>  

He was mesmerizingly bland, his presence neither threatening nor inviting, yet impossible to ignore. <words>87</words>  

The teacher, an old woman with eyes like polished obsidian, studied him with measured patience. <words>100</words>  

"You impose upon sacred ground," she said, her voice edged with both warning and welcome. <words>113</words>  

"I seek to archive ritual practices," he replied, his tone brash yet tender, as if speaking to something fragile. <words>128</words>  

The teacher’s lips curled into a knowing smile. <words>134</words>  

"Knowledge is not freely given," she said, gesturing for him to step forward. <words>146</words>  

He placed the floorboard before her, its worn wood humming with latent power. <words>158</words>  

"This was taken from a place where truth was buried beneath necessary lies," he explained. <words>171</words>  

The students whispered among themselves, sensing the weight of his words. <words>182</words>  

The teacher knelt, running her fingers over the sigils, her expression unreadable. <words>194</words>  

"You followed nightmares to find this," she murmured, more statement than question. <words>206</words>  

He nodded, his face betraying nothing. <words>212</words>  

"Then you understand that some knowledge must remain hidden," she said. <words>224</words>  

He did not argue, for he knew the cost of unearthing forbidden truths. <words>236</words>  

Still, he had come too far to leave empty-handed. <words>245</words>  

The teacher sighed, then gestured for him to sit. <words>254</words>  

"If you wish to archive, you must first understand what you seek to preserve," she said. <words>268</words>  

The students gathered closer, their eyes gleaming with curiosity. <words>278</words>  

She began to speak, weaving a tale of rituals lost to time, of power hidden beneath layers of deception. <words>294</words>  

The wanderer listened, committing every word to memory. <words>303</words>  

He knew that some of what she said was a necessary lie, meant to protect rather than deceive. <words>318</words>  

But even lies held truth, if one knew how to listen. <words>328</words>  

As the night deepened, the floorboard pulsed beneath his fingertips, as if acknowledging his purpose. <words>342</words>  

The teacher finished her tale, her gaze locking onto his. <words>352</words>  

"Take what you have learned, but tread carefully," she warned. <words>364</words>  

He inclined his head, understanding the weight of her words. <words>375</words>  

With the floorboard in hand, he rose and turned to leave. <words>386</words>  

The students watched him go, their whispers fading into the night. <words>397</words>  

As he stepped beyond the training ground, the nightmares that had led him here began to shift. <words>412</words>  

They no longer guided him forward but warned him of what lay ahead. <words>424</words>  

Yet he walked on, for the archive was not yet complete. <words>435</words>  

And some truths, even those wrapped in lies, were worth the risk. <words>447</words>
