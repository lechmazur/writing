<story>  
The exiled prince stumbled into the abandoned customs office as the sudden snowstorm swallowed the horizon, his boots crunching over frostbitten ledgers and shattered inkwells. <words>28</words> He’d come to improve his fortunes, not through conquest or coin, but by seeking the cure for a loneliness that gnawed like winter wind. <words>53</words> The building’s vaulted ceiling loomed, its beams groaning under centuries of neglect, while moonlight seeped through cracks in the walls, painting the dust motes silver. <words>81</words> On a splintered desk lay an antique mortar and pestle, its obsidian surface etched with glyphs that seemed to shift when he blinked—unintentionally iconic, a relic meant for grinding herbs, not sealing fates. <words>113</words>  

As he gripped the pestle, the air thickened, and the room hummed with unseen forces, whispers curling like smoke from the corners. <words>136</words> A voice, neither kind nor cruel, slithered into his mind: *“To lock away the past, you must first grind its shadow into light.”* <words>161</words> Outside, the storm roared, but here, time frayed—a single keyhole materialized on the mortar’s rim, its shape matching the iron key hanging from his neck. <words>188</words> His hand trembled as he turned the key, the click echoing like a tomb’s seal. <words>203</words>  

Memories erupted: his exile, his brother’s betrayal, the hollow throne he’d once called home. <words>217</words> The pestle pulsed, and he understood—this was no mere tool, but a crucible. <words>231</words> He poured his grief into the mortar, grinding until his palms bled, until the glyphs glowed amber. <words>247</words> The shadows coalesced into figures—ghosts of merchants who’d passed through this office, their voices overlapping in fragmented tongues. <words>268</words> They weren’t specters of fear, but of kinship forgotten, stories abandoned like the building itself. <words>284</words>  

The storm ceased abruptly, leaving a silence so profound it ached. <words>295</words> A woman stood in the doorway, her cloak dusted with snow, eyes wide as if she’d followed a thread of destiny. <words>315</words> She spoke of a plague that had stolen her village’s laughter, of her own hunt for remedies. <words>332</words> The prince hesitated, then offered the mortar. <words>341</words> Together, they ground starlight and cedar resin, their hands brushing, the mixture shimmering with a warmth that defied the cold. <words>362</words>  

When dawn broke, the potion steamed—a salve for sorrow, a balm for barren hearts. <words>376</words> The glyphs faded; the mortar became ordinary stone. <words>385</words> Yet the prince felt no loss, for the woman’s laughter filled the hollows he’d carried. <words>400</words> As they left, the customs office creaked, its doors sealing shut behind them, the key dissolving into rust. <words>419</words> Some locks, he realized, weren’t meant to be reopened. <words>430</words>  

Snow began anew, but now it fell softly, a familiar unknown wrapping around them like a promise. <words>448</words> The cure, he suspected, had never been in the mortar—only the courage to let another hand stir its depths. <words>468</words>
