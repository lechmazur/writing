The mariner’s wheel hung above the door of the flower pressing workshop, its brass spokes glinting like a sun trapped in time. <words>24</words>  
Astra, the nomadic dreamer, traced its curves with calloused fingers, her gaze lingering on the dried lavender bundles swaying beneath it. <words>44</words>  
The workshop’s owner, a man named Kael with a voice ferociously polite, cleared his throat. <words>62</words>  
“The wheel isn’t decorative,” he said, adjusting his spectacles. “It steers more than ships.” <words>78</words>  
Astra’s pulse quickened; she’d been summoned here after a coin toss at dawn decided her inclusion in a secret mission—one meant to harmonize the fractured ley lines beneath the city. <words>105</words>  
Three others stood in the dim room: a botanist clutching pressed poppies, a locksmith with ink-stained palms, and a woman whose laughter rang a half-step too bright. <words>132</words>  
All bore masked intentions, Astra sensed, their smiles tight as drumheads. <words>143</words>  
Kael revealed the plan: at midnight, they’d use the wheel to redirect the ley currents, healing the land’s feverish tremors. <words>163</words>  
But the locksmith’s hands twitched when Kael mentioned “sacrifice,” and the botanist’s poppies trembled like guilty witnesses. <words>181</words>  
When the clock struck twelve, Astra gripped the wheel, its coldness seeping into her bones as the workshop walls dissolved into a star-strewn void. <words>203</words>  
The ley lines surged—violet rivers of energy—but the locksmith lunged, knife glinting, to sever one and claim its power. <words>222</words>  
“Harmony requires balance, not dominance,” Astra hissed, intervening by wrenching the wheel leftward. <words>237</words>  
The botanist screamed as poppies ignited, their ashes binding the locksmith’s limbs, while the too-bright woman whispered an incantation that tasted of salt and sorrow. <words>260</words>  
Astra’s hands blistered, but she laughed through tears as the ley lines wove themselves into a luminous tapestry, roots bursting through cobblestones above. <words>282</words>  
Kael collapsed, his spectacles shattered, his final breath a sigh of anguished joy. <words>295</words>  
The mission had demanded his life as anchor; Astra hadn’t known. <words>306</words>  
Dawn found her kneeling in a newborn meadow, the wheel now a relic buried under soil and scarlet petals. <words>324</words>  
The others had vanished, their secrets swallowed by the earth. <words>334</words>  
Astra pressed a poppy into her journal, its crimson a mirror of Kael’s spectacles glinting in memory. <words>351</words>  
She wandered onward, nomadic still, but now the wind carried whispers of roots knitting stone, of rivers singing in their beds. <words>371</words>  
Years later, sailors would swear the wheel’s ghost steered their ships through storms, guiding them toward ports where flowers bloomed from cracks in iron. <words>395</words>  
And in the hush after each coin toss, Astra would smile, ferociously polite, and say nothing of the night she’d gripped fate’s spine and whispered it straight. <words>420</words>
