<story>The guard’s name was Ellis, and he measured time in coffee spoons.<words>16</words> Each midnight, when the grocery store’s fluorescent hum dimmed to a breath, he’d climb the stockroom ladder into the floating island cloud café—a realm suspended above the cereal aisle, where time dripped like syrup and patrons whispered prayers to forgotten futures.<words>54</words> His uniform, starch-stiff and loyally disloyal, chafed as he knelt before the café’s clockless hearth, a basic measuring spoon trembling in his palm.<words>83</words> The spoon’s edge had gone soft, worn by decades of scraping against the hours.<words>99</words>  

Tonight, the café’s steam curled into cursive, spelling “seize” before dissolving.<words>115</words> Ellis pressed the spoon’s bowl to his lips, its hollow clink echoing the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys—a staccato mantra from his mother’s attic, where she’d once written love letters to a horizon she never reached.<words>153</words> Frothy despair pooled in his throat.<words>159</words> To worship time was to drown in its foam, but Ellis craved the sink.<words>173</words>  

A figure materialized: Maris, the café’s barista, her apron stitched with thread spun from comet tails.<words>191</words> “Still chasing your mother’s ghost?” she asked, grinding stardust into espresso.<words>205</words> Her voice carried the hush of unopened envelopes.<words>214</words>  

Ellis rotated the spoon, its numbers blurred.<words>221</words> “She said horizons are promises folded into origami cranes.<words>232</words> You just have to… unfold.”<words>237</words>  

Maris slid him a cup.<words>241</words> “Drink.<words>242</words> The midnight hush won’t last.”<words>247</words>  

The brew tasted of burnt typewriter ribbons and unsent apologies.<words>258</words> As Ellis swallowed, the café’s walls melted into the grocery store below—aisles warping, cart wheels squeaking backward.<words>278</words> A toddler’s dropped lollipop levitated, sticky and reborn.<words>289</words> Time’s edges softened, unraveling.<words>295</words>  

Maris gripped his wrist.<words>299</words> “Careful.<words>300</words> Measure wrong, and you’ll spoon out your own yesterday.”<words>311</words>  

But Ellis was already pouring.<words>316</words> The spoon became a pendulum, slicing the air with metallic ticks.<words>328</words> His mother’s face flickered in the steam—ink-stained fingers, a smile frayed by waiting.<words>344</words> “The horizon,” she’d rasped, “is a thief.<words>353</words> Steal first.”<words>356</words>  

The floor shuddered.<words>359</words> Cans of soup clattered like hail as the café lurched westward, chasing dawn’s hidden hinge.<words>376</words> Ellis clutched the spoon, its heat searing his palm.<words>387</words> Loyalty to the store? To this ghostly perch?<words>398</words> Both, neither.<words>400</words> Disloyalty was its own sacrament here.<words>407</words>  

Maris shouted a warning, but the words crumbled.<words>415</words> Ellis lunged, spoon outstretched, and carved a hole in the sky.<words>428</words> Light bled through—not sunlight, but the gold of a promise kept.<words>442</words>  

The café dissolved.<words>445</words> Ellis stood alone in the stockroom, the spoon cold in his fist.<words>458</words> Dawn smudged the windows.<words>462</words> Somewhere, a typewriter clacked.<words>468</words> He smiled, froth on his tongue, and began to write.<words>479</words></story>
