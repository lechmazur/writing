<story>Captain Veyra adjusted the frayed fragment of medieval tapestry above her navigation console, its embroidered dragons writhing under the pulsar’s crimson glare.<words>27</words> The gambler’s fingers brushed the relic—her sole inheritance from Earth—as telekinetic dice hovered above her palm, calculating jump coordinates through probabilities only she could bend.<words>57</words> “Coordinates locked,” she announced, though the crew knew it wasn’t the ship’s AI deciding, but the woman who’d once bankrupted a Martian casino by “persuading” dice to roll centuries-old crop rotation patterns mid-game.<words>94</words>  

“Why keep that moldy cloth?” grumbled Jax, their engineer, eyeing the tapestry.<words>110</words> Veyra’s reply was habitually practical: “Dragons guard things—in this case, instructions for terraforming acidic soil, stitched in a lost language.”<words>134</words> She didn’t mention the whispers.<words>139</words> At night, the tapestry’s threads hummed in Old Gaelic, recounting her family’s tradition—planting an oak sapling for every birth, burning a branch at every death.<words>168</words> Fire for endings, roots for beginnings.<words>175</words>  

The navigation room shuddered as pirate frigates descended, their ion cannons flaring like matchheads.<words>193</words> Veyra rolled her dice, hurtling the ship into an asteroid belt, fragments screeching against hull metal.<words>211</words> “They’re after the vault,” Jax spat, referring to the seed bank beneath their feet—heirloom crops extinct everywhere but in this splintered syndicate’s care.<words>236</words> Veyra’s ancestors had buried seeds with each tree, encoding cultivation secrets in Celtic knots.<words>253</words> Now, raiders wanted to weaponize famine.<words>262</words>  

A plasma torch breached the door.<words>267</words> Veyra gripped the tapestry, its threads suddenly searing.<words>278</words> The largest dragon’s eye glowed—a hidden dialect.<words>287</words> “Ignis,” she breathed, and the cloth erupted in blue flame, searing coordinates into the air.<words>305</words> The dice snapped to the symbols, recalculating toward a dead star’s oasis-planet.<words>322</words>  

They crashed into violet soil, pirates in pursuit.<words>332</words> Veyra sprinted, seed vault strapped to her back, until she stumbled into a grove—oaks, their gnarled trunks marked with names.<words>354</words> Her lineage.<words>356</words> Here, her great-grandmother had burned a branch, ash nurturing the first sapling off-Earth.<words>374</words>  

She plunged her hands into dirt, telekinesis rippling through roots.<words>387</words> The oldest tree split, revealing a hollow glowing with symbology.<words>399</words> Raiders raised weapons—then froze as vines erupted, ensnaring them in thorns.<words>417</words> The tapestry’s language wasn’t just instructions.<words>425</words> It was a covenant.<words>428</words>  

When the last pirate fell, Veyra planted a seed where the hollow had been.<words>444</words> “For the ones who’ll need this,” she told Jax, nodding at the vault.<words>458</words> The dice, nestled in her pocket, warmed approvingly.<words>468</words> Above, the tapestry’s ashes shimmered into new constellations—a dragon guarding a tree, its roots threading the stars.<words>491</words>  

That night, she burned a oak twig, its smoke curling into the navigation room’s sacred disorder.<words>511</words> Beginnings, after all, required endings.<words>518</words></story>
