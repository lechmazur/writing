The jovial sellsword, Garrick, whistled as he adjusted the brass astronomical telescope, its lens reflecting constellations that shimmered like spilled salt above the witch’s herb garden. <words>33</words> He’d inherited both the instrument and the family tradition of burying time capsules—a ritual now tethered to his withering vow to reclaim his father’s lost honor. <words>63</words> “Boldly reluctant,” his mother had called him, a phrase that gnawed at him as he dug through moonlit soil, avoiding venomous snapdragons that hissed like displeased librarians. <words>92</words>  

The garden thrived under a curse: daylight withered it, but moonlight spurred vines to slither and petals to glow like embers, a dance of elegant mayhem Garrick had no patience for tonight. <words>125</words> His shovel struck iron—a chest, its lock etched with star charts. <words>138</words> Inside lay his father’s final treasure—a journal detailing how to dethrone doubt from the mind, a lesson Garrick’s lineage had buried rather than mastered. <words>165</words>  

A rasping laugh echoed. <words>168</words> The witch emerged, her hair a nest of thorns, eyes sharp as comet trails. <words>181</words> “You’ve stolen from my garden, sellsword,” she said, and the earth trembled, roots coiling around his ankles. <words>198</words> Garrick grinned, sweat glinting on his brow. <words>205</words> “Borrowed, milady! This capsule’s older than your grudges.” <words>216</words> He tossed her a silver locket from the chest—a portrait of his father and the witch, young and smiling. <words>234</words>  

Her wrath faltered. <words>235</words> “He vowed to return,” she whispered, clutching the locket as the garden’s frenzy stilled. <words>248</words> Garrick’s cheer dimmed. <words>251</words> “He failed. But I’m here to finish it.” <words>259</words> The journal’s pages revealed a ritual: align the telescope with the North Star at the transformation’s peak—when the garden’s magic shifted from growth to decay—to unlock clarity. <words>289</words>  

Midnight approached. <words>290</words> Vines thickened, roses bleeding black nectar as the witch chanted, her voice weaving through the chaos. <words>307</words> Garrick squinted through the telescope, adjusting gears until starlight focused into a beam that ignited the journal’s hidden map. <words>326</words> Coordinates glowed—a vault beneath the garden, holding not gold, but his family’s archived courage. <words>343</words>  

The witch gripped his shoulder. <words>347</words> “Your father’s doubt consumed him. Yours need not.” <words>357</words> Garrick exhaled, the vow’s weight lifting as the beam pierced the ground, unearthing a second capsule—a simple oak box. <words>377</words> Inside lay a child’s drawing: himself, his father, and the witch, labeled “Family.” <words>391</words>  

Laughter burst from him, raw and real. <words>397</words> The garden’s frenzy softened to a hum, petals settling like resigned confetti. <words>410</words> The witch’s thorny hair loosened into silver curls. <words>419</words> “You’ve your father’s stubbornness,” she said, smiling faintly. <words>429</words> Garrick tucked the drawing into his coat. <words>437</words> “And his knack for elegant messes.” <words>444</words>  

As dawn threatened, they reburied the chest, its new contents including Garrick’s flask and the witch’s locket—a pact to unearth both treasures and truths when the stars aligned again. <words>474</words> Doubt, for now, had been dethroned. <words>481</words> Garrick whistled anew, the garden’s withering vow replaced by seeds of something quieter, sturdier, alive. <words>497</words>
