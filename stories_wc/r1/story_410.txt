In the belly of the cavern cathedral, where phosphorescent flora pulsed like forgotten constellations, the astute hermit stared at his blunt scissors and muttered, “Perfect tool for a plumbing savant.”<words>34</words>  
The elevator’s metallic groan echoed through the chamber as it settled onto the empty floor—its 17th pointless arrival this week.<words>58</words>  
“Still no engineers,” he sighed, tossing the scissors at a corroded pipe valve. They bounced off, clattering into a puddle.<words>77</words>  
Isolation had taught him two things: sarcasm fermented well underground, and nobody cared if the subterranean aquifers dried up.<words>97</words>  
But the hermit cared.<words>100</words>  
He’d rigged the cathedral’s fungal grove into a bakery, coaxing sourdough from cave lichen.<words>116</words>  
Today’s loaf steamed on a geothermal vent, its scent seeping into the stagnant air.<words>132</words>  
“Amplify this,” he grumbled, inhaling deeply.<words>138</words>  
The fungi flared brighter.<words>141</words>  
So did the hermit’s headache.<words>145</words>  
“Right. Bioluminescent yeast. Should’ve guessed.” He massaged his temples, watching spores swirl like drunken fireflies.<words>164</words>  
The scissors gleamed mockingly from the puddle.<words>170</words>  
He retrieved them, squinting at the valve.<words>176</words>  
Three years alone, decoding water schematics etched in mineral deposits.<words>187</words>  
Three years talking to mushrooms.<words>192</words>  
Three years since surface-dwellers stopped answering distress signals.<words>200</words>  
The bread’s aroma thickened, sweet and earthy.<words>207</words>  
The fungi hummed.<words>209</words>  
“Fine. Let’s try your way.” He wedged the scissors’ dull edge into the valve.<words>226</words>  
The spores surged.<words>229</words>  
Metal screeched.<words>230</words>  
The valve turned.<words>232</words>  
“Strangely effective,” he admitted, as ancient pipes shuddered awake.<words>243</words>  
Water gurgled through stone veins.<words>248</words>  
The elevator dinged again.<words>251</words>  
“Late as usual,” he called, not looking up from the resurrected flow.<words>263</words>  
Silence answered.<words>265</words>  
The hermit smiled—a cracked, rusty thing.<words>272</words>  
He tore the bread, steam curling like ghostly applause.<words>281</words>  
“Bon appétit,” he told the glowing dark.<words>287</words>  
Somewhere above, aquifers sighed in relief.<words>293</words>  
Somewhere below, the scissors sank into final retirement.<words>301</words>  
The elevator kept arriving.<words>304</words>  
He stopped counting.<words>307</words>  
When surface engineers finally descended, they found functioning hydraulics, bioluminescent toast crumbs, and a note: “Plumbing’s easy. Sanity’s optional.”<words>330</words>  
They took photos, sampled the fungi, left bewildered.<words>339</words>  
The hermit watched from a shadowed alcove, chewing lichen jerky.<words>350</words>  
“Took you long enough,” he told their backs.<words>358</words>  
The water systems purred.<words>361</words>  
The bread never stopped baking.<words>366</words>  
And in the cathedral’s heart, where light and loneliness fermented together, the astute hermit perfected his recipe for despairing humor.<words>388</words>  
“Next time,” he informed the elevator, “bring butter.”<words>397</words>  
The spores giggled.<words>399</words>  
He didn’t.<words>400</words>  
But the water flowed.<words>403</words>  
And in the cavern’s eternal twilight, that counted as laughter.<words>414</words>  
The scissors stayed submerged, dreaming of usefulness.<words>422</words>  
The hermit stayed dry, dreaming of nothing.<words>430</words>
