The understudy sorcerer, known to the salt crystal grove as Thistlewick the Obsequiously Courteous, balanced a small cardboard box on his knee while scrubbing a robe crusted with enchanted lint. <words>30</words>  
"Pardon the intrusion, most venerable laundering spirits," he murmured, bowing to the suds-churning cauldron, "but might I borrow a smidgen of lye to unstick this stubborn hex?" <words>60</words>  
The chamber’s salt pillars hummed in reply, their geodes flickering like disapproving eyes—they detested interruptions during laundry cycles. <words>82</words>  
Thistlewick’s true task lay hidden beneath his politeness: tonight, he would wake the unheard. <words>98</words>  
For three centuries, the ancient oak grove bordering the chamber had whispered secrets of cultural evolution into the salt veins, chronicling humanity’s shifts from barter to blockchain. <words>127</words>  
But since the laundry automation spells went rogue, their murmurs had dissolved into static—and Thistlewick’s thesis on meme-driven feudalism remained woefully incomplete. <words>155</words>  
The box, salvaged from a disintegrating Amazonian tomb, contained six stolen oak leaves pressed between papyrus sheets of 14th-century Yelp reviews. <words>179</words>  
"With profoundest apologies to arboreal dignitaries," he whispered, arranging the leaves into a fractal pattern, "might I trouble you for a brief symposium?" <words>205</words>  
Salt crystals began shivering in their growth racks as the chamber’s walls thinned, revealing gnarled roots pulsing with half-heard folktales. <words>227</words>  
Thistlewick leaned closer, ear hovering above the leaves—only to jerk back when a tendril of root syrup glued his cravat to the floor. <words>250</words>  
"Ah! A most ingenious hindrance, esteemed sentinel oaks! Might I propose..." <words>265</words>  
His baritone dissolved into a yelp as the box shuddered, spewing Elizabethan gossip columns and TikTok dance tutorials into the salt-fogged air. <words>288</words>  
The grove was fighting back, flooding his research with cultural noise. <words>300</words>  
"Terribly sorry about the spam," Thistlewick coughed, swatting away a viral cat video, "but if we could focus on Neolithic tax reforms..." <words>323</words>  
A root snapped his suspenders. <words>327</words>  
The sorcerer’s politeness curdled into strategy: he hurled a sock full of salt crystals at the trembling wall, shocking the grove into momentary silence. <words>349</words>  
In that pause, he heard it—the original whisper, raw and root-deep, singing of clay tablets and quantum algorithms merging. <words>371</words>  
Cultural evolution wasn’t linear but helical, the voice crooned, each revolution a Möbius strip of memes and monarchies. <words>392</words>  
Thistlewick scrambled to transcribe the revelation onto a detergent label, fingers trembling. <words>407</words>  
The box disintegrated. <words>409</words>  
The oaks roared. <words>411</words>  
"Indubitably fascinating!" he shouted over the splitting salt pillars, bowing as ceiling shards rained down. <words>428</words>  
His cravat finally tore free, and Thistlewick fled through the collapsing chamber, thesis clutched tight, laundry forgotten, and the grove’s laughter echoing with playful dread. <words>455</words>
