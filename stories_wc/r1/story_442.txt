<story>  
Silas adjusted his leather goggles, the cracked lens smearing the bioluminescent glow of the giant mushroom house into halos of blurry vividness. <words>23</words>  
He traced the torn corner of a flyer wedged between fungal shelves—a fragment advertising "Eternal Flames, 50% Off!"—before tossing it into his satchel of dubious remedies. <words>50</words>  
The tradesman's comfortingly pessimistic chuckle echoed through the chamber. <words>62</words>  
"Final rotation of the windmill," he muttered, synchronizing his brass wristwatch with the trembling gears embedded in the mushroom's stalk. <words>85</words>  
Three minutes until the mechanism's death rattle would vectorize this reality, collapsing all paths into calculable trajectories through the endless void beyond. <words>108</words>  
Memory was the first casualty here, Silas knew—the distortion seeped into minds like spores, rewriting hours into decades, faces into shadows. <words>134</words>  
He gripped the flickering candle tighter, its flame warping as though strained by the weight of the unlit cosmos outside. <words>157</words>  
The watches ticked louder, synchronized to the mill’s final groan. <words>169</words>  
A buyer once told him hope was a currency; Silas had laughed until his ribs ached. <words>186</words>  
Pessimism was cheaper, lighter, and far harder to extinguish. <words>196</words>  

The walls shuddered, fungal flesh peeling to reveal the void—a vacuum so absolute it gnawed at the candle’s light. <words>220</words>  
Silas stepped into the abyss, his boots finding purchase on invisible vectors only the synchronized watches could chart. <words>241</words>  
Each coordinate hissed into his ear via a timed pulse, numbers fraying like the edges of that damned flyer. <words>261</words>  
Had it been his own hand that tore it? <words>269</words>  
Or had the memory grafted itself into his skull, another phantom bargain? <words>283</words>  
The candle sputtered. <words>285</words>  
He snarled, shielding it with his coat—a relic stitched from the hides of extinct moths. <words>302</words>  

Time bled. <words>304</words>  
The windmill’s last rotation stretched into a century of footsteps, the watches now discordant, their precision unraveling. <words>325</words>  
Silas glimpsed shapes—a marketplace? A childhood room?—fracturing like glass under the void’s pressure. <words>343</words>  
"Distortion’s just clarity wearing different boots," he lied to the dark, sweat pooling beneath his goggles. <words>363</words>  
The flame dimmed to an ember. <words>370</words>  
Then—a resonance. <words>372</words>  
The vectorized path snapped taut, yanking him toward a pinprick of light. <words>387</words>  

He stumbled into another mushroom chamber, identical down to the flyer’s torn corner on the shelf. <words>408</words>  
But the candle now burned blue, its wax unmelting. <words>420</words>  
Silas checked his watch. <words>423</words>  
The windmill’s gears lay silent. <words>428</words>  
"Another transaction complete," he rasped, though no one witnessed it—no one ever did. <words>445</words>  
Memory would distort this, too. <words>450</words>  
He’d remember it as a victory. <words>455</words>  
Or a swindle. <words>457</words>  
Either way, the void remained fed, and his pockets stayed full of time. <words>473</words>  
Silas blew out the candle, savoring the smoke’s bitter tang. <words>484</words>  
Somewhere, a forgotten windmill began to turn. <words>494</words>
