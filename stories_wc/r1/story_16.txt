<story>  
The engine room hummed with residual heat, its brass pipes still trembling from the steamship’s ascent into the star-flecked sky. <words>25</words>  
Lira Voss, a freelancer who’d outsourced her own heartbeat to caffeine and adrenaline, adjusted her goggles and pressed a palm against the warm amber ring in her pocket—the last good intention her grandmother had forged before dementia stole her. <words>54</words>  
The wedding guests had departed hours ago, their laughter swallowed by the hush of altitude, leaving only the groom’s ancient aunt slumped in a velvet chair upstairs, her mind a labyrinth of unwritten histories. <words>83</words>  
“Chronicle elder wisdom,” the client had ordered, but Lira knew the truth: wisdom, like steam, dissipated if not contained. <words>101</words>  
She’d outwit the ship’s clockwork sentry, its pistons synced to the rhythm of waves against a cliff—or so the schematics claimed—but first, she needed the aunt’s memories, stored in that ring, to stabilize the fracturing lore of a dying guild. <words>138</words>  
The sentry’s lens rotated, scanning the room in metronomic sweeps. <words>146</words>  
Lira timed its clicks, each pause a half-beat longer than the last, like tide retreating from stone. <words>159</words>  
Inhaling coal-scented air, she slid between shadows, her boots silent on grille floors, and pried open a maintenance panel. <words>177</words>  
Wires coiled like vipers, their copper gleaming in the gaslight’s jaundiced glow. <words>189</words>  
Her fingers trembled—not from fear, but the ring’s resonance, its inadvertent profundity seeping into her veins. <words>203</words>  
Grandmother’s voice flickered in her skull: *“Intentions outlive us, girl. Even the broken ones.”* <words>216</words>  
The sentry’s gear jammed abruptly; Lira lunged, splicing two cables to mimic a pressure leak. <words>229</words>  
Alarms blared—a distraction. <words>232</words>  
She sprinted to the upper deck, where the aunt snored softly, her wrinkles etched with tales of airship rebellions and buried codes. <words>249</words>  
The ring pulsed as Lira clasped the woman’s hand, its amber core swirling with stolen memories. <words>262</words>  
“Forgive me,” she whispered, though forgiveness was a currency she’d freelanced away long ago. <words>275</words>  
A piston exploded below, shaking the ship. <words>281</words>  
The sentry’s gears recalibrated, its rhythm disrupted. <words>288</words>  
Lira ducked as a pressure valve blew, shrapnel embedding in the wall beside her. <words>300</words>  
Scattered harmony, she thought—chaos and order, a fugue of survival. <words>310</words>  
The aunt’s eyes fluttered open, milky but sharp. <words>317</words>  
“You’ve got her fire,” she rasped, gripping Lira’s wrist. <words>326</words>  
“But fire consumes.” <words>329</words>  
The ring blazed, memories flooding Lira’s mind: blueprints, alliances, a cure for engine corrosion lost to time. <words>344</words>  
She staggered, gasping as the sentry’s claw grazed her shoulder. <words>353</words>  
Rolling beneath a pipe, she hurled a wrench at the emergency boiler. <words>363</words>  
Steam erupted, blinding the machine. <words>368</words>  
Lira fled to the cargo hold, sealing the door behind her. <words>377</words>  
The ring cooled, its amber dimming. <words>383</words>  
In her palm, it felt lighter—emptier. <words>389</words>  
Had she succeeded? <words>391</words>  
The client would demand proof, but the aunt’s warning lingered. <words>400</words>  
Wisdom, Lira realized, wasn’t a chronicle to possess. <words>408</words>  
It was a rhythm, relentless as waves, eroding cliffs into sand. <words>418</words>  
She pocketed the ring, its weight now a question, and stepped into the unresolved dawn. <words>431</words>
