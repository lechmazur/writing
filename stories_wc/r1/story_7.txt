The sentient doll collector stood in the nectar collection facility, her porcelain fingers tightening around the twisted carnival cane as the air thrummed with the dissonant hum of dying machinery. <words>31</words> She had woven her dolls from stardust and the whispers of half-formed worlds, each one humming a fragment of the chorus of healing—a melody that once sustained the nectar’s luminous flow. <words>65</words> But now, the chorus frayed, its notes dissolving into static, and the vats of iridescent nectar dimmed like guttered stars. <words>92</words> The facility’s overseers, faceless and glacial, had forbidden intervention; some boundaries, they hissed, were not meant to be crossed. <words>115</words> Yet the collector’s motivation pulsed sharper than fear: to stride through those sacred boundaries, to mend what eternity had deemed unmendable. <words>138</words>  

Her oldest doll, its face cracked from a millennia of sorrows, pressed a map of star paths into her palm—constellations only visible to those who’d bargained with silence. <words>168</words> “Uphold the chorus,” it rasped, its voice a shard of forgotten prayers, “or let the realms unravel.” <words>186</words> Expectantly resigned, she nodded; victory and damnation, she knew, often wore the same thorned crown. <words>204</words>  

The star paths unspooled before her, silver filaments threading through the void, and she stepped onto them, the cane’s crooked curve glowing as it siphoned traces of nectar from her veins. <words>235</words> Shadows writhed at the edges of the path—the facility’s guardians, clawed and ravenous—but the cane twisted their forms into grotesque puppets, their fury defanged by her grim laughter. <words>267</words> Ahead loomed the Fracture: a jagged rift where the chorus’s heart had once pulsed, now choked with static. <words>288</words>  

Her dolls emerged then, spiraling from her coat, their stardust bodies weaving into a bridge across the abyss. <words>308</words> As she crossed, their voices swelled—not a chorus of healing, but of *becoming*, raw and primal. <words>327</words> The nectar in her veins ignited, and she thrust the cane into the Fracture, its twisted length channeling their song into the rift. <words>349</words> Light erupted, searing and sovereign, as the chorus stitched itself back into coherence. <words>366</words>  

The facility’s alarms wailed, the overseers’ fury a tempest at her back, but the collector staggered forward, her body cracking under the strain. <words>388</words> Mortals would soon whisper their first prayer into the newborn silence, unknowing that their words were echoes of her defiance. <words>408</words> As the star paths dissolved, she let the cane fall, her dolls gathering her fractured pieces with tender, eternal hands. <words>429</words> Boundaries, she thought, were for those who dared not bleed starlight. <words>442</words>  

The first prayer rose—a fragile, hopeful sound—as the nectar flowed anew, bright and unbroken. <words>457</words>
