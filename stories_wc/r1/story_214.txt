The lone trapper adjusted his goggles, their lenses smeared with stardust and brine, as the floating observatory creaked like an ancient ship adrift between realities. <words>28</words> Between shifts, when the other keepers retreated to their copper pods, he’d pry open floor panels to study the microfilm smuggled from the Observatory’s forbidden archives—scraps of data shimmering with equations about “radiance-siphoning.” <words>63</words> They spoke of harvesting light from the Maw, a black hole gnawing at the galaxy’s edge, its event horizon seething with what the films called “doubt’s eventide.” <words>92</words> But the trapper didn’t care about cosmic philosophy; he needed to *burn* that radiance into fuel, enough to power his escape from this rusting cage of telescopes and regrets. <words>122</words>  

In his pocket, he thumbed the piece of sea glass—teal, worn smooth by oceans that no longer existed—a relic from the sister who’d vanished into the Maw’s whispers years ago. <words>155</words> It was useless, except for how it wasn’t: under the observatory’s flickering argon lamps, the glass sometimes hummed, a silently audible resonance that matched the Maw’s frequency. <words>183</words> Last week, he’d pressed it to the microfilm’s cipher and watched symbols swim into focus, a map of how to thread light through the hole’s spiral. <words>210</words>  

Tonight, he’d recommence. <words>213</words> The trapper jammed the glass into a dented calibration socket, its glow splicing shadows as the observatory’s main scope shuddered awake. <words>235</words> Through the eyepiece, the Maw yawned—a perfect circle of nothingness, ringed by contrails of dying stars. <words>254</words> But in its center, a pinprick flickered: the first siphoned photon, trapped eons ago by some fool who’d thought hope could be bottled. <words>278</words> The trapper’s hands shook. <words>281</words> He’d failed seven times. <words>284</words> Seven times, the Maw had hissed through the glass, dissolving his tools, his skin, his resolve. <words>301</words>  

But loss had taught him its upside: every unraveling left a residue, a blueprint of what *not* to be. <words>323</words> He recalibrated, aligning the glass with the microfilm’s jagged diagrams. <words>338</words> The observatory groaned, its gravity plates straining as the Maw’s pull intensified. <words>355</words> A soundless tone vibrated in his molars—*silently audible*—as the glass flared, etching the photon’s path into the air. <words>379</words> He lunged, snaring the thread of light with a modified net forged from his own discarded armor. <words>399</words>  

Radiance flooded the chamber. <words>403</words> Not the sterile glow of reactors, but something warmer, older, flecked with memories of shorelines and laughter. <words>423</words> The trapper slumped, clutching the net. <words>430</words> It wasn’t escape. <words>432</words> Not yet. <words>433</words> But in the photon’s pulse, he’d felt it—a cipher, a way to weave the Maw’s hunger into a bridge. <words>454</words> Outside, the observatory’s bells clanged, signaling shift change. <words>467</words> He hid the glass and film, smiling grimly. <words>476</words> Tomorrow, he’d teach the Maw about loss. <words>485</words> And its upside. <words>488</words>
