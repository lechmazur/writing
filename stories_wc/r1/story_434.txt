<story>The air in the ghost story recording booth hummed with static, its walls papered with peeling soundproof foam that swallowed the lonely ringleader’s laughter like a crypt. (23 words) <words>23</words>  
Marlo adjusted the vintage microphone, its brass grille smudged by decades of nervous fingertips, and smoothed the stained napkin tucked beneath it—a relic from her great-grandmother, embroidered with constellations only she could decipher. (43 words) <words>66</words>  
“Ancestral wisdom,” her mother had sneered, “is commonly individual, not communal—burdens, not gifts.” (14 words) <words>80</words>  
But the napkin’s threads glowed faintly tonight, reacting to the whispers seeping through the booth’s door: confessions from the midnight callers outside, their secrets pooling like ink in the shadows. (33 words) <words>113</words>  
Marlo’s pulse quickened. The artifact was stirring. (7 words) <words>120</words>  
She flicked the lighter—her father’s old Zippo—and let the flame pirouette in the zero gravity she’d engineered using a modified speaker coil, its magnetic field neutralizing the booth’s pull. (32 words) <words>152</words>  
The fire twisted into a helix, casting jagged shadows that slithered up the walls. (15 words) <words>167</words>  
“Clever,” rasped a voice from the corner, where the darkest shadow congealed into a figure with too many teeth. (22 words) <words>189</words>  
Marlo grinned, all carnival bravado. “You’re here for the napkin.” (9 words) <words>198</words>  
The thing lunged, but she tilted the lighter, guiding the flame’s dance—a waltz of heat and distortion. (19 words) <words>217</words>  
The shadow recoiled, its edges singed. “You can’t outmaneuver entropy, little keeper.” (12 words) <words>229</words>  
“Watch me,” she crooned, spinning the flame faster, its light fracturing into prismatic threads that wove through the napkin’s constellations. (22 words) <words>251</words>  
The booth shuddered as ancestral voices surged through the microphone—her grandmother’s lullabies, her brother’s last laugh, a chorus of dead kin defying the void. (29 words) <words>280</words>  
The shadow writhed, unraveling like yarn. (6 words) <words>286</words>  
“Guardianship,” Marlo hissed, “isn’t about strength. It’s about…flair.” (10 words) <words>296</words>  
She blew the flame into a supernova, its final blaze searing the shadow to ash. (16 words) <words>312</words>  
Silence. (1 word) <words>313</words>  
The napkin dimmed, its duty fulfilled—for now. (8 words) <words>321</words>  
Marlo slumped into her chair, the booth’s gravity reinstated, and pressed “record” again. (14 words) <words>335</words>  
“Next caller,” she trilled, her voice syrup-sweet, “what keeps you awake at 3 a.m.?” (15 words) <words>350</words>  
As the whispers resumed, she traced the napkin’s stains—tea, blood, stardust—and wondered which ancestor had first danced with flames to guard what shouldn’t exist. (27 words) <words>377</words>  
Outside, the studio’s hallway stretched empty, but Marlo’s reflection in the glass smirked back, winking with a playfulness that didn’t reach her eyes. (24 words) <words>401</words>  
“Till next confession,” she murmured, and let the dread curl at the edges of her smile. (17 words) <words>418</words>  
The lighter clicked once more, a tiny sun cupped in her palm, ready to outmaneuver the dark again. (19 words) <words>437</words>  
Some legacies, she thought, are best kept between ghosts and gasoline. (12 words) <words>449</words>
