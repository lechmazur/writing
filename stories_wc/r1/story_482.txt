The insomniac painter dipped her brush into a jar of starlight, her fingers trembling as she traced another hollow grin onto the canvas. <words>23</words> Around her, the arboreal workshop swayed gently, its wooden planks creaking beneath clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms that pulsed like drowsy hearts. <words>49</words> She wore the tapered wizard’s hat—its bullet hole patched with spider silk—though its magic had faded years ago, leaving only the scent of burnt lavender and a stubborn ache behind her eyes. <words>81</words>  

Midnight had passed, and the puddles pooling on the floorboards began to shimmer, reflecting not the room but fragments of faces: clients who’d demanded joy in their portraits, their true sorrows buried behind the painted smiles. <words>117</words> “Peacefully chaotic,” she muttered, describing both the studio’s moss-choked chaos and the storm in her chest as she knelt to scry. <words>137</words> The first puddle showed a widow laughing at her husband’s funeral; the second, a king weeping into his jesters’ collars. <words>155</words> Each vision tightened the knot in her throat—she had to devour them, as the hat once devoured spells, or they’d poison her craft. <words>175</words>  

A crow landed on the windowsill, its beak clacking a familiar taunt: *Outlast the final obstacle, or join the ghosts in your brushes*. <words>195</words> The “obstacle” hung unspoken—the portrait she’d never finished, the one that had summoned the bullet meant for her. <words>213</words> Her mentor’s face flickered in a puddle, his smile sharp as broken glass, and she hurled a jar of indigo pigment at the image, splattering the walls like a bruise. <words>237</words>  

Dawn approached, leaching the darkness from the room until it resembled an empty classroom, all chalkdust and hollow echoes. <words>255</words> The hush felt heavier now, the mushrooms dimming as sunlight filtered through the trees. <words>269</words> She slumped into her chair, clutching the hat, its frayed edges tickling her wrists. <words>283</words> Frolicsome regret, she decided, was the perfect term for this moment—giggling at the absurdity of her survival while tears streaked her charcoal-stained cheeks. <words>305</words>  

The final puddle rippled, revealing her own face, not as she was but as she’d been: a young artist, grinning wildly as she stole the hat from her mentor’s corpse. <words>329</words> “You owe me,” she told her reflection, then pressed her palm into the water, drinking the memory until her ribs ached and the room spun. <words>349</words> When the vision cleared, she reached for a fresh canvas, mixing hues with trembling hands—ash-gray for resilience, gold for stolen time. <words>370</words>  

By first light, the portrait emerged: her mentor’s face, not smirking but serene, his bullet hole blooming into a rose pinned to the hat’s brim. <words>391</words> The studio’s mushrooms glowed anew, their light harmonizing with the dawn as the crow retreated, silenced. <words>407</words> She slumped forward, exhaustion and triumph twisting into something like peace. <words>418</words> The obstacle hadn’t been the painting, she realized, but the lie she’d worn as brightly as the hat. <words>434</words> Now, the smiles she painted could be hollow or true—it no longer mattered. <words>446</words> She’d devoured the shadows, and for the first time in years, sleep crept over her like a forgiven debt. <words>464</words>
