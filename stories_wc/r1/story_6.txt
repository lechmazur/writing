<story>  
The skeptical minstrel plucked a dissonant chord on his lute, glaring at the abandoned disappearing ink factory where the air shimmered like lies drying on parchment. <words>27</words>  
Midday sunlight pooled around the empty mailbox—its hush a taunt, as though the immortal trickster had already stolen every plea for help the minstrel never sent. <words>52</words>  
"Reckless generosity," he muttered, recalling the tavern drunks who’d begged him to confront the entity haunting the factory. <words>71</words>  
Their stories reeked of impossibly plausible nonsense: a dragon-scale armor scrap, glowing in the steam vents, capable of piercing an immortal’s vanity. <words>91</words>  
He kicked open the factory door, and the hiss of ancient machinery greeted him like a serpent’s laugh. <words>107</words>  
There, wedged in a fissure above a rusted boiler, lay the scale—a jagged shard the size of his palm, humming with heat. <words>126</words>  
"Perfect for a slingshot," he drawled, though his throat tightened. <words>135</words>  
The trickster’s voice slithered from the shadows: "You’d arm a pebble to slay a mountain?" <words>147</words>  
The minstrel didn’t turn. <words>150</words>  
He’d heard immortality made one terrible at metaphors. <words>157</words>  
Wrapping the scale in wire torn from a conveyor belt, he crouched beside a steam vent, its rhythmic hiss syncing with his pulse. <words>177</words>  
Generosity, he reasoned, wasn’t kindness—it was calculus. <words>184</words>  
Give the scale a trajectory, let the vent’s breath be its powder, and even an immortal might flinch. <words>199</words>  
The trickster materialized—a shifting silhouette with foxfire eyes. <words>208</words>  
"You’ve no music for this fight, bard." <words>214</words>  
"Music’s just structured doubt," the minstrel said, loading the scale into his makeshift slingshot. <words>227</words>  
He fired. <words>228</words>  
The vent roared, propelling the scale in a spiraling arc that split the trickster’s form like shattered glass. <words>245</words>  
For a heartbeat, the factory held its breath. <words>252</words>  
Then the shards coalesced, the trickster’s laughter now edged with ire. <words>263</words>  
"Clever," it hissed. <words>265</words>  
"But you’ve only made me *interesting*." <words>271</words>  
The minstrel grinned, sweat dripping onto his lute. <words>278</words>  
He’d gambled on irreverence—awe without submission—and the dragon-scale’s glow brightened as the trickster’s power recoiled. <words>297</words>  
"Generosity," he said, plucking a chord that mirrored the steam’s rhythm, "is giving a liar exactly what they’ll regret wanting." <words>315</words>  
The scale pulsed, its resonance binding the trickster to the factory’s crumbling bones. <words>327</words>  
Immortality, it turned out, couldn’t out-scheme a paradox wrapped in reckless intent. <words>339</words>  
As the trickster dissolved into the hissing vents, the minstrel pocketed the now-dull scale, its purpose spent. <words>356</words>  
Outside, the mailbox remained empty, but the silence felt lighter—a punchline waiting for its joke. <words>371</words>  
He strummed a ballad as he left, lyrics blooming between truth and fabrication. <words>382</words>  
After all, the best stories were impossibly plausible. <words>390</words>  
And the best tricks required giving everything away. <words>399</words>  
The factory’s ink-stained walls sighed behind him, their vanished words swirling into the irreverent awe of midday. <words>417</words>
