<story>  
The gracious widow Marisol slipped between meals into the ruined orchard district, her boots crunching ancient pomegranate husks buried under centuries of thick fog. <words>34</words>  
She carried a postcard stamped with a smudged raven, its message cryptic: *“Stoke the forge; the gods forget what they cannot bend.”* <words>64</words>  
The blacksmith’s forge stood skeletal amid gnarled apple trees, its chimney exhaling smoke that curled like a beckoning finger. <words>88</words>  
Marisol traced the anvil’s cold edge, recalling her husband’s laughter echoing here before the gods claimed him for “impertinent craftsmanship.” <words>111</words>  
Now, she nurtured defiance in the ashes, feeding the furnace with oak and old hymns, each flame a rebuttal to divine decree. <words>135</words>  
Another postcard arrived at dawn, ink bleeding through rain: *“Seven seeds beneath the seventh tree—water them with your shadow.”* <words>158</words>  
Solemnly absurd, she obeyed, burying blighted apple seeds in soil that hissed, her shadow pooling into the holes like ink. <words>180</words>  
By midday, saplings clawed through the fog, their bark glistening with metallic veins—a forest of living armor. <words>199</words>  
The gods noticed. <words>201</words>  
Thunder growled as Marisol hammered a sapling’s pliable trunk into a sword, its edge singing with the orchard’s forgotten sweetness. <words>224</words>  
Postcard three arrived pinned to a stray dog’s collar: *“A crown for the unyielding, tempered by starlight and spite.”* <words>245</words>  
She worked the bellows, sweat mingling with fog, forging a circlet of brambles and iron blooms—a thing both delicate and vicious. <words>268</words>  
When lightning split the sky, she laughed, wearing the crown askew as she paraded through the ruins, her shadow stretching defiantly long. <words>293</words>  
The gods sent hailstones shaped like eyes. <words>299</words>  
Marisol sheltered beneath her creations, the armored trees clanging in the storm like discordant bells. <words>318</words>  
The final postcard fluttered into the forge’s fire, unburned: *“They fear remembrance. Make them see.”* <words>336</words>  
At twilight, she plunged the sword into the anvil, fissures racing through the ground, exhuming buried roots that wove into a lattice above the district. <words>362</words>  
The fog dissolved, revealing a canopy of glowing apples—each fruit a preserved memory of mortal joy the gods had tried to erase. <words>385</words>  
Marisol bit into one, the taste of her husband’s blackberry jam flooding her tongue, sharp and sweet as rebellion. <words>405</words>  
The heavens roared, but the orchard hummed, tethered by hope and a widow’s stubborn playfulness, its roots now too deep to drown. <words>429</words>  
Between meals, the district remembered itself, and the gods, for the first time in eternity, hesitated. <words>447</words>
