<story>The sneering envoy stood beneath the domed vineyard’s glass ribs, his gloved fingers brushing a folded note tucked in his coat—a relic of paper trails leading to truths too luminous to bury. <words>34</words> Outside, the barren alien plain stretched like a scabbed wound under twin moons, but here, vines coiled in furious tranquility, their leaves trembling as if whispering secrets to the air. <words>73</words> He had come to sift through more than soil. <words>84</words> The greenhouse, its panes cracked and veiled in dust, swirled with autumn’s ghosts: dead leaves spiraled in eddies, catching the envoy’s gaze like fragments of a scattered codex. <words>116</words> “Pathetic,” he muttered, though his pulse quickened—starlight cupped in mortal palms required more than arrogance; it demanded the precision of a thief. <words>143</words>  

A glint beneath a fern’s withered frond revealed another note, its creases sharp as betrayal. <words>159</words> He unfolded it, deciphering coordinates etched in ultraviolet ink—another breadcrumb on this rambling destiny’s path. <words>178</words> The vineyard’s owner, long vanished, had hidden their celestial harvest here, bottling constellations in grape-skin and fermenting comet tails. <words>200</words> But greed had curdled the dream; now only the envoy remained, parsing lies from legacy. <words>218</words>  

Wind hissed through a broken pane, scattering leaves anew. <words>226</words> He crouched, gloves peeling back to expose palms calloused by centuries of stolen light. <words>240</words> The act felt sacrilegious, yet necessary—how else to cradle infinity without burning? <words>254</words> His sneer softened as he pressed a hand to the greenhouse floor, feeling vibrations hum through the roots: a pulse, faint but insistent, like a possibility gasping its first breath. <words>284</words>  

Three more notes surfaced—beneath a rusted trowel, wedged in a terracotta shard, coiled inside a snail’s fossilized shell. <words>302</words> Each bore fragments of a ritual, a way to distill starlight into something drinkable, survivable. <words>319</words> The envoy’s laugh was a dry rasp. <words>326</words> “Poets and fools,” he spat, yet his hands trembled as he arranged the papers into a map. <words>343</words> The dome’s apex loomed above, its glass smeared with ancient rain, and there, in the center of the vineyard’s labyrinth, a stone basin waited, its hollow brimming with black water. <words>374</words>  

Midnight approached, the twin moons aligning to cast overlapping shadows—a key, perhaps, or a blade. <words>391</words> The envoy emptied his pockets: notes, a vial of mercury, a thorn stolen from a witch’s crown. <words>408</words> He recited the incantation, voice fraying as syllables knotted his tongue. <words>422</words> The water shivered, then ignited, liquid flame rising in a column that fractured into strands—a thousand threads of captured starlight, each singing a note older than blood. <words>454</words>  

He reached, palms upturned, and the light pooled there, cool and impossible, a galaxy condensed to a heartbeat’s weight. <words>475</words> For a moment, his sneer vanished, replaced by something like reverence—or terror. <words>489</words> But the dome shuddered, glass groaning as the alien plain outside began to crack, reality unraveling where mortal hands held what should only fall. <words>518</words> The envoy smiled, sharp and final, as the world dissolved into stardust and thirst. <words>534</words></story>
