<story>The Dark Matter Diner hummed between rides, its neon sign flickering like a dying star.<words>17</words>  
General Veyra slumped into a vinyl booth, his medals clinking against the table where a plate of dried seaweed curled like forgotten battle plans.<words>42</words>  
“Anxiety special,” said the waitress, her voice a rasp of mischievous wisdom as she slid a folder of black-and-white photographs toward him.<words>70</words>  
The diner’s walls pulsed with dark matter—a substance that made reason shiver and memories bleed into the air like ink.<words>93</words>  
Veyra’s calloused fingers traced the arcs in the photos: soldiers laughing as their shadows unraveled, a child balancing a crown of static, a bridge dissolving mid-stride.<words>119</words>  
“Fear’s a tyrant,” the waitress muttered, refilling his mug with liquid starlight.<words>134</words>  
“And you serve seaweed to dethrone it?” He scoffed, but the brittle leaves crackled with a scent like salted courage.<words>155</words>  
The photographs shifted, revealing his own face among them—eyes hollow, commanding troops who marched into fractal storms.<words>174</words>  
Shared anxieties pooled in the room: whispers of mutiny, the weight of unsent letters, the rationally absurd certainty that every choice was both vital and futile.<words>200</words>  
“Renewal’s not a parade,” the waitress said, tapping a photo where a moth gnawed at a general’s epaulets.<words>219</words>  
Veyra swallowed a strand of seaweed; it tasted of tidal graves and stubborn hope.<words>234</words>  
The dark matter thickened, stitching his regrets into the diner’s fabric.<words>246</words>  
In the photos now, his men planted flags in collapsing trenches, their grins sharp as shattered mirrors.<words>263</words>  
“You’ve let fear rent space in your skull,” the waitress chided, her apron smeared with cosmic dust.<words>282</words>  
He gripped the table, the absurdity crashing over him—how had he bargained with terror while leading armies through supernovas?<words>304</words>  
The seaweed’s salt fused with starlight on his tongue, a catalyst.<words>317</words>  
Veyra stood, his shadow stretching into the photographs, mending fractures in their arcs.<words>331</words>  
Soldiers paused mid-stride to salute; the child’s crown sparked auroras.<words>343</words>  
“Reason’s no throne room,” the waitress murmured, her grin a crescent knife.<words>357</words>  
Dark matter coiled around his ribs, not as chains, but as a compass.<words>372</words>  
He tossed coins onto the counter—payment in dead empires’ currency.<words>384</words>  
Outside, the cosmos yawned between rides, vast and unafraid.<words>395</words>  
Veyra inhaled, his lungs full of borrowed courage, and stepped into the pulse of unfinished wars.<words>412</words>  
The diner’s neon winked out, its purpose served.<words>420</words>  
In his pocket, a single photograph remained: a general kneeling, planting seaweed in cracked soil, while shadows bloomed into bridges.<words>442</words>  
Somewhere, fear coughed on its own crown.<words>450</words>
