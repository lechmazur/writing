The peculiar collector adjusted her cracked spectacles, her infuriatingly calm fingers tracing the grooves of an old pencil stub lodged in the Probability Mapping Center’s central console. <words>27</words>  
Around her hummed walls of liquid crystal, each panel flickering with timelines—possible births of stars, extinct languages resurrected, talents buried like fossils across millennia. <words>52</words>  
She’d spent seven lifetimes here, tweaking variables to unearth those dormant gifts, but the Council had grown impatient. <words>68</words>  
“Your obsession with *potential* is destabilizing the continuum,” they’d said, unaware she’d already found the key: a cipher hidden in the piano bench beneath Mozart’s childhood fortepiano. <words>93</words>  
Its ivory keys, arranged in a dissonant sequence only she’d noticed, now glowed faintly in her satchel. <words>107</words>  

The console beeped—a warning. <words>109</words>  
They were coming to decommission her. <words>113</words>  
Her pencil stub trembled as she slotted Mozart’s middle C key into the console’s core, its edges aligning with grooves only a collector of fractured grace would recognize. <words>133</words>  
The Center’s lights dimmed; probabilities bled into the air like ink. <words>143</words>  
She whispered names: a 12th-century seamstress who’d woven calculus into tapestries, a mute boy from 2145 whose sculptures could cure grief. <words>160</words>  
Each syllable etched itself into the pencil’s lead, sharpening it into a blade. <words>170</words>  

Boots echoed in the corridor. <words>172</words>  
The collector pressed the pencil tip against the key, her breath steady. <words>181</words>  
To the Council, history was a ledger; to her, a symphony missing its crescendo. <words>192</words>  
The first codebreaker’s rifle appeared at the door as she struck the key, unleashing a chord that unraveled the room’s geometry. <words>209</words>  
Walls became forests of equations; floors dissolved into rivers of half-lived lives. <words>220</words>  
“You’re too late,” she said, her voice a calm fissure in the chaos. <words>230</words>  

The codebreakers faltered, their weapons glitching into violins, their armor blooming with origami swallows. <words>243</words>  
The collector walked through them, trailing stardust and sonatas, her pencil carving doorways into eras where forgotten geniuses waited. <words>258</words>  
In 304 BCE, Archimedes’ sister grasped the lever she’d drawn in ash. <words>268</words>  
In 2087, a janitor deciphered her equations on a subway wall and cured time fever. <words>280</words>  
The Center’s collapse accelerated, but she smiled—true maps were never static. <words>291</words>  

As the last timeline ignited, the collector sat at the fortepiano, its restored keys threading her heartbeat into the fugue. <words>306</words>  
The Council found only her pencil stub, its tip embedded in a final note: *Listen for the buried.* <words>320</words>  
Centuries later, a child in the ruins would pocket it, humming a melody that rebuilt cities. <words>333</words>  
And in the silence between probabilities, the collector’s laugh lingered—a quiet, unyielding stand etched into the arithmetic of wind. <words>349</words>  

But this is not where it ends. <words>353</words>  
In a vault beneath what was once Vienna, the piano bench remains, its keys still warm. <words>366</words>  
A new peculiar collector kneels, decoding their arrangement with an old pencil stub. <words>378</words>  
She tweaks a variable, her infuriating calm mirroring her predecessor’s. <words>388</words>  
The air shivers. <words>390</words>  
Somewhere, a buried talent takes its first breath. <words>397</words>  
And the map of possibilities, fractured yet luminous, begins again. <words>407</words>
