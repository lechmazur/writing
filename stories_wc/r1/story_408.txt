The hanging orchard clung to the ravine’s steep walls like a spider’s web, its gnarled branches heavy with storm-bruised apples. <words>25</words> Elias Pike, a conscientious objector whose hands still trembled at the memory of refused rifles, traced migration routes in his notebook, ink smudged by drizzle. <words>47</words> He’d returned to Hollow’s Bend after the war, trading barracks for the neighborhood watch—a role as valiantly boring as counting crows. <words>71</words> Every autumn, craft fairs swarmed the valley, and with them, his family’s tradition: nailing a rusted iron spike into the oldest apple tree to “ward off rot.” <words>99</words> This year, the nail felt heavier. <words>105</words>  

“Xenial duty calls,” muttered Mrs. Voss, the watch captain, her smile sharp as she handed him a lantern. <words>125</words> The orchard was her domain, its creaking limbs a stage for her coy malevolence. <words>138</words> Elias suspected the migration maps mattered more than anyone admitted; storms had scattered birds into strange paths, and the watch eyed every outlier. <words>160</words> Last week, he’d found a grackle pinned to the tree with a rusty nail. <words>174</words> A warning, or a ritual? <words>178</words>  

At the harvest fair, children bobbed for apples while elders traded honey and lies. <words>193</words> Elias lingered by the tree, its trunk studded with decades of nails. <words>206</words> His grandfather had called it “keeping roots,” but the roots were strangling the ravine now. <words>222</words> When a stranger in a mud-splattered coat asked about the maps, Elias hesitated. <words>237</words> The man’s accent curled like smoke—foreign, fleeting. <words>248</words> Mrs. Voss appeared, honey-sweet, steering the man toward cider. <words>261</words> Later, Elias found his notebook gone. <words>268</words>  

That night, the storm hit like a siege. <words>275</words> Elias climbed the orchard, lantern guttering, and found Mrs. Voss kneeling at the tree, her hands bloody. <words>293</words> The stranger lay motionless, a nail driven through his palm. <words>305</words> “Rot spreads,” she said, “if you don’t prune it early.” <words>317</words> The migration routes, he realized—they weren’t for birds. <words>328</words> They were borders. <words>330</words>  

He lunged for the nail, its rust teeth biting his palm. <words>341</words> The tree groaned as wind tore through branches, apples plummeting into the dark. <words>355</words> Elias swung the spike like a blade he’d never wielded, shattering the lantern. <words>369</words> Flames raced up the trunk, igniting decades of iron and sap. <words>382</words> Mrs. Voss screamed, but the fire was a wilder watchman, devouring maps and lies alike. <words>399</words>  

By dawn, the orchard was ash, the ravine a charcoal scar. <words>411</words> Elias walked the craft fair road, his burned hand clutching the nail. <words>424</words> Let them come, he thought, counting the first geese overhead. <words>436</words> He’d map their flight, one honest line at a time. <words>447</words>
