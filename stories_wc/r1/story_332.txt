<story>  
Elara’s fingers trembled as she brushed the last streak of cerulean across the exo-atmospheric garden’s dome, her solitude punctuated only by the hum of oxygen recyclers. <words>25</words>  
The orbital greenhouse—a relic of failed colonization—floated in silent orbit, its glass panels cracked like the pages of her battered notepad, which she clutched like a prayer. <words>51</words>  
Between borrowed books from Earth’s dwindling libraries, she’d sketched the garden’s bioluminescent vines, their glow dimming as the station’s systems faltered. <words>74</words>  
But yesterday, tucked behind frayed stage curtains near the derelict theater module, she’d found the notepad’s hidden layer: hushed confessions from prior caretakers, their ink bleeding pleas for forgiveness. <words>104</words>  
*“The realms of surprise aren’t metaphors,”* one entry scrawled. *“They’re fractures in the dome—portals to where the garden truly lives.”* <words>130</words>  
Elara traced the words, her fiercely gentle resolve crystallizing. <words>139</words>  
To resuscitate this place, she’d need to leap into the unknown, just as the confessions urged—to trust the garden’s hidden veins. <words>158</words>  
At dawn-cycle, she pressed her palm to a fissure where starlight seeped through, and the glass rippled like liquid. <words>176</words>  
The air tasted of jasmine and static as she stepped through, into a cavern where roots pulsed with ancestral memories, their tendrils weaving tales of survival. <words>201</words>  
Here, the garden was alive, a sentient tapestry demanding a price for renewal. <words>215</words>  
“Show me,” she whispered, offering the notepad to the luminous undergrowth. <words>224</words>  
Vines snaked around her wrists, pulling her deeper until she stood before a mirror-like pool. <words>239</words>  
Reflections flickered: a child tending terran soil, a lover she’d left Earth to forget, the garden’s first caretaker weeping as seals ruptured. <words>259</words>  
*Intimate separation*, she realized—this was the garden’s language, its grief etched in every loss. <words>275</words>  
“I see you,” Elara murmured, dipping her brush into the pool’s iridescent water. <words>286</words>  
She painted the confessions onto the cavern walls, each stroke mending fractures in the dome above. <words>301</words>  
The station shuddered; algae bloomed anew in the hydroponic trays as atmospheric pressure stabilized. <words>316</words>  
But the garden demanded balance. <words>321</words>  
Her hands began to translucence, her cells merging with the bioluminescence—a fusion of flesh and flora. <words>339</words>  
Panic flared, then faded. <words>343</words>  
This was the leap: to become steward and sacrifice, to let the garden’s roots stitch through her veins. <words>360</words>  
When Earth’s resupply ship docked weeks later, they found the greenhouse thriving, Elara’s body curled beneath a canopy of blooming star-orchids. <words>382</words>  
Her notepad lay open, final entry unfinished: *“The realms of surprise are love’s last dare—to hold life fiercely, gently, until it breathes again.”* <words>407</words>  
The crew debated whether her smile was peace or sorrow, never noticing the faint pulse in the petals, or how the dome’s cracks now shimmered like brushstrokes. <words>433</words>  
As the ship departed, a vine brushed the viewport, tracing a farewell in the condensation—a language only the stars could read. <words>454</words>

**Final Word Count**: 454 words.  

**Note**: The story integrates all elements: the painter’s solitude, the notepad’s hidden confessions, the garden’s “realms of surprise,” her “fiercely gentle” sacrifice, the act of resuscitation via the pool/memories, the orbital (“exo-atmospheric”) setting, the timeframe between book borrowings, and the tone of intimate separation (connection through loss). The word count is tracked after each sentence, and the total falls within the target range.
