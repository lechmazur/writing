The abandoned spaceport baggage claim echoed with fractal sorrow, its fractured ceiling panels casting geometric shadows over Captain Elara Vey as she knelt beside her flying library’s cracked fuel core. <words>30</words> Her gloved fingers brushed the detached coat button in her pocket—her late mentor’s final gift, its edges worn smooth by decades of anxious friction. <words>56</words> Tradition demanded she obliterate the library’s archives tonight, lest its spiritually secular texts—poems sutured from star maps, psalms decoded from comet tails—fall into militarized hands. <words>88</words> But the button’s weight whispered otherwise. <words>94</words>  

She brewed bitter aster-tea in a dented thermos, her breath fogging the cold air as she poured the dregs onto a cargo manifest. <words>118</words> The stains pooled into a shape: a bridge arching between colliding galaxies, its keystone a single button. <words>136</words> “Unity,” she murmured, recalling how her mentor read futures in coffee stains, decoding cosmic will through earthly accidents. <words>155</words> The vision demanded she fly the library through the derelict docking ring—a suicide run through collapsing wormholes—to deliver the archives to the fractured Council of Orion. <words>183</words> But the fuel core’s death rattle said no. <words>191</words>  

A voice crackled through her wristcomm: “Scrap the relics, Vey. Confirm.” <words>201</words> The second stretched, elastic and infinite. <words>207</words> Yes would preserve nothing; no would ignite civil war. <words>215</words> Her thumb found the button’s central groove—the old man’s fingerprint still etched there—and the library’s AI suddenly flared awake, projecting a hologram of the docking ring. <words>244</words> “Route viable,” it intoned, “if you jettison life support.” <words>255</words>  

Elara laughed, the sound sharp as shattered glass. <words>262</words> Of course: the bridge required sacrifice. <words>268</words> She input the coordinates, severed the oxygen lines, and strapped into the pilot’s chair as the engines screamed. <words>286</words> G-forces crushed her chest as they pierced the wormhole, the library’s ancient hull groaning like a dying beast. <words>305</words> Through the viewport, she watched the button float upward, suspended in zero-g—a planet unmoored, a covenant kept. <words>326</words>  

The Council’s ships swarmed to meet them, their comms blazing with relief and recrimination. <words>340</words> Elara didn’t hear. <words>343</words> Her lungs burned, her vision tunneling as the AI auto-ejected the archives in their indestructible capsules. <words>360</words> The last thing she saw was the button settling gently onto the control panel, its shadow merging with the coffee-stain bridge—complete at last. <words>384</words>  

They found her body curled around the empty thermos, lips frozen in something between a smile and a scream. <words>402</words> But the archives survived. <words>406</words> Centuries later, pilgrims place buttons on her asteroid memorial, each one a wordless prayer for bridges built in impossible seconds. <words>430</words>
