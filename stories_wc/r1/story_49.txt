The lukewarm mage traced the frayed edge of the torn doormat corner, its threads whispering of Earth’s gravity, now lost to the sterile halls of the lunar base.<words>34</words> His loyally peculiar habit of carrying the relic—a fragment from his childhood porch—clung to him like the echoes he could never silence.<words>63</words> Beyond the observation dome, swirling stage fog billowed, conjuring ephemeral silhouettes that danced like ghosts in the ashen light of cratered plains.<words>91</words> They were memories made tangible, fragments of voices and faces he’d buried beneath his bootsoles.<words>107</words>  

Tonight, the clash would come.<words>113</words> Not with blades or spells, but with the specters only he could see.<words>128</words> The base’s commander had ordered the fog machines dismantled, declaring them “distractions,” but the mage had smuggled one into the airlock chamber.<words>157</words> Fear, he knew, was a stain no lunar scrubber could erase—unless he painted over it first.<words>177</words>  

He knelt, the doormat’s fabric prickling his palm, and exhaled a charm that tasted of burnt honey.<words>195</words> The fog responded, coiling into shapes: his mother’s hands braiding his sister’s hair, his father’s laugh smothered by hospital walls, the crackle of wildfires that had charred his hometown to serenity.<words>232</words> Each silhouette flickered, demanding he mourn anew.<words>241</words> But the mage steadied his breath.<words>246</words> This time, he would not flinch.<words>251</words>  

A knock echoed.<words>254</words> The journal lay unopened on his desk, its pages blank since the evacuation.<words>267</words> He’d promised to document their “new beginning,” yet every entry bled into ash.<words>283</words> The knock came again—sharp, impatient.<words>290</words> Commander Veyra, no doubt, here to confiscate his fog machine.<words>303</words>  

“One moment,” he called, voice fraying like the doormat’s edge.<words>316</words> The fog thickened, birthing a final silhouette: himself, older, kneeling not in grief but planting saplings in regolith, their roots clawing through fear.<words>343</words> The vision wavered as Veyra’s code-override hissed against the door.<words>357</words>  

The mage tore a thread from the doormat and tied it around the fog machine’s valve.<words>375</words> “Stay,” he murmured, and the spell took hold—a loyally peculiar anchor.<words>389</words> The door slid open.<words>393</words> Veyra froze, her reflection caught in the swirling tableau: past and future, loss and growth, each silhouette a brushstroke in the mural he’d dared to paint.<words>426</words>  

“You… see them too,” she whispered, her defiance crumbling like lunar dust.<words>440</words>  

He offered the journal.<words>443</words> “Write your own echo.”<words>447</words>  

Outside, the fog curled into dawn’s first light, its shadows no longer phantoms but blueprints.<words>465</words>
