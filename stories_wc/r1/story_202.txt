The Found Object Museum’s marble halls hummed with dusty starlight, their vaulted ceilings veined by moonlight slipping through cracked skylights. <words>28</words>  
Lila coasted her skateboard past glass cases of fractured teacups and fossilized feathers, her wheels echoing like a metronome counting down to something inevitable. <words>53</words>  
She’d come to test the edges of gravity—to ollie over the museum’s disintegrating mosaics and grind the brass railings flanking the Hall of Forgotten Blades. <words>76</words>  
But the rapier stopped her: an elegant 17th-century weapon displayed askew, its hilt cracked like a spider’s web, a slip of parchment tucked beneath the blade. <words>103</words>  
*Authenticate me*, the note demanded, the handwriting spidery yet urgent, and Lila’s gloved fingers trembled—not from fear, but the code of instinct that had guided her since childhood, a compass needle swinging toward danger. <words>137</words>  
The scavenger hunt began with a vial hidden inside a taxidermied owl’s hollow beak, its label inked in Latin: *Aconitum napellus*. <words>157</words>  
Monkshood. <words>158</words>  
Lila, a careful poisoner by necessity (her mother’s slow death had taught her precision), recognized the dosage—enough to paralyze, not kill. <words>180</words>  
She pocketed it, guilt fluttering innocently in her chest; poison was a language she’d never wanted to speak, but fluency had become survival. <words>203</words>  
Clues led her through the museum’s labyrinth: a lockpick concealed in a music box playing Chopin’s *Funeral March*, a cipher etched into a rusted sundial’s shadow. <words>229</words>  
Each step synced with her skateboard’s rhythm, wheels carving arcs as she navigated stairs and ramps, the rapier’s purpose crystallizing. <words>249</words>  
It was a key, not a weapon. <words>254</words>  
The final clue glowed inside a bioluminescent jellyfish jar: *Break the hilt where the fault line converges*. <words>274</words>  
Lila hesitated, then slammed the rapier’s pommel against the museum’s iron banister. <words>287</words>  
The crack splintered further, revealing a hollow chamber cradling a silver locket. <words>298</words>  
Inside, a portrait of a woman with Lila’s storm-gray eyes stared back, the inscription whispering *Forgive me*. <words>315</words>  
Her throat tightened. <words>317</words>  
The hunt wasn’t about authentication—it was an apology. <words>326</words>  
Her mother, the museum’s late curator, had orchestrated this posthumous confession: she’d engineered her own poisoning, sparing Lila the sin of mercy. <words>350</words>  
Innocently guilty, Lila had spent years believing her antidote attempts had failed. <words>363</words>  
Now, gravity shifted. <words>366</words>  
She kickflipped off the museum’s mezzanine, the locket pressed to her ribs, and for the first time, the air felt weightless. <words>385</words>  
The rapier’s fracture had sealed itself, the blade gleaming as if newly forged, and Lila understood—some breaks were meant to mend what words could not. <words>408</words>  
Rolling into the moonlit courtyard, she unscrewed the monkshood vial and poured it onto the soil, where it pooled like liquid starlight before sinking into the earth, harmless at last. <words>436</words>
