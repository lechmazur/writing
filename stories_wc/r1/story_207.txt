The universe hummed its secret song as Jax, a forthright peddler with a reputation for trading truths sharper than blades, knelt in the abandoned space station’s medical bay. <words>30</words> Before him lay a dried flower bouquet, its petals brittle as forgotten promises, and a stack of rumor-laden gossip columns splayed across a rusted surgical table. <words>60</words> He’d sworn a blood oath never to return here—to this graveyard of his failures—but redemption’s path demanded he break it. <words>88</words>  

“Meekly assertive,” his late mentor had called him, a contradiction that now defined his mission: to divide the lies poisoning the galaxy from the truths buried beneath. <words>118</words> The gossip sheets whispered of a traitor who’d sabotaged the station’s oxygen filters, condemning thousands. <words>138</words> Jax knew the real culprit—himself. <words>143</words> The flowers, plucked from his sister’s graveworld, were both apology and compass. <words>156</words>  

As he sifted through headlines, a name surfaced—Lira Vey, a medic presumed dead, now spotted alive. <words>175</words> His hands trembled. <words>177</words> Lira had been his accomplice, his confidante, until he’d let her take the blame. <words>191</words> The medical bay’s fractured viewport revealed the cosmos outside, its indifferent glow a mirror to his joyful loneliness. <words>211</words> He’d always found solace in solitude, but tonight, it tasted like ash. <words>225</words>  

A clang echoed. <words>227</words> Lira stood in the doorway, her face half-shadowed by a respirator, eyes blazing with betrayal. <words>244</words> “You swore silence,” she hissed, gripping a bone saw. <words>255</words> Jax raised the bouquet, its scentless blooms a plea. <words>266</words> “I’m here to undo the oath. <words>272</words> To divide the guilt I forced you to carry.” <words>282</words>  

She laughed bitterly. <words>284</words> “You think flowers absolve you?” <words>290</words> “No,” he said, meek yet unyielding. <words>297</words> “But these rumors do. <words>300</words> They prove you survived. <words>304</words> Let me confess—through every gossip channel, until the galaxy knows your name isn’t a curse.” <words>324</words>  

Lira’s resolve wavered. <words>326</words> The station shuddered, its dying systems harmonizing with the universe’s hum. <words>339</words> Jax pressed a dried chrysanthemum into her palm, its stem snapping like the oath between them. <words>356</words> “I’ll trade every secret I’ve sold to clear yours,” he said. <words>370</words> “Even if it ruins me.” <words>376</words>  

Silence stretched, thin as stardust. <words>382</words> Then Lira lowered the saw. <words>387</words> “Start talking,” she muttered, nodding at the gossip sheets. <words>398</words> Together, they carved the truth into the columns, their words severing the past’s chokehold. <words>415</words>  

As dawn’s artificial glow seeped into the bay, Jax felt the weight lift—not all at once, but petal by petal. <words>436</words> Redemption, he realized, wasn’t a destination, but the act of breaking what should never have been bound. <words>456</words> The universe kept humming, and for the first time, he hummed back. <words>471</words>  

Lira left without farewell, her shadow merging with the stars. <words>482</words> Jax remained, clutching the bouquet, its dryness now a testament to resilience. <words>496</words> Joyful loneliness, indeed. <words>500</words>
