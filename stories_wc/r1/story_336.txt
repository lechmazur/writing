<story>The hush after the car’s backfire clung to the street like cobwebs, its silence thicker than the dust veiling the ancient Persian palace’s cracked domes. <words>30</words>  
Inside, the weary undertaker traced the astronomical clock’s brass constellations, her calloused fingers memorizing grooves worn smooth by centuries of guardians who’d whispered the same tribal truth: time was a cage, and the sun’s path its key. <words>70</words>  
The knowledge, passed through generations of her lineage, was rarely practical—until tonight. <words>85</words>  
Shadows pooled in the palace’s marrow, alive and hungry, seeping from the morgue’s iron door where the last corpse had screamed before dissolving into the dark. <words>111</words>  
They’d called it a power outage, but she knew better. <words>119</words>  
The thing beneath the palace had awakened. <words>125</words>  

Her grandfather’s voice haunted her: *“To imprison it, follow the sun paths etched in the clock’s heart—not with eyes, but breath.”* <words>148</words>  
Moonlight bled through the stained-glass oculus, fracturing into emerald and sapphire shards across the clockface. <words>163</words>  
She exhaled slowly, fogging the zodiac engravings, and the mechanism shuddered. <words>174</words>  
Gears ground like broken teeth, aligning to a configuration last touched when the palace was young—a labyrinth of celestial calculus meant to bend light into chains. <words>200</words>  
The shadows recoiled, hissing. <words>203</words>  

Dawn was hours away, but the clock demanded solar reckoning. <words>213</words>  
She gripped the pendulum, its weight familiar as a shroud, and began swinging it counter to time’s flow. <words>229</words>  
Each arc carved a phantom sun path into the air, golden threads weaving a net over the morgue’s threshold. <words>245</words>  
The darkness writhed, slamming against the flickering strands. <words>254</words>  
“You’ll hold,” she murmured, not to the light, but to herself. <words>265</words>  

Tribal knowledge had no room for doubt. <words>271</words>  
Her ancestors had buried this creature under rituals and stone, yet here she stood—a chain-smoking, sleep-starved woman in a moth-eaten coat—repeating verses older than scripture. <words>299</words>  
The clock’s hands accelerated, burning her palms as they spun into a blur of hours. <words>313</words>  
Outside, the street remained silent, frozen in the car’s interrupted roar. <words>325</words>  
Time, she realized, was holding its breath. <words>332</words>  

When the pendulum stilled, the net glowed incandescent. <words>341</words>  
The shadows shrieked, collapsing into a single writhing mass before imploding into the clock’s core. <words>357</words>  
The palace exhaled. <words>359</words>  
Dawn’s first light pierced the oculus, igniting the clockface, and for a heartbeat, the undertaker saw her grandfather’s face in the gears—smiling, but weary, always weary. <words>384</words>  

She slumped against the wall, nicotine-stained fingers trembling. <words>393</words>  
The dark was sealed, yet no lighter in her pocket could dispel the chill in her bones. <words>408</words>  
Tribal knowledge rarely practical, hope rarely logical. <words>415</words>  
But as long as the sun paths turned, so would she. <words>424</words>  
The street outside remained silent, waiting for the next backfire. <words>434</words></story>
