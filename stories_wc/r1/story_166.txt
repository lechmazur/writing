<story>  
The frozen orchard breathed, its skeletal apple trees crackling with ice as geothermal streams coiled beneath their roots like serpents guarding warmth. <words>27</words>  
Here, where winter never thawed, lingered the ghostly caretaker—a translucent figure named Wisp, whose solemn duty clashed eternally with his penchant for balancing spoons on his nose. <words>55</words>  
His last wish—to hear the orchard’s marmots gossip—had been granted a century ago, leaving him adrift in a world where animals remained stubbornly mute. <words>83</words>  
But today, Wisp clutched a plastic straw stolen from a camper’s discarded juice box, its bendy neck wobbling as he recited incantations from forbidden expedition logs. <words>112</words>  
The logs, scribbled by a doomed botanist, insisted that perforating the ice above the largest geothermal vent would “weave through fate’s threads” and unravel animal speech. <words>141</words>  
“Solemnly silly,” Wisp muttered, plunging the straw into the ice, which hissed and splintered like a thousand sugar cubes. <words>160</words>  
A geyser erupted, drenching him in warm mineral spray—and suddenly, the orchard chattered. <words>176</words>  
Pine martens debated berry tariffs, crows heckled his spoon-balancing, and the streams themselves burbled complaints about “rocky mattresses.” <words>196</words>  
Chaos, Wisp decided, was gentler when it wore feathers. <words>206</words>  
But the logs had omitted a critical detail: piercing the vent also perforated time. <words>220</words>  
Memories flooded in—the botanist’s frostbitten fingers, her desperate wish to save the orchard, her ghost becoming his. <words>239</words>  
They’d both been weaving the same fate, separated by centuries, united by straws and stubbornness. <words>254</words>  
Now, as marmots demanded he mediate a dispute over stolen lichen, Wisp grasped the truth: communication required listening. <words>274</words>  
He floated to the oldest tree, its trunk split by a stream, and pressed his ear to its icy bark. <words>293</words>  
The tree groaned, its voice slow as glaciers. <words>301</words>  
“You’ve been watering us with wishes,” it rumbled. <words>311</words>  
“Roots need silence too.” <words>317</words>  
Wisp’s spoons clattered to the ground. <words>323</words>  
He spent days transcribing the animals’ cacophony into the logs, his handwriting overlapping the botanist’s like a duet. <words>343</words>  
When the geothermal streams slowed, he plugged leaks with straws, humming lullabies to the disgruntled earth. <words>361</words>  
The orchard, nourished by chaos and care, blossomed with ice apples that glowed like lanterns. <words>379</words>  
Marmots nibbled them, their cheeks flashing neon, while crows dropped the fruits to watch them shatter into light. <words>398</words>  
Wisp, now more prank than phantom, balanced spoons on their heads. <words>412</words>  
The logs closed with his final entry: “Fate isn’t woven—it’s mended, stitch by absurd stitch, with whatever straws you’ve got.” <words>435</words>  
And when the next wishless caretaker arrived, they’d find the trees still humming, the streams still gossiping, and a plastic straw lodged eternally in the ice—solemnly silly, and perfectly perforated. <words>469</words>
