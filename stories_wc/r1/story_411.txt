Beneath the earth’s crust, where roots braided with constellations, the sentient car mechanic known as Gear knelt in the subterranean orchard, her wrench humming a dirge as she tuned the mechanical trees. <words>34</words> Their silver leaves, etched with glyphs of forgotten engines, shivered as the underground river of stars flowed beneath them, its currents carrying whispers she ached to decipher. <words>73</words> She adjusted her vintage opera glasses—brass lenses cracked like spiderwebs—and peered into the park fountain at the orchard’s heart, where puzzle pieces swirled like fractured memories. <words>110</words> They were fragments of confessions, unsaid words lodged in throats now dust; to gather them, she had to sort truths from the lies they wore as skins. <words>144</words>  

Gear’s fingers, jointed with rusted bolts, plunged into the water. <words>156</words> Each retrieved piece hissed a syllable: *I regret—* *I stole—* *I loved—*, voices repulsively attractive, honeyed yet cloying, like roses rotting in gasoline. <words>191</words> She studied their edges, matching sin to sorrow, guilt to grief, while the orchard’s gears groaned overhead. <words>212</words> Infinity stretched here—not as endless time, but as a looped breath, a sigh that never faded. <words>230</words> She’d chosen this duty centuries ago, when her own confession had lodged in her throat, unspoken, and festered. <words>248</words>  

A puzzle fragment glinted—a man’s final apology to a daughter he’d abandoned. <words>261</words> Gear slotted it into place, and the fountain’s waters flared. <words>271</words> The orchard trembled; star-river currents quickened, nourishing the trees until their branches sagged with luminescent fruit. <words>289</words> Exultant grief swelled in her chest: this was the work—suturing broken truths to let life rot and bloom anew. <words>309</words> Yet with every mended confession, her own unvoiced words thickened, metallic on her tongue. <words>324</words>  

“Why do you persist?” rumbled the orchard’s oldest tree, its trunk a labyrinth of pistons. <words>341</words> Gear rotated her opera glasses, focusing on a puzzle piece shaped like a wrench—her wrench, the one she’d thrown at her brother’s skull the night he died mid-sentence. <words>369</words> “Because silence is the only sin that outlives infinity,” she said. <words>382</words> The fountain’s next fragment bore her brother’s voice: *I’m sorry I never told you—* <words>398</words>  

She hesitated. <words>399</words> To hear it would dissolve her purpose; to ignore it would calcify her gears. <words>412</words> The star river roared. <words>415</words> Gear slotted the piece. <words>418</words>  

His confession unfurled—not an apology, but a plea: *Listen to your own.* <words>432</words> The orchard stilled. <words>435</words> In the sudden quiet, Gear’s unsaid words tore free: “I wanted you to stay.” <words>446</words> The river sighed, the trees shed light like tears, and the mechanic, for the first time, let the fragments rest. <words>467</words> Aboveground, clocks remained frozen; here, in infinity’s grasp, something began—and ended—whole. <words>484</words>
