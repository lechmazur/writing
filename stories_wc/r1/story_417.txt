The Victorian parlor, its velvet drapes moth-eaten and its mahogany shelves warped by jungle humidity, housed Brother Silas’s *theoretically playful* obsession: a plain metal bottle cap. <words>34</words>  
“A relic of divine folly,” he hissed, pacing between taxidermied toucans, his unhinged zealot’s gaze fixed on the rusted trinket displayed atop a velvet cushion. <words>65</words>  
Eleanor, his reluctant pupil, scribbled notes—*during studying*—on his sermons, her ink smudging as sweat dripped from her brow. <words>85</words>  
Their *unspoken agreements* were simple: she’d humor his madness; he’d pretend not to notice her trembling hands. <words>100</words>  
“Tonight,” Silas crooned, “we *uproot* the lies festering in our souls,” and flung open a trapdoor hidden beneath the Persian rug. <words>118</words>  
Eleanor descended into a root-choked cellar, where candlelight revealed walls papered with botanical sketches—all crossed out in red ink. <words>136</words>  
Silas pressed the bottle cap into her palm. “Confess what weakens you,” he demanded, his breath reeking of overstepped tea. <words>153</words>  
*Strength in vulnerability*, she recalled his mantra, though his grin resembled a jackal’s. <words>165</words>  
“I…” Her *whispered confession in the dark room* began—how she’d forged her botanical credentials, how the jungle’s whispers kept her awake. <words>185</words>  
Silas snatched the cap back. “Pathetic!” he spat, yet his eyes glistened. <words>195</words>  
A vine crashed through the ceiling, snaking toward the relic—as if the jungle itself contested his delusions. <words>210</words>  
Eleanor lunged, seizing the cap, its edges biting her flesh. <words>219</words>  
Silas wailed, “Heresy!” as she hurled it into the writhing roots, which recoiled like scorched serpents. <words>234</words>  
The parlor shuddered; porcelain shepherdesses toppled as the floorboards splintered. <words>244</words>  
“You’ve killed us!” Silas screeched, yet Eleanor laughed—*earnest absurdity* ringing louder than his despair. <words>259</words>  
The roots retreated, leaving the bottle cap gleaming amid soil clumps. <words>270</words>  
Silas collapsed, clutching it, his fervor deflating into a whimper. <words>279</words>  
“It’s just… a cap,” he mumbled, the revelation sour as unripe guava. <words>291</words>  
Eleanor knelt beside him. “So were your scriptures.” <words>299</words>  
Dawn filtered through cracked stained glass, illuminating his hollow stare. <words>310</words>  
She pocketed the cap, its weight trivial yet grounding, and ascended to the parlor. <words>323</words>  
The jungle sighed through broken windows, vines caressing her shoulders like uneasy allies. <words>336</words>  
In her notebook, she scrawled: *Delusion uprooted; vulnerability, a seed.* <words>347</words>  
Silas’s whimpers faded as she stepped onto the veranda, where orchids burst through floorboards—nature reclaiming its theater. <words>364</words>  
The bottle cap, warm in her grip, felt less a relic now than a mirror. <words>376</words>  
She tossed it into the ferns, a *theoretically playful* surrender, and walked into the green, her laughter merging with parrot cries. <words>394</words>  
Behind her, the parlor groaned, its walls collapsing into a symphony of termites and decay. <words>407</words>  
Silas’s final sermon echoed in the wreckage: “All truths rust.” <words>415</words>  
Eleanor didn’t look back. <words>418</words>
