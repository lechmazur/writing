<story>  
The glacial orchard hung like a chandelier of frost-bitten fruit over the crevasse, its roots braided into blue ice that groaned under the weight of eternity. <words>30</words>  
Here, the guarded druid Veyra knelt, her moss-cloaked fingers brushing a dull safety pin lodged in the ice—a relic from when humans still named things "safe." <words>60</words>  
Tonight, she would gather the orchard’s final bloom for the Birthday Feast, a meal her lineage had prepared every century to honor the earth’s endurance. <words>89</words>  
But the feast demanded a voice: to sing the grafting hymn, to break the silence she’d kept since the last human vanished. <words>113</words>  
Veyra’s throat tightened. <words>116</words>  
Fear had nested there, a sparrowhawk with iron talons, ever since the glaciers swallowed her sister mid-song. <words>135</words>  

She pried the safety pin free, its tip blunted by time, and jabbed it into her palm—a ritual to mock her own fragility. <words>160</words>  
"Fiercely ambivalent," the clan elders had called her, a eulogy before she’d even died. <words>177</words>  
Love the world, but distrust its mercy; crave connection, but bury your pulse under permafrost. <words>195</words>  
The crevasse yawned below, its depths humming with meltwater anthems. <words>207</words>  
One slip, and the ice would claim her as it had her sister, leaving the feast unmade, the hymn unsung. <words>228</words>  

Veyra crawled along a root, the safety pin clenched between her teeth, its metallic tang a perverse comfort. <words>250</words>  
The orchard shuddered. <words>253</words>  
Frost-apples rained around her, shattering against the ice in glissando cracks. <words>268</words>  
She laughed then, a sound as parched as wind through dead reeds. <words>283</words>  
Dour amusement, this: a druid who couldn’t speak, hosting a feast for ghosts. <words>298</words>  

At the central tree, she plucked the bloom—a translucent bud veined with bioluminescent sap. <words>317</words>  
The grafting hymn surged in her skull, lyrics fossilized in memory. <words>331</words>  
Her sister’s voice, once a wildfire, now just embers. <words>342</words>  
Veyra pressed the safety pin to her throat, its dull point a counterfeit courage. <words>359</words>  
She sang. <words>360</words>  

The first note splintered the silence, sharp as calving ice. <words>373</words>  
The crevasse echoed it back, a chorus of fractures. <words>384</words>  
Veyra sang louder, each syllable a rebellion against the quiet that had calcified her. <words>401</words>  
The orchard swayed, roots creaking in dissonant harmony. <words>412</words>  
When she finished, the safety pin lay at her feet, bent but unbroken. <words>428</words>  

In the thawing dusk, Veyra prepared the feast: frost-apple stew stirred with a cedar branch, lichen bread on ice-plates. <words>452</words>  
She raised a toast to the emptiness, her voice now a living thing, rasping but unafraid. <words>471</words>  
The crevasse murmured its approval, or perhaps its hunger. <words>483</words>  
It didn’t matter. <words>485</words>  
She’d gathered what remained—of the orchard, of herself—and found it enough. <words>500</words>  

The safety pin glinted in the starlight, neither weapon nor talisman, just a thing that had held. <words>520</words>
