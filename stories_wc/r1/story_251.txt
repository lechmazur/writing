<story>  
In the shadowed domes of a lunar mining colony, where oxygen hissed like a secret and dust clung to everything, the ambivalent prophet Zara knelt beside her collection of marbles—each one cracked by time, their swirling galaxies frozen mid-collapse. <words>40</words>  
She’d traded three ration tokens for the rummage sale box, hoping for tools to defragment the visions fracturing her mind, but found only jigsaw puzzle edges: ivory fragments humming with the static of forgotten stories. <words>75</words>  
“Happily sad,” she muttered, the phrase her late mother had used to describe contradictions that glowed—like love, or the way starlight reached the moon long after its source had died. <words>106</words>  
The colony’s central clock ticked, measuring existence in the space between heartbeats, and Zara’s fingers trembled as she fit two puzzle edges together, revealing a sliver of symbols that mirrored the cracks in her marbles. <words>139</words>  
Her ambivalence was a living thing—pride in her prophecies warring with shame at their cost, the way her warnings of cave-ins and reactor melts always demanded payment in lives. <words>167</words>  
But tonight, arrogance warmed her throat like stolen wine: she’d seen the cosmic scoreboard etched behind her eyelids, tallying every human triumph and despair in luminous numerals, and she intended to scramble its calculus. <words>198</words>  
The final oath required a mosaic—not of glass or stone, but of choices. <words>210</words>  
She arranged the marbles in a spiral, their fractures aligning with the puzzle’s symbols, and pressed her palm against the coldest shard. <words>228</words>  
Memories surged—not her own. <words>231</words>  
A child’s laughter in a Martian orchard, a diplomat’s whispered treason on Europa, a thousand unkept promises orbiting Saturn like broken rings—all fragmented, all demanding resolution. <words>256</words>  
Zara’s breath fogged the dome’s plexiglass as she whispered the oath’s first syllable, and gravity stuttered. <words>271</words>  
Miners froze mid-step; molten ore hung suspended in smelters. <words>280</words>  
Between heartbeats, she became both weaver and thread, braiding the marbles’ fractures into new constellations, using the puzzle edges to stitch time’s frayed hem. <words>303</words>  
The scoreboard flickered—its glowing ledgers of births and disasters unraveling into static. <words>317</words>  
But defiance cost. <words>319</words>  
Blood threaded from Zara’s nostrils as the colony’s clock resumed, its ticks now out of sync with human pulses. <words>335</words>  
A child in Sector D, born to replace a man lost in yesterday’s cave-in, drew her first breath with Zara’s face imprinted behind her eyelids. <words>356</words>  
In the recaf lounge, a mechanic found himself weeping for a war he’d never fought, his hands cradling a marble that hadn’t existed seconds before. <words>377</words>  
Zara slumped, her bashful arrogance crystallizing into something quieter—a shepherd who’d nudged the flock toward stranger grass, knowing some would gorge and others choke. <words>402</words>  
The puzzle edges dissolved to dust, but the marbles remained, cracks glowing faintly as the colony’s newborns wailed in unison. <words>422</words>  
“Happily sad,” Zara told the silence, tasting copper and possibility, as the scoreboard’s last digit blinked into a question mark. <words>440</words>  
Outside, the mining lasers resumed their song, carving echoes into the moon’s bones, while somewhere in the cracks between seconds, a new kind of arithmetic began. <words>463</words>
