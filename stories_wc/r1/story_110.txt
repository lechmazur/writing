In the dim belly of a water clock repair shop, where time dripped like a wounded thing, the assassin polished a moss-covered lantern with a silk handkerchief monogrammed "M.E."—their quietly flamboyant signature. <words>34</words> They adored the lantern’s green patina, a relic from their mother’s garden, now disguising a compartment for poison vials shaped like tear droplets. <words>69</words> Outside, rain scribbled secrets on the windows, and inside, domestic mysteries festered: a client’s pocket watch contained a lock of hair tied with funeral ribbon, and the latest repair order hid a cipher in its margin. <words>108</words>  

"Another eulogy request?" asked the shop’s owner, Mrs. Vee, her voice a rusted hinge, glancing at the coded note. <words>130</words> The assassin nodded; their reputation for crafting bleak eulogies that mentioned hidden truths had spread among grieving aristocrats eager to weaponize their dead. <words>153</words> "Make it sting," Mrs. Vee said, tossing a silver locket containing a portrait of the soon-to-be deceased—a senator whose demise would look like a faulty heart, not a needle’s kiss. <words>181</words>  

Between chapters of their double life—mending clocks by day, burying secrets by night—the assassin lingered in the shop’s attic, where pendulum weights hung like gallows. <words>205</words> Here, they practiced transmuting pain into a masterpiece: drafting eulogies that mourned not the dead, but the living left to rot in their lies. <words>228</words> Tonight’s speech would conclude with, "He cherished tulips," a code to trigger the senator’s allergic reaction mid-funeral, ensuring the assassin’s work bloomed in plain sight. <words>255</words>  

But as the water clock’s gears shuddered, marking the hour, the assassin hesitated. <words>266</words> Mrs. Vee’s latest "repair job" involved a music box that played a lullaby their father had hummed before vanishing—a man who’d also been a hidden truth, swallowed by the same shadows they now navigated. <words>299</words> Despairing humor struck them: they’d become a curator of elegies, yet their own story remained unwritten, inkwell dry. <words>319</words>  

The lantern flickered, its moss trembling as if alive. <words>327</words> "Sentimental," Mrs. Vee would sneer, but the assassin knew better; pain, when distilled, could corrode or create. <words>345</words> They unscrewed the lantern’s false bottom, retrieving a vial labeled "Tulip’s Kiss," and dipped the needle. <words>362</words> The senator’s death would be a sonnet, each symptom a stanza—a masterpiece to honor the father who’d taught them that clocks could be repaired, but time could not. <words>390</words>  

At dawn, the assassin delivered the eulogy draft to Mrs. Vee, who smirked at the tulip line. <words>405</words> "You’ve outdone yourself." <words>409</words> But as they walked past water clocks ticking in dissonant unison, the assassin wondered if their father’s fate had been a eulogy, too—a truth buried in someone else’s masterpiece. <words>440</words> The lantern glowed faintly in their satchel, its moss whispering of gardens and graves, while the shop’s door chimed like a requiem. <words>463</words>  

"One day," they murmured, "I’ll write my own elegy." <words>471</words> Until then, they’d let the clocks weep and the moss grow, stitching time into something that almost resembled forgiveness. <words>492</words>
