<story>  
The surly watchman trudged through the sailor’s graveyard, his boots crunching brittle kelp as the wind hissed between leaning tombstones. <words>34</words>  
Between seasons, the horizon bled—neither winter’s steel nor spring’s blush—a limbo that gnawed at his bones. <words>59</words>  
He clutched the short piece of yarn, its frayed ends whispering of the elder’s lessons: knots that mapped tides, weaves that sang of storms. <words>86</words>  
"Market wisdom," the old woman had rasped, teaching him the craft, "isn’t haggling over fish—it’s reading the loom of the world." <words>106</words>  
Now, beneath a serenely frantic sky—swirling indigo and static—he unraveled the yarn, seeking patterns in the chaos. <words>126</words>  

A shadow coalesced—a specter in salt-crusted rags, its voice a creak of shipwrecked timber. <words>141</words>  
"Riddle me this, keeper of knots: what binds the moon to the merchant’s greed, the wave to the widow’s breath?" <words>157</words>  
The watchman scowled, fingers dancing over the yarn’s braids, its threads mirroring star-charts etched in his memory. <words>175</words>  
Sailors’ ghosts clustered, their murmurs a tempest as he muttered, "A net—crafted not by hand, but by want." <words>193</words>  
The specter hissed, "Closer. But the loom demands blood." <words>203</words>  

Dignified chaos swelled—tides roared inland, tombstones trembled, yet the watchman stood anchored, yarn taut between his fists. <words>223</words>  
The elder’s voice echoed: "Every knot is a choice; every fray, a betrayal." <words>235</words>  
He looped the yarn into a celestial hitch, its form a sigil against the maelstrom. <words>250</words>  
"Desire," he growled. "The same hunger that fills sails and empties coffers—that’s your binding thread." <words>267</words>  
The graveyard stilled. The specter dissolved into brine, leaving a single pearl at his feet. <words>282</words>  

Breath ragged, the watchman pocketed the pearl, its surface etched with constellations. <words>294</words>  
Market wisdom, he realized, wasn’t barter—it was balance, the taut yarn between gain and ruin. <words>311</words>  
As dawn bled violet, he reknit the yarn into a merchant’s charm, its knots encoding the night’s riddle. <words>329</words>  
The elder’s craft had been a key, not a crutch; the graveyard, a ledger of cosmic tolls. <words>346</words>  
Sailors’ souls hummed approval, their rest uneasy but assured—for now, the patterns held. <words>362</words>  

He spat into the wind, surly as ever, yet his chest burned with revelation. <words>375</words>  
Between seasons, truths flickered like mirages: the world was a market, its currency paid in tides and blood. <words>394</words>  
The yarn, once a relic, now pulsed—a compass for the next unraveling. <words>408</words>  
And the watchman waited, eternally, for the next riddle to stitch the chaos into sense. <words>424</words>
