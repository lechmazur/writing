The lingering minstrel plucked his lute strings softly, the notes dissolving into the cavernous echoes of the giant’s dining room. <words>23</words> Around him, plates the size of wagons clattered as the giant’s servants scrambled to set the table amid rush hour, their footsteps thunderous yet hurried, like a storm trapped in a teacup. <words>57</words> He had wandered here seeking more than coins—a way to escape his mundane existence, where every tavern song blurred into the next. <words>84</words> His eyes lingered on the witch’s gnarled wooden ladle propped against the hearth, its handle carved with runes that pulsed faintly, as though breathing. <words>113</words>  

“Openly private, aren’t you?” he murmured to the ladle, a habit of addressing objects that never judged his restless soul. <words>137</words> The servants ignored him, too busy dodging the giant’s impatient roars about cold soup. <words>153</words> But the minstrel saw what they didn’t: the ladle’s surface wasn’t wood at all. <words>168</words> It bore the pitted texture of a meteorite’s skin, grooves swirling like forgotten constellations. <words>184</words> When he brushed it, warmth surged through his veins, whispering of ancient fires trapped in stone. <words>202</words>  

The giant’s roar shook the room: “Rejuvenate the stew, or I’ll feast on *you*!” <words>218</words> A servant fumbled with the ladle, but it clattered to the floor, its magic dormant. <words>233</words> The minstrel scooped it up, feeling its weight hum in his hands. <words>246</words> He stirred the cauldron, not with a servant’s dread, but with a bard’s rhythm, each swirl releasing a scent of pine and stardust. <words>270</words> The broth erupted in gold, its steam coiling into shapes—dancing sprites, wind-whipped mountains, a thousand stories untold. <words>289</words>  

Silence fell. <words>290</words> Even the giant gaped, his wrath undone by the aroma of a world beyond his own. <words>307</words> The minstrel’s pulse quickened; this was affirmation without applause, a truth spoken in the quiet. <words>326</words> Here, amid gentle turmoil, he’d found not escape, but transformation. <words>340</words> The ladle’s power wasn’t in revival, but revelation—it mirrored the yearning he’d buried beneath ballads. <words>360</words>  

As the giant slurped the stew, tears dampening his beard, the minstrel slipped away. <words>377</words> The ladle he left nestled in the hearth’s ashes, its purpose fulfilled. <words>391</words> Outside, the world still turned, mundane and relentless. <words>400</words> Yet his fingers itched to compose a new song, one that wouldn’t just linger, but *unfold*. <words>417</words> For the first time, he wore his solitude like a cloak, openly private, yet unafraid to let the cosmos seep into his chords. <words>440</words> The meteorite’s texture had taught him: even scars could channel light, if stirred with intent. <words>458</words> And in that light, he glimpsed a life not escaped, but deepened—note by note, silence by silence. <words>479</words>
