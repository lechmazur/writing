The canyon’s sandstone walls hummed with portals, their edges frayed like burnt parchment, as Elara—small-town librarian and keeper of unshelved secrets—clutched the stolen museum artifact tag. <words>30</words> Its bronze surface bore the phrase *harvesting grace*, a term she’d only seen in the margins of forbidden cookbooks shelved between *Joy of Cooking* and *Culinary Alchemy*. <words>60</words> The carvings around her pulsed, their ancient glyphs mocking her with sincerity: *To dismantle the gate, one must first taste the feast of the perfectly flawed*. <words>90</words>  

Elara traced the artifact’s serial number, recalling how it had arrived—tucked inside a donated pie tin, still reeking of cardamom and betrayal. <words>115</words> The thief, a spectral figure who’d vanished into a portal mid-bite, had left a note: *Legends aren’t made. They’re baked.* <words>137</words> Generations of silent watchers—her ancestors, their faces eroded from canyon walls—had guarded these gates, yet none dared steal from the museum’s “lost relics” exhibit. <words>164</words> Until her. <words>166</words>  

She’d always been too precise for the town’s gossip, too flawed for its pity. <words>182</words> But the portals demanded a price only imperfection could pay. <words>194</words> In her satchel, she carried a slice of *sfouf*, the turmeric cake her mother had baked every solstice, its recipe a cipher for portal-song. <words>219</words> The thief’s shared craving for it had lured Elara here—a bond forged in almond flour and desperation. <words>239</words>  

“You’re late,” hissed a voice as a figure coalesced from sandstone dust, holding a knife glinting with glyphs. <words>260</words> The thief’s face mirrored Elara’s own, but older, fractured—a future self who’d become the legend whispered in library stacks. <words>283</words> “To harvest grace, you must *unmake* the recipe,” Future-Elara said, slicing her palm. <words>299</words> Blood dripped onto the artifact tag, dissolving it into a map of the canyon’s heart. <words>318</words>  

The portals shuddered. <words>320</words> Elara’s fingers trembled as she crumbled the *sfouf* into the nearest gate, its edges unraveling to reveal a chamber where time curdled like spoiled cream. <words>345</words> There, suspended in amber light, was the first silent watcher—her great-grandmother, frozen mid-scream, a cookbook in her hands. <words>368</words> *Harvesting grace* wasn’t theft. <words>372</words> It was revival. <words>374</words>  

“Dismantle her,” Future-Elara urged, thrusting the knife forward. <words>385</words> “The recipe requires a sacrifice.” <words>391</words> But Elara, recalling her mother’s laughter as batter spilled, pressed the *sfouf* into the amber instead. <words>413</words> Perfection shattered; her great-grandmother gasped awake, clutching the cookbook’s true title: *How to Devour Gods*. <words>434</words>  

The canyon roared. <words>436</words> Portals snapped shut as Future-Elara dissolved, her legend undone by a choice no ancestor had risked—sparing, not taking. <words>458</words> The watchers’ carvings softened into smiles; the artifact tag, now reforged, read *perfectly flawed*. <words>477</words> Elara pocketed it, tasting cardamom on the wind. <words>488</words> Some legends, she decided, were best served with crumbs. <words>500</words>
