<story>When the old watchtower clock struck thirteen, its rusted gears screaming like a wounded beast, Sir Alaric felt the weight of his rusted armor dissolve. <words>27</words>The zero-gravity dance hall beneath the tower shuddered awake, its crystalline floor humming as dancers—silk-clad, masked, limbs trailing starlight—began to float upward in a silent, sacred disorder. <words>60</words>Alaric’s gauntleted hand tightened around the trident prong, its coral teeth biting his palm, its aura whispering of the sunken realm where he’d buried his honor centuries ago. <words>94</words>Tonight, he would quicken the vow he’d etched into his ribs, the one that had festered unspoken as the world forgot him. <words>120</words></words>  

The hall’s anti-gravity field warped the air into liquid silver, distorting time as deftly as it defied physics—a normally abnormal phenomenon the revelers accepted with wine-soaked laughter. <words>155</words>Alaric wove through them, his boots magnetized to the shifting floor, the trident’s prong glowing hotter with each step. <words>178</words>Memories surged: his king’s skeleton sinking into abyssal silt, the oath to reclaim the drowned crown abandoned when fear had choked his voice. <words>207</words>Now, the forgotten paths called—tunnels of prismatic sea-glass only the trident could unseal, roads through the ocean’s marrow. <words>230</words></words>  

A dancer collided with him, her mask slipping to reveal gills fluttering at her throat. <words>244</words>“You smell of depth,” she hissed, her voice a sonar pulse. <words>256</words>“The horizons here deepen only for the willing.” <words>265</words>Before he could reply, the clock struck again—fourteen chimes—and the hall inverted. <words>282</words>Ceiling became floor; dancers cascaded like scattered pearls, their laughter curdling into gasps as the trident’s light fractured the shadows. <words>308</words></words>  

Alaric lunged toward the central vortex, where the air coiled into a spiral staircase of brine and moonlight. <words>329</words>The prong shuddered, its power quickening his blood, sharpening his resolve. <words>344</words>He climbed, each step heavier than the last, until the hall vanished and he stood in the sunken realm’s carcass—a cathedral of shipwrecks, its altar a throne of eel bones. <words>377</words>There, the crown awaited, fused with a colossal anemone, its jewels pulsating like bioluminescent hearts. <words>398</words></words>  

“I voice the vow silence suffocated,” he roared, driving the prong into the anemone. <words>415</words>Light exploded, the realm convulsing as the crown dislodged, soaring into his grasp. <words>432</words>Horizons deepened—not outward, but inward—as centuries of shame unraveled. <words>446</words>The dance hall’s gravity returned, depositing him breathless beneath the clock, its hands now still. <words>465</words>Dispersing revelers murmured of miracles; Alaric smiled, the crown’s weight a welcome scar, his silenced oath finally echoing through the ages. <words>493</words></words></story>
