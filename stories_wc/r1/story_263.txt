The zealot assassin strolled through the coral reef city’s bioluminescent grottoes, clutching a faded carnival prize plush—a moth-eaten octopus with one button eye dangling by a thread. <words>30</words>  
“Morality’s just a mirror,” he mused, calculatedly playful as he tossed the plush into a current, watching it spiral toward a cluster of anemones, “and I’m here to smash it.” <words>62</words>  
His mission, during these daily nature walks, was to consolidate the fractured legends of the Sunken Tyrant—an epic traditionally sung by heroes, now to be retold through reversed echoes of the villain’s laughter. <words>96</words>  
The plush, won centuries ago at a surface-world carnival before the oceans rose, was his only relic of “innocence,” a word he spat like venom. <words>121</words>  
Today’s target: a historian seahorse-riding librarian who’d dared transcribe the Tyrant’s conquests as tragedy rather than triumph. <words>141</words>  
“History’s a coral polyp,” the assassin whispered, rigging explosive kelp pods along the library’s arches, “building on dead men’s lies.” <words>163</words>  
As the charges detonated in reverse chronological order—shattering newest to oldest shelves first—the librarian emerged, clutching scrolls that dissolved into brine. <words>187</words>  
“Why not just write your own version?” she coughed, ink-stained tentacles flaring. <words>200</words>  
“Darling,” he grinned, pirouetting through disintegrating knowledge, “reversed echoes are louder. Watch—your ‘heroic’ last stand becomes my chorus!” <words>224</words>  
He activated the echo-chamber conch at his belt, replaying her scream backward until it harmonized with the Tyrant’s ancient war hymns. <words>243</words>  
The reef itself seemed to chuckle through creaking coral, its polyps contracting in humorous solemnity as centuries of propaganda unraveled. <words>263</words>  
When the librarian lunged, trident gleaming, the assassin lobbed his plush into her grip; she hesitated, staring at its childish grin. <words>284</words>  
“That’s the reflection,” he crooned, driving a poison-spined urchin into her thigh. “Your mercy, my punchline.” <words>301</words>  
As she convulsed, he arranged the scene: scroll fragments floating like requiem confetti, her hand still clutching the toy. <words>320</words>  
“Audiences adore pathos,” he informed a curious anglerfish, adjusting her corpse’s expression to one of comic dismay. <words>339</words>  
The reversed explosions now rebuilt the library—shelves reassembling from splinters, scrolls inking themselves anew—but every restored text bore the Tyrant’s revised monologues. <words>367</words>  
“Ethics are editable,” the assassin sang, skipping over a protesting starfish, “if you’ve got flair for revisionist hydraulics!” <words>387</words>  
By dusk, the coral city buzzed with scholars debating the “newly discovered” scrolls that painted the Tyrant as a misunderstood architect of progress. <words>410</words>  
The assassin reclined in a bubble tavern, toasting his plush propped on the table. <words>424</words>  
“To smashed mirrors,” he chuckled, solemnly watching its remaining eye sink into the stuffing, “and stories that swim sideways.” <words>443</words>  
Outside, bioluminescent jellyfish pulsed like applauding spectators, their light glinting on the dagger he’d already polished for tomorrow’s nature walk. <words>467</words>  
The reflection in its blade showed neither hero nor villain—just a man winking back, one hand holding a weapon, the other a child’s forgotten prize. <words>493</words>  
“Encore tomorrow,” he promised the hollow-eyed plush, and the reef shivered in anticipation. <words>508</words>
