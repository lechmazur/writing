The apathetic jester slumped against a bioluminescent toadstool, its glow painting his checkered sleeves violet as he tossed the crumpled map into the air. <words>30</words> It landed on his face, its ink-smudged contours outlining a labyrinth of fungal towers—each labeled with riddles in his grandmother’s spidery handwriting. <words>60</words> “Another year, another skill,” he muttered, recalling the family tradition: every solstice, they gathered in the giant mushroom garden to master something new, though his own contribution had always been sarcastic limericks. <words>95</words>  

A faint hum vibrated in his molars, the same persistent frequency that had haunted him since childhood—the hum of insight, his mother called it, a hereditary quirk signaling proximity to truth. <words>130</words> He ignored it, flicking the map away. <words>136</words> “Why bother? We’ll just fail again,” he drawled, watching his siblings bicker over a compass that pointed only backward. <words>156</words>  

His youngest sister, clutching a prism forged from mushroom resin, glared. <words>168</words> “You’re supposed to illuminate the path, not whine.” <words>176</words> Academically playful taunts were their love language, sharp but bloodless. <words>186</words> The jester sighed, twirling a dagger—his “prop” for learning sleight-of-hand—before stabbing it lazily into the map. <words>205</words> The blade pierced a sketched moon, and suddenly the garden pulsed, fungal caps shuddering as beams of silver light shot upward, crisscrossing like synaptic flares. <words>234</words>  

The hum crescendoed. <words>236</words> Words flickered on the toadstools: *To cradle compassion in barbed wire arms, first let the light disarm.* <words>255</words> “Cryptic mush as always,” he snorted, but his chest tightened. <words>266</words> Compassion required effort, and effort required caring—a currency he’d spent years devaluing. <words>283</words> Yet the garden’s glow now pooled around his feet, insistent, almost… kind. <words>296</words>  

“Fine.” <words>297</words> He snatched the prism, channeling the beams through it until the map’s riddles resolved into musical notes. <words>315</words> His brother produced a lute strung with spider silk; their sister sang in a dialect of coughs and whispers. <words>333</words> The jester, despite himself, juggled the prism, dagger, and his fraying apathy in a looping arc. <words>351</words> Each catch synced with a note, each toss dissolving a fungal wall, revealing corridors veined with glowing spores. <words>371</words>  

By dawn, they stood at the garden’s heart, where a single shivering mushroom bore their grandmother’s final riddle: *What grows sharper when given away?* <words>399</words> The jester stared at his siblings—exhausted, grinning, already arguing about next year’s skill—and felt the hum settle into his ribs. <words>424</words> “Knowledge,” he said quietly. <words>427</words> The mushroom split open, releasing a scroll that unfurled into a star chart none could read yet. <words>446</words>  

“We’ll figure it out,” his sister said, elbow jabbing his side. <words>456</words> He shrugged, intense nonchalance masking the warmth pooling in his throat. <words>468</words> Compassion, it turned out, could nest even in a jester’s calloused hands, so long as the light kept pushing through the cracks. <words>492</words>
