The greenhouse for extinct plants hummed with latent life, its glass panels sweating under the weight of forgotten photosynthesis. <words>23</words>  
Serene Fisher adjusted her torn wristband, its frayed edges whispering against her skin like a half-remembered promise. <words>44</words>  
She had come here at the hush once a baby’s lullaby ends—that fragile silence between comfort and longing—to harbor a secret even the extinct orchids might judge. <words>73</words>  
Her fingers traced the quilt draped over the rusted watering can, its stitches tighter than a miser’s purse, each thread a century-old lie. <words>97</words>  
The art of illusion, her grandmother had taught her, wasn’t about deception but preservation: how to make the logically absurd breathe, how to stitch truth into patterns too intricate to unravel. <words>128</words>  
Yet here she was, unpicking the quilt’s seams with a fisherman’s precision, seeking the wisdom in ancient texts supposedly woven into its batting. <words>151</words>  
A fern from the Jurassic period unfurled nearby, its fronds trembling as if laughing at her desperation. <words>169</words>  
“You’d understand,” she muttered to the air, “if you’d ever tried to fish answers from a sea of ghosts.” <words>188</words>  
The final stitch snapped, releasing a smell of lavender and burnt parchment. <words>200</words>  
Beneath the fabric lay a map inked on moth-eaten linen, its coordinates pointing to a library submerged beneath the same waters where she’d once netted minnows and metaphors. <words>229</words>  
Serene’s laugh was a dry thing, roughened by salt and skepticism. <words>240</words>  
Of course the texts were underwater—because why let reality impede poetry? <words>253</words>  
She glanced at her wristband, torn the day she’d abandoned her boat to tend this cathedral of chlorophyll and regret. <words>273</words>  
The plants didn’t need her; they needed the illusion of needing her, just as she needed the fiction that her grandmother’s death hadn’t severed the line between magic and muscle memory. <words>303</words>  
At dawn’s first bruise-colored light, she’d dive for the library, armed with lungfuls of air and grudging admiration for ancestors who’d turned survival into allegory. <words>330</words>  
The quilt’s threads now coiled at her feet like a surrendered noose. <words>343</words>  
Serene pressed a palm to the greenhouse floor, feeling the hum of extinct roots drinking from pipes fed by a river that no longer existed. <words>367</words>  
Illusion upon illusion, each more logically absurd than the last—yet here grew ferns that had shaded dinosaurs, here bloomed roses that had perfumed Atlantis. <words>393</words>  
Her grandmother’s voice surfaced in her mind, sharp as a fishhook: “Wisdom isn’t found, child. It’s the current you build between what’s drowned and what still floats.” <words>423</words>  
Serene pocketed the map, its linen soft as a lullaby’s last note. <words>437</words>  
Outside, the real sea growled, but here, in this temple of cultivated oblivion, even the water droplets suspending themselves mid-air seemed to pause—to admire the audacity of a woman who’d rather unravel time than admit she’s lonely. <words>481</words>  
She stepped into the dawn, the torn wristband now a compass, the quilt’s threads a lifeline. <words>497</words>
