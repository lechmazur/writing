The street musician’s fingers trembled over his harmonica as conveyor belts hummed around him, their mechanical growl drowning his blues in the cavernous belly of the automated postal sorting facility. <words>34</words> He’d taken the night shift to escape the city’s indifference, but the fluorescent-lit labyrinth of zip codes and barcodes only amplified his loneliness—until he found the vintage fountain pen jammed in a crevice of a rusted sorting machine. <words>76</words> Its gold nib gleamed under the sterile light, etched with forgotten patterns: spirals that seemed to twist when stared at too long. <words>102</words> When he touched it, the facility shuddered, belts reversing, parcels soaring backward like rewound film, and his lungs flooded with the backlash of regrets he’d sealed in mental suitcases years ago. <words>138</words>  

“Huh,” Eli muttered, the pen warm in his palm, “so *this* is how the universe trolls the unemployed.” <words>158</words> He sketched a spiral in the air, and time unraveled again—faster now—revealing the facility’s past: workers in 1970s uniforms, their laughter echoing as they hand-sorted letters, their camaraderie a stark contrast to the cold automation that replaced them. <words>206</words> But each rewind exacted a price. <words>211</words> Memories he’d buried resurfaced: his ex’s shattered cello, his father’s funeral, the gigs he’d missed chasing stability. <words>229</words> The pen’s patterns weren’t just decorative; they were a complexly deceptive map of time’s seams, and Eli was stitching himself into its fabric. <words>254</words>  

By dawn, he’d learned to manipulate the glitches—freezing moments to balance parcels into absurd sculptures, sending a rubber chicken looping eternally through a scanner. <words>282</words> He laughed, sharp and wild, as the machines rebelled, spitting confetti from shredded tax documents. <words>299</words> Joyful despair, he realized, was the only sane response to a cosmos that gifted time travel to a man too broke to afford therapy. <words>324</words>  

Then he found the letter. <words>328</words> Amid the chaos, a faded envelope addressed to him in his mother’s handwriting, postmarked three days after her death. <words>348</words> The pen’s nib hovered. <words>352</words> Open it, and he’d risk collapsing the fragile timeline; leave it, and the suitcase of his grief might never reopen. <words>372</words> He chose the third option—drawing a spiral on the envelope, watching it disintegrate into golden dust, its words scattering into the ventilation shafts like dandelion seeds. <words>400</words>  

When the shift ended, Eli pocketed the pen and stepped into the alley, where dawn painted the sky in bruised purples. <words>421</words> He played a new melody on his harmonica, notes bending between major and minor, a dirge for the automated world’s lost humanity—and a wink at the absurdity of mourning through jazz hands. <words>452</words> Somewhere, a suitcase clicked shut. <words>458</words> Somewhere else, a rubber chicken flew forever. <words>466</words> Eli grinned, because what else could you do? <words>475</words>
