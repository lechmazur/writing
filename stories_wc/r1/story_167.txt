The capsule hotel hummed with the static of displaced time, its narrow pods stacked like coffins for the chronologically unmoored. <words>25</words>  
Dr. Elara Voss, a dutiful scholar of temporal ethics, clutched the small wire coil in her palm—its cold ridges biting her skin—as she paced the sterile hallway. <words>49</words>  
Tonight, amid the calm that settled before the Consortium’s final evaluation of her research, she would do the unthinkable: contaminate the timeline. <words>71</words>  
The coil, uncommonly typical in its design, masked its true function—a resonator capable of amplifying echoes across centuries. <words>90</words>  
It was the key to the old well behind the hotel, where a voice’s reflection could slip through temporal fissures. <words>108</words>  
Elara’s motivation coiled tighter with each step. <words>115</words>  
For years, she’d archived erased histories, their narratives deemed too volatile for the present. <words>130</words>  
But the tale of the Lament—a 23rd-century uprising quashed by silence—had clawed at her, its unspoken heart festering like a wound. <words>149</words>  
The Consortium called preservation a risk; she called it justice. <words>158</words>  
At the well’s moss-crusted rim, she hesitated. <words>164</words>  
Wind threaded through the pines, carrying the scent of ozone from time engines. <words>175</words>  
She dropped the coil into the darkness, heard it clatter against stone, and whispered the Lament’s first truth into the void. <words>193</words>  
The well’s echo fractured, splintering into a thousand mirrored moments. <words>202</words>  
A vibration surged—not through air, but through decades. <words>210</words>  
In 2241, a child paused mid-step, the resonance humming in her bones. <words>220</words>  
In 2307, a dissident scribbling manifestos froze as the words bloomed in his mind. <words>233</words>  
The contamination spread, subtle and seismic. <words>238</words>  
Back at the hotel, Elara stared at her trembling hands. <words>246</words>  
Had it worked? <words>248</words>  
The answer came as a shift in the air—a papery rustle from under her door. <words>261</words>  
A single page lay there, its ink fresh, detailing the Lament’s song from a timeline where it survived. <words>278</words>  
She laughed, sharp and giddy, the sound merging with the distant whir of time pods. <words>292</words>  
They would strip her credentials for this. <words>297</words>  
But as she traced the words on the page, Elara felt an earthbound flight—a grounding in purpose, a soaring in triumph. <words>315</words>  
The hotel’s intercom crackled, summoning her to the evaluation chamber. <words>324</words>  
She folded the page into her sleeve, its weight a secret ally. <words>335</words>  
In the sterile room, the Consortium’s enforcers glared, their chrono-blades glowing. <words>347</words>  
“Your findings?” the lead interrogator demanded. <words>353</words>  
Elara smiled. <words>355</words>  
“History,” she said, “is louder than silence.” <words>362</words>  
As they seized her, the hotel’s lights flickered—a surge of temporal feedback from a future rewriting itself. <words>378</words>  
The Lament’s story, now unshackled, pulsed in the veins of every era. <words>390</words>  
Elara’s coil, still resonating in the well, hummed with the harmony of voices once buried. <words>404</words>  
The scholars would call her a radical. <words>409</words>  
The freed would call her a conduit. <words>414</words>  
But in that moment, as time rippled and the pods shuddered, she was simply a woman who’d let the forbidden speak. <words>432</words>  
The calm had broken. <words>435</words>  
The test, she realized, had never been theirs—it had been hers. <words>445</words>  
And she’d passed. <words>447</words>
