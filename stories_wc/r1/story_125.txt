The underachieving mage slumped in the abandoned space station control room, her boots propped on a console flickering with dead languages. <words>27</words> Outside the grime-caked viewport, the boundary of her family’s fallow farmland blurred into the horizon, its sale pending at dawn—a fact her mother had texted in all caps. <words>57</words> She tossed the doll head onto the dashboard; its glass eyes blinked once, slow as a bored cat, though she’d yanked it from a misdelivered package labeled *Fertilizer Samples*. <words>89</words> Three weeks of these “accidental” parcels: a porcelain arm here, a leg there, all addressed to someone named *Kestrel*. <words>108</words> Assembled, the doll resembled her grandmother’s childhood portrait, if her grandmother had been bisected by a customs officer. <words>128</words>  

“Reclaiming heritage,” the mage muttered, mimicking her academy mentors’ drawl. <words>138</words> She’d flunked out for “exceptionally usual” spellwork—too pedestrian for fireballs, too dull for curses. <words>152</words> But the doll’s gaze followed her, and the control room’s derelict terminals hummed when she neared them, as if the station remembered her bloodline’s old pact with orbital machinery. <words>179</words>  

At midnight, she slotted the doll’s head into a console port. <words>188</words> Metal creaked. <words>190</words> The eyes flashed violet, projecting a hologram: her great-grandmother, grinning sharp as a land deed, standing in this same room. <words>211</words> “Took you long enough,” the ghost said. <words>218</words> “We hid our magic in plain sight—routines so usual they’re invisible. <words>231</words> Farm rotations. <words>233</words> Soil charts. <words>235</words> You think you’re *unremarkable*? Perfect. <words>242</words> No one suspects the mundane.” <words>247</words>  

The mage’s palms itched. <words>250</words> Outside, tractors droned as developers marked the fields for demolition. <words>261</words> She’d ignored those eviction notices, same as she’d ignored her mother’s pleas to “be practical.” <words>277</words> But practicality had limits—like a doll syncing with a dead woman’s heartbeat, or a control panel now glowing with soil-density runes. <words>302</words>  

“Spring the trap,” the hologram urged. <words>308</words> “Unveil what’s buried.” <words>313</words> The mage exhaled, then typed the first spell she’d ever learned: a charm for hastening crop growth, tweaked with station coordinates. <words>335</words> The floor shuddered. <words>337</words> Through the viewport, the dormant farmland erupted in geometric light, ley lines flaring gold where corn once wilted. <words>358</words> Developers’ trucks skidded to a halt as the soil split, revealing a buried archive of seeds, star charts, and every “misdelivered” doll part she’d hidden under her bed. <words>387</words>  

“Huh,” the mage said, watching the blinking doll wink. <words>396</words> Maybe “usual” was just magic everyone had stopped seeing. <words>408</words> She pocketed the head, smirking as the control room’s systems booted anew—her ancestors’ legacy, and her own limits, crumbling like fallow dirt under a tractor’s wheel. <words>437</words>
