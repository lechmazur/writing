<story>  
The fainthearted sentinel adjusted her grip on the leashes, the three terriers snuffling at cobblestones as rain slicked the alley. <words>25</words>  
Her nightly dog-walking route was a ruse; beneath the butcher’s shop lay the initiation chamber, its entrance disguised as a storm drain. <words>49</words>  
Inside, the air hummed with beeswax candles, their light glinting off the plain plastic ruler strapped to her thigh—a child’s tool, yet the key to deciphering the Society’s woven tapestry. <words>79</words>  
The elders had called it *intimately distant*, this ritual: close enough to touch the threads of power, yet barred from grasping them until she proved worthy. <words>106</words>  
She approached the tapestry, its labyrinthine patterns shimmering like trapped starlight, and pressed the ruler’s edge to a fraying corner. <words>128</words>  
Measurements were futile here; the illusion of security lay in believing order could tame chaos. <words>144</words>  
But the ancient writings coiled within the fabric demanded precision—each glyph a star in a collapsing constellation. <words>163</words>  
Her hands trembled. <words>165</words>  
A terrier whined upstairs, tugging the leashes still looped around her wrist, and she felt the familiar *drift*—not just the dogs pulling, but her resolve unraveling. <words>191</words>  
“Focus,” hissed the Voice from the shadows, its owner always unseen, always nearer than comfort allowed. <words>210</words>  
She inhaled, tracing the ruler along a thread of gold. <words>219</words>  
The tapestry rippled. <words>221</words>  
Numbers bloomed in her mind: 13 stitches east, 7 north, a code hidden in the warp and weft. <words>238</words>  
The dogs barked suddenly, their urgency slicing through the chamber’s silence. <words>251</words>  
Above, boots clattered—city guards, perhaps, or rivals seeking the Society’s secrets. <words>266</words>  
Panic tightened her throat, but the ruler’s cold ridges bit into her palm, grounding her. <words>283</words>  
She *would* learn the writings. <words>287</words>  
She’d spent too many years as a ghost in her own life, tending others’ hounds and hungers. <words>304</words>  
The tapestry’s center beckoned, a spiral of silver and ash. <words>315</words>  
As she aligned the ruler diagonally, a glyph ignited—**liberty**, or **betrayal**?—its meaning warping as the fabric shifted. <words>336</words>  
The Voice chuckled. <words>338</words>  
“Security is a story we tell ourselves,” it said. <words>347</words>  
“The true test is to walk the edge without falling.” <words>357</words>  
The dogs’ barking crescendoed. <words>361</words>  
She tore the ruler downward, slicing through threads. <words>370</words>  
The tapestry hissed, unraveling into a map of glowing sigils on the floor. <words>383</words>  
The chamber trembled; the Society’s secrets laid bare, fleeting as ink in water. <words>397</words>  
The terriers’ leash went slack—they’d chewed through their restraints. <words>409</words>  
She stared at the fading glyphs, then at the broken ruler. <words>420</words>  
Security was illusion. <words>422</words>  
But knowledge? <words>424</words>  
Knowledge was a choice. <words>427</words>  
Gathering the shredded leash, she stepped into the alley’s rain, the dogs trotting beside her, and began to walk—not drifting, but *deciding*. <words>449</words>
