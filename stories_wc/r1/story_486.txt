The sound engineer adjusted her headphones, fingertips brushing the stained glass fragment in her pocket—a jagged prism stolen from a cathedral’s shattered window. <words>27</words>  
In the witch’s cauldron room, where copper pipes coiled like serpents and silence hummed louder than any frequency, she calibrated her gear to manipulate reality itself. <words>52</words>  
Tonight, during the hush of a freshly erased chalkboard—that liminal breath before new equations stained the slate—she’d enact her silent retribution. <words>76</words>  
The crowd outside roared, their fury a tidal wave threatening to crush City Hall, but she’d hush them without uttering a word. <words>99</words>  

Clumsily dexterous, she tripped over a cable, yet her hands danced across the soundboard, weaving subsonic threads into the air. <words>122</words>  
Her method was pantomime: in public squares, she’d mirror the sins of corrupt officials, her gestures sharp as knives, and the guilty, hypnotized, would confess. <words>151</words>  
Practical illusion, she called it—theatrics grounded in physics, lies that told truths. <words>166</words>  

She activated the cauldron, its liquid mercury surface rippling with stolen voices. <words>180</words>  
The stained glass glowed, refracting sound into light, bending perceptions until reality frayed at the edges. <words>198</words>  
A politician’s embezzlement became a jester’s pratfall; a banker’s fraud melted into a child’s chalk drawing. <words>218</words>  

In the square, she began her critique, arms slicing the air like a conductor exorcising demons. <words>235</words>  
The crowd stilled, entranced, as her pantomime drew forth the mayor’s aide, who stammered admissions of bribery through trembling lips. <words>258</words>  
Each confession peeled back layers of complicity, the roar diminishing into uneasy murmurs. <words>275</words>  

But the glass fragment pulsed hotter, cracking under the strain of collective shame. <words>290</words>  
Her clumsiness resurged—a misstep here, a fumbled frequency there—and the illusions wavered. <words>308</words>  
The crowd’s anger flickered back, a match struck in dry tinder. <words>322</words>  

Gritting her teeth, she channeled the last dregs of the cauldron’s power, syncing her gestures to the subsonic thrum in their bones. <words>345</words>  
The stained glass shattered, its final prismatic burst etching truth into the air: a tableau of the city’s rot, laid bare. <words>367</words>  
The crowd fell silent, not from manipulation, but understanding. <words>379</words>  

Afterward, in the cauldron room’s eerie quiet, she bandaged her cut palm, the cost of clumsy dexterity. <words>398</words>  
They’d call her a witch, a savior, a fraud. <words>406</words>  
But the hush held, and for now, that was enough. <words>418</words>
