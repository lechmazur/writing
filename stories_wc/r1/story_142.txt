<story>Lady Elara Voss, last of the Voss dynasty, trudged past the rusted ticket booth clutching her great-grandmother’s botanical illustration portfolio, its leather straps biting her palms. <words>34</words> She’d chosen to walk the seven miles to the abandoned Silver Peaks Amusement Park because the clatter of her dying Renault would’ve announced her trespassing—tonight, secrecy mattered more than the blisters swelling beneath her moth-eaten silk gloves. <words>76</words> The park emerged through November fog like a charcoal smudge: roller coaster tracks ribbing the sky, skeletal Ferris wheel creaking, and everywhere, the realistically odd sight of overgrown carnivorous plants curling around lampposts, their violet blooms glowing faintly. <words>120</words> Her family’s 19th-century herbalism manuals hinted these flora guarded the “Nectar of Persephone,” a recipe granting eternal vitality—the last hope to salvage the Voss name from debt and disgrace. <words>155</words>  

Between parallel paths—one littered with shattered glass, the other choked by vines—Elara hesitated, then sliced through a thicket, her grandmother’s voice hissing in memory: “Legacies are burdens carried sideways.” <words>193</words> The roller coaster’s shadow loomed ahead, its graffiti-scabbed cars suspended mid-plunge. <words>208</words> Beneath the tracks, she found the greenhouse, its shattered dome veiled in bioluminescent moss. <words>224</words> Inside, a figure materialized—not a ghost, but Mrs. Lila Crane, the park’s 103-year-old former botanist, hunched over a steaming alembic, her hair braided with thorny tendrils. <words>258</words> “You’ve come to harmonize the old poisons with new hungers,” Lila rasped, offering a spoonful of iridescent syrup. <words>278</words>  

Elara’s hand trembled; this wasn’t the genteel herbalism of pressed flowers and tea rituals. <words>295</words> But the Nectar’s scent—black cherries and grave soil—thrummed in her marrow. <words>311</words> She drank. <words>313</words> Visions erupted: her ancestors grafting belladonna onto rose roots, Lila distilling park rides’ rust into tonic, all while the coaster’s phantom screams harmonized with wind. <words>342</words> Legacy wasn’t preservation—it was theft, adaptation, swallowing shadows to survive. <words>357</words>  

Dawn approached, blurring the greenhouse into vivid streaks of gold and rot. <words>373</words> Elara pocketed vials of Nectar, their recipes etched in her blood now. <words>386</words> Lila vanished, leaving a single magnolia sketch in the portfolio—its petals edged with teeth. <words>403</words> As Elara retraced her steps, the park’s flora bowed, not to aristocracy, but to the new poison-keeper walking the knife-edge between past and hunger. <words>433</words> She’d drive home, sell the Renault, and plant her own peculiar garden. <words>446</words> Burdens, after all, make the sharpest seeds. <words>454</words></story>
