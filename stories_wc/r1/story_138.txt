<story>  
The forgotten noble adjusted her goggles, fingers trembling as she wound the artificial hummingbird drone’s copper wings. <words>25</words>  
Around her, the spontaneous combustion lab hummed with the hollow recklessness of machines left too long unattended—crackling arcs, smoldering steel, the acrid scent of truths burning too bright. <words>53</words>  
Her family name, once etched in marble, now lingered only on yellowed ticket stubs scattered across her workbench: opera seats, train journeys, admissions to galleries whose ashes still clung to her coat. <words>84</words>  
“Why reassemble them?” Mara had asked earlier, her text message glowing unanswered on the cracked screen of the noble’s phone. <words>104</words>  
The answer was mysteriously obvious, like the drone’s purpose—to cut through illusions, to fortify what remained of the world before the fires began. <words>128</words>  
Each stub was a cipher, a fragment of a map leading to the ignition point of her family’s downfall. <words>144</words>  
She aligned them into a constellation, her breath catching as dates and locations overlapped—a performance here, a derailment there, all converging on the night her father’s study burst into blue flames. <words>175</words>  
The drone whirred to life, its emerald feathers refracting lab light as it darted toward the combustion chamber. <words>193</words>  
Candor in small moments, she thought, recalling Mara’s laughter during yesterday’s blackout, how it had briefly silenced the sirens. <words>213</words>  
“You’re chasing ghosts,” Mara would say, but ghosts didn’t leave fingerprints on ticket glue or schematics for hummingbirds that could taste the air for lies. <words>235</words>  
The lab’s core shuddered; a vial of liquid memory sparked on the edge of detonation. <words>248</words>  
Between text messages—Mara’s latest blinking with a warning she couldn’t yet read—the noble fed the drone a stub from the last opera her mother attended. <words>273</words>  
The machine trilled, its sensors identifying the chemical residue of betrayal lingering on the paper. <words>289</words>  
Here was the truth, scalding and simple: her family hadn’t fallen to misfortune. <words>305</words>  
They’d been engineered to burn. <words>310</words>  
The chamber’s temperature spiked. <words>314</words>  
She lunged for the coolant controls, but the drone struck first, piercing the vial with its needle beak. <words>332</words>  
A gasp of frost filled the room. <words>338</words>  
On the workbench, the final stub trembled—a child’s ticket to a lantern festival, unsigned, unsent. <words>355</words>  
Her ticket. <words>357</words>  
Mara’s newest message flashed: “You knew, didn’t you?” <words>366</words>  
The noble inhaled, the lab’s chaos crystallizing into a single, unbearable clarity. <words>380</words>  
They’d left her alive because she’d been taught to see sparks as stars. <words>394</words>  
But the drone hovered now, insistent, its wings etching equations in the smoke. <words>409</words>  
She typed a reply—“Meet me at the station”—and dropped the last stub into the hummingbird’s talons. <words>428</words>  
As it soared into the city’s poisoned dawn, she began counting the seconds until something, somewhere, stopped pretending to burn and finally did. <words>453</words>
