<story>  
The measured diplomat traced the fox tail tassel’s frayed edges, its crimson threads still smelling of campfire and iron—a bandit’s trophy, now her compass. <words>27</words>  
Amid drum circles thrumming like war-hearts beneath the forgotten city hall’s cracked dome, she inhaled the abrasive calm of dust and decay, her gloves brushing the organically synthetic walls. <words>54</words>  
They pulsed faintly, veins of lab-grown cellulose weaving through stone, a mockery of nature’s design. <words>70</words>  
“Decoding genetic patterns requires more than patience,” the bandit had jested before she slit his throat, his laughter echoing the shuttered children’s theater’s musty scent—sour velvet and forgotten innocence. <words>98</words>  
She’d followed that odor here, to where the drums’ vibration loosened mortar, revealing hollows stuffed with vials of amber liquid. <words>117</words>  
Each contained a helix swirling with stolen traits: a fox’s cunning, a diplomat’s poise, a bandit’s hunger. <words>132</words>  
The price of revenge, she realized, wasn’t blood, but becoming what you hunted. <words>144</words>  

Her fingers trembled as she uncorked a vial. <words>150</words>  
The tassel’s DNA would lead her to the syndicate’s core, but the synthetic enzymes within her own blood rebelled, itching to rewrite her. <words>169</words>  
A shadow shifted—another diplomat, his smile serrated. <words>177</words>  
“You’ve always preferred puzzles to people,” he said, tapping the wall. <words>187</words>  
It rippled, extruding a pistol molded from living resin. <words>195</words>  
She lunged, not for the gun, but for the drummers’ ledger open on the podium. <words>207</words>  
Names glowed there, children whose laughter once soaked these benches, now genetic blueprints in someone’s ledger. <words>223</words>  

The tassel’s owner had stolen more than trinkets; he’d sold their futures. <words>234</words>  
She hurled the vial. <words>237</words>  
Glass shattered, releasing engineered moths that devoured the resin gun mid-air. <words>249</words>  
Her rival laughed, a sound like grinding gears. <words>257</words>  
“You’d burn their legacy to ash?” he asked, circling. <words>266</words>  
“Legacy?” She gestured to the moths now dissolving the ledger. <words>275</words>  
“This is a taxidermy of hope.” <words>280</words>  

The drums faltered as the hall shuddered. <words>285</words>  
Cellulose veins retracted, walls crumbling into nectar-scented sludge. <words>294</words>  
She fled through the theater’s back exit, the tassel disintegrating in her grip, its genetic key spent. <words>308</words>  
Outside, the drummers lay unconscious, their rhythms replaced by sirens. <words>319</words>  
She’d decoded the pattern: the syndicate’s poison, the city’s decay, her own metamorphosis. <words>331</words>  
Yet in the silence, she felt the itch beneath her skin—the synthetic enzymes, now replicating, now hungry. <words>345</words>  

A child’s muffled giggle slipped through a sewer grate. <words>352</words>  
She froze. <words>353</words>  
The syndicate’s next batch of “organic material.” <words>359</words>  
Her revenge had demanded she destroy the system, but the cure required a architect, not a martyr. <words>374</words>  
The diplomat pressed a hand to the grate, her blood humming with stolen cunning. <words>386</words>  
“Jest all you like,” she whispered to the ghosts in the musty air. <words>397</words>  
“You’ll need better thieves.” <words>401</words>  

Beneath the city hall’s collapse, she began digging. <words>408</words>  
The drums had stopped, but her pulse thundered—a new rhythm, a new design. <words>420</words>  
Revenge’s price was a cage of her own DNA, but cages could be repurposed. <words>433</words>  
She smiled, organically synthetic, and got to work. <words>441</words>
