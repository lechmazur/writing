The needle lifted from the cracked vinyl with a final hiss, leaving the wasteland orchard silent—save for the radioactive dust storms gnawing at the gnarled trees. <words>30</words>  
Alyra, the headstrong mage, clutched the stained glass box to her chest, its fractured panes casting prismatic shards over her ash-pale hands. <words>54</words>  
“Ten years since the last song,” she muttered, kicking the dead record player. <words>68</words>  
Its brass horn crumpled, releasing a wisp of glitter—residue from the sequined costume she’d buried her brother in. <words>85</words>  
The glitter clung to her lashes, and for a heartbeat, she saw the world as it once was: orchards bursting with golden apples, skies bluer than sapphire. <words>104</words>  
Now, everything was gray. <words>107</words>  
Even her magic, once vibrant, had dulled to a flicker. <words>116</words>  
But the box—her brother’s final creation—hummed with trapped color. <words>127</words>  
To open it, she needed courage she didn’t have. <words>135</words>  
Courage to confess. <words>137</words>  

A storm howled, its irradiated winds peeling bark from the trees. <words>148</words>  
Alyra crouched, tracing the box’s hinges with trembling fingers. <words>156</words>  
“You wanted me to feminize the world,” she whispered to the memory of her brother, who’d died stitching starlight into gowns while she’d preached pragmatism. <words>177</words>  
“But I called your art frivolous. I let the gray take you.” <words>187</words>  
Glitter stung her eyes—or was it tears? <words>193</words>  
The box’s lid shifted, revealing a hollow filled with swirling pigments. <words>203</words>  

She hesitated. <words>204</words>  
To release the colors would mean admitting her fault in suffocating beauty, in valuing survival over splendor. <words>219</words>  
Her certainty wavered, tenuous as the dust-laden breeze. <words>227</words>  
Yet, when she inhaled, the glitter in her lungs burned like a comet’s tail. <words>238</words>  
“Fine,” she spat, defiance sharpening her voice. <words>244</words>  
“I was wrong. The world needs more than just living—it needs *luster*.” <words>256</words>  

The box erupted. <words>257</words>  
Ribbons of cerulean, crimson, and gold spiraled into the storm, dyeing the radioactive clouds kaleidoscopic. <words>271</words>  
Trees shuddered, their branches sprouting blossoms in hues forgotten. <words>280</words>  
Alyra laughed, bitter and bright. <words>284</words>  
“Merry now?” she asked the ghosts. <words>289</words>  
Her cloak, once drab wool, rippled into a gown of liquid emerald, its hem scattering fresh glitter. <words>303</words>  

But the storm fought back. <words>307</words>  
Gray tendrils strangled the colors, leaching their vitality. <words>315</words>  
Alyra snarled, thrusting her hands skyward. <words>320</words>  
Magic—raw and reckless—surged from her, fusing with the pigments. <words>330</words>  
The orchard ignited. <words>332</words>  
Trees became stained glass monuments, roots crystallizing into mosaics. <words>341</words>  
Even the dust sparkled. <words>344</words>  

When the storm cleared, Alyra stood amid a cathedral of color, her breath ragged. <words>356</words>  
The box lay empty. <words>359</words>  
But the glitter on her skin refused to fade. <words>367</words>  
She smiled, merry bitterness twisting her lips. <words>374</words>  
“One confession,” she said. <words>378</words>  
“A thousand more to go.” <words>382</words>  

Somewhere, a record player crackled to life. <words>388</words>  
And the orchard danced. <words>391</words>
