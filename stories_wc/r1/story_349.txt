The drone pilot’s fingers twitched for a joystick that no longer existed, his flight suit frayed and smeared with ash from a realm where satellites were myths scribbled in grimoires. <words>34</words>  
He’d crash-landed in this medieval hellscape three moons ago, his wings of steel now rusting in the shadow of an abandoned observatory perched on a cliff, its cracked dome gaping at a sky thick with portents. <words>73</words>  
Tonight, beneath that skeletal structure, a speed dating event unfolded—candles flickering in hollowed-out skulls, villagers bartering glances like currency, desperate to kindle hope before dawn’s axe fell on the sacred orchard below. <words>113</words>  
“You smell of burnt circuits and borrowed time,” said the herbalist across the table, her voice a blade sheathed in smoke. <words>135</words>  
She slid a dried herb bundle across the stone slab—thyme, wolfsbane, and something iridescent that hummed. <words>152</words>  
“Disseminate this at the orchard’s edge. The trees’ roots remember mercy.” <words>165</words>  
He laughed, the sound scraping his throat. <words>171</words>  
Cynically hopeful—that’s what he’d become, a man who’d once guided missiles now reduced to bargaining with botany. <words>189</words>  
But her eyes held the weight of horizons, vast and unyielding, and he found himself climbing the observatory’s spiral stairs, herbs clutched like a dead man’s last prayer. <words>217</words>  
The dome’s interior was a cathedral of ruin: telescopes snapped like twigs, star charts peeling into oblivion. <words>234</words>  
Through a fissure in the wall, he glimpsed the orchard—a sea of gnarled trunks, their branches heavy with fruit that glowed faintly, as if swallowing moonlight. <words>259</words>  
Dawn approached, and with it, the lumberjacks’ saws. <words>267</words>  
He crushed the herbs, their scent a green fire in his lungs, and scattered them into the wind. <words>283</words>  
The particles shimmered, becoming a swarm—not insects, but something older, their wings etching sigils into the air. <words>300</words>  
Below, the orchard shuddered. <words>304</words>  
Bark split, not from axes, but to reveal new saplings coiled within, erupting skyward in a crescendo of sap and defiance. <words>325</words>  
The herbalist appeared beside him, her hand brushing his—a touch that crackled like static. <words>340</words>  
“You mistook this realm for a prison,” she said. <words>348</words>  
“But despair is just possibility, inverted.” <words>355</words>  
In the observatory’s broken lens, he saw his drone’s carcass twitch, vines threading through its gears, birthing a new kind of flight. <words>377</words>  
Charred serenity settled over the cliff—a peace forged not from absence of fire, but from the phoenix marrow within it. <words>397</words>  
When the villagers came, they found the trees undiminished, their fruit blushing with a light that mirrored the stars. <words>417</words>  
The pilot stayed, rebuilding the observatory’s telescopes to chart not celestial bodies, but the spaces between them—where mercy, he now knew, hid its seeds. <words>445</words>
