<story>  
The brittle branch snapped in the silent forest, its crack echoing through the dwarves’ underground city like a thunderclap. <words>20</words>  
Lysandra, the gentle conjurer, flinched, her hands trembling as she cradled the shards of the stained glass butterfly—its wings shattered by a century of neglect. <words>43</words>  
“Justice,” she whispered, though the word tasted foreign; the garden she sought to rebuild had been forgotten even by the dwarves who carved this labyrinth of gemstone halls. <words>69</words>  
Yet the butterfly’s fractured hues glimmered inscrutably obvious, each shard reflecting runes only visible when held upside-down. <words>88</words>  
Reversed messages, she realized—instructions etched by the garden’s last keeper, a dwarf who’d buried truth in plain sight. <words>106</words>  
Her laughter bubbled, edged with terror, as she began to reassemble the puzzle, her magic stitching light between glass shards. <words>124</words>  
The cavern trembled; stone roots erupted, thorned and hungry, as if the city itself resisted remembrance. <words>138</words>  
Lysandra danced between them, her joy a shield. <words>145</words>  
“You fear justice?” she sang to the shadows, her voice weaving spells into the butterfly’s glowing seams. <words>161</words>  
The final shard clicked into place, and the creature shuddered, its wings casting prismatic warnings across the walls: *Beware the cost of rebirth*. <words>183</words>  
Undeterred, Lysandra followed the light into the heart of the mountain, where the garden’s skeleton lay—petrified roses, soil like ash. <words>202</words>  
The butterfly alighted on a dead oak, and the runes reversed again, their message now a command: *Break to mend*. <words>220</words>  
She shattered the glass once more, each fragment piercing the earth, and the ground screamed. <words>234</words>  
Vines erupted, vibrant and vicious, snaring her ankles as blossoms devoured the rot. <words>246</words>  
Terror clawed her throat, but her grin widened—this was alive, this was *right*. <words>259</words>  
The dwarves’ ghosts materialized, their faces molten stone. <words>267</words>  
“You resurrect what was sentenced to die,” they boomed. <words>275</words>  
“You hid its crime,” she countered, her magic flaring. <words>284</words>  
The garden’s memory unfolded: a king poisoned its roots to seize the dwarves’ gold, and they, in grief, entombed both sin and sanctuary. <words>305</words>  
The butterfly’s light swelled, searing the lies from the walls, revealing gold veins—blood money—beneath the soil. <words>323</words>  
Lysandra wove the vines into a loom, threading them with glass and gold, until the garden pulsed with vengeful life. <words>342</words>  
Trees bore jeweled fruit, their cores humming with the dwarf king’s trapped breath. <words>354</words>  
Justice, she understood, was not kindness—it was restoration, ruthless and radiant. <words>367</words>  
The cavern groaned, crumbling, as the forest above stirred, its silence shattered by birdsong. <words>380</words>  
Lysandra fled, the butterfly now a brooch on her cloak, its wings whispering reversed elegies for the dead. <words>396</words>  
Behind her, the mountain collapsed, burying greed and ghosts alike, while the garden burst through the surface, its wild tendrils cradling the broken forest. <words>419</words>  
At the edge of the verdant ruin, Lysandra knelt, planting a single glass shard in the soil. <words>434</words>  
“Grow,” she murmured, and laughed, tears gleaming, as the earth trembled—not in fear, but in hope. <words>450</words>  
Above, the brittle branch healed, its new leaves shimmering like stained glass. <words>461</words>
