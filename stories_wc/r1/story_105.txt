In the hush of a half-lit corridor, the outcast scholar pressed her palm against the damp wall, counting tiles until her fingers found the loose one—third from the ceiling, cracked like a liar’s smile. <words>34</words> Behind it lay diaries bound in moth-eaten velvet, their pages whispering secrets about the witch’s flying carpet garage, where mechanical looms wove rugs from stormclouds and spider silk. <words>68</words> She’d spent years dismissed as a madwoman for claiming midnight wasn’t eternal, but tonight, she’d prove it—if the diaries’ instructions held true. <words>95</words>  

The garage hummed with latent magic, its air thick with the scent of ozone and dried lavender. <words>112</words> Between hovering carpets, she spotted her prize: a seashell etched with a spiraling symbol that seemed to pulse, strangely trustworthy despite the way it mirrored her unease. <words>138</words> According to the diaries, it could reflect the soul’s shape—a key to unraveling the curse that stretched darkness like taffy over the city. <words>166</words> But as she lifted the shell, a jolt seared her fingertips, and the room erupted in kaleidoscopic light. <words>186</words>  

Shadows writhed into figures—her own face, fractured into a hundred versions: the child ridiculed for talking to stars, the academic exiled for heresy, the woman who’d buried her mother alone under a moonless sky. <words>225</words> “Mirroring the soul,” the witch had written, “requires confronting what it feeds on.” <words>238</words> The scholar clenched the shell, its edges drawing blood as she hissed, “Midnight only lasts so long.” <words>256</words>  

The carpets shuddered, threads snapping as the garage’s enchantments buckled. <words>266</words> Through the chaos, she glimpsed the witch’s final entry: the symbol wasn’t a lock, but a compass—one that demanded sacrifice. <words>287</words> Teeth gritted, she smashed the shell against the loom. <words>297</words> Light exploded, and for a breathless moment, she was everywhere: stitching dawn into the carpets’ fraying edges, her scars glowing like seams of gold. <words>322</words>  

When the silence settled, the scholar stood amid fallen tapestries, dawn’s first blush seeping through the cracks. <words>341</words> The shell, now dust, clung to her like ash. <words>350</words> Outside, streetlamps dimmed as birds tested hesitant songs. <words>361</words> She laughed, sharp and trembling—part triumph, part grief—for the diaries had warned that mirrors show truths, not solutions. <words>383</words> Yet the sky blushed pink, and in that frantic peace, she cradled the remains of the spell, whispering, “See? Even shadows tire.” <words>407</words>  

A tile clattered in the corridor—someone would come investigating. <words>418</words> But for now, she leaned into the warmth bleeding through the broken roof, counting seconds until the next midnight. <words>438</words> It would return, yes, but never again endless. <words>447</words> And that, she thought, was enough light to keep walking. <words>458</words>
