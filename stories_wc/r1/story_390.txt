The calm assassin known as Crane balanced a botanical press atop a moonlit windowsill, its iron screws gleaming like misplaced teeth in the ancient Chinese palace’s shadow. <words>28</words> Around him, the air hummed with whispers of longing—not metaphorical sighs, but literal, chittering voices trapped in the petals he’d stolen from the imperial gardens. <words>54</words> “Figuratively literal,” the palace’s astrologer had warned, “like a riddle that bites.” <words>69</words> Crane hadn’t laughed then, but he did now, softly, as a peony in the press whimpered about unrequited sunlight. <words>87</words>  

His mission, should he avoid beheading: amalgamate the petals’ mournful magic into a poison that mimicked the pattern of a butterfly’s wings—chaotic, precise, and fatal to the emperor’s overcurious chancellor. <words>117</words> The prophecy scribbled on Crane’s sleeve (“A monarch’s doubt births a dynasty’s fall”) wasn’t a prediction but an ingredient list; raw possibility required delicate spinning. <words>141</words> He tightened the press, and the petals squeaked. <words>147</words>  

A eunuch’s giggle echoed down the corridor—humorous unease, Crane decided, was the palace’s default aroma, somewhere between lotus soup and panic. <words>170</words> He dipped a brush into the press’s oozing sap, tracing a butterfly’s erratic flight onto rice paper. <words>184</words> Each stroke hissed. <words>186</words> Each curve was a math problem solved by whimsy. <words>195</words> “Symmetry’s for amateurs,” he muttered, recalling the astrologer’s lesson: “Murder, like love, demands flair.” <words>212</words>  

The whispers crescendoed. <words>213</words> A chrysanthemum wailed about unkissed dew; a magnolia crooned for a bee’s embrace. <words>226</words> Crane sighed. <words>227</words> Sentimental flora complicated everything. <words>230</words> He flicked the paper, now shimmering with venomous ink, and grinned as the butterfly twitched to life, its wings a Rorschach blot of doom. <words>253</words> “Deliver this to the chancellor’s teacup,” he told it, “and try not to flirt with the porcelain.” <words>270</words>  

The butterfly fluttered off, leaving Crane to scrub the press before the first question was asked—the one that would doom him if the chancellor survived to utter it. <words>296</words> He’d just pocketed a complaining orchid when a voice sliced through the night: “Why does the garden sound like a heartbroken choir?” <words>318</words>  

The crown princess stood in the doorway, her brow arched higher than the palace rooftops. <words>333</words> Crane bowed, pressing the orchid’s mouth shut with his thumb. <words>343</words> “Your Highness hears the wind’s poetry,” he said. <words>352</words> “Or perhaps the ghosts of poor landscaping choices.” <words>361</words>  

She stepped closer, her sleeve brushing the press. <words>368</words> “You’re the one who talks to flowers.” <words>375</words>  

“And they talk back,” Crane admitted. <words>380</words> “Mostly complaints. <words>382</words> Horticulture’s a melodrama.” <words>386</words>  

The princess smirked. <words>388</words> “The chancellor claims butterflies are omens. <words>395</words> Should I be worried?” <words>398</words>  

Crane’s pulse stayed steady. <words>402</words> Calm was his religion, assassinations his hymns. <words>409</words> “Only if they start charging for prophecies,” he said. <words>419</words>  

Somewhere beyond the palace walls, a teacup shattered. <words>428</words> The princess opened her mouth—the first question, poised like a dagger—but Crane was already gone, a shadow dissolving into the punchline of his own joke. <words>455</words>
