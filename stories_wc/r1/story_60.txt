The indifferent blacksmith descended into the maze-like catacombs beneath the grand cathedral, his calloused fingers brushing the damp stone as the last bell’s echo faded. <words>34</words> He carried a burlap sack filled with objects: a chipped teacup, a child’s wooden horse, and a faded ribbon, its crimson threads bleached to the hue of dried blood. <words>66</words> Each relic whispered a story he’d rather forget, but the covenant demanded payment in memories. <words>84</words> Above, the next bell would toll at dawn; between bells, the veil thinned, and the unknown listened. <words>101</words>  

The air thickened with the scent of wet earth and iron, the catacombs’ walls etched with symbols that pulsed faintly, as though breathing. <words>123</words> The blacksmith halted at a crossroads, his lantern casting jagged shadows, and let out a haw—a sharp, guttural cry that scattered the rats skittering in the dark. <words>148</words> A low rumble answered, stone grinding against stone as a hidden passage yawned open, revealing a chamber littered with rubble. <words>168</words> Amid the debris, a pedestal stood intact, its surface carved with a spiral that seemed to twist when stared at too long. <words>190</words>  

He emptied his sack onto the pedestal, arranging the objects with mechanical precision. <words>203</words> The ribbon snagged on a splintered edge, unfurling like a tongue to reveal stitches spelling a name: *Elara*. <words>222</words> His jaw tightened. <words>224</words> She had tied it in her hair before the cathedral’s spire collapsed, before he’d clawed his way from the rubble, uniquely natural in his refusal to die. <words>247</words> The memory was a hook in his ribs, but he’d learned to let it ache. <words>261</words>  

From his belt, he drew a dagger forged from meteoric iron, its edge glinting blue. <words>276</words> The covenant required blood, yes, but also truth—a confession woven into the relics’ tales. <words>293</words> He pressed the blade to his palm. <words>299</words> “I survived,” he muttered, letting his blood drip onto the spiral. <words>311</words> “But I didn’t save her.” <words>316</words>  

The chamber shuddered. <words>318</words> The relics glowed, their shadows stretching into phantoms that reenacted fragments of lives: a mother sipping tea, a boy galloping his toy horse, Elara laughing as the ribbon fluttered in her hair. <words>352</words> The blacksmith watched, his indifference a fraying shield. <words>363</words> When the visions faded, the spiral split open, revealing a void that hummed with static hunger. <words>381</words>  

“Take them,” he said. <words>384</words> “But leave me the weight.” <words>388</words> The void rippled, a soundless agreement, and the relics dissolved into ash. <words>404</words> As the dawn bell clanged above, the blacksmith climbed back through the rubble, the ribbon’s ghost coiled in his fist, a covenant sealed in mystic simplicity. <words>430</words> He would forge again tomorrow. <words>435</words> Today, he let the ache remain. <words>441</words>
