The uptight scribe adjusted his wire-rimmed spectacles, fingers trembling as he unwrapped the prototype light bulb from its oilcloth shroud—a relic pilfered from Tesla’s workshop, still humming with residual current. <words>34</words> Around him, the witch’s greenhouse exhaled damp heat, glass panes dripping condensation onto gravestones that clung to the hillside like crooked teeth. <words>64</words> He’d come here, certainly uncertain, chasing whispers of a cure for the silence gnawing at his brother’s throat—a silence born of his own failure to bellow the truth when it mattered. <words>100</words>  

The envelope had arrived weeks ago, its seal cracked but adhesive still clinging to secrets: a formula for “resonant empathy,” Tesla’s scrawl insisted, detectable only by analyzing the glue’s chemical decay. <words>135</words> Now, under the greenhouse’s emerald gloom, the scribe pressed the bulb’s base to a tarnished socket, its filament flickering to life with a sound like puzzle pieces snapping into place. <words>170</words> Vines recoiled from the light, revealing a workbench strewn with alembics and a single photograph—his brother, smiling before the accident that stole his voice. <words>199</words>  

“You’re late,” rasped the witch, her silhouette framed by carnivorous blossoms. <words>215</words> She thrust a vial of iridescent liquid toward him. <words>224</words> “The adhesive’s essence—amplified. It’ll fuse machine and memory, if you’ve the steel to cradle it.” <words>243</words> The scribe hesitated, his meticulous mind recoiling at the chaos of magic. <words>257</words> Yet beneath the dread, buried optimism writhed: what if certainty wasn’t required, only courage to embrace the quiet transformation? <words>280</words>  

He drank the vial. <words>283</words> The greenhouse shuddered as the bulb’s glow intensified, projecting spectral equations onto the glass—Tesla’s calculations merging with the witch’s runes. <words>308</words> Memories surged: his brother’s laughter, the crash of the laboratory fire, his own voice trapped behind clenched teeth. <words>329</words> The scribe stumbled, gripping the workbench as the light pulsed in time with his heartbeat. <words>347</words>  

Then, a bellow—not from him, but the earth itself. <words>357</words> Graves shifted outside, roots cracking stone as the hill awakened. <words>368</words> The witch grinned. <words>370</words> “Empathy’s not a whisper. It’s a quake.” <words>378</words> The scribe gasped as the bulb exploded, not in shards but in liquid gold, swirling into a sphere that mirrored his brother’s face. <words>402</words>  

When the light faded, the greenhouse stood unchanged—yet the scribe’s hands, once ink-stained and rigid, now cradled the sphere with deliberate gentleness. <words>428</words> Somewhere, his brother would be waiting. <words>435</words> And this time, the scribe would speak. <words>442</words>
