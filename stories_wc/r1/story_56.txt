<story>  
The reclaimed orchard farmland sprawled across the toppled skyscraper’s carcass, its steel ribs cradling peach trees that clawed toward fractured windows. <words>34</words>  
Jules leaned against a rusted elevator shaft, their posture energetically lethargic—a slouch that hid coiled readiness, fingers drumming a staccato on the blank price tag pinned to their moth-eaten blazer. <words>67</words>  
“Antique soil,” they drawled to passersby, gesturing to burlap sacks of dirt, “guaranteed to magnetize prosperity… or your regrets refunded.” <words>90</words>  
No one bought the grift, but the lie felt lighter than the truth festering in their throat. <words>106</words>  
A breeze stirred, and Jules’ invisible allies hissed through the leaves—voices only they could hear, murmuring *“Soon”* in tones of gentle harshness, like wind scraping over honey. <words>135</words>  
The skyscraper’s old server room, now a root-tangled shed, hummed as its frozen computer wheezed back to life, screens flickering. <words>155</words>  
Jules stiffened. <words>156</words>  
The reboot would unseal files exposing how the tower’s collapse wasn’t an accident, but corporate arson to bury the orchard’s heritage. <words>177</words>  
Their chest ached; truth was a bone they’d choked on for years. <words>189</words>  
A book thudded at their feet—*The Ecology of Deception*—dropped by a woman in mud-caked boots, her glare sharp as she knelt to retrieve it. <words>214</words>  
“Swindling’s bad karma,” she said, nodding to Jules’ price tag. <words>224</words>  
“Karma’s a blank check,” Jules countered, tossing her a peach. <words>235</words>  
She caught it, hesitated, then bit in. <words>241</words>  
“Lena,” she mumbled, juice dripping. <words>246</words>  
“Jules. You here for the peaches or the ghosts?” <words>254</words>  
Lena’s eyes narrowed. <words>257</words>  
“The servers. I need data on the collapse.” <words>265</words>  
The computer’s fans roared like a revived beast. <words>274</words>  
Jules’ invisible allies wailed—*“Stop her!”*—but Lena was already striding toward the shed. <words>291</words>  
Panic surged; Jules lunged, their lethargy shattered. <words>299</words>  
They magnetized the door’s padlock with a flick of their wrist, a parlor trick learned from a carnival psychic. <words>317</words>  
Lena yanked the handle, stuck. <words>321</words>  
“You’re hiding something,” she said, turning. <words>328</words>  
“Hiding *for* someone,” Jules breathed. <words>335</words>  
The orchard’s founders—their grandparents—had been erased when the tower fell. <words>347</words>  
Lena stepped closer. <words>350</words>  
“The files prove it was intentional. Let me help.” <words>360</words>  
Jules’ laugh frayed. <words>363</words>  
“Help’s a fairy tale. I bare truths, people run.” <words>374</words>  
“I’m here.” Lena gripped their wrist, warm as sunlight. <words>385</words>  
The server screens blazed awake, documents spilling across monitors—blueprints, emails, a cover-up etched in pixels. <words>405</words>  
Jules’ knees buckled; Lena steadied them. <words>412</words>  
Together, they stood in the skyscraper’s corpse, the orchard’s roots knotting around secrets, as the invisible allies sighed relief. <words>433</words>  
“Now what?” Lena asked. <words>436</words>  
Jules peeled the blank price tag off their blazer and pressed it into her palm. <words>448</words>  
“We set the cost.” <words>452</words>  
Above, a peach blossom drifted through broken glass, gentle as a verdict, harsh as hope. <words>468</words>
