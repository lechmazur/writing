Lena’s fingers trembled as she fastened the plain cameo brooch—her grandmother’s final gift—beneath her factory uniform, its ivory surface cold against her collarbone. <words>27</words> The assembly line’s hum faded as she slipped into the corridor no one dared walk, its walls etched with equations only her family’s “academically wild” minds could decipher. <words>55</words> For generations, they’d hidden cosmic truths behind mundane lives, their ritual of binding starlight into bloodline duty now a cage Lena meant to shatter. <words>83</words>  

At the corridor’s end, moonlight spilled through a wrought-iron gate, revealing the gargoyle-guarded terrace suspended over a bottomless abyss. <words>104</words> Stone wings creaked as one beast tilted its head, whispering in a language older than factories: *Review the pact.* <words>124</words> Lena gripped the brooch, its hidden constellation map pulsing—her grandmother’s voice urging her to disregard the footprints left by doubt, those fossilized fears of failing tradition. <words>151</words>  

“I’m not here to repeat your stories,” she told the gargoyles, their eyes like dying stars. <words>168</words> The factory’s expectations—clocking in, shrinking miracles into button-making—had suffocated her, but here, chaos fizzed in her veins. <words>187</words> She unclasped the brooch, pricking her thumb on its pin; blood smeared the cameo, igniting equations that spiraled into a vortex above the abyss. <words>209</words>  

The ritual demanded sacrifice: her obedience. <words>213</words> Lena laughed, sharp and unbound, as cosmic threads erupted from her hands, weaving through the gargoyles’ stony snarls. <words>230</words> They lunged, but she danced between them, her movements an ordered disarray—factory-trained precision colliding with supernova recklessness. <words>248</words>  

One gargoyle snapped, “You’ll unravel everything!” <words>254</words>  
“Good,” Lena hissed, tearing a thread from the vortex—a lineage of silenced women flickering in its glow. <words>271</words> Her grandmother had mapped galaxies on napkins, then burned them; her mother had muted her voice to fit assembly-line quotas. <words>289</words> Lena would not. <words>290</words>  

She hurled the brooch into the abyss. <words>295</words> The gargoyles froze as the cameo shattered, releasing trapped starlight that fused with Lena’s fury. <words>311</words> The terrace trembled, equations rewriting themselves in her wake—no longer rules, but possibilities. <words>329</words>  

When the abyss roared, she roared back, her cosmic threads binding the gargoyles into statues once more. <words>346</words> Below, the factory’s lights blinked out, machines stuttering as Lena’s power surged—a supernova in coveralls. <words>363</words>  

At dawn, she stood at the terrace’s edge, breathing air that tasted of iron and infinity. <words>378</words> The brooch’s fragments glinted far below, alongside doubt’s footprints, dissolving into stardust. <words>393</words> Let others walk safe corridors; she’d carve new ones. <words>402</words>  

Lena stepped into the abyss—not falling, but *unfolding*, her laughter echoing through generations as the cosmos welcomed its wildest architect. <words>422</words> Behind her, the gargoyles cracked, their whispers crumbling into the wind: *She reviewed the pact. She rewrote it.* <words>442</words>  

The factory would call her absence a tragedy. <words>447</words>  
Lena called it a beginning. <words>451</words>
