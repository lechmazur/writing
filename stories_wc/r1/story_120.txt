The quantum tunnel hummed like a broken refrigerator, its iridescent walls throbbing in time with the paramedic’s exhausted heartbeat. <words>20</words>  
“Again?” she muttered, glancing at the cracked face of her watch as the bell’s echo—a relic from the elementary school that once stood here—sliced through the air, marking another forgotten recess. <words>43</words>  
Her boots crunched over glass shards as she stepped into the tunnel’s glow, the weathered fishing lure in her pocket digging into her thigh like a reproach. <words>63</words>  
It had been her father’s, its red feathers frayed from decades of casting lines into lakes he’d never named, and now it anchored her to a loop she couldn’t escape. <words>84</words>  
She’d lost count of how many times she’d relived this moment: the flicker of the tunnel, the metallic tang of static, the way her lungs seized as time folded. <words>102</words>  
But this cycle felt different—a prickling, impatient energy beneath her skin, a restlessness she’d call “excited boredom” if anyone ever asked. <words>121</words>  
No one did. <words>124</words>  
The world dissolved into fractals, then reassembled as a rain-soaked street where a boy lay motionless, his bicycle twisted like a modern art sculpture. <words>144</words>  
Same victim, same futile CPR, same hollow stare from the crowd. <words>153</words>  
Except today, a raindrop struck her forehead with surgical precision, its sound—a single, crystalline *plink*—echoing louder than the sirens. <words>169</words>  
Her hands froze mid-compression. <words>173</words>  
The boy’s pupils dilated, reflecting not her face, but the tunnel’s spiraling light. <words>184</words>  
“Find the nest,” he whispered, bloodless lips barely moving. <words>193</words>  
Then he flatlined, as always. <words>197</words>  
Back in the tunnel, she clawed at the walls, her mind snagging on the word *nest*. <words>210</words>  
A memory surfaced: her father’s hands, gnarled as oak roots, knotting fishing line while humming a hymn she’d later heard at his funeral. <words>229</words>  
“Privately public,” he’d called their ritual, though she’d never understood why—until now. <words>242</words>  
The lure. <words>243</words>  
The raindrop. <words>245</words>  
The nest wasn’t a place but a paradox, a wound dressed as routine. <words>257</words>  
She sprinted toward the tunnel’s heart, where light congealed into something solid. <words>269</words>  
There, suspended in the haze, hung a cradle of fractured timelines—a nest woven from every trauma she’d buried. <words>285</words>  
Her mother’s empty pill bottles, the boy’s unblinking eyes, the way her father’s coffin had gleamed like a trout’s belly under February rain. <words>304</words>  
The lure vibrated in her palm, its hook catching the nest’s threads. <words>315</words>  
“Baptize this,” she laughed, wild and raw, and plunged the relic into the nucleus. <words>328</words>  
Light erupted, not in a blaze, but a sigh—a thousand raindrops whispering secrets as they fell. <words>343</words>  
The boy’s death unspooled, replaced by a memory she’d amputated: her father weeping in his boat, confessing he’d never wanted children, his words dissolving into the lake’s mirror. <words>366</words>  
She’d hated him for that. <words>370</words>  
Hated herself more for understanding. <words>375</words>  
The tunnel shuddered, its walls peeling back to reveal the schoolyard at golden hour, the bell now silent. <words>392</words>  
In her pocket, the lure disintegrated into ash and feathers. <words>402</words>  
When the next raindrop fell, she opened her mouth to taste it—salt and ozone and absolution. <words>417</words>  
The crowd dispersed, unnoticed. <words>421</words>  
Somewhere, a bird she couldn’t name began to sing. <words>430</words>
