<story>  
The homeless philosopher-king wandered the sandstone labyrinth, his weather-beaten kaleidoscope clutched like a scepter, its fractured lenses reflecting floating lanterns that cast riddles in amber light. <words>34</words>  
Once, he’d ruled a kingdom of reason, until a transformative betrayal—a trusted advisor poisoning his wine with paradoxes—left him exiled, craving the labyrinth’s rumored truth at its heart. <words>73</words>  
Now, he schemed earnestly frivolous: smuggling confetti-coded proposals into random weddings, where revelers mistook his riddles for toast jokes. <words>96</words>  
Each scrap bore a geometric plea, urging guests to “extend kindness eastward” or “marry mercy to limestone,” directives only the labyrinth’s walls would decrypt. <words>123</words>  
Tonight, during the readings of vows, he’d hidden his final clue inside a bouquet’s ribbon—a prismatic fold stating, “Kiss the sky’s crooked teeth.” <words>147</words>  
The labyrinth demanded such nonsense; its arches reshaped themselves whenever someone spoke in straight lines. <words>164</words>  
Lanterns bobbed like drunken stars as the king pressed his kaleidoscope to one eye, aligning constellations only he could parse. <words>184</words>  
A child’s laughter echoed—a bride had tossed his confetti skyward, and the pieces stuck, forming a tessellated bridge across a chasm he’d circled for weeks. <words>210</words>  
“Complex simplicity,” he muttered, stepping onto the glowing path as sandstone sighed into new contours. <words>225</words>  
His betrayal had taught him this: every lie contains a map, if you dare to read it backward. <words>240</words>  
The advisor’s poison, he now realized, had been the cure for certainty, dissolving his rigid logic into kaleidoscopic doubt. <words>258</words>  
Wedding bells chimed in the distance, their sound warping into a chorus of whispers from the labyrinth’s heart. <words>275</words>  
He followed, extending his hand to brush a floating lantern—its heat seared his palm, imprinting a sigil that matched the confetti’s code. <words>297</words>  
“Ah,” he breathed, “to solve a maze, you must become its jest.” <words>308</words>  
The walls tightened, then ruptured into bloom, sandstone petals revealing a chamber where his kaleidoscope’s reflection fused with a thousand lanterns. <words>330</words>  
There, etched in light, was the advisor’s face—not smirking, but weeping, trapped in the prison of his own unbroken logic. <words>351</words>  
The king laughed, a sound like shattered glass, and tossed his kaleidoscope into the air. <words>366</words>  
It hung, spinning, refracting the lanterns into a single beam that ignited the confetti strewn across weddings in seven cities. <words>387</words>  
Guests gasped as paper embers coalesced into words: “The exit is the entrance, forgiven.” <words>401</words>  
The labyrinth shuddered, its walls dissolving into sand that filled the king’s pockets, heavy as regret. <words>418</words>  
He walked east, following the warmth of the sigil on his hand, until dawn revealed not a desert, but a village where children chased prismatic shadows—his confetti, eternal. <words>443</words>  
They called him the Ribbon King, though he owned nothing but his breath, and the labyrinth’s echo, now a song. <words>460</words>  
At every wedding, he’d slip in, drop a coded scrap, and vanish, still earnestly frivolous, still puzzling. <words>478</words>  
For he knew: some truths only hold when scattered. <words>487</words>  
And the unsolvable, when loved, becomes a home. <words>496</words>
