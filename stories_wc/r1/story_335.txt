<story>The collapsed cathedral’s fractured ribs arched like a skeletal hand clawing at the dusk, its vaulted ceiling replaced by a mosaic of graffiti constellations. <words>28</words> Kael, the shaky mercenary, traced the tremor in his left hand along the amber chunk in his pocket—its golden prison holding a spider mid-scuttle, a relic from a life buried under ash and artillery fire. <words>61</words> He’d followed rumor chains thinner than cobwebs to this ruin: artists whispered of a man who traded “fossilized time” for secrets, and Kael needed both. <words>88</words> The cathedral’s nave teemed with street painters and drifters, their murals bleeding across stone—angels with neon wings, saints with shattered faces—all lit by strung bulbs flickering like dying stars. <words>122</words>  

“Carefully reckless,” he muttered, a mantra from his sniper days, as he sidestepped a dancer twirling fire chains. <words>141</words> Reckless enough to chase myths; careful enough to count exits. <words>152</words> His past was a landmine field—every step risked detonation, but the amber promised answers, maybe absolution. <words>170</words> A vendor with ink-stained fingers pointed him to the apse, where a figure cloaked in patchwork velvet stood before a mural of a spiderweb spanning continents. <words>196</words>  

“Finalize the deal, or fade,” the velvet man said, voice like rusted gears. <words>208</words> Kael’s hand steadied as he placed the amber on a paint-splattered crate. <words>220</words> “I need the story behind this. Who trapped it? Why?” <words>230</words> The man laughed, revealing teeth stained by betel nut. <words>238</words> “You hunt the unknown? It’s a widow’s heirloom, smuggled from a warzone—souls stick to resin better than memory.” <words>257</words>  

Kael’s breath hitched. <words>259</words> The warzone was his warzone, the ash his ash. <words>268</words> The spider, maybe, was hers—the nurse who’d saved him before the bombs finalized her fate. <words>283</words> He’d fled her grave; the amber was her unanswered letter. <words>294</words> Around them, artists began extinguishing lights, the hour dissolving into blue-dark. <words>307</words>  

“Take it,” the velvet man said, pushing the amber back. <words>317</words> “Some searches end where they start.” <words>324</words> Kael’s tremor returned, violent now, as if the spider stirred. <words>335</words> He stumbled into the courtyard, where a girl spray-painted galaxies onto rubble. <words>347</words> Dawn bled at the edges of the sky, but the echo of midnight lingered. <words>360</words>  

Here, in the slow fade between echoes, he gripped the amber until his palm bled. <words>376</words> The spider’s shadow seemed to stretch, weaving through his pulse—not a prisoner, but a compass. <words>392</words> He’d carried her ghost like shrapnel; now, it pointed somewhere beyond the cathedral, beyond the rumors. <words>410</words>  

Kael left as street artists ignited a bonfire of pallet wood and old canvases. <words>424</words> Flakes of ash, familiar and soft, kissed his cheeks. <words>434</words> He didn’t look back. <words>437</words> The amber warmed in his grip, no longer a weight but a thread—through the unknown, toward peace, one carefully reckless step at a time. <words>460</words></story>
