Zara tightened her diving helmet, the pressurized hiss echoing like a whispered secret as she descended into the abyss, her welding torch casting jagged shadows across the sunken oil rig. <words>28</words>  
Her hands, calloused from years of sealing cracks in the ocean’s underbelly, trembled—not from cold, but from the memory of the vintage button box she’d found lodged in the rig’s corroded beams last week. <words>56</words>  
Its mother-of-pearl tiles had glowed faintly underwater, as if holding starlight captive, and now it sat in her locker, humming with a rhythm that synced to her pulse. <words>81</words>  

Above the surface, the abandoned Halcyon Planetarium loomed, its cracked dome now a neon-lit nightclub where timelines bled into each other like ink in water. <words>105</words>  
Zara frequented it nightly, drawn by the mirrors lining its walls—antique shop relics that flickered with glimpses of a world where the rig had never sunk, where her father hadn’t vanished into the same depths she now welded. <words>138</words>  
The club’s owner, a woman with opal eyes and a voice like static, called it “the crossing,” a place where past and future clawed at the present. <words>160</words>  

“Patiently impatient,” the woman had chided Zara last night, tracing the button box’s patterns with a nail sharp as a blade. <words>181</words>  
“Power isn’t seized—it’s pampered.” <words>187</words>  
Zara hadn’t understood until the box’s lid sprang open in her hands today, revealing not buttons but constellations, their shapes shifting like live wires. <words>210</words>  
Now, as she welded a fissure in the rig, the ocean shuddered, and the club’s mirrors materialized underwater, their reflections showing her father welding beside her—alive, here, in a timeline that shouldn’t exist. <words>243</words>  

She reached for him, but the vision unraveled, replaced by the opal-eyed woman smirking in the mirror. <words>259</words>  
“You’re straddling the rift,” the woman said, her form flickering between young and ancient. <words>276</words>  
“Wield the box, and you’ll mend both worlds. Hesitate, and they’ll snap.” <words>291</words>  

Back at the club, Zara placed the box on the bar, its constellations now bleeding light onto the counter. <words>309</words>  
The mirrors pulsed, showing her father trapped in a loop of drowning, the rig collapsing endlessly around him. <words>327</words>  
“Pamper it,” the woman repeated, pressing Zara’s palm to the box. <words>339</words>  
“Feed it your resolve.” <words>344</words>  

Zara inhaled, focusing on the memory of her father teaching her to weld—steady hands, patience sharper than flame. <words>363</words>  
The box’s stars flared, stitching the fractured timelines into a single thread. <words>378</words>  
The planetarium’s dome groaned overhead, its cracks sealing as constellations realigned, merging past and present. <words>396</words>  

In the final mirror, her father stood beside the restored rig, nodding. <words>408</words>  
The opal-eyed woman vanished, leaving Zara alone with the box, now silent, its power spent. <words>424</words>  
As dawn bled through the dome, the club’s patrons stirred, unaware of the worlds salvaged in the night. <words>443</words>  
Zara pocketed the box, its weight familiar now—a tool, not a mystery, though the ocean’s whispers still carried her father’s gratitude, faint as a heartbeat. <words>469</words>  
She stepped into the light, a welder of more than metal, her inheritance no longer a ghost but a compass. <words>490</words>
