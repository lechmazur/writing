<story>  
The tidal power monitoring station hummed like a sleeping giant, its generators groaning under the weight of the moon’s pull as seawater sloshed against the dock. <words>30</words>  
Emmett, a gambler whose optimism outmatched his intuition, traced the grooves of a rustic candle mold with grease-stained fingers, its iron teeth biting into his palm. <words>53</words>  
He’d stolen it from Professor Veyra’s midnight lecture—the third this week—where the unhinged engineer had raved about “unspoken bargains” between humanity and the tides, her voice cracking like static. <words>85</words>  
“Energy’s a debt,” she’d hissed, chalk snapping against a blackboard diagram of the station’s failing turbines. “You think they’ll let us owe forever?” <words>104</words>  

Tonight, during the engineers’ candlelit dinner in the mess hall, Emmett would bet his stolen mold against a jar of reactor-grade cesium wax. <words>128</words>  
The game was five-card stud; the stakes, rarely predictable. <words>138</words>  
But he needed that wax—to seal the mold, to forge a candle that could, according to Veyra’s manic scribblings, “capture one last spark before oblivion.” <words>163</words>  

Salt wind whipped through the dock’s corroded railings as Emmett met his mark: Kael, a technician whose smirk always arrived before his words. <words>188</words>  
They played atop a crate stamped with hazard symbols, the cards sticky with kelp residue. <words>204</words>  
“You’re bargaining with ghosts,” Kael said, laying down a queen of hearts. <words>218</words>  
Emmett’s pulse quickened. He’d never learned when to fold. <words>229</words>  

By midnight, the wax was his. <words>234</words>  
In the station’s basement, he poured it into the mold, its crevices shaped like tidal charts. <words>251</words>  
Veyra’s lectures echoed in his skull—*Revolt against entropy. Steal fire from the drowning.* <words>266</words>  
When the candle solidified, he carried it to the control room, its flame trembling in the breath of humming machines. <words>287</words>  

Alarms blared. <words>288</words>  
The station’s core, overburdened by the spring tide, was critical. <words>299</words>  
Engineers scrambled, but Emmett stood transfixed as the candle’s flame stretched toward a ventilation duct, bending as if tugged by invisible currents. <words>326</words>  
*Follow the spark.* <words>329</words>  

He ran to the dock, candle raised like a lantern, its light skittering over black waves. <words>345</words>  
There, in the water’s heaving darkness, something glinted—a fissure of greenish radiance, rising. <words>363</words>  
Veyra’s bargain. <words>365</words>  
The sea’s own fire. <words>369</words>  

Laughing, Emmett plunged his hand into the glow, tears cutting through the salt on his cheeks. <words>385</words>  
The candle flared, its wax hissing as it fused with the light, and for a heartbeat, the station’s sirens dimmed. <words>405</words>  
Then the mold cracked. <words>408</words>  
The spark winked out. <words>411</words>  

Kael found him later, staring at the smoldering iron shell. <words>422</words>  
“Next time,” the technician said, pocketing the mold, “bet smarter.” <words>434</words>  
But Emmett, still tasting laughter and brine, wondered if “next time” was another gamble he’d already lost. <words>456</words>  
Above them, the station’s lights flickered—mocking, alive, unbearably human. <words>471</words>
