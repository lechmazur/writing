The mild-tempered guard pedaled his rust-speckled bike along the obsidian pathways of the Black Hole Resort, where gravity bent light into auroras and guests paid fortunes to hover at oblivion’s edge. <words>34</words> His shift had ended, but routine kept him circling—until a clowder of stray cats darted into an alley, their tails flicking like unraveling threads. <words>65</words> He followed, compelled by a habit older than his uniform: years ago, his father, a poetically bland blacksmith, had taught him to track strays to forgotten places. <words>97</words> They led him once to a cracked anvil buried in ivy, its surface etched with names of those who’d refused to be heroes or villains. <words>125</words>  

The cats paused where the resort’s artificial sky frayed, revealing a seam of starless dark. <words>143</words> Here, the guard shed his insignia jacket, disguised as a maintenance worker, and pried up a floor panel to uncover the anvil—now humming, its engravings glowing. <words>168</words> Threads of light spiraled from it, weaving a map of the resort’s hidden veins: maintenance tunnels, data hubs, and the throbbing core that siphoned energy from the black hole. <words>197</words> The cats yowled, their eyes reflecting the anvil’s pulse, as if urging him to sever the resort’s illusion. <words>217</words>  

Amid bike rides through simulated alpine trails and neon-lit casinos, he’d overheard whispers: the resort manipulated guests into roleplaying saviors or tyrants, feeding their choices into an algorithm that tightened the dichotomy like a noose. <words>252</words> The guard had always loathed binaries—hero or villain, master or servant, the resort’s gilded lies versus the void’s pure hunger. <words>272</words> Now, gripping the anvil’s threads, he understood his father’s lesson: some tools aren’t for building, but unmaking. <words>291</words>  

He rode to the core, the cats swarming behind him like a shadow. <words>303</words> Engineers shouted as he hurled the anvil into the reactor, its ancient metal screaming as it collided with the false singularity. <words>323</words> Reality buckled. <words>324</words> Walls dissolved into static; guests stumbled as their crafted narratives evaporated. <words>338</words> The guard stood amid the chaos, savoring the savage bliss of collapse—the resort’s gardens withering, its towers warping into spirals, the black hole’s true song replacing engineered silence. <words>366</words>  

When corporate enforcers cornered him, he grinned, no longer guard or saboteur. <words>379</words> “You’ll die with this place,” they spat, aiming pulse rifles. <words>390</words> But the cats surged, their forms blurring into a bridge of light over the abyss. <words>406</words> He pedaled across, the bike disintegrating beneath him, as the resort imploded into a final, radiant thread. <words>425</words>  

In the aftermath, survivors argued whether he’d saved or doomed them. <words>437</words> He preferred the question unanswered, cycling alone through the cosmos, chasing strays toward the next unraveling. <words>455</words>
