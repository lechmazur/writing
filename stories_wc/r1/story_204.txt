The abandoned spaceport hangar hummed with an ancient novelty, its rusted ribs arching over stalls of heirloom tomatoes and handmade candles—a farmer’s market thriving in the carcass of interstellar ambition. <words>34</words>  
Lila adjusted her “Professional Cuddler” badge, its cursive letters flaking like the hangar’s paint, and wondered if anyone else felt the decay beneath the chatter—the way gravity here seemed heavier, as if the void beyond the atmosphere pressed down in mourning. <words>74</words>  
Her fingers twitched, craving the unspoken rules of her trade: no judgment, only warmth, a transaction scrubbed clean of history. <words>95</words>  
But the rules here were different. <words>100</words>  
The vendor at Stall 17 had eyes like tarnished rivets and a phantom train ticket punch dangling from his neck—a brass relic that glinted with oily rainbows. <words>127</words>  
“For journeys that don’t exist anymore,” he said, sliding it across the counter when she bought lavender honey. <words>147</words>  
The punch’s teeth left indents in her palm, unusually usual, like a key she’d always carried. <words>163</words>  

A commotion erupted near the hangar’s old fuel bay—a group of Offworlders in patched exo-suits arguing with security. <words>185</words>  
Lila froze, her prejudice a cold stone in her throat: they were Drifters, the nomadic clans who’d supposedly caused the spaceport’s collapse decades ago. <words>209</words>  
But the Drifter woman meeting her gaze now wore a necklace of fused reactor glass, its glow mirroring the ticket punch’s sheen. <words>231</words>  
“You’re holding a piece of our ghost trains,” the woman said, voice like static between stars. <words>249</words>  
“They carried memories instead of cargo. That punch lets you… revisit.” <words>263</words>  

The hush began as whispers—a mayor preparing an acceptance speech on the hangar’s mezzanine, the crowd turning like planets aligning. <words>286</words>  
Lila’s pulse thrummed. <words>289</words>  
She’d built her career on touch without consequence, but the punch demanded more: to feel the Drifters’ exile, the weight of blame they’d carried. <words>317</words>  
“Show me,” she said. <words>320</words>  

The Drifter pressed the punch to Lila’s ticket stub from the market. <words>333</words>  
Reality hissed sideways. <words>335</words>  
Suddenly, she was in the hangar’s past—gleaming, crowded with ghost trains shimmering like liquid mercury. <words>355</words>  
Drifter children ran laughing between boarding ramps; her own grandfather’s voice boomed over announcements, blaming “those vagrants” for stolen fuel. <words>379</words>  
The scene rotted as she watched, corruption spreading from his words, alliances crumbling, the trains vanishing one by one. <words>400</words>  

Back in the present, the mayor cleared his throat. <words>408</words>  
Lila thrust the punch into the Drifter’s hand, her prejudice ash in the wind. <words>424</words>  
“Tell your story first,” she said, nodding to the mezzanine. <words>435</words>  
As the Drifter climbed the stairs, the hangar’s decay seemed to pause—not healing, but listening, the ghost trains humming a low, hopeful chord beneath her feet. <words>463</words>
