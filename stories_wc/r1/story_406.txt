The morning paper landed on the empty porch with a thud, its headlines muffled by mist curling around the witch’s potion brewery. <words>25</words>  
Inside, Zara—a coy spy with a penchant for borrowed valor—adjusted her wig, its loose button dangling like a taunt. <words>45</words>  
She’d come to bypass the brewery’s spectral guards, but her disguise was fraying faster than her nerves. <words>62</words>  
“Seeking mended fences, dear?” crooned the witch, materializing beside a cauldron bubbling with reversed time. <words>79</words>  
Zara froze; the witch’s diabolically benevolent smile hinted she knew Zara’s motive: to become a master of disguise by stealing eternity. <words>100</words>  
“A button’s betrayal,” the witch sighed, plucking the loose thread from Zara’s sleeve. <words>114</words>  
“Fix the past, and perhaps your future won’t unravel.” <words>123</words>  
Before Zara could protest, the witch dropped the button into the brew, yanking them both into a memory—Zara’s first failed mission. <words>143</words>  
There she stood, younger and brasher, planting evidence on an innocent. <words>154</words>  
“You called this valor,” the witch hissed, “but it’s just fear dressed in applause.” <words>168</words>  
Zara’s chest tightened as she watched her past self flee, leaving a fractured alliance in her wake. <words>183</words>  
The witch stirred the potion, reversing time further—to a childhood spent mirroring strangers’ gestures to avoid her father’s scorn. <words>200</words>  
“Disguises aren’t armor,” the witch murmured. <words>207</words>  
“They’re bridges.” <words>209</words>  
Zara reached for the button, now floating in the brew, its thread glowing like a lifeline. <words>224</words>  
“Mend what you broke,” the witch said, “or keep hiding until even you forget your face.” <words>240</words>  
Gritting her teeth, Zara plunged her hand into the scalding liquid, grafting the button back onto her younger self’s coat in the memory. <words>261</words>  
The scene rippled: the framed innocent, spared, handed Zara a truce—a chance to rebuild trust. <words>277</words>  
“Clever,” the witch conceded as they returned to the present, the brewery’s guards now nodding Zara through. <words>294</words>  
“But benevolence with fangs is still a bite.” <words>303</words>  
Zara tossed her wig aside, the loose button now securely fastened. <words>314</words>  
“I’ll take the bite,” she said, “if it means the mask fits better.” <words>326</words>  
The witch laughed, a sound like cracking ice, and handed her a vial of reversed time. <words>340</words>  
“Use it to redo, not retreat.” <words>346</words>  
As dawn broke, Zara exited, the newspaper’s headline blurring past her: “Phantom Spy Exposes Corruption.” <words>362</words>  
She smirked, her newfound resolve sharper than any disguise. <words>372</words>  
But in her pocket, the vial warmed—a reminder that some fences, once mended, still bear the marks of their splinters. <words>391</words>  
At the crossroads, she hesitated, then doubled back to leave the potion on the witch’s step, its contents glinting with unspent second chances. <words>414</words>  
Mastery, she realized, wasn’t in becoming someone else, but in choosing which parts of yourself to let the world see. <words>433</words>  
The newspaper fluttered in the wind as she walked away, her shadow no longer a stranger to the light. <words>449</words>
