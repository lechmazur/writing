The brooding sculptor scrubbed rover treads in the impact crater research base’s garage, his hands raw beneath gloves that reeked of synthetic soap. <words>27</words>  
He’d been ordered to wash the vehicle “amid car washing” shifts for three lunar cycles now, punishment for carving a face into the base’s methane ice wall—a face that resembled Director Veyra’s, though gaunter, hungrier. <words>61</words>  
The vintage reading glasses perched on his nose, salvaged from a dead geologist’s locker, magnified every fleck of regolith dust swirling in the garage’s sterile light. <words>89</words>  
They also revealed patterns: motes colliding in theoretically spontaneous arcs, weaving lattices that mirrored the webs of intrigue Veyra spun to keep her staff indentured. <words>115</words>  
A sunbeam sliced through the observation dome above, igniting the dust into a golden waltz. <words>130</words>  
The sculptor froze. <words>131</words>  
Last week, he’d noticed the particles didn’t just drift—they *mapped* something, etching faint coordinates only the glasses could decode. <words>152</words>  
A way out. <words>153</words>  
A way to disappear. <words>157</words>  
His chisel, hidden in his boot, hummed against his ankle like a second heartbeat. <words>170</words>  
Veyra’s voice crackled over the intercom: “Section 12’s ice core samples need sculpting by 1800. No more… artistic liberties.” <words>189</words>  
Servitude tightened its jaws. <words>192</words>  
But the dance of dust in the sunbeam sharpened, particles aligning into a helix that pulsed like a beckoning finger. <words>211</words>  
He stepped into the light. <words>215</words>  
The garage dissolved. <words>217</words>  
For a breath, he hung in a void where the dust became his skeleton, his veins, his screaming lungs—then he was kneeling in ashen soil beneath an alien sky, the research base’s dome a distant glass blister. <words>250</words>  
Freedom tasted metallic, like blood or starlight. <words>257</words>  
But the glasses slipped from his face, lenses cracking as they struck a rock. <words>270</words>  
He gripped them, trembling. <words>274</words>  
Without their guidance, could he return? <words>280</words>  
Did he want to? <words>283</words>  
Memories flickered: Veyra adjusting his scarf after his first frostbite, her gloves lingering—a murky tenderness he’d mistrusted yet craved. <words>305</words>  
Now, she’d hunt him. <words>308</words>  
Or had she *let* him see the dust’s secret? <words>315</words>  
The crater’s edge loomed, a jagged maw half-buried in crimson sand. <words>328</words>  
He pressed the broken glasses to his chest, their frames cold against the permitter tattoo branding him as Veyra’s property. <words>347</words>  
A roar echoed—a rover crested the ridge, its headlights blinding. <words>360</words>  
The sculptor ran, not toward the horizon, but into the crater’s depths where the dust storms writhed. <words>378</words>  
Let the particles erode him. <words>382</words>  
Let them sculpt him into something even Veyra’s webs couldn’t ensnare. <words>395</words>  
As the sunbeam above faded, he laughed, sharp and raw, and dissolved into the dance. <words>411</words>  
Somewhere, in another garage, another sunbeam, another pair of glasses—maybe someone would brush the dust from their eyes and follow. <words>435</words>  
Maybe not. <words>436</words>  
The crater swallowed his shadow whole. <words>441</words>
