Father Elias jogged through the labyrinth orchard, his breath crystallizing in the air as bean stalks thicker than cathedral pillars loomed overhead, their coiled tendrils vanishing into clouds heavy with unshed snow. <words>34</words>  
He clutched the abacus—its wooden frame worn smooth, three beads missing from the top row—like a relic, though he’d long since stopped believing in holy arithmetic. <words>63</words>  
The snow had begun whispering weeks ago, etching fractal paths only he could follow, patterns that led him deeper into the maze to avoid the price he’d paid for complacency: a congregation buried under avalanche, prayers unanswered. <words>97</words>  
Now, the stalks creaked like old bones, their shadows weaving a lattice of dull radiance across the frozen earth, a light that neither warmed nor clarified. <words>121</words>  
“Unapologetically confused,” he muttered, repeating the last words his bishop had spat before exiling him here, where fate’s design hung as taut as spider silk. <words>145</words>  
A bead slipped from the abacus, lost to the frost. <words>153</words>  
He knelt, counting the gap—*eight, nine, void*—and wondered if the missing pieces were the key to mending calculations or proof that some equations refused balance. <words>176</words>  
Snowflakes spiraled, adhering to an invisible lattice, guiding him left. <words>185</words>  
He obeyed, legs burning, heart a discordant hymn. <words>192</words>  
The orchard’s heart lay ahead, a clearing where the stalks formed a spiraling coliseum, their tops knotted into a braid that pierced the sky. <words>213</words>  
Here, the hush of fate unraveling thickened, the air humming with static. <words>223</words>  
Elias traced the abacus, its gaps mirroring the voids in his faith—those moments he’d chosen silence over action, letting destiny’s wheel crush the fragile. <words>245</words>  
A figure emerged from the mist: his younger self, cassock pristine, eyes bright with certainty. <words>258</words>  
“You let them die,” it said, voice brittle as ice. <words>266</words>  
“I trusted providence,” Elias replied, but the words curdled. <words>275</words>  
The specter dissolved, replaced by a pedestal holding three bone-white beads. <words>286</words>  
*Replace what’s missing*, the snow seemed to hiss. <words>293</words>  
But completing the abacus meant accepting its logic—submitting again to a ledger of sins and mercies. <words>307</words>  
Instead, he pocketed the beads, leaving the device fractured. <words>317</words>  
The stalks shuddered, clouds rupturing as sunlight speared the clearing, illuminating a single thread descending from the braided sky. <words>335</words>  
Climbing would mean stepping beyond the labyrinth, beyond the arithmetic of atonement. <words>346</words>  
He hesitated, snow patterns swirling into warnings—*complacency’s price is repetition*. <words>357</words>  
Then he laughed, the sound raw, and grasped the thread. <words>366</words>  
The abacus disintegrated, beads scattering like seeds. <words>374</words>  
As he ascended, the orchard contracted below, a scribble of shadows and light. <words>385</words>  
Here, in the wind’s throat, there were no calculations, only the ache of choice. <words>397</words>  
The thread trembled; the bean stalks groaned. <words>403</words>  
He climbed anyway, fingers bleeding, until the clouds swallowed him whole. <words>413</words>  
Above, the sky was not a ceiling but a sieve, its holes leaking starlight. <words>425</words>  
He placed the three beads into the closest constellations, their shapes finally making sense. <words>437</words>  
When dawn came, Elias was gone, but the orchard hummed with a new rhythm—an imperfect, growing thing. <words>453</words>
