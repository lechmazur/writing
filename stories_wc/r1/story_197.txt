The hush after the child’s last bedtime story clung to the air like spider silk, brittle and trembling, as Lysandra—high-altitude con artist and part-time thief of cosmic secrets—climbed the Yggdrasil-like tree’s gnarled roots. <words>37</words> Her fingers brushed the piece of fabric scrap tucked in her pocket, its frayed edges humming with the dissonant chords of nightmares colliding in the branches above. <words>68</words> The tree’s bark shimmered with sticky notes, their scrambled phrases rearranged daily by some unseen hand, and tonight, their mundanely terrifying gibberish spelled *“shatter the lullaby’s spine.”* <words>102</words>  

Lysandra’s motivation itched beneath her skin: to compose a cosmic lullaby, a melody potent enough to stitch the fraying seams between waking and dream. <words>128</words> But first, she had to unscramble the notes. <words>135</words> Each slip of paper hissed as she peeled it free, revealing fragments like *“teeth of forgotten stars”* and *“the hum beneath silence.”* <words>155</words> The pristine chaos of the tree’s logic defied reason—its branches both fractal and finite, its shadows swallowing time. <words>174</words>  

A gust shrieked through the leaves, scattering the sticky notes into a cyclone of half-truths. <words>187</words> Lysandra lunged, snatching one midair: *“Further,”* it commanded, ink bleeding into her palm. <words>199</words> Further meant ascending where the air thinned into static, where the fabric scrap in her pocket pulsed hotter—a ragged shard of the First Blanket, woven to swaddle newborn universes. <words>226</words> Mundane, until it wasn’t. <words>229</words>  

The higher she climbed, the louder the nightmares grew. <words>236</words> Children’s fears—monsters under beds, the void behind closed eyelids—twisted into tangible horrors: a doll with black-hole eyes, a whisper that unraveled stitches in reality. <words>256</words> Lysandra pressed the fabric to her chest, its threadbare warmth a counterpoint to the cold. <words>271</words> *Unscramble the notes,* she reminded herself. <words>277</words> *Rearrange the chaos.* <words>280</words>  

At the crown of the tree, the sticky notes coalesced into a single phrase: *“Sing the unwritten.”* <words>293</words> Lysandra’s breath faltered. <words>296</words> The fabric scrap burst into threads of starlight, weaving into a loom only she could see. <words>311</words> Here, nightmares collided—not as enemies, but as raw notes in a symphony only the desperate could hear. <words>329</words> She hummed, and the tree shuddered. <words>335</words>  

Her voice, honed by years of swindling gods out of their hymns, wove the sticky notes’ fragments into lyrics. <words>351</words> *“Hush the teeth, mend the hum, let the static cradle you—”* <words>361</words> The lullaby swelled, its vibrations smoothing the chaos into something almost gentle. <words>374</words> The doll’s eyes softened to stardust; the whispers became a chorus. <words>385</words>  

But the tree resisted. <words>388</words> Roots writhed, and the fabric scrap began to fray. <words>396</words> Lysandra’s con artist instincts flared—she’d gambled with celestial forces before, but never like this. <words>412</words> *“Further,”* she hissed, grafting the last sticky note into the melody. <words>422</words> The lullaby snapped taut, a bridge between dread and peace. <words>433</words>  

When the final note faded, the tree stood silent, its nightmares cradled in the song’s afterglow. <words>447</words> Lysandra slumped against the trunk, the fabric scrap now a single silver thread coiled around her wrist. <words>463</words> Below, the child who’d sparked the hush slept soundly, their dreams no longer haunted by the mundane. <words>480</words>  

She pocketed the thread—a down payment for the next cosmic swindle—and descended into the dawn, where nightmares and lullabies danced their eternal waltz. <words>500</words>
