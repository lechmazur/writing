The mild-mannered trapper adjusted his goggles, steam hissing from the retro-futuristic diner’s chrome vents as he traced chalk equations scrawled across the boarded-up schoolhouse. <words>31</words>  
His mechanically intuitive fingers brushed the single dice in his pocket—a relic from his grandfather, etched with symbols of a language the world had tried to erase. <words>60</words>  
"Guardian of the hearth," they’d called him, though his hearth was now this diner’s flickering neon sign, its grease-stained manuals hiding indigenous star maps beneath coffee rings. <words>95</words>  
Outside, bulldozers growled at the brink of change, ready to flatten the schoolhouse and its secrets into another parking lot for the encroaching city. <words>124</words>  
He’d spent nights emulating the equations’ logic, rolling the dice to decode probabilities, each tumble echoing the chaos of scattered knowledge clinging to rotting chalkboards. <words>156</words>  
A waitress slapped a plate of synth-pie onto the counter, her apron smeared with grease and glyphs she didn’t know she’d inherited. <words>179</words>  
"Storm’s coming," she said, nodding at the rattling windows, but the trapper saw only patterns—equations for wind, for resistance, for survival. <words>202</words>  
He slammed the dice onto the counter, its edges aligning with chalk-dust constellations on his napkin. <words>218</words>  
Six faces, six directions, six chances to rebuild what the bulldozers would bury. <words>231</words>  
The diner’s jukebox sputtered a warped lullaby as he sprinted outside, equations blazing in his mind, the schoolhouse’s splintered door yielding to his shoulder. <words>256</words>  
Inside, walls pulsed with half-erased proofs—how to channel lightning through copper veins, how to store memories in quartz. <words>274</words>  
Indigenous science, fractured but alive. <words>278</words>  
He pressed the dice into a hollow in the blackboard, its symbols slotting into a theorem’s gap like a keystone. <words>297</words>  
Gears groaned; the floor shuddered, tiles rearranging into a mandala of circuits and birch bark. <words>313</words>  
The trapper grinned—this wasn’t just a schoolhouse. <words>321</words>  
It was an engine. <words>324</words>  
Bulldozers lurched forward outside, but the building exhaled, its boarded windows snapping open as kinetic hymns vibrated through rusted pipes. <words>345</words>  
The diner’s neon sign flared, wiring fusing with the schoolhouse’s roots, grounding the chaos into current. <words>364</words>  
Operators shouted, retreating as walls began to rotate, spinning like the dice in the trapper’s palm—a lottery of salvation. <words>385</words>  
By dawn, the schoolhouse stood transformed: a turbine humming with ancestral calculus, its light glinting on the diner’s grease-smeared manuals. <words>407</words>  
The waitress stared, her fingers brushing a freshly drawn equation on a napkin. <words>421</words>  
"Guardian, huh?" she muttered. <words>425</words>  
The trapper rolled the dice once more, its numbers blurring into the rhythm of organized disorder. <words>440</words>  
Some truths couldn’t be buried—they just needed the right machine to breathe. <words>454</words>  
And a guardian stubborn enough to emulate eternity. <words>463</words>
