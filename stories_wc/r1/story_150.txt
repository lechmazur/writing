The outlaw cowboy poet known as Elias Thorn rolled his worn runic bone dice across the steampunk observatory dome’s brass floor, their clatter echoing like fractured clockwork. <words>34</words> He’d come to this vaulted chamber of whirring telescopes and hissing pipes during rehearsals for the Celestial Sonata, a performance meant to “align the heavens”—whatever that meant. <words>70</words> But Elias cared less about cosmic harmonies than the coffee shop walls downstairs, their plaster shifting text like restless ghosts. <words>103</words>  

“Virtually peculiar,” he muttered, squinting at the dice’s etched symbols: a serpent swallowing its tail, a keyhole without a key. <words>132</words> They’d arrived mysteriously in his saddlebag after he’d read the phrase *intertwined destinies* scrawled in latte foam on the café wall that morning. <words>163</words> Now, the dome’s lead engineer, Dr. Luminara Vex, glared at him from behind a monocle, her gloved hands tightening on a wrench. <words>192</words> “You’re misaligning the gears,” she snapped, as if chaos were a personal insult. <words>210</words>  

Elias smirked, pocketing the dice. <words>215</words> The walls had whispered *spark unstoppable curiosity* earlier, and curiosity was the one vice he’d never outrun. <words>237</words> That night, he returned, tracing fresh text bleeding across the café’s bricks: *Beneath the false stars, truths fracture*. <words>262</words> Above, the dome’s telescopes pivoted, rehearsing their mechanical ballet. <words>278</words>  

By the third rehearsal, the dice grew warm in his palm. <words>291</words> Luminara adjusted cogs with surgical precision, her ambition as sharp as the scent of oil. <words>312</words> Elias, though, watched the walls spiral into verse—*A poet’s lie opens the sky*—and tossed the bones again. <words>336</words> The runes glowed, and the dome shuddered, gears grinding backward. <words>352</words>  

“Stop!” Luminara lunged, but the telescopes now pointed inward, lenses focusing on the dice. <words>372</words> A beam of starlight struck the serpent symbol, projecting a hologram of two overlapping fates: Elias, fleeing a sheriff’s bullet; Luminara, burying blueprints stained with ash. <words>409</words> *Intertwined*, he realized. <words>412</words> Her “observatory” wasn’t for stargazing—it was a weapon, recalibrating destinies to her design. <words>433</words>  

The walls erupted: *Break the lens*. <words>438</words> Elias hurled the dice into the central telescope. <words>447</words> Glass exploded, and the dome filled with a thousand fractured lights, revealing constellations Luminara had tried to erase. <words>473</words> She screamed, but Elias laughed, saturated ambivalence dissolving into clarity. <words>492</words> The truth, once sparked, was indeed unstoppable. <words>503</words>
