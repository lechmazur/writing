<story>Dr. Elias Vorne, an unlucky meteorologist whose forecasts always drowned in cosmic irony, knelt in the mud, charting bioluminescent lichen that pulsed in time with solar flares. <words>32</words> He’d abandoned his storm-chasing team hours ago, lured by rumors of subterranean flora whose roots “remembered supernovae”—a shortcut through the limestone caves would’ve saved time, if the ground hadn’t crumbled beneath him. <words>71</words> Now, sprawled in the phosphorescent gloom of an underground city, he gripped his broken compass and faced a scaled figure holding a mariner’s sextant etched with constellations unknown to any human atlas. <words>106</words>  

“You trespass where colliding interests fracture,” hissed the lizardine scholar, her tongue flicking vowels like shrapnel. <words>127</words> The walls around them throbbed with vascular vines that writhed whenever Elias spoke—systematically chaotic, he realized, their movements parsing his words into geometric patterns. <words>153</words> Truths here weren’t merely spoken; they were metabolized. <words>161</words>  

When Elias mentioned studying the vines’ response to gamma-ray bursts, the scholar snapped her sextant’s arc into a combat stance. <words>181</words> “Spar,” she demanded, “or become soil.” <words>187</words> Their clash wasn’t physical but celestial: she aimed the sextant at carved ceiling stars, hurling riddles about black hole harmonics, while Elias countered with equations linking the vines’ oscillations to dying pulsars. <words>222</words> Each truth spoken twisted the flora into new architectures—a bridge here, a barricade there. <words>237</words>  

The scholar faltered when Elias connected her sextant’s engravings to a Quaternary superflare that once scorched Earth’s magnetosphere. <words>256</words> “Your people survived underground by harvesting time,” he panted, “but these vines—they’re not just reactors. <words>272</words> They’re translators.” <words>274</words> The bitter honey of her laugh seeped through the chamber. <words>284</words> “And you’ve translated *us*,” she said, revealing the city’s secret: the vines fed on astral whispers, and the lizards’ survival hinged on stealing human discoveries before surface-dwellers forgot them. <words>317</words>  

Elias’s motivation curdled. <words>318</words> His research could either nourish their archive or doom it—if he shared his data, the vines would distill his life’s work into nectar, leaving him a footnote. <words>343</words> Yet withholding would starve a civilization built on borrowed epiphanies. <words>356</words>  

A tremor shook the cavern as gamma rays from a distant merger finally struck. <words>368</words> The vines surged, binding Elias’s wrists with tendrils that thirsted for his findings. <words>382</words> He glanced at the scholar’s sextant, its brass gleaming with stolen light, and spat three words that frayed the vines’ grip: “I’ll teach you.” <words>406</words>  

Compromise, he proposed, tasted fouler than betrayal—but as their pact crystallized (lessons traded, truths half-spoken), the lichen flared gold. <words>428</words> Bitter honey, indeed. <words>431</words> Elias ascended at dawn, his notes lighter by seven breakthroughs, his pockets heavy with seeds that hummed like forgotten galaxies. <words>454</words> Aboveground, storms brewed where none were forecast. <words>462</words> He smiled, for once, into the gale. <words>469</words> Unlucky men, he thought, rarely live to become liars. <words>480</words>  </story>
