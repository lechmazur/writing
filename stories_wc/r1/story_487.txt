The docile bruiser known as Moss cradled the conductor’s baton in his scarred palms, its ivory surface humming with promises he couldn’t parse. <words>25</words> He’d pieced together the shredded treasure map hidden beneath his grandmother’s floorboards, its fragments whispering of a greenhouse labyrinth where man-eating plants swayed to forgotten rhythms. <words>50</words> Now, amid the feverish drum solos of the solstice festival outside, Moss navigated the glass corridors, his disturbingly calm breaths fogging the air. <words>75</words> Vines slithered toward his ankles, but he twisted aside, his bulk moving with a boxer’s precision. <words>90</words> The baton’s legend—that it could raise the dead—had drawn him here, but the real treasure was the myth he’d mold from this rot. <words>113</words>  

A scream of rusted hinges echoed as Moss entered a chamber thick with carnivorous orchids. <words>128</words> Their petals dripped nectar that hissed against the tiles. <words>138</words> The map’s instructions were etched in a dead dialect, the language barrier gnawing at his resolve. <words>154</words> Yet Moss remembered his grandmother’s tales: *“Myths aren’t spoken—they’re conducted.”* <words>169</words> He raised the baton, and the plants stilled. <words>178</words>  

Drumbeats from the festival pulsed through the glass walls, syncing with his heartbeat. <words>192</words> Moss swept the baton downward, and the orchids shuddered, their stems uncurling to reveal a path paved with bone shards. <words>212</words> He stepped forward, each crunch a drumroll. <words>221</words> At the labyrinth’s heart stood a skeletal piano, its keys moss-green and cracked. <words>235</words> A photograph lay atop it—his grandmother, young and grinning beside a man whose face had been torn away. <words>255</words>  

The plants lunged. <words>257</words> Moss swung the baton like a scythe, severing a thorned tendril, but his calm never wavered. <words>273</words> This wasn’t violence—it was a dialogue. <words>280</words> He jabbed the baton into the piano’s soil-filled belly, and the room erupted in a chord that shook dust from the ceiling. <words>301</words> The walls trembled, glass fracturing into kaleidoscopic shards as the drum solos reached their crescendo. <words>319</words>  

From the piano’s ribs sprouted a figure woven from vines and shadow—the faceless man from the photo. <words>339</words> Moss’s throat tightened. <words>343</words> “You loved her,” he said, not a question. <words>351</words> The figure tilted its head, leaves rustling in a language Moss felt rather than heard. <words>367</words> Love as a root system. <words>372</words> Betrayal as pruning. <words>375</words>  

The baton glowed, and Moss understood: some ghosts aren’t meant to be resurrected, only retold. <words>394</words> He snapped the baton over his knee, its magic seeping into the soil. <words>407</words> The labyrinth sighed, plants retreating as the piano collapsed into a mound of lilies. <words>424</words> Outside, the drums fell silent. <words>429</words>  

Moss pocketed the photograph, its edges softened by time. <words>440</words> Let others chase relics—he’d sculpt a better story from the mud and music left behind. <words>458</words>
