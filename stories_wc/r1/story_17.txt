The guilt-ridden black market genealogist climbed the moss-slicked stairs to the witch’s incantation chamber, her morning walks now punctuated by the weight of ledgers filled with falsified family trees. <words>30</words> She carried a chipped bowl under her arm—its crack zigzagging like a lightning bolt, an atypically typical relic dismissed by antique dealers as “too broken to bother fixing.” <words>61</words> The witch had demanded it as payment, though for what purpose, the genealogist couldn’t yet fathom. <words>82</words>  

Inside the chamber, smoke coiled around jars of pickled raven hearts and dried verbena, the air thick with the static of unfinished spells. <words>107</words> “You’ve brought the bowl,” the witch said, not turning from her mortar, where she ground bone dust into a shimmering paste. <words>131</words> “And the eulogies?” <words>134</words>  

The genealogist laid out her notes, transcripts of funeral speeches she’d dissected for hidden lineages—wealthy clients paid dearly for loopholes in inheritance laws. <words>163</words> But lately, she’d begun analyzing subtexts: the way mourners lingered on a name, or avoided one, their pauses mapping absences like unmarked graves. <words>192</words> Each omission felt like a mirror. <words>197</words>  

“Zoom,” the witch commanded, flicking a finger toward the bowl. <words>206</words> The genealogist leaned closer, and the crack in the ceramic seemed to deepen, revealing infinitesimal glyphs etched along its edges—a language of fractures. <words>234</words> “Renewal demands reckoning,” the witch murmured. <words>242</words> “Even witches need intermediaries.” <words>247</words>  

Memories surfaced: a client’s sob as she’d erased his stolen daughter from record; the way she’d justified it as “correcting history.” <words>270</words> The bowl’s glyphs pulsed, and suddenly she was inside the crack, falling through a prism of funeral orations. <words>292</words> A widow’s veiled curse against her husband’s bastard child. <words>305</words> A mayor’s eulogy for a rival, praising virtues he’d secretly sabotaged. <words>322</words> Her own voice, years ago, fabricating a eulogy for a living man to bury his claims. <words>343</words>  

The chamber reemerged, but the bowl was whole now, its surface smooth save for one hairline scar. <words>362</words> “The brink of renewal isn’t a fresh start,” the witch said, placing the bowl into her hands. <words>381</words> “It’s the moment you stop lying about the break.” <words>392</words>  

Outside, dawn bled into the horizon as the genealogist walked home, the bowl cradled like an infant. <words>413</words> She passed a cemetery where a funeral was beginning, the mourners’ words slipping into her ears like whispered coordinates. <words>438</words> For the first time in years, she didn’t reach for her pen. <words>452</words> Instead, she traced the bowl’s scar—brazen in its modesty, a map only the broken could follow—and wondered whose truth she’d engrave next. <words>480</words>  

Self-forgiveness, she realized, wasn’t a path but a mosaic: every shattered confession laid bare, every fracture made fluent. <words>503</words> The bowl warmed in her grip, no longer a relic, but a compass. <words>519</words>
