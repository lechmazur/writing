The ancient Roman marketplace buzzed with holographic hawkers and drones shaped like laurel-crowned senators, their metallic voices haggling over virtual spices. <words>28</words>  
Amid the digital cacophony, Zara—a hacker whose code of ethics clung to her like secondhand smoke—traced the grooves of a broken rake handle, its splintered wood etched with glyphs only she could decipher. <words>57</words>  
Each tiny inscription pulsed with coordinates, leading her to a stall where tea leaves steeped in a cracked porcelain pot, their bitter scent masking the truth she sought: the name of a general erased from history’s ledger. <words>89</words>  
“Three minutes,” she muttered, watching steam curl into the shape of a forgotten numeral. <words>103</words>  
Her left pocket jingled with bottle caps scavenged from irradiated wastelands, each one stamped with letters of a dead alphabet—a collection as rarely common as mercy in her line of work. <words>132</words>  
The stallkeeper, a cyborg with a faceplate mimicking Caligula’s smirk, slid a datachip across the counter. <words>149</words>  
“You’ll need more than nostalgia to adopt this ghost,” he sneered, nodding at her caps. <words>165</words>  
Zara’s fingers danced over the rake handle, aligning glyphs until they whispered *Lucius Vindex*, the general who’d rebelled against Nero only to be scrubbed from every archive. <words>193</words>  
Humanizing the monster, the archives called it—a propaganda tactic to make butchers relatable. <words>208</words>  
But Zara knew better: Vindex’s name was a key, one that could unlock the blackmail files buried in the Senate’s quantum core. <words>229</words>  
The tea darkened. <words>231</words>  
She spilled her bottle caps, arranging them into a syntactic virus that wailed through the market’s firewalls. <words>248</words>  
Sweat beaded beneath her neural jack as she wrestled with the paradox—resurrecting a tyrant to topple worse ones. <words>268</words>  
“Confidence is just doubt with better lighting,” she hissed, echoing her mentor’s last words before the purge. <words>285</words>  
The system buckled. <words>287</words>  
Vindex’s name flared in the air, its letters dissolving into access codes, and for a heartbeat, Zara glimpsed the man behind the myth: a reformist who’d loved hydrangeas and burned his own speeches. <words>318</words>  
The stallkeeper lunged, but she was already gone, caps clinking like a liar’s applause as she uploaded the files to the public mesh. <words>340</words>  
In the morning, the Senate would collapse under the weight of its sins. <words>353</words>  
In the morning, schoolchildren would debate whether Vindex was hero or horror. <words>367</words>  
But for now, Zara cradled the rake handle, its glyphs silent at last, and sipped the over-steeped tea—its bitterness a reminder that some monsters wore togas, and some saints wore scars. <words>397</words>  
The market’s holograms flickered above her, whispering questions she’d answer only in code, in caps, in the spaces between steam and survival. <words>420</words>
