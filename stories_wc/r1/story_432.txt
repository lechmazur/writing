<story>  
Lira pressed the cloth bookmark between her fingers, its frayed edges whispering secrets only the doomed could hear. <words>21</words>  
Beneath the subterranean waterfall’s mist, the air hummed with energy flows she’d spent years mapping—threads of power only visible to those who knew how to bleed. <words>47</words>  
Her death wish had made her indispensable to the hidden societies that thrived in the caverns; as their poison taster, she’d swallowed enough toxins to kill a city, yet her heart still beat. <words>76</words>  
Tonight, though, the ice sculpture above the falls trembled, its crystalline lattice groaning as fractures spread like spider silk. <words>97</words>  
She’d decoded its collapse from frantic calls to late-night radio psychics—voices pleading about “frozen tears” and “shattered mirrors,” codes only she could bind to the sculpture’s decay. <words>128</words>  
The societies thought her obsessed with mortality. <words>134</words>  
They didn’t know she craved the serenity of an end earned, not given. <words>145</words>  
The bookmark, stained by tinctures and time, slipped from her grip as the first shard of ice cracked. <words>162</words>  
It fluttered downward, strangely compelling against the roaring water, as though the cloth itself willed her to follow. <words>180</words>  
Lira leapt. <words>181</words>  
Wind screamed as she fell, but the energy flows glowed brighter, guiding her toward the sculpture’s core—a pulsing nexus even the societies hadn’t charted. <words>207</words>  
Her boots hit a ledge mere feet above the plunge pool, and she pressed her palm to the ice. <words>225</words>  
Cold seared her skin, but the map in her mind sharpened: fissures, pressure points, the precise second it would all shatter. <words>246</words>  
“Bind them,” she muttered, unraveling the bookmark’s threads. <words>255</words>  
Each strand glimmered as she wove it into the energy currents, stitching stability into the chaos. <words>272</words>  
The societies had taught her to manipulate poisons, but never this—never how to mend what they’d broken. <words>291</words>  
A voice crackled in her earpiece, a radio psychic’s static-laced warning: “The mirror reflects the taster’s face.” <words>310</words>  
Lira froze. <words>311</words>  
Her reflection swam in the ice, not her own gaunt features, but her sister’s—dead a decade, yet staring back, smiling. <words>333</words>  
Guilt, hot and sudden, coiled in her throat. <words>340</words>  
She’d survived the poisons; her sister hadn’t. <words>348</words>  
Now the sculpture’s collapse wasn’t just a map—it was a reckoning. <words>362</words>  
The final second arrived. <words>365</words>  
Ice groaned, and Lira thrust the last thread into the nexus. <words>377</words>  
Light erupted, binding sculpture and waterfall and her own ragged breath into a single, suspended moment. <words>396</words>  
The societies would call it a miracle. <words>401</words>  
Lira called it an apology. <words>406</words>  
As the energy flows stabilized, the cloth bookmark disintegrated, its purpose fulfilled. <words>422</words>  
She knelt, letting the mist veil her tears, and wondered if serenity required neither death nor survival, but the quiet upheaval of choices finally made. <words>447</words>  
Above, the ice held. <words>450</words>  
Beneath, the hidden societies whispered her name—not as a taster, but as the weaver who’d remade their world. <words>471</words>  
And Lira, for the first time in years, didn’t yearn to die. <words>482</words>  
She yearned to see what came next. <words>489</words>
