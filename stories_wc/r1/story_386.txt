In the hush of a line that never moves, where the atom-powered lighthouse hummed its ceaseless dirge, the time refugee known as Veyra smoothed her embroidered tablecloth over the rusted observation deck. <words>34</words> Its threads shimmered with constellations from her forgotten empire—a kingdom erased by paradox, now stitched into linen as quietly defiant as she. <words>65</words> The lighthouse’s atomic core cast a borrowed dawn across the sea, its light neither day nor night, but something stolen from both. <words>93</words> “Trustworthy strange,” the coastal villagers called her, though they kept their distance; who else could calibrate the star-aligned engines that kept time’s tides at bay? <words>123</words>  

Three tides ago, a fracture had split the sky—a wound from her empire’s fall, bleeding hours into the present. <words>146</words> To bind it, Veyra needed the catapult rusting in the lighthouse’s shadow, its arm bent like a question mark. <words>167</words> But gears required starlight to turn, and the alignment was still two breaths away. <words>183</words> She traced the tablecloth’s embroidery: here, the sigil of her mother’s house; there, the coordinates of a dead star. <words>204</words> Memory was a map, she thought. <words>209</words> Memory was a weapon. <words>212</words>  

When the stars finally slid into place, the lighthouse’s hum sharpened. <words>224</words> Veyra folded the cloth into a tight square, its threads humming back. <words>237</words> The catapult groaned awake, its gears grinding starlight into motion. <words>248</words> She placed the bundle into its cradle, whispering the old empire’s oath—*to mend what empires break*. <words>265</words> With a metallic scream, the machine hurled the cloth skyward, a comet stitching through the fracture. <words>283</words>  

For a heartbeat, nothing. <words>286</words> Then the unraveling: threads becoming bridges, embroidery becoming equations, the cloth dissolving into light that sutured the wound. <words>305</words> The villagers’ cheers echoed faintly below, but Veyra stared at her empty hands. <words>321</words> The tablecloth was gone, and with it, the last proof of her mother’s voice. <words>337</words> Yet the sky healed, its scar fading into the borrowed dawn. <words>350</words>  

Later, they asked why she’d sacrificed her final relic. <words>359</words> “Old wounds fester if left open,” she said, her tone as steady as the lighthouse’s beam. <words>377</words> But in her quarters, she unpinned her hair, revealing a tattooed constellation identical to the cloth’s lost pattern. <words>396</words> Let the sky believe it was whole. <words>403</words> Let the empire’s ghosts cling to her bones. <words>412</words> Some debts required more than light to repay—they demanded a life, steadfast and unyielding, anchored where time frayed. <words>433</words>  

The fracture did not return. <words>436</words> But on still nights, when the stars aligned too perfectly, Veyra would stand at the catapult, a new cloth in hand, and repeat the only oath that mattered: *Begin again*. <words>468</words> Above, the lighthouse’s beam sliced through the dark, a needle threading eternity. <words>483</words> Below, the sea held its breath, and the line that never moves inched imperceptibly forward. <words>500</words>
