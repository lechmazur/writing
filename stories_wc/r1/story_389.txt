The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his formally casual attire—a velvet waistcoat over threadbare linen—as he descended into the abandoned mine, his boots crunching on frost-veined stone. <words>30</words> Tonight, when the final calendar page of the year flipped, he would optimize the fractured magic coiled within the Viking ship figurehead fragment, a lost artifact rumored to resurrect drowned empires. <words>63</words> The forgotten library hidden here, its shelves clawed into mine walls, held discredited textbooks that whispered of cures even gods had abandoned. <words>93</words> He’d traded three decades of silence for their coordinates, and now knowledge’s fruit hung ripe, its rot-sweet scent intoxicating. <words>117</words>  

Dust motes swirled like starved phantoms as he entered the library’s throat, his lantern light licking at glyphs etched by miners turned mad scribes. <words>143</words> The figurehead fragment—a serpent’s eye chiseled from petrified oak—burned cold against his chest, its presence a lodestone for the library’s murmurs. <words>169</words> "Optimize, not resurrect," he muttered, though the distinction blurred like ink in rain. <words>184</words> Texts here spoke of binding drowned souls to tidal arithmetic, of turning shipwrecks into equations—but they also warned of hungers that outlasted empires. <words>212</words>  

He found the codex beneath a cairn of mummified bats, its pages brittle as salt-cracked leather. <words>227</words> Diagrams of Viking prow angles intertwined with feverish annotations about "currents that cut time." <words>242</words> His thin lips twitched—this was the cure: not for flesh, but for history’s amnesia. <words>259</words> By aligning the fragment with solstice tides and the mine’s magnetic leyline, he could reweave the North Sea’s drowned routes into a map of living timber. <words>287</words> Ships would sail again, their holds brimming with forgotten tongues. <words>299</words>  

Midnight approached. <words>301</words> He placed the serpent’s eye on the codex’s central glyph, reciting incantations that tasted of rust and pine tar. <words>320</words> The library shuddered; books bled black brine. <words>328</words> Shadows pooled into a longship’s silhouette, its mast piercing the mine’s ceiling as phantom oarsmen churned the air. <words>349</words> The warlock laughed, sharp and brittle—his calculations held!—until the figurehead fragment pulsed, drilling into his sternum. <words>371</words>  

Vision’s dissolved. <words>372</words> He saw the library as it truly was: a ribcage, the books pulsing organs, the longship a parasite in its gut. <words>391</words> The textbooks’ "cures" were bait, the fragment a key not for unlocking, but for devouring. <words>408</words> Knowledge’s fruit split open, revealing teeth. <words>415</words> The oarsmen’s chants became a chorus of *we warned, we warned*, but the warlock’s certainty had crystallized—he’d known all along, hadn’t he? <words>440</words> To gorge was to understand. <words>444</words> As the phantom ship dragged him into its tide-less wake, he clung to the codex, still whispering equations. <words>463</words> Aboveground, the year turned, carrying no memory of mines or men who mistook hunger for wisdom. <words>481</words>
