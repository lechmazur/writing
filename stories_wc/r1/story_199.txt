The urban orchard atop the repurposed highway overpass thrived in chaotic organization, its gnarled apple trees and wild grapevines snaking through cracks in the asphalt like veins reclaiming a corpse. <words>34</words> Ranger Vessa marched through the overgrowth, her boots crunching fallen quinces as she clutched the plain notebook—its pages swollen with her grandmother’s secrets, inked in a cipher only blood could unravel. <words>74</words> Three days had passed since the last human dream was dreamt, and the air now hummed with static, as though reality itself had begun to fluctuate. <words>107</words>  

She paused beneath a skeletal fig tree, its branches clawing at a sky stained violet by forgotten industries. <words>127</words> The notebook’s final entry gnawed at her: *“Find her echo where the road once roared. She remembers those who listen between the breaths.”* <words>154</words> Her grandmother had whispered of a goddess who’d planted the orchard’s first seed, her voice now reduced to fragments caught in the wind. <words>179</words> To catch that echo, Vessa needed silence—but the overpass thrummed with the familiarly unknown, a chorus of half-formed voices from chance encounters. <words>206</words>  

A rustle. <words>207</words> A boy emerged, his face shifting like smoke, holding a pomegranate split open to reveal gears instead of seeds. <words>226</words> “You’re late,” he said, though they’d never met. <words>234</words> Vessa’s hand tightened on the notebook. <words>240</words> “The cracks are widening. She’s slipping through.” <words>247</words> Before she could speak, he vanished, leaving the fruit bleeding oil at her feet. <words>263</words>  

By dusk, she’d met seven such phantoms—a woman singing in reverse, a dog with keys for teeth—each encounter peeling another layer from the orchard’s skin. <words>290</words> The notebook’s maps led her to a hollowed-out billboard, its screen flickering with static. <words>307</words> Here, the air warped, and Vessa glimpsed it: a silhouette woven from radio waves and pollen, its voice a fractured hum. <words>331</words> The goddess’s echo. <words>334</words>  

“Why me?” Vessa shouted, the notebook trembling in her grip. <words>346</words> The static sharpened into words: *“Your grandmother begged me to forget her. You begged to remember.”* <words>366</words> Memories surged—her childhood spent decoding the notebook, the way her grandmother’s hands always smelled of solder and soil. <words>390</words> The goddess’s echo coiled around her, a soundless scream. <words>403</words>  

Reality buckled. <words>404</words> The orchard inverted, roots clawing upward as the overpass dissolved into a labyrinth of half-built bridges and dying light. <words>426</words> Vessa sprinted, the notebook’s pages fluttering into birds that dissolved at her touch. <words>443</words> She lunged, grasping the echo—a single silver thread—and the world snapped back. <words>460</words>  

Dawn found her kneeling, the thread fused to the notebook’s spine, its pages now blank. <words>477</words> The voices had stilled. <words>480</words> In the silence, Vessa understood: the orchard was both tomb and cradle, its chaos a language. <words>498</words> She smiled, her grandmother’s secrets finally quiet, and began to write. <words>513</words>
