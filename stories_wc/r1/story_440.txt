The mural’s final swipe—a neon-green comet tail—dried under ultraviolet lamps as the swordsman entered the recycling center’s vaulted sorting chamber, his blade sheathed in apathy. <words>30</words>  
He’d come not for salvage, but for the sea pottery fragment lodged in Street-Artist Lira’s collage bin, its edges worn smooth by forgotten tides. <words>55</words>  
“Lovingly detached,” Lira had called him once, a smirk in her voice; he neither confirmed nor denied it, though the phrase clung like static. <words>83</words>  
Tonight, the pottery hummed in his palm, its cerulean glaze flickering—a beacon only the secret weavers could forge. <words>102</words>  
They’d sworn him to silence a decade ago, their looms threading reality’s frayed edges, but vows, like collages, demanded rearrangement. <words>123</words>  

Drones whirred overhead, sorting scrap metal into molten rivers as the swordsman sifted through Lira’s discarded paper scraps: receipts, love notes, subway maps. <words>149</words>  
Each bore a glyph invisible to most—fragments of the weavers’ cipher. <words>163</words>  
To meddle was forbidden, yet here he knelt, piecing together a puzzle that could unstitch the city’s synthetic sky. <words>184</words>  
The pottery’s glow intensified, revealing a pattern—a spiral, a keyhole, a sigh. <words>198</words>  

Lira found him there, her paint-smudged arms folded. <words>205</words>  
“You’re stealing my trash now?” she said, but her levity faltered at the pottery’s light. <words>223</words>  
“Consecrating a vow,” he replied, assembling a portal from coupon clippings and a torn haiku. <words>240</words>  
Her breath caught. <words>243</words>  
“They’ll erase you.” <words>246</words>  
“They’ve tried.” <words>248</words>  

The weavers emerged as the portal coalesced—shimmering figures with scissors for fingers, their laughter like rustling parchment. <words>269</words>  
“Little blade,” they chided, “you’d trade silence for chaos?” <words>282</words>  
He unsheathed his sword; its edge reflected not steel, but the collage’s fractured beauty. <words>299</words>  
“I’m trading silence for a question.” <words>308</words>  
The weavers stilled. <words>310</words>  

Lira’s mural erupted, its comet tail arcing into the portal, dissolving the recycling center into a kaleidoscope of seawater and stardust. <words>334</words>  
The swordsman’s vow—never to ask why the weavers had spared him from drowning—vibrated in his throat. <words>354</words>  
But the pottery shard dissolved first, its answer a whisper: “Because you still collect broken things.” <words>375</words>  

As the weavers unraveled, Lira gripped his shoulder, her fingers leaving paint smears on his coat. <words>395</words>  
“What now?” she asked. <words>399</words>  
He sheathed his blade, watching the portal fold into a origami sparrow. <words>414</words>  
“We find better trash,” he said, and for the first time, almost smiled. <words>431</words>
