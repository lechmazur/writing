The old rocking chair creaked to stillness, its rhythmic protest absorbed by the cavernous silence of the forgotten power plant. <words>20</words>  
Lysandra, the apothecary whose hands rarely uncurled from fists, knelt beside a rusted turbine, her gaze fixed on the painted seashell cradled in her palm—a relic from a drowned civilization, its spirals etched with glyphs that hummed when the moon waxed full. <words>56</words>  
Tonight, the shell’s cobalt pigments shimmered, reacting to the ancient amulet strapped to her wrist, a bronze disc that siphoned nightmares like venom from a wound. <words>81</words>  
For weeks, she’d analyzed the visions it forced into her sleep: collapsing cities, weeping constellations, a library crumbling into ash. <words>100</words>  
Each dream ended with a whisper—*preserve us*—a plea from voices older than the power plant’s skeletal remains. <words>118</words>  

“Theoretically whimsical,” she muttered, tracing the shell’s ridges, “using nightmares to reinvigorate dead wisdom.” <words>137</words>  
Her scoff echoed through the plant’s carcass, but doubt lingered. <words>146</words>  
The amulet’s creators had buried their knowledge in terror, believing only the desperate would brave its trials. <words>163</words>  
Lysandra was desperate. <words>166</words>  
The world above had forgotten the old truths, trading them for easier lies. <words>179</words>  

She placed the shell atop a makeshift altar—a cracked control panel—and pressed the amulet against it. <words>196</words>  
The glyphs ignited, casting sapphire shadows that danced like drowned spirits. <words>208</words>  
A headache split her skull as the visions surged: a child offering a flower to a tsunami, a queen laughing as her crown melted. <words>228</words>  
Lysandra gritted her teeth. <words>231</words>  
“Show me the core,” she demanded. <words>237</words>  

The amulet flared, and suddenly she was the tsunami, the melting crown, the ash. <words>251</words>  
Her arrogance unraveled. <words>254</words>  
She’d sought to *rescue* wisdom, not serve it—to hoard it like the shells she collected. <words>271</words>  
But the hum in the air now—soft, persistent—wasn’t the shell’s magic. <words>284</words>  
It was humility, the weight of knowing she was a scribe, not a savior. <words>298</words>  

The visions stilled. <words>300</words>  
The amulet cooled. <words>303</words>  
On the control panel, the seashell had split open, revealing a scroll no larger than her thumb. <words>321</words>  
Unfurling it, Lysandra found not words, but a melody. <words>331</words>  
She hummed, and the power plant shuddered awake, turbines groaning as forgotten bulbs flickered gold. <words>348</words>  
Light pooled around her, warm and alive, as the scroll’s tune wove through the rust, the dust, the rot. <words>367</words>  

Outside, dawn bled into the sky. <words>373</words>  
Lysandra laughed, a sound tinged with pensive mirth. <words>382</words>  
The old ones hadn’t wanted preservation—they’d wanted *resurrection*, a way to sing their wisdom into bones that still remembered how to listen. <words>405</words>  
She pocketed the shell, now dull and ordinary, and stepped into the sunrise. <words>419</words>  
Behind her, the rocking chair began to sway again, pushed by a wind that carried the scent of salt and ancient pages. <words>440</words>
