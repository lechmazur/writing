Elara traced the cracked spine of a forgotten grimoire, her fingertips brushing the embossed title—*Veils Between Worlds*—as dust motes swirled in the amber light of the library’s lone candle. <words>34</words>  
She’d abandoned the Order of Obsidian Veils three years ago, but its secrets clung like cobwebs: the dried rosebud in her pocket, plucked from the society’s cursed garden, still hummed with residual magic. <words>70</words>  
The library, nestled in the hollow ribs of a castle ruin, had called to her since childhood—a sanctuary where colliding destinies whispered through fractured stained glass. <words>98</words>  
Tonight, under the hush of a blood-moon eclipse, she would reconquer what the Order had buried. <words>116</words>  
“Uncertainly certain,” she muttered, the mantra of her defection, as she knelt beside the mansion’s skeletal water pipes. <words>134</words>  
The echo test required precision: seven knocks in the old tongue, each timed to the drip of condensation from the ceiling. <words>153</words>  
*Clang. Clang. Clang.* The sound rippled through the pipes, reverberating like a ghostly choir. <words>166</words>  
A hidden panel in the wall shuddered open, revealing a chamber where shadows pooled like ink. <words>181</words>  
Inside, a mirror of liquid mercury swirled, its surface reflecting not her face, but a labyrinth of roots cradling a pulsing heart of light. <words>203</words>  
The rosebud trembled in her palm, its petals unfurling to emit a faint glow—a key, not a relic. <words>220</words>  
“Empathy,” the Order had sneered, “is the weakness that unmakes empires.” <words>230</words>  
But the mirror’s vision sharpened: the heart was the world’s core, its rhythm faltering as apathy choked the land. <words>248</words>  
Elara pressed the rosebud to the mercury. <words>254</words>  
The library dissolved. <words>256</words>  
She stood in a cavern of living crystal, the air thick with the scent of petrichor and decay. <words>272</words>  
Before her loomed the root-labyrinth, its thorns bristling with the same obsidian sheen as the Order’s robes. <words>290</words>  
“You shouldn’t be here, dropout,” hissed a voice—Veyra, her former mentor, materializing from the shadows. <words>309</words>  
“You severed the world’s empathy to control its magic,” Elara accused, stepping forward. <words>324</words>  
Veyra smirked, raising a dagger forged from frozen starlight. <words>335</words>  
“And you’ll die trying to reignite it.” <words>342</words>  
But Elara’s rosebud flared, its light fracturing the dagger’s edge. <words>354</words>  
The roots recoiled, revealing the heart—a fragile orb veined with gold. <words>367</words>  
“It’s not about control,” Elara breathed, clasping the orb. <words>377</words>  
“It’s about remembering.” <words>381</words>  
The heart blazed, its light surging through the cavern, melting the thorns, dissolving Veyra’s snarl into a gasp of recognition. <words>401</words>  
In the library, the mercury stilled. <words>407</words>  
Elara’s rosebud, now fresh and crimson, rested atop the grimoire. <words>419</words>  
Beyond the ruins, dawn broke—soft, insistent—as somewhere, a child laughed, and a soldier lowered his sword. <words>439</words>
