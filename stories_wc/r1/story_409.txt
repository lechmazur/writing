The attic’s dust motes hung suspended, as though time itself paused at the moment the sculptor’s chisel struck marble three streets away—a vibration that stirred the clockwork menagerie into whirring life. (30 words) <words>30</words>  

Kael, the bruised fighter, winced as his split knuckles brushed a gear-lion’s flank, its brass mane clicking. He’d come here to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception: the lie that he’d ever fought for anything but survival. (56 words) <words>56</words>  

Beneath a moth-eaten tarp, he found it—the clay pot shard, its inscription half-buried in grime. “Stand,” it commanded in archaic script, “or be stood upon.” His mother’s voice, fragmented yet unmistakable. (83 words) <words>83</words>  

The attic dimmed. Clockwork owls swiveled their heads, glass eyes reflecting a figure in the doorway—a woman with marble dust clinging to her hands. The sculptor. She smiled, skillfully incompetent, her gaze a scalpel. “You’ve been abducted,” she said, “through forgotten dreams.” (123 words) <words>123</words>  

Kael lunged, but his fists met only clockwork rabbits, their springs snapping under his blows. The sculptor laughed. “You’ve spent years perfecting the art of losing. Admirable, if tragic.” (150 words) <words>150</words>  

The shard’s edges bit his palm. “Why?” he demanded. The owls hooted a mechanical dirge. “Because you’re the last one who remembers,” she said, lifting a key shaped like a chisel. “And memories are inconvenient.” (178 words) <words>178</words>  

He’d seen her before—in the periphery of childhood fevers, in the way his opponents’ eyes glazed mid-bout. She was the void where conviction went to die. But the shard’s inscription pulsed, a heartbeat in clay. (214 words) <words>214</words>  

The gear-lion roared, its jaws snapping at Kael’s throat. He pivoted, driving the shard into its ocular lens. Sparks rained as the beast crumpled. “Stand,” his mother whispered through centuries. (243 words) <words>243</words>  

The sculptor’s smile faltered. She thrust the key into the attic’s central clock, its hands accelerating—yesterday, tomorrow, collapsing. Kael’s bruises ached with the weight of every unkept promise. (270 words) <words>270</words>  

He limped toward her, shard raised. “You abduct ghosts,” he spat. “But I’m still here.” The key shattered under his strike, time stuttering. The menagerie stilled. (293 words) <words>293</words>  

In the silence, the shard’s missing pieces glinted among the wreckage. Kael gathered them, each fragment a syllable: “Stand for the fallen. Stand for the silent. Stand…” (317 words) <words>317</words>  

The sculptor dissolved into marble dust, her final sigh etching the attic’s sole window with frost. Dawn bled through, illuminating the reassembled pot—a vessel, now whole, brimming with light. (343 words) <words>343</words>  

Kael cradled it, his reflection warped in the glaze. Not a fighter. A keeper. The clockwork creatures stirred again, but gently, their gears aligned to a new rhythm. (367 words) <words>367</words>  

Three streets away, the sculptor’s chisel struck anew, carving not marble, but air—a statue of absences. Kael descended the attic stairs, the pot’s warmth seeping into his bruises. (394 words) <words>394</words>  

Outside, the city breathed. He placed the pot on a windowsill where sunlight pooled. A child paused, tracing the inscription. “What’s it mean?” she asked. (416 words) <words>416</words>  

Kael flexed his healing hand. “It means we’re done running.” (424 words) <words>424</words>
