<story>  
The aimless traveler wandered into the writing system archive, her boots scattering dust that hadn’t stirred in decades. <words>25</words>  
She carried a faded floral handkerchief, its embroidered violets frayed but still whispering her grandmother’s voice: *“Preserve what they tried to erase.”* <words>50</words>  
The archive’s cavernous halls held crumbling codices and glyph-etched tablets, but it was the courtyard’s dusty hopscotch board that snagged her gaze—its chalk lines blurred, yet humming with intent. <words>80</words>  
Kneeling, she traced the numbered squares, fingertips registering subtle ridges beneath the grime: not random, but a cipher of angular strokes. <words>100</words>  
*“Seeds of vigilance,”* she murmured, recalling the phrase from her grandmother’s stories—stories where recipes were maps, and spices guarded truths. <words>122</words>  

Snowflakes drifted through the broken skylight; one settled on her wrist, melting as she deciphered the hopscotch’s secret patterns. <words>140</words>  
Each jump symbol matched a radical in the ancient script overhead, a key to unlock the archive’s culinary scrolls. <words>157</words>  
But time bled faster than the snowflake’s demise—she had minutes before the light shifted and the code vanished. <words>175</words>  

Factually imaginative, her mind straddled logic and legend: if she “grilled” the symbols like skewered meats, rotating them over memory’s flame, their meanings might char into legibility. <words>203</words>  
She unfolded the handkerchief, its fabric stiff with old saffron and salt, and pressed it against the stones. <words>220</words>  
The hopscotch’s glyphs transferred faintly, a mirror-image recipe for maize cakes once offered to rain gods. <words>237</words>  

Her breath hitched—mournful elation swelling as she transcribed measurements in ash-paste, saving rituals that colonization had burned to whispers. <words>257</words>  
But vigilance required sowing, not just saving. <words>264</words>  
From her pocket, she scattered amaranth seeds into the courtyard’s cracks, each grain a rebellion against oblivion. <words>282</words>  

Footsteps echoed—an archivist’s shadow loomed, skeptical of her fervor. <words>292</words>  
“This is a library, not a kitchen,” he chided, eyeing her spices. <words>305</words>  
She grinned, sharp as a grinding stone. <words>313</words>  
“Every recipe is a treaty,” she said, thrusting the handkerchief’s transcription toward him. <words>329</words>  
“Taste the ink. It’s got chili sunsets in it.” <words>339</words>  

He hesitated, then licked the cloth,瞳孔 dilating as ancestral flavors erupted—roasted squash, epazote, memory. <words>359</words>  
Silence pooled, sacred and fragile as the dissolved snowflake. <words>372</words>  
When he spoke again, his voice crackled like comal-fired tortillas. <words>385</words>  
“There’s a cellar… older scripts. They mention a drink made from lightning-struck agave.” <words>403</words>  

She followed, her heart a drum matched to the hopscotch’s rhythm, the seeds already splitting green beneath their feet. <words>424</words>  
Above them, the archive’s ghosts leaned close, mouths watering. <words>436</words>
