The slapdash bard plucked his lute with one hand and clutched the brass doorplate with the other, its engraved words—“Sanctum Tremor”—glinting faintly as he sprinted toward the cliff’s edge. <words>34</words>  
Here, where two tectonic plates ground against each other like quarreling gods, his family had picnicked for generations, laying checkered blankets over fractures that hummed with subterranean hymns. <words>68</words>  
Today, though, the tradition wasn’t about nostalgia; it was about survival. <words>82</words>  
Death had slipped into his shadow three moons prior, its breath frosting his neck each dusk, and only this sacred space—this shuddering, unstable altar—could disrupt its pursuit. <words>108</words>  
“Melancholy and mirth, eh?” he muttered, arranging wilted violets and a wedge of moldering cheese atop the doorplate, an offering as haphazard as his rhymes. <words>134</words>  
The ritual required precision, but precision wasn’t his forte; he’d always preferred the possibly impossible, the cracks where chaos and hope bled together. <words>157</words>  
As the hourglass beside him began to invert, its crimson sand pooling upward, he struck a chord sharp enough to split the air. <words>178</words>  
The ground groaned. <words>180</words>  
Fissures spiderwebbed beneath his boots, exhaling geysers of sulfur and whispers from the earth’s molten core. <words>197</words>  
“Ah, right—the song,” he laughed, a sound tinged with manic glee, and sang the verses his grandmother had taught him, each syllable meant to stitch the plates into temporary truce. <words>225</words>  
But his fingers fumbled, transmuting sacred melody into a jaunty tavern jig. <words>237</words>  
The cliffside shuddered violently, and the doorplate slid toward the abyss. <words>249</words>  
Death’s chuckle echoed through the vapors—dry, rasping, inexorable. <words>260</words>  
Panic clawing his throat, the bard lunged, grabbing the brass relic just as the hourglass’s final grains defied gravity. <words>279</words>  
In that suspended second, he pressed the doorplate to his chest and let his voice fracture. <words>295</words>  
Not perfection, but raw, ragged truth: a ballad of sunlit picnics, of his mother’s laughter, of the way sacredness dwelled not in flawlessness, but in the stubborn act of return. <words>323</words>  
The plates stilled. <words>325</words>  
The sands settled. <words>328</words>  
And Death—how strange—paused. <words>332</words>  
“Clever,” it sighed, a grudging breeze against his cheek. <words>342</words>  
“You’ve made a sanctuary of your own recklessness.” <words>351</words>  
The bard grinned, sweat-drenched and trembling, as the doorplate warmed against his skin, its inscription now glowing with fractured light. <words>372</words>  
“Call it… a family trait,” he wheezed, tossing the hourglass into the chasm like a dare. <words>388</words>  
Above, the sky split into dawn’s first blush, and he sprawled onto the trembling earth, cheese clutched triumphantly in his fist. <words>409</words>  
Death retreated, not vanished but outwitted, as the bard hummed a off-key tune—a dirge and a lullaby, stitched through with the unkillable joy of having, against all arithmetic, *lived*. <words>438</words>  
Around him, the cliff’s wounds began to knit, slow and grudging, the sacred space reshaped by slapdash hands. <words>457</words>  
He’d return next year, of course. <words>463</words>  
Tradition demanded it. <words>466</words>  
And besides, he’d already composed a new verse for the occasion. <words>478</words>
