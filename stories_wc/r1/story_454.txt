<story>The funhouse entrance loomed like a gaping jaw, its peeling clown face grinning beneath a flickering neon halo, and Dex tightened his grip on the glass-encased four-leaf clover in his pocket—his last charm against the park’s hungry ghosts.<words>45</words> Three synchronized watch alarms chimed simultaneously: his, the one buried in the funhouse’s rusted gears, and Lira’s, wherever she was now.<words>72</words> Their shared ritual, a rationally emotional pact to mark each step toward the outsider crew’s approval, even as the map in his other hand tore cleanly along the dotted line labeled “Here Be Nightmares.”<words>113</words> Dex stepped over the fissure where pavement cracked into writhing shadows, the divide between the abandoned park’s hollow laughter and whatever waited beyond.<words>140</words>  

“Dramatize the danger, they said,” he muttered, eyeing the funhouse mirrors warping his scarred face into grotesque shapes.<words>161</words> The crew’s initiation demanded spectacle—proof he’d risk more than stolen cargo.<words>178</words> So he’d chosen the one relic even they feared: the clover plucked from the park founder’s grave, sealed in glass that hummed with residual luck.<words>207</words> Lira’s voice echoed in his memory, sharp as their last argument: “You’ll die proving you belong to people who’ll never care.”<words>234</words> But her watch still synced to his, a distant companionship etched in beeps and silence.<words>252</words>  

Inside, the floor tilted, hurling him against a wall of screeching mannequins.<words>267</words> Their painted eyes followed as he crawled toward a pulsing red exit sign—too steady, too deliberate.<words>286</words> A trap.<words>287</words> Dex lobbed the clover’s glass case ahead; it shattered, releasing a green glow that dissolved the false door.<words>307</words> The real path materialized: a tunnel of spinning blades timed to his racing heartbeat.<words>326</words> “Theatrical bastards,” he laughed, breathless, because despair tasted sweeter when you named it.<words>345</words>  

The final chamber stank of burnt sugar and iron.<words>355</words> There, hovering above a carousel of skeletal horses, was the crew’s desired prize—the founder’s ledger, bound in ghostly chains.<words>378</words> Dex’s watch buzzed again: Lira’s alarm, a vibration against his wristbone.<words>395</words> He hesitated.<words>396</words> The crew hadn’t mentioned the ledger’s guardian—a figure woven from smoke and his mother’s voice, crooning, *Stay, stay, you’ve always been enough.*<words>424</words> Jubilation curdled in his throat.<words>429</words>  

He smashed the clover’s remnants into the chains.<words>440</words> The park wailed.<words>443</words> When the crew found him dawn-drenched and grinning at the funhouse threshold, ledger in hand, they cheered.<words>462</words> Only Dex noticed the new crack in his watch face, the silence where Lira’s alarm had been.<words>482</words> He let them hoist him onto their shoulders anyway, his triumph a dirge in a major key.<words>504</words> Some acceptances, he realized, are just elegies with confetti.<words>518</words></story>
