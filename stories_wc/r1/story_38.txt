The insomniac poet’s attic was a meticulously messy collage of pressed leaves, ink-stained journals, and botanical samples suspended in amber jars—each labeled in a frantic cursive that even she couldn’t decipher. <words>34</words>  
Between subway stops, when the train’s hum flattened into a breathless pause, the whispers began: warnings coiled like smoke through floorboards, urging her to *eliminate* the thing festering beneath her desk. <words>69</words>  
She’d named it “the guest”—a presence that rattled jars and smudged her verses with soil, its voice a static-laced murmur she’d first mistaken for sleep deprivation. <words>99</words>  
But the ghost wasn’t here for poetry. <words>105</words>  
It wanted the plants. <words>109</words>  
At after-parties, where poets traded metaphors like currency, she drank gin until her tongue loosened and confessed to strangers about the attic’s hunger. <words>132</words>  
“It’s the ivy,” slurred a botanist one night, his breath sour with regret. <words>143</words>  
“Harvested from a cemetery—roots feed on grief. You’ve got a poltergeist gardener.” <words>155</words>  
She laughed, but by dawn, the ivy had strangled her typewriter keys. <words>167</words>  
Non-violence, she realized, required listening. <words>173</words>  
The ghost’s whispers, she learned, weren’t threats but pleas: the botanical samples were stolen, their original soil still clinging to unresolved lives. <words>195</words>  
Each specimen—a war casualty, a love uprooted. <words>202</words>  
Her attic wasn’t haunted; it was a refugee camp. <words>210</words>  
Between subway stops, she began replanting. <words>216</words>  
Petals unfurled into apologies, stems bent like penitent spines. <words>225</words>  
When the ghost manifested—a silhouette of tangled vines—she offered the ivy back, jar trembling in her hands. <words>243</words>  
“Take it,” she said. <words>246</words>  
The attic exhaled. <words>249</words>  
Jars emptied themselves, soil returning to unmarked graves, and for the first time in years, she slept. <words>266</words>  
But peace, she discovered, was an empty abundance. <words>274</words>  
Her desk stayed meticulously messy, her poems now filled with spaces where leaves had once been pressed. <words>290</words>  
At after-parties, she drank less, spoke softer. <words>298</words>  
Strangers mistook her quiet for melancholy, but she was relearning silence—how to hold it without crushing its stem. <words>318</words>  
The subway’s rhythm became her liturgy: between stops, she’d whisper names the ghost had left behind, each syllable a seed. <words>337</words>  
One night, a man with cemetery dirt under his nails approached her. <words>348</words>  
“I heard,” he said, “you bury things alive.” <words>357</words>  
She gave him a jar of clover. <words>363</words>  
“Plant it where you dug,” she replied. <words>370</words>  
He cried into his whiskey, and she wondered if forgiveness could compost shame. <words>383</words>  
By winter, her attic housed only a single rosemary sprig—its scent a quiet elegy. <words>398</words>  
The ghost never thanked her. <words>402</words>  
But sometimes, when the subway stalled, she felt a breeze brush her cheek, carrying the faintest hint of jasmine. <words>422</words>  
It smelled like a beginning. <words>427</words>  
She wrote a poem about that. <words>432</words>
