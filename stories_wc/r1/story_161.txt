The vigilant orchardist arrived at the paper airplane test facility precisely at dawn, her boots crunching gravel with the rhythm of a metronome—she was never tardy, not since the accident that hollowed her voice three years prior. <words>45</words>  
Volunteering here, among engineers obsessed with aerodynamics, had been her therapist’s idea: *“Fold grief into purpose,”* they’d said. <words>72</words>  
But today, between calibrating wing angles and logging flight trajectories, she found an antique letter seal wedged beneath a desk, its wax surface etched with a peacock’s iridescent tail. <words>105</words>  
The design mirrored the patterns she’d studied for decades in her orchard—blight-resistant apple grafts hidden in feathery swirls—and suddenly, the facility’s sterile walls felt like a stage for unraveling conspiracies. <words>143</words>  

Her sardonic glee sharpened as she traced the seal’s grooves. <words>155</words>  
It belonged to the facility’s late founder, a man whose “suicide” had coincided with her husband’s fatal car crash—a collision authorities dismissed as reckless driving. <words>182</words>  
Coincidences, she’d learned, were just conspiracies wearing gloves. <words>192</words>  
By noon, she’d cross-referenced flight logs with the seal’s patterns, discovering coded coordinates in the peacock’s tail: locations of illegal surveillance drones masquerading as paper airplanes. <words>227</words>  

“Observe,” she announced to the bewildered staff at dusk, her voice brittle but triumphant, as she launched a modified glider. <words>249</words>  
It arced skyward, its wings unfolding to project the peacock’s design across the clouds—a demonstration of how beauty could weaponize truth. <words>272</words>  
The founder had been murdered for uncovering this, her husband for stumbling upon it during his delivery route. <words>292</words>  
Grief, she realized, wasn’t a void but a lens. <words>302</words>  

As authorities swarmed the facility, she pocketed the seal, its weight a promise. <words>316</words>  
Tomorrow, she’d return to her orchard, where pear blossoms hid data drives and scarecrows stood sentinel over encrypted files. <words>337</words>  
Conspiracies thrived in shadows, but so did apple roots—slow, relentless, cracking concrete. <words>352</words>  
She smiled, sharp as a grafting knife, ready to cultivate justice from the rot. <words>366</words>  

The engineers whispered that she’d gone mad, but madness, she knew, was just vigilance without permission. <words>385</words>  
Let them gossip. <words>388</words>  
Her husband’s ghost lounged in her sardonic glee, clapping as she folded another airplane, its wings tipped with peach pits and vengeance. <words>411</words>  
Some tragedies grew wings; hers had learned to soar. <words>423</words>
