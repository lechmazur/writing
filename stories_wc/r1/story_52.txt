The time-worn marketplace inside the giant hourglass hummed with barter and bluster, its sand-polished stalls arranged like concentric rings in a tree stump. <words>28</words> Lira, a pickpocket with calloused fingers and a smile sharp enough to slit coin purses, danced between crowds, her hopeful gaze lingering on bulging pockets. <words>52</words> She clutched the broken pencil sharpener in her palm—its blade dull, its screw missing—a relic from the sibling whose lungs now crackled like parchment. <words>81</words> When the chalk lines on the sidewalk faded away, signaling the hourglass’s imminent inversion, she’d need enough stolen silver to buy the medicine that staved off his death. <words>111</words>  

A vendor hawked “tastefully offensive” trinkets nearby: porcelain frogs flipping obscene gestures, lockets engraved with elegantly phrased curses. <words>134</words> Lira scoffed but paused when a man in a moth-eaten velvet coat belted a ballad from the makeshift karaoge stage, his voice raw as salt-rubbed wounds. <words>158</words> “Sing with me,” he demanded, thrusting a mic toward her, “or watch your brother’s breath turn to dust.” <words>177</words> The threat, wrapped in melody, froze her—how did he know? <words>187</words>  

Their duet materialized like a bruise: sudden, tender, inevitable. <words>195</words> Lira’s voice trembled as she harmonized, the lyrics weaving a secret she’d sworn to bury—the night she’d let their parents’ caravan burn to hide her theft. <words>220</words> The crowd cheered, mistaking her confession for theatrics. <words>229</words> Velvet Coat grinned, his teeth glinting. “Devotion’s a rot that eats from the inside out,” he crooned, tossing her a vial of amber liquid. <words>252</words> Medicine. <words>253</words>  

Sand began cascading upward as the hourglass flipped, stalls dissolving into golden mist. <words>267</words> Lira sprinted home, the vial burning her grip, the pencil sharpener’s broken edges biting her skin. <words>282</words> Her brother coughed, a wet, crumbling sound. <words>290</words> “I knew you’d come,” he whispered. <words>296</words> She pressed the vial to his lips, her blithe laugh fraying at the edges. <words>310</words> “Traded a soul for a song. Tastefully offensive, don’t you think?” <words>324</words>  

He drank, his eyes brightening briefly before dimming. <words>333</words> The secret settled between them, a shared scar. <words>341</words> Outside, the marketplace reformed, its new chalk lines gleaming like fresh sutures. <words>354</words> Lira spun the broken sharpener, its mechanism screeching—a sound like forgiveness, like a promise. <words>371</words> Tomorrow, she’d steal again. <words>376</words> Tonight, she hummed their duet, its notes threading through the depths of devotion, stitching shut what the fire had split. <words>400</words> Velvet Coat’s laughter echoed in the settling sand, a question she’d answer when the chalk faded once more. <words>421</words>
