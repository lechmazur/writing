<story>  
The arrogant swordsman kicked open the calligraphy master’s courtyard gate, his blade clattering against the stone archway. <words>20</words>  
"Your ink-stained hands will teach me the final stroke," he demanded, tossing a faded tapestry fragment onto the master’s tea table—a relic of his family’s crest, frayed by generations of doubtfully confident heirs. <words>50</words>  
The master sipped bitter tea, unmoved. "You swing steel like a child swings sticks," she said, her voice a blend of harsh tenderness and autumn wind. <words>73</words>  
Between breaths, the swordsman’s sneer faltered; the courtyard’s silence amplified the shackled potential humming beneath his skin, a caged storm he’d named "destiny." <words>95</words>  
At dusk, the master unrolled the tapestry, revealing a lyric stitched in forgotten script—a traditional song sung at every family wedding, one the swordsman had buried with his parents’ ashes. <words>124</words>  
"Sing it," she ordered, "or leave your blade here as a paperweight." <words>137</words>  
He refused, yet the melody escaped anyway, brittle as winter reeds, as he traced the words: *"Where shadow chokes the lantern’s breath, the spark must rise from certain death."* <words>165</words>  
The master seized his wrist. "You’ve memorized steps but not the dance. Authorize your soul to bleed, fool, or this courtyard will become your tomb." <words>189</words>  
Moonlight hardened the air. The swordsman’s fingers trembled—not from fear, but the weight of a truth he’d armored in arrogance. <words>210</words>  
When bandits descended at midnight, torches extinguishing the horizon, he understood his task: deliver a spark where all lights had gone out. <words>233</words>  
The master thrust a brush into his grip. "Write the song’s end with their blood." <words>247</words>  
He fought, not with the flourish of a showman but the precision of a man unweaving his own noose. <words>266</words>  
Each parry etched the wedding hymn into the earth; each strike unraveled the tapestry’s threads, stitching their glow into his blade. <words>286</words>  
By the final foe, his steel shimmered like a resurrected sun. <words>297</words>  
The master nodded. "You mistook confidence for power. Now, *breathe*." <words>310</words>  
Between one breath and the next, he let the song consume him—not as a dirge, but a drumbeat. <words>328</words>  
The tapestry’s threads ignited, searing the bandits’ shadows into ash. <words>340</words>  
When dawn came, the courtyard stood unscathed, the master’s brushstrokes already healing the scorched earth. <words>357</words>  
The swordsman knelt, offering his blade. "Teach me to hold more than rage." <words>371</words>  
She snapped the sword across her knee. "Return when you’ve woven a new tapestry from the threads you’ve burned." <words>390</words>  
He left lighter, the hymn humming in his ribs, no longer a prisoner of his name. <words>407</words>  
Some say he wanders still, a man reforged between breaths, stitching sparks into the dark. <words>425</words>
