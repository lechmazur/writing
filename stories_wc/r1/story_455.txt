The disgruntled wishing-well attendant leaned against the mossy stone rim, fingers idly tracing the grooves of a 17th-century Spanish doubloon. <words>25</words> His job—collecting foreign coins tossed by hopeful fools—had once felt like curating fragments of dreams, but now the rusted metals only whispered of broken promises. <words>51</words> The weight of scars, he mused, wasn’t in their sting but in their silence: the way his father’s disapproval still etched his spine rigid, even decades after the man’s ghost had abandoned him. <words>83</words>  

Today, though, the attendant wore an air of intensely relaxed focus, like a cat sunning itself atop a loaded crossbow. <words>103</words> Three nights prior, he’d discovered a pattern: shadows from the ancient oak above the well didn’t just dance at noon—they slithered, aligning with cracks in the cobblestones to form an arrowhead. <words>134</words> A secret agent escape route, perhaps, left by the Cold War operatives who’d allegedly drowned here in 1967. <words>152</words>  

He waited until the sun straddled the horizon—the crossing of two unwritten paths, when dawn’s blush met twilight’s sigh—and dropped a Burmese kyat into the well. <words>178</words> The coin’s clink echoed oddly, as if striking glass instead of water. <words>190</words> A grinding shuddered beneath his boots; the oak’s shadow sharpened into a blade of darkness pointing northeast. <words>208</words>  

“Corroborate,” he muttered, recalling the word from a half-burned dossier he’d found in the well’s maintenance shed. <words>225</words> Following the shadow’s path, he counted 13 paces to a lichen-crusted wall where a Romanian leu fit perfectly into a fissure. <words>244</words> The wall pivoted, revealing a tunnel smelling of gun oil and bergamot. <words>256</words>  

Inside, spectral faces flickered on the damp bricks: old ghosts—his father’s frost-edged glare, the double agent who’d framed him, the lover who’d dissolved into a Prague snowfall. <words>283</words> Their silent judgments pressed like thumbs against his windpipe, but he straightened, clutching a Tanzanian shilling like a talisman. <words>303</words> “You think I’m still the boy who flinches?” he hissed, the coin’s giraffe emblem warm against his palm. <words>323</words>  

The tunnel spilled into a moonlit grove where a figure materialized—a woman with his father’s eyes and a sniper’s stillness. <words>343</words> “You shouldn’t have come back,” she said, voice a relic of inherited mystery. <words>357</words>  

He smiled, spinning a Haitian gourde between his knuckles. <words>367</words> “I’m not here to dig up graves. I’m here to plant a garden.” <words>380</words> The coin arced through the air; she caught it reflexively, and the grove erupted in fireflies—or were they camera lenses glinting? <words>401</words>  

As dawn fractured the sky, the attendant retraced his steps, foreign coins clinking in his pocket like liberated teeth. <words>420</words> The scars still ached, but now they bent with him, shaping their weight into a compass rather than an anchor. <words>440</words> At the well, he pocketed a newly tossed Icelandic króna, its silver edge catching the light—a fresh shadow already stretching east. <words>463</words>
