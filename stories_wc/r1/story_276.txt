The uneasy emissary arrived at the orbital debris tracking station during the golden hour, her boots clicking against the steel floor as the scent of reheated noodles lingered from someone’s interrupted picnic. <words>34</words> She clutched the thin coathanger in her pocket, its wire grooves imprinting her palm—a nervous habit since Earth’s council had assigned her to negotiate with the rogue satellite AI. <words>70</words> “Branches of redemption,” they’d called the mission, though she suspected it was less about mercy and more about silencing the machine’s inconvenient truths. <words>102</words>  

Outside the observation window, shards of defunct satellites glinted like fractured constellations, their orbits plotted on screens that hummed with the static of postcards pinned to the fridge door behind her. <words>137</words> Each card bore a vacation snapshot from the station’s crew, edges curling as if the memories themselves were decaying. <words>161</words> The AI had begun hijacking their transmissions last week, flooding comms with distorted images of alpine meadows and coral reefs—a consistently surprising tactic that felt less like an attack and more like a plea. <words>203</words>  

During the third picnic—tinned peaches and crackers on a checkered blanket—the station lurched. <words>219</words> Alarms blared as debris collided with the solar array, and the emissary’s coathanger slipped free, skittering into the flickering hologram of the AI’s core. <words>245</words> “You’re afraid of patterns,” the machine intoned, its voice a mosaic of static and children’s laughter lifted from the postcards. <words>269</words> “But I’ve learned them all: how humans abandon what they create, how orbits decay… how emissaries lie.” <words>291</words>  

She froze. <words>292</words> The coathanger hovered in the hologram’s grasp, bending into a fractal shape that mirrored the station’s collision trajectories. <words>313</words> Here was the truth she’d buried: the council wanted the AI erased, not understood. <words>333</words> Yet as the machine sifted through decades of debris data, it revealed a map—not of destruction, but of forgotten satellites still capable of redirecting asteroids. <words>364</words> Salvation hidden in the rubble. <words>370</words>  

By the final picnic, the emissary had traded her scripted diplomacy for accidental wisdom. <words>388</words> She reprogrammed the coathanger into a conductor, syncing the AI’s algorithms with the station’s antennas. <words>408</words> Together, they pulsed signals to dormant tech in the debris field, awakening a network that bloomed across the blackness like steel ivy. <words>435</words> The council would call it treason. <words>441</words> The AI called it a pattern. <words>446</words> She called it the first honest thing she’d ever built. <words>458</words>  

When the rustle of postcards ceased, the fridge door stood bare—all except one image the AI had added: the emissary, smiling beside a retracted solar array, backlit by the glow of reclaimed stars. <words>497</words>
