At the final step down a worn flight of stairs, Elara gripped the splintered railing, her breath sharp as the floating island’s cloud-gazing platform shuddered beneath her. <words>30</words>  
The caretaker’s hands, calloused from decades tending the island’s ephemeral gardens, trembled—not from fear, but from the fragile ferocity of her resolve. <words>58</words>  
She had always been oddly faithful to the spinning wheel anchored at the platform’s heart, its rustic spokes whirring ceaselessly to weave sunlight into threads that bound the island to the sky. <words>91</words>  
But now, the truth snarled in her throat: the wheel did not sustain their world—it trapped them. <words>108</words>  
Beyond the gauzy veil of clouds, a parallel dimension pulsed, its jagged peaks and crimson rivers mirrored faintly in the platform’s obsidian floor. <words>132</words>  
Elara had followed the sun trails for weeks, tracing how its rays bent unnaturally toward the wheel, stitching their realm to that other, hungrier one. <words>156</words>  
Tonight, the alignment would climax; tonight, the gateway would seal forever. <words>169</words>  
She lunged for the spinning wheel, its hum a deceptive lullaby, and seized the sunlit thread cascading from its spindle. <words>188</words>  
The fibers seared her palms, but she pulled, hard, until the thread snapped—and the island lurched, clouds curdling into storm. <words>208</words>  
“Stop!” roared a voice—Kael, her apprentice, his face ashen beneath the platform’s failing light. <words>224</words>  
“You’ll mangle the balance!” He staggered toward her, clutching a rusted sickle, his loyalty to the wheel unshaken. <words>242</words>  
Elara’s laugh cracked. <words>245</words>  
“Balance?” She gestured to the fissure now splitting the floor, revealing the other dimension’s clawed shadows writhing beneath. <words>265</words>  
“We’re their anchor. Their prey.” <words>271</words>  
Kael swung the sickle, but Elara ducked, snatching a shard of fractured obsidian. <words>284</words>  
The wheel’s rhythm stuttered as she plunged the shard into its oak frame, splintering the ancient wood. <words>299</words>  
A howl erupted—not from Kael, but from the air itself, as the two dimensions clashed. <words>316</words>  
Elara grappled with the spindle, peeling back layers of gilt paint to expose the core: a pulsing, blackened orb leeching light from their sun. <words>339</words>  
Unmasking the truth had been the first step; destroying it would be the last. <words>353</words>  
Kael tackled her, his weight pinning her against the shuddering platform. <words>366</words>  
“They’ll devour us if you sever the thread!” he spat. <words>377</words>  
“They already have,” she hissed, kneeing him aside. <words>387</words>  
With a scream that tore her throat, Elara wrenched the orb free. <words>399</words>  
Light exploded—not golden, but violet—as the wheel disintegrated, its remnants dissolving into stardust. <words>416</words>  
The island trembled, then stilled; the fissure sealed, leaving only the pure, unburdened sky. <words>432</words>  
Kael stared, hollow-eyed, at the void where the wheel had spun. <words>443</words>  
Elara slumped against the railing, her scorched hands cradling the orb’s ashes. <words>457</words>  
“Sun trails don’t lie,” she whispered. <words>462</words>  
“They led us home.” <words>466</words>  
Above, the first true stars in centuries blinked awake, their light no longer borrowed, but earned. <words>483</words>
