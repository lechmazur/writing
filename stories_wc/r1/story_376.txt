The amber inkwell glimmered with a modestly flashy allure on the oak table, its golden veins catching the firelight of the reimagined Viking longhouse—now a shadowy wine hall where time pooled like spilled vintage. <words>38</words>  
Eirik, the rogue fortune teller, traced its rim, his eyes sharp as runestones beneath a hood embroidered with faded constellations. <words>61</words>  
He’d chosen this place for its hush, the way its smoke-stained beams and whispered sagas muffled the clatter of eras the world had overlooked. <words>86</words>  
Tonight, his quarry was not coin but the tremor in a patron’s voice, the flicker of a half-smile—emotional patterns to archive in the inkwell’s molten depths. <words>111</words>  
A woman approached, her steps a deliberate zigzag between tables, as though evading ghosts only she could see. <words>130</words>  
“You read futures,” she said, not a question, her accent Norse but her silks Byzantine—a merchant, then, or a smuggler. <words>150</words>  
Eirik gestured to the carafe between them. <words>157</words> “Futures are fickle. Wine is honest. Shall we taste?” <words>168</words>  
Her laugh was a blade sheathed in honey. <words>175</words> They drank: first a tart Frankish red, then a smoky Aegean resin, their conversation a dance of pauses and raised brows. <words>195</words>  
The unspoken offer hung like a hanged man’s shadow. <words>203</words> She wanted a prophecy untethered from truth; he wanted the storm behind her ribs, the grief she’d fermented into cunning. <words>223</words>  
When her fingers brushed the inkwell, he leaned close. <words>232</words> “It doesn’t hold fate,” he murmured. <words>238</words> “It holds what you’re willing to pour in.” <words>246</words>  
Her pulse leapt. <words>248</words> He saw it—the moment her resolve cracked, a vintage finally decanted. <words>262</words>  
She spoke of a dead lover, a betrayal in Constantinople, the way she’d bargained with emperors and thieves to drown the memory. <words>283</words>  
Eirik dipped his quill, capturing each word in amber, the inkwell humming as it sealed her fury and frailty into coiled, glowing script. <words>306</words>  
Outside, the wind snarled through the longhouse’s dragon-headed eaves, but here, in their fierce repose, only the clink of cups and the scratch of the pen endured. <words>331</words>  
When dawn’s first bruise-colored light seeped through the shutters, the woman left, her silhouette a jagged hymn against the horizon. <words>351</words>  
Eirik closed the inkwell, its weight heavier now, another soul’s essence archived beside a hundred others. <words>368</words>  
He lingered, swirling the dregs of his wine—a Thessalian white, crisp as a lie. <words>382</words> The longhouse creaked, its ancient timbers cradling secrets older than the sagas. <words>397</words>  
Somewhere, a raven cawed. <words>401</words> He smiled. <words>403</words> Tomorrow, another vintage would arrive, another heart ripe for unraveling. <words>417</words>  
The inkwell’s glow dimmed, patient as a tomb, ready to swallow the next confession the world had no ears to hear. <words>438</words>
