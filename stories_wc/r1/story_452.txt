<story>  
Officer Mira Kelvar adjusted her plain brown belt buckle—her father’s last gift—as neon rain slid down the police station’s grimy windows. <words>25</words> The cyberpunk city outside thrummed with glitching holograms and the static hum of collapsed narratives, its stories fractured after the Great Unspooling ended all tales. <words>50</words> Yet Mira, the precinct’s softhearted champion, still believed in beginnings. <words>62</words>  

Each midnight, she slipped into the shuttered Astraios Planetarium, its dome dormant since the corporations privatized the stars. <words>83</words> There, beneath cracked constellations, she fed the belt buckle into an archaic projector, its gears whirring to life. <words>101</words> The machine’s purpose? To stabilize the unraveling fate of a city choking on its own entropy. <words>121</words>  

“Organic patterns only,” she whispered, recalibrating celestial algorithms with a smuggled quantum chip. <words>139</words> The corporations’ code was rigid, all profit-metrics and control grids, but Mira’s adjustments were consistently organic—gentle nudges mimicking cosmic tides. <words>164</words> Tonight, the projector flickered, etching a new cosmic signature into the datastream: a rogue star cluster pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>187</words>  

Back at the station, Sergeant Vex sneered at her reports. <words>196</words> “Wasting time on fairy tales, Kelvar? Stories are *over*.” <words>207</words> Mira smiled faintly, fingertips brushing the buckle’s engraved coordinates—Astraios’s latitude, her father’s final arrest. <words>226</words> He’d died protecting the planetarium’s archives, convinced they held a “language older than gods.” <words>243</words>  

By her fourth visit, the city’s chaos dimmed. <words>251</words> Gangs laid down arms near zones where Mira’s constellations glowed; AIs hallucinated sonnets in their code. <words>268</words> Yet euphoria felt dangerous here—a muted warmth, like dawn hesitant to breach smog. <words>285</words> She traced the buckle’s edges, wondering if her father felt this fragile hope while handcuffing warlords. <words>304</words>  

On the fifth night, corporate enforcers stormed Astraios. <words>312</words> Mira hid in Orion’s shadow as they gutted the projector, but not before she uploaded her final sequence: a black hole’s song, tender and devouring. <words>337</words> The next morning, the precinct’s screens flickered. <words>345</words> A singularity bloomed above the city, its gravity stitching fractures in reality’s fabric. <words>363</words>  

Vex stared, slack-jawed, as drones pirouetted in sudden harmony. <words>374</words> “What the hell did you do?” <words>381</words> Mira fastened her buckle, its plain surface now thrumming with starlight. <words>394</words> “Gave them a pattern too alive to control.” <words>404</words>  

Outside, the air tasted of ionized rain and possibility. <words>415</words> The city’s wounds remained, but its pulse steadied—a symphony of small, defiant truths. <words>430</words> Mira walked home, her father’s legacy humming at her waist, and let herself believe in a story not yet written. <words>451</words>
