The feisty stablehand, Jessa, gripped the antique oil lamp as the rover jostled through asteroid gravel, its headlights carving paths through the space debris art studio’s skeletal installations. <words>34</words> She’d stolen the lamp three car rides ago from a collector who’d dismissed its engravings as “rustic nonsense”—but Jessa recognized the glyphs of the Luminari, a civilization that encoded wisdom in molten glass. <words>74</words> Her knuckles whitened; preserving their ancient methods meant outsmarting the smugglers tailing her, and her only leverage was the lamp’s secret: it could morph matter, provided one solved its riddles. <words>114</words>  

“Think, sparks,” she muttered, her tone quietly bold as she balanced the lamp on her knees and splayed the half-torn tickets from a forgotten carnival booth across the dash. <words>144</words> Each frayed stub bore fragments of a Luminari puzzle—a childhood souvenir from the orbital fairs her mother once rigged. <words>166</words> The tickets’ numbers aligned with the lamp’s grooves, but one piece was missing. <words>182</words>  

Outside, sculptures of salvaged starship hulls loomed like ghosts. <words>191</words> Jessa’s com crackled: “Hand over the relic, or we melt your studio.” <words>203</words> She smirked, intellect playfully sharp. <words>209</words> “Melt it? You’d ruin a thousand-year-old smelting technique. <words>220</words> Here’s a counteroffer—” She slotted the tickets into the lamp, and its spout flared, casting holograms of celestial blueprints. <words>243</words> The rover’s engine stuttered. <words>247</words>  

“No no no—” The vehicle morphed, panels reshaped by the lamp’s glow into a kinetic sculpture, wheels pivoting to magnetic treads. <words>271</words> Jessa whooped as it vaulted onto a floating debris platform, pursuers’ lasers scorching empty dust. <words>287</words> Redemption wasn’t just saving the lamp; it was proving forgotten crafts could outpace greed. <words>304</words>  

She deciphered the final riddle mid-leap between asteroids: “A fire that cools, a shadow that illuminates.” <words>322</words> The answer? A forge. <words>326</words> Jessa thrust the lamp into the rover’s fuel port, and it dissolved, reforging the engine into a gleaming replication of a Luminari kiln. <words>348</words> Ancient methods preserved. <words>351</words>  

The smugglers cornered her at the studio’s core, a cavern of welded comet fragments. <words>366</words> Jessa ignited the kiln, its flames cold and radiant. <words>376</words> “You wanted a relic?” she said. <words>381</words> “Meet its keeper.” <words>384</words> The flames morphed into a towering figure of light, its voice a chorus of long-dead artisans. <words>401</words> The smugglers fled, and Jessa slumped, grinning. <words>412</words>  

Later, amid car rides to rebuild her studio, she’d recount how half-torn tickets and a stablehand’s grit turned raiders into patrons of lost arts. <words>437</words> The lamp, now a kiln, hummed in the rover’s heart—its redemptive act complete, but its puzzles still unsolved. <words>456</words> Jessa liked it that way. <words>460</words>
