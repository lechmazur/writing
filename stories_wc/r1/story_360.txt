<story>  
The underground city of the goblins hummed with the distant echoes of playground laughter, a peculiar counterpoint to the damp stone corridors where Elara, the meek necromancer, traced her trembling fingers over the tangled tapestry. <words>34</words>  
Its threads—woven from moonlight and shadow—depicted a riddle older than the goblins’ labyrinth itself, one she’d sworn to decode before the weight of her failures buried her. <words>68</words>  
Her fountain pen, its nib cracked like a fractured bone, hovered above parchment, ink pooling uselessly as she struggled to transcribe the tapestry’s shifting patterns. <words>97</words>  
“Peculiarly sincere, aren’t you?” croaked a goblin elder, materializing from the gloom, his moss-green eyes reflecting the faint glow of dew drops clinging to the cavern ceiling. <words>129</words>  
Elara flinched, clutching the pen tighter. <words>135</words> Sincerity was her curse: she spoke to ghosts not with commands, but apologies, and her magic flickered as timidly as her voice. <words>157</words>  
Yet the elder gestured to a dewdrop above, its surface warping the tapestry’s reflection into a coherent sigil. <words>176</words> “Light bends truth,” he rasped. <words>180</words> “Regain what’s broken by seeing through what’s whole.” <words>192</words>  
For days, Elara studied the dewdrops, their prismatic whispers revealing layers of the riddle: a song of equilibrium, binding life and death. <words>216</words> The broken nib, she realized, wasn’t a flaw but a key—its jagged edge caught the light differently, etching revelations into her parchment. <words>241</words>  
When playground cheers swelled at dusk, she finally understood. <words>251</words> The tapestry wasn’t a map but a mirror, its threads echoing the laughter’s rhythm, the dewdrops’ dance, the pen’s imperfect flow. <words>275</words> Life required fractures to refract meaning. <words>282</words>  
Steeling herself, she pressed the nib to her palm, letting blood and ink merge. <words>295</words> Shadows stirred as she whispered not to corpses, but to the silence between heartbeats, her sincerity weaving a new thread into the tapestry—a bridge between realms. <words>326</words>  
The goblins watched, breathless, as the cavern trembled. <words>334</words> Light fractured through dewdrops, stitching the riddle’s answer into the air: a single word, *balance*, etched in water and flame. <words>357</words>  
Elara’s pen fell, its purpose fulfilled. <words>363</words> The elder nodded. <words>365</words> “You didn’t solve the riddle,” he said, smiling. <words>374</words> “You became it.” <words>377</words>  
Aboveground, children’s laughter twined with the wind, while below, the necromancer walked home, her meekness softened into quiet resolve, the universal mystery now thrumming in her veins. <words>408</words>  
In her pocket, the broken nib gleamed, a humble shard of the infinite. <words>421</words>
