<story>  
The sapped herbalist slumped against the glass wall of the observatory, her fingers stained with crushed juniper and regret. <words>23</words>  
Outside, the ocean hurled itself against the cliff, its tide patterns scribbling secrets she’d spent years failing to decode. <words>43</words>  
The blacksmith’s bellows lay at her feet, its leather ribs wheezing like a dying hound—a relic she’d repurposed to stoke the kiln for her tinctures, though perfection still slipped through her cracks. <words>75</words>  
She’d napped here daily, lulled by the observatory’s hum of glass and brine, only to jolt awake each time the lone goose passed. <words>99</words>  
Its flight path, a precise arc over the eastern shoals, had become her reluctant compass: when shadow crossed glass, the tides shifted. <words>123</words>  
“Thoughtfully thoughtless,” she muttered, a self-rebuke for relying on instinct over calculation, yet cherishing the goose’s stubborn rhythm all the same. <words>147</words>  

Today, the kiln’s embers spat curses as she pumped the bellows, her motions mechanical, her mind adrift. <words>166</words>  
Perfection demanded everything—sleepless nights, singed sleeves, the way her hands now trembled measuring chamomile. <words>184</words>  
But the goose hadn’t come. <words>188</words>  
The tides, unmarked, swelled ravenous beneath her. <words>196</words>  
When exhaustion finally pinned her to the floor, she dreamed of her father’s forge: molten iron, his mantra—“heat and haste ruin the edge”—and woke choking on the irony. <words>226</words>  

Dusk bled through the glass. <words>229</words>  
There, against the bruised sky, the goose emerged, wings slicing a new trajectory westward. <words>246</words>  
She scrambled to her knees, charting its path with a charcoal stick, but the numbers clashed—tides shouldn’t peak for hours. <words>270</words>  
Yet the ocean roared, vindictive, waves clawing higher up the cliff. <words>285</words>  
The bellows shuddered in her grip; she’d misread it all. <words>297</words>  

Perfection wasn’t a formula. <words>300</words>  
It was the goose defying charts, the kiln’s flaws imbuing her elixirs with unexpected potency, the way the observatory’s glass magnified both stars and her own hollowed reflection. <words>334</words>  
She let the bellows drop. <words>338</words>  
Saltwind rushed in, snuffing the embers, and she laughed—raw, rare—as the rogue tide swallowed the shoals. <words>359</words>  
Let the herbs burn. <words>362</words>  
Let the goose stray. <words>365</words>  
Her hands, empty now, could finally hold something else. <words>377</words>  

By morning, the kiln was cold. <words>382</words>  
She perched on the cliff’s edge, watching the goose carve fresh patterns into the dawn. <words>400</words>  
Tides churned below, obedient only to their own chaotic calculus. <words>413</words>  
In her pocket, a single vial of imperfect lavender extract clinked—a relic of her surrender, its scent sweeter for the cracks. <words>437</words>  
The price of perfection, she decided, was a myth sold by fools who’d never tasted the salt of release. <words>458</words>  
She cherished the thought, tossed the vial into the surf, and walked away, the bellows’ ghost still whispering at her back. <words>483</words>
