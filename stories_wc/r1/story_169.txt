The floating tea platform hung motionless above the city’s recycling chasms, its brass gears frozen mid-rotation—a weirdly static island defying both gravity and logic. <words>30</words> Here, Lysander Voss, soul-broker real estate agent, sipped chamomile from a chipped saucer, his eyes scanning the labyrinth of dusty wine bottles cluttering the platform’s edges. <words>60</words> Each bottle, salvaged from the chasms below, bore reversed labels only he could decipher—glyphs that hummed with forgotten songs if read backward by lamplight. <words>90</words> “A soul’s value,” he often murmured with grandiose modesty, “lies not in its deeds, but in the music it leaves trapped in glass.” <words>117</words>  

Tonight, however, the art of persuasion faltered. <words>123</words> A client’s soul—a retired opera diva—demanded her childhood lullaby exhumed from a specific bottle before signing her afterlife’s deed. <words>145</words> Lysander’s fingers trembled as he choreographed the bottles into a spiral, their labels aligning like sheet music under the moon. <words>166</words> “Recycling’s eternity,” he muttered, “and I’m stuck playing sommelier for ghosts.” <words>179</words>  

The diva’s target was a cracked emerald bottle, its neck crusted with time. <words>194</words> Lysander squinted, tracing the inverted letters: *Mélodie de l’Oubli*. <words>205</words> As he mouthed the words backward, the platform shuddered, its stasis fracturing into a waltz of creaking wood and whirring gears. <words>225</words> The bottle’s song seeped out—a mournful aria that unraveled his pulse. <words>237</words> Memories not his own flickered: a Parisian attic, a moth-eaten gown, applause drowned by warplanes. <words>253</words>  

“You hear it too, don’t you?” The diva’s spectral form materialized, her voice trembling. <words>268</words> “Mother’s voice… I’ve bartered a thousand souls to brokers, yet none could—” <words>282</words>  

“Brokers don’t listen,” Lysander interrupted, sweat beading his brow. <words>293</words> “They sell.” <words>295</words> He rotated the bottle again, the label now spelling *Silence*. <words>305</words> The aria sharpened, its notes piercing the platform’s inertia. <words>317</words> Gears groaned into motion, lowering the island toward the recycling abyss where molten glass bubbled. <words>334</words>  

“The song ends here,” the diva whispered. <words>340</words> “Unless you reforge the bottle mid-descent.” <words>348</words>  

Lysander grimaced. <words>349</words> A soul-broker’s job was to charm, not to gamble his platform on a diva’s nostalgia. <words>364</words> Yet the aria’s crescendo mirrored his own hunger—the childhood lullabies *he’d* lost when the chasms claimed his parents’ souls. <words>384</words> He gripped the bottle. <words>387</words> “Persuasion requires leverage, madame. <words>393</words> Your song… for mine.” <words>397</words>  

She hesitated, then nodded. <words>401</words>  

As the platform plunged, Lysander hurled the bottle into the furnace. <words>413</words> Molten glass erupted, spinning into a new vessel as the aria fused with his own whispered melody—a boy’s hymn to a broken home. <words>435</words> The reforged bottle levitated, its label now legible: *Duet*. <words>445</words>  

The diva signed her deed with a tear. <words>452</words> Lysander pocketed his commission—a sliver of her soul’s song—and steadied the platform, its gears humming in tune. <words>470</words> Around him, other bottles chimed, eager to trade their music for passage. <words>483</words> He smiled, refilling his saucer. <words>488</words> Some brokers sold houses; he sold second chances, one dusty note at a time. <words>503</words>
