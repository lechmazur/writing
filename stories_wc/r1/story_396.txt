Léa’s fingers brushed the damp limestone of the champagne vault’s walls, her flashlight revealing a glint of cobalt and gold wedged between cobblestones—a fragment of stained glass, its edges softened by centuries. <words>34</words>  
As an urban forager, she’d combed Paris’s underbelly for discarded beauty, but this shard hummed with a story older than the Veuve Clicquot bottles stacked nearby. <words>68</words>  
“*Mon dieu*,” she whispered, pocketing it, her charm compensating for the fact she’d forgotten her map—again. <words>88</words>  
The next morning, at a science fair in La Villette, Léa collided with Dr. Élodie Moreau, a materials scientist clutching a spectrometer. <words>111</words>  
“Your bag—it’s emitting traces of medieval silica,” Élodie said, eyes narrowing. <words>125</words>  
Léa shrugged, her disinterest feigned; the fragment’s allure had already seeped into her bones. <words>140</words>  
Élodie offered a deal: analyze the glass to trace its origin, in exchange for a sample. <words>154</words>  
“Negotiate? *D’accord*,” Léa agreed, though her mind drifted to the vault’s cool shadows, where she’d hidden the fragment beneath a crate of ’45 Dom Pérignon. <words>180</words>  
By dusk, Élodie’s lab confirmed the glass matched Sainte-Chapelle’s 13th-century windows—shattered during the Revolution. <words>197</words>  
“It belongs in a museum,” Élodie insisted, while Léa’s thoughts tangled with the perfumer who’d once told her such artifacts were “*Paris’s breath*.” <words>222</words>  
That night, beneath the vault’s vaulted ceilings, a string quartet began their final performance for patrons sipping vintage bubbly. <words>241</words>  
Léa stood at the cellar’s heart, the fragment glowing under UV light Élodie had rigged, its ruby hues staining the crowd’s astonished faces. <words>263</words>  
Madame Clément, the perfumer, materialized beside her, murmuring, “You’ve stirred a hornet’s nest, *chérie*. The city wants it sealed in glass. The historians want it buried.” <words>290</words>  
Léa’s forgetfulness resurfaced—she’d promised Élodie a sample, Madame a secret—but the music crescendoed, buying her time. <words>308</words>  
“Why not let it stay?” she said, her passion veiled by nonchalance. “It’s survived revolutions. Let it outlive us.” <words>326</words>  
Madame chuckled. “You think like a thief.” <words>333</words>  
“No. Like a root,” Léa countered. “Finding cracks to bloom.” <words>343</words>  
Élodie stormed in, spectrometer in hand, demanding the fragment. <words>351</words>  
Patrons turned, their champagne flutes paused mid-sip. <words>358</words>  
Léa, ever charming, raised the shard, its colors fracturing the vault’s gloom. <words>372</words>  
“You want a relic?” she called. “Here’s your saint’s finger. Your chemical puzzle. But down here, it’s just… *alive*.” <words>390</words>  
The quartet’s violinist faltered, then improvised a melody sharp as broken glass. <words>402</words>  
Élodie hesitated; Madame sighed. <words>406</words>  
In that breath, Léa slipped the fragment into a champagne bottle’s velvet lining, its fate hidden like a vine in concrete. <words>426</words>  
As the applause faded, she winked at the vault’s shadows, shielding her fragile wonder—one forgotten treasure honoring another. <words>447</words>
