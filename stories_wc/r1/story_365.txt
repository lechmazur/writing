The deflated oracle crouched beside the abandoned carnival ring toss game, her fingers tracing the chipped paint of a wooden peg as the scent of rusted prizes whispered through the air. <words>30</words>  
In her other hand, she clutched an empty perfume bottle, its glass still faintly radiating the lavender-and-ash fragrance of forgotten prophecies. <words>54</words>  
The dreamlike invitations had begun as flickers in her tea leaves—visions of a ceremonial rope coiled beneath the carnival’s rotting stage, its braids knotted with centuries of choices she’d failed to alter. <words>87</words>  
*Independently dependent*, the paradox taunted her: she could only rewrite history by surrendering to the rope’s ancient logic, its threads both her shackles and her keys. <words>114</words>  
Moonlight pooled in the ring toss hoops as she pried up a floorboard, revealing the rope—thick as a serpent, its braids shimmering with trapped time. <words>137</words>  
“Enact the unraveling,” the perfume bottle seemed to hiss, its voice the echo of her younger self, still believing in second chances. <words>159</words>  
Her breath hitched as she began reconfiguring the braids, each plait a decision point: the day the fire swallowed the temple, the moment she’d called rain and summoned locusts instead. <words>187</words>  
The rope pulsed, and suddenly she was *inside* the braids, standing at the carnival’s grand opening, sawdust swirling with the laughter of children who’d grow into ghosts. <words>214</words>  
A ring toss booth attendant waved, his face blurring between stranger and father, and she understood—this was the subconscious realm’s cruel joke, stitching her regrets into its tapestry. <words>243</words>  
She hurled the perfume bottle at him; it shattered, releasing not scent but sound—a symphony of doorbells, each chime an invitation to revise. <words>265</words>  
The rope tightened around her wrist as she stepped into 1913, the year her warning could’ve stopped the cannonfire. <words>283</words>  
But the braids resisted, yanking her into 1987 instead, where a girl with her mother’s eyes reached for a stuffed bear at the ring toss. <words>305</words>  
“Don’t!” the oracle screamed, but the child missed the peg, her disappointment curdling into the ambition that would later detonate cities. <words>327</words>  
Melancholic glee swelled as the oracle seized the rope’s split ends, weaving them into a new pattern—one where the girl won the bear, where the attendant kept his name, where prophecies died sweetly unspoken. <words>357</words>  
Dawn bled through the carnival tents as she staggered back to the present, the rope now a single braid, smooth and irreparable. <words>378</words>  
The ring toss pegs had vanished; in their place stood a marble monument to ordinary moments—birthdays unruined, silences unbroken. <words>398</words>  
The oracle laughed, tasting salt and static, as her body began dissolving into the perfume bottle’s last exhale. <words>416</words>  
History had rewritten her too, stitching closure into every frayed edge, leaving only the carnival’s ghostly carousel music twisting through the wind—a lullaby for choices no longer hers to carry. <words>447</words>
