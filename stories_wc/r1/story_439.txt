The mute courier pressed her frostbitten palms against the splintered doors of the opera house, its once-gilded columns now skeletal under the storm’s wrath. <words>27</words>  
Snowflakes spiraled through the shattered dome above, settling on the guidebook in her coat—a leather-bound relic titled *Pocket Guide to Interdimensional Travel*, its pages whispering of doors unseen. <words>54</words>  
She’d stolen it three nights prior from a drowned sailor’s satchel, lured by sketches of comets arcing over impossible cities. <words>73</words>  
Now, amid the creaking balconies, she traced the glyphs described on page 47: *“To generate passage, align desire with celestial witness.”* <words>95</words>  
A shiver—not from cold—crawled up her spine as a blue light pulsed beyond the broken windows. <words>111</words>  
The comet. <words>112</words>  
It had stalked her since the harbor, its tail smearing the sky like ink dropped in water. <words>128</words>  
*Guidance or omen?* she wondered, hands trembling as she arranged rusted stage props into the diagram from the guide. <words>145</words>  
A moth-eaten curtain, a cracked mirror, a conductor’s baton. <words>154</words>  
The air thickened, humming as the comet’s glow pooled in the mirror, refracting into a lattice of light that hovered above the orchestra pit. <words>175</words>  
Her breath hitched—this was unassumingly bold, a thief’s gamble with rules she barely grasped. <words>190</words>  
But the mind’s escape required more than caution; it demanded the quiet audacity to step into the unknown. <words>207</words>  
She climbed onto the pit’s edge, the guidebook’s warnings blurring with her pulse. <words>220</words>  
*“Thresholds demand payment: a memory, sharp as starlight.”* <words>228</words>  
The courier closed her eyes, offering the night she’d first understood silence—her mother’s lips moving soundlessly as waves swallowed their fishing boat. <words>250</words>  
The lattice brightened, threads weaving into a doorway. <words>258</words>  
Beyond it, a corridor stretched, walls pulsing with hieroglyphs that shifted as she approached. <words>272</words>  
Her boots clicked against stone older than the harbor, than language itself. <words>283</words>  
Here, the snow still fell, but each flake glimmered with miniature galaxies, melting into her skin like answers. <words>299</words>  
The comet’s voice—if comets had voices—thrummed in her bones: *“Seek not doors, but the cracks between.”* <words>316</words>  
She halted before a mural depicting a figure with her face, hands outstretched to cradle a collapsing star. <words>332</words>  
Hidden meanings coiled in the pigments; lifetimes spent folding reality like origami. <words>344</words>  
The courier unbuttoned her coat, letting the guidebook fall open to a page she’d dog-eared—a map of thresholds, now glowing. <words>362</words>  
Her fingers brushed the mural, and the opera house dissolved. <words>372</words>  
Suddenly, she stood in a field of silver grass, the comet lodged in the earth ahead, its light birthing a thousand sapphire butterflies. <words>392</words>  
They swirled around her, each wingtip etching symbols into the air—a lexicon of elsewhere. <words>406</words>  
She smiled, a soundless laugh, as the snow and the storm and the weight of unsaid words unraveled into pure, luminous motion. <words>426</words>  
The guidebook had been right: some doors opened only once, and only for those willing to forget the difference between daring and desperation. <words>447</words>  
Clutching a butterfly—its wings now a parchment of stars—she stepped into the light, no longer a courier, but a question shaped like a woman. <words>470</words>  
Behind her, the opera house sighed, its ruins cradling the echo of a choice that had always belonged to the snow. <words>490</words>
