The ambitious herbalist pressed the plain wooden clothespin between her teeth, its unvarnished edges biting into her gums as she scrambled through the storm’s wrath. <words>28</words> Rain lashed the mountainside, erasing the path to her greenhouse—the one place where her experiments in regeneration might finally silence the drumming chant of *not enough* that haunted her sleepless nights. <words>60</words> A lightning strike split the sky, illuminating the steel door of a secret government bunker half-buried in the mud. <words>81</words> She hesitated, then wrenched it open. <words>86</words>  

Inside, the air hummed with the sterile chill of machines, their screens flickering code she couldn’t decipher. <words>105</words> But the walls—oh, the walls—were lined with glass tanks holding specimens that made her breath catch: orchids that pulsed like hearts, moss regenerating faster than fire could consume it. <words>134</words> Here was life unshackled, defiantly simple in its perfection. <words>145</words> Her clove-stained fingers trembled. <words>149</words>  

A sudden alarm blared. <words>152</words> Soldiers’ boots echoed in the corridor as she ducked behind a workstation, clutching the clothespin like a talisman. <words>170</words> It had been her mother’s, carved from a branch that survived a blight—a reminder that resilience required no ornament. <words>192</words> Now, as voices barked orders about “containment protocols,” she understood: this bunker wasn’t a refuge. <words>212</words> It was a cage for miracles. <words>217</words>  

Her gaze fell on a shattered tank, its soil spilling onto the floor. <words>231</words> Within it lay a single withered root, its edges curling like a fist. <words>244</words> Without thinking, she plunged the clothespin into the dirt, propping the root upright. <words>259</words> The wood absorbed the moisture, swelling until—with a sound like a sigh—the root unfurled, veins glowing gold. <words>281</words> It *regenerated*, tendrils knitting air into chlorophyll faster than her eyes could follow. <words>297</words>  

“Halt!” A soldier’s rifle clicked behind her. <words>305</words> She spun, clutching the resurrected plant, its light reflecting in the soldier’s wide eyes. <words>322</words> For a heartbeat, the drumming in her skull ceased. <words>331</words> Here, in this sterile tomb, she’d broken the oldest rule: that life must be earned through struggle, not reborn through grace. <words>355</words>  

The storm raged louder, rattling the bunker’s foundations. <words>364</words> With a roar of shearing metal, the roof tore open, rain drenching the machines into silence. <words>381</words> The herbalist laughed, raw and bright, as vines erupted from her hands, weaving a ladder to the sky. <words>400</words> She climbed, the clothespin still clamped in her teeth, its simplicity anchoring her ascent. <words>417</words> Below, the soldiers shouted. <words>421</words> Above, the clouds parted—not for sunlight, but for the silhouette of wings unfurling in the storm’s eye. <words>442</words>  

Before the first dream could take flight, she let go. <words>451</words> Not of the clothespin, but of the lie that enough was something to be proven. <words>468</words> The wind caught her, and in that hushed turbulence between falling and soaring, she understood: limits were just stories waiting to be rewritten. <words>496</words>
