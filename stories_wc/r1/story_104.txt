The stoic steward adjusted her wearable bird skull cameo, its hollow eyes catching the last amber light filtering through the miniature world museum’s stained-glass dome. <words>25</words>  
Outside, the orchard gate creaked shut on harvest day, sealing the scent of overripe apples into the dusk. <words>43</words>  
She traced a finger along the cameo’s cracked beak—honestly rare, the auctioneer had lied, unaware its fractures hummed with voices from the exhibits’ shrinking civilizations. <words>70</words>  
“Cracks in the façade,” she muttered, venerate the phrase as she did each twilight, a mantra against the lullaby of conformity crooned by the world beyond the gate. <words>99</words>  
Her boots echoed through halls where dioramas of pocket-sized empires quivered under dust: a glass-blown city besieged by termites, a quilted tundra fraying at its seams. <words>126</words>  
They called her a curator, but she was a smuggler. <words>134</words>  
Tonight, she pried the cameo apart, extracting a microfilm ledger of artifacts the museum had “retired”—those too truthful, too strange. <words>158</words>  
The encrypted shipping labels arrived monthly via carrier pigeons bred with compasses in their marrow, addresses decipherable only through the cameo’s prism. <words>184</words>  
Rebellion, she’d learned, required bureaucracy. <words>189</words>  
As she stamped the latest crate—a music box that played extinct pollinators’ hymns—a cough fractured the silence. <words>212</words>  
The night janitor leaned on his mop, his smile a scalpel. <words>224</words>  
“Still playing savior?” he asked, nodding at the crate. <words>233</words>  
“Conformity’s comfortable,” she said, sealing the lid, “but have you ever tasted comfort that didn’t rot your teeth?” <words>255</words>  
He laughed, cynical warmth pooling between them like spilled cider. <words>268</words>  
They’d been allies once, before he traded protest pamphlets for pension plans. <words>283</words>  
At dawn, the crate would vanish into a freight network hidden behind produce shipments, its journey a suture stitching dissent across continents. <words>310</words>  
The steward lingered at the “Forgotten Monarchs” exhibit, brushing pollen off a moth-eaten tapestry of a king whose name dissolved when spoken aloud. <words>340</words>  
Her cameo pulsed—a new message. <words>345</words>  
Decoded, it read: “The orchard gate won’t hold. They’re digitizing the archives. Burn what you can.” <words>365</words>  
She smiled, sharp as the cameo’s talons. <words>373</words>  
Let them scan the dioramas; they’d never capture the termites’ hunger, the quilted snow’s whisper. <words>391</words>  
In the conservation lab, she ignited a pile of donor manifests, their flames licking the air green. <words>411</words>  
The janitor found her there, ash clinging to her like misguided confetti. <words>426</words>  
“You’ll die with this place,” he said, more envious than mournful. <words>440</words>  
“Better than dying before it,” she replied, and pressed the cameo into his palm, its fractures glowing with the museum’s dying breath. <words>466</words>  
When the gate’s new owners arrived, they found only a bird skull in the ashes, its hollow eyes still watching. <words>489</words>
