The soundless sanctuary thrived in its contradictions—marble floors cracked like spiderwebs, stained glass depicting saints with hollow eyes, and a silence so absolute it hummed. <words>34</words>  
As the dutiful ward, Irina’s duty was to guard this paradox during the auditions, where hopefuls knelt to whisper hymns into the void, their voices swallowed by the walls. <words>68</words>  
She wore the worn leather glove always, its frayed fingertips a relic from the sanctuary’s last keeper, who’d vanished mid-prayer. <words>92</words>  
Today, though, the glove itched—a prickle that began when she found the first phone tucked between pews, its screen blinking with a voice note titled *Solve Me*. <words>124</words>  
The voice was garbled, metallic, reciting coordinates: *47°12' N, 8°32' E*. <words>137</words>  
Irina recognized the numbers—the sanctuary’s own latitude, longitude. <words>146</words>  
“Reframing the familiar,” she muttered, her tone eagerly jaded, as if the mystery were a joke she’d heard before. <words>166</words>  
Another phone surfaced at noon, hidden beneath a hymnbook. <words>176</words>  
This voice note hissed, *Beneath the third saint’s tears, the key turns*. <words>187</words>  
The third saint’s mosaic wept shards of cobalt, and there, in the plaster, Irina found a rusted switch. <words>204</words>  
It opened a compartment housing a photograph: the sanctuary’s founder, laughing atop a gallows. <words>219</words>  
Auditions dragged on, sopranos trembling as their songs dissolved into the silence. <words>231</words>  
Irina pocketed a third phone from a tenor’s coat—*stolen*, she reasoned, like the others. <words>245</words>  
This voice note crackled, *Mortality’s punchline awaits*. <words>254</words>  
She traced the founder’s grin in the photo, realizing the sanctuary wasn’t built to mute sound, but to amplify what lingered after—the echo of defiance. <words>281</words>  
The final phone lay in the confessional, its note a whisper: *Wear the glove. Touch the western wall*. <words>297</words>  
The glove’s leather fused with the stones, revealing a hidden door. <words>308</words>  
Inside, a chamber pulsed with recordings—centuries of stolen voices, laughter, screams, all preserved in vacuum-sealed tapes. <words>328</words>  
The founder’s journal lay open: *We are not silenced; we choose when to roar*. <words>342</words>  
Irina understood now. <words>345</words>  
The auditions weren’t tests of piety, but of rebellion—seeking someone brave enough to shatter the silence with a final, fearless laugh at mortality. <words>370</words>  
She returned to the nave, where the last auditionee stood, a girl with fire-scarred hands. <words>385</words>  
“Sing,” Irina said, slipping her the photograph. <words>392</words>  
The girl’s voice erupted, not a hymn but a roar, shaking dust from the saints’ eyes. <words>409</words>  
Irina laughed, sharp and graceless, as the sanctuary’s walls trembled, the stored tapes erupting in a cacophony of lives refusing to be muted. <words>435</words>  
In that dissonance, she found beauty—not in harmony, but in the cracks where light, and sound, clawed free. <words>454</words>  
The glove fell ash from her hand, its purpose fulfilled, as the sanctuary’s true hymn swelled: a chorus of the departed, laughing. <words>477</words>
