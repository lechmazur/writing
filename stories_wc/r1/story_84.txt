The city of Chelonira drifted atop shells of gargantuan turtles, their barnacled spines cresting waves as sidewalk sales erupted in a mosaic of haggling voices and clinking wares. <words>27</words> Lysander Voss, an actor whose every gesture dripped with melodrama, clutched a cracked leather case to his chest—its surface etched with glyphs that hummed when the turtles sang. <words>56</words> “This relic,” he declared to no one, “contains the last performed kindness in a realm where compassion is… *oddly seldom*!” <words>77</words> The case held a shard of the Empyrean Lens, a artifact that amplified genuine altruism—until he’d faked its magic for applause, provoking the wrath of its creator: the omnipotent Curator. <words>107</words>  

Today, the Curator’s agents would repossess it. <words>113</words> Lysander’s only defense? Solving matching riddles hidden in snippets of old commercials blaring from vendors’ radios. <words>130</words> “A game for fools,” he muttered, though sweat beaded beneath his cravat. <words>143</words> A vendor’s jingle crackled: *“Seven keys, but none unlock—what bends time without a clock?”* <words>159</words> Lysander froze. <words>161</words> The answer—*a turtle’s path*—echoed in his mind as the air shimmered, and a spectral auctioneer materialized, ledger in hand. <words>181</words> “Correct,” it intoned. <words>183</words> “But two remain.” <words>186</words>  

The second riddle blared from a noodle cart’s speaker: *“I mirror your tears yet never weep. I crown the lost, their secrets keep.”* <words>210</words> Lysander’s mind raced. <words>212</words> The Lens pulsed—its true power required *authentic* kindness, not theatrics. <words>224</words> He spotted a child sobbing over a dropped toy, and on impulse, knelt to mend it with a ribbon from his sleeve. <words>245</words> “The answer,” he whispered, “is *memory*.” <words>254</words> The auctioneer scowled. <words>256</words> “One left.” <words>258</words>  

The final riddle erupted from a jewelry stall: *“I begin in a grave, end in a spark—devour the dark to leave your mark.”* <words>281</words> Lysander’s fingers tightened on the case. <words>288</words> The answer—*a story*—flashed through him, but the Curator’s laughter boomed. <words>301</words> “Ah, but *whose* story?” <words>307</words> The turtles lurched, stalls swaying as Lysander realized: the Curator wanted him to surrender the Lens, to admit his fraud. <words>331</words> Instead, he smashed the shard, releasing its stored kindnesses—a luminous wave that dissolved the auctioneer and silenced the riddles. <words>354</words>  

Panting amid the settling chaos, Lysander found the child offering him the repaired toy—a tiny turtle. <words>372</words> Frenzied tranquility settled as the sales continued, oblivious. <words>380</words> The case, now empty, felt lighter. <words>386</words> “Performance,” he mused, “can become truth… if one dares the encore.” <words>400</words> Above, the turtles sang again, their shells carving new paths through the stars. <words>417</words>
