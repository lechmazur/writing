The underground poet volunteered at the witch’s familiar menagerie on Tuesdays, threading between cages of chittering shadow-weasels and a two-headed owl that recited sonnets in reverse. <words>34</words> Her fingers moved with disinterested passion, crocheting a blanket whose asymmetrical patterns mirrored the static uniqueness of her unpublished verses—each stitch a rebellion against symmetry. <words>71</words> Tonight, between loops of indigo yarn, she found an antique map tucked beneath a drowsy salamander’s tail, its edges frayed and marked by a jagged tear. <words>105</words> The tear split the words “brimming cup” in half, as though fate itself had hesitated to name what lay there. <words>130</words>  

She seized the map, her pulse quickening. <words>137</words> For years, she’d sought a metaphor potent enough to surprise fate—to force an unplanned encore from a universe that preferred tidy endings. <words>165</words> The menagerie’s familiars rustled, their eyes reflecting the dim glow of bottled lightning as she traced the map’s coordinates to a village drowned centuries ago. <words>196</words> The witch, knitting spider-silk gloves nearby, remarked without looking up: “Some cups overflow not with liquid, but with time.” <words>223</words>  

The poet smuggled the map into her basement studio, where candlelight revealed hidden ink swirling beneath the tear. <words>245</words> By dawn, she’d deciphered a riddle: *“Mend the rift with thread of shift, drink the moon from the brimming crypt.”* <words>269</words> Her crochet needle hovered. <words>272</words> The blanket in her lap—half-finished, imperfect—suddenly felt like an omen. <words>288</words>  

She returned to the menagerie at twilight, volunteering to groom a granite-skinned griffin. <words>305</words> As the creature purred, she snipped a single wire-like feather and wove it into the map’s tear. <words>327</words> The parchment shuddered, its edges blooming into a landscape of submerged spires and a chalice floating above the ruins, overflowing with liquid moonlight. <words>357</words> The poet laughed, a sound as rare as the map itself. <words>370</words> Here was her encore: not a poem, but an act. <words>383</words>  

The witch found her at the lake’s shore at midnight, the blanket now a net of yarn and feathers. <words>404</words> “You’ll drown,” the witch said, though her tone suggested approval. <words>417</words> The poet shook her head. <words>420</words> “Drowning’s just another kind of embrace.” <words>427</words> She waded in, the brimming cup’s light dissolving her outline until only verses remained, echoing across the water—a static-unique sonnet, seizing the dark into something brighter. <words>458</words> The two-headed owl hooted the refrain, and the menagerie, for once, fell silent. <words>476</words>  

By morning, the blanket lay completed on the shore, its final stitch clasping a silver droplet. <words>497</words> The witch pocketed it, smiling. <words>503</words> Some surprises, she thought, were worth the unraveling. <words>513</words>
