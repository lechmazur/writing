<story>The town-weary traveler stood before the abandoned carnival’s house of mirrors, her boots sinking into sand that whispered of salt and forgotten laughter.<words>34</words>She’d followed the coastal wind here, its fingers tugging at her coat like a child insistent on sharing secrets.<words>59</words>The structure loomed, its fractured panes reflecting the dusk in jagged smears—except one: a stained glass panel intact, depicting a phoenix mid-immolation, labeled *The Cradle of Sparks*.<words>94</words>Its colors bled into the gloom, and she felt the name resonate, a struck bell in her ribs.<words>114</words>  

“Escape requires fertilizer,” the fortune-teller had muttered that morning, pressing a rusted key into her palm.<words>138</words>Now she understood.<words>141</words>Her mind had become a maze of recursive fears, and mirrors were the worst kind of confessor.<words>160</words>She stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of mildew and anticipation.<words>178</words>  

A metal sign hung askew outside, its chains clinking a morse code against the wind.<words>198</words>*Tap-tap-tap.*<words>201</words>Intentional accident, she realized—rhythm as ritual.<words>212</words>She replicated the pattern against the glass phoenix, and the panel slid open, revealing a cavity pulsing with bioluminescent moss.<words>240</words>“Fertilize,” she breathed, sprinkling the key’s rust into the glow.<words>255</words>The moss erupted into flames that didn’t burn, each ember a tiny wingbeat.<words>272</words>  

The mirrors rippled.<words>275</words>Her reflections fractured into versions of herself she’d buried: the girl who’d fled weddings, the woman who’d maps instead of memories.<words>303</words>They pressed against the glass, mouths open in silent pleas.<words>319</words>The cradle’s sparks swarmed, stitching their silhouettes into a single thread of light.<words>338</words>  

Outside, the sign’s tapping crescendoed.<words>345</words>Wind threaded through the house, carrying a voice—*her* voice, from a lifetime ago, whispering, *“I…”*<words>367</words>The hush between syllables thickened, a synapse about to fire.<words>382</words>She gripped the panel’s edge, the glass now warm as skin.<words>397</words>  

Her fractured selves dissolved into the sparks, their weight lifting.<words>411</words>For the first time in years, her mind held silence, vast and coastal.<words>429</words>The final ember settled into her palm, and she knew what she’d say when the hush broke.<words>451</words>Not *I love you*, but *I’m ready*.<words>461</words>  

The house groaned, its mirrors clouding over like eyes in sleep.<words>475</words>She walked into the wind, the sign’s tapping fading behind her, a lullaby for the unbound.<words>497</words></story>
