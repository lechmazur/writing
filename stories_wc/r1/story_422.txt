The selectively mute ventriloquist traced circles in the bioluminescent sand of the parallel universe beach, her dummy, Jasper, perched on a driftwood log beside her. <words>28</words> She’d come here nightly after the last call at the diner on the corner, where the fry cook always slid her a cardboard coffee sleeve scribbled with the day’s weather anomalies—her makeshift archive. <words>58</words> Tonight’s sleeve read *“hail the size of teacups”* in smudged Sharpie, and she tucked it into her coat pocket like a love letter. <words>82</words>  

Jasper’s wooden jaw clacked as she puppeteered his reply to the seagulls’ screeches: *“Optimism’s just rage wearing a party hat!”* <words>103</words> Her own voice had dissolved years ago, swallowed by a throat that only sang through carved pine. <words>119</words> Still, she archived—weather patterns, diner gossip, the way parallel tides licked three moons instead of one—because data didn’t require speech. <words>141</words>  

A payphone rang downshore, shrill as a tea kettle. <words>147</words> She hesitated, then pressed the receiver to Jasper’s ear. <words>155</words> A man’s voice spilled out: *“Ma, the divorce papers came. Tell Dad I’m keeping the dog.”* <words>170</words> The ventriloquist froze. <words>173</words> This wasn’t her world’s timeline; calls here often crossed dimensional seams. <words>186</words> Another ring, another answer: *“They found your sister’s time capsule. All it had was a mixtape and a parking ticket.”* <words>207</words>  

Jasper’s head swiveled toward her, painted eyebrows arched. <words>214</words> *“Family’s just entropy with better lighting,”* he quipped, but his voice cracked—her hands were shaking. <words>230</words> She’d spent years believing blood meant permanence, until hers stopped answering calls. <words>244</words> Now strangers’ fractured conversations piled up in her chest, louder than the surf. <words>258</words>  

The fry cook appeared suddenly, his apron smeared with parallel universe grease. <words>269</words> *“Patronize me all you want,”* he said, tossing her a new coffee sleeve, *“but you’re avoiding the riptide.”* <words>286</words> Jasper snorted: *“Says the man who thinks ketchup is a spice!”* <words>296</words> Yet when the cook left, she unfolded the sleeve. <words>305</words> His handwriting slanted: *“Family’s what stays when the weather breaks.”* <words>318</words>  

Bioluminescence flared as she stood, clutching both sleeves like tarot cards. <words>329</words> The payphone rang again—*“I’m scared to be someone’s dad”—*and she answered through Jasper, lips still. <words>347</words> *“So be someone’s lighthouse,”* he rasped. <words>354</words> Static hummed. <words>356</words> Then laughter, wet and hopeful, from a universe not their own. <words>367</words>  

By dawn, the ventriloquist had pinned every coffee sleeve to the diner’s corkboard, a quilt of hailstorms and heatwaves. <words>384</words> The fry cook brought her burnt toast shaped like a thumbs-up. <words>395</words> Jasper heckled the seagulls. <words>399</words> And when the payphone rang, she answered—not to archive, but to listen, to laugh, to let the waves rewrite what “home” meant. <words>421</words>  

Her voice remained gone, but the dummy’s grew softer, funnier, kinder. <words>432</words> After all, euphoric agitation was just another weather pattern—and here, on this shimmering shore, they were all meteorologists. <words>450</words>
