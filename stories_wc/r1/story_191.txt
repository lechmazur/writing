The island emerged from the mist like a half-remembered secret, its shores littered with driftwood shaped like skeletal fingers. <words>30</words>  
Here, the sober cardsharp—known only as Vale—paused, his calloused hands brushing the antique inkwell tucked beneath his coat. <words>50</words>  
It hummed faintly, a relic that whispered of drowned poets and contracts signed in starlight, but its true purpose demanded a price even he hesitated to pay. <words>75</words>  
He’d come to this forsaken spit of land not for treasure, but to dare the unimaginable: to resurrect the dead by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers’ dreams. <words>100</words>  
The method was madness, but grief had long since sanded his pragmatism to a blade’s edge. <words>118</words>  

The air hung boisterously quiet, a paradox of cicada screams muffled by fog, as Vale traced symbols in the damp soil with a silver coin. <words>146</words>  
His sister’s ghost flickered in his periphery, her voice a threadbare echo of hushed pleas—*Don’t, you fool*—but he drowned her in the clatter of his tools. <words>175</words>  
Time here bent like wet paper; the ritual could only begin at the moment coffee cooled in an abandoned mug left rotting in the island’s derelict lighthouse. <words>205</words>  
He’d calculated the window: thirteen seconds of lukewarm limbo between steam and stagnation. <words>223</words>  

Vale hastened up the lighthouse’s spiral stairs, the inkwell’s weight a guilty pendulum against his ribs. <words>245</words>  
Inside the tower, the mug sat on a splintered desk, its rim cracked, the dregs inside still whispering heat into the gloom. <words>270</words>  
He uncorked the inkwell, its contents shimmering like liquid onyx, and dipped a quill forged from his sister’s hair. <words>293</words>  
Dreams were maps, and the dead left trails in the subconscious of those they’d loved—or ruined. <words>315</words>  
He’d spent years collating fragments: a baker’s nightmare of her laughing in a storm, a sailor’s vision of her drowning in honey. <words>340</words>  

The coffee’s last wisp of warmth vanished. <words>347</words>  
Vale stabbed the quill into the ink and slashed symbols across the lighthouse wall, each stroke pulling threads from the island’s collective slumber. <words>375</words>  
The air curdled. <words>377</words>  
Shadows congealed into a figure—not his sister, but the inkwell’s original owner, a specter with eyes like inkblots. <words>400</words>  
*Grudging admiration,* it hissed, *to think you’d weaponize sorrow so… elegantly.* <words>418</words>  

Vale’s hands shook. <words>420</words>  
The specter lunged, but he smashed the inkwell, its darkness erupting into a thousand starlings that shredded the ghost to smoke. <words>445</words>  
In the silence, his sister’s voice returned, clear now: *Let go.* <words>459</words>  
He sank to his knees, the lighthouse trembling as the island swallowed itself, leaving only the mug—cold, empty, and finally still. <words>485</words>
