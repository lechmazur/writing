The high altitude tea house perched on the mist-cloaked ridge like a vulture, its wooden beams creaking under the weight of intermission’s restless crowd. <words>30</words>  
Dr. Erasmus Thorn, a botanist whose reputation for madness was eclipsed only by his carnivorous orchids, adjusted his comically serious monocle and cinched his worn-out leather belt tighter, as though the fraying strap alone could bind his fraying sanity. <words>62</words>  
He had come to this aerie of steam and whispers to ionize the truth from lies—specifically, the lies embedded in the spliced frames of a 1927 film reel currently whirring in the projector room. <words>90</words>  
“The pathways are *there*,” he muttered to his pitcher plant, Virgil, whose tendrils twitched in a rhythm that might’ve been loyalty or indigestion. <words>113</words>  
The film, *The Lovers of Lhasa*, was a decoy; its hidden sections, visible only under ultraviolet light, allegedly mapped the ancient pathways to Shangri-La—a network of roots, Thorn insisted, that could digest time itself. <words>146</words>  
As the projector hummed, Thorn’s fingers danced over a modified Geiger counter, charging the air until ozone prickled tongues and teacups rattled. <words>167</words>  
A waitress gasped as the screen flickered to life, not with sepia romance, but with a pulsing mycelial web that Thorn’s device had ionized into visibility. <words>188</words>  
“Fickle loyalty,” he scoffed when Virgil snapped at her sleeve, though the real betrayal came seconds later: the filmstrip caught fire, its nitrate heart unraveling into smoke that coiled into Sanskrit letters above the crowd. <words>220</words>  
Thorn lunged to salvage the reel, his belt buckle sparking against the projector’s chassis—a miscalculation that fused metal and leather into a smoldering clasp. <words>241</words>  
The tea house trembled, not from altitude, but from the roots now splitting its floorboards, drawn to the charged particles like capillaries to light. <words>259</words>  
“Photons and phloem!” Thorn barked, tossing Virgil into the chaos as the orchids’ petals yawned wide, digesting the Sanskrit symbols into a glowing slurry. <words>279</words>  
The unexplained phenomena climaxed as the slurry pooled into a map—a labyrinth of veins leading downward, not to Shangri-La, but to a cavern where the film’s director had buried his lover’s bones in 1928. <words>308</words>  
Thorn froze. <words>309</words>  
The pathways were graves. <words>312</words>  
The projector’s final frame showed the director smiling, his hand resting on the same worn-out belt now strapped to Thorn’s waist—a family heirloom, passed down through suicides and suitors. <words>337</words>  
Virgil, ever the pragmatist, swallowed the map. <words>343</words>  
The tea house patrons applauded, mistaking the carnage for avant-garde theater. <words>353</words>  
Thorn, sweat mingling with the ionized haze, realized the true madness wasn’t in the pursuit, but in the repetition: every generation of his line lured by the belt, the film, the promise of pathways that led only to their own hunger. <words>387</words>  
He fed Virgil a scone in silent truce. <words>393</words>  
The roots retreated. <words>395</words>  
The screen went black. <words>398</words>  
And as the crowd resumed sipping bergamot, Thorn vowed to burn the belt—right after he replicated the experiment. <words>416</words>  
Fickle loyalty, indeed. <words>419</words>
