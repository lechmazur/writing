Amid the fluorescent hum of the grocery store’s produce aisle, Lionel Vane—a cunning connoisseur of botanical antiquities—paused before a pyramid of rutabagas, struck by a sudden urge to abandon his cart. <words>30</words>  
The smoke signal tower on Hillcrest Ridge, long dismissed as a tourist relic, flickered in his mind like a xerographed memory, its jagged silhouette demanding attention. <words>60</words>  
He ditched his kale and quinoa, fingers brushing the vintage seed packets always tucked in his coat—a habit from years hunting rare flora for morally ambiguous clients. <words>90</words>  
The tower’s stone stairs groaned underfoot as he climbed, each step echoing his motive: to corner the elusive destiny that had dodged him since he’d forged provenance papers for a billionaire’s extinct orchid. <words>130</words>  
At the summit, wind whipped ash from a dormant hearth, scattering it over the seed packets’ faded labels—**“Nightblooming Truths, 1892.”** <words>158</words>  
Decoding the forgotten had always been Lionel’s vice, but these weren’t ordinary seeds; their glyphs matched a cipher he’d once seen in a smuggled Mayan codex. <words>190</words>  
He laid the packets flat, using his phone’s camera to xerograph their patterns onto the tower’s soot-stained wall, revealing a map of constellations tied to soil pH levels. <words>227</words>  
A laugh escaped him—gentle, chaotic—as he grasped the game. <words>240</words>  
The seeds were keys, engineered to bloom only under specific stars, and the tower wasn’t a relic but a greenhouse chimney repurposed by 19th-century bio-alchemists. <words>274</words>  
His hands trembled. Planting them here, now, could rewrite botanical history—or curse it. <words>295</words>  
Morality had always been a negotiable tax, but the glyphs warned of consequences: *“Roots drink the planter’s truth.”* <words>319</words>  
Below, the grocery store parking lot shimmered, mundane and safe. <words>330</words>  
Lionel tore open the first packet. <words>335</words>  
Soil, ash, and stolen starlight mingled as he buried the seeds, each placement a calculated rebellion against the destiny he’d been sold—a middleman in others’ legacies. <words>370</words>  
Dawn bled into the sky when the sprouts emerged, iridescent and whispering. <words>385</words>  
They coiled around his wrists, not with threat, but kinship. <words>397</words>  
The plants hungered for his cunning, his compromises, his buried guilt over the orchids that had poisoned a rainforest. <words>421</words>  
By noon, the tower was a cathedral of venomous blossoms and truth-serum nectar, their scent bending the town into confessions. <words>447</words>  
Lionel inhaled, grinning as the chaos bloomed gentle. <words>456</words>  
Destiny, he realized, wasn’t a corner to trap, but a seed to graft. <words>473</words>  
He descended, pockets heavy with new packets, ready to xerograph the world in their image. <words>493</words>
