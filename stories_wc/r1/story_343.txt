The melancholy jester hunched over a brass console in the steampunk submarine’s dim belly, his motley sleeves brushing against gauges hissing with amber steam. <words>34</words>  
Before him lay a crumpled drawing—a child’s sketch of a laughing king, now creased by decades of regret. <words>55</words>  
“Analyze the tea leaves,” he commanded, his voice echoing through pipes coiled like metallic intestines. <words>76</words>  
The submarine’s engineer, a woman with goggles strapped to her grease-streaked brow, scoffed. <words>93</words>  
“Sacred practices won’t fix leaky rivets,” she said, gesturing to walls still glistening with fresh paint. <words>112</words>  
But the jester traced the geometry of leaves swirling in his chipped cup, seeking patterns older than empires. <words>131</words>  
“The paint’s drying. Time’s bleeding,” the engineer muttered, though her hands hesitated on the boiler valves. <words>151</words>  
His finger paused on a triangular cluster—iconically unintentional, yet precise as a clockwork heart. <words>168</words>  
“Here,” he whispered, overlaying the sketch onto the leaves’ map. <words>179</words>  
The king’s grin aligned with the leaves’ angles, revealing coordinates buried in forgotten ritual. <words>196</words>  
“You’re mad,” the engineer said, but her tools began calibrating, gears whirring in reluctant harmony. <words>215</words>  
The submarine groaned, diving deeper into abyssal trenches where steam mingled with salt. <words>230</words>  
“Why?” she asked, watching him smooth the drawing, his bells jingling like drowned whispers. <words>247</words>  
“They erased our festivals,” he said. <words>253</words>  
“Laughed as they melted our temple bells into cannon fodder.” <words>264</words>  
The engineer adjusted a pressure dial, her defiance softening. <words>275</words>  
“My daughter drew that,” she admitted, nodding at the sketch. <words>287</words>  
“Before the airships came.” <words>292</words>  
Silence pooled between them, thicker than the ocean pressing inward. <words>305</words>  
The jester rotated the cup, light refracting through tea-stained glass. <words>317</words>  
“They’ll mock us again,” he said. <words>324</words>  
“Unless we anchor their future in our past.” <words>333</words>  
A sonar ping echoed. <words>336</words>  
The submarine shuddered, its hull scraping against a colossal structure below. <words>349</words>  
Through a porthole, corroded spires emerged—a sunken cathedral, its bells intact. <words>365</words>  
“Common ground,” the engineer breathed, her calloused hands steadying the helm. <words>379</words>  
The jester’s laugh was a fractured melody. <words>386</words>  
“Even fools find doors,” he said, “if they dance while knocking.” <words>399</words>  
Together, they charted a path through Leviathan bones, the submarine’s paint crackling into permanence. <words>417</words>  
Above, the world hurried; below, crooked hope took root. <words>428</words>
