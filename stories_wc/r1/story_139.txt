In the heartbeat after a dream returns, Brother Kaelin awoke clutching a creased shipping label, its edges frayed and ink smudged into cryptic runes. <words>27</words> The aerial gondola swayed beneath him, suspended by rusted chains over a chasm where mountain winds hissed like vengeful spirits. <words>52</words> He had boarded this rickety vessel to avenge his brother’s death, though the label’s destination—a monastery carved into the northern peaks—now felt less like a clue and more like a taunt from his own dark reflection. <words>89</words>  

The monk unfolded the label again, its creases forming a map only his stubbornness could decode. <words>105</words> Years ago, his twin had vanished while pursuing an antique flute rumored to harvest the past through its owner’s breath. <words>128</words> Kaelin had dismissed it as myth until finding the flute in his brother’s empty cell, its bone surface marred by tooth marks—a visually unappealing ledger of desperation. <words>158</words> Each groove, he realized, held a note; each note, a memory stolen. <words>171</words>  

As the gondola lurched, Kaelin traced the flute’s indentations, humming a melody that sharpened the air like frost. <words>191</words> The dream surged back: his brother’s face, gaunt and mirrored, playing a dirge that dissolved the walls between centuries. <words>212</words> “You’ll drown in what you seek,” the vision had warned, but Kaelin’s fingers tightened around the instrument. <words>231</words> To outsmart his shadow, he needed to master time’s theft before time mastered him. <words>247</words>  

A shriek pierced the cabin—a hinge failing. <words>254</words> Through cracked glass, Kaelin spotted the monastery’s spires, their stones stained by lichen and old blood. <words>270</words> He pocketed the label, its final glyphs aligning with the flute’s engravings: a name, *Ephraim*, his brother’s killer and his own second self. <words>293</words> The truth coiled cold in his gut. <words>300</words>  

Inside the monastery’s vault, Ephraim waited, gaunt and grinning, a living echo. <words>314</words> “You’ve come to finish our duet,” he rasped, raising an identical flute. <words>327</words> Kaelin’s melody erupted first, notes clawing at Ephraim’s stolen memories—a cacophony of wars, loves, and betrayals harvested from the dead. <words>352</words> The room shuddered; murals of saints bled pigment like tears. <words>366</words>  

But Ephraim countered, his song a serpentine twist that siphoned Kaelin’s resolve. <words>382</words> The monk faltered, his breath fraying, until the shipping label slipped from his robe. <words>397</words> Its creases glowed faintly—a stave only visible through the lens of cautious enchantment. <words>415</words> Kaelin aligned the flute to the pattern, and the tooth marks sang anew, unraveling Ephraim’s stolen years. <words>435</words>  

His twin screamed as the past reclaimed him, dissolving into notes that settled like ash. <words>452</words> Kaelin collapsed, the label crumbling in his grip, its purpose spent. <words>465</words> Yet the flute remained, its scars deepened by his own teeth—a new ledger, a new burden. <words>483</words> As dawn gilded the mountains, he played a single trembling note, harvesting not the past, but the silence after. <words>504</words>
