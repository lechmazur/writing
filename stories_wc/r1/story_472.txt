<story>  
The renegade matchmaker traced the colorless plastic button’s edges, her fingers memorizing its complicatedly simple geometry as the floating library’s zeppelin shuddered between channels. <words>30</words>  
Outside, static hissed like whispered laments, and the ship’s tattered flag rippled in the wind, its frayed edges casting morse-code shadows across her desk. <words>61</words>  
“Untold stories,” she muttered, thumbing the button—a relic from a dead astronaut’s uniform, its purpose as elusive as the interstellar secret encoded in the library’s forbidden archives. <words>92</words>  
Her matches had always been transactional: pairing starved scholars with forgotten texts, rebels with incendiary manuscripts, lovers with sonnets that scalded as they healed. <words>122</words>  
But this? <words>123</words>  
This was a fracture in the universe—a message from something older than ink, sharper than gentleness. <words>141</words>  
The button’s hollow center glowed faintly when the flag’s shadow flickered at a precise angle, revealing coordinates etched in light. <words>161</words>  
“Between channels,” she realized, lungs tight. <words>167</words>  
The zeppelin wasn’t just drifting; it was *listening* to the void’s white noise, sifting static for celestial patterns. <words>186</words>  
Her late partner’s voice haunted her: *“Some truths aren’t meant to be matched, only mourned.”* <words>200</words>  
But grief had made her fluent in silence. <words>206</words>  
She calibrated the archives’ astrolabe, feeding it the coordinates as the flag’s ripples intensified, each undulation a syllable in a cosmic dialect. <words>229</words>  
The walls dissolved into starfields, and the button vibrated—a key harmonizing with the library’s hidden frequency. <words>247</words>  
Data cascaded: blueprints of alien libraries, equations for folding time into paper, and a pulse—steady, alive—echoing from the Andromeda’s heart. <words>270</words>  
The matchmaker laughed bitterly. <words>274</words>  
They’d weaponized curiosity, her kind. <words>278</words>  
Librarians weren’t keepers; they were midwives to revolutions. <words>287</words>  
But this secret? <words>289</words>  
It was a bridge. <words>291</words>  
Or a bomb. <words>293</words>  
Her hands trembled as she slotted the button into the astrolabe’s core, completing a circuit older than Earth. <words>311</words>  
Light blazed. <words>313</words>  
The zeppelin lurched, shelves upending, manuscripts snowing downward as the flag tore free, its fabric unraveling into binary strands that dissolved into the atmosphere. <words>338</words>  
And then—silence. <words>340</words>  
The button cooled, inert once more, but the matchmaker’s mind reeled. <words>353</words>  
The coordinates pointed not to a place, but a *presence*: an archive drifting between galaxies, its keepers waiting to exchange truths humanity had scorched from its own history. <words>380</words>  
A trade. <words>382</words>  
Their secrets for hers. <words>385</words>  
She closed her eyes, tasting the decision’s metallic tang. <words>395</words>  
Renegades, after all, understood the cost of stories. <words>404</words>  
As the zeppelin stabilized, she pocketed the button and lit a candle for the flag’s remnants, its sacrifice now part of the untold—a sharp gentleness carved into the dark. <words>430</words>
