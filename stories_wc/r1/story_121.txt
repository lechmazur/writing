The parole board’s gavel struck like a coffin nail, and Silas Mercer—shifty caretaker of the derelict Starlight Drive-In—knew he’d outrun his ghosts for the last time. <words>31</words> His fingers tightened around the vintage microscope in his trench coat pocket, its brass edges biting into his palm as he slipped past the courthouse shadows, chasing the faint scent of popcorn grease and diesel. <words>64</words> The circus caravans were coming. <words>68</words> They always came when the law turned its back, their painted wagons bleeding neon across the cracked asphalt of his forsaken theater. <words>91</words>  

Tonight, they’d bring the mineral. <words>97</words> The one that could crystallize regret into something solid, something he could shatter. <words>114</words> For three years, he’d tailed those surreal processions, watching acrobats dissolve into fireflies and clowns melt into greasepaint puddles at dawn’s first blush. <words>143</words> All to steal a pinch of their “stardust”—the glittering residue that let him mineralize memories, turning heartache into jagged quartz. <words>166</words> It was the only way to unify the conflicting hearts he’d fractured: his ex-wife’s, his daughter’s, his own. <words>187</words>  

The caravans materialized at midnight, their calliope music warping the air like heat haze. <words>202</words> Silas adjusted the microscope’s eyepiece, its century-old lenses revealing the truth beneath the spectacle—tent poles made of rib bones, ticket booths breathing like lungs. <words>229</words> A contortionist tossed him a vial. <words>233</words> “Last chance, jailbird,” she hissed, her spine coiled into a question mark. <words>246</words>  

He sprinted to the projection booth, where his makeshift lab hummed with stolen electricity. <words>260</words> Under the microscope, the dust writhed: a living mosaic of every “I’m sorry” he’d choked back during his trial. <words>280</words> His hands trembled as he injected it into the theater’s antiquated film reel, the way he’d done every full moon since his parole began. <words>307</words> The screen flickered to life, projecting memories he’d petrified—his daughter’s ninth birthday party fossilized into opal, his wedding vows compressed to diamond shards. <words>337</words>  

But tonight, the images bled. <words>341</words> The minerals were cracking. <words>344</words> Through the viewfinder, he saw why: the circus dust had mutated, infected by his desperation. <words>363</words> The reel spun faster, spewing geysers of amethyst and iron pyrite that shattered the screen, the debris slicing his cheeks. <words>385</words> Outside, the caravans dimmed, their performers waving farewell with hands turned to smoke. <words>402</words>  

Silas collapsed as dawn broke, clutching a new crystal—this one pulsing with anguished joy, its facets refracting a truth he’d refused to face. <words>428</words> The right to fail meant the freedom to let go. <words>437</words> Let the quartz memories dissolve. <words>441</words> Let the hearts he’d tried to control beat out of sync. <words>452</words> In the theater’s rubble, he laughed, salt tears mineralizing mid-fall. <words>466</words> They made perfect imperfect diamonds. <words>471</words>
