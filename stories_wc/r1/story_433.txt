The hardheaded traveler pressed her palm against the frost-etched door of the ephemeral art gallery, its transient walls humming with paintings that bled color like weeping watercolor. <words>28</words> Snow days had hollowed the city into silence, but here, amid ice-glazed sculptures and canvases that dissolved by the hour, she sought solace in nature’s embrace—or what remained of it. <words>57</words> Her boots left ash-gray prints on the alabaster floor, a trail for the ghosts of choices she’d buried. <words>77</words>  

In the gallery’s farthest corner, a library yawned, its shelves warped by time and neglect. <words>94</words> Between treatises on forgotten storms, she found it: a leather-bound tome masquerading as a secret book safe, its spine cracked like a liar’s smile. <words>118</words> Inside, scraps of prophecy clung to parchment, their ink swirling like smoke. <words>131</words> *“Power is a language only the broken speak wholeheartedly,”* one fragment warned, its letters bruising her fingertips. <words>151</words>  

She laughed, a sound as demure as the gallery’s audacious art—quiet, yet sharp enough to cut glass. <words>169</words> Years ago, she’d fled a throne carved from her family’s bones; now, the prophecy promised dominion over storms, if she’d let the tempest unravel her veins. <words>195</words> But power had a price, and hers was already paid in scars. <words>209</words>  

Struggle coiled in her ribs as she traced the words, each syllable a key to chains she’d sworn never to wear again. <words>231</words> The gallery’s lights dimmed, paintings dissolving into spectral mist, as if the room itself mourned her hesitation. <words>250</words> Snow hissed against the windows, whispering of forests where she’d once slept beneath cedars, unafraid of the dark. <words>270</words>  

A sculpture of ice shattered nearby, revealing a final scrap: *“To wield the storm, you must become the fracture.”* <words>290</words> Her breath stalled. <words>293</words> She’d been wholeheartedly broken since the coup—since her hands learned the weight of a dagger and the emptiness of a crown. <words>314</words> But here, in this fleeting sanctuary, the prophecy asked her to break anew, to let the cracks devour her. <words>337</words>  

Outside, the blizzard swelled, howling like the wolves she’d befriended in exile. <words>352</words> The traveler closed the book, its secrets heavy as a corpse. <words>364</words> Power was a language, yes—but she’d rather speak in snowfall and pine resin, in the quiet grammar of roots. <words>385</words> Let the storms rage unclaimed. <words>392</words>  

She stepped into the white void, the gallery collapsing behind her like a sigh. <words>408</words> Solace, she realized, wasn’t in conquering nature’s chaos, but in walking alongside it, a pilgrim in a world that demanded no throne. <words>433</words> The snow kissed her cheeks, and for the first time in years, her fractures felt like art. <words>453</words>
