The antique brass key glinted in the skeletal remains of the abandoned carnival roller coaster track, its teeth catching the sun’s dying light like a dare. <words>25</words>  
Lena, a secret astral projector whose body lay hidden three miles west, hovered above the rusted rails, her spectral fingers brushing the key’s cold metal—*there*, the revelation struck: this wasn’t just a relic. <words>57</words>  
It was a cipher, etched with coordinates to a bunker storing survival manuals from the Collapse, knowledge someone was killing to erase. <words>78</words>  
Her breath hitched—corporeal, distant—as footsteps crunched gravel below. <words>87</words>  
They’d found her. <words>89</words>  
Again. <words>90</words>  
Unyielding compassion had made her reckless; she’d lingered too long healing a scavenger’s fractured leg two nights prior, leaving traces of her presence. <words>109</words>  
Now, she had to flee. <words>113</words>  
But fleeing, for Lena, was never just running—it was *alignment*. <words>121</words>  
She snapped back into her body, lungs burning as she bolted through the carnival’s skeletal archway, the key clenched in her fist. <words>138</words>  
Sun shadows stretched like sundial needles across the derelict midway, and she tracked their jagged angles, a language she’d learned when the world still turned politely. <words>160</words>  
Left at the tilted Ferris wheel, right where the shadow of the ticket booth split the path—*sometimes always*, her mentor’s mantra hissed in her mind, a paradox that meant adapt, but hold fast. <words>186</words>  
Gunshots spiderwebbed the air. <words>189</words>  
She dove behind a concession stand, heart hammering as she fumbled with the key’s engravings. <words>202</words>  
The numbers swam: 43° latitude, 89° longitude—somewhere in the drowned Midwest. <words>213</words>  
Useless, unless she could reach the astral relay towers. <words>221</words>  
But the hunters closed in, their shouts fraying the twilight. <words>229</words>  
Compassion had cost her time, yet it also gifted her allies: the scavenger she’d mended lurked ahead, waving her toward a gap in the fence. <words>251</words>  
She sprinted, the key’s edges biting her palm, and flung herself through the opening as bullets kissed the chain links. <words>267</words>  
“Go north,” the scavenger rasped, pressing a water flask into her hands. <words>277</words>  
“The towers—they’re rigged to collapse at midnight.” <words>284</words>  
Lena nodded, her practiced spontaneity a mask for the dread coiling in her gut. <words>296</words>  
Astral projection required stillness, safety, but survival demanded motion. <words>306</words>  
She ran until the carnival shrank into a tumor of shadows behind her, then collapsed against a birch tree, the key now warm against her chest. <words>327</words>  
Moonrise silvered the forest. <words>330</words>  
She closed her eyes, let her spirit unravel upward—a kite severed from its string—and skimmed the treetops until the relay towers pierced the horizon, their skeletal frames humming with residual energy. <words>357</words>  
Coordinates transmitted, she snapped back, muscles screaming as she staggered north. <words>368</words>  
The bunker’s location would reach the resistance by dawn; the manuals would outlive her, if necessary. <words>382</words>  
Footsteps echoed again, closer. <words>386</words>  
Lena smiled, sharp and weary. <words>390</words>  
Let them come. <words>392</words>  
She’d already etched the maps onto her ribs, inked in unyielding compassion, a tattoo only death could erase. <words>406</words>  
The hunters’ flashlights bobbed like fireflies as she melted into the pines, her path a secret written in sun shadows and sometimes always. <words>428</words>  
Survival, she thought, wasn’t a skill—it was a story, and hers had just begun. <words>441</words>
