The lunar greenhouse clung to the crater’s edge like a glass scarab, its domed panes fracturing sunlight into spectral dust. <words>27</words>  
Inside, Kael’s shoulders hunched beneath his armored vest, his fingers brushing the faded photograph in his pocket—a girl’s smudged smile, her name eroded by time. <words>49</words>  
Director Voris’s voice crackled through his earpiece: “Secure Sector C before the delegation arrives.” <words>63</words>  
Kael’s jaw tightened; Voris had controlled the colony’s oxygen supply for decades, his “park visits” a euphemism for crushing dissent beneath botanical pageantry. <words>85</words>  
But today, amid the ferns and whispered tours, Kael would ratify his rebellion. <words>97</words>  

He’d spent months collecting fragments of overheard stories—engineers grumbling about air quotas, gardeners mourning purged crops—each shard a stitch in the shroud for Voris’s reign. <words>125</words>  
The photograph’s edges dug into his palm, a silent vow to the sister Voris had “relocated” years ago. <words>141</words>  
Rebirth required timing, not haste. <words>145</words>  

A delegation member paused by the algae tanks, murmuring about terraforming delays. <words>157</words>  
Kael feigned disinterest, memorizing their insignia: EarthGov, Voris’s prospective buyers. <words>170</words>  
His pulse thrummed—serendipity had made him stubborn, and stubbornness had made him listen. <words>183</words>  

“Director!” A botanist waved Voris toward a blighted orchid, her voice trembling. <words>195</words>  
Kael seized the moment, slipping a data chip into the EarthGov envoy’s pocket—proof of Voris’s sabotage, his hoarding, his lies. <words>216</words>  
The envoy’s eyes narrowed, then flickered with recognition. <words>224</words>  

Voris returned, his smile a scalpel. <words>228</words>  
“Kael, escort our guests to the arboretum.” <words>235</words>  
“No.” The word hung, sharp and seismic. <words>242</words>  

The greenhouse held its breath. <words>245</words>  
Kael unclipped his badge, tossing it at Voris’s boots. <words>254</words>  
“The colony’s charter grants shared stewardship if two-thirds ratify. They have.” <words>268</words>  
He gestured to the envoy, now broadcasting his evidence colony-wide. <words>279</words>  

Voris lunged, but Kael sidestepped, serene as the Earth-rise, anger coiled in his stillness. <words>295</words>  
The orchid’s petals rained down as security hesitated—loyalty fractured like overripe fruit. <words>309</words>  

When the airlocks sealed Voris inside his own vault, Kael stood at the crater’s rim, the photograph finally still in his palm. <words>333</words>  
New saplings breached the soil below, their roots knitting through lunar regolith. <words>346</words>  
The envoy approached, offering a seedling. <words>352</words>  
“A timely rebirth,” they said. <words>356</words>  

Kael smiled, the first in years. <words>361</words>  
Control had been a greenhouse too—suffocating, transparent, brittle. <words>372</words>  
Now, he’d plant his own stories. <words>378</words>  

As EarthGov’s ships retreated, the colonists gathered, their voices weaving through the dome like ivy. <words>395</words>  
Kael pressed the photograph to the glass, her smile refracted among a thousand stars. <words>409</words>  
In the soil beneath his boots, something stubborn took root. <words>419</words>
