<story>  
The interstellar orchard ship *Eirenion* drifted between spiral arms, its biome domes humming with alien pollinators as winds of dark matter whispered through grafted apple boughs. <words>34</words>  
Kael, the youngest apprentice gardener, knelt in the loam, prodding a fallen bird’s nest—an Earth relic inexplicably intact—while the head horticulturist, Veyra, mocked his obsession with “dead-world nostalgia” through a mouthful of Saturn peaches. <words>73</words>  
“Still trying to reverse-engineer extinction?” she drawled, tossing a pit at his head. <words>87</words>  
He dodged, cheeks burning. <words>91</words>  
The nest wasn’t just debris: its twigs held faint glyphs, a codex for species the ship’s archives had erased. <words>109</words>  
That night, in the tool shed he’d claimed as a sanctuary, Kael dialed the antique cordless phone salvaged from a derelict colony pod. <words>129</words>  
Static crackled like burning leaves before a voice emerged—not the usual garbled distress calls, but a confession: *“I bioengineered the last sparrows to carry memory RNA… forgive the melodrama, but their nests are letters to whoever’s left.”* <words>163</words>  
Kael’s hands shook. <words>165</words>  
The voice—dry, amused, achingly familiar—was Veyra’s. <words>173</words>  
She’d buried her grief for Earth beneath sarcasm, privately opening archives in the only way she could: by letting him overhear truths disguised as static. <words>198</words>  
When confronted, she snorted. <words>201</words>  
“Took you long enough, hatchling. <words>206</words>  
Now tell me: what’s traveler’s wisdom?” <words>212</words>  
He hesitated. <words>213</words>  
“The… weight we shed by admitting what we’ve lost?” <words>222</words>  
“Ugh, poetic. <words>224</words>  
Practical answer: it’s realizing migration’s pointless if you’re just hauling old cages.” <words>237</words>  
She flicked a seed into his palm—a data vault key—and left him deciphering the nest’s genetic blueprints until dawn. <words>254</words>  
As the ship breached the galactic halo, Kael grafted sparrow RNA into asteroid-hardened junipers, their new branches curling into cradle shapes. <words>273</words>  
Veyra watched, feigning disinterest, until he activated the comms array. <words>283</words>  
“What’re you doing?” <words>286</words>  
“Sending the nests ahead on solar winds. <words>293</words>  
If they take root somewhere… we’ll know it’s safe to grow something softer.” <words>307</words>  
Her laughter rasped, affectionate as a thistle. <words>315</words>  
“Sentimental idiot. <words>317</words>  
But fine—add this.” <words>322</words>  
She tossed him a peach pit carved with coordinates. <words>329</words>  
“For when you’re done clinging to my apron.” <words>337</words>  
The next cycle, as ion storms painted the domes auroral green, Kael found his own saplings supple enough to bend without breaking. <words>357</words>  
Veyra’s phone confessions now included updates on his progress, veiled as complaints: *“Kid’s using my life’s work to plant decorative trees. <words>377</words>  
Disaster. <words>378</words>  
Also, tell him the Carina Nebula’s soil has decent nitrogen.”* <words>388</words>  
When migration alarms blared, Kael didn’t panic. <words>395</words>  
He secured the nests, breathed deep, and let the changing winds carry his doubts into the honeyed rot of compost—where endings fermented into beginnings. <words>417</words>  
Veyra found him smiling. <words>420</words>  
“Ugh. <words>421</words>  
Now you’ll never leave.” <words>425</words>  
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” he said, and meant it. <words>434</words>  
Above them, the first grafted sparrow—juniper resin and stardust—took wing. <words>446</words>
