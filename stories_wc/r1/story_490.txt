The caravan repair station stood skeletal under a salt-crusted sky, its rusted ribs creaking as the fading caretaker shuffled between gutted engines, her fingers brushing a dried lavender bundle tucked into her apron pocket like a forgotten promise. <words>42</words> She’d found it years ago, pressed between the pages of a waterlogged manual, its scent long dead but its presence a ritual—something to clutch when the silence of the deserted shore gnawed too loud. <words>85</words> Today, though, the silence had ruptured: the waves had receded at dawn, unveiling a fissure in the dunes, and inside it, glinting like a serpent’s eye, was the terminal she’d sought for decades. <words>132</words>  

“Methodically random,” she muttered, hacking the ancient archives with a codebreaker’s arrhythmia—staccato keystrokes interspersed with pauses to sip bitter tea, her hands trembling not from age but anticipation. <words>173</words> The terminal’s screen flickered, disgorging data streams about the Caravansary’s founders, their forbidden pact with entities that thrived in tidal voids, their hunger to gorge on starlight distilled into liquid time. <words>216</words> Her laugh rasped like wind through wire mesh; *enthusiastic apathy* had always been her armor, but now her pulse quickened. <words>238</words>  

The lavender crumbled in her grip as the archives surrendered their final secret: coordinates to a vault where the founders had cradled their stolen cosmos, a newborn galaxy swaddled in quantum static. <words>276</words> Forbidden, yes—but hadn’t she spent her life repairing what others abandoned? <words>293</words> She limped past the caravans, their hulls streaked with kelp and desperation, and knelt where the fissure split the earth. <words>317</words>  

Cold light seeped upward. <words>320</words> The vault’s maw yawned, and inside, suspended in a prism of fractured physics, was the galaxy—a spiraling ache of blue and gold, whispering in a language that dissolved her bones to stardust. <words>358</words> She reached, not to steal but to cradle, her hands curving around its light as if it were a child she’d orphaned lifetimes ago. <words>385</words>  

The terminal’s alarm blared. <words>387</words> The founders’ guardians, all brine and bile, surged from the shore’s receding scars, their forms dissolving and reforming like cursed tides. <words>413</words> The caretaker smiled, her body fraying at the edges, and pressed the lavender to the galaxy’s core. <words>434</words> Let them come. <words>436</words> She’d already woven the codes into the dunes, methodically random, a labyrinth of light and longing. <words>456</words> The guardians collapsed into static, their howls swallowed by the vault’s hum, while the galaxy sighed against her chest—a secret no longer forbidden, but *kept*. <words>486</words>  

By sundown, the waves returned, erasing the fissure. <words>495</words> The caretaker faded with them, her apron empty save for lavender dust and the weight of something infinitely small, infinitely alive. <words>518</words>
