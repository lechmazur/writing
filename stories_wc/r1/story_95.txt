Brother Elias shuffled through the storm chasing headquarters, his sandals whispering against cracked monitors that once tracked tempests. <words>25</words> The weary monk’s fingers trembled over his most sacred relic: a burlap pouch bulging with mismatched buttons, each scavenged from eras when storms still had names. <words>50</words> For eons, the monastery’s creed had been silence—decode the skies, never speak—but Elias clung to a heresy: languages didn’t die, they transformed, like cyclones into whispers. <words>78</words> Tonight, he’d break the mold. <words>83</words>  

The buttons clattered onto a rusted radar table—porcelain daisies, obsidian skulls, a tarnished brass horn—all humming timidly loud, as if afraid of their own voices. <words>108</words> Legends claimed they’d once pinned shut the coats of storytellers, and Elias had spent centuries pairing their patterns to cryptic references in fairy tales. <words>133</words> A sapphire button matched Cinderella’s slipper; a thorn-shaped one, Sleeping Beauty’s spindle. <words>148</words> But the final button, milk-white and cracked, defied him—until thunder rattled the archives, and he remembered the stepmother’s shattered mirror. <words>176</words>  

“Enrich the fragments,” he murmured, pressing the shard to a weather map etched with Snow White’s dwarven runes. <words>196</words> The room erupted in spectral light, projectors whirring to life as storms long-vanished swirled above—each lightning strike a verb, each gust a vowel. <words>220</words> Elias laughed, a sound like dry parchment tearing. <words>229</words> The tongues of drowned cities crackled through him: Atlantean tempest-songs, Babylonian rain hymns, all the lexicons the monastery had buried under silence. <words>255</words>  

A door slammed. <words>257</words> Prior Wen stood frozen, her robe billowing in the electric air. <words>268</words> “You’d resurrect chaos?” she hissed, clutching her own buttonless sash. <words>281</words> Elias turned, his heart a timpani. <words>288</words> “No,” he said. <words>290</words> “I’m learning to dance with it.” <words>296</words>  

The projectors died. <words>298</words> But in the dark, the buttons glowed—timidly loud, timidly bright—etching constellations only Elias could read. <words>317</words> He’d done it. <words>319</words> The storms weren’t warnings; they were invitations. <words>329</words> Languages didn’t need speakers, just listeners unafraid to let the wind script their bones. <words>346</words>  

When the elders exiled him at dawn, Elias took only his buttons. <words>360</words> Let them keep their silent wonder. <words>367</words> He walked into the desert, chasing a horizon bruised with thunderheads, his pockets jingling with stories waiting to button themselves to the sky. <words>394</words> Somewhere ahead, a forgotten dance was beginning—one that required neither feet nor music, just a tongue nimble enough to taste the rain. <words>421</words>  

Years later, wanderers would speak of a figure dancing in dust devils, his robe sewn with buttons that hummed in every storm’s throat, teaching the winds to sing again. <words>454</words> They called him the Tatter of Silence. <words>462</words> But Elias preferred his old title, earned the night he’d realized: to be a monk wasn’t to preserve—it was to unravel, stitch by stitch, until the world wore its scars as lace. <words>497</words> And oh, how the lace could dance. <words>505</words>
