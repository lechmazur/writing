The floating marketplace hung suspended in the dawn haze, its wooden stalls and silk awnings lashed to a dozen hot air balloons that sighed like restless giants.<words>39</words>  
Lira, an alchemist whose hands trembled even when weighing moonthorn, knelt beside a marble slab etched with scuffs that weren’t scratches but a language—one she’d spent three sleepless nights decoding.<words>81</words>  
The verdict on her petition to enter the Emerald Canopy’s forbidden trails would be announced at noon, and if the judge ruled against her, the forest’s shifting paths would remain unmapped, its secrets—including the source of the cracked dragon scale in her satchel—lost forever.<words>132</words>  
The scale, iridescent but fractured, hummed against her hip, a relic from a beast that had supposedly traded immortality for mortality, though the tales disagreed on whether it was a sacrifice or a punishment.<words>173</words>  
“Technically wild,” the market’s apothecary had warned her, refusing to touch it, and Lira understood now: the artifact pulsed with a rhythm that mirrored her own heartbeat, as if it might rewrite her veins if she held it too long.<words>221</words>  
She traced the marble’s coded marks, her chalk translating symbols into a coordinate—a latitude that matched the Canopy’s northern edge.<words>246</words>  
To safeguard the scale, she needed to return it to where its kind had fallen, but the Canopy’s trails dissolved like sugar in rain, and only the judge could grant access to the cartographers’ guild’s anchored compasses.<words>288</words>  
A balloon above her hissed, lowering a basket of clattering spice jars, and Lira froze as the judge’s clerk strode into the pavilion, his slate tablet chiming—the verdict was ready.<words>324</words>  
The crowd stilled, but Lira’s mind raced: the marble’s code also hinted at a price.<words>343</words>  
Immortality, the dragon’s gift, required anchoring one’s soul to something mortal—a tree, a name, a heartbeat—and severing it meant crumbling to ash.<words>368</words>  
The scale’s fracture, she realized, wasn’t a flaw but a choice; the beast had split its own anchor to escape an eternity it no longer wanted.<words>393</words>  
“Lira of the Saffron Vial,” the judge intoned, unrolling a parchment, and she clutched the scale, its edges biting her palm.<words>415</words>  
If the verdict denied her, she’d release it into the market’s chaos, letting it become someone else’s burden—but the clerk’s gaze flickered to her chalked coordinates, and he gave the faintest nod.<words>456</words>  
“Permission granted,” the judge declared, and as the crowd buzzed with mundane miracles—a child’s balloon bursting into song, a teacup refilling with starlight—Lira exhaled, understanding the true cost of the trails she’d map.<words>500</words>
