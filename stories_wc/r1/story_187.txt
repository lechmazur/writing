<story>The stoic wanderer stepped onto the witch’s familiar training ground, her boots crushing brittle leaves that whispered of forgotten incantations. <words>25</words> Above, the sky hung mesmerizingly bland—a gray void neither threatening nor comforting, leaching urgency from the air like a spell. <words>49</words> She clutched the splintered floorboard from the abandoned cabin, its grooves etched with symbols that pulsed faintly, a necessary lie disguised as driftwood. <words>78</words> It had led her here, following a trail of nightmares: children’s voices sobbing in fog, horses with hollow eyes galloping backward, her own hands aging decades in seconds. <words>108</words> Now, at the clearing’s heart, a hooded figure swept a bony hand across a slate, erasing the final formula in a cloud of chalk-dust. <words>135</words>  

“Stop,” the wanderer demanded, her voice roughened by decades of silence, yet edged with brash tenderness—a blade sheathed in wool. <words>162</words> The teacher turned, revealing a face as nondescript as the sky, features blurring like wet ink. <words>181</words> “You’re too late,” they said, though the words seemed to come from the ground itself. <words>197</words> “Rituals must die when their keepers do.” <words>206</words>  

She thrust the floorboard forward, its carvings flaring crimson. <words>216</words> “You’ll archive this one.” <words>221</words> The demand was an imposition, a violation of the coven’s oldest law, but the wanderer’s resolve hardened like cooled iron. <words>245</words> Her motivation coiled deeper than duty: she’d watched her village starve after another witch’s lies curdled their crops, seen rituals perverted into weapons. <words>275</words> This formula—a cure for possession—couldn’t vanish into the teacher’s apathy. <words>291</words>  

The teacher laughed, a sound like pages tearing. <words>299</words> “You carry a plank from a ruin and think it a key?” <words>312</words>  

“It’s a ledger,” she said, splinters biting her palm. <words>323</words> “The cabin’s owner wrote truths between the cracks. <words>333</words> How to bend a curse into a compass. <words>341</words> How to mourn without drowning.” <words>347</words> Her thumb brushed a hidden groove, releasing a sliver of wood that clattered to the ground—a map fragment, glowing faintly blue. <words>373</words> “You’ll piece the rest together.” <words>380</words>  

For a heartbeat, the teacher’s void-like face flickered, revealing a weary woman with ash-streaked hair. <words>400</words> Then the blandness returned, heavier now, a shield against hope. <words>413</words> “Why impose this burden?” <words>418</words>  

“Because necessary lies rot if unused,” the wanderer said, softer. <words>430</words> She knelt, pressing the floorboard into the soil, and recited the cabin dweller’s last rhyme—a lullaby for lost things. <words>452</words> The ground shuddered; symbols bloomed across the slate like frost, reconstructing the erased formula in jagged silver lines. <words>475</words>  

The teacher inhaled sharply. <words>479</words> “You’ll regret preserving this truth.” <words>486</words>  

“Regret’s lighter than oblivion,” the wanderer replied, standing. <words>497</words> She left the floorboard rooted in the earth, its lies already sprouting into something perilously alive. <words>518</words></story>
