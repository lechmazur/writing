<story>  
The frost giant’s lair hummed with glacial silence, its walls carved from ice that refracted moonlight into spectral blues—a sanctuary for Alaric, the realm’s most focused collector. <words>30</words>  
His latest prize, a black rose pinned in a leather-bound journal, glistened under the frost’s sheen, its petals preserved by magic older than the mountains. <words>56</words>  
Solitude was his creed, his armor against a world that mistook obsession for madness, but tonight, a sudden invitation lay crumpled at his feet: *“Come play. The stakes: your despair.”* <words>88</words>  
The board materialized first—a hexagonal slate etched with runes, its pieces miniature frost giants and wolves. <words>107</words>  
Alaric scoffed, flipping the rose’s journal open to a page titled *Seldom Odd Remedies*, but the game began without him. <words>125</words>  
A die rolled, its clatter echoing like cracking ice, and the alpha predator emerged: Despair, a shadow with teeth, coiled around the board’s center. <words>148</words>  
“Your move,” hissed a voice from nowhere, earnest yet flippant, as though death were a joke everyone but Alaric understood. <words>169</words>  
He advanced a frost giant, triggering a trapdoor that swallowed the piece whole. <words>181</words>  
Despair’s laugh rumbled. <words>184</words>  
“Predictable.” <words>185</words>  
Alaric tore the black rose from its page, pricking his thumb—a drop of blood bloomed into a crimson wolf, snarling at the board’s edge. <words>204</words>  
“Unconventional,” the voice conceded. <words>208</words>  
Round after round, the lair’s cold bit deeper, but Alaric’s mind unraveled the game’s logic: each move mirrored a memory, each loss a fragment of loneliness he’d buried. <words>235</words>  
Despair grew corporeal, its form a writhing mass of frost and shadows, fed by Alaric’s wavering focus. <words>251</words>  
“Why cling to solitude?” it taunted, advancing a clawed piece that shattered three of Alaric’s wolves. <words>268</words>  
“Because it’s mine,” he muttered, placing the rose at the board’s heart. <words>280</words>  
The journal’s pages fluttered, revealing sketches of every relic he’d ever collected—each a shield against the void. <words>297</words>  
Despair faltered. <words>298</words>  
In the final round, Alaric sacrificed his last piece, the crimson wolf, to corner the predator. <words>314</words>  
“Checkmate.” <words>315</words>  
The lair shuddered; ice melted into rivulets that spelled *triumph* across the floor. <words>328</words>  
Despair dissolved, its snarl fading to a whisper: “You’ll tire of winning alone.” <words>343</words>  
Alaric retrieved the rose, its thorns sharper now, and smiled. <words>353</words>  
The invitation ignited in his palm, ash scattering like flawed confetti. <words>365</words>  
He’d play again, perhaps—when solitude felt less like a choice and more like a habit. <words>381</words>  
But for now, the journal closed, the lair’s silence returned, and the moonlit ice glowed brighter, as if applauding. <words>401</words>  
In the end, the collector had collected himself, and that was enough. <words>414</words>  
For tonight. <words>416</words>
