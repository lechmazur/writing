<story>  
The whispering advisor traced the faint indentations on the centuries-old coin, her gloves humming with static as time rippled around her. <words>25</words>  
Here, in the time-dilated zone where hours bled into decades, the orchard fence surrendered to rust, its iron veins crumbling like dried ink. <words>44</words>  
"Patterns," she murmured, though her voice dissolved into the air—a habit from lifetimes spent unheard. <words>62</words>  
The coin’s markings mirrored the driftwood cradled in her lap, its grooves oddly comforting, as if the sea itself had carved a map to forgiveness. <words>85</words>  
Empathy rose in her throat, sour and sweet. <words>92</words>  
She hadn’t asked to outlive the stars, to watch civilizations fracture while she counted their heartbeats. <words>106</words>  
But the wood’s whispers anchored her: *Honor the fracture, the girl who drowned holding this.* <words>122</words>  

A chrono-storm brewed on the horizon, its amber light warping the apple trees into skeletal hands. <words>140</words>  
The advisor clenched the driftwood, its resonance syncing with the coin’s hidden frequency. <words>154</words>  
Decades ago—or tomorrow—a child had pressed the metal into clay, etching a plea for mercy into its face. <words>173</words>  
Now, the symbols aligned: a equation of grief, a key to bending time’s spine. <words>187</words>  
"To understand time," she realized, "you must first hold its weeping." <words>198</words>  

Her chambers flickered with holograms of the drowned girl—Lira, twelve years old, her laugh preserved in data fragments. <words>221</words>  
The fence’s rust crept closer, devouring the ground where Lira had buried her brother’s pendant. <words>237</words>  
*Why show me this?* the advisor had once raged at the void. <words>247</words>  
Now, she knew: nostalgia was the future’s compass. <words>256</words>  
She pressed the coin into the driftwood’s split heart. <words>264</words>  

Reality shivered. <words>265</words>  
Lira materialized, translucent and trembling, saltwater glinting in her hair. <words>277</words>  
"Tell me how to save them," the girl begged, her voice a relic woven through centuries of static. <words>295</words>  
The advisor’s gloves dimmed as she grasped Lira’s ghostly hand. <words>307</words>  
"Your brother’s death wasn’t your fault," she said, each word cracking time’s shell. <words>322</words>  
The admission cost her—a searing pain where her ribs once were—but the fence halted its decay. <words>340</words>  

Empathy, she understood now, was temporal gravity. <words>347</words>  
It pulled futures into pasts, mending what logic couldn’t reach. <words>359</words>  
As Lira dissolved into starlight, the advisor placed the driftwood atop the eroded fencepost. <words>376</words>  
"Your honor isn’t in fixing time," she whispered to the silence, "but in bearing witness." <words>393</words>  
The coin warmed in her palm, its indentations glowing—a chronometric pulse synced to her breath. <words>410</words>  

When the zone stabilized, the orchard stood whole again, blossoms clinging to barbed wire. <words>427</words>  
Somewhere beyond the veil, a brother and sister pressed their palms to clay, laughing. <words>443</words>  
The advisor walked away, her coat heavy with relics, still whispering. <words>455</words>
