The forgotten underwater city market thrived in silence, its coral stalls glowing with bioluminescent urgency as the shy diviner Lira traced her fingers over a stack of vintage photographs. <words>30</words> Each image depicted the same market—sometimes flooded, sometimes suspended in air—across parallel timelines, their edges frayed by the echo of regret that hummed through the brine. <words>60</words> Lira’s gift, a confusingly clear sight that fractured reality into possibilities, made her nauseous; the visions were sharp as shattered glass, yet their meanings slipped like eels. <words>90</words> She’d come to right the cosmic imbalance tearing the city apart, though her pulse screamed to flee the merchants’ hollow stares. <words>110</words>  

A vendor shoved a photograph into her hands—this one showed her own face, pale and determined, standing atop the market’s central spire as waters rose. <words>138</words> Behind her, a storm cloud swirled, its shadow spelling a username: @Echo_of_Tides. <words>152</words> Lira’s breath hitched. <words>155</words> For weeks, she’d stalked that account, its cryptic posts (“The spire falls when the heart hesitates”) mirroring her dreams. <words>176</words> Now, the trail of social media posts pulsed in her mind, threads connecting timelines where she’d failed to act. <words>196</words>  

She climbed the spire, the photographs fluttering in her satchel like captive ghosts. <words>212</words> At the summit, the air thickened—not with salt, but the static of overlapping realities. <words>229</words> @Echo_of_Tides’ final post glowed on her phone: “Regret is the weight that drowns us.” <words>246</words> Lira understood now. <words>249</words> Her reluctance to embrace her power had precipitated the city’s collapse in every timeline. <words>267</words> The cosmic scales tipped because she’d let fear silence her. <words>281</words>  

Drawing a shuddering breath, she pressed a photograph to her chest—the one where the market burned, its people dissolving into foam. <words>303</words> Her mind unraveled the threads: to fix the imbalance, she had to merge the timelines, to let every version of herself act as one. <words>329</words> The effort would hollow her, but the alternative was worse. <words>343</words>  

The spire trembled as Lira’s voice, uncharacteristically steady, spilled the incantation. <words>359</words> Currents surged, merging past and present, while spectral versions of herself materialized, each clutching their own photograph. <words>381</words> “Now,” they whispered, and the market shuddered—not into ruin, but renewal, coral blooming anew as timelines braided together. <words>406</words>  

When the waters stilled, @Echo_of_Tides posted a single image: the spire, whole, under a sunlit sea. <words>424</words> Lira, gripping her satchel of now-blank photographs, allowed herself a smile. <words>439</words> The echo of regret had quieted, its weight dissolved by choices finally made. <words>455</words> She descended into the market, no longer a spectator to fate, but a thread in its tapestry—confusingly clear, and fiercely alive. <words>480</words>
