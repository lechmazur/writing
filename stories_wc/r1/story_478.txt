<story>  
Under the waxing moon’s glow, the orchard island drifted like a forgotten secret in the heart of a swirling maelstrom, its gnarled trees heavy with fruit that glimmered like trapped starlight. <words>37</words>  
Lira, the village’s critical midwife, knelt in the soot-streaked hearth of her cottage, her calloused fingers brushing the charred edges of half-burned diaries—pages salvaged from a fire lit by hands she could no longer name. <words>71</words>  
The diaries whispered in fragments, their ink blurred by smoke and time, yet their words prickled her mind like thorns: *“Memories are roots. To sever them is to drown.”* <words>102</words>  
She pressed a sprig of dried lavender between the brittle sheets, its scent sharpening the dissonant calm that clung to her, a veneer over the storm inside. <words>125</words>  
For years, Lira had been openly secretive, delivering infants under moonlit skies while hoarding truths about her own hollow past—a past stolen when the maelstrom first devoured the island’s shores. <words>158</words>  
Tonight, though, the diaries hissed of a remedy: pressed herbs from the eldest apple tree, brewed under the moon’s zenith, could transcend the veil that shrouded her stolen years. <words>185</words>  
Lira stepped into the orchard, the maelstrom’s roar muffled by the trees’ ancient hum, their branches weaving a canopy above her like skeletal fingers. <words>207</words>  
Her boots sank into soil thick with rotted fruit, each squelch a reminder of the island’s decay—a mirror to her fractured self. <words>227</words>  
At the grove’s heart stood the tree, its bark etched with glyphs only she could decipher, its roots coiled around a hollow where she’d once buried a lock of hair, a child’s ribbon, a name. <words>257</words>  
She harvested its silvery leaves, their edges serrated like regrets, and crushed them into a mortar, mixing them with petals from flowers that bloomed only in the maelstrom’s shadow. <words>284</words>  
As the concoction simmered, the diaries’ scattered phrases coalesced: *“The midwife’s hands hold two lives—the born and the buried.”* <words>302</words>  
A memory flickered—a woman’s laughter, a swaddled infant, a knife plunged into flames—then dissolved, leaving her gasping. <words>320</words>  
The brew’s steam coiled into shapes—a shipwreck, a betrayal, a sister who’d cast Lira’s memories into the fire to silence her. <words>340</words>  
Her hands trembled. To drink would mean facing the storm’s eye; to refuse meant drifting forever. <words>357</words>  
She drank. <words>358</words>  
The maelstrom’s howl sharpened into voices—her sister’s plea, her own defiant scream as flames consumed their childhood home. <words>376</words>  
The island shuddered, roots tearing free from the abyss as Lira’s stolen self surged back: she had not just delivered life but taken it, midwifing souls *into* the maelstrom to appease its hunger. <words>406</words>  
The truth was a rot in her throat. <words>412</words>  
Yet, in the dissonant calm, she understood—the growing wisdom wasn’t in erasing the past but grafting it onto the present. <words>433</words>  
Lira returned to the hearth, diaries now ash, and placed the last pressed herb into the mortar. <words>449</words>  
This time, she brewed not for remembrance but release, her hands steady as the island’s roots anchored deep, stillness rising from the storm. <words>472</words>  
The midwife’s final secret: to transcend, one must first hold what drowns them. <words>486</words>  
Under the waning moon, the maelstrom sighed—and the orchard bloomed. <words>497</words>
