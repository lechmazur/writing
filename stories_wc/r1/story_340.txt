In the tangled canopy of the Amazon, where bridges of braided vines linked treehouse towers dripping with orchids, the proud exorcist Elara muttered curses at the universe’s latest joke. <words>34</words> Her usual path—a moss-slicked ropeway—had snapped overnight, its frayed ends coiling like dead snakes. <words>57</words> "Of course," she sneered, kicking a pebble into the abyss below, "the one day I need to outrun *his* legacy, the forest decides to youthify itself into a toddler’s obstacle course." <words>91</words> The "he" was her late mentor, whose shadow loomed as large as the kapok trees, and whose battered grimoire now weighed down her satchel like a sarcophagus of shame. <words>125</words>  

Elara’s fingers brushed the grimoire’s cracked spine, its pages whispering spells that could unstitch time—if she dared. <words>147</words> But responsibility had a way of knotting her guts tighter than the vines overhead. <words>165</words> "You’d love this, old man," she grumbled, eyeing the detour: a rickety bridge guarded by a tribe of endearingly feisty spider monkeys. <words>193</words> "Watch your star pupil trip on her own pride." <words>205</words>  

When the first monkey hurled a mango at her head, Elara retaliated with a hex that turned its fur neon pink. <words>229</words> The tribe scattered, shrieking laughter, as she crossed into the heart of the city—where the air shimmered like wet oil. <words>255</words> Here, clocks stuttered. <words>258</words> Here, seconds hiccupped. <words>262</words> The grimoire pulsed hot against her hip; the ritual site was close. <words>280</words>  

But the shadow found her first. <words>285</words> It oozed from the bark of an ancient mahogany, coalescing into a figure with her mentor’s smirk. <words>307</words> "Still using parlor tricks, girl?" it drawled, its voice syrup-thick with disappointment. <words>327</words> Elara’s jaw tightened. <words>330</words> She’d spent a decade clawing free of his ghost, only to face it now, *here*, when the clock dared to skip a beat? <words>356</words>  

The grimoire fell open to a spell she’d never risked—a temporal suture, requiring a drop of the caster’s youth. <words>379</words> "Typical," she snorted, already pricking her finger. <words>391</words> "You haunt me, I pay in collagen." <words>400</words> As her blood hit the page, the world unraveled. <words>413</words>  

Seconds snapped backward. <words>416</words> The bridge repaired itself. <words>419</words> The shadow froze mid-sneer—and Elara, now sporting a silver streak in her hair, grinned. <words>440</words> "Checkmate," she whispered, slamming the grimoire shut. <words>451</words> Let the old ghost rot in timelessness; she had a city to unhaunt. <words>468</words>  

As dawn filtered through the canopy, Elara adjusted her satchel, its weight familiar, almost comforting. <words>490</words> Responsibility, she decided, wasn’t a chain—it was a compass. <words>504</words> And hers pointed defiantly forward. <words>513</words>
