In the time before time, when the cosmos was but a murmur in the void’s throat, the Swamp Fortress of Lirien floated like a half-sunken crown, its moss-clad spires reachable only by gondolas poled through blackwater by silent, hooded ferrymen. <words>45</words> Within its damp halls dwelled Lord Veyra, an incognito aristocrat who had traded his silken robes for a weaver’s rough-spun tunic, his true name erased to chronicle the village stories that kings called lies. <words>85</words> His tool was no quill but a rustic yarn swift, its oak arms creaking as he spun tales into thread, weaving tapestries that hung like suspended dreams above the peat fires. <words>121</words>  

The swamp dwellers whispered that Veyra’s hands were strangely honest, incapable of twisting truth even to save his life—a trait that drew the Council of Realms’ wrath. <words>154</words> For the Council, who had sculpted the pre-universe from chaos, demanded obedience, not the raw, unvarnished sagas of fishermen and midwives that Veyra preserved. <words>185</words> To subjugate him, they sent decrees etched on celestial silver, but Veyra drowned each missive in the swamp, answering instead with messages coiled inside vintage wine bottles, their glass aged in forgotten cellars. <words>223</words>  

Each bottle carried a story-thread: a beggar’s kindness, a soldier’s regret, a child’s first lie. <words>241</words> Ferried by currents beyond the Council’s grasp, they surfaced in distant realms, their truths sprouting like defiant reeds through cracks in the world’s foundation. <words>266</words> The Council, sensing their sovereignty fraying, cloaked themselves in starlight and descended to Lirien, their gondola slicing the water like a blade. <words>292</words>  

“You knead mud into mirrors,” hissed the Council’s High Seraph, her voice a chorus of dying stars. <words>311</words> “Cease, or we will unspool your soul.” <words>320</words> Veyra, hunched over his yarn swift, smiled—a humble defiance etched in the crinkles of his eyes. <words>340</words> “Stories are the first language,” he said, knotting a new thread. <words>353</words> “Even you were born from a tale told by something older.” <words>366</words>  

Enraged, the Seraph unleashed a tempest, yet every tapestry absorbed her fury, the villagers’ voices within them swelling into a hymn that shook the fortress stones. <words>393</words> Veyra hurled one last bottle into the fen, its message simple: “Remember—you were never alone.” <words>414</words> As the Council’s wrath dissolved the fortress, the bottles multiplied, a thousand vessels surfacing in unborn rivers, their truths echoing in the throat of the void. <words>444</words> And so, before the universe began, it learned its first secret: authority falters when the humblest stories flow unbidden, like wine from an eternal vintage. <words>474</words>
