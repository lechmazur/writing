The jaded locksmith dipped his brush into cerulean pigment, its scent permeating the pottery studio’s humid air as he painted vines onto a clay vase. <words>27</words> He’d come to this rooftop labyrinth orchard—a tangle of apple trees and wrought-iron arches crowning the colonial town’s gray slate roofs—to forget the clatter of keys and the hollow eyes of clients whispering about safes and betrayals. <words>65</words> But the orchard, with its demure audacity, had other plans. <words>76</words> Between strokes, a woman materialized beside him, her embroidered gloves caressing a half-formed urn. <words>92</words> “You’ve been picking locks too long, Elias,” she said, her voice delightfully menacing, like honey laced with glass. <words>109</words> “The throne remains unclaimed. And the huntress is restless.” <words>119</words>  

Elias’s hand froze. <words>122</words> The throne—a myth whispered by drunks in the taverns below, a relic of the town’s founders who’d vanished, leaving only their orchard and a mandate to preserve their ancient hunting methods: snares of starlight, arrows fletched with lies. <words>158</words> “Why tell me?” he muttered, studying her gloves’ intricate patterns—wolves chasing a crescent moon. <words>175</words> She slid a key from her sleeve, its teeth jagged like a predator’s grin. <words>189</words> “Because you’re the only one bitter enough to resist its lure.” <words>200</words>  

That night, Elias climbed the orchard’s spiraling paths, the key cold against his chest. <words>217</words> Moonlight painted the trees in silver, their branches knitting a ceiling above the throne—a seat of gnarled roots and iron petals, pulsating faintly as if alive. <words>242</words> But between him and it stood three figures, their faces masked by antlered helms, bows strung with threads of shadow. <words>261</words> The huntresses. <words>263</words> Guardians of rituals that turned flesh into folklore. <words>273</words>  

Elias slipped on the embroidered gloves, their threads prickling his skin like dormant spiders awakening. <words>290</words> The huntresses nocked arrows; he lunged, not toward the throne, but to a clay pot half-buried in the soil—his own creation, glazed earlier that day. <words>314</words> Shattering it, he released the scent trapped inside: crushed apple blossoms and rust, a perfume meant to permeate memory. <words>334</words> The huntresses staggered, their bows drooping as the aroma unspooled visions of their own forgotten deaths. <words>353</words>  

“The throne isn’t a prize,” Elias hissed, seizing the iron petals, “it’s a lock.” <words>368</words> With a turn, the roots shuddered, sealing the orchard’s magic deeper into the earth—preserving the old hunts by burying them. <words>390</words> The woman’s laughter echoed as dawn bled across the rooftops. <words>402</words> Elias pocketed the gloves, their embroidery now frayed, and descended to his workbench, where keys and clay awaited—tools, he understood, to guard what should never be found. <words>432</words>
