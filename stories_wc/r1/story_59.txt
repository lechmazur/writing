The mournful troubadour adjusted his embroidered collar, its frayed threads whispering of a love buried beneath comet dust and forgotten ballads. <words>24</words> He stood at the threshold of the echo chamber testing site, a cavernous dome where sound fractured into strangely predictable patterns, each reverberation a ghost of his own voice. <words>54</words> They’d called him here to demystify the silence—to find the heartbeat of nothingness amid silent struggles that had choked the city’s skies for decades. <words>85</words> But he knew the truth: this was a pilgrimage to outrun the collar’s memory, stitched by hands that now belonged to starlight. <words>107</words>  

The chamber’s walls hummed as he stepped inside, his lute slung across his back like a coffin. <words>125</words> “Echoes are just regrets with better timing,” he muttered, plucking a string to send a note spiraling into the void. <words>145</words> It split into harmonies—minor keys, always minor—before collapsing into a rhythm that mirrored his own pulse. <words>163</words> Predictable, yet unnerving, as though the chamber had rehearsed his grief. <words>177</words>  

He’d followed star trails to get here, navigating by constellations that pulsed like old wounds. <words>194</words> Their light had guided him through the Wastes, where shadows wore the faces of those he’d failed to mourn. <words>213</words> Now, beneath the dome’s artificial sky, he traced their paths again, fingertips brushing cold metal. <words>231</words> The collar itched, its embroidery spelling a name he refused to speak. <words>244</words>  

A voice crackled through the chamber’s intercom: “Begin phase three.” <words>256</words> The troubadour closed his eyes, playing a melody he’d sworn never to repeat—the one she’d written for him on the night the stars went dark. <words>280</words> Echoes converged, not as noise, but as shapes: a silhouette flickering in the center of the dome, reaching for him. <words>301</words> His fingers faltered. <words>304</words>  

“Confronting the past isn’t resurrection,” he whispered, though the chamber twisted his words into a chorus of doubt. <words>325</words> The silhouette solidified—a woman with eyes like eclipses, her throat wrapped in an identical collar. <words>344</words> She smiled, and the dome filled with a sound deeper than silence, a thrum that shuddered through his bones. <words>366</words> The heartbeat. <words>368</words>  

It wasn’t nothingness. <words>371</words> It was absence made audible—the space between stars, the pause between breaths. <words>387</words> The troubadour tore off his collar, its threads dissolving into ash as the chamber’s walls erupted in light. <words>407</words> When the glare faded, only his lute remained, its strings vibrating with a song he no longer recognized. <words>429</words>  

Outside, the city’s silence had broken into rain. <words>438</words> He walked, unburdened, as the sky wept for both of them. <words>450</words>
