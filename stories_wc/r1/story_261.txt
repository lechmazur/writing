<story>  
The orchard keeper’s fingers trembled as she sketched the particle acceleration garden’s skeletal trees, their roots clawing at soil poisoned by centuries of painted-over history. <words>28</words>  
Her borderline immortality had gifted her millennia to mourn ecosystems lost to humanity’s rigidly flexible morals—principles that bent like steel, never breaking until it was too late. <words>57</words>  
Today, the single earbud cover embedded in her collarbone hummed, its fractured circuitry a relic from the era that had shattered this world. <words>83</words>  
She dipped her brush into ink made from crushed reactor blooms, the liquid shimmering with trapped protons. <words>100</words>  
A drop spilled, spreading across her blueprint into ephemeral patterns only her augmented eyes could decipher—a map of decay, a key to revival. <words>123</words>  
“Launch protocols,” she muttered, bitter laughter escaping her lips as she recalled the last engineer’s joke: *You’ll need a miracle, not a gardener.* <words>149</words>  
But the garden *was* the accelerator, its ringed paths designed to collide botanical and atomic matter, stitching life from entropy. <words>170</words>  
Her thumb brushed the earbud cover, its rigidly flexible alloy cold against her skin—a failsafe switch for a system dormant since the skies turned gray. <words>195</words>  
The ink’s patterns now pulsed, mirroring the garden’s hidden magnetic fields. <words>207</words>  
She aligned the blueprint with the accelerator’s core, where a dead oak’s trunk housed the ignition chamber. <words>224</words>  
Decades ago, she’d buried her lover’s voice in that wood, their final plea—*rewild the stars*—etched into cellulose. <words>242</words>  
The earbud cover sparked, its fractured melody merging with the ink’s dance. <words>254</words>  
Protons stirred in the reactor blooms, their paths entwining like roots seeking water. <words>268</words>  
When the first beam ignited, the garden screamed. <words>276</words>  
Bark split, revealing bioluminescent fungi that hadn’t glowed since the Great Sterilization. <words>290</words>  
The keeper’s sketch floated into the accelerator’s vortex, each stroke bending spacetime to her will. <words>307</words>  
“You wanted miracles,” she whispered to the ghosts in the soil. <words>318</words>  
The oak shuddered, its heartwood birthing a sapling wrapped in starlight—a hybrid of chlorophyll and quark. <words>335</words>  
Air crackled as the sapling’s leaves emitted oxygen isotopes, purging toxins from the atmosphere. <words>350</words>  
But equilibrium wavered; the painted-over history fought back. <words>359</words>  
Frost spread across the accelerator’s ring, threatening to snap the fragile beam. <words>372</words>  
The keeper slammed her palm against the earbud cover, sacrificing its last charge to stabilize the pulse. <words>390</words>  
Light erupted, etching new constellations into the sky—a blueprint for ecosystems yet unnamed. <words>406</words>  
As the sapling’s roots pierced the poisoned earth, she laughed again, bitterness dissolving into something almost like hope. <words>426</words>  
The garden remembered how to grow. <words>431</words>
