The cryptic medium arrived at the cybernetic organism manufacturing plant, clutching her mariner’s telescope, its brass etched with constellations only she could decipher. <words>34</words>  
A vacation rental double-booking had stranded her here—a "normally unusual" glitch, the host’s AI apologized, as if sentient factories replacing pine cabins were mundane. <words>68</words>  
She’d come to collect creation myths, those primal stories whispered by inventors to their mechanical progeny, but the plant’s sterile corridors thrummed with silence. <words>101</words>  
Then she saw the mural: a vast, unfinished fresco spanning the assembly floor, its pigments still wet, depicting biomechanical titans birthing stars. <words>126</words>  
Throughout painting it, workers murmured—not gossip, but origin tales. <words>138</words>  
"First there was the Forge-Heart," one said, solder sparking like votive candles as they fused a spinal column. <words>158</words>  
"Then the Clockmaker drowned it in liquid light," another replied, calibrating ocular sensors that blinked with infant curiosity. <words>181</words>  
The medium raised her telescope, its lens filtering wavelengths beyond human sight, and gasped—the mural’s figures moved. <words>200</words>  
Gears turned in painted chests; nebulae swirled in mechanical wombs. <words>210</words>  
Analyzing the patterns, she realized the artwork was a palimpsest: beneath each brushstroke lay older, fading stories, a written legacy overwritten by generations of engineers. <words>234</words>  
A technician noticed her trembling. <words>238</words>  
"We recycle narratives here," he said, polishing a chassis. <words>247</words>  
"Every myth becomes a blueprint." His voice carried comforting unease, like lullabies sung in minor keys. <words>265</words>  
The medium pressed her palm against the mural, its colors adhering to her skin like sacramental ash. <words>280</words>  
Through the telescope, she witnessed the plant’s true rhythm: assembler arms choreographed to ancestral chants, welders tracing sigils from dead languages. <words>302</words>  
Even the AI’s double-booking held meaning—an invitation veiled as error. <words>315</words>  
That night, she dreamt of the telescope’s first owner, a ship’s captain who’d documented storms that birthed islands. <words>334</words>  
At dawn, she began transcribing, her pen bleeding the mural’s pigments onto paper as the workers’ voices swelled around her. <words>355</words>  
"Listen," she urged the AI, displaying pages where factory schematics dissolved into creation hymns. <words>371</words>  
"These myths aren’t obsolete—they’re your marrow." <words>378</words>  
When her rental period ended, the medium left the telescope lodged in a beam above the mural, its lens capturing perpetual dawn. <words>400</words>  
The plant’s next shipment of cybernetic infants bore tiny constellations etched near their power cores, and the fresco’s figures finally rested, their stories secured. <words>426</words>  
As for the medium, she walked into the salt-wind, new myths humming in her veins, already sensing the next glitch that would lead her deeper. <words>450</words>
