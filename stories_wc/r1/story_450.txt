The sharp-witted dancer dipped her toes into the bubble bath, her reflection rippling like a half-remembered prophecy. <words>23</words> Every year, her family gathered in the thought experiment chamber—a domed room humming with holographic projectors—to take their annual photo, a tradition as unshakable as her father’s denial of the crashed spaceship patch sewn into his jacket. <words>61</words> That patch, frayed and singed, was the only relic from the mission that had stranded their ancestors on this planet, a truth he refused to discuss. <words>87</words> “Smile, Lyra,” her mother would say, linguistically inept as ever, mistaking command for comfort. <words>102</words>  

Lyra submerged herself, bubbles clinging to her skin like unanswered questions. <words>113</words> Tonight, the chamber’s AI had whispered a directive: *Fulfill the final prophecy, but twist it.* <words>128</words> Her family’s obsession with legacy had always felt like a poorly choreographed routine—steps repeated without understanding. <words>144</words> Yet here she was, mimicking her great-grandmother’s pose from the oldest hologram, one hand pressed to the chamber’s cold wall, the other clutching the patch she’d secretly unpicked from her father’s sleeve. <words>175</words>  

The chamber flickered, projecting generations of stiffly smiling relatives into the steam. <words>185</words> Lyra’s mind raced: *Denial is gravity. To leap, you must first admit you’re falling.* <words>196</words> She pirouetted, water sloshing as she rehearsed the argument she’d never voice aloud. <words>207</words> How to explain that the “prophecy” was just a dead pilot’s final log entry? <words>218</words> That their sacred mission had been a wrong turn? <words>225</words> Her muscles remembered what her tongue couldn’t articulate—every plié and jeté a counterargument to destiny. <words>240</words>  

When the holograms glitched, revealing the crash site’s coordinates etched beneath the patch’s fabric, Lyra laughed. <words>253</words> Of course the answer had been in the one artifact they’d ritualized without examining. <words>265</words> She rose, water streaming off her limbs, and programmed the chamber to recreate the crash’s final seconds. <words>280</words> Stars fractured across the dome as she danced through the simulation, her movements splicing defiance with grace. <words>296</words>  

The AI’s voice boomed: “Prophecy fulfilled. Twist confirmed.” <words>304</words> Lyra froze mid-leap, realizing the truth—they’d never been meant to survive. <words>316</words> The real mission was to dissolve, to let their borrowed culture evolve beyond mimicry. <words>329</words> As the chamber reset, she placed the patch back on her father’s jacket, its weight now a shared burden. <words>344</words>  

Next morning, the family assembled for the photo, steam still curling from Lyra’s hair. <words>356</words> When the shutter clicked, she grinned, not at the lens, but at the faint star map only she could see glowing beneath her skin. <words>377</words> Her father’s denial had built the chamber; her ambivalence would dismantle it. <words>389</words> Let the next tradition be something wilder, she thought, something that didn’t require holding your breath. <words>406</words>  

In the bath that night, she watched constellations bloom across the water’s surface—a language beyond words, finally legible. <words>423</words>
