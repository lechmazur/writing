The orchard’s trees hummed with bioluminescent sap, their branches clawing at the sky of the floating futuristic hub, but Kaela’s fingers tightened around the fossilized dragon tooth in her pocket, its ridges biting into her palm like a reprimand. <words>40</words> She hadn’t asked to inherit this cursed grove, where peaches rotted before ripening and holographic pests whispered riddles in dead languages—yet here she stood, boots sinking into iridescent soil, analytically playful mind already dissecting the rot. <words>82</words> The previous caretaker’s journal had mentioned a cave beneath the northern farmhouse, and there, between stalactites shaped like fractured algorithms, she’d found the tooth: ancient, petrified, and humming with a frequency that made her molars ache. <words>127</words>  

“Voice of the unknown,” she muttered, the phrase from the journal’s last entry gnawing at her as she approached the first rotting farmhouse, its walls oozing nanite-infused mold. <words>160</words> Inside, shadows pooled like spilled ink, but Kaela grinned, activating her wristband’s ultraviolet scanner—playfulness was her scalpel, and mystery her dissection table. <words>190</words> The beam revealed glyphs on the ceiling: a star map overlapping with the hub’s orbital path, dated to a millennium ago when dragons supposedly terraformed the system. <words>222</words>  

Gripping the tooth tighter, she pressed it against the wall, and the mold recoiled, exposing a hidden panel. <words>242</words> Inside lay a prism that fractured time—or perhaps memory—showing a woman in archaic robes burying a seed where the orchard now stood, tears crystallizing into amber around her feet. <words>275</words> “Sorrow fertilizes growth,” the vision whispered, and Kaela’s throat tightened with gleeful sorrow, the joy of discovery wedded to the ache of understanding. <words>302</words>  

By the third farmhouse, dawn’s hush had begun to bleed through the hub’s forcefield, staining the sky the color of unspoken secrets. <words>327</words> Here, the tooth vibrated violently, guiding her to a cellar where roots had shattered the floor, revealing a chamber lined with dragonbone machinery. <words>352</words> Symbols on the walls matched the tooth’s grooves—keys to a lock. <words>366</words> Kaela slotted it into a central socket, and the room shuddered, machinery awakening in a crescendo of grinding gears and spectral wails. <words>391</words>  

The orchard’s curse, she realized, wasn’t a punishment but a cry for translation: the dragons had encoded their extinction into the trees, hoping someone would unravel their elegy. <words>421</words> Sap surged upward, birthing blossoms that glowed like newborn stars, and Kaela laughed wetly as the hub’s citizens gathered, marveling at the fruit now swelling with light. <words>452</words> She’d gripped the tooth, and it had gripped back, etching its story into her bones—she was no longer just a caretaker but a synapse between eras, her voice a bridge for the forgotten. <words>486</words>  

As the hidden sunrise fully emerged, Kaela plucked a peach, its skin shimmering with constellations, and bit into sweetness laced with ashes. <words>511</words> The unknown had found its tongue, and it tasted like both requiem and rebirth. <words>527</words>
