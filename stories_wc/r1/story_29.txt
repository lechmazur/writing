<story>  
Sir Gareth knelt in the shadow of the hedge maze, his armor reflecting the dying gasp of the streetlamp above. <words>23</words>  
The flicker faded, plunging the labyrinth into a hush thick enough to swallow his breath. <words>39</words>  
Before him lay the mystic orchard garden, its gnarled trees heavy with fruit that glowed like trapped regrets. <words>60</words>  
He’d come to sabotage the Machine—the clanking monolith at the garden’s heart that churned memories into torment. <words>81</words>  
His sister’s laughter, stolen by its gears five winters past, coiled in his chest like a vow. <words>97</words>  

A glint caught his eye: a stray jigsaw edge lodged in the soil, silver and humming. <words>114</words>  
It matched the fragmented schematics he’d scavenged from the Clockwork Abbey. <words>127</words>  
“Cleverly naive,” the abbey’s mechanist had called him, but Gareth knew puzzles—knew their edges held truths too sharp for wise men. <words>153</words>  
He pocketed the piece, its frequency syncing with the orchard’s buried ley lines, a map of whispers. <words>170</words>  

The Machine loomed ahead, its pistons exhaling fog that reeked of salt and unsent letters. <words>188</words>  
Regrets cycled through its glass chambers: a baker’s burnt loaf, a widow’s unspoken apology, his sister’s last scream. <words>208</words>  
Gareth’s hand trembled. Neutralizing it required harmony with its core frequency—a song only the desperate could hear. <words>229</words>  
He pressed the jigsaw edge against the Machine’s rusted panel. <words>239</words>  
Metal screamed. <words>241</words>  

The orchard shuddered, roots tangling his boots as the hedges tightened. <words>253</words>  
Cryptic tones pulsed from the jigsaw, syncing with the Machine’s arrhythmic heart. <words>268</words>  
Gareth hummed, off-key and determined, until the vibrations blurred into resonance. <words>283</words>  
Agonizing bliss seared his veins—the Machine’s poison and antidote woven into one. <words>298</words>  
Memories flooded him: his sister’s hands guiding his sword, her voice chiding, “You rush toward light, never what lurks beneath.” <words>323</words>  

The panel split. <words>325</words>  
Inside, a crystalline engine throbbed, its core a mosaic of missing fragments. <words>339</words>  
Gareth slotted the jigsaw edge into the void. <words>348</words>  
The garden stilled. <words>351</words>  
Then—a sound like shattered mirrors. <words>357</words>  

The Machine collapsed inward, regrets dissolving into fireflies that settled on the trees. <words>374</words>  
His sister’s laughter rang once more, brief and bright, before joining the orchard’s eternal glow. <words>393</words>  
Gareth sank to his knees, clutching the now-dull jigsaw piece. <words>406</words>  
Reclaiming the lost, he realized, meant surrendering the hope of keeping them. <words>422</words>  
Above, the streetlamp sparked back to life, its frail light a silent requiem. <words>438</words>
