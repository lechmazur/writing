Officer Mira Thalos adjusted her damp uniform collar, staring at the kelp forest swaying beyond her observation post’s glass walls—a utopia’s sentinel, yet she hadn’t slept in 72 hours. <words>34</words>  
Her desk vibrated; the antique bread box she’d inherited from her grandmother rattled, its carved wheat sheaves glowing faintly. <words>57</words>  
“Genuinely fake,” the archives had labeled it—a replica of some pre-utopian relic—but tonight, its hum synced with the tribal drumbeat suddenly pulsing in her skull. <words>86</words>  
A shadow coalesced in the kelp: a woman woven from bioluminescence and regret, lips moving soundlessly as Mira’s own voice echoed, *“I swear I’ll fix this.”* <words>113</words>  
The promise she’d made to her dying mother—sworn at this exact second seven years ago—now hung tangible in the salt-thick air. <words>133</words>  
The specter pressed a translucent hand to the glass, and Mira’s breath fogged with frost as the drum rhythm quickened, pulling her upright. <words>154</words>  
“You’re here to guide me, aren’t you?” she whispered, touching the bread box. <words>168</words>  
The ghost nodded, kelp braided into her hair like a crown. <words>178</words>  
Mira laughed, tears smearing her cheeks—how else does one greet the absurdity of bureaucracy meeting the supernatural? <words>195</words>  
She opened the box. <words>198</words>  
Inside lay a drumstick carved from whalebone, its surface etched with waves. <words>210</words>  
As her fingers closed around it, the observation post dissolved into a seafloor clearing, kelp forming a cavern lit by drifting jellyfish. <words>229</words>  
The ghost danced now, feet stirring sand into spirals, her movements dictating the drum’s tempo. <words>243</words>  
Mira mirrored her, pounding the rhythm onto the bread box’s lid, each strike unraveling memories: overtime hours erasing her mother’s voice, policy manuals replacing lullabies. <words>268</words>  
“Why show me this?” Mira shouted over the crescendo. <words>276</words>  
The specter whirled, eyes voids where stars might drown. <words>285</words>  
*You buried your grief in work,* her silence accused. *Now let it rise.* <words>298</words>  
Mira’s next strike cracked the lid. <words>304</words>  
Light erupted, and the kelp forest ignited in blue flame—not destroying, but revealing. <words>318</words>  
Every enforcement order she’d ever signed floated past, inked not with regulations, with *I’m afraid to stop. Afraid to remember.* <words>338</words>  
The drumstick splintered. <words>341</words>  
Mira faltered, but the ghost clasped her hands, their rhythm becoming one. <words>353</words>  
Sand stung her eyes as she laughed again, wild and raw—this was her mother’s last lesson, not a haunting but a wake. <words>373</words>  
Dawn bled through the water above as the specter faded, her form dissolving into a single pearl that dropped into the bread box. <words>394</words>  
Mira awoke at her desk, the drumstick gone, the box’s glow now a warm, steady pulse. <words>409</words>  
She filed a leave request, then walked into the kelp forest, trailing fingers through fronds that bent toward her, no longer a warden but a student ready to listen. <words>437</words>  
Somewhere, a drumbeat lingered, teaching her how to breathe. <words>446</words>
