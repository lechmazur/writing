The fact-minded oracle clutched the brass compass, its needle spinning wildly in the unstable dimension where time folded like origami. <words>25</words> She had always dismissed empathy as a statistical anomaly, but now, stranded in this fracturing realm, the compass demanded she *feel* her way forward. <words>53</words> Its engravings glowed—a map to forgotten places, ones erased by collective indifference. <words>73</words> "Desperately casual," she muttered, smoothing her frayed cloak, a mantra to mask the panic gnawing her ribs. <words>94</words>  

A heartbreak-induced vision struck: a boy weeping over a collapsed starling’s nest, his grief echoing through decades. <words>115</words> The oracle gasped, her rigid logic splintering as the child’s sorrow flooded her veins. <words>130</words> *Recompose*, she ordered herself, digging nails into her palm, but the vision clung—a second heartbeat, raw and insistent. <words>153</words> The compass needle steadied, pointing toward a fissure humming with forgotten songs. <words>168</words>  

She crawled through, emerging into the cradle of a whispered minute—a transient pocket where lost memories coalesced. <words>188</words> Here, the air shimmered with half-formed apologies and abandoned lullabies. <words>202</words> The boy’s starling flickered into being, its broken wings mending as she whispered, "I see you." <words>222</words> Empathy, she realized, wasn’t a detour; it was the axis the compass had always meant to follow. <words>242</words>  

Another vision: a widow planting acorns in a war-cratered field, her hands trembling with defiant hope. <words>259</words> The oracle let the ache take root, her old self unraveling as the compass lit anew. <words>276</words> Each forgotten place was a requiem and a resurrection, stitching the unstable dimension back together through shared scars. <words>297</words> She laughed then, breathless, her desperation morphing into something dangerously like optimism. <words>315</words>  

The final fissure awaited. <words>319</words> Inside, she found her own memory: a younger self, burying her mother’s laughter to avoid the weight of grief. <words>340</words> "You don’t have to be a monument," she told the girl, and as the memory dissolved, the dimension stilled. <words>361</words> The compass settled, its needle true north—a path no longer measured in facts, but in fractures healed. <words>382</words>  

Time reknitted. <words>383</words> The oracle stepped back into her world, the brass compass warm against her chest, its purpose clear. <words>401</words> Forgotten places weren’t locations; they were unspoken wounds, waiting for someone brave enough to whisper, "I see you." <words>424</words> And in that seeing, the universe held its breath, whole again for a fleeting, desperate moment. <words>443</words>
