<story>Sir Gareth of the Shattered Shield stood before the lighthouse prison, its cracked tower clawing at storm-clouds like a skeletal hand. <words>27</words> The brass door knocker—a leering selkie with emerald eyes—bit into his palm as he rapped thrice, each strike echoing the vow he’d sworn to the drowned queen: silence the final cry of regret, or join her in the brine. <words>66</words> Salt-crusted hinges groaned open, revealing a spiral stair choked with relics—a moth-eaten bridal veil, a child’s bone rattle, a dagger etched with lovers’ initials—all glowing faintly in the lighthouse’s fractured beam. <words>105</words> "Patterns," Gareth rasped, tasting blood from where the reef had gashed his cheek. <words>117</words> The grudgingly sweet scent of rotting lilies guided him upward, each step heavier than the last. <words>132</words>  

In the lens chamber, a thousand mirrors reflected Gareth’s ruin—rust-pitted armor, eye milky from wyrm venom, the shame-twist of his mouth. <words>159</words> Before the central glass stood his squire, Joric, translucent as seafoam and weeping black tears. <words>176</words> "You shouldn’t have come back," the ghost said, voice cracking like thin ice. <words>190</words> Gareth’s gauntlet passed through the boy’s shoulder, yet the cold burned. <words>201</words>  

The lighthouse beam flared, illuminating the relics now arranged on the floor—veil draped over rattle, dagger piercing both—exactly as Joric had died protecting Gareth’s bride from the wyrm. <words>235</words> "Appreciate the irony," Gareth choked, drawing the wyrmfang sword from his back. <words>247</words> "To hush your regret, I must become mine." <words>257</words>  

Mirrors rippled. <words>259</words> The selkie knocker’s laughter rattled the tower. <words>266</words> Joric’s form flickered between the slain youth and the wyrm itself, coiled and hissing. <words>281</words> Gareth understood now—the prison mirrored hearts, not stone. <words>292</words> Strike down the wyrm’s reflection, and Joric’s soul would shatter. <words>304</words> Spare it, and the lighthouse’s light—the last dam against the drowned queen’s fury—would fail. <words>322</words>  

Rain slashed through broken panes as Gareth raised his sword in joyful agony, the blade singing with a choice he’d already made years ago on a bloody beach. <words>347</words> "Forgive me," he whispered—to Joric, to the bride who’d cursed his name, to the knight he’d once been. <words>364</words> Steel met glass in a scream of light. <words>372</words>  

When the shards settled, the lighthouse stood empty. <words>380</words> Fishermen would later swear they saw two shadows in the beam—one armored and straight-backed, the other slight and laughing—chasing gulls through the storm’s teeth. <words>407</words> On the shore below, the brass selkie kept vigil, emerald eyes dimmed, forever holding its tongue. <words>426</words></story>
