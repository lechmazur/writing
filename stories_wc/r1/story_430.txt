The Kaleidoscope Park hummed with fractured light, its prismatic hedges shifting patterns like a deck of cards shuffled by a cheat. <words>20</words>  
Here, Vyrra the Reaver nursed her solitude, armored in scars and the child’s drawing she’d carried since her mother’s pyre—a crude sun with too many rays, scrawled on paper now soft as skin. <words>50</words>  
“Still clinging to that?” crooned the Crow-Cage, a charm of bones and feathers perched on her shoulder, its voice syrup-thick and rotting. <words>73</words>  
It nagged daily, its beak clacking out verses from the poems Vyrra etched in the park’s margins—*”Ash-born, blade-bound, why dig graves in cloud-ground?”*—each line dissecting her hunger to taste the stars. <words>105</words>  

Generations of Reavers had swallowed celestial fire and burned alive; her mother’s last kiss had charred Vyrra’s cheek. <words>127</words>  
Yet the Crow-Cage insisted: *”Break the pyre’s pulse, steal the sky’s first sigh.”* <words>143</words>  
It was grotesque, this thing her ancestors had forged from guilt and crow skulls—charming only when it stopped laughing. <words>163</words>  

At dusk, the park’s kaleidoscope stilled, revealing a hidden altar where starlight pooled like liquid mercury. <words>184</words>  
Vyrra unfolded the drawing, its edges trembling. <words>193</words>  
“She drew this before she lied,” she muttered, tracing the sun’s jagged rays. <words>209</words>  
Her mother had sworn the stars were poison—then swallowed one whole. <words>224</words>  

The Crow-Cage pecked her ear. <words>229</words>  
*”Daughter of embers, leap before you’re tender.”* <words>240</words>  
“I’d rather eat your ribs,” she snapped, but stepped onto the altar, the child’s sun clutched to her chest. <words>261</words>  

Above, the constellations writhed. <words>266</words>  
One star detached—a silver mote—and Vyrra lunged, teeth bared. <words>281</words>  
It melted on her tongue: honey and frost, the scream of a newborn, her mother’s voice singing *”Hush, it’s just a spark—”* <words>304</words>  

The lie detonated. <words>307</words>  
Vyrra’s bones became glass; her blood, liquid starlight. <words>320</words>  
The Crow-Cage disintegrated, cackling *”Finally, a Reaver who chews!”* as its feathers turned to dust. <words>340</words>  

When dawn fractured the park, Vyrra stood whole, the drawing now blank. <words>355</words>  
New poems bled into the hedges—her own, this time. <words>367</words>  
*”Stars are stolen lies, sweet as a mother’s lullabies.”* <words>380</words>  
She spat silver onto the soil, where it sprouted into a flower with teeth. <words>397</words>  

The next Reaver would find it, perhaps. <words>405</words>  
Or the next. <words>408</words>  
Generations are patient, and the Kaleidoscope Park never runs out of margins. <words>423</words>  
Vyrra walked away, tasting the ghost of honey, wondering if her kiss had been hunger or forgiveness. <words>443</words>  
Above, the stars winked—charmingly grotesque, and terribly amused. <words>456</words>
