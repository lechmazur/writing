The philosopher Elara Voss knit by lamplight in the backroom of *The Silver Needle*, a speakeasy frozen in Jazz Age decadence, its velvet drapes and gramophone crackle preserving 1926 like insects in amber. <words>40</words> Her needles clicked, weaving yarn into a scarf, while her other hand traced cryptic symbols etched into an oversize pewter mug—a relic from a Weimar occultist, its surface dense with spiraling cuneiform that hummed when touched. <words>80</words> The mug’s codes, she’d deduced, mapped celestial harmonics capable of bending cosmic threads… if one didn’t mind severing a few mortal ones first. <words>109</words>  

She paused, adjusting her worn gardening gloves, their leather palms stained with indigo and verdigris from handling the mug’s toxic alloys. <words>131</words> Tonight, she’d decode the final sequence, though the act felt ethically questionable even for her: to impair the boundary between realms, inviting wonder at the cost of equilibrium. <words>159</words> A trumpet’s mournful wail seeped through the floorboards as the club’s band played *St. James Infirmary*, the music syncopating with her pulse. <words>181</words>  

Three stitches left. <words>184</words> Two. <words>185</words> One. <words>186</words> The scarf unfurled, its pattern revealing a fractal helix only visible under starlight—a failsafe, should the mug’s power overspill. <words>207</words> Elara poured absinthe into the vessel, watching liquid shiver into glyphs: **Ūru-anna**, **Kur-gal**, words that tasted of static and distant supernovas. <words>230</words> The room dimmed; the lamp’s flame stretched upward, thin as a needle. <words>244</words>  

A presence coalesced—a shimmering lattice of light above the mug, its geometry both beautiful and *wrong*, like a spiderweb spun by diamonds. <words>268</words> Elara’s breath fogged despite the heat. <words>275</words> This was the moment: channel the lattice into her knitting, weaving cosmic resonance into fabric… or stop. <words>295</words> But wonder had always been her addiction, her compass. <words>306</words> She thrust the scarf into the lattice. <words>315</words>  

Reality splintered. <words>316</words> The speakeasy’s walls dissolved into starfields, patrons’ laughter echoing as if from light-years away. <words>333</words> Her gloves blackened, fingertips blistering as the scarf absorbed the lattice, threads glowing like nebulas. <words>351</words> It worked—until she noticed the cracks. <words>358</words> Hairline fractures in the mug, the floor, her own reflection, multiplying as the cosmos bled through. <words>377</words>  

“*You’ll unravel us all!*” hissed a voice—the barkeep, Mr. Hemsley, materializing with a double-barreled shotgun. <words>397</words> His face rippled, wax melting under interdimensional static. <words>408</words> Elara lunged, snatching the mug as he fired; buckshot shredded her scarf, releasing a supernova’s sigh that froze the bullets midair. <words>432</words>  

She ran, clutching the mug, through corridors now infinite and recursive. <words>443</words> Behind her, Hemsley’s shouts warped into whale song. <words>453</words> The gloves disintegrated, her hands raw, but the codes were memorized. <words>466</words> Tomorrow, she’d begin anew—knitting, decoding, chasing wonder through broken symmetries. <words>481</words> Ethics, she reasoned, were a pendulum; tonight, it swung toward radiance. <words>496</words> Somewhere, a trumpet played on. <words>502</words>
