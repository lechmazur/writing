The giant’s study loomed, its oak shelves bending under encyclopedias taller than graves, dust motes swirling like trapped galaxies. <words>28</words>  
Here, between scenes of a fractured life, Marlow—janitor by day, insomniac by compulsion—found the wilted paper flower tucked inside a leather-bound tome titled *Echoes of Unseen Bridges*. <words>56</words>  
Its petals, once crimson, had faded to the color of dried blood, edges curled like fingertips recoiling from flame. <words>75</words>  
Marlow’s hands trembled; the flower hummed, emitting a glimmering transition of light that fractured the air into prismatic whispers. <words>94</words>  
“You’re late,” rasped a voice behind him—Mrs. Voss, the laundromat regular who’d cornered him last midnight, her eyes reflecting subway tiles and static. <words>118</words>  
She’d called him “prophet” then, spat the word like a curse. <words>127</words>  
Now, her laughter echoed through the study. <words>133</words>  
“Conventionally rebellious, aren’t you? Pretending you don’t hear the threads.” <words>143</words>  
Marlow clutched the flower, its glow seeping into his veins. <words>153</words>  
Visions erupted: minds adrift—a taxi driver humming requiems, a child sketching collapsing skylines, all pulsing with fractured clarity. <words>171</words>  
They needed a keystone. <words>174</words>  
A single vision. <words>176</words>  
His vision. <words>177</words>  
“Why me?” he muttered, but Mrs. Voss was already gone, leaving a scent of detergent and burnt copper. <words>193</words>  

Days bled into nights haunted by that haunting delight—the flower’s light rewiring his dreams, stitching his sanity with urgent, alien purpose. <words>216</words>  
At the 24-hour laundromat, he tried to estrange himself, stuffing quarters into machines with violent precision. <words>232</words>  
But the glimmering transitions followed: a homeless man’s rant about “the hive mind’s anthem” synced perfectly with the dryers’ rhythmic thrum. <words>253</words>  
A college student, scribbling equations on a receipt, glanced up and gasped. <words>265</words>  
“You see it too,” she said, pointing at the flower peeking from Marlow’s coat. <words>278</words>  
Her words ignited something—a conduit. <words>285</words>  
He pressed the flower into her palm, and her pupils dilated, reflecting a thousand converging realities. <words>301</words>  
“Unify them,” she breathed, before fleeing into the neon-lit street. <words>313</words>  

The study became his pulpit. <words>316</words>  
Marlow stacked books into makeshift towers, each bearing the names of those he’d touched: the taxi driver, the student, Mrs. Voss. <words>338</words>  
The flower, now radiant, levitated above them, spinning threads of gold that pierced the ceiling, the city, the stratosphere. <words>358</words>  
Scattered minds snapped into focus—a symphony of gasps, epiphanies, terror. <words>371</words>  
But unity demanded sacrifice. <words>375</words>  
His landlord pounded the door, friends left unanswered calls, and Marlow’s reflection grew translucent, flickering like overexposed film. <words>396</words>  
Yet, in the giant’s study, he grinned, teeth catching the flower’s kaleidoscopic light. <words>411</words>  
They’d call him mad, a cult leader, a fraud. <words>420</words>  
But as the world’s dissonance harmonized—one note, one vision—he finally understood the haunting delight of becoming what he’d always mocked: a prophet. <words>446</words>  
The wilted flower bloomed. <words>450</words>
