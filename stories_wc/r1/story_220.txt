The aloof page wandered the towering labyrinth of shipping containers, their rusted edges bleeding orange under a bruised sky. <words>24</words> Across the lull of a wounded season—a port city’s breath held between decay and renewal—he traced cryptic symbols etched into steel, seeking patterns in the predictably odd. <words>53</words> His fingers brushed a dented crate, and a water-stained logbook tumbled out, its pages whispering of abyssal trenches and a diver’s final dive. <words>80</words>  

A crane’s malfunction delayed his return, stranding him as tides gnawed the docks. <words>95</words> In the shadow of a leaning container, he met her: a retired deep-sea engineer, her eyes sharp as sonar. <words>115</words> “That book,” she said, “belonged to someone who drowned in plain sight.” <words>130</words> Her words hooked his unstoppable curiosity—the same that had exiled him from the palace’s gilded lies. <words>148</words>  

Together, they reconstructed the diver’s last journey, decoding entries about luminous creatures that mimicked human voices. <words>169</words> “He thought he’d found a city below,” she murmured, “but it was a mirror, reflecting what we bury.” <words>189</words> The page’s pulse quickened; the logbook wasn’t a record—it was a map. <words>204</words>  

By dawn, they’d pieced together coordinates hidden in the margins, a path through the container maze to a submerged vault. <words>228</words> The engineer laughed, a sound like corroded gears. <words>237</words> “You’re chasing ghosts, boy.” <words>242</words> But the page clutched the book tighter, its weight proof that power could be reclaimed, even from depths. <words>263</words>  

They navigated the labyrinth, past graffiti-eyed gulls and salt-rotten ropes, until the vault loomed—a shipping container sealed with chains older than the port. <words>289</words> Inside, pressure suits hung like shed skins, and a helmet’s cracked visor still fogged with phantom breath. <words>309</words> The engineer hesitated. <words>312</words> “Illusions drown faster than men.” <words>318</words>  

The page pried open the diver’s locker, revealing a glass vial of bioluminescent algae—a living echo of the trench’s false city. <words>341</words> “He brought the illusion up,” the page realized, “to prove it could be mastered.” <words>358</words> The algae pulsed in his palm, a heartbeat syncing with his own. <words>374</words>  

When the palace guards finally found him, he stood at the docks, the vial glowing in his fist. <words>394</words> Their lies about loyalty and duty dissolved in the algae’s cold light. <words>409</words> He inhaled the salted wind, no longer a page but a keeper of thresholds, his curiosity now an anchor. <words>431</words>  

The engineer vanished, leaving a note: “Some labyrinths are exits.” <words>441</words> He smiled, pocketing the vial—a small, radiant thing to pierce the dark. <words>456</words> Above, the gulls wheeled, their cries blending with the distant hum of cranes stirring back to life. <words>476</words> In the wounded season’s lull, he’d found a tide that turned on his own terms. <words>493</words>
