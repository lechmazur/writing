The irate smuggler jogged across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his boots crunching over fractured solar panels and the bones of derelict cargo drones. <words>27</words> His left hand clenched a single chopstick—splintered, charred at one end—while his right brushed the pistol at his hip, a habit he’d sworn to quit but couldn’t. <words>56</words> Three weeks ago, the chopstick’s twin had been buried in his partner’s throat, a parting gift from syndicate enforcers who’d deemed their water-smuggling operation “excessively sentimental.” <words>88</words> Now, he ran not from them, but toward the myth of hidden waterfalls cascading in the dead zone’s canyons, where gravity twisted like bad faith. <words>113</words>  

He paused beneath the skeletal arch of a docking arm, lungs burning, and fumbled for his thermos. <words>130</words> The tea inside was bitter, brewed from lichen scraped off the flight deck’s corroded bulkheads, but its leaves were his only compass. <words>151</words> Swirling the dregs with the chopstick, he studied the patterns: a spiral, a fractured line, a shape like a fist unclenching. <words>172</words> “Memorialize this,” his partner had once laughed, flicking tea droplets at a star chart, “or your heart’ll revolt before your legs do.” <words>194</words>  

The smuggler snorted. <words>195</words> Revolt was too kind a word for the thing gnawing his ribs—an abstractly physical hunger, sharp as vacuum, that had driven him to abandon three loaded cargo skiffs and sprint into the wastes. <words>227</words> Waterfalls weren’t profit. <words>229</words> Waterfalls were a dead woman’s bedtime story, a delirium of mist and momentum. <words>243</words> Yet here he was, chasing echoes in a place even scavengers avoided, because the alternative was admitting she’d been right. <words>265</words>  

A glint caught his eye: a child’s datapad, half-buried in ash. <words>278</words> Its cracked screen showed a fragment of a hydroponics manual, a doodle of birds circling a cliff, and a timestamp from 12 years ago—the month the spaceport had choked on its own greed and died. <words>311</words> He pocketed it, a pointless act that made his throat tighten. <words>325</words> Sentimentality killed faster than radiation here, but he’d already named the hunger in his chest: if he couldn’t bring her back, he’d find the damn water and let it erode him. <words>356</words>  

The thermos trembled as he poured another serving. <words>364</words> Leaves coiled into a new shape—a bridge, or a throat cut sideways. <words>377</words> He hurled the chopstick like a javelin. <words>384</words> It struck a rusted fuel pump, ringing a discordant note that shuddered through the deck. <words>400</words> Then, from the canyon below, an answer: not a echo, but a roar, low and relentless. <words>418</words>  

He edged to the precipice. <words>422</words> There, veiled by ionized fog, a waterfall plunged upward, defying the dead zone’s inverted pull, its spray catching starlight like a confession. <words>447</words> The smuggler didn’t smile. <words>449</words> He knelt, scooped a handful of dry dust, and let it trickle into the abyss, a bitter offering to the heart’s stupid, glorious revolt. <words>474</words> Behind him, the chopstick vibrated faintly, as if singing. <words>486</words>
