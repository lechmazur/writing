The impassive deputy stood beneath the cathedral’s crumbling arches, her boots sinking into moss as thick as a confession. <words>25</words> Above, the orchard’s gnarled branches wove through rafters like veins, their leaves trembling with the secret language of bees—a hum that mapped the unseen. <words>54</words> She’d come during oil changes, when the garage next door drowned the world in grease and growls, leaving the cathedral’s echoes uncharted, ripe for trespass. <words>84</words> Her badge weighed heavy, but heavier still was the twist tie coiled around her finger, its plastic edges twisted into something resembling a crown. <words>111</words> It had arrived in her mailbox, anonymous, alongside a photo of this place and a single word: *Grace*. <words>131</words>  

The bees swarmed a fissure in the wall, their dance a cipher she’d learned from her mother, a keeper of hives before the silence took her. <words>159</words> *Follow the pollen*, their bodies seemed to spell. <words>167</words> The deputy climbed a rotting ladder, each rung a gamble, her movements personally impersonal—routine as breath, lethal as a sniper’s patience. <words>192</words> In the rafters, peaches glowed like lanterns, their sweetness clashing with the reek of motor oil seeping through stone. <words>213</words> She stretched to pluck one, her sleeve catching on a nail, and froze: beneath the fruit lay a child’s doll, its face smudged with decades. <words>239</words>  

Echoes here were not sound but ghosts. <words>244</words> The doll’s dress bore the same pattern as the twist tie—a spiral, endless. <words>259</words> Bees clustered at its hollow chest, their wings fanning a memory: a girl hiding here during a war, weaving crowns from wire, her laughter cut short by collapse. <words>290</words> The deputy’s throat tightened. <words>293</words> Grace, she realized, wasn’t a thing to possess but to witness—a fracture in time where beauty outran ruin. <words>316</words>  

A rafter creaked. <words>318</words> Below, a shadow pooled—the mechanic from the garage, his hands blackened, eyes sharp as shivs. <words>339</words> “You found her,” he rasped. <words>344</words> The twist tie, the photo, the trap: he’d lured her here to unearth his sister’s bones, to make someone *see*. <words>367</words> The deputy nodded, cautious bravery sealing her voice. <words>378</words> She tossed the doll down, its fall a silent hymn, and watched him cradle it, oil-streaked tears etching his face. <words>402</words>  

In the hive’s dying light, she pocketed the twist tie, its spiral now a bridge between then and now. <words>426</words> Outside, engines roared, time resumed, but for a breath, the orchard had held them both in its teeth—and let go. <words>452</words>
