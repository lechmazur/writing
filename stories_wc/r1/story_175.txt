The mushroom village’s bioluminescent spores dimmed as the aged minstrel limped past, his lute strapped to a back bent by centuries of song. <words>30</words> Clutched in his ink-stained hand swayed an empty birdcage, its brass bars tarnished by the breath of forgotten whispers. <words>53</words> He paused at the crossroads where the Last Dance had once been performed—a ritual abandoned when the elders deemed memory too dangerous to celebrate. <words>83</words> Tonight, the air hummed with feral elegance, a tension between decay and delirium, as if the very mycelium underfoot recoiled from what he sought. <words>113</words>  

“Observe,” he murmured, innocently mischievous, beckoning a cluster of wide-eyed sporelings toward a vintage sign dangling above the apothecary. <words>138</words> Its paint, once vibrant as foxfire, now flaked like lichen—each night, he explained, another chip fell, marking the hours until the village’s protective illusions crumbled entirely. <words>168</words> “See this cerulean sliver?” He plucked a fragment midair, its edges glowing faintly. <words>185</words> “A lie told to soothe your nightmares. And this crimson fleck? A vow to erase what dwells beyond the mist.” <words>209</words>  

The children gasped, but their laughter died as the minstrel’s voice sharpened. <words>223</words> He needed them to understand: the forbidden knowledge he craved wasn’t mere power—it was the truth festering beneath their fairy-ring homes, the reason their ancestors had buried the old gods’ tongues. <words>258</words> The birdcage swung open, though nothing flew out. <words>268</words> “Empty? No,” he chuckled, tapping its hinges. <words>277</words> “It’s full of what your elders caged. Stories. The kind that itch.” <words>293</words>  

A elder hobbled forth, her cap trembling. <words>300</words> “You’ll doom us all, bard!” <words>305</words> He grinned, toothless yet radiant, and strummed a chord that split the twilight. <words>320</words> Fungi retracted; the ground hissed. <words>326</words> Beneath the village square yawned a pit lined with teeth-like roots, clutching a tome bound in moth-wing parchment. <words>347</words> The minstrel’s fingers twitched—not for the book, but for the final paint chip clinging to the sign. <words>368</words>  

“Crumbling illusions reveal more than truth,” he sang, voice fraying like old rope. <words>385</words> “They show *why* we cling to lies.” <words>394</words> As the last chip fell, the tome disintegrated, its ashes swirling into the cage. <words>411</words> The children wept; the elder collapsed. <words>419</words> But the minstrel stood transfixed—the cage now thrummed with a melody only he could hear, a requiem for the tradition they’d lost, and the feral, elegant freedom they’d never admit they desired. <words>460</words>  

When dawn’s spores rose, he was gone, leaving only hoofprints and the hollow cage—its bars singing softly in the wind. <words>483</words>
