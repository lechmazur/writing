The abandoned carnival shooting gallery leaned into the Atlantic wind, its peeling clown murals grinning like skulls as Mara adjusted her diving mask. <words>25</words> Her father had brought her here every summer solstice—a family tradition as rusted as the rifle bolts—to win prizes she’d later toss into shipwrecks, offerings for the drowned. <words>53</words> Now, six years after his death, she’d returned not to mourn, but to pry open the half-written letter he’d left in his desk, its ink smudged beside the words *“between the lines, you’ll—”*. <words>84</words> Mara’s lungs still burned from the morning dive, where she’d whispered to a 19th-century coaler’s ghost, bargaining for relics. <words>104</words> But it was here, ankle-deep in cracked plaster ducks, that she found the amber. <words>119</words>  

Sunlight fractured through the resin, igniting the trapped mayfly’s wings—a relic older than the carnival, older than her father’s obsession with drowning places. <words>143</words> When she pressed it to her palm, the gallery’s broken lights flickered. <words>154</words> A shadow coalesced: her father’s ghost, translucent and brine-dripping, reloading a phantom rifle. <words>168</words> “You missed the bullseye,” he said, joyfully melancholic, as he’d always been when teaching her to map wreck currents. <words>185</words> Mara’s throat tightened. <words>188</words> She’d spent a lifetime astride his legacy, a wreck-diver prodigy praised only as *“Jonas Hale’s girl.”* <words>203</words>  

“Why this place?” she demanded, the amber warming. <words>211</words> The ghost aimed at a tin rabbit. <words>216</words> “You’ll laugh—I proposed to your mother here.” <words>223</words> A firework of memory: her parents dancing between popcorn carts, young and reckless, before grief iced him. <words>241</words> The mayfly twitched in its golden prison. <words>248</words> Mara understood then—the thawing heart wasn’t his, but hers. <words>259</words> She’d frozen herself in his shadow, mistaking duty for desire. <words>270</words>  

The ghost faded, whispering, “Burn the letter.” <words>277</words> Mara struck a match, its flame devouring the page until words bled through the ash: *“—find your own tides.”* <words>292</words> Laughter bubbled up, sharp and fleeting—a rebellion against the daughter she’d been. <words>306</words> She hurled the amber into the shooting gallery. <words>314</words> Glass shattered. <words>316</words>  

Wind howled through the ruins, carrying salt and the mayfly, now alive, its wings beating toward the sea. <words>333</words> Mara left the rifle untouched, walked past the carnival gates, and kept walking until her wetsuit dripped puddles on a bus station floor. <words>352</words> In her pocket, the mayfly’s discarded exoskeleton crumbled—a husk outgrown. <words>365</words> She bought a ticket to Arizona, where ghosts were rare and deserts didn’t drown you in yesterday. <words>381</words>  

On the bus, she wrote a new letter: *“Dad, I’ll miss the wrecks. But I need to miss them to know what else I am.”* <words>401</words> Outside, telephone poles blurred into ship masts, then into cacti. <words>412</words> The thaw ached, glorious. <words>415</words> Somewhere behind her, the carnival collapsed into the dunes, and a father’s ghost smiled as his daughter finally missed the bullseye. <words>434</words> She slept, dreaming not of anchors, but of wings. <words>444</words>
