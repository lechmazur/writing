<story>The monastery hung suspended among the stars, its jagged rock foundations silent as the void between prayers. <words>25</words>  
In the breakroom’s dim glow, where incense ash still swirled from Brother Kael’s abrupt resignation, the swordsman slumped against a stone bench, his blade propped like a scorned companion. <words>54</words>  
He’d come here seven years ago to forget the wars, the blood-oaths, the face of the woman whose name he’d carved into his ribs—a promise to stop carving it into others. <words>83</words>  
The plain cloth bag at his hip held nothing but a child’s wooden top, its paint chipped from decades of fidgeting; a meaningless trinket, he told himself, though his fingers brushed it nightly like a rosary. <words>114</words>  
Apathy had been his armor, his liturgy: meditate, mend robes, ignore the way meteors streaked past the monastery’s windows every equinox, their trails mirroring the scar across his palm. <words>141</words>  
But Kael’s departure had left a crack in the routine. <words>150</words>  
“You’re staying to rot?” Kael had hissed earlier, clutching his resignation scroll like a dagger. <words>166</words>  
“Or are you still waiting for permission to live?” <words>175</words>  
The words clung like nettles. <words>179</words>  
Now, alone, the swordsman unrolled a star chart from the bag, its edges frayed from secret midnight studies. <words>198</words>  
The next meteor shower would crest in an hour—a bridge of light leading to the abandoned lunar forge where he’d once buried a sword stained with his brother’s blood. <words>229</words>  
To overcome the grave, the monks taught, one must first kneel. <words>240</words>  
But the swordsman’s knees had ached too long. <words>247</words>  
Defiance, he realized, wasn’t a scream; it was standing up. <words>258</words>  
He tied the bag to his belt, its weight suddenly deliberate. <words>269</words>  
The monastery’s docking platform bit into his sandals as he stepped into the meteoroids’ path, their light etching his shadow onto the rocks below. <words>295</words>  
Memories surged—his brother’s laugh, the top spinning in mud as steel clashed, the vow to never wield a weapon again unless to bury it. <words>319</words>  
A meteor flared, close enough to singe his sleeve. <words>328</words>  
He leapt. <words>329</words>  
Stone gave way to weightlessness, the monastery shrinking behind him as he rode the celestial current, knees bent like a man both falling and flying. <words>354</words>  
The forge awaited, a jagged crater veiled in comet dust. <words>365</words>  
When his feet struck lunar soil, he exhaled a laugh—raw, unfamiliar. <words>379</words>  
The cloth bag tore as he dug, the top tumbling out, still spinning in the low gravity as if decades hadn’t passed. <words>400</words>  
Beneath the rusted sword, he found his brother’s final letter, sealed with wax he’d been too cowardly to break. <words>420</words>  
The swordsman cracked it open, eyes tracing words meant for a younger self: “Burn the sword. Keep the top. Live.” <words>437</words>  
Above, the meteor shower faded, their defiance spent. <words>445</words>  
He lit the blade with a striker from the bag, watching steel melt into the soil, and pocketed the top—no longer a relic, but a compass. <words>471</words>  
As dawn’s first light breached the crater, he walked away from the ashes, shoulders lighter, toward whatever came next. <words>493</words>  
The promise, finally, was his own. <words>500</words></story>
