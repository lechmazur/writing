<story>The air conditioning hummed like a trapped wasp in the drought prediction center’s sterile lobby, where Elias adjusted his tie—a cautious smuggler’s uniform for blending into bureaucracy.<words>34</words> Behind the reception desk, a pressed butterfly glowed under UV glass, its iridescent wings whispering of jungles drowned by data charts and dehydration algorithms.<words>68</words> “Subject 11’s ready,” a nurse said, her voice flat as drought-cracked earth, and Elias followed, clutching the vial of anesthetic that would unravel the painter’s confession.<words>100</words>  

The painter lay strapped to a gurney, her fingers twitching as if sketching ghosts only she could see.<words>122</words> Elias administered the drug, his meticulously impulsive hands steady—calculated risk was his religion, empathy his unfinished sacrament.<words>146</words> “Tell me about the music,” he murmured, recorder whirring.<words>158</words>  

Her delirium spilled forth: symphonies of rainfall, cello notes syncing with her mother’s ventilator’s hiss, a lullaby hummed while smuggling morphine through checkpoints.<words>184</words> Elias scribbled codes onto his palm, cross-referencing her fragmented melodies with drought forecasts.<words>199</words> Predictions required patterns, and pain had a rhythm even aridity couldn’t silence.<words>215</words>  

“The butterfly,” the painter slurred, pupils dilated.<words>223</words> “She pressed it… the night the reservoirs emptied.<words>233</words> Said its wings knew… how to bend light into water.”<words>244</words> Elias froze.<words>245</words> His own mother’s voice flickered—a half-remembered piano tune, her hands folding origami cranes from drought-warnings.<words>263</words> Empathy wasn’t a skill; it was theft, borrowing others’ fractures to shore up your own.<words>282</words>  

Alarms blared.<words>283</words> A technician burst in: “Category 5 drought incoming—your models predicted it?”<words>295</words> Elias glanced at the painter’s trembling lips, still shaping silent notes.<words>308</words> “No,” he lied.<words>311</words> Her confessions had revealed a worse truth: the center’s algorithms were rigged, droughts manufactured to justify water-hoarding contracts.<words>337</words>  

He pocketed the butterfly case, its wings humming a chromatic scale only he could hear.<words>354</words> Mastery of empathy meant seeing the cracks in every system, the unsung songs in every confession.<words>374</words> Outside, the sky bled orange, and Elias smiled with enthusiastic apathy.<words>391</words> Let them chase storms; he’d trade secrets in minor keys, smuggling truth like contraband water.<words>411</words>  

In his car, he replayed the painter’s tape.<words>420</words> Between static and sobs, a child’s voice sang—his own, forgotten.<words>432</words> The butterfly’s wings caught the sun, refracting a prism across his dashboard: red for drought, blue for memory, gold for every lie he’d yet to unravel.<words>462</words> Elias drove east, where the rainmakers hid, humming a lullaby that could drown empires.<words>482</words>
