The crumpled invitation arrived during baking, its edges singed by the vapor collection facility’s ovens. <words>20</words>  
Lila Vale, professional dream interpreter, peeled it open, her fingers trembling at the glyphs only she could decipher—a plea from the Quiet Pulse, the underground current humming beneath the city’s stone laws. <words>48</words>  
“They’ve calcified again,” muttered her assistant, nodding at the facility’s central chamber, where workers in asbestos gloves scraped dream residue from steaming vents. <words>73</words>  
Lila’s motivation itched: to rewrite those laws, fossilized edicts etched into the bedrock by long-dead legislators. <words>92</words>  
But first, she needed the Pulse’s rhythm—occasionally frequent, like a skipped heartbeat—to destabilize the stone. <words>110</words>  
The invitation demanded impersonation. <words>113</words>  
“Find the architect who vanished here,” it read, “become her, and unseal the chamber.” <words>128</words>  
Lila donned the missing woman’s identity like a second skin, her voice adopting the architect’s documented lisp, her stride mimicking a limp from a decades-old accident report. <words>157</words>  
Guards nodded her through checkpoints, their peculiar faith in bureaucracy blinding them to her stolen cadence. <words>175</words>  
Inside the core, the Pulse’s hum swelled, vibrating the quartz veins in the walls. <words>189</words>  
Lila pressed her palm to the stone, whispering dream-syllables to soften its grip. <words>203</words>  
A valve hissed—revealing the Pulse’s source: a throbbing orb of liquid light, siphoned from collective unconsciousness and distilled into vapor. <words>227</words>  
“They’re baking compliance into the air,” she realized, watching technicians funnel the glow into canisters labeled *Atmospheric Regulations*. <words>247</words>  
Her borrowed identity frayed as the orb brightened, searing her retinas. <words>260</words>  
The architect’s ghostly voice echoed: “Break the cycle.” <words>268</words>  
Lila lunged, spilling a vial of calcification serum into the orb’s containment unit. <words>283</words>  
The light congealed—crystallizing mid-pulse, its rhythm stuttering into silence. <words>296</words>  
Alarms blared; stone laws cracked like overbaked clay. <words>305</words>  
She ran, the facility’s faith in order collapsing as workers stared at the fractured walls. <words>322</words>  
In the chaos, Lila salvaged a shard of the Quiet Pulse, now dormant but malleable—a seed for new laws. <words>342</words>  
Back in her studio, she fed the shard into a dream-incubator, watching it dissolve into vapor. <words>358</words>  
Tomorrow, the city would wake to softer edicts, whispered through vents instead of carved in stone. <words>376</words>  
The architect’s face lingered in her mirror, a phantom smirk. <words>387</words>  
“Occasionally frequent,” Lila reminded herself, scrubbing off the impersonation with solvent. <words>400</words>  
Rebellion, like dreams, required repetition—and the patience to outbake tyranny. <words>413</words>  
She pocketed the crumpled invitation, already sensing the Pulse’s rekindled thrum beneath her feet. <words>429</words>
