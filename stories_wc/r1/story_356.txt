<story>The cargo hold of the *Starjackal* hummed with the dissonance of stolen time—rusted chronometers piled beside glitching holographs, their light pooling like liquid mercury on the floor. <words>40</words> Lysander, the ship’s caretaker, swept a hand through his salt-and-starlight beard, thumbing the chalk stub he’d pocketed from a derelict schoolhouse three galaxies ago. <words>68</words> “Time’s not a river,” he muttered, etching equations onto a bulkhead, “it’s a leaky faucet.” <words>85</words> His tone carried the gentle harshness of a man who’d patched one too many wounds—and paradoxes—with equal parts cynicism and care. <words>105</words>  

The dial tone had stopped precisely 47 seconds ago. <words>113</words> Lysander’s outdated comms phone, salvaged from Earth’s analog corpse, now lay silent on a crate, its abrupt quietude a blade through the hold’s ambient growl. <words>139</words> That tone had been his tether to linearity; without its rasp, the “what ifs” began their siege. <words>156</words> What if he’d never boarded this ship? What if the supernova had taken him? Their siren song threatened to unravel his seams. <words>177</words>  

He squinted at the chalk diagrams—star maps refracted through cloud paths, their ever-shifting vapors charting temporal eddies. <words>196</words> Pirate captains paid well for such navigations, but Lysander hoarded them like sacraments. <words>212</words> “Clouds remember,” he’d explain, warmly aloof as always, to crewmates who asked why he stared at nebula feeds for hours. <words>232</words> Few grasped that he wasn’t reading weather, but time’s own handwriting. <words>245</words>  

The first vanishings were subtle. <words>248</words> A coil of rope frayed midair. <words>253</words> A crate of Venusian wine dissolved into mist. <words>263</words> Lysander pressed his palm to the chalk equations, feeling the *Starjackal*’s timeline shudder—someone was unpicking reality’s stitches. <words>284</words> The “what ifs” crescendoed: *What if you fail?* <words>294</words>  

He lunged for his chalk, redrawing cloud vectors with desperate precision. <words>308</words> Each stroke yanked the ship through temporal crosswinds, away from the siren’s pull. <words>323</words> Cargo flickered between existence and memory—a paradox storm. <words>335</words> Lysander’s fingers bled graphite-blue, his equations now palimpsests over older, darker calculations. <words>351</words>  

When the silence broke, it wasn’t the dial tone that returned. <words>363</words> It was laughter—high, crystalline, and utterly alien. <words>373</words> The chalk snapped in his grip. <words>379</words> “Oh, little caretaker,” crooned the voice from everywhere and never, “you can’t mute a siren by chasing echoes.” <words>400</words>  

Lysander smiled, wry and weary. <words>405</words> He tossed the chalk nub aside. <words>410</words> “Wasn’t chasing,” he said, and stepped into the storm. <words>422</words> The clouds parted. <words>425</words> The ship held. <words>428</words> And Lysander—chalkless, finally—vanished, not into the “what if,” but the “what is.” <words>445</words>  

In the hold, the phone rang once. <words>451</words> No one answered. <words>454</words> Time, after all, had found its new caretaker. <words>464</words></story>
