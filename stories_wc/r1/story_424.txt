The mild zealot adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses, fingertips brushing the frayed edges of a 1923 German Papiermark. <words>25</words> Her collection of foreign paper money sprawled across the oak table in the Strange Attractor Laboratory, a room where rusted copper pipes coiled like serpents beneath vaulted ceilings—a place of rustic refinement, where equations governing chaos hissed from antique radiators. <words>63</words> Outside, the city thrummed between shifting powers; coups simmered in alleys, and the laboratory’s funding hinged on whichever oligarch blinked first. <words>94</words> Yet Sister Therese cared only for the scars of legacy pressed into each banknote: inkblot portraits of fallen kings, watermarks of obsolete constellations. <words>125</words>  

“They’re oddly typical, aren’t they?” murmured Brother Piotr, her collaborator, nodding at the bills. <words>143</words> “Paper, greed, collapse—repeat the cycle.” <words>151</words> But Therese disagreed. <words>154</words> She’d learned to visualize the forgotten wishes embedded in the fibers—the baker’s prayer for bread, the widow’s plea for her conscripted son—each note a fossilized cry. <words>183</words> The laboratory’s attractor arrays, humming with unstable harmonics, allowed her to glimpse them: flickers of lives swallowed by hyperinflation, war, silence. <words>212</words>  

Tonight, she traced a 1946 Hungarian pengő, its surface blotted with tea stains. <words>227</words> The machine shuddered awake, and Therese gasped. <words>235</words> A vision unfurled: a girl in Budapest, scribbling a wish on the banknote before tossing it into the Danube. <words>255</words> *Let them forget me.* <words>259</words> Therese’s hands trembled; the wish wasn’t a plea for salvation, but erasure. <words>276</words> Sacrifice, she realized, wasn’t about martyrdom—it was the choice to dissolve oneself so others might continue. <words>298</words>  

“Why pursue this?” Piotr asked, eyeing the attractor’s spiraling graphs. <words>310</words> Therese hesitated. <words>312</words> Her order had tasked her with preserving histories, but the machine revealed truths that corroded certainty. <words>332</words> Each note’s requiem demanded she confront her own complicity: collecting stories like relics, never letting them rest. <words>353</words>  

When insurgents stormed the city center, the laboratory’s patrons severed ties. <words>368</words> Piotr fled with the gold reserves; Therese remained. <words>378</words> She fed the last banknotes into the attractor, their whispers merging into a deafening hymn. <words>396</words> The machine’s core glowed—a forge of memories. <words>406</words> She stepped inside. <words>409</words>  

Heat seared her palms as she dissolved the collection, each bill unraveling into light. <words>426</words> The scars of legacy weren’t meant to be clutched, she understood now, but released—a surrender to time’s hunger. <words>447</words> When the soldiers barged in, they found only ash swirling in sunbeams, and a single, unmarked coin on the floor. <words>471</words> It bore no face, no nation, only the faintest impression of a river. <words>487</words>  

Outside, the Danube whispered on. <words>492</words>
