The dismayed minstrel plucked a dissonant chord on his lute, its echo swallowed by the black velvet sky-lounge hovering like a drowsy god above the endless city. <words>34</words> His fingers brushed the broken watch band strapped to his wrist—a relic from when time still mattered, before the garden secrets began whispering through the lounge’s floating ivy. <words>68</words> They’d told him to excavate truth, but truth here was a shapeshifter, slipping through cracks in the marble floor where starlight pooled. <words>96</words> So he studied the Polaroids instead: frayed snapshots of the city below, each a puzzle piece in his subjectively rational quest to map the endless night. <words>126</words>  

In one photograph, a lamppost bent like a question mark; in another, a clocktower’s shadow split into six directions. <words>148</words> Boundaries, he realized, weren’t drawn in ink but in the spaces between breaths, between the lounge’s gravity-defying orchids and the city’s neon throbbing. <words>173</words> He sketched lines on vellum, connecting constellations of streetlights, while the garden’s sentient roses hummed a tune that made his ribs ache. <words>198</words> They’d once sung together, he and the roses, before the watch band snapped and the sky-lounge forgot dawn. <words>219</words>  

A Polaroid slipped from his stack, capturing a courtyard he’d never seen—a fractal of iron gates and peacock ferns, bathed in indigo. <words>244</words> His pulse quickened. <words>247</words> This was the key, the garden’s best-kept secret: a place where time coiled like a sleeping serpent, where his map could anchor. <words>272</words> He strummed a minor seventh, and the lounge shuddered, descending through layers of smog toward the city’s hidden heart. <words>296</words>  

The roses hissed warnings as he stepped onto the courtyard’s cobblestones, their perfume sharp with dread. <words>317</words> But the minstrel’s laughter was laconic exuberance, a shield against the void chewing at the edges of his vellum. <words>339</words> He traced the broken watch band’s outline onto the map, a circle neither closed nor open—a boundary that invited paradox. <words>364</words> Here, amid the peacock ferns, he’d plant his flag of silence and starlight. <words>382</words>  

Yet as he sang the final note, the courtyard dissolved, gates melting into smoke. <words>400</words> The Polaroid in his hand blanched, erased by the very night he’d tried to chart. <words>419</words> The minstrel smiled anyway, clutching the empty watch band, for he’d learned the only map worth drawing was the one that vanished as you made it. <words>453</words> Above, the sky-lounge bloomed anew, its ivy spelling a requiem in chlorophyll and shadow. <words>474</words>
