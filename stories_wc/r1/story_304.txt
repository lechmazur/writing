The baroque asteroid hung in the void like a jeweled pendant, its spiraling towers and gilded arches glinting with borrowed starlight. <words>28</words> Here, where gravity was a negotiable concept, the assassin moved through shadows, their boots magnetized to the cobbled streets that curved upward into impossible geometries. <words>58</words> Their target: the bus driver who, in three hours, would complete the final route—a circuit weaving through the asteroid’s hollow core to the surface where dawn perpetually trembled. <words>89</words> The assassin’s fingers brushed the paint-splattered camera lens hanging from their neck, its fractures mapping constellations only they could decipher. <words>112</words> Each splash of color was a coordinates, each crack a life erased; the device was superficially profound, a poet’s tool turned ledger of debts. <words>135</words>  

Rain began—a fine mist condensing on the asteroid’s artificial atmosphere—as the assassin crouched beneath a gargoyle, watching the spider’s web strung between stone petals glisten. <words>164</words> Its radial symmetry mirrored their own plan: every silken thread a step toward the driver’s seat, every dewdrop a variable counted. <words>184</words> The unforgiving road awaited, a ribbon of fused quartz winding through the asteroid’s heart, where a single misstep would send the bus careening into abyssal gardens. <words>212</words>  

They boarded at the third stop, sliding into a seat behind the driver—a woman humming a lullaby, her gloved hands steady on the wheel. <words>235</words> The assassin’s lens caught her reflection: eyes like twin novas, pupils dilated by decades of navigating starlit tunnels. <words>256</words> “You cradle the dawn every morning,” they said, voice a serrated whisper. <words>269</words> “Must be heavy.” <words>273</words>  

The driver laughed, a sound like shattering chandeliers. <words>281</words> “Dawn’s not a child. It’s a knife.” <words>288</words> She adjusted the rearview mirror, her gaze slicing through the assassin’s guise. <words>303</words> “You’re here to stop me from retiring, eh? From letting the bus plunge?” <words>319</words>  

The assassin froze. <words>321</words> Their plan—via the pattern of the web—had accounted for everything but this: a driver who *wanted* to die. <words>341</words> The bus lurched into motion, quartz road unfurling as the spider’s silk had, precise and lethal. <words>360</words> Passengers clung to velvet straps, unaware of the script unraveling. <words>374</words>  

“Why?” the assassin demanded, gripping the lens until its edges drew blood. <words>388</words>  

“You ever carry light so long it burns through your bones?” The driver smiled, veering toward a hairpin turn. <words>408</words> “I’m tired of being a lantern.” <words>415</words>  

In the final tunnel, the assassin lunged, not with a blade, but with the camera. <words>430</words> The flash erupted—a captured dawn—blinding the driver as the bus skidded. <words>444</words> Metal screamed; the web of fate snapped. <words>452</words>  

When the dust settled, the assassin knelt, trembling hands cradling the driver’s head. <words>467</words> Through the cracked lens, dawn’s first rays fractured into a thousand stars, borrowed and fleeting. <words>485</words> Above them, the spider’s web shimmered, intact. <words>494</words>  

The driver laughed again, softer now. <words>500</words>
