<story>  
The tidal island emerged each dawn like a half-submerged secret, its causeway swallowed by the hungry sea, leaving the frail guard stranded atop lichen-crusted stones. <words>27</words>  
His fingers trembled around the sour-smelling alchemy phial, its fumes etching his throat as he traced the messages carved into the oak’s bark—a lattice of symbols only decipherable throughout sorting the island’s shifting tides. <words>58</words>  
They spoke of painted allegiances: a rebel’s dagger inked beside the king’s crown, both blurred by salt and time. <words>75</words>  
“Resolutely wavering,” the guard muttered, his voice as brittle as his bones, for the phrase described both the oak’s fading marks and his own heart. <words>95</words>  
He had once sworn to protect this barren rock, this prison of waves, yet now he yearned to yank himself free from the fate etched into his blood—a lineage of guards doomed to drown with their posts. <words>123</words>  

The phial’s liquid hissed when spilled onto the oak, dissolving a patch of bark to reveal a map of currents. <words>141</words>  
Someone, perhaps another doomed soul, had left instructions for escape. <words>151</words>  
Hope fluttered in his chest, thin and desperate as a moth in a storm. <words>163</words>  
But allegiance demanded ambiguity; to flee was to betray the crown, yet to stay was to betray himself. <words>179</words>  
The tide would return at dusk, and with it, the royal inspector—a man who’d notice the missing phial, the altered carvings. <words>197</words>  

Rain began its lament as the guard crouched in a sea-cave, clutching the empty phial. <words>211</words>  
Saltwater pooled around his boots, whispering of finality. <words>219</words>  
He had followed the map’s zigzag path, memorized the rhythm of safe currents, yet hesitated at the cave’s mouth. <words>236</words>  
Predetermined fate was a chain, but freedom required a leap into the unknown’s maw. <words>250</words>  
When the inspector’s horn echoed across the waves, the guard yanked a rusted anchor chain from the rocks, its groan lost in the wind. <words>270</words>  

The chain led underwater, hand over hand, into the dark. <words>280</words>  
His arms screamed, his breath frayed, but the carvings had promised this: a smuggler’s tunnel beneath the island, a road to a life unpainted. <words>299</words>  
Allegiances, he realized, were choices made in motion, not symbols frozen in bark. <words>313</words>  
As the tunnel’s airless silence pressed in, he laughed—a sound like breaking glass—and inched forward. <words>330</words>  
Above, the inspector would find only a phial and a map, evidence of a soul neither traitor nor hero, but human. <words>348</words>  

Dawn found him on a distant shore, lungs burning, salt crusting his lashes. <words>360</words>  
The tidal island now loomed small on the horizon, its oak a speck. <words>371</words>  
He had escaped the script of his birth, yet carried its weight like a shadow. <words>384</words>  
In his pocket, a sliver of bark bore a new carving: a wave erasing a crown. <words>398</words>  
The guard—no, the man—turned inland, where the scent of pine, not brine, hung heavy, and melancholy ceded, inch by inch, to hope. <words>420</words>

He walked until his legs buckled, until the island’s whispers faded, until the phial’s sour stench was replaced by earth and rain. <words>441</words>  
Somewhere ahead, a village chimney smoked. <words>446</words>  
He would never know if the tunnel’s architect had survived their own escape, but in that smoke, he saw a question—not an answer—and found it enough. <words>469</words>
