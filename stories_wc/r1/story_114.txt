The apathetic summoner yawned, stirring the dust motes in the shared dream recording studio, her fingers trailing over the rustic coffee grinder she’d inherited from a grandmother who’d whispered river wisdom into tides. <words>37</words>  
“Enthusiastically lazy,” the studio’s spectral curator had once called her—a label she embraced, since rebuilding coral reefs required patience, not haste, especially after the last breath of a dying god had bleached the oceans into silence. <words>78</words>  
The studio itself was a labyrinth of hollow echoes, its walls lined with matching empty frames that once held collective memories of thriving seas. <words>104</words> Now, they hung like skeletal leaves in a deserted hall, waiting to unfold. <words>117</words>  
She cranked the grinder, its coarse whir harmonizing with the drip of phantom waves—each rotation pulverizing dried kelp and stardust into a bitter incense. <words>141</words> Smoke curled into the frames, coaxing them to life. <words>151</words> One by one, they flickered with visions: polyps blooming, parrotfish weaving through azure, a god’s final sigh rippling as a current. <words>175</words>  
“River wisdom,” she muttered, recalling her grandmother’s lesson—that water remembers even when land forgets. <words>192</words> The frames weren’t empty; they were sieves, straining time for echoes of vitality. <words>206</words> Her apathy was a shield, of course. <words>212</words> To care too much was to drown in the futility of stitching life back into a corpse. <words>227</words>  
Yet here she was, grinding, always grinding, because the reefs deserved more than elegy. <words>243</words> The curator materialized, a wisp of disapproval. <words>251</words> “You’re using the frames backward,” it hissed. <words>258</words> “They’re meant to capture dreams, not regurgitate them.” <words>267</words>  
She shrugged. <words>268</words> “Regurgitation’s underrated. <words>271</words> Fish do it to build islands.” <words>276</words> Besides, the dying god’s breath had left a vacuum—an absence only absence could fill. <words>293</words> The frames needed to mirror the hollows before new growth could climb. <words>307</words>  
As the incense thickened, the visions sharpened. <words>314</words> Coral skeletons materialized in the studio’s center, their limestone fingers reaching. <words>326</words> She exhaled, and the smoke bent, weaving through the bones like a possessive ghost. <words>341</words> The curator scoffed but lingered, its form rippling with reluctant intrigue. <words>353</words>  
“Gentle sharpness,” the summoner mused, a phrase her grandmother used for the way rivers carve canyons without raising their voices. <words>371</words> She poured the grinder’s contents into a frame, and the powder cascaded as sand, as substrate, as a beginning. <words>389</words> The studio trembled, frames humming in dissonant chords until—click. <words>401</words>  
A single polyp anchored itself in the dreamscape. <words>409</words> Then another. <words>410</words> The summoner smiled, small and weary, as the reefs unfolded in reverse: death birthing blueprint, blueprint birthing breath. <words>430</words> It wasn’t zeal that fueled her, but the quiet certainty of tides—that even apathy could erode, could reshape, could, in time, become a kind of faith. <words>457</words>  
The curator, now silent, watched the frames fill with the living hues of a world stubborn enough to regrow its skin. <words>477</words> Outside the studio, in the waking dark, the first coral larvae split the seafloor, their tiny mouths hungry for light. <words>500</words>
