The abandoned carnival ticket booth stood crooked under a moonless sky, its peeling paint whispering of cotton candy ghosts and laughter long devoured by silence. <words>27</words> Inside, the gloomy barkeep polished a cracked tumbler, his movements syncopated with the drone of something distant, mechanical, and wrong. <words>47</words> He’d turned the booth into a refuge for strays—not the four-legged kind, but those who’d slipped through the cracks of transient realities, their eyes flickering between dimensions like faulty neon. <words>76</words>  

A man in a moth-eaten trench coat stumbled in, clutching a worn wallet like a holy relic. <words>92</words> “Whiskey,” he rasped, sliding a coin stamped with a forgotten king’s face across the counter. <words>107</words> The barkeep smirked, abrasively charming as a rusted switchblade. <words>117</words> “That’ll buy you a prayer, not a drink.” <words>125</words>  

Outside, the broken payphone booth shuddered, its receiver dangling mid-confession. <words>136</words> The barkeep had overheard secrets there for years—how the carnival’s midnight had once swallowed the sun, how the light’s absence left pockets where time curdled. <words>158</words> He’d stopped believing in solutions until the drone’s hum sharpened last week, vibrating his bones like a tuning fork. <words>176</words>  

The trench-coated man leaned closer. <words>180</words> “They say you find things.” <words>185</words> He flipped open the wallet, revealing a photo half-eaten by static. <words>197</words> “My daughter. She’s in the… *between*.” <words>205</words>  

The barkeep’s thumb brushed the wallet’s frayed edge, feeling the sticky residue of crossed realities. <words>219</words> “You’re chasing ghosts.” <words>223</words>  

“No,” the man hissed. <words>225</words> “You’re chasing *light*.” <words>229</words>  

The drone’s pitch shifted—a predator’s purr. <words>234</words> Through the ticket booth’s grimy window, a shape emerged: a obsidian drone, its wings serrated like betrayal, hovering where the carousel once spun. <words>257</words> The barkeep’s throat tightened. <words>261</words> Midnight had teeth, and it had stolen more than light—it had taken his reflection, leaving him a silhouette with a voice. <words>280</words>  

“The payphone,” the barkeep muttered. <words>284</words> “You heard her there, didn’t you? In the confessions.” <words>295</words>  

The man nodded. <words>296</words>  

They moved at the hush-hour of truces, when enemies share breath but not glances. <words>310</words> The drone pivoted, lens focusing on the wallet’s photo. <words>320</words> Static crackled—the girl’s face flickered into clarity, mouthing *help*. <words>331</words>  

“Distract it,” the barkeep ordered, snatching a bottle of absinthe from beneath the counter. <words>345</words> He’d learned long ago: in transient realities, poison could be a key. <words>357</words>  

The man lunged, shouting his daughter’s name—*Elara*—as the drone lunged, slicing his cheek. <words>372</words> The barkeep hurled the bottle. <words>377</words> It shattered against the machine, releasing emerald flames that licked at the artificial night. <words>393</words>  

For a heartbeat, the carnival flickered—golden, sunlit, real. <words>403</words> The booth’s ticket window gleamed; the payphone rang with unclaimed joy. <words>415</words> The barkeep glimpsed his reflection in the drone’s fractured lens—not a shadow, but a man, holding a wallet glowing like a tiny dawn. <words>438</words>  

When the fire died, the drone was gone. <words>445</words> So was the man. <words>448</words>  

But on the counter lay the open wallet, the photo now static-free—a girl laughing in sunlight, her hand clasping someone just out of frame. <words>473</words> The barkeep smiled, enigmatic familiarity warming his gloom. <words>483</words> Somewhere, a truce had held. <words>488</words> Somewhere, midnight bled. <words>492</words>
