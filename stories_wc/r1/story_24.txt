<story>  
The meandering bard shuffled through the labyrinthine bookstore, his boots whispering against spiraling staircases carved into the mountain’s granite heart. <words>27</words>  
He carried a velvet pouch containing dentures rumored to have once clenched the tongue of a revolutionary poet—a relic he’d bartered for with three ballads and a vial of starlight. <words>57</words>  
“Ordinarily extraordinary,” he muttered, tracing the yellowed teeth, their grooves humming with the ghost of speeches that had once set cities ablaze. <words>84</words>  
His purpose coiled tighter than the bookstore’s tangled corridors: to stir hearts grown cold, one subversive puppet show at a time. <words>106</words>  

Tonight’s stage was The Rusted Quill, a seedy bar nestled in the mountain’s shadow where patrons nursed regrets like cheap ale. <words>130</words>  
Between the clink of glasses and the lull before an apologetic text was sent—that fragile silence where “sorry” hovers unsent—the bard unspooled his puppets. <words>156</words>  
A fox with ember eyes, a clockwork judge, and a queen woven from moth-eaten tapestries danced across the counter, their shadows writhing like confessed sins. <words>182</words>  
The dentures, wired into the fox’s jaw, clacked verses that made the air shimmer, radiating warmth into the bar’s frostbitten corners. <words>204</words>  

“Once,” crooned the bard, “there was a mountain that ate its own echoes, until a fool planted laughter in its cracks.” <words>227</words>  
His fingers flicked; the fox spat seeds into the puppet-soil, each one sprouting into paper flowers inked with forbidden epics. <words>248</words>  
A dockworker in the front row, nursing a whiskey and a draft apology to his daughter, felt his throat crack open—a sapling pushing through concrete. <words>275</words>  

The story twisted, as all fractured idylls must. <words>282</words>  
The clockwork judge declared laughter a crime, the queen’s tapestry unraveled to reveal a hollow throne, and the fox’s dentures rusted mid-syllable. <words>306</words>  
Yet the warmth lingered, seeping into calloused palms and folded arms. <words>322</words>  
When the dockworker finally pressed “send,” his message read: “Remember the tale where the thief stole moonlight? Let’s find some.” <words>346</words>  

By dawn, the bard was already ascending the mountain, dentures tucked away, his pockets full of whispers exchanged for stale bread. <words>370</words>  
In the bookstore’s uppermost chamber, where novels grew roots into the rock, he sowed the night’s leftover seeds—stories waiting to erupt through the mountain’s skin. <words>399</words>  
Below, the city exhaled, its frost thawing into something tremulous, alive. <words>414</words>  
The bard smiled. Ordinary work for ordinary teeth; extraordinary how a cracked thing could still hold light. <words>436</words>
