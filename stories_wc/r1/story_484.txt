The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, clutching a piece of a broken mirror like a talisman against the encroaching darkness. <words>25</words> His boots crunched over frostbitten grass as distant chants from the protest’s temporary hush swelled anew, voices threading through skeletal trees like a discordant hymn. <words>50</words> The mansion loomed ahead, its spiral staircase—dusty and warped—coiling upward, each step marked by the slightest discoloration, a trail of faint bruises on wood. <words>77</words> “Uniquely generic, my arse,” he muttered, recalling the cryptic note that had lured him here, its irony as thick as the grave-mist clinging to his coat. <words>100</words>  

He’d spent years brewing resilience into ale, fermenting defiance in oak barrels, but tonight demanded more than metaphor. <words>119</words> The mirror shard bit his palm; its jagged edge held a reflection that wasn’t his own—a smudged face, gaunt and hungry, mouthing words lost to the wind. <words>142</words> “Initiate,” it seemed to say, or maybe “incinerate.” The brewer’s laugh rasped, flippant yet grim, as he placed one foot on the staircase. <words>164</words>  

The discolored steps whispered under his weight, each hue shifting—mold-green to blood-rust—as if the wood itself were a ledger of sins. <words>186</words> Halfway up, the air thickened, the darkness pooling like ink in a well, and the protest’s distant fury faded, replaced by a silence that prickled. <words>207</words> The mirror shard glinted, casting fractured light onto the wall, where shadows writhed into shapes: hands, teeth, eyes that blinked too slowly. <words>230</words>  

“Living embodiment of one’s values,” the brewer scoffed, though his chest tightened. <words>241</words> He’d preached authenticity between pints, but this? This was a throat raw from screaming into voids. <words>257</words> Another step. The staircase shuddered. The mirror’s face reappeared, clearer now—a woman, her lips split into a smile like a crack in ice. <words>280</words> “You’re late,” she hissed, her voice the scrape of a coffin lid. <words>291</words>  

The brewer halted. “Fashionably.” He twirled the shard, its edge catching the protest’s resurrected cries as they breached the mansion walls. <words>308</words> The darkness surged, tendrils snaking toward his ankles, but the mirror’s light flared—a feeble sunbeam in a storm. <words>327</words> “Why me?” he demanded, less to the specter than to the absurdity of it all: a brewer-turned-savior, armed with glass and gall. <words>347</words>  

“Because you see,” the woman said, her image flickering. <words>354</words> “Even in a broken thing.” The staircase groaned, steps splintering as the discoloration deepened, spreading like infection. <words>372</words> The brewer gripped the shard tighter, its reflection now showing not the woman, not himself, but the protest outside—faces gaunt yet blazing, their resolve a flame in the creeping void. <words>400</words>  

He understood then. Not a hero, but a prism. <words>407</words> A conduit. The shard wasn’t a weapon—it was a lens. <words>417</words> With a roar half-laugh, half-snarl, he slammed the mirror into the staircase’s heart, its cracks spiderwebbing through the wood. <words>437</words> Light erupted, not blinding but clarifying, etching every protestor’s face into the walls, their voices now bricks in the mansion’s crumbling bones. <words>459</words>  

The darkness recoiled. The brewer collapsed, gasping, as the spiral staircase dissolved into ash, taking the specter’s smirk with it. <words>478</words> Dawn bled through shattered windows, and the graveyard lay quiet, the protest’s fervor spent but not extinguished. <words>495</words> He stood, pocketing the mirror’s last sliver, and trudged toward the sunrise, the weight of living no longer a burden but a brew left to age. <words>520</words>
