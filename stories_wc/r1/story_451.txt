Beneath the striped awnings of the farmers market, where the scent of overripe peaches clashed with diesel fumes, Leo clutched the baseball—its leather scarred by a signature that shouldn’t exist. <words>34</words> The name etched into it, “Elias Vorne, 2147,” had been verified by three historians, two physicists, and a trembling astrophysicist who’d whispered, “Forbidden knowledge bleeds through this.” <words>74</words> Leo’s twin, Lila, had left it in their shared childhood locker a decade ago, minutes before she vanished—along with every record of her existence. <words>106</words>  

He’d hired actors since: strangers to play their parents, their teachers, even a girl with Lila’s birthmark, hoping repetition might resurrect the truth. <words>134</words> But today, a note slipped into his coat pocket between heirloom tomatoes and honey stalls: *Sunset. Mount Aethon’s northern cleft. Come alone.* <words>163</words> The paper dissolved an hour later, leaving only the taste of saltpeter. <words>177</words>  

The mountain’s peak pierced the clouds like a shattered bone, its shadows sharp as glass in the dying light. <words>197</words> In the hidden crevice, a figure waited, face obscured by a hooded cloak woven with threads that shimmered like trapped starlight. <words>220</words> “You brought it,” the stranger said, voice echoing as if through water. <words>233</words> Leo tightened his grip on the baseball. <words>240</words> “Where’s Lila?” <words>243</words>  

“She’s why you’re here,” they replied, withdrawing a vial of liquid mercury that writhed like a living thing. <words>263</words> “The prophecy demands a twin’s sacrifice to fracture time. Lila chose you to outlive it.” <words>281</words> Leo’s throat tightened. <words>284</words> Memories flickered—Lila sobbing over a dream of cities dissolving into ash, her obsession with Elias Vorne’s journals. <words>304</words>  

The stranger lunged, mercury snaking toward Leo’s wrist. <words>314</words> He swung the baseball, its stitches glowing blue upon contact, and the substance recoiled. <words>330</words> They grappled, the stranger’s strength inhuman, until Leo jammed the ball into their ribs, triggering a burst of light. <words>351</words> The hood fell back, revealing Lila’s face—older, gaunt, one eye replaced by a mechanical orb. <words>369</words>  

“You… subdued him?” she rasped, gesturing to the unconscious stranger. <words>381</words> “He’s a guardian of the timeline. The knowledge in that signature—it’s a map to reset the world.” <words>399</words> She pressed the baseball into his hands, her touch freezing. <words>412</words> “Avert the prophecy. Burn everything but this.” <words>422</words>  

As she vanished into the crystalline shadows, Leo understood: the actors, the market, even their separation—all threads Lila had woven to deliver this typically unique artifact into the one moment it could alter. <words>458</words> The apocalypse hinged on a twin’s love, a time traveler’s mistake, and a boy who’d never learned to throw a curveball. <words>480</words> He descended the mountain, the signed baseball humming with futures yet unbroken. <words>497</words>
