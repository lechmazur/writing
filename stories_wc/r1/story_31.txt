The neon sprawl of New Arcadia pulsed below, but atop the Skythrone Tower, the solemn orchardist Kael knelt among bioluminescent peach trees, their roots threaded through a cyberpunk city rooftop garden’s steel mesh. <words>40</words>  
He’d built this sanctuary to outgrow the void left by his daughter—a ghost in corporate census logs, x-ed out by a syndicate’s data-scythe. <words>68</words>  
Tonight, a thieving silhouette darted between hydroponic troughs: Lira, the 12-year-old gutter-tech scavenger who’d been “borrowing” his tools every third dusk, her presence endearingly irritating, like a persistent glitch reframing a sterile code. <words>108</words>  
“Still trying to graft empathy into those peaches, old man?” she taunted, clutching a plain key plundered from his shed—its teeth mirroring the one around his neck. <words>134</words>  
Kael’s breath hitched; that key had once accessed his daughter’s neural archive, now a relic in a city where memories were corporate plunder. <words>158</words>  
“You don’t understand what you’re holding,” he said, voice a frayed cable sparking static. <words>174</words>  
Lira rolled her eyes, the rooftop’s holographic fireflies glinting off her grime-smudged cheek. <words>189</words>  
“It’s just a dumb key. Probably unlocks some decrepit server farm.” <words>201</words>  
But when she inserted it into the garden’s weather-control terminal—a machine Kael had avoided for a decade—the rooftop shuddered, revealing a hologram of his daughter’s last message, buried like a seed in the code. <words>240</words>  
“You’re her, aren’t you?” Lira whispered, the realization a synapse firing through interconnected lives. <words>256</words>  
Corporations had x-ed out the girl, but Kael had spliced her consciousness into the garden’s ecosystem—a ghost orchard sustained by stolen rain. <words>277</words>  
Now the syndicate’s drones swarmed upward, alerted by the terminal’s activation, their targeting lasers slicing through mist. <words>295</words>  
Lira gripped the key tighter. <words>300</words>  
“I can reboot her into the city’s core mainframe—give her roots somewhere they can’t be erased.” <words>319</words>  
Kael hesitated, the gardener in him fearing the storm required for growth. <words>331</words>  
But Lira was already sprinting through the peach grove, her laugh a firewall against the drones’ sirens. <words>348</words>  
In the hush between two heartbeats, as Kael’s pulse synced with the flicker of the hologram, he chose connection over control. <words>369</words>  
He hurled his key into Lira’s palm, the two halves fusing—a cipher only the overlooked could wield. <words>387</words>  
The garden erupted in a tempest of petals and code, Lira’s fingers dancing across terminals as she wove the orphaned AI through back-alley servers and forgotten archives. <words>413</words>  
When the drones breached the rooftop, they found only peaches rotting quietly on the vine, their data-cores hollowed out, while somewhere deeper in New Arcadia’s circuitry, a child’s laugh took root, unerasable, irrepressible, alive. <words>450</words>  
Kael smiled, tasting rain he hadn’t programmed, as the city’s heart beat once more. <words>463</words>
