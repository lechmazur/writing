The nostalgic tailor stood on the steampunk observation deck, his calloused fingers brushing the dusty mirror’s gilded frame as thunder growled like a caged beast. <words>34</words>  
He’d waited decades for this moment—after the last code was broken, after the gears of fate finally clicked into place. <words>57</words>  
The mirror, salvaged from a derelict airship, hummed with latent energy, its surface rippling to reveal not reflections, but parallel lives: versions of himself stitching constellations into coats, bargaining with clockwork phantoms, weeping over a daughter who’d never existed here. <words>99</words>  
“It’s time,” whispered Elara, his apprentice, her voice barely audible over the storm’s rising howl. <words>116</words>  
Lightning fractured the sky, and the mirror’s glass darkened, swallowing the room until only the tailor’s trembling breath remained. <words>135</words>  
A face emerged—his own, but younger, fiercer, speaking in a language of shattered syntax. <words>147</words>  
“You think ascension is freedom?” the reflection sneered, its words syncopated by static. <words>158</words>  
“It’s a cage of your own making.” <words>164</words>  
The tailor gripped his shears, the tools he’d once used to mend more than fabric. <words>177</words>  
Memories surged: a wife lost to fever, a rebellion quashed by iron automatons, the night he’d stitched his grief into the lining of a stranger’s coat. <words>196</words>  
“Why show me this?” he demanded, though he knew—storms always dredged truths too raw for daylight. <words>211</words>  
The mirror pulsed, and another figure materialized: Elara, but older, her eyes hollowed by choices he’d yet to make. <words>227</words>  
“You let her die,” she hissed, her accusation a serrated edge. <words>237</words>  
The real Elara stepped closer, her hand brushing his sleeve. <words>245</words>  
“It’s not me,” she said, though doubt frayed her words. <words>254</words>  
The tailor’s resolve wavered; the mirror’s visions were a labyrinth with no exit, each turn revealing another failure, another life where he’d faltered. <words>274</words>  
Yet beneath the dread bloomed a desperate hope—if infinite versions existed, surely one had transcended mortality’s shackles. <words>291</words>  
“We continue,” he declared, adjusting the dials on the observation deck’s central console. <words>302</words>  
Cogs whirred, steam hissed, and the mirror’s glass began to crack. <words>311</words>  
A thousand whispers spilled through the fissures, voices of selves who’d dared the same: “Turn back.” “They’re lying.” “She’s already gone.” <words>330</words>  
Elara screamed as the deck shuddered, but the tailor gripped her shoulders, his voice a needle threading chaos into order. <words>346</words>  
“Listen,” he said, steadying her. <words>350</words>  
“These are confessions, not prophecies—fears given shape by the storm.” <words>361</words>  
He pointed to the mirror’s heart, where a single version of himself stood bathed in starlight, unbound and unbroken. <words>378</words>  
“That’s the truth we seize.” <words>383</words>  
The deck groaned, metal tendons snapping as the mirror exploded into shards. <words>394</words>  
But where glass should have fallen, light remained—a luminous thread spooling upward, piercing the clouds. <words>409</words>  
The tailor smiled, bloody and triumphant, as the beam enveloped them. <words>419</words>  
Somewhere, in a life unshackled from time, he was already flying. <words>429</words>
