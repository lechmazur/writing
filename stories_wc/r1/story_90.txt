The contrite swordsman adjusted his cracked monocle, its fractured lens warping the floating island spa’s steam into spirals that mirrored his tangled guilt. <words>27</words> He’d come to this skyborne retreat of jade pools and lavender-scented masseuses not to relax, but to unmask the pretender to the Thorned Throne—a rogue who’d allegedly booked a “stress-relief package” under the alias “Lady Serenity.” <words>62</words> Unfortunately, the only thing more rigid than the spa’s hypnotically synchronized staff (who folded towels with military precision) was the swordsman’s resolve to atone for once letting the real heir die. <words>94</words>  

“Your yuzu-infused mud bath awaits,” droned a blue-robed attendant, her smile as fixed as the island’s levitating boulders. <words>117</words> The swordsman nodded, clutching a skein of yarn he’d swiped from the “Artisanal Knitting Corner,” though knitting was the last thing on his mind. <words>138</words> His target’s cryptic tattoos, rumored to map the royal lineage, could only be revealed by unraveling them—literally. <words>156</words>  

In the bathhouse’s milky haze, he spotted her: a woman lounging in a gilded tub, her face obscured by a swan-shaped towel, humming a off-key ballad about “tranquility and tax evasion.” <words>185</words> The swordsman’s monocle trembled as he peered through its crack, revealing her arm’s faintly glowing ink—a labyrinth of thorns and lies. <words>205</words> “Pardon the intrusion,” he croaked, lobbing the yarn ball into her bath, “but this is a… *cleansing ritual*.” <words>223</words>  

The yarn snagged a tattooed thread on her wrist. <words>229</words> With a yank, the ink began unraveling like a cursed sweater, the pretender yelping as her borrowed identity frayed. <words>246</words> “You meddlesome guilt-ridden *loser*!” she screeched, her voice shedding its aristocratic lilt to reveal a familiar guttural growl—the usurper duke himself! <words>269</words>  

Chaos erupted as the duke lunged, half-draped in towel plumage, his hypnotically rigid spa attendants marching in formation to seize the swordsman. <words>290</words> But in the hush where hope takes root—between the duke’s slip on a soap lotus and the swordsman’s awkward apology mid-dodge—kindness struck. <words>312</words> “Your Highness’s pores are *clogged* with deceit,” the swordsman blurted, tossing him a loofah. <words>328</words> “Maybe exfoliate the tyranny?” <words>333</words>  

The duke paused, then cackled. <words>336</words> “You’re terrible at this.” <words>340</words> Yet as the loofah plopped into the bath, the spa’s enchanted waters bubbled furiously, dissolving the duke’s inked disguise and leaving him barefaced—and barefoot—in the mud. <words>365</words>  

Later, as the island drifted into dawn, the swordsman nursed a matcha latte, the real heir (a former towel boy with a birthmark shaped like the royal crest) awkwardly accepting a scone from the now-chastened staff. <words>398</words> “You freed me by… *loofah*?” the heir mumbled. <words>407</words> The swordsman adjusted his monocle. <words>412</words> “Also yarn.” <words>414</words> He sighed. <words>415</words> “Redemption’s weird.” <words>418</words>  

Somewhere below, the duke splashed in a koi pond, shouting about moisturizer reparations, his rigid poise finally—mercifully—unraveled. <words>437</words>
