The exorcist’s hands trembled as they hovered over the half-assembled toy starship, its plastic hull streaked with orbital debris—flecks of paint mimicking the celestial graveyard outside the station’s viewports. <words>34</words>  
Stage fright had always been their curse, a cruel joke for someone who communed with voids louder than sermons, but today, amid the whir of toy assembly drones, the silence felt heavier. <words>72</words>  
They glanced at the pressed wildflowers tucked beneath the workbench, petals brittle as ancestral promises; their grandmother had called them a “legacy,” but the exorcist knew better—it was an inheritance of lies, a bloodline’s worth of pretending the dead stayed gone. <words>114</words>  
The key turned in the airlock behind them, a sound as sharp as a snapped bone, and the room plunged into a defiant hush. <words>137</words>  
No one should’ve been able to enter—not here, not now, not while the station’s AI murmured lullabies to the crèche of sleeping children below. <words>162</words>  
Yet the air thickened, and the exorcist’s pulse echoed the arrhythmic clatter of toy gears spilling across the floor. <words>181</words>  
“You’re never usual, are you?” whispered a voice that wasn’t a voice, its timbre the scrape of metal on teeth. <words>200</words>  
The thing wore their mother’s face, but its edges blurred like ink in water, and the exorcist recoiled, knocking over a vial of stardust adhesive. <words>223</words>  
Memories surged: Mother’s hands guiding theirs, pressing flowers into books, saying, “Ghosts hate pretty things,” while the real lesson festered—how to bury truth in beauty. <words>249</words>  
The possessed toy starship shuddered, its engines glowing a sickly green, and the exorcist lunged, gripping its hull as the entity’s laughter unspooled. <words>272</words>  
“You’ll submerge,” it hissed, “like she did.” <words>280</words>  
The station’s gravity faltered, and suddenly they were falling—not downward, but *inward*, through layers of falsehoods: Grandmother burning journals, Mother swallowing screams, the exorcist themself choking on stage fright as a congregation of specters leered. <words>320</words>  
But in the depths, they grasped the wildflowers, now glowing like neutron stars. <words>333</words>  
Each petal was a lie, yes—but lies could be sculpted too. <words>345</words>  
The exorcist tore a handful of petals, scattering them into the abyss, and whispered, “You want inheritance? Here’s possibility.” <words>364</words>  
The flowers ignited, weaving a lattice of light that seared the entity’s borrowed face away. <words>381</words>  
The starship’s engines stuttered, then stilled. <words>388</words>  
When gravity returned, the exorcist lay amid plastic shrapnel and melted gears, their throat raw, but the airlock sealed shut—no key, no intruder, only the faint scent of lavender. <words>417</words>  
They crawled to the workbench, reassembling the starship with trembling hands, and slotted a single pressed flower into its core. <words>438</words>  
Tomorrow, the crèche children would launch their toys into the debris field, little arks carrying ghosts turned to seeds. <words>458</words>  
And the exorcist, still shaking, would teach them: even “never” could bloom. <words>474</words>
