<story>  
The astronomer traced constellations on frost-rimed glass, her breath fogging the names of dead stars. <words>24</words>  
Beyond the lighthouse orchard, ice floes groaned like jilted lovers, their fractures echoing the splintered sky. <words>45</words>  
She wore the tattered wedding veil out of habit now, its lace snagged by decades of wind and what remained of her shame. <words>68</words>  
Emotions had faded from the world, but memory lingered—sharp as the prismatic edges of the idol she’d sworn to destroy. <words>89</words>  

The orchard’s trees, gnarled and silver-barked, bore fruit that glowed with rationally organic light, their roots fed by algorithms instead of soil. <words>115</words>  
To cultivate them, she’d learned to read the snowflakes: each hexagonal pattern a cipher for growth, each dendritic arm a map to balance entropy and order. <words>140</words>  
Tonight, the flakes fell in spirals, whispering of a storm that could bury the idol’s frozen shrine—or bury her. <words>161</words>  

The idol stood half a mile north, its face carved from collective fear, its eyes hollowed by those who’d prayed to it before feeling ceased. <words>189</words>  
It demanded silence, stasis, the suffocation of curiosity beneath ice. <words>200</words>  
But the veil itched against her scalp, a relic of another life’s vows broken, and the orchard hummed with forbidden calculus. <words>222</words>  

She plucked a fruit, its skin cool and translucent, and split it open. <words>234</words>  
Seeds spilled like frozen tears, each containing a shard of the moral dilemma she’d avoided for years: to preserve the fragile equilibrium or ignite chaos to topple tyranny. <words>265</words>  
The snow quickened, patterning her sleeves with recursive blooms. <words>275</words>  

At dawn, she wove through the orchard, veil fluttering like a wounded ghost. <words>288</words>  
The idol’s shadow stretched toward her, jagged as the lies it had codified. <words>301</words>  
In her pocket, the seeds pulsed—a counter-rhythm to her heartbeat. <words>313</words>  

She knelt at the idol’s base, where ice met iron, and pressed a seed into the fissure. <words>330</words>  
The orchard’s light seeped into the crack, guided by snowflake geometries, amplifying until the ground shuddered. <words>348</words>  
The idol’s jaw cracked first, then its torso, fear dissolving into vapor that crystallized midair. <words>366</words>  

When it fell, the sound was neither triumph nor tragedy—just the sigh of a veil finally tearing free. <words>385</words>  
The astronomer stood amid crystal shadows, the orchard’s roots now threading through the idol’s rubble. <words>402</words>  
Snowflakes settled on her lashes, each a fleeting atlas, and for the first time since emotions died, she wondered if awe was a kind of resurrection. <words>428</words>
