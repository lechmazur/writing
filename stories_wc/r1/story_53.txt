<story>  
The wind-swept fortress stood skeletal in the valley, its ancient stones groaning as caverns below hurled echoes into the dusk. <words>25</words>  
Lira, the village’s rash protector—a title earned after she’d impulsively diverted a rockslide with dynamite—clutched her father’s collection of old postcards, their edges frayed from decades of restless fingers. <words>53</words>  
Today was moving day, but instead of joining her family’s caravan, she’d taken a different route home, drawn by the fortress’s hollow whistle. <words>74</words>  
Solace, she reasoned, wasn’t found in crowded wagons but in the vastness her father had scribbled about: *“The cosmos hums in the cracks between seconds.”* <words>98</words>  
Inside the fortress’s courtyard, a gust pried a postcard from her grip, lodging it into a crevice where the wall met earth. <words>116</words>  
As she knelt to retrieve it, her palm brushed a rusted hatch—quiet, as if waiting. <words>129</words>  
Beneath lay a chamber lit by bioluminescent moss, its air thick with the smell of petrified ink. <words>144</words>  
Thousands of postcards coated the walls, each addressed to strangers, dated centuries apart, yet all bearing the same looping handwriting as her father’s. <words>167</words>  
*“To whoever finds this,”* one began, *“the caverns’ howls are not wind but voices—the universe’s first language, forgotten at the dawn of awareness.”* <words>189</words>  
Lira’s pulse quickened; her father had died searching for this place. <words>199</words>  
Another card trembled in her hand: *“We are echoes. To hear the cosmos, you must become one.”* <words>215</words>  
A soundless vibration shuddered through the chamber, and the postcards levitated, aligning into constellations she’d seen in childhood textbooks. <words>234</words>  
Here, time frayed. <words>236</words>  
She witnessed her father as a young man, tucking a postcard into the hatch, his face alight with a hope she now mirrored. <words>256</words>  
Another card showed a medieval astronomer sketching the same stars, and a Neolithic child threading shells into their shapes. <words>274</words>  
The collection was universally unique—not for its age, but its purpose: a chorus across millennia, each author aching to share the sublime. <words>296</words>  
Lira understood then. <words>298</words>  
Her rashness, her father’s obsession, the fortress itself—all were stitches in a tapestry of quiet seekers. <words>315</words>  
The caverns’ howls sharpened into clarity, syllables pooling in her mind like melted frost. <words>330</words>  
*“You are heard,”* they murmured. <words>334</words>  
When she emerged, night had fallen, the sky a mirror of the chamber’s constellations. <words>348</words>  
Her family’s fires glimmered miles away, but she lingered, postcards pressed to her chest. <words>363</words>  
The cosmos wasn’t vast enough to drown her; it was vast enough to hold her. <words>377</words>  
In the valley’s throat, between wind and stone, she whispered her own message into the hatch: *“You are not alone.”* <words>397</words>  
The caverns answered, carrying her words backward and forward, a single thread in the tapestry’s endless weave. <words>416</words>  
Moving day had ended. <words>419</words>  
Lira’s journey, however, had just begun. <words>425</words>
