<story>  
The antique doorknob gleamed under Elara’s flashlight, its brass surface etched with symbols that seemed to writhe like serpents amid page turns of her trembling journal. <words>25</words>  
She’d traced it here, to the skeletal remains of an abandoned roller coaster track, its rusted rails curving into the fog like a question mark older than time. <words>50</words>  
The daring pathfinder smirked, her quiet mania sharpening as she recalled the bizarre housekeeping logs from the Haunted Spire Inn: entries detailing phantom maids scrubbing nonexistent stains, and a recurring note—“Erode the seventh pillar.” <words>85</words>  
Ingeniously clueless, Elara had mistaken “pillar” for “pillow” initially, shredding three mattresses before realizing the logs’ cipher pointed here—to the seventh support beam of this derelict ride. <words>112</words>  
Her fingers brushed the doorknob, a relic stolen from the Spire’s rotting front door, and the air hummed as if the track itself remembered screams. <words>133</words>  
“Erode,” she whispered, pouring vinegar over the beam’s corroded joint, the chemical hiss echoing like laughter. <words>148</words>  
Metal groaned; the beam split, revealing a cavity cradling a shard of obsidian—the last fragment of the Mirror of Mnemosyne, shattered millennia ago to imprison the Riddle-Mistress. <words>173</words>  
Elara’s pulse quickened. <words>176</words>  
Assembling the fragments had consumed her: six pieces traded for favors in shadowed markets, the seventh now here, its surface swirling with half-formed enigmas. <words>200</words>  
But the track trembled—not from memory, but from the weight of something ascending behind her. <words>217</words>  
The Riddle-Mistress’s voice slithered through the fog, syllables cracking like whip-thin bones. <words>230</words>  
“What binds time yet wears its face?” <words>236</words>  
Elara spun, clutching the shard. <words>241</words>  
The entity loomed, a silhouette of smoke and static, her form eroding at the edges like forgotten film. <words>258</words>  
“A clock,” Elara snapped, but the track shuddered violently, rejecting her answer. <words>273</words>  
Wrong. <words>274</words>  
Her mind raced through the housekeeping logs’ madness: phantom maids, vinegar stains, the Spire’s ledger noting “guests depart amid page turns, never reaching the end.” <words>296</words>  
Pages. <words>297</words>  
Time’s face—a book. <words>301</words>  
“A story,” Elara breathed. <words>305</words>  
The Riddle-Mistress wailed, her form unraveling into inkblots that soaked into the obsidian shard. <words>322</words>  
The mirror fused whole, reflecting not Elara’s face, but the Spire Inn’s ledger—now blank, its final entry waiting. <words>342</words>  
She laughed, quiet and unhinged, as the roller coaster’s chain lift clanked to life, carrying her toward the answer she’d etched: a single word, “Eclipse,” scrawled in vinegar and rust. <words>369</words>  
But as the cart plunged into the fog, Elara glimpsed the doorknob’s symbols rearranging—a new riddle blooming, older than time, hungrier than madness. <words>394</words>  
The pathfinder grinned. <words>397</words>  
Ingeniously clueless, eternally daring, she’d already begun counting the trackside pillars, vinegar sloshing in her pack like a promise. <words>418</words>  
Somewhere, a phantom maid dipped her mop, and the roller coaster’s scream became a sigh, then a whisper, then a story waiting. <words>440</words>
