<story>The bacteria-powered city hummed beneath a sky veiled by bioluminescent smog, its towering spires pulsing with microbial life as Lira, the nervous minstrel, plucked her lute with trembling fingers. <words>34</words> Her audience—a cluster of engineers sipping algal wine—clapped with the rarely sincere enthusiasm of people numbed by routine, their laughter echoing through the cavernous tavern like hollow coins. <words>73</words> Beneath her boot, a crumpled photograph of her brother’s grinning face peeked from the floorboards, its edges frayed from years of secretive handling. <words>104</words> He’d vanished into the city’s labyrinthine underbelly chasing rumors of “star-touched gates,” leaving only that image and a whisper: *Follow the patterns the smog can’t swallow.* <words>139</words>  

The tavern’s lone candle, guttering in a draft, cast wavering shadows as Lira muttered the evening’s final ballad—a coded plea for information masked as a love dirge. <words>175</words> A mechanic with oil-stained gloves slid her a vial of glowing bacteria, his smile sharp. <words>193</words> “Deploy this at the Eastern spire,” he said, “if you’re fool enough to chase ghosts.” <words>212</words> Her pulse quickened; the vial’s light mirrored the constellations her brother had drawn on the photograph’s back, maps to portals that promised escape from the ordinary. <words>245</words>  

She fled into the streets, where bacterial lamps throbbed like diseased hearts, their rhythms syncing with her hurried breaths. <words>269</words> At the spire’s base, she smashed the vial, releasing microbes that devoured the wall, revealing a hidden chamber humming with archaic machinery. <words>295</words> Star patterns glowed on its console, aligning with her brother’s scribbles—a lock waiting for a key. <words>316</words> Hands shaking, she input the sequence, each keystroke echoing her thundering doubt: *What if it’s another dead end? What if I’m not brave enough?* <words>345</words>  

The machine awoke with a shudder, its gears grinding open a portal framed in starlight. <words>363</words> Beyond it stretched a galaxy-strewn path, vibrating with a melody she’d only ever faked in taverns—raw, wild, *alive*. <words>385</words> The candle’s flame behind her dimmed to an ember, its time nearly spent. <words>400</words> Lira hesitated, clutching the photograph. <words>408</words> Purpose wasn’t in the certainty of a world that made sense, she realized, but in the dissonant notes between fear and motion. <words>435</words> Stepping through, she let the portal’s song consume her, its crescendo drowning the sputtering candle—and the life she’d outgrown. <words>460</words>  

In the bacteria-powered city, engineers still clapped for ballads, unaware the stars now hummed with a minstrel’s true voice, no longer trembling, no longer feigned. <words>492</words></story>
