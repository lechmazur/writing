<story>The tape dispenser clicked hollowly in Eli’s hand, its emptiness louder than the groans of irradiated soil beneath the farm’s barbed-wire sky.<words>25</words>  
He’d swindled three families this week with it, pretending the brittle plastic held adhesive strong enough to seal cracks in their fallout shelters—a small-time con artist’s specialty in a world where hope was the last currency.<words>58</words>  
The dystopian farm sprawled around him, its rows of wilted soy-cotton hybrids swaying in a rhythm so **unusually normal** it felt like nature itself was mocking him.<words>87</words>  
That’s when the ghosts arrived.<words>91</words>  

They flickered like static—a woman he’d cheated last winter, a boy who’d starved after trading his rations for Eli’s “miracle seeds.”<words>113</words>  
Their mouths moved soundlessly, but their accusations seeped into his skull like cold syrup.<words>127</words>  
“You think I wanted this?” Eli hissed, gripping the tape dispenser tighter.<words>138</words>  
**Interrogating ghostly apparitions** had become his ritual, a way to **comfort** himself by arguing he’d only ever given people what they demanded: lies with the texture of truth.<words>168</words>  

The boy’s phantom stepped closer, translucent fingers brushing the dispenser.<words>179</words>  
Eli flinched as memories surged—the child’s hands, trembling as he’d handed over a jar of clean water for that worthless plastic shell.<words>198</words>  
**The lull of remorse** came then, soft and suffocating, but Eli batted it away.<words>213</words>  
Survival required teeth, not tenderness.<words>217</words>  

He rose, kicking dust over the ghosts.<words>223</words>  
Beyond the fields, the Farmmaster’s tower blinked red, signaling another ration cut.<words>234</words>  
Eli grinned, saliva pooling at the thought of what he’d do next.<words>245</words>  
**To taunt the jaws of defeat and grin**—that was the game, the only one left worth playing.<words>263</words>  

He found her at dusk: a new widow, her shelter’s door gaping like a wound.<words>278</words>  
The tape dispenser felt heavier now, its void humming as he launched into his pitch.<words>293</words>  
But when her eyes welled—not with desperation, but recognition—he froze.<words>306</words>  
“You’re the one who sold my boy hope,” she whispered.<words>318</words>  

The ghosts materialized behind her, their forms solidifying in the twilight.<words>330</words>  
Eli’s throat tightened.<words>333</words>  
He could’ve bolted, could’ve fed her another lie.<words>342</words>  
Instead, he pressed the dispenser into her palm.<words>351</words>  
“It’s empty,” he said, the words carving his tongue raw.<words>362</words>  
“Always was.”<words>364</words>  

She stared at it, then laughed—a sound like splintering wood.<words>375</words>  
When the Farmmaster’s sirens wailed minutes later, Eli didn’t run.<words>387</words>  
He watched enforcers descend, their boots cracking the earth, and smiled with **mild fervor** as the widow vanished into the withered crops.<words>408</words>  
The ghosts lingered, silent now.<words>412</words>  
In their eyes, he saw it: the adhesive he’d spent years manufacturing wasn’t in the dispenser, but in the space between a sin confessed and the air that carries it.<words>444</words>  
Defeat’s jaws snapped shut around him.<words>450</words>  
He grinned wider.<words>452</words></story>
