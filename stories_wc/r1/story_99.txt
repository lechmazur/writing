The abandoned carnival prize booth creaked under the weight of forgotten time, its faded banners whispering of cotton candy ghosts and goldfish won by children now grown to dust. <words>30</words> Elias Thorn, a bookbinder with fingers stained by ink and a mind frayed by telekinetic static, traced the warped wood of the counter, seeking what every binder seeks: a story worth binding. <words>61</words> His strictly casual demeanor—a threadbare sweater, a shrug worn like armor—belied the hunger beneath: to discover the power of transformation, to stitch himself into something unbreakable. <words>89</words>  

A crumpled chopstick wrapper fluttered against his boot, its crinkle sharp as a struck match. <words>102</words> Sound bites had always been his curse. <words>107</words> The wrapper’s rustle tore the air, and suddenly he was *elsewhere*: a memory not his own. <words>122</words> A woman in jade robes stood in a moonlit courtyard, pressing the same wrapper into a soldier’s palm. <words>138</words> “Knowledge is a debt,” she said, her voice dissolving as Elias gasped back into the present. <words>155</words>  

Revive. <words>156</words> The word pulsed in his temples. <words>160</words> The booth’s shelves held not plush toys but books—tomes bound in human skin, scrolls sealed with wax tears, each a lost legend demanding resurrection. <words>183</words> His telekinesis hummed, pages flipping autonomously until a sketch froze his breath: the jade-robed woman, her hands clasping a chrysalis. <words>203</words> Transformation. <words>204</words> Sacrifice. <words>205</words> The price. <words>206</words>  

Another crinkle. <words>207</words> Another flash: the soldier, older, burning the wrapper in a brazier, smoke coiling into a serpent that swallowed the woman whole. <words>229</words> Elias’s hands trembled. <words>232</words> To revive a legend was to pay its debt—this, he understood. <words>245</words> But the booth’s shadows thickened, and the books began to chant in tongues of ash and ochre. <words>263</words>  

He levitated the wrapper, its paper glowing as the booth’s timbers splintered into a vortex of memories. <words>281</words> The carnival became a tapestry: the woman weaving fate from silkworm threads, the soldier burying the serpent’s fang in his chest, Elias himself, age nine, binding his first book with a whisper that sent his mother’s vase shattering. <words>315</words> *Always a cost*, the tapestry hissed. <words>322</words>  

The chrysalis from the sketch materialized, hovering above his palm. <words>333</words> Inside, a figure writhed—not the woman, not the soldier, but his own reflection, mouth stretched in a scream. <words>353</words> Transformation demanded surrender. <words>357</words> To know was to unravel. <words>362</words> The booth’s roof tore away, revealing a sky stitched with constellations of every story he’d ever bound. <words>382</words>  

He crushed the chrysalis. <words>385</words> Light erupted—not from it, but from himself, his cells unraveling into letters, into alphabets unknown. <words>405</words> The booth collapsed, the wrapper disintegrating as Elias Thorn became both ink and parchment, debtor and creditor, forever binding the price of knowledge into his bones. <words>433</words>  

When dawn came, only the carnival’s ruins remained, and a single book lying open, its pages blank but for the faint scent of jade and smoke. <words>458</words>
