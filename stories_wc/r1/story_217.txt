The carousel’s skeletal horses creaked in the wind as Clara tightened her grip on the pocket knife, its seven blades folded like secrets against her palm. <words>30</words>  
She’d always been dismissed as the “maintenance girl” here at Hollow Grove Amusement Park—too slight, too quiet—but tonight, the haunted house’s groans felt sharper, hungrier, as if the ghosts knew what was coming. <words>63</words>  
Her phone rang once, piercing the fog—a sound she’d rehearsed for since the old fortune teller whispered, *“When fate calls, prime the stagnant heart.”* <words>91</words>  
Inside the decaying mansion, a figure waited: Mr. Voss, the park’s bankrupt owner, clutching a bento box of *guotie* dumplings, their crimped edges golden under a flickering bulb. <words>124</words>  
“You’re late,” he rasped, though his eyes softened at the sight of her knife—the same tool she’d used to fix rides, carve charms, and once, to sever the ropes binding a trapped child. <words>160</words>  
“Adapt or die, right?” Clara said, her voice steady as she unfolded the blade labeled “resilience,” its edge glinting like a dare. <words>181</words>  
The air thickened as they ate, the dumplings’ pork-and-chive warmth a stark contrast to the creeping frost. <words>198</words>  
“My wife… she loved these,” Voss murmured, grief cracking his words. <words>210</words>  
Clara understood then: the park wasn’t haunted by spirits, but by the weight of abandoned joy. <words>225</words>  
A crash echoed—the Ferris wheel tearing free, its gondolas swooping like vengeful crows. <words>238</words>  
“It’s intensifying,” Voss gasped as shadows pooled into liquid shapes, drawn to his despair. <words>252</words>  
Clara lunged, using the knife’s hook to snag a wiring panel, redirecting power until fairy lights blazed—a constellation against the dark. <words>272</words>  
“You rebuild,” she insisted, tossing him the blade marked “courage.” <words>283</words>  
Together, they spliced cables and stapled tarp, their movements a dance between desperation and hope. <words>298</words>  
When the final bulb flickered on, the mansion’s facade shifted: peeling paint became deliberate decay, menace transformed into theater. <words>317</words>  
Voss laughed, a sound both broken and bright, as dawn revealed not ruins but a stage set for resurrection. <words>335</words>  
“You saw wonder here all along,” he said, pressing the bento box into her hands—a relic reborn as a promise. <words>354</words>  
Clara stepped outside, where sunlight gilded the roller coaster’s corpse, and smiled that sadly joyful smile of those who mourn and mend in the same breath. <words>378</words>  
The knife weighed less now, its blades whispering stories of adaptation—of haunted houses remade into shelters, of dumplings shared in the teeth of loss, of a rebel who’d wielded both steel and softness to make ghosts into guides. <words>416</words>  
As the first visitors arrived, drawn by rumors of a park reborn, Clara answered her ringing phone once more, her voice steady: “Hollow Grove’s ready to wonder again.” <words>444</words>  
Somewhere, a carousel began to play. <words>449</words>
