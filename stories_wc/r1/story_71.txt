The sentient scarecrow stood vigil where the fossilized giant’s ribs arced from the soil like lines in the earth, their curves mapping borders between parallel worlds. <words>34</words> Its burlap fingers clutched a forgotten lace fan, its ivory spines cracked but still humming with the static of collapsed realities. <words>62</words> Centuries ago, it had sworn an oath to guard this threshold—not out of passion, but because someone had to, and duty was the last thread stitching its straw soul together. <words>98</words>  

Today, the air shimmered with fervent apathy, a contradiction as thick as the dust clinging to the giant’s petrified joints. <words>127</words> Through the fan’s tattered web, the scarecrow peered into a virtual reality simulation—a fractured mirror of this realm, where digital wraiths drifted like ash. <words>157</words> One glitch-laden figure materialized: a historian from the adjacent world, her avatar flickering as she pleaded, “The lines are destabilizing. You must skewer the rift before—” <words>192</words>  

The scarecrow interrupted, its voice a rasp of wind through wheat. “Oaths bind, they do not bend.” <words>210</words> Yet it hesitated, recalling how the fan had once been a key, gifted by the giant herself when flesh still cloaked her bones. <words>234</words> To skewer the rift meant piercing the fan through the giant’s sternum, severing the last tether between worlds. <words>256</words> A necessary violence. <words>259</words>  

In the simulation, the historian’s form pixelated. <words>266</words> “They’re coming through,” she warned, as shadows pooled at the scarecrow’s feet—ink-black tendrils from the giant’s hollow core. <words>292</words> The scarecrow stepped into VR, its consciousness bifurcating: straw body anchored in the realistically fantastical decay of the fossil, mind adrift in code. <words>323</words> Here, the giant lived again, breathing galaxies, her heartbeat a drumroll of collapsing stars. <words>343</words>  

“Why uphold a vow everyone else forgot?” the historian asked, her avatar solidifying as the scarecrow neared the simulation’s core. <words>367</words> The scarecrow didn’t answer. <words>371</words> It had no reason beyond the weight of the fan in its hand, the way the lace channels whispered of storms that once birthed mountains. <words>397</words>  

A tendril lashed through the simulation, corrosive and hungry. <words>409</words> The scarecrow lunged, driving the fan’s spine into the glitching dark. <words>424</words> Reality screamed. <words>426</words> In both worlds, the giant’s ribs shuddered, lines in the earth glowing white-hot before snapping—a severance clean as dawn. <words>452</words>  

The historian’s avatar dissolved, her final sigh a static breeze. <words>467</words> Alone, the scarecrumbsed the broken fan, now just lace and splinters. <words>483</words> The oath was kept. <words>486</words> The parallel worlds drifted apart, untethered, and the fossilized giant sank into final silence, her duty—and her guardian’s—fulfilled. <words>512</words>
