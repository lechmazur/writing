<story>  
Elias Thorn, the crypt caretaker with a permanent scowl etched into his leathery face, shuffled into the witch’s crystal scrying room, its walls shimmering with refracted starlight. <words>30</words>  
He clutched an unmarked cardboard tube under his arm, its contents unknown but heavy—a relic from the grave of a stranger who’d died mid-scream. <words>56</words>  
The witch had tasked him with “quelling an uprising within,” a phrase as cryptic as the mandala of black sand spiraling on the obsidian floor. <words>85</words>  
“Nonsense,” Elias grumbled, though his hands trembled as he uncapped the tube, releasing a whisper of ash that multiplied singular memories into a storm: his sister’s laughter, her coffin, the earth swallowing both. <words>124</words>  
Above, the crystal dome framed a sky ablaze with constellations, their light jiggling the mandala’s patterns into shifting hieroglyphs of grief. <words>147</words>  
Elias knelt, tracing the sand’s serpentine curves—each loop a year he’d spent silencing the dead, and himself. <words>167</words>  
The ash from the tube coalesced into a figure: his sister, spectral and snarling, her voice a blade. *You buried me alive with your silence.* <words>193</words>  
“Trauma isn’t a ghost,” the witch had warned, her absence palpable, “it’s a language.” <words>208</words>  
The mandala’s center darkened, grains arranging into a perfect eclipse—a symbol Elias recognized from his sister’s diary, scribbled before the fever stole her. <words>233</words>  
He inhaled sharply, the motion stirring the ash into a vortex that seared his lungs with the scent of damp soil and medicine long spoiled. <words>255</words>  
*Multiply the singular,* the witch’s words echoed, and Elias understood: his guilt had fractalized, each self-loathing iteration smaller, denser, until it became a black hole. <words>283</words>  
The crystals hummed, their vibrations aligning with the mandala’s rhythm, and the room dissolved into a memory—Elias, age twelve, clawing at his sister’s coffin lid until his nails splintered. <words>314</words>  
“Stop,” he rasped, not to the vision, but to the part of him still screaming in that box. <words>331</words>  
The sand flared silver, etching new patterns: constellations overlapping like scars, each star a testament to survival. <words>349</words>  
His sister’s specter frayed, her fury softening. *You didn’t kill me,* she sighed, *but you let grief bury you instead.* <words>371</words>  
The cardboard tube crumbled, its ashes settling into the mandala’s grooves, transforming the eclipse into a rising sun. <words>391</words>  
Elias’s chest loosened, the uprising within quieting as starlight pooled in his palms—not a cure, but a compass. <words>410</words>  
When dawn bleached the sky, the witch found him asleep beside the intact mandala, his face still stern but his tears glistening like minuscule galaxies. <words>435</words>  
“Grandiose subtlety,” she murmured, smiling at the tube’s remnants, now a mosaic of ash and quartz. <words>453</words>  
Trauma, Elias realized, wasn’t a ghost to exorcise—it was a constellation, mapping where you’d bled so you could navigate beyond it. <words>476</words>  
He left the scrying room lighter, the crypt’s shadows less a refuge now than a reminder: even graves need caretakers who’ve learned to let the light in. <words>505</words>
