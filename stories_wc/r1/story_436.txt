<story>  
The sorrowful apothecary clutched the plastic spoon, its edge worn smooth by decades of stirring family recipes now reduced to ash. <words>23</words>  
Above the scorching deserts, the exiled fortress trembled, its obsidian walls groaning as sandstorms clawed at its levitating foundations. <words>44</words>  
She had three breaths left—the library’s doors would seal in the final minute, trapping her forever unless she bifurcated the truth from the lies. <words>69</words>  
Dream catchers dangled like skeletal hands in the vault’s dimness, their webs strung with feathers and beads that hummed with forgotten tongues. <words>90</words>  
“Decipher them,” the oracle had whispered before falling silent, her voice extinguished by the weight of prophecies too cruel to repeat. <words>110</words>  
The apothecary’s fingers trembled as she pressed the spoon into a mound of roughly refined salt—a relic from her mother’s kitchen, gritty with unresolved grief. <words>132</words>  
Each grain held a memory: her sister’s laughter, her father’s hands shaping dough, the way her grandmother had sung to simmering broths. <words>152</words>  
But the dream catchers demanded blood, not nostalgia. <words>158</words>  
She pricked her thumb, letting crimson droplets dissolve into the salt, and traced the slurry onto the nearest web. <words>176</words>  
Symbols flared—a language of fire and fracture—revealing a map etched in the threads. <words>190</words>  
“The seventh knot,” she murmured, counting constellations of twine until her nail caught on a loop taut with tension. <words>208</words>  
A whisper slithered out: *“To tempt the oracle, you must become the poison she fears.”* <words>224</words>  
The apothecary recoiled, but the library’s lamps dimmed—time collapsing. <words>236</words>  
She hurled the spoon into her satchel, its plastic clattering against vials of midnight sap and moth-wing powder. <words>253</words>  
Her family’s last recipe surfaced in her mind—*Infusion of Unspoken Truths*—a brew meant to pry open sealed lips. <words>271</words>  
But the instructions were incomplete, bifurcated by her ancestors to protect against misuse. <words>285</words>  
Half required starlight; half demanded shadow. <words>292</words>  
She split the salt mixture, pouring one half into a crescent-shaped vial, the other into a thimble-sized crucible. <words>310</words>  
The fortress shuddered violently, shelves toppling as the doors began their descent. <words>323</words>  
She sprinted, leaping over shattered glass and spiraling scrolls, clutching the vials to her chest. <words>339</words>  
The oracle’s chamber loomed—a hollowed niche where the seer sat motionless, her eyes milky with visions she refused to share. <words>359</words>  
“Speak!” the apothecary begged, thrusting the crucible forward. <words>368</words>  
The oracle’s lips parted, not for words, but to inhale the rising steam. <words>381</words>  
Her pupils dilated, black swallowing white, and she gasped—a sound like a long-sealed tomb cracking open. <words>399</words>  
“You… carry her face,” the oracle rasped, tears cutting through dust. <words>412</words>  
The apothecary’s heart split: here was the painful joy of being known, of being broken, of realizing the recipe had always been a requiem. <words>434</words>  
As the doors slammed shut, the vials slipped from her hands, their contents merging into a silver pool that reflected not her face, but her mother’s. <words>460</words>  
The fortress plunged into silence, the dream catchers stilling at last. <words>471</words>  
Somewhere, in the scorching dark below, a spoon lay buried, waiting to stir another’s sorrow. <words>486</words>
