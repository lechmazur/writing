The cracked porcelain doll sat center-stage on the vanity, its left eye socket vacant, its smile frozen in a suspiciously sweet curve that made Eli’s stomach twist. <words>27</words> He hadn’t stepped into this abandoned circus dressing room in twelve years, not since the night the tent collapsed and the laughter turned to screams. <words>53</words> Dawn’s second breath—that fragile moment between night’s surrender and day’s claim—whispered through moth-eaten curtains, carrying the scent of burnt sugar and rust. <words>81</words> Eli traced the doll’s hairline fracture, its jagged seam splitting its porcelain cheek like a tear. <words>98</words> “Still here, huh?” he muttered, though he knew it wasn’t the doll listening. <words>111</words>  

The voice had started at the planetarium. <words>118</words> A chance encounter: Eli, nursing regrets in the back row, and the astronomer’s lecture on black holes—*“What devours also creates.”* <words>141</words> A woman beside him, her eyes star-flecked, slid him a ticket stub scribbled with coordinates. <words>158</words> *“Your circus,”* she’d said. *“The unknown’s waiting where you buried it.”* <words>174</words> Now here he stood, the protector who’d fled, the coward who’d survived. <words>189</words>  

The doll’s head tilted with a click. <words>194</words> Eli recoiled as honeyed smoke coiled from its mouth, thickening the air with the cloying sweetness of rot masquerading as maple syrup. <words>218</words> Shadows pooled at his feet, alive and hungry. <words>226</words> *This* was what he’d locked away—the thing that had fed on the circus’s joy, grown fat on his silence. <words>245</words> “You’re supposed to be gone,” he hissed, but the room pulsed in reply, velvet curtains bleeding into starless void. <words>266</words>  

A laugh, light and lethal, chimed from the doll. <words>275</words> *“You left a door open, Eli.”* The voice was the woman’s from the planetarium, now syrup-thick, now serpent-sharp. <words>295</words> *“All that light you swallowed—let it out.”* <words>304</words> His hands trembled. <words>307</words> To unleash it meant becoming what he’d feared: a conduit, a storm. <words>321</words> But the astronomer’s words hummed in his bones—*devourer and creator*—and the doll’s fracture glowed gold. <words>341</words>  

Eli gripped the doll. <words>344</words> “Fine,” he spat, “take it all.” <words>351</words> He tore the porcelain head clean off. <words>357</words> Light erupted—not the pure kind, but a searing, sugar-coated blaze that scorched his palms and split the floor. <words>379</words> The void roared, the shadows thrashing as the blaze consumed them, their screeches harmonizing with the distant call of a morning train. <words>403</words> Eli laughed through the pain, the protector finally embracing the fate he’d denied: to burn bright, to end the feast. <words>428</words>  

When the fire died, the doll lay in ashes, the room still but for the settling dust. <words>447</words> Eli’s hands, blistered and raw, clutched a single unmarred fragment—the doll’s smile, now his to carry. <words>467</words> Outside, dawn broke proper, the sky a bruised pink. <words>478</words> He pocketed the shard, its edges sharp as truth, and stepped into the light. <words>495</words>
