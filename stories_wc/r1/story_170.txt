The coral restoration station stood skeletal under the moon, its iron ribs crusted with salt, when Marisela laid the final stone into the abandoned wall. <words>27</words> Her calloused fingers lingered on the limestone’s cold edge, as if sealing a tomb. <words>42</words> The wall had once bordered her grandmother’s garden, now drowned by rising seas—a relic she’d painstakingly relocated here, stone by stone, to anchor her work. <words>75</words> But the hollow echoes of shame still hissed in her lungs, sharp as the brine-scorched wind. <words>95</words>  

She knelt, withdrawing the vintage sewing kit from her satchel. <words>107</words> Its mother-of-pearl surface glimmered, a relic from the grandmother who’d taught her to stitch herbs into salves and coral polyps into fractured reefs. <words>137</words> Inside lay not thread, but vials of symbiotic algae and a letter, brittle as seagrass, that she’d memorized yet couldn’t bury. <words>165</words> *You abandon academia for superstition*, her botany professor had written, *wasting your gifts on drowned gardens.* <words>188</words>  

Breathless longing tightened her throat. <words>193</words> She’d charted tidal patterns in ink washes, published papers on seagrass sonnets—*academically artistic*, they’d sneered, as if beauty diluted truth. <words>217</words> Now, the restoration station’s dying corals bleached white as bone, a verdict. <words>232</words>  

A glint beneath the wall’s new stone caught her eye: another letter, salt-swollen and sealed with wax. <words>252</words> Her pulse drummed as she pried it open, revealing her grandmother’s handwriting, erased by decades. <words>271</words> *Doubt is a root,* it read, *not a weed. Let it anchor you deeper.* <words>287</words>  

Wind shrieked through the station’s pipes. <words>292</words> Marisela stared at the sewing kit, its compartments holding cures and curses. <words>307</words> *Memorize this*, her grandmother had whispered, pressing it into her hands before the sea claimed her. <words>327</words> *Not the stitches, but the spaces between.* <words>335</words>  

Dawn bled crimson over the reef. <words>340</words> Marisela mixed algae dyes, painting the limestone with microbial hymns, each brushstroke a plea. <words>359</words> She stitched mangroves to the station’s legs, their roots knitting a scaffold for new life. <words>378</words> The heart of doubt beat louder, a rhythm: *What if you’re wrong? What if you’re right?* <words>397</words>  

When the first polyp gripped the wall—a violet bud against gray—she laughed, saltwater on her lips. <words>417</words> The letters rustled in her pocket, their voices now a chorus, not a storm. <words>435</words> Here, in the ruin she’d mended with forgotten words and remembered light, the echoes hushed. <words>455</words>  

She left the sewing kit in the wall’s crevice, its mother-of-pearl gleaming like a compass. <words>474</words> Let the next dreamer find it, and stitch their own stubborn hope. <words>489</words>  

The tide rolled in, singing. <words>494</words>
