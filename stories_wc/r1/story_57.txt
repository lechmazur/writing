<story>Lord Percival Thistledown III trimmed the topiary hedge with a sigh, his monogrammed gardening gloves speckled with sap—yard work was beneath his station, but the staff had mysteriously vanished. <words>34</words> A glint caught his eye: his late father’s dull silver letter opener wedged in the soil, its edge green with patina. <words>65</words> As he pried it free, the hedge shuddered, revealing a hatch leading to a chrome-plated chamber humming with machinery—a secret agent workshop, judging by the wall of blinking monitors and a vat labeled “EMERGENCY LIQUEFACTION.” <words>110</words> Percival’s unusually perceptive ears twitched; voices echoed from a ventilation shaft above, discussing “neutralizing the specimen before it imprints.” <words>137</words>  

He climbed, letter opener in hand, into the ductwork—an echo chamber amplifying whispers about a creature codenamed “Starling,” kept in Cell 7. <words>169</words> Through a grate, he spotted it: a translucent, fox-like thing with galaxies swirling under its skin, cowering as agents prepared a syringe. <words>196</words> Silent empathy flooded him; the creature’s fear mirrored his own under his father’s tyranny, that same desperate fragility. <words>220</words>  

“Nasty business, euthanizing interstellar pests,” drawled an agent, polishing a laser scalpel. <words>235</words> Percival’s submissive instincts warred with resolve—he’d never defied anyone, but this? <words>252</words> He dropped through the grate, landing with aristocratic clumsiness. <words>263</words> “Terribly sorry,” he stammered, brandishing the letter opener like a sword, “but I’m afraid I must insist you unhand that… that marvel.” <words>291</words>  

The agents froze, then laughed. <words>295</words> “Or what, milord? You’ll stab us with a butter knife?” <words>306</words>  

“Actually,” Percival said, recalling the liquefaction vat’s manual he’d skimmed, “I’ll recalibrate your matter disassembler to reduce you to puddles.” <words>330</words> His finger hovered over the control panel—a bluff, but his perceptive mind had noted the “OVERLOAD” button. <words>350</words>  

The creature whined. <words>352</words>  

“Wait!” an agent hissed. <words>355</words> “That thing’s a biohazard!” <words>360</words>  

“So are you, darling,” Percival retorted with earnest flippancy, pressing the button. <words>375</words> Lights flared; agents scrambled as pipes groaned, spewing mist. <words>388</words> He grabbed the creature, its warmth seeping into his palms like starlight, and sprinted. <words>405</words> The workshop shuddered, machinery liquefying into molten sludge. <words>417</words>  

In the garden, the creature nuzzled his hand and dissolved into light, soaring skyward. <words>435</words> Percival pocketed the letter opener, smiling—finally, he’d protected something his father couldn’t. <words>453</words> The hedge swung shut, burying the workshop’s secrets, as he resumed trimming, humming a waltz. <words>472</words></story>
