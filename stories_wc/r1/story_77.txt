The journal’s final page glowed under the asteroid’s dim bioluminescent lichen, its edges frayed like the nerves of Kael, the introverted empath who traced the words with trembling fingers. <words>34</words>  
Around him, the space pirate hideout hummed—a labyrinth of stolen fusion cores and rusted airlocks—but his focus clung to the dried starfish nestled beside the journal, its spines whispering memories of Earth’s vanished oceans. <words>70</words>  
“Mountain wisdom,” he muttered, recalling the phrase etched into the asteroid’s oldest caverns, a creed for those who saw truths in silence. <words>95</words>  
Tonight, he would need it. <words>100</words>  
The marionette lay shattered on his workbench, its porcelain limbs a puzzle only he could solve; reassembling it wasn’t craftsmanship but communion, each fragment humming with the anguish of the pirate who’d once danced it into violence. <words>145</words>  
Kael’s empathy slithered into the cracks, stitching consciousness to splinters, when a shout echoed through the hideout: “Breach in Sector Gamma!” <words>168</words>  
He tensed. <words>169</words>  
They’d come for the outcasts again—the “unreasonable,” the dreamers who defied the Galactic Accord’s sterile logic. <words>187</words>  
His starfish, obviously hidden in plain sight beside ration tins, pulsed faintly, a relic of tidal rhythms now buried under asteroid dust. <words>210</words>  
“Marshal the crews,” growled Captain Veyra, her voice slicing through the drowsy enthusiasm of the hideout’s night cycle. <words>230</words>  
Kael’s hands didn’t pause. <words>234</words>  
The marionette’s head clicked into place, its glass eyes flickering awake, and suddenly he was falling into its memories: a child’s laughter, a mountain shrine, a pact to protect the fractured. <words>268</words>  
“You’re their champion now,” the puppet seemed to say, its voice a shiver of quartz. <words>285</words>  
Outside, plasma fire scarred the asteroid’s surface. <words>293</words>  
Kael stood, the journal’s closing lines burning in his mind: *To champion the outcasts of reason is to hold the galaxy’s soul.* <words>317</words>  
He slipped the starfish into his coat, its brittleness a silent vow, and stepped into the chaos. <words>335</words>  
Pirates scrambled—mechanics, exiles, poets of ruin—as Accord enforcers descended in sleek silver suits. <words>353</words>  
Kael raised the marionette. <words>357</words>  
Its strings quivered, not with control, but kinship, threading through the pirates’ fears like a chorus. <words>377</words>  
One enforcer faltered, helmet cracking to reveal a face Kael recognized: Lieutenant Renn, the boy from the mountain shrine, now hollowed by logic. <words>406</words>  
“You’ve forgotten tides,” Kael whispered, the starfish warm against his chest. <words>421</words>  
Renn’s weapon clattered. <words>424</words>  
Around them, the hideout breathed—a living, unreasonable thing—as pirates and enforcers alike froze, severed from reason, found in the fractures. <words>452</words>  
When the Accord ships retreated, Kael returned to his journal, its last page waiting. <words>468</words>  
He wrote: *Truth isn’t wielded. It’s reassembled.* Then he placed the marionette beside the starfish, its dance finally still, and slept. <words>494</words>
