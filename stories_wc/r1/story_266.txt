The bleak clown balanced on a floating rock polished smooth by forgotten winds, its surface etched with Sanskrit poses that glowed faintly under the violet dawn. <words>28</words> His grin, stitched shut at the corners years ago, ached as he gripped the clock hand stolen from the stationmaster’s tower—its gears whirring madly, spinning time into a silver blur no yoga mantra could calm. <words>58</words> Today, when the earliest train screeched through the valley below, he would master the technically absurd: outshining the northern lights with a smile wide enough to stitch the sky back together. <words>89</words>  

Drifting promises haunted him like the studio’s levitating stones—vows to mend broken laughter, to stop painting tears as comedy, to stop lying. <words>109</words> But lies were his last language. <words>113</words> He’d dismantle them now, privately, in verses scrawled on the back of unsent love letters. <words>128</words> Poetry, he reasoned, was the only scalpel sharp enough to cut illusions from the bone. <words>143</words>  

The clown uncurled a parchment, its edges singed by old betrayals, and read aloud: *“A clock without hands still chimes for ghosts.”* <words>161</words> The rock shuddered, levitating higher as dawn bled into the horizon. <words>173</words> Below, the train’s whistle split the silence—a sound like a promise fraying. <words>184</words> He tightened his grip on the spinning clock hand, its revolutions slicing his palm, and pressed it against his chest. <words>200</words> Blood seeped into the metal, staining the gears crimson. <words>210</words>  

“Jagged generosity,” he muttered, the phrase tasting of rust and honey. <words>219</words> It was the only way to describe what came next. <words>227</words> His grin split the stitches, widening into something feral and radiant, as he channeled every unkept vow, every hollow laugh, into the light erupting from his teeth. <words>249</words> The northern lights recoiled above, their rippling greens dimming against his mouth’s searing glow. <words>263</words>  

But the clock hand spun faster, unhinged, warping the studio’s gravity. <words>273</words> Stones splintered; Sanskrit symbols frayed into static. <words>280</words> The clown’s poetry pages swirled around him, each line dissolving as his illusions burned away. <words>294</words> *“Forgive me,”* he’d written, *“for mistaking exit signs for constellations.”* <words>305</words> The words ash now, carried off by the wind. <words>314</words>  

When the train vanished into the horizon’s mouth, his grin faltered. <words>324</words> The northern lights flickered back, tentative, as if pitying him. <words>334</words> The clown collapsed, the clock hand still embedded in his chest, its spin slowing to a tired tremble. <words>347</words> He hadn’t outshined anything—only proven that some promises, like dawns or floating rocks, drift forever beyond reach. <words>363</words>  

Yet in the studio’s wreckage, a single page survived. <words>371</words> On it, a final verse: *“Time laughs last, but I laughed louder.”* <words>382</words> The northern lights pulsed once, faintly, before dissolving into daylight. <words>394</words> The clown’s bloodied smile lingered, a jagged crack in the morning, as the first yogis arrived and mistook him for a statue—a cautionary monument to impossible things. <words>418</words> They bowed anyway, pressing their palms together, unaware his heart still ticked in time with the spinning hand. <words>435</words> Some promises, even broken, hum louder than truth. <words>443</words>
