<story>  
Baron Voss knelt in the catacomb orchard, fingertips tracing roots that coiled through ribcages like serpents frozen mid-hunt. <words>25</words>  
His raft—woven from willow and the sinew of last winter’s stag—hovered at the marsh’s edge, its bow kissing open water for the first time. <words>49</words>  
Three seasons he’d spent here, archiving decay and rebirth in ink-smudged journals, but the fourth demanded something older than words. <words>73</words>  
The empty bottle hung cold against his chest, its glass throat stoppered with wax; a vessel for what the soil whispered when frost cracked bone. <words>97</words>  
He’d unearthed it that morning beneath the eldest oak, where knuckled roots cradled a skull whose teeth bore grooves from a forgotten alphabet. <words>121</words>  
Now the bottle’s surface fogged with his breath, reflecting not his face but the orchard’s lattice of shadows—visibly obscure, yet sharper than memory. <words>146</words>  
A figure materialized between birch trunks, their form rippling like heat over coals. <words>160</words>  
Baron’s hands lifted, shaping signs his grandfather had carved into driftwood: *Who tends these roots when the earth forgets?* <words>184</words>  
The stranger’s reply flickered through moth-wing gestures: *Only what remains unspoken*. <words>198</words>  
Above them, apples rustled, their flesh taut with juice that smelled of iron and myrrh. <words>214</words>  
Baron pressed the bottle to the ground, watching as amber liquid seeped upward—not through the glass, but *into* it, as if the vessel drank the orchard’s silence. <words>241</words>  
When he stood, the stranger was gone, but the raft trembled, current pulling it toward the lake’s heart. <words>260</words>  
He stepped aboard, knees settling between bundles of dried mint and charcoal maps. <words>275</words>  
As reeds released their grip, the bottle’s contents shifted, showing not sap but seasons: spring buds bursting from eye sockets, summer beetles writing hymns on femur parchment. <words>303</words>  
Baron signed to the deepening twilight, fingers contorting for concepts no living tongue had names for—the ache of growth through cracks, the algebra of moonlight on marrow. <words>331</words>  
The raft accelerated, water chuckling beneath its ribs. <words>340</words>  
He clutched the bottle tighter, now radiant as a witch’s lantern, its glow leaching color from his hands. <words>358</words>  
Doubt arrived luminous and precise: what if the archive consumed the archivist? <words>373</words>  
What if the orchard required not a chronicler, but a sacrifice? <words>384</words>  
Bones surfaced briefly in their wake—a clavary of snagged branches, a jawbone grinning through duckweed. <words>401</words>  
When the far shore blurred into existence, it wasn’t land that greeted him, but another raft, its deck piled with bottles clouded by decades. <words>425</words>  
The stranger stood there, hands dancing in a language of storms and germination: *Begin again*. <words>442</words>  
Baron raised his bottle, now heavy with autumn’s first sigh, and understood the pact. <words>458</words>  
As his raft dissolved into sugar maple seeds, he stepped onto the new vessel, its timbers warm with stored sunlight. <words>477</words>  
Behind them, the orchard folded into itself, roots cradling the empty bottle like a fallen star. <words>494</words>  
Somewhere downstream, a winter not yet born began counting its teeth. <words>508</words>
