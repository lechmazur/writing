The lighthouse keeper’s bedroom reeked of salt and mildew, its walls groaning like a scorned lover as the sentinel slumped into a moth-eaten armchair. <words>27</words>  
Her gloved finger tapped the final cross mark on the list—nine names, nine broken vows, each eroding like the cliffs beneath the lighthouse. <words>50</words>  
“Certainly possible you’ll haunt me next,” she muttered to the room, tossing the frayed rope onto a desk cluttered with maps and rusted keys. <words>76</words>  
It had taken three months to confiscate that rope from the last traitorous keeper, its fibers splitting like the promises he’d sworn to uphold. <words>103</words>  
A cold draft hissed through the cracks, carrying the faint click of heels on floorboards—a sound that stilled her breath. <words>125</words>  
The ghostly keeper materialized, his translucent form waltzing in precise, reckless arcs, as if the floor were a ballroom and death a mere misstep. <words>151</words>  
“You’re late,” he said, his voice a rasp of tide against stone. <words>163</words>  
“Learned traditional methods take time,” she replied, dry as the ledger in her coat pocket. <words>181</words>  
Their eyes met, and for a heartbeat, the room hummed with the memory of a shared obsession: the *volta*, a Renaissance dance of intertwined defiance and trust. <words>210</words>  
He’d taught it to her decades ago, spinning her across this same floor until dawn cracked the horizon. <words>228</words>  
Now, his spectral hand extended. <words>233</words>  
“Finish it,” he demanded, gesturing to the rope. <words>242</words>  
She scoffed but knotted the frayed ends with methodical urgency, each twist mirroring the *volta*’s steps—sharp pivots, controlled collapses. <words>266</words>  
The lighthouse shuddered; the beacon’s light flickered, dimmed by years of neglected oaths. <words>284</words>  
“Why?” she asked, the question hanging like fog. <words>293</words>  
“Because you’re the last sentinel who remembers,” he said, fading as the restored rope snapped taut in the pulley above. <words>316</words>  
The beacon blazed anew, its light carving through the night with reckless precision. <words>334</words>  
She stared at the empty space where he’d stood, then at the list—now meaningless. <words>351</words>  
The traditional methods had worked, but the victory tasted of salt and solitude. <words>367</words>  
Footsteps echoed again, softer now, as she stepped into the center of the room. <words>383</words>  
Alone, she danced the *volta*, her boots scraping the floor where his had once glided. <words>400</words>  
Promises, she realized, weren’t eroded by time, but by the silence between heartbeats. <words>418</words>  
The lighthouse groaned its agreement, its light steady, its sentinel swaying between duty and memory. <words>437</words>  
When dawn came, she pocketed the rope and left, the ghost’s laughter tangled in the wind. <words>454</words>  
Some vows, she decided, were better kept moving. <words>463</words>
