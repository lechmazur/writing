<story>  
The lavender field swayed beneath a sky bleeding its last light, its single remaining star flickering like a dying ember. <words>25</words>  
Here, where rusted factory skeletons clawed at the horizon, the fidgety mage-smith Lira clutched her ring of keys, each teeth-marked iron shape humming with locked potential. <words>50</words>  
Chaos gnawed at the edges of the world—she felt it in the lavender’s ashen scent, in the factory’s groans—but the chalkboard notes she’d scavenged promised a way to *remake*. <words>75</words>  
“Seeds of regrowth,” she muttered, her voice cracking as she traced the equations scrawled in ancient dust. <words>92</words>  
They required harmony, a song to wake dormant magic—but Lira’s hands, skilled in shaping molten steel, faltered on lute strings. <words>110</words>  
Her last attempt had shattered three tuning forks. <words>117</words>  

The star dimmed further. <words>119</words>  
Lira sprinted into the factory, keys jangling, and slammed the rust-eaten door with a spell-seal. <words>135</words>  
Dust-choked chalkboards lined the walls, their half-erased symbols mirroring the ones she’d memorized. <words>150</words>  
“Not music,” she realized, breathless. <words>154</words>  
“*Rhythm.*” <words>155</words>  
Her hammer struck the anvil—once, twice—a metallic heartbeat echoing through the derelict hall. <words>170</words>  
Sparks bloomed where iron met iron, each flash illuminating chalked formulae. <words>182</words>  

Keys glowed on her ring, one detaching to float midair as the hammer’s cadence quickened. <words>198</words>  
Lira’s sleeves smoldered from stray embers, but she didn’t flinch. <words>211</words>  
Chaos wasn’t patient. <words>213</words>  
The key twisted, its mechanism clicking open a compartment beneath the anvil, revealing three obsidian seeds. <words>231</words>  
“Grow,” she pleaded, hurling them into the furnace’s maw. <words>240</words>  
Smoke billowed, thickening into vines that burst through cracks in the walls, strangling the factory’s decay. <words>257</words>  

Outside, the lavender field gasped awake, petals shedding gray to blaze violet under the lone star’s gaze. <words>276</words>  
Lira laughed, sharp with terror and triumph, as thorns coiled around her ankles. <words>290</words>  
Regrowth was not gentle. <words>293</words>  
The chalkboards trembled, equations rewriting themselves in her mind: *To remake is to surrender*. <words>308</words>  
She gripped the hammer tighter. <words>313</words>  
Metal shrieked as the factory’s bones reforged, iron roses erupting from collapsed beams. <words>329</words>  

When the last note of her hammer faded, the star blazed steady, its light glinting on dew-kissed lavender. <words>347</words>  
Lira slumped against the anvil, her keyring cold again, and hummed a tuneless melody. <words>362</words>  
Chaos lingered beyond the field—she heard it in the wind’s restless howl—but for now, the seeds held. <words>381</words>  
Her hands shook as she pocketed a shard of chalk, its faint glyphs already whispering of the next unraveling. <words>399</words>  
Fear prickled her throat, yet she smiled. <words>406</words>  
Some joys were fiercer for being borrowed from the dark. <words>416</words>  
Above, the star watched, silent and unyielding, as the world spun toward dawn. <words>430</words>
