The mariner’s spyglass felt heavier each time Mara lifted it, its brass worn smooth by hands long dust. <words>20</words> She perched on the edge of her post-apocalyptic rooftop farm, where bean vines clawed at solar panels and the air smelled of thyme and decay. <words>45</words> Below, the city sprawled like a carcass, but through the lens, she traced constellations—or what remained of them—her late-blooming resolve hardening. <words>70</words> They called her softly militant, this woman who organized crop rotations with tactical precision, who’d once coerce(d) a scavenger at knifepoint to reveal where he’d found the spyglass. <words>95</words> “In the attics,” he’d gasped, and she’d spent weeks scouring dusty attics herself, knee-deep in relics, until she found it wrapped in a navigator’s journal stained with saltwater. <words>126</words>  

The journal spoke of cosmic balance, of tides governed by laws older than gods, and Mara had wept—not for the lost oceans, but because its author was her father. <words>154</words> His handwriting, angular and urgent, dissected gravitational symmetries, and now she gripped his spyglass tighter, as if it could anchor her between the first tear she’d shed over his empty grave and the final sigh she’d exhale when this ended. <words>192</words> A reluctant awe thickened her throat; the sky, fractured by the Collapse, shimmered with rogue particles that made stars weep streaks of violet. <words>216</words>  

“You’re chasing ghosts,” Kael said, his voice a rasp from the stairwell. <words>229</words> The last surviving astrophysicist—or so he claimed—leaned against a rainwater barrel, his face gaunt under the greenhouse lamps. <words>249</words> Mara didn’t lower the spyglass. <words>254</words> “The journal calculated a stabilization point. If we align the rooftop arrays during the solstice—” <words>273</words>  

“You’ll what? Reverse entropy?” He laughed, a sound like splintering wood. <words>287</words> “Even if you’re right, the cost…” <words>294</words>  

She turned, the spyglass clattering against her chest. <words>303</words> “You think I don’t know the gravity of loss?” <words>313</words> Her fingers brushed the scar on her wrist, a relic of the riots after the skies caught fire. <words>330</words> Kael flinched, but she pressed on, relentless. <words>339</words> “Help me recalibrate the arrays. Or I’ll broadcast that you hoarded antibiotics.” <words>355</words> Coercion tasted bitter, but the journal’s equations demanded sacrifice. <words>367</words>  

Dawn bled into the horizon as they worked, aligning mirrors to harness the fractured light. <words>383</words> Mara’s hands trembled—not from fatigue, but the dread of being right. <words>396</words> When the first beam pierced the atmosphere, Kael gasped. <words>407</words> The spyglass revealed it: a shimmering lattice, the architecture of cosmic balance, knitting itself back together. <words>426</words> But as the ground quaked and the rooftop groaned, Mara understood the truth—to mend the sky, they’d become anchors. <words>448</words>  

“It’s using us,” Kael whispered, his voice fraying. <words>457</words> She nodded, the spyglass slipping from her grip as the light consumed them, their bodies dissolving into the calculus of equilibrium. <words>478</words> The last thing she felt wasn’t fear, but a reluctant awe: the world would heal, its balance paid in the currency of their sighs. <words>500</words>
