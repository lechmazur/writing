<story>  
The sullen farmer knelt in his drought-cracked field, fingertips brushing the frayed edges of a quilt sprawled over brittle soil—a relic stitched from mismatched patches, each a faded country his ancestors had fled. <words>38</words>  
Beneath its threads lay his inheritance: a cigar box crammed with used postage stamps, their cancellations smudged by time, borders dissolved under ink. <words>64</words>  
"Erasing boundaries," his grandmother had rasped, pressing the box into his hands before she died, though he’d dismissed it as the ramblings of a woman who’d never farmed a day in her life. <words>97</words>  
Now, staring at the stamps’ blurred frontiers, he felt a reckless zest ignite—a compulsion to abandon the dead-end furrows and dive into the reservoir that had swallowed his family’s old stories whole. <words>130</words>  

The underwater city revealed itself in algae-filtered gloom, its art deco power station humming with dormant currents that prickled his skin like static. <words>158</words>  
Rusted turbines formed a cathedral of decay, yet the quilt patches glowed in his pack, their threadbare geometries mirroring the station’s labyrinthine corridors. <words>183</words>  
"Objectively biased," he muttered, acknowledging how the quilt’s arbitrary seams now felt like a map, how the stamps’ dissolved borders whispered of connections deeper than soil. <words>211</words>  
His flashlight beam caught a control panel crusted in mollusks, its switches aligned in a pattern matching the quilt’s central patch—a jagged tessellation of what might have been Poland, or Pennsylvania. <words>244</words>  

When he pressed the sequence, turbines groaned awake, their vibrations shuddering through the reservoir to his parched fields above. <words>263</words>  
Water surged through ancient pipes, irrigating his crops with unintended bounty, while the stamps in his pocket grew warm, their adhesive clinging like ancestral fingerprints. <words>289</words>  
In that moment of pure inspiration—borrowed valor from generations who’d crossed oceans without maps—he understood the quilt’s true function: not to commemorate exiles, but to dissolve the lie of separateness. <words>324</words>  
The power station’s lights flared, erasing boundaries between drowned and living, past and present, as his withering corn straightened into a salute. <words>347</words>  

He emerged drenched, not in reservoir filth, but in the salt of a hundred stamped letters never sent. <words>364</words>  
The farm could rot now; its soil had been a coffin for borrowed dreams. <words>378</words>  
Stuffing the quilt into his pack, he turned toward the highway, each stamp a potential destination, each patch a compass point unmoored from geography. <words>403</words>  
Behind him, the reactivated station thrummed, its electricity knitting fractured aquifers, while ahead, the horizon blurred—no longer a limit, but an invitation. <words>429</words>  

Walking away felt like flying. <words>432</words>
