<story>  
In the submarine gloom of the underwater city planning office, where blueprints floated like jellyfish in brine-filled tubes, the meek blacksmith named Elvan traced a calloused finger over his softcover dictionary’s frayed edges. <words>40</words>  
The tome—openly hidden beneath a stack of permits for coral demolition—contained not definitions, but fragments of vows from souls who’d bargained with the tides, their promises etched in ink that shimmered like bioluminescence. <words>81</words>  
Elvan’s task, assigned across the hush of time’s final ripple, was to ignite the city’s dormant geothermal core by verifying half-baked stories from random hitchhikers, their truths the only kindling hot enough to melt the ice sealing the furnace. <words>127</words>  
But the core demanded a grimmer fuel: heartbreak, liquefied and piped through quartz veins, a resource Elvan had vowed to harness after the ocean claimed his daughter during the last zoning dispute over abyssal homesteads. <words>168</words>  

Today’s hitchhiker floated in, seaweed braided into her hair and lies dripping like brine from her tongue. <words>187</words>  
“I outran a leviathan in the kelp forests,” she declared, but Elvan’s dictionary remained dull, its pages silent. <words>205</words>  
“The truth,” he murmured, voice echoing through copper pipes, “or the city freezes by dawn.” <words>221</words>  
Her defiance crumpled. <words>224</words>  
“I… I lured it to swallow my brother’s debtors.” Her whisper seared the paper, letters curling into smoke. <words>244</words>  
The dictionary glowed—a half-truth verified—and Elvan’s hammer struck the valve, channeling her guilt into the pipes. <words>264</words>  

Memories surged: his daughter’s laughter as she sketched gardens on trench walls, the council’s verdict, her defiant swim into the untamed depths. <words>288</words>  
His grief had weight here, a currency thicker than seawater. <words>300</words>  
Each hitchhiker’s confession deepened the ache, each verified story inching the core’s temperature upward, yet the unfinished bargain loomed—Elvan’s oath to the city demanded he sacrifice his own sorrow last, extinguishing his right to mourn. <words>343</words>  

At the final hour, a hitchhiker arrived with eyes like phosphorescent plankton. <words>356</words>  
“I’ve come to repay a debt,” he said, pressing a slip of kelp parchment into Elvan’s hands—his daughter’s last letter, salvaged from a hagfish’s nest. <words>379</words>  
Her words, unreadable for years, now blazed in the dictionary’s light: *“Forgive them, Papa. Let it warm you.”* <words>398</words>  
Elvan’s tears fell onto the furnace controls. <words>405</words>  
The core roared alive, powered not by vengeance, but by the luminous regret of a heartbreak surrendered, its heat rising through the city like a requiem. <words>432</words>  
In the planning office, the softcover dictionary closed softly, its bargain fulfilled, as time’s ripple carried Elvan’s whisper into the endless black. <words>455</words>
