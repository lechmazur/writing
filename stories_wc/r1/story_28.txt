The abandoned carnival’s bumper car arena creaked under the weight of decades, its rusted tracks cradling the sly agent as she knelt beside a tarnished fork half-buried in gravel. <words>30</words> Her gloved fingers trembled—not from the autumn chill, but from the realization that this *oddly usual* utensil was the key to archiving the Hollow Creek region’s vanishing folklore. <words>63</words> According to her grandmother’s tales, the fork had once been wielded by the “Feast Weaver,” a mythical figure said to stitch harvest blessings into the soil… if one knew the right rituals. <words>99</words> But time had reduced the legend to fragments, like the puzzle pieces her family had volunteered to collect every equinox, a tradition as frayed as the carnival’s faded banners. <words>132</words>  

A gust swept through the arena, scattering leaves and the last shreds of her resolve. <words>149</words> The final puzzle piece—a ceramic shard etched with the Weaver’s sigil—slipped from her pocket, clattering toward a drainpipe. <words>170</words> She lunged, her desperation sharp as the fork’s tines. <words>180</words> *Cede nothing*, her father had insisted during their last volunteer mission, his voice blending with the carnival’s ghostly laughter. <words>200</words> Yet here she was, bargaining with shadows. <words>207</words>  

The drainpipe swallowed the shard, its descent echoing like a dirge. <words>218</words> But then—a glint. <words>220</words> The fork’s handle, pressed against the pipe’s rim, began to hum. <words>231</words> It wasn’t just a relic; it was a compass, attuned to the land’s whispered memories. <words>245</words> She traced its grooves, mimicking the motions her grandmother had taught her—three spins counterclockwise, a tap to the earth—and the arena shuddered. <words>268</words> Bumper cars jolted to life, their sparks painting the Weaver’s sigil in the air. <words>282</words>  

“You’re just stories,” she muttered, though her pulse raced as the sigil solidified into a map. <words>297</words> Each glowing node marked a forgotten ritual: the cornfield dances, the ash-and-honey offerings, the songs sung backward to ward off frost. <words>318</words> But the map was fading, the fork’s power waning. <words>328</words> To preserve it, she’d have to cede it to the county archives, severing her family’s centuries-old stewardship. <words>345</words>  

A child’s laughter rang out—a local girl, drawn by the lights. <words>356</words> The agent froze. <words>358</words> *This is why you volunteer*, her mother had once said, *so the stories outlive us*. <words>371</words> With a gritted smile, she snapped the fork against the sigil, imprinting its patterns into the gravel. <words>387</words> Let the archivists decipher it; let the girl carry the tale. <words>399</words>  

As dawn bleached the sky, the agent walked away, her pockets empty but her phone brimming with photos. <words>416</words> The last puzzle piece was gone, but the folklore—scattered, fragile, alive—was no longer hers to hoard. <words>433</words>
