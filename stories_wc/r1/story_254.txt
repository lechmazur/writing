The deserted playground crouched at the wilderness’s fraying edge, its swing chains rusted into whispers, while Victor Spangler—a comedic actor who’d forgotten how to laugh—balanced a dried-out inkwell on the tip of his boot. <words>38</words> He’d received it last Tuesday, an “objectively personal” retirement gift from his agent, who’d mistaken Victor’s grim silence for profundity rather than the simmering dread of irrelevance. <words>76</words> Unwanted gifts cluttered Victor’s life: scripts for roles he’d outgrown, fan letters addressed to characters he’d euthanized onstage, and now this inkwell, its hollow throat choked with dust—a metaphor he refused to dissect. <words>118</words>  

Through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry, Victor returned daily to the playground, its skeletal slide pointing accusingly at the stars. <words>143</words> His mission, absurd yet urgent, consumed him: to bottle a star’s dying breath before it winked out, a feat he believed might reignite the cosmic joke of his career. <words>172</words> Each dusk, he unscrewed a mason jar salvaged from his attic and aimed it skyward, only to concede, again, that starlight slipped through fingers like smoke. <words>199</words>  

Persistent daydream loops plagued him. <words>203</words> In one, he stood ovation-deep in velvet curtains, clutching not an Oscar but a jar of astral gas, the audience’s laughter curdling as the star inside suffocated. <words>229</words> In another, his mother—dead a decade—handed him the inkwell, saying, “You’ve always preferred empty vessels.” <words>249</words> Victor woke from these reveries sweating, the inkwell’s weight in his pocket like a tombstone. <words>266</words>  

Tonight, the wilderness exhaled frost as a meteor scarred the sky. <words>278</words> Victor lurched forward, jar aloft, but tripped on a root, the inkwell shattering against a seesaw. <words>294</words> Amid the shards, a slip of paper fluttered—his agent’s handwriting: “For the roles you’ll write yourself.” <words>313</words> Victor stared at the debris, the absurdity crystallizing. <words>324</words> Unwanted gifts were just unanswered questions; the inkwell wasn’t a eulogy but a blank page. <words>343</words>  

He lay back, the cold earth seeping into his bones, and let the daydream loop once more. <words>358</words> This time, he sat at a desk, the inkwell brimming, his hand moving not for applause but for the star’s last gasp trapped in his jar—a punchline only the universe understood. <words>388</words> When dawn came, Victor pocketed a shard of the inkwell and left the jar unlit on the seesaw, its lid open. <words>409</words> Some breaths, he decided, weren’t meant to be bottled—they were meant to dissolve into the wind, stitching the wilderness’s silence back together. <words>436</words>  

As he walked away, the playground’s ghosts swung gently, and Victor Spangler, humorless no more, chuckled at the sky’s unscripted punchline. <words>458</words>
