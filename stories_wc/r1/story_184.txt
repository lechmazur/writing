<story>  
Jax, the scrappy tavern-hand with dirt perpetually wedged beneath his nails, swept shattered seashells into a rusted tin bucket, each fragment clinking like a half-remembered melody. <words>34</words>  
The Broken Tide Inn hadn’t seen the ocean in decades, but its patrons still traded stories of fossilized footprints in the dried-up riverbed outside—whispers of a path that led *somewhere else*. <words>68</words>  
"Predictably unpredictable," Jax muttered, tossing a shell shard into the air; it veered left instead of right, defying gravity just long enough to feel intentional. <words>96</words>  
That’s when the vacuum chamber garden appeared—or maybe it’d always been there, its glass dome humming as ferns curled backward into seeds and sunlight unraveled into starlight. <words>128</words>  
Time’s sands were flowing backward here, and Jax’s boots sank into the riverbed’s ancient mud, following footprints that *led nowhere* unless you walked them in reverse. <words>157</words>  
The shells in his bucket rattled, their edges sharpening into keys as he entered the garden, where orchids bloomed into buds and his own breath fractured into syllables he hadn’t spoken yet. <words>191</words>  
"Catapult imagination beyond known realms, they said," he scoffed, kicking a pebble that ricocheted into a time-twisted oak, its rings counting upward. <words>215</words>  
But the call was inescapable: the shells now glowed, mapping constellations on the chamber’s walls, each shard a star in a sky that hadn’t existed since the river drowned. <words>244</words>  
Jax randomized his steps—left, right, diagonal—mimicking the shells’ chaos, and the garden shuddered, spitting out a clockwork sparrow that disassembled mid-flight. <words>271</words>  
"Flippant solemnity," he declared, bowing to the collapsing bird, because laughing felt too much like surrender. <words>287</words>  
The footprints deepened, guiding him to a pedestal where the final shell fragment hovered, its edges humming with the static of unformed worlds. <words>309</words>  
He slotted it into the collection, and the chamber inhaled—time snapped forward, then back, then *sideways*, and Jax glimpsed the tavern as it might be: ceilings smeared with bioluminescent algae, patrons floating mid-toast, their laughter crystallized. <words>350</words>  
"Not bad," he lied, because awe tasted too much like fear. <words>360</words>  
The garden’s air thinned, and Jax realized the truth: to escape, he had to *want* to stay, to let the reversed sands bury him until his own footsteps fossilized. <words>388</words>  
He scattered the shells like dice, their fractures aligning into a bridge of light—a path through the vacuum, where imagination wasn’t a leap but a landslide. <words>414</words>  
As the dome shattered, Jax fell upward, unmoored, the shells’ song stitching his shadow to the stars. <words>432</words>  
Behind him, the riverbed sighed, its footprints filling with seawater and possibility. <words>445</words>  
The inn would keep. For now, there were realms to unbreak. <words>457</words>
