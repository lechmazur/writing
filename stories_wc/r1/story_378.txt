Mayor Thaddeus Grimsby, a wiry man with a perpetual scowl, never wanted power—he’d become the town’s leader by accidentally tripping into the election booth’s inkwell, staining his rival’s ballot beyond recognition. <words>38</words> Now, as dawn’s pale fingers pried apart the night, he stood ankle-deep in the polluted muck of the swamp orchard, watching the last carnival wagons creak away. <words>70</words> The monks who tended the blighted trees moved like shadows among the skeletal branches, their whispered prayers drowned by the croak of poisoned frogs. <words>99</words>  

Yesterday, in the clatter of the Crow’s Nest Café, Thaddeus had overheard two robed figures murmuring about “water wisdom” and a “clockwork key.” <words>126</words> Curiosity—or fate—had dragged him here, though he’d never admit it. <words>140</words> “This is idiotic,” he grumbled, kicking a rotten apple. <words>149</words> It burst open, revealing a glint of brass: a clockwork beetle, its carapace etched with spirals resembling water currents. <words>172</words>  

One of the monks materialized beside him, her face weathered as swamp cypress. <words>185</words> “It chooses who wakes it,” she said, nodding at the beetle. <words>197</words> Thaddeus snorted. <words>198</words> “I’ve got enough problems without babysitting junk.” <words>206</words> Yet his calloused thumb brushed the beetle’s spine—and it whirred to life, unfolding wings that hummed like river song. <words>229</words>  

The monk’s eyes gleamed. <words>232</words> “The orchard’s sickness is fate’s design… but water wisdom teaches that even poison can metamorphose.” <words>249</words> Thaddeus scowled deeper. <words>252</words> Fate? <words>253</words> He’d spent years cursing this swamp, these people, his own rotten luck. <words>265</words> But the beetle now hovered above his palm, directing him toward a stagnant pool choked with algae. <words>285</words>  

Gritting his teeth, he waded in. <words>290</words> The beetle dove beneath the green scum, and the water began to churn. <words>303</words> Roots erupted from the depths, coiling around his legs—not to drag him under, but to anchor him as the pool shuddered. <words>327</words> The algae dissolved into luminescent silt, revealing clear water that mirrored the pinkening sky. <words>345</words>  

“It’s… working?” Thaddeus muttered, incredulous. <words>352</words> The monk joined him, her voice soft. <words>359</words> “The beetle isn’t a key. <words>363</words> It’s a mirror. <words>365</words> You must want the change enough to see it through.” <words>375</words> He almost laughed. <words>378</words> Wanting things was for fools—yet here he was, chest tight with something like hope. <words>397</words>  

As sunlight pierced the swamp, the orchard groaned. <words>405</words> Bark split, not with rot, but with new buds unfurling silver leaves. <words>419</words> Frogs leaped, their bellies now jewel-blue, and the monks’ chants swelled into a hymn Thaddeus felt in his bones. <words>440</words> The beetle settled on his shoulder, its gears quiet. <words>450</words>  

“Hmph,” he grunted, wiping sludge from his boots. <words>458</words> “Still a cesspool. <words>461</words> Just… shinier.” <words>464</words> But his hands trembled. <words>468</words> For the first time, the weight of his accidental title felt less like a trap and more like a seed, cracked open and reaching. <words>495</words> Dawn broke fully, and Thaddeus Grimsby, lovably grumpy savior of nothing, allowed himself a single, awed smile. <words>518</words>
