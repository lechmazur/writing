<story>  
The vivid dreamer stepped into the enchanted orchard, her fingers brushing the cold, grooved faces of her pressed penny collection—each flattened copper a stolen memory from realms she’d slipped through in sleep. <words>34</words>  
Around her, living statues polished to obsidian gleam pivoted with mechanical precision, their hollow eyes oscillating between vigilance and something like dour amusement as they patrolled the moonlit rows. <words>69</words>  
She’d come here, as always, to unravel the ultimate cosmic deception: the lie that her dreams were mere figments, not fractures in reality. <words>91</words>  
Tonight, though, the orchard hummed differently. <words>97</words>  
The patient guardian—a statue older than the others, its stony face weathered into a smirk—blocked her path, one arm extended to reveal a palm etched with constellations. <words>127</words>  
"Riddles," it intoned, voice gravel grinding, "or routes?" <words>135</words>  
The dreamer hesitated at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken, guilt gnawing: last week, she’d pocketed a pear from this grove, and the trees had wept silver. <words>164</words>  
Instead, she laid seven pennies on its palm, their imprints aligning to form a map. <words>178</words>  
"Both," she said, rationally mischievous, "since moon paths favor the literal-minded." <words>190</words>  
The guardian’s laugh cracked like splitting marble. <words>196</words>  
It stamped the coins into its chest, and the ground shuddered, revealing a tunnel where roots glowed like veins of liquid twilight. <words>219</words>  
Down they descended, the guardian’s gait oscillating between menace and mentorship, until the walls opened into a cavern where trees grew upside-down, fruit dangling like chandeliers. <words>248</words>  
"Here’s the joke," the guardian said, plucking a fig that dissolved into smoke. <words>262</words>  
"Your ‘deception’ is a toddler’s tantrum—the cosmos never lied. You just refused to see the strings." <words>280</words>  
The dreamer froze. <words>282</words>  
Above, the statues’ footsteps drummed a warning; she’d overstayed. <words>293</words>  
But the guardian pressed a new penny into her hand—a miniature of itself, winking—and nudged her toward a crevice where moonlight pooled. <words>320</words>  
"Follow the paths, little thief. Apologize to the orchard when you’re ready to stop stealing truths and start planting them." <words>341</words>  
As she fled, the tunnel collapsed behind her, and she awoke clutching the penny, its edges sharp with unfinished business. <words>363</words>  
The orchard, she realized, wasn’t a puzzle to solve but a mirror: her obsession with unraveling had woven tighter knots. <words>387</words>  
That evening, she returned, apology hot on her tongue, and found the guardian waiting with a sapling—its leaves stamped with tiny, familiar faces. <words>415</words>  
"Took you long enough," it grumbled, but the statues bowed as she planted the tree, its roots drinking the moon paths dry. <words>439</words>  
When dawn came, the orchard stood unchanged, yet the dreamer’s pennies now jingled with the weight of futures, not pasts. <words>460</words>  
And the guardian, ever patient, resumed its watch, its smirk softened by something like pride. <words>478</words>
