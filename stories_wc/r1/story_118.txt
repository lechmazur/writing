The hive-mind therapist adjusted their neural headset, its frayed wires brushing against the scuffed phone charger plug lodged permanently in the facility’s sole functioning outlet. <words>28</words> Around them, the secret agent training facility hummed with the sound of hindsight—a low, persistent ringing like forgotten alarms echoing through the vents. <words>56</words> “Uniformly peculiar,” muttered the therapist, surveying the recruits’ brainwave patterns flickering across cracked monitors, each mind a fractured chorus in the collective. <words>85</words> Tonight, they would drain the cacophony before it destabilized the hive entirely. <words>97</words>  

A candle guttered on the steel desk, wax pooling into glyphs only the therapist could decipher. <words>113</words> Through the slow drip of coded shapes, they’d anchor the ephemeral in reality—memories, instincts, all the intangible flotsam threatening to dissolve. <words>133</words> The eve of a bold discovery demanded clarity; tomorrow, the recruits would infiltrate a quantum server, and fractured minds risked lethal feedback. <words>157</words> A bitter laugh escaped the therapist. <words>162</words> Sacrificing sanity for secrets was the job, but the merry bitterness of it all still stung. <words>180</words>  

One recruit’s psyche flared on the screen—a boy who’d forgotten his own name, his thoughts dissolving into static. <words>199</words> The therapist pressed a hand to the cold glass, syncing with the hive. <words>213</words> Voices flooded in: a sister’s laughter, a gun’s recoil, the taste of lithium batteries chewed raw during interrogation training. <words>232</words> They let the candle wax cool into a labyrinthine map, each twist a decision point, each dead end a trauma to cauterize. <words>253</words>  

Midnight approached. <words>254</words> The plug sparked faintly, its frayed prongs mirroring the recruits’ synaptic overload. <words>268</words> Through the night air seeped a discordant melody—the sound of hindsight crescendoing as the hive strained. <words>286</words> The therapist inhaled sharply; the wax had hardened into a spiraling mandala, its center hollow. <words>303</words> A placeholder for what was missing. <words>309</words>  

They unplugged the charger, its plastic warm with misuse, and pressed it into the wax. <words>327</words> The hive gasped. <words>329</words> Memories crystallized: the boy’s name was Emil, he’d stolen strawberries at six, he feared drowning more than fire. <words>348</words> The therapist’s headset flared as the drain commenced, siphoning chaos into the candle’s code. <words>366</words> Collective whispers condensed into a single truth—the server’s coordinates, yes, but also the weight of a mother’s last hug. <words>391</words>  

Dawn tinged the sky when the therapist slumped back, the candle now a skeletal spire. <words>409</words> The recruits slept, their minds temporarily whole. <words>418</words> The plug lay buried in wax, another relic in a long line of anchors. <words>434</words> Success, but the therapist’s mouth curled with merry bitterness. <words>445</words> They’d bought the hive another day, yet the sound of hindsight lingered, a requiem for all they’d erased to keep reality intact. <words>470</words>  

Outside, wind carried the ashes of coded shapes into the morning, as the facility braced for discovery. <words>488</words>
