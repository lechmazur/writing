The disused railway station breathed through its ivy-clad ribs, sunlight filtering green through leaves that whispered of forgotten departures. <words>24</words>  
Elias, the dreamy poet whose verses had once incited a formally rebellious salon to burn their tax ledgers in a fountain, stood amid the ruins, a brass sundial cradled in his hands like a stolen heart. <words>58</words>  
It had arrived that morning, sealed with a wax emblem of intersecting triangles—a cipher he’d compulsively sketched since solving the last riddle: *Follow the shadow where no light falls.* <words>89</words>  
The letter remained unopened, its cryptic shapes mirroring the sundial’s tarnished engravings, as though time itself had pressed the answer into wax. <words>113</words>  
“To stand by the unremembered,” he murmured, recalling his oath after the salon’s dissolution—a promise to give voice to relics the world had erased. <words>137</words>  
But the sundial’s gnomon was bent, its numerals flecked with lichen, and Elias felt the weight of a delicate undoing in his palms: this was no mere artifact. <words>163</words>  
It was a key. <words>166</words>  

He placed it on the platform where the noon sun struck, and the shadow fell not forward or backward, but *through* the cracks in the wood, as if pointing beneath the station. <words>200</words>  
Crouching, he pried up a rotted plank, revealing a compartment caked in coal dust. <words>216</words>  
Inside lay a child’s leather satchel, its contents—a moth-eaten scarf, a ticket stub dated 1912, and a photograph of a woman standing where he now stood—stained with tea or tears. <words>247</words>  
The sundial’s maker, perhaps. <words>251</words>  
Her eyes, even in sepia, held the quietly intense defiance of someone who’d etched time into brass to say, *I existed here*. <words>274</words>  

The wax seal suddenly burned in his pocket. <words>280</words>  
He broke it, the triangles splitting to reveal a single line: *“Compel the past to meet its shadow.”* <words>298</words>  
As wind stirred the ivy, Elias realized the sundial wasn’t meant to measure hours—it mapped the station’s decay, each corroded numeral a year the world had ignored this place. <words>332</words>  
The woman had hidden her rebellion here, a ledger of absence. <words>345</words>  

He pocketed the photograph and climbed the signal tower, its stairs groaning. <words>358</words>  
From the top, the station became a spine of rust, the tracks buried under dandelions. <words>375</words>  
Unfurling the scarf, he tied it to the railing, where it fluttered like a pennant. <words>391</words>  
Below, the sundial’s shadow stretched toward the horizon, no longer trapped by its own geometry. <words>409</words>  

The unopened letter, he now understood, was never meant to be read—only to lead him here, to this act of witness. <words>433</words>  
As the scarf danced in the wind, Elias whispered the woman’s name, plucking it from the air where the trains once roared. <words>455</words>  
Somewhere, a clock struck, though no clock remained. <words>464</words>  
Time, at last, curved into a circle. <words>471</words>
