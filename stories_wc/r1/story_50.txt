<story>  
The glass desert shimmered like a shattered cathedral, its dunes frozen into jagged peaks that refracted the setting sun into prismatic lies. <words>25</words>  
Ezekiel knelt, his fingers brushing the tarnished silver fork buried in the sand—a relic from the feast where he’d last tasted certainty. <words>44</words>  
Above, the final monarch butterfly traced a trembling path southward, its wings frayed as scripture pages. <words>61</words>  
“Capriciously consistent,” he muttered, the phrase clinging like grit to his throat. <words>73</words>  
The fork’s tarnish mirrored his faith: once luminous, now corroded by questions even his prayers couldn’t scour. <words>89</words>  

He’d come to conceal the fork here, where the desert’s song might drown its accusations. <words>103</words>  
But the untuned piano emerged instead—a skeletal behemoth half-submerged in glass, its keys cracked teeth grinning at the sky. <words>122</words>  
When the wind struck, discordant echoes spilled forth, vibrating through Ezekiel’s boots like Morse code from God’s throat. <words>138</words>  
He traced the soundwaves in the sand, decoding patterns that mapped not to divine geometry, but to the butterfly’s erratic flight. <words>156</words>  

Three nights prior, the vision had come: become magic’s conduit, or let the world unravel with the butterfly’s last wingbeat. <words>175</words>  
Yet how could he channel wonder when his own soul was a boarded-up chapel? <words>188</words>  
The piano’s next gust-shriek carved symbols into the air—a language of fractures. <words>201</words>  
Ezekiel pressed the fork against a rusted string, and the desert answered. <words>213</words>  

Glass dunes shifted, revealing a labyrinth of mirrors beneath the sand. <words>223</words>  
In their reflections, he saw not his sunburned face, but the fork’s true form: a key, forged to unlock the conduit. <words>242</words>  
His hands shook. To use it meant surrendering to forces older than scripture, wilder than prayer. <words>257</words>  
The monarch dipped low, its shadow brushing the piano—a benediction. <words>268</words>  

He played the fork along the strings, each dissonant chord rewriting his bones. <words>280</words>  
The mirrors sang back, their shards rearranging into a spire of liquid light. <words>293</words>  
Here was the test: enter the spire carrying all his doubts, or preserve his hollow certainty. <words>308</words>  
Ezekiel stepped into the light, and the fork dissolved, its tarnish becoming stardust in his veins. <words>325</words>  

The desert held its breath. <words>328</words>  
In the spire’s heart hung a single note—the monarch’s chrysalis, pulsing with unborn magic. <words>343</words>  
“I’m no vessel,” Ezekiel whispered, but his voice had become the wind through piano wires. <words>358</words>  
When the chrysalis split, it wasn’t a butterfly that emerged, but a constellation shaped like a fork. <words>376</words>  

Lightning coursed through him, scouring without mercy. <words>383</words>  
He understood now: faith wasn’t a shield, but a wound kept open. <words>395</words>  
As the spire collapsed into singing glass, Ezekiel laughed—a sound both broken and boundless. <words>410</words>  
The monarch alighted on his palm, its wings now mirroring the fork’s celestial map, and together they walked into the desert’s burning throat. <words>435</words>
