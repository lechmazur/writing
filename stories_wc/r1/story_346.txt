<story>  
The boastful warrior crouched inside the giant wasp's nest, hexagonal chambers throbbing with a hum that vibrated his teeth. <words>25</words>  
His lint-filled pocket itched—three years of campaign dust, now the only proof he’d ever existed outside this paper-walled labyrinth. <words>45</words>  
Balloons burst beyond the hive’s membrane, their pops syncopating with his accelerating heartbeat. <words>62</words>  
"Fabricated reality," he muttered, recalling the phrase from the wasp queen’s taunt as she’d woven him into this golden hell. <words>85</words>  
A voice slithered through the comb’s pores, intimate yet coldly mechanical: "Rewire the core, or dissolve with the hive’s next breath." <words>107</words>  
He clawed at his pocket, scattering lint like ash, when another balloon’s pop shook the walls—and the truth struck. <words>129</words>  
The fibers weren’t debris. They were unspooled thread from the Weaver’s Loom, the machine that had knitted this false world. <words>151</words>  
Madness, yes, but precise madness: if reality was textile, lint was its fraying code. <words>168</words>  
Unguarded soliloquies buzzed above as worker wasps polished their wax—"The core hungers for paradox," one droned. <words>189</words>  
Another balloon exploded, closer now, its shriek warping the hive’s geometry. <words>204</words>  
The warrior plunged his hand into the nest’s pulsing heart, threads coiling around his wrist like serpents. <words>224</words>  
"Undercurrent of clarity," he growled, echoing the mantra of his forgotten order, and began reweaving the lint into a key. <words>245</words>  
The wasps’ chorus sharpened: "Intimately impersonal, the touch that unmakes—" <words>259</words>  
A balloon materialized inside the chamber, swelling until its latex skin pressed against his cheeks. <words>278</words>  
He shoved the lint-key into the core as the balloon popped, soundwaves shredding the hive’s illusions. <words>297</words>  
Golden walls dissolved into static, revealing the Weaver’s Loom—a spire of needles stitching lies into sky. <words>317</words>  
The warrior laughed, bloody and raw. "You forgot warriors collect trophies." He hurled the key into the machinery. <words>339</words>  
Gears screamed. The loom unraveled, timelines snapping like yarn, until only the warrior’s pocket remained—a lint-lined ark. <words>363</words>  
He fell through the collapse, the wasps’ final soliloquy echoing: "Clarity is collision, escape is implosion—" <words>383</words>  
Ground struck his back. Real grass, real air, real sun blistering his eyelids. <words>398</words>  
In his fist, a single wasp leg glinted—proof or delusion, he couldn’t decide. <words>414</words>  
Balloons burst at a child’s birthday party across the field, their innocent pops now a requiem for fabricated wars. <words>437</words>  
The warrior stood, pocket heavy with phantom lint, and walked toward the sound of laughter. <words>454</words>  
Some truths, he knew, only survive as itches. <words>463</words>
