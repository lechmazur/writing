The ruthless flower arranger known as Marigold Voss arrived at the mysterious stone circle at twilight, her scuffed plastic comb tucked like a dagger into her belt. <words>25</words>  
She’d driven six hours fueled by polite anarchy—stealing gas-station orchids, bribing a folk singer for directions—to decode the weathered rock art spiraling the monoliths. <words>49</words>  
“Symbols aren’t decor,” she muttered, tracing a lichen-crusted carving of a stag, her intellect sparking spontaneous hypotheses: migration maps? Star alignments? Forgotten taxonomies? <words>75</words>  
A harmonica’s warble interrupted; the roadside singer she’d encountered earlier leaned against a menhir, grinning. <words>91</words>  
“Still hunting ghosts, Ms. Voss?” he asked, his voice lingering in the pause between verses. <words>104</words>  
Marigold bristled. <words>105</words>  
“I distinguish patterns,” she said, flicking her comb to dissect a thorny branch, “unlike your aimless ballads.” <words>120</words>  
He laughed, tossing her a thermos of bitter tea. <words>128</words>  
Their road trip had been accidental—a hitchhiked ride, debates over petroglyphs and chord progressions—but his questions had sharpened her focus. <words>147</words>  
Now, as stars pricked the sky, he said, “What if the watcher’s burden isn’t solving the puzzle, but carrying it?” <words>166</words>  
Marigold froze. <words>167</words>  
Her mentor, the last “watcher” of this site, had died clutching an identical comb, whispering, “It chooses you.” <words>184</words>  
The monoliths hummed. <words>186</words>  
She pressed her palm to the stag carving, and the world split—visions of ancient arrangers weaving flora into constellations, their combs conducting a silent symphony. <words>210</words>  
“It’s a language,” she breathed. <words>214</words>  
“Of course,” the singer said, plucking a chord that mirrored the wind’s pitch. <words>227</words>  
“But languages need speakers.” <words>231</words>  
Marigold’s ruthlessness wavered. <words>234</words>  
She’d spent years mastering control, yet here, spontaneity crackled like static. <words>246</words>  
Snapping her comb through the air, she channeled the visions—arranging thistles, ferns, and stolen orchids into a living mandala at the circle’s heart. <words>268</words>  
The singer drummed rhythm on stone, his melody syncing with her movements. <words>279</words>  
As dawn bled gold, the flora pulsed, shadows twisting into glyphs on the ground: a story of cycles, not conquest. <words>297</words>  
“The watchers don’t decode,” Marigold realized, sweat-damp hair sticking to her neck. <words>309</words>  
“They translate,” the singer finished, voice gentle as a lullaby. <words>319</words>  
She laughed then, sharp and bright, the burden lifting into something like kinship. <words>332</words>  
When park rangers found the stone circle later, they noted the wildflower mandala, a harmonica resting atop weathered rock art—and no sign of the woman or the singer. <words>357</words>  
Rumors sprouted: a duo spotted debating petroglyphs in Arizona, bartering flower arrangements for diesel in Nebraska, their van trailing petals and off-key melodies. <words>379</words>  
Marigold, comb in hand, embraced the chaos, her once-ruthless precision now a dance with the unknown. <words>395</words>  
The watcher’s burden, she decided, was neither weight nor duty, but the audacity to listen—and the courage to reply. <words>414</words>  
Somewhere between a highway’s hum and a singer’s breath between verses, she finally understood. <words>431</words>
