The dog walker for the ultra-rich adjusted her scarf, its frayed edges a carefully careless contrast to the gilded dining room of the haunted mansion. <words>27</words> She’d been summoned at twilight—*when color bleeds from day into night*—to retrieve Mrs. Voss’s borzoi, though the real task, she suspected, lurked in the silent agreements between them. <words>58</words> The air hummed with a loud silence, broken only by the clink of her leash buckle against the mahogany table. <words>77</words>  

“You’ve tended to my botanical collection before,” Mrs. Voss said, materializing from the shadows, her voice like frost on glass. <words>100</words> A blood drive poster curled on the mantel, its crimson logo smudged by humidity. <words>113</words> The dog walker nodded; she’d memorized which orchids thrived on iron-rich water, which ferns wilted at the scent of fear. <words>133</words>  

“Tomorrow’s donors will need… reassurance,” Mrs. Voss continued, stroking the borzoi’s spectral fur. <words>148</words> The unspoken demand coiled between them: *Justify the blood.* Make it noble. Make it *necessary*. <words>163</words> The dog walker’s fingers brushed the vial in her pocket—a petal from the mansion’s black hellebore, toxin enough to still a heart. <words>185</words>  

She’d discovered it weeks ago, pressed into the borzoi’s collar like a warning. <words>197</words> Now, as moonlight fractured through stained glass, she understood: this house fed on more than wealth. <words>215</words> Mrs. Voss’s donors would leave lighter, their vitality siphoned into the soil where the botanical collection writhed. <words>232</words>  

“Fear is a currency here,” the dog walker said, her tone steady as the grandfather clock’s pendulum. <words>248</words> “But you’ve mistaken my profession for cowardice.” <words>257</words> She dropped the hellebore onto the table, its petals bruising the polished wood. <words>270</words> Mrs. Voss’s smile sharpened. <words>274</words>  

The borzoi whined, its leash slithering to the floor. <words>282</words> Outside, the blood drive tents glowed like paper lanterns, volunteers unaware of the mansion’s hunger. <words>298</words> The dog walker stepped closer, her reflection splintering in the silver tea service. <words>313</words> “You want me to lie for you,” she said. <words>322</words> “But I only walk monsters—I don’t justify them.” <words>333</words>  

Mrs. Voss laughed, a sound like roots cracking stone. <words>342</words> “And yet you’re here,” she murmured, “standing where fear dares not tread.” <words>356</words>  

The accusation hung, undeniable. <words>360</words> The dog walker had always returned, hadn’t she? <words>368</words> To the Dobermans with human eyes, the topiaries that whispered in Latin. <words>380</words> To the thrill of outsmarting the dark. <words>387</words>  

She lifted the leash. <words>390</words> “I’ll take the borzoi,” she said, “but your garden dies tonight.” <words>403</words>  

Mrs. Voss inclined her head, a queen conceding a pawn. <words>414</words> As the dog walker led the shivering creature into the indigo dusk, the first scream tore through the mansion—a donor realizing some doors lock forever. <words>442</words> She didn’t look back. <words>445</words> The hellebore’s poison would spread by dawn, and she had other monsters to walk. <words>461</words>
