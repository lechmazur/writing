<story>  
The arctic research greenhouse hummed with unnatural warmth, its glass walls sweating under the gaze of a midnight sun, while outside, children’s laughter from the station’s playground echoed like wind chimes. <words>34</words>  
Ezra, an old-fashioned mage in a moth-eaten frock coat, traced hieroglyphs on a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin—a relic colder than the ice beyond the glass. <words>62</words>  
His purposefully aimless wanderings had led him here, to this nexus of science and silence, where mirrors lining the greenhouse’s support beams flickered with more than light. <words>93</words>  
“Unfolding,” he muttered, watching his reflection in a frost-veiled mirror peel away from him, its eyes hollowed by ancient ink. <words>114</words>  
The riddle had begun at dawn: symbols bleeding through the coffin fragment, demanding a price to claim the uncharted frontier between life and death. <words>138</words>  
Now, amid the dissonance of squeaking swings and shrieking children, the mirrors showed him ephemeral encounters—a pharaoh’s shadow, a desert swallowed by snow, a name etched in breath. <words>169</words>  
Ezra’s gnarled hand hovered over the relic, its gold leaf biting his skin with the chill of curses. <words>186</words>  
“Speak plainly,” he hissed, but the reflections only laughed in static, their voices fragments of a forgotten tongue. <words>204</words>  
A child’s ball bounced against the greenhouse door, and for a heartbeat, the mirrors showed a boy—not his reflection, but a memory: Ezra at seven, cradling a dying sparrow, whispering old words that did nothing. <words>238</words>  
He turned away, the sanctified dread in his chest tightening. <words>246</words>  
The riddle’s answer, he realized, wasn’t in the coffin’s text, but in the greenhouse itself, where Arctic poppies burst through permafrost, defiant and transient. <words>270</words>  
A mirror to his left rippled. <words>274</words>  
Within it, the pharaoh’s shadow pointed to a flower, then to Ezra’s chest. <words>286</words>  
“A life for a frontier,” the mage breathed, understanding. <words>296</words>  
But death repulsed him—not for morality, but for its permanence. <words>308</words>  
Outside, the playground fell silent. <words>312</words>  
In the hush, a fox kitsune, its fur white as the tundra, slunk through a cracked window and nuzzled Ezra’s trembling hand. <words>330</words>  
He stiffened, then relented, cuddling the creature against his ribs, its warmth a counterpoint to the relic’s venom. <words>347</words>  
The mirrors brightened. <words>349</words>  
The kitsune’s eyes held galaxies—and a bargain. <words>357</words>  
“Ephemeral,” Ezra said, voice cracking. <words>363</words>  
He pressed the coffin fragment to the fox’s forehead. <words>372</words>  
Life bled into the gold, not as a sacrifice, but as a shared breath; the greenhouse shuddered, roots cracking floors, mirrors dissolving into starlight. <words>397</words>  
When the light faded, the frontier was his: a realm of frozen blossoms and spectral sands, humming with the kitsune’s purr. <words>417</words>  
Outside, the children resumed their play, unaware of the thinness between worlds. <words>431</words>  
Ezra stood, the relic now a locket around his neck, its weight both anchor and key. <words>445</words>  
Sanctified dread settled into sanctified resolve, as the mirrors, clear once more, reflected not just a mage, but a man unafraid of becoming myth. <words>468</words>
