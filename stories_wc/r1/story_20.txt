The inverted waterfall roared upward into a violet-tinged sky, its crystalline droplets defying gravity as the disappointed archer stood beneath it, her fingers brushing the tarnished silver comb in her pocket. <words>34</words> She’d arrived here by accident—an unplanned stop at this roadside attraction—while fleeing the hollow echo of her last failed shot, the arrow that had missed its mark and shattered a rebellion’s hope. <words>70</words> Above, the celestial bodies waltzed lazily, their slow dance stretching shadows across the Bridge of Regret, a moss-eaten arch spanning the waterfall’s paradoxical plunge. <words>105</words>  

“Anxiously calm,” she muttered, a phrase her mentor had once spat at her when she’d hesitated to document the Salt March riots, her sketches too timid to capture the fury. <words>135</words> Now, her quiver held not arrows but ink vials, her new purpose to chronicle social movements—yet every stroke felt like a lie. <words>158</words> The comb’s teeth snagged on her thumb, its tarnish mirroring the patina of her resolve. <words>172</words>  

A figure emerged on the bridge, silhouetted against the waterfall’s ascent: Kael, the firebrand she’d once loved, whose speeches had ignited the dockside strikes before betrayal silenced him. <words>204</words> Her chest tightened. <words>207</words> This confrontation was inevitable, yet unplanned—like the way he’d once kissed her, sudden and sour with ale. <words>224</words>  

“Still playing scribe?” he called, voice frayed. <words>230</words> “Or just haunting tourist traps?” <words>235</words>  

She climbed the bridge, each step a ledger of years. <words>243</words> The comb grew warm in her grip. <words>248</words> “You told me stories were weapons,” she said. <words>256</words> “But you burned yours.” <words>260</words>  

He laughed, brittle. <words>262</words> “And you chronicle ash.” <words>266</words> The waterfall’s mist hung between them, droplets suspended like unsaid words. <words>280</words>  

She uncurled her palm, revealing the comb. <words>286</words> “You left this. <words>288</words> The night the militia came.” <words>293</words>  

His smirk faltered. <words>295</words> “You kept it?” <words>298</words>  

“A reminder,” she lied, her tone steeped in passionate disinterest. <words>308</words> Truth was, she’d hoped its weight might steady her hand—for drawing, for aiming, for something. <words>327</words>  

Kael’s gaze drifted to the cosmos. <words>332</words> “They’re dancing up there. <words>335</words> We’re just… falling.” <words>338</words>  

The bridge trembled as the waterfall’s roar crescendoed, droplets now cascading downward—normal, inevitable. <words>354</words> A celestial hour had passed; the inversion was over. <words>363</words>  

She gripped the comb until its filigree bit her skin. <words>372</words> “I’m not falling,” she said. <words>377</words> “I’m choosing where to land.” <words>383</words>  

When she hurled the comb into the waterfall, it vanished—not upward, but down, swallowed by the river’s corrected flow. <words>402</words> Kael’s silence followed her as she walked away, her pocket lighter, her next chronicle already drafting itself in her mind, sharp and sure as a nocked arrow. <words>430</words>  

Beneath the now-ordinary waterfall, the Bridge of Regret held nothing but the ghost of a choice, and the archer’s footprints, pressing forward. <words>454</words>
