<story>  
The secretive pathfinder jogged past the haunted amusement park’s ghost train, her marathon training route looping through its rusted gates like a recurring nightmare. <words>25</words>  
Her cracked porcelain teapot, strapped to her backpack, clinked with every stride—a vessel for the folk medicines she’d vowed to preserve, their recipes etched in invisible ink beneath its glaze. <words>50</words>  
By day, she was Clara Yang, aloof data analyst; by night, she hacked bizarre music playlists, embedding encrypted herbal lore into distorted track metadata, her keyboard clicks syncopated with the park’s creaking Ferris wheel. <words>80</words>  
The forgotten prodigy of both coding and traditional healing, she moved with an angrily peaceful rhythm, her calm strides belying the fury that fueled her: modern medicine had erased her grandmother’s legacy, and she’d burn the world to save it. <words>115</words>  

One October dusk, the ghost train’s speakers crackled to life, spewing her own playlists backward—a trap. <words>130</words>  
Inside, she found the source: a spectral curator, half-rotted, clutching a ledger of stolen remedies. <words>145</words>  
“You think your little songs can outsing oblivion?” it hissed, its breath reeking of digitized decay. <words>160</words>  
Clara’s fingers flew across her phone, queuing a track so layered with dissonant frequencies that the spirit’s form pixelated—but the teapot slipped, a hairline fracture blooming into a chasm. <words>190</words>  

Panic choked her. <words>192</words>  
The last surviving recipe for Moonwell Elixir glowed faintly through the crack, fading like a dying pulse. <words>207</words>  
Then she remembered: the train’s projection mapped her grandmother’s face onto every ghost, those flickering lips that once sang lullabies of dandelion and bone. <words>230</words>  
“Fine,” Clara spat, her voice trembling with aloof passion. <words>239</words>  
She hugged the teapot to her chest, its edges biting into her skin, and ran—not away, but deeper into the attraction, marathon-trained legs carrying her through holographic graveyards where each tombstone played her corrupted files. <words>275</words>  

The spirit gave chase, its wails harmonizing with her playlist’s glitches. <words>285</words>  
At the final car, Clara smashed the teapot against a rusted control panel, releasing not shards, but a cloud of digitized pollen—every preserved remedy blooming into the air. <words>314</words>  
The spirit inhaled, shuddered, and stilled. <words>319</words>  
In its palm, she placed the largest ceramic fragment. <words>328</words>  
“Guard them better this time,” she whispered, her marathon’s finish line forgotten as dawn pinkened the park’s broken roller coasters. <words>350</words>  

Weeks later, runners on Clara’s route complained of strange music near the ghost train—playlists that cured migraines, soothed sprains, made old scars tingle warmly. <words>375</words>  
They never saw her pause mid-sprint to adjust the tracks, her smile as secretly fierce as the teapot’s mended seams. <words>395</words>  
When the park reopened, visitors embraced in its shadows, unaware their hugs transmitted cures through subsonic frequencies, or that a woman in sweat-stained sneakers monitored it all from a server filled with lullabies. <words>430</words>  
The prodigy had been remembered. <words>434</words>  
The medicines, preserved in the one language no algorithm could erase: the body’s own rhythm, running toward dawn. <words>455</words>
