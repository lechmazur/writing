The doctor’s waiting room hummed with the uncertain silence of held breath, its sterile walls amplifying every rustle of magazine pages and ticking clock. <words>27</words>  
Marisol, a reformed con artist with fingers still itching for phantom wallets, clutched the crumpled sheet music in her lap—a relic from her last scam, where she’d posed as a Swiss musicologist selling “authentic alpine ballads.” <words>58</words>  
A detour to avoid downtown construction had led her here, to this rainforest canopy village suspended in emerald twilight, where wooden walkways bridged treetop huts and the air tasted of petrichor and possibility. <words>89</words>  
“You’ve got the look of someone who knows how to slip through cracks,” murmured the village elder, materializing beside her with a smile like knotted rope. <words>115</words>  
He’d mistaken her fidgeting for competence, her honed deceit for cunning—a dishonestly honest assessment that made her laugh sharp enough to startle a toucan. <words>138</words>  
They needed a guardian for tomorrow’s flame, he explained: a bioluminescent fungus whose spores could purify polluted rivers, hidden in the village’s heart. <words>160</words>  
Corporate loggers circled like vultures; the flame’s faint glow had begun to dim. <words>172</words>  
Marisol’s first instinct was to vanish—old habits die hard—but the sheet music rustled in her grip, its yodeling notations suddenly sharp in her memory. <words>195</words>  
Back in her grifting days, she’d mimicked dialects flawlessly, mirroring marks until they saw themselves in her lies. <words>212</words>  
What if she mirrored the forest instead? <words>218</words>  
That night, she climbed to the highest walkway, inhaled air thick with decaying leaves and hope, and yodeled. <words>234</words>  
Not the cartoonish alpine calls she’d faked for cash, but something raw—a throat-born echo of howler monkeys and creaking bamboo, of roots splitting stone. <words>256</words>  
The village paused. <words>258</words>  
Then, tentatively, the forest answered. <words>263</words>  
Frogs croaked in rhythmic counterpoint; branches clacked like percussion. <words>274</words>  
Marisol grinned, spinning new melodies from the canopy’s chorus, conducting life into a shield of sound. <words>290</words>  
Gradual revelations unfurled: the loggers’ foreman, it turned out, had a daughter who loved birdsong. <words>305</words>  
Marisol taught him to duet with macaws, sheet music now scribbled with rainforest rhythms. <words>320</words>  
When bulldozers arrived, their roar faltered against the symphony of a thousand synchronized creatures—a cacophony so alive it felt sacred. <words>342</words>  
The foreman ordered a retreat, his eyes wet with the ache of remembering what wonder sounded like. <words>358</words>  
Later, in the doctor’s office, Marisol would learn the tremor in her hands was just caffeine, not the illness she’d feared. <words>378</words>  
But in that moment, watching the flame’s glow pulse brighter as villagers danced, she understood guardianship wasn’t about permanence. <words>398</words>  
It was about tending sparks—of truth, of song—so they could outlast her. <words>412</words>  
She pocketed the sheet music, its creases softened by rain and use, and joined the dance, her yodels weaving through the canopy like vines stitching wounds closed. <words>436</words>  
Tomorrow’s flame burned in every throat that sang, every ear that listened, every liar who’d forgotten how to tell the truth until the world asked them to hum instead. <words>460</words>  
And Marisol, once a sculptor of facades, became a student of echoes. <words>473</words>
