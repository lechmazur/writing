The steampunk airship’s dining room hummed with the clatter of silverware and the hiss of overworked pistons, its brass-lined walls vibrating beneath a chandelier forged from salvaged clockwork. <words>37</words>  
Amid the chaos, the tuneless bard—known only as Lyra—slouched against a velvet divan, her fingers drumming a rhythm only she understood on a stained manuscript riddled with inkblots and crossed-out verses. <words>67</words>  
“Poetry readings,” she drawled, her voice a blend of smoke and defiance, “are just chaos wearing a cravat.” <words>85</words>  
The diners chuckled, mistaking her fierceness for theater, her nonchalance for apathy—a miscalculation as fatal as ignoring a ticking bomb. <words>102</words>  
Lyra’s manuscript wasn’t poetry; it was a map, its stains not ink but dried blood from the scholar who’d died smuggling it aboard, whispering of a tinderbox that could “ignite the seams of reality.” <words>132</words>  
She’d scoffed at his dramatics, of course—brazen humility required pretending madness didn’t fascinate her—but here she was, chasing a legend spun from drunken sailors and paranoid inventors. <words>159</words>  
As a soprano began reciting sonnets about storm clouds, Lyra palmed the tinderbox from her boot, its cold brass etched with symbols that hurt to look at sideways. <words>184</words>  
The airship lurched; a teacup shattered. <words>189</words>  
“Perfect,” she muttered, striking a flame that burned violet—a color that shouldn’t exist—and held it to the manuscript’s edge. <words>208</words>  
The pages didn’t burn. <words>211</words>  
Instead, the bloodstains writhed, forming a language that twisted like snakes, and the dining room’s chaos stilled as passengers gasped at the hovering words. <words>236</words>  
“Chaos isn’t something you fight,” Lyra announced, her tone softer now, almost kind. <words>250</words>  
“It’s something you court. <words>254</words>  
And if you’re clever, something you marry.” <words>261</words>  
The symbols spiraled upward, stitching the air itself into a tapestry of half-truths and impossible geometries—a recipe for taming chaos, passed down through lies masquerading as folklore. <words>289</words>  
A engineer lunged for her, shouting about protocol; Lyra kissed the violet flame and blew it into his face. <words>307</words>  
He froze, entranced, as the flame danced in his pupils. <words>317</words>  
“See?” she said. <words>319</words>  
“Madness has a horizon. <words>322</words>  
Tastes like peppermint and bad decisions.” <words>328</words>  
The airship shuddered violently, portholes cracking as the outside world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of fractured skies. <words>346</words>  
Lyra grinned—this was the moment legends warped through retellings: the tuneless bard who’d turned an airship into a loom, weaving order from bedlam with a smirk and a stolen spark. <words>375</words>  
Passengers clutched each other, some weeping, others laughing as the symbols seared into their minds, rewriting their fears into something akin to awe. <words>399</words>  
When the shaking ceased, the sky outside was calm, impossibly blue, and the manuscript lay blank. <words>417</words>  
Lyra tucked the tinderbox away, nodded at the stunned soprano, and sauntered out, humming a melody that made the chandelier’s gears whirl in waltz time. <words>441</words>  
Behind her, the diners erupted into fervid debate—was this salvation or heresy? <words>454</words>  
She didn’t care. <words>456</words>  
Legends, like chaos, only worked if you let them breathe. <words>466</words>  
And as for kissing madness? <words>470</words>  
Well. <words>471</words>  
No one mentioned the horizon kisses back. <words>478</words>
