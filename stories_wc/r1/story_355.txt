<story>The hall breathed its final sigh as the last balloon crumpled to the floor, its helium ghost whispering past constellations of confetti stuck to the ceiling. <words>34</words>  
Lysandra traced the cracked compass in her palm, its needle quivering toward a mural where neon serpents swallowed their tails—a psychedelic ouroboros bleeding into walls that pulsed like living tissue. <words>66</words>  
She had danced here once, before the installation’s opening crowd dissolved, her limbs carving geometries only the drunkest guests tried to mimic. <words>90</words>  
“Aloof,” they’d called her, but the letters folded in her jacket pocket—unsent, ink smudged by sweat—knew the truth: she mapped their scattered dreams nightly, stitching screams into sonatas. <words>123</words>  
The compass had arrived last winter, postmarked from a coastal town her mother never left. <words>139</words>  
*Follow north,* the enclosed note lied, but north here pointed to a ceiling fan’s wobble, to a disco ball shedding silver scales. <words>162</words>  
Still, she pressed the relic to the mural, and the serpents shuddered. <words>174</words>  
A panel slid open, exhaling cold air and the sound of a cello playing backwards. <words>188</words>  
Inside, shelves held jars of liquid dreams—violet for grief, acid-green for envy—each labeled in her mother’s jagged script. <words>208</words>  
*Harshly compassionate,* the archivists here had named her lineage: women who bottled truths too sharp for tongues. <words>226</words>  
Lysandra uncorked a vial of cobalt mist. <words>232</words>  
The memory unfolded—a boy at the installation’s edge, fingers brushing the wall’s biomechanical veins, whispering, *I wish I’d kissed her.* <words>254</words>  
She’d etched his longing into a pirouette that night, letting it dissolve midair. <words>267</words>  
Easing truths was never gentle. <words>272</words>  
Her mother’s voice slithered from the darkest jar: *You think dancing frees them? You’re just the urn.* <words>291</words>  
The compass split further, a hairline fracture now cleaving its face. <words>301</words>  
Outside, dawn bled through stained-glass skylights, fracturing the hall into prismatic graves. <words>315</words>  
Lysandra dipped her pen into a jar of molten gold—dreams of first loves and last breaths—and began writing across the walls. <words>335</words>  
Letters home, but not to the coast. <words>341</words>  
To the boy. <words>343</words>  
To the woman who’d wept into the champagne fountain. <words>352</words>  
To the curator feeding his loneliness to the installation’s hungry pipes. <words>365</words>  
Her script pulsed, alive, as the murals peeled themselves free, slithering into the compass’s crack until the metal grew hot, until it burst. <words>388</words>  
Shards became moths. <words>391</words>  
They settled on her shoulders as she danced anew—not geometries now, but a requiem. <words>407</words>  
The hall unraveled stitch by stitch, balloons rising deflated as the moths carried their truths into the light. <words>426</words>  
When security found her at noon, she was sweeping up glass, humming a lullaby the jars had taught her. <words>443</words>  
“Just cleaning,” she said, pocketing a shard still warm with someone else’s dream of reconciliation. <words>460</words>  
The compass’s final north, it turned out, had always pointed here: to fractures, to the unspoken, to the dance after the dance. <words>483</words>  
She posted the letters on her way out, their seals glowing faintly with stolen starlight. <words>499</words></story>
