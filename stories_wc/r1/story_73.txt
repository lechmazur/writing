The gravedigger’s shovel struck earth with metronomic precision, each thrust steady as the stars wheeling above the ancient Aztec temple reimagined as a cemetery’s heart. <words>27</words> His name was Ignacio, though the villagers called him *El Vigilante*—not for his watchfulness, but for the vintage magnifying glass dangling from his neck, its brass rim glinting like a third eye. <words>54</words> It had been his grandfather’s, a relic from an era when the temple’s stones still hummed with blood rites. <words>75</words> Tonight, though, the air thrummed with raucous silence, a taut quietude that followed the priest’s sudden confession: *“I broke the fence line.”* <words>102</words> The wooden barrier, once shielding the temple’s spectral aura from the living, now lay splintered, letting the wind hiss through its ribs like a serpent’s exhalation. <words>129</words>  

Ignacio knelt, brushing soil from a glyph-carved slab, and raised the magnifying glass. <words>145</words> Through its lens, the world *rippled*—the cemetery’s crosses dissolved into stepped pyramids, and skeletal trees bloomed into obsidian serpents. <words>166</words> When worlds overlap, his grandfather had warned, the dead grow hungry. <words>180</words> A gust snarled through the broken fence, carrying whispers in Nahuatl. <words>193</words> Ignacio’s hand trembled, not from fear, but purpose: he would kindrelize the realms, bind them with the old rituals before the veil tore entirely. <words>219</words>  

He unearthed a jade figurine—a forgotten Tlaloc idol—and pressed it to his brow, chanting words that tasted of ash and monsoon. <words>240</words> The ground shuddered; spectral flames erupted from the temple’s altar, casting shadows that danced with diligently whimsical fervor. <words>260</words> Ignacio grinned. <words>263</words> Ritual was rhythm, and rhythm, to him, was a shovel’s cadence. <words>276</words> But the wind sharpened, howling through the fence’s gaps like a deranged flautist. <words>293</words> Shadows congealed into a figure—a priestess in feathered regalia, her eyes voids sucking at the light. <words>313</words>  

“*You* preserve nothing,” she hissed, her voice a chorus of crumbling tombs. <words>328</words> “The rituals demand blood, not dirt.” <words>337</words> Ignacio hefted his shovel, its edge honed by decades of graves. <words>351</words> “Blood’s just another kind of soil,” he said, and swung. <words>364</words> The priestess scattered into smoke, but her laughter lingered. <words>377</words>  

The magnifying glass grew hot against his chest. <words>386</words> Through it, he glimpsed the fence’s splinters knitting, the temple’s stones settling into their modern disguise. <words>405</words> The overlap was receding. <words>410</words> Yet, as dawn bled across the horizon, Ignacio pressed the idol into the earth one last time, sealing the ritual. <words>431</words> Let the priest fret over broken fences. <words>440</words> His work was deeper—roots and bones, the quiet alchemy of keeping worlds apart by honoring their collision. <words>461</words> The wind sighed through mended wood, carrying the scent of marigolds. <words>476</words> Some silences, he thought, are louder than drums. <words>488</words> He shouldered his shovel, its weight familiar as a heartbeat, and walked home beneath a sky that remembered both his name and his grandfather’s. <words>516</words>
