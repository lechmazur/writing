The joyless performer stood on the shore of the prismatic lake, its fractured light staining her hands the color of forgotten sunsets. <words>28</words> She clutched the simple drawer knob in her pocket, its brass edges biting her palm—a relic from the dresser where she’d hidden every apology she’d never voiced. <words>54</words> Construction cranes loomed behind her like skeletal guardians, their shadows slicing the water into trembling ribbons. <words>76</words> Amid the growl of machinery, she heard it again: the echo of a squeaking seesaw from the empty playground across the lake, a sound that unstitched her composure thread by thread. <words>108</words>  

Her life had become an exercise in *modest extravagance*—a paradox as precise as the lacquered stage makeup she still wore each dawn. <words>133</words> She organized her guilt into neat compartments: one for the accident she’d witnessed, another for the lie she’d polished into a shield, a third for the way she’d abandoned music to become a mime in this half-built resort town. <words>168</words> But the seesaw’s whine, mimicking the creak of a hospital bed chain, blurred the lines between compartments. <words>187</words>  

Tonight, she’d decided, she would break her silence. <words>195</words> Not with words—those were too malleable—but with movement. <words>205</words> She’d choreograph a dance along the construction beams, using the drawer knob as her only prop, its hollow core whispering of secrets turned tangible. <words>230</words> The lake’s kaleidoscopic surface would be her audience, reflecting every leap meant to hush the dissonance humming in her marrow. <words>251</words>  

As twilight bled into indigo, she climbed the crane, her pulse syncing with the distant seesaw rhythm. <words>268</words> Below, floodlights glared like accusatory eyes. <words>276</words> When she pulled the knob from her pocket, its surface caught the light, becoming a tiny prism that scattered beams across the cranes. <words>299</words> For three suspended breaths, she was torn between truths: the safety of perpetual pantomime or the peril of letting her body scream what her voice could not. <words>327</words>  

She jumped. <words>328</words>  

The wind carved her into something sharp and keening. <words>337</words> She spun the knob on its screw, letting it slice arcs through the dark—a conductor’s baton summoning ghosts from the lake’s depths. <words>360</words> Her shadow, multiplied by colored spotlights, became a flock of women unraveling across concrete and water. <words>380</words> One shadow held a child’s hand. <words>386</words> Another pressed a stethoscope to broken asphalt. <words>394</words> The loudest simply fell, endlessly, through the space where the playground used to be. <words>410</words>  

When her feet struck cold water, the impact jarred the knob loose. <words>421</words> It sank, glinting, as she surfaced to the sound of workers applauding—mistaking her cautious abandon for entertainment. <words>442</words> But in the parking lot, the seesaw finally fell still. <words>452</words> And for the first time in twelve years, she inhaled air that didn’t taste of antiseptic and unsaid words. <words>470</words>  

She walked ashore, dripping neon. <words>475</words> The construction foreman offered a towel, his smile fraying at the edges. <words>487</words> “What’s that called?” he asked, nodding at the lake. <words>497</words> She wrung prismatic water from her hair, watching it pool around boots still dusty with someone else’s chalk. <words>518</words> “A requiem,” she said. <words>522</words>
