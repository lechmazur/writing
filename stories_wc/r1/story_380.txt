The convicted dream thief climbed the splintered ladder into the forgotten library inside the treehouse, her fingers trembling around the flimsy photo album tucked beneath her arm. <words>30</words> Its pages whispered with stolen dreams—fractured faces, half-remembered birthdays, a child’s laughter dissolving into static—each fragment a testament to her crime: pilfering pieces of selves she could never own. <words>62</words> The world outside had stopped making new humans centuries ago, after the last birth, leaving only echoes and the hollow ache of what once thrived. <words>86</words>  

She’d chosen this place for its silence, its shelves sagging with books no one would ever read again, but tonight, the air hummed with quiet mania. <words>112</words> Her plan required precision, a feat complicated by being mathematically challenged; numbers slithered away from her grasp like eels, leaving calculations half-baked and dangerous. <words>136</words> Yet she’d rigged the rusted pulley system anyway, ropes coiled around a dented basketball hoop—a nod to the shared love of pick-up games that once bonded her to the guard who’d sworn to kill her. <words>168</words>  

The album fell open to a page where a storm raged in sepia, lightning frozen mid-strike. <words>182</words> To coax thunder from empty skies, she needed to plunge into the tempest of stolen memories, to stitch together a cacophony loud enough to wake the dormant atmosphere. <words>206</words> But diving into dreams was like swimming through broken glass—every shard cut deeper, each fragment reflecting a version of herself she no longer recognized. <words>229</words>  

When the guard found her, she was murmuring equations to the dust motes, her hands sketching arcs only she could see. <words>248</words> “You’re still terrible at math,” he said, leaning against the doorway, a deflated basketball under his arm. <words>264</words> Their rivalry had once been playful: layups at dawn, trash talk over three-pointers, a free throw that shattered the courthouse window and sealed her arrest. <words>286</words> Now, his presence was a knot in her plan. <words>295</words>  

She gripped the album tighter. <words>299</words> “The sky’s been empty too long. I can fix it.” <words>309</words> He stepped closer, his shadow swallowing the lamplight. <words>319</words> “By recycling stolen dreams? You’ll unravel yourself.” <words>328</words> But she was already tearing out pages, feeding them into the storm, her fractured reflection multiplying in the gale. <words>347</words>  

The treehouse shuddered as the first thunderclap erupted, a sound like the world cracking its knuckles. <words>363</words> The guard lunged, but she leaped onto the pulley rope, swinging into the maelstrom—a plunge toward either salvation or oblivion. <words>383</words> Wind screamed through the library, scattering equations, scattering selves. <words>394</words>  

When the silence returned, the guard found the album intact, its final page blank except for a single sentence: *I left the thunder for you.* <words>418</words> Above, the sky grumbled, alive once more, as somewhere in the fragments, the thief laughed—a sound like rain on parched earth. <words>440</words>
