The giant mushroom meeting hall stood silent under a sky veiled by the hush of a dreamless night, its bioluminescent caps casting a gorgeously awkward glow—like hesitant stars caught mid-flicker. <words>31</words>  
Inside, the dry-tongued bard traced a finger along the ribbed walls, her throat parched from years of swallowing unsung verses. <words>49</words>  
Before her, atop a pedestal of knotted mycelium, hovered the stained glass prism, its fractured planes humming with the trapped echoes of forgotten voicemails. <words>71</words>  
“Preserve them,” the council had commanded, but how could she distill voices into song when her own tongue cracked like sunbaked clay? <words>90</words>  
She draped the cloak of doubt over her shoulders—a weightless thing that somehow bent her spine—and stepped into the prism’s kaleidoscopic light. <words>111</words>  
A chorus erupted: a lover’s apology stranded mid-syllable, a child’s laughter clipped by static, a king’s final breath fossilized in quartz. <words>130</words>  
Each fragment pricked her skin, demanding to be woven into something eternal, but the cloak tightened, whispering *you’ll only ruin them*. <words>149</words>  
Her hands trembled as she unsheathed her lyre, its strings spun from dandelion silk, and plucked a note that shimmered like misplaced guilt. <words>169</words>  
The prism shuddered, projecting memories onto the domed ceiling—a man’s face dissolving into rain, a bridge collapsing in reverse, a moth circling a dead star. <words>192</words>  
“They’re not mine,” she rasped, yet the visions seeped into her pores, fermenting into lyrics she couldn’t outrun. <words>208</words>  
The cloak’s hem snagged on a thorn of doubt: *What if your voice isn’t worthy of their truths?* <words>224</words>  
But the hall itself seemed to lean closer, mushroom pillars creaking as if straining to hear the unsaid. <words>240</words>  
She inhaled, tasting the metallic tang of half-formed ballads, and sang—not to perfect the chaos, but to let it breathe through her cracks. <words>261</words>  
The prism pulsed, its edges softening as the voicemails unspooled into her melody, no longer trapped but suspended between loss and rediscovery. <words>283</words>  
The cloak slithered off, dissolving into spores that glittered like dismissed fears. <words>295</words>  
Dawn approached, its first light refracting through the prism to paint the floor with fleeting constellations. <words>311</words>  
The bard knelt, gathering the scattered light into a vial hung at her throat—a portable dawn for darker hours. <words>330</words>  
As she exited the hall, the mushrooms sighed in unison, their caps bowing as though mourning a solitude they’d once cherished. <words>350</words>  
Her tongue remained dry, but now it held the salt of preserved voices, each syllable a key to a lock she’d mistaken for her bones. <words>372</words>  
In the valley below, travelers would later speak of a melody that hovered at the edge of sleep, crisp yet languid, carrying the weight of unburied ghosts. <words>396</words>  
They’d never name her, this bard who wore doubt as a temporary skin, but in their dreams, they’d hum her tunes and feel less alone. <words>419</words>  
And in the hollow of her throat, the vial glowed—a testament to the night she’d let the world’s broken whispers sing her free. <words>441</words>  
The prison of self still loomed, but now she knew its walls were stained glass, waiting for the right angle of light to bend. <words>463</words>
