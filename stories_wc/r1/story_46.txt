The blank-faced performer pressed ivory keys in the orchard of giant ferns, their stems bowing under waterfalls that hissed like whispered secrets. <words>27</words> Piano notes bled into the roar, each chord a failed attempt to mimic the language of dreams—a tongue she’d chased since the rumors began. <words>54</words> They said she was the guardian of rumors, a title as uniquely typical as the plain plastic ring she wore: unremarkable to eyes that didn’t notice its inner edge etched with lunar phases. <words>89</words>  

Tonight, the ring glowed. <words>93</words> Moonlight seeped through fern fronds, painting silver trails only she could trace—paths that curved like staff lines over sheet music. <words>114</words> To approve a rumor’s truth, she had to follow these arcs, her fingers pausing mid-scale to map constellations onto the piano’s lid. <words>137</words> Madness, perhaps, but precision was her compass; without it, the dreams would stay hieroglyphs. <words>153</words>  

A fern shivered. <words>155</words> Behind her, a shadow coalesced—a rumor given form, its voice a wet rasp. <words>169</words> “They say the moon’s a liar,” it hissed. <words>175</words> The performer’s face remained smooth as porcelain, but her ring hummed. <words>186</words> She played a dissonant triad, and the shadow recoiled as the waterfalls echoed the chord backward. <words>203</words>  

“Truth isn’t your domain,” she said, though her throat ached from syllables humans shouldn’t speak. <words>219</words> The plastic ring’s glow sharpened, its etched phases aligning with the moon’s smirk above. <words>234</words> Tracking its path, she struck a minor ninth—a sound that split the rumor’s form into moths, their wings dusted with half-truths. <words>254</words>  

Dawn approached. <words>256</words> The piano’s lacquer bore new constellations, her approval etched in starlight and moth blood. <words>271</words> Yet the language of dreams still frayed at the edges, vowels dissolving before she could grasp them. <words>287</words> She rotated the ring, its plastic warm now, and wondered if madness was simply precision without a key. <words>305</words>  

A child’s face flickered in the waterfall mist—a memory or premonition. <words>316</words> They’d worn the ring before her, their fingers too small to span an octave. <words>329</words> Guardianship demanded sacrifices: fingerprints worn smooth, dreams deferred for others’. <words>342</words> But the performer played on, her blankness a shield against the rumors’ teeth. <words>355</words>  

When the next moon rose, she’d track its path again, plastic against ivory, truth against sound. <words>371</words> Maybe tonight, the dreams would speak in something sharper than echoes. <words>384</words> Maybe tonight, the ring would crack, releasing whatever slept inside its mundane shell. <words>399</words> Until then, she played scales in the key of precise madness, each note a ward against the chaos beyond the ferns. <words>419</words>  

The waterfalls hushed. <words>421</words> In the silence, a dream-word glinted—a shimmering consonant she trapped beneath the ring, where it pulsed like a second heartbeat. <words>440</words> Approval granted. <words>442</words> The guardian exhaled, her face still blank, her hands already reaching for the next rumor, the next moon, the next impossible note. <words>460</words>
