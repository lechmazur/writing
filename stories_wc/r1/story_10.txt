The cheerless duelist knelt in the abandoned spaceport customs office, her gloved fingers brushing dust from a maggoty wooden chest that rattled with secrets. <words>27</words> Around her, the hum of server rooms vibrated through corroded walls, a mechanical dirge for the ghosts of interstellar trade. <words>50</words> She’d come seeking relics of her family’s culinary legacy—recipes once engineered to elasticize human endurance, now warped into something darker by generations of pride. <words>83</words> The chest’s hinges groaned open, revealing vials of bioluminescent yeast and a holopad flickering with mutated formulas. <words>105</words> Her father’s voice echoed in her skull: *“Precision breeds power, but never forgive a flawed ingredient.”* <words>127</words>  

A maggot writhed on her wrist as she decrypted the files, each recipe a precisely innovative abomination—sourdough starters fused with spider DNA, broth cultures that devoured regret. <words>159</words> Her fatal flaw, she realized, wasn’t the dueling scars crisscrossing her ribs, but the arrogance that had poisoned her bloodline. <words>183</words> Twelve years ago, she’d elasticized a rival’s spine with a molecular whip; tonight, the servers’ hum sounded like his laughter. <words>205</words>  

A hologram flared—her grandmother’s face, stern yet shimmering with data. <words>216</words> “Forgiveness isn’t deletion,” it intoned. “It’s… recalibration.” <words>225</words> The duelist gagged as she swallowed a vial of iridescent koji, its engineered spores searing her throat. <words>241</words> Mutations prickled beneath her skin, rewriting her cells with the mercy her ancestors had scrubbed from their code. <words>260</words>  

When customs officers burst in, stun rifles crackling, she didn’t reach for her blade. <words>276</words> Instead, she exhaled a cloud of spores that bloomed into lilies on their armor. <words>291</words> “They’ll help you digest old grudges,” she rasped, her voice now a harmony with the servers’ thrum. <words>311</words>  

In the chest’s false bottom, she found her mother’s final recipe—a synaptic tisane brewed from asteroid-mined chamomile and self-replicating apologies. <words>337</words> Drinking it tasted like swallowing starlight and broken mirrors. <words>347</words> Memories unspooled: her father incinerating a rival’s olive branch, her own hands too steady when mercy required tremors. <words>368</words>  

By dawn, the duelist staggered into the spaceport’s derelict hangar, her body a map of fading scars. <words>386</words> Transponder codes blinked—a freighter crewed by those she’d wronged, descending through acid-yellow clouds. <words>405</words> She clutched a vial of hybridized yeast, its glow softening the hard lines of her face. <words>423</words> Forgiveness, she understood now, wasn’t absolution, but the courage to keep mutating. <words>439</words>  

As airlock hydraulics hissed, she whispered the only oath left: “Let them come elasticized.” <words>455</words> The maggots in the chest had stopped rattling. <words>463</words> They’d begun to sing. <words>467</words>
