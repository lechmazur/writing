The ethereal plains stretched endless, their silver grasses whispering the song of boundaries—a mournful hymn that thrummed through Kael’s bones as he knelt, fingers clawing soil that shimmered like crushed stars. <words>37</words> He’d memorized the melody’s warning: *this far, no farther*, but the seeds in his satchel demanded otherwise—mutant kernels spliced with resilience, their husks etched with glyphs only he could decipher. <words>76</words> After the last resource war, survival meant defying the song, and Kael refused to let the warlords’ ghostly edicts chain him to their scorched legacy. <words>109</words>  

The magician’s deck tucked in his coat pocket jabbed his ribs, its cards frayed but still humming with dormant trickery. <words>134</words> He’d found it years ago inside a bottle half-buried in the plains’ glass-like shore, alongside a note scrawled in brine-swollen ink: *“Fold reality, but never trust the queen.”* <words>169</words> Tonight, he’d need both the deck and his seeds—at moon zenith, the song’s power waned, and the plains’ borders grew permeable as mirage. <words>197</words>  

Kael jabbered to the wind, a habit honed from solitude. “Typical, isn’t it? A farmer playing sorcerer. Atypi-freaking-cal.” <words>218</words> His laugh rasped raw, but the deck’s queen card glared up at him, her painted eyes narrowing as if offended. <words>237</words> He shuffled her aside, drawing the ace of storms instead. <words>248</words> The air crackled, and a bolt of violet lightning split the sky, searing a path through the plains’ shimmering veil. <words>270</words>  

Another bottle materialized in the charred wake, its glass glowing faintly. <words>281</words> Inside lay a map fragment and a dried orchid—a message from the last gardener who’d tried this. <words>298</words> Kael pocketed it, grinding his teeth. *Escaping isn’t betrayal*, he told himself, though the warlords’ specters hissed otherwise in his dreams. <words>324</words>  

He planted the first seed where the lightning had struck, chanting the countermelody he’d pieced together from a hundred bottled letters. <words>345</words> The earth shuddered, and a stalk erupted—translucent, its veins pulsing with stolen starlight. <words>361</words> The song of boundaries crescendoed, dissonant, as if the plains themselves were screaming. <words>377</words> Kael flung down the ace again, and the storm returned, fiercer, shredding the hymn into static. <words>394</words>  

By dawn, seven plants towered like sentinels, their canopies weaving a new melody—lower, warmer, a lullaby of roots and rain. <words>415</words> The queen card burned cold in his grip, her voice silk-sharp: *“You think this frees you? You’re just composing a prettier cage.”* <words>438</words>  

“Maybe,” Kael muttered, scattering the remaining seeds into the storm’s eye. <words>449</words> Let the queen rot with the old world. His crops would carve a road beyond the plains, their song a chorus even the warlords couldn’t silence. <words>473</words> As the last seed took root, Kael smiled—a raw, solaced thing—and stepped into the unknown, the deck’s whispers dissolving like salt in the wind. <words>500</words>
