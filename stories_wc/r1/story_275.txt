<story>  
The ghostly orchard stretched beneath a sky split by the burning comet, its crimson tail searing the horizon like a wound. <words>24</words>  
Here, the mysterious hermit moved—always moving—through gnarled rows, his boots crunching brittle soil that hadn’t felt rain since the comet first ignited. <words>47</words>  
In his hands, he clutched a pressed flower album, its pages warped by time and the ghosts of blossoms long dead. <words>68</words>  
Each delicate specimen whispered of mindful choices: a violet bent toward starlight, a thistle defiant in a crack of stone—theoretical rebellions against inevitability. <words>88</words>  
The hermit’s task was to translate, not words, but the comet’s ruinous song into something that could coax life from this barren ground. <words>109</words>  
He worked via the exact angle of a half-bent weathervane atop the orchard’s derelict chapel, its arrow frozen northeast, where the comet’s heart blazed hottest. <words>132</words>  
At dusk, he aligned the album’s pages with the weathervane’s shadow, mapping trajectories of ash and memory. <words>148</words>  
“To grow,” he muttered, “is to bend but not break,” though his voice frayed like the stems he’d once salvaged. <words>167</words>  
The orchard resisted. Roots coiled like skeletons; branches clawed at his coat. <words>180</words>  
Yet, in his pockets, he carried seeds wrapped in parchment inscribed with equations—rebellions disguised as hope. <words>196</words>  
One night, as the comet’s glare fractured the chapel’s spire, he buried a seed where the weathervane’s shadow split the earth. <words>217</words>  
Days passed without movement. Without sound. Without mercy. <words>227</words>  
Then, a sprout: pale, trembling, its leaves veined with the same fire that scorched the sky. <words>242</words>  
The hermit knelt, the pressed flower album open to a page marked *Amaranth—undying*. <words>255</words>  
“You’re stubborn,” he told the sprout, grinning a grin that felt foreign on his weathered face. <words>271</words>  
He fed it starlight filtered through the album’s translucent pages, each beam a calibrated rebellion against the comet’s wrath. <words>291</words>  
The orchard watched. The comet seethed. <words>298</words>  
When the sprout bloomed, its petals were neither red nor white, but a shifting hue that mirrored the weathervane’s rusted hinge. <words>320</words>  
It thrived on paradox—a creature of deliberate wilderness, nourished by ash and defiance. <words>335</words>  
The hermit pressed one of its flowers into the album, beside a sketch of the comet’s trajectory. <words>352</words>  
“Equilibrium,” he declared, though the word tasted uncertain. <words>362</words>  
By the next lunar cycle, a dozen sprouts pierced the soil, each angled northeast, each whispering secrets the hermit had transcribed from the weathervane’s silent arithmetic. <words>388</words>  
The comet’s light waned, outmaneuvered by roots that siphoned its fury into chlorophyll and thorn. <words>404</words>  
On the morning the hermit left—still moving, always moving—he buried the album beneath the chapel’s steps. <words>423</words>  
Let the orchard remember: life, when threaded through mindful choices, could translate even fire into a kind of flowering. <words>443</words>  
Above, the weathervane creaked, its bend now a perfect arc between ruin and regrowth. <words>459</words>
