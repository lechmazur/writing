The barbershop’s striped pole dimmed as the last client left, leaving Jessa alone in the lunar colony command center’s annex, her calloused fingers tracing the frayed satin of her mother’s ballet shoes. <words>34</words>  
She’d drifted here six months ago, a skittish shadow drawn to the colony’s hum of machinery and the barber’s accidental offer: *“We’ve got a cot if you sweep up.”* <words>63</words>  
Now, in the hush after closing, she knelt before the antique loom bolted to the wall—a relic from Earth, its warp threads snapped during the voyage, its weft still taut with lunar grit. <words>93</words>  
The command center’s engineers called it junk, but Jessa saw pioneer potential in its bones, a way to weave not fabric but *mind*. <words>113</words>  
Her mother had whispered of grace before vanishing—*“It’s in the threads between steps, the silence beneath music”*—and Jessa’s hands trembled as she laced the shoes, their soles whispering against regolith-dusted tiles. <words>144</words>  
Tonight, she’d summon that grace, not through pirouettes but by reconnecting the loom’s severed strands, each knot a synapse, each crossed fiber a dive into the subconscious. <words>169</words>  
The colony’s head engineer, a man who oiled gears like others sip whiskey, had snorted when she proposed it: *“Dramatically understated, girl. Fix the thing with a waltz?”* <words>198</words>  
But as Jessa’s needle wove copper wire into flax, the loom shuddered alive, projecting holograms of Earth’s forgotten forests—oak, birch, pine—their roots knitting through the moon’s sterile bedrock. <words>231</words>  
Her ankles bled into the shoes’ cracked leather as she stepped into the projection, each plié syncing with the colony’s oxygen recyclers, each tendu flexing solar panels toward dawn. <words>261</words>  
The barbershop’s mirrors fogged with her breath, reflecting not a drifter but a conductor, her motions rustic yet precise, the loom translating muscle memory into terraforming code. <words>288</words>  
When the command center alarms blared—*“Unauthorized biomass detected in Sector 7!”*—Jessa didn’t flinch. <words>304</words>  
Sweat-slick and grinning, she watched ivy crack the observation dome’s glass, tendrils curling toward starlight. <words>322</words>  
The engineers found her asleep at the loom, the shoes discarded, her palms cradling a sapling grown from spliced lunar soil and holographic rain. <words>344</words>  
*“You,”* the head engineer muttered, *“reconnected more than threads.”* <words>358</words>  
Jessa shrugged, her voice steady for the first time in years: *“Grace isn’t summoned. It’s remembered.”* <words>377</words>  
By dawn, the colony voted to repurpose the command center’s west wing—not for machines, but for gardens, their irrigation maps threaded by Jessa’s loom. <words>403</words>  
She still sweeps hair each evening, but now the clippers keep rhythm with her stitching, and when newcomers ask why a barber tends crops, she smiles. <words>430</words>  
*“Everything grows where threads cross,”* she says, knotting flax around steel, her mother’s shoes waiting—patient—for the next dance. <words>453</words>
