The wandering orchardist pressed her palm against the algae-crusted door of the forgotten underwater city hall, its brass hinges groaning as the phantom hand’s translucent fingers shimmered into existence beside her. <words>34</words> She’d learned young, at her grandmother’s kitchen table, that some doors only opened to the dead—or those who carried their touch. <words>62</words> The hand, inherited alongside her grandmother’s collection of dried leaves, had guided her across seven multiverses, each leaf in her satchel a brittle map of trade routes swallowed by time or tide. <words>96</words> “Reclaim,” her grandmother had rasped, sliding the leaves into her grip, “what the water took.” <words>113</words> Trustworthy, they’d called the old woman, though never kind; unique in her cruelty, gifting a child a mission that drowned her in silt and solitude. <words>136</words>  

The phantom hand twisted, and the door split, releasing a gasp of stale brine. <words>149</words> Inside, vaulted ceilings loomed, their murals blurred by centuries under the sea, but the orchardist didn’t need clarity—she’d memorized the constellations of commerce etched here: cobalt veins of spice trails, gold threads of silk roads, all converging at this sunken nexus. <words>193</words> Her boots sank into muck as she walked, her own breath loud in the drowned silence. <words>207</words> She unclasped her satchel, withdrawing a leaf as delicate as a finch’s skull, its veins mirroring the fractured trade route she’d crossed three worlds to restore. <words>232</words>  

When the phantom hand brushed the leaf, the city hall shuddered. <words>240</words> Coral cracked from pillars; silt cascaded like smoke. <words>248</words> For a heartbeat, the water vanished, replaced by the scent of apricot blossoms and the clamor of merchants haggling in a dozen tongues. <words>269</words> The orchardist’s throat tightened—this was the bittersweet grit of her work: witnessing ghosts of prosperity she could taste but never keep. <words>288</words> The vision frayed, and she hurried to press the leaf against the nearest mural, its edges fusing with the wall as the phantom hand dissolved into blue light. <words>316</words> One route reclaimed. <words>318</words>  

She’d done this 89 times. <words>322</words> Each success carved deeper the hollow in her chest. <words>330</words> The orchardist wasn’t naive; she knew her grandmother’s wisdom had been a chain, not a compass. <words>345</words> But without her, these routes—these possibilities—would stay buried, and the multiverse would starve, its arteries clogged by rot and ruin. <words>369</words> She selected another leaf, its stem stained by tea spilled long ago on that kitchen table, and turned to the next mural. <words>391</words>  

Somewhere above, in a world where orchards grew wild and unburdened, a sapling breached the soil, its roots fed by maps only the drowned could read. <words>419</words> The phantom hand flickered, eager. <words>423</words> The orchardist smiled, bitter as kelp, and stepped deeper into the dark. <words>435</words>
