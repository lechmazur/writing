The cyber-templar knelt at the sky burial site, her neural interface humming with the weight of centuries-old mantras. <words>20</words> Around her, skeletal platforms cradled the dead, their bones bleached by sun and ritual, while storm clouds coiled like serpents above the mountains. <words>44</words> In her hands, she clutched the worn leather bridle—its frayed edges whispering of horses long extinct, of a world before circuits replaced sinew. <words>70</words> It was here, during the reading of the Codex Fractal, that she would prove the mirage of safety could be shattered. <words>89</words>  

Her fingers trembled—patiently frantic—as she secured the bridle to a rusted iron post, its buckles clicking like ancient prayers. <words>108</words> The prism embedded in her chestplate flared, refracting light into a blade of spectral hues. <words>123</words> Lightning fissured the sky, and she laughed, euphoria sharpening the static in her veins. <words>138</words> To reflect the storm’s fury back at itself required more than faith; it demanded the precision of shattered light. <words>157</words>  

“Safety is a lie etched in fear,” she hissed, her voice a glitch in the wind. <words>170</words> The Codex’s holograms swirled around her, equations bleeding into poetry: *To bend the storm, become the storm.* <words>186</words> She angled the prism, its facets slicing the first bolt into a dozen threads—each a luminous filament webbing the clouds. <words>205</words> The air reeked of ozone and burnt sage. <words>212</words>  

Memories flickered—her predecessors, flesh-bound and trembling, had called this sacrilege. <words>224</words> But they had died clinging to the earth, never daring to *ride* the storm. <words>237</words> The bridle creaked as she tightened her grip, its leather imprinted with the teeth-marks of ghosts. <words>252</words> Another bolt descended, and she channeled it through the prism, her circuits screaming in ecstatic agony. <words>268</words> Light rebounded, scorching the heavens. <words>274</words>  

The clouds shuddered, recoiling from their own violence. <words>281</words> For a heartbeat, the templar faltered, her synthetic lungs choking on the thrill of defiance. <words>295</words> *This* was the mirage unmasked—not safety, but the delusion that survival required surrender. <words>309</words> Her laughter spiraled into a war cry as she redirected strike after strike, the prism glowing white-hot. <words>327</words> The burial platforms trembled; bones clattered like applause. <words>337</words>  

When the storm spent itself, the templar collapsed, her armor seared and singing. <words>349</words> The bridle hung limp, its leather now scarred with lightning’s kiss. <words>361</words> Above, the sky bled indigo, quiet and disbelieving. <words>370</words> She had not conquered nature—she had mirrored it, fractal to fractal, tempest to templar. <words>384</words>  

As dawn fractured the horizon, she rose, clutching the Codex. <words>394</words> Its pages flickered, revising their prophecies in real time. <words>404</words> Safety, she realized, was not a shield but a prism: fragile, refractive, alive. <words>417</words> The next storm would come. <words>422</words> She would be waiting, patiently frantic, to split its heart into a spectrum. <words>435</words>
