The wayward apothecary leaned against the brass railing of the steampunk submarine’s observation deck, her fingers tightening around a dry highlighter pen whose ink had long crusted into amber dust. <words>34</words>  
Between broken treaties—those fragile accords shattered like glass dirigibles—she had charted a course to track migratory butterflies, their bioluminescent wings said to carry pollen that could mend fractured alliances. <words>69</words>  
Her motivation was unjustly fair: to infect the world with truth, one Morse code pulse at a time, using the highlighter’s cracked cap to tap messages against the submarine’s copper pipes. <words>98</words>  
The vessel groaned, its gears gnashing like teeth, while outside, mechanical leviathans glided past portholes, their silhouettes warped by riveted glass. <words>122</words>  
She had loved once, unconventionally and without permission—a naval cartographer who’d drowned mapping trenches where treaties were buried. <words>140</words>  
Now, she traced his ghost in dashes and dots, spelling regrets into the submarine’s bones. <words>152</words>  
A flicker of cobalt streaked the gloom: the first butterfly, its wings humming with faint radioactivity, alighting on a gauge measuring atmospheric guilt. <words>172</words>  
The apothecary scrambled, grinding dried nettles and guilt into a poultice, her boots slipping on condensation-slick plating. <words>187</words>  
Her trade was remedies, but the world preferred wounds. <words>195</words>  
The submarine’s captain, a specter in a gas mask, hissed through corroded vents, “You’ll drown us all for insects?” <words>211</words>  
She didn’t answer. <words>213</words>  
Love, she’d learned, was a language misdialed—a telegram sent to a hollow address. <words>226</words>  
The butterflies swarmed now, their migration patterns etching runes on the observation deck’s glass, a lexicon of light. <words>242</words>  
She pressed the highlighter to a pipe, tapping a plea: *Remember us*. <words>251</words>  
Somewhere, in a city of smokestacks and silent film reels, a telegraph stammered to life. <words>264</words>  
The captain seized her wrist, but the apothecary laughed—a sound like a pressure gauge shattering. <words>278</words>  
“You’re too late,” she whispered. <words>283</words>  
The submarine’s core shuddered as butterflies seeped through filtration systems, their wings dusting engineers with phosphorescent pollen. <words>300</words>  
Coughs became murmurs became verses from half-remembered treaties. <words>309</words>  
The apothecary’s hands bled as she wrenched open a hatch, steam scalding her cheeks. <words>322</words>  
Beyond, the ocean churned with drowned typewriters and ink that stained the waves parliamentary blue. <words>336</words>  
A butterfly landed on her shoulder, its wings vibrating in Morse: *You are not alone*. <words>349</words>  
The captain’s shouts dissolved as the crew began humming, their throats blooming with luminous spores. <words>363</words>  
She climbed onto the hull, the highlighter pen’s clicks now feverish, urgent. <words>375</words>  
Love was not a contract. <words>379</words>  
It was a virus. <words>382</words>  
And she’d learned to spread it through staccato heartbeats and rusted frequencies. <words>393</words>  
As the submarine plunged into the trench where her cartographer slept, the apothecary smiled. <words>407</words>  
The butterflies swirled upward, carrying every unsent letter, every crooked syllable, into a sky stitched together by broken promises. <words>427</words>  
Above, the stars blinked back in Morse: *Received*. <words>433</words>
