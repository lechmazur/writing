The neon-lit slums of Neo-Kyushu hummed with the static of illegal energy grids, their labyrinthine alleys reflecting in puddles of synth-oil—distorted mirrors showing faces that weren’t quite their own. <words>42</words>  
Here, Agent Veyra, a lovelorn spy with a penchant for abandoned data vaults, traced her gloved finger over an unused sticky label in her pocket, its adhesive long expired—a relic from her last mission with *him*. <words>81</words>  
She’d agreed to meet Jax, an urban explorer whose fascination with derelict fusion reactors matched hers, at the Midnight Noodle Cart, where the chef claimed to have perfected a recipe that “tasted like time itself.” <words>121</words>  
But Veyra wasn’t here for ramen. <words>127</words>  
An avalanche of black-market drones—code-named “Hephaestus”—would swarm the city at dawn unless she intercepted their control hub, hidden somewhere in these very slums. <words>157</words>  
Jax arrived, his goggles glinting like fractured stars, and slid beside her. <words>171</words>  
“You look… curiously indifferent,” he said, nodding at her untouched bowl. <words>185</words>  
She forced a smirk, her mind clawing through memories of her ex-lover’s laugh, his betrayal, the way he’d gloated after sabotaging her mission in Prague. <words>210</words>  
*Focus*. <words>211</words>  
The drones’ hub required a biometric key—a fingerprint she’d lift using the sticky label once Jax led her to the reactor’s core. <words>235</words>  
But as they descended into the subterranean tunnels, Veyra caught glimpses of herself in rusted metal walls: unfamiliar reflections, sharper, colder, a stranger wearing her face. <words>268</words>  
“You’re quiet,” Jax remarked, his voice echoing. <words>275</words>  
“Destiny’s rambling,” she replied, parroting his favorite phrase, and he grinned, oblivious. <words>291</words>  
At the reactor’s heart, she palmed the label onto the control panel, stealing the fingerprint—but the system hissed, red lights flaring. <words>315</words>  
Jax froze. <words>316</words>  
“You’re not here for the architecture,” he said flatly. <words>326</words>  
Before she could answer, the chef’s new recipe blared from a nearby screen: “Taste the future!” as crowds above cheered, chopsticks clattering. <words>351</words>  
The drones activated early. <words>354</words>  
Metallic shrieks erupted overhead, and Veyra sprinted, Jax at her heels, both outrunning the avalanche of machines shredding concrete. <words>377</words>  
In a dead-end alley, she faced him, panting. <words>386</words>  
“Why?” he demanded. <words>388</words>  
She kissed him—a distraction—and slipped the label into his jacket, transferring blame. <words>405</words>  
As enforcers dragged him away, he laughed, loud and broken. <words>417</words>  
“You’ll gloat eventually,” he spat. <words>423</words>  
But back at the noodle cart, Veyra stared at her broth, now cold, and wondered why victory tasted like rust. <words>444</words>  
Above, the drones still fell, endless and inevitable, like the memory of hands she’d once trusted. <words>464</words>  
She peeled the unused label from her pocket, its blank surface reflecting nothing at all. <words>483</words>
