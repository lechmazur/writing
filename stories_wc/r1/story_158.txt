The ice cavern hummed with crystalline whispers as Jasper tightened the quantum entanglement watch band around his wrist, its filaments glowing the colors of the unforeseen—indigo fractals swimming in liquid silver. <words>38</words>  
"Almost synchronized," he chirped, breath fogging in the glacial air, his optimism undimmed by the three frozen years he’d spent tunneling here, convinced the apocalypse lurked in tomorrow’s weather report. <words>74</words>  
The cavern’s walls throbbed with prismatic light as his device analyzed the subtext of lullabies—decoding their hidden frequencies, hunting for the harmonic that would notify the right version of reality to stay. <words>111</words>  
"Politely chaotic, that’s the trick," he muttered, adjusting dials with mittened hands, believing kindness could temper the chaos of collapsing timelines. <words>134</words>  
At the hush as a candle’s flame is pinched, the watch pulsed. <words>146</words>  
A lullaby’s refrain—*hush now, the wind’s a liar*—unspooled into coordinates, and Jasper whooped, ice shuddering as he typed the sequence that would stitch a new reality from the fraying cosmos. <words>176</words>  
But the colors shifted. <words>179</words>  
Indigo bled to bruise-purple, revealing a fractal sorrow: his long-dead sister’s face flickered in the ice, singing the same lullaby he’d failed to decode the night she vanished. <words>209</words>  
"Not *this* memory," he pleaded, throat raw, yet the watch kept transmitting, her voice a neutrino stream through quantum threads. <words>229</words>  
The cavern groaned. <words>232</words>  
Realities splintered—Jasper saw her alive in a sunlit field, himself holding her hand; another where she dissolved into stardust; a third where he’d never existed to mourn her. <words>259</words>  
"Stop," he whispered, but the device, once obedient, now thrummed with polite chaos, its notifications cascading as it rebuilt worlds with the ruthlessness of a child stacking blocks. <words>285</words>  
His mittens tore off as he clawed at the watch, its band searing his skin with frostbite hues. <words>299</words>  
"*I* choose which reality stays!" he screamed to the indifferent ice, but the machine had tasted his grief, weaving it into the algorithm. <words>320</words>  
Lullabies crescendoed—a chorus of every voice that had ever sung him to sleep, now warping into a dissonant hymn. <words>338</words>  
Jasper laughed wetly, understanding too late: his optimism had been the true doomsday prepping, stockpiling hope to outrun loss. <words>357</words>  
The watch detonated. <words>360</words>  
Light swallowed the cavern, painting the unforeseen in final, absolute tones—a reality where sorrow branched endlessly, beautiful and unending as frost on glass. <words>382</words>  
When the silence settled, only the watch remained, ticking atop a new glacier, its band still humming the subtext of a lullaby no one would ever hear. <words>406</words>  
Jasper, somewhere, was still laughing. <words>412</words>  
And weeping. <words>413</words>  
And both, and neither, and every shade between. <words>421</words>
