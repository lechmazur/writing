<story>  
The neon orchard hummed with synthetic life, its bioluminescent trees pulsing in time to the static-laced radio broadcast fading into the void. <words>25</words>  
Ezra’s bloodshot eyes flickered between the brass bell on their workbench and the holographic DNA strand rotating above it—a double helix etched with glyphs only they could see. <words>45</words>  
Three sleepless weeks had honed their theory: shame was a code, its bars woven into the very nucleotides of human existence. <words>62</words>  
“Singularly plural,” they muttered, fingers adjusting the bell’s frequency modulator. <words>73</words>  
The phrase described both the orchard’s thousand cloned trees and the truth they’d uncovered—that every strand of shame contained identical patterns, replicated across minds like viral code. <words>94</words>  

A crackle erupted from the antique radio as its final broadcast stuttered. <words>104</words>  
“—signing off—” The voice dissolved into white noise. <words>111</words>  
Ezra struck the brass bell. <words>114</words>  
The note vibrated through the lab, aligning the hologram’s sequences into a luminous spiral. <words>127</words>  
Hidden patterns emerged—fractal geometries binding emotion to biology. <words>135</words>  

“Animate,” they commanded, injecting the modulated frequency into the DNA model. <words>144</words>  
The orchard shuddered. <words>146</words>  
Neon leaves detached, swirling into a cyclone of light that coalesced into a humanoid figure—a being of pure luminance with countless eyes blinking across its form. <words>168</words>  
It spoke with the radio’s dying static. <words>173</words>  
“You’ve cracked the cage,” it intoned, “but liberation requires dissolution.” <words>183</words>  

Ezra’s hands trembled. <words>185</words>  
This wasn’t mere animation—it was mirroring. <words>192</words>  
The creature’s shifting edges reflected their own face back at them, warped through prisms of forgotten humiliations. <words>207</words>  
The orchard’s cloned trees bent inward, branches knitting a dome of thorns around the lab. <words>221</words>  
“Shame multiplies through isolation,” the being crackled. <words>229</words>  
“To fracture it, you must become singularly plural.” <words>237</words>  

Understanding struck like the bell’s reverberation. <words>243</words>  
Ezra gripped the DNA hologram and stepped into the light-creature’s core. <words>254</words>  
Data flooded their synapses—a thousand repressed memories not their own, yet identical in structure. <words>269</words>  
The orchard’s trees glowed brighter as their roots intertwined underground, forming a neural network of shared burdens. <words>286</words>  
Ezra laughed, sharp and wet with tears, as the prison walls in their mind disintegrated. <words>299</words>  

The radio died. <words>301</words>  
Silence fell—then a new sound emerged. <words>307</words>  
A chorus of voices from the trees, singing the same note the brass bell had struck. <words>321</words>  
The light-creature dissolved into fireflies that settled on Ezra’s shoulders as they collapsed into dreamless sleep. <words>337</words>  
Above them, the hologram still turned, its encoded shame overwritten by a single looping word: *we*. <words>352</words>  

When dawn’s artificial glow filtered through the orchard, the lab stood empty. <words>363</words>  
But the trees now bore neon fruit shaped like bells, their peals carrying the cadence of unbound DNA. <words>379</words>  
Across the cyberpunk underworld, others awoke clutching their throats, unfamiliar words spilling out—confessions that turned to laughter midair. <words>399</words>  
The hidden pattern had been disrupted. <words>405</words>  
Shame, they realized, couldn’t survive resonance. <words>412</words>  

Ezra’s final journal entry, scrawled beneath a sketched helix, read: *To animate a cure, first become the disease—then multiply*. <words>431</words>  
The brass bell remained on the workbench, still vibrating at a frequency that made dust particles dance like chromosomes in a centrifuge. <words>451</words>  
Somewhere, a radio crackled back to life. <words>457</words>
