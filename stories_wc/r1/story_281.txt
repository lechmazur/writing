<story>  
The baffled pickpocket crouched in the haunted lighthouse engine room, her fingers brushing the rusted gears as she counted seconds between appointments. <words>25</words>  
Her usual marks—wealthy tourists at the harbor—had vanished like smoke, leaving only the dummy. <words>41</words>  
It sat propped against a corroded boiler, its porcelain face cracked into a grin, glass eyes reflecting the flickering gaslight. <words>62</words>  
“Confusingly lucid,” she muttered, recoiling as its jaw clacked open. <words>73</words>  
A voice, honeyed and hollow, slithered out: *“Thief of coins, thief of time, what’s stolen can’t be truly mine.”* <words>91</words>  
She froze. <words>92</words>  
The ventriloquist dummy’s rhyme hung in the oily air, demanding reply. <words>103</words>  
“Is this a trick?” she hissed, but her own voice betrayed her, weaving an answer without consent: *“A shadow’s trade, a borrowed name—I’ll burn the ledger, break the frame.”* <words>132</words>  
The dummy’s head tilted, its painted eyebrows arching. <words>141</words>  
Power thrummed through the engine room, gears grinding slower, faster, as if the lighthouse itself breathed. <words>158</words>  
Between appointments—between thefts—she’d stumbled into a game older than the cliffs. <words>172</words>  
“Sustain the verse,” the dummy crooned, “or the tide claims your bones.” <words>185</words>  
Scorching poise steadied her. <words>189</words>  
She’d always hated poetry. <words>193</words>  
Yet here, in the art of transformation, syllables became tools: *“You, cobwebbed king of borrowed tongues—your crown’s a noose, your stage, a gun.”* <words>220</words>  
The dummy laughed, a sound like splintering wood. <words>229</words>  
“*Clever moth,*” it rasped. *“But flames don’t bargain.*” <words>241</words>  
The gaslight dimmed; the engine’s pulse quickened. <words>250</words>  
She realized then—this wasn’t haunting. <words>257</words>  
It was audition. <words>259</words>  
Every stolen watch, every lifted wallet had been practice for thieving something grander: the dummy’s voice, its centuries of spite. <words>283</words>  
*“Try,”* it goaded, as her mind raced. <words>291</words>  
*“You, ghost choked by your own script—your art’s a cage, your freedom, crypt,”* she spat, sweat dripping onto the floorboards. <words>315</words>  
The engine roared. <words>317</words>  
Gears spun into a blur of brass, and the dummy’s stitches began to unravel. <words>332</words>  
“*No!*” it shrieked, but its protest twisted into verse: *“You weave a web with borrowed thread—*” <words>351</words>  
“*—yet I’ll cut yours instead,*” she finished, grinning now. <words>363</words>  
The status quo of predator and prey splintered. <words>372</words>  
The dummy’s head snapped back, spewing sawdust and moths, as the lighthouse beacon flared violet. <words>390</words>  
When the light faded, only the pickpocket remained, clutching a silver key where the dummy had been. <words>409</words>  
Outside, the tide retreated, whispering promises of new appointments. <words>421</words>  
She pocketed the key, her bafflement sharpened into a blade. <words>433</words>  
The art of transformation, she understood, wasn’t about becoming someone else—but unmaking what refused to change. <words>455</words>  
The engine room fell silent, its haunted breath stilled, as she slipped into the dawn. <words>471</words>
