The city planner turned doomsday prepper traced his fingers over the antique ink blotter, its brass surface cold beneath the flickering glow of his lantern. <words>27</words> He’d stolen it from the mayor’s office years ago, a petty rebellion against the bureaucracy that once bound him—back when he still believed in blueprints over bunkers. <words>57</words> Now, inside the crumbling chambers of an ancient Indian temple, its geometric carvings mirrored the constellations he’d studied, fractured and rearranged by time. <words>89</words> “Rarely authentic,” he muttered, recalling the dealer who’d sold him the blotter, its provenance as dubious as his own motives. <words>113</words>  

Three years prior, at the second a handshake sealed a hidden deal, he’d traded his civic ideals for survivalist manuals, his grip firm as the dealer whispered, “Certainty is a currency, Mr. Voss.” <words>153</words> But certainty had curdled into obsession. <words>160</words> He’d debased himself—hoarding supplies, severing ties, etching star maps into his basement walls—all to outrun the dread that clawed at his ribs each night. <words>191</words> Yet here, beneath the temple’s sagging archways, doubt lingered like a venom. <words>208</words>  

The blotter’s intricate gears clicked as he pressed it against a mural of Ashvins, the twin horsemen galloping across a sky splintered by missing stars. <words>237</words> According to his notes, the gaps formed a code: a warning, or a way out. <words>253</words> His hands trembled. <words>256</words> What if the constellations were merely cracks in the stone, their meaning another delusion? <words>274</words> “No,” he hissed, teeth gritted. <words>279</words> Unyielding will had to suffice. <words>285</words>  

A draft snuffed his lantern. <words>289</words> Darkness swallowed the chamber, but he moved by memory, counting steps toward the sanctum where a pedestal held a single rusted key. <words>318</words> The dealer’s voice slithered back: *Escaping self-imposed chains requires sacrifice.* <words>334</words> Voss gripped the key, its teeth biting his palm. <words>345</words> Behind him, stone groaned. <words>350</words>  

Moonlight flooded the room as a hidden door yawned open, revealing a vault stocked not with gold, but soil packets and seed banks—a prepper’s trove, pristine and mocking. <words>383</words> His laugh echoed, raw and jagged. <words>391</words> All this time, he’d sought validation in relics and riddles, only to find another mirror of his compulsions. <words>415</words> The true chains weren’t the world’s collapse, but his refusal to see beyond it. <words>432</words>  

Voss dropped the key. <words>435</words> Dawn bled through the temple’s cracks, illuminating the blotter’s engravings—not stars, but winding vines, growth insisting through stone. <words>460</words> For the first time in years, he inhaled deeply, the air sweet with rot and possibility. <words>478</words> Outside, a parakeet shrieked. <words>483</words> He stepped into the light, leaving the ink-stained shadows to dissolve behind him. <words>500</words>
