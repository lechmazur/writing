The jungle curator floated through her museum’s overgrown halls, fingertips brushing orchids that hummed with the dull radiance of half-forgotten stars. <words>28</words> Her sanctuary—a Mesopotamian temple rebuilt among clouds—drifted above canopies where guilt’s roar echoed louder each dawn. <words>52</words> Yesterday, she’d shattered the ice-crystal violin, its transparent strings silent since the day her miscalculation let poachers raze the eastern grove. <words>82</words> But this morning, shards glowed anew, whispering a logically illogical truth: to repopulate the dead, she must carry its fragments into the rot’s heart. <words>111</words>  

An engine sputtered outside. <words>114</words> The temple lurched, veering toward a storm—a road trip unintended, unavoidable. <words>128</words> Lirael clutched the violin’s remnants, their cold seeping into her bones like the touch of wonder she’d once felt naming every leaf. <words>153</words> Below, the jungle sprawled, its scars veiled by mist. <words>163</words> She leapt onto a supply dirigible, its course set for the silent overture of tomorrow—a valley where roots remembered song. <words>186</words>  

Rain hissed as she landed, the ice shards now a compass needle. <words>196</words> Logic said frost couldn’t thrive here; logic hadn’t met the temple’s architects, who’d baked paradox into every brick. <words>216</words> By dusk, Lirael stood in a clearing where petrified trees clawed at the sky. <words>231</words> She pressed a shard to her lips, exhaling a note that crystallized air. <words>245</words> The violin regrew, its strings spinning light into sound, sound into saplings punching through ash. <words>263</words>  

But ice melts. <words>265</words> Each note cost her: fingertips numb, breath ragged. <words>273</words> The dirigible’s fuel leaked, stranding her as thorns thickened. <words>284</words> Yet the forest quickened—parrots hatched from melted strings, jaguars coalescing from shadows. <words>298</words> Her guilt, once a wildfire, dimmed to embers. <words>307</words>  

Dawn found her kneeling, the violin now a husk. <words>315</words> But where it lay, a seedling unfurled, its leaves chiming. <words>326</words> The temple hovered above, engines dead but vines cradling it aloft. <words>339</words> Lirael laughed, a sound like rain on glass. <words>348</words> She’d followed an illogical path—breaking to mend, falling to rise—and in that contradiction, life surged. <words>368</words>  

Years later, travelers would speak of a floating museum where music sprouted forests. <words>381</words> They’d marvel at its curator, who hushed guilt with frost and fury, her hands forever gloved to hide the scars. <words>400</words> But in her heart, she kept the touch of wonder: the moment logic bent, and the world began again. <words>421</words>
