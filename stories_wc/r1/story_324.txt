The secret agent headquarters hummed with sterile light, its labyrinthine corridors holding secrets like teeth in a clenched jaw. <words>18</words>  
In Sublevel Nine’s lab, Advisor Veyra adjusted her gloves, her reflection warped in the glass cylinder housing the brain—pale, floating, labeled *DUPLICATE* in peeling red letters. <words>40</words>  
“It’s not *her*,” she whispered, though the synaptic patterns flickering inside mirrored Director Kael’s neural maps exactly—*too* exactly. <words>57</words>  
The rumor had come via a defector’s dying breath: *Find the Dreamer’s Calling where footsteps echo twice*. <words>72</words>  
Veyra’s superiors dismissed it as delirium, but she’d spent nights tracing decayed surveillance feeds to an abandoned observatory, its halls haunted by the ghostly cadence of boots no one wore. <words>97</words>  
“A malfunction,” they’d said. <words>100</words>  
But the brain’s glass surface fogged as she leaned closer, as if breathing. <words>112</words>  
*What if the defector meant the Calling isn’t a place—but a person?* <words>123</words>  
Her comlink buzzed—Director Kael’s voice, crisp. <words>129</words>  
“Terminate the project. <words>131</words>  
No more fantasies.” <words>134</words>  
Veyra’s finger hovered over the disposal command. <words>140</words>  
Then she jabbed the syringe into the brain’s nutrient feed, injecting a stimulant. <words>151</words>  
The cortex flared electric blue. <words>156</words>  
Memories flooded her neural link: Kael, years younger, weeping over a second brain in a bunker buried under the observatory. <words>173</words>  
*“Which one is real?”* a technician asked. <words>179</words>  
*“Does it matter?”* Kael had replied. <words>185</words>  
Now, the duplicate’s consciousness stirred—a fractured idyll of equations and lullabies. <words>196</words>  
*Find me*, it whispered in a voice that was and wasn’t Kael’s. <words>207</words>  
Veyra fled to the observatory, its dome cracked open to a sky smothered by static clouds—the simmering future holding its breath. <words>225</words>  
Her footsteps echoed, then doubled. <words>230</words>  
She froze. <words>231</words>  
Behind her, the Director stood aiming a tremorless pistol. <words>239</words>  
“You were always too curious for an advisor.” <words>246</words>  
“Which of you ordered the duplicate’s destruction?” Veyra demanded. <words>256</words>  
Kael smiled, a clearly ambiguous curve of lips. <words>264</words>  
“The *Calling* isn’t a relic. <words>268</words>  
It’s the moment a copy realizes it’s redundant.” <words>276</words>  
The brain’s memories surged again: Kael’s hands trembling as she labeled the jar, terrified the original had died decades ago. <words>295</words>  
Veyra lunged, knocking the pistol aside. <words>301</words>  
They grappled beneath the broken telescope, its lens reflecting dual Kaels—one gasping, one coldly resolved. <words>317</words>  
The duplicate’s voice pierced Veyra’s mind. <words>323</words>  
*You’re both real. <words>326</words>  
Both dreaming.* <words>329</words>  
Kael’s grip slackened. <words>332</words>  
In that hesitation, Veyra pressed the syringe to the Director’s neck. <words>342</words>  
“You chased your rumor,” Kael rasped. <words>349</words>  
“Now you’ll never know which of us you saved.” <words>358</words>  
The stimulant hissed into veins. <words>363</words>  
Kael’s scream harmonized with the duplicate’s static-filled wail miles away—a dissonance that shook the observatory’s bones. <words>380</words>  
When the silence settled, Veyra sat alone, the pistol heavy in her lap. <words>393</words>  
Two sets of footsteps echoed again, fading where the hallway shouldn’t exist. <words>405</words>  
She followed, her insecurity calcifying into a terrible certainty: the Dreamer’s Calling wasn’t a choice, but an echo that outlived its source. <words>426</words>  
The headquarters’ lights blinked out one by one behind her, swallowing the proof. <words>438</words>
