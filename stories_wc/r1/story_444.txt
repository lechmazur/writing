The sunken zeppelin’s ribs arched like a cathedral’s skeleton, its corroded hull cradling shadows that swayed with the ocean’s pulse. <words>25</words> Ambassador Veyra traced the threadbare ghost costume draped over her arm—a relic from her daughter’s last play, its frayed edges whispering of laughter drowned by war. <words>49</words> Between bursts of radio static, she methodically unfolded letters, each page a stitch in time: 1942, 1987, 2031, names and pleas bleeding into one another. <words>74</words> “They cling to dreams like lifeboats,” she murmured, her voice a blade sheathed in velvet. <words>91</words> The chain of correspondence had led her here, to this drowned leviathan, where shared dreams pooled like oil on water. <words>111</words>  

She slipped the costume on, its gauze clinging to her skin like a second conscience. <words>125</words> The zeppelin’s rusted floor shuddered as the first dreamer’s mind brushed hers—a soldier in a trench, scribbling lies to a sweetheart he’d never meet. <words>149</words> Veyra stepped into his psyche, a mender and a thief. <words>159</words> “Hold this,” she whispered, pressing a letter into his trembling hands, its ink smudged by futures he wouldn’t survive. <words>180</words> His relief curdled to horror as her words rewrote his memories, replacing romance with the acid truth of mortar fire. <words>200</words>  

Indoctrination, she’d learned, required playfulness: a game of tag through trauma, a riddle wrapped in shrapnel. <words>217</words> The next dreamer was a child, her night terrors embroidered with sirens and ash. <words>230</words> Veyra knelt, offering a paper crane folded from a 21st-century suicide note. <words>243</words> “Fold it again,” she coaxed, her calm frenzy a lullaby, “and the war goes quiet.” <words>258</words> The girl complied, each crease hushing another illusion—father’s return, mother’s embrace, safety in smoke. <words>276</words>  

Radio static crackled—a temporal tide pulling Veyra back. <words>285</words> Her fingers gripped the zeppelin’s ladder, reality’s edges fraying. <words>295</words> Letters swirled around her, dates dissolving as the chain tightened. <words>306</words> One remained: her own name, scrawled in her daughter’s hand, sealed days before the bombs fell. <words>324</words> She’d never opened it. <words>327</words> To read it would be to admit the ghost costume was all she had left—that every soul she’d “saved” was a stand-in for the child she’d failed to protect. <words>353</words>  

The static surged. <words>355</words> Veyra lunged into the final dream, a hollow-eyed engineer plotting vengeance in 2076. <words>370</words> “They’re lies,” she hissed, thrusting the costume’s hem into his fists. <words>381</words> “Pull.” <words>382</words> Threads unraveled, revealing the zeppelin’s wreckage, the engineer’s future self bloated and drowned. <words>397</words> He screamed—but the scream became a laugh, then a sigh, as the truth hollowed him lighter. <words>414</words>  

Back in the corroded present, Veyra clutched her unopened letter. <words>425</words> The static stilled. <words>427</words> For a breath, she almost believed the silence was peace. <words>437</words> Then the ghosts began anew—hers, theirs, the world’s—whispering through the zeppelin’s bones. <words>453</words> She smoothed the costume’s wrinkles, ready to dive again. <words>464</words> Comfort was a prison. <words>467</words> And she? <words>468</words> The warden, the key, the thief in the night, methodically tearing down walls others called salvation. <words>485</words> The radio hummed. <words>487</words> Between its static, another dreamer waited. <words>495</words>
