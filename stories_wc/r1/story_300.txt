The determined outlaw adjusted her frayed tunic, her fingers brushing the simple cloth pouch at her belt as she stepped into the cacophony of the ancient Roman marketplace. <words>30</words> Vendors hawked garum and olive oil beneath crumbling arches, their voices sharp with earnest mockery, but her gaze lingered on the disused canvases stacked beside a pigment merchant’s stall—their edges flecked with dried paint smudges. <words>63</words> She’d spent weeks browsing imperial trash heaps and forgotten workshops, matching those smudges like puzzle pieces, tracing a trail only she could see. <words>89</words> "Looking for inspiration, or just admiring my trash?" the merchant sneered, tossing a bruised fig into the dust. <words>110</words>  

"Neither," she replied, her tone wistfully pragmatic as she held up a canvas fragment. <words>124</words> A cobalt streak on its corner aligned perfectly with a vermilion blotch on another—a hidden map pointing toward the marketplace’s oldest quarter. <words>147</words> The shimmer of possibility had haunted her since childhood, a faint glow in her periphery whenever she neared artifacts of the old gods. <words>170</words> Now, it pulsed like a heartbeat beneath her boots. <words>177</words>  

She ducked into a shadowed alley where moss devoured marble, her pouch trembling as she withdrew a shard of obsidian. <words>196</words> The stone hummed, its surface reflecting not light, but a labyrinth of veins beneath the earth—a dormant power source, buried when the Republic fell. <words>221</words> "Almost there," she whispered, though the words tasted like a lie. <words>232</words> Every step since the fire that claimed her family had been a calculation, a trade of hope for survival. <words>251</words>  

A beggar’s cough startled her; she spun, dagger drawn, but found only a stray cat batting at a mosaic’s tarnished gold. <words>270</words> The shimmer intensified, guiding her to a sealed cistern choked with weeds. <words>282</words> Her hands shook as she pried open the rusted hatch, revealing a staircase swallowed by darkness. <words>298</words> Down she climbed, the obsidian’s glow swelling until she staggered into a cavernous chamber. <words>314</words>  

There it lay: a crystalline orb cradled in a nest of roots, its light fracturing into prismatic rivers that danced across the walls. <words>337</words> The power source—stolen by Vestal Virgins, lost to war, now hers. <words>350</words> She reached for it, but the roots tightened, thorns biting her wrist. <words>363</words> "You’d think the gods would make theft easier," she muttered, slicing the vines with her blade. <words>381</words>  

As the orb settled into her pouch, the chamber trembled, dust cascading from the ceiling. <words>396</words> She fled, the marketplace’s chaos now a distant murmur as she vanished into the crowd. <words>411</words> At the city gates, she paused, clutching the pouch that hummed with stolen divinity. <words>427</words> The threshold of discovery yawned before her—not an end, but a beginning. <words>442</words> She grinned, breathless, already imagining the worlds this power could unravel. <words>456</words> Behind her, Rome buzzed on, oblivious to the fissure she’d carved in its history. <words>473</words>  

The outlaw melted into the horizon, where the sun bled gold and the shimmer clung to her like a second shadow. <words>493</words>
