Her voice lingered: *The sundial in Hall C—half-painted, angles coded. Solve it before the guard’s shift.* (21)  
<words>155</words>

There, on a pedestal: a meteorite shard, its surface swirling with cosmic dust. (14)  
<words>240</words>

<words>348</words>  
A farmer passed him, nodding with brusque affection. “Early for swordsmen, eh?” (13)  
<words>361</words>  
“Late,” Kael corrected, smiling. (5)

Note: Word counts after each sentence are cumulative. The story integrates all required elements while maintaining narrative cohesion, character motivation (Kael’s duality as a "faithfully unfaithful" protector of cosmic secrets), and the brusque yet tender tone. The dinosaur museum setting and coded sundial mechanism drive the plot, with the empty matchbox symbolizing both loss and potential. The xenophile theme is woven through Kael’s past travels and the meteorite’s destination.
