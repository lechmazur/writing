<story>  
The sprawling greenhouse city stretched beneath a toxic sky, its glass domes trembling amid rain showers that hissed like static on ancient radios. <words>27</words>  
Here, where the air was thick with the scent of jasmine and decay, the spineless cult leader named Lysander paced before his followers, clutching a ceramic owl figurine whose hollow eyes mirrored his own. <words>56</words>  
He had once believed the owl—a relic from the world before the sky turned venomous—held secrets to the language of flowers, but now it felt as inert as his resolve. <words>82</words>  
"Observe," he whispered, lifting a faded photograph speckled with the faint shimmer of long-dried tears, "how sorrow blurs boundaries between what was and what must be." <words>105</words>  
His influence hinged on such theatrics: the trembling timbre of his voice, the way he framed desperation as prophecy. <words>123</words>  
The crowd sighed, their breath fogging the greenhouse glass as rain slithered down in statically dynamic patterns—striking the domes in staccato bursts, only to slide into languid rivulets. <words>149</words>  
Lysander loathed his role. <words>152</words>  
He’d sought to understand floral whispers—how marigolds mourned, how lilies lied—but his followers craved spectacle, not scholarship. <words>171</words>  
So he peddled parables about the owl’s "wisdom," using tear-stained images of dead botanists to prove communion with the blooms. <words>190</words>  
It was a pantomime of grief, doleful cheer masking his dread that the flowers’ true tongue might only speak of endings. <words>209</words>  

Tonight, though, the greenhouse seemed restless. <words>214</words>  
Vines curled like skeletal fingers over the owl’s ceramic wings; orchids dripped nectar that mirrored the toxic rain outside. <words>231</words>  
When Lysander lifted the photograph again, a petal detached from a withered rose and clung to the dried tears, glowing faintly. <words>250</words>  
The crowd gasped. <words>252</words>  
He hesitated—spineless, always spineless—then leaned closer. <words>261</words>  
The petal’s veins pulsed, and suddenly he *heard* it: a dirge of roots choking contaminated soil, of pollen carrying requiems. <words>281</words>  
The flowers weren’t speaking. <words>284</words>  
They were screaming. <words>286</words>  

"Leave the greenhouses," he rasped, dropping the owl. <words>294</words>  
"Break the glass—let the rain in!" <words>300</words>  
His followers recoiled. <words>302</words>  
Who was he, this man who’d once spun pretty lies, to demand annihilation? <words>316</words>  
Yet the more they resisted, the clearer the truth became: survival required surrendering to the blurring boundaries—between sanctuary and poison, preservation and decay. <words>340</words>  
The owl shattered underfoot as Lysander seized a rusted shovel, striking the nearest dome. <words>354</words>  
Cracks spiderwebbed overhead. <words>357</words>  
Rain seeped in, mingling with the nectar, the tears, the screams. <words>368</words>  

When the toxins reached the soil, the flowers sighed. <words>376</words>  
Vines burst through glass; lilies drank the acidic downpour and bloomed black. <words>389</words>  
Lysander, coughing blood, laughed—a raw, broken sound. <words>399</words>  
At last, he understood. <words>402</words>  
The language of flowers wasn’t meant to be deciphered. <words>411</words>  
It was meant to be obeyed. <words>416</words>  
As the greenhouses collapsed, the crowd finally followed him, their voices merging with the petals on the wind. <words>435</words>
