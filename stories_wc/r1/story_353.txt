<story>  
The small-town baker kneaded dough with cynically gentle hands, her fingers dusted in flour and resignation. <words>20</words>  
She’d inherited the crumbling shop from her mother, who’d whispered secrets about pressed flowers hidden in the recipe book—petals that could “exceed their fragility” if steeped in moonlight. <words>47</words>  
But the emergency time machine garage beneath her bakery demanded sterner ingredients: gears greased with urgency, and a contagion brewing in its core. <words>70</words>  
The seeds—glowing, viral things—had arrived last autumn, smuggled inside a customer’s loaf, their roots whispering of a tyrant who’d strangled the future. <words>93</words>  
Now, as shadows began to rasp prophecies against the walls, she calibrated the machine’s dials by tracking moon patterns etched into her mother’s floral pressed into the ceiling. <words>120</words>  
“Time’s a dough that won’t rise twice,” her mother had warned, but the baker intended to fold it. <words>138</words>  
The tyrant’s face loomed in newspapers nailed to her shop’s walls—a man who’d outlawed gardens, fearing blossoms might hide rebellions. <words>157</words>  
Her plan was half-recipe, half-madness: plant the seeds in his past, let their roots split his reign apart. <words>175</words>  
The machine shuddered, its brass coils humming as she placed the pressed flowers into its ignition chamber—a fragile key for an engine built to outrun doom. <words>199</words>  
Shadows pooled around her ankles, their voices gravel and static. <words>208</words>  
“He’ll smell the pollen in your blood,” they hissed. <words>216</words>  
She ignored them, focusing on the lunar phases painted on her wrists like flour tattoos. <words>228</words>  
Midnight approached. <words>230</words>  
The machine’s door groaned open, revealing a corridor of fractured years. <words>242</words>  
She stepped into 1923, her apron pockets heavy with seeds and spite. <words>253</words>  
The tyrant’s childhood home loomed ahead, its windows dark. <words>263</words>  
She buried the first seed beneath his doorstep, the soil hissing as it absorbed the contagion. <words>279</words>  
But the moon faltered—clouds veiling its light—and the machine’s recall beacon sputtered. <words>294</words>  
Panic rose like overproofed dough. <words>299</words>  
A shadow detached from the oak above, its form resolving into a boy with her mother’s eyes. <words>316</words>  
“You’ll need more than flowers to dethrone a king,” he said, pressing a vial of starlight into her palm. <words>335</words>  
The baker hesitated, then poured it into the earth. <words>344</words>  
Vines erupted, crystalline and ravenous, cracking the tyrant’s foundation. <words>355</words>  
The present unraveled. <words>357</words>  
She woke in her garage, the machine smoking, the air stinging of burnt thyme. <words>370</words>  
Outside, the town square buzzed—no soldiers, no sirens, just sunlit stalls selling marigold cakes and dandelion wine. <words>389</words>  
The newspapers now showed a blank space where the tyrant’s face had been. <words>402</words>  
In her recipe book, a new entry: “How to Bake a Revolution.” <words>413</words>  
The pressed flowers inside glowed faintly, their petals etched with tiny moons. <words>426</words>  
The shadows, now silent, curled contentedly around her ankles like cats. <words>438</words>  
She kneaded again, her hands still gentle, her heart less cynical. <words>449</words>  
Some recipes required patience. <words>453</words>  
Others demanded a well-timed spark. <words>459</words>  
And the seeds? <words>462</words>  
They’d already begun to bloom. <words>468</words>
