The abandoned waiting area hummed with the static of forgotten intercoms, its cracked vinyl chairs and faded "Now Serving" signs bathed in the cold glow of Lena’s holographic screen. <words>30</words> She adjusted the plain wooden bead on her wrist, its unremarkable surface hiding circuitry that synced with the antique funhouse mirror leaning against a boarded-up ticket booth. <words>58</words> War had taught her this: silence could scream louder than bombs, if you knew how to listen. <words>76</words>  

"Your insights on the Treaty of Marseille were *brilliant*, Councilor," Lena said, her voice artfully clumsy, tripping over flattery like a novice actor. <words>98</words> On-screen, the politician preened, oblivious to the distortions rippling across the mirror behind her—a map of his lies, bending light into coiled serpents. <words>128</words> To master the ancient art of Axiomancers, she needed to trace every lie back to its source, even as virtual calls pixelated the world into fragments. <words>155</words>  

A flicker in the mirror’s glass. <words>159</words> Lena spun, bead buzzing, and "stumbled" into a rusted luggage cart, sending it clattering—artful clumsiness masking her lunge toward the shadow darting behind a pillar. <words>186</words> The assassin froze, knife glinting, as Lena’s feigned embarrassment dissolved into a crescent kick. <words>204</words> War’s price was etched in her marrow: seven years since the drone strike that vaporized her orchestra mid-performance, seven years parsing violence into a language sharper than violins. <words>236</words>  

"Who sent you?" she hissed, pinning the attacker’s wrist. <words>245</words> The mirror shuddered, showing not the present struggle but a memory: a general’s office, a contract signed with a blood-inked pen. <words>268</words> The bead heated—*now*. <words>271</words> Lena yanked the assassin’s sleeve, revealing a tattooed coordinates cluster. <words>283</words> "Tell him I’m coming," she whispered, "and that his war’s about to cost double." <words>298</words>  

Back at the mirror, the councilor droned about peace dividends. <words>306</words> Lena smiled, feeding him another compliment while tracing the coordinates’ distortion pattern—a hidden arms depot, swirling in the glass like ink in water. <words>331</words> Every flattery-laced word tightened the noose. <words>340</words> Her mentor’s ghost had warned her: Axiomancy demanded balance. <words>352</words> For every lie unraveled, a truth had to burn. <words>363</words>  

When the call ended, Lena pressed the wooden bead to the mirror. <words>375</words> The depot’s location seared into her palm, a blistering cipher. <words>387</words> She pocketed a shard of glass, its edges singing with the screams she’d swallowed since the bombs fell. <words>407</words> Outside, rain hissed against rubble. <words>413</words> The vigilante walked into the storm, bead humming, her silence outshouting the thunder. <words>430</words>
