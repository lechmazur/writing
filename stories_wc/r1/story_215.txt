The rattled exorcist adjusted his tie in the mirrored lobby of the psychic research facility, its walls humming with dormant machines and the faint tang of ozone. <words>28</words>  
He’d been hired to "entwine science with wonder," as Director Voss put it—though his hands still trembled from last week’s botched séance. <words>50</words>  
A vintage postcard slipped from his pocket mid-stride: a faded seaside pier, its cursive script urging, *"Solve the steps, or the tide takes her."* <words>72</words>  
It wasn’t his; it had arrived anonymously, wedged between dance lesson pamphlets for the facility’s "kinetic stress relief" program. <words>90</words>  
Three days prior, amid a waltz session, he’d noticed the first puzzle—a cipher etched into the ballroom’s parquet floor. <words>109</words>  
Now, clues multiplied: equations on chalkboards rearranged into spectral sigils, EEG monitors flickering coordinates only he could decode. <words>128</words>  
Director Voss watched him with coy aggression, her smile sharp as she remarked, "You’re *inwardly social*, aren’t you? Always listening to voices others ignore." <words>154</words>  
Guarded disclosures came reluctantly—the postcard matched a case from his past, a girl lost to a possession he’d failed to stop. <words>175</words>  
Synthesizing data and dread, he aligned the facility’s quantum resonance maps with the postcard’s coordinates, revealing a hidden chamber beneath the lab. <words>198</words>  
Inside, a glass tank held the girl’s preserved body, suspended in fluid that glowed like drowned starlight. <words>216</words>  
Voss materialized behind him, her voice silk-wrapped steel: "Science needs specters to stay relevant. You’ll exorcise her properly this time—or she becomes our specimen." <words>242</words>  
The exorcist’s fingers brushed the tank, memories colliding—the girl’s laughter, the ritual’s collapse, the demon’s taunt: *"You dance with shadows but fear the orchestra."* <words>268</words>  
Puzzles now made sense: each step mirrored his past failures, forcing him to confront his reliance on rote prayers over intuition. <words>287</words>  
He recalibrated the tank’s magnetic field, weaving liturgy into lab equipment, until the girl’s eyes snapped open—clear, human. <words>307</words>  
"Checkmate," Voss murmured, but the exorcist yanked the postcard from his pocket, its hidden layer peeling to reveal a final riddle: *"Who guards the guard?"* <words>331</words>  
The room’s walls shifted, sealing Voss inside as the girl’s form dissolved into light. <words>344</words>  
Her voice echoed, freed: "She experimented on me after your failure. You synthesized the keys—now burn this place." <words>363</words>  
Alarms blared as he fled, the facility’s dance studio erupting into flames behind him, tangoing with the night wind. <words>381</words>  
In the ashes, investigators found the postcard intact, its message now reading: *"Wonder isn’t yours to cage."* <words>398</words>  
The exorcist vanished, though rumors claimed he frequented seaside piers, mailing cryptic cards to those still brave enough to solve them. <words>421</words>  
His hands steadier now, he’d learned the hardest truth: some doors, once opened, demand a dance with both logic and lightning. <words>443</words>
