The jaded bartender wiped the bloodstained medical scalpel with a lab cloth, its edge catching the violet light of the crystal growing chamber. <words>25</words> Around her, geodes pulsed like dormant hearts in the laboratory’s sterile glow, their formations echoing the fractured timelines she’d tried to forget. <words>50</words> She’d traded cocktail shakers for centrifuges two years ago, desperate to globalize her search for answers—but the past clung like sulfur in the air. <words>76</words> Tonight, in the final stillness before fireworks ignited over the city’s anniversary celebration, she spread crumpled receipts across the lab bench, each marked with overlapping doodles from patrons she’d served. <words>112</words> A genuinely strange pattern had emerged: the same jagged spire sketched by strangers worldwide, converging into a map only visible when layered. <words>138</words>  

“Coordinates,” she muttered, aligning a Tokyo taxi receipt with one from Marrakech. <words>150</words> The spire matched the crystal lattice on her latest experiment—a synthetic mineral that hummed when exposed to specific frequencies. <words>170</words> Her hands trembled. <words>173</words> The scalpel, retrieved from the ruins of her old life, had cut deeper than flesh once; now, it might carve a path through fate itself. <words>200</words>  

A notification buzzed—her algorithm had linked another doodle from Buenos Aires, completing the circuit. <words>218</words> She injected the coordinates into the lab’s reactor, and the chamber flared azure as crystals erupted in dendritic spirals. <words>237</words> Memories surged: a surgeon’s oath, a patient’s last breath, the scalpel slipping as sirens wailed. <words>254</words> She’d buried her name that night, but the world kept drawing her back. <words>269</words>  

Outside, the first firework exploded, painting the lab in fleeting gold. <words>282</words> The reactor’s display flickered—a live feed from a cave system beneath Iceland, where identical crystals glowed. <words>300</words> Dozens of labs, she realized, had unknowingly replicated her work, their combined data forming a key. <words>318</words> To understand the past, she’d have to fracture it. <words>328</words>  

She pressed the scalpel to the master crystal, its vibration syncing with the fireworks’ crescendo. <words>343</words> Light refracted into a spectrum that seared her retinas—and there, in the afterimage, stood the ghost of her first failure: a man whose heartbeat had once faltered beneath her blade. <words>374</words> “You’re chasing echoes,” he whispered, but she grinned, sharp and hopeful. <words>390</words>  

“Echoes leave trails.” <words>393</words> She shattered the crystal. <words>396</words>  

The lab plunged into darkness, then reignited as every dormant geode bloomed with inner fire. <words>414</words> On the receipts, the doodles rearranged into a single phrase: *Find the source.* <words>429</words> The bartender pocketed the scalpel, her desperation now a compass. <words>442</words> Somewhere between the fireworks and the void, fate was a thread—and she’d just pulled it. <words>460</words>
