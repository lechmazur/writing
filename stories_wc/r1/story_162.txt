The reverse engineering workshop hummed beneath the flicker of cathode-ray screens, their glow illuminating shelves cluttered with obsolete cassette players and towers of unlabeled videotapes. <words>30</words>  
Jace, a carefree gambler with a penchant for high-stakes poker and low-stakes regrets, spun the fragment of a top-secret blueprint between his fingers like a worn chip. <words>54</words>  
"Still think it’s worth the trouble?" Lena asked, her voice cutting through the static of a VCR rewinding decades-old footage. <words>76</words>  
He smirked, though his usual levity felt thin here, amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched—ghosts of lives half-remembered. <words>98</words>  
The blueprint scrap, stolen from a corporate vault in Macau, depicted part of a seismic stabilizer, a device meant to silence volcanic murmurs beneath artificial islands. <words>127</words>  
Island memories haunted him: his mother’s laughter in Okinawa, the scent of salt and sulfur, the way the ground trembled before the eruption. <words>149</words>  
Lena, uniquely trustworthy in a world of double-crossers, had decrypted the fragment’s coordinates to this cluttered workshop. <words>169</words>  
"Chaos needs a counterweight," Jace said, tossing the blueprint onto a workbench cluttered with oscilloscopes and soldering irons. <words>189</words>  
Their shared secret bound them tighter than blood—a night in Jakarta when she’d saved him from a rigged game, and he’d spared her from a bullet. <words>213</words>  
Now, they refocused the workshop’s tech to reconstruct the stabilizer, not for profit, but to find harmony in chaos, to quiet the tremors of past and planet alike. <words>239</words>  
Lena slotted a videotape into a player; grainy footage showed a laboratory swallowed by lava. <words>254</words>  
"Corporate cover-up," she muttered. "They built resorts on dormant fire. Now the blueprints are buried, and the islands…" <words>274</words>  
Jace’s fingers stilled. "They’re sitting on a time bomb." <words>284</words>  
The workshop’s air thickened with hammered repose—the calm of a blacksmith shaping molten metal, each strike deliberate, transformative. <words>303</words>  
By dawn, they’d reverse-engineered a prototype, its core a lattice of titanium and memory. <words>318</words>  
Jace held it up, the stabilizer glinting like a dice tossed toward destiny. <words>331</words>  
"Will it work?" Lena asked, though her tone said she already knew. <words>343</words>  
He grinned, the gambler’s mask slipping back. "Odds are fifty-fifty." <words>355</words>  
But as they boarded the cargo plane to Okinawa, the fragment’s schematics folded into his pocket, Jace felt certainty settle in his ribs. <words>377</words>  
The islands deserved more than to be graves. <words>385</words>  
Over the Pacific, Lena played the final tape—a child’s birthday party on a beach, now ash. <words>401</words>  
Jace closed his eyes, the stabilizer’s hum syncing with his pulse. <words>413</words>  
Chaos had always been his currency, but this? <words>421</words>  
This was a wager even he couldn’t lose. <words>429</words>  
The plane dipped through clouds, toward the fault lines and the ghosts, as the workshop’s tapes kept spinning in the dark, unwatched but unforgotten. <words>450</words>
