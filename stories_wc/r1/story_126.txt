The shipwrecked merchant clutched the rustic butter churn to his chest, its wooden slats groaning as he staggered through the ghost station’s hollow corridors. <words>27</words> Around him, flickering holograms advertised alpine meadows and coral reefs—destinations erased centuries before the last tree fell. <words>50</words> His boots crunched over shards of glass from shattered observation domes, the void beyond breathing static through cracks. <words>73</words> The churn, salvaged from Earth’s final agrarian outpost, hummed with rebellious sparks that singed his calloused palms. <words>97</words> It was honestly strange how something so mundane could feel like a weapon. <words>109</words>  

He paused beneath a travel poster peeling into fractal patterns, its flaking edges curling like beckoning fingers. <words>129</words> Years ago, he’d traded silks and spices between colony worlds, blind to the grand illusion: that humanity could outrun its hunger. <words>153</words> Now, adrift in this derelict orbit, he’d become a smuggler of truths. <words>166</words> The churn’s sparks leapt to the poster, etching a luminous path upward. <words>181</words> To ascend here meant rejecting gravity’s lie, the pretense that roots still mattered in a universe unmoored. <words>201</words>  

The station shuddered as he climbed, hand over hand, into the poster’s dissolving scenery. <words>217</words> Alpine air—synthetic, sharp—filled his lungs, and for a heartbeat, he almost believed the illusion. <words>235</words> Then he gripped the churn tighter, its sparks searing through the false sky, exposing riveted metal and the observation deck’s skeletal frame. <words>257</words> They’d turned preservation into a museum, Earth’s corpse gawked at by tourists sipping nebula wine. <words>275</words> But he’d seen the last tree fall, its roots choked by plastic blooms. <words>288</words>  

Aloof passion guided him now, colder than solar winds. <words>298</words> On the deck, a crowd murmured at the vista: Earth, swaddled in emerald projections, its scars airbrushed to verdancy. <words>318</words> The merchant raised the churn, its sparks arcing into the station’s power grid. <words>333</words> Lights dimmed. Screens fractured. The illusion rippled, revealing the planet’s true face—a barren orb veiled in storms. <words>354</words> Gasps curdled into screams, but he smiled, watching the rebellious sparks multiply. <words>370</words>  

They’d called him mad for hauling the churn through wreckages and wormholes. <words>383</words> Yet as its电流 surged, dissolving the station’s facade, he understood: rebellion wasn’t a blaze but a persistent flicker, eroding lies grain by grain. <words>407</words> The poster’s remnants swirled around him, carrying the scent of pine that no longer existed. <words>424</words> Let them see. Let it hurt. <words>430</words>  

When security drones descended, he swung the churn like an anchor, its sparks fusing with their circuits, birthing erratic new constellations. <words>451</words> The deck’s windows cracked open, vacuum howling in, but he didn’t flinch. <words>466</words> Ascension required falling first. <words>470</words> As the station fractured, he stepped into the stars’ indifferent embrace, the butter churn still humming—a rustic, honest strangeness against the cosmic dark. <words>495</words>
