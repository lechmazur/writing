<story>  
In the hush of the barn loft just after sunrise, Ezra oiled the gears of a brass-winged automaton, their calloused hands steady despite the tremor in their voice. <words>34</words> "The world’s a clock winding down," they murmured, as though reciting a grocery list, their calmness at odds with the prophecy. <words>60</words> Below, their steampunk workshop hummed—a faithfully odd labyrinth of hissing pistons, mismatched cogs, and half-built contraptions that smelled of burnt copper and regret. <words>89</words> Leaning against a rusted turbine was their battered old skateboard, its grip tape peeling and stickers faded—a relic from a time when asphalt, not apocalypse, consumed their thoughts. <words>118</words>  

A distant train whistle sliced the stillness, its mournful cry tugging at the frayed edges of memory. <words>136</words> Ezra’s jaw tightened. <words>139</words> At sixteen, they’d ridden that midnight freight, fleeing a home choked by silence, the skateboard tucked under their arm like a shield. <words>166</words> Now, at forty-three, they understood innocence wasn’t lost—it was abandoned, piece by piece, in choices made to survive. <words>190</words>  

The automaton whirred to life, its glass eyes flickering with liquid amber. <words>202</words> Ezra slid the skateboard into its undercarriage, aligning vintage wheels with chrome turbines. <words>217</words> "Resume," they whispered, and the machine shuddered, lifting itself with a metallic groan. <words>233</words> Stickers of band logos and anarchist symbols blurred beneath gears—a collage of rebellion and naivety. <words>252</words>  

Outside, the horizon bled orange. <words>256</words> Ezra climbed onto the skateboard, their boots locking into rusted trucks. <words>268</words> "This one’s for the gods of stagnation," they said, voice placid yet ferocious, a river smoothing stones while carving canyons. <words>290</words> The workshop doors burst open. <words>294</words> Wind roared through brass pipes, igniting engines that screamed like living things. <words>311</words>  

They surged forward—not toward the train tracks, but upward, turbines shredding dawn’s silence. <words>329</words> The skateboard trembled, alive again, as Ezra arced above wheat fields gilded by sunrise. <words>346</words> For a heartbeat, they were weightless: no prophecies, no rusted years, just the raw thrust of defiance. <words>366</words>  

When the whistle faded, Ezra landed hard, knees bent to absorb the impact. <words>380</words> The automaton sputtered and died, its purpose spent. <words>390</words> They dismounted, tracing a sticker of a grinning skull—peeling now, just like the hands that once slapped it there. <words>411</words>  

In the workshop’s dim belly, Ezra began drafting blueprints for a new machine. <words>425</words> The train would come again tomorrow. <words>430</words> So would they. <words>433</words>
