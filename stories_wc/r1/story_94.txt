Dr. Elara Voss stood at the edge of the sky reflection pool, its surface rippling with constellations that hadn’t yet been named. <words>25</words>  
As the city’s foremost heartbreak counselor—and its most discreet femme fatale—she’d spent decades unraveling others’ sorrows while stitching her own into amber earrings, relics of lovers who’d dissolved like sugar in time’s tea. <words>58</words>  
Tonight, though, the pool’s liquid mirror hummed with a new urgency: cloud trails, faint as breath on glass, spiraled upward, marking paths through temporal folds. <words>84</words>  
Time travel had been invented, but not mastered; the universe now bled paradoxes, and Elara’s restlessly curious fingers itched to zip through its seams. <words>108</words>  
She adjusted her earrings, their amber cores glowing warmer as she stepped closer—desires, she’d learned, had gravity, bending trajectories like black holes bending light. <words>132</words>  
“Tracking cloud trails isn’t navigation,” her last client had warned, a physicist whose heart she’d dissected between sips of absinthe. <words>152</words>  
“It’s surrender.” <words>154</words>  
But surrender was a language Elara refused to speak. <words>162</words>  
The pool’s surface hardened under her boots as she activated the chrono-lace around her wrist, its filaments knitting a bridge across seconds. <words>186</words>  
One breath, then she plunged—not down, but *through*, the world unzipping into ribbons of sepia and static. <words>204</words>  
She emerged in a garden of frozen rain, droplets suspended like chandeliers, and there he stood: Kael, her first fracture, his smile still a knife wrapped in silk. <words>232</words>  
“You wear our ghosts well,” he said, nodding at her earrings. <words>244</words>  
Elara’s pulse quickened—cautious impulsiveness, the tone of her life—as she traced the cloud trail coiling around his wrist. <words>263</words>  
“Why this memory?” she demanded. <words>267</words>  
“You tell me.” His voice frayed at the edges, a photograph fading. <words>282</words>  
The gravity here was thicker, the pool’s reflection warping into a cage of gilded mirrors, each pane a trapped version of herself. <words>303</words>  
*Proclaim yourself free*, she thought, but the earrings burned, their amber holding screams she’d bottled. <words>320</words>  
Kael stepped closer. “You counsel others to let go, yet cling to what anchors them.” <words>336</words>  
“Anchors aren’t always chains,” she countered, but the garden trembled, reality peeling like wallpaper. <words>352</words>  
The cloud trail pulsed—a lifeline. <words>357</words>  
Elara tore an earring free, its glow erupting into a swarm of fireflies mapping an exit. <words>375</words>  
“Illusions demand audiences,” she hissed, “and I’m done performing.” <words>385</words>  
The amber shattered, releasing decades of swallowed goodbyes, and the cage splintered. <words>398</words>  
She zipped backward through the tempest, the pool’s surface now a sieve straining starlight. <words>413</words>  
Alone again, Elara laughed—a sound like broken clocks chiming—and dropped the remaining earring into the water. <words>430</words>  
Let the clouds track her now; she’d carve new trails. <words>441</words>  
Above, the sky blinked, its reflection no longer a prison, but a map. <words>454</words>  
Freedom, she realized, wasn’t escaping the maze, but dissolving its walls with the weight of unspoken wants. <words>474</words>  
The pool stilled. <words>476</words>  
She walked away, her shadow lighter, the air smelling of burnt sugar and possibility. <words>491</words>
