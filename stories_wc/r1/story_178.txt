The overburdened clerk shuffled paperwork under flickering fluorescents, their fingers brushing the vintage stamp collection tucked beneath tax forms—a relic from a grandfather who’d whispered, “They’re doorways.” <words>34</words>  
At the local trivia night, where she fled each Tuesday to quantize her life into digestible facts, a stranger slid beside her, reeking of brine and holding a question: “What thrives in an undersea greenhouse on a coral plateau?” <words>73</words>  
Her answer—“Glowing kelp that cures fevers”—earned a stamp she’d never seen: iridescent, perforated with symbols like coral skeletons. <words>95</words>  
That night, pressing it to her throbbing temple (the headaches had begun when her sister’s cough did), the room dissolved into a dissonant calm, seawater lapping silently at her ankles as the coral plateau materialized. <words>133</words>  
Breathing felt optional here, time stretching in the ephemeral pause between inhalation and exhalation—absolutely relative, she realized, as a bioluminescent figure gestured toward a glass-domed greenhouse where luminous plants pulsed like veins. <words>170</words>  
“The cure’s price is a memory,” the figure intoned, voice echoing as if through layers of ocean. <words>189</words>  
Her sister’s laugh? Her mother’s last words? She hesitated, but the clerk had quantified lives for years—reducing souls to numbers—and now she’d weave between worlds to unlearn it. <words>223</words>  
Inside the greenhouse, stalks of silver kelp hummed with antiviral nectar, but each step forward thrust her into fractured moments: childhood birthdays, hospital vigils, the trivia night stranger’s face resolving into her grandfather’s. <words>260</words>  
“Stamps bridge realms,” he’d said, but never how to return. <words>271</words>  
She snapped a kelp pod, its glow dimming as her lungs burned—time resuming, breath expelling—and awoke gasping on her office floor, the vial in her grip. <words>299</words>  
Her sister recovered, but the clerk’s hands now flickered when she sorted stamps, reality wavering like tide against shore. <words>320</words>  
In stolen moments, she quantized herself back, trading memories for more cures: a boy’s asthma, a neighbor’s sepsis, each trip eroding her anchor to the world of fluorescents and tax codes. <words>352</words>  
The undersea figure warned, “You’ll dissolve,” yet how could she stop when every vial meant a breath prolonged, a laugh preserved? <words>376</words>  
One evening, clutching a stamp inked with coral patterns, she let the office dissolve entirely. <words>393</words>  
The greenhouse welcomed her with its dissonant calm—silent storms beyond the glass, kelp swaying to a rhythm older than sickness. <words>415</words>  
Here, in the breath’s pause, she tends the plants, her form shimmering like refracted light, stitching cures into stamps mailed to the surface. <words>440</words>  
They say a clerk vanished, but in coastal towns, envelopes postmarked from no known country arrive bearing strange stamps and stranger hope. <words>464</words>  
Her sister keeps them in a lacquered box, whispering to visitors, “She’s weaving between worlds now,” as the vial collection grows. <words>488</words>  
And in the deep, the clerk—gardener of thresholds—measures time in heartbeats saved, her existence absolutely relative to the lives she mends. <words>515</words>
