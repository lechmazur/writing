<story>  
The uncertain druid adjusted her moss-patched cloak, fingers brushing the dented lunch tin at her hip—its surface scarred by decades of arcane reagents and peanut butter sandwiches. <words>34</words>  
She wandered through the neon-soaked alleys, past hologram repair shops flickering with fractured constellations, their broken light pooling like liquid on the pavement. <words>66</words>  
Her destination: a back-alley theater audition posted on the library’s decaying bulletin board, its ink smudged by the thumbs of desperate artists. <words>93</words>  
Obligation had tethered her here—not to the ancient oaks or moonlit groves, but to her uncle’s debt-ridden hologram shop, its repair logs stretching across library hours like a sentence. <words>131</words>  
Yet tonight, she carried seeds in the tin. <words>137</words>  
Not the “uniquely common” oak saplings her order revered, but stardust lilies—illegal hybrids that bloomed only in digital rain. <words>158</words>  
The theater’s door creaked open, revealing a director with a moth-eaten VR headset and a sigh sharper than broken glass. <words>181</words>  
“Your motivation?” he snapped, as a holographic rat scuttled over his boot. <words>195</words>  
She hesitated, then lied: “To forge beauty from anarchy.” <words>205</words>  
The director snorted, gesturing to the “stage”—a cracked parking lot shimmering with glitchy projections of 19th-century operas. <words>226</words>  
Her audition began with a whisper. <words>231</words>  
She scattered the lilies’ seeds into a puddle of leaking hologram coolant, her druidic chant merging with the shop’s faulty neon sign buzzing overhead. <words>259</words>  
Vines erupted, pixelated and chlorophyll-green, twining with the broken light to sculpt a cathedral of fractals and ivy. <words>280</words>  
The director’s cigarette froze mid-ash. <words>286</words>  
For three trembling minutes, the alley held its breath, anarchy and order waltzing in the lilies’ bioluminescent glow. <words>309</words>  
Then the vines unraveled, seeds retreating into the tin with a metallic sigh. <words>325</words>  
“Lethargic,” the director muttered, though his fingers trembled as he scrawled a callback slip. <words>343</words>  
“But… exciting.” <words>346</words>  
Back at the shop, dawn bled through barred windows as she repaired a hologram sparrow, its wings stuttering like a skipped heartbeat. <words>371</words>  
The callback slip weighed heavier than debt. <words>379</words>  
Obligation had always been her compass, yet now it spun wildly, torn between roots and light. <words>398</words>  
She opened the lunch tin, where stardust lilies hummed a forbidden lullaby, and wondered if chaos could be a kind of soil. <words>422</words>  
Outside, the library’s doors creaked open—another day of repairs, another audition at dusk. <words>441</words>  
The druid smiled, weary and bright, as the sparrow’s holograms bloomed into lilies. <words>458</words>
