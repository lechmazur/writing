The eternal college student adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp, its beam slicing through the subterranean gloom like a blade honed on centuries of futility. <words>28</words> Around them, the underground city of the mole people hummed with a mundanely glorious rhythm—chiseled quartz streets glowing faintly, children trading iridescent beetle shells, elders murmuring over geothermal vents. <words>62</words> It had been 317 years since the last star burned out, and surface dwellers had long since fled below, but the student remained tethered to academia, dissecting immortality’s paradoxes while their peers turned to dust. <words>97</words>  

The headlamp, salvaged from a collapsed mine where its previous owner had perished mid-shift, was both relic and burden. <words>121</words> Its weight pressed into the student’s brow, a reminder that gifts often arrive sharp-edged. <words>138</words> They’d received it from a mole archivist who’d bartered it for a vial of spider-milk wine, along with a cryptic warning: “Light reveals what digits obscure.” <words>166</words>  

That night, in a chamber walled with fossilized roots, the student opened the swapped travel journals. <words>185</words> The mole scribe’s pages were etched in glyphs resembling mycelium networks; theirs, a lattice of equations on delaying entropic decay. <words>207</words> To digitize them meant risking translation errors—the soul of a thing often clung to its medium—but preservation demanded sacrifice. <words>229</words> As they scanned the fragile pages into a handheld terminal, symbols flickered and mutated on the screen. <words>248</words> The mole’s account of tunneling through despair merged with the student’s notes on cellular regeneration, birthing a third narrative: instructions for rewriting one’s reality. <words>276</words>  

A knock interrupted. <words>277</words> A mole child stood holding a bioluminescent slug as a lantern, her voice gravelly from a lifetime of breathing mineral dust. <words>297</words> “You’re late for the memory ritual,” she said. <words>305</words> The student followed, clutching the terminal. <words>312</words> In the city’s heart, elders were reciting tales into a fissure that echoed with the voices of the dead. <words>332</words> The student’s fingers hovered over the keyboard—here was their chance to become more than a witness. <words>351</words>  

They input the merged code. <words>355</words> The terminal whirred, its screen blazing brighter than the headlamp ever could. <words>370</words> For a heartbeat, the cavern seemed to unravel, its stone veins replaced by shimmering threads of possibility. <words>389</words> The student grasped one, feeling it pulse like a living theorem. <words>402</words> Around them, the moles’ chants shifted, harmonizing with the terminal’s frequency. <words>418</words> Reality bent, not with the grandeur of collapsing stars, but with the quiet certainty of a root splitting rock. <words>440</words>  

When the light dimmed, the student stood alone, the terminal cold in their hands. <words>455</words> The fissure now emitted a low, approving hum. <words>465</words> They touched their headlamp, its brass warm as a heartbeat. <words>476</words> Mastery, they realized, wasn’t dominion—it was the courage to hold the lamp steady while others rebuilt the world. <words>497</words>
