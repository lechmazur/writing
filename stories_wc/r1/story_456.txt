<story>  
The morbid florist climbed the moss-slick stairs of the floating rock dojo, her skeletal bouquet clutched like an apology to the void. <words>25</words>  
Above, the guttering lantern spat its final amber defiance, casting jagged shadows over the training grounds where warriors once meditated on entropy. <words>46</words>  
She had come to oblige the summons inked on vellum—a plea from a dead philosopher who’d promised answers to cosmic cycles in exchange for a funeral wreath. <words>70</words>  
Her fingers, stained with the chlorophyll of requiem lilies, trembled as she lit the plain white candle wedged into a crevice, its flame a neutrally passionate pupil widening in the dark. <words>97</words>  

Beneath the dojo’s weathered floorboards, she found the writer’s trunk: iron-clad, exhaling the musk of mothballed epiphanies. <words>115</words>  
Inside, a backlog of typed pages whispered of supernovas birthing pollen and black holes swallowing seasons—theories once tempered by disbelief, now brittle as dried petals. <words>140</words>  
The florist’s breath hitched; here was the symbiosis she’d craved—death as a current, not an end, threading through stardust and stem alike. <words>163</words>  

A draft snuffed the candle. <words>167</words>  
In darkness, the pages rustled, their words seeping into her palms like ink into blotting paper. <words>183</words>  
She glimpsed the philosopher’s motive: to map the spiral where decay nourished genesis, a truth too vast for his timid tongue. <words>203</words>  
Boldly, she tore a page, folded it into a lotus, and set it afloat in the dojo’s rainwater cistern. <words>221</words>  
It bloomed phosphorescent, its light revealing glyphs carved into the rock’s underside—equations of resurrection, humming in time with her pulse. <words>243</words>  

“To temper belief,” she murmured, “is to let doubt root deeper than dogma.” <words>257</words>  
The lantern died. <words>259</words>  
Yet the candle’s wick, though cold, now glowed with absorbed starlight, a compass needle pointing skyward. <words>278</words>  
She pressed the trunk’s oldest page to her chest, its fibers thrumming with the philosopher’s unfinished aria—a hymn for endings that refused to conclude. <words>302</words>  

Dawn approached, diluting the night into grayscale. <words>309</words>  
The florist descended, her bouquet shed petal by petal onto the steps, each a cipher for some distant supernova’s grief. <words>330</words>  
In her pocket, the candle warmed, its wax softening into the shape of a key. <words>347</words>  
She would plant the philosopher’s words in the soil of her shop’s rarest orchids, let their roots dissect his theorems under loam. <words>369</words>  

Cosmic cycles, she realized, were neither cruel nor kind—merely florid, their patterns repeating in the spiral of a fiddlehead fern or the helix of a galaxy. <words>396</words>  
Her morbidity, once a shroud, now felt like fertile mulch. <words>409</words>  
As the floating rock shrank behind her, she smiled, neutrally passionate, her beliefs pruned but not uprooted. <words>428</words>  
The candle’s light, now nesting in her ribs, flickered once—a promise to keep deciphering the dark. <words>447</words>
