Dr. Elara Voss hummed a lullaby as she adjusted the IV drip, her fingers brushing the patient’s wrist—a habitual gesture to check pulses and pilfer loose thoughts. <words>27</words>  
The obsidian skyscraper housing St. Lysandra’s Hospital absorbed the moonlight, its glass walls reflecting the arrhythmic flicker of monitors in the cardiac ward. <words>50</words>  
Three hours before sunrise, the quiet shift thrummed with stolen moments: nurses’ whispers, the clink of morphine vials, and the rusted ice skates hidden beneath Bed 12. <words>77</words>  
Elara had found them weeks ago, their blades etched with glyphs resembling the scattered seeds of a dead language she’d studied in grad school—before the university revoked her grant for “ethically ambiguous methodologies.” <words>112</words>  
Now, she traced the symbols nightly, decoding their curves like a botanist reassembling petals. <words>127</words>  
The skates’ owner, a comatose fisherman named Ira, had washed ashore clutching them, his pockets filled with kelp and sunflower seeds. <words>147</words>  
“You’re not here to drown,” Elara murmured, slipping a seed into his IV bag. <words>162</words>  
A gamble: if the symbols were medicinal, the seeds might weaken whatever held his mind hostage. <words>178</words>  
Or kill him. <words>179</words>  
She preferred ambiguity. <words>181</words>  

At 4:17 a.m., Elara abandoned her rounds and descended to the beach below the skyscraper, the skates slung over her shoulder. <words>202</words>  
The tide had erased most footprints, but a lone set remained—deep, staggered impressions leading toward the pier. <words>223</words>  
She followed, her soles sinking into cold sand. <words>232</words>  
The glyphs on the skates glowed faintly, reacting to salt air or her own lucid confusion. <words>248</words>  
Halfway, she realized the footprints were hers. <words>256</words>  
Or versions of hers: older, desperate, as if she’d walked here in another life. <words>272</words>  
“Openly manipulative, aren’t we?” she chuckled, addressing the horizon. <words>283</words>  
The skates vibrated, their blades carving symbols into the sand that mirrored Ira’s tattoos. <words>299</words>  
Each mark pulsed once before dissolving, scattering seeds of light into the waves. <words>314</words>  

Back in the ward, Ira’s heartbeat quickened. <words>320</words>  
Elara strapped the skates to her shoes and glided across the linoleum, etching glyphs around his bed. <words>338</words>  
The seeds in his IV sprouted tendrils that climbed the monitors, their leaves displaying equations. <words>354</words>  
A nurse gasped; Elara winked. <words>359</words>  
“It’s phytolinguistics,” she lied. <words>364</words>  
As dawn bled through the windows, the symbols coalesced into a map of Ira’s memories: a storm, a ledger of ships, a lover who’d drowned wearing the skates. <words>390</words>  
The seeds had been a failsafe—a way to weaken the sea’s claim on the lost. <words>406</words>  
Elara pressed a hand to Ira’s chest, the glyphs migrating onto her skin. <words>420</words>  
His eyes opened, pupils flecked with gold. <words>428</words>  
“You meddled,” he rasped. <words>431</words>  
“Pleasantly,” she corrected, pocketing a seed. <words>439</words>  
Outside, the first gull cried, and the skyscraper’s shadow retreated like a tide. <words>454</words>
