The docile bruiser knelt in the greenhouse labyrinth, his massive hands trembling as he pieced together the shredded treasure map. <words>10</words> The man-eating plants hissed, their tendrils curling toward his boots, but he remained disturbingly calm, as if the danger were a distant hum. <words>20</words> His motivation was simple: to mold a myth from the mud of reality, to prove that the conductor’s baton rumored to raise the dead was more than a folktale. <words>32</words> The map, hidden under floorboards, had been written in a language he couldn’t read, its symbols a jumble of ink and desperation. <words>44</words> He traced the fragments with calloused fingers, each line a whisper of a forgotten path. <words>52</words> Amid drum solos echoing from the distant concert hall, he pressed forward, the rhythm of the music syncing with the thump of his pulse. <words>64</words> The greenhouse’s air was thick with the scent of decay and blooming poison, a paradox that mirrored his own existence—gentle giant, yet a force of quiet destruction. <words>77</words> A Venus flytrap snapped at his ankle, but he stepped over it, his calm unshaken, as if the plants were mere shadows. <words>89</words> The baton, he believed, would be the key. <words>94</words> Its legend spoke of power, but he sought something else: a story to outlive the mud. <words>104</words> The map’s final piece revealed a chamber beneath the orchid vines, its walls etched with glyphs that pulsed faintly, as though alive. <words>117</words> He reached for the baton, its wood smooth and cold, but the moment his fingers closed around it, the plants erupted. <words>129</words> A scream tore through the labyrinth, not his, but the baton’s. <words>136</words> The language barrier had been a lie; the plants spoke in a dialect of rustling leaves and thorns, warning him of the truth. <words>148</words> The baton didn’t raise the dead—it consumed the living, feeding on their stories to fuel its own. <words>158</words> He dropped it, the chamber trembling as the vines coiled tighter, their whispers now a chorus of betrayal. <words>168</words> The drum solos had stopped. <words>172</words> In the silence, he realized the twist: the myth was never about power. <words>180</words> It was about the cost of turning truth into legend, of letting the dead speak through the living. <words>190</words> The baton, now a relic of his failure, lay at his feet, its magic a hollow echo. <words>200</words> He turned, the labyrinth’s maze of thorns and blooms no longer a challenge but a mirror. <words>210</words> The greenhouse had not tested him; it had revealed him. <words>218</words> His calm, once a shield, now felt like a wound. <words>225</words> The plants, sensing his surrender, parted, their leaves trembling with a brash tenderness. <words>235</words> He walked out, the map in his pocket, its fragments now a testament to what he’d learned: some myths are better left buried. <words>247</words> The drum solos resumed, louder this time, as if the world itself had been waiting for his return. <words>257</words> He didn’t look back. <words>260</words> The baton’s song had ended, and the greenhouse, ever hungry, would find another tale to devour. <words>270</words>
