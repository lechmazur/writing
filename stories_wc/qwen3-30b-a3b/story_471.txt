Kael stepped into the mist, his boots crunching on rusted carnival tracks, the abandoned funfair’s skeletal rides clawing at the fog. <words>10</words>  
The vintage camera lens, its glass fogged with decades of dust, hung around his neck like a relic of a forgotten pact. <words>17</words>  
He’d promised his sister, Lira, to map every ghost town before the world swallowed them whole. <words>24</words>  
Now, her voice echoed in the silence, a ghost he couldn’t outrun. <words>29</words>  
The forest thinned, revealing a circle of street musicians huddled near a broken carousel. <words>35</words>  
Their music was a language he’d never learned, but he sat anyway, drawn by the way their fingers danced like they’d never known fear. <words>43</words>  
“Wise choices,” the violinist said, not looking up, “are the only things that outlive us.” <words>50</words>  
Kael scoffed, but the words clung to him, sharp as the lens’s edge. <words>55</words>  
He’d always been reckless, a hunter who chased shadows, but this time, the promise felt heavier than the camera. <words>63</words>  
The musicians spoke of a town swallowed by the forest, its streets paved with memories. <words>69</words>  
Kael’s pulse quickened. That was Lira’s town, the one she’d vanished into. <words>75</words>  
He reached for the lens, its weight a reminder of her last words: “Don’t let the forest take you.” <words>82</words>  
The musicians watched as he adjusted the focus, the glass catching the mist like a dying star. <words>89</words>  
“Atomize the past,” the drummer said, “or it’ll atomize you.” <words>95</words>  
Kael laughed, but the sound died in his throat. He’d spent years chasing ghosts, never realizing he was the one being chased. <words>103</words>  
The funfair groaned, its rides creaking as if the forest itself were breathing. <words>109</words>  
He stepped deeper, the lens trembling in his grip, its glass fracturing with every heartbeat. <words>115</words>  
The musicians’ song swelled, a dirge for the lost, and Kael felt the weight of his choices—reckless, meticulous, and finally, alive. <words>123</words>  
He snapped a photo, the lens shattering into a thousand shards, each reflecting a different version of the town. <words>131</words>  
Lira’s face flickered in the glass, not as a ghost, but as a choice he’d never made. <words>138</words>  
The forest stilled, the mist parting to reveal a path, not of ruins, but of possibilities. <words>145</words>  
Kael turned, the camera’s remnants in his hand, and walked forward, no longer a hunter, but a mapmaker of what could be. <words>153</words>  
The musicians’ song faded, but their wisdom remained, etched into the air like a promise kept. <words>160</words>  
He’d learned to choose not just for the past, but for the future, a balance of recklessness and care. <words>168</words>  
The forest whispered, and Kael listened, no longer afraid of the unknown. <words>174</words>  
The lens was gone, but its lesson endured: some things, once atomized, become something new. <words>181</words>  
He smiled, the mist thickening around him, a veil between what was and what would be. <words>188</words>  
The funfair’s shadows shifted, and Kael stepped into the light, a hunter no more, but a man who’d finally chosen wisely. <words>196</words>
