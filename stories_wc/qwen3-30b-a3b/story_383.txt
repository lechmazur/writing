<story>  
The burnt-out general sat in the dark matter diner, his fingers tracing the rim of a coffee cup that had long since gone cold. <words>10</words>  
The dried seaweed on his plate curled like a forgotten promise, its brittle edges catching the flickering neon light. <words>17</words>  
He had come here between rides, a pause in the chaos of command, but the silence of the diner hummed with a different kind of tension. <words>26</words>  
A waitress with a name tag that read “Mira” slid a black-and-white photograph across the table, its edges frayed. <words>34</words>  
“Arcs,” she said, her voice a low hum. “They’re not just lines. They’re the shape of what we can’t say.” <words>43</words>  
The general stared at the photo—a blurred figure standing at the edge of a cliff, arms outstretched, the sky a swirl of void and light. <words>52</words>  
He had seen that cliff before, in dreams where the ground crumbled beneath his boots, and the weight of command pressed like a leaden tide. <words>62</words>  
“Rationally absurd,” he muttered, more to himself than to Mira, who only smiled. <words>69</words>  
The diner’s walls were lined with similar photos, each one a puzzle of shadows and light, as if the universe had been folded into frames. <words>78</words>  
He wondered if the other patrons—ghosts in mismatched coats, a child with a kaleidoscope—were also trying to renew something lost. <words>88</words>  
Shared anxieties, he realized, were the only currency here, and the dark matter diner was a place where fear was both tax and treasure. <words>98</words>  
The general reached for the dried seaweed, its texture like the memory of a storm, and pressed it to the photo’s edge. <words>107</words>  
A faint arc appeared, connecting the cliff to the figure, as if the photo had been waiting for the right touch to reveal its secret. <words>116</words>  
“Dethrone fear from the throne of reason,” he whispered, the phrase tasting like a vow. <words>124</words>  
Mira nodded, her eyes reflecting the diner’s dim glow. “Wisdom’s a mischievous thing. It doesn’t ask permission.” <words>133</words>  
He thought of the battles he’d lost, the lives he’d failed, and the way fear had always been a silent general in his mind. <words>143</words>  
But here, in the dark matter diner, the rules were different. The photos didn’t lie; they only asked to be seen. <words>152</words>  
The general stood, the seaweed still in his hand, and walked toward the exit, the diner’s door creaking like a sigh. <words>161</words>  
Between rides, he had found a way to renew—not by conquering fear, but by letting it breathe. <words>170</words>  
The photo in his pocket now held a new arc, a bridge between the cliff and the sky, and the general felt something shift, light and fragile as seaweed. <words>181</words>  
He didn’t know if the world would change, but for the first time in years, he wasn’t afraid to ask. <words>190</words>  
The dark matter diner faded behind him, its neon glow a reminder that even in the void, there were ways to be seen. <words>199</words>  
The general smiled, a small, mischievous thing, and stepped into the unknown, the dried seaweed cradled like a secret. <words>209</words>
