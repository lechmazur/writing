<story>  
The ambivalent prophet wandered the lunar mining colony’s dim corridors, their boots crunching on dust that had not seen sunlight in decades. <words>1</words> Between heartbeats, they clutched a cracked collection of marbles, each one a shard of forgotten memory. <words>2</words> The marbles had been found in a rummage sale box, its edges jagged with the promise of a jigsaw puzzle long abandoned. <words>3</words> To defragment the cosmos, they believed, one must first dismantle the fragments. <words>4</words> The final oath, whispered to no one, was to scramble the cosmic scoreboard before the next cycle of fate sealed their destiny. <words>5</words>  

The prophet’s eyes, hollow yet sharp, reflected the colony’s flickering lights. <words>6</words> They were neither savior nor fool, but a man who had once sworn to mend the universe and now doubted the worth of mending. <words>7</words> The marbles, cracked but not broken, mirrored their own fractured resolve. <words>8</words> “Happily sad,” they muttered, a phrase that tasted like ash and honey. <words>9</words> The colony’s overseers called them a relic, a prophet who had lost their voice. <words>10</words>  

In the storage bay, the prophet sorted the puzzle edges, their fingers trembling. <words>11</words> Each piece was a cipher, a fragment of a map to a truth they feared to grasp. <words>12</words> The marbles, when placed beside the puzzle, seemed to hum—a sound only they could hear. <words>13</words> “Bashful arrogance,” they sighed, a grin tugging at their lips. <words>14</words> The universe had no need for prophets, yet here they were, stitching together a lie that might save them all. <words>15</words>  

The final oath was not a promise but a provocation. <words>16</words> To scramble the scoreboard meant to erase the ledger of deeds and sins, to let chaos reign where order had failed. <words>17</words> The prophet’s hands moved with purpose, aligning the puzzle edges and marbles into a pattern that defied logic. <words>18</words> Between heartbeats, the colony’s systems flickered, as if the stars themselves held their breath. <words>19</words>  

When the puzzle clicked into place, the marbles shattered, their cracks widening into a constellation. <words>20</words> The prophet fell to their knees, laughing and weeping. <words>21</words> “Happily sad,” they repeated, the words a balm and a wound. <words>22</words> The cosmic scoreboard, once a rigid grid, now pulsed with possibility. <words>23</words> The prophet, ambivalent and unrepentant, rose to face the void. <words>24</words>  

The colony’s lights dimmed, and the prophet’s shadow stretched long, a testament to the fragile hope they had dared to forge. <words>25</words> In the silence between heartbeats, they whispered the final oath again, a prayer and a rebellion. <words>26</words> The marbles, the puzzle, the scoreboard—all were part of a story that would never be told, but lived. <words>27</words>  

The prophet’s bashful arrogance lingered, a quiet defiance against the void. <words>28</words> They had not saved the universe, but they had scrambled its score, and in that, found a kind of peace. <words>29</words> Between heartbeats, the colony breathed, and the prophet, for the first time, felt whole. <words>30</words>
