Jax traced the splintered edge of the plain wooden crate slat, its rough grain a reminder of the warehouse where he’d once stolen crates for a gang. <words>15</words>  
The static electricity garden hummed around him, a field of charged plants that crackled faintly in the dusk. <words>21</words>  
He’d come here to outlast the weight of his past, to let the garden’s hum drown out the echoes of his old life. <words>27</words>  
Rationally subjective, he told himself—his choices now were not dictated by rage but by a fragile, stubborn hope. <words>35</words>  
Each morning, he staged accidental meetings in museums, pretending to admire art while listening to strangers’ stories. <words>42</words>  
The crate slat, a relic from his thug days, was his talisman, a symbol of the life he’d vowed to leave behind. <words>49</words>  
In the second a new silhouette appears on the horizon, he froze, heart pounding. <words>55</words>  
The figure was a woman, her posture rigid, her gaze fixed on the garden’s flickering lights. <words>61</words>  
Jax’s breath caught—she looked like the sister of the man he’d once beaten, a memory he’d buried deep. <words>68</words>  
He stepped forward, the crate slat trembling in his grip, its splinters digging into his palm. <words>75</words>  
“Sorry,” he muttered, not sure if it was for the past or the present. <words>80</words>  
The woman turned, her eyes narrowing. “You’re the one who left the slat in the museum.” <words>87</words>  
Jax’s throat tightened. “I didn’t mean to—” <words>91</words>  
“Mean to what?” she interrupted, her voice sharp. “Hurt people? Lie to yourself?” <words>98</words>  
He flinched, the static electricity garden surging in response to her anger. <words>104</words>  
“I’m trying to learn resilience,” he said, the word tasting bitter on his tongue. <words>111</words>  
The woman studied him, her expression softening. “Resilience isn’t about forgetting. It’s about choosing.” <words>118</words>  
Jax looked down at the crate slat, its splinters now a part of him. <words>124</words>  
He thought of the gang, the violence, the silence he’d used to hide. <words>130</words>  
“Can you teach me?” he asked, the question a thread of light in the dark. <words>136</words>  
The woman nodded, and in that moment, the garden’s hum seemed to shift, as if the earth itself had exhaled. <words>144</words>  
Jax knew the road ahead would be long, but for the first time, he wasn’t running from his past. <words>151</words>  
He was walking toward something new, the crate slat in his hand and the silhouette of a future he dared to imagine. <words>159</words>  
The static electricity garden crackled, a silent witness to his quiet rebellion. <words>165</words>  
In the second a new silhouette appears on the horizon, he smiled, the weight of his past no longer a chain but a compass. <words>173</words>
