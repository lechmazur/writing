<story>  
The soul-broker real estate agent floated above the tea platform, a relic of a bygone era where commerce and mysticism intertwined. <words>20</words>  
His name was Elias, and his inventory was not of homes but of forgotten souls, each sealed in dusty wine bottles that clinked like ancient secrets. <words>34</words>  
The floating tea platform, suspended by unseen currents, was his office, its surface etched with the faint glow of recycled glass. <words>48</words>  
Elias’s attribute was weirdly static—his movements precise, his voice a monotone hum that unsettled clients but drew them in. <words>62</words>  
To persuade, he relied on a method few understood: reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles, their ink smudged by time and the hands of those who’d tried before him. <words>78</words>  
The core concept of his craft was the art of persuasion, a dance of words and whispers that could unravel a soul’s resistance. <words>91</words>  
Each bottle held a story, a forgotten song, and Elias’s motivation was to learn them all, though he never admitted it aloud. <words>105</words>  
He choreographed his sales pitch with the grace of a conductor, his fingers tracing the bottle’s surface as if conducting an orchestra of echoes. <words>119</words>  
The timeframe of his work stretched throughout recycling, a cycle of decay and rebirth that mirrored the souls he brokered. <words>133</words>  
A client once asked why he preferred the dusty bottles. Elias replied, “They remember what others forget,” his voice a blend of grandiose modesty. <words>148</words>  
The tea platform’s air was thick with the scent of aged leaves and the faint metallic tang of bottled memories. <words>161</words>  
Elias’s latest acquisition was a wine bottle with a label that read “1923” in reverse, its script curling like a serpent. <words>175</words>  
He held it to the light, the liquid inside swirling with the ghost of a melody he’d never heard but somehow knew. <words>189</words>  
The client, a woman with a hollow gaze, leaned in as Elias began his ritual, his fingers brushing the glass in a silent choreography. <words>203</words>  
“Listen,” he said, and the bottle hummed, its song a lament of lost love and unspoken regrets. <words>216</words>  
The woman wept, her soul trembling as the melody unraveled her defenses. Elias, ever static, offered a single nod. <words>230</words>  
In the end, the sale was sealed not with contracts but with a shared silence, the tea platform’s currents carrying the weight of their exchange. <words>244</words>  
Elias returned to his desk, the bottle now empty, its song added to his collection. <words>256</words>  
He wondered if the next client would bring a bottle with a label that read “never” in reverse, a challenge he’d yet to face. <words>270</words>  
The floating tea platform drifted on, its recycled glass reflecting the endless cycle of souls and stories. <words>284</words>  
Elias, the soul-broker, remained a figure of quiet grandeur, his art of persuasion as timeless as the bottles he sold. <words>298</words>  
And somewhere, a forgotten song waited to be heard, its notes lingering in the dust of a wine bottle. <words>312</words>
