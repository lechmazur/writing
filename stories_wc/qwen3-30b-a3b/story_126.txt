The shipwrecked merchant stood alone on the space station observation deck, his breath fogging the glass as he stared at the void. <words>1</words> The last tree had fallen days ago, its absence a silent scream in the vacuum of the cosmos. <words>6</words> He clutched a rustic butter churn, its wooden grooves worn smooth by time, an honestly strange relic from a world that no longer existed. <words>14</words> The station, a ghost of its former self, hummed with static, its corridors echoing with the ghosts of forgotten travelers. <words>21</words> He had no memory of how he’d arrived here, only that the flaking edges of a travel poster in the derelict station’s core had whispered a path to ascend. <words>31</words> The poster, a faded map of Earth’s lost forests, had peeled like skin, revealing a hidden hatch beneath its layers. <words>38</words> He had followed the trail, driven by a motivation he could not name, only that it burned like a rebellious spark in his chest. <words>47</words> The churn, he realized, was not a tool but a key—a device to unlock the station’s final secret. <words>54</words> Its handle, carved with symbols he did not understand, pulsed faintly as he pressed it against the hatch’s rusted frame. <words>62</words> A low hum filled the air, and the hatch groaned open, revealing a spiral staircase spiraling into darkness. <words>69</words> He descended, the air growing colder, the walls narrowing until the station’s artificial lights faded into black. <words>76</words> At the bottom, a chamber pulsed with bioluminescent algae, its glow casting shadows that danced like rebellious sparks. <words>84</words> The merchant’s breath caught—he had found the heart of the illusion, a sanctuary for the last remnants of Earth’s flora. <words>92</words> But the trees were dead, their roots entangled in the station’s machinery, their purpose twisted into a grand deception. <words>100</words> He raised the churn, its grooves aligning with the chamber’s machinery, and with a single, decisive motion, he shattered the illusion. <words>109</words> The station trembled, its systems flickering as the algae dimmed, revealing the truth: the space station was a prison, a lie designed to keep humanity in stasis. <words>119</words> The merchant stood at the edge of the void, his aloof passion ignited by the weight of his discovery. <words>126</words> He had no home, no past, only the churn and the knowledge that the grand illusion had been broken. <words>134</words> As the station’s lights died, he ascended the staircase once more, the flaking poster’s edges now a map to a new beginning. <words>143</words> The void was no longer empty—it was a canvas, and he, a rebel with a churn and a spark, would paint it with truth. <words>151</words> The last tree had fallen, but the merchant’s rebellion had just begun. <words>157</words>
