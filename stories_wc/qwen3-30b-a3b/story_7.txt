Elara’s fingers brushed the twisted carnival cane, its brass surface etched with constellations that pulsed faintly. <words>1</words> The nectar collection facility hummed around her, a labyrinth of glass tubes and humming machinery, but she only saw the dolls—rows of them, their porcelain faces frozen in expectantly resigned expressions. <words>15</words> Each had been crafted to hold a fragment of the chorus of healing, a melody that once mended broken things. <words>27</words> Now, the chorus was silent, its notes scattered like dust in the facility’s sterile air. <words>36</words>  

She had spent decades collecting them, her obsession born from a single whispered promise: to uphold the sacred boundaries between worlds. <words>47</words> The cane, a relic from a forgotten carnival, was her guide, its tip glowing as it pointed toward the star paths that only she could see. <words>58</words> The facility’s overseers called her madness, but Elara knew the truth—the nectar they harvested was not just a substance, but a bridge. <words>69</words>  

Before the first prayer was whispered by a mortal, the veil would thin. <words>77</words> That was the timeframe, the moment when the sacred and the profane would collide. <words>84</words> Elara’s dolls, each a vessel for a lost note of the chorus, would shatter if she failed. <words>92</words> She had to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, to reweave the melody before the world unraveled. <words>102</words>  

The cane’s glow intensified, its path winding through the facility’s underbelly. <words>110</words> Elara moved with purpose, her boots echoing against the metal floors, the dolls’ hollow eyes following her. <words>118</words> The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of nectar and something older—something like regret. <words>126</words> She had once been a mortal, too, before the chorus chose her. <words>133</words> Now, she was a keeper of fragments, a bridge between what was and what could be. <words>141</words>  

At the heart of the facility, a chamber pulsed with light. <words>147</words> The star paths converged here, a spiral of constellations that defied logic. <words>154</words> Elara placed the cane at the center, its tip touching the floor. <words>160</words> The dolls trembled, their voices merging into a single, fractured harmony. <words>167</words> She closed her eyes, feeling the weight of the chorus pressing against her ribs. <words>174</words>  

The first prayer was a whisper, a tremor in the air. <words>181</words> Elara’s hands shook as she followed the star paths, each step a defiance of the rules that had bound her. <words>189</words> The facility groaned, its machinery faltering, as the veil thinned. <words>196</words> She could feel the sacred boundaries fraying, the chorus of healing stirring in the silence. <words>204</words>  

When the final note was sung, the dolls dissolved into light, their fragments weaving into the star paths. <words>214</words> Elara stood alone, the cane now a hollow shell. <words>220</words> The facility was quiet, the nectar still, as if waiting. <words>226</words> She had upheld the chorus, but at what cost? <words>232</words> The expectantly resigned look in her eyes deepened, a bittersweet acceptance of the unknown. <words>241</words>  

The first prayer had been whispered, and the world had changed. <words>248</words> Elara turned, her steps light, as the star paths led her somewhere new. <words>255</words> The ethereal grit of her journey remained, a testament to the price of crossing boundaries. <words>264</words>
