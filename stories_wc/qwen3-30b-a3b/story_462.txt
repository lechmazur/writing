<story>  
The town-weary traveler stumbled into the abandoned carnival house of mirrors, its skeletal frame creaking like a sigh in the coastal wind. <words>18</words>  
The air smelled of salt and rust, and the only sound was the rhythmic tapping of a metal sign, its letters bent by time. <words>17</words>  
He had wandered for weeks, chasing the ghost of a place that might finally quiet the noise in his mind. <words>14</words>  
Inside, the mirrors fractured his reflection into a thousand shards, each one a different version of himself—lost, hopeful, broken. <words>15</words>  
A stained glass panel, cracked and faded, hung in the center of the room, its colors bleeding into the shadows. <words>14</words>  
He reached out, fingers brushing the glass, and felt a flicker of something ancient, like a memory refusing to die. <words>14</words>  
The cradle of sparks, he thought, though he didn’t know why. <words>7</words>  
The wind howled through the broken roof, and the metal sign’s tapping grew faster, more insistent, as if it were trying to speak. <words>15</words>  
He leaned closer, the sound merging with the hum of his own pulse, until the world blurred into a single, vibrating note. <words>14</words>  
Then, a spark—small, deliberate, but impossible—leapt from the stained glass panel, landing on his palm. <words>14</words>  
It didn’t burn. It didn’t fade. It pulsed, warm and alive, like a heartbeat. <words>11</words>  
The traveler’s breath caught. This was not a trick of the light, nor a trick of his mind. <words>12</words>  
The cradle of sparks, he realized, was not a thing but a moment—a fragile, intentional accident. <words>13</words>  
He had come here to escape the confines of his mind, but now the mind was the only thing that mattered. <words>14</words>  
The mirrors around him began to shift, their surfaces rippling like water, revealing not reflections but scenes: a child laughing, a lover’s hand held, a sunrise over a forgotten shore. <words>18</words>  
The traveler stepped back, dizzy, as the sparks multiplied, dancing between the glass and the wind. <words>13</words>  
Fertilize, he thought, the word rising unbidden. <words>6</words>  
The carnival, the wind, the glass—it was all a seed, waiting to be planted. <words>11</words>  
He closed his eyes, letting the sound of the tapping and the hum of the sparks fill him, until the noise in his mind began to settle. <words>15</words>  
In the hush before someone finally says, “I love you,” he felt something shift—not in the world, but in himself. <words>16</words>  
The cradle of sparks had not been a destination, but a mirror, reflecting the truth he had been too afraid to face. <words>15</words>  
He opened his eyes, and the mirrors no longer fractured him. They held him, gently, like a promise. <words>13</words>  
The wind died, the sign stilled, and the sparks faded into the air, leaving only the weight of silence. <words>13</words>  
He turned, the abandoned carnival behind him, and walked into the dawn, the sound of his own breath steady, unbroken. <words>14</words>  
The tone of hammered repose lingered, a quiet storm in his chest, as if the world had finally stopped demanding answers. <words>13</words>  
He had not escaped his mind. He had learned to listen to it. <words>10</words>
