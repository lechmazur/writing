The forgotten library inside the treehouse had no windows, only the faint glow of bioluminescent moss clinging to the walls. Lira, a convicted dream thief, traced her fingers over the flimsy photo album, its pages brittle with the weight of forgotten memories. <words>30</words>  
Her mathematically challenged mind struggled to calculate the odds of finding a dream that could coax thunder from empty skies, but the album’s fragments—faces, places, half-remembered laughter—pulled her deeper. <words>45</words>  
The treehouse had been built by the last human, a reclusive inventor who’d vanished after the world’s final birth. Lira had stumbled upon it years ago, drawn by the myth of a shared love for a sport that no longer existed. <words>60</words>  
She plunged into the album’s contents, each photo a shard of a self she’d never fully assembled. A boy in a tattered jersey, a stadium bathed in twilight, a ball soaring through a sky that once roared with storms. <words>75</words>  
The core concept of the fragmented self gnawed at her: how could she be a thief of dreams if her own were scattered like dust? The treehouse’s silence hummed with the answer, a quiet mania that urged her to stitch the pieces together. <words>90</words>  
She remembered the sport—the name eluded her, but the rhythm of the game had once bound her to someone, a shadow in the crowd who’d taught her to see patterns in chaos. <words>105</words>  
The photo album’s final page held a single, blurred image: a storm, a boy, and a hand reaching out. Lira’s pulse quickened. If she could reclaim that dream, maybe the skies would answer. <words>120</words>  
She climbed the creaking ladder to the treehouse’s highest branch, the album clutched to her chest. The air was thick with the scent of rain that never came, and the weight of her fractured self pressed against her ribs. <words>135</words>  
With a breath, she plunged—downward, into the void, the album’s pages fluttering like wings. The world blurred, and for a moment, she was the boy in the photo, the storm in his eyes, the thunder in his voice. <words>150</words>  
When she landed, the treehouse was gone. In its place, a field stretched beneath a sky alive with lightning. The sport’s name returned to her: baseball. The man who’d taught her was there, grinning, a ball in his hand. <words>165</words>  
“You always were bad at math,” he said, tossing the ball. Lira caught it, her fragmented self now a single, resonant chord. The thunder roared, and she laughed, a sound that echoed through the empty world. <words>180</words>
