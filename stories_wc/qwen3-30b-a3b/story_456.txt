Elara, the morbid florist, arranged lilies in a coffin-shaped vase, her fingers tracing the edges of a plain white candle. <words>20</words>  
The floating rock dojo, suspended above a stormy sea, hummed with the weight of unspoken truths. <words>24</words>  
She had always been neutrally passionate about her craft, neither mourning nor celebrating death, but tending to it with quiet precision. <words>34</words>  
Today, she was to oblige a request from the dojo’s master, who had left a trunk of typed pages in the corner of the training hall. <words>44</words>  
The pages spoke of cosmic cycles, of how life and death were not ends but echoes in an eternal rhythm. <words>50</words>  
Elara’s tempered beliefs wavered as she read, her hands trembling around the candle’s unassuming form. <words>56</words>  
The dojo’s lantern flickered, its last gasp of light casting shadows that danced like ghosts on the stone walls. <words>64</words>  
She had come to understand these cycles, to see the world as a tapestry of balance, but the pages demanded more than theory. <words>74</words>  
The candle, she realized, was a key—a tool to bridge the gap between the seen and the unseen. <words>80</words>  
In the last flicker of the lantern, she lit the candle, its flame steady and pale, as if it had been waiting. <words>88</words>  
The pages had warned of a ritual, a way to align with the cycles by surrendering to the unknown. <words>94</words>  
Elara’s heart pounded, but her resolve was tempered, her passion neutral, as she followed the instructions. <words>104</words>  
The dojo trembled, the rocks shifting as if the earth itself acknowledged her act. <words>110</words>  
A whisper filled the air, not of wind or water, but of something older, something vast. <words>116</words>  
She felt the weight of the cosmos press against her, a reminder of her smallness and her purpose. <words>124</words>  
The candle’s flame grew, its light no longer pale but golden, illuminating the pages she had once dismissed. <words>134</words>  
In that moment, Elara understood: the cycles were not to be mastered, but to be honored, like the flowers she arranged. <words>144</words>  
Her hands, once steady, now shook with the enormity of it, but her spirit remained bold, if timid. <words>152</words>  
The lantern died, and the dojo was plunged into darkness, but the candle’s glow remained, a beacon of balance. <words>162</words>  
She had oblige, not out of fear, but because the pages had spoken to her, and the cosmos had answered. <words>170</words>  
The floating rocks steadied, the storm below calmed, and Elara, the morbid florist, felt the weight of the universe in her chest. <words>180</words>  
Her tempered beliefs, once fragile, now stood firm, a bridge between the mortal and the infinite. <words>188</words>  
The candle burned on, a silent testament to the cycles she had come to understand. <words>194</words>  
And in the stillness, Elara smiled, her heart neither heavy nor light, but perfectly balanced. <words>202</words>
