<story>  
The arrogant swordsman, Kaito, stood at the edge of the calligraphy master’s courtyard, his shadow stretching like a blade across the mossy stones. <words>20</words>  
The air smelled of ink and rain, a scent that clung to the faded tapestry fragment he’d found tucked beneath a forgotten scroll. <words>24</words>  
Its frayed threads depicted a wedding scene, the traditional song sung at every family wedding echoing in his mind like a half-remembered vow. <words>30</words>  
Kaito’s doubtfully confident smirk faltered as he traced the tapestry’s edge, the weight of shackled potential pressing against his ribs. <words>34</words>  
He’d come to demand the calligraphy master’s blessing to authorize a duel, but the courtyard’s silence had swallowed his pride. <words>38</words>  
The master, a wizened man with ink-stained fingers, emerged from the shadows, his gaze lingering on the tapestry. <words>42</words>  
“This fragment,” the master murmured, “was woven by my grandmother, who believed a song could mend what a sword could not.” <words>46</words>  
Kaito scoffed, but the words lodged in his throat, a thorn of unspoken doubt. <words>49</words>  
Between breaths, the courtyard seemed to hold its own, the tapestry’s faded hues bleeding into the twilight. <words>53</words>  
The master hummed the wedding song, a melody so fragile it seemed to shatter the air. <words>57</words>  
Kaito’s hand drifted to his sword hilt, but the sound stopped him—its harsh tenderness a mirror to his own fractured resolve. <words>63</words>  
He’d always believed his strength was his only truth, but the tapestry’s story whispered of a different kind of power. <words>68</words>  
“Why show me this?” Kaito asked, his voice hoarse. <words>70</words>  
The master’s eyes, deep as calligraphy ink, met his. “To deliver a spark where all lights have gone out.” <words>74</words>  
The words struck Kaito like a blade, not to wound, but to carve open the shell of his arrogance. <words>78</words>  
He thought of the battles he’d fought, the lives he’d claimed, and the hollow ache that followed. <words>82</words>  
The tapestry’s fragment, a relic of love and loss, became a tether to something he’d long forgotten: the need to create, not destroy. <words>88</words>  
“Authorize the duel,” the master said, “but not with a sword. With a song.” <words>92</words>  
Kaito’s laugh was bitter, but the master’s silence was a challenge he couldn’t ignore. <words>96</words>  
He closed his eyes, the wedding song rising in his chest, its notes trembling like a fragile flame. <words>100</words>  
When he opened them, the courtyard was no longer a place of defiance, but of possibility. <words>104</words>  
The tapestry’s fragment, once a relic of the past, now pulsed with the promise of a future he’d never dared to imagine. <words>109</words>  
Kaito’s hand fell from his sword, and for the first time, he felt the weight of his own potential—not as a chain, but as a compass. <words>115</words>  
The song lingered, a spark that refused to die, and in its glow, the arrogant swordsman found a new truth: to lead, he must first listen. <words>121</words>
