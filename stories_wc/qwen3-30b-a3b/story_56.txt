<story>  
Elias, the energetically lethargic swindler, wandered through the reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper, his fingers brushing the blank price tag in his coat pocket. <words>20</words>  
At the instant a frozen computer finally restarted, its flickering screen cast shadows over the rusted remains of the building’s skeleton. <words>21</words>  
He had come to sell the price tag, a relic from a world that no longer existed, but the orchard’s roots had already claimed the soil. <words>22</words>  
A dropped book—his own, forgotten in the chaos—landed near a figure crouched by the computer, their hands trembling as they tried to reboot it. <words>23</words>  
The swindler’s eyes narrowed, but the figure’s voice was gentle, almost apologetic, as they asked, “Do you know how to fix this?” <words>24</words>  
Elias shrugged, his lethargy masking the thrill of a new mark. “Depends. What’s the truth you’re trying to bare?” <words>25</words>  
The figure froze, their face half-hidden by the computer’s glow. “You… you know?” <words>26</words>  
He tapped the blank price tag. “This isn’t just a tag. It’s a key. To the truth no one dares to handle.” <words>27</words>  
The orchard hummed, as if the trees themselves had been listening. Elias’s invisible allies—spirits of the fallen skyscraper—whispered in the wind. <words>28</words>  
The figure, a woman named Mira, reached out, her fingers brushing the tag. “I’ve seen the data. The city’s corruption… it’s all here.” <words>29</words>  
Elias’s heart quickened. “Then why let the computer die?” <words>30</words>  
Mira’s gaze dropped. “I didn’t know how to magnetize it. I thought the truth would be too heavy.” <words>31</words>  
He laughed, a dry, raspy sound. “Truth’s always heavy. But it’s the only thing that can lift you.” <words>32</words>  
The computer’s screen flared, revealing a cascade of files. Mira’s breath caught. “This is… everything.” <words>33</words>  
Elias leaned closer, the price tag glowing faintly. “Not everything. Just the first page.” <words>34</words>  
The orchard’s roots shifted, as if the land itself had been waiting. Mira’s hands trembled, but she pressed a key. <words>35</words>  
The screen blinked, and the truth spilled out—corrupt officials, stolen land, the skyscraper’s collapse. <words>36</words>  
Elias felt the invisible allies surge, their presence a warm, humming force. “You’re not alone,” he murmured. <words>37</words>  
Mira’s eyes welled. “I thought I was. But the orchard… it’s been here all along.” <words>38</words>  
He nodded, the price tag now a symbol of their shared burden. “Some truths need a little help to be seen.” <words>39</words>  
The computer died again, but this time, the silence felt different—like a beginning. <words>40</words>  
Elias turned, his lethargy replaced by purpose. “Let’s make sure this one doesn’t fade.” <words>41</words>  
Mira followed, the orchard’s roots curling around them like a silent, enduring promise. <words>42</words>  
The skyscraper’s bones creaked, but the truth had found its voice. <words>43</words>  
And in the reclaimed farmland, where nature and ruin intertwined, a new story began. <words>44</words>
