The psychic genealogist traced her fingers over the chipped dice, its jagged edge catching the dim light of the space pirate ship brig. <words>20</words>  
The dice, a relic from a forgotten dynasty, had guided her through centuries of fragmented histories, each roll a whisper of what might have been. <words>34</words>  
Now, as the last star faded into morning light, she needed their answer more than ever. <words>44</words>  
The brig’s rusted bars echoed with the weight of her mission: to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak by unraveling the puzzle of destiny. <words>58</words>  
Her method? Diaries left on abandoned bullet trains, their ink faded but their secrets stubbornly preserved. <words>69</words>  
Each entry was a thread in the tapestry of fate, and she, a proudly humble archivist of the impossible, wove them into a narrative that defied time. <words>83</words>  
The pirate captain had captured her for trespassing on his derelict vessel, but she’d already seen the future in the dice’s fractured glow. <words>96</words>  
The train diaries, scattered across the void, held the key to lengthening the moment before the universe collapsed into silence. <words>109</words>  
She whispered to the chipped die, its surface warm with the heat of a thousand unspoken choices. <words>119</words>  
“Roll,” she said, and the die tumbled, landing on a number that made her breath hitch. <words>128</words>  
The captain, a hulking figure with a monocle of shattered glass, leaned closer, intrigued by her defiance. <words>139</words>  
“Why do you chase ghosts?” he asked, his voice a rasp of rust and regret. <words>148</words>  
“Because the past is the only compass left,” she replied, her tone a blend of grave playfulness and quiet resolve. <words>160</words>  
The diaries spoke of a lost colony, a place where time bent like a river, and she needed to reach it before the final star blinked out. <words>173</words>  
The dice, her loyal companion, had never failed her—until now. <words>181</words>  
She pressed her palm to the chipped edge, feeling the pulse of a thousand lives intertwined. <words>191</words>  
The captain’s laughter echoed, a sound as hollow as the ship’s corridors. <words>200</words>  
“Fate is a game of chance,” he said, “but you’re playing with a broken die.” <words>210</words>  
She smiled, her humility unshaken. “Then let the game begin.” <words>218</words>  
As the last star dissolved into dawn, she rolled the die once more, its chipped face catching the light like a promise. <words>231</words>  
The diaries, the dice, the brig—all were part of the puzzle, and she would not let the universe forget. <words>243</words>  
In the silence between heartbeats, she reached for the next page, her story a thread in the infinite weave of what was, what is, and what might yet be. <words>258</words>
