<story>  
The dry-witted sentinel stood at the threshold of the haunted lighthouse keeper’s bedroom, the frayed piece of rope coiled in their gloved hand like a serpent. <words>20</words>  
The room reeked of salt and regret, its walls lined with faded photographs of dancers, their movements frozen in time. <words>27</words>  
Just after the final name was crossed off the list, the sentinel had been ordered to confiscate anything that might “erode promises.” <words>37</words>  
The rope, they suspected, was the last tether between the lighthouse keeper and the world she’d abandoned. <words>45</words>  
“She’s not here,” the sentinel muttered, though the bed’s rumpled sheets and the faint scent of lavender suggested otherwise. <words>53</words>  
A shared love for a specific type of dance had once bound them—waltzes in the dark, their steps a language of defiance. <words>62</words>  
Now, the sentinel’s boots echoed against the floorboards, a rhythm that felt both reckless and precise. <words>69</words>  
The rope, frayed at the ends, had been used to secure the lighthouse’s lantern, a symbol of her duty. <words>76</words>  
But the list’s final name—her own—had been crossed out, and the promise of her return had unraveled. <words>84</words>  
“Certainly possible,” the sentinel said, though the words tasted like ash. <words>90</words>  
They had come to learn traditional methods, but the lighthouse keeper’s methods were buried in ghosts. <words>97</words>  
A flicker of movement in the mirror—her reflection, half-formed, waltzing alone. <words>104</words>  
The sentinel tightened their grip on the rope, its fibers rough against their palm. <words>110</words>  
“Your dance is over,” they said, but the words hung in the air, unconvincing. <words>117</words>  
The lighthouse keeper’s voice, soft as wind through broken glass, replied, “You never learned the steps.” <words>125</words>  
The sentinel turned, but the room was empty, save for the rope, now dangling from the ceiling. <words>133</words>  
They had been told to confiscate it, but the rope’s weight felt like a burden they couldn’t carry. <words>141</words>  
Eroding promises, they thought, were not so different from frayed fibers—unseen until they snapped. <words>149</words>  
The sentinel’s dry wit faltered as they traced the rope’s path, a spiral of hope and ruin. <words>157</words>  
The lighthouse keeper’s bedroom had always been a place of silence, but now it hummed with the ghosts of their dance. <words>166</words>  
“Certainly possible,” the sentinel repeated, this time to themselves, as the rope slipped from their grasp. <words>174</words>  
It fell to the floor, a tangle of history, and the sentinel knelt, fingers brushing the frayed ends. <words>182</words>  
They had come to confiscate, but the rope had other plans, its fibers whispering of a promise never meant to last. <words>191</words>  
The lighthouse keeper’s list was done, but the sentinel’s was just beginning. <words>198</words>  
They stood, the rope in hand, and for the first time, the weight of it felt like a choice. <words>205</words>  
Reckless precision, they thought, was the only way to dance with ghosts. <words>211</words>  
The lighthouse groaned, its light flickering, as if the sea itself were holding its breath. <words>218</words>  
The sentinel turned, the rope trailing behind, and stepped into the night, where the dance of eroding promises would continue. <words>227</words>
