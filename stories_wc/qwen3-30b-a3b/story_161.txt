The vigilant orchardist arrived at the paper airplane test facility precisely at 8:00 a.m., never tardy, his boots crunching gravel like a metronome. <words>10</words>  
His hands, calloused from years of pruning, clutched an antique letter seal, its silver crest etched with a peacock’s tail. <words>15</words>  
Volunteering here, he mused, was a way to outrun the past—his wife’s death, the orchard’s decline, the silence that followed. <words>23</words>  
The facility’s director, a woman with a penchant for absurdity, had tasked him with demonstrating how patterns in a peacock’s tail could predict flight trajectories. <words>32</words>  
He scoffed at the absurdity, but the seal’s design, a labyrinth of feathers, had haunted him since he’d found it in the attic. <words>40</words>  
“Why a peacock?” he asked, squinting at the bird’s iridescent plumage. <words>44</words>  
“Because,” the director replied, “the patterns are code. The government’s testing a conspiracy, and we’re the only ones who can unravel it.” <words>52</words>  
He laughed, sardonic glee bubbling up. “A conspiracy? You’re telling me the paper airplanes aren’t just for fun?” <words>60</words>  
The facility’s walls hummed with the whir of propellers, but the orchardist’s mind lingered on the seal. <words>66</words>  
Each feather on the peacock’s tail mirrored the seal’s engravings, a cipher he’d spent nights deciphering. <words>73</words>  
“Your wife loved puzzles,” the director said, catching his gaze. <words>77</words>  
He stiffened. “How do you know that?” <words>80</words>  
“Because she worked here. Before the accident.” <words>84</words>  
The orchardist’s breath hitched. The seal, he realized, was her signature. <words>89</words>  
He’d never believed in conspiracies, but now the facility’s purpose twisted into something darker. <words>96</words>  
The paper airplanes, he deduced, were not toys but messages—encoded in the peacock’s patterns, hidden in the orchardist’s own grief. <words>105</words>  
He demonstrated, tracing the seal’s design onto a plane’s wing, watching it soar. <words>111</words>  
The director’s eyes widened. “You’ve cracked it.” <words>115</words>  
The conspiracy, he learned, was a cover for a secret project: using avian patterns to manipulate flight data. <words>122</words>  
His wife had discovered the truth, and the facility had silenced her. <words>127</words>  
The orchardist’s hands trembled, not with fear, but with the weight of revelation. <words>133</words>  
He’d come here to escape, but the past had followed, stitched into the peacock’s tail. <words>140</words>  
“Why tell me?” he asked. <words>143</words>  
“Because you’re the only one who could see it,” the director said. “And because she believed in you.” <words>151</words>  
He nodded, the seal warm in his palm. The conspiracy was real, but so was his purpose. <words>158</words>  
The orchardist returned to the facility daily, his punctuality a vow. <words>164</words>  
He’d never be tardy again, not when the world’s secrets depended on his precision. <words>171</words>  
The peacock’s tail, once a curiosity, now pulsed with meaning. <words>177</words>  
And the orchardist, once a man of silence, found his voice in the hum of propellers and the whisper of feathers. <words>185</words>  
He’d unraveled the conspiracy, but more importantly, he’d reclaimed his story. <words>191</words>  
The sardonic glee returned, sharp and bitter, as he watched another plane take flight. <words>198</words>  
The past was a puzzle, and he’d finally found the last piece. <words>203</words>
