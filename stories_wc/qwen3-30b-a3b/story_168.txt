The stone circle stood silent, its weathered stones whispering secrets to the wind as the singer’s voice faltered between verses. <words>15</words>  
Elena, the ruthless flower arranger, adjusted her gloves, her fingers brushing the scuffed plastic comb in her pocket—a relic from a childhood she refused to discuss. <words>30</words>  
The watcher’s burden pressed on her shoulders, a weight she carried like a second skin, even as her intellect flitted unpredictably between ideas. <words>45</words>  
She had come to decode the rock art etched into the circle’s center, its symbols a puzzle she believed only her spontaneous mind could solve. <words>60</words>  
A sudden gust of wind scattered petals from her basket, and she cursed, her voice sharp but polite, a paradox she wore like a mask. <words>75</words>  
“Careful with the flowers,” a voice chimed from the shadows. A stranger emerged, his eyes gleaming with the same curiosity that drove her. <words>90</words>  
They struck up a conversation, their words weaving through the silence like threads in a tapestry, each sentence a step toward unraveling the stone circle’s mystery. <words>105</words>  
“Do you see the patterns?” he asked, pointing to a spiral carved into the rock. “It’s not just art—it’s a map.” <words>120</words>  
Elena’s pulse quickened. “A map to what?” she pressed, her ruthless precision clashing with the stranger’s playful spontaneity. <words>135</words>  
He shrugged. “The past, maybe. Or the future. Depends on how you distinguish the layers.” <words>150</words>  
The singer’s next verse began, a haunting melody that seemed to echo the stone circle’s ancient rhythm. <words>165</words>  
Elena closed her eyes, letting the music guide her hands as she traced the rock art, her comb slipping from her pocket and clattering to the ground. <words>180</words>  
The stranger retrieved it, inspecting the scuffed teeth. “This thing’s seen more than it’s worth,” he said, handing it back. <words>195</words>  
She snatched it, her jaw tightening. “It’s a tool. Not sentimental.” <words>210</words>  
He laughed, a sound that felt like breaking glass. “Polite anarchy, then. I like that.” <words>225</words>  
Their conversation deepened, the road trip of words leading them to a revelation: the symbols were not just a map but a warning, a record of those who had watched and failed. <words>240</words>  
Elena’s ruthless streak flared. “Why hide it? Why not destroy it?” <words>255</words>  
The stranger’s smile faded. “Because the watcher’s burden isn’t about control. It’s about remembering.” <words>270</words>  
The singer’s final note hung in the air, and the stone circle seemed to exhale. <words>285</words>  
Elena stared at the rock art, her comb now a symbol of the fragile line between knowledge and obsession. <words>300</words>  
She turned to the stranger, her voice softer. “What’s your name?” <words>315</words>  
“Call me a question,” he said, vanishing into the dusk as the circle’s shadows stretched like fingers. <words>330</words>  
Elena left the stone circle that night, the comb clutched in her hand, its scuffs a testament to the spontaneous truths she had yet to distinguish. <words>345</words>  
The watcher’s burden, she realized, was not a chain but a compass, and she would follow it wherever it led. <words>360</words>
