<story>  
The hesitant bard clutched the worn-out dinosaur plush, its fabric frayed by decades of whispered secrets. <words>10</words>  
The xenon-lit tunnel hummed with static, a relic of a forgotten era where time was a commodity traded in fragments. <words>15</words>  
He had come to the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget, a moment etched in collective grief. <words>20</words>  
The dream-hopping machine, a rusted contraption of gears and glass, promised to unravel the tapestry woven from sorrow. <words>25</words>  
His voice, shyly loud, trembled as he sang the first note—a melody that had once comforted a child now lost to the void. <words>30</words>  
The plush, a relic from his mother’s final days, pulsed faintly, as if the fabric remembered the weight of her tears. <words>35</words>  
The machine’s core flared, and the tunnel dissolved into a kaleidoscope of fractured memories. <words>40</words>  
He landed in a memory of the year’s end: a child’s laughter, a fire’s embers, and the sound of a door slamming shut. <words>45</words>  
The dinosaur plush, now vibrant and new, clutched a letter he had never sent—a plea for forgiveness. <words>50</words>  
He reached out, but the memory dissolved, leaving only the ache of what could not be reclaimed. <words>55</words>  
The machine’s gears groaned, spitting him back into the tunnel, where the xenon lights flickered like dying stars. <words>60</words>  
His hands shook, but the plush’s threadbare seams seemed to whisper, *“Time is a fragile thing, but it is all we have.”* <words>65</words>  
He sang again, this time not to change the past, but to honor its weight—a song that echoed through the tunnel’s hollow bones. <words>70</words>  
The dream-hopping machine sputtered, its purpose fulfilled, as the bard’s voice became a bridge between sorrow and surrender. <words>75</words>  
The xenon lights dimmed, and the tunnel, once a prison of time, now felt like a cathedral of fleeting moments. <words>80</words>  
He cradled the plush, its frayed edges a testament to the beauty of impermanence. <words>85</words>  
The year’s end had not been a failure, but a lesson in the irony of awe—the way grief could forge a song that outlived the silence. <words>90</words>  
The bard stepped into the tunnel’s exit, the plush a quiet companion, and the world beyond felt both foreign and familiar. <words>95</words>  
He had not motivated the past to change, but he had found a way to carry its sorrow without being consumed by it. <words>100</words>  
The xenon-lit tunnel faded behind him, a relic of a journey that had taught him to sing, not to conquer, but to exist. <words>105</words>  
The worn-out dinosaur plush, once a symbol of loss, now pulsed with the quiet rhythm of a life that had learned to endure. <words>110</words>  
And in the fragile space between memory and hope, the bard’s song lingered—a testament to the irony of time’s fleeting, luminous grace. <words>115</words>
