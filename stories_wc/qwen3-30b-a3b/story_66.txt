<story>  
The quiet deserter wandered the plant communication study, a place where leaves whispered secrets to those who listened. <words>10</words>  
His cracked mirror, a relic from a life he’d abandoned, reflected more than his face—it fractured the world into jagged truths. <words>14</words>  
He had left the war not for glory, but to find a place where he truly belonged, even if it was nowhere. <words>18</words>  
The study’s scientists called it a breakthrough: decoding plant signals through jigsaw puzzles of root networks. <words>22</words>  
But the deserter saw something else—a cycle of silence, a pattern he needed to break. <words>26</words>  
Each morning, he carbonized dead leaves, turning them into ash that smelled of forgotten promises. <words>30</words>  
The process was slow, but he believed in the method: by reconstructing stories from shattered porcelain masks, he might piece together his own. <words>35</words>  
The masks, found in the study’s archives, were once used in rituals to communicate with the earth. <words>39</words>  
He traced their cracks, imagining the voices they’d once carried, and wondered if belonging was a story he could rewrite. <words>44</words>  
The plant communication study was dizzyingly grounded, its soil rich with the weight of unspoken histories. <words>48</words>  
He worked in silence, his hands stained with carbon and soil, as the jigsaw puzzles of roots grew more complex. <words>52</words>  
The scientists dismissed his obsession, but he knew the truth: the cycle was a lie, and he was the only one who could shatter it. <words>57</words>  
One night, he placed the cracked mirror beside a mask, its reflection merging with the porcelain’s fractured surface. <words>61</words>  
For the first time, the mirror showed not his face, but a field of glowing roots, pulsing with life. <words>65</words>  
He laughed, a sound both noble and foolish, as the plants hummed in response. <words>69</words>  
The cycle was breaking, not with violence, but with stories reassembled from ruin. <words>73</words>  
He had found a place where he belonged—not in the world, but in the act of becoming. <words>77</words>  
The mirror, now whole in his mind, no longer needed to reflect the past. <words>81</words>  
He carbonized another leaf, this time with a smile, and wondered if the plants had always known. <words>85</words>  
The study’s walls, once cold, now felt like a home he’d never left. <words>89</words>  
His quiet desertion had not been a failure, but a beginning. <words>93</words>  
The jigsaw puzzles of roots and masks and mirrors formed a map he would never need to follow. <words>97</words>  
In the end, he was not a soldier, not a scientist, but a man who had learned to listen. <words>101</words>  
And in that listening, he found the courage to be nowhere, and everything. <words>105</words>
