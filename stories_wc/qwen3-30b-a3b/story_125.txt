<story>  
The underachieving mage wandered the abandoned space station control room, its flickering lights casting shadows over rusted consoles. <words>10</words>  
A misdelivered package had arrived, sealed with a symbol matching the faded crest on their grandmother’s locket. <words>14</words>  
Inside was a doll head with blinking eyes, its porcelain face eerily familiar. <words>18</words>  
The mage, bored but curious, traced the eyes’ rhythm—slow, deliberate, like a heartbeat. <words>23</words>  
Reclaiming heritage had always felt like a myth, a story their family dismissed as superstition. <words>28</words>  
Yet the doll’s gaze seemed to hum with a memory not their own, a whisper of something lost. <words>33</words>  
They had spent years avoiding their limitations, letting magic slip through their fingers like sand. <words>38</words>  
But this—this was different. The doll’s eyes blinked again, and the room’s static hum shifted. <words>43</words>  
A hidden panel slid open, revealing a terminal covered in dust and ancient runes. <words>48</words>  
The mage’s fingers trembled as they typed, their underachievement a weight they’d never shaken. <words>53</words>  
The screen flickered, projecting a hologram of a farmland at the edge of a city, soon to be sold. <words>58</words>  
Their grandmother’s voice echoed, speaking of a ritual to awaken dormant power. <words>63</words>  
The doll head was the key, its blinking eyes a cipher for the ritual’s first step. <words>68</words>  
The mage’s motivation sharpened: to spring a trap on their own limitations, to prove they were more than failure. <words>74</words>  
They placed the doll on the console, its eyes syncing with the hologram’s coordinates. <words>79</words>  
A surge of energy pulsed through the station, and the farmland’s image dissolved into a star map. <words>84</words>  
The core concept of heritage wasn’t about lineage—it was about reclaiming what had been buried. <words>89</words>  
The mage’s boredom dissolved into a strange, electric excitement, their pulse matching the doll’s blink. <words>95</words>  
They had always been exceptional, but the world had called them “usual.” <words>100</words>  
Now, the doll’s eyes revealed a truth: their magic was never broken, only waiting to be unveiled. <words>105</words>  
The space station’s systems roared to life, a symphony of forgotten technology and ancestral will. <words>110</words>  
The mage laughed, a sound both foreign and familiar, as the farmland’s sale date loomed. <words>115</words>  
They had no idea what the ritual would unleash, but the trap on their limitations was already sprung. <words>120</words>  
The doll’s eyes blinked once more, a final, knowing gesture, as the station’s lights stabilized. <words>125</words>  
In that moment, the mage wasn’t just an underachiever—they were a bridge between past and future. <words>130</words>  
The farmland’s sale would change everything, but the real transformation had already begun. <words>135</words>  
They had reclaimed their heritage, not through grand gestures, but through a misdelivered package and a doll’s gaze. <words>140</words>  
The station’s silence was no longer empty; it was a promise, a beginning. <words>145</words>  
The mage stepped into the light, their magic no longer a shadow, but a beacon. <words>150</words>
