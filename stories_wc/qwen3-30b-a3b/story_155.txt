Kael, an underwater welder, spent his days repairing the skeletal remains of a broken planetarium reimagined as a nightclub, its domed ceiling cracked like a spiderweb. <words>15</words> The air smelled of salt and ozone, a relic of the ocean he left behind. <words>22</words> He’d never believed in ghosts, but the club’s mirrors—frosted with age—whispered secrets only he could hear. <words>32</words> One night, he found a vintage button box tucked behind a dusty display, its brass surface etched with constellations. <words>42</words> The box hummed faintly, as if it remembered the hands that had once pressed its buttons. <words>50</words> Kael, patiently impatient, pried it open, revealing a labyrinth of tiny, glowing switches. <words>59</words> Each press sent ripples through the mirrors, revealing glimpses of a timeline where the planetarium had never collapsed. <words>69</words> In those reflections, he saw himself—older, wiser, wielding a power that defied logic. <words>78</words> The club’s patrons, oblivious to the fractures in reality, danced to a playlist of static and forgotten lullabies. <words>88</words> Kael’s motivation burned: to wield improbable power, to stitch together the timelines at their crossing point. <words>98</words> He pored over the box, learning its language, each button a key to a door he hadn’t yet dared to open. <words>108</words> The planetarium’s broken state was no accident; it was a wound, a place where time bled into itself. <words>118</words> He’d heard tales of the “crossing,” a moment where two timelines should never meet, and now he stood at its edge. <words>128</words> The box’s buttons pulsed in time with his heartbeat, a rhythm that felt both foreign and familiar. <words>137</words> Kael’s hands, calloused from years of welding, trembled as he pressed a switch. <words>144</words> The mirrors shattered, not with sound, but with silence, and the club dissolved into a void of stars. <words>153</words> In that void, he saw the truth: the box was a relic of a forgotten civilization, a device to unravel the fabric of existence. <words>163</words> His patience frayed; the weight of the timelines pressed against his chest. <words>170</words> He had to choose—restore the planetarium, or let the unraveling consume everything. <words>178</words> The box’s final button glowed, a siren’s call to power. <words>184</words> Kael, who’d spent his life repairing what was broken, now faced the paradox of creation. <words>193</words> He patted the box, a gesture of pampering, as if it were a living thing. <words>200</words> The mirrors flickered, and for a moment, the club’s patrons saw the truth: a man standing at the edge of the impossible. <words>210</words> Kael’s breath caught. The timelines were unraveling, and he was the thread. <words>217</words> He pressed the last button, not to wield power, but to let the unraveling be. <words>225</words> The planetarium collapsed, not in destruction, but in rebirth, a new timeline blooming from the ashes. <words>235</words> Kael, now a ghost in the club’s memory, watched as the mirrors reflected a world where the impossible was possible. <words>245</words> The box, once a relic, became a legend, its buttons forever silent, its power inherited by the stars. <words>255</words> In the end, the moments of unraveling were not a failure, but a beginning. <words>262</words>
