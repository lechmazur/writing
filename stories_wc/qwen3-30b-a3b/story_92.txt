Elias, a dog walker for the ultra-rich, navigated the creaking halls of the Blackthorn Manor, his boots silent on the marble floor. <words>20</words> The mansion’s dining room, with its stained-glass windows and overgrown botanical collection, was a place of whispered rules and silent agreements. <words>37</words> He had been told not to linger, but the scent of jasmine and decay in the air tugged at him, a paradoxical invitation. <words>53</words> His clients, wealthy and reclusive, trusted him to walk their dogs without question, a carefully careless arrangement that left him both free and bound. <words>71</words> The sun dipped low, bleeding color into the sky as Elias approached the dining room, its grand table strewn with wilted orchids and vials of preserved leaves. <words>89</words> He paused, the silence loud, the weight of the mansion’s secrets pressing against his ribs. <words>102</words> The botanical collection, a relic of the family’s obsession with the unnatural, seemed to pulse in the fading light, its specimens frozen in a state of perpetual decay. <words>119</words> Elias had no right to be here, but his motivation—to stand where fear dares not tread—had always been louder than his caution. <words>136</words> A flicker of movement in the shadows made him freeze, the air thick with the scent of blood and something sweet, like overripe fruit. <words>151</words> He turned, expecting a servant, but found only a blood drive tent set up in the corner, its red banners stark against the gloom. <words>166</words> The method of his encounter was an accident, but the man behind the counter, a doctor with a scarred hand, offered him a vial of his own blood. <words>183</words> “To justify your presence,” the doctor said, his voice a rasp. <words>192</words> Elias hesitated, the silent agreements of the mansion clashing with the doctor’s offer. <words>204</words> The man’s eyes, sharp and knowing, mirrored the botanical collection’s eerie stillness. <words>216</words> “You’re not the first to seek answers here,” he murmured, “but you’re the first who dares to ask.” <words>229</words> The blood drive’s hum filled the room, a loud silence that drowned out the mansion’s whispers. <words>241</words> Elias drank the vial, its metallic tang a shock, and felt the weight of the mansion’s secrets shift. <words>255</words> The botanical collection, once a symbol of control, now seemed to lean toward him, its leaves trembling as if in recognition. <words>269</words> He had justified his presence, but the mansion’s true nature remained a riddle, its answers buried in the soil of its forgotten past. <words>285</words> As the last light faded, Elias stepped back into the shadows, the silent agreements of the ultra-rich no longer a chain but a key. <words>300</words> The mansion’s dining room, with its blood drive and botanical collection, had become a place where fear and curiosity collided, and Elias, carefully careless, had found his footing. <words>317</words> The color had bled from day into night, but the story was only beginning. <words>328</words>
