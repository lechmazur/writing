The abandoned schoolhouse creaked in the hush of the unremembered future, its windows shattered like the dreams of those who once walked its halls. <words>10</words> Lucky gambler Eli found himself here, drawn by whispers of a botanical diary hidden in the dust. <words>14</words> He never believed in relics, but the promise of power—however corrupt—was a gamble he couldn’t resist. <words>20</words> The diary, bound in cracked leather, pulsed faintly as he opened it, its pages filled with sketches of plants that shouldn’t exist. <words>25</words> “Typically never,” he muttered, recalling his rule of avoiding anything that felt too alive. <words>30</words> Yet here he was, fingers tracing the ink of a flower that bloomed only in the shadows of forgotten hopes. <words>35</words>  

A flicker of movement caught his eye—a child’s laughter, though the town was empty. <words>40</words> Eli spun the bottle of confessions he’d found in the school’s broken desk, its glass swirling with a liquid that shimmered like liquid starlight. <words>46</words> The bottle landed on a faded chalkboard, its message scrawled in a child’s hand: “I duplicated the diary to save us all.” <words>52</words> He laughed, a sound both bitter and bright, as the weight of the unremembered future pressed against his ribs. <words>58</words> The diary’s pages fluttered, and the plants within seemed to breathe, their roots curling toward him like fingers. <words>64</words>  

Eli’s heart raced. This was no ordinary relic—it was a key to something vast, something that could rewrite the rules of power. <words>70</words> He spun the bottle again, its liquid swirling faster, and the schoolhouse groaned as if the walls themselves were holding their breath. <words>76</words> The confessions began to spill: “I stole the diary to escape the silence.” “I duplicated it to feel alive.” “I corrupted it to break the cycle.” <words>83</words> Each truth twisted the air, and Eli felt the weight of their desperation. <words>88</words> He had always gambled with fate, but this was different—this was a game where the stakes were the very fabric of existence. <words>94</words>  

The diary’s pages multiplied, each copy a mirror of the last, yet each one darker, more twisted. <words>100</words> Eli’s hands trembled as he held them, the corruption of power seeping into his veins. <words>105</words> He had come to defy the gravity of hopelessness, but now he wondered if he was the one dragging others down. <words>111</words> The schoolhouse’s shadows thickened, and the laughter returned, louder this time, a chorus of voices that echoed his own. <words>117</words> In the hush of the unremembered future, Eli smiled, a flicker of cheerful despair in his eyes. <words>123</words> The game wasn’t over—not yet. <words>126</words>
