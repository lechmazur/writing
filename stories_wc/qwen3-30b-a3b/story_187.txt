The stoic wanderer stepped into the witch’s familiar training ground, where the air hummed with forgotten incantations. <words>20</words>  
At the moment a teacher wiped the final formula away, he found the floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface mesmerizingly bland. <words>24</words>  
He had come to archive ritual practices, but the trail of nightmares had led him here, a path that imposed its will upon his resolve. <words>23</words>  
The floorboard, splintered and dull, felt like a relic of a life he’d never known, yet its presence pulsed with a quiet authority. <words>23</words>  
The teacher’s hands trembled as they erased the last glyph, their voice a rasp of regret. “Some truths are too dangerous to keep,” they muttered. <words>22</words>  
The wanderer’s jaw tightened. Necessary lies, he thought, were the only currency left in a world that devoured its own. <words>20</words>  
He reached for the floorboard, its edges cool against his palm, and pressed it into the earth where the teacher’s spell had begun. <words>21</words>  
The ground shuddered, and the air thickened with the scent of burnt sage and old secrets. <words>14</words>  
The teacher turned, eyes wide. “You don’t understand—” <words>8</words>  
“I understand enough,” the wanderer said, his voice a blade wrapped in velvet. “This place isn’t yours to erase.” <words>18</words>  
The floorboard glowed faintly, its blandness now a beacon. The teacher’s spell unraveled, threads of magic spiraling into the sky. <words>20</words>  
The wanderer’s hands shook, not from fear, but from the weight of what he’d done. Brash tenderness, he realized, was the only way to hold the world together. <words>21</words>  
The training ground fell silent, the nightmares retreating like shadows at dawn. <words>11</words>  
He knelt, pressing the floorboard deeper, a silent vow to preserve what others sought to destroy. <words>16</words>  
The teacher, defeated, whispered, “Why?” <words>6</words>  
“Because some lies are necessary,” he said, turning away. “And some truths are too heavy to carry alone.” <words>19</words>  
The forest swallowed him, the floorboard’s quiet hum a promise that the past would not be forgotten. <words>16</words>  
He walked on, a stoic wanderer with a burden that no one else could see. <words>14</words>  
The witch’s familiar training ground remained, its secrets buried but not gone, waiting for the next soul brave enough to impose their will. <words>20</words>  
The wanderer’s shadow stretched long, a testament to the lies he’d told and the truths he’d kept. <words>16</words>  
In the end, he had not saved the formula, but he had saved its memory, a fragile thing, yet unyielding. <words>17</words>  
The floorboard, once plain, now gleamed with the quiet power of a story that refused to die. <words>16</words>  
He smiled, just once, a flicker of tenderness in a world that had no use for it. <words>14</words>  
And the nightmares, for the first time, did not follow. <words>9</words>
