The exorcist’s hands trembled as she adjusted the helmet, the orbital debris swirling like a funeral shroud outside the airlock. <words>10</words>  
Her stage fright had never been this acute—this wasn’t a theater, but the void between dying stars. <words>16</words>  
The pressed wildflowers in her pocket were a relic from her mother, a woman who’d lied about the true cost of exorcism. <words>24</words>  
“Never usual,” her father had whispered before the accident, a phrase that now echoed in her skull like a curse. <words>31</words>  
She submerse herself into the debris field, the sound of a key turning in a lock triggering a memory of her mother’s final breath. <words>41</words>  
The core concept of inheritance of lies had poisoned her bloodline, each generation burying truth beneath rituals of fear. <words>49</words>  
Amid toy assembly on the station’s lower deck, a child’s laughter pierced the static—a sound that should’ve been impossible in the vacuum. <words>58</words>  
The exorcist’s breath fogged the visor as she traced the wildflowers’ pressed petals, their colors faded but their scent still sharp. <words>67</words>  
Her motivation was to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to break the cycle of lies that had hollowed her family. <words>76</words>  
The key’s turning sound grew louder, a metallic rasp that matched the rhythm of her heartbeat. <words>82</words>  
She drifted toward the source, the debris slicing her suit like a thousand silent knives, each shard a fragment of a forgotten world. <words>91</words>  
The toy assembly had been a distraction—a child’s model of a spaceship, its tiny parts glinting in the dark, a symbol of hope she’d once abandoned. <words>101</words>  
Her father’s voice returned, a phantom whisper: “You’ll never be enough.” <words>107</words>  
But the exorcist had learned to defy the hush, to let her silence scream. <words>113</words>  
The lock clicked open, revealing a chamber where the debris coalesced into a shape—her mother’s face, frozen in a scream. <words>122</words>  
The wildflowers pulsed in her hand, their pressed petals blooming into something alive, something that hummed with the defiance of a thousand unspoken truths. <words>133</words>  
She submerse herself deeper, not into the void, but into the lie that had bound her. <words>140</words>  
The core concept of inheritance of lies unraveled as she touched the ghost, her stage fright dissolving into a roar that shattered the silence. <words>150</words>  
The toy assembly’s laughter swelled, a chorus of children from every forgotten world, their voices weaving a new narrative. <words>159</words>  
She sculpted possibility from the ashes of “never,” her hands shaping the debris into a bridge, a path through the void. <words>168</words>  
The key turned again, this time in her palm, its teeth biting into her skin as the chamber collapsed. <words>176</words>  
The exorcist floated upward, the wildflowers now a constellation in her hair, their pressed petals blooming into stars. <words>185</words>  
Her father’s voice was gone, replaced by the defiant hush of a universe that had finally listened. <words>193</words>  
She had never been usual, and that was the point. <words>198</words>
