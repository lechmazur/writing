<story>  
In the orchard of giant ferns, where waterfalls whispered secrets to the earth, the blank-faced performer sat before a piano, fingers hovering over keys as if waiting for a dream to materialize. <words>25</words>  
The plain plastic ring, worn on their left hand, glinted faintly under the moon’s fractured light, a relic of a ritual they had never questioned. <words>25</words>  
During piano practice, they tracked moon paths across the sky, their movements precise, their expression as blank as the pages of an unopened book. <words>25</words>  
The orchard’s shadows stretched like ink spilled on parchment, and the performer’s task was to approve or deny the rumors that bloomed in the air—whispers of forgotten languages, of dreams that could be translated. <words>25</words>  
Their motivation was simple: to learn the language of dreams, a goal as fragile as the ferns’ fronds brushing against their shoulders. <words>25</words>  
The guardian of rumors, they believed, was not a title but a function, a role as uniquely typical as the plastic ring they wore, which had no history, no weight, only a single, unbroken circle. <words>25</words>  
Each night, they played a different melody, the notes rising like smoke through the waterfalls’ mist, and the moon’s path dictated the rhythm, a silent collaborator in their quest. <words>25</words>  
The performer’s blank face was not emptiness but a mirror, reflecting the precise madness of a world where dreams and rumors were indistinguishable. <words>25</words>  
They had no name, only a function: to approve the rumors that aligned with the moon’s arc, to reject those that strayed. <words>25</words>  
The piano’s keys were their compass, the orchard’s ferns their archive, and the waterfalls’ roar their only audience. <words>25</words>  
One evening, a new rumor surfaced—a dream of a language that could bend time, its words etched in the moon’s shadow. <words>25</words>  
The performer paused, the ring cold against their skin, and for the first time, the moon’s path seemed to waver, as if uncertain. <words>25</words>  
They played the melody, but the notes faltered, and the orchard’s silence deepened, heavy with the weight of an unapproved truth. <words>25</words>  
The waterfalls, once a steady hum, now echoed with a discordant hum, as if the earth itself questioned the performer’s authority. <words>25</words>  
Yet the blank-faced performer did not flinch. They adjusted the ring, its plastic surface smooth, and resumed their task, the moon’s path a fragile thread they could not sever. <words>25</words>  
The language of dreams, they knew, was not in the words but in the act of approval, the ritual of tracking, the precision of a madness that required no explanation. <words>25</words>  
And so, the orchard endured, its ferns towering, its waterfalls relentless, as the performer played on, a guardian of rumors, a keeper of the unspoken. <words>25</words>  
The moon’s path shifted, and the performer’s fingers moved, not in defiance, but in harmony, their blank face a testament to the quiet, precise madness of a world that demanded to be heard. <words>25</words>
