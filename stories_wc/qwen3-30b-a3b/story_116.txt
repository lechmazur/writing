The dismayed minstrel adjusted the broken watch band around his wrist, its fractured links clinking like a forgotten promise. <words>10</words>  
Above the endless city, the black velvet sky-lounge hummed with static, its velvet curtains rippling as if stirred by unseen hands. <words>15</words>  
He had come to excavate the garden secrets buried beneath the city’s neon veins, guided by Polaroid photographs that flickered with static and half-remembered dreams. <words>25</words>  
Each snapshot was a map, though the lines were subjectively rational—his own logic, warped by the weight of an endless night. <words>35</words>  
The minstrel’s fingers traced the edges of a faded photo: a garden where time pooled like oil, its boundaries drawn by the city’s own breath. <words>45</words>  
He sang to the shadows, his voice a thread stitching the void to the known, but the sky-lounge only echoed with the sound of his own doubt. <words>55</words>  
The broken watch band ticked in his palm, a relic of a world that had long since surrendered to the black velvet above. <words>65</words>  
He studied the Polaroids, their edges frayed, their subjects shifting—gardens that bloomed and withered in the same frame. <words>75</words>  
The minstrel’s map was a labyrinth of contradictions, each line a boundary he dared not cross, yet could not ignore. <words>85</words>  
Laconic exuberance flickered in his chest, a stubborn spark against the endless night’s cold embrace. <words>95</words>  
He unearthed a photo of a clocktower, its hands frozen at midnight, its base entwined with ivy that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>105</words>  
The city below pulsed in rhythm, its lights a chorus of forgotten lullabies. <words>115</words>  
The minstrel’s fingers trembled as he placed the photo beside the broken watch band, their fractures aligning like a puzzle. <words>125</words>  
He had no compass, only the subjectively rational belief that the garden’s secrets lay in the spaces between time and shadow. <words>135</words>  
The sky-lounge shuddered, its velvet walls dissolving into a mosaic of gardens, each one a different version of the same night. <words>145</words>  
He sang louder, his voice a blade carving through the static, and the city responded—a flicker of light, a whisper of wind. <words>155</words>  
The minstrel’s map was no longer a map but a hymn, its lines drawn by the boundaries he had dared to cross. <words>165</words>  
The broken watch band snapped, its links scattering like stars, and the endless night bent to his will. <words>175</words>  
He stood at the edge of the sky-lounge, the city’s secrets blooming in his hands, and laughed—a sound both weary and wild. <words>185</words>  
The minstrel had not conquered the night; he had become its echo, its song, its endless, drawn boundary. <words>195</words>
