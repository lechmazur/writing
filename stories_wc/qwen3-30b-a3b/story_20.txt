The disappointed archer rode through the twilight, his bow slung across his back like a ghost of past triumphs. <words>10</words> The inverted waterfall loomed ahead, its waters defying gravity, cascading upward into a sky streaked with the slow dance of celestial bodies. <words>20</words> He had not planned to stop, but the roadside attraction—a rusted sign reading “Echo Falls”—pulled him in, its promise of surreal beauty an anchor against the weight of his regret. <words>34</words> Anxiously calm, he dismounted, the air thick with the scent of ozone and forgotten dreams. <words>44</words> The bridge of regret, a skeletal structure of iron and memory, stretched over the inverted cascade, its planks worn smooth by the footsteps of those who had come before. <words>56</words> He hesitated, fingers brushing the tarnished silver comb in his pocket—a relic from a woman he had failed to protect, its teeth jagged with the passage of time. <words>69</words> The comb’s presence was a wound he could not close, a reminder of the social movements he had once vowed to chronicle, now reduced to ink-stained pages gathering dust. <words>83</words> He stepped onto the bridge, each creak a whisper of his unspoken failures, the inverted waterfall’s glow casting his shadow in reverse. <words>95</words> Below, the water spiraled upward, a mirror of the stars above, and for a moment, he felt the weight of the cosmos press against his chest. <words>107</words> The bridge of regret was not a place but a state, a confrontation with the choices that had shaped him—his silence during the protests, his refusal to fight for the voiceless. <words>121</words> He had once believed in the power of stories, in the way a single arrow could pierce the veil of apathy. <words>131</words> Now, the comb’s tarnish mirrored his own, a symbol of the passion he had let wither into disinterest. <words>141</words> A gust of wind carried the scent of rain, and he closed his eyes, the celestial bodies’ slow dance a reminder that time was both a thief and a teacher. <words>153</words> When he opened them, the bridge was gone, replaced by a field of fractured mirrors reflecting a thousand versions of himself—some archer, some man, some ghost. <words>166</words> He reached for the comb, its silver surface catching the inverted light, and for the first time, he saw not failure but a thread, a fragile link between his past and the movements still waiting to be born. <words>180</words> The archer turned, the roadside attraction fading behind him, his bow now a tool not of war but of witness, his heart a compass pointing toward the uncharted. <words>193</words> The inverted waterfall remained, a testament to the paradox of regret: that to confront it was to find the courage to begin again. <words>203</words>
