<story>  
The abandoned space station medical bay hummed with the universe’s secret song, a low, resonant vibration that clung to the walls like dust. <words>10</words>  
Elias, the forthright peddler, moved through the sterile corridors, his meekly assertive steps echoing in the silence. <words>14</words>  
He carried a dried flower bouquet, its petals brittle with time, a relic from a life he’d sworn to leave behind. <words>18</words>  
The bouquet was both burden and compass, its faded colors a reminder of the oath sealed in blood he now sought to break. <words>23</words>  
By sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns etched into the station’s decaying data cores, he hoped to find the key to redemption’s path. <words>28</words>  
The columns spoke of betrayals and lost causes, their words a tangled web of half-truths and forgotten names. <words>32</words>  
Elias paused at a terminal, his fingers trembling as he scrolled through the static-laced archives. <words>36</words>  
A fragment of a name—*Veyra*—caught his eye, a whisper from the past that might unravel the chains of his guilt. <words>41</words>  
He divided the bouquet’s stems, scattering the dried flowers like seeds into the station’s air vents, a ritual of release. <words>46</words>  
The petals drifted, caught in the hum of the universe, their journey mirroring his own. <words>50</words>  
Joyful loneliness clung to him, a bittersweet ache that neither the station’s silence nor the bouquet’s decay could erase. <words>55</words>  
The medical bay’s lights flickered, casting shadows that danced like ghosts of the station’s former patients. <words>60</words>  
Elias remembered the oath: a promise to protect Veyra, now broken by his own hand. <words>64</words>  
The gossip columns had hinted at a hidden chamber, a place where the station’s secrets lay buried. <words>69</words>  
He followed the clues, his meekly assertive resolve hardening with each step. <words>73</words>  
The air grew colder as he neared the chamber, the hum of the universe deepening into a mournful dirge. <words>78</words>  
Inside, a terminal pulsed with a single message: *“Redemption is not a destination, but a choice.”* <words>83</words>  
Elias’s breath caught. The bouquet’s stems, now scattered, had guided him here. <words>88</words>  
He reached out, his fingers brushing the terminal, and the station’s hum shifted, a note of hope in its song. <words>93</words>  
The oath, once a shackle, now felt like a thread he could untie. <words>97</words>  
The dried flowers, once symbols of loss, became emblems of his resolve to mend what he’d broken. <words>102</words>  
As the station’s lights dimmed, Elias smiled, the weight of his past lightening with each step toward the unknown. <words>107</words>  
The universe hummed on, its secret song a lullaby for the broken and the brave. <words>111</words>  
In the silence, Elias found not solitude, but the quiet joy of a path chosen. <words>115</words>  
The bouquet’s final petal drifted into the void, a farewell and a beginning. <words>119</words>  
He had divided the past, and in doing so, found the courage to begin again. <words>124</words>  
The station’s hum faded, but the song of redemption remained, a melody only the meekly assertive could hear. <words>129</words>  
Elias stepped into the darkness, his heart lighter, his purpose clearer. <words>133</words>  
The universe, ever patient, waited for the next note in his story. <words>137</words>
