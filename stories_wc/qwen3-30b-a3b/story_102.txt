The map projection room hummed with the static of forgotten trails, its walls lined with parchment that whispered of uncharted horizons. <words>1</words>  
Kael, a spineless mercenary, traced the edges of a Victorian dollhouse key, its brass surface etched with symbols that seemed grandly trivial. <words>10</words>  
The hush after the wind no longer howled had settled over the room, a silence so thick it pressed against his ribs like a second skin. <words>19</words>  
His mentor, a ghost of a man named Veyra, had left him here with only a riddle: "To hush a prophecy, you must first listen to the code in the dust." <words>31</words>  
Kael’s fingers trembled as he turned the key, its weight a mockery of the power it promised. <words>38</words>  
The map projection room was a labyrinth of shifting cartography, its floor a mosaic of constellations and forgotten routes. <words>47</words>  
He had once been a soldier, but the war had left him hollow, his spine a hollow reed bending to every breeze of fear. <words>57</words>  
Veyra had found him in a tavern, drunk on regret, and offered him this quest—a chance to atone for the lives he’d failed to protect. <words>68</words>  
The prophecy, spoken in code, was said to be buried in the dollhouse’s labyrinthine design, a puzzle only the "unseen" could solve. <words>79</words>  
Kael’s breath fogged the glass of a nearby window, where a single candle flickered, casting shadows that danced like whispers. <words>88</words>  
He pressed the key into a crevice of the map, and the room shuddered, revealing a hidden corridor that had never existed. <words>97</words>  
The air there was colder, charged with a luminous doubt that made his skin prickle. <words>104</words>  
The corridor led to a chamber where a dollhouse stood, its miniature rooms glowing with an eerie, golden light. <words>113</words>  
Inside, Kael found a note: "The code is not in the walls, but in the silence between them." <words>121</words>  
He knelt, pressing his ear to the floorboards, and heard a faint, rhythmic ticking—a heartbeat of the prophecy. <words>130</words>  
The dollhouse’s key fit into a tiny lock beneath the floor, and the room split open, revealing a staircase descending into darkness. <words>140</words>  
At the bottom, a chamber pulsed with bioluminescent fungi, its walls etched with the prophecy’s code. <words>148</words>  
Kael’s spineless nature had always been his curse, but here, in the hush of the unknown, he felt a flicker of resolve. <words>158</words>  
He deciphered the code, realizing it was a map to a place where the world’s edges blurred—a horizon uncharted by any map. <words>168</words>  
As he emerged, the room’s light dimmed, and Veyra’s voice echoed: "You have hushed the prophecy, but the journey is only beginning." <words>179</words>  
Kael stood at the threshold, the dollhouse key still warm in his hand, its grandly trivial weight now a symbol of his uncharted future. <words>189</words>  
The wind howled again, but this time, Kael did not flinch. <words>194</words>
