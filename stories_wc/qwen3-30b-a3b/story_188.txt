<story>  
The former lawman arrived at the ancient Japanese castle as the first rains of seed planting began, his boots sinking into the mud like forgotten vows. <words>10</words>  
The vintage spectacles, cracked and tarnished, hung from his neck, a relic of a life he’d sworn to leave behind. <words>12</words>  
He’d heard the castle was a place where broken things could be mended, though the locals whispered it was probably improbable. <words>15</words>  
A misplaced letter, addressed to a dead man, found its way to his room, its ink smudged by the rain. <words>13</words>  
Inside was a plea for help, written in a hand he recognized—his own, though he’d never sent it. <words>13</words>  
He stirred the tea in his cup, watching the leaves curl like the scars on his hands. <words>11</words>  
The castle’s gardens, overgrown and wild, mirrored the chaos in his mind, each weed a reminder of the cycles he’d tried to break. <words>15</words>  
He’d once hunted men who’d betrayed him, but now he sought something else: a way to gather the broken pieces of his soul. <words>16</words>  
The spectacles, when he put them on, made the world sharper, but also more painful, as if the truth had teeth. <words>14</words>  
At night, he wandered the stone corridors, listening to the wind howl like the ghosts of those he’d failed. <words>13</words>  
The letter’s sender, a woman named Akira, had written of a hidden garden where seeds of forgiveness could be planted. <words>14</words>  
He followed the map etched into the letter’s edge, a path through the castle’s ruins that seemed to defy logic. <words>14</words>  
The garden was real, a patch of earth where the soil was still soft, waiting for something to take root. <words>13</words>  
He knelt, fingers trembling, and began to stir the dirt, as if the act could stir something in himself. <words>13</words>  
The spectacles fogged with his breath, blurring the lines between past and present, between the man he was and the man he might become. <words>16</words>  
A single seed, cracked but alive, lay in his palm—a symbol, he thought, of the improbable. <words>13</words>  
He planted it with the same care he’d once given to his gun, each motion a prayer for a different kind of peace. <words>14</words>  
The corroded rapture of the castle, its beauty and decay, seemed to hum in time with his heartbeat. <words>13</words>  
He wondered if the cycle of violence was a seed too, one he could finally bury. <words>12</words>  
The next morning, the first green shoot pierced the soil, fragile and defiant. <words>11</words>  
He smiled, the first time in years, and for a moment, the spectacles didn’t feel like a burden. <words>13</words>  
The castle, with its ancient stones and whispered secrets, had given him a chance to gather what he’d lost. <words>14</words>  
He didn’t know if the seed would grow, but he’d stopped running, and that, he thought, was enough. <words>14</words>  
The rains came again, washing the mud from his boots, and the world felt a little less broken. <words>12</words>
