<story>  
The tavern-hand, Jax, scrubbed the last of the ale stains from the counter, his calloused fingers brushing against the collection of broken seashells he’d hoarded over years. <words>20</words>  
The vacuum chamber garden outside his window pulsed with bioluminescent ferns, their roots tangled in the fossilized footprints of a dried-up riverbed. <words>25</words>  
While the sands of time flowed backward, Jax’s job was to keep the garden’s atmosphere stable, a task he’d long considered a joke. <words>30</words>  
But the footprints had started to shift, their grooves rearranging themselves in patterns that defied logic. <words>35</words>  
“Predictably unpredictable,” Jax muttered, tossing a seashell into the air. <words>40</words>  
The shell shattered against the glass, its fragments scattering like stars. <words>44</words>  
He’d heard the old tales—how the riverbed’s footprints could randomize reality, if you dared to follow them. <words>49</words>  
Jax had never believed in inescapable callings, but the footprints hummed in his bones, a low, persistent ache. <words>54</words>  
He slipped into the garden, the vacuum’s hum a constant companion as he traced the shifting prints. <words>59</words>  
The air tasted metallic, like rust and forgotten dreams. <words>63</words>  
Each step backward in time left him more disoriented, yet the footprints guided him, their logic a riddle he couldn’t solve. <words>68</words>  
A seashell clinked at his hip, its jagged edges catching the dim light. <words>73</words>  
Jax wondered if the collection was a key, or just a relic of his own stubbornness. <words>78</words>  
The riverbed’s footprints widened, revealing a path that twisted into the garden’s core. <words>83</words>  
There, a vortex of light pulsed, its center a void that seemed to swallow the air. <words>88</words>  
“Catapult imagination beyond known realms,” Jax read from a faded plaque, his voice dry. <words>93</words>  
He dropped the seashells into the vortex, their shards dissolving into the light. <words>98</words>  
The garden shuddered, and time reversed fully, the ferns recoiling as if in fear. <words>103</words>  
Jax’s laughter echoed, a sound both defiant and hollow. <words>107</words>  
The footprints vanished, replaced by a mirror of the garden, now pristine and untouched. <words>112</words>  
He’d done it—randomized the impossible, if only for a moment. <words>117</words>  
But the vacuum chamber’s lights flickered, and the air grew heavy with the weight of what he’d unleashed. <words>122</words>  
Jax turned back, the garden’s silence pressing against his ribs. <words>126</words>  
The seashells were gone, but their absence felt like a promise. <words>131</words>  
He’d always been a man of small, scrappy choices, but this—this was a calling he couldn’t ignore. <words>136</words>  
The sands of time still flowed backward, but Jax walked forward, his steps steady, his heart a mix of flippant solemnity. <words>141</words>  
The garden’s edge shimmered, and he knew the footprints would return, waiting for the next fool to follow. <words>146</words>  
He smiled, a ghost of a grin, and vanished into the light. <words>150</words>
