<story>  
In the arctic research greenhouse, where frost clung to glass and the air hummed with sterile silence, old-fashioned mage Thaddeus wandered, his purposefully aimless steps tracing the edges of a forgotten riddle. <words>25</words>  
The fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, hidden in his coat, pulsed faintly, as if alive, its hieroglyphs whispering secrets only he could decipher. <words>25</words>  
Amid playground time, when the greenhouse’s automated systems mimicked the chaos of a child’s laughter, Thaddeus paused before a mirror, its surface rippling like water. <words>25</words>  
Through ephemeral encounters with his own reflection, he sought answers, though the riddle’s threads unraveled faster than he could grasp them. <words>25</words>  
A sudden chill gripped him, and the mirror showed not his face, but a desert tomb, its walls etched with the same hieroglyphs as the coffin fragment. <words>25</words>  
He reached out, fingers brushing the glass, and the world shuddered—a flicker of sand, a shadow of a pharaoh’s crown, then silence. <words>25</words>  
The greenhouse’s lights dimmed, casting the room in a spectral glow, as if the air itself held its breath. <words>25</words>  
Thaddeus’s heart pounded, not from fear, but from the weight of a purpose he could not name, a frontier he yearned to claim. <words>25</words>  
He cuddled the coffin fragment closer, its coldness a balm against the sanctified dread coiling in his chest. <words>25</words>  
The mirrors around him multiplied, each reflecting a different version of himself—some ancient, some monstrous, all watching. <words>25</words>  
A voice, neither his nor the pharaoh’s, echoed in the greenhouse: *“To claim the frontier, you must first surrender the self.”* <words>25</words>  
Thaddeus laughed, a sound like wind through ice, and stepped into the largest mirror, its surface rippling like a pond. <words>25</words>  
The greenhouse dissolved, replaced by a vast, sun-scorched expanse where the pharaoh’s tomb loomed, its doors sealed with a riddle only he could solve. <words>25</words>  
He knelt, the fragment glowing in his palm, and whispered the words that had haunted him since childhood: *“I am the path, not the end.”* <words>25</words>  
The tomb shuddered, its doors groaning open, revealing a chamber where time itself seemed to fold. <words>25</words>  
Thaddeus stepped forward, the weight of the frontier pressing against his ribs, and the mirrors behind him shattered, scattering light like stars. <words>25</words>  
In that moment, he understood: the riddle was never about the pharaoh, but the mage’s own unraveling. <words>25</words>  
The greenhouse, the mirrors, the fragment—all had been reflections of his soul, and now, he was the frontier. <words>25</words>  
As the tomb’s doors closed behind him, a single mirror remained, its surface still, reflecting a child’s laughter and the first snow of spring. <words>25</words>  
Thaddeus smiled, the sanctified dread now a part of him, and stepped into the unknown, his purpose no longer aimless. <words>25</words>
