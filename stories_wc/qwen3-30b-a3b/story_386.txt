<story>  
In the hush of a line that never moves, the time refugee from a forgotten empire stood beneath the atom-powered lighthouse, its glow a borrowed dawn. <words>20</words>  
The embroidered tablecloth, a relic of their lost homeland, hung in the air like a silent plea. <words>15</words>  
Its threads shimmered with constellations, each stitch a map to a past they could not reclaim. <words>14</words>  
The refugee, trustworthy strange, traced the patterns with a calloused finger, their eyes reflecting the lighthouse’s flickering light. <words>18</words>  
By the alignment of the stars, they had learned to navigate the fractures in time, though the empire’s ghosts still whispered in their ears. <words>20</words>  
The catapult, a rusted contraption buried in the lighthouse’s core, was their only hope to bind old wounds with unstoppable will. <words>19</words>  
Its mechanism, a relic of the empire’s final folly, required the precise geometry of celestial bodies to activate. <words>16</words>  
The refugee’s hands trembled as they adjusted the gears, their breath shallow in the stale air. <words>14</words>  
The tablecloth’s embroidery glowed faintly, as if the stars themselves had stitched it into existence. <words>15</words>  
They had no allies, only the weight of a thousand unspoken regrets and the lighthouse’s hum, a sound like a dying heartbeat. <words>17</words>  
The timeframe was a paradox: a moment suspended between collapse and rebirth, where the line that never moved could finally shift. <words>16</words>  
With a whispered prayer, they aligned the tablecloth’s constellations to the lighthouse’s core, the stars’ alignment a fragile promise. <words>19</words>  
The catapult groaned, its gears grinding against centuries of neglect, as the lighthouse’s atom-powered heart pulsed. <words>17</words>  
A surge of light erupted, illuminating the refugee’s face—etched with defiance, yet softened by the borrowed dawn. <words>17</words>  
The air thickened, the line that never moved trembling, as if the universe itself held its breath. <words>14</words>  
In that instant, the refugee saw their empire’s fall, the tablecloth’s stitches unraveling into a tapestry of healing. <words>16</words>  
They leapt, the catapult’s force hurling them into the void, where time fractured and reformed. <words>14</words>  
The lighthouse dimmed, its purpose fulfilled, as the refugee’s quiet defiance echoed through the void. <words>14</words>  
In the hush of a line that never moves, the stars blinked, their light a testament to the unyielding will of the forgotten. <words>16</words>  
The tablecloth, now a thread in the cosmos, whispered of a home that might yet be rebuilt. <words>14</words>  
The refugee, trustworthy strange, became a legend—a ghost of the empire, forever bound to the borrowed dawn. <words>16</words>  
Their story, a quiet rebellion, lingered in the lighthouse’s silence, a beacon for those who dared to defy time. <words>16</words>  
The line that never moved, once still, now trembled with the weight of possibility. <words>13</words>  
And in the borrowed dawn, the refugee’s will burned brighter than the atom-powered lighthouse’s final spark. <words>15</words>
