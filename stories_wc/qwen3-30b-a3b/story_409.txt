The bruised fighter climbed the creaking stairs, his knuckles raw from the last fight. <words>10</words> The attic reeked of dust and forgotten time, its shelves cluttered with clockwork animals, their gears frozen mid-motion. <words>20</words> He paused, eyeing a clay pot shard half-buried in a pile of broken trinkets. <words>28</words> Its surface bore an inscription, faint but deliberate, etched in a language he didn’t recognize. <words>37</words> The air thickened, as if the attic itself held its breath. <words>43</words>  

He traced the inscription, and the world blurred. <words>48</words> A sculptor’s chisel struck marble, the sound echoing in his skull. <words>56</words> The attic dissolved, replaced by a sunlit studio where a figure chiseled a statue, its face eerily familiar. <words>66</words> The fighter’s breath caught—this was his own face, frozen in the marble. <words>74</words> The sculptor turned, eyes hollow, and whispered, “You’re still pretending.” <words>82</words>  

The dream fractured. <words>85</words> He stood in the attic again, the shard burning in his palm. <words>91</words> The clockwork animals twitched, gears groaning as they reanimated, their tiny eyes glowing. <words>100</words> A mechanical mouse scurried past, its tail a coiled spring. <words>106</words> He stumbled back, but the attic’s walls pulsed, closing in. <words>113</words>  

“Stop running,” a voice hissed. <words>118</words> The fighter spun, finding no one. <words>122</words> The shard’s inscription flared, revealing a single word: *stand*. <words>130</words> He laughed, bitter. <words>133</words> “I’ve been standing for years,” he muttered. <words>139</words> The clockwork animals froze, their gears grinding to a halt. <words>146</words>  

A shadow moved in the corner. <words>150</words> A figure emerged, cloaked in dust, its face obscured. <words>157</words> “You abduct the truth,” the figure said, voice like rusted metal. <words>164</words> The fighter’s hand tightened on the shard. <words>169</words> “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” <words>175</words>  

The figure extended a hand. <words>179</words> “The last vestige of self-deception is here.” <words>186</words> The attic trembled, and the sculptor’s chisel struck marble again, this time shattering the statue. <words>195</words> The fighter’s reflection crumbled, revealing a younger version of himself, trembling in a ring. <words>204</words>  

“Skillfully incompetent,” the figure said, “but still fighting.” <words>211</words> The fighter’s jaw clenched. <words>215</words> “I’m not a joke.” <words>218</words>  

The shard slipped from his hand, embedding in the floor. <words>224</words> The attic’s clockwork animals whirred to life, their movements synchronized, mechanical yet graceful. <words>233</words> The figure faded, leaving only the inscription glowing faintly. <words>240</words>  

He knelt, brushing dust from the shard. <words>245</words> “Standing for something,” he whispered, “even if it’s just me.” <words>253</words> The attic’s walls softened, the clockwork animals pausing mid-twitch. <words>260</words>  

At the moment the sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, the fighter stood, unbroken. <words>269</words> The shard’s inscription faded, but its meaning remained. <words>275</words> He turned, the attic’s dust swirling like a memory. <words>281</words>  

The clockwork animals clicked, their gears aligning in a silent salute. <words>288</words> He walked out, the weight of the shard now a part of him. <words>294</words> The attic’s door creaked shut, sealing the forgotten dreams. <words>300</words>  

The fighter’s steps echoed, steady, deliberate. <words>306</words> He had no more fights to win, only a truth to carry. <words>312</words> The world outside was brighter, the air thinner, but he moved forward. <words>319</words>  

The shard’s inscription, now a whisper, echoed in his mind: *stand*. <words>326</words> He did. <words>328</words>
