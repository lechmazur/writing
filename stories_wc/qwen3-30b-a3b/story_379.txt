Elias Vane crouched in the shadow of the biodome’s hydroponic towers, the leftover gift tag clutched in his fist like a cursed talisman. <words>30</words>  
The tag, still bearing the faded ink of a name he’d long forgotten, had been tucked inside a stolen data chip—a relic from a case he’d closed years ago. <words>45</words>  
Now, it was a cipher, a ghostly whisper from the past that refused to let him rest. <words>55</words>  
The biodome’s artificial sun stretched across the horizon, its light dimmed by the perpetual haze of the planet’s dying atmosphere. <words>68</words>  
Elias had chosen this place to outrun the law, but the dares from his old high school rivals had followed him like a shadow. <words>81</words>  
Each challenge was a riddle, a test of wit and nerve, designed to divert him from his true purpose: cataloging the last remnants of dying languages. <words>97</words>  
His “impatiently patient” nature had always been his greatest asset and his worst curse—waiting for the right moment to strike, yet never allowing time to waste. <words>113</words>  
The first dare had been simple: “Find the key to the vault beneath the wheat fields.” <words>122</words>  
He’d dug through the soil, fingers bleeding, until he uncovered a rusted terminal. <words>131</words>  
The second dare had been a riddle: “What is lost but never found?” <words>139</words>  
He’d answered “a language,” and the biodome’s systems had flickered, as if the planet itself had heard. <words>150</words>  
Now, the third dare was etched into the gift tag: “Choose your path—truth or oblivion.” <words>160</words>  
Elias stared at the words, the weight of his choices pressing against his ribs. <words>168</words>  
The law was closing in, but so was the truth. <words>174</words>  
He’d spent years evading capture, but the dares had forced him to confront the ghosts of his past—the lies he’d told, the lives he’d ruined. <words>189</words>  
The biodome’s stretching framework groaned as the planet’s core shifted, a reminder that nothing was permanent. <words>201</words>  
He thought of the languages he’d saved, the voices that had once filled the air like a symphony. <words>211</words>  
Now, they were whispers, fading into the void. <words>217</words>  
The gift tag fluttered in his hand, its edges frayed by time. <words>224</words>  
He had to choose. <words>227</words>  
To divert the law, he’d have to surrender the data he’d collected, or risk losing it all. <words>237</words>  
But the dares had taught him that every path led somewhere. <words>244</words>  
He pressed the tag against the terminal, and the biodome’s lights flared to life. <words>253</words>  
A voice, hollow and ancient, echoed through the chamber: “You have chosen.” <words>262</words>  
The ground trembled as the vault opened, revealing a cache of encrypted files. <words>271</words>  
Elias knew the law would come for him, but for the first time, he felt the ghostly resolve of a man who’d made his peace. <words>285</words>  
He’d chosen his path, and it was enough. <words>291</words>
