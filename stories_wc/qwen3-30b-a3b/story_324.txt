Elias, the insecure advisor, traced his fingers over the cold metal of the secret agent headquarters’ rusted door, its hinges groaning like a dying man. <words>15</words> The air smelled of dust and forgotten protocols, a place where time had pooled in stagnant puddles. <words>23</words> His mission was to find the brain in a jar, labeled “duplicate,” a relic from a failed experiment that had haunted his dreams for weeks. <words>35</words> The rumor had been a whisper in the hush of a simmering future: a dreamer’s calling, a key to something beyond reason. <words>47</words> He had no proof, only the echo of footsteps in the abandoned corridors, a sound that never quite matched his own. <words>58</words>  

The brain pulsed faintly in its glass prison, a grotesque heartbeat that mirrored his own. <words>66</words> “Duplicate,” he muttered, the word tasting like ash. <words>71</words> Was it a copy of a mind, or a lie? <words>76</words> The core concept of the dreamer’s calling had always been ambiguous, a riddle wrapped in a cipher. <words>86</words> Elias had spent years decoding it, chasing shadows through the fractured idyll of his own doubts. <words>96</words> Now, the jar’s label felt like a taunt, a challenge to his fragile sense of purpose. <words>106</words>  

He jabbed a finger at the glass, a childish act of defiance. <words>113</words> The brain shuddered, its surface rippling like disturbed water. <words>119</words> A voice, not his own, echoed in his skull: *“You are not the first.”* <words>127</words> The headquarters trembled, its walls groaning as if the building itself remembered. <words>135</words> Elias staggered, the weight of the rumor pressing against his ribs. <words>142</words> He had always been a spectator, a man who second-guessed every step, but this—this was a call he couldn’t ignore. <words>153</words>  

The footsteps returned, louder now, a rhythm that didn’t belong to him. <words>161</words> He followed them, his breath shallow, until he reached a sealed chamber. <words>168</words> Inside, a dozen jars lined the walls, each labeled “duplicate.” <words>175</words> The dreamer’s calling wasn’t a single truth—it was a chorus of echoes, a labyrinth of possibilities. <words>185</words> Elias’s hands trembled. <words>189</words> Was he the original, or the copy? <words>194</words> The question clawed at his mind, a fracture in the idyll of his identity. <words>202</words>  

He reached for the nearest jar, but the footsteps stopped. <words>209</words> A shadow moved in the corner of his eye. <words>214</words> The headquarters had never been empty. <words>219</words> The dreamer’s calling wasn’t a destination—it was a mirror, reflecting the choices he had yet to make. <words>229</words> Elias stood at the edge of the unknown, his insecurity a shield and a shackle. <words>238</words> The brain in the jar was no longer a mystery; it was a question. <words>246</words> And he, the insecure advisor, was the only one who could answer. <words>254</words>  

The echo of footsteps returned, closer this time. <words>261</words> Elias turned, his heart a drum in the silence. <words>267</words> The dreamer’s calling was not a path, but a choice. <words>275</words> And he would choose, even if the answer was a lie. <words>283</words>
