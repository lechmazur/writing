The lapsed priest jogged through the labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks, their tops brushing the clouds, as if the world had forgotten to close its mouth. <words>20</words>  
The abacus, its wooden frame cracked and beads missing, hung from his belt, a relic of a life he’d abandoned. <words>22</words>  
He was unapologetically confused, his mind a fog of half-remembered prayers and the weight of choices left unmade. <words>24</words>  
The snow patterns, delicate and shifting, guided his steps, though he couldn’t recall how he’d learned to read them. <words>26</words>  
Through the hush of fate unraveling, the orchard pulsed with a dull radiance, as if the sky itself had dimmed to a whisper. <words>28</words>  
He’d come to confront the price of complacency, a debt he’d ignored for decades, now etched into the grooves of his hands. <words>30</words>  
The bean stalks twisted like cathedral spires, their leaves trembling with a silence that felt both sacred and sinister. <words>32</words>  
Each bead he’d lost on the abacus had been a moment of inaction—a sermon unspoken, a soul unaided, a life unchosen. <words>34</words>  
The snow patterns led him deeper, where the stalks grew denser, their shadows pooling like ink in a forgotten ledger. <words>36</words>  
He stumbled over roots, his breath ragged, yet the orchard seemed to lean in, as if it, too, waited for his answer. <words>38</words>  
The price of complacency, he realized, was not a single sin but a thousand small betrayals, each one a missing bead. <words>40</words>  
A gust of wind carried the scent of damp earth and something sweet, like overripe beans, and he wondered if it was hope. <words>42</words>  
The abacus jingled as he ran, its hollows aching with absence, a reminder of the lives he’d let slip through his fingers. <words>44</words>  
He’d once believed faith was a fortress, but now it felt like a crumbling bridge, and he was the only one crossing. <words>46</words>  
The snow patterns shifted again, this time forming a spiral, and he followed, though the path was a question without a word. <words>48</words>  
The orchard’s dull radiance deepened, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch toward him, pleading or warning. <words>50</words>  
He thought of the people he’d failed—parishioners, strangers, even himself—and the weight of their unspoken needs. <words>52</words>  
The abacus’s missing beads were not lost; they were waiting, buried in the soil of his choices, ready to be unearthed. <words>54</words>  
He slowed, his feet sinking into the snow, and for the first time, the orchard felt less like a prison and more like a mirror. <words>56</words>  
The price of complacency, he understood, was not a punishment but a call—a chance to step beyond fate’s design. <words>58</words>  
He knelt, brushing snow from the ground, and began to dig, not for redemption, but for the courage to start again. <words>60</words>  
The orchard held its breath, the bean stalks swaying in a rhythm that might have been a hymn or a lullaby. <words>62</words>  
And as the first bead of the abacus slipped into his palm, he felt the hush of fate unraveling, not as a loss, but as a beginning. <words>64</words>
