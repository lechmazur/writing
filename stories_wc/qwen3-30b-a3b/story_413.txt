The listless noble, Lord Cedric, wandered the endless corn maze, his faded scarf trailing like a ghost of better days. <words>10</words> The haunted plain stretched endlessly, its stalks whispering secrets only the wind could decipher. <words>16</words> He had received an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event—a rendezvous with no details, only a cryptic note tucked into his coat. <words>27</words> Naively sophisticated, he believed the note was a jest, yet the weight of the scarf in his hand hinted at something deeper. <words>37</words> As he ventured deeper, the maze seemed to shift, its paths folding in on themselves like a riddle with no answer. <words>45</words> A sudden burst of shared laughter echoed ahead, sharp and bright, cutting through the oppressive silence. <words>53</words> Cedric froze, his heart a drumbeat against the corn’s rustling. <words>57</words> The laughter belonged to a stranger—a woman in a tattered gown, her eyes alight with a naively sophisticated joy. <words>66</words> “You’re late,” she said, as if they’d agreed on this meeting centuries ago. <words>71</words> He stammered, clutching his scarf, its faded threads a testament to a life he’d long abandoned. <words>78</words> “I didn’t know this place had a soul,” he admitted, gesturing to the maze. <words>84</words> She laughed again, a sound like wind chimes, and gestured to the corn. <words>89</words> “It’s not the maze that has a soul—it’s the intention you bring to it.” <words>95</words> Cedric blinked, the words threading through his listless thoughts like a needle. <words>101</words> Before the first creature developed sentience, the plain had been a canvas, and now, here he was, painting it with his own. <words>111</words> The woman extended a hand, her fingers stained with something that might have been ink or blood. <words>117</words> “Come,” she said, “the power of intention isn’t in the destination, but the act of choosing.” <words>124</words> He hesitated, the scarf’s weight a reminder of all he’d ignored. <words>129</words> But the laughter, the strange pull of the moment, and the maze’s eerie stillness urged him forward. <words>137</words> As they walked, the corn seemed to part, revealing a clearing where the air shimmered like a mirage. <words>144</words> “This is where the maze bends,” the woman said, her voice a mix of wonder and warning. <words>150</words> Cedric felt the scarf tighten around his neck, as if the past itself were holding him back. <words>156</words> “What if I’m not meant to find the power of intention?” he asked, the question laced with irony. <words>163</words> She smiled, a flicker of something ancient in her eyes. <words>167</words> “Then you’ll never know what you’re missing.” <words>171</words> The maze closed behind them, the corn whispering tales of those who had come before. <words>177</words> Cedric’s laughter joined hers, a sound of ironic awe, as the plain’s secrets began to unfurl. <words>185</words> In that moment, the faded scarf felt less like a relic and more like a compass, guiding him toward a truth he’d never dared to seek. <words>195</words> The corn maze, endless and haunted, had given him a choice—and for the first time, he was ready to make it. <words>203</words>
