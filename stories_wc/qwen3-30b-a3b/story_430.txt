The reaver moved through Kaleidoscope Park, a shadow among the fractured light of the carousel’s spinning mirrors, their coat stitched with the ghosts of stolen glances. <words>20</words>  
A crumpled paper, yellowed and frayed, caught their boot—child’s drawing, a sun with fangs and a moon that wept stars. <words>34</words>  
The reaver scoffed, but the paper’s edges trembled, as if the child’s hand had been too small to hold the weight of its own creation. <words>48</words>  
They unfolded it, revealing scrawled poems in the margins, each line a nagging whisper: *“The stars are not for taking, but for tasting in a kiss.”* <words>64</words>  
The reaver’s jaw tightened. Generational patterns, they thought, were chains, not constellations. <words>75</words>  
Yet the drawing’s charm was grotesque—its grotesque charm, a paradox that pricked their ribs like a thorn. <words>87</words>  
They pocketed it, the paper’s edges digging into their palm, a reminder of the first lie they’d ever told: *“I don’t care.”* <words>100</words>  
At dusk, the reaver returned to the park, the poems now a chorus in their mind, each verse a thorn in their pride. <words>113</words>  
The child’s drawing, they realized, was a map—a path through the park’s kaleidoscopic chaos, where every reflection hid a truth. <words>127</words>  
They followed it, the poems guiding them to a bench where a girl sat, her face a mosaic of scars and laughter. <words>140</words>  
“Why do you take things?” she asked, her voice a melody of defiance. <words>150</words>  
The reaver’s tongue was a blade, but the girl’s eyes held the stars they’d longed to taste. <words>161</words>  
“Because,” they muttered, “the first lie is the hardest to unmake.” <words>171</words>  
The girl smiled, a gesture both mocking and tender. “Then let’s make a new one.” <words>182</words>  
She pressed a crumpled paper into their hand—another drawing, this one of a reaver with wings, their face softened by the light of a kiss. <words>196</words>  
The reaver’s breath hitched. The poems in the margins now read: *“The stars are not for taking, but for sharing in a lie.”* <words>210</words>  
They stared at the girl, her scars a testament to the patterns she’d broken, and felt the weight of their own. <words>223</words>  
“Why this?” they asked, the question a crack in their armor. <words>231</words>  
“Because,” she said, “you’re not a monster. You’re just afraid of the stars.” <words>242</words>  
The reaver’s laugh was a dry, bitter thing, but it carried the scent of something new—something like hope. <words>254</words>  
They left the park that night, the drawings tucked into their coat, the poems now a lullaby of possibility. <words>267</words>  
The first lie, they thought, was the one they’d told themselves. <words>276</words>  
And the stars, they realized, were not in the sky, but in the cracks where the light could still reach. <words>289</words>  
The reaver walked on, their steps lighter, the weight of generational chains replaced by the fragile, grotesque beauty of a child’s hand. <words>303</words>  
They would not take. They would not lie. <words>311</words>  
They would taste the stars, one kiss at a time. <words>319</words>
