The unruly alchemist adjusted the cracked magnifying glass, its warped lens catching the dim light of the shooting star tracking station. <words>20</words>  
Between innings of the silent, endless skywatch, they hummed the hum of an outdated overhead projector, its groan a lullaby for the stars. <words>30</words>  
The magnifying glass, a relic from a forgotten experiment, refracted the projector’s glow into fractured rainbows that danced across the station’s dusty walls. <words>40</words>  
To the cynics who scoffed at the “touched sky,” the alchemist’s antics were nonsense—yet their hauntingly cheerful grin never wavered. <words>50</words>  
“Watch,” they whispered, tilting the lens to focus the projector’s beam on a patch of cloudless night. <words>55</words>  
The light fractured, then coalesced into a shimmering, impossible shape: a shooting star, suspended in midair, its tail flickering like a held breath. <words>65</words>  
The station’s director, a man of rigid logic, froze. “How?” he asked, voice trembling. <words>70</words>  
The alchemist shrugged, their fingers tracing the cracked glass. “The sky isn’t touched—it’s *touched back*,” they said, as if the words were a spell. <words>80</words>  
The projector hummed louder, its vibrations syncing with the alchemist’s heartbeat. <words>85</words>  
Outside, a real star streaked across the heavens, and for a moment, the station’s walls seemed to pulse with the same infinite caution as the cosmos. <words>95</words>  
The director’s skepticism crumbled like ash. “It’s… beautiful,” he admitted, eyes wide. <words>100</words>  
The alchemist’s laugh was a bell in the dark, sharp and bright. “Of course it is. You just forgot to look.” <words>110</words>  
They pressed the magnifying glass to the window, letting the star’s light seep through the cracks, painting the room with a mosaic of hope. <words>120</words>  
The station, once a tomb of data and doubt, now thrummed with the hum of possibility. <words>125</words>  
The alchemist’s hands, stained with soot and stardust, moved like a conductor’s. “Cynicism is a closed door,” they said. “I’m just… opening it.” <words>135</words>  
The director, trembling, reached out. His fingers brushed the light, and for the first time in years, he felt the sky’s touch in his bones. <words>145</words>  
The projector’s hum faded, replaced by the sound of a thousand silent, grateful breaths. <words>150</words>  
The alchemist’s grin widened, a beacon in the gloom. “Playful wonder? It’s the only thing that disarms the dark.” <words>160</words>  
They adjusted the lens again, this time letting the light spill into the void, a promise that the sky would always answer if you dared to ask. <words>170</words>  
The station, once a place of cold calculations, now held a secret: the touched sky was not a myth, but a mirror. <words>180</words>  
And the alchemist, with their cracked glass and reckless joy, had become the bridge between the two. <words>190</words>  
The director, now a believer, whispered, “How do you do it?” <words>195</words>  
The alchemist’s eyes gleamed, haunted yet bright. “I don’t *do* it. I *am* it.” <words>205</words>  
The stars, ever patient, waited for the next touch. <words>210</words>
