<story>  
The dejected knight drifted through the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor clanking like a forgotten hymn. <words>20</words>  
Above, the old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour—three in the afternoon, its hands spinning backward. <words>21</words>  
He clutched the trident prong from a sunken realm, its jagged edge glowing faintly, as if it remembered the sea’s breath. <words>25</words>  
The dance hall’s walls pulsed with bioluminescent patterns, a sacred disorder of shifting constellations and fractured mirrors. <words>25</words>  
His mission was to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, a promise to the drowned kingdom he’d failed to save. <words>24</words>  
The trident prong, normally abnormal, hummed with a rhythm that quickened his pulse, urging him toward the forgotten paths. <words>25</words>  
Through the labyrinth of floating chandeliers and inverted staircases, he navigated the zero-gravity dance hall’s chaos. <words>24</words>  
Each step felt like a rebellion against the weight of his guilt, the prong’s glow deepening as he neared the heart of the realm. <words>24</words>  
The clock’s chimes echoed, a dissonant melody that fractured time, revealing hidden corridors where the sunken realm’s secrets lay. <words>24</words>  
He stumbled into a chamber where the walls were made of liquid starlight, and the air tasted of salt and forgotten oaths. <words>23</words>  
The trident prong trembled, its tip piercing the starlight, and the room shuddered as if the cosmos itself had paused. <words>23</words>  
A voice, neither male nor female, whispered through the void: “What is your vow, knight of the drowned?” <words>21</words>  
He knelt, the prong’s glow intensifying, and spoke the words he’d carried for decades—of honor, of loss, of a kingdom’s last breath. <words>24</words>  
The starlight rippled, and the dance hall’s chaos coalesced into a bridge of light, leading to a horizon that stretched beyond the known. <words>24</words>  
The clock’s hands froze, and the knight’s armor dissolved into motes of light, his form merging with the deepening horizons. <words>23</words>  
The trident prong, now a beacon, floated beside him, its abnormal glow a testament to the sacred disorder he’d embraced. <words>23</words>  
In that moment, the knight was no longer a man, but a legend woven into the fabric of the sunken realm’s eternal dance. <words>23</words>  
The zero-gravity hall faded, replaced by a void where time and space bent to the rhythm of his vow. <words>22</words>  
He had quickened the path, not to escape his past, but to let it echo through the stars, unbound and eternal. <words>22</words>  
The watchtower’s clock ticked forward, its hands now aligned with the new hour, as if the realm itself had been reborn. <words>22</words>  
The knight’s journey was not an end, but a beginning—a testament to the power of a silent vow, now sung through the cosmos. <words>23</words>  
In the sacred disorder of the dance hall, he found his purpose: to be both the wound and the healing, the silence and the song. <words>23</words>  
The trident prong, once a fragment of a lost kingdom, now pulsed with the heartbeat of a new horizon, uncharted and infinite. <words>23</words>  
And as the zero-gravity hall dissolved into stardust, the knight’s voice lingered, a vow that would never fade. <words>22</words>
