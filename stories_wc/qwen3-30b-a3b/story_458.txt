Elara’s boots echoed through the abandoned spaceport baggage claim, where the flying library’s hull groaned like a dying beast. <words>10</words>  
She clutched the detached coat button in her palm, its silver thread frayed, a relic from a passenger who’d vanished decades ago. <words>15</words>  
The library’s core concept—bridge to unity—had once been a promise, but now it was a whisper in the static of her comms. <words>21</words>  
Her motivation was simple: to preserve a fading tradition, though the weight of it felt like a noose around her throat. <words>27</words>  
The spiritually secular pilot had no faith in gods, only in the stories she carried, each one a fragile thread in the tapestry of human connection. <words>35</words>  
She’d learned to read the future in coffee stains, a method as absurd as it was precise, the dark splotches on her mug revealing paths she could never unsee. <words>45</words>  
Today, the stains showed a choice: obliterate the library’s archives or let them decay into dust. <words>50</words>  
The timeframe was a second, a heartbeat, where a yes or no could unravel everything. <words>55</words>  
The baggage claim’s flickering lights cast shadows that mimicked the fractal sorrow in her chest, a grief that nested in every corner of her being. <words>65</words>  
She traced the coat button’s edge, wondering if it had belonged to the last passenger who’d believed in the bridge to unity. <words>72</words>  
The library’s engines hummed faintly, a sound that once felt like hope, now a reminder of how quickly beauty could turn to rust. <words>80</words>  
Her fingers trembled as she poured coffee, the liquid pooling into a shape that mirrored the button’s silhouette. <words>86</words>  
The stain spread, revealing a vision: the archives burning, the bridge collapsing, the world forgetting. <words>92</words>  
A single yes would mean surrender, a no would mean defiance, but both paths were carved in the same sorrow. <words>99</words>  
She thought of the passengers who’d once filled the library’s halls, their laughter echoing through the corridors like a ghost. <words>107</words>  
The spiritually secular part of her whispered that stories were all that remained when gods and machines failed. <words>114</words>  
But the bridge to unity was a lie, a fragile illusion she’d clung to, even as it crumbled. <words>120</words>  
The coat button slipped from her hand, landing near the coffee stain, its silver glinting like a final clue. <words>127</words>  
She closed her eyes, the weight of the second pressing down, and made her choice. <words>132</words>  
The library’s systems shuddered, the archives sealing themselves in a final act of preservation. <words>138</words>  
Elara stood alone, the baggage claim silent, the bridge to unity now a memory she’d etched into the stars. <words>146</words>  
The coffee stain faded, the button forgotten, but the sorrow remained—a fractal, infinite, and unbroken. <words>153</words>
