<story>  
The daring pathfinder traced the ink-stained pages of the haunted inn’s housekeeping logs, their fingers smudged with dust and secrets. <words>20</words>  
Each entry whispered of a doorknob that never turned, its brass surface etched with a riddle older than time. <words>25</words>  
The antique doorknob, found in a hollowed-out wall, was the last fragment of a forgotten mechanism. <words>30</words>  
Its edges had eroded, as if the passage of centuries had gnawed at its purpose. <words>35</words>  
The pathfinder, ingeniously clueless, believed the logs held the key to a mystery that defied logic. <words>40</words>  
They followed the trail of faded ink to an abandoned roller coaster track, its rusted rails coiled like a serpent. <words>45</words>  
Amid page turns, the logs revealed a pattern: the doorknob’s riddle was tied to the coaster’s final ride. <words>50</words>  
The pathfinder climbed the skeletal structure, their boots crunching on brittle wood, as the wind howled like a trapped soul. <words>55</words>  
At the highest peak, they found a rusted lever, its handle shaped like the doorknob’s twin. <words>60</words>  
The riddle, etched in a language that dissolved on the tongue, demanded a sacrifice of memory. <words>65</words>  
The pathfinder hesitated, their mind a storm of quiet mania, but the logs had already bound them. <words>70</words>  
They inserted the doorknob, and the coaster groaned to life, its tracks glowing with a sickly light. <words>75</words>  
The air thickened as the ride descended, the pathfinder’s breath syncing with the creak of ancient metal. <words>80</words>  
At the bottom, a door materialized, its frame humming with the weight of forgotten truths. <words>85</words>  
The pathfinder turned the doorknob, and the world fractured—time, space, and the riddle’s answer collapsing into a single, silent scream. <words>90</words>  
The logs, now blank, fluttered to the ground as the coaster dissolved into mist. <words>95</words>  
The pathfinder stood alone, their hands empty, the doorknob’s purpose erased by the very act of solving it. <words>100</words>  
Yet, in the quiet mania of their triumph, they knew the riddle had never been about the answer. <words>105</words>  
It had been about the journey, the eroded edges of curiosity, and the fragments that bind us to the unknown. <words>110</words>  
The abandoned track creaked, a final whisper of the last fragment’s legacy. <words>115</words>  
The pathfinder walked away, their heart a map of uncharted territories, the logs forever a mystery. <words>120</words>  
The coaster’s ghost lingered, a testament to the riddle’s enduring grip on the world. <words>125</words>  
And somewhere, the doorknob’s echo hummed, a reminder that some truths are meant to be found, not kept. <words>130</words>  
The pathfinder’s story, like the logs, would fade—until the next page turned. <words>135</words>
