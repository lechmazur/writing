<story>  
The pleasant meddler, a janitor with a penchant for secrets, moved through the obsidian skyscraper’s hospital ward, where the silence before sunrise felt like a held breath. <words>20</words>  
Their hands clutched a pair of rusted ice skates, their blades dulled by time, yet the meddler’s grin remained sharp. <words>14</words>  
The hospital’s sterile corridors hummed with the faint static of machines, but the meddler’s focus was on the scattered seeds beneath their boots—tiny, black, and arranged in a pattern that defied logic. <words>23</words>  
They had spent weeks decoding the ancient symbols etched into the building’s glass walls, their motivation a mix of curiosity and a desire to weaken the hospital’s rigid order. <words>23</words>  
The method? A nighttime beach wanderer’s receding footprints, which the meddler had traced back to the skyscraper’s foundation, where the seeds seemed to bloom from cracks in the obsidian. <words>23</words>  
“Openly manipulative,” the meddler muttered, adjusting the skates’ straps as they glided past a sleeping patient, their breaths synchronized with the machines. <words>21</words>  
The seeds, they suspected, were a cipher—each one a key to a forgotten language buried in the skyscraper’s design. <words>13</words>  
But the meddler’s true aim was to weaken the hospital’s control, to let the chaos of the unknown seep into its sterile walls. <words>16</words>  
As dawn’s first light filtered through the glass, the meddler paused, their reflection fractured in the obsidian floor, a mosaic of doubt and determination. <words>18</words>  
They had seen the beach wanderer’s footprints before—faint, shifting, as if the sea itself had erased them—but now, the seeds pulsed with a strange vitality, as though the skyscraper were alive. <words>23</words>  
The meddler knelt, brushing the seeds with a gloved hand, and felt a tremor in the floor, a whisper of something ancient stirring. <words>16</words>  
Their pleasant demeanor faltered for a moment, a flicker of lucid confusion as the symbols on the walls seemed to shift, their meaning just out of reach. <words>20</words>  
Yet they pressed on, the ice skates clanking softly as they moved, a dance of defiance against the hospital’s silence. <words>15</words>  
The scattered seeds, they realized, were not just a code but a test—a way to weaken the skyscraper’s grip on reality, to let the past bleed into the present. <words>21</words>  
As the first rays of sunlight touched the obsidian, the meddler’s grin returned, brighter than before, as if the seeds had finally whispered their secret. <words>20</words>  
They had no idea what the symbols meant, but the act of decoding them, of weakening the hospital’s order, was enough. <words>16</words>  
The meddler stood, the skates gleaming in the dawn, and walked away, leaving the seeds to scatter further, a trail of possibility in a world of certainty. <words>20</words>  
The hospital’s silence remained, but the meddler’s laughter echoed, a note of lucid confusion in the quiet shift before sunrise. <words>18</words>
