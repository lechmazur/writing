<story>  
The bleak clown arrived at the floating rock yoga studio as the first train’s whistle pierced the dawn, its sound swallowed by the silence of the sky. <words>10</words>  
The studio, a jagged slab of stone adrift above a frozen lake, hummed with the weight of unspoken promises. <words>14</words>  
Inside, a clock hand spun endlessly, its metal edge glinting like a blade in the pale light. <words>18</words>  
The clown, draped in frayed red and white, traced the spinning hand with a gloved finger, its motion a taunt. <words>23</words>  
“Drifting promises,” they muttered, the phrase a mantra for the hollow ache in their chest. <words>27</words>  
The studio’s owner, a reclusive poet, had once claimed the clock was a relic of “technically absurd” timekeeping. <words>33</words>  
But the clown knew better—this was a prison, a cage of gears and lies. <words>37</words>  
Their motivation was simple: to outshine the northern lights with a grin, even if it meant dismantling illusions. <words>43</words>  
They had mastered the art of private poetry, scribbling verses in the margins of their despair. <words>47</words>  
Each line was a key, a way to crack the shell of the clock’s spinning tyranny. <words>51</words>  
The studio’s air smelled of incense and regret, a scent that clung to the clown’s breath. <words>55</words>  
They sat cross-legged on the rock, the clock’s hand a metronome of futility. <words>59</words>  
“Stop,” they whispered, the word a plea and a command. <words>63</words>  
The hand slowed, then stilled—only to resume its spin moments later, as if mocking their resolve. <words>69</words>  
The clown laughed, a jagged sound that echoed through the studio’s empty walls. <words>73</words>  
“Technically absurd,” they said, the phrase a shield against the ache of failure. <words>77</words>  
They opened their journal, its pages yellowed with the weight of unspoken truths. <words>81</words>  
“Promises are just clocks,” they wrote, “ticking away in the dark, never meant to be trusted.” <words>87</words>  
The clock hand shuddered, its spin faltering as the words took root. <words>91</words>  
The clown’s grin widened, a flicker of hope in their otherwise bleak face. <words>95</words>  
They tore the page from the journal, letting it drift toward the spinning hand. <words>99</words>  
The paper caught the clock’s edge, and for a heartbeat, the world held its breath. <words>103</words>  
Then, with a sound like a sigh, the hand stopped. <words>106</words>  
The studio trembled, the rock shuddering as if waking from a dream. <words>110</words>  
The clown stood, their shadow stretching across the floor like a promise kept. <words>114</words>  
The northern lights, visible through the studio’s open ceiling, flickered in response. <words>118</words>  
“Outshined,” the clown whispered, their grin now a beacon in the dawn. <words>122</words>  
The clock’s hand, now still, glowed faintly, a relic of the promises they’d unraveled. <words>127</words>  
The train’s whistle sounded again, a reminder that time, like the clown, was both prisoner and master. <words>133</words>  
They stepped onto the rock’s edge, the wind tugging at their frayed costume. <words>137</words>  
“Drifting promises,” they said, “are just clocks waiting to be broken.” <words>141</words>  
And with that, they vanished into the light, leaving only the silence of the studio and the stillness of the hand. <words>147</words>  
The northern lights pulsed, a final, fleeting applause. <words>150</words>  
The clown’s laughter lingered, a jagged note in the dawn’s quiet symphony. <words>154</words>
