<story>  
The sapped herbalist sat in the glass-walled observatory on an ocean cliff, her fingers tracing the rim of a blacksmith’s bellows, its iron ribs cold against her skin. <words>20</words>  
The bellows had no purpose here, yet she cherished it, a relic from a life she no longer remembered. <words>25</words>  
Her motivation was to study tide patterns, but the ocean’s rhythm had become a prison, its ebb and flow a cruel joke. <words>32</words>  
During napping, she dreamed of the flight path of a lone goose, its wings carving a silent map across the sky. <words>38</words>  
The goose’s path, she realized, mirrored the tides’ pulse, a secret code only the thoughtfully thoughtless could decipher. <words>46</words>  
She woke with a start, the bellows still in her grip, its weight a reminder of the price of perfection. <words>52</words>  
The observatory’s glass walls reflected the storm brewing beyond the cliff, but she remained motionless, her gaze fixed on the horizon. <words>59</words>  
Fervent indifference burned in her chest, a fire that neither the ocean’s roar nor the bellows’ silence could extinguish. <words>66</words>  
She had once believed knowledge was a cure, but now it felt like a chain, each tide’s whisper a link tightening around her throat. <words>74</words>  
The blacksmith’s bellows, rusted and useless, became her anchor, a symbol of the craft she had abandoned for the illusion of control. <words>82</words>  
By the flight path of the goose, she mapped the tides, her hands trembling as she etched their patterns into a journal. <words>89</words>  
The goose returned each dawn, its shadow a fleeting promise, and she wondered if it, too, was chasing something it could never grasp. <words>97</words>  
Her sapped energy was a curse and a gift, a hollowed-out shell that allowed her to see the world’s fractures with startling clarity. <words>105</words>  
The price of perfection, she understood, was not in the pursuit but in the silence that followed, the hollowing of every dream. <words>113</words>  
She cherished the bellows not for its function but for its defiance, a testament to the beauty of imperfection. <words>120</words>  
The ocean roared, and she laughed, a sound as sharp as the cliff’s edge, as if the wind itself had learned to mock her. <words>127</words>  
In the observatory’s stillness, she found a strange peace, her heart a clockwork of contradictions, ticking to a rhythm no one else could hear. <words>136</words>  
The goose vanished, and with it, the last thread of her certainty, leaving her to wander the edge of the cliff, a ghost in a world that had forgotten her. <words>145</words>  
She did not mourn; the price of perfection had already been paid in the quiet moments between breaths. <words>152</words>  
The bellows, now a part of her, hummed with the memory of a fire that had long since died, yet still, she pressed on, a sapped herbalist chasing tides that would never return. <words>162</words>
