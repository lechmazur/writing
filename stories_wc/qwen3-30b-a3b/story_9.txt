The soothsayer’s fingers trembled as they traced the water rings on the bar top, their reflection warped by the neon haze of the desert maze. <words>22</words>  
“Of course it’s a puzzle,” they muttered, voice dripping with molten sarcasm. “Why not a simple riddle when the planet’s on fire?” <words>34</words>  
The pocket puzzle box, its 13 locks glinting like stubborn teeth, pressed against their chest. It had been a gift—probably unlikely, they thought—from a stranger who claimed to be a “guardian of the forgotten.” <words>53</words>  
The desert’s billboards flickered, their slogans about “progress” and “growth” bleeding into the sandstorm. The soothsayer’s breath hitched; the air tasted of rust and regret. <words>68</words>  
They’d spent the “lost years” between here and nowhere, trying to magnify the whispers of the earth. The box’s locks were meant to be solved, but the soothsayer’s hands were too clumsy, their mind too fractured. <words>87</words>  
“Environmental stewardship,” they scoffed, “a noble lie. Who’s left to steward when the last tree’s a hologram?” <words>99</words>  
The bar top’s rings shifted, as if the wood itself were sighing. The soothsayer leaned closer, their reflection merging with the neon. The water rings formed a pattern—something like a map, or a warning. <words>117</words>  
The 13 locks clicked open one by one, each sound a tiny rebellion against the desert’s silence. The soothsayer’s panic surged; the box’s core glowed, revealing a seed—pale, fragile, and humming with potential. <words>136</words>  
“Bare hands,” they whispered, gripping the seed. “Of course. Because nothing says ‘hope’ like a dirt-stained palm.” <words>148</words>  
The maze of billboards pulsed, their lights dimming as the soothsayer planted the seed in the cracked earth. A single sprout pushed through, its leaves shimmering with the same neon hue as the desert. <words>166</words>  
“Environmental stewardship,” they repeated, this time with a bitter smile. “Maybe it’s not a lie. Maybe it’s just… delayed.” <words>178</words>  
The puzzle box dissolved into sand, its purpose fulfilled. The soothsayer stood, their panic replaced by a hollow resolve. The desert stretched on, but the seed’s glow was a promise—small, stubborn, and defiant. <words>196</words>  
They walked, the neon-lit maze behind them, the seed’s light a compass. “Shape destiny,” they mused, “or die trying. Either way, the world’s too loud to ignore.” <words>212</words>  
The wind carried the scent of rain, though the sky was empty. The soothsayer laughed, a sound like shattered glass. “Probably unlikely,” they said, “but here we are.” <words>226</words>  
The seed grew, its roots weaving through the desert’s bones. The soothsayer’s hands, once trembling, now cradled the future. <words>238</words>  
The maze of billboards faded, replaced by a horizon of green. The soothsayer’s panic had become a mantra: “Bare hands. Bare hands. Bare hands.” <words>252</words>  
They didn’t know if the world would listen, but the seed had already begun to speak. <words>261</words>
