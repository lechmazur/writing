The cryptic medium adjusted the mariner’s telescope, its brass lens fogged by the cybernetic organism manufacturing plant’s humid air. <words>10</words>  
The accidental double-booking of the vacation rental had led her here, a place where synthetic flesh pulsed beneath glass domes. <words>15</words>  
She had come to analyze the written legacy of forgotten creation myths, but the plant’s hum felt like a lullaby for something ancient. <words>23</words>  
The telescope’s focus shifted, revealing etchings on the walls—symbols older than the facility’s code. <words>27</words>  
A painter, normally unusual in their devotion to capturing the plant’s sterile beauty, paused mid-stroke, watching her. <words>34</words>  
“Do you see it?” the medium asked, voice steady despite the comforting unease of the space. <words>39</words>  
The painter nodded, their brush trembling. “The myths are here, but they’re not what they seem.” <words>45</words>  
The medium adjusted the telescope, its lenses aligning with the plant’s bioluminescent veins. <words>49</words>  
A flicker of light—something like a star map—danced across the walls, a cipher for the myths she sought. <words>55</words>  
“Every creation myth is a blueprint,” she murmured, tracing the patterns. “But this one… it’s unfinished.” <words>61</words>  
The painter’s canvas now held the same symbols, their strokes merging with the plant’s rhythm. <words>66</words>  
The medium’s fingers brushed the telescope’s frame, a relic from a time when sailors mapped the unknown. <words>72</words>  
“Why here?” she asked, though the question felt less like a query and more like a ritual. <words>77</words>  
The painter’s eyes were wide, as if the plant itself had whispered its secrets to them. <words>82</words>  
“The myths aren’t just written,” they said. “They’re built. This place… it’s a cradle for stories.” <words>88</words>  
The medium’s breath caught. The plant’s purpose was not to manufacture organisms but to preserve the written legacy of creation. <words>96</words>  
She adjusted the telescope again, this time to the ceiling, where a massive, dormant machine loomed. <words>101</words>  
“It’s a womb,” she whispered. “A vessel for myths to be born.” <words>106</words>  
The painter’s brush moved faster, their art now a dialogue with the plant’s pulse. <words>111</words>  
The medium’s motivation crystallized: to collect these myths before the plant’s next cycle erased them. <words>117</words>  
She reached out, her hand hovering over the telescope’s lens, as if touching the past. <words>122</words>  
The plant’s hum deepened, a sound that was both a warning and a welcome. <words>127</words>  
The painter stepped back, their canvas now a mosaic of symbols and light. <words>132</words>  
“Will you stay?” they asked, their voice a question and a plea. <words>137</words>  
The medium looked through the telescope one last time, seeing not just the plant’s structure but the weight of its stories. <words>145</words>  
“I’ll stay,” she said, the words a promise to the myths and the machine. <words>150</words>  
The plant’s lights dimmed, as if exhaling, and the medium felt the comforting unease of a story still being written. <words>157</words>
