The jumpy necromancer crouched behind a pixelated bush, his skeletal fingers twitching as he adjusted his tattered cloak. <words>20</words> The retro video game world pulsed with static, its neon-lit streets humming with the faint echoes of forgotten code. <words>34</words> Moonlight glinted off the fishhook he clutched, its barbed tip glowing faintly, as if the moon itself had dipped its finger into the void. <words>52</words> He had no idea why the old gods had slumbered, but their absence left the world brittle, its rules fraying at the edges. <words>69</words> His mission was clear: unmask the revered icon, a figure whose face was etched into every screen, whose voice echoed through the game’s corrupted core. <words>87</words> But the footsteps behind him—echoing, deliberate, and too loud for this world—made his pulse thrum like a glitch. <words>103</words>  

He faltered, his breath hitching as the fishhook’s glow intensified, casting jagged shadows on the walls. <words>116</words> The footsteps stopped. <words>120</words> A protest mural, hidden in a forgotten alley, caught his eye—a patchwork of paint drips that seemed to shift when he looked away. <words>135</words> By analyzing the drips, he noticed patterns: a spiral, a jagged line, a symbol of the old gods’ forgotten names. <words>150</words> The mural’s message was clear: the icon was not a savior but a thief, stealing the gods’ power to sustain the game’s illusion. <words>165</words>  

The fishhook pulsed again, its glow now a sickly green. <words>174</words> He reached out, and the mural’s paint dripped like blood, forming a path that led to a crumbling server room. <words>188</words> Inside, the air reeked of burnt circuits and decay. <words>196</words> The icon’s face, projected on a cracked screen, was not a hero but a hollow shell, its eyes void of light. <words>210</words> The necromancer’s hands shook as he raised the fishhook, its glow now a beacon. <words>222</words> The footsteps returned, louder this time, and the room’s walls began to fracture, revealing the game’s true nature: a prison for the old gods. <words>238</words>  

He faltered again, but this time, it was not fear. <words>247</words> The fishhook’s light revealed the icon’s true form—a corrupted entity feeding on the world’s memories. <words>260</words> With a scream, he hurled the hook, its barb piercing the screen. <words>270</words> The game shuddered, its pixels dissolving into a storm of static. <words>279</words> The footsteps faded, replaced by the distant, triumphant roar of the old gods awakening. <words>292</words> The necromancer, now a legend in a world reborn, vanished into the code, his jumpy steps echoing through the void. <words>306</words>  

The retro video game world, once a prison, now thrived with chaotic beauty. <words>318</words> The fishhook, now a relic of rebellion, glowed faintly in the moonlight, a reminder that even in the darkest code, truth could flicker. <words>333</words> The old gods, though awake, remained silent, their stories left to the players who dared to look beyond the pixels. <words>347</words> And the necromancer, typically bizarre, became a myth—a ghost in the machine, forever chasing the echoes of a world that refused to be controlled. <words>364</words>
