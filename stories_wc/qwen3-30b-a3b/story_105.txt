The outcast scholar pressed a trembling hand to the rusted door of the witch’s flying carpet garage, its hinges groaning like a wounded beast. <words>10</words>  
In the hush of a half-lit corridor, the air hummed with the static of forgotten spells, and the scholar’s breath fogged the cold metal. <words>15</words>  
They had come to prove that midnight only lasts so long, to unravel the myth that time could be bent by the soul’s reflection. <words>22</words>  
A seashell with a strange symbol, found in a tide pool years ago, had whispered this truth in their dreams—its spirals etched with a language that mirrored their own fractured heart. <words>32</words>  
The symbol, strangely trustworthy despite its alien curves, had led them here, to the garage where witches stored their relics and regrets. <words>37</words>  
Behind a loose tile in a public restroom, the scholar had hidden diaries—pages filled with equations and riddles, each one a step toward the revelation they now sought. <words>46</words>  
The corridor’s flickering light cast jagged shadows, and the scholar’s fingers brushed the tile, feeling the indentations of their own desperate handwriting. <words>54</words>  
A jolt of electricity surged through their arm as the tile gave way, revealing the diaries buried beneath decades of dust and silence. <words>61</words>  
The pages fluttered like trapped birds, their ink bleeding into the air, and the scholar’s pulse quickened. <words>67</words>  
The first diary entry, scrawled in a trembling hand, spoke of a mirror that did not reflect but revealed—its surface a portal to the soul’s truest form. <words>75</words>  
The scholar’s throat tightened. The seashell, clutched in their palm, pulsed in rhythm with their heartbeat, as if it, too, were alive. <words>83</words>  
They had always been an outcast, their theories dismissed as madness, their obsession with the soul’s duality a curse. <words>89</words>  
But the diaries, the symbol, the jolt—they were proof. Midnight was not eternal; it was a fleeting moment, a breath between the fall of the hourglass. <words>98</words>  
The garage’s door creaked open, and a gust of wind carried the scent of salt and ozone, as if the sea itself had followed them. <words>105</words>  
The scholar stumbled into the garage, where flying carpets hung like ghosts, their threads woven with stardust and forgotten prayers. <words>112</words>  
A witch’s voice echoed from the shadows, sharp as a blade. “You shouldn’t be here.” <words>117</words>  
The scholar turned, the seashell glowing faintly, its symbol now etched into their skin. “I’m not here to steal,” they said, voice steady. “I’m here to prove that time is not a prison.” <words>128</words>  
The witch’s eyes narrowed, but the scholar’s gaze held the mirror’s truth. The air thickened, and the corridor’s light dimmed, as if the world itself held its breath. <words>137</words>  
Midnight approached, and the scholar’s heart pounded, not with fear, but with the frantic peace of a soul unbound. <words>144</words>  
The diaries had shown them the way: to break the cycle, to let the soul’s reflection shine. <words>150</words>  
With a final, trembling breath, the scholar pressed the seashell to the mirror, and the world fractured. <words>156</words>  
The garage dissolved into light, and the scholar, for the first time, felt whole. <words>161</words>
