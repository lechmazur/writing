The scribe’s fingers trembled as they pried open the envelope, the adhesive still glistening like a secret. <words>10</words>  
The witch’s greenhouse clung to the hill of gravestones, its glass panes fogged with the breath of forgotten names. <words>15</words>  
Inside, the air hummed with the scent of damp soil and something metallic—like the prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop, now resting on a rusted shelf. <words>25</words>  
The scribe had come to analyze the leftover adhesive, a task as mundane as the dust clinging to their coat. <words>32</words>  
But the bulb’s glass was etched with symbols, and the scribe’s certainly uncertain mind wondered if it was a relic or a riddle. <words>42</words>  
They brushed a finger over the etchings, and the bulb flickered, casting shadows that danced like whispers on the gravestones. <words>51</words>  
A bellow of wind tore through the greenhouse, rattling the jars of dried herbs and sending the scribe stumbling back. <words>59</words>  
In that moment, the puzzle piece fit: the adhesive had been a seal, not a barrier, and the bulb’s glow was a key. <words>68</words>  
The scribe’s breath caught as the light pulsed, not with heat, but with a quiet transformation—like the greenhouse itself was exhaling. <words>78</words>  
They had come to cradle empathy in arms of steel, but the bulb’s glow revealed a truth more fragile than any circuit: the dead were not silent, only waiting. <words>89</words>  
The scribe’s uptight composure cracked, a crack through which buried optimism seeped, warm and unyielding. <words>98</words>  
The bulb’s light grew brighter, illuminating the gravestones’ names, each one a story the scribe had never dared to read. <words>108</words>  
They reached out, fingers brushing the bulb’s glass, and for the first time, the scribe felt the weight of their own uncertainty—no longer a chain, but a bridge. <words>119</words>  
The greenhouse seemed to lean closer, its plants swaying in a rhythm that matched the bulb’s heartbeat. <words>127</words>  
The scribe’s mission had been to decode the envelope’s seal, but the bulb had rewritten the code, turning a task into a revelation. <words>137</words>  
They whispered to the gravestones, their voice a thread in the tapestry of the dead, and the bulb’s glow softened, as if listening. <words>147</words>  
In the quiet transformation, the scribe found their purpose: not to control, but to cradle—empathy in steel, and steel in empathy. <words>157</words>  
The bellow of wind returned, but this time, it carried the scent of blooming flowers, not decay. <words>165</words>  
The scribe left the greenhouse with the bulb in hand, its light a compass pointing toward a future where the uncertain was not a flaw, but a frontier. <words>175</words>  
The gravestones remained, but the scribe no longer saw them as endings. <words>181</words>  
The bulb’s glow, steady and certain in its uncertainty, had taught them that even the darkest soil could birth light. <words>191</words>  
And in that light, the scribe’s heart, once rigid as a ledger, began to bloom. <words>199</words>
