<story>  
The wandering orchardist traced the cracked marble steps of the forgotten underwater city hall, his boots echoing in the hollow silence. <words>10</words>  
The air tasted of salt and rust, and the flickering bioluminescence of the deep cast ghostly shadows on the walls. <words>15</words>  
He carried a satchel of dried leaves, their brittle edges whispering secrets of lost orchards and forgotten harvests. <words>21</words>  
The leaves were his map, a collection of fragments from every world he’d ever wandered, each one a key to a trade route he’d yet to reclaim. <words>28</words>  
His motivation was simple: to chart the multiverse’s veins, to stitch together the fractured paths that once connected civilizations. <words>35</words>  
But the city hall held no maps—only the weight of time, and the memory of a kitchen table where his father had once taught him to read the stars. <words>43</words>  
That wisdom, now a bittersweet grit in his throat, had been his compass through the void. <words>48</words>  
As he reached the central chamber, a phantom hand brushed his shoulder, cold and insistent, guiding him toward a submerged pedestal. <words>56</words>  
The hand’s touch was a method, a bridge between the tangible and the impossible, and the orchardist felt the leaves in his satchel tremble. <words>64</words>  
On the pedestal lay a single, unmarked leaf—its veins glowing faintly, as if it had been waiting. <words>70</words>  
He took it, and the city hall shuddered, its walls dissolving into a cascade of light and water. <words>76</words>  
The phantom hand had reclaimed its due, leaving him with a fragment of a route that had never existed, yet felt familiar. <words>84</words>  
The orchardist’s trustworthiness was not in his words, but in his hands—calloused from years of grafting and gathering, now steady as he pressed the new leaf into his collection. <words>93</words>  
He had always been unique, a wanderer who saw the multiverse not as chaos, but as a garden to be tended. <words>100</words>  
The kitchen table wisdom had taught him that every leaf, every root, every lost path had a purpose. <words>106</words>  
As he drifted upward, the city hall’s ruins fading behind him, he wondered if the phantom hand had been a guardian—or a thief. <words>114</words>  
The leaves in his satchel rustled, a chorus of possibilities, and he smiled, the bittersweet grit of his journey sharpening his resolve. <words>122</words>  
He would map the trade routes, not for glory, but to ensure no orchard was ever truly lost. <words>129</words>  
The multiverse was infinite, but so was the orchardist’s need to reclaim what had been scattered. <words>136</words>  
And in the quiet of the deep, where time unraveled like a thread, he felt the phantom hand’s touch again—this time, a farewell. <words>144</words>  
The leaves whispered, and the orchardist walked on, a trustworthy unique soul in a world of endless possibilities. <words>152</words>
