The bookbinder adjusted her gloves, fingers brushing the frayed edges of a single chopstick wrapper tucked into her satchel. <words>10</words> The abandoned carnival prize booth creaked in the wind, its faded sign reading “Mystery Prizes” like a forgotten promise. <words>17</words> She’d heard rumors of lost legends here—tales of a man who’d sold his voice for a lifetime of silence. <words>25</words> Her telekinetic powers hummed faintly, a static undercurrent she’d learned to ignore. <words>31</words> But the wrapper’s crinkled surface felt different, as if it held a secret the carnival itself had buried. <words>38</words>  

A distant jingle echoed, sharp and sudden. <words>43</words> The bookbinder froze, her breath catching. <words>46</words> The sound—like a carousel’s bell—triggered a flashback: a child’s laughter, a man in a tuxedo, and a woman with a crown of feathers. <words>55</words> She staggered, the booth’s rusted walls blurring. <words>59</words> The price of knowledge, she thought, was never just a metaphor. <words>65</words>  

The wrapper slipped from her hand, landing in a puddle of rainwater. <words>71</words> She reached out, fingers twitching, and the paper lifted—unfolding like a wing. <words>77</words> Inside, a faded ticket stub read “1937.” <words>81</words> The carnival’s history surged back: a magician who’d tried to revive his dead wife, only to trap her spirit in a glass orb. <words>89</words> The bookbinder’s pulse quickened. <words>93</words> She’d come here to find transformation, but the past was a mirror, not a map. <words>100</words>  

Another sound—a creak, then a whisper. <words>105</words> The booth’s door groaned open, revealing a shadowed alcove. <words>110</words> She stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of burnt sugar and decay. <words>115</words> A dusty mirror reflected her face, but the eyes were wrong—glowing faintly, like the wrapper’s ink. <words>122</words> The price of knowledge, she realized, was not in the asking, but in the becoming. <words>129</words>  

The wrapper flared, its edges dissolving into ash. <words>134</words> A voice, layered and ancient, spoke: “You’ve seen the cost. Now choose.” <words>141</words> The bookbinder’s hands trembled. <words>145</words> She could revive the carnival’s ghosts, or let them rest. <words>150</words> Her telekinesis surged, a storm of paper and memory. <words>155</words> The mirror cracked, and the woman in it smiled—her own face, but younger, unburdened. <words>163</words>  

The booth shuddered, its walls dissolving into a tapestry of lost legends. <words>170</words> The bookbinder stood at the edge of a new story, the wrapper’s final whisper lingering: “Transformation is not a destination, but a debt.” <words>179</words> She closed her eyes, the carnival’s echoes fading. <words>183</words> The price of knowledge had been paid, but the cost was still hers to bear. <words>190</words>  

The world shifted, and she was no longer just a bookbinder. <words>196</words> She was a keeper of stories, a weaver of what was lost and what could be. <words>203</words> The chopstick wrapper was gone, but its lesson remained—a quiet, grand truth. <words>210</words>
