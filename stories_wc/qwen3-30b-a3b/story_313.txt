Jax adjusted his frayed trench coat, the dystopian farm’s rusted gates creaking behind him as he approached the overseer’s office. <words>1</words> The air reeked of diesel and decay, but he smiled, his usual mask of charm intact. <words>6</words> His target, a plump man in a soot-stained uniform, sat hunched over a desk, surrounded by empty tape dispensers. <words>13</words> Jax’s fingers twitched—this was the third one he’d seen, all hollow, like the promises of the regime. <words>20</words> “You’re late,” the overseer barked, but Jax only leaned in, eyes gleaming. <words>26</words> “Late? No, sir. I’m here to fix your problems.” <words>31</words> He pulled a crumpled ledger from his coat, its pages blank, and tapped it. <words>36</words> The overseer’s brow furrowed, but Jax’s grin widened. <words>41</words> This was the lull of remorse, the moment before the trap snapped shut. <words>47</words>  

The farm’s ghosts had whispered to him since he arrived, their voices like static in the wind. <words>54</words> They were the ones who’d died in the fields, their bodies buried under the same soil Jax now walked. <words>61</words> He’d learned to interrogate them, to ask questions only the dead could answer. <words>67</words> “Why did you stay?” he’d once asked a wisp of a woman, her face blurred by time. <words>73</words> “Because the alternative was nothing,” she’d replied, her voice a sigh. <words>78</words> Jax had laughed then, a sharp, bitter sound. <words>82</words> Now, he stood before the overseer, his heart a drumbeat of defiance. <words>88</words>  

The man’s eyes narrowed. “You think you can con me?” <words>93</words> Jax tilted his head, the “unusually normal” calm of his demeanor a weapon. <words>99</words> “I don’t con. I… comfort.” <words>103</words> He gestured to the empty tape dispensers. “These are your failures. I’ll replace them.” <words>109</words> The overseer’s face paled. “You’re mad.” <words>113</words> “No,” Jax said, stepping closer. “I’m just tired of the jaws of defeat. I’d rather grin.” <words>119</words> The ghosts stirred, their whispers rising. <words>123</words> He could feel their judgment, their sorrow, but he didn’t flinch. <words>128</words> This was his motivation, his twisted creed: to taunt the system that had broken them all. <words>135</words>  

The overseer lunged, but Jax was already moving, the tape dispenser in his hand a hollow relic of his past scams. <words>143</words> He tossed it at the man’s feet, the plastic clattering like a joke. <words>148</words> “You’re not the first to try,” Jax said, his voice a low hum. <words>153</words> “But you’ll be the last.” <words>156</words> The ghosts surged, their forms coalescing into a wall of shadows. <words>161</words> The overseer screamed, and Jax smiled, the lull of remorse finally lifting. <words>167</words> He’d won, not by trickery, but by the quiet, relentless truth of the dead. <words>173</words>  

The farm’s sky darkened, but Jax walked on, his boots crunching over the soil. <words>179</words> The ghosts followed, their whispers a chorus of comfort. <words>184</words> He’d found his purpose—not in the con, but in the defiance. <words>190</words> The dystopian world had tried to crush him, but he’d learned to grin through the cracks. <words>196</words> And in the end, that was enough. <words>199</words>
