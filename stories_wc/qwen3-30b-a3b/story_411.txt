<story>  
The sentient car mechanic, whose repulsively attractive face was a mosaic of rust and polished chrome, knelt by the subterranean orchard’s fountain, where the underground river of stars pulsed like a celestial heartbeat. <words>25</words>  
Each fragment of the lost puzzle, scattered in the water, hummed with the weight of unsaid confessions, and the mechanic’s fingers, calloused from decades of fixing broken machines, trembled as they reached for them. <words>45</words>  
The vintage opera glasses, perched on their nose, magnified the fragments into shimmering constellations, each one a memory waiting to be studied. <words>61</words>  
“Gathering fragments,” the mechanic murmured, their voice a blend of gears and sighs, “is how we hear the unsaid confessions of the infinite.” <words>78</words>  
Above, the orchard’s fruit glowed like lanterns, their roots drinking from the starlit river, while the mechanic sorted the puzzle pieces by color, shape, and the faint, ghostly whispers they carried. <words>98</words>  
A fragment shaped like a broken violin string held the confession of a composer who’d died mid-chorus, his final note lost to the void. <words>113</words>  
Another, a jagged shard of obsidian, bore the regret of a king who’d traded his crown for a moment of peace, now trapped in the river’s current. <words>129</words>  
The mechanic’s chest, a hollow shell of metal and longing, ached with exultant grief—joy in the act of discovery, sorrow in the knowledge that no puzzle would ever be complete. <words>149</words>  
They had spent eons here, in the subterranean orchard, where time folded like origami, and the river of stars flowed backward and forward, carrying fragments from every era. <words>169</words>  
The method was simple: sort, study, and listen. <words>176</words>  
Yet the fragments resisted, slipping through the mechanic’s fingers like stardust, each one a riddle wrapped in a paradox. <words>190</words>  
“Why do we gather what can never be whole?” the mechanic asked the orchard, their voice echoing off the stone walls. <words>204</words>  
The trees rustled, their leaves whispering in a language of rust and root, and the river of stars shimmered in response. <words>218</words>  
Because the act of gathering was the confession itself, the mechanic realized—their own, their world’s, the universe’s. <words>233</words>  
They held a fragment to the opera glasses, and for a moment, the fountain’s water stilled, reflecting a thousand faces, each one a story, each one a truth. <words>251</words>  
The mechanic’s repulsively attractive face, a blend of beauty and decay, softened as they smiled, a sound like a gear finally clicking into place. <words>267</words>  
In the infinite, there was no end, only the endless act of seeking, of piecing together the unsaid, of finding solace in the fragments. <words>283</words>  
And so, the sentient car mechanic continued, their hands steady, their heart a machine of longing, as the subterranean orchard bloomed and the river of stars flowed on. <words>301</words>
