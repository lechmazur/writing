The wayward apothecary adjusted the brass goggles, their fingers trembling as they traced the dry highlighter pen across the submarine’s observation deck glass. <words>10</words>  
The steampunk vessel groaned like a battered marvel, its gears creaking beneath the weight of broken treaties. <words>14</words>  
They had come to track migratory butterflies, their wings shimmering with bioluminescent pollen, but the highlighter’s ink had long since dried, leaving only a ghost of their notes. <words>25</words>  
A flicker of light from the deck’s Morse code transmitter caught their eye—someone was trying to reach them. <words>29</words>  
The apothecary’s heart quickened; the signals were erratic, a desperate rhythm that mirrored the chaos of the world outside. <words>35</words>  
They had always been unjustly fair, their reputation as a healer tainted by rumors of alchemy gone wrong. <words>41</words>  
Yet here, in the submarine’s dim glow, they felt a strange kinship with the butterflies, their fragile beauty defying the broken treaties that divided the skies. <words>50</words>  
The highlighter pen, a relic from their past, had once been used to mark vials of elixirs, but now it served as a makeshift tool to chart the butterflies’ paths. <words>60</words>  
A sudden jolt of the submarine sent them sprawling, the pen clattering to the floor. <words>64</words>  
They scrambled to retrieve it, their hands brushing against the cold metal, and for a moment, the world felt still. <words>70</words>  
The Morse code signals grew louder, a message encoded in the language of survival. <words>74</words>  
The apothecary deciphered the pattern: “INFECTED. HELP.” <words>78</words>  
Their breath hitched. The butterflies were not just migratory—they were carriers, their pollen laced with a virus that had ravaged the surface. <words>87</words>  
The apothecary had spent years studying the creatures, but never imagined they could be a threat. <words>93</words>  
The submarine’s engine roared, a reminder of the fragile truce between warring factions. <words>98</words>  
They had always believed in unconventional love, in the bonds that defied logic, but this was different. <words>105</words>  
The highlighter pen, now a symbol of their failure, lay in their palm, its tip cracked. <words>111</words>  
A voice crackled through the transmitter: “You’re the only one who can stop it.” <words>117</words>  
The apothecary’s fingers tightened around the pen, their mind racing. <words>121</words>  
They had once been a healer, but the world had turned its back on them, branding them a heretic. <words>128</words>  
Now, they stood at the edge of a choice: to save the butterflies or destroy them. <words>134</words>  
The Morse code signals pulsed again, a heartbeat of desperation. <words>138</words>  
They thought of the unjustly fair, the ones who had suffered for their kindness, and knew what they had to do. <words>146</words>  
With a deep breath, the apothecary activated the submarine’s distillation unit, using the highlighter pen to mark the butterflies’ wings. <words>155</words>  
The virus would be neutralized, but the cost would be their own. <words>160</words>  
As the submarine dove into the depths, the apothecary whispered a prayer, their heart aching with the weight of love and loss. <words>170</words>  
The world above would never know their sacrifice, but in the silence of the ocean, their story would endure. <words>178</words>
