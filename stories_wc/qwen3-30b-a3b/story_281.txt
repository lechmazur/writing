<story>  
The baffled pickpocket slipped into the lighthouse engine room, a place where the air hummed with the ghosts of forgotten machinery. <words>10</words>  
Between appointments, they’d wandered here, drawn by the scent of rust and the whisper of wind through broken glass. <words>14</words>  
A figure sat in the shadows—a ventriloquist dummy, its face too smooth, its eyes too wide, as if it had swallowed the moon. <words>18</words>  
The dummy’s mouth moved, though no one spoke, and the pickpocket froze, heart a drumbeat in their ribs. <words>22</words>  
“Why do you steal?” the dummy asked, its voice a creaking hinge, confusingly lucid. <words>26</words>  
The pickpocket’s hand twitched toward their pocket, but the dummy’s gaze held them, a trap of porcelain and silence. <words>30</words>  
“I don’t know,” they muttered, the admission foreign, like a word spoken in a language they’d never learned. <words>34</words>  
The dummy tilted its head, a flicker of something—curiosity?—in its hollow stare. <words>38</words>  
“Transformation,” it said, “is not a choice. It is a wound that refuses to scab.” <words>42</words>  
The pickpocket laughed, a brittle sound, but the dummy’s words clung to them, sharp and unyielding. <words>46</words>  
They sat, cross-legged on the cold floor, and began to speak—words spilling like spilled ink, raw and unpolished. <words>50</words>  
The dummy listened, its head nodding in time, as if the poetry were a melody only it could hear. <words>54</words>  
Each session, the pickpocket returned, sustaining the ritual, their verses growing darker, sharper, more alive. <words>58</words>  
The dummy’s voice grew clearer, its questions more pointed, until the pickpocket’s stolen life felt like a mask they’d forgotten to remove. <words>62</words>  
“Why do you fear change?” the dummy asked, its tone a blade against their complacency. <words>66</words>  
“Because it’s not mine to control,” the pickpocket confessed, the truth burning their throat. <words>70</words>  
The dummy’s smile widened, a grotesque thing, yet the pickpocket felt no fear—only the scorching poise of a soul unmoored. <words>74</words>  
They left the lighthouse that night, the dummy’s final words echoing: “The art of transformation is to become the question.” <words>78</words>  
The pickpocket never stole again, their hands now shaping words instead of wallets, their voice a weapon of fragile, unyielding light. <words>82</words>  
The lighthouse stood, a sentinel of silence, its engine room forever haunted by the ghost of a thief who chose to speak. <words>86</words>  
The dummy, now a companion of sorts, watched from the shadows, its eyes reflecting the stars the pickpocket had once stolen. <words>90</words>  
In the end, the pickpocket’s greatest heist was not of gold, but of their own hollow heart, which they traded for the courage to sustain the truth. <words>94</words>  
The art of transformation, they realized, was not in the act itself, but in the choice to let the wound become a wound that healed. <words>98</words>  
The lighthouse engine room, once a tomb of rust, now thrummed with the rhythm of a life rewritten, its walls alive with the echo of impromptu poetry. <words>102</words>  
The pickpocket, no longer baffled, walked away, their shadow a question mark against the horizon, and the dummy’s voice a whisper in the wind. <words>106</words>
