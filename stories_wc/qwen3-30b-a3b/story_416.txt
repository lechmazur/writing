The knight adjusted his gauntlets, the luminous swamp’s bioluminescent mist clinging to his armor like a second skin. <words>10</words>  
After the scoreboard reset at the championship match, he’d been ordered to patrol the outskirts, but his true mission was to verify the legend of the fossilized snail shell. <words>20</words>  
His academic rebelliousness had led him here—sacrificing protocol for the thrill of unearthing truths buried in folklore. <words>30</words>  
The swamp pulsed with an eerie glow, its mire swallowing the last rays of the sun. <words>36</words>  
He knelt, fingers brushing the damp earth, when a sudden jostle sent him sprawling. <words>44</words>  
A figure in a tattered cloak had bumped into him, both reaching for the same object: a translucent shell, its spirals etched with ancient runes. <words>56</words>  
“Careful,” the stranger muttered, their voice a rasp. <words>62</words>  
The knight straightened, his posture rigid. “This is a sacred artifact. You should not be here.” <words>71</words>  
The stranger chuckled, pulling the shell closer. “And you should not be chasing myths, Sir Lysander.” <words>80</words>  
He froze. “How do you know my name?” <words>85</words>  
“Because I’ve been tracking the same legend,” they said, revealing a journal filled with sketches of the shell. <words>94</words>  
Their paths had converged not by chance, but by the swamp’s will—a force that wove their fates into a single thread. <words>104</words>  
Lysander’s heart pounded, a rare crack in his disciplined demeanor. “You’re a scholar too?” <words>112</words>  
“Once,” they said, their eyes narrowing. “But I’ve seen what happens when truth is buried.” <words>119</words>  
The shell hummed faintly, as if alive. Lysander’s fingers twitched. “It’s real. The stories weren’t lies.” <words>128</words>  
The stranger nodded. “But legends are only half the story. The other half is why we’re here.” <words>136</words>  
Lysander’s jaw tightened. “To collect urban legends? That’s not why I fight.” <words>144</words>  
“Then why?” the stranger pressed, their tone sharp. “For glory? For the crown?” <words>151</words>  
He hesitated. “To prove that even the smallest truths matter.” <words>157</words>  
The stranger’s smirk faded. “Then we’re not so different.” <words>163</words>  
They shared the shell, its glow intensifying as if recognizing its keeper. <words>169</words>  
Lysander’s mind raced. The swamp’s legends, the championship’s reset, the shell’s power—it all pointed to a greater design. <words>179</words>  
“Converging destinies,” he whispered, the phrase tasting foreign yet inevitable. <words>187</words>  
The stranger’s gaze softened. “Maybe that’s the real legend.” <words>193</words>  
Lysander studied them, the weight of their shared quest settling over him. <words>200</words>  
For the first time, his straight-laced world felt vast, its edges fraying into something wilder. <words>209</words>  
The swamp’s mist thickened, swallowing their footprints, but the shell’s glow remained—a beacon of what they’d uncovered. <words>219</words>  
As they parted, Lysander knew their paths would cross again. <words>225</words>  
The legend was no longer just a story. It was a beginning. <words>231</words>
