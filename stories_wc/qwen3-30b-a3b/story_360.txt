<story>  
The meek necromancer crouched in the shadow of the underground city of the goblins, where the air hummed with the peculiar sincerity of a thousand whispered secrets. <words>10</words>  
His fountain pen, with a broken nib, lay useless in his trembling hand, its ink pooling like blood on the damp stone. <words>15</words>  
Yet he clung to it, for it was the last gift from the scholar who had taught him to read the tangled tapestry of life and death. <words>22</words>  
Above, the faint echoes of playground sounds drifted down—a child’s laughter, a swing creaking, the distant clang of a metal slide. <words>28</words>  
The goblins, with their gnarled tools and flickering torches, had no place for such innocence, but the necromancer found solace in the contrast. <words>35</words>  
He had come to decode a universal riddle, a truth hidden in the threads of the tapestry that bound all things. <words>41</words>  
The goblins called it a curse, this ability to commune with the dead, but to him, it was a gift he had never asked for. <words>48</words>  
Now, with the pen’s broken tip, he sought to regain the clarity he had lost, to see the pattern in the chaos. <words>55</words>  
A dew drop clung to a spiderweb near his feet, catching the dim light like a tiny, trembling star. <words>61</words>  
He stared, transfixed, as the light fractured into prisms, revealing shapes that pulsed with meaning. <words>67</words>  
The tapestry, he realized, was not a single thread but a mosaic of moments, each reflecting the others. <words>74</words>  
The playground sounds, the goblins’ grunts, the silence of the dead—all were part of the same design. <words>81</words>  
He dipped the pen’s broken nib into the dew drop, and the ink flowed, not as a tool, but as a bridge. <words>88</words>  
The words he wrote were not his own, but the whispers of the tapestry itself, a language older than time. <words>95</words>  
The goblins, sensing the shift, paused their work, their eyes wide with something like awe. <words>101</words>  
The necromancer’s hands steadied, his voice soft but certain as he spoke the riddle’s answer: “To live is to lose, but to remember is to regain.” <words>111</words>  
The tapestry shimmered, and for a moment, the underground city glowed with the light of a thousand forgotten lives. <words>118</words>  
The goblins bowed, not to power, but to the quiet truth that had always been there, waiting to be seen. <words>125</words>  
The meek necromancer smiled, his heart lighter, the broken pen now a symbol of what he had learned. <words>132</words>  
In the tangled tapestry, every thread mattered, and every moment, even the smallest, held the weight of eternity. <words>139</words>  
He left the goblins to their world, carrying the dew drop’s light in his pocket and the riddle’s answer in his soul. <words>146</words>  
The playground sounds faded, but their echo remained, a reminder that even in darkness, there was a way to see. <words>153</words>  
The meek necromancer walked on, not as a master of death, but as a student of the tapestry’s endless, simple truth. <words>160</words>
