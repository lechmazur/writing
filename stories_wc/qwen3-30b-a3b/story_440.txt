<story>  
The detached swordsman moved through the futuristic city recycling center, his boots crunching on fragmented glass and rusted metal. <words>10</words>  
The air hummed with the low whir of automated sorters, but he ignored them, drawn instead to a flicker of blue beneath a pile of discarded plastics. <words>20</words>  
There, half-buried in the refuse, lay a piece of sea pottery—its surface etched with symbols that seemed to shift when he tilted it. <words>30</words>  
He pocketed it, his expression unreadable, though the gesture was oddly tender. <words>37</words>  
The recycling center’s AI had just completed its final scan, and the last swipe of paint had dried on a mural that stretched across the wall—a chaotic collage of human faces and mechanical limbs. <words>50</words>  
The swordsman paused, studying the mural’s chaotic beauty. <words>55</words>  
He had no memory of the artist, but the work felt like a message, a puzzle waiting to be solved. <words>64</words>  
The sea pottery’s symbols matched a pattern in the mural’s lower corner, where a cluster of collage scraps had been left uncollected. <words>75</words>  
He knelt, fingers brushing the scraps—fragments of newspaper, torn fabric, and a single dried rose petal. <words>84</words>  
By reassembling them, he discovered a hidden inscription: “The secret weavers mend what time forgets.” <words>94</words>  
The words sent a flicker of something—nostalgia, perhaps—through him, though he dismissed it as a trick of the light. <words>104</words>  
His mission had always been to consecrate an impossible vow: to restore a world that had crumbled into entropy. <words>114</words>  
The secret weavers, he realized, were not people but a philosophy—a belief that even in decay, fragments could be made whole. <words>124</words>  
He meddled, not out of curiosity, but because the vow demanded it. <words>130</words>  
The collage scraps, when pieced together, formed a map of the city’s forgotten corners, each mark a memory lost to the recycling center’s relentless cycle. <words>141</words>  
The sea pottery, he now saw, was a key—a fragment of a larger artifact that once held the city’s first vow. <words>151</words>  
He traced the symbols with a gloved finger, feeling the weight of centuries in the grooves. <words>159</words>  
The swordsman’s detachment was a shield, but the act of reassembling the scraps felt oddly like a prayer. <words>169</words>  
Playful seriousness, he thought, was the only way to confront the absurdity of his task. <words>177</words>  
The recycling center’s lights dimmed as the AI prepared to reset, but he worked faster, his movements precise and deliberate. <words>187</words>  
When the final scrap clicked into place, the mural shimmered, revealing a hidden chamber beneath the floor. <words>196</words>  
Inside, a single artifact pulsed with light—a mirror that reflected not his face, but the city as it once was. <words>206</words>  
He touched it, and the vow stirred within him, no longer impossible but alive. <words>213</words>  
The secret weavers had always known: even the most broken things could be mended, if one dared to look. <words>223</words>  
The swordsman stood, the sea pottery glowing faintly in his palm, and walked into the unknown, his detachment now a quiet, loving resolve. <words>234</words>
