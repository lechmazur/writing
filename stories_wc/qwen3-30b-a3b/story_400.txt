<story>  
The glacial orchard hung over a crevasse of blue ice, its roots clinging to the edge of a world long abandoned. <words>10</words>  
The druid, a figure of guarded solitude, moved through the brittle branches, their cloak stitched with threads of forgotten stories. <words>18</words>  
A dull safety pin, its edge dulled by time, clung to their belt—a relic from a life they refused to name. <words>26</words>  
Every birthday, they gathered what remained: a single apple, a shard of glass, and a whisper of salt. <words>34</words>  
The meal was a ritual, a fragile defiance against the silence that had swallowed the last human voice. <words>42</words>  
They called it a "family meal," though no kin remained to share it, only the ghosts of laughter trapped in the ice. <words>50</words>  
Fiercely ambivalent, they both craved and feared the act of breaking the silence, as if the world might recoil. <words>58</words>  
The safety pin, a tool of repair, had once fastened a wound they could not remember. <words>66</words>  
Now, it served as a reminder: even the smallest thing could hold the weight of a thousand unspoken words. <words>74</words>  
The druid knelt, gathering the apple, its skin etched with frost, and placed it on a stone altar. <words>82</words>  
The crevasse below pulsed with a blue light, as if the earth itself were breathing, waiting. <words>90</words>  
They lit a fire with kindling from the orchard’s roots, its smoke curling into the void like a question. <words>98</words>  
Dour amusement flickered in their eyes as they imagined the last human, now dust, laughing at this absurdity. <words>106</words>  
The meal was never meant to nourish; it was a pact with the void, a way to stave off the fear that gnawed at their bones. <words>114</words>  
Yet, as the fire dimmed, they felt the silence shift, not as a threat, but as a companion. <words>122</words>  
The safety pin, cold against their palm, seemed to hum with a quiet promise: even in emptiness, there was a way to hold on. <words>130</words>  
They reached into the crevasse, fingers brushing the ice, and for the first time, the silence did not feel like a wound. <words>138</words>  
It felt like a threshold. <words>141</words>  
The druid stood, their shadow stretching across the orchard, a silhouette of defiance and doubt. <words>149</words>  
They had gathered not just food, but the courage to let the silence speak, to let it be a part of them. <words>157</words>  
The blue ice below seemed to ripple, as if the world had finally heard. <words>165</words>  
In the quiet, they found a strange peace, a duality of fear and hope that mirrored their own fiercely ambivalent soul. <words>173</words>  
The glacial orchard, once a monument to loss, now thrummed with the possibility of something new. <words>181</words>  
The druid smiled, a flicker of dour amusement, and turned away, the safety pin glinting like a secret. <words>189</words>  
They had not broken the silence, but they had learned to live within it, a fragile, stubborn act of survival. <words>197</words>  
And in that, they found a strange, enduring strength. <words>202</words>
