<story>  
The apathetic summoner wandered the shared dream recording studio, where the air hummed with the static of forgotten melodies. <words>10</words>  
Their fingers brushed the rustic coffee grinder, its wooden grooves worn smooth by years of silent labor. <words>14</words>  
The studio’s walls were lined with matching empty frames, their glass shattered, waiting for something to unfold. <words>18</words>  
After the last breath of a dying god, the world had become a hush, and the summoner’s task was to rebuild coral reefs from the ruins of a drowned sky. <words>26</words>  
They were enthusiastically lazy, preferring to let the river wisdom seep into their bones rather than chase it. <words>30</words>  
The frames, they realized, were not empty but mirrors—each one reflecting a fragment of the god’s final breath, now trapped in the studio’s silence. <words>36</words>  
The coffee grinder, a relic from a forgotten café, was the key to unlocking the river’s secrets, its grind a ritual that stirred the studio’s dormant echoes. <words>44</words>  
With a sigh, the summoner placed a handful of beans into the grinder, their movements slow, deliberate, as if the act itself were a prayer. <words>50</words>  
The sound of grinding filled the hall, a rhythm that matched the pulse of the dying god’s memory, and the frames began to shimmer. <words>56</words>  
Each frame revealed a scene: a coral reef, vibrant and teeming, then its slow decay, then the summoner’s hands, trembling as they reached for the fragments. <words>64</words>  
The river wisdom, they learned, was not a force but a choice—a way to mend what had been broken, not through grand gestures, but through the quiet persistence of a single, grinding act. <words>74</words>  
The summoner’s apathy, once a shield, now felt like a burden. They had to act, not for glory, but to honor the god’s final breath, which had left the world aching for balance. <words>84</words>  
They ground more beans, the studio’s walls vibrating with the weight of their resolve, and the frames began to align, their edges glowing with the faint light of a reborn reef. <words>92</words>  
The coffee grinder, once a tool of routine, became a conduit for the river’s wisdom, its grooves etched with the stories of what had been lost and what could still be saved. <words>102</words>  
The summoner’s laziness, they realized, was not a flaw but a lens—a way to see the world not as it was, but as it could be, if only they chose to listen. <words>112</words>  
As the last frame clicked into place, the studio dissolved, and the summoner found themselves standing on a shore, the ocean before them alive with color, the coral reefs blooming like forgotten dreams. <words>124</words>  
The river wisdom had not been a gift but a test, and the summoner, though still apathetic, had chosen to care. <words>130</words>  
They smiled, the coffee grinder clutched in their hand, and walked into the tide, their steps light, their heart a little less heavy. <words>138</words>  
The studio, now empty, held only the echo of their choice, a testament to the gentle sharpness of a world that refused to die. <words>146</words>
