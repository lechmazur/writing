<story>  
The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his tattered cloak, the fabric as formally casual as his demeanor, as he stepped into the forgotten library inside an abandoned mine. <words>20</words>  
The air was thick with dust and the scent of old parchment, a place where time had forgotten to breathe. <words>25</words>  
He carried a single lantern, its flickering light revealing shelves of discredited textbooks, their spines cracked and titles faded. <words>34</words>  
The warlock’s mission was clear: to optimize the power of the viking ship figurehead fragment he’d unearthed, a lost artifact whispered about in half-remembered legends. <words>46</words>  
The fragment, a jagged piece of carved oak, pulsed faintly in his gloved hand, as if aware of its own significance. <words>53</words>  
He had read the rumors—cures for ailments no one dared name, secrets buried in the margins of forgotten tomes. <words>61</words>  
When the final calendar page of the year was flipped, the mine’s entrance sealed itself, trapping him in the labyrinth of knowledge. <words>71</words>  
The warlock’s thin lips curled into a smirk. “Warnings are for the timid,” he muttered, though his voice trembled with the weight of his own certainty. <words>83</words>  
He pored over the texts, their pages brittle, their advice absurd: “Mix moonlight with the tears of a dying star” or “Bury the fragment in a grave of silence.” <words>95</words>  
Yet, amid the nonsense, a pattern emerged—a ritual to awaken the artifact’s dormant magic, a method as absurd as it was precise. <words>107</words>  
The warlock’s hands shook as he arranged the fragment on a stone altar, its edges glowing faintly. <words>114</words>  
He chanted the incantation, his voice a blend of arrogance and desperation, as the mine’s walls groaned in response. <words>123</words>  
The air thickened, and the fragment’s glow intensified, casting shadows that moved like living things. <words>131</words>  
A voice, neither male nor female, echoed through the chamber: “You seek the fruit of knowledge, but do you know its taste?” <words>141</words>  
The warlock laughed, though his heart pounded. “Certainty is the only cure I need.” <words>148</words>  
The fragment erupted in light, and the library dissolved into a storm of symbols and whispers. <words>155</words>  
He saw visions—ships sinking, empires rising, the weight of history pressing against his skull. <words>163</words>  
The warlock stumbled back, his mind fractured, yet his resolve unshaken. “This is what I’ve waited for,” he gasped, blood trickling from his nose. <words>175</words>  
The mine’s silence returned, but the fragment now rested in his chest, a cold, pulsing thing. <words>183</words>  
He had optimized the artifact, but at what cost? The answer lay in the discredited texts, now etched into his soul. <words>193</words>  
As the calendar’s final page turned, the warlock’s reflection in a cracked mirror showed a man both wiser and more lost than before. <words>204</words>  
The library’s doors creaked open, but he did not leave. The fruit of knowledge, he realized, was never meant to be eaten. <words>214</words>  
It was meant to be carried, a burden as heavy as the weight of the world. <words>220</words>  
The warlock’s thin lips pressed into a line, a smile of confusing certainty. <words>227</words>  
He had gorged on knowledge, and the taste was eternal. <words>232</words>
