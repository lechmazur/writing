<story>  
The frigid tundra orchard, dotted with geothermal vents, hummed with an eerie warmth that clashed against the biting wind. <words>20</words>  
Kael, the hesitant swordsman, clutched a blank postcard, its surface as empty as his resolve. <words>24</words>  
He had come to this desolate place to restore traditional systems, but the task felt heavier than any blade he had ever wielded. <words>30</words>  
The orchard’s trees, twisted and gnarled, bore fruit that glowed faintly, a relic of a world that no longer existed. <words>32</words>  
By the life of hermit crabs moving shells, he had learned to bridge worlds, though the method felt as absurd as his own awkwardness. <words>37</words>  
Each crab’s slow, deliberate motion was a ritual, a cipher for the ancient art of translocation. <words>39</words>  
Kael had spent years deciphering the pattern, but the final piece of evidence was only now being filed away. <words>43</words>  
The postcard, he realized, was not a message but a key—a vessel for the crabs’ energy to emerge. <words>46</words>  
His fingers trembled as he pressed it against a vent, the heat seeping into the paper like a whispered secret. <words>49</words>  
The crabs, sensing the shift, began their dance, shells clacking in a rhythm that pulsed through the earth. <words>52</words>  
A rift shimmered in the air, a thin veil between realms, and Kael’s breath caught in his throat. <words>55</words>  
Ephemeral rancor simmered in his chest—anger at the world’s decay, at his own failure to act. <words>58</words>  
Yet the crabs moved on, indifferent to his turmoil, their purpose as eternal as the vents themselves. <words>61</words>  
He stepped forward, the postcard now glowing faintly, its blankness a promise of what could be. <words>64</words>  
The rift widened, revealing a glimpse of the world he sought to restore: a place of harmony, of systems unbroken. <words>68</words>  
But the vision flickered, unstable, as if the bridge required more than his will. <words>71</words>  
Kael’s awkwardness, once a source of shame, now felt like a strength—a reminder that he was not meant to be perfect. <words>75</words>  
He knelt, placing the postcard at the center of the crabs’ path, and whispered a prayer to the vents. <words>78</words>  
The ground trembled, and the rift surged, a torrent of light and shadow that swallowed the orchard whole. <words>81</words>  
When the silence returned, the tundra was unchanged, but Kael felt the weight of the world shift in his bones. <words>85</words>  
He had not restored the systems, but he had emerged—into a role he had never dared to claim. <words>88</words>  
The postcard, now etched with a single word, lay in his palm: “Bridge.” <words>91</words>  
And the crabs, ever patient, began their dance anew, their shells a testament to the fragile, fleeting act of connection. <words>95</words>
