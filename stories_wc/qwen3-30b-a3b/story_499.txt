In the underground orchard, where bioluminescent fungus pulsed like a heartbeat, the ghostwriter traced the worn leather sandals with a poetically rational hand. <words>30</words>  
The shipwrecked journals, their pages corroded by salt and time, held coded stanzas that whispered of secret identities. <words>30</words>  
Amid the orchestra tuning, the ghostwriter’s fingers trembled, each note a thread in the tapestry of control they sought to weave. <words>30</words>
