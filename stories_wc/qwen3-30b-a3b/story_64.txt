The floating marketplace swayed gently, its stalls tethered to hot air balloons that hummed with ancient magic, as the uncertain alchemist traced the coded scuffs on the centuries-old marble floor, each mark a cipher for the price of immortality. <words>30</words>  
The cracked scale from a mythical beast lay in her satchel, its edges glinting with a wild, unyielding light, a relic she’d stolen from a forest trail she’d spent years mapping, though the map’s final page remained blank. <words>45</words>  
At the hush before the judge read the verdict, she knelt, fingers brushing the scuffs, their patterns echoing the scale’s fractures, as if the floor itself remembered the cost of defying death. <words>55</words>  
The alchemist’s hands trembled—not from fear, but from the weight of choices: to safeguard the scale, or let it dissolve into the marketplace’s mundane miracles, where even immortality was just another trade. <words>65</words>  
She’d once believed the scale’s magic could grant eternal life, but the forest trails had taught her otherwise; every step forward demanded a sacrifice, and the price of immortality was never what it seemed. <words>75</words>  
The judge’s voice cut through the air, sharp as a blade, but the alchemist’s focus remained on the scuffs, their code a riddle only the wild could solve, a language of cracks and shadows. <words>85</words>  
Her motivation had always been to map the unknown, but the scale’s whispers had twisted her path, turning her into a thief of time, a guardian of secrets the marketplace’s merchants would never understand. <words>95</words>  
The cracked scale pulsed faintly, as if aware of her hesitation, its wildness a mirror to her own uncertainty, a reminder that some truths were too heavy to carry alone. <words>105</words>  
She pressed her palm to the floor, the scuffs glowing briefly, and for a heartbeat, the marketplace’s hum shifted, the balloons’ songs harmonizing with the scale’s fractured song. <words>115</words>  
The judge’s verdict was a blur, but the alchemist knew the real trial had been here, in the space between the coded scuffs and the scale’s silent plea, where the price of immortality was not a promise, but a question. <words>125</words>  
She rose, the scale now a part of the floor’s design, its cracks woven into the marble’s history, a safeguard against those who’d trade eternity for a moment’s greed. <words>135</words>  
The marketplace continued its sway, mundane miracles unfolding in the shadows, as the alchemist walked away, her map no longer a goal, but a lesson in the cost of forever. <words>145</words>
