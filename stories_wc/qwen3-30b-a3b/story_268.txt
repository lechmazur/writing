The subdued vigilante crouched in the abandoned waiting area, fingers tracing the cracked surface of an antique funhouse mirror. <words>10</words> Its distortions, flickering like static, were the only map he had to navigate the price of war. <words>15</words> He’d spent years mastering the art of tracking these anomalies, a ritual passed down through whispers of a forgotten order. <words>21</words> The plain wooden bead in his palm, smooth and unremarkable, was the key to unlocking the mirror’s secrets. <words>26</words> Artfully clumsy, his movements betrayed the precision of a man who’d long since abandoned pride. <words>32</words> During virtual calls, he’d once flattered a warlord into revealing a hidden supply route, but the cost had been measured in blood. <words>39</words> Now, the mirror’s distortions pulsed with a rhythm he couldn’t yet decipher, a language of fractures and shadows. <words>46</words> The waiting area, once a hub of hurried travelers, now echoed with the silence of a world that had forgotten its own name. <words>53</words> He adjusted the bead, its grain catching the dim light, and wondered if the ancient art he sought was a cure or a curse. <words>60</words> The war’s price wasn’t just in lives lost but in the quiet erosion of what it meant to be human. <words>67</words> His reflection in the mirror wavered, stretched into a grotesque parody of himself, as if the glass itself resisted his presence. <words>75</words> He whispered a prayer to the distortions, a plea for clarity, but the mirror only laughed in fractured tones. <words>82</words> The bead grew warm, a heat that seeped into his skin, and for a moment, he saw the war’s face—etched in the cracks of the glass. <words>90</words> It was a face he’d seen before, in the eyes of the dead, in the hollows of the survivors. <words>96</words> The price of war, he realized, was not a single moment but a thousand small betrayals, each one a thread in the tapestry of his vigil. <words>105</words> He pressed the bead against the mirror, its surface warping into a portal of sorts, and stepped through. <words>111</words> The waiting area dissolved, replaced by a battlefield frozen in time, where the screams of the past screamed louder than the present. <words>119</words> He moved through the chaos, a shadow among the ruins, his artfully clumsy hands reaching for the next bead in a chain of forgotten sacrifices. <words>128</words> The war’s price was not paid in gold or glory but in the quiet, relentless act of remembering. <words>135</words> As the mirror’s distortions stabilized, he knew the next call would be his last, a final flattery to the void. <words>142</words> The waiting area, now a tomb of echoes, held his silence as he vanished into the screaming void. <words>149</words>
