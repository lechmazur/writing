<story>  
The aerial gondola creaked as it crossed the jagged peaks, its cables humming with the weight of the monk’s resolve. <words>15</words>  
Brother Elian clutched the creased shipping label, its ink faded but the address still legible: "Harvesting the Past." <words>16</words>  
The label had been tucked inside a hollowed-out scripture, a relic from the monastery’s forgotten archives. <words>14</words>  
His fingers traced the frayed edges, a habit born of stubbornness, as the gondola dipped below a cloud. <words>14</words>  
In the heartbeat after a dream returns, he’d seen the flute—its surface marred by tooth marks, its melody a dirge for the dead. <words>17</words>  
The monks called him "the unyielding," a title he wore like a second robe, but the gondola’s sway unsettled him. <words>15</words>  
The flute’s tooth marks, he’d learned, were not from a human. <words>8</words>  
A creature of shadow, perhaps, or a memory given form. <words>7</words>  
The label’s address led to a mountain monastery, one erased from maps, its name a whisper in the wind. <words>15</words>  
Elian’s motivation was not vengeance, but to outsmart the dark reflection that haunted his prayers. <words>14</words>  
The gondola’s engine sputtered, and he gripped the label tighter, its creases biting into his palm. <words>14</words>  
The flute’s tooth marks, when analyzed under moonlight, revealed a pattern—a cipher for the past. <words>14</words>  
He’d spent years harvesting fragments of memory, each one a shard of guilt, each one a step toward redemption. <words>15</words>  
The monks had called it madness, this obsession with the unspoken, but Elian’s eyes, sunken and visually unappealing, held a fire they could not extinguish. <words>18</words>  
The gondola lurched, and he stumbled, the label slipping from his grasp. <words>10</words>  
It fluttered into the void, a ghost of purpose, but the flute remained, its tooth marks glowing faintly in the dark. <words>15</words>  
He reached for it, fingers brushing the cold wood, and the melody returned—a song of betrayal, of a life he’d buried. <words>16</words>  
The dark reflection, he realized, was not a stranger. <words>8</words>  
It was the man he’d been before the vows, before the silence. <words>10</words>  
The flute’s tooth marks were his own, a testament to the hunger that had driven him to steal from the past. <words>15</words>  
Elian closed his eyes, the gondola’s creaks merging with the flute’s song, and for the first time, he did not resist the memory. <words>16</words>  
He would not avenge the dead. <words>6</words>  
He would outsmart the reflection, not by erasing it, but by letting it sing. <words>12</words>  
The gondola rose, the mountains shrinking beneath him, and the label, though lost, had done its work. <words>14</words>  
The past, he understood, was not a thing to be harvested, but a mirror to be held up to the self. <words>14</words>  
And in that moment, the monk’s stubbornness became something else—something like grace. <words>13</words>
