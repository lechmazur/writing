<story>I am the navigation instructor for the night schools of Thalassum, our benthic city that hums like a held breath under continents of water. [24]
We built our domes hard and clear after discovering aliens, because their quiet arrival made us see how fragile our surface math and our weathered maps had always been. [53]
They left more questions than comfort, and in their wake the sea turned cathedral, full of somber marvel that pressed and rang through every corridor like filtered bells. [81]
I am balancedly curious, and my motive has not changed since I was a deck child's child: to learn to navigate by starlight, even from beneath this blind and utter weight. [112]
On my desk sits a boat anchor chain link from my father's last trawler, pitted by salt, shaped like an omen and a zero, heavy enough to moor my shaking thoughts. [143]
The aliens taught a method they called edge geometry, where the world is found not in faces or centers but along the joined breaks, the seams where light loses patience and reveals its angles. [177]
Through brine and pressure the stars still speak, they said, if you listen at the edges where refractions knife, where plankton blink like pixels on the rim of a vanished horizon. [208]
We built machines to hear that speech, projectors that unfold the sphere of the sky into rings of moving dark and fire, the work we named unfolded horizons for how it rescued distance from curve. [243]
In class I fit the boat anchor chain link onto the collar of the projector, a perfect circle that remembers storms, and ask my students to watch how a simple ring can scale the world. [278]
As the beam threads the ring, we expand the field slowly, because edge geometry punishes haste, revealing first a halo of grain, then lines, then latitudes of shadow flowing like kelp in a tidal sky. [313]
My best student, Inea, once a fisher on methane vents, breathes as if she will break, and whispers the star names she learned in nursery stories that never expected to be true beneath so much salt. [349]
The council wants to expand our habitation domes into the trench, to braid with geothermal stacks and live longer in the safety of darkness, but I petition to turn some eyes upward and outward. [383]
It is not rebellion, I tell them, only arithmetic of need, because food lines thin and currents take new shapes, and if we cannot trust the surface, we must at least orient by what burns beyond it. [420]
The aliens are gone to somewhere deeper or further, their craft etched like cuttlefish bones in our memory, yet their proof remains: edges are instruments, and the night can be heard even through stone. [454]
So I walk the city with the chain link in my pocket, a cold ring of stubborn metal, and I teach my apprentice pilots to finger the rim and feel how a circle asks for a sky. [491]
We set up our unfolder at the monorail's western terminus, where a dome has cracked and been patched to a scumble that catches light, and we listen for starlight like divers listen for whale song. [526]
The projector hums, the chain link rings softly when it warms, and in the ring a crisp ellipse appears, the limb of a real star translated by water into a living line of exact brightness. [561]
Edge geometry says the edges do not lie, and by measuring their tilt, their shared intersections, we can unfold the sphere, solving orientation without a sky, building bearings from the very shape of loss. [595]
As Inea marks the angles, the map begins to open like a lid, and coordinates spill that align with a pressure gap above the ridge, a corridor to the night, if we are brave and patient. [631]
I draft a route that would take a train of small submersibles up through that time-soft window when the moon's pull and the continental breathing cancel enough to spare us from being snapped like brittle threads. [667]
My petition gains a narrow yes, more a sigh than a cheer, yet the permission tastes like rain, and I feel my father's trawler rise again in the room as if the sea remembers us. [702]
We practice for weeks, adding patience to skill, never letting awe replace caution, teaching our hands to read the ring's edge and the city's hum, until the horizon in our room lies flat as faith. [737]
On the night we go, the domes condense like tears along their ribs, and starlight, cut to filaments by current and glass, sifts through the ring into a chart that one cannot doubt without courting disappearance. [773]
We rise by that chart, slow and careful, enough to spy the surface sky speak, and the city behind us hums farewell like a solemn, answering star. [800]</story>
