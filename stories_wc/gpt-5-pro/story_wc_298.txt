<story>Within the glow of half-lit corridors, I followed the map stitched with soot and breath. [15]
It led me to the catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones, a breathing architecture of memory and debt. [35]
I am a reckless idealist, fiercely gentle in my hands yet stubborn in my vows. [50]
I came to patch holes in the soul, mine and those left whistling through the orchard's ribs. [67]
In my pocket rested a burned tarot card, all edges cindered except the eye looking straight through. [84]
It was the receipt from a market of bartered destinies, the last scrap of my brother's traded future. [102]
The card had survived the flames that turned his path to ash, and it still warmed like a coal. [121]
I traced the fissures with a thumb, inlaying meaning everywhere the fire had eaten certainty. [136]
The Keeper waited beneath a pear tree grafted into a skull's crown, her lantern veiled with moth-worn gauze. [154]
You have come to barter more, she said, or to complain at what you bought with your crying. [172]
Neither, I told her, though the truth stung; I had not bought, I had begged, and the price ran on. [192]
Your market takes destinies, I said, then relearns how to breathe through the holes it makes in people. [210]
I am here to trammel that breath, to bind it where it will do no more harm. [227]
Roots lifted like bristling spines and tried to catch my ankles as if the orchard itself feared interruption. [245]
Fiercely gentle, I knelt and soothed them with the tarry syllables of our family's lullaby. [260]
They remembered the tune and loosened, as if the pears trembled with the weight of forgiving. [276]
The Keeper pressed a palm against the lantern and lowered its light until the grove became a bruise. [294]
Within that dusk, her voice wore resolve like a shawl. [304]
We do not steal, she said; we exchange so the living remember how to choose. [319]
Bartered destinies are stitched from consent and hunger, and the seams hold until someone loves them open. [336]
Teach me where to sew, I answered, because love alone frays, and I came for mending. [352]
She studied the burned tarot card, turned it over, and held its heat against the bark of the pear. [371]
The eye in the card blinked, grateful and startled, and I felt my brother's laugh stumble like a foal. [390]
He had traded his future to spare me from a debt I would have paid without counting. [407]
Reckless idealist that I am, I had believed my courage would be enough to repay any wound. [424]
But courage without a craft is only noise, so I offered my method: inlaying meaning everywhere. [440]
I began to scribe on bone, on root, on air, threading stories like veins through wood, making hollows into harbors. [460]
Every name braided to another, every sorrow given a companion, every bargain given a witness who would not lie. [479]
The orchard quivered as if a fever broke, and the pears exhaled the dust of wasted afternoons. [496]
From the loosened branches, small threads of light fell and clung to the burned tarot card like new roots. [515]
The Keeper whispered, Your brother's path can be regrafted, but the graft will hold only if you accept the scars. [535]
I nodded and let the roots read me, let them learn my failures, so they would not be surprised later. [555]
They asked for a pledge to share breath, and I gave it, promising never again to bargain alone. [573]
The regraft took like morning, slow and stubborn, and then his laugh ran clear, not stumbling, from the card. [592]
He would live with me, not as a shadow but as a braid in the work, a partner in mending. [612]
We left the grove and walked within the glow of half-lit corridors again, holding the card between us like a lantern. [633]
On the walls, I continued inlaying meaning everywhere, not as decoration but as irrigation for the thirsty. [650]
Stories grow where water listens, I told him, and he answered with a humming that sounded like bees in snow. [670]
Behind us, the Keeper raised her lantern and revealed the orchard not as a prison but as a loom. [689]
Threads ran between skull and seed, stitch and star, and I saw how the market began with a prayer to survive. [710]
We cannot undo hunger, the Keeper said, but we can teach it to ask kindly and not devour names. [729]
I promised to return when the pears ripened, to keep watch, to trammel what slithered in as temptation. [747]
Dusky resolve settled in my bones, steady as the roots that once tried to catch me. [763]
The burned tarot card cooled to a leaf's calm, and the eye closed, finally content to dream with us. [782]
There were still holes, but we carried thread, and our hands knew bravery and care together. [798]</story>
