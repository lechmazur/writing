<story>The air tasted of rust and rain, an ethereal grit that polished every breath. [14]
When the storm approaches, the world seems to unspool and rewind in the same shiver. [29]
I waited outside the vine-draped bunker hidden in a rewilded forest, counting the thunder's intervals. [44]
They called me Foresight Hindsight Only, though I preferred the shorter ache of Only. [58]
I had come to discover why some paths choose their walkers, and whether mine still wanted me. [75]
The bunker held a decaying directive, an order issued by a city long vanished into its seed. [92]
That order had been sealed with a wafer seal, sugar-thin yet stubborn as old faith. [107]
I had found its location through interpreted dreams, the kind that stitched warnings to desire. [122]
Each dream mapped the forest in vocals of owls and the slow arithmetic of snail trails. [138]
They showed me a gate of roots and the patient hinge of a hidden door. [153]
They showed me, too, the cost of arriving late. [162]
The directive was failing, its clauses flaking like paint, its voice a choir of fog. [177]
If I could read it before it crumbled, perhaps I could adjust the path beneath me. [193]
If I was too late, the path might discard me like shed bark. [206]
I knocked, softly, and the vines shivered like a dream remembering. [217]
The door gave, and the bunker exhaled a breath stained with moss and archived lightning. [232]
Inside, consoles slept under lichen, their faces cracked but precisely playful in their arrangement. [246]
Someone had set a tiny stone figure to guard a terminal, hands up as if catching rain. [263]
On the central table lay the envelope, brittle as a cicada shell, its wafer seal intact. [279]
The seal bore the city crest, a path spiraling inward, a warning folded into ornament. [294]
I pressed it between my fingers until it cracked with the brittle sweetness of old vows. [310]
Inside, the directive unfurled, not as words, but as a lattice of images and scents. [325]
Rain on copper, smoke in a schoolyard, the taste of salt when a promise turns. [340]
It spoke in the language of memory because the city had known we would outlive its grammar. [357]
I closed my eyes and let the lattice dissolve through me, through interpreted dreams rehearsed and real. [374]
The bunker swayed with the first fists of rain, and I became a pupil to thunder. [390]
In the dream, the path did not lie on the ground but braided itself from my choices. [407]
It chose me when I chose it, a mutual election, a mirror vote cast in movement. [423]
The decaying directive admitted this, its edges curling back to reveal the living braid beneath. [438]
It was not a tyrant order, but a weathered suggestion asking to be rewritten with our steps. [455]
Outside, wind shouldered the trees, and roots answered with creaks like the taking of counsel. [470]
I thought of all the walkers who had come before, whose footprints trained mine like tutors. [486]
I felt the directive asking me to transcend, to step beyond its brittle parameters into partnership. [502]
That request arrived not as glory, but as work: lift, mend, listen, choose, and choose again. [518]
I opened my eyes to the room shaking and the stone figure catching raindrops from the ceiling. [535]
I gathered the fragments of the wafer seal and laid them like a constellation on the table. [552]
Each shard reflected my face in tiny curves, a mosaic of fears and the humor that survives. [569]
I laughed, precisely playful, because laughter steadied my hands as I began to write. [583]
Not on paper, but in footsteps: out the door, into the rain, down the spiral path. [599]
The storm's edge moved with me, as if checking my pace, as if approving the edit. [615]
Dreams rose with the steam from my coat, and I read them like notes on wet glass. [632]
They said the path would meet me halfway only if I left room for it to arrive. [649]
So I slowed, and the mud welcomed my boots with the authority of a clerk stamping documents. [666]
At the forest's bend, I saw others ahead, their silhouettes frayed by rain, their strides hesitating. [682]
They were walkers who had followed similar dreams, and had stopped, undecided on a splitting trail. [698]
I told them the directive had decayed into invitation, and that invitation needed many signatures. [713]
We pressed our heels into the earth like seals, wafer thin in faith, forever in impression. [729]
Together we turned left, not because left was easier, but because the left bent toward mercy. [745]
The bunker lights dimmed behind us, and the vines reknit their modesty like curtains after a play. [762]
The storm applauded with rain, and the path, at last, chose us as we chose it. [778]
In that choosing, I felt my name loosen, Foresight Hindsight Only becoming simply a way to move. [795]</story>
