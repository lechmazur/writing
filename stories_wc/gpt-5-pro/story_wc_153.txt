<story>The tide pushes me into the mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits, where the air tastes like copper and lullabies. [20]
I carry a packet of unsent letters bound with eelgrass, the paper soft from humidity and grief. [37]
I am here to find the moment before deciding, the last hinge of time that did not close when I slammed it. [59]
They say every labyrinth has a keeper, and here it is a cryptic medium whose whisper makes the mangrove roots shiver. [80]
The medium is neither old nor young, eyes navy blue, voice full of silt and patience and fierce tenderness I barely deserve. [102]
She holds a gargoyle's rainspout shard like a saint holds a relic, its broken mouth slick with old storms. [121]
With it she can evoke the rooms we left behind, she tells me, and the windows that waited for our breath. [142]
We step onto an abandoned houseboat stranded among the roots, its panes clouded, its tin roof ticking with fallen leaves. [162]
The spirits sing from the channels, sounding like cousins calling from another room, promising broth if I just come home. [182]
The medium drags the shard across the fogged glass, and messages in condensation on windows begin to gather like swallows. [202]
She asks for one unsent letter, any letter, to flavor the air and lure the memory not with pain but mercy. [223]
I choose the first I wrote to my brother, the one I never mailed after my outburst and his quiet eyes. [244]
We do not read it aloud; we lay it under the shard, and moonlight stencils silver along the shard's teeth. [264]
Your heart heals in moonlight, she says, but only if you hold still long enough for the stitching to find you. [285]
The pane rattles once, and words bloom in the condensation, backward at first, then legible as if the window remembered. [305]
It is a date and a doorway and the exact breath before I chose to leave the hospital room to smoke. [326]
In that breath, the apology waited unspoken, and now the boat becomes the space where an apology waits unspoken, wide as tide. [348]
The medium nods to the door, saying we can step into it if we do not demand to change it. [368]
We step, and the world tilts, mangrove turning to hallway, river to fluorescent hush, and my brother asleep with a child's frown. [390]
I smell antiseptic and orange peels and rain, and the singing spirits keep singing, because even hospitals let songs pass. [410]
I am here to find the moment before deciding, not to revise it or bargain, but to witness what I missed. [431]
She says, evoke it, and I do, calling up my hunger, my small rebellion, my fear of weeping in front of him. [453]
The apology gathers between us like clouded glass; in that fog, letters string together from a language our throats never learned. [474]
He stirs, opens one eye, and I feel the ache in him like tide under a pier, relentless and faithful. [494]
My hand on the doorframe finds a splinter, and the pain steadies me, an oar jammed against the current of escape. [515]
The medium breathes, fierce tenderness in her syllables, and says the moment before deciding is the only place choice is gentle. [536]
I do not smoke; I stay, and the apology does not need words, because his fingers curl toward mine like roots. [557]
The moon touches our foreheads through no window I can see, and the break in me begins to stitch. [576]
The mangrove labyrinth folds back around us when the breath ends, the boat rocking as if acknowledging a trade fairly made. [597]
I leave the letter under the window, no longer unsent, simply unnecessary, its paper relieved of work it was not born to do. [620]
The medium says the boat will keep it until the tide forgets us, and that forgetting is a kind of blessing. [641]
I tell her I still do not know what to do tomorrow, and she says tomorrow is not the moment before deciding. [663]
She says go home while the moon knows your name, because what heals in moonlight holds best by morning. [682]
In the space where an apology waits unspoken, I learn patience, and in patience, I learn to carry tenderness like a blade. [704]</story>
