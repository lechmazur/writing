<story>It begins after the mirror cracks in my rented room above the quay. [13]
I am the nostalgic quay painter, both witness and custodian of fading glints. [26]
The crack spidered from my forehead in the reflection and kept going. [38]
I took it as a sign, not of bad luck, but deadline. [50]
There was a hidden promise I had made to myself years back. [62]
I had sworn to find a place where paint could hold time. [74]
Not forever, just long enough, a kind of temporary eternity I could bear. [87]
People called me friendly and distant, a contradiction I wore like salt. [99]
I preferred intimately aloof, close in texture, far in claim. [109]
What I could love, I loved through surfaces, water, and paint. [120]
The caves north of the harbor had always whispered that kind of promise. [133]
Fishermen avoided them at high tide, but I knew low labyrinth hours. [145]
I packed a lamp, brushes, and the smallest canvas I owned. [156]
I also slipped in a seashell, painted long ago with a tiny quay. [169]
My mother had admired it, said it hummed like a fingertip on glass. [182]
When the mirror cracked, the shell glittered in the drawer like a teacher. [195]
I left the rented room, locked it, and walked along the sleeping boats. [208]
Rain kept to the offshore line, as if the horizon were a leash. [221]
The path to the cliffs had changed with winter collapses and new stairs. [234]
I took an old descent and found the first throat of the coastal cave network. [249]
Inside, the air held brine and sleeping fire, the lamp hardly a match. [262]
But my feet remembered grooves, the way an oar remembers its oarlock. [274]
I walked until the map in my head failed at a flooded split. [287]
There, a wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis, I had once heard. [300]
So I took the wrongness by the sleeve and went left. [311]
The floor rose, the water lowered, and the light changed to olive. [323]
The cavity opened onto a chamber with sand, trickling falls, and a pool. [336]
A slit in the ceiling drew a blade of day across the water. [349]
It was quiet and breathing, a hidden oasis stitching tide to stone. [361]
I set the lamp on a ledge and unfolded canvas and brushes. [373]
My hands shook, not from fear, but from recognition finally exceeding patience. [385]
I rinsed the seashell, painted surface catching green light like fishscale. [396]
I balanced it on a stone and began to mark the cave. [408]
Not the shapes, not the facts, but the duration between ripples and drip. [421]
Each stroke was a small wager against the erasures of tide and time. [434]
I painted the pool as if it could hold me, then pass me. [447]
That was the promise I had hidden, to be held and released. [459]
Temporary eternity is the only honest refuge a mortal craft can frame. [471]
I worked until the slit in the ceiling thinned to a silver hair. [484]
Then I took the shell and set it afloat on the pool. [496]
It spun like a small moon, the painted quay turning past my face. [509]
I whispered to my reflection, now fluid, that I had kept my promise. [522]
The pool answered with a breath that fogged the lamp glass, then cleared. [535]
In that clearing, the cave decided to reveal a stranger beneath my face. [548]
He was me without the harbor, without paint, but with bare eyes. [560]
He looked intimately aloof too, as if day knew him only by rumor. [573]
We nodded, and our ripples crossed, and then he went elsewhere. [584]
I signed the canvas with salt water and tucked it by the ledge. [597]
The tide would decide if it stayed, which felt fair to me. [609]
I blew out the lamp and carried the shell in my pocket. [621]
Walking back, the turns remembered me, as if the caves were satisfied now. [634]
At the mouth, the rain had reached shore, but the boats still slept. [647]
From my pocket I felt the shell pulse, not magic, just memory aligning. [660]
The cracked mirror would be waiting, but I no longer needed it. [672]
I had another surface that could briefly hold me and let me go. [685]
Back at the room, I faced the fracture and set the shell down. [698]
Light from the harbor climbed the wall like a tide seeking my canvas. [711]
The painting from the cave still dampened the air with mineral breath. [723]
I opened the window, and the noise of gulls braided with the rain. [736]
Something in me unmoored, but not to drift, only to anchor elsewhere. [748]
Temporary eternity, I wrote on the back of the canvas, and dated it. [761]
One day the sea would reclaim it, and that was the point. [773]
Until then, I would keep painting water into breathable walls. [783]
I would remain intimately aloof, close enough to hear tides move the heart. [796]</story>
