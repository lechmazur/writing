<story>We lived on an Orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, where trees leaned to listen to stone. [18]
Azure defiance colored the morning, a blue resolve that refused collapse even as gravity stuttered. [33]
I was a meek blacksmith by trade, quietly determined to fix what others called inevitable breakage. [49]
Between understanding and confusion, the arches drew lower each week, and apples ripened with anxious blushes. [65]
The elders argued to wait; I chose to deliberate beside the forges and the roots. [80]
In a drawer lay Magician's silk, a ribbon gifted by a wanderer who said it remembered every hand. [98]
It caught light like water and held it like a promise, strong enough to mind broken edges. [115]
On our world, repairs sometimes needed Bartered awakenings, trades of memory or comfort to rouse sleeping mechanisms and mineral will. [135]
The magician had taught me the prices, whispering that stone liked songs more than orders. [150]
Using abandoned mine shafts as wind organs, I could coax a hum through the arches and wake their memory of holding. [171]
I tied the silk around my wrist and gathered tools, a lamp, bread, and an old bell of brass. [190]
My movements were deliberate, and my fear a quiet animal that understood work better than panic. [206]
At the shaft mouth, the orchard's scent thinned into cold iron, and the blue above narrowed to a coin. [225]
I struck the bell once, a note that slipped into the tunnels like a patient bird. [241]
The shafts had carried miners before me, and their carts had worn the floors into remembering grooves. [258]
I fed the lamp and thought of apples bruised by falling pebbles, and of children learning new paths under drift. [278]
The first arch anchor had cracked, leaving rubble that clattered around the notion of being useless. [294]
I knelt and wrapped the crack with Magician's silk, fingers steady though my heart counted possibilities like nails. [312]
When I tugged, the ribbon held the stones as if making them remember their agreement to be arch. [330]
Still, the rock would not wake until I paid, and that is where bartering begins to ache. [347]
I offered the sound of a winter evening at the forge, and the arch answered with a settling sigh. [366]
Rubble around the base shivered, then assigned itself into dovetails, as if choosing to be more than fragments. [384]
To coax resilience from rubble, I hummed the bell's tune and let the silk translate stubbornness into grip. [402]
In the second shaft, I found an old hoist asleep, its gears sunk in dust like thoughtful turtles. [420]
I brushed the cogs and whispered that I would trade a name I almost wore, the surname never spoken. [439]
The hoist woke, old joints creaking fragrant as oil, and lifted a broken beam into helpful alignment. [456]
Halfway back, a tremor shrugged the mountain, and powder drift fell like white moths disturbed from sleep. [473]
I pressed my body to the wall, Deliberate in breathing, counting to keep panic from inflecting the song. [491]
When it quieted, I tied lines of silk across a fault, and the arches stopped slouching toward the orchards. [510]
Outside, people gathered under the blue as if awaiting a verdict; the air was a court of whispers. [528]
No one asked for thanks, and I did not offer talk, for my barter had thinned my voice to thread. [548]
Yet in their eyes I saw Azure defiance mirrored, a color that said we would not be simplified to rubble. [568]
I returned underground, using abandoned mine shafts to breathe a chorus through the planet's ribs all afternoon. [585]
The third anchor demanded a greater tithe, and I offered the echo of laughter I kept from childhood. [603]
It was a fair trade, for the arch stood proud after, shouldering storms like an elder that finally remembered. [622]
By dusk the orchards exhaled relief and the floating rock grew polite, drifting in measured ellipses. [638]
We were still an orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, but the phrase no longer sounded like a threat. [658]
It sounded like a place I could make by hand, one deliberate hour at a time. [674]
People called me meek blacksmith still, and I let it rest like iron cooling in sand. [690]
Truth is I was quietly determined, and the arches had heard that truth in every blow I once held back. [710]
Now the trees will teach the children to listen for held breath in stone, and I will keep listening too. [730]
We live somewhere between understanding and confusion, but that somewhere is enough to keep the sky from falling. [748]
And if the silk frays, the bell will still sing, and so will the work my hands remember. [766]</story>
