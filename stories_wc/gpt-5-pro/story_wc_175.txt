<story>I came to the verdant grotto above the clouds before dawn, when even silence held a blush. [17]
The world hovered in blushing stillness, as if the light were practicing restraint. [30]
I am an esoteric realist, which means I believe in a grammar of winds and the honesty of weight. [49]
I had come to honor overlooked histories, ones written on the backs of insects and the undersides of leaves. [68]
It was during the migration of the last monarch butterfly, and the sky felt like a library closing. [86]
I had one task: build what the air could read. [96]
I practice building temporary structures as signals, the old craft taught by those who listened more than they spoke. [115]
Each frame would be transiently rooted, anchored just enough to sing before surrendering to weather. [130]
I packed reeds, twine, stones, and a single moth wing sealed in glass. [143]
The wing was from a moth that died against my window last autumn, uncelebrated, speckled like a whisper. [161]
I took it as a ledger, proof that even the dim can write light. [175]
At the lip of the grotto, the clouds moved like sleeping herds, shifting but not waking. [191]
I listened for the interrupted cadence that would announce the monarch. [202]
In the old seasons, there was thunder made of millions of delicate choices. [215]
Now the rhythm had a skip stitched into it, a hush where a wing used to be. [232]
I began with a triangle of reeds, lashed by twine and patience. [244]
I knelt to knot the first junction tight, breathing to the slow drum of moss. [259]
The triangle faced south, its shadow pointing toward ancestral routes erased by heat and hunger. [274]
I built a second frame, a circle with a broken lip to acknowledge the wound. [289]
Between them I strung thin lines of twine that the wind could pluck. [302]
When the air moved, the frames made a music of absence, a score of what was missing. [319]
Signals, yes, but also a remembering. [325]
I placed the glass vial holding the moth wing at the apex, a small sun for someone who flies by night. [346]
Moths taught us that darkness has its own grammar, softer but exact. [358]
Butterflies taught us to gather in color until the world agreed to change. [371]
I trusted both lessons because I was raised by workers whose names never made the stones. [387]
They knew that to honor overlooked histories is to arrange attention itself. [399]
So I aligned the reeds to the cardinal axes and to gossiping eddies over the cliff. [415]
A hush deepened, the hush that is a bridge between beats. [426]
I heard a wingbeat, then the missing answer, then a single wingbeat again. [439]
He arrived as a petal burning, the last monarch, his orange stained by journeys my maps cannot hold. [457]
He circled the frames and hovered, reading what the air wrote through my hands. [471]
I did not reach for him; I only steadied the triangle with a finger. [485]
The twine thrummed, and the breeze translated grief into a navigable map. [497]
He rested on the lip of the circle that admits its break. [509]
We waited through three breaths, the grotto brightening like a face that hears its name. [524]
I thought of my grandmother learning to read from labels on seed sacks, the only books allowed. [541]
Her schooling was an interrupted cadence, but she made a song anyway, which I sing with my hands. [559]
The monarch lifted, and I tilted the triangle to spill a current toward the east. [574]
I watched him ride it, careful not to make a god of guidance. [587]
I only wanted him to know that someone had kept the porch light on. [601]
He returned for a moment, brushing the moth wing through the glass with feet like commas. [617]
He paused at the break in the circle as if choosing to step into a sentence. [633]
Then he went, a flame ceding itself to distance without a sound. [645]
I collapsed the frames, but not the memory, and laid the twine like lines in a palm. [662]
The structures had been transiently rooted and were ready to be returned to soil and rumor. [678]
Signals are not monuments; they live only long enough to be believed. [690]
I cupped the glass again, the moth wing shining like an erased letter remembering its name. [706]
I promised to keep building temporary structures as signals as long as wind can read. [721]
Not to capture, not to command, but to accompany whatever still dares to move. [735]
The blushing stillness returned after his departure, more tender for the passage. [747]
Clouds swam below like slow fish, and the grotto exhaled green into the high air. [762]
I left a final knot on a root, small as a vow, and began the descent. [778]
If anyone passes here, the story will move inside them, steadying the breaks. [791]
And if no one comes, the wind remembers us. [800]</story>
