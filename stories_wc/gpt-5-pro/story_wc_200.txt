<story>I arrived at echo gorge in the hush of a hidden sunrise, carrying my sorrow-lit tools. [16]
As a lost soul collector, I was modestly fearless, or just practiced at keeping still. [31]
The gorge opened like a throat of stone, layered with whispers nobody had the patience to finish. [48]
I set the misaligned harp against a flat rock where the river forgot its roar. [63]
Its strings refused perfect intervals, but I needed their stubborn wobble more than any flawless pitch. [79]
I plucked, and the gorge answered with spectral confessions, like mist finding the shapes of former faces. [96]
They unrolled their lonely jokes, half laughs cut off by flood, famine, betrayal, and the respectable ache of routine. [115]
I had come for one laugh in particular, a thread rumored to stitch wounds while stinging like salt. [133]
The story said it was hiding inside the drowners' choir, unwilling to forgive, unwilling to be silent. [150]
To reach it, I would pursue the sound that refused me, even if it ran into thunder. [167]
I tuned further away from correctness, guiding the search through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp. [184]
Each sour resonance opened another seam in the air, and memories poured like coarse light. [199]
A fisher confessed he baited storms with promises he could never keep, and still the river took pity. [217]
A mother admitted she pretended the flood was a carnival so her children would not scream. [233]
Their spectral confessions were treasures and burdens, gleaming as they bruised, a luminous ache no hands could carry. [251]
I took out the crocodile's tooth from my pocket, its enamel crazed like sun on broken water. [268]
It had belonged to an old ferryman who swore the crocodile laughed as it let him live. [285]
He said the tooth remembered that laugh and could bite open the seam where healing begins. [301]
I used it as a jagged plectrum, and the harp answered with a ripple the gorge recognized. [318]
The drowners' choir rose, a thin silver of sound like grass singing beneath ice. [332]
Somewhere within that blade of music, the laugh flickered, a panicked lamp, small yet indestructible. [347]
It fled from me, from everyone, a clever fox that survived by doubting kindness. [361]
I pursued it by detuning further, letting dissonance unveil the pathways that smooth songs erased. [376]
The air brightened like milk poured into tea, and shadows began to show their skeletons. [391]
I asked the laugh why it ran, and it answered in a tremor: because joy had hurt before. [409]
I sat, modestly fearless, because fear has its manners when the sun is still negotiating dawn. [425]
I told the laugh my reason: to integrate laughter into healing, not as garnish, but medicine. [441]
I offered a bargain the gorge could witness, clear as frost: I would share my worst memory first. [459]
The harp trembled as I drew the crocodile's tooth across its emptiest string, and it opened. [475]
I spoke of the day I refused a drowning man, telling myself the current was stronger than my arms. [494]
I admitted I watched his hat spin away like a moon that forgot everything it lit. [510]
Then I told the part I had hidden, how his widow laughed once in my doorway out of sheer exhaustion. [530]
It was the cruelest and kindest sound, a rope thrown to air, a rope that held nobody. [547]
I said I wanted that laugh back, taught to do more than wound; I wanted it to mend. [565]
The gorge hummed, and the drowners' choir folded their water-soaked tongues, making room for the sly light. [582]
The laugh stepped closer, clumsy as a colt, tasting the idea that limbs could move without defense. [599]
I changed the rhythm to a skipping gait, and the harp limped along, learning to trust its wound. [617]
Together we began to laugh, not at pain, but alongside it, like tying a scarf against windburn. [634]
The spectral confessions brightened, gaining ribs and wrists, learning that oxygen and sorrow can share a chair. [651]
The drowners clapped their wet hands in a rhythm that never punished, a gentle hazard for survival. [668]
I slid the crocodile's tooth back into my pocket and promised the ferryman his debt was singing interest. [686]
The sun finally discovered us, and the hidden sunrise quit hiding, and I quit apologizing for staying alive. [704]
I gathered the harp, still pleasantly wrong, and felt the gorge echo inside my ribs like fresh rafters. [722]
There would be other souls to pursue, and I would meet them with this new companionable ache. [739]
It shone without burning, an ember that could warm both confession and joke, and call it living. [756]
At the rim I looked back and bowed, because respect is lighter than guilt and far more durable. [774]
The laugh followed like a small river under my tongue, promising to flood when needed and stay when not. [793]</story>
