After the drawbridge rises, I cross by skiff toward the submerged pavilion, where the city's forgotten breath steams through fissures. [20]
Night here never shouts; it kindles a hushed blaze that climbs the algae to mark the hours on stone. [39]
I am the firm shore surveyor assigned to the drowning edge, stoically sensitive to the hairline tremors of silt and memory. [60]
The bridge lifting leaves me alone with the tide's mind, and its mind is archival, precise, and almost kind. [79]
I come not only to measure but to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams, beginning with my own. [97]
The pavilion was once an orchestra of weddings, markets, and small betrayals; now its arches practice interlaced absence. [115]
Columns rise from water like interrupted thoughts, and between them I map cracks as if they were sentences that forgot their nouns. [137]
My method is plain and patient, placing notes in foundation repairs, because the future loves what the present nearly lost. [157]
Paper crinkles within mortar beds, a small heartbeat sealed under weight, waiting for a stranger to lean close and listen. [177]
Tonight I carry an antique traveling inkwell, brass hinged, rescued from a box of dredged coins and briny buttons. [196]
It belonged to a surveyor before me, the initials S.G. etched faint as rain on shell. [212]
When I unscrew its lip and smell the tarnished ink, I hear measured breaths, a lineage of watchfulness. [230]
I fill it with midnight and river silt, stir with a nail, and write on fibers cut from tide charts. [250]
This is not vandalism, I tell myself; it is the making of a catalog the water cannot easily rewrite. [269]
Men with lanterns have finished the day's patching, and the scaffolding hums with weak heat like sleeping bees. [287]
After the drawbridge rises, they go, and I step where their boots left lattices of mud on the bricks. [306]
The tide has dropped to the waist of the columns, offering a breathing hour to slip my words into the cures. [327]
I pry at a seam the masons left shy, and wrest the loosened stone just enough to open a pocket. [347]
Within, I set a folded note that recalls a woman drifting through markets with oranges cupped like suns in her sleeves. [368]
Then I seal it with lime and patience, tracing the line with my thumb until the join disappears from sight. [388]
I move to another wound, and write of a trumpeter practicing under this roof at dawn, when gulls negotiated the salt. [409]
The pavilion seemed to float then too, he thought, balanced on breath and applause, both already half departed. [427]
I am stoically sensitive, or so my supervisor wrote on the form, meaning I stand without tremor while taking tremors in. [448]
The water returns with the certainty of a signature, and its touch praises and erases, as any faithful reader might do. [469]
I tuck another message where a pipe once sang; it is about the smell of wet linen and nettles. [488]
If anyone reads these one day, the interlaced absence of this place will show as a fabric, not a void. [508]
Absence interlaces with presence like rivers with banks, and I, a stitcher, try to guide the current's needle. [526]
From a ledge I lift a small iron plaque, encrusted with barnacles, its screws turning like teeth reluctant to confess. [546]
Beneath, a cavity as neat as a purse holds a chalked line and the ghost of handwriting I cannot fully trace. [567]
I pull the inkwell closer, and for a moment, the initials S.G. glow like a signal from the bedrock. [586]
Perhaps S.G. wrote here before me, placing notes in foundation repairs to apprentice the future toward attention. [603]
I answer by writing of bridges, how they rise to spare their spines and leave us to ferry ourselves inward. [623]
I add that I measure shores because measure is a kind of praise that refuses to look away. [641]
When I press the final note into wet mortar, my fingers burn pleasantly, a quiet oath sealed under grit. [660]
Above me, algae flutter like patient pennants, and below, old water holds its tongue as if schooling itself to remember. [680]
I close the inkwell, breathe the mineral dark, and feel the city acknowledge from its foundations that I have joined its memory. [702]
The skiff taps the steps as tide begins to lift, and my work glows unseen like coals under river glass. [722]
I leave the pavilion to its drowned rehearsals, content that my notes will surface as questions in someone else's daylight. [742]
After the drawbridge rises again tomorrow, others will pass beneath, but the interlaced absence we stitched will hold firm. [761]
I will keep rowing back, a steady ember with callused hands, until I am less man than listening notation. [780]
