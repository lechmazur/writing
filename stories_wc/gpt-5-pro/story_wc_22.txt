<story>After the reef dies, the blooming jetty at twilight becomes my station and my shrine. [15]
I am the gloom-hill coachman, unhorsed by tide and years, steering memory now. [28]
My routes once climbed funeral switchbacks, but the passengers kept disembarking as names on stones. [43]
When the living reef whitened and fell apart, the coastal road ended like a breath. [58]
In the hush that followed, I learned to listen sideways, in a narrow vastness. [72]
The birds wrote paragraphs above the tide-line, and I taught myself to read them. [86]
By understanding bird calls, I mapped the buried iron, the salt veins, the hidden wells of shade. [103]
Every cry told me where sweetness could root, and where rot would drink it dry. [118]
I keep a collection of dried seed pods in the old trunk once used for luggage. [134]
They rattle like rosaries, each a patient syllable waiting for its place in the sentence of soil. [151]
I speak dead languages to them, and they answer with small husk-breathed vows. [164]
Etruscan for smoke, Akkadian for floodplain, scraps of Latin for omen, all meant for sprouts and silt. [181]
It is not magic, only grammar of what has fallen silent and needs gentling. [195]
I have a task: to let a garden reclaim a battlefield, and to make it remember peace. [212]
Here the scuffle once snapped moorings, and bullets pecked the planks like impatient gulls. [226]
The surf has swallowed the flags, but the seabed still remembers formations in rust. [240]
Submerged concord was promised in a treaty nobody signed, written between coral spurs and mangrove roots. [256]
When the reef died, the signature dissolved, and the war kept marching in long salt. [271]
So I park my coach by the fenders of hibiscus and lantern-weed, wheels sainted with pollen. [287]
Twilight pulls the harbor narrow, but the horizon keeps speaking in a voice as wide as sleep. [304]
The birds begin their ledger, and I read it aloud like a psalm for broken pylons. [320]
Tern says iron here, gull says alkaline there, heron mutters soft shade under the guttered boat. [336]
I set a pod where the tern taps, and I crush coral to fertilize the lean runnels. [353]
Dead reef to feed the living shore; fallen bone to brace a sprout with remembering. [368]
Every handful is counted, because grammar punishes waste, and soil is stern about declensions. [382]
I have learned that harmony is a patient sentence, mostly commas, rarely a period. [396]
When I misread a trill, the seedlings sulk, and the gull laughs with a thief's throat. [412]
But when the calls align, the pods open like quiet bells, and the scent walks. [427]
Saplings of sea-lavender shoulder up through flint, and mangrove seedlings grip their future with green knuckles. [443]
I speak again, this time in a dead port-argot that bargemen left carved into bollards. [458]
The syllables taste of pitch and brine, and the planks seem to lean closer to listen. [474]
I tell them the fighting is over, though the paperwork drowned, and the minutes blurred to foam. [491]
I ask the jetty to carry this submerged concord, to hold the peace underfoot until roots prove it. [509]
The birds sign their portions, one in wing-breath, one in a neat ink of guano. [524]
I witness, and I carry it in the coach, where the leather seats have learned to cradle seedlings. [542]
At dusk a veteran limps to me, asking fares like he once asked orders. [556]
I offer him a pod instead, stamped with the cipher of his regiment, in the old tongue. [573]
He cracks it in his palm, and the scent fells him to quiet tears. [587]
Plant it where you bled, I say, and the heron will define the shade for you. [603]
He nods, and the gull approves with a scratch of comic approval upon the rail. [618]
We work until the color of the evening matches the bruises we no longer carry. [633]
I speak to the mud in an alphabet of footprints, and the mud replies with shoots. [649]
Somewhere beneath us the reef keeps sifting into powder, changing its body into grammar for roots. [665]
The tides recite, the wind translates, and the birds annotate, and I drive the silence homeward. [681]
There is a narrow vastness to this work, a corridor of ocean opening inside a seed. [697]
I travel it nightly, the blooming jetty at twilight lengthening underfoot, ferrying us into tomorrow. [712]
And when the concord finally surfaces, it will sound like wings and oars sharing a pace. [728]
We will read it together, and the garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise. [745]</story>
