<story>At midnight I am the celestial signal interpreter for the university radio station, and nobody else volunteers. [17]
The city around campus holds its breath as the community divides over what we broadcast. [32]
Some claim angels, some claim criminals, some claim pranksters, but I hear tricksters wearing vacuum for boots. [49]
Their voices arrive as a thin frost across the noise floor, bright and ruthless and laughing. [65]
I am cautiously hopeful because I remember something old tech people forget, that listening builds leverage. [81]
The antenna tower hums like a spine, and the studio smells of dust, coffee, and solder. [97]
On my desk I keep astronomical charts grimed with fingerprints and grease from the turntable bearings. [113]
They map not just constellations but the drift of signal impurities that ride the ionosphere like thieves. [130]
The charts tell me when to open the gate valve, when to hold, when to speak. [146]
The tricksters prefer windows after midnight during the second hour of the graveyard shift. [160]
They probe our town with riddles that sound like meteor scatter, then whisper suggestions that sound like truth. [178]
Students turn against professors, professors against administrators, administrators against the station, and donors against everyone. [193]
Power plays multiply like mold in the vents, dank and inevitable, soft at first then choking. [209]
I use the station's outdated synthesis rack to shape the only reply that might matter. [224]
If they live on attention, I will interfere not with silence but with form. [238]
Our transmitter can speak through subsonic frequencies, the kind you feel in ribs, soles, and teeth. [254]
Not music, not noise, but a scaffold of pulses shaped by those stained astronomical charts. [269]
I aim the scaffold at frequencies where their laughter turns brittle, where their riddles blur and dummy out. [287]
To outwit cosmic tricksters you cannot rage, you must make them notice their own breath. [302]
I recruit a night custodian who plays bass, a shy acoustics grad, and a DJ with steady hands. [320]
We tune the studio couches as dampers and stack milk crates into resonant labyrinths along the walls. [337]
Outside, the quad hosts vigils and shouting and whispers and drums, because division needs a festival mask. [354]
Rumors say the administration will sell the license, and another rumor says armed patriots will occupy the booth. [372]
The tricksters adore this, because power plays are their habitat, the bruised fruit where they lay eggs. [389]
My charts predict a quiet patch near dawn when the moon skims a node over our valley. [406]
We set an alarm, boil coffee that tastes like pennies, and wait with headphones pressing our crowns. [423]
Outside the glass, the community divides itself into barricades of signs and stares, each campsite certain and lonely. [441]
Inside, breath fogs the mixer, and the bass player tunes a string until it moans like weather. [458]
When the clock salts the hour, the riddles return, no words this time, only suggestion shaped like surrender. [476]
They try to pivot our station into a mirror for the worst intentions on campus. [491]
I click the patch bay, feed the subsonic scaffold under a hymn of static, and breathe with it. [509]
The room vibrates in our bones, not loud, just undeniable, like finding a river under floorboards. [525]
Listeners call saying nothing, then crying a little, then saying they found their own wrists again. [541]
The tricksters squeal, and the squeal scans as many small denials braided into a rope that snaps. [558]
They push back, sending a sudden wave of dissonance that shakes the tower and trips the breakers. [575]
The campus police show at the door with flashlights, and the provost stands behind them, frowning. [591]
He says the station is causing unrest, that we must stop or be stopped, his eyes two shutters. [609]
I nod, because power plays need an audience, then hand the provost a set of soft headphones. [626]
He listens, and the subsonics slow his pulse, and he remembers that radios are bridges, not guns. [643]
We throw the breakers back and catch the dawn node exactly, just as the charts drew with greasy stars. [662]
The tricksters try one last gambit, a promise shaped like applause, but it evaporates in the scaffolded air. [680]
Where they nested, I sense a vacancy filling with breath, and outside the barricades loosen into conversations. [697]
The bass player laughs and cries at once, the acoustics grad traces the waveforms like vines. [713]
The custodian opens the door, lets the morning in, lets the provost exit with a nod and a grin. [732]
We leave the scaffold humming for another hour, because healing is slower than harm and tastes stranger. [749]
As the sun slides up the tower, I fold the astronomical charts and wipe grease from my fingers. [767]
I stay cautiously hopeful, not naive, because tricksters will return, but we have learned to breathe together. [784]
That is my ethic, ethereal grit, keeping bridges singing even during storms. [796]</story>
