<story>It begins after remembering becomes painful, when memory grows teeth and chews through sleep. [14]
I climb to the labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain, because I need to understand the shape of home. [33]
The air weeps with hidden thunder, as if the rocks are full of distant storms learning my name. [51]
At the gate stands the mercury-glass seer, skin reflecting me in ripples, eyes cloudy as silvered mirrors. [68]
He says the map I carry is wrong, and that maps are only apologies for rooms we have not yet claimed. [89]
He substitutes reality nightly, he confides, trading aisles like constellations, curating time as though it were a shelf of spines. [109]
To enter, I offer what I fear the most: last year's key and the address I no longer dare pronounce. [129]
The door opens with a sigh that seems ashamed of how much it remembers. [143]
Inside, corridors braid and unbraid, staircases loop like handwriting, and every step writes a question my feet cannot read. [162]
We seek the lost language stone, he says, because only its grammar can describe a house without burning its thresholds. [182]
He teaches me to listen for buried talents, the quiet instruments I smothered with busyness, grief, and borrowed weather. [201]
He tells me to seed the journey with promises I can keep, small true words placed like lanterns for the return. [222]
We seed the shelves with whispers, a string of maybes that might congeal into a path if I am gentle. [242]
The aisles smell of glue, ash, and rain, and the books murmur like a choir rehearsing under a collapsed sky. [262]
Every room I pass reformats me, drawing my outline fresh, pencil over pencil, as the mountain reconsiders its own silhouette. [282]
I ask what price the stone will ask, and the seer weighs the silence like a coin that will not fit any purse. [305]
He says the price is the difference between shelter and hiding, and that I have paid it for years without receipt. [326]
We arrive at a rotunda where the floor is an atlas made of unreadable skin, and north refuses to stay. [346]
There, under a glass cloche, rests the lost language stone, dark as a drowned ember, veined with minuscule storms. [365]
I cannot touch it yet, he warns, because meaning bites, and you bleed stories that will not stop once the vein is opened. [388]
How do we read it, I ask, and he produces a black feather, oily and soft, from the sleeve of a twilight he wears. [412]
We will read via the texture of a feather, he says, because the stone mistrusts eyes and only trusts what brushes without hunger. [435]
He guides my hand, and the vane greets the surface like rain remembering a drought, hatching tiny pavements of sensation. [455]
Letters lift as temperature, syntax as wind, and I begin to hear rooms as climates, corridors as migrating birds. [474]
The stone speaks a geometry of pulse, edges as breathing, rooftops as skins that grow thicker when names are shouted. [494]
In that speech I find the outline I could never hold, the shape of home as something that unfolds rather than encloses. [516]
I realize my buried talents are not skills but permissions, the right to arrive, to make a chair, to bless a stair. [538]
The seer lets go of my wrist, and the feather keeps moving, as if my hand learned the weather of belonging. [559]
Hidden thunder dialogs under the floor, not warning us but urging, and the mountain shivers like an animal learning trust. [579]
I ask the seer where he learned to substitute reality, and his face flickers with the sadness of an unstruck match. [600]
He answers that mercury glass raised him on reflections, so he learned to replace what vanished without breaking it. [619]
He repeats that every night he substitutes reality, so the aisles do not harden into yesterday's mistakes. [636]
Then he asks for an offering not made of memory, and points at the cloche and my uncertain breath. [655]
I place a seed of breath there, one counted inhale wrapped in a counted exhale, unstoried and steady. [673]
The stone warms; the feather listens; the mountain reshapes a small room that opens like a palm. [690]
In it, home is not an address but a practice, a chair I am allowed to make and keep. [709]
I leave carrying the feather, promising to seed every threshold with welcome until doors forget how to stay afraid. [728]</story>
