<story>The elevator rattled within an icebound spire above the clouds, its cage creaking like a winter throat clearing for a whispered confession. [22]
We had ten floors to go, and I promised myself to finish before dawn, as the elevator climbs ten floors in brittle increments. [45]
I was the ascending servant to Madam Vire, neither noble nor free, but trusted with her errands and the private weather of her moods. [69]
She liked that I was warmly inquisitive, yet capable of affectionate detachment, the way a lantern warms a cabin without singeing the maps. [92]
On this climb, she had left me the airship captain's goggles, brass ribs jointed like insect legs, lenses smoked and rimed with salt from old crossings. [118]
They were not a trophy but a tool, she said, and I was to deliver them and nothing else to the archivist at the summit. [143]
On the second floor, the cage shuddered, and a leather notebook slipped from the lining of the goggles case, an encrypted diary discovery no one had intended for me. [172]
I felt the guilty tremor a string feels when plucked by a ghost, then steadied myself by closing my eyes until the car found its breath. [198]
Curiosity is a cousin to service, and my service was to keep harm from Madam Vire, even if that meant opening what I should not. [223]
I angled the notebook toward the bulb in the ceiling, but the pages were blind, a field of snow without tracks to follow. [246]
Then I noticed the goggles' lenses catching the bulb's glare and breaking it into a mild halo, a hint that the words might unfold through scattered light. [273]
I slipped them on, their weight unfamiliar, and tilted the notebook until the letters rose like frost ferns warmed by a distant hearth. [296]
Ink that had been stalled came alive, not in lines, but in constellations, as if the writer believed sentences should be navigated, not marched. [320]
The first message named a date I knew, the week Madam Vire fell silent after her wedding and dismissed musicians with polite nods like beheadings. [345]
The second sketched a map of the spire's inner ribs, a path not to treasure, but to a room designed for forgetting. [367]
By the time the cage clanged past the third floor marker, I understood the diary was hers, written under a name only two people would recognize. [393]
She must have put it in the case with those goggles in a storm of nerves, or perhaps by design, trusting that I could read her without trespass. [421]
Her words were not pleas, but field notes on sorrow, a survey of ravines and lifts, written to seek out the joy beneath anguish like miners trace veins. [449]
I loved her, I think, in the way a bell loves the wind that wakes it, with limits and with ringing, and with a vow to turn away. [477]
Affectionate detachment is not a contradiction when your labor is someone else's weather, and your heart is a cup catching only what overflows. [500]
Fourth floor, fifth; cables sang; the spire knocked its old knuckles; the letters gathered again, and I learned which room she used the day the storm took him. [528]
He was an airship captain, and these were his goggles, a tepid relic to the city, but an altar stone to her breathing. [551]
The sixth floor chimed, and I finally understood the delivery: she wanted the archivist to lock the goggles away, so seeing would no longer be the axis of her grief. [581]
Yet she had left the diary for me to read under light, a last kindness, or a test of whether my questions could be warm without becoming a fire. [610]
At the seventh floor, the car stopped sudden as a bird hitting glass, and the snow beyond the shaft windows burst into error and lace. [635]
I thought of closing the notebook, of obeying, yet the letters continued to rise, requesting a witness who would not fix, not solve, not judge. [660]
Eighth floor ticked past while I traced the map's path with a thumb, feeling the tower's cold through its boards as if touching her pulse. [685]
Ninth came with a groan, and the diary's last page offered a simple instruction: leave the goggles and this book inside the forgetter room, then breathe out three names. [714]
When the tenth bell rang, the doors opened to a corridor rimed with hoarfrost, and my breath drifted like pale thread toward an unlit keyhole. [739]
I carried the case, the diary, and my restrained heart, following the map to the room that gathers sorrow, the one built to spill it harmlessly. [765]
In that bleak chamber I set the airship captain's goggles down, placed the book beside them, and watched the letters finally settle into sleep. [789]</story>
