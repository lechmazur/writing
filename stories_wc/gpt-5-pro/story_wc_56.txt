<story>By the silence of morning radio, the twilight barge canal breathed a hush. [13]
I poled my skiff along its mirror, an errant legend seeker between sleep and duty. [28]
Serene upheaval fluttered through the reeds, like pages turning themselves to a verdict. [41]
I had come to understand the architecture of lies that stitched our town. [54]
An antique pocket sundial sat against my chest, warm as a second pulse. [67]
It was my peculiar compass when clocks and people refused to point true. [80]
My mentor left it to me with a note that said, train your darkness to measure light. [97]
I took that as instruction by training instincts rather than trusting schedules. [109]
The canal had hoarded stories, and I came to salvage the truest ones. [122]
My thinking had to be thoughtfully clear, or else the water would rewrite me. [136]
In town, the mill owners claimed the flood was an act of fate. [149]
But fate does not stack sandbags only on one side of a street. [162]
Fate does not erase ledgers, nor switch off sirens before the river speaks. [175]
They silenced warnings, they tilted scales, they sold rain insurance after seeding clouds. [188]
That is an architecture of lies: a city built from careful misdirections. [200]
I rowed beneath a stone bridge where echoes traded names and bad bargains. [213]
A loaf wrapper clung to a piling, a calendar of hunger fluttering in place. [227]
From the wharf, the retired night watchman waved me closer, palms empty of authority. [241]
His badge had been pawned for morphine when the flood took his attic. [254]
He pointed to the mill flume and tapped his ear, asking for witness. [267]
I cupped the radio I carried, but it gave only the tender hush of static. [282]
By the silence of morning radio, truth felt like a signal too shy to arrive. [297]
The watchman nodded at the sundial and said, you still reading the sun underground? [311]
I said the sun writes marginalia on everything, even in refractions and stains. [324]
We slid to the sluice gates where the current kept secrets like a jealous archivist. [339]
The sundial face bore scratches that matched ledger initials I had found in mud. [353]
When aligned with the noon line, those scratches pointed precisely at the gated conduit. [367]
Hindsight clarity arrived like a heron landing, sudden and weightless on a thin rail. [381]
The flood had been throttled and timed, not unleashed, to drown only certain blocks. [395]
The owners insured the necessary, then released the water like a ledger correction. [408]
They promised relief, provided it to their allies, and called the rest regrettable tides. [422]
In that sight, I felt a tug between rage and a colder patience. [435]
Serene upheaval, I told myself, will move more water than any one shout. [448]
We anchored, and I photographed the scars, the angles, the illegal chain and wheel. [462]
The watchman asked if truth would fix his ceiling or cure his pain. [475]
No, I said, but truth can mark the door where help must knock first. [489]
He laughed like rope sliding over wood, and gave me a rusted padlock key. [503]
Through a hatch, we found crates labeled with numbers that matched relief barrel counts. [517]
Inside lay spare siren parts and blank reports, the alibis water cannot wash. [530]
I recorded everything, then set the pocket sundial on the crates like a seal. [544]
Its shadow cut a thin black verdict across the corporate logo. [555]
The canal breeze rose, as if witnesses exhaled from every plank and rivet. [568]
We hauled two crates into the skiff, promising the rest a second return. [581]
That was all we could salvage before the foreman car appeared on the viaduct. [595]
I felt the engine like a distant drum, steady and overconfident. [606]
By training instincts, I did not run fast; I rearranged the scene to speak. [620]
The sundial stayed visible, the crates half tarped, the photos cached under the plank. [634]
When the foreman shouted, I waved the key and asked where the matching lock lived. [649]
He stared at the sundial, perhaps hearing his own hours tally up at last. [663]
He said the canal was closed, and I said the sun was open. [676]
Behind him, the watchman set the siren we found upon the rail and wound. [690]
The blast cut the day clean, and windows woke like startled conscience. [702]
Neighbors gathered on balconies, the whole canal suddenly threaded by listening. [713]
I spoke, not loud, but thoughtfully clear, naming dates, parts, and routes. [725]
The foreman lowered his stance, like a man placing a heavy bucket down. [738]
The watchman raised the key, and I raised the sundial, our simple proofs. [751]
In that stillness, I felt older than the river and exactly its age. [764]
The legend I sought was not treasure, but the courage to name currents by their makers. [780]
We poled away while paperwork crossed town like a weather front, steady and inescapable. [794]</story>
