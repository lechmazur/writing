When the messenger knocked, he found me tuning the leaf blowers as a choir, my baton waiting on the sill like a sliver of midnight. [25]
I am the leaf blower symphony conductor, called only when a house goes silent in the wrong way. [43]
I had been summoned to restore lost laughter to a household, and that meant going where laughter had been last heard, not as sound but as pressure in air. [72]
It had gathered beneath their street, inside the echo chamber tunnel that drank every footstep and returned it as a colder version. [94]
I told the family to turn their hourglass, and to wait, because my work begins after the final grain slips through the hourglass. [117]
That is the moment the unspoken loosens its jaw. [126]
I am mournfully eager then, not out of thrill, but because urgency tastes like rain and I was trained to drink what others will not. [151]
We descended with cords coiled, the blower casings dull as old pewter, and the tunnel opened like a throat rehearsing apologies. [172]
Every surface swam with the faint oils of hands that had pressed against this world and found it unwilling to press back. [194]
I set the machines along the curve, nozzles aimed at the drum of air where grief had been rehearsing its single note. [216]
Each pull cord handle waited like a small spine for my fingers to acknowledge the weight of what it would set in motion. [239]
I tugged one, then another, and the tunnel filled with an off-key wind that bent like a bowed tree over a grave. [261]
On my cue the blowers breathed as sections, bass to treble, and I began tending to the unspoken like a physician of weather. [284]
The method is not secret but requires a devotion many cannot bear: via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind. [304]
I sang the names the family could not say anymore, letting the syllables macerate in the wet turbulence until they softened into echoes willing to be held. [331]
The tunnel answered with thin laughter at first, a mere skein, brittle as frost, then thickening as if an invisible mouth learned again to trust breath. [357]
I stepped into the center and conducted, small circles to gather, cuts to warn against pride, my baton inscribing a vow onto the humid night. [382]
One blower coughed, sputtered, pleaded; I knelt and whispered to its carburetor like a monk to a cracked bell, promising the note would not be asked to do harm. [411]
It steadied, and with it the wind took on that sorrowful pitch which makes hair stand even on the sleeping, a true haunting without theatrical cruelty. [437]
I thought of the child whose harmonica still waited under a pillow upstairs, metal tasting of pennies and dust, and I asked the air to carry that shape. [465]
The currents found it, and the tunnel rang with a line that was almost his laugh, wavering, brave, like a candle relighting itself between drafts. [490]
I cued the second section, the largest blower, and the note rose from a sob to a chuckle, spilling upward through the manholes, uncoiling toward the kitchen. [517]
Above, glasses touched each other on their own and chimed; plates hummed; a picture frame straightened; the family drew close, suspicious and helpless, listening as their house remembered. [545]
I have learned never to keep more than necessary, and never to return it all, because laughter without its shadows becomes brittle and cuts the mouth that holds it. [574]
So I let a portion rest with the tunnel, and I let a portion float back through the tiles, via the cold pipes, into spoons and sleeves and throats. [603]
The house exhaled then, and what came out was not noise but room, a space where joy could step without tripping over the names of the dead. [630]
I gathered my machines, stroked each pull cord handle as one strokes a horse that has carried a body longer than its back deserved. [654]
The messenger waited at the mouth of the tunnel, and behind him the family stood, uncertain, until the smallest sound arrived, a filament of giggle like dawn. [681]
No one laughed yet; it would be earned, not summoned; but the air allowed the possibility, and possibility is the first laugh learning how to breathe. [707]
I left payment on the sill, a tuning fork wrapped in twine, because I take nothing but the unspoken, and I only borrow that. [731]
Outside, the night smelled of wet iron and pears, the sort that bruise if you stare too hard, tender enough to understand what we had asked of it. [759]
Behind me the tunnel swallowed its own breathing and slept, keeping a vigil only echoes know, and the wind held a lullaby it would finish when I was gone. [788]
