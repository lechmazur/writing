<story>The sound wave garden hummed around the clinic lake, vibrating air into petals that shivered like thoughts. [17]
I came at the hush of the universe inhaling, when even the security drones drifted like drowsy moths. [35]
They called me an experimental treatment guinea pig, which sounded tidy until the electrodes opened other people's weather in my skull. [56]
I signed because I was quietly rebellious and because Jonah would otherwise sleep forever beneath hospital fluorescence. [73]
The protocol studied entangled memories, trying to braid my living storms with the sleeping currents of the man I loved. [93]
The architects built the garden so sound could bloom into terrains we might walk while minds overlapped. [110]
Each hedge carried a frequency; each pool was an auric lagoon under starlight, where gold ripples held our silhouettes together. [130]
They said, to breathe life into a shared dream, we must let our histories touch without flinching. [147]
I learned a method the previous patient abandoned after a day, drumming on everything until rhythms mapped what words could not. [168]
The benches answered in quivers, the railings throbbed faintly, and the lagoon's surface stippled when my knuckles offered a steady beat. [189]
I would perch on the walkway above the auric water and drum until Jonah's ghostly countertempo rose. [206]
On the second week the doctors allowed me to enter the garden alone, unclipped from their muzzle of reassurance. [225]
The air tasted metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea. [239]
I started drumming on everything again, finger pads flicking stone, wrist bones nudging railing, heel tapping bridge planks. [257]
The garden answered with a slowly knitting phrase, as if the plants remembered a lost song and were shy to sing. [278]
When the phrase steadied, a flicker trembled beneath the lagoon, the shape of his laugh before the wreckage. [296]
I leaned forward, hearing our first apartment at once, its faucet cough, the dryer clacking buttons like hail. [314]
Entangled memories are not neat; they snag on the thorns of unrealized days and grow tender bruises under the skin. [334]
Jonah had always been the one who calmed me by tapping tabletops until a soft joke appeared. [351]
Now I borrowed his habit and returned it amplified to the garden, a promise encoded as rhythm. [368]
The lagoon brightened, an aurora drowned in a basin, and the starlight shook loose in long, luminous threads. [386]
I saw Jonah running the December pier, his breath bright, his ridiculous scarf flying, and for a moment grief steadied. [406]
The system pulsed a warning in the rail, asking if I consented to deeper coherence with the sleeping patient. [425]
Consent, I said, tapping yes with two knuckles and a breath that tasted like brine and electricity. [442]
The clinic lights dimmed until the garden felt like a cathedral patience built from singing molecules. [458]
Somewhere, monitors wrote numbers about me, but here the auric lagoon under starlight lifted a sheet of gold toward my ribs. [479]
At the hush of the universe inhaling, the sheet touched, and I became the dock and the boat and the tide. [500]
Jonah's memory river met mine in bright collision, spraying images that felt like rain powered by childhood. [517]
We stood in two kitchens at once, burned the same soup twice, and laughed in stereo that shivered the reeds. [537]
Then the tide reversed, showing the accident as a glass corridor we walked carefully, collecting what could still gleam. [556]
I felt the ache of auroral sorrow, beautiful and breaking, and I knew the experiment would charge a cost. [575]
If we braided too tightly, we might wake neither in flesh but as a chord the garden remembered. [593]
Yet I was quietly rebellious even against grief, and the dream we had shared once deserved oxygen more than fear. [613]
I kept drumming on everything, telling him with wrists and heels that I would carry the heavy brightness with him. [633]
His pulse found the tempo, and for an hour we walked the sound wave garden as if we were both alive. [654]
We named birds from two continents and pushed each other on swings that were really resonant scans tuned to our giddy breath. [676]
When the hour thinned, Jonah's laughter scattered like sparks blown apart, and the lagoon faded to the gentlest gold. [695]
He said we could try again tomorrow, and I heard nurses arguing in the world beyond our glowing leaves. [714]
I perched on the railing, toes curled, and promised to be the beat that lets us return. [731]
If the cost was that my outline blurred, I would accept the blur that spelled our names together. [749]
The garden dimmed back to ordinary miracle, and I stepped down, listening for his echo inside the rails. [767]
Somewhere beyond the leaves, consents and waivers slept in clipboards, but here our shared dream breathed, frail and luminous. [786]
I left carrying auroral sorrow like a lantern, drumming tomorrow on ribs. [798]</story>
