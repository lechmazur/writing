<story>After the nostalgia ban, the city forgot how to sway with tidewater, but I remembered, because I am a skilled tide dancer. [22]
My art once navigated harbors and grief, each step charting invisible currents with obsidian grace that could quiet storms and resurrect names. [44]
Now I practice in a twilight garden under stars, where enforcement drones refuse to look, and the leaves keep confidences. [64]
I chose elective exile from the coastal guild, not for safety, but for fidelity to the tides inside my bones. [84]
Exile tastes like brine swallowed in winter, sharp, necessary, and it keeps me spontaneously anchored when memory tries to run. [104]
Tonight the garden pools the sky in its basins, and every reflected star is a witness I cannot bribe, only respect. [125]
I have come with a moonstone cabochon dust speck, small as a tear, bright as the hush between two waves. [145]
I warmed it in my palm until it remembered the moon, then set it on my tongue so that it would listen. [167]
Its purpose is not ornament, but instrument, because my motivation is to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin and let it travel. [190]
The skin will be mine first, a draft, and then others who ask for tides to be remembered without saying the forbidden word. [213]
I learned to write by observing gaps, the silent hinge between footfalls, the breath before a crest breaks, the pause after goodbye. [235]
Gaps are portals, and through them the verse can fledge without alarms, like a heron lifting from a rock none saw. [256]
My hands map the garden path where gravel remembers shoreline, and I step to the cadence that tides whisper in exile. [277]
A watcher approaches, a friend once, now a clerk of forgetting, his badge a mirror to dazzle, not reflect. [296]
He says my dances stir contraband affection, that even my shadow rehearses recollection, and asks what harm I intend here. [316]
I show him the speck balanced on my tongue, and he laughs, because power likes its threats large, and its poems absent. [338]
Then I dance, not the old cavalcade of storms, but a small orbit, as though swinging a planet by a strand of hair. [361]
Each heel falls exactly where his gaze is not, and each toe plants a seed of stillness that germinates in his doubt. [383]
He forgets to speak, and in that unmade sentence I press the moonstone cabochon dust speck to the hollow of my wrist. [405]
It kisses the skin and leaves a star that only starlight reads, a letter that opens only in darkness. [424]
I continue, placing syllables where his eyelids blink, arranging lines between the dates printed on his orders, composing in the lacunae of authority. [447]
The poem coils around my arm like a tide chart, and I feel the rip as it copies itself into the moving air. [470]
He blinks again, and again, until his mission slips sideways, and he asks, quietly, if forgetting can be gentle. [489]
I answer by showing him how my soles hold the stones, how a dancer learns to be spontaneously anchored and free simultaneously. [511]
The trick is to feel the tide tug and not obey, to pivot in allegiance to something deeper than decree. [531]
He removes his glove, hesitates, then offers his palm as page, and I nod, because the poem is hungry for living paper. [553]
I ask if he will accept elective exile from certainty, if he will carry the sea inside him without speaking its name. [575]
He nods like a lighthouse deciding to wander, and I write the first line where his life line breaks and resumes. [596]
The moonstone warms to his pulse, and the words lift, tiny sails, until between us opens a harbor no law can close. [618]
We work by observing gaps, breathing when the cicadas pause, stepping when the satellites pass, letting silence ferry syllables across suspicion. [639]
The poem teaches us posture, the stoop of humility, the spine of defiance, the shoulders that can carry a midnight shoreline. [660]
When the last stanza finds its brink, I feel my own wings fledge, not to leave but to arrive where I had refused. [683]
This is not escape; it is return, through a path outlawed by naming, into a language of soles, palms, and luminous scars. [705]
Dawn gathers like a tribunal, and still the stars refuse to testify against us, because they know who taught them to rise. [727]
We bow to the garden and seal the verse with breath, obsidian grace held steady as surf, then step into our chosen night. [750]</story>
