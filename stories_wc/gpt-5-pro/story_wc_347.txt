<story>In the cliffside labyrinth, where terraces hung like ribs, I kept the cursed orchard when nobody else would. [18]
I was the caretaker by debt, not desire, reluctant as a door reluctant to open on a winter morning. [37]
Mechanical birds patrolled the air, brass feathers ticking, eyes like keyholes, always measuring, always returning to their cold perches. [56]
Beneath them, trees twisted from ancient grafts bore fruit that whispered, and every seed kept a little map of sorrow. [76]
I tended because travelers lost the way, and my task was to guide them to safety before the night frost forms. [97]
Some days I believed the orchard cursed me as well, pruning my choices until only the duty remained. [115]
The labyrinth was not stone alone, but terraces, ladders, wind, and the quiet routes the birds refused to see. [134]
I learned to leave impressions without touching, persuading dust, light, and scent to mark paths no hand had held. [153]
For the birds read disturbances, not footsteps, and my guidance had to look like the wind deciding to help. [172]
They were beautiful in a graceless way, all beaks and angles, clattering music that made gullies ring with penny bright mourning. [193]
Once, at dawn, I found a small nut wedged in a gear of the oldest bird and spared a traveler. [213]
The nut had the orchard's faint spiral, a forgotten blueprint stamped in its shell, showing corridors where trees drank the cliff's marrow. [235]
I realized the design of this place lived in such seeds, a memory older than the engineers who set the birds. [256]
I spoke of it to travelers offhandedly exact, as if discussing weather, because certainty calms panic more quickly than tenderness. [276]
Follow the turn where the olives taste of iron, I would say, and keep the cliff to your cold shoulder. [296]
I did not tell them the orchard whispered their names, inviting bites that would plant new paths inside their sleep. [316]
The curse is civil, not cruel; it offers direction so perfect that a soul forgets why it ever wandered. [335]
I was spared once by a grandmother who slapped the apple from my mouth and marked a safe route with her cane. [357]
She is gone into the brine below, but I keep her method, leaving guidance that saves without the pride of rescue. [378]
Today three strangers arrived, all dust and worry, arguing over a map that mistranslated the cliffs into straight polite boulevards. [398]
They needed me and I resented it the way rust resents salt, swelling, bright, inevitable, and strangely clean. [416]
Night would lower its frost soon, and the birds tighten their patrols, riding cold thermals that carve the orchard into separate islands. [438]
I took the small nut from my pocket, rolled it in my palm, and remembered the blueprint etched there like a thumbprint. [460]
With its pattern I could assemble their path, not by building, but by waking what already wanted to become a guide. [481]
I shook a branch so gently the leaves only thought of stirring, and shadows leaned across one stair and not another. [502]
On a high ledge I snapped a reed, not touching the dust, only singing near it until the skin of grit shivered. [524]
Footprints appeared where none walked, just pale ovals the birds accepted as proof, and the strangers followed them like penitent children. [545]
I spoke directions in my exact voice, offhanded and quiet, setting their pace against the tide of wings and iron. [565]
When a bird veered close, I flicked the nut into its feather joints, and the engine paused like a breath before a sob. [588]
The strangers did not see my hand, only the way the patrol widened, granting us a corridor that smelt of copper and thyme. [611]
They asked why I stayed, and I told the nearest truth, that someone must prune the maps the curse would grow. [632]
The deeper truth is uglier and tender, that giving directions empties me of myself, leaving shapes others can survive within. [652]
We reached the last switchback before the frost, and the orchard sighed, disappointed, as if losing a story it preferred. [672]
I pressed the nut into the hands of the youngest, a token and a map, and told them to forget the blueprint. [694]
You could assemble a life from too much knowing, I said, and never taste the crooked sweetness that keeps a heart surprising. [716]
They went down the cliff road, safe and shivering, while I turned back to the graceless beauty that still required me. [737]
I remained, the reluctant caretaker of a cursed orchard, guiding the living by absences and leaving myself behind where no one could touch. [760]</story>
