<story>The shrine is a long throat of ice flickering with candle breath. [12]
I slide in with my pack and the melted snow globe. [23]
Borrowed starlight filters through seams and pools in blue slabs. [33]
The ice holds a quiet that listens harder than any room of wood. [46]
I am a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, and I was called here. [57]
Not by letters, not by sirens, but by dreams crossing on dark currents. [70]
Strangers told me their sleep carried a girl with wet braids and glass in her palms. [86]
She drifted through, a cameo appearance, mouthing a name none of them could keep. [100]
I weave truth carefully from such fragments, because ghosts prefer threads to nets. [113]
Dreams are my windows of connection, and I read reflections moving within. [125]
A porter dreaming of the girl near a lifeboat meant the deck was already tilted. [140]
A baker seeing her hand a coin to a gull said she kept giving things away. [156]
A dockworker waking to the taste of frost told me where to look for her remains. [172]
The vessel sleeps under the glacier now, a burned ribcage in a blue cathedral. [186]
In that husk I found the snow globe, no village left inside, only warped plastic drifting like algae. [204]
The heat that took their breath had melted even winter under glass. [216]
I carried it here because that child kept borrowing my pulse whenever I closed my eyes. [232]
The shrine is carved where the ice thins to windows, moaning with locked wind. [246]
Candles bruise the blue with honey, and smoke writes requests that freeze before rising. [260]
I set the melted snow globe among charred rosaries and sea bones. [272]
Its water is fog, its flurries gone, its blank core reflecting me as a wobbling star. [288]
I whisper, and the ice answers with a thin, brittle knell. [299]
The girl arrives the way auroras test a horizon, shy and then everywhere. [312]
Her voice is a bruise under my tongue, tasting like pennies and salt. [325]
She touches the globe and blinks as if pulling off a bandage made of light. [340]
I tell her what I have learned by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams. [354]
That the captain tried to turn, that the owner lied about the wiring, that the blaze sang faster than prayer. [374]
I have come to expose it, not for vengeance, but because truth is a raft. [389]
She looks at the ice and nods, as if the walls are both shore and audience. [405]
Windows of connection bloom where the candles seal tears into the sculpted seams. [418]
Faces rise within, not reflections, but memories lending their shapes like winter coats. [431]
The porter, the baker, the dockworker, even a child I never met in the last town. [447]
They dreamed her, and now those dreams lean against the ice as if peering in. [462]
These are my passageways, my gentle panes, my arguable, navigable truth. [473]
I string them carefully, careful as stitching a lung, so breath will not leak. [487]
The girl hangs her words on that thread, and the room listens. [499]
She had meant to save a paper bird and a locket, but chose the snow globe because the flakes looked like forgiveness. [521]
When the heat poured in, her hands sealed the glass to her skin like vows. [536]
She asks if there is anything left to save that is not ash or coin. [551]
I tell her I came to salvage something pure from the wreckage, and I think it is her name. [570]
Names cross water better than bodies, and they do not rust. [581]
She presses the globe until my palms cool, and the fog clears to letters burned into the base. [599]
Leda, scraped by heat, still legible, still fighting to be seen. [610]
I speak it, and the shrine inhales, and the windows widen as if to welcome weather. [626]
Borrowed starlight pours through, cold as kindness, bright as rumor. [636]
I promise to carry her name to the living and to expose the owner's lie where ledgers hide it. [655]
The candles bob like buoys, marking a channel I did not chart until now. [669]
The girl's ghost stands at my shoulder, weightless and insistent as a tide schedule. [683]
We walk back through the glacier passage, and every candled niche becomes a witness. [697]
Outside, night holds the sea like a secret you can carry only with both hands. [712]
I lift the globe high and feel its weight turn to direction, not proof yet, but path. [729]
Windows of connection follow me in the eyes of seals, in the hesitant nods of strangers, in the hush between waves. [750]
I have no siren, only borrowed starlight and a name that does not drown. [764]
Truth will take the long channel, but I will keep weaving until the water holds. [779]
To save her from erasure, to save myself from salvage without meaning, I step into the night. [796]</story>
