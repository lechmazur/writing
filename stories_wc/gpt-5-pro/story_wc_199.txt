<story>The Ashen skyborne arbor drifted above the gray valley like a patient whale made of wood. [16]
At its heart worked an Orderly seed sorter named Fen, keeper of husk, habit, and hope. [32]
Fen's calling was simple: To decode the message in falling leaves before the winds scattered sense. [48]
He worked with Mossy delight, palms greened by hours of sifting crisp litter from velvet bough hollows. [65]
During the hush where past meets prophecy, the arbor sighed, and work quickened as the leaves released secrets. [83]
Fen read them not by letters but by building tiny monuments to forgotten things upon the bark. [100]
A feather pointed toward a cracked nut, a seed husk leaned on a twig, each arrangement an illuminated phrase. [119]
Regional folklore held that the arbor remembered every season and spoke only to those patient enough to assemble its grammar. [139]
On the morning of the thistlefall, he found a Moonstone cabochon dust speck pasted to a leaf vein. [157]
It shimmered without light, a sign in every tale that the arbor was about to change its tongue. [175]
Fen placed it on his thumbnail like a lens and held it up to the flutter of descent. [193]
The falling leaves, once mulch of memory, turned to sequences, slopes, pauses, and accents he could nearly pronounce. [211]
He began building a monument more complex than any before, mapping the leaf music into arches of seed and bone. [231]
Every few breaths he would prod the tiny archways, listening to the whispering tremor that corrected his alignment. [249]
He knew from old notes that whoever truly heard the arbor emerges transformed always, like bark after fire. [267]
Birds muted their throats, and resin gathered at the seams as the hush deepened and the monument rose. [285]
As a child of the canopy, he had sorted chaotic seeds by color, then by flavor, then by dreams. [304]
Now he was the Orderly seed sorter, steward of sequence, caretaker of the arbor's sentences. [319]
The Moonstone cabochon dust speck seemed to blur stutters into constellations, and he aligned his arches like stars. [337]
Regional folklore warned that misread phrases could tilt the arbor, spilling villages down to grind themselves into fog. [355]
So he listened with bound caution, letting the whorls of grain and gust dictate which twig should shoulder which syllable. [375]
He tasted air that blew through scorched lichen and nectar, a blend of ash and candy that steadied his notes. [395]
When the sculpture stood waist-high, he waited, and the hush sealed around him like a bell of listening. [413]
Leaves crossed the sky, tapping against the arches to make soft chimes that spelled possibilities he almost feared. [431]
He prodded the base once more, and the Moonstone cabochon dust speck flared like a frostbitten firefly. [448]
That crisp flash showed him the missing curve, a final glyph shaped like a seed that knew its soil. [467]
He adjusted the arch, shifted a feather, and the phrase clarified: release, not store; scatter, not save. [484]
The Orderly seed sorter reeled, because his catalogues were towers in his mind, careful barns of feeling. [501]
But he thought of the villages hung beneath the limbs and trusted the grammar that had carried him here. [520]
He unlatched every drawer of saved seed, tipped them into the breeze, and the monument rang like spring. [538]
The Ashen skyborne arbor lifted a finger-width higher, and the sepia sentences along its bark shifted tense. [555]
Fen heard the prelude of his ancestors and the aftersong of children not yet hatched, braided in one wind. [574]
He emptied even the last envelope, and he knew building tiny monuments to forgotten things also meant letting go. [593]
The monument settled and crumbled back to twigs, but the words climbed him, and his hearing widened into color. [612]
He, like the arbor's proverb, emerges transformed always, aware that order was a question and listening the only honorable answer. [632]
Seeds sailed outward, some to distant cliffs, some to the valley floor, their soft comets sketching relief for dangling homes. [652]
From then on, he would prod fewer arches and release more pockets of memory, reading by what he relinquished. [671]
Regional folklore changed, telling of the sorter who let go, whose monuments were winds and whose ink was flight. [690]
The Moonstone cabochon dust speck stayed tucked into his thumb crease, a reminder that clarity can weigh almost nothing. [709]
And each season, during the hush where past meets prophecy, he greeted the leaves with Mossy delight and open hands. [729]</story>
