<story>I came to the infinite staircase because I could not decide where else to stand still and keep moving. [19]
On its risers the horizon repeats, and the air holds the tone of boundless confinement like a bell that never stops humming. [41]
I am a grim optimist, so I climbed, believing the climb would bruise me into truth and yet give me something salvageable. [63]
What I wanted, exactly, was to capture the texture of a missed opportunity, not the fact of it but the grain, the nap. [86]
It happened once on an ordinary Tuesday I will forever call None, because time there had all the weight and shape of a blank. [110]
I held a pair of dice, one chipped, and I let them choose whether I ran to meet her or stayed to erase a chalkboard. [135]
They bounced unevenly and came to rest spending my life on the chalkboard, and the stairs began for me at that refusal. [157]
I have been climbing since, balancedly daring, never lunging into the void, never cowering on one tread too long. [176]
Each landing is a hypothesis and each riser a lemma, and I test them through mathematical proofs written in the chalk of my memory. [200]
Perpetual motion is the myth that tempts the weary, and it became my working metaphor for the life I threw away. [221]
A meeting was the motor, a conversation the flywheel, and her offered hand the bearing I failed to oil with courage. [242]
So I set up a proof by ascent, pacing the staircase itself, a topology of vows and remainders. [260]
Assume the machine of desire cannot run forever, I wrote with a knuckle on the dust, and derive the contradiction. [280]
At the k-th step, some heat is lost; at the next, I find it returned by memory, as if the staircase refunds the heart. [304]
Induction carries me higher, and somehow the sum of small decays cancels against the accumulation of chances I keep rolling. [324]
My pair of dice, one chipped, works like a metronome that refuses to slow; it tics luck and bias into agreement. [345]
By contradiction the world should break, and maybe it does, because a hairline rupture opens along the bannister and leaks light. [366]
From the seam comes Tuesday again, the smell of rain and copier toner and her voice saying if you hurry now there is still time. [391]
I tell the staircase my theorem, that desire, subjected to recurrence on an infinite staircase, becomes motion without fuel, becomes duty sustained by regret. [415]
The staircase is a listener that does not forgive or forget, and it takes my statement and folds it into its unending tread. [438]
Every proof demands examples, so I roll the dice and follow the numbers: two steps forward, three up, snake eyes, turn and look back. [462]
The chip catches on skin, and I taste the iron of missed chances, copper and chalk, a metallic texture that answers my original prayer. [486]
It is not her I touch but the burr in the choice, the imperfection where the future slipped and skinned its knee. [508]
I say her name once, only to prove the space is not empty, and the echo returns like breath fogging the underside of glass. [532]
The staircase accepts my induction and also my failure, and it offers a bargain that sounds suspiciously like the truth. [552]
Prove that perpetual motion is impossible except for the penance of memory, and you may keep your hope; disprove it, and you may step off. [577]
A grim optimist takes the wager because he believes he will fail nobly and yet succeed at saying why, which is a kind of victory. [602]
I write a new proof that begins at None and walks upward, mapping each step to a missed petition, counting warmth lost and found. [626]
I assume the engine is our stubborn heart, and the only input is attention, which I measure in the pips and scars of the dice. [651]
Then I show that attention cannot be spent without also being generated by the very act of noticing, which the staircase forces indefinitely. [674]
Thus motion persists not as physics but as obligation, the machine that turns because not turning would break what little remains unbroken. [696]
I present the proof to the rupture, lift the dice as if to bless it, and feel the stair beneath me stop while I keep ascending. [722]
Boundless confinement accepts me, and the world agrees to be both a prison and a path, endless, honest, and not entirely cruel. [744]
I pocket the pair of dice, one chipped, and climb toward a horizon that repeats, proof in my chest, texture under my tongue. [767]
When the proof fades I will write it again, step by step, because this is how a missed opportunity becomes something I can almost hold. [792]</story>
