<story>The night finds me in a rusted library under stars, pages flaking like scabs, air salted and still. [18]
It is the first hour after discovering I am not who I thought, and my breath keeps arguing with itself. [38]
I am a phobia-ridden stunt double whose body knows fire, heights, water, and impact better than my mind tolerates them. [58]
My hands shake, yet a trembling certainty keeps the rest of me moving between ruined stacks like a rehearsal mark. [78]
In my pocket is a whispering seashell half, its lip chipped, its hum a private tide I pretend is advice. [98]
It was the only thing I brought from the trailer when the truth knocked like a stunt punch and did not pull. [120]
Kellan, the producer who taught me to hit water sideways and breathe around fear, used my life as a mask for his ghost star. [144]
The cameras loved Jax, the impossible lead, but Jax was a collage of borrowed bruises, and most of them were mine. [165]
When I found the contracts with my birth name buried as a code word, something inside me cracked and let light in. [187]
It was a transformative betrayal, the kind that does not end you so much as replace your hinges and demand you swing. [209]
The reason I know how deep the betrayal runs is scrawled on a child's cast I found in a charity bin behind stage three. [233]
Someone had let the wet signatures smear, but the doodles and instructions bled into one another like breakaway glass, hiding directional script. [255]
By decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast, I learned where Kellan stores the real footage and the ledger of purchased silence. [277]
The key was the seashell, because the kid had traced half moons and wave marks that matched its spiral steps like a lullaby cipher. [301]
I set the cast under the skylight, listened to the whispering seashell half, and lined the smudges with the rust constellations overhead. [323]
It told me to hunt the biography section, to tug a warped third volume from the myth shelf, and to trust my shaking. [346]
The book face was a hollow, and inside lay a coil of microfilm and a ring labeled with my stage name in thick marker. [370]
I could feel old fear climb my spine like a hot ladder, but I grabbed both and breathed until my ribs stopped counting exits. [394]
I am firmly adaptive, the way coral is, making shelter out of whatever breaks me, and tonight I let that be my stunt. [417]
Kellan would come for the microfilm, because a composite star cannot survive a composite truth, and I wanted to prove vulnerability is power, to outwit him. [443]
So I called him from a pay phone by the sea and told him I was done running the burns and would meet him among books. [469]
By the time his shoes scraped the threshold, I had threaded the microfilm to the ceiling projector and aimed it at the night. [492]
Pages of falsified call sheets, payments, and medical waivers sprayed across the stars like a constellation learning to pronounce my name. [513]
He laughed until he saw the cast on the table and the seashell in my palm, then his mouth went into paperwork silence. [536]
We circled the circulation desk like partners who forgot the dance, my heartbeat a drumline I could not keep in straight time. [558]
You never would have been Jax, he said, only the body that bruises, and I felt my fear answer, Yes, but mine. [580]
I told him how I used to map exits more faithfully than saints trace halos, and how tonight I mapped my shaking instead. [603]
I told him the code in the cast was a child's wish that grownups tell the truth, and a cipher anyone brave enough could hear. [628]
He reached for the projector switch, and I did not stop him, because the stars hold steadier in the dark, and so do I. [652]
He could not see the steps I had chalked, the pattern of safe tiles I learned from stunt coordinators and from panic itself. [675]
When he lunged, he found the rotten boards I avoided, and the floor opened like a failed trap door beneath his rehearsed swagger. [698]
I helped him to the edge, hands shaking, not to save him from consequences but to save myself from becoming his kind of script. [722]
We sat among the metal stacks, the smell of iron and old glue thick, and watched the film reflower along the ceiling. [744]
He kept saying this would ruin us both, but I heard the seashell say that ruin is another name for an honest beginning. [767]
I told the night, and him, and the microfilm, that I was done being a composite, and my voice steadied like a rig. [790]</story>
