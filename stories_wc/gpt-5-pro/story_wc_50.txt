<story>I am a reflective locksmith, sworn to make keys for doors that refuse to admit ordinary curiosity. [17]
The marble cavern breathes cool and patient air, veined with light that seems fossilized into the stone. [34]
I came here across the lull of a wounded season, when streams hush and birds stitch fewer syllables. [52]
My purpose is simple and stubborn: to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later. [68]
Someone left a broken timer mechanism at my workshop, its gears stalled like a heart that remembers duty but not rhythm. [89]
The metal smelled faintly of cave water, and I knew the device belonged to this underworld of marble breath. [108]
I am peripherally focused by habit, preferring edges where truth glances off instead of charging straight through. [125]
At the cavern rim, the echoes gathered like shy animals, grazing along my hearing rather than standing before it. [144]
A harvest of echoes was needed, and I had brought sacks woven from patience and calibrated silence. [161]
To reverse-engineer the mechanism, I would read the cave the way a watch reads a wrist, studying reflection angles at different times. [183]
Light struck the marble and scattered; sound grazed the walls and returned with tiny, disciplined variations of pitch and delay. [203]
I chalked a daisy of marks around the chamber, each petal an angle, each angle a hypothesis about how stone edits memory. [225]
Without a working timer, I counted drip intervals and footfalls, letting echo-length stand in for seconds the way wind stands in for breath. [248]
When I opened the mechanism, a trapped click fluttered out, like a bird that had learned to imitate chains. [267]
Its escapement had misaligned teeth, and the echo patterns told me what the teeth once knew about order. [285]
The marble was my tutor, indifferent yet exact, tallying how long a whisper took to round a bend and forgive itself. [306]
I rebuilt the springs from wire in my satchel, but the heart of the device needed more than parts. [325]
It needed a tempo harvested from the cave itself, a measure not of seconds but of wonder moving through stone. [345]
So I filed a gear train that counted returning echoes when they struck at measured angles, timing reality by its reflections. [366]
To bait the echoes, I set a chime on the floor, a thin cup of copper stroked by a reed of bone. [388]
I stayed at the edge and kept my gaze peripherally focused, where the smallest trembling carries the largest news. [407]
The first return came bruised, as if the season itself had limped in, leaking weather through unseen seams. [425]
I noted the angle of incidence, the angle of retreat, the count of heartbeats, and adjusted the balance wheel. [444]
Echo by echo, the harvest thickened, until the sacks of silence I had brought grew heavy with articulated pauses. [463]
I remembered my vow as a locksmith: to grant entry not to theft but to understanding, to hinge the invisible and let it turn. [487]
With tweezers I set the harvested echoes into the escapement, tiny phantoms nuzzling brass until brass consented to breathe. [506]
The mechanism began, its tick like a cave drip made civic, each beat a signed treaty between stone and air. [526]
The cavern approved with a hum that was not approval but congruence, a yes that used no vowels. [544]
I logged the beats and stored them in the cellar of reason I keep beneath my ribs, shelves labeled for later. [565]
There were voices still to collect, the ones that only speak during the lull of a wounded season, and they were risky. [587]
I went deeper where the skylight narrowed to a blue thread, studying reflection angles at different times as the thread turned silver, then ash. [611]
An old storm talked in the rock, telling how it once filled the valley and forgot to leave; I harvested that lesson. [633]
Neighbors would ask for repaired clocks, but I would return with tuned time, softened by mercy learned from stone. [652]
When I left the cavern, the mechanism turned with the colors of the wounded season, carrying its hush like a watermark. [673]
I would seal the cellar of reason and label the jar: winter-humility, measured by marble, for later openings. [691]
A locksmith holds peripheries so that centers may live, and the echoes I harvested will keep the next door honest. [711]</story>
