<story>We always come here after the search party disbands, to the rain-washed foundry that steams like breath. [17]
I am the balanced alchemist they let stay late, because I keep precise company with fire. [33]
Precision is my romance and my penance, a luminous regret that burns without consuming me. [48]
I work to understand the weight of names, and how they alloy with deeds. [62]
Tonight the gutters sing, and I sort tokens from the silted ash on the anvil. [77]
Among them is a zodiac coin, greened with time, its twelve worn beasts looking away. [92]
It belonged to Mira, the child whose name tipped every scale and sank the search into marsh. [109]
She was lost in the iron-bloom hills, and we found only echoes of her laughter in pipes. [126]
When her father pressed the coin into my palm, his eyes measured me like broken ore. [142]
Redeem her, he said, as if redemption were a recipe, as if I owned a furnace of absolutes. [160]
But I am a balanced alchemist, not a prophet, and balance is a jealous arithmetic. [175]
Every ingredient here carries a name and a history, factually mystical as the tide tables we consult. [192]
Call a metal by its childhood and it will answer with smoke; call it wrong and it resists. [210]
So I begin where naming hurts, on the seam between loss and alloy, with kintsugi intentions. [226]
If a cup can be mended by gold, perhaps a story can be mended by truth. [242]
I anneal the coin, warm as a held breath, and listen for Mira in the metal. [258]
Zodiac beasts circle, their faint outlines chasing one another across centuries of handling and hope. [273]
In their orbit I hear a child's vow, to run farther than her name could carry. [289]
I temper iron blooms into petaled discs, arranging them around the coin like questions around a heart. [306]
This is how I redeem without miracles, by exploring limits of what refuses to break completely. [322]
Heat draws out what is stubborn, and stubbornness, when loved, sometimes names itself back into being. [338]
I speak her name in the slag-light and feel it weigh my tongue like a wet nail. [355]
Names fall heavy when they are all that remains, heavier than steel if guilt is the flux. [372]
What if I misnamed her wildness as disobedience, my own balance as safety, my safety as love. [389]
The foundry answers in showers of sparks, commas of light punctuating the sentence of the rain. [405]
I hammer the coin into the new disc, then inlay the cracks with brass that glows like dawn. [423]
The pattern is not pretty, but it is honest, a map of all the times we failed her. [441]
I file the edges smooth and stamp the rim with letters that refuse to lie about weight. [458]
On the table rests my ledger, a factually mystical book where assays meet weather and rumor. [474]
In its margins I record not miracles but limits, and the cost of touching them. [489]
By exploring limits I learn where a name holds and where it breaks, like a bar under strain. [507]
Mira's name holds at laughter, breaks at dusk, and bends whenever a father speaks to iron. [523]
I carry the finished disc outside, and the rain takes its first small drink from the seams. [540]
In that sip I hear an old, responsible music, the tune that work hums when words are true. [558]
I will take this token to her father and speak each letter as if holding a newborn. [575]
I will tell him we could not find her body, only her balance, dispersed and returning. [591]
He will hate me for that, and I will accept the hatred as another name with weight. [608]
What matters is that the coin now speaks in seams, and the seams say we listened. [624]
To redeem is not to undo; it is to choose a joining that makes memory and metal agree. [642]
In the rain the disc brightens, stubborn, imperfect, a moon that declines to rise above the smoke. [659]
I press it warm against my wrist, then set it back on the anvil to cool. [675]
The foundry quiets as if it, too, wanted to understand the weight of names with me. [691]
Behind the rain's curtain, the hills wait, and the road back glittering with filings refuses endpoints. [707]
I go because balance is movement, because love is method, and because she might be listening. [723]
If she is, then I will not fail again in the grammar of her vanished name. [739]
Metal remembers what we ask of it, and I will ask mercy in a tongue of seams. [756]
That is my oath as a balanced alchemist, and the rain carries it forward like smoke. [772]</story>
