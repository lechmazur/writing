<story>Wind combed the dunes and made the glass humming pavilion sing, a thin music over ruins and salt. [18]
As its keeper, the beacon-tower custodian Kera listened with palms to the trembling panes, memorizing the notes like constellations. [37]
It had been years after the collapse of civilization, and the sea had moved inland like a patient conspiracy. [56]
Kera kept watch to prove that coincidences have meaning, that her shifts were not just rituals against forgetting. [74]
In the tower heart lay a broken crystal prism, edges clouded, its missing tooth like an absent note. [92]
A boy had traded her a shard of hush for bread, claiming it once fit that tooth and quieted tempests. [112]
She was retrocognitively blessed, cursed, some said, able to tilt her senses backward as if time were shallow water. [131]
When she touched the prism, she heard the old engine of the beacon turning like a sleepy whale. [149]
When she held the shard of hush, she felt the city pause, as if listening for something to return. [168]
Between those echoes was a gap she could not bear, and she decided to make the notes meet again. [187]
The old logs said the beacon could rekindle by tracking star paths, if the prism sang the angles true. [206]
So she climbed, past rusted stairs and nettles that grew pale in the salt wind, carrying cloth and paste. [225]
The glass humming pavilion kept its tentative music as she cleaned the lensbed, guiding grit into a calico pouch. [244]
She nested the broken crystal prism in the cradle, its stump turned toward the gap that ached like a mouth. [264]
Then she took the shard of hush from its oilskin, a smokeless gray wedge that seemed to swallow her pulse. [284]
It did not fit outright, for the tooth had chipped twice, first in flame, then in waves that chewed iron. [304]
Kera canted the shard using softened resin and a spider of copper thread, whispering measures she only half remembered. [323]
Night joined, and she began by tracking star paths in the haloed sky, matching the pavilion notes to Orion's slant. [343]
Being retrocognitively blessed, she could listen not only to this sky but to the one that used to hang here. [363]
Old calibrations murmured as syllables in the wind, an apprentice's voice counting clicks, a mentor corralling laughter into mathematics. [382]
She set the angles so the new starlight would pour through and strike the old scars as if they were seeds. [403]
She turned the wheel, and the beacon head groaned, startled to movement like a crab finding an old shell. [422]
Coincidences lined themselves for her like wayward birds, the shard arriving, the wind of a certain pitch, the moon's lateness. [442]
To her, they were not luck but proof, that they had waited for hands and minutes to meet at this hinge. [463]
A thistle-blown hope rose in her, light but stubborn, drifting yet determined to snag a sleeve and ride to town. [483]
The first light through the mended prism did not blaze, but shimmered, a pale thread stitching an air seam you could near taste. [506]
Then the wheel halted, snagged on years, and the beam died against the night like a swallowed word. [524]
Kera did not curse; she returned her hands to the prism and the shard of hush, inviting the silences to teach. [545]
Backwards slid the ruin-horizon: she saw the beacon before storms, a ship's answering lamp, two lovers sharing a lantern of soup. [566]
Further still, a child counted down from ten, a spark leaped, and the dance of lenses found its perfect breath. [586]
When it faded, she exhaled to match that remembered rhythm, turning the wheel in time, aligning the prism to the old inhale. [608]
This time the beam flexed, found the copper threads, and carried along them, a river discovering a forgotten braid. [627]
She swept the beam across the waterline and the cracked highways, painting cracked billboards and wave-bitten roofs with navigable whiteness. [647]
In the east, a flare answered, low to the shore, green as kelp and deliberate as a nod from distance. [667]
Kera's heart leaped with caution; she memorized the cadence of the flare, its repeats, the pauses like stepped stones. [686]
She decoded its asking by tracking star paths again, taking the flare's intervals as constellations set upright and read. [705]
It spelled, through absence and light, We wait where the rails vanish, and the note it carried was a human throat. [726]
She angled the beam to reply, leaning on the shard's hush to keep the line steady, and called them home. [746]
It was no coincidence that a boy's hunger bought the wedge, that wind sang the right key, that she had survived. [767]
These small alignments braided into a purpose she could carry, thistle-blown hope toughening to rope as the pavilion hummed them toward landfall. [789]</story>
