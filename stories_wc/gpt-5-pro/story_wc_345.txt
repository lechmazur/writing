<story>This tale begins after strangers become family, when the orchards woke hungry and the sky forgot rain. [17]
We lived on an orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, whose shadows braided our fields like patient trellises. [36]
Between the arches ran old city sidewalks, deserted now except for our chalk and the footprints of riddled leaves. [55]
At dawn we met them glowing pale, and we traced our plans in quiet lines the dew could not swallow. [75]
The plan arrived through messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn, letters that seemed to know everyone by name. [94]
The author of those letters was an altruistic ghost who kept us from despair with instructions drawn like constellations. [113]
We called them Vine, because they pulled us along from trellis to trellis, binding us gently to each other. [132]
By then, we were strangely trustworthy to one another, not by oath but by the work we had already survived. [152]
Vine wrote that a nebula of respite was migrating low this season, skirting our world like a thirsty caravan. [171]
If we could ring the soil properly, it would loosen the sky and coax the vapor down through the arches. [191]
The only instrument left from the old parks was a butterfly garden watering bell, green with age and etched with wings. [212]
It dripped and chimed at once, singing water into the dust, delicate as a folded thumb on a music box. [232]
Vine instructed us to carry that bell beneath each floating rock arch in sequence, matching a choreography the clouds remembered. [252]
To orchestrate collective effort, they mapped relays across the sidewalks, pairing elders with children, grief with patience, muscle with song. [272]
They asked us to reexamine our grudges and swap the shifts we were sure we owned, as though time belonged to the orchard. [295]
Because this was after strangers become family, nobody refused when the relay passed their door or their ache or their memory. [316]
We began at dawn, our shoes whispering on the deserted walks, the bell wrapped in cloth and dignity between palms. [336]
Vine drew arrows in chalk to show how wind would carry the chime, and we followed like apprentices to wind. [356]
Under the first arch, the bell sounded like a moth landing on a drum, soft but certain, a vow with wings. [377]
Sapling leaves shivered as if listening, and the light pricked with that brambled hope we had learned not to chase. [397]
Each household moved the bell onward, tapping its lip with measured wrists, letting droplets fall like tiny baptisms for tired roots. [418]
My daughter, Ana, held the handle as if it were the wrist of a sick friend, and she did not tremble. [439]
She had been saved once by Vine, who warned us of a rockfall with a spiral etched before breakfast on our steps. [461]
Because of that, the ghost was strangely trustworthy even to the wary, a presence like rain written in a foreign hand. [482]
By noon the arches had drunk a hymn, and the wind began to change, speaking in the low vowels of thunderless weather. [504]
We paused to eat bread and pickled pears beneath a cantilevered boulder, watching dust braid itself into faint spirals of silver. [525]
Vine wrote, Ascend the archway at dusk, where the faultline kisses the orchard road, and tip the bell toward sunset. [545]
So we climbed, parents lifting children, children lifting the bell, neighbors lifting names once spoken as curses and now as trust. [566]
At the height of the stone, Ana tilted the butterfly garden watering bell, and its note slid across the valley. [586]
The arches joined the sound, each one answering with a throat we had not known it possessed, and the sky unbuttoned. [607]
From the west the nebula of respite slouched over the ridge, a woolen body of vapor that smelled like old orchards in spring. [630]
It met the music, slowed, and dissolved into threads that stitched the arches to the clouds and the clouds to our mouths. [652]
We opened our lips and drank, not water yet but permission to rest, a cool hush that told us to breathe again. [674]
Then the dew came, soft as the belly of a moth, beading every leaf, every scar, every word Vine chalked. [694]
We watched the orchards sip and swell, watched children tilt their heads to catch drops, watched elders sit without apologizing for sitting. [716]
In the hush, the ghost traced one last spiral on the sidewalk, and I knelt to read before the dew erased it. [738]
Reexamine what you call haunting, it read, and remember this planet rings best when your voices braid like vines. [757]
I asked then, though I did not know if a ghost has lids to lower, whether Vine would finally sleep. [777]
The chalk said no, only that rest had been returned to our mouths, and that was nearer to sleep than dust. [798]</story>
