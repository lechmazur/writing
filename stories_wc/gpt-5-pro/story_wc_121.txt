<story>The night began at the glowing viaduct after rain, where the stones still remembered light. [15]
I, Lio, known to the city as the gravity defier, floated a thumb's width above the slick arch. [33]
Every lamp cast a halo that grew thinner with each minute, a darkening brightness that felt like breath fading. [52]
I had come to wait between the drop and the ripple, the smallest gate in the world. [69]
The rain had slowed to single notes, spaced like decisions I was afraid to play. [84]
In my pocket lay an ancient clay tablet with runes, heavy as a verdict and warm as a pulse. [103]
The tablet was my map and my mirror, a device older than memory and somehow exactly mine. [120]
I had learned its grammar from storm drains and dusty ledgers, its logic from dreams refusing to end. [138]
It promised that my scattered moments could be threaded if I accepted the rules of fractured timelines. [155]
I was periodically eternal, condemned to restart and recall, never dying but never arriving. [169]
My failures reset to the same wet hour, and the same lamp buzzed through my skull like a gnat. [188]
I was here to conquer the labyrinth of self, or be divided by it until the stones forgot me. [207]
The tablet said I could only enter through procedural generation, seeding the maze with my heartbeat and breath. [225]
I touched its runes and whispered the cadence I had measured in earlier lives. [239]
Arches multiplied inside the arch, and every puddle turned into a door that knew my weight. [255]
I stepped sideways, letting gravity forget me, an old trick the city never understood. [269]
The first chamber was a memory of my mother counting tiles, except the numbers were missing their middles. [287]
To proceed, the tablet required I retrace every step she had taken, including the one she only imagined. [305]
I moved as she had, and where her doubt had paused, a stair formed out of thin rain. [323]
At the landing I found versions of myself staring through the balusters, each holding a different possibility like a wound. [343]
One smiled, mouth full of river light; another closed his eyes against a train that never came. [360]
The fractured timelines had not only split my choices, they had taught my faces to contradict each other. [378]
I breathed the rain, counted to twelve, and chose the staircase with the weakest echo. [393]
The rule on the tablet glowed: reflect, rotate, invert, then proceed as if forgiven. [407]
I reflected on the boy who refused the apology; I rotated the scene until my face faced me. [425]
I inverted the guilt into heat, and proceeded, staggering at the sudden drop in temperature. [440]
Below me the viaduct repeated itself like a song learned by water, each refrain shorter than the last. [458]
I met a guard made of drizzle and touch, asking what right I had to float past my sins. [477]
I answered that the right was not mine, but borrowed from a future that needed this corridor to exist. [496]
The guard stepped aside and became a misted window, where I watched myself laying the tablet on a bed. [515]
In that room, I did not float; I fell into her hands and learned stillness as a rough kindness. [534]
The scene flickered, and the lamp above the arch lost another beat, the darkening brightness turning thoughtful. [551]
I pivoted back to the central span and felt the cycle tightening like a belt around the hour. [569]
The tablet warmed until the runes pulsed, and I knew the only exit required me to fall for once. [588]
To bind what was broken, I aligned every reflection and waited, precisely between the drop and the ripple. [606]
There I released the habit of resisting, let gravity adopt me, and the arches stitched themselves into a single road. [626]
For a breath the world became periodically eternal, not because I was trapped, but because I finally arrived. [644]
The alternate selves closed their eyes, and the guard dissolved, and the future paid back its loan with rain. [663]
A ripple carried the lamp's tired light down the canal, and I retrieved the tablet, drying it with my sleeve. [683]
Its runes now spelled a single line, a promise that the maze would stay closed if I kept walking. [702]
I crossed the stones like a beginner, feeling their rough patience as if for the first and last time. [721]
The city had not changed, but the tune of the arches had shifted from warning to welcome. [738]
Above me the rain finally stopped, and the air, emptied of music, held a clear and mortal hush. [756]
I floated only long enough to thank the habit; then I walked home under the quiet arches like everyone else. [776]
Behind me, the viaduct dimmed, its darkening brightness complete, as the world learned how to keep me only once. [795]</story>
