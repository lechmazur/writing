<story>At the moonlit summit of the old cinder cone, I set my tripod into pumice and waited. [17]
I am a crater inspector, sent to log micro impacts and the moods those scars imprint overnight. [34]
Tonight, my purposefully curious heart has smuggled a second mission past the checklist. [47]
I have come to photograph the last of something precious before the world edits it away. [63]
The consortium's orbital mirrors will bloom at sunrise, bright logos stitched across the early light. [78]
In my pocket is a nightwatch's hourglass sand grain, the last from our observatory keeper's timer. [94]
It plugs a glass capillary in a small vial, delaying two reagents from touching until the chill lifts. [112]
I learned the trick from the old nightwatch, using chemical reactions for timed messages on stormy nights. [129]
When dawn warms the vial and the grain slides, iron meets ferrocyanide, and blue letters will bloom. [146]
The message will be the last words my mentor left for me, a final calibration and farewell. [163]
We keep time oddly in these mountains, measuring nights by meteors and reactions instead of clocks. [179]
And still I carry a camera with real glass and film, because it forgives me for trembling. [196]
During the space age, satellites talk endlessly, but silence still has something to say to me. [212]
The hush before sunrise is a dawning hush, the kind that holds space for grief and aim. [229]
I line the crater's rim with pennants of foil, to mark wind directions that no longer blow. [246]
Below me the crater lake shines like a pupil, reflecting a scattered braid of shooting stars. [262]
Every new streak is a tiny hollow I will visit next week, clipboard in glove. [277]
Our logs keep impacts from becoming myths, and myths from forgetting their stones. [290]
But the sky, soon, will become an advertisement, and the last unbranded dawn is precious. [305]
To outlast the fatigue gnawing my hands, I recite formulas and names of fallen bolides. [320]
My mentor had called me purposefully curious, not just nosy but faithful to questions. [334]
That is why the ritual matters. [340]
I kneel by the vial set into a ring of basalt chips and breathe through the mask. [357]
Inside, cold keeps ferric chloride from meeting ferrocyanide, postponing a sky colored answer. [370]
When it warms enough, the nightwatch's hourglass sand grain will fall, and everything will run. [385]
My camera ticks with the last seconds of a long exposure, swallowing the Milky Way like bread. [402]
I think of the first crater I certified, a modest bruise beside a shepherd's pine. [417]
He had asked if the star had meant to land there, and I learned not to laugh. [434]
Purpose gives gentleness to curiosity, and I have tried to deserve his field. [447]
A breeze tugs at the pennants, smell of cinder, juniper, and cold iron in the mask. [463]
A band of pale arrives along the far horizon, and the lake turns to tarnished coin. [479]
The consortium's countdown murmurs on my radio, then cuts as they switch to public triumph. [494]
In the dawning hush, their silence makes the mountain larger than my breathing. [507]
The vial clinks, a mouse of sound, and the sand grain releases its grip. [521]
Blue climbs along the thin paper strip I threaded through the vial, like frost becoming script. [537]
I pull it free and hold it to the waning stars, letters blossoming as if warmed by memory. [555]
It reads, simply: Take it, now, before the billboards teach your eyes new names for light. [571]
I swing the camera, change to fast film, guess the exposure, and kneel into the tripod shadow. [588]
The first mirror array flickers above the ridge, a pale geometry beginning to sell dawn. [603]
I press the shutter and hear the briefest thunder of cloth and spring, a last honest sound. [620]
The film drinks what remains of unpurchased sky, and something in me steadies. [633]
The arrays brighten, and logos comb their antlers across the day, hunting for buyers. [647]
I wind the camera, then stop, because there will be no second last. [660]
I tuck the paper strip beside the vial and listen as wind threads through pumice shoals. [676]
I should be triumphant, but dawnlit melancholy hangs like smoke in my hood. [689]
Even during the space age, endings still prefer to suggest themselves rather than declare. [703]
I hold the nightwatch's hourglass sand grain, now stained blue, and set it on the rim. [719]
It is a tiny monument that will outlast no storm, but it gives the moment weight. [735]
Behind me the radio returns, bright with congratulation, and in front the lake forgets the stars. [751]
I frame a last photograph of the crater itself, the rocks, the old scars, my ring of basalt. [769]
The world has changed, but the stone remembers impacts without caring who paid for the light. [785]
That memory is precious, and I have proof curled in the dark of my pocket. [800]</story>
