<story>After the city-wide blackout, the lightning collection tower stood like a dry fountain over the rooftops. [16]
I was its candid toll keeper, a man whose honesty could not be helped. [30]
Lightning had once kissed me sideways, and ever since, speech exited me involuntarily truthful. [44]
I told the queue when storms would fail, when schedules were lies, when wonder was real. [60]
That evening wore the tone of nectar dusk, the sky honeyed and smoky with far rain. [76]
Mara climbed the last stair with a toolbox and a look that weighed more than metal. [92]
She was the keeper of the drone beehives the city trusted to pollinate terraces and prime the tower's static brushes. [112]
They had failed in the blackout, a thousand perfect wings forgetting the dance that kept them alive. [129]
Her worry sat on the railing as if it might jump. [140]
I asked for toll not in coins but in reason, because reason was scarce and I was hired to gather it. [161]
She said the drones were spinning in place, wings surviving, purpose gone, like clocks that still tick in burned houses. [181]
If they did not resume their work, the tower would attract nothing, and the gardens would starve wonder out of mornings. [202]
I reached beneath my bench for my lacquer box, the one with the red sheen that remembered fingerprints. [220]
Inside lay a matchbox containing a cryptic riddle left by the last keeper, who believed lightning respected poetry. [238]
I am sworn, I told her, not by oath but by this mouth, to reveal what I know when asked. [258]
The riddle read, Strike none, but strike one; find the song that climbs. [271]
Mara frowned the way an engineer frowns when asked to listen to a poem for voltage. [287]
I slid a match along the lacquer instead of striking, and the phosphorus left a ghost line that glowed thinly. [307]
The glow curled toward a hairline seam in the tower's base panel, which no manual ever admitted existed. [325]
Inside the panel was a tiny wind harp of copper tines, meant to sing in drafts when the drones danced around it. [347]
Failing drones meant the harp had fallen silent, and the tower, deaf, would not reach for storms. [364]
Mara touched the tines and said the algorithm had overtrained the drones until they forgot surprise. [380]
They were excellent at routine but had lost the shimmer that made currents notice them. [395]
We needed a new queen of motion, not a new lesson. [406]
In my lacquer box lay something else, wrapped in waxed cloth, a dowry from the last storm: a coil of real bee hum recorded in brass. [432]
We mounted the coil beside the harp and wound it, and the tines began to tremble in a wild, uneven music. [453]
The first returning drones circled like sleepers remembering a loved name, then angled toward the tower's brush ring. [471]
Their wingbeats pushed tiny drafts through the screen, and the harp sang louder, calling more. [486]
I watched the sky write its long cursive of light over our heads, the tower remembering its vocation. [504]
Mara laughed without relief, the way a child laughs while still standing near the cliff's edge. [520]
You could have lied earlier, she said, and taken coins instead of risking this. [534]
I cannot, I told her, because the lightning put a wire in my throat that hums when I wander from truth. [555]
It is a nuisance at markets but a blessing at the gate. [567]
Also, I collect wonder as toll, and lies never pay enough. [578]
She looked at the lacquer box and the matchbox and the small glow still coiling around the seam. [596]
That is a strange treasury, she said. [603]
It is the only way I know to preserve wonder in routine, I answered, and the words tasted like something sweet a hive might save for winter. [630]
The city lights coughed awake in neighborhoods, thin veins of brightness, but the tower held the largest flame, steady and speaking. [651]
News would say later that a firmware patch fixed the drone beehive failure, and maybe it did. [668]
But I keep the matchbox near, because sometimes thunder needs a riddle to remember it is music. [685]
When workers come with tired faces, I ask them for a small story before the stair, and they pay gladly. [705]
In return I tell them what I can, and sometimes more than I should, because truth does not stop at tollbooths. [726]
Nectar dusk comes again and again, and in it I practice our craft, not of taking but of listening for the current that wants to leap. [752]
So when Mara returns, I will lift the latch, open the lacquer, wind the brass, and let the sky teach us, once more, how to be astonished. [779]</story>
