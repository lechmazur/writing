<story>After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon, I slip into the cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites with my careful satchel. [22]
I am a secretive conjurer, gently inventive by necessity, because secrecy softens in the echoing dark and invention keeps the hush from tightening. [45]
My aim tonight is simple and impossible: to understand the mathematics of emotion through the orchard's hidden arithmetic of drip, root, and stone. [68]
That need grew from ambiguous loss, the kind that leaves a chair at the table and a phantom heartbeat in the pillow. [90]
My apprentice walked into fog years ago and never quite returned, neither gone nor present, a theorem unfinished, a proof missing its last line. [114]
So I began collecting instruments that could argue with absence, and the oddest of them is a taxidermist's glass eye pair. [135]
They sit in a velvet box, pupils lacquered deep, catching stalactite drips like fallen stars, and they look both foolish and holy. [157]
Eyes that never lived can listen, if you teach them a grammar of mineral radiance and patient pulse. [175]
To tune them, I set them upon a mosaic stepping stone beside the oldest tree, and I read their reflections like equations. [197]
I work via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, aligning cracks with constellations, dovetailing the drip tempo with memory's inconvenient rhythms. [220]
The orchard accepts a measurement only when it has been sung, so I hum, and the stalactites answer in tiny decimal pauses. [242]
Beneath their patter, there is a table of correspondences, where joy equals expansion, sorrow equals contraction, and longing equals oscillation that refuses to damp. [266]
My apprentice once laughed that such tables were childish, but he kept returning, hungry for the next pattern, the next almost solution. [288]
He learned that emotion has edges you can weigh by their shadows, not their weight, and that love is a ratio between breath and waiting. [313]
Then the fog took him, and my equations went feral, gnawing at the boundaries where proof dissolves into ache. [332]
I am here again, not to trap him, but to dovetail what remains of touch with what remains of number. [352]
I set the taxidermist's glass eye pair on the stone, one gazing upward to the skylight crack, one downward to the root black water. [376]
In their convex silence I watch the smallest gestures: how a drop hesitates before falling, how a leaf tilts toward the echo of a footstep. [401]
The eyes reflect the stone, and the stone reflects the orchard, and the orchard reflects my face, fractioned into tessellations that almost reconcile. [424]
I trace the chipped triangles with a copper wire, I count, I listen, until there is a thin change in the measure. [446]
The stalactites slow their dripping, as if the stone were breathing in, and the numbers wobble toward a limit I have feared. [468]
My apprentice appears, not in body, but in a figure made of refractions, inexact, tender, and steady as a candle inside frost. [490]
He mouths a theorem I taught him and adds a line I never dared, and the orchard leans closer as if to grade us. [514]
It is not proof of life, and yet it is not proof of death, either, and this is the ache's exact coordinate. [536]
I ask the figure to stay, but I ask the orchard to speak, and between them a compromise grows, equal parts mercy and measure. [560]
The apple shaped stones loosen, the glass eyes tremble, and a note enters my chest that tells me what to do next. [582]
I must dovetail grief with practice, allow the unfinished to remain a partner, and let the counting be the touch I can still offer. [606]
So I speak the theorem as I would a lullaby, I breathe when the drips breathe, and I hold the glass eyes without blinking. [630]
The figure steadies, then bows, and the orchard gifts me a single fruit of chalk and salt, the taste of patient recognition. [652]
I realize the orchard does not end the uncertainty, but it offers a continuity, a buried optimism, a line we can carry together. [675]
The mathematics of emotion is not a solution but a scaffold, a way to hold steady while the unknown still breathes. [696]
I pack the velvet box, whisper thanks to the dripping stalactites, and walk out beneath the moon as silence opens like a gate. [719]
Behind me the orchard murmurs its slow calculus, ahead I feel steps I cannot predict, and between them my hands learn to rest. [742]</story>
