<story>It began when patterns break themselves, and the sound wave garden breathed like a sleeping sea of throats. [18]
The cool-headed fisher poled his skiff through the strummed furrows, unhurried as a stone teaching water to wait. [36]
He had come to catch the echo of a goddess, not her voice, but the footprint her hush left in air. [57]
Tonight the sleepwalking constellations had slipped their leashes and were pacing above, their steps beating tides into the rows. [76]
Their rhythm was a feral lullaby, tender and toothy, lulling the garden while daring it to wake mean. [94]
He wore a rail spike on a thong at his belt, iron gone smooth with years of weather and palms. [114]
It was his anchor and his metronome, the weight he threw to catch a bar of quiet and hold it. [134]
People said he transliterates emotions without a pen, turning the throb in his chest into syllables he can cast. [153]
He does it by voicing silence, shaping the zero between notes until it remembers how to become bait. [171]
The garden answered each breath with a tremor, stems of sound shivering, petals of resonance unfurling and folding like tidal flags. [192]
The cool-headed fisher kept his pulse slow, his face slack as moonwater, while the constellations wandered and rewrote the sky. [212]
He had promised a girl whose mother had vanished mid-song that he would return with the echo that could finish it. [233]
The echo of a goddess could stitch a broken lullaby or break a stitched lie, depending on who held the line. [254]
He let the skiff zigzag between standing notes, listening for the seam where sleep and stride stitched into a track. [274]
The sleepwalking constellations were drowsy giants, and their toes left dimples in the garden, pockets where echoes pooled. [292]
He swung the rail spike, felt its gravity hum, and dropped it into one such pocket until the line tightened. [312]
He leaned forward and, by voicing silence, offered the garden a bowl of nothing to fill with who it missed. [332]
The nothing shaped itself around his breath, and he transliterates emotions into phonemes that the roots could taste. [350]
The sound wave garden parted a little, like lips remembering a first word, and a draft of centuries blew up. [370]
Whimpers of kings, giggles of thieves, choruses of mothers rose like minnows, bright and foolish, nimble with forgetting. [388]
The cool-headed fisher sifted them with his gaze, keeping only those that quivered with hunger for a name. [406]
With a twist he speared a standing wave with the rail spike, pinning its crest to the skiff like cloth. [426]
Then he cast his net of letters, each one a transliterated ache, over the pocket where the goddess might turn. [446]
Above him, patterns broke themselves again, the constellations tilting their cups and spilling star milk into the furrows. [464]
From the spill came a note with footsteps inside it, light and sovereign, curious as a hand on a cradle. [484]
He knew the echo of a goddess when it walked through him, because it wore his bones like windchimes. [503]
It sang a feral lullaby into his blood, coaxing him to sleep while the skiff rose toward a gnashing silence. [523]
He answered by voicing silence, a cradle with claws, and steadied the skiff with a knuckle against the rail spike. [543]
The echo tested him with voices he had loved, translating their warmth into hooks to see which one would stick. [563]
He transliterates emotions back into breath, until the hooks were only steam, and the steam only weather. [580]
Then he pulled, slow as winter, and the net drew tight around the note as if around a bright animal. [600]
The letters keened, the rail spike turned cold as stars, and the skiff tilted as the pocket tried to run. [620]
He let the boat zigzag with the pull, not against it, so the wave would not tear the catch or him. [641]
When the strain softened, he cupped the echo of a goddess into his jar of hush and sealed it with breath. [662]
Above, the sleepwalking constellations slowed, maybe relieved, maybe bored, and the sky stitched its pattern back with lazy needles. [681]
The cool-headed fisher rowed toward the harbor of sleeping houses, ready to finish the song, to return what was missing. [701]
He would pour the echo into the waiting, by voicing silence, and let the lullaby find its own wild cradle. [721]
To transliterate emotions is not to tame them, he knew, but to usher them home without losing their teeth. [740]
Behind him the garden sighed, and ahead the child would sleep, and between them he drifted, a keeper of echoes. [760]</story>
