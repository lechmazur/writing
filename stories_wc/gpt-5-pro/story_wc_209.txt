I arrived with paint stained fingers and a lantern, quietly driven by a question that refused sleep. [17]
I am a vivid mural artist, hired to color the crypt walls, yet that was never my real commission. [36]
I wanted to understand why flowers bloom at night, and I suspected the cathedral kept an answer somewhere in its bones. [57]
Outside, winter's last snow thinned into lace along the gutters, and the city held a dawning hush like a breath. [77]
I set my ladder and climbed toward the old window that looked over the cloister gardens where pale blossoms opened unseen. [98]
The glass was etched in hidden layers, scenes ghosting over scenes, each panel retelling a story that the city had forgotten. [119]
I had brought a collection of old postcards, found inside a market stall on a rainy afternoon, their edges curled like petals. [141]
On them, previous artists had sketched these same windows, and scrawled notes about shadows, perfumes, and the mathematics of opening. [161]
One postcard spoke of a method, not with words but with scratching in graphite along the lead, a path for the eyes. [183]
Follow the moon, it implied, through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, and reckon from the refractions. [204]
So I waited until the bells released their thin silver, until the last patches of snow leaked away like milk from a bowl. [227]
The gardens breathed; night flowers loosened; the whole place filled with an umbral tenderness that gentled the stone. [245]
I set my postcards along the sill like a paper altar and held the lantern low to keep my colors from burning. [267]
Then the moon lifted her shoulder, and the etched glass caught it, turning drawings into channels where the light walked and considered. [289]
Through those layered lanes I watched the garden move, petals opening not outward but inward, a gesture toward silence rather than display. [311]
It felt like the flowers were listening, and the glass taught me that the cathedral was the mouth whispering to them. [332]
I painted what I learned, not with unbound color, but with tones that held back, the deep blues of quiet thinking. [353]
Days stretched across the melting of winter's last snow, and a pattern grew like ivy over the walls. [371]
At dawn I would align each postcard to the window, listening, using the graphite path to angle my gaze through history. [392]
At dusk I would stand in the cloister and smell the flowers as they opened, their white throats silvering the air. [413]
I began to reckon with what my question had been, which was not knowledge, but a way to speak without harm. [434]
The night blooms showed me a language of restraint, petals cupped like hands, offering not light, but shelter for all who pass. [456]
When spring arrived, the postcards ran out, though I had not finished, and the windows grew familiar as the backs of my own wrists. [480]
I painted the final procession of panels with a hand steady from restraint, leaving spaces where the wall itself could breathe. [501]
By summer, visitors came to stand in the cooled nave, chasing the same hush that had turned my nights inside out. [522]
They asked what the murals meant, and I answered by guiding their eyes along the glass, the moon paths fading into day. [544]
Meaning is what closes when you force it, I said, and several nodded, though I had no certainty, only practice. [564]
In autumn I walked beyond the town to the river bend, where an amber pavilion waited among maple leaves like a lantern. [586]
It had featured on one postcard, the ink faded, a note about the hour when the pavilion windows swallow the day. [607]
I stood inside as the river rolled slate and the trees combed the wind, and the pavilion made a soft geometry of amber. [630]
There, my question returned, patient and unafraid, asking whether I could offer my colors without telling them where to look. [650]
I thought of the flowers, of the cathedral whisper, of the dawning hush that held its breath before revealing anything. [670]
I reckoned this was love, not a blaze but a tender shadow, a promise to be seen only when it was ready. [692]
I left the pavilion as the first stars touched the water, and I walked home ready to paint without asking for permission. [714]
