<story>Over the hush of winter-cracked fields, the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night breathed like a sleeping lung. [19]
I kept watch among glass aisles and copper grafts, tuning stringed flasks to coax resonant awakenings from the trees. [38]
Their sap remembered thunder, and memory, if sung exactly, could bloom despite the starless dome that swallowed our horizons. [57]
I wore a carved stone bead on a tendon-thin cord, its grooves shaped for breath and the throat of night. [77]
It clicked softly against the glass, and the trees leaned, as if the bead were a heart calling them to wake. [98]
That was when the ashen-veil ghost bride first appeared, no sound, just a bloom of frost along a hanging pear. [118]
She announced herself through ephemeral cameo appearances, a face reflected in pipettes, a hand stroking vapor on the panes. [137]
When I did not flinch, she ghosted between the rows, veil trailing like ash from a wedding torch that never caught. [158]
Her voice was lovingly venomous, every tenderness tipped with a bite that kept my blood awake. [174]
Fool gardener, she said, you would drown a seed to teach it patience, but patience is a dry river. [193]
I asked her why she haunted a place that knew only the hum of recipes and the ache of branches. [213]
She lifted the bead from my chest with two fingers that felt like cold breath, and the bead began to sing. [234]
A thin tone thrummed the tubing, shivered the grafts, and called up a memory that was not mine but lived in the roots. [257]
I saw fields hammered white with winter and a lane where a cart waited, and a bride shivering with flowers pinned to her wrists. [281]
She told me she had come to repay a debt across lifetimes, and the orchard was the ledger where our names were inked. [304]
Long ago, in another name, I had left her with a promise and a bead, and winter took both before dawn. [325]
Now the bead had found me again, carved to fit a tongue and the small bones of hearing, an oath turned instrument. [347]
The trees craved that oath, because every graft here was an argument with death, and oaths bind arguments when light fails. [368]
Teach me, I said, and she smiled with mournful elation, like a wound relieved to bleed at last. [386]
She taught me through ephemeral cameo appearances, brief intrusions of her hands into mine, quick edits of my breath and stance. [407]
Once she guided my fingers to ghost across a trellis, never touching, and the vine rose as if stroked by wind. [428]
Once she dampened the bead with her breath and laid it on a graft scar, and the scar remembered springtime sap. [449]
Resonant awakenings require confession, she warned, not to the air, but to the unborn sweetness locked in the wood. [468]
So I confessed the old leaving, the cold cart, the silence I had stitched like a veil inside my chest. [488]
The greenhouse answered in chimes, a tinnitus of hope traveling the rungs of ladders and the veins of leaves. [507]
Outside, over the hush of winter-cracked fields, nothing moved, but inside, roots negotiated, and sap struck bargains with memory. [526]
She told me the endless night was not punishment, only a held breath, waiting to hear its name spoken true. [546]
Say it, she said, and when I used the bead to mark the rhythm, I spoke her name that was mine. [567]
The grafts shuddered, the flasks foamed, and the pears took on a bruise-glow, like moons taught to remember sunrise. [586]
For a breath, she stood fully present, not cameo but center, ash lifting from her veil like steam off morning bread. [607]
Her eyes held both graves and bells, and her smile was the architecture of every harvest I had ever wanted. [627]
Then she pressed the bead into my palm, a final weight, and said the debt is paid when you keep paying. [648]
Her laughter was lovingly venomous again, because she knew I would obey out of love and fear of failing her twice. [669]
She dissolved back into the panes, an outline in condensation, leaving me to ghost the aisles with bead and breath. [689]
I tend this ledger of sap and stars, and every night the resonant awakenings write a kinder ending for our beginning. [710]
Across the glass, the fields sleep on, winter-cracked and hushed, while the orchard remembers us, and we are finally remembered. [730]</story>
