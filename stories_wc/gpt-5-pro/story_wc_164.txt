<story>I am the sea-foam recollectionist who tends the bright sorrow of the coast. [13]
Today I climbed inland to an iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode. [26]
The light there grins sadly, a cheerful gloom that suits my work. [38]
I came to discover why some paths disappear, and I needed to do it before memory fades. [55]
The cave eats footpaths like a tide eats castles, leaving missing pieces in the mind. [70]
Those missing pieces paper over the centuries, but the rupture keeps humming. [82]
My hands carried a disk of crater glass, black and star-pocked, born where a meteor had kissed sand. [100]
When I hold it to my ear, the beach speaks in little fizzing vowels. [114]
When I hold it to the cave, it transliterates emotions into glyphs of pale soot. [129]
I use those glyphs as a map, because the cave forgets in motion the way water forgets in foam. [148]
The first corridor blinked, then slid sideways with a sound like turning pages. [161]
I followed the shimmer, light stepping on crystal ribs, humming a tune to keep my courage honest. [178]
Somewhere above, a migrating bird had crossed the chalky sky weeks ago, its belly scattered with seeds. [195]
It dropped them through the wound in the geode, little commas in a paragraph of quartz. [211]
I had decided to read the cave via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird. [227]
Each seed took up the cave glow and tilted it, pointing where a path had once nodded. [244]
I brushed them into patterns that the crater glass could taste. [255]
On the disk, soot-lines began to arc and braid, a sentence assembling itself from sighs. [270]
I felt the cave remember the shoes of a girl who danced here and the boots of a miner who hid. [291]
Their trails had not been erased; they had been lifted like stencils, leaving negative corridors. [306]
I made a conjecture, cheerful as a bruise: that the cave protects the softest stories by vanishing them. [324]
It is easier to keep kindness safe when no one can walk straight to it. [339]
But people live by paths, and missing pieces make them fall in puzzlement and stop coming at all. [357]
So I sang to the seed-constellations, inviting them to open like eyes. [369]
Some cracked and sprouted translucent threads that draped the air and quivered when I breathed. [384]
The threads followed the erased corridors, mapping absences with the delicacy of cobweb math. [398]
I walked their ghost-bridges and pressed the crater glass to each junction where nothing was. [413]
The disk transliterates emotions into travel instructions, which the threads swallowed gladly. [425]
The cave listened through its glittering ribs and sighed like a bell after rain. [439]
Where a path had disappeared, a new compromise blossomed, half visible, half song. [452]
Travelers would feel a tug like the memory of a hand and see a faint ribbon of glow. [470]
They would not trample the tenderest endings, but they would not be stranded staring at blank stone either. [488]
I met the migrating bird itself in the heart of the geode, where it pecked at mica like a mirror. [508]
Its eye held continents, and in the pupil I saw my own shoreline folded up like a letter. [526]
It tugged a thread that hummed the miner and the dancer into a chord, and we three listened. [544]
I promised to keep the cave safe without swallowing everyone whole, and the bird promised to drop seeds wisely. [563]
It would scatter signposts instead of erasers, and I would guide the listeners with soot. [578]
As we spoke, the cave shed a sharp laugh that cut the dark into ribbons of blue and green. [597]
Cheerful gloom, it said without a mouth, and I agreed, because sadness is beautiful when it helps. [614]
I set the crater glass on a ledge and traced the final glyphs, fingers smudged, smile shadowed. [631]
The map was not a prison but a melody anyone could hum if they were soft enough. [648]
Outside, the tide licked stone and left me newsprint foam, a script I would read at dawn. [665]
I am the sea-foam recollectionist, and this is how I keep what matters from turning to silence. [682]
Not by clutching, but by learning which missing pieces want to be paths and which want to be songs. [701]
The cave will still rearrange itself, but it winks now, and leaves a ribbon when it closes a door. [720]
If you come, walk lightly and listen to your footsteps, because they are already teaching me to write. [738]
I will transliterate their happiness and fear and give it back as a way through. [753]
And if the path you wanted disappears, do not despair; it is only resting where kindness hides. [770]
Follow the faint ribbon, the seed-born thread, and feel how absence can hum you home. [785]</story>
