<story>It is after the hedgehog uncurls that my work can begin. [11]
The grove holds its breath, an intensely quiet room made of leaves and thin green light. [27]
I am the tree-song sculptor, apprenticed to sap and wind and patient wood. [40]
I come here to create music in a silent world, because silence is not the absence of sound but of listening. [61]
The siskin alder grove rises from the riverbank like an organ of small gray pipes. [76]
Each trunk is strung with lines I fashioned from salvaged telephone wire and spider silk. [91]
They run to a porcelain insulator I bolted to a dead stump, a pale ear for the grove. [109]
Its glazed body remembers storms, and memory is a resonant thing. [120]
I am symphonically minded, but not toward grand crescendos, only toward the gentle alignments of living fibers. [137]
To tune the grove I studied ruins in the city, where the museum toppled and froze like a staggered chord. [157]
There I learned by analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture whose marble shoulders bore a broken silence. [175]
Cracks reveal fault lines of weight and wish, the very currents of a vanished hand. [190]
I mapped those lines into intervals, a grammar for trees that had forgotten their verbs. [205]
Back in the grove, I pressed my ear to bark and felt empathy in motion, slow and circular. [223]
What moves the alder moves me in return, and the return is where melody begins. [238]
I stitched copper leaves along the windward sides, then ran the lines through the insulator to a hollow log. [257]
The log is my body double, a chest to breathe for the grove when even the birds withhold their questions. [277]
I do not strike or hammer, because those are verbs for noisy places. [290]
Instead I strum the hairline wires with my fingertips, coaxing rather than demanding. [303]
The first tone is a tremor, like a remembered footstep on the other side of the earth. [320]
The second is the river gathering its coat and pretending that movement is not confession. [335]
Between them a hush stretches, holds, and becomes a room I can walk through. [349]
I step lightly, placing weight as a sentence places commas, with regret and intention. [363]
Today the hedgehog watches from the fern roots, his quills slicked with dew, deciding the hour for bustling. [381]
When he nods and unfolds, I feel permission to continue, a small ceremony of witness. [396]
I was a child when the sirens ended, and the world took a vow to hear its own muscles. [415]
Many mistook that vow for ruin, but I took it for study. [427]
I learned the names of fractures, the ways pressure migrates, the sympathy of materials across seasons. [443]
Now my hands read alder the way a blind reader traces braille, fingertip to letter to breath. [460]
The grove answers with tiny shifts, a leaning toward or away, an opening of ringed hearts. [476]
I keep time with my breathing, not counting beats but noticing how the exhale warms the wire. [493]
When wind arrives, I touch the insulator, and the glaze cools my thumb like a sip of winter. [511]
It is the oldest ear here, and it refuses to hurry, so I match its refusal. [527]
The melody forms as something we do together, empathy in motion translated into patient vibration. [542]
A twig snaps somewhere beyond the bend, and the sound arrives like a visitor who remembers my name. [560]
But the grove keeps its lesson, and I keep mine, neither rushed nor delayed. [574]
Our instruments are breath, bark, wire, porcelain, patience, and the small animal that decides morning by feel. [591]
When at last the phrase arrives, it is not loud, but it steadies the air as if mending fabric. [610]
I offer it to the river, and the river answers by letting the current lean against my ankles. [628]
I offer it to the hedgehog, who blinks once, shows his small red mouth, and resumes his bustling. [646]
I offer it to the grove, which does not applaud, because applause belongs to rooms that fear endings. [664]
Here there is no ending, only continuance, and the promise of more listening when the hedgehog curls again. [682]
I wind the wires to rest, leave the insulator to dream of sky, and collect my tools. [699]
My motive remains simple as sap rising: to create music in a silent world, and to keep listening. [717]
Tomorrow I will return, symphonically minded and patient, because the world now speaks in small letters. [733]
If I am gentle, the alder will let me read them aloud without tearing the page. [749]
If I am true, the song will outlive me, moving from root to river to wing. [765]
It will travel as a quiet grammar others can feel, and feel moved to follow. [780]</story>
