<story>We live after the shadow detaches, when the world turns too bright and my skin sings with luminous torment. [19]
I am the crafty lantern maker of the floating island tea garden, mending light where shade has abandoned us. [38]
Above the terraces drifts the glass basilica on a floating isle, catching dawn like a cathedral of breath. [56]
Inside its bell of windows, the elders archive dream recording, each slumber translated into choruses of refracted hue. [74]
They say our island floats because memory refuses to sink. [84]
I hold that upward drift with tea and tools, brewing jasmine that steadies hands and tempering flame for lenses. [103]
My method is gem polishing, coaxing facets until a sleeping breath will choose them as its cradle. [120]
While others blow glass, I grind opals thin as petals, and dreams precipitate there like dew on stone. [138]
The lanterns I build do not merely light paths; they remember them. [150]
My motive is simple and unbearable: to fold grief into origami cranes before it devours the garden. [167]
Ever since Lio fell through the sky seam, my shadow went after him, deciding I was not worth trailing. [186]
I wake without silhouette and dress in ache, a brightness that cuts, a sorrow without edges. [202]
In the mornings I rake steam from the shrubs and pour it into cups shaped like little hulls. [220]
Patrons sip clouds and tell me their unwieldy nights, and I set about recording their drift with stones. [238]
I polish, polish, until a gleam opens and takes the story in, like a tide taking shells. [255]
When a lantern accepts a gem, it hums, and the tea garden smells briefly of rain on iron. [273]
To deliver the humming ones, I walk the spiral path that descends while ascending to the basilica above. [291]
Every turn lowers me into myself even as the island rises into a purer wind. [306]
The glass basilica on a floating isle receives my lanterns like a choir catching breath between hymns. [323]
Inside, each recorded dream becomes a color-organ bird that pecks at silence until it sings. [338]
But mine, the ones from my long nights of glare, refuse to perch; they circle as if searching an absent shoreline. [359]
So I begin folding, not birds of light but paper cranes cut from letters Lio never got to read. [378]
I crease each wing with a fingertip still tingling from the grindstone, and whisper a date into the hollow. [397]
A thousand will be required, says the basilica keeper, whose face resembles frost and whose laughter resembles bells. [415]
Not for permission, he adds, but for lift. [423]
Lift is a theorem here, a bargain of buoyancy between dream recording and release. [437]
The cranes will carry the heaviest part, the portion of grief that learned to glow and refused to dim. [456]
If they reach the height where Lio fell, the keeper says, the light might transform, and the shadow might rest. [476]
Days become notches, nights become wheels; I polish gems by lamplight and fold cranes by dawn. [492]
Visitors leave their troubles in bright stones, and I trade them tea and a promise to remember. [509]
When the final crane is folded, my fingers are thin maps, and my palms hold the future like a nest. [529]
I hang the cranes in lanterns, thread them with opal and kite string, and tether them to my waist. [548]
The path to the basilica again descends while ascending, and I feel lower, lighter, and terribly near the top. [567]
Wind slices the bells into ribbons, and the glass walls take our reflection and make it swarm. [584]
I open the lantern mouths, and the cranes rise with their gems, a shoal becoming a firmament. [601]
Their wings beat a remembered cadence, and the basilica resonates until the panes vibrate like held water. [618]
From the light, Lio does not step; instead, my runaway shadow arrives, bearing the weight the cranes have stolen. [637]
It nestles around my ankles, as if the earth were worth touching again, as if darkness could be tender. [656]
I realize it sought not Lio but balance, a place to lean while my heart learned to carry itself. [675]
The birds take one last turn around the bell, then vanish into color, and the torment shifts, still luminous. [694]
I will keep making lanterns, but now they are oars, and the tea garden is my sea. [711]
I will keep recording the sleeping, not to trap them, but to teach their light a way home. [729]
And when sorrow comes again, I will transform it carefully, crease by crease, into wings that know the weather. [748]
Because we live after the shadow detaches, a living is the art of folding brightness without breaking it. [766]
And I am a crafty lantern maker, holding the knot where light and loss agree to stay. [783]</story>
