<story>I found the mountain ranger cabin by scent, creosote and spruce guiding me home like stubborn ghosts. [17]
It was after seeing my own grave on the ridge, a cairn spelling my name in shale. [34]
Jaded wonder clung to me like frost, a numbed awe that still pricked when I breathed. [50]
I am a lucid dream chronicler, though titles feel like paper boats in this weathered sea. [66]
My trade is remembering while sleeping, and sleeping while the mountains remember me back. [80]
I came here to distill chaos into narrative, to compress the wild into sentences that could carry heat. [98]
On the table lay a birch bark scroll, rolled tight with twine scavenged from a storm-blown net. [115]
The rings were still in it, pale scars of seasons, a calendar that never learned digits. [131]
I unrolled it and traced the ridge line, the river, the tiny cross that marked the stranger who was me. [151]
The cabin clock stuttered and leaped, the second hand a skittish trout sliding backward before darting on. [168]
I am chronologically confused, I told the stove, and it replied by ticking like an old heart. [185]
Dates smear, futures backbite, and the past refuses to stay trimmed like a polite hedge. [200]
Feral nostalgia prowled the room, sniffing at the boots I once wore and the lighter I once flicked. [218]
It bit when I looked at the mirror, showing a face that had already practiced being stone. [235]
The grave solved a question nobody asked: whether stories end when our feet stop making mud. [251]
They do not, the mountain said through rafters, they only lean harder on whoever keeps the ledger. [268]
So I kept it, and my method was getting jealous of past selves until they spoke up. [285]
Jealousy is a magnet for loose iron, and memories are all bent nails until you face their rust. [303]
I envied the kid who hiked without checking weather, the surveyor who sang, the lover who carried cinnamon. [321]
Each envy tugged a thread, and the tangle on the scroll began to sort itself into trails. [338]
I slept by the window where the moon could adjudicate, and told the dream I would not be fooled. [357]
When the lucidity came, it was cold and exact, like a plumb line dropped through milk. [373]
I saw the ridge from above and chose to soar, a slow glide on thermals that hummed like bees. [392]
Below, the grave lay like a pupil widening, and I blinked back at myself with borrowed hawk eyes. [410]
Names are traps, I thought, and mine has sprung twice, once in stone and once in paper. [427]
The dream answered by tilting the valley, sluicing every year I had ever worn into one river. [444]
I followed the current to the cabin again, but this time the door opened from my childhood. [461]
Inside sat the surveyor version, coal under his nails, drawing contour lines by licking a broken pencil. [478]
Across from him the lover version rolled cinnamon across her wrist, daring the room to forget. [494]
Between them a child traced weather with a stick on the floor, raining where he wanted thunder to go. [513]
I wanted what they had, so I interrogated my jealousy until it softened into questions they could answer. [531]
The surveyor said, stake nothing you will not reread; the lover said, scent every page; the child said, play. [550]
I woke with those verbs under my tongue and a draft of wind pacing the benches like a patient. [569]
I wrote on the birch bark scroll until my knuckles creaked, mapping envy into paths and paths into story. [588]
The rings accepted ink like winter accepts a shovel, grudgingly, and then all at once with purpose. [605]
I carried the scroll back to the ridge, not to argue with the grave, but to edit its silence. [624]
I read aloud the life we had, the lives we were, and the life we were still risking. [642]
Wind fretted, stones listened, and somewhere a hawk turned its head as if eavesdropping on grammar. [658]
I told the mountain I would keep the ledger, not to win immortality, but to keep the time honest. [677]
If I am to be a tomb and a mouth, then let the mouth keep eating the stone until meaning appears. [698]
Night returned and with it another dream, less dramatic, a quiet ledger where every page signed back. [715]
I did not soar there; I shelved, I dusted, I labeled, and still came away with hands full of stars. [735]
Morning saw me older again, but kinder to the versions that kept me company in the cabin. [752]
Jaded wonder hummed like the stove, and I let it, because awe is better when it knows the bill. [771]
When I closed the door, the scroll rattled softly, a wild animal tamed enough to travel but not to forget. [791]</story>
