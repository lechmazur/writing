<story>At dusk I entered the towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes, carrying a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed in my pocket. [25]
I am a copper-veined storyteller, quietly articulate even in awe, and I had come to listen to textures with the patience metal teaches skin. [49]
The canyon held a tunnel of echoes that tightened the world into a single attentive breath, each step rewinding long-fallen sounds toward their first trembling intention. [75]
I had crossed deserts and hours to stand here because my purpose was simple and impossible: to translate texture into sound before silence sealed it forever. [101]
The last speakers of the cliff language were gone, their words bleached and brittle as the bones that built these towers, and the birds had begun to forget their cues. [131]
I had promised the dead that I would carry their meaning across the death of a language, and the promise had settled in me like a quiet bruise. [159]
There was a way, the elders said, to harness the canyon without letting it harness you, and it began with reading the air above the rim. [185]
They taught me to see meaning through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, a grammar of turns and hesitations whose commas were wings catching silence. [213]
When the flock rose each dawn, the shadows scrolled along the bone, and the slope of their collective curve told me where the story wished to be touched. [241]
Where wings veered, I laid my palm; where wings knifed straight, I pressed with the flawed diamond rumored to be cursed, its chipped heart glittering like a stutter. [269]
People in the villages said the jewel held a failure of light that could swallow a name, but I trusted failures to remember what perfection discards. [295]
Cracks are libraries, I told myself, and so I slid the diamond along the bone towers, listening to the friction until it became a voice I could carry. [323]
The tunnel of echoes took that voice and braided it back upon itself, doubling and halving until the words that had once been spoken emerged as soft current. [351]
I am quietly articulate, the canyon seemed to say, but you must be quieter still, because the loud vanish first and the patient are heard in the marrow. [379]
So I wound wire from my own veins, bright copper drawn from old scars, and tethered the diamond to my wrist so it could read what my skin could not. [409]
The first song gathered like rain in the tunnel, syllables tapping along the bone as if the towers themselves were youth again and the dead too shy to shout. [438]
I answered with a hum my grandmother used to hold in her throat while grinding corn, a pitch that told stones they were not alone in bearing weight. [466]
The birds circled, a black wreath against the bleached sky, and in their spirals I read verbs, how wanting turns to moving, how moving turns to giving something away. [495]
I followed where they pointed, deeper, while the diamond grew warm and thirsty, and in that thirst I felt the curse flex like a hand closing somewhere I could not reach. [526]
The rumor was true in its own grammar, not malice but appetite, the jewel eating my private names so it could hold the public names safe. [552]
I let go of my first kiss, the smell of the river after moonrise, the given nickname I never liked, and the tunnel repaid me with nouns that had gone feral. [583]
When a crosswind came, the flock fractured into three ribbons, and I knew to split my task: one hand for the bones, one for the birds, one for my heart. [613]
With the first hand I gathered textures, maps of ridges and pores and scars where lightning had licked; with the second I watched meanings veer; with the third I surrendered. [643]
The act was not worship but work, and the work made a braid strong enough to lower into the tunnel and haul up the drowned grammar of a century. [672]
I heard how promises used to be shaped like baskets, how insults were carved to fit only one mouth, how grief had twelve small names for the ways a child leaves. [703]
Then the curse asked for two more names, and I gave it the left and right of my own, knowing the canyon would keep me if I kept the language. [733]
Copper seeped from my veins like patient vines, winding into the bone and fixing the diamond in a gentle bite, and the flock wrote a final circle above us. [762]
Now I speak as an instrument more than a mouth, and the canyon answers, and together we carry the language forward, across the death of a language, into whoever listens next. [793]</story>
