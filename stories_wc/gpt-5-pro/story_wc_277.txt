<story>After the journalist calls, I climb to the echoing observatory above clouds, where the floor hums like a printing press deciding which stars deserve the front page. [27]
I am the newsprint heiress, a headline princess grown into a reluctant queen, devotedly observant and already composing questions in margins only I can see. [52]
The call was a whisper that our observatory's images were staged to flatter a donor, and the whisper had the brisk cadence of a front-page correction. [78]
I carry my grandmother's rosewood pen nib in a pocket tin, a relic that smells like inked thunder, because truth writes better when history pricks your palm. [105]
The dome exhales echoes as if the sky were a hollow cello, and my footsteps arrange themselves into the kind of beat that helps people tell the truth. [133]
Dr. Kline is waiting by the primary mirror, possessed of the steady, cruel patience of someone who believes galaxies forgive them because their equations are tidy. [159]
He offers coffee, but I decline and ask to see the raw logs, the plumbing where ambition sloshes and sometimes clogs. [180]
We sit beneath the shutter that opens like a slow eyelid, and the wind hisses through its lashes, playful but solemn about its ancient obligations. [205]
He starts his story, and I let the words orbit, because I know orbits of regret: the repeating pull of almosts, of what-ifs that pretend to be gravity. [233]
My father loved this mountaintop, but he loved being right even more, and both loves circle me whenever a mirror shows me the sky and myself together. [260]
The journalist said there were two altered exposures attached to a celebratory article, and that the article would publish tonight unless I intervened. [283]
I tell Kline my motive is simple: to discover hidden truths, and to keep our paper from printing a sky it cannot later live under. [308]
He says the images are genuine, but a donor insisted on a brighter palette, as if Jupiter were a billboard that needed cheer. [331]
So I proceed through proof by contradiction, because logic is just journalism with a tidy headline and numbered paragraphs. [350]
Assume the donor touched nothing, I say; then explain why the raw log shows a calibration lamp active during the supposed science exposure, a lamp that would bleach real color as surely as gossip bleaches kindness. [386]
Assume the palette was honest, I continue; then why does the histogram wear a top hat, flat and theatrical, when the instrument's native curve likes to sulk? [413]
Kline looks at the graphs, and the graphs look back like children who have been told to behave and, in doing so, confessed everything. [437]
He blames the outreach coordinator, then the intern, then the moon for being too pale this season, but the echoes in the dome dislike evasions. [462]
From the catwalk, a technician in a fleece vest is typing toward deletion of the calibration logs, and the cursor blinks like a fuse. [486]
This is where I intervene, not as royalty of ink but as its janitor, broomed by duty and a little giddy with fear. [509]
I climb the stairs and place the rosewood pen nib beside the keyboard, the tiny spear that once signed strikes and truce, and I ask for one honest minute. [538]
Then I argue again through proof by contradiction, but this time the audience is a frightened person instead of a graph. [559]
Suppose you erase the logs; tomorrow my paper prints a triumphant image; the donor beams; months later, a graduate finds the missing pixels, and your name orbits the story like a cold moon. [592]
Suppose you do not erase the logs; the article halts; we publish a confession with the data attached; the anger burns clean, and the sky earns back its quiet. [621]
The technician surrenders the mouse, and Kline surrenders a shiver, and I feel the orbits of regret widen, the way a planet moves outward when a sun loses weight. [650]
We draft a statement with the nib scratching the paper's skin, solemn playfulness in every comma, promising to discover hidden truths even when they reduce our shine. [677]
When dawn flips the clouds into a pocketful of coins, I call the journalist back, and the observatory echoes thank you in a tongue we can finally print. [705]
Below us, the city prepares coffee, not knowing its morning will taste slightly of pen and contrition, and above us, the stars keep their counsel and still appear generous. [734]</story>
