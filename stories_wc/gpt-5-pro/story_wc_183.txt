<story>The abandoned carnival ship drifted in the foggy bay like a stalled parade. [13]
Paint peeled in ribbons, and rust sang a quiet metronome beneath the creak of rides. [28]
I came alone, though my shadow came doubled, as it always does. [40]
They call me a chimera twin discoverer, and I suppose I am. [52]
I found my own twin folded into my marrow, a second history stitched inside. [66]
Discovering others came later, but tonight I sought something older than blood. [78]
I crossed the listing gangplank to find the garden of forgotten names. [90]
A carnival garden needs water, caretakers, and delight, but this one needed remembering. [103]
People insisted it bloomed only as memories alter, unfurling petals when stories finally align. [117]
My hands shook from the cold and from the nearness of what I had named. [132]
I carried an emerald swatch card from a paint shop, edges frayed by pocket storms. [147]
The ship had been painted in clashing joys, and this shard matched a secret door. [162]
Not a key, exactly, but a promise in color, the way childhood remembers thresholds. [176]
Beneath a tangle of rigging and carousel horses, I found the door to the funhouse. [191]
Someone had stenciled a green square on its hinge like a whisper of passage. [205]
I pressed the emerald swatch card against it, and the hinge exhaled salt and sawdust. [220]
The door consented, and I stepped into a maze of mirrors unlit but attentive. [234]
In those panes I was plural, a parliament of me, each with different scars. [248]
We were blissfully aberrant, my choir and I, wrong the way survival is right. [262]
The ship rocked, and the mirrors hummed like a calliope testing a forgotten song. [276]
I spoke to the reflections because that is my work: to recapture the lost. [290]
I do it through narrative threads, tugging on beginnings until endings tumble obediently after. [304]
I told the ship my version of the night my mother erased my other name. [319]
She had whispered it into the bathwater, let it sink like a coin, then smiled. [334]
My reflections listened as if guarding a hearth, but the fire was unkindled solace. [348]
I needed the garden to kindle it, to grow a place where forgotten names root. [363]
The funhouse sloped toward a ballroom deck where rides slept under nets like drowned stars. [378]
I followed the scent of spun sugar and diesel to a stage littered with tickets. [393]
There, an automaton barker turned slowly, gears rasping, his paper smile pleated with mildew. [407]
He offered a deck of cards, each one a swatch of the carnival's lost hues. [422]
I held up my emerald swatch card, and he bowed like a tired constellation. [436]
His arm pointed toward a porthole crusted with barnacles, beyond which the bay breathed asleep. [451]
Between the glass and fog, a horticultural deck waited like a fable too patient. [465]
I wound the barker's key, and his voice coughed to life in brittle rhymes. [479]
Bring her, he said, the twin you carry, for gardens do not open to halves. [494]
I answered that I am the twin and the gardener both, but the ship disagreed. [509]
It tilted until my reflections slid out of their panes and dressed my shoulders. [523]
She stood beside me, salt-lit, wearing my earliest laugh and the name I lost. [537]
Her eyes were the same green as the card, a field distilled to edges. [551]
We walked together, two freedoms tied, a trapped freedom that moved because we leaned. [565]
The horticultural deck had once been a tilt-a-whirl garden, planters bolted to spinning plates. [579]
Now vines climbed the rusted arms, blossoms carried chalked letters that dusted our wrists. [593]
Each flower opened to a syllable, and syllables linked like tired ride-chains. [605]
I could not read them until she held my hand, steadying the trembling grammar. [619]
We braided a path through narrative threads hung between trellises, each thread a story's spine. [634]
When we tugged the right one, a sign flipped, and unmarked soil shivered awake. [648]
As memories alter, so did the bay, fog parting in ribs through which moonwater poured. [663]
Names grew like seedlings, characters of salt and ink that asked for air and witness. [678]
I spoke them aloud, and she echoed them, until the deck hummed with company. [692]
This is how solace kindles, she said, not from silence but from spoken return. [706]
I wanted to drift forever there, but the ship is honest about bargains. [719]
To keep the names, we must recapture the night that drowned them, without drowning ourselves. [734]
So we told the worst part together, and the mirrors held instead of shattering. [748]
Her voice stitched into mine, and the garden leaned closer, tipping seeds into our pockets. [763]
The automaton clapped, rust applauding, and a door within the fog widened toward shore. [777]
We left the ship drifting, our trapped freedom unmoored yet guided by names, a map stitched inside. [794]</story>
