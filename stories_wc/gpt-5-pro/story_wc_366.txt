<story>They say lights die like people: not all at once, but in a hush that brightens what it leaves behind. [20]
I was the reticent lighthouse supply skipper, and my job was to keep that hush from lasting too long. [39]
I did it quietly, because I was not brave, only warmly observant. [51]
I read the water, the gulls, the seams on a fuel drum, and the way a keeper laced his boots. [71]
Up on Briar Neck, the haunted lantern room waited for me like a lung with a held breath. [89]
I always climbed after the lamp flickers out, for that was when the island spoke truest. [105]
The panes would remember heat, and ghosts in the glass would show me the work left for morning. [123]
Once, the work was only barrels and bread, a wrench, a story to break the silence and be forgotten. [142]
But then the anonymous letter chain began to drift across my routes like phosphorescence in a wake. [159]
No one signed; no one needed to. [166]
A folded scrap would be nested in a jar below the stairs, or tucked beneath the last brass rung, and I would ferry it onward. [191]
The handwriting changed, but the impulse did not: to bottle the feeling of safety, and then open it when the weather minded to break you. [216]
Some letters were instructions, like a way of stacking stones as messages on the headlands that let a keeper know if family had come and gone. [242]
Three flat stones meant all is well, two with a wedge meant wait for me, and a single balanced odd-shaped rock meant do not risk the cove. [269]
Some were confessions, salted with lullabies and last looks from winter windows. [281]
One letter arrived wrapped around a piece of sea glass, green as old hunger and smoothed as a kept promise. [301]
Hold this to the light, the note said, and know it is our ship you hear, not the storm. [320]
I held it, and the lantern room sighed as if it remembered a child. [334]
I wanted to protect that feeling as I would a flame cupped against the gust of an open hatch. [353]
The Board was automating Briar Neck, and men in town had begun to laugh at stones and letters both. [372]
They said the sea required nothing but math and metal. [382]
But I had learned to hear the harbor breathe, and to count by ache as well as number. [400]
On my last clear evening run, I carried a crate of wicks, the jar of letters, and a pocket full of stones rubbed flat by generations of palms. [428]
The keeper, Doyle, had already taken down his children's sketches from the stairwell, and he could not meet my eyes. [448]
He said there were rumors that the letters would be archived, cataloged, displayed behind glass, their breath turned to label copy. [469]
We sat in the kitchen while the kettle failed to boil and the dusk was all pear and salt outside. [489]
He asked what I would do when the lamp did not need my hands anymore, and I did not answer. [509]
I am reticent, and that night I was the shape of silence a room makes when two men fail to say goodbye. [531]
After the lamp flickers out, he said, go up alone. [541]
So I went when the wick guttered and the last moth had chosen its star. [556]
The haunted lantern room held the dark like warm water. [566]
Outside, the tide wrote its cursive against the teeth of the reef. [578]
I set down the jar and the stones and the letters and the little green glass, all of it humming like a rookery at dusk. [603]
I built a message on the floor, three flat stones and two with a wedge, and I balanced the odd one on top as if daring the night to breathe. [633]
Then I unscrewed a wick can and poured a little oil into the inked mouths of the letters until the paper drank and shone. [657]
I pressed the piece of sea glass into the jar's throat, sealing it with wax from an old chart candle. [677]
I was making a lantern that would never burn, a light bottled out of breaths and hands. [694]
This is what the anonymous letter chain had taught me: how to keep the ache from going homeless when the flame goes to sleep. [718]
I could not keep the tower from emptying, but I could keep its promise from being put under glass in a museum where it would never fog again. [746]
The room listened while I did the slow work of custody, and I listened back. [761]
When I finally lifted the jar, the green glass caught the thin moon through the panes, and the whole thing glowed with a luminescent ache. [786]
I left it beneath the last brass rung, nameless, and whispered, protect this. [799]</story>
