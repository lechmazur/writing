<story>At dusk the lighthouse prison off a jagged reef held its breath and its counsel. [15]
The lens turned, slow as a heart made of clockwork salt, casting copperlight repose across the cells. [32]
I kept watch because no one else would keep watch where stories hardened into bars. [47]
I am the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son, raised among alarms that were always answered late. [65]
My father hollered wolves until wolves arrived and found only men, and then men learned to mistrust breath. [83]
I learned to listen the other way, chasing hush where truth once hid behind quiet ripples of air. [101]
In the chapel below the lantern room I pried loose the lattice from confessional, its crosshatch smelling of knees. [120]
I carried it as a sieve for voices and light, a gate my ears could hold and shape. [138]
The place sustains impossibilities, and so I did not question when the hush answered back through wood. [155]
At night the surf wrote instructions in foam, and the gulls hover like commas in an unfinished sentence. [173]
I needed a plan before they find the bodies, if bodies are what absence means when rust listens. [191]
Rumors said inmates had drifted into salt fog and stepped through the lens like a second moon. [208]
Rumors were my inheritance, so I turned them into paths, to thread a labyrinth with your own story. [226]
You cannot ask a place like this directly; you must move obliquely through grain, echo, and polish. [243]
So I read the island through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades, and then deeper. [262]
The door belonged to a cell that never quite closed, as if the tide negotiated its own parole. [280]
Boot heels had written curled hieroglyphs around the threshold, skids of fear and patience practicing the same loop. [298]
I pressed the lattice to the door and listened, filtering the corridor into strips of breath and metal. [316]
A whisper moved, not spoken, more like a subtraction that pulled dust toward itself with a tide of silence. [335]
Chasing hush is not a sprint but a patience that remembers the first lie and chooses not to echo. [354]
I hesitated no longer; I began to hover in earnest, my steps barely claiming the stone with each guess. [373]
A corridor tilted me toward the drowned pantry where brine kept jars of yesterday arranged by gull and gale. [392]
I knew the smell of false panic, the vinegar tang history wipes on its teeth before it lies again. [411]
This was different, a calm that pushed, a copper plate pressing its stamp on the air without ink. [429]
From the pantry another door asked to be believed the way a witness does, with splinters offered as oaths. [448]
I followed the hush through, and the passage stepped downward, skinning me on the ribs of the island. [466]
It ended in the lantern pit, where the turning glass watched without seeing, faithful as a rumor kept warm. [485]
There I set the lattice from confessional into the path of the beam and held my breath to divide light. [505]
The hush bent, revealing where it fed; it fed on certainty, it fed on the relief after a story. [524]
I understood then that the missing were not eaten by sea or wolves but by the ease of being believed. [544]
In this lighthouse prison off a jagged reef, truth takes work, and the lazy truth takes people when tired. [563]
I had to tangle it, to trap its appetite, to thread a labyrinth with your own story so it feasted slow. [584]
So I spoke my path aloud, every scuff I had read, every turn, every gull, every jar of yesterday. [603]
The lattice held the voice in squares, and the beam knitted it forward, wrapping the hush until it paused. [622]
When it paused, the missing breathed from the stairs below, not bodies yet, not answers, just air returned. [640]
They were pressed in alcoves by a promise too easy, a shut door they had not been taught to suspect. [660]
I opened nothing; I only kept the beam steady and the lattice true, and asked silence to carry weight. [679]
Above us the sea rehearsed storms, but inside we let the copperlight repose dress our shoulders like blankets. [697]
I am the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son, and I choose a new inheritance, where caution sings without crying. [718]
I will leave markings that work, not alarms that rot, and I will do it before they find the bodies. [738]
When they do find them, they will find them breathing, and they will glance at the door and believe its scuffs. [759]
They will follow the path back to this lantern where a lattice teaches the ear to separate hush from hunger. [779]
And if the sea still asks for a howl, I will answer with work and quiet, not with wolves. [798]</story>
