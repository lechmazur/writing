<story>After the mysterious package arrives, I, a weary undertaker, open it in my shop where the air holds a chased stillness like folded velvet. [24]
Inside, nested in salt-stained rags, lies a broken lighthouse lens, its facets crazed as if the sea had tried to write on glass. [47]
Beside it, a note in a slanted hand reads, Return this to the Library Below, so the signals may rest. [67]
The word signals stings me, because I know distress signals better than any sexton should, having buried sailors who knocked at nobody's door. [90]
My trade is to give rest a permanent address, a plot under grass with a marker that says, Here, stop, this name belongs. [113]
But the drowned never quite stop knocking, and the lens hums in my hands with a thin code that feels like fingernails on a coffin. [138]
It taps the window, then the floorboards, then my teeth, spelling coordinates in a rhythm I have cursed and obeyed for years. [160]
I go because I am inadvertently stubborn, not out of pride, but because grief runs me the way water wears a channel. [182]
By dusk I hire a rusted skiff and slip past the black headland where the lighthouse used to stand, its crown now a hollow. [206]
The broken lens rides in my lap, and the sea grows patient and heavy, like an old librarian who has waited decades to speak. [230]
Where the coordinates insist, I drop anchor and let the moon and the lens and my own bones line up into an arrow. [253]
The water opens as if someone pulled a drawer in the dark, and I follow because the tapping on my teeth becomes a plea. [277]
We descend into the forgotten underwater city library, stacks of marble and silt, arches ribbed with coral, shelves lacework where spines used to stand. [301]
The skiff scrapes to a halt among signs cataloging things nobody requests anymore, like Names Unrecovered, Bells Without Towers, and Routes That End. [324]
In the atrium, a desk sits where tides cross like whispering patrons, and I finally understand the note, because all around I hear Morse. [348]
The drowned have been sending distress signals to this place, but the messages bounce off the collapsed catalog and echo back into storms. [371]
The broken lighthouse lens is a bottleneck, a prism of grief that splits their calls, scattering mercy into useless color, and I feel shame. [395]
My work is to revitalize rest, to shelve it properly, to bind each wandering voice to an address that will not wash away. [418]
So I lay the lens on the desk, turn its cracked face toward the dome where plankton make a slow alphabet, and wait for the tap. [444]
When it comes, I answer not with words, but with occupancy, the old undertaker's trick of occupying impossible spaces until the dead have room. [468]
I wedge myself between the cracked lens and the watery light, slide into the blade-thin seam where breath and brine agree to share. [491]
There, I feel the city spine shiver, and I press until the messages no longer ricochet, but find shelves whose spines bloom with names. [515]
Books rise from the silt, shaking off eels like tassels, and their pages drink the tapping, ink stretching to meet ink, author folding into addressee. [540]
I realize my stubbornness has always been a corridor, not a wall, and the corridor opens deeper, to a wing labeled Unknown Persons, Kept. [564]
There I find drawers of tide-smoothed teeth, hair combed flat by currents, rings that learned the circular grammar of waves, and I begin to inventory. [589]
Not to keep, but to give back, to assign an address to each sorrow, fixed beneath stone, with an entry in the ledger of quiet. [614]
As I work, the lens cools, its crack remembering how to hold light, and the water no longer rushes like a heart chased across rooftops. [639]
Instead it becomes a chased stillness, pursuit fading into rest, the pressure of the deep resolving into the weight someone calls home. [661]
I sign and stamp each entry with my name and the name returned to it, a reciprocal act, as if we trade addresses gently. [685]
When I surface, the headland is still and the lighthouse stump wears the sky like a shawl, and the skiff barely rocks, as if anchored by gratitude. [712]
In my lap, the lens is no longer broken, just mended into a softer eye that sees where cries go when they stop needing to be heard. [739]
Back at the shop, I place it above the door, not to warn ships, but to welcome their wives and husbands with one less night of listening. [766]
I wanted to give rest a permanent address, and now the city has mine too, written in water and stone where no tide unhouses it. [791]</story>
