<story>After the last forest burns, the tracks shine under a sky emptied of birds and maps. [16]
A dreamless freight guard rides the skeletal train, lamp hooded, pulse steady, an unslept watcher drifting between cars. [34]
His job is simple and merciless: to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners, even when there is no corner left. [55]
The desert ahead is a glowing dune in bloom, each grain lit by sleeping algae fed on the last ash. [75]
He hums a fractured lullaby to keep the cars from remembering who they carried and why they broke. [93]
At his belt swings a chess clock frozen at midnight, both faces arrested like two lungs holding a necessary breath. [113]
It is the key and the burden, the metronome of decisions he refuses to make until the light answers. [132]
He is occasionally everywhere, counted in windows, reflected in steel, faintly present in the water sloshing inside forgotten barrels. [151]
It is a trick he learned from silence, how a person can smear across places through wave functions and still be alone. [173]
The divergent archive waits somewhere beneath the dunes, where the rails knot into a buried yard of impossible switches. [192]
It remembers every path the freight could have taken, each branch where a life burned, bowed, or refused to halt. [212]
He intends to charm it open tonight, to beg at its gates for a handful of unspent futures. [230]
He wants not grandeur, only embers, tiny as syllables, to plant along sidings and in the throats of sleeping towns. [250]
The train hisses to a halt beside a cut where sand has draped itself like curtains around a missing door. [270]
He lowers the lamp and steps down, the dune's glow brushing his boots with pollen colored like drowned stars. [289]
He sets the chess clock frozen at midnight upon the sand, facing both horizons as if to measure two nights. [309]
The faces catch the bloomlight and refuse to move, which is how he knows his moment has finally arrived. [328]
He knees the sand and draws a railman's circle, a knot of lines, a stanza where the math can sing. [348]
Then he begins the old method, tuning the air through wave functions, humming until interference chisels a door from certainty. [368]
The song wobbles like heat over iron, a lullaby with missing notes, a rhythm that limps but will not stop. [388]
From the railman's circle rises a glow not of algae but of letters, each a seed, each a possible helper for the night. [411]
The divergent archive answers in shivers, a switching yard of whispers, tracks laid in parallel and canceling, tracks built from gone people. [433]
He speaks his oath aloud, to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners, and offers his sleep as the price. [453]
The archive wants proof, so he places his palm on the clock, and the midnight freezes further inside his veins. [473]
He is occasionally everywhere as the wave sings, guarding fifteen sidings down the line, even as his body kneels in sand. [494]
He sees pantries without candles, basements where breath has learned to whisper, attics holding manuscripts of rain waiting to be read. [515]
He charms the gates of the divergent archive, not with pleading fingers, but by arranging his absences so that a path appears. [537]
The method is plain to him and impossible to others: he walks in superposition, and his promise collapses the route. [557]
From the opened yard, little sparks tumble out, names without bodies, gestures without hands, kindling for a future that needs to uncurl. [579]
He cups them against the breeze, tucks them beneath sleepers, buries them under stairs, plants them in the sockets of dead lights. [601]
The dune brightens as if remembering noon, and the algae dim to make room for letters sprouting stems and leaves. [621]
He could wake, but he chooses the clarity of being unclouded, because dreaming here would drown the fragile seeds. [640]
So he remains the dreamless freight guard, a shadow standing still while time's quarrel waits inside that paired clock. [659]
Midnight does not move, but around it the rails ripple, and his promises travel outward like slow, safe waves. [678]
Somewhere, a basement's matches catch, and a kettle sings, and someone reads by a glow stitched from rescued maybes. [697]
He lifts the lamp and boards the train again, carrying the archive's whisper under his tongue to feed tomorrow. [716]
The dune in bloom sinks back to breathing, and the chess clock waits, a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive. [738]
He will return when the rails demand it, occasionally everywhere, humming that broken song until the corners answer with light. [758]</story>
