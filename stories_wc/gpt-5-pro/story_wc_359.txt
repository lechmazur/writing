<story>Under the glacier's skin, the ice cavern breathed in ribbons of light and slow patience. [15]
I was the prism-song bell ringer, appointed to give the hush a shape that could endure. [31]
They called that silence the sculpted hush, and they said it kept the world from shattering. [47]
I was synesthetically blessed, seeing every tone as bloom and every color as held breath. [62]
The bells in my frostbitten hands threw prisms like minnows, and their chimes stroked the ice into listening. [80]
Pinned inside my cloak was an amber music sheet, a fossil of song written by trapped sunsets. [97]
When wind found its runes, golden notes rose, and the cavern's veins loosened their centuries. [112]
Tonight the aurora braided above, slow as thought, bright as a vow I had yet to speak. [129]
I had come here to certify wonder as essential, as food and shelter and first light. [145]
Our council measured everything, even awe, and asked for proofs that breath could not supply. [160]
They required a field test, a moment of origin, and a witness willing to stake a life. [177]
So I chose the instant that births all chisels: at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble. [195]
There is a world before that click, and there is another after, and they require a bridge. [212]
The bridge is made of hush sculpted to carry courage and doubt without breaking into noise. [228]
The amber music sheet kept the recipe, each fossil bubble a syllable, each trapped leaf a rest. [245]
I waited within oscillating repose, bell tongues quiet, heart swinging like a slow pendulum over sleep. [261]
Through thin ice the city above murmured, stone by stone, as if rehearsing an argument with time. [278]
The sculptor did not know me, but I knew her pulse, a careful fury learning how to enter stone. [297]
Her studio was a lantern of dust, and the mallet dreamt of collision while the canvas tarp inhaled. [315]
Down here, frostfare waited on my breath, and the cavern's ribs glowed as the aurora deepened its blues. [333]
I unrolled the amber music sheet, and its golden script ticked like old honey coming loose. [349]
I struck the first bell with a finger bone of light, and the tone went rose, then rain. [367]
Color braided the hush, and it began to stand, timid as a foal learning what legs are for. [385]
To unfetter it, I had to walk a measure through the colors of the aurora, and not fall asleep. [404]
Sleep was the danger, because repose here attends in waves, and each wave asks you gently to stay. [422]
I stepped where green asked, where purple hushed, where gold opened a window in my ribs. [438]
My synesthesia bloomed into guideposts, and the tones painted paths through which the hush could travel. [454]
Above, the sculptor lifted her mallet, and time drew back to watch two first strikes collide. [470]
Her chisel kissed marble as my bell kissed ice, and the world hinged on that tender click. [487]
The sculpted hush rose white, like breath on glass, then clarified into a clear room with no corners. [505]
In that room her fear stood against her stubbornness, and I rang once to keep them from tearing each other. [525]
On the amber music sheet, a trapped moth fluttered, and its shadow spelled the measure for courage. [542]
I played its line, and the aurora tilted, pouring a river of teal through the hush's spine. [559]
The hush felt muscle, learned to carry the sculptor's strike back to her hand without trembling. [575]
I added a low bell, and it tasted of pine smoke, so the marble remembered its buried forest. [593]
The mallet fell again above, and this time the tone came home from the cavern, ripe with calm momentum. [612]
The sculptor smiled through dust, the statue's face awake already in the first shaved thread of white. [629]
Down here, I let the bells drift to stillness, and the hush held like a carved harbor. [646]
My task was not to command but to unfetter, not to own but to certify the living presence of wonder. [666]
The council would ask for numbers, yet I would bring them this breathing room and the first statue's unafraid gaze. [686]
I would say it entered the city through the colors of the aurora, and it chose to stay. [704]
I would testify that repose can oscillate without ending, and that such motion keeps courage from snapping. [721]
The cavern cooled, the amber music sheet dimmed, and I folded it like evening, soft and precise. [738]
Above, a new face began to surface, not yet named, but already housed by the hush we raised. [756]
I rested where ice remembers rivers, and the bells hummed their faint goodbye, a tide of returning quiet. [774]
In the retreating glitter, the sculpted hush curled beside me like a cat of light, awaiting the next first strike. [794]</story>
