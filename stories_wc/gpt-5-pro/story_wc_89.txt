<story>After the phoenix rises, I arrive at a fairy-tale orchard blooming under permanent moonlight. [14]
I am the beast whisperer you once teased for bargaining with thunderstruck deer. [27]
I came to reforge a bond beyond death, and the trees know why. [40]
They lean toward me, their petals glistening like small moons, listening with a paradoxically steady hush. [56]
You are somewhere between ash and echo, my love, resistant to the pull of return. [71]
I smell cinnamon nights, cardamom dawns, and the saffron laughter we once folded into rice. [86]
In my pocket waits the fortune from cookie we cracked open on our last trip. [101]
It says, Become what hears you best, under a moon that never tires of rivers. [116]
I laughed then, and kissed your knuckles inked with constellations, not yet studying omens. [130]
Now the paper is warm as a pulse, thin as breath, stubborn as a vow. [145]
I lay it on a stone shaped by hooves and moons, and begin my work. [160]
To conjure you, I must barter with the orchard's breath via the scent of rare spices. [176]
I open cracked vials: star anise like little galaxies, fenugreek like fields of hidden suns. [191]
Cloves prick the night awake, and cinnamon unspools a road that animals trust. [204]
A fox arrives first, her paws whispering, her amber gaze steady as a well. [218]
She circles the stone and breathes our mingled spices, then sits as if guarding. [232]
Ravens follow, folding the moon into their wings, and a stag whose antlers bear blossoms. [247]
They know me, because beasts remember voices that never asked them to abandon themselves. [261]
But I am not here to command; I am here to beg permission to change. [276]
Our bond does not fit the size of a single life, nor a single body. [291]
Yet my bones protest, heavy with human weather, wary of the reluctant metamorphosis waiting. [305]
Grief wants me to break; love wants me to bend; the moon wants witness. [319]
I breathe the spices until their constellations map my lungs, and my nerves quiet. [333]
My hands grow paradoxically steady as tremor leaves to walk elsewhere, perhaps into history. [347]
Fox, I ask, how does the dead speak when the alive pretends to understand? [361]
With stories that lick like fire but touch like breath, she says, and waits. [375]
So I tell our story to the spice-thick night and to your patient ash. [389]
You died in a warehouse conflagration, singing to the trapped pigeons, buying them a path. [404]
I found your hand after, ringless but warm, and I swore the warmth home. [418]
The phoenix took your smoke and rose, and the sky has refused sunrise since. [432]
This orchard began blooming at midnight, and beasts started bringing me dreams to translate. [446]
Each dream said, Not far, not lost, but waiting in the seams of light. [460]
Tonight, I will become what hears you best, and follow the spices' road. [473]
I press the fortune from cookie to my tongue, so its ink knows my name. [488]
Anise winds rise, and the ravens chant my vowels until my throat grows feathered. [502]
Clove sparks braid my hair with smoke, and my shoulders ache for widening bones. [516]
I do not rush, because true hearing requires the slow mathematics of alteration. [529]
Reluctant metamorphosis is not refusal; it is honoring the weather each cell remembers. [542]
Fox noses my knee and says, Halfway is a bridge if both sides step. [556]
So I step, and my mouth opens to the grammar of wind and antler. [570]
The orchard answers with a thousand soft hoofbeats, and the moon lowers like counsel. [584]
Through the spice road walks a shape of embers, wearing your gait and your laugh. [599]
You are different, yes, but also you, my love, and you stop before me. [613]
Your eyes hold constellations like nests, and your voice rustles like wings learning words. [627]
You say, Hear me by being me, and I finish the walk into feathers. [641]
We meet as two birds with the memory of hands, and kiss like comets. [655]
Beasts applaud without applause, the sound arriving as warmth through the soles of night. [669]
In feather-speech you tell me the pigeons rode your smoke out of the blaze. [683]
In ember-speech I tell you my grief learned patience, so we could meet. [696]
Our bond reforges as we fly a slow circle, scattering petals into bright futures. [710]
Below, fox gathers the fortune, and tucks it into a burrow, a root-ward ark. [724]
She sighs, because promises dislike pockets, preferring earth where they sprout into paths. [737]
We land beside the stone, two hearts beating like one drum across galaxies, fierce, near. [752]
The moon watches, patient, and the orchard keeps its vow to host our listening. [766]
I will live between names now, a paradox you taught me to hold tenderly. [780]
And whenever doubt gnaws, I will conjure us again with spices, and fly home. [794]</story>
