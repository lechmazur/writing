<story>When the clocks hummed awake, the music box repairman opened his palms to hear what needed listening. [17]
He worked in a resonance chamber beneath the broken observatory, where sound could be seen as drifting filaments. [35]
The dome trapped whispers of brass and breath, and every echo turned into gears waiting to be named. [53]
Dawn should have been pouring across the floor, but midnight had learned to steal. [67]
He felt that theft as a bruise in the harmonics, a vacancy shaped like a note that refuses to be born. [88]
His motive was simple and enormous, to reclaim the light stolen by midnight. [101]
He was a man who wilts near dishonesty, the way a lily folds when smoke lies about being air. [120]
So he built his workshop from candid metals, whose alloys confessed every flaw before they sang. [136]
People brought him heirlooms that no longer turned, but his favorite tasks were stranger, mending what isn't torn. [154]
He would listen for the future crack hiding inside a lullaby and stitch it closed before it even sighed. [173]
His tools clicked like patient crickets, speaking a dialect of caution and joy. [186]
Pinned above the bench was a tiny red wedge, a chip from philosopher's stone left from an unrepeatable windfall. [205]
It made light weigh more, made truth ring more true, and warned him whenever time spun backward to cheat. [224]
On the first morning without dawn, a covenant of rust came to his threshold. [238]
They were not a guild, not a church, but old engineers who had sworn to let decay keep its music. [258]
Rust, they said, remembers the rain that made it, and memory must not be scrubbed away. [274]
Midnight stealing dawn broke their truce with entropy, and yet they forbade interference, because balance binds all. [291]
The repairman bowed, for he respected their weathered oath, but his heart refused to let the children wake to ash. [311]
Everything in the balance now sounded like a bell held shut by a thumb. [325]
He asked the elders for truth then, and they nodded, admitting what they would not do and why. [343]
The admission steadied him, because he wilts near dishonesty, and the room bloomed when the last evasion left. [361]
He lifted the chip with tweezers, felt it warm like a small obedient sun, and set it in the heart of a drum. [384]
He built a tether out of braided violin hair and sailor knots, for light prefers to travel with a tune. [404]
Then he wound the drum so gently that the handle created more listening than motion, like turning a page underwater. [424]
The resonance chamber brightened as if stories remembered how they ended, and the floor shook off a sleep named doubt. [444]
He played a scale backward to find the door into midnight, then stepped through the keyhole that the scale became. [464]
Midnight was not a color but a town that forgot it had windows, and everyone wore apology as a collar. [484]
Lamps stood like sleeping animals, their light tethered to stakes of fear hammered by a constable whose badge was a shadow. [505]
The constable smiled, and the repairman felt his knees soften, because that smile lied about its kindness. [522]
He steadied himself by naming the tools in his pocket, and the names, being honest, watered his courage. [540]
I will take only what is ours, he told the town aloud, to make truth a map everyone could walk. [560]
He began with the quiet lamps, loosening their fear stakes until the light remembered migration. [575]
The chip hummed a key that persuaded the sky to unlock a window, and through that square came morning in exile. [596]
The constable reached for the chain on the window and tried to shut it, and the repairman used his odd old method. [618]
He practiced mending what isn't torn, sewing patience into the hinge so that the future slammed door would refuse to exist. [639]
The hinge forgot how to betray, and the window stayed open like a mouth choosing to sing. [656]
Daylight leapt from circle to circle, each lamp passing it along like a rumor that makes everyone kinder. [674]
He wound the drum again and drew the light behind him, a bright tether singing harmless knots that unlearned fear. [694]
Back through the keyhole he went, crossing the threshold into the chamber, where the elders waited with their careful rust. [714]
He did not yield the morning to their doctrine, yet he bowed, and set the light upon the floor like bread. [735]
They listened, and in listening they heard that rust was not betrayed, because what returns to breathe holds time more gently. [756]
So they amended their oath to protect the soft balance where bright meets brittle, an honest compromise hammered thin like leaf. [777]
He let the morning loose inside the dome, and it settled into every gear like oil that smells of apples. [797]
tinkersong wonder blossomed. [800]</story>
