<story>I clock in at the sea level monitoring station, drifting moored among buoys and beeps. [15]
It is years after the fossil fuel ban, yet the tides still rehearse old griefs. [30]
I am a coral bleaching witness, and the reefs I loved taught me to count absences. [46]
They went white like secrets withheld, then sloughed away by heat and time. [59]
Now I watch levels climb and fall, and I listen for the patterns under the noise. [75]
On the steel desk lies an atlas page torn out, creased, sunsoft, smelling of basement rain. [91]
It shows the Pilgrims Trace across the flats, a path my mother walked before I was born. [108]
She did not vanish, but her stories did, each tide taking details until the route blurred. [124]
I came here to discover why some paths disappear, and not only on maps. [138]
The trace is marked by stubs of posts and cairns of bottle glass, and yet some days it is gone. [158]
I assemble a scatter of notes, sensor logs, and fishermen rumors into the shape of an answer. [175]
Part of my method is a practice of tapping rhythms on surfaces, counting seconds, swells, and doubts. [192]
I tap the railing with a knuckle, the bulkhead with a ring, the clipboard with a pen. [209]
The rhythms steady me, an anchor with a drift, a metronome for weather and memory. [224]
I send slow taps along the pipe to the outpost shack, where Jun keeps the battery foxed and humming. [243]
He answers in a waltz, and we log tide, wind, and rumor while the gulls heckle like unpaid auditors. [262]
The page and the posts do not match the present; the flats swerve and silt into new intentions. [280]
Since the dredgers shut down after the ban, currents relearned their long handwriting. [293]
The moon, too, writes here, its pull periodically eternal, a long verse broken into repeatable lines. [309]
But I do not see that yet; the revelation will arrive late, as if obeying its own tide table. [328]
For months I take measurements, cross the flats at sanctioned hours, and come back with silted shoes. [345]
Some days the Trace opens like a throat, and you can hear the sea speak softly inside it. [363]
Other days it refuses us, a mirage paved with glinting eels and rumor. [376]
A woman from the village asks if ghosts are moving the stakes, and I tell her ghosts prefer cliffs. [395]
What I do not tell her is that I keep hearing my mother's steps inside my taps, keeping time. [414]
She is alive inland, old and bright, but the path of her stories has been eroding since the heat. [433]
The delayed revelation begins with boredom, as good truths often do. [444]
I fall into the habit of tapping dates into the railing, three beats for each month and a pause for moons. [465]
Jun hears the pattern lengthening, and he sends up a note with biscuits and the word node underlined twice. [484]
I go back to the atlas page torn out, and there in a margin is my mother's careful script, nodes? [504]
I assemble the logs, the page, the village dates of drownings and safe crossings, and the old hydrograph charts. [523]
The tide record breathes with an eighteen year ache, the nodal nod, a longer swell tugging the shallows thin. [542]
In the years of wider tides, the Trace is tricked earlier, sunk by a thumb on the lunar scale. [561]
In the years of narrow tides, it returns, almost faithful, periodically eternal and never guaranteed. [576]
Old dredging once masked it, but since the ban the sea has been speaking in its original meter. [594]
I write to the council and to the elders, tapping the news before ink dries. [609]
We mark the path anew with flexible beacons that float at slack and lean at warning angles. [626]
Jun paints the posts with reflective sand, and my mother sends a tin of sweets with a note, brave. [645]
We hold a small meeting on the dock, steaming bowls against the wind, explaining how a path can be older than memory and still be late. [671]
The children learn the taps and the moons, and we hang a bell that lifts when the wider tides begin. [691]
We do not restore the reefs, but we swear to cross the flats in kindness, light, and listening. [709]
From the tower I tap a thank you along the pipe, and Jun replies with a reel and a laugh. [729]
The station hums, drifting moored as always, its bolts salted, its data bright as stars. [744]
I slide the atlas page into a sleeve, not returned to the book but kept where it can lead. [763]
Some paths disappear because we forget to hear them, and some because the moon remembers to widen. [780]
Either way the lesson arrives late, and we make room for it, assembling a future that can wait. [798]</story>
